    <p>Sirius had sent Harry and Tom a nutcracker for Christmas. This on its own was neither out of character nor cause for concern, as Sirius frequently enjoyed sending them the most random of things whenever he came across them. What was notable, however, was that the nutcracker looked exactly like Tom, right down to the little curl on its forehead.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s not that funny,” Tom said, when Harry couldn’t stop laughing.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s you,” Harry said, snorting, “dressed in red. With a large hat. It’s not just funny, it’s perfect.”</p><p> </p><p>Tom had then threatened to chuck the thing into the fireplace, to which Harry had responded by pouting and clutching Nutcracker Tom close to his chest. This had resulted in the mature response of Tom trying to wrestle it away from him, and that was how they had ended up in a tussle on the floor of their quarters.</p><p> </p><p>“Over my dead body,” Harry said, keeping a firm hold on the toy as Tom made another grab for it.</p><p> </p><p>Still trying to keep possession of the nutcracker as Tom continued to attempt to snatch it, Harry was forced to resort to more and more erratic movements. Eventually they ended up in a heap on the rug by the fireplace, which was when the back of Harry’s fist smacked into the wall. The nutcracker slipped from Harry’s grasp and onto the floor, bouncing and skidding to a stop a few feet away.</p><p> </p><p>They both stared at it, unmoving.</p><p> </p><p>Suddenly there was another loud thump, and Harry saw that the gauntlets that had been resting on their mantle were now falling directly towards him. Harry was partly pinned into place by Tom, who also had looked up at the noise, but the gauntlets, still encased in their magically-charmed glass, seemed unstoppable in their trajectory.</p><p> </p><p>As the glass casing glanced off of his forehead, Harry felt a sharp pain stabbing into his brain. He only saw a brief flicker of the horror on Tom’s face before his consciousness faded to away to endless black nothingness.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>Harry woke to the feeling of a cold, dry hand pressed against his cheek. There was also a dull throb of pain in his forehead, like he’d taken a Bludger to the head during a Quidditch match.</p><p> </p><p>“Hello, can you hear me?”</p><p> </p><p>The voice was gentle and familiar, and the touch was kind, so Harry allowed himself to blink slowly a few times before he fully opened his eyes.</p><p> </p><p>Tom was looking down at him in concern, though his form was a bit blurry. Harry realized that he was no longer wearing his glasses. They must have fallen off at some point, he thought to himself.</p><p> </p><p>“Tom?” Harry asked, still feeling woozy as he sat up. “What happened? Did I pass out?”</p><p> </p><p>Dark eyes stared back in confusion. “You fell and hit your head. How are you feeling?”</p><p> </p><p>Harry rubbed at his face, trying to distinguish if he was actually injured, or if he was just bruised from hitting his head on the floor. “I think I’m alright, Tom. Where are my glasses?”</p><p> </p><p>Tom made a noise, then pulled away momentarily. “Hold on, I think they’re here.” Then Harry felt the cold metal of his glasses frames pressed into his palm, so he shoved his glasses quickly onto his face.</p><p> </p><p>“Better?” Tom asked, his hand now resting on Harry’s forearm.</p><p> </p><p>Harry blinked.</p><p> </p><p>“Tom?” he asked again, because Tom was… he was dressed like the toy nutcracker. Tall black hat, brass-buttoned uniform with the gold trim, dark charcoal trousers. The uniform was even the same shade of red that the doll’s had been, which threw Harry for a moment, because seeing Tom in colours other than green was always shocking to him.</p><p> </p><p>“My name’s not Tom,” said… Tom. Or whoever it was.</p><p> </p><p>Harry sat there, not saying anything, trying to decide if Tom was trying to put one over him, or if this was just some weird, eggnog-induced dream. It was then that he remembered the gauntlets from their mantleplace had landed on his head, and that it had been because he and Tom had been fighting over the nutcracker.</p><p> </p><p>“My name is Riddle,” the man who looked like Tom continued, offering his hand out. “And you must be Harry Potter.” </p><p> </p><p>Finally, Harry regained enough sense to look around. His head was throbbing a little, but he noticed that they were in the middle of a large clearing. He was surrounded on all sides by snow and trees. It reminded him a bit of the Forbidden Forest, come to think of it. </p><p> </p><p>“Where am I?” Harry asked, deciding that this was, in fact, probably just a strange dream. </p><p> </p><p>“You’re in Godric’s Kingdom,” said Riddle. And Harry could see, then, that this man was obviously not Tom.</p><p> </p><p>Or at least, Riddle wasn’t <em> his </em> Tom, because his Tom was markedly different from the person who was kneeling before him. Tom would not have been caught dead wearing a hat as large as the one the nutcracker was wearing. This was Nutcracker Tom. Which meant that Harry was definitely asleep. Or that he’d gone crazy. </p><p> </p><p>Harry took Riddle’s hand and allowed himself to be pulled to his feet. “How do you know my name?” </p><p> </p><p>Riddle smiled, and the sight was so achingly reassuring that Harry had to look away again, back out at the blank snow. “You’re the Chosen One, Harry. Everyone here knows your name.” </p><p> </p><p>“...Right,” Harry said. </p><p> </p><p>Riddle reached out again, this time to gently probe at Harry’s forehead. “I think you’re going to scar,” Riddle said wonderingly.</p><p> </p><p>Harry felt at the spot where Riddle had touched, winced, and withdrew his hand to see blood staining his fingertips.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s just a cut,” Riddle said quickly. “But you may have a concussion. I saw you hit the ground fairly hard. You fell out of a tree.” </p><p> </p><p>Suddenly, there was the sound of barking in the distance. Riddle’s face scrunched up, but he straightened and looked over in the direction of the noise. “Damn scoundrel,” Riddle said. Then he shouted, “We’re over here, you useless mutt!”</p><p> </p><p>A large black dog came bounding out from the trees. It seemed very happy to see Harry—it trotted up and began to rub dog fur all over Harry’s pyjama trousers.</p><p> </p><p>“Sirius?” Harry asked, confused. He bent over to pet the dog’s head anyways, noting that the soft fur felt… unnervingly realistic.</p><p> </p><p>“This is Padfoot,” said Riddle. “He won’t quit following me around, so I’m stuck with him.” He nudged at Padfoot with his boot. Padfoot opened his mouth in response, so that his tongue rolled out playfully. Harry noticed that there was indeed a tag hanging loosely from a rope around the dog’s neck that declared him to be named ‘Padfoot’.</p><p> </p><p>Harry gave Padfoot another head scratch out of habit. This entire dream scenario was really going too far. </p><p> </p><p>Padfoot wiggled away from Harry, his tail wagging as he whirled around to face Riddle.</p><p> </p><p>“If you lick me again,” Riddle warned, taking a step back, “I <em> will </em> stab you with my sword.”</p><p> </p><p>Padfoot whined at this, but ceased his approach. Then he perked back up again, turning towards the forest. Riddle stopped as well, looking in the same direction.</p><p> </p><p>Harry paused, trying to listen. In the distance, it sounded like… sword fighting. Metal clashing against metal, accompanied by the sounds of shouting.</p><p> </p><p>“We have to go,” Riddle said suddenly, reaching over to grab Harry by the hand. “We need to go <em> now</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>And so they ran. Even though Harry was barefoot, the snow did not seem terribly cold beneath his feet. If anything, it felt as though he was walking on a very soft white blanket.</p><p> </p><p>Riddle was keeping firm hold of Harry’s hand, their fingers laced together as he led them both through the trees. Padfoot was running next to them, weaving in and out between the shrubbery so fast that there were small leaves and twigs clinging to his fur. Harry strained to listen again; the sounds of marching and fighting were getting closer.</p><p> </p><p>Harry felt in his pockets for his wand. It was there, thankfully, so he pulled it out and aimed it at the path ahead.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Diffindo!</em>” he shouted, and was relieved to see a large branch ahead of them fall to the ground. His magic still worked here in the dream.</p><p> </p><p>From where he was standing next to Harry, Riddle gaped, his mouth falling open. “You really <em> are </em> the Chosen One.”</p><p> </p><p>“I—” Harry started, but was cut off from answering, because the battle had finally arrived.</p><p> </p><p>What he saw was by far more alarming than the sight of Tom Riddle dressed in gold and maroon.</p><p> </p><p>There were large snakes dressed in metal armor fighting against what appeared to be gigantic gingerbread men holding broadswords.</p><p> </p><p>Harry reached his free hand up to pinch at his arm. Nothing happened.</p><p> </p><p>“Alright,” Riddle said, releasing Harry and pushing his way ahead. “Get behind me and I will protect you. Should I fall, you must take Padfoot and reach Godric’s Castle without me.” Then he pulled out his own sword and fell into a dueling stance.</p><p> </p><p>This Riddle was really more of a Gryffindor, Harry thought to himself fondly. Riddle looked every inch the handsome, dashing movie hero in his ridiculous nutcracker outfit. “I think I’ll be alright,” Harry said, positioning himself in a similar stance. “I’m guessing the snakes are the enemies?”</p><p> </p><p>“They are creatures made by the Snake King,” Riddle said, taking a bold step forward. “He is the only one who can command them.”</p><p> </p><p>Wand held aloft, Harry eyed the snakes curiously. Upon closer inspection, they looked very much like the colourful snakes that Tom had gotten the Weasley children for Christmas last year. He could see the two snakes that belonged to Rose and Hugo amongst the combatants.</p><p> </p><p>Deciding he really had nothing to lose, Harry held his wand up to his throat and cast the Voice-Amplification Charm. Then, carefully keeping his gaze on the snakes, he hissed out, “<em>Ssstop.</em>”</p><p> </p><p>The battle halted immediately. A few of the gingerbread soldiers even fell over as their swords failed to connect to where they had expected their targets to be.</p><p> </p><p>After his birthday last year, Tom had taken it upon himself to teach Harry a few words and commands in Parseltongue. Harry had never thought that they would come in handy for anything other than their occasional use in seducing his ridiculous husband, but apparently being able to speak to snakes had its uses in dreamland.</p><p> </p><p>“Incredible,” Riddle breathed. He relaxed his pose, his sword now loose at his side. “That was absolutely incredible, Harry.”</p><p> </p><p>Padfoot barked in agreement, jumping up to place his paws on Harry’s chest, panting his smelly dog breath into Harry’s face. Then he leapt back down, trotting over towards the gingerbread men, pacing around them as though he was monitoring their actions.</p><p> </p><p>Riddle reached for Harry’s hand again, his expression delighted. “You’re going to save the kingdom,” Riddle said reverently. “I knew you were special from the moment I saw you.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry, watching as the gingerbread soldiers began to round up the docile snakes, decided that now was as good a time as any to ask. “What, exactly, is the Chosen One supposed to do?”</p><p> </p><p>“You don’t know?” Riddle asked, his face falling slightly. “Well, I suppose you might not. The Chosen One is a hero of prophecy, Harry. The Royal Seer, also known as the Sugar Plum Fairy, declared that a man named Harry Potter would be the one to defeat the Snake King and restore Godric’s Kingdom to peace and prosperity.”</p><p> </p><p>“Who is the Snake King?” Harry asked.</p><p> </p><p>“We do not speak his name,” Riddle said darkly, frowning. “He is an evil man, Harry. More inhuman than the creatures he sends to slaughter our people.”</p><p> </p><p>“But who is he?” Harry insisted. He had the strange feeling that Riddle was hiding something from him, and this suspicion was only confirmed when he saw Riddle’s jaw stiffen.</p><p> </p><p>Then Riddle looked away from Harry, his eyes moving to where the snakes were now all tied up together.</p><p> </p><p>“How am I supposed to defeat him, if I don’t know anything about him?” Harry asked, more gently this time.</p><p> </p><p>“You don’t need to know anything about him,” Riddle said, his gaze snapping back to Harry. “Now, come. We must make haste to Godric’s Castle.”</p><p> </p><p>This time, Harry held out his hand first. Riddle took it, entwining their fingers together, and they set off once again.</p>
