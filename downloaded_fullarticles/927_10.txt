    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p>It has been two years since the War has ended. Rebuilding efforts are still underway, and the Wizarding World has been going through a major infrastructure change. Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and all the Weasleys have become widely known as heroes, saviors, defenders of the light and enemies to the dark. </p><p>They are war heroes, but they are also grieving, mourning, and moving on. </p><p>All of them, except for Percy Weasley. </p><p>But before continuing on, you (the reader) needs to know two things. </p><p>First, Percy Weasley knows three things. </p><p>One, he's a mess. An absolute, completely unfixable fucking mess. He should be able to move on, fix his life and self, but some days it's too hard to even wake up. Even thinking of trying to do anything is too completely daunting.</p><p>He <em>should</em> be able to pull himself together. He <em>should</em> be able to stop being such a fucking mess. But he can't. </p><p>Two, he'll never be good enough. Oh, he tries of course. He tries and he tries and he tries, but he always manages to veer off even the straightest paths and fuck everything up. No matter what, he'll never be good enough, and it's time he accepted that he'll never be like Bill, all rugged charm and charisma, or Charlie, reckless and unafraid of danger, or F- George, popular and funny, or Ron, loyal and always ready to do what's right, or Ginny, strong and fiercely protective of those she loves. </p><p>He'll never be good enough, and it's time he accepted that. </p><p>Three, he's not worth loving. Maybe, just maybe, he'd been worthy of love once, a long long time ago, before he went and fucked everything up. </p><p>All he knows is that he's isn't worthy of anything, not <em>now</em>. Not anymore. </p><p>Maybe he never was. </p><p align="left">The second thing is this. </p><p align="left">If you'd asked a random wizard or witch you'd found on the street about Percy Weasley, they'd furrow their brow and squint their eyes, before finally replying, "A Weasley? Never heard of him. Must not be a <em>Weasley-Weasley</em>, if you catch my drift." </p><p align="left">If you'd asked someone working under Percy, or anyone in the Ministry really, they'd say, "Well, he's hardworking and all, but a bit <em>boring</em> really. Wasn't he involved in that scandal a few years back before the War? And you know, I heard that" and so on, because Ministry workers love a good gossip (a student had once postulated that if Ministry workers cut back their gossip time, and were not given any breaks ever, they'd get so much done that there would be no real use for the Ministry. The Department of Communication gave him a slap on the back and an award, but only because the head of the department was having a bit of beef with the head of the Department of Internal Affairs, who was ashamed to be the father of the aforementioned student who'd written it as a joke. Percy had read that in third year, in a book titled <em>0101 less useful facts</em>.) </p><p align="left">If you'd asked his family, who knew him marginally better than his employees but made more efforts, they'd reply vaguely, "He's a bit of a prat, but he's family. Even if he left us, and he didn't show up for Bill's wedding. Wait, why am I telling you all of this? How did you even get here? This is private property!" </p><p align="left">Finally, if you'd asked one Oliver Wood, Keeper for Puddlemere United, all-around good guy, Quidditch fan(atic), and unquestionably the person who knew Percy best, he'd reply with a shrug, "He's Percy." If you were to push him even further, say, ask him if he thought Percy was perfect, he'd stare at you in the eye as if you were crazy and say, simply, "Of course he's perfect. He's Percy." (This did, in fact, happen. It was at a gathering between friends, someone spiked the firewhiskey to the degree that you could spike <em>firewhiskey</em>, Oliver was drunk, they were playing Truth or Dare, and Angelina was sober). </p><p align="left">Now that you (the reader) know this, the following events that are merely following the natural order of Things will make (more) sense. </p><p align="left">At 6 o'clock on a Friday afternoon, exactly two years and two months after the War, Percy Weasley walks briskly out of his office into a mostly empty Ministry (mostly empty, because the Ministry is never <em>truly</em> empty; that would defeat the whole point of the Ministry). Under his arm, he's holding a binder filled with paperwork, and in his other hand, he's holding a briefcase overflowing with papers, all of them urgent. </p><p align="left">Percy is the head of the Department of Transportation and Communication, a job that he has earned only because he was the single most competent person left from the previous administration. The Death Eaters had not been too great at running a government, and they'd relied on people like Percy to ensure that it didn't totally collapse, giving him more responsibility and work than they should have. As a result, he'd emerged from the War as one of the few people who knew what was going on government-wise, and had been promoted (or demoted?) to head of the Department of Transportation and Communication. It meant longer hours and more work, but Percy had always been good at that sort of thing, so he doesn't mind. </p><p align="left">And really, he can't even complain about the time he gets off work, because it's the same time Oliver gets off his, so he always comes to pick him up.</p><p align="left">Percy is standing in front of the fountain, the new one that depicts Harry with jets of red shooting out of his wand (always delights the kids) and a plaque that asks witches and wizards to "Please donate generously, as all funds go to efforts to rebuild the magical community after the War." </p><p align="left">10 minutes have passed since 6 o'clock, and Oliver is late. Percy checks his watch again, almost anxiously, and wonders if Oliver is not coming after all. </p><p align="left">He comes everyday, invariably and unerringly, and is never, ever late, so much so that people have begun to speculate that the uptight Percy Weasley is Oliver Wood's secret sweetheart (not his words). But maybe Oliver has grown tired of Percy. Maybe he's seen who Percy truly is, how flawed and terribly fucked up he's always been, and has decided that he doesn't want to have anything to do with Percy, which would be very bad not only because Oliver is probably his only friend but also because he's the only person Percy can stand living with, and is currently his roommate. </p><p align="left">It's kind of ironic, really, a cruel twist of fate that he's back to rooming with Oliver again. Some things just don't change, he supposes.</p><p align="left">Wait, he tells himself. Calm down. Don't overthink this. He's probably just late or something. He checks his watch again. 15 minutes late. His stomach sinks. </p><p align="left">Just wait. Don't overthink this. Just wait.</p><p align="left">So he waits, seconds flying by like smoke, and he feels grey and cloudy and dizzy. A bad metaphor, he knows, but he read it in a book once and he's been partial to it ever since. </p><p align="left">Wait. Don't overthink this, he tells himself again. He thinks he might be able to calm down, if only he repeats the phrases enough times. </p><p align="left">Wait. Don't overthink this. Calm down. </p><p align="left">Wait. Don't overthink this. Calm down. </p><p align="left">Wait. Don-</p><p align="left">"Percy? Is that you? Hey, Percy!" </p><p align="left">He turns to the sound of the voice, finding, unexpectedly, Ginny and Harry. They both look flushed, probably from running-though Merlin knows why they were running, of all things-and he is struck by how young they are, eyes bright, mouth grinning so widely he wonders if it's normal, cheeks flushed with exertion and happiness. </p><p align="left">They are so young. The Wizarding World forgets that their Savior is only a boy of 20, that he was robbed of the chance of a normal school experience because of his lightning-bolt scar, that he did not finish his seventh year because the Ministry had too important a job as the head of a special Auror deployment for him to refuse. </p><p align="left">They forget that Ginny, forever immortalized as a key rebel player and leader of the DA, has only just finished school, and is already being deployed in some of the most dangerous fields there is, fighting fiercely and unrelentingly to chase down Death Eaters and have them convicted, pursuing criminals that wouldn't hesitate to kill her or those she loves. </p><p align="left">They forget that they were only children forced to grow too quickly, and Percy finds himself falling down the familiar spiral of guilt and what-ifs and if-onlys and shame. </p><p align="left">Guilt is a selfish emotion, he thinks. You make things about yourself when really, <em>they</em> are suffering, not you. Selfish, he thinks. He's selfish. </p><p align="left">"Hi, Ginny, Harry," he gives them a faint, awkward smile. They give each other fond glances in between alternating smiling at him. </p><p align="left">"How are you, Perce? I haven't seen you since, well..." she trails off, giving him a look, and he feels the tips of his ears flush red with shame. Ginny has always been his favorite sibling, and the only one of them who could make him feel so guilty for not seeing her often, and the only one who ever asked him how he felt and meant it.</p><p align="left">"Er, been busy and all, but not that bad. You?" </p><p align="left">She beams at Harry but her smile is directed at him. "Okay, I guess. I mean, as good as it can be. We're just back from a, er, work trip. You know what I mean, right?" </p><p align="left">"Yeah. I mean, who do you think arranged your trip? Found you a place to stay? Not the Auror Department, that's for sure." </p><p align="left">Harry chuckles a little, and admits sheepishly, "We are pretty bad at all of this paperwork and governmental stuff." </p><p align="left">Percy rolls his eyes, but it's less in annoyance and more out of habit. </p><p align="left">"So Perce, what are you doing here?"</p><p align="left">"Umm..." he trails off nervously. This is not a topic he wants to talk about, but Ginny is staring at him eyebrow raised. She knows, he thinks suddenly, but how could she? She doesn't <em>know. </em>Even if she does, she doesn't know about <em>that</em>, because he made sure that no one would ever know. But she still looks at him curiously, knowingly, and he feels nervous and faint and dizzier than he did at the possibility of Oliver knowing how fucked up he is, because if Ginny knows, then maybe Oliver does too, and maybe that's why he's not here today. </p><p align="left">She can't know. </p><p align="left">"I'm waiting for someone, actually," he says as loftily as he can, but she doesn't bite like his brothers would, and she only looks at him, waiting silently. Beside her, Harry is oblivious, though he is frowning at his watch. </p><p align="left">"Who?" </p><p align="left">"Ah, well," his ears must be so red, they could light up a fucking Christmas tree, "if you must know..." </p><p align="left">"I must," she replies coolly and firmly. </p><p align="left">"Er, well. It's, er. It's Oliver. You know, Oliver Wood. He's my roommate." </p><p align="left">The name catches Harry's interest, and Ginny stops talking to Percy in favor of contemplating what exactly he meant by that statement. Percy can tell; you don't live with someone for 19 years without learning a few things about them. </p><p align="left">"Oliver? Oh, how's he doing? Haven't seen him since... Oh well actually, he was there at Sunday Dinner two weeks ago, wasn't he Gin?" </p><p align="left">He turns to Ginny, who nods slightly. She swivels on Percy and asks, "He was. How come you didn't go? You haven't been coming to Sunday Dinners for a long time, Perce." </p><p align="left">He stutters through his words and fumbles with his excuses, but before his traitorous mouth can make a bigger fool of himself, he hears a crashing noise and Oliver, slightly banged up, puts an arm on Percy's shoulder. </p><p align="left">His heart stops, for a beat. </p><p align="left">"H-hey, Perce, 'm so sorry 'm late but there wa' this huge problem with Pepper and ya know." He pants through an explanation, and Percy's heart beats too loudly in his chest. </p><p align="left">Ginny gives them a look, as does Harry, though they convey two extremely different things. </p><p align="left">Ginny's look is along the lines of "Hmmm..." while Harry's is more like a "What the bloody hell is he talking about?" </p><p align="left">Understandable. Percy wouldn't understand Oliver either, if they hadn't lived together for so long. </p><p align="left">"Oh, hey, Harry, Ginny! Haven't seen ya guys since, what, two weeks ago?" </p><p align="left">Harry goes to say something, but Ginny grabs on to his arm firmly, and smiles widely. </p><p align="left">"Yeah, sorry we can't stay to catch up. We have to be somewhere, but see you on Sunday, yeah? And for the record, don't say that you couldn't possibly intrude, because you have a standing invitation. And bring Perce with you, that's the only way he'll come. Bye Perce! It was nice talking to you," she shouts everything so quickly he has to wait a few seconds for all of her words to catch up in his head, and by that time, they're gone, leaving Oliver and him alone. </p><p align="left">"Well," Oliver blinks slowly, "that was fast. D'you reckon they were actually busy, or she just hates us?"</p><p align="left">"She loves you," Percy replies, rolling his eyes, "because you're the only person who can talk Quidditch as much as she does. No one else can keep up, not even Harry, and we all know how obsessed he is."</p><p align="left">"Ha! I don't know how she stays so updated, considering she doesn't even work in the field. Anyways, you know how I was late? Pepper was actually trying to convince me to go with the team to some bar," he makes a face of distaste, "but I told her I couldn't because I was meeting you."</p><p align="left">"Oh," Percy says, "you don't have to, you know, er, not go because of me. I know it's a bit of a routine, but, er, you really don't have to, you know, miss out on a good time because of, well. Me." </p><p align="left">He's still reeling from the surprise of it a bit, enough to prevent him from forming coherent sentences. He's known Oliver for so long, true, but he's still shocked that Oliver would pass up all of that in favor of, well, <em>him</em>.</p><p align="left">"I want to," Oliver says firmly, "I'd rather spend time with you at home than without you at some bar. Even if all of my teammates are there and having a good time."</p><p align="left">Ah, there's the guilt again. He shouldn't be preventing Oliver from spending time with his well-beloved teammates, or isolating him so purposefully and ridding him of the chance of having fun. </p><p align="left">"What if," he hesitates, "if I came with you? To the bar, I mean. Like, you know. I've never met your teammates before, might be the chance?"</p><p align="left">Oliver looks at him for a few seconds, looking thoroughly uncomfortable, before admitting, "I-Well, I didn't-I just, er. Well, okay."</p><p align="left">"Wait. What's wrong?"</p><p align="left">"Er, well, actually, I didn't want you to meet them." Oliver admits it all sheepishly, looking thoroughly sorry to have brought himself in such an awkward position. </p><p align="left">"Oh."</p><p align="left">Something in him sinks deep to the pit of his gut, and his heart feels like it's been squeezed tight.</p><p align="left">"Ah, um, okay. Y-you know you can go. You don't have to I'm perfectly fine on my own and-"</p><p align="left">"No, no, Perce, I didn't mean it like that! I'm not ashamed of you! I could <em>never</em> be ashamed of you, Perce."</p><p align="left">He says it so fiercely Percy can't help but believe him, and something wound so tight in his chest relaxes, just a little. </p><p align="left">"Actually, it was kind of the opposite," Oliver admits, sheepishly, "not that I'm ashamed of them, or anything. It's just-well. They're, you know, a little brutish, sometimes. I didn't want to, you know. Scare you away, I guess."</p><p align="left">"Scare me? You couldn't possibly," Percy replies, a teasing smile on his face. Oliver shakes his head, and grins, offering his arm. </p><p align="left">"Don't say I didn't warn you," he says, before the world whirls around him and fades into darkness. </p><p align="left">The world reappears a few seconds later, in the form of a crowded bar with neon-ish lights that can be seen from the dark alley they appeared in. </p><p align="left">The inside of the bar is even more crowded than Percy expected. It's a muggle bar, so the other Quidditch players are easy to spot though they are dressed in muggle clothing-or at least, what he thinks is supposed to be muggle clothing. </p><p align="left">"You didn't tell me this was a muggle bar," he hisses in Oliver's ear. Oliver only gives a sheepish grin. He's already dressed in muggle clothing, though Oliver always wears muggle clothing as casual clothes. He always looks amazing, but sometimes it's positively <em>sinful</em>-</p><p align="left">No. Percy is <em>not</em> going down that train of thought. He tears his mind away and murmurs a discreet charm that immediately transfigures his wizard clothing to muggle clothing. It's technically a breach of the law, but no one's paying attention to him and if anyone noticed, which he highly doubts, it can be chalked up to either alcohol or drugs anyways. </p><p align="left">All the other Quidditch players are dressed up in jerseys for some muggle football team or another (he doesn't really pay attention; it's already exhausting enough having to keep track of Quidditch, much less one of at least dozens of muggle sports that exist), drinks in hand as they either mingle, drink, or go out to the dance floor, either among themselves or with muggles. They all wave enthusiastically at Oliver when they see him, shooting questioning at Percy with raised eyebrows. </p><p align="left">"Oliver!" A dark-skinned girl with curly hair shouts loudly, waving them over. She has a bright pink drink in one hand and a blood red drink in the other, both adorned with blue umbrellas and a pink straw. She hands one to Oliver the moment he reaches the table, smiling widely and claps him on the back. </p><p align="left">"Olive! I knew you would come! And you brought someone! Someone can actually stand your Quidditch talk outside of us?"</p><p align="left">"Oh, shut up Pepper," he ribs her affectionately, before putting a too warm hand on Percy's shoulder, "this is Percy, by the way. Percy, Pepper." </p><p align="left">"Oh my God, the infamous Percy Weasley! Wow, can't believe I'm meeting you in person! Oliver talks about you, like, all the time. Like, seriously, all. The. Time."</p><p align="left">He laughs, sounding awkward, and hopes that they can't see the flush making its way up his neck. Thankfully, before he has to respond, a pretty woman in a slim purple dress and a burly man in a red and white jersey make their way to them. The girl wraps her arm around Pepper's waist, taking a sip from Pepper's bright pink drink. </p><p align="left">"Hey," she smiles, voice friendly, "I'm Pepper's girlfriend, Marla. Nice to meet you. This is Lanslow. He's a beater. Percy, right?" </p><p align="left">"Yeah," he smiles awkwardly again, "that's me. Nice to meet you." </p><p align="left">Oliver gives his shoulder a squeeze in reassurance. </p><p align="left">"Hey, you don't have a drink right? The bar's right there. Come on, I'll get you a drink." The man-Lanslow-offers, grinning a full smile, teeth and all. </p><p align="left">"Really it's fine-" </p><p align="left">"No, seriously, come on," he leans in a little to whisper, "you don't want to stay for this. Pepper spent forever trying to convince Oliver to come and he still said no. Now he's here, but she's super pissed at him. Might as well go and get a drink, right hot stuff?"</p><p align="left">He winks, and Percy blushes dark red. Oliver's hand has slipped off his shoulder, and he regrets the warmth of it just a little bit. </p><p align="left">Before they go, Oliver grabs Lanslow's shirt and whispers something in his ear. The other boy nods, looking mockingly solemn, even giving Oliver a mock salute to which he only rolls his eyes. </p><p align="left">Lanslow grabs Percy's hand and steers him away from the trio. The music is loud, deafening and bouncing off the walls, but Percy thinks he hears Marla say, "Bringing him Oliver? Are you crazy? He's going to get devoured, poor thing." </p><p align="left">He must have heard wrong. </p><p align="left">Lanslow steers him to the bar, and orders two drinks that Percy doesn't know, which arrive promptly after two short minutes. They're both yellow and have a sugary red cherry on top. </p><p align="left">"Pina Colada," the other man says before Percy has time to open his mouth, "try it, it's good. It's a muggle drink." </p><p align="left">He gives it a skeptical look before taking a sip. It's... actually, it's not entirely horrible, which is good, he guesses. It tastes sweet and fruity and not really like wine or firewhiskey, which really isn't a bad thing considering he's never been that fond of either. Really, it just tastes like a smoothie, but with a bitter aftertaste. </p><p align="left">"How is it?" Lanslow asks, smile still on his face. He has one of those faces. The ones that always smile. Not a bad thing either. </p><p align="left">"It's okay." </p><p align="left">Before either of them have the chance to say anything, the bartender comes up again, handing Percy another drink, this one a cold blue. </p><p align="left">"For you," he says before pointing to two girls sitting next to them, "from the girls over there." </p><p align="left">They both look at the girls, who, sensing their gazes, wave and come over. Percy is more than a little confused, but Lanslow seems to know what's happening, so he supposes it must be fine. </p><p align="left">Hopefully. He's not 100% sure he can trust his judgement. </p><p align="left">"Hey," says one of them, short blond hair framing piercing dark eyes, wearing sparkly golden hoops as earrings and a turquoise dress of lace that opens up at the bottom but hangs just slightly too tightly on top, "do you want, to, er, maybe dance?" </p><p align="left">She looks just as awkward as he feels despite the fact that she's, objectively speaking, stunning. Her friend, a shoulder-length brunette with blue eyes who looks much more at ease, nudges her shoulder in an encouraging matter. </p><p align="left">
  <em>Wait a second-</em>
</p><p align="left">"Sorry, ladies, he's off limits," Lanslow rebukes them gently, a charming grin on his face, "but may I interest you to dance with one handsome gentleman?"</p><p align="left">He points to himself, and they both laugh. The blonde looks relieved (is that a good or bad?) and shakes her head gently, "No thanks. I think we'll go get another drink." </p><p align="left">They leave promptly. Their interaction was short and almost nonexistent, but Percy is still reeling from the implications. Was she trying to hit on him? Why would she try to hit on him anyway? </p><p align="left">What the fuck just happened?</p><p align="left">And what did Lanslow mean, that he was off-limits?</p><p align="left">He makes to ask, but the other man has already opened his mouth. </p><p align="left">"Are you dating Wood?" </p><p align="left">"W-Wha-I don't-I'm sorry?" </p><p align="left">Calm down Percy, he tells himself. Just breathe. Don't get a heart attack here, it would be a really shitty place to die. Plus, it would just ruin the entire evening for everyone. </p><p align="left">"Well, I didn't know Wood's roommate was going to be so hot. I thought you were just going to be, dunno, some stick or something-that's how Wood always describes you by the way-but anyway, I was going to hit on you, but Wood says you were off-limits. So, are you guys dating?"</p><p align="left">He explains all of this with a casual yet curious expression. </p><p align="left"><em>Off limits?</em> Don't get a heart attack, he reminds himself. <em>But really, off-limits? What-</em></p><p align="left">"Um, er, no, we're not, er, dating. He was just, er, probably, you know, worried about me being too, er, delicate for this sort of thing or something. Probably just looking out for me, or something."</p><p align="left">He adds a light chuckle that couldn't sound more forced, and Lanslow seems less than impressed. </p><p align="left">"Sorry," he says, getting up from his seat, "I have to go to the bathroom."</p><p align="left">He navigates through the crowded room, occasionally stumbling into someone though nobody seems to mind. People disappear and reappear in a haze of smoke and lights, and nothing seems quite real, his head light and slightly dizzy. </p><p align="left">It wasn't as if he was actually going to use the bathroom, but, well, he isn't a liar, totally. Simpy, he would maybe take long enough that by the time he reemerges, Lanslow will be gone, and he can sit and prevent the headache he feels coming on in peace. </p><p align="left">Alone. </p><p align="left">Like he's meant to be. </p><p align="left">Of course, things can never be that simple. He's just stepped foot into the bathroom (which isn't in too bad a condition) when he hears moans and groans coming from on of the stalls. </p><p align="left"><em>Nope.</em> Yeah, no, this was not what he signed up for. Merlin, how did he even <em>get</em> into this situation? </p><p align="left">Please just kill him now. </p><p align="left">He runs out of the bathroom as quickly as he can, but lingers in a corner somewhere for a few more minutes before going back to the bar. As expected, the Quidditch player is already gone, probably off dancing somewhere, and he prepares himself for a night of drinking, alone. </p><p align="left">"I wouldn't drink that if I were you," the bartender interrupts before he has the chance to take a sip, "I don't think anyone's touched it, but I still wouldn't drink it if I were you. Here." </p><p align="left">He slides another Pine Colada in front of Percy, eyes sympathetic, "Someone bought you a drink."</p><p align="left">"Thank you," he accepts, taking a sip. The bartender leaves to tend to someone else, and Percy sits there, sipping his drink and trying not to let it get to his head. </p><p align="left">Oliver is dancing with someone, stranger or teammate Percy doesn't know, but it sparks a vengeful feeling inside of him so he drinks harder and let the world swim in front of his eyes. </p><p align="left">He knows a lot of people that started drinking after the War because they needed something to help them cope. Percy was not one of those people for two reasons. </p><p align="left">One, he hardly deserves to feel numb when it is all so much his fault. Two, he is not a lightweight. Quite the opposite in fact; he can drink more than mostly everyone he knows, perhaps except for Ron, though Ron drinks even less than he does.</p><p align="left">The greatest concession he has ever been willing to make to alcohol is a release of the tight grip he has on his thoughts, letting them run free and wild in whatever direction they so choose. Of course, even this happened rarely, but the drinks kept coming and most of them are hard on the alcohol. </p><p align="left">His attention snags on a pile of green paper on the table. Muggle money. That's the good thing about muggles; they all know math and finance and all of that stuff. Hogwarts didn't even have math class! They really should implement something like that, he thinks to himself, and wonders if McGonagall would agree. She'd liked Oliver a lot, if he remembers correctly. She'd brought him his seeker and had given Harry a lifelong passion in the process. Smart woman, Professor McGonagall. </p><p align="left">She would have made a good Ministry worker, never willing to let go of an inch or compromise on anything. </p><p align="left"><em>Of course,</em> he thinks blearily, <em>I'm thinking of it again.</em></p><p align="left">His thoughts always, inevitably, drift back to the Ministry. The Ministry is where he made all of his mistakes, where he fucked everything up for a little bit of power. </p><p align="left">What can he say? </p><p align="left">He'd believed Fudge against his own family, and look where that got him. </p><p align="left">Still, Fudge was better than the Death Eaters, and much more competent (he'd kept the government running for years, which is more than Death Eaters can say).</p><p align="left">They'd been great at taking over governments, but definitely did not excel in the running a country part. The Ministry had been a mess during that time (not that it was not a mess usually, but more so then), Death Eaters running willy-nilly, hooked on power and relishing watching other suffer. It was horrible, yes, but it was also terribly inefficient. </p><p align="left">Again, guilt, that horribly selfish emotion. He is guilty. Was guilty. He should have tried more, done more.</p><p align="left">But should-haves never change anything. </p><p align="left">Still, they'd given him a position of power, more or less. He was the only remaining aide from the Fudge/Scrimgeour administrations that hadn't either died or ran away the moment trouble could be detected, and was competent enough. They thought him loyal, or at the very least, too scared to do anything, too selfish to rebel. </p><p align="left">He was selfish. Is selfish. </p><p align="left">But they'd thought that he didn't have the guts to try anything, which was partly true. People thought rebellion was loud, open and defiant, laying waste to building in puffs of smoke and ash, watching the world burn. But quiet rebellion, sneaky and unnoticeable, is much easier. </p><p align="left">It was terribly easy to write laws that were incomprehensible and could never be put into action, find ways to cut funding, delay things by having them go through endless departments of bureaucracy. It had all been so terribly easy, and quiet, and unnoticed. </p><p align="left">But in the end, he couldn't have said that he'd helped anyone. So many people had still suffered, hadn't they? </p><p align="left">What had he done, really? </p><p align="left">Nothing. </p><p align="left">Sure, it was easy to delay things, but they still happened. Even the Death Eaters had known that in the long run, you needed bureaucracy and a government, though none of them knew how exactly to use it to accomplish their goals, so they'd piled on a lot of work for him. He tried to find ways to make it so that laws that were passed made them have to go through about a dozen different checkpoints, but in the end, no matter how much delay, people had still been harmed. </p><p align="left">So what <em>had</em> he done? </p><p align="left">Nothing. </p><p align="left"><em>Oh, great,</em> he thinks to himself, <em>my thoughts are going in circles again.</em></p><p align="left">He makes a purposeful move to steer his mind clear from memories from the War, but any other topics are just as unappealing. </p><p align="left">At night, when he doesn't have the energy to actively control himself, his mind always drifts to three things. The War, Oliver, and his Family (Fred). None of them are pleasant topics (the War tastes like acrid smoke and ash that makes his throat dry, Oliver is too bittersweet, and his Family is sour guilt and acidic regret), but they're stuck in his mind, revolving continuously in a whirl of endless torment. </p><p align="left">It's, apparently, bad for his health. <em>The Quibbler</em> ran an entire issue on healthy coping mechanism and moving on a little after the War. It took advice from professional muggle therapists (which were sorely lacking in the Wizarding World), and it was proposed by Luna (hardly a surprise there; Luna is too nice for her own good, and Percy has always liked her, after being introduced by Penny). It had a whole page on self-esteem, and how self-hate wasn't conducive to anything, which Percy highly approved of but couldn't take the advice of himself. </p><p align="left">Self-love is for other people, not for him. </p><p align="left">A shock of red hair flashes across his vision, and his heart jumps wildly. </p><p align="left">Not fear. The term is anxiety, he's been told, but it's pretty damn close to fear. </p><p align="left">Not anyone in his Family, he notes with wild relief. </p><p align="left">His relationship with his family has always been... complicated, to say the least. It still is complicated. They try, and he tries, but sometimes trying isn't enough, and most of the time, he wonders if this is one of those cases or if there's still hope there for them. </p><p align="left">His relationship with his siblings are mostly okay. He's never been too close with Bill, who was always too old and too cool to hang around Percy, though he was rather sorry that he had missed his wedding with Fleur. Charlie is undeniably the closest with Bill, and their tight bond had left little room for Percy, their overly-serious and no-fun little brother, who had grown from boring to bad to worse. </p><p align="left">With Ron, Percy was always so sickeningly worried. Even before Hogwarts and everything with Harry, Ron always got in trouble for all the wrong reasons (as if there were any right reasons to get in trouble); Percy could understand people who got into trouble for whatever personal reason, who understood that if they were caught, there would be consequences and that they would be able to withstand those consequences. But Ron only ever got in trouble for someone else, simply because he would never have done it for himself. Maybe Percy is wrong, but he had always been so worried that someday, Ron would find someone that wouldn't hesitate to use him for their own purposes (he'd always been so, so worried for Ron). </p><p align="left">Ginny was and still is his favorite sibling. She always was fierce and straightforward, unafraid of herself, much less anyone else. But she'd wanted approval (not as much as him. Oh, how fiercely he'd wanted it, and how dejected he'd been when he hadn't gotten it), and their paths had inevitably diverged. She had her own world, now, one that didn't require him. </p><p align="left">And finally, Fred and George. The Twins. Out all of his siblings, he had the most complicated relationship with the twins. Even before Fred's death (fuck, don't think about it, fuck, fuck, fuck), theirs was a complicated one. He is almost sure they must have loved him at some point, somewhere in between Charlie and Bill leaving for Hogwarts, and Ron and Ginny being born, but he is sure they had also almost always hated him.</p><p align="left">Now... now he doesn't George had it in him to hate anyone anymore. </p><p align="left">He should stop thinking about it.</p><p align="left">Stop.</p><p align="left">Stop.</p><p align="left">Stop.</p><p align="left">Stop. </p><p align="left">Maybe if he repeats it long enough, it actually will stop. Or maybe, he'll lose his mind. </p><p align="left">That's fine. He's already lost most of his mind anyway. There's nothing worth salvaging in there.</p><p align="left">Stop. </p><p align="left">Stop.</p><p align="left">Stop. </p><p align="left">Merlin, why can't everything just stop? </p><p align="left">The lights are too bright, the noises are too loud, the entire fucking bar is just too crowded. Why did he come here? He never should have come. </p><p align="left">Why can't everything just <em>stop</em>?</p><p align="left">Stop. </p><p align="left">Stop. </p><p align="left">Deep breaths, one, two, three. </p><p align="left">Deep breaths. </p><p align="left">One.</p><p align="left">Two.</p><p align="left">Three.</p><p align="left">Stop. </p><p align="left">He opens his eyes, takes another deep breath, composes himself. He's fine, everything is fine. It must have just been something. Over-stimulation, maybe. He's not sure, but he's fine.</p><p align="left">It's all fine. </p><p align="left">He can just go back home, to Oliver's flat, but he needs to go tell Oliver first. The prospect of wading through the ever-thickening crowd makes him slightly queasy, but what other choice does he have? </p><p align="left">He stands up and prepares to leave, but Oliver pops out of nowhere and slings an arm around Percy, looking too drunk and yet, still concerned. </p><p align="left">"Peerce 'm soooo dizzy. Ha, the room's spinning. You' face' spinning. But's pretty. Ha' I told you? Your face's pretty. You're pretty." </p><p align="left">He babbles a little more nonsense, drunk words slurring and his drink, which is still in his hand, sloshing around. </p><p align="left">Percy sighs, quietly relieved.</p><p align="left">"Come on," he grabs Oliver's arm. It won't take too long to get to the alley, and they can apparate from there. </p><p align="left">"Wait. You okay? You look bad," Oliver suddenly says, looking more focused and sober than he has for their entire interaction. </p><p align="left">"I'm fine. I just need some rest. Now come one, you big lug, let's go home." </p><p align="left">If he were sober, Oliver would harp more on this. But as he is, drunk out of his mind, he lets the topic go, muttering a quiet "Okay" that Percy almost doesn't hear over the din of the bar. </p><p align="left">Later, when Oliver's put to bed, and Percy's lying on his own, he thinks back to that question. Is he okay? </p><p align="left">No, he supposes, he's not.</p><p align="left">He's broken and tired and out of his mind and so horribly fucked up and completely insane, and he just wishes everything could stop. </p><p align="left">But that's fine. </p><p align="left">It's more than he deserves, anyway. </p>
