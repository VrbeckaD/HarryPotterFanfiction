    <p align="justify">Harry’s coming back from a positively terrible hunt when he hears it. Someone’s hiding in the bushes. He immediately stops whistling and looks around, putting the last blueberry into his mouth and chewing slowly. He knows the forest’s been full of them lately, the hunters, wearing earthy coloured clothing to remain undetectable amongst the trees, throwing daggers, killing with stakes. They’ve always been a threat, humans, not enough to be too scared of them, but once they’d figured out the way to kill vampires, it became obvious that they were going to try their best to get rid of them once and for all. Harry swallows and looks around wary.</p><p align="justify">Harry takes a step toward where he thinks the human is hiding. He can’t see him, not from where he’s standing, but he can smell him – the smell of blood and adrenaline float in the air between them<em>. </em>He takes another step and then there’s a dagger being thrown at his face. Harry ducks down and curses loudly, taking a few steps back, and scanning the forest in front of him.</p><p align="justify">“That’s not very nice, you know!” Harry shouts into the woods, walks backward; his breathing is getting faster because, <em>fuck, </em>he can’t see the person attacking him and that’s never good news. He takes a deep breath and <em>listens.</em></p><p align="justify">Then suddenly, there’s a sound behind him and before Harry knows it his brain is already making him turn around on his heel. The man before him is tall and slim, his hair a mess of nearly white locks, a hateful expression painted on his pale face. He’s wearing a brown vest with a red flannel shirt underneath it and there’s old blood on his khaki trousers. Harry stares and it takes him a second too long to realise that he’s holding a stake too close to Harry’s chest. He comes stumbling back, falling to the forest floor. His breath hitches and he crawls backward as far away as he can before getting to his feet again and facing the man. They’re both breathing fast, Harry’s breath is filled with “<em>shit I almost got killed just now”. </em>There’s fear in his own eyes, too, he realises, and he knows he should seem more intimidating, in hopes of scaring the hunter away but he was just almost impaled on that stupid stick and he’s sure his heart would be racing right now if only it could.</p><p align="justify">“If you leave now I’ll let you keep your life.” Harry says, trying to appear fearless, but his voice is trembling and the human laughs, taking two steps forward.</p><p align="justify">“I’m not afraid of you, monster” and everything happens too fast after those words. The hunter closes the remaining distance between them, reaches out a hand holding the stake and takes a swing at Harry’s chest – but Harry’s movements are faster, more experienced, as he grabs the man’s wrist right before the stake comes in contact with the skin on his torso and bites his forearm.</p><p align="justify">There’s a surprised gasp leaving the human’s mouth as he lets go of the stake and takes a step back, aghast, staring at the bite mark. “No–” his voice is barely above a whisper and Harry grins, pushing his hands into his pockets.</p><p align="justify">“I’m afraid so, my friend,” Harry says, bending down to pick up the abandoned stake, breaking it in half and tossing it behind his back. “Now, I’m gonna tell you what will happen.” The white-haired man looks at him in terror, then back down at his forearm. “You can either try to kill me again, fail <em>miserably </em>and turn into, what was it you called me? Ah, monster. Into a monster” Harry grins even wider, knowing he’s already won and sighs happily, causing the man to look him in the eyes “Or, of course, you could help both of us. See, I’m quite hungry and, frankly–”</p><p align="justify">“No,” he looks determined and Harry wants to roll his eyes. He shakes his head frantically and squeezes his grey eyes shut. “No.”</p><p align="justify">“Fine, then,” Harry shrugs his shoulders and turns to walk away. “Have fun turning into a heartless monster, as that should start in about thirty minutes.” He doesn’t look back but then there’s a quiet whimper behind him and–</p><p align="justify">“Okay” it sounds broken, disappointed and Harry almost feels bad for him before jumping a little in place, like a kid, and walking back toward him</p><p align="justify">“See, it’s not so bad to help sometimes. Now, give me the belt,” Harry points at the man’s belt, at least ten daggers and stakes striped to it. “We don’t wanna risk anything, now, do we?” He’s trying his best to sound intimidating but it’s definitely too hard in his state of excitement. The hunter hands him his belt and Harry throws it as far as possible, considering all the trees in the way.</p><p align="justify">They face each other and then Harry is snatching his wrist, burying his fangs deep into the pale skin and <em>fuck </em>it’s good, so good that he groans, realising how hungry he’d been before. The man hisses in pain but Harry ignores him, shifting closer and holing his elbow with his left hand, sucking the man’s blood until he can feel his body shake a little.</p><p align="justify">Harry pulls away and licks his lips, then grins like a crazy person, while slowly backing away. “Nice meeting you! I’ll see you ‘round!”</p><p align="justify">“I’m gonna get you next time”</p><p align="justify">Harry laughs and turns his back to the hunter. “Keep telling yourself that!”</p><p align="justify">And then he’s gone.</p>
