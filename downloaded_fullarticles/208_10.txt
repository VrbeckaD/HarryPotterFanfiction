  <strong>September 1st</strong>
</p><p>Despite the fact that he was rather tall for an eleven year old, the large, old-fashioned leather trunk that Jack towed behind him was large enough for him to fit into. Struggling to keep up with his guide, he wove in and out of the crowd, and nearly crashed into the big bearded man when he halted suddenly.</p><p>“This is it,” His guide announced in a thick Russian accent.</p><p>The man's name was North, and Jack had only known him for about a week, but that fateful meeting had completely changed Jack's life. Because North was a teacher at a boarding school for special children. <em>Magical</em> children, just like Jack.</p><p>Because Jack was a boy who had been shuffled from foster home to foster home since he was only a toddler and labelled as a 'problem child' for causing mischief that he didn't always have an explanation for. And now, he had a reason for it all, a reason why he'd never quite fit in. And he finally had a place where he would belong: <em>Hogwarts</em>.</p><p>But as he studied the twin trains before him, he couldn't help but feel disappointed by the two sleek aluminium bodies. He wasn't quite sure what he'd been expecting, but he knew that it wasn't that. Modern in design and nearly identical save for the paint job, neither train looked like the type of vehicle to stop at a magical school.</p><p>And for a moment, he had an empty, sinking feeling in his gut, as though expecting his social worker to appear suddenly and ask if he'd finally learned his lesson about playing tricks on people.</p><p>But instead, North gave him a broad grin and gestured to the brick wall between the two platforms. “After you.”</p><p>Jack furrowed his brow, unsure of what North wanted him to look at.</p><p>“Is platform nine and <em>three-quarters</em>,” North said, gesturing to the signs above them that read platform 9 and 10.</p><p>And with a deep breath, Jack stepped forward, stretching out his hand towards the brick wall, half expecting the bricks to jump aside like they had done behind the Leaky Cauldron, when North had taken him to purchase his school supplies several days prior. But where his eyes told his body he should feel the rough texture of the red bricks against his fingertips, he felt only air as his hand vanished into the wall.</p><p>With a sudden gasp of surprise, he grinned and stepped forward, pulling his trunk in its entirety through the magical barrier and onto platform nine and three-quarters.</p><p>His brown eyes wide and his mouth agape, he found himself staring at the big red and black steam engine that sat on the tracks. The <em>Hogwarts Express</em>. It certainly stood apart from every other train at King's Cross Station, in both its' appearance and its' secluded platform. Now <em>this</em> looked like the type of train that stopped at magical schools.</p><p>Trunks just like Jack's were piled up on the platform as train attendants began to load them one by one. Families milled around, mums and dads bidding their children farewell as they boarded the train that would take them to school, going over their checklists one last time and delivering last minute parting gifts.</p><p>“Good luck,” North said, putting a hand on Jack's shoulder. Stooping to bring himself closer to Jack's level, North had an amused look in his cheerful blue eyes as he handed the boy a ticket. “You are staying out of trouble this day, yes?”</p><p>Without waiting for a response, North turned to make his way back towards the gateway to the muggle side of King's Cross Station, immediately vanishing into the crowd, despite his impressive stature and vibrant red cloak.</p><p>Still awestruck, Jack began to make his way towards the train, when suddenly a trolley careened across the platform and crashed into his. His trunk lurched forward, slamming into both him and a pale blonde girl, sending them both sprawling across the train station floor, and completely knocking the breath out of them. The offending trolley veered sideways and toppled over, dumping its’ red-headed rider on the floor amidst all of her luggage and cutting short the girl’s boisterous laughter.</p><p>The click-clack of high heels against tiled floors followed as the girl’s exasperated mother approached. “Och, is it too much to ask for you just to behave, child?”</p><p>“Sorry, mum,” The girl said sheepishly as Jack felt a hand on his arm.</p><p>“C’mon lad, up ye get.” Jack was hoisted to his feet by a bear-like man with a very large nose and very wild red hair. “Are ye alrigh’?”</p><p>Jack nodded, his lungs still aching for breath, and the man turned to offer a hand to the blond girl, but she shrank away from his outstretched hand and fled.</p><p>Looking around, Jack realized that the redhead’s trolley had also crashed into another student, a boy about their age with a mop of brown hair, who seemed to have fared rather less well than Jack had, if the large, tender-looking graze on his cheek was anything to go by.</p><p>As Jack righted his trunk and prepared to board the train, he found himself looking up as snowflakes drifted down all around him. He held out his hand, and grinned. Hogwarts must be a magical place indeed if it could snow <em>inside</em> a train station in <em>September</em>.</p>
<hr/><p>As her mother swiftly repacked the spilled contents of her upended trunk, muttering, the little redhead scrunched up her nose, disappointed by how fleeting the feeling of freedom had been. She'd been intent on catching that freedom, chasing it across the platform on her trolley, before it had whirled sideways and capsized on her, dumping her possessions across the train station's tiled floor.</p><p>“Just look what you've done to your new trousers,” Her mother scolded softly, turning her attention to the large tear across the knee of the girl's new jeans. Slipping her wand out of the inside pocket of her emerald green blazer, Elinor pointed it at her daughter's knee.</p><p>“Don', Ah like them better like tha',” The girl protested, putting her hands over the split in the fabric.</p><p>“Come on now, don't be silly,” Elinor said, gently prying her daughters hands away. “<em>Reparo</em>.”</p><p>With a discreet flick of her wrist, the threads of the fabric stretched out across the girl's knee, like tiny arms reaching towards an outstretched hand. When the threads met in the middle, they began to knit themselves back together, turning the girl's knee from a ruddy pink to white to blue in the span of only a few seconds.</p><p>“Don't pout, Merida,” Elinor said, offering a hand to help her daughter to her feet. When the girl crossed her arms defiantly, her mother frowned and put her hands on her hips. “Up now. You have a train to catch.”</p><p>“C'mon lass, on yer feet.” Her father said, putting one arm around Elinor's waist and extending the other to Merida. “Ah'm sure ye'll get plenty o' new rips an' scuffs once ye get to Hogwarts,”</p><p>“Och, <em>Fergus</em>,” Elinor scolded her husband, shooting him a stern frown.</p><p>As her father shot her a sideways smirk and raised an eyebrow, Merida's frown melted into a giggle, and then a wide grin. In seconds, the girl was back on her feet, and once more at the helm of her trolley, ready to embark on her newest journey: Hogwarts. The girl took a deep breath and set her sights on the train.</p><p>“Mer-” Elinor reached out after the girl, whose unruly, vibrant red locks were no longer contained in her braid, but Fergus took her by the elbow.</p><p>“She'll be alrigh', lass.”</p><p>Elinor gave Fergus a meaningful look, but he just wrapped an arm around her and nodded after their daughter.</p><p>“Let's see her off then, shall we?”</p>
<hr/><p>Brushing his shaggy brown hair out of his eyes with one hand, he began to make his way down the train's corridor, sneaking a quick glance into each cabin as he passed.</p><p>The first compartment was completely obscured by a thick layer of frost on the glass door but the subsequent cabins were visible, several occupied by upperyear students catching up after the long summer and one filled with girls closer to his age. He paused for a moment outside one cabin, occupied only by a brown-haired boy in a blue hoodie, but ultimately decided to continue on his way through the train.</p><p>Slipping from one train carriage into the next, he found himself face to face with a girl who had an abundance of very curly ginger hair in a very large teal and maroon plaid shirt. She seemed almost annoyed when they both sidestepped in the same direction to get by.</p><p>“Sorry – sorry,” He said, his lungs still aching from earlier, when the same girl had accidentally mowed him down on her luggage trolley. They both moved to step to his left again. “Sorry.”</p><p>“<em>There you are</em>!” A girl's squeaky voice interrupted them as a very prim and proper girl with dark hair appeared in the closest doorway and beckoned the redhead inside. “We were starting to wonder where you'd gotten to,”</p><p>“Oh, aye?” The redhead rolled her eyes and gave him a dirty look as she reluctantly stepped around him and made her way into the cabin with the dark haired girl.</p><p>“What was that for?” Hiccup muttered to himself as he moved on down the hallway.</p><p>A few feet later, he finally found the cabin he'd been looking for. Taking a deep breath, he pulled open the door and let himself in.</p><p>“H-hey guys,” Hiccup said, when all eyes turned to him.</p><p>It was Tollak who finally broke the silence, glaring at him through a curtain of greasy blonde hair. “Who let you in?”</p><p>“Well, the door wasn't locked-”</p><p>“Why are you even here?” Snorri asked, frowning as though Hiccup was something unpleasant that Snorri had found stuck to the bottom of his shoe.</p><p>“You know they don't allow squibs at Hogwarts, right?” Runa said, prompting a snicker from Tollak. Although fraternal, the twins were nearly identical, with long, thin faces and white-blonde hair that fell past their shoulders. Runa's preference for braids was often the only way to tell them apart.</p><p>“You know, as it turns out, I'm not a squib after all,” Hiccup said, an edge of snark to his tone as he fumbled in his pockets for a moment, searching for the one that he'd stowed his wand in. “They gave me a wand and everything.”</p><p>He drew it for all to see.</p><p>Twelve and a quarter inches long and made of walnut, the wand was a handsome reddish-brown colour, with darker speckles running the full length, creating a slight scale-like pattern in the wood grain. Several bevelled rings at one end created a smoothly carved handhold for the boy.</p><p>Snorri snorted, and after a second, Tollak and Runa were laughing as well.</p><p>“You know you're supposed to hold it from the <em>other</em> end,” Astrid said, rolling her eyes in annoyance.</p><p>“Right, yea-yes, I know that.” Hiccup grabbed the other end, feeling his cheeks flush pink with embarrassment.</p><p>Now holding his wand properly, he moved to sit down on the bench next to the twins, but Runa pulled one of her feet up onto the free seat.</p><p>“Cool, yeah, no problem. I can stand.” Hiccup shrugged, leaning against the door in an attempt to seem nonchalant, but the door shifted a few inches as it closed under his weight, off-balancing him. Now leaning at an uncomfortable angle that accentuated the ache in his lungs from his earlier trolley accident, he stowed his wand in his pocket and forced a grin. “So. . . Hogwarts, huh?”</p><p>After a prolonged moment of uneasy silence, Astrid rose from her seat.</p><p>For a moment, she just looked down her nose at him as he leaned against the compartment door in his awkward, somewhat painful and forced nonchalance. Normally, he would have moved aside to let her pass, but instead of reacting, he found that his mind had gone frustratingly blank. Astrid raised an eyebrow, and his mind reeled, desperately grasping for something clever to say or do.</p><p>She shrugged at him, with her palms facing upwards and her fingers splayed out. When that didn't seem to get through, she gave a small shake of her head, almost as though silently asking what about the situation he wasn't getting.</p><p>But his brain had fully stalled, and instead of any sort of witty remark or reaction, he found himself just staring up at her like a complete idiot.</p><p>“Are you going to move, or-?” Astrid finalled asked, not offering a second option.</p><p>It took a moment for her words to register. When they did, his cheeks flushed bright red and he ducked his head in embarrassment. His lungs protesting sorely with each movement, he scrambled out of her way. “Right. Yes. Sorry.”</p><p>Astrid rolled her eyes and pulled open the compartment door. As she stepped out into the corridor, the others rose from their seats and made their way towards the door as well.</p><p>“Too many losers in this compartment,” Runa said, roughly shouldering her way past Hiccup.</p><p>And one by one, Runa, Tollak, Snorri and even Flemming – although he at least looked almost sympathetic – filed out of the compartment after Astrid.</p><p>As the others made their way down the corridor and out of sight, Hiccup sighed, and sat, disappointed, by himself in the abandoned compartment.</p>
<hr/><p>Most full of enchanted sweets and enthusiasm, and some with tummies filled only by apprehension and nerves, children and teenagers alike filed off the Hogwarts Express. Returning students chattered energetically with their friends after the long summer, and the first years looked every which way with wide eyes, eagerly trying to take in all the sights and smells and sounds of the brand new world that they were all venturing into for the first time.</p><p>Jack was no different than his peers, brimming with curiosity and wonder.</p><p>“First years!” A burly, bearded man called out across the platform. “You are coming this way to Hogwarts!”</p><p>Jack perked up, recognizing the man's guttural accent. Half-grinning, Jack made his way towards him. He was curious to find out how North had beaten the train back to Hogwarts.</p><p>By the time Jack made his way across the emptying platform and reached North, he had been joined by several other first year students, including a girl with straight black hair and stripey red and black stockings that were visible below her robes.</p><p>North caught Jack's eye and nodded a greeting as the boy gave him a wave. But before North had a chance to speak, the dark-haired girl with the stripey stockings tugged at the sleeve of North's bright red robe to get his attention.</p><p>“Hey mister,” The girl asked. “What happens when we get to Hogwarts?”</p><p>“At Hogwarts, you are wearing sorting hat,” North said, ruffling her hair with one hand. “It tells you house.”</p><p>“And what if. . .” Another girl began, her voice cracking as she realized that everyone was now looking at her, and momentarily flinching under the weight of their attention. Her pale blonde hair tied back in a tight braid, she fidgeted with one of her blue gloves and Jack vaguely recognized her as the girl who he'd bumped into at Kings Cross Station, right before it had begun snowing. After a moment, she seemed to find the nerve to speak again, although her voice was timid and barely a whisper. “What if it doesn't give you a house? What if you don't belong anywhere?”</p><p>Jack's stomach lurched as though the ground had dropped away from under him. He hadn't even considered that as a possibility. What if the hat didn't sort him anywhere at all? Would they send him home? He felt a shiver down his spine at the thought of being told they'd made a mistake and that he would have to return to his muggle foster family.</p><p>North's face softened, and he got down on one knee in front of the nervous girl. He reached out to put a comforting hand on her shoulder, but when she seemed to shy from his touch, he instead propped his elbow on his own knee. “Every one of you has something very special inside, and the sorting hat, it knows this! If you are here, you belong.”</p><p>Nodding mutely, the girl seemed satisfied by North's answer. Jack let out a breath he hadn't even realized he'd been holding, and noticed that other students around him seemed to be doing the same. Jack hadn't been the only one frightened by the idea of being turned away from Hogwarts.</p><p>Taking a quick glance across the platform to see if anyone had been missed, North gave a nod and began to lead them all down to the lakeshore.</p>
<hr/><p>She stared, awestruck, at the silhouettes of the tiny rowboats clustered along the stoney shores, bobbing in the moonlight beneath the magnificent medieval castle that served as its backdrop. The cloudless night had speckled countless stars across the glassy surface of the Black Lake, almost giving an inviting appeal to its inky and mysterious depths.</p><p>Excitement buzzed about her, and she chewed on her lower lip, trying to take the whole scene in all at once. It was September First, and she was finally eleven years old. Tower for tower and peak for peak, it matched exactly the photograph that she'd found in one of mother's books. And it was an image that she wanted to remember for the rest of her life.</p><p>She was so mesmerized by the landscape that the soft scrape and click of a door handle behind her caught her completely off guard, and she dropped her paintbrush, violet paint splashing her bare toes as the brush bounced against the stone floor.</p><p>“Honestly, Rapunzel, how many times do I have to-” The newcomer chided, stopping short when she laid eyes on the newest painting on the girl's bedroom wall. For a moment, she seemed to roll her eyes, before recollecting her thoughts. “How many times do I have to call you?”</p><p>“Sorry, Mother,” Rapunzel said, her excitement unwavering. “I was painting,”</p><p>“Yes, I can see that,” Mother said, unimpressed as she shrugged her black wool cloak from her shoulders. “I just don't understand why you waste so much time with all of this.”</p><p>She waved a dismissive hand towards the painting, and turned away.</p><p>“Sorry, Mother,” Rapunzel repeated, her smile faltering for half a second before she sprang into action. Following her mother out into the main living area of their small stone cottage, her mother handed her the cloak. Quickly but carefully, the child moved to hang the cloak in their coat closet. “I'm just excited, today is a pretty big day-”</p><p>“Please, Rapunzel,” Mother cut her off. “It's been a long day, Mother's tired.”</p><p>“Of course,” Rapunzel said, bobbing her head and hurrying off to the kitchenette to fill the big cast iron kettle with water. As her mother paused by the floor length mirror to fluff her thick black curls, Rapunzel set the kettle on the hook at the top of the big sandstone fireplace and stoked the coals beneath it.</p><p>As Rapunzel began to bustle around the room, fetching cups and tea leaves and sugar, her mother remained by the mirror, using her hands to smooth her deep red robe. On her way past, Rapunzel paused a moment, studying herself as she stood next to her mother, her own waist-length golden hair and green eyes a sharp contrast to mother's ebony curls and silver-grey eyes. They hardly looked a thing alike.</p><p>“Remember, frowning gives you crow's feet.” Mother's melodic voice snapped Rapunzel back to reality and she bobbed her head in acknowledgement, before moving to set the tea tray on a side table. She turned her attention to pulling up mother's favourite chair, a large, heavy mahogany throne with velvet cushions, up to the fireplace.</p><p>Mother made her way to the regal-looking chair, pausing for a moment as Rapunzel fluffed the wine-coloured cushions then ducked out of the way to fetch the kettle, which had begun to whistle.</p><p>At last, Rapunzel appeared at her mother's side with the tea, pressing a porcelain cup into her mother's grasp with such gusto that she nearly spilled it into her lap. Settling on the floor at her mother's feet, she turned her attention back to her big question. “So as I was saying, it's a pretty big day today, September first.”</p><p>“Yes, and there was a September first last year too. And the year before that. And the year before that as well.”</p><p>“But it's not just <em>any</em> year, Mother, it's September first of the year I turned <em>eleven</em>.” When Mother said nothing, Rapunzel put her hands on her mother's knee, almost pleading with her. “I'm old enough to go to Hogwarts!”</p><p>Mother furrowed her brow. “You want to go to Hogwarts?”</p><p>“I've been dreaming about going to Hogwarts for <em>years</em>,” Rapunzel said, near breathless with exhilaration. “I've been reading about it for as long as I can remember,”</p><p>“Hogwarts really isn't a place for you,”</p><p>“Mother, I've read so much about-”</p><p>“Rapunzel, do be reasonable-”</p><p>“But I really think if-”</p><p>“Rapunzel.” Mother's tone had taken on a sharpness that Rapunzel knew better than to cross. Mother regarded her for a moment, then softened, gently stroking her cheek with two fingers. “If you were a witch, Hogwarts would have sent you an invitation.”</p><p>“Oh.”</p>
<hr/><p>The air was abuzz with excitement as the first years climbed the steps from the boathouse and into the main part of the school. Some of the students seemed rather awestruck by the magnificent castle, whispering and pointing excitedly to things as they passed, while others seemed more interested in which houses they thought they would be sorted into.</p><p>Walking two-by-two as they reached the top of the stairs, the big professor with the Russian accent paused for a moment to let some of the stragglers catch up, before leading them into a room lit by torches mounted on the walls that sparked to life as they came into sight.</p><p>At the other end of the hall, a stout man with a greying handlebar moustache awaited them with a large roll of parchment.</p><p>“I'll take it from here, North.”</p><p>The big Russian professor – North – nodded and turned to address them. “Good luck!”</p><p>And with a final wave, he carried on through the final stone archway, his scarlet robes swishing as he turned the corner and vanished from view.</p><p>The man with the handlebar moustache looked familiar, but Merida couldn't quite place where she'd seen him before, until he cleared his throat loudly to get their attention, and the girl beside her called out to him.</p><p>“Father!”</p><p>To her left, Ivory Grimm was waving excitedly, her perfect ebony curls bouncing with the vigour of her greeting. It was probably the most bold and exuberant that Merida had ever seen Ivory, who was timid and shy by nature, with picture perfect manners that Merida's mother had always tried to encourage her to emulate.</p><p>Professor Grimm went a bit red at the sight, and he nodded stiffly to his daughter before clearing his throat again – this time to shush her. As the girl dropped her hand at her side, Professor Grimm took a step forward.</p><p>“Welcome to Hogwarts. My name is professor Grimm, and I am the Deputy Headmaster of Hogwarts. You will follow me in single file. When I call your name, you will come to the front of the hall, where the Sorting Hat will be placed on your head. It will assign you to a house, and you will join your classmates. Is that clear?” He didn't wait for a response. “Very good, now follow me.”</p><p>And with that, Professor Grimm lead them into the Great Hall, which was set up with four long tables that stretched lengthwise down the hall with benches on both sides, populated by students from each of the four houses. A fifth table stood up on the dais, with the staff of Hogwarts seated on the far side, watching as the newest crop of Hogwarts students awaited their fates.</p><p>Professor Grimm left them to stand along the side, by far end of the teacher's table, and moved to stand next to a small wooden stool with a very large, very well-worn old witches' hat sitting on it. For a moment, the room was silent, and then the hat twitched and from one of the folds that somewhat resembled a mouth, the Sorting Hat began to sing.</p><p align="center">
  <em>'For centuries this has been my station,</em><br/>
<em>to the four houses is my obligation,</em><br/>
<em>to clearly see what lies within,</em><br/>
<em>each student, be they foe or friend.</em><br/>
<em>To honour the founders of Hogwarts School,</em><br/>
<em>and maintain the tradition of an ancient rule.</em><br/>
<em>From Gryffindor who took pride in nerve;</em><br/>
<em>the chivalrous and brave they do preserve;</em><br/>
<em>To Hufflepuff who prized the fair;</em><br/>
<em>to be diligent and loyal they do take care.</em><br/>
<em>To Ravenclaw whose great mind did soar;</em><br/>
<em>Renown for wit and imagination evermore.</em><br/>
<em>To Slytherin, whose ingenuity reaped reward;</em><br/>
<em>where ambition and fraternity are always adored.</em><br/>
<em>To sort each student in a house of four;</em><br/>
<em>A Hogwarts tradition, forevermore.'</em>
</p><p>After the Sorting Hat's song, Professor Grimm unfurled his long roll of parchment and began to call out names. One by one, they were sorted into one of the four houses, and the lineup began to grow shorter.</p><p>A blond girl wearing blue gloves, “Delle, Elsa”, made her way to the front of the room, fidgeting with the sleeve of her robe as she went. She grimaced as she took her place on the wooden stool, gripping the edges as though she expected to fall off.</p><p>After a moment, the hat announced her as a '<em>Hufflepuff</em>!'</p><p>Shortly after came a girl with black and red striped stockings, “Dracul, Mavis,” who became the newest member of '<em>Gryffindor!'</em></p><p>And then, Professor Grimm called for “DunBroch, Merida,”</p><p>Grinning, she hurried across the hall towards the stool and took a seat, her abundance of bright ginger curls bouncing with every step. She crinkled her nose as Professor Grimm placed the sorting hat upon her mess of curls.</p><p>And nearly jumped out of her skin when a voice spoke in her ear.</p><p>'<em>Where should I put you?'</em> Her face flushed very red when she realized that the hat was speaking to her. '<em>There is certainly determination in you and a sense of independence too. But what's this? Raw nerve and an instinct for self-preservation that is second to none...I know-</em>'</p><p>'<em>Slytherin!</em>'</p><p>While Slytherin hadn't been either of her parents' houses, she was not disappointed. The entirety of Slytherin house was cheering so loudly for their newest member that she couldn't resist grinning as she made her way to join their table.</p>
<hr/><p>Jack's fingers and toes were tingling with excitement, and with each name that Professor Grimm called, the tingling feeling spread, expanding into his hands and feet, and eventually his chest too.</p><p>And then, finally: “Frost, Jack,”</p><p>The moment of truth had arrived.</p><p>As Jack made his way to the front of the room, he found Professor Grimm's scrutinizing glare studying him. The professor seemed to hesitate for half a second, before he placed the hat atop Jack's messy brown hair.</p><p>'<em>Well now, you're a tricky one, aren't you?</em>' Jack grinned as he heard the hat's voice in his ear. '<em>Nerve</em><em>, certainly, but daring, </em><em>yes, you could do well in Gryffindor, you know. Although</em><em>, </em><em>there's</em> <em>kindness and </em><em>loyalty </em><em>here too</em><em>, </em><em>and</em> <em>a </em><em>craving for fraternity </em><em>that you would do best not to ignore. P</em><em>erhaps... </em><em>Yes. I think it'd better be</em><em>-'</em></p><p><em>'</em> <em>Hufflepuff!'</em></p><p>With a grin, he hopped off the wooden stool and handed the hat back to Professor Grimm as Hufflepuff table erupted with cheers. Jack felt warmth wash over him as he made his way to the table, which didn't settle until after Jack had taken his seat.</p>
<hr/><p>Hiccup had butterflies, and they seemed to become more and more frenzied with each name that was called for sorting. He'd been fidgeting with the sleeve of his robes with such intense trepidation that he'd already pulled two threads loose, and was already working at a third. Not that he'd realized he was tearing a hole in the sleeve of his brand new school uniform, he was so focused on the sorting ceremony that he wouldn't even have noticed a troll attack if there had been one right behind him.</p><p>He wasn't sure which house he thought he'd be sorted into. He wasn't even sure which house he wanted to be sorted into. He'd read about them all, and they all had great wizards and witches of notoriety. He was sure he could be one of them, just given the chance. He could be great – no, he <em>would</em> be great. One day.</p><p>But which house was he hoping for? Which house would make his dad the most proud? Gryffindor, he was sure, as Gryffindor had been his father's house when he'd been a student at Hogwarts. But Hiccup had read about Hogwarts, and he wasn't entirely sure he fit the bill for his father's house. He was scrawny and clumsy and nearly a squib, hardly Gryffindor material.</p><p>He hoped they hadn't made a mistake. It tied his stomach up in knots just thinking about it, thinking about being turned away from Hogwarts.</p><p>“Haldor, Hindrick.”</p><p>His chest felt tight, as though someone had wrapped a very large rubber band around his middle and wouldn't let him draw breath.</p><p>And for a moment, he was frozen, like a deer in headlights.</p><p>“Haldor, Hindrick.” Professor Grimm repeated, his words clipped and curt.</p><p>And then Hiccup was almost to the wooden stool before his brain had even registered that he was in motion. As he approached the wooden stool, Professor Grimm glared down at him, making a mental note to assign extra homework to the troublesome, disobedient boy who didn't come when called.</p><p>And then, like that, the patchy old hat was on his head.</p><p>“Please be Gryffindor, please be Gryffindor,” Hiccup whispered, closing his eyes as the hat drooped low over his face.</p><p>'<em>Interesting</em><em>,</em>' The hat said, and Hiccup caught his breath. '<em>A thirst to prove yourself and a resourceful mind</em><em> – that would certainly be </em><em>well</em><em> appreciated in </em><em>Slytherin</em><em>.</em>'</p><p>“Please be Gryffindor,” Hiccup repeated, a lump welling up in his throat. “I want to be like my dad.”</p><p>'<em>Well, y</em><em>ou </em><em>certainly seem to share Godric's – a</em><em>s well as</em> <em>Sten</em><em>'s – tendency for obstinacy. But you also </em><em>have </em><em>creativity aplenty, and wit unmatched</em><em>.</em> <em>Despite what you crave, </em><em>I think you'll find that s</em><em>ome</em><em>where</em><em> else may suit you just as well-'</em></p><p>'<em>Ravenclaw!</em>'</p><p>Hiccup's face fell. Grimm lifted the hat off the boy's head and shooed him away to his table, preparing to call the next child to be sorted. Despite the cheers of his new housemates, Hiccup was apprehensive. But the hat had said that he was like his father, hadn't it? So why hadn't it put him in Gryffindor? Wasn't the hat supposed to take's a person's choice into account?</p>
<hr/><p>With a deep sigh, Rapunzel stared up at the indigo and violet painting on her bedroom wall. She'd been sitting cross-legged below it for nearly an hour, and it was well past her bedtime but she couldn't sleep. She'd been so excited to go to Hogwarts, and since the closest she was ever going get to Hogwarts was her painting, she couldn't help but staring longingly at it. She wanted so badly to be there, to be at the magnificent castle with other kids her own age.</p><p>She was so focused on the painting that it almost seemed to come to life in the darkness, the tiny wooden boats bobbing up and down in the moonlit water, stars twinkling in the dark night sky.</p><p>And then, all at once, she realized the boats were moving. She blinked, then rubbed her eyes in case they were just playing tricks on her in the darkness, but the boats kept bobbing up and down in the inky dark waves. She reached for her candle, which lit on its' own the moment she touched it.</p><p>Green eyes wide, she sprinted to her mother's room.</p><p>“Mother!” Rapunzel called, barely able to contain her excitement as she knocked on her mother's door. “Mother, are you awake?”</p><p>The door hinge creaked as Rapunzel pushed the door open, and her mother stirred, peeling back her wine-coloured eye mask with a reproachful look.</p><p>“Rapunzel, what are you doing out of bed at this hour?” Mother asked sharply. “Go back to bed-”</p><p>“But the candle – it lit – all on its' own!”</p><p>“It did what?”</p><p>“It lit. All on its' own! And the boats are floating!” Rapunzel told her, near breathless with exhilaration. “What if I <em>am</em> a witch after all? And what if Hogwarts did send me a letter and it just got lost on the way here?”</p><p>“That's a lot of what ifs.”</p><p>“But it could happen, I'm sure, a letter getting lost. With all those students that they have to send letters to, it makes sense that one or two could get misplaced. So I could be a witch. My painting is moving, and I lit the candle-”</p><p>“You're rambling, Rapunzel.” Mother said. “Go back to bed.”</p><p>“But mother-” Rapunzel said, grasping her mother's hands. “What if my letter just got lost?”</p><p>“It didn't.” Mother said, very matter-of-fact. “They would have kept writing until they received a response. They're <em>very</em> insistent.”</p><p>“But what about the candle-”</p><p>“The candle is charmed. It's <em>supposed</em> to light on its' own.”</p><p>“And my painting? It <em>moves</em>, mother!”</p><p>“You're just imagining things. It's very late, Rapunzel, well past your bedtime.” Mother said, giving her a stern look. “And Mother needs her beauty sleep.”</p><p>“But I'm absolutely <em>positive</em> that I saw it move, mother. Come on, I'll show you.”</p><p>And with that Rapunzel grabbed her mother's hand and pulled her out of bed, but not without earning an irritated frown from her mother. But Rapunzel was certain that she'd seen the painting move. She'd never been more certain of anything in her life.</p><p>But despite her certainty, there was still a nagging what if in the back of her mind as she lead her mother to the painting. What if mother was right, and her eyes were playing tricks on her? What if she was just imagining things that weren't there? Her fear that quickly turned into a suffocating sense of grief as they stood in front of the painting, and not a single brushstroke moved. No stars twinkled, no rowboats bobbed, no water rippled, <em>nothing</em>.</p><p>“What exactly am I looking for?” Mother asked, raising an eyebrow at Rapunzel expectantly.</p><p>Rapunzel winced, and drew a shaky breath, willing herself not to cry.</p><p>Mother continued. “I don't see anything moving. Do you?”</p><p>“No.” Rapunzel felt an ache in her chest as she stared at the still painting. Her throat tight with despair, and tears stinging her eyes, she couldn't do more than whisper. “But I was <em>so</em> sure.”</p><p>“Hogwarts only sends invitation letters to witches, my flower. And you're nothing but a squib. Now go back to bed.”</p>
