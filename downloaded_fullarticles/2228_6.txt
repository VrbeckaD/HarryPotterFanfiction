    <p>“How come mom and dad put you in charge?” Thirteen years old Lily Luna Potter inquired as she stood at the end of the couch her brothers, James Sirius and some of the others were occupying, as they all watched a movie, whilst their parents had a Christmas dinner to attend.<br/>“I’m seventeen and you’re thirteen, without Teddy, Vic, and Dom, I am the oldest, and I can do magic outside of school.” <br/>“He is also the only person Al will listen to outside of your parents, aunts, and uncles.” Fifteen years old Scorpius teased his boyfriend from the floor, who retaliated by sticking his tongue out. When Albus retreated his tongue, Scorpius placed a quick peck on his lips. <br/>“Get a room.” Alice Longbottom II said jokingly, throwing a pillow at them. <br/>“Like you can talk, Ali, my brain is still scarred from yours and Freddy’s alone time in the closet. I don’t think that’s how the head boy and head girl are supposed to act.” Ariana Thomas-Finnigan voiced, prompting Augusta Longbottom II, Alice’s twin sister, to laugh and Fred and Alice to blush profoundly. <br/>“Hey. I haven’t mentioned to Professor McGonagoal that you were out of bed to duel Angelica McLaggen.” Alice responded, still blushing. <br/>“Are we...not watching the movie anymore?” Albus asked. <br/>“Probably not.” Scorpius answered. <br/>“Again, Ari? What is that, three times?” Roxanne asked from the other side of the large room. <br/>“No.” She looked away from everyone. “That time was the fourth. She...” She ran a hand over her arm, covered by a sweater sleeve. “It’s nothing.” At everyone’s disbelieving looks, she continued, “I promise.” <br/>Ari noticed something around Lily’s neck that continued down the inside of her shirt. <br/>“Hey, Lils, what’s that?” <br/>“Oh. This.” She grabbed at the chain but didn’t remove the hidden part from her shirt. “My parents hide our Christmas presents in his office and I found mine.” She brought it out fully and Rose, who was sitting next to Lily, gasped. <br/>“LILY, WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?!” She exclaimed. <br/>“What?” <br/>“What’s that?” Hugo asked. <br/>“It’s a time turner.” Rose explained. “Give it here.” The fifteen years old demanded. Lily took it off in a hurry and gave it to Rose, who examined it. <br/>“Could I see?” Ari asked. <br/>Rose agreed. <br/>“But we have to put it back immediately after.” <br/>-<br/>It was not put away immediately after. Everyone wanted to see it up close. <br/>Rose put her foot down when it came back to Lily. <br/>“Alright, Lily, give it here.” <br/>Without thinking, Lily tossed it and watched in horror as the necklace fell right through Rose’s fingers, falling to the ground and breaking. <br/>Golden dust surrounded the room. <br/>They all tried to run but the dust took some of them before anyone could move and pushed everyone else back. <br/>When Lily Luna Potter came back up and looked around, she had two thoughts; one, James, Fred, Ari, and Alice were missing, and two, her parents were gonna kill her.</p>
