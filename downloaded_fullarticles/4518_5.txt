    <p>On Hallowed Grounds A Darkling Mask Speaks<br/>
</p><p>I Can Feel Your Presence Amongst Us<br/>
-oo00oo-</p>
<p>Grunting, James Potter tried not to stumble as he followed Albus down to the basement of number 12 Grimmauld place. After four solid years of battling, with losses on both sides, the war against The Dark Lord had been won. Voldemort, the former Slytherin graduate Tom Marvolo Riddle, was dead, his corpse entombed in the Department of Mysteries. The wizarding world was lit with celebration, fire works, jubilation, and parades. Inside of the hidden location of the Order of the Phoenix, however, the mood was distinctly tense. </p>
<p>Though the Dark Lord was dead, and many of his followers captured and set to stand trial, they were still missing some of their numbers. In the last siege before the final battle, Sirius Black, Severus Snape, Bill Weasley and Draco Malfoy had been captured and secured in a location known only by the Dark Lord and Mamba, the demonic son of Voldemort. </p>
<p>They had experienced a score of luck, however, after the death of Voldemort, Mamba had fallen at his sire’s side and hadn’t offered much resistance when James and his partner, Remus Lupin, had shackled him and apparated him to their quarters. Now, after leaving the man to sit in a cell for 16 hours, unfed, unwatered and unlit, they were going to question him. They hoped that he would cooperate, even if he had been mysteriously silent since his capture. </p>
<p>Shaking his head, James tried to suppress his nerves. He knew, logically, that Mamba was just a teenager, young, barely older than his son, but he couldn’t help the tremble of unease that spawned from the superstition surrounding the man. Six years ago, when Voldemort began his guerilla warfare attacks, the first sighting of Mamba had been reported. </p>
<p>Six years ago James had taken his squadron on a civilian call in Diagon Alley. There had been emergency calls from civilians claiming sightings of suspected Death Eater activity. James had taken two young aurors with him to investigate the claims while making sure to send word to Dumbledore. Once in the Alley they had managed to discreetly meet up with with devout Order member, Remus Lupin. James had been clearing away rubble from a destroyed building when he spotted the child.</p>
<p>Mamba had been slight, lean and silent as well as efficient and deadly. He had followed behind the robust form of Fenrir Greyback, a silent spectre shrouded in an Avada Kedavra green coat. The Order had stumbled when he’d first been spotted, terrified that the Dark Lord had captured a child. When they had sent Nymphadora Tonks to help the child while Remus distracted Greyback, they had thought of nothing but saving the child.<br/>

</p><p>It had been their first mistake with Mamba. Tonks had crept up on the child from the side, wand down and attempting to quietly assure him of her good intentions. The boy had turned to her, hood up, hands folded inside his sleeves, a gleam of a smile greeted her as she drew close enough to reach out to him. She never even had a chance to scream, when James had looked up to assess her progress he had frozen in horror. </p>
<p>The child had thrown his hood back, black hair fell around his ears, moon pale skin glowing in the early morning light as he stood over the fallen body of Tonks. The child held a bloody blade in his hand, his other hand wrapped tightly in the fallen womans’ hair. Remus had screamed, his distraction leaving an opening for Fenrir to rip his claws down his back before sprinting away. James had enough thought to not drop the rubble he had been levitating before running to his fallen ally. </p>
<p>The child had stepped back, dagger positioned dangerously close to his mouth as he watched James fall to his knees at Tonks’ side. Checking her pulse, James tried not to look at the gaping slash across her throat as he vainly sought out her heartbeat. James had looked up at the boy and felt his own heart stop, the child was dragging his tongue up the side of the dagger, lapping the blood like a monster as he watched James with glowing green eyes. </p>
<p>Even six years later, James sometimes woke from nightmares where those eyes stared up at him as he crouched over the fallen bodies of his loved ones. Losing Tonks had been rough on them, Remus in particular. The werewolf had thrown himself into the Order, going on missions for weeks, sometimes months at a time. Tonks had only been 20, just out of training, and madly in love with their resident sandy haired Gryffindor.</p>
<p>Shaking away his trek down memory lane, James brought his attention back to the moment, forcing the tremor in his hands to stop. Albus held himself regally, his towering height often made their enemies slip, if not for this then his sterling reputation as the most powerful wizard in the word certainly made them falter.</p>
<p>Albus stroked his beard, turning to face them in front of the door that separated them from the prisoner holding. The unease in James’ gut twisted uncomfortably, Remus practically vibrated with impatience at his side. </p>
<p>Smiling gently, Albus folded his hands behind his beard, shoulders stretching broadly. “I want you gentlemen to allow me to take the lead. I am aware of your history with our <i>guest</i>, but I ask you for patience. Lily and Charlie will be along briefly to assist us. I am hoping that, failing our attempts at reasoning with the young man, their softer touch will open him up to our viewpoint.”</p>
<p>James pulled himself taller, noticing Remus doing the same out of the corner of his eye, the friends bit a bitter smile at each other, taking a moment to breathe before facing the boy that killed their colleague. They murmured their agreement to Dumbledore, bodies rigid and faces falling blank. </p>
<p>Smiling slightly, Albus turned and pushed his way into the room, James and Remus at his heels. Albus lit the torches in the room with a slight wave of his hand, James had to force himself to keep a straight face. Wandless casting was a good assertion of dominance. </p>
<p>Their prisoner sat small cell, there was no cot, no toilet, no sink and no window in the cell, just stone walls and a barred doorway. The young man sat naked, criss-cross in the center of the floor, eyes closed and body relaxed. They had stripped him of his wand, weapons and clothing before throwing him into the cell, and in spite of that he appeared careless. </p>
<p>The three men took a moment to stare at the child’s body in silent horror. He was covered in scars and tattoos, there wasn’t an untouched inch on the boy’s body, even the soles of his feet were tattooed in a barrage of swirling line work. Swallowing down his disgust and sympathy, James flanked Albus’ right side while Remus took the left.</p>
<p>Albus smiled benevolently at the boy, eyes sweeping over the marks with curiosity. “Hello child, do you know who I am?”</p>
<p>The boy lifted his head, green eyes locked intently on Dumbledore’s blue. The young man cocked his head, a small, wicked smile curling at the corners of his mouth. “Professor Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, a pleasure.” The boy nodded his head in greeting, the picture of charm. </p>
<p>Dumbledore smiled wider, shoulders relaxing. “The pleasure is all mine. Might I ask your name?”</p>
<p>The boy wiggled his shoulders, body serpentine, with a roll of his back he sprang to his feet, seemingly unconcerned with his nudity. “I believe your little group knows me as Mamba. I assume it is a shorthand for Black Mamba,  I am quite fond of that.”</p>
<p>“Yes, we have referred to you as Mamba, but I would like to know your given name.”</p>
<p>Mamba stood right up against the bars of the cell, hands curling around the bars. “You do not know it already? Here I always thought you had Severus Snape in your pocket.”</p>
<p>“Are you saying Severus knows who you are?”</p>
<p>“Oh, yes.”</p>
<p>Blinking at the bluntness, Albus cut his eyes at James, a clear signal for the auror to bring his own skillset to the interrogation. James cleared his throat, taking a miniscule step forward to grab the attention of the young man. “As pleasant as this conversation is, we need your cooperation. We are prepared to offer you a deal of a lesser sentence on behalf of the Ministry. If you cooperate you won’t be sentenced to the Kiss, and if you are particularly helpful, you may even avoid a life sentence in Azkaban. Are you prepared to comply with our investigation?”</p>
<p>Mamba appeared to be amused, his eyes seemed to gleam with humor as he stared at the bespectacled man. “What particular information do you seek Mr. Potter?”</p>
<p>Rearing back, James couldn’t hide his shock. Knowing Dumbledore wasn’t a surprise, all of the wizarding world knew Albus. Knowing him, though, was a surprise. It confirmed that someone had been feeding information back to Voldemort. In public, James denounced the Order of the Phoenix, making sure his ties with the organization and Dumbledore weren’t known by anyone not in the Order. </p>
<p>Forcing himself to remain on task, James took another step closer, ever vigilant to stay out of arm's reach of the boy. “Where did Voldemort keep his captives?”</p>
<p>“Captives? Oh, you mean those delightful little playthings he gave me?”</p>
<p>“Where is the encampment?”</p>
<p>Mamba seemed to consider the question, eyes locked on James, much like his namesake. Refusing to blink, James ignored the arrival of his wife and the second oldest Weasley child. “Hmm, a reduced sentence and no death sentence? Is there something else you can offer to sweeten the pot? This is valuable information you seek.”</p>
<p>Growling low in his throat, Remus surged forward with a snarl. “You don’t deserve anything <i>sweeter<b> Death Eater scum</b></i>!”</p>
<p>James reached out to yank Remus away from the cell, leary of the hungry look on the young captive’s face. “Remus, stand down!”</p>
<p>Snarling, Remus ripped himself away and crossed his arms. “I say we torture the information out of him. It’s what his <i>dear father</i> would do.”</p>
<p>“Remus!”</p>
<p>“Then again, his father is dead, isn’t he?” Smiling cruelly, Remus stalked forward again, eyes glowing a werewolf yellow. “We killed him. Shot him down and then slit his throat while you stood by and <i>watched</i>, helpless. How does it feel, scum, to be an orphan? How did it to feel to stand over the corpse of your father, bathed in his blood?”</p>
<p>Mamba stared back, eyes hard and mouth drawn. James felt a twinge sorrow. Mamba may be a murderer and the son of a Dark Lord, but he was still a child. It felt cruel to rub the death of his father in his face. Mamba was silent for a moment, staring into the eyes of Remus with a cool composure. A composure that began to crack as the boy began to laugh. </p>
<p>Throwing his head back, Mamba tore his hands away from the cell bars, body shuddering with his laughter. Shocked, Remus stepped back, hands trembling with anger. Mamba continued to laugh, body shaking as he reveled in his mirth. “Oh Salazar, father told me that you all would be hilariously inefficient, but he did not tell me how generally <i>amusing</i> you would all be!”</p>
<p>Giggling, Mamba stepped flush with the bars, body pressed obscenely against doorway. James averted his eyes, heat rising in his cheeks. He noticed Lily covering her eyes, disgust on her face. Charlie looked shocked, cheeks stained the same red as James’. “Oh, you sweet, naive werewolf. Did you honestly think bringing up the death of my father would reduce me to tears? Is that how your side responds? Despair in the face of tragedy? How very quaint.”</p>
<p>Mamba brushed his hand across his neck, eyes locking on Charlie’s from across the room. Smiling, the teen drew his hand down across his chest and paused at his thighs, fingers curling suggestively. James heard Charlie whimper, turning toward his younger friend, James watched the shock and disgust warring with lust on the redhead’s face. </p>
<p>“If you are looking to make me stumble, I am afraid you will have to find another avenue. I may love my father passionately and completely, but I do not mourn his death.” Smiling, Mamba ran his fingers back up to his neck, eyes never leaving Charlie’s. “My father was a brilliant wizard, and he worked for a goal. His demise was avoidable. Arrogance should never interfere with a goal.”  </p>
<p>Dumbledore seemed to sag, his body still strong, but something about Mamba’s speech seemed to depress him somehow. Sparing a questioning glance at Albus, James forced himself to turn back to the imprisoned teen. Keeping his eyes steadily locked on the teen’s face, James steeled himself to step forward again. “Let’s cut to the core of things here <i>Mamba</i>. You give us the location of our people, and we will see about a probationary based sentence due to your age.”</p>
<p>Shifting his attention to James, Mamba pressed two fingers against his lips, somehow making the simple gesture obscene. “Well that seems like a delightfully horrible agreement. I accept!” Cackling, Mamba curled his finger at James.</p>
<p>Against his better judgement, ignoring the protests of his wife and peers, James stepped closer to their prisoner. Swallowing down his nerves, James stopped within a hairsbreadth of the cell and the teen inside. Quick as the snake he was named after, Mamba snatched a fistful of the auror’s robes. James yelped as he slammed face first into the bars of the cell. Mamba’s face was pressed close, their noses touched in a disturbingly intimate way. </p>
<p>Shouts from the room had James waving his hand, signaling his friends to stay back. Mamba licked his lips, hands surprisingly strong as he held James in place. “Paddington Old Cemetery, Merlin’s Plot.” Stretching forward, Mamba pressed a soft kiss against the older man’s nose. “Best be quick little stag, they will not last much longer.”</p>
<p>Laughing in James’ face, Mamba shoved the auror back and finally stepped away from the bars. “Run, run little stag.”</p>
<p>Fighting back the want to question Mamba further, and about the ‘stag’ comment, James grasped blindly for his wife and followed Charlie and Remus out of the dungeon of number 12 Grimmauld place.</p>
<p>-oo00oo-</p>
<p>They hit the ground running, after apparating to Paddington Old Cemetery, they ran toward Merlin’s Plot, each of them disillusioned to the muggles mulling around the burial ground. Lily’s hand held his with the strength he’d always admired in his wife. Remus was ahead of them, his lithe body wove between tombstones in a strong imitation of his wolf counterpart. </p>
<p>Running through the archway that separated the muggle cemetery from the wizarding one, James shouted as he nearly crashed into Remus’ frozen frame. </p>
<p>“Oh Merlin.” Lily dropped his hand, hands coming up to cover her mouth. James felt lightheaded. Merlin’s Plot was in ruins. The Slytherin Mausoleum, the crowning feature of Old Paddington Cemetery, was the only structure left standing. The other three founder mausoleums were completely destroyed.</p>
<p>Shaking off his shock, James signaled for Remus and Charlie to flank him as he began to approach the last standing structure. “Lily, stay back, we may need you if there are traps.”</p>
<p>Lily nodded, mouth drawn tight as she stayed behind. James took a deep breath, he reached for the door, body going rigid as he encountered no locks, no traps, no deterrents. Sparing a nervous glance at Remus, James nodded his head, wand at the ready, and pulled the door open. They didn’t have to go very far, half of the mausoleum had been transfigured into a cell. The four missing members of the Order looked a little rough but otherwise unharmed. </p>
<p>Their cell was large enough for four beds and some leg space, along with a sink and toilet and what appeared to be a magically replenishing food source on a small table. James felt his heart swell at the sight of his brother, unharmed, alive, bickering with Snape. Taking an abortive step forward, James breathed out a soft “Sirius”, nearly laughing when the man in question whipped toward him fast enough to snap his neck. </p>
<p>“Prongs? <b>PRONGS!</b>” Laughing, James took off at a run, barely managing to stop himself from slamming into the cell bars as he reached for his friend. Sirius clasped his arms, forehead resting against the bars as they laughed. “Prongs. Merlin dammed, took you long enough brother.”</p>
<p>“James, move back so I can unlock the door.” With a start, James jerked around and smiled at his wife, tears falling unashamedly. </p>
<p>With one last glance at his brother, James stepped back to give Lily room. She took a moment to smile sweetly at Snape, then the others, before working on removing the complicated locking charms on their cage. Malfoy and Bill were standing just behind their cellmates, tired smiles on their faces. None of them seemed injured or healing. Other than looking a little pale and gaunt, they all appeared to be healthy. </p>
<p>A click snapped him back to the present, and, taking a moment to grab Remus, James rushed forward to wrap his arms around Sirius, forcing his sandy haired friend to do the same. Remus was tentative, arms shaking as he engulfed both men in a bear hug, chin resting against his own chest as he shook. </p>
<p>He heard the commotion as Bill and Malfoy thanked Lily, both men hollering when Charlie swept in and grabbed them both in a tight hug. James grinned at the annoyed grunt from Snape when Lily launched herself at him in a hug. It felt like a dream, alive and uninjured, it was almost too good to be true. Sighing, James pulled back and took a moment to survey the room, noticing for the first time the second cell tucked against the side wall. It was small, barely bigger than an upright coffin, and the door was open. Inside there was a small bucket and splashes of what appeared to be dried blood. </p>
<p>With a frown, James pulled away from his friends to investigate the small cell. “Pads, what is this?”</p>
<p>Behind him, Lily was conjuring trauma blankets and forcing each man to take one. Sirius was wrapping the conjured blanket around his shoulders as he stepped up as if to answer but Malfoy’s soft drawl cut him off. “That’s where The Dark Lord kept his son.”</p>
<p>Spinning around, James stared at the blonde boy, disbelief clouding his thoughts. “What?”</p>
<p>Shrugging off Snape’s hand, Malfoy stepped toward James with a cold superiority. “I said, that is where The Dark Lord kept his son. When he wasn’t using him as an attack dog that is.”</p>
<p>Glancing back at the painfully small cell, James winced at the churning of unease in his gut. “Why aren’t any of you injured? What happened here?”</p>
<p>-oo00oo-</p>
<p>Bill didn’t know why he did it, why he was compelled to creep out of his bed in the middle of the night and sneak down to the dungeon where they were keeping Voldemort’s son under constant surveillance. They had all been cleared medically just a few hours ago, and after three hours trapped in his family’s overwhelming excitement and downright smothering presence, he had finally managed to slip away. </p>
<p>Over three weeks they had been kept locked inside of Slytherin Mausoleum. 28 long days trapped with Severus and Sirius at each other's throats. 28 days of Draco growing more and more sullen and withdrawn. 28 days of bread, water, cheese, turkey and oranges. 28 days of eating, drinking, sleeping, crying, screaming, sink baths, jerking off and shitting in front of his colleagues. And for 24 of those 28 days, all four of them had watched as the son of The Dark Lord was tortured. </p>
<p>Every day a Death Eater would appear, they would pull the boy out of his cage, chain him to the floor and experiment with spells, curses and potions. When those grew dull, they would move on to muggle torture. It was during those moments each day that the four of them would huddle on the furthest bed, wrapped around each other and unable to look away as the teen was mutilated. Through it all, day after day, unfed, unhealed, unwashed, the boy never made a sound except laughter. </p>
<p>The laughter seemed to please the Death Eaters, they would murmur in excitement, sometimes even rewarding the teen’s jubilation with food or water. It was during these sessions that Bill noticed, for the first time, that the slender man was probably, at most, Draco’s age. It left a bitter taste in their mouths once they realized it. </p>
<p>Bill was ashamed to say he never tried to stop the torture. Knowing that drawing attention to them would only succeed in spurring their own inevitable torture. Instead he, along with his cellmates, sat back and watched it happen, everyday. Until one morning the Death Eaters came and healed the boy. They led him out of his cage, hitting him with cleansing spells and healing spells before handing the teen a pair of black breeches and an emerald green cloak. </p>
<p>The teen had looked up at his tormentors with a blank expression before a slow, wicked smile curved at his mouth. “Does daddy dearest want me to come out and play?”</p>
<p>The tallest Death Eater helped the teen fasten the cloak with a snake brooch, gloved hands swamping the young man’s throat. “Yes my lord.”</p>
<p>It was the only time they had heard the kid speak. And it was those words that followed the trio out of the mausoleum, none of them sparing a glance and the caged Order members. </p>
<p>It was probably a twisted sense of guilt that led Bill’s feet down into the cold basement. Guilt that, while they had been kidnapped and locked away, they had all come out relatively unscathed. Guilt that while they sat huddled in the corner, the teen, the <i>child</i> had been tortured nearly to death almost every day of their stay. Guilt that it seemed like a familiar hat to the young man. Guilt that the scars and full body tattooing was ritualistic and medieval in nature. </p>
<p>Shaking away the cobwebs in his head, Bill took a deep breath and rounded the corner. Mundungus ‘Dung’ Fletcher was on guard duty, much to Bill’s luck, as the older wizard was stretched out in a chair, sound asleep. Shaking his head, Bill shot a nonverbal sleeping spell at Dung, just to reassure his privacy, and forced his feet to take him into the cell room. </p>
<p>The boy, Mamba, was already at his cell door, arms stretched through the bars, hips canted and body on display. Bill forced himself to ignore the blush that lit up his neck in the unashamed nudity of the younger man. Mamba wasn’t very tall, barely taller than his baby sister Ginny if he had to hazard a guess. Lean muscles saved him from looking completely emaciated, and the sheer amount of tattooing that covered his entire body, face included, left it a little difficult to force his eyes toward the teen’s face. </p>
<p>His eyes were just as haunting as all the tall tales led them to believe. They glowed in the dim dungeon light with an unholy Avada Kedavra green that left a swelling sense of nervousness pooling in Bill’s gut. Forcing himself forward, Bill stopped just out of arm's reach and took a moment to observe the other man up close. There were two delicate strips of tattooing that ran vertically down the boy's face, both starting at his forehead, stretching down over his eyes and curling under his sharp chin. </p>
<p>Following a line of tattoo across the boy’s collar bone, Bill cleared his throat and lifted his eyes to meet the amused gaze of their captive. “Hullo.”</p>
<p>The teen practically purred in delight, body stretching like a flower toward the sun. “Hello William Weasley.”</p>
<p>James had warned him of the teen’s name trick, thankfully, or Bill might have been left gaping. Clearing his throat again, Bill steeled his nerves, fingers reflexively curling around his wand. “Are you... “ Sighing, Bill pushed his hand through his long hair and tried to ignore the smile on the other man’s face. “Are you being treated alright?”</p>
<p>Smiling, Mamba pressed closer, eyes flitting across Bill’s face, taking in the rakish scars that stretch from his brow to his chin. “Hmm, your Order has been as hospitable as I expected darling fledgling.”</p>
<p>Bill caught his subconscious move to reach up to his scars, the damage from Fenrir Greyback’s claws had caused him nothing but hardship in the last year. From Fleur being unable to handle the personality changes that came with being partially changed, to his family having to force themselves to look him in the face, Bill had not yet come to accept the transformation of his life caused by the attack. A fact that the teen seemed to see and exploit all within seconds of meeting him. It left Bill stumbling for words. </p>
<p>Head cocked, Mamba licked his lips slowly, eyes forcing Bill to stare. “Ask what you came here to ask fledgling.”</p>
<p>“Why did they torture you? Why did you let them torture you?”</p>
<p>Smiling, Mamba pressed his face closer, cheeks catching on the bars, causing his mouth to stretch into a comically large grin. “I was being conditioned.”</p>
<p>“For what?”</p>
<p>Stretching, Mamba managed to brush his fingers over the scars on Bill’s face before the redhead had time to snatch himself away. “For my capture by your darling Order of the Phoenix, of course.”</p>
<p>“What? Was this <i>planned</i>?”</p>
<p>Wiggling his hips, Mamba continued to smile as he curled his hands in the air like claws, trying to snag Bill. “Of course Billy, of course. You did not honestly think a little battle and a little Ministry Auror could kill the Great Dark Lord Voldemort, did you?” Giggling, Mamba pulled back enough to twiddle his fingers at the redhead before launching himself at the bars. His momentum and slight frame allowed him enough ability to slip his upper body through the widest set of the bars. </p>
<p>Curling his hands in Bill’s robes, much like he had done with James Potter earlier, Mamba hauled the Weasley closer, grunting as he slammed the redheads face into the magically reinforced cage. Faces pressed together, Bill didn’t have time to gasp before the young man slammed their mouths together in a brief, painful kiss. “Did you really think that blood traitor could kill The Dark Lord? Silly little almost werewolf. Silly little in-between. Belonging to nowhere and to no one.”</p>
<p>Tutting mockingly, Mamba let Bill pull away, laughing as the redhead cursed and spit, lifting a sleeve to wipe at his mouth. “You’re sick!”</p>
<p>Cackling, Mamba plopped himself down on the floor, back arching to crack satisfyingly. “I am just informed, dear. Nothing more.”</p>
<p>Turning away, Bill reversed the spell on Dung and hurried back up the stairs, trying to decide how to tell Dumbledore that he didn’t think Voldemort was as deceased as they had been led to believe. Shaking his head, Bill burst out of the basement and went to find the Headmaster, hoping against hope that the churning in his stomach was fear, not primal attraction.</p>
<p>-oo00oo-</p>
<p>Draco felt uncomfortable. He usually did in the company of so many Order members, but this emergency meeting Dumbledore had called had him all kinds of sideways. Twisting his fingers together under the table, Draco chanced a glance at his godfather, annoyance pooling in his gut at the older man’s aloofness. Of course Severus was the picture of serene disgust. The entirety of the Order was crammed into the grand dining hall of number 12, the table had been magically expanded and chairs had been conjured. Someone, probably Mrs. Weasley, had made a massive plate of sandwiches for the meeting. </p>
<p>Dumbledore had not yet arrived, late to his own meeting, his seat at the head of the table was empty, as was the chair directly across from him at the other end of the table. Draco eyed the new chair dubiously, it was different than all the rest. Unlike the wooden chairs that held the order members it was stone, with sturdy, thick armrests. Draco had an uneasy feeling that he knew who that particular chair was intended for. </p>
<p>The members began helping themselves to the food while they waited on Albus to arrive, Draco sneered at every attempt someone made to hand him a sandwich. The older Order members were still wallowing in guilt over their capture. Everytime he walked into a room someone, usually Mrs. Weasley, tried to force food down his throat. Despite the limited spread provided in the mausoleum, Draco just wasn’t hungry, his stomach still felt raw. They’d only been rescued yesterday, and after a month of forcing himself to eat the same food every day, he couldn’t seem to bring himself to eat. Food tasted like ash.</p>
<p>With a shake, Draco turned toward the opening door, eyes widening at his first glimpse of the Dark Lord’s son since their rescue. The Order insisted on referring to him as ‘Mamba’ still, even after having him in their possession for a few days. Mamba looked better than he had for most of their capture, still gaunt and pale, but no longer covered in open, festering wounds. </p>
<p>Draco couldn’t help the burn of outrage that curled in his gut at the state of undress of the other teen. His hands were shackled, feet as well, and they kept him stripped completely bare. Snarling, Draco had to turn his head away as Potter let the teen to the stone chair at the end of the table, magically tethering his shackles down. Mrs. Weasley magically set a plate of sandwiches down within the prisoner’s reach, her ridiculous ‘mothering’ expression at full blast. </p>
<p>Mamba shot a chilly grin at the red haired matron, jerking his hands forward to snatch up the plate of food. The teen pressed the plate close to his face, sniffing the sandwiches before whipping the entire platter to the side, seeming pleased when the plate shattered against the wall. Mrs. Weasley gasped, eyes <i>actually</i> welling with tears. The woman was a brilliant performer, honestly.  </p>
<p>Mamba just continued to grin, eyes locked on the Weasley matriarch. Dumbledore vanished the mess with a wave of his hand, pausing to pat her on the shoulder before moving to take his seat. The professor steepled his fingers under his chin, smiling benevolently around at the room. </p>
<p>“I want to thank you all for coming, I appreciate the attendance on such short notice. First order of business, welcome back to our dear friends!”</p>
<p>A cheer went up among the Order, everyone turning to pat the rescued members on their shoulders. Draco tried not flinch at each hand that reached for him. He couldn’t help but sneak another glance at Mamba, who seemed wholly amused at the entire situation. </p>
<p>“I would also like to take a moment to thank our heroes tonight! Without James, Lily, Charlie and Remus we may have never met our <i>guest</i> and we may have never been able to find out where our friends were being held.”</p>
<p>Another cheer went up, this one louder than the first. Someone passed around flutes of champagne to commemorate the moment.  Draco accepted a glass with a nod of his head, noticing that, unlike the sandwiches, none of the members offered any to Mamba.</p>
<p>“Now that our celebrations are out of the way, let us discuss our next course of action. Though Voldemort may be gone for the moment, we need to make sure that there is no possible avenue for his possible return. That is why I have invited our <i>guest</i> here to help us.”</p>
<p>The room erupted into chaos. The order members all jumped to their feet at once, screaming and shooting sparks from their wands. Draco leaned back in his chair, turning his attention fully toward Mamba. The other teen seemed delighted at the turn of events. </p>
<p>Draco had known about Mamba for some time, as did Severus. After being forced by his family to take the Dark Mark, Draco had gone to his godfather, desperate for an escape from the nightmare that had become his life. Severus had taken him to Dumbledore, to the Order, to salvation. Working with the Order, working undercover among the Death Eaters, had taken probably ten years off of his life from stress, but it provided him with a feeling of freedom from the prison his father had built around him. </p>
<p>While working undercover, Draco had met Mamba, the Dark Lord’s son had no name among the Death Eaters. Draco had only ever known him as ‘the Dark Prince’. The Dark Prince had taken a shine to Draco, though he didn’t know why. Everytime he apparated into the Riddle Manor the Dark Prince would show up within minutes, appearing at his side as silent as a spectre. </p>
<p>Over time they had formed an, interesting, friendship. The Dark Prince had attached himself to Draco, silently following the blonde to meetings and favoring him with a seat close to the Dark Lord during obligatory meals among the higher society supporters. Trying to not get caught staring, Draco spared one last glance to check his… friend… for injury before turning his attention back to where Dumbledore was getting control back over the room.</p>
<p>“Friends! I understand your disquiet, I do. However, celebrations must be put on hold. It has been brought to my attention that the battle at the ministry may have been a ruse. Bill has informed me of a conversation he had with our Black Mamba, and in the wake of that I feel it would be best if we took preventative measures to ensure that Voldemort is truly gone. I have brought our <i>guest</i> here to find out what he may know about any fail safe plans Voldemort may have had in place.”</p>
<p>At once, every eye in the room was locked onto Mamba’s restrained form, who smiled delightedly at the attention. Dumbledore attempted a grandfatherly smile, folding his hands in front of him on the table. “What do you say my boy? Do you think there is some information that you could help us with?”</p>
<p>Mamba wiggled his fingers, shifting in his seat to rub his bare back against the cool texture of the stone chair. “Oh, I am sure there is something I know that you do not, White Hat. The question of the night, however, is why should I provide you with my knowledge? How does it benefit me?”</p>
<p>A rumble of angry muttering swept through the room, however Dumbledore only smiled. “You are young, child, from what Madam Pomfrey tells me you are about 16 years old. Not yet a legal adult wizard. Since you were so cooperative earlier, the Minister has agreed to reduce your sentence to probation in the guardianship of a legal, ministry approved adult. If you provide us with some more of your valuable information we may be able to be persuaded to let you have some say so in who that guardian might be.”</p>
<p>Mamba smiled wider, teeth gleaming. “And if my choice is, say, Severus Snape?”</p>
<p>Snape went rigid beside Draco, eyes locked on the Dark Prince challengingly. Dumbledore just chuckled, seemingly pleased with the turn of the conversation. “Now, while that would be a wonderful adventure, I do not believe Dear Severus would be ministry approved. I would, however, be willing to provide you with a list of options. Willing volunteers.”</p>
<p>Mamba leaned toward the table, fingers steepling in imitation of Dumbledore. “Such as?”</p>
<p>Lily Potter stepped forward, determined cast to her mouth. “We will volunteer.”</p>
<p>Remus Lupin stepped forward as well, glowing eyes locked on the teen. “I will as will.”</p>
<p>Several other Order members volunteered, including the four oldest Weasley children, Sirius Black and Dung. Dumbledore seemed to glow with every name mentioned, like a proud father. Lip curling in disgust, Draco cut his eyes at his own guardian, Black, before turning to watch the reaction of the Dark Prince. Mamba just continued to smile, eyes glowing before locking on Draco.</p>
<p>Pushing himself as far forward as his restraints would allow, smiling turning as friendly as Draco had ever seen it. “What do you think Draco?”</p>
<p>Draco winced as every eye in the room turned to him. Dumbledore, in particular, had a hard, frustrated expression on his usually jovial face. However, having the Prince address him here, in front of the Order members meant that the binding curse Voldemort had placed on him was released. It was almost funny, two years of being bound to silence regarding any information on Prince had been washed away and still Draco felt drawn to the other teen. </p>
<p>Locking eyes with Prince, Draco tried to calm his pounding heart. “It is really your choice, Prince. I, myself, am in custody of my cousin, Sirius Black.”</p>
<p>Nodding, Mamba turned his attention back to Dumbledore and shifted his weight in the stone chair he was trapped in. “Then I, too, will choose Sirius Black.”</p>
<p>Dumbledore spared one last glance at Draco before turning his attention back to their prisoner. “Well, now that we are temporarily settled on a guardian, what can you tell me about Voldemort’s plans?”</p>
<p>Mamba wiggled around in his seat for a moment, shoulders rolling, before he brought his hands back up to rest fully on the table. His unshackled hands. 

</p><p>“Tell me Albus, what do you know about Horcruxes?” </p>
