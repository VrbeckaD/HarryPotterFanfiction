    <b>Chapter 1: The Worst Birthday</b>
  </p>
  <ul>
<li>Let’s start our look at book 2 with fatphobia. Which is a thing, especially when it comes to Dudley. Because there is hardly any mention of him without a comment about his weight. And admittedly it is something that I never noticed before but that has been brought to my attention and now it is impossible not to see. And of course not every character that is overweight is described as fat – characters like Molly Weasley &amp; Professor Sprout are simply described as plump. But that is because Harry likes them – whereas Dudley has been his abuser for 10 years. And the story is after all told from his perspective. And yet it is problematic how Dudley, as a negative character, is in almost every sentence associated with his weight, in the same way that Harry, our hero, is described multiple times as skinny.</li>
</ul>
  <ul>
<li>And again magic is associated with abnormality, at least by uncle Vernon, which makes Harry, if you will, a queer character (“[…]<em>because Harry wasn’t a normal boy</em>”).</li>
</ul>

    <b>Chapter 2: Dobby’s Warning</b>
  </p>
  <ul>
<li>Looking back it is really just the first book that describes the wizarding world as innocent (apart from the crazy mass murderer who killed Harry’s parents), because in book 2 already we get a closer look at the uglier sides of the wizard society. And of course it starts with the introduction of Dobby and house elves as an integral part of said society. Which is built upon the slavery of an entire species. In this book we only get glimpses, as we focus on Dobby and his treatment specifically, and it isn’t until book 4 (and S.P.E.W.) that we look at house elves and their place in the magical community as a whole. But I admit that I find them utterly fascinating and that they do inform us a great deal about the magical world.</li>
</ul>
  <ul>
<li>Again, what we see in book 2 is Dobby’s individual situation and how Harry reacts to it. He sincerely cares about Dobby and his first instinct is to help him. It is implied that Dobby’s fate isn’t singular, that there must be many more house elves living under similar circumstances, but at least Harry (as our narrator) doesn’t see this bigger picture yet and what it tells us about the wizarding world.</li>
</ul>
  <ul>
<li>I wonder if Dobby’s need to hurt himself whenever he talks bad about his family is something house elves in general are forced to do, or if it was a specific spell the Malfoys used on their house elf.</li>
</ul>
  <ul>
<li>Also, an entire race that lives to serve, made me wonder if the wizards themselves somehow created house elves or bred them, because it always seemed unnatural to me, given how intelligent, empathic and powerful house elves are. They are classified as Beings, not Beasts, and have their own very powerful magic, so my own personal headcanon is that wizards at some point deliberated enslaved them in a way that made them happy to serve and therefore unlikely to revolt.</li>
</ul>
  <ul>
<li>I just really love house elves and I think they are highly underestimated, and I love how exactly this underestimation of their powers lead to the destruction of a Horcrux and this doesn’t even happen in this book, so I stop talking now.</li>
</ul>
  <ul>
<li>(HOUSE ELVES!!!!)</li>
</ul>
  <ul>
<li>Also, Dobby speaks of Harry’s greatness and Harry’s first instinct is to say that he is not even top of his class, that would be Hermione, and sometimes this kid is just too adorable.</li>
</ul>
  <ul>
<li>When Harry asks Dobby if Voldemort is behind the mortal danger that awaits him at Hogwarts, his answer is “<em>Not – not He Who Must Not Be Named, sir</em>”, which is technically correct, because Tom Riddle is not Voldemort yet, but also the most useless answer ever.</li>
</ul>
  <ul>
<li>I always wondered how the Ministry of Magic is able to trace magic. They know that a spell has been used in Privet Drive, yet they don’t know it was used by a house elf. And if you can put traces on spells, shouldn’t it be possible to put traces on the Unforgivable Curses?</li>
</ul>
  <ul>
<li>Harry gets the bare minimum of food and yet he shares it with Hedwig, which again, is adorable.</li>
</ul>
