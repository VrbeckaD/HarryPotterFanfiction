  <em>"The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches... born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies... and the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal, but he will have power the Dark Lord knows not... and either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives... the one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord will be born as the seventh month dies..."</em>
</p><p>Voldemort closed the book with a thump, letting the dust from the pages fly into the air and settle again. Though there were several others in the room, they dared not make a sound, they dared not breathe. He could hear the sounds of Nagini's scales moving as she adjusted herself, but the rest of the world was silent, waiting for him to shatter it. He took in a breath and then another, inhaling the books around him and the smell of the library. It was perhaps fate that he decided to hold the meeting in the massive library of Riddle Manor. The manor was his, for all intents and purposes, having belonged to his father and his father before him. Before he killed them both. Normally, he would ignore this connection to the muggles and the family who shunned him, but the Order was closing in and the last place Dumbledore would expect him to be was in the home of the man he hated.</p><p>Severus had run into the room with haste, spilling from his lips the prophecy which should spell his certain demise. And it probably would have, if he hadn't had the meeting in this house. How fortuitous that the family he hated provided him with his saving grace. Severus was still huffing when he had stood and pulled a book from the shelf. The book seemed to understand the gravity of the situation as it fell open to the page he was looking for. </p><p>After some time he closed the book and turned back to his followers, sitting around the long table with bated breath. </p><p>"What do you know of Greek mythology? Or Confucius?" He knew they were stunned by his question and none provided an answer. "In Greek mythology, there is a story of a man, a king, who is told his future is to be murdered by his son and his son will wed his wife." He explained. "Fearing his death, the man sends his son away in an attempt to kill him. But the son is spared and raised by another king in another kingdom. Some years later, the son asks for his future and is told he will murder his father and wed his mother. Disgusted, he leaves home to prevent it, but he meets a traveler on the road and kills him. Unbeknownst to him, the traveler is his father. He does indeed wed his mother and has children. Eventually, he learns the truth and blinds himself in regret."</p><p>Voldemort paused for a moment before continuing. "Confucius once said, 'Study the past if you would divine the future.'"</p><p>He tapped a long pale finger against his chin as he thought. </p><p>"This could prove to my advantage," His mind started whirring.</p><p>"My lord?" Lucius asked, unable to follow his train of thought.</p><p>"Dumbledore will be counting on my reaction to the prophecy to spell my demise. He expects I will react to not knowing that my actions will have disastrous consequences for me in the future. But I was always a good student."</p><p>He let his mind wander for a moment before dismissively waving his hand. He had to plan and any plan would require all the right pieces put into place. </p><p>The days passed and winter bled into spring.</p><p>"Tell me what you know of your Mudblood friend. She has a child, does she not? Born at the end of July."</p><p>He watched the fear play in Severus's eyes. "Yes, my lord." The man said carefully. "But I don't believe it could be her child."</p><p>"And why not?"</p><p>"There is another born at the end of July, to Frank and Alice Longbottom."</p><p>"A pureblood, yes," Voldemort said quietly.</p><p>Severus carefully hid his emotions, but Voldemort knew better. The potions maker would scurry off to Dumbledore the moment he was dismissed. </p><p>He was right, of course. Not long after, the Potters went into hiding. Battle after battle, Order against Death Eaters. The wizarding world was torn apart and the Potters knew Voldemort was hunting them. He was certain he had lost them, his plan had failed until the rats decided to abandon the sinking ship.</p><p>The room was dark, with only candles lighting its depths. He sat behind a massive, mahogany desk. On his right stood Bellatrix, tall and proud. On his left stood Lucius, every bit the pureblood Voldemort craved. And in front of him was a sniveling man, curled into a ball on the floor. Barty rolled his eyes behind him, his hands folded behind his back. Pettigrew raised his head to look at him, but immediately curled himself back into a ball and began whimpering once more. His mousey brown hair rubbed against the floor with his shaking. Voldemort idly wondered how he had managed to enter the room in the first place. Perhaps Barty rolled him in. He had only entered after the man was cowering on the floor. </p><p>"Is there something you wish to say or would you prefer to continue to tell your whimpers to the floor." </p><p>Pettigrew raised his head once more, whimpering and shaking as he did. "M-my lord," He began only to have Bellatrix hiss in response.</p><p>"How dare you?" She stepped forward, eyes blazing with hatred. "How dare you presume to call him <em>your </em>Lord. You haven't the right!"</p><p>He reached out and pressed a hand to her arm, stopping her anger in its tracks. She moved back to his side and her former tirade seemingly forgotten. He looked back to Pettigrew who by some miracle looked more afraid. </p><p>"Continue."</p><p>"My-" He stopped himself and seemingly receded into his shirt before continuing. "I-I know where the Potters are." He winced as though he had been hit, but no one in the room moved.</p><p>"<em>You</em> know where the Potters are?" Voldemort asked, drawing out every word in the sentence to show his disbelief.</p><p>"Y-yes." </p><p>On either side, Bellatrix and Lucius began to laugh.</p><p>"<em>He </em>knows where the Potters are? Him?" Bellatrix cackled. "He doesn't know where he placed his guts much less where the Potters are."</p><p>"My Lord," Lucius said smoothly at his side. "The Potters both are well known for their skills. James Potter is an exceptional wizard and adept at magic. Lily Potter neé Evans is a master potioneer who rivals Severus in many ways. I doubt this whimpering mess of a man could be trusted with their whereabouts."</p><p>He raised his hand, a cue they took to silence themselves immediately. Voldemort stood and breezed past Bellatrix, who shuddered at his nearness. </p><p>"How would you know where the Potters are?" He asked quietly.</p><p>Pettigrew looked around the room at Bellatrix, Lucius, Nagini, and eventually Voldemort before shaking even more.</p><p>"I-I am their Secret Keeper."</p><p>"You?" Bellatrix asked once again in disbelief. "I thought it would be that no good cousin of mine."</p><p>"My dear Bella does bring up a point," Voldemort said as he neared Pettigrew. "We thought for certain it would be Sirius Black. I will need to see if what you say is true."</p><p>His hand moved faster than Pettigrew, grasping the other by the chin and forcing their eyes to meet. Pettigrew's mind was easy to infiltrate. It reminded him oddly of a rat, and as he searched the man's memories, he understood why. </p><p>A memory surfaced of three boys, himself included, changing into the forms of animals. One was obviously James Potter, easy to recognize for that wild hair of his. The other was Sirius Black, who had many of the features Voldemort had seen on Bellatrix. Together the three ran into the woods, following the sounds of a werewolf. </p><p>The memory changed and he saw a young woman with vibrant red hair and stunning emerald eyes staring down at a sack of blankets with a face. She turned it slightly so he could see. It was a baby and when its eyes blinked open, he could see they were the exact color of the Killing Curse. The baby offered a toothless smile before reaching up and stretching before letting out a yawn. </p><p>The memory changed once more to the slightly older versions of James Potter and Sirius Black sitting with Pettigrew and Dumbledore. </p><p>"They will expect that I am the Secret Keeper," Black said before his eyes turned to Pettigrew. "You should be the Secret Keeper."</p><p>Dumbledore's sparkling eyes followed the sentence from behind half-moon glasses. </p><p>"Him?" James asked skeptically.</p><p>"Yes!" Sirius exclaimed. "It's perfect you see. They won't expect him." He turned to Pettigrew. "All you have to do is keep your head down until the war's over."</p><p>Pettigrew nodded slightly but before he could give a verbal answer, a child barreled into the room, chasing a ginger cat. </p><p>"Harry James Potter, you get back here!" A voice called. But there was no malice behind it. Only slight exasperation and something else Voldemort couldn't identify.</p><p>Lily Potter appeared in the room and she shared a knowing glance with her husband. </p><p>"Might as well induct him into the Order now with how determined he is to be in Order meetings." Lily huffed.</p><p>James stood from the table. "Leave him, I'll get him. You should be here." He pressed a kiss to her cheek before following the running toddler from the room.</p><p>Voldemort withdrew from Pettigrew's mind and the man fell into a heap on the floor.</p><p>"It appears he is telling the truth," Voldemort said quietly, feeling the excitement bubble off Lucius and Bellatrix behind him. He knelt next to Pettigrew who shook violently on the floor. "Now tell me, Wormtail," The man's eyes widened at the name, "Where are Lily, James, and Harry Potter?"</p>
