      <p>I didn't have the full story when I made this choice. If I'm perfectly honest, I wasn't even aware I'd agreed to it at all. One moment, Luna was insisting that the beast she wanted us to study would earn us top marks, and the next, I found myself unable to say no to her dreamy eyes.</p>
      <p>Now, as we head towards the creature's lair, I really wish I had said no.</p>
      <p>"Are you sure you don't want to study something else? What about Pygmy Puffs? I'm sure Ginny wouldn't mind lending us Arnold."</p>
      <p>"No thank you, Colin; I've already had enough conversations with him to know that he's not suitable for this project," Luna says, giving me a smile as she skips ahead.</p>
      <p>It's almost enough to ease my rapidly beating heart—almost. As we duck through the entrance to the creature's dwelling, I find my hands and knees begin to tremble. I try to think of something less dangerous to study that would fascinate her.</p>
      <p>"What about Crumple-Horned Snorkacks? Or a—er—a Snuffaluffagus? We could search the Forbidden Forest."</p>
      <p>She turns to me with an eyebrow raised, but her silver eyes are focused on my head. "I was worried the Wrackspurts had affected you. Crumple-Horned Snorkacks don't live in the forest. I also don't know what a Snuffaluffagus is; are you sure it exists?"</p>
      <p>As I simply blink, she presses a finger to her lips and motions for me to crawl over to a shadowed spot.</p>
      <p>"Get your camera ready," she whispers.</p>
      <p>I hope she doesn't see me gulp as I lift the camera to my eye line. Just in front of our hiding place, I catch a glimpse of the creature's golden mane.</p>
      <p>"Ooooooooooooooooooooh!"</p>
      <p>I almost drop my camera as the creature's howl makes me jump out of my skin. I close my eyes and try to even my heartbeat; I'm sure it'll be able to hear it.</p>
      <p>Luna doesn't seem nearly as worried. She's already got her quill out and is hastily scribbling notes in her notebook. I watch as she peers over our hiding spot, examining the creature in its natural habitat.</p>
      <p>"Can apparently read," she mutters to herself.</p>
      <p>This gets my attention. Taking a deep breath and moving as quietly as a mouse, I take a peek at the creature. It's true that its blue eyes are trained on what looks to be some sort of magazine, but I don't really consider that reading. It seems the creature is more focused on the images, perhaps drawn in by the bright colours.</p>
      <p>It soon loses interest, anyway, and turns to its claws. I quickly duck back down as it begins to sharpen them.</p>
      <p>Luna nudges me, and I almost jump out of my skin again.</p>
      <p>"Take a picture," she says, her voice sounding way louder than it really is.</p>
      <p>I quickly shake my head, forgetting that I'm supposed to be a Gryffindor. I've always wanted to be considered brave—just like Harry—but I know that there's a difference between bravery and stupidity.</p>
      <p>"She won't bite," Luna says, giving me a knowing smile.</p>
      <p>I have no idea how she does that; maybe she can communicate with these Wrackspurts supposedly floating around my head? Still, I don't want her to think I'm a coward.</p>
      <p>"I'm not so sure," I mutter, taking a deep breath and standing up.</p>
      <p>Through the lens, I can see the beast glaring at me, no doubt angry that I've disturbed it.</p>
      <p>"I—I just want t-to take—to take your p-picture." I don't even care that my voice comes out as a squeak. "For an assignment."</p>
      <p>I hold my breath as the creature seems to listen to my words. Slowly, it gives a nod, and to my relief, even starts posing. I snap a few pictures as quickly as I can before nodding to Luna.</p>
      <p>"Thank you!" she calls as we run out of the lair.</p>
      <p>Once we're safely outside the Gryffindor common room, I sigh. "I thought she was going to rip me to shreds. Are you sure Professor Hagrid will count this?"</p>
      <p>Luna nods. "Oh yes. If you ask me, teenage girls are the most interesting beasts of them all. Did you see how long it took Lavender to choose a nail polish? They all looked exactly the same. Really, fascinating stuff."</p>
      <p>As she skips off to her own common room, I shake my head. Next time, I'll be sure to get the full story before agreeing to one of Luna's ideas.</p>
