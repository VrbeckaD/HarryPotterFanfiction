    <p>„Pads, please, I have to know if Lily is meeting someone when she sneaks behind the greenhouses. And you know, this time it’s only me who has detention.” James theatrically knelt down before Sirius. “You are my favorite foster brother, my best friend, the coolest dog in Hogwarts…”<br/>
“Shut up Prongs, I’m your only foster brother. And if I do it, you owe me a trip to the record shop and two Muggle records.”<br/>
“No problem. But pleaaase, if she is dating someone…”<br/>
“Yeah, I’ll be the king of cockblockers.”</p><p>As promised, Sirius was sneaking after Lily in his dog form. She went past Greenhouse 2 and transfigured a stone between shrubs into an armchair, then picked up a smaller stone.<br/>
“Finite incantatum.” She held a book in her hand. ‘My Mother – My Self’<br/>
Prongs would feel so stupid. Just because Lily’s reading corner was in that area where the map was had been glitching since a hex hit it during a duel with Snivellus last week. Lily was just reading. Sirius watched her for fifteen minutes, starting to fidget more and more, it was so boring to watch someone read. At least if it could be Remus he was watching he could stare at that cute look on his face which appeared whenever he enjoyed what he was reading without him noticing. Remus was always cute, except maybe on a full moon, then he was majestic. </p><p>“OWWWWWWW” Something was stinging his left front leg. Lily jumped up as if hit by a stinging hex.  She drew her wand, and carefully approached the hedge where Padfoot was hiding. He tried to scramble free, but his leg was caught in the brambles.<br/>
“Oh, it’s you, I have seen you before, I think I’ll call you Snuffles until I know your real name.” Lily cooed.<br/>
Padfood whined.</p><p>“Are you injured? Let me look.” Tearing at the brambles, she freed his leg and took a look at it.<br/>
“Not enough light. I’ll carry you.”<br/>
She picked Padfoot up and staggered to her armchair, struggling with his weight. “You are a big dog, Snuffles. I hope you won’t get injured again. But carrying injured dogs is better than having to listen to obnoxious boys.”<br/>
Padfoot whimpered and gave her a quizzical look.</p><p>“There are two boys in my year and in my house, who fancy each other. They are best friends, always hanging out with each other and their other two best friends. And they are always very tactile with each other, like I never knew any other boys who cuddle with each other when one of them is sick. Let me see your paw again.” Padfoot obediently stretched out his left front paw. “You have a thorn in your pad.” She broke a twig off a shrub and transfigured it into tweezers, then pulled out the thorn. Finally she pointed her wand at Padfoot’s paw. “Episkey.” The paw healed, and Lily started scratching Padfoot’s ears. </p><p>“There has not been one day in the last three months without one of those two boys ranting about being in love with the other one; how handsome, clever, witty, perfect the other one is, but when I tell him to tell the other one so, they are too scared. Both made me promise not to tell any human being, and Remus…” Her voice cut off, then she gasped as the dog began transforming back into a human being. And not just any human being, but Sirius Black himself.<br/>
“Thanks for the pep talk, I’ve got to find Remus.” He shouted over his shoulder and ran to the castle.</p>
