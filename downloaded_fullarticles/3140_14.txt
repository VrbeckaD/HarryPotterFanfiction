          <div class="userstuff"><p>Harry's love is radiant,<br/>a flame that casts out the gloom that lurks in the corners of Draco's eyes, <br/>the passionate heat chasing away the damp that lingers just out of sight, <br/>leaving doubt with nowhere to hide. <br/>The constant, relentless beat of his heart drums out the same refrain,<br/>"I love you, I love you, I love you,"<br/>until Draco's fears surrender, once again, to the promise of forever,<br/>of being safe and warm and wanted in this man's arms. </p>
<p>Draco is all elbows and angles,<br/>cunning mid-air turns that would knock a lesser flier off his broom. <br/>His lively, intelligent eyes are quick to observe, and quick to reflect his changing moods. <br/>Before his gaze, Harry feels naked, as if he's being seen for who he really is, <br/>as if he's free to be understood. <br/>Draco's love, once won, is fiercely tenacious - <br/>he wields it like a sword,<br/>ready to defend and guard over those that are his. <br/>Harry basks under its protection, <br/>safe and certain of its presence,<br/>in its promise that he would never have to be alone again.</p></div>
