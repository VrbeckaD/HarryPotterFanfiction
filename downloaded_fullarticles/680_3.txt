    <p>As Harry opened his eyes, he reached to his right, grabbing at his glasses that he knew would be sitting there. Looking around, he recognised the perfectly white sterilised room that he was in as the Hogwarts infirmary. He groaned as the familiar sight of Hogwarts' mediwitch, Penelope Clearwater, came bustling over to him from her small office.</p><p> </p><p>"Glad to see you finally awake Mr Potter", she said, as she pulled out her wand and began waving it around him.</p><p> </p><p>"What happened"? Harry asked, his eyes following the wand tip as it began to trace down his body.</p><p> </p><p>"It appears you collapsed after the battle. Miss Granger had to catch you in order to stop you cracking your skull open on the grand staircase", she shot him a stern glare, before it morphed into a cheeky grin. "Though knowing your luck Harry, surviving the battle of the age just to die tripping on the stairs is quiet fitting".</p><p> </p><p>"Hey!", Harry shouted, before gripping his head as pain pierced it.</p><p> </p><p>Penny flinched slightly, "you alright? Though she caught you, Hermione did say you clipped the banister with your head, so you may feel slight pain for a while".</p><p> </p><p>"Great", Harry muttered, before his face turned sombre. "How many.."</p><p> </p><p>"Don't you dare", Penny said, pointing a warning finger toward him. "Don't you dare even begin to blame yourself Harry".</p><p> </p><p>Harry felt tears begin to form in the corners of his eyes as he looked down at his hands. He froze for a moment when he felt arms come around him, pulling him into a very soft, and very large, chest. He looked up into Penny's eyes as she lent down, placing a light kiss to his forehead.</p><p> </p><p>"It's not your fault Harry", she said, slipping her wand back in it's holster. "I'll let Hermione and the others know you're up. Shout me if you need to get out of bed".</p><p> </p><p>-------------------------</p><p> </p><p>"You sure"? Hermione asked, feeling tears begin to prick her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>Penny sat down heavily at her desk, wiping a hand across her face to brush away her own tears.</p><p> </p><p>They were currently stood in Penny's office. The two young women were accompanied by Fleur, Tonks, Luna, and McGonagall.</p><p> </p><p>"Yes", said Penny, slumping in her chair.</p><p> </p><p>"How"? Asked Minerva, anger lacing her tone.</p><p> </p><p>"Someone must have cursed him", said Tonks, looking to Penny, and getting a nod in confirmation.</p><p> </p><p>"Tonks is right, someone cursed him, magic was practically encompassing everything below his waist". said Penny.</p><p> </p><p>"Do we know who"? Asked Fleur, her facial features were beginning to sharpen, and tiny white feathers were starting to sprout from her arms. "The only people he fought were Voldemort and Draco Malfoy, if either of them did it, then it would have dissipated with their deaths".</p><p> </p><p>"Then it's still someone who's alive. We need to check all the Death Eater's wands for the spell", said Hermione, standing from the chair she was sat in.</p><p> </p><p>"I don't believe it was a Death Eater", muttered Penny, causing the other women to stop in their tracks.</p><p> </p><p>"What do you mean Penelope"? Asked McGonagall.</p><p> </p><p>"From my readings, the spell would have worked instantly. So when he collapsed, that was when he was hit with the curse".</p><p> </p><p>"That means it would have had to have been someone with a wand, and within shooting distance", said Tonks.</p><p> </p><p>"By the time we were heading to the tower, all the Death Eaters were accounted for in the hall", said Hermione.</p><p> </p><p>"Did you see anyone around you"? Asked Fleur, addressing Hermione.</p><p> </p><p>"No, everyone else was either outside or in the hall", said Hermione. "You can ask Ron though, he might have see someone".</p><p> </p><p>The six women looked out the little window that faced out into the ward, seeing Ron sat talking with Harry.</p><p> </p><p>-------------------------</p><p> </p><p>"You know what happened"? Asked Harry, fiddling with the book in his hands.</p><p> </p><p>"No mate. You kinda just dropped. Lucky Hermione caught you in time", Ron chuckled slightly, a hand scratching at the back of his neck.</p><p> </p><p>Suddenly the door to Penny's office opened, and Fleur quickly walked over. "Ronald, can we speak to you for a moment", she asked, smiling at Harry as she caught his eye.</p><p> </p><p>"Eeeeeerrrrrrr", Ron replied, his eyes glazing over and drool falling from his mouth.</p><p> </p><p>Fleur grimaced and rolled her eyes in disgust, as Tonks came over, grabbed Ron by the shoulder, and pushed him into the office. Fleur stayed with Harry, sitting down on the chair Ron just left, knowing her presence in the office would prevent them from getting anything from Ron.</p><p> </p><p>-------------------------</p><p> </p><p>"So did you see anyone"? Asked Tonks, peering curiously at Ron.</p><p> </p><p>"Umm, no, I don't think so", Ron said, lightly scratching the back of his neck.</p><p> </p><p>"Hermione, Professor McGonagall", Luna said suddenly, getting the two older witches' attention. "Can I speak to you both a moment"?</p><p> </p><p>The three witches left the small room and the ward, standing in the quiet corridor.</p><p> </p><p>"What's the matter Luna"? Asked Hermione.</p><p> </p><p>"Well, Ronald was lying".</p><p> </p><p>Hermione and McGonagall looked to each other momentarily, before turning back to Luna.</p><p> </p><p>"Please explain Miss Lovegood", said Minerva.</p><p> </p><p>"Well, as I said Ronald was lying. He scratched the back of his head".</p><p> </p><p>"You're going to have to explain more Luna", said Hermione.</p><p> </p><p>"When Ronald lies, he scratches the back of his head. He's always done it. When we were little, I asked him if we were friends, as he would play with me and Ginevra when I would visit the Burrow. Mrs Weasley gave him a dirty look, and he said yes, while he was scratching his neck".</p><p> </p><p>Hermione and Minerva glanced at each other, not quite believing her.</p><p> </p><p>"If you want more proof. When he was dating Lavender Brown, he did the same thing when she asked if he loved her. Also when Victor Krum asked Hermione to the ball, he did the same when asked if it bothered him. I have several more examples if you want them".</p><p> </p><p>-------------------------</p><p> </p><p>Ron shrieked in terror when Hermione slammed the door open, grabbed him by the front of his shirt, and slammed him against the wall, the tip of her wand under his chin and glowing with power.</p><p> </p><p>"I will ask you one more time Ronald", Hermione ground out, her jaw tight. "Who, cursed, Harry"?</p><p> </p><p>He mumbled something in reply, causing Tonks, who was beginning to catch on, to whip out her own wand, pointing it at his face.</p><p> </p><p>"IT WAS ME!", he screamed, trying to move his face away from Tonks' wand. </p><p> </p><p>He didn't see as Fleur, who'd come over to see what was going on, begin to seethe in anger, her nails turning to talons, before leaping at him, slashing his face.</p><p> </p><p>-------------------------</p><p> </p><p>"So", said Harry, his face slackened, and his body un-moving. "I'm..."</p><p> </p><p>"I'm so sorry Harry", said Hermione, throwing her arms around his shoulders, and weeping into his chest.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione cursed Ron's name. The evil, jealous, monster. He'd apparently seen Hermione kiss Harry after he defeated Voldemort. It had been a spur of the moment thing, though definitely not unwelcome on both their parts. Ron had been enraged. He'd said he found the spell in the Black Library during their time there before 5th year. When asked where it was now, he'd said Sirius had burned it, not wanting the evil inside to be ever used again. </p><p> </p><p>"I... I can't have kids"? Harry asked, despair in his voice.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione cried harder, Luna's own silent tears began to fall quicker, McGonagall's hand went to her mouth her other pulling the crying Penny into her side, and Tonks, who was watching over a tied up Ron, kicked him in the stomach, causing him to cry out around his gag. It was common knowledge how much Harry had always wanted a family, having not had one himself growing up. The beast that was Ronald Weasley had taken the one thing he'd ever wanted from him.</p><p> </p><p>"You will", said Fleur, determination lacing her voice.</p><p> </p><p>Everyone turned to her, their attention firmly fixed on her.</p><p> </p><p>"I'm Veela, remember. We have the ability to give people who previously can't, the gift of having children. I'm. I'm sorry, it won't help with your legs".</p><p> </p><p>Harry looked down, he tried to move his legs, but they didn't so much as twitch, another consequence of the curse.</p><p> </p><p>"But you will have children, I promise you Harry".</p><p> </p><p>"What do I have to do"?</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>
