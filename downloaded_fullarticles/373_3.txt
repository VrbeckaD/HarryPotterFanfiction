  <span>Sirius hoisted Teddy onto their hip as they walked through the doors of PureFit. Remus was at work this evening, and they and Teddy were planning to meet him after to go for dinner with Hope and Richard. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The reception was fairly busy as they weaved their way through towards the climbing area, looking for Remus, Gideon or Fabian. Teddy was cooing away in their arms, trying to pull on the braid in their hair. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ah, if it isn’t the Tedster!” Gideon was at the desk and threw his hands up when he saw Sirius and Teddy. “How are we?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius chuckled as Teddy gave a little squeal. “Hey Gid, we’re good. Aren’t we Teds?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey mate, all right.” He laughed at Teddy’s squeal. “He’s getting bigger every time I see him, I swear!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Teddy let out a loud babble then hugged Sirius’ neck.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Abruptly the doors flew open and Remus trailed in looking murderous. The reason for that came only a second later when fucking </span>
  <em>
    <span>Fenrir</span>
  </em>
  <span> was right beind him. “I’ve told you multiple times to fuck off and not come here,” he said without turning around, softening slightly when he saw Teddy and Sirius.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You don’t even want to give me a lesson?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You don’t need a lesson in climbing. In how to be a good fucking person, maybe.” Remus snapped, coming right over to Sirius, not looking at Fenrir.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hi caro,” Sirius breathed before glaring over his shoulder to Fenrir. “Did you not hear Remus? Fuck off.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hi my pearl. Hi annwyl.” Remus held his hands out to Teddy. Teddy squealed and reached out for Remus. Sirius gladly handed him over then turned to Fenrir, who was watching with a bemused smile.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sorry, did you not fucking hear me? Fuck off.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Look, mate, I’m just trying to catch up with Re. I thought a climb might be nice. It’s been awhile. Apparently a lot to catch up on.” Fenrir gestured to Teddy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fuck off, far away, and don’t even look at my child,” Remus practically growled.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius quickly stepped between Remus and Fenrir, crossing their arms. They were in heels today, so they felt tall and intimidating. “You have nothing to catch up on, and you are not climbing in this whole arena, never mind with my husband,” they hissed, feeling far more protective than usual. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Really, didn’t we say the last time you saw your face here we’d call the cops?” Gid piped up.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re lucky I never pressed any charges against you before.” Remus put a hand on Sirius’ back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Fenrir looked to Remus. “You would’ve done it by now, if you were going to.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus made a noise. “</span>
  <em>
    <span>Oh</span>
  </em>
  <span>, so you realized you actually did something wrong? I think I might faint.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius clenched their teeth. God they were so happy Remus was standing up to him more and not just falling apart but their blood was boiling at Fenrir being here, especially with </span>
  <em>
    <span>Teddy</span>
  </em>
  <span> here. “Am I fucking invisible? Because I’m talking to you, and you’re just ignoring me and hassling my husband and that’s </span>
  <em>
    <span>never</span>
  </em>
  <span> a good combination, Fenrir.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Come on, Re, let’s just set up a time to eat. We can talk everything out.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My </span>
  <em>
    <span>spouse</span>
  </em>
  <span> just asked you a question.” Remus insisted.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Look, we can chat and get a drink. Smooth it all over, whatever you think happened.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“THINK HAPPENED?” Remus shouted then Teddy started to cry. “Fuck you. I’m sorry Teddy, sorry, love.” His voice softened and Sirius felt him move away.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Whatever you think happened</span>
  </em>
  <span>. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Fenrir’s words echoed in Sirius’ head as they stepped forward, their heart hurting with Remus shouting too but god they were so </span>
  <em>
    <span>angry</span>
  </em>
  <span>. They didn’t even </span>
  <em>
    <span>think</span>
  </em>
  <span> before they just punched him square in the nose.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sirius!” Remus’ hand was back on their shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Whoops! Oh no, I’m sorry that something fell and hit you in the face. That shoe was --- flying. Let’s go, I’ll show you out!” Gideon hopped over the front desk.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius barely even </span>
  <em>
    <span>heard</span>
  </em>
  <span> Gideon, going to pull their shoulder out of Remus’ grip. “I swear to god, if you even look at my husband again I will --”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Fenrir growled, his hand pressed over his bloody nose. “Did you just fucking punch me, you tra--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Gideon hold my child so I can fucking--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“NOPE! You, you arsehole, you’re leaving.” Gideon put a hand on Fenrir’s arm, who shook him off, not moving.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Try me,” Fenrir said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius started back for Fenrir again, not caring their knuckles were hurting because they were </span>
  <em>
    <span>seething</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Please someone take my son so I can </span>
  <em>
    <span>finally </span>
  </em>
  <span>give you something you deserve.” Remus pleaded as the doors behind them opened again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not fucking you,” Dorcas complained.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Dorcas, hold Teddy whilst Remus and I kick this arsehole into a bloody pulp,” Sirius said, following behind Gideon as he dragged Fenrir out.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“As much as I would fucking like that I don’t want either of you to go to jail tonight. Slow the fuck down. It’s okay.” Dorcas’ voice was stern as Fenrir tried to shrug Gideon off again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius paused, hearing the Dom in Dorcas’ voice and understanding for a moment why Marlene listened to her. “Get him out of here,” they said, snapping back to reality for a moment and grabbing Remus by the arm.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I could go to jail tonight. It’s fine. I don’t have to work tomorrow.” Remus tried to move forward as Dorcas went to help Gideon.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Remus, think logically,” Dorcas shot him a look. “This piece of shit isn’t worth it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius turned on the spot, trying to block Fenrir from Remus’ sight and putting a hand on Teddy’s back. “Caro, hey. Don’t give him the time of day.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’d feel really fucking good.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know it would. I know. I want to kick his fucking head in for speaking to you like that, but I reckon Dorcas will do something similar.” They bit their lip, glancing down at Teddy, who was looking up at Remus. “Daddy, stop.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus stepped forward but stopped. “I just want…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Teddy and me need you here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I just want to make him hurt like I did,” he whispered.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius bit their lip, all their residual anger slipping away. “I know. You’re better than him though.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus took a deep breath and rubbed Teddy’s back. “I think we need to go home. I’m not sure I can stomach dinner.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Okay. I’ll text your mam.” Sirius peered at him, concerned. “I love you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I love you too.” Remus finally looked to Sirius. “Let’s go home.”</span>
