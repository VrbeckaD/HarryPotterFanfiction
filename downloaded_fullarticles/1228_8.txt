    <p>The decision to move to his mother’s homeland to attend Hogwarts was an easy one. Someday, Claude is going to be Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards, or at least the shadowy figure <em>behind</em> such a person, and he will use his power to destroy prejudice by passing equal rights laws for all sentient magical creatures!</p><p>And busting open the Statute of Secrecy. For reasons. <em>Good </em>reasons too, not that the majority of the wizarding world would understand.</p><p>...But those schemes are still simmering in their cauldrons. They won’t be ready for many, many years. First, he needs to grow up. (Nobody takes children seriously, which is both a blessing and a curse.) He needs an <em>education</em>. While he’s been home-schooled for many years as heirs to prestigious magical lineages almost always are, and while it would be much simpler to attend Uagadou as many of his paternal relatives have done, Claude instead chooses Hogwarts because he needs an education in <em>wand stuff</em>. It’s imperative for the pursuit of his new-found ambitions, for which he has <em>very good reasons</em> even if he can’t quite articulate them all at the moment.</p><p>Here he sits, in an otherwise empty train compartment, with a copy of <em>Hogwarts: A History</em> open before him, becoming slightly frustrated at the lack of information about the sorting ceremony. Claude and the book have been inseparable since he begged his godmother Judith to buy it for him last week on their bonding/shopping trip to Diagon Alley.</p><p>“You’ve grown into a menace,” Judith told him, but bought the book anyway. Even though she saw right through him, Claude counted it as a win. Responsible adults, like Judith when she’s pretending she didn’t become an auror just to beat the shit out of bad guys, can never refuse him when he requests more books. They always sigh and mutter about how there are much worse things a boy his age could be into. At least he’s not developing addictions to sweets or pranks, right? At least he’s not picking fist fights with every other child in sight like his mother did at his age, right? It’s totally fine to spoil him a little if it doubles as fostering intellectual growth.</p><p>The book is written in an unbearably boring way, which is a feat in and of itself. With figures as heroic and legendary as the Founders, Bathilda Bagshot could’ve at <em>least</em> written them a little cooler. Every bit of their lives and the values they wanted to instill in their houses is chronicled down to the most inane detail, yet there is still no mention of how students are chosen for those houses, and <em>that</em> is the root of Claude’s frustration.</p><p>Without knowing how to position himself most advantageously within Hogwarts, how can he begin concocting any contingency plans? How does someone prove to be courageous enough for Gryffindor, for example? Do they have to perform an act of courage, or do the teachers just pick whoever <em>looks</em> brave? Do they have heart-seers in wizarding Britain?</p><p>The compartment door opens as he’s absorbed in this dilemma. Claude jerks his head up to see two other first year students peering in, marked by the lack of house colors on their school robes. They look somewhat similar, both with light hair and delicate features, though the sibling-ish vibe he gets from them is probably more from the way they hold themselves. There’s a stiffness in their motions that Claude has recently come to associate with British purebloods of the really upper crust type – the type Judith flips off behind their backs.</p><p>They look at him a second too long to be comfortable. Actually, the boy seems fine. Or at least human enough. He’s tense and unsure of how to hold himself, just a baby noble in training trying to remember all his etiquette lessons. The girl, though. Her gaze makes Claude feel as if he’s been judged and found terribly wanting.</p><p>“Excuse us. Is this compartment occupied?” she asks anyway.</p><p>Claude shrugs. “Just by me.”</p><p>They exchange a brief look before the boys says, somewhat haltingly, “May we join you?”</p><p>“Sure. I’m Claude, by the way.”</p><p>“Edelgard,” the girl says simply. Once seated, she settles her robes and flicks her hair like a goddamn storybook princess.</p><p>Before entering the compartment and closing the door behind him, the boy bows so stiffly it’s like he’s got a ruler lodged up his behind and straight through the length of his spine. “I’m Dimitri. It’s a pleasure to meet your acquaintance,” he says like a goddamn storybook knight.</p><p>Are these people for real? It’s been said that wizarding Britain is one of the more isolated and conservative magical communities, but it really seems like these two came from five centuries ago. Claude tries to keep smiling politely, but he’s not sure what his expression looks like.</p><p>Edelgard glances at the book, still spread out on the table. “Getting ahead on your schoolwork already?”</p><p>“Oh, this? Nah, I’m just trying to figure out how the sorting will go. My mother wouldn’t tell me, said it should be a surprise. Do <em>you </em>guys know how it works?”</p><p>“I’m not sure,” Dimitri says. “I have an older friend who mentioned that a magical artifact was involved, but he wouldn’t say anything more.”</p><p>“It’s <em>tradition </em>to keep us in the dark.” Edelgard crosses her arms and scoffs. It’s the most human expression Claude has seen on her yet. Huh. Maybe there’s a person in there after all!</p><p>“Well, do you know what house you want to be in? To be honest, I’ve been abroad for most of my life, so I’m not sure which house would be best.”</p><p>Dimitri’s eyes brighten with interest. “Really? I’ve always wanted to travel. I hope you can tell me about the places you’ve been.”</p><p>“Uh… sure?”</p><p>“As for houses, I hope I get into Gryffindor. Not that I think the other houses are bad, but the friend that I mentioned, he’s Gryffindor, and we have some other friends who will probably be Gryffindors too. I want to stay together with everyone.” He looks to Edelgard.</p><p>She’s frowning. “You should have stayed with them, then. With Glenn and Felix and the lot.”</p><p>“I want to spend time with you too, El. You’re my sister.”</p><p>“<em>Step</em>-sister,” Edelgard replies.</p><p>Now they’re both frowning. Seems like Edelgard doesn’t get along with Dimitri’s friends. It’s too early for Claude to be diving into other people’s family drama like this, so he pretends not to notice the tension.</p><p>“You don’t think you’ll be in Gryffindor?” he asks Edelgard.</p><p>“It tends to run in families,” she says. “It doesn’t always work out that way, but most of your values you get from your family. That’s why Dimitri’s friends will most likely be Gryffindors – because his family and theirs have almost always been sorted there.”</p><p>“But not yours?”</p><p>She nods. “It’s a bit mixed on my side, but Ravenclaw and Slytherin, mostly. If you know your family’s history, you can predict your sorting quite accurately. Assuming they’ve been attending Hogwarts for some time, that is.”</p><p>“On my mother’s side, yeah. She was a Gryffindor, but the rest have been Hufflepuff, I think? Huh. That’s really useful. Thanks, Edelgard!”</p><p>The snack cart rolls by then, and they end up sharing chocolates as they chat about classes and quidditch, which Dimitri insists is the best sport ever and it’s apparently a travesty that Claude has been missing out on it.</p><p>They’re not so bad, when they relax. Maybe they can all be friends.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>“I’m not surprised. Nope. Nothing can surprise me anymore,” Claude says. He keeps his eyes resolutely forward, toward the head table where Headmistress Rhea gazes serenely over the student body.</p><p>The Sorting Hat has just finished its song, and Claude wants to scream. His suffering gets a snicker from the redheaded boy next to him, who had been part of the group that ambushed Dimitri once they got off the train. Edelgard is on his other side, using him as a buffer.</p><p>The <em>really </em>uptight-looking Deputy Headmaster, Professor Seteth, begins calling out names.</p><p>“Aegir, Ferdinand!” is the first to go.</p><p>The boy strides up to the stool, chest puffed out. He bellows, “I am Ferdinand von Aegir!” before putting on the hat. Everyone cringes, even Seteth.</p><p>One second passes, then two. Three.</p><p>“Gryffindor!”</p><p>Ferdinand makes his way to his new house table, but not before shooting a very obvious glare at their direction.</p><p>Claude’s not sure who the hatred is for until Edelgard hisses under her breath, “Ugh, <em>why.”</em></p><p>“Holy shit,” Claude whispers to her. “He looks like he’s gonna kill you.”</p><p>“He thinks he’s my rival for some reason.”</p><p>“Arnault, Dorothea” goes to Slytherin after half a minute of consideration. “Bergliez, Caspar” literally runs to the stool and vibrates as he sits. He is pronounced Gryffindor as soon as the first hair of his head touches the hat, before it even lands fully on his head.</p><p>“Blaiddyd, Dimitri!” Professor Seteth bellows.</p><p>“Gryffindor!” the Hat again proclaims. Cheers erupt for him, louder than they had been for the other students. Dimitri blushes and ducks his head as he hurries off to join his house, where he is immediately pulled into a noogie by some older boys.</p><p>Immediately following this, “Dominic, Annette” is the first student sorted into Ravenclaw, and “Edmund, Marianne” the first for Hufflepuff. Dimitri’s three friends, two boys and a girl, look to each other nervously, knowing their turns will come soon.</p><p>The first boy, Felix, spends a fair amount of time under the hat before he, too, is sent to Gryffindor. It seems like Edelgard’s hypothesis is holding up so far.</p><p>Then the girl, Ingrid, is called. She spends an even longer time under the hat. There’s silence for more than a minute, then two. Students start to grow antsy, and Claude can see Ingrid wringing her hands as she holds them in her lap.</p><p>Finally, the hat says, “Ravenclaw!”</p><p>Ingrid’s expression is strange as she leaves for the Ravenclaw table. Her brows are furrowed and her smile is weak, but her shoulders have dropped, relaxed. It’s easy to imagine her feeling both guilty and relieved.</p><p>Dimitri shoots sad and hopeful glances at the remaining boy, who just a moment later responds to Seteth’s shout of “Gautier, Sylvain!”</p><p>Claude shares a small smile with Edelgard. “He didn’t seem very Gryffindor.”</p><p>She raises an eyebrow. “I’d wager he’s not.”</p><p>It takes a while with Sylvain, too. More than Felix but less than Ingrid, about a minute, and then…</p><p>“Slytherin!”</p><p>Claude and Edelgard exchange another knowing glance.</p><p>After that, he zones out for a bit trying to figure out the professors. Some of them look cool, but far too many appear too stern. Hufflepuff, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw – the sorting goes on.</p><p>“Hresvelg, Edelgard!”</p><p>She strides forth with her head held high, eyes cold as ice, the glimpse of humanity Claude had seen gone in an instant. And just as Edelgard had predicted, she goes to Slytherin.</p><p>The spaces to either side of him are now empty. More and more students are called. There’s less than half remaining, then less than a third. It leaves Claude feeling exposed, and he really hasn’t been able to figure anything out. Most students went where they thought they would go, but some of them didn’t.</p><p>Thoughts spiraling, it isn’t long before his name is called and Claude approaches with stomach roiling and face set in what he hopes looks like a carefree smile.</p><p>Here it is. The moment of reckoning.</p><p>The hat is lowered over his head. Claude feels his palms start to sweat.</p><p><em>“I don’t normally say this, but perhaps a little </em>less<em> self-awareness would do you good, young man.”</em></p><p>He jolts! There is a voice <em>inside </em>his head, and somehow that makes him physically straighten up from his slouch. He wishes he could also straighten out the mess in his mind. The Hat is company, after all, and Claude was raised with proper manners even if he likes to pretend otherwise.</p><p><em>“Oh, yes, you’re an interesting one. Yes, I agree your mind </em>is<em> terribly crowded even with yourself as the sole occupant. I can already tell it’s going to take a while with you, but worry not! We’ll get you sorted right as rain.”</em></p><p>The Sorting Hat hems and haws for a bit, and as this is happening Claude shoots rapidly from thought to thought. What charms are on the Sorting Hat? Legilimency charms must be part of it, definitely. Does that make the Hat a legilimens? Does <em>that</em> mean Claude has some natural talent in occlumency? And if a sentient hat can read his thoughts, does that mean it’s hearing all his thoughts as he’s thinking them right this very moment, and does that mean he can… telepathically communicate with it? Does anyone sit down and just have tea with the Hat? Could he have tea with the Hat?</p><p><em>“That’s very kind of you, but I am a </em>sorting<em> hat, dear. I just sort students; I’m not anyone’s therapist.”</em></p><p>Okay, yes, he can telepathically communicate with the hat. And it doesn’t have to be therapy, per se… It’s just such a missed opportunity not to pick the Hat’s ‘mind’ if it’s actually the eldest person-ish being in the entire castle and has intimate knowledge of <em>everyone</em> who ever attended Hogwarts.</p><p>“<em>Only of their eleven year old selves, mind you. I’m sure you already know most eleven year olds are not as mentally advanced as you. And many people, you’ll find, grow up to be very different.”</em></p><p>True. Oh, but the potential blackmail!</p><p>“<em>Well, that about settles you in Slytherin, wouldn’t you say?”</em></p><p>No no, not Slytherin! Not yet!</p><p>“<em>And why not? Those are some very large ambitions I’m seeing. In Slytherin they would be nurtured. Your housemates would gravitate towards such cunning. You could even have minions on which to practice your budding leadership skills.”</em></p><p>Claude takes deep breaths in through his nose and out through his mouth. He tries to get his thoughts in order despite the slight murmuring he can start to hear from the students. So far, no one has been under the hat for this long.</p><p>Slytherin has a less than stellar reputation, that’s true. But Claude wasn’t born and raised here, so it doesn’t matter much to him on an emotional level. It’s not like he’s repulsed by it. If anything, he would fit in <em>too well</em> in the house of cunning, and that’s the problem. Why would the truly cunning people play their cards so openly? The <em>most</em> cunning <em>most </em>ambitious people would hide in another house if they could, and leave Slytherin for the wannabes, even if the thought of so many little snake minions is very tempting.</p><p>If Claude’s going to scheme his way through his school years, he wants to be a Hufflepuff. No one ever suspects the Puffs. Judith was a Puff, and now she beats the shit out of people and gets to blame it all on her Gryffindor colleagues. Plus, they’re loyal to their own just like Slytherins are. He wants Hufflepuff minions.</p><p>“<em>Hufflepuff, eh? A rare first choice. Yes, I can see you’re not afraid of hard work. Your patience and tolerance could find a warm home in the badger’s den. It’s not a lack of Hufflepuff that I see in you, but rather too much of other houses. Hufflepuff would not be best for you.”</em></p><p>What? No? But didn’t Helga Hufflepuff accept every student who wanted to join her house?</p><p>“<em>Not if the other founders had claimed them first!”</em> The hat’s sing-song voice is too chipper as it destroys Claude’s dreams. <em>“They fought over students once in a while, but Helga was always above that.”</em></p><p>Well who would want to call dibs on him then, he wonders. Besides Slytherin, that is. Could he be put in Ravenclaw, Claude thinks to the Hat. Ravenclaw curiosity often got their students in trouble, but it just as easily got them out of it once it was made clear that they were just “being Ravenclaws” in the pursuit of knowledge. Claude could be very Ravenclaw! He schemes a lot, sure, but so far he's done it mostly for <em>books</em>. What’s more Ravenclaw than scheming to get <em>more books</em>? He tries very hard to beam an image of his old bedroom to the Hat, which had maps and star charts and an alchemy array next to the periodic table covering the walls. Piles of books towered over the desk and spilled onto the floor and all around his bed and even everywhere <em>on </em>his bed except for a Claude-shaped space in the middle.</p><p>
  <em>“A Ravenclaw’s sharp mind and love of knowledge you have, and the eagle’s nest could hone your intellect into the greatest weapon. Yet, the truest Ravenclaw seeks knowledge for its own sake, while for you it is a means to an end… a trait worthy only of Sl–”</em>
</p><p>Wait just a moment there! There’s one more house!</p><p>
  <em>“Come now, you must have realized how all your reasoning has had a certain serpentine bent to it? A snake in badger’s or eagle’s or lion’s clothes is still a snake. If anything, this ability you have to so easily shed your skins is the most snake-like of all.”</em>
</p><p>Shush, Hat. There’s one more house. Claude didn’t want to resort to this. He really doesn’t like fighting or declarations of righteousness, but he can roar with the best of them if it comes down to it! His mother is a goddamn warrior goddess even now, and she was so much worse in her youth. She was probably the most Gryffindor person to have come out of that house since Godric himself, and she rampaged across the world looking for duels until she finally found a man who could out-Gryffindor her, and then she immediately <em>married</em> that guy while they were both still sporting busted lips and black eyes. His duel-crazy parents did <em>not</em> raise him to be a coward! Channeling Ferdinand, he shouts into his mind, <em>I AM CLAUDE VON RIEGAN!</em></p><p>
  <em>“...Is that what you really want?”</em>
</p><p>Well… no.</p><p>“SLYTHERIN!”</p><p>Curse you, Hat! Gaining a Hufflepuff army will be so much harder now.</p>
