    <p>“<i>Billy</i>,” his mother called up the steps for the third—and, he was sure from the warning timber in her voice, dangerously close to final—time, “we’re going to be late!”</p>
<p>“<i>I’m coming!</i>” He grit his teeth as he threw open the next drawer, bracing against the inevitable avalanche of comic books, action figures, and general detritus that seemed to collect in every nook and cranny no matter how hard he tried to keep things neat. He was never going to find the diviner in time. Merlin, it wasn’t fair. He’d spent the entire summer daydreaming of going back to school; he’d had his trunks packed and ready to go for <i>weeks</i> now.</p>
<p>And of course, of course, the moment it was time to go to catch the train…he realized he wasn’t ready at all.</p>
<p>“<i>Billy!</i>”</p>
<p>“Come on, come on,” Billy muttered as he dove through the messy drawer, shoving broken quills and mismatched socks aside. Gretl gave a soft trill from her perch, watching him with gold-rimmed eyes. “Ugh, I know,” he said, tossing aside an old dungbomb Tommy had sent two summers ago as a joke. “But if I got rid of things, how would I ever be able to find them when I needed them?”</p>
<p>Gretl trilled again, and he shot her a look. “Stop judging me, please.”</p>
<p>Below, he heard the measured not-quite-a-slam of the front door and a tell-tale tread as his mother moved toward the stairs. It wasn’t quite a stomp, but it wasn’t <i>not</i> a stomp, either. Fuck.</p>
<p>“Okay, you can go back to judging me,” Billy said, shoving the drawer closed and popping to his feet. He looked around the war zone of his bedroom with a helpless sigh. It <i>had</i> been clean this morning, when he’d floated from sleep with the happy realization that today, finally, he’d be catching the Hogwarts Express back to school. Now everything had been dragged out from beneath his bed and the bowels of his closet. Drawers had been emptied. The desk was ransacked. His wardrobe hung open, contents strewn across the floor. He’d turned the entire place upside-down, and <i>still</i> he hadn’t managed to find what he was looking for.</p>
<p>And he was out of time.</p>
<p>He winced as the bedroom door swung open. “<i>William</i>.”</p>
<p>That? Was bad. That was really, really bad. “I can explain,” he said, turning to meet his mother’s eyes. She had on her far-seeing spectacles and her very best robes, under which she wore the dove grey Muggle suit she’d strip down to when they reached the station. Her dark brows were pulled together and her lips were pressed into a thin line as she deliberately swept her gaze across the drifts of old robes and books and letters and comics…then met his eyes again.</p>
<p>A single brow arched.</p>
<p>Billy flushed and ducked his head. “It’s probably not a very <i>good</i> explanation,” he admitted. “But I do have one.”</p>
<p>“It can wait; the train will not.”</p>
<p>He looked back over his room, as if a final, desperate scan could reveal what an hour’s frenzied searching had not. “But…”</p>
<p>“Billy.” His mother held open the door for him, pointedly stepping aside so he could precede her. “Whatever it is, I promise you it isn’t more important than your continued education. Or your continued freedom, because I will ground you for <i>life</i> if you make your brother miss the train his first year. Now <i>move</i>.”</p>
<p>Billy opened his mouth to argue…then sighed, giving up. He was out of time and out of luck. There was no point in asking if she could <i>accio</i> it for him. As a Muggle specialist, his mother strongly believed in using alternative methods for everyday life—which essentially translated into <i>no magic</i> for ordinary tasks other households took for granted. Billy lived in the only pureblood home in London where he and his brothers were expected to make their beds and wash the dishes <i>themselves</i>. It was so unfair.</p>
<p>Life was unfair.</p>
<p>He was being dramatic, but <i>whatever!</i> Still unfair!</p>
<p>“Billy,” his mother said, that warning note back in her voice.</p>
<p>“Okay, fine,” he muttered under his breath. He lifted one hand, barely waiting until he felt the whisper-light weight of Gretl taking up perch on his curled fingers before he was stomping out into the hall. The paintings that lined the stairwell muttered to each other as he stalked past, but he ignored them. They’d been <i>muttering</i> all summer, ever since he and his brother Daniel had come back from school with stories of Harry freaking Potter and all the craziness that seemed to follow in his wake.</p>
<p>His father was outside, loading the last of the luggage into the cab. The cabbie kept stealing glances as massive trunk after trunk was packed into the modest-sized boot, but he held his tongue (though his eyes, Billy couldn’t help but notice, had gone comically wide). Andy and Daniel had already piled in, elbowing each other as they fought for the window. The day was clear and hot.</p>
<p>And the Hogwarts Express was waiting to take him back for his final year of school.</p>
<p>Billy sucked in a breath and let it out slowly, beginning to smile. Okay, so Tommy would have his head for forgetting the diviner. Whatever. There were other, better ways to go about their plan. There was a whole school of people who could help them, too—Kate and Eli and David and <i>all</i> the friends he barely got to see over the summer. And if he got really desperate, there were even adults, too.</p>
<p>He startled when his mother snapped the door shut behind them and cast him a steady, significant look.</p>
<p>…yeah, maybe best not include adults after all.</p>
<p>Billy hurried down the steps to squeeze his way into the cab, shoving aside Daniel with a single bony elbow and holding Gretl carefully aloft as his brothers tried to elbow him back. Dad slid into the front seat and Mother slipped in on Billy’s other side, closing the door with a decisive <i>snap</i>.</p>
<p>“Good morning,” she said, leaning close to yell through the plastic divider. “Could you take us to the train station?”</p>
<p>She began to lean back, satisfied, then suddenly pressed forward again. “Oh,” his mother added, tapping a nail against the clear barrier. “And would you step upon it, please?”</p>
<p>“Uhhh. Right.” The cabbie adjusted the small box sitting on his dash, and bright green numbers appeared. The car drifted slowly into the flow of traffic.</p>
<p>Billy tipped his head toward his mother’s. “I think it’s <i>step on it</i>,” he murmured, <i>sotto</i>.</p>
<p>She frowned. “Are you sure?”</p>
<p>“Think so.”</p>
<p>“Oh.” She considered that, then suddenly laughed and gave a wry shake of her head. “Well, I suppose you’re the expert. Though Merlin knows <i>I’m</i> the one who should know these things by now.”</p>
<p>Billy grinned back, ignoring his brothers as they began trying to buckle themselves in with a single seatbelt. He was going back to <i>Hogwarts</i>; there was nothing that could ruin today. “And when we see Tommy,” he murmured to Gretl, rubbing a finger along the pygmy owl’s tiny brow and grinning when she pressed into the caress with a flutter, “we can tell him to suck it, yeah?”</p>
<p>She trilled in response.</p>
<p>“…yeah, I’m sorry,” the Muggle said, voice rising in pitch with each word. “But is that an <i>owl</i> back there?”</p>

</center><p> The station was swarming with kids when Billy finally pushed through the magical barrier, shouted greetings and exclamations almost loud enough to drown out the rumble of the engine. He froze for a moment just to take it all in—the dizzying swoop of color, the kids in states of half-dress, familiar striped ties waving like banners—before Andy came barreling through the barrier behind him, clipping Billy’s heels with the front of his luggage rack.</p>
<p>“Ow!” Billy snapped, turning on his brother. In her delicate silver cage (where he’d reluctantly placed her after the Muggle cabbie had begun shouting about health violations or something), Gretl ruffled her feathers and huffed a musical sigh. “Watch where you’re going, jerkface.”</p>
<p>“Watch where you’re <i>standing</i>, buttmunch,” Andy sing-songed back, but he was pulling to a stop next to Billy, eyes widening more and more with each second that ticked by. He’d come to Station 9 ¾ many times over the last few years to wave goodbye to Billy, and then Billy-and-Daniel, but this was the first time he’d actually be boarding the Hogwarts Express himself.</p>
<p>Billy began to grin, warming at the expression on his little brother’s face. “It’s even cooler inside,” he promised.</p>
<p>Andy blinked up at him, visibly overwhelmed—then began to grin back. But before he could say anything, Daniel came barreling into <i>both</i> of them, ruining rare moment of brotherly bonding. “Hey!” Andy squawked, trying to leap away.</p>
<p>Gretl gave a warning trill and Billy sighed in disgust, pushing his trolley forward and leaving his brothers to take swipes at each other. Their parents had already said their goodbyes near the car—Andy’s request, since he didn’t want to start his first year trying to dodge any embarrassingly public scenes—and with Daniel begrudgingly taking Andy under his wing, Billy was free to load up his luggage and find his friends.</p>
<p>If they didn’t find him first.</p>
<p>And considering one of those friends was Tommy? They almost always found him first.</p>
<p>“<i>Hey, dorkface!</i>”</p>
<p>Billy ducked out of pure instinct, but he wasn’t fast enough to escape the solid <i>smack</i> of Tommy’s hand catching him lightly upside the head. It seemed like no matter <i>how</i> quickly he tried to dart away, there was no avoiding the stupid Quidditch star’s stupidly fast reflexes. Billy twisted around to glower at his friend, but Tommy was already darting around the trolley to croon at Gretl, prying open her delicate cage and lifting her free before Billy could protest. “Hey, pretty girl,” he said in a low voice, grinning when she closed her eyes and ruffled her feathers in greeting. “How was your summer? Oh, and you too, Billy.” He glanced over, then winked.</p>
<p>Billy sighed. “You’re such an asshole,” he said without any real heat. “Help me with my trunk?”</p>
<p>“Sorry,” Tommy said, skipping back a step. “My hands are full with Gretl. You know,” he added to Billy’s owl, tone serious, “you should consider switching owners. I’ve got his stupid face, after all, and you’d look <i>much</i> better in red-and-gold.”</p>
<p>“Stop trying to corrupt my owl,” Billy protested, even as he hoisted up his trunk. Wow, it was heavy. What exactly had he packed in this thing again? “It’s never going to work. She’s loyal to the, <i>oof</i>, end.”</p>
<p>Tommy smirked. “Don’t you listen to the Sorting Hat, loser? You’re not <i>loyal</i>. You’re sneaky and conniving and terrible and destined to lose the House Cup yet again.”</p>
<p>Billy shifted the improbable weight of his trunk, frowning at his blood brother over it. They’d met their first year at Hogwarts—Billy from a long line of Purebloods, Tommy from a Muggle family that <i>still</i> wasn’t exactly sure where their son wandered off to for most of the year. It’d been a shock to look up across the lurching carriage to see his mirror image staring back, pale where he was dark but otherwise identical. It’d been even more of a shock when the other boy had opened his mouth and pure brassy, Manchester bray came tumbling out, every other word a curse.</p>
<p>They still hadn’t managed to pry out more than a week, “Well, yes, you were adopted after… <i>After</i>,” from Billy’s parents (Tommy’s were completely useless), but they were getting closer to figuring out who their birth mother was. And after six years of putting up with Tommy—and watching as Tommy gentled into someone almost worth getting along with for more than five minutes at a time—they’d almost reached a point where they didn’t rub each other raw.</p>
<p>Almost.</p>
<p>“I thought we weren’t going to get into any of that crap this year?” Billy said. Tensions between Houses were at an all-time high. “You’d leave it in your Common Room and I’d do the same.”</p>
<p>Tommy scowled. “You should just defect too,” he said. “You’re practically the only decent Slytherin in the castle. Everyone knows that the rest of your lot are all dark-crazed followers of—”</p>
<p>Billy growled and stalked away…as much as the ponderous weight of his trunk would let him stalk, anyway. Trust Tommy to dig into open wounds at the very first opportunity. “We agreed not to talk about it,” he said, aware of his twin trotting along at his heels. Billy shifted his grip and moved doggedly toward where luggage was being stored. “Which means we’re <i>not going to talk about it.</i> And besides, I— Oh, thanks,” he added, cutting off his tirade and blinking in surprise when the trunk was lifted easily from his hands.</p>
<p>Like it weighed nothing at all.</p>
<p>America gave him a one-shouldered shrug, hoisting his trunk up to join the others. Her hair was pulled back in a no-nonsense ponytail and she was barely breaking a sweat, even as she hoisted up trunk after trunk. “You looked like a snail about to get crushed by its own shell,” she said. “Hey, Tommy.”</p>
<p>“Hey, yourself. Tell Billy he needs to defect to Gryffindor.”</p>
<p>Her dark gaze moved between them, then she snorted. “Fuck no,” she said, turning away to grab the bags off another unsuspecting kid. “I’m not getting involved. See if you can loop the Princess into your scheme…<i>if</i> you can track her down.”</p>
<p>“Right,” Tommy agreed cheerfully enough. He slung an arm around Billy’s neck, shoving Billy’s (also heavy) travel satchel into his arms before steering him toward the nearest carriage. “See you around then.”</p>
<p>America just grunted; Tommy shook his head. “I’m pretty sure she likes you more than she likes me.”</p>
<p>“I’m pretty sure everyone likes me more than they like you,” Billy shot back, looping the leather handles over one arm and freeing up his other hand for Gretl to flit over to. “Case in point.”</p>
<p>“Your stupid crush likes me a <i>lot</i> more than he likes you,” Tommy pointed out, letting go of Billy as he vaulted up into the waiting train. “Of course,” he added, turning in the doorway to grin down at him—<i>cruelly</i>, because Tommy could be such an asshole sometimes— “that’s not hard since he barely knows you exist. And hey, pop quiz: <i>why</i> does he barely know you exist?”</p>
<p>Billy climbed up after him, scowling. “Is this going to be multiple choice or long-form essay?” he muttered.</p>
<p>“Because you practically <i>run away</i> every time he comes around.”</p>
<p>“See, it’s not actually a quiz if you’re going to answer the question for me.” But Tommy wasn’t really listening—he had already plowed on ahead, leading the way to their usual compartment. Billy sighed and followed in his wake, wending his way past eagerly shouting kids. He glanced out an open door just in time to spot both of his brothers making their way onto the train—great, okay, he could tell his mother he’d seen them safely aboard without actually fibbing—then barely dodged a swooping paper airplane (complete with industriously buzzing propeller) as it dove by.</p>
<p>Billy glanced over his shoulder to watch it go, but quickly refocused when he nearly ran into Tommy, who had stopped just before their usual door. “Sorry,” Billy mumbled; Tommy just waved him off. He was talking in a low voice with David, who’d already changed into his robes and looked—somehow, like always—immaculate. The prefect badge was pinned to his breast, and he was laughing as he knocked Tommy’s hands aside every time Billy’s brother tried reaching for it.</p>
<p>“Why don’t you get your own, Speedy?” David said. “Maybe that way I can stop having to look the other way while you cause trouble.”</p>
<p>“You never look the other way, <i>Brainy</i>,” Tommy sassed back. “Mostly because you’re usually neck-deep in it with me.”</p>
<p>“Which, I’ll remind you, is almost always <i>your</i> fault. Hi, Billy,” David added.</p>
<p>Billy shifted the bag on his arm and gave an awkward little wave. “Hey. How was your summer?”</p>
<p>David shrugged. “I can’t complain. I’ll try to come back to visit after we’ve got everyone settled. Eli and Kate are running a tight ship this year. And <i>you</i>,” David added to Tommy, snagging his elbow and dragging him further down the aisle. He lowered his voice as he went, so Billy could only make out a trailing, “need to keep your eyes open for Harry Potter and his…”</p>
<p>Billy tipped his head, watching them go and feeling an odd weight settle inside at the way he had been so casually excised from the conversation. Sure, David was more Tommy’s friend than his—and fine, it really wasn’t any of his business—but sometimes…</p>
<p>Sometimes it seemed as if his friends kept things from him on purpose. As if they gently and subtly reoriented their conversations whenever one drifted to anything more serious than Quidditch or the House Cup or who was pairing off with who. Like somehow, despite six years together, over the last strange year with the Boy Who Lived settled in their midst Billy had become the enemy.</p>
<p>And that? That sucked.</p>
<p>He frowned down at his feet, ignoring Gretl’s soft chirrup, and reached blindly for the doorknob. Billy pushed inside the train compartment he and his friends usually claimed and slung his bag blindly toward the leftmost seat…barely missing clipping <i>Teddy Altman</i> on its way.</p>
<p>Teddy looked up with a start, head poking through the collar of his shirt. He had his school slacks on, Muggle jeans bundled up at his feet, but his chest was bare and golden-tan and <i>muscular</i>, abs tightening as he paused mid-pulling on his white undershirt. His blond hair was tousled, silver earrings catching the light.</p>
<p>His eyes, when they met Billy’s, were unfairly blue.</p>
<p>“Oh, hey,” Teddy said, rich Scottish brogue lilting as he kicked one corner of his mouth up into a welcome smile. “Sorry—Tommy said you guys wouldn’t mind if I swapped over in here.”</p>
<p>His yellow-and-black tie was wound around one hand and wrist like boxer’s tape. A dimple was flashing at the corner of his mouth. He was <i>still mostly naked and talking to him</i> and <i>oh Merlin</i> Billy was not in any way prepared for the desperate swooping of his stomach, or the way his heart began to pound triple-time or…</p>
<p>Or pretty much anything that always, always seemed to happen if the Hufflepuff Quidditch captain so much as looked his way.</p>
<p>“Um,” he said, because <i>words</i>. But none seemed to want to come. His tongue was cleaving to the roof of his mouth, and Teddy’s muscles rippled as he finally tugged down his shirt, and oh wow, hey, no, Billy’s brain was officially <i>done</i>.</p>
<p>So he did the only thing he could reasonably be expected to do when faced with the half-naked man of his dreams: he fumbled blindly for the door, stepped back out into the aisle, and slammed it shut behind him.</p>
<p>Billy stared blankly at the closed door for a long, horrified moment. His cheeks were flushed hot; his pulse was racing. His thoughts felt like bludgers and, oh Merlin, <i>what had he done?</i> Teddy probably assumed he was absolutely mental now.</p>
<p>Gretl gave a soothing coo as she flitted to his shoulder, tiny beak brushing through the hairs at his temple. Billy let his head drop forward, eyes squeezing shut as waves and waves of hot mortification…and slow, insidious, creeping <i>interest</i>…washed through him. Impossibly gorgeous, impossibly kind, impossibly <i>impossible</i> Teddy Altman was in his train car right now, half-dressed. He was maybe going to stay and hang out for the entire trip. That meant hours of sitting in a cramped train car with Teddy, trying not to stare at him, trying to untangle his tongue enough to talk, trying to look like something other than the utter and complete dork he was.</p>
<p>There was no way he’d succeed.</p>
<p>No, even worse. There was no way he’d make it through alive. Just one smile and he’d melt to the floor, and Tommy would be there to witness (and mock) the whole thing and, aw, <i>crap</i>.</p>
<p>Billy gave a choked, almost-hysterical laugh and resisted the urge to bang his forehead against the door. “You may not realize this, Gretl,” he murmured as the Hogwarts Express sounded its warning whistle. “But I am so, so unbelievably screwed.”</p>
