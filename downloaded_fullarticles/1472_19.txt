  <em>Waiting In A Chair With Chains</em>
</p>
<p>A Hero now, and saviour then, before<br/>
But not of mine, my home was dark and yet<br/>
A twist, a scream, and you were out the door<br/>
You left me there, with time upon my head.</p>
<p>I handed you your wand! And hers! My own!<br/>
What more could I have given you, my heart?<br/>
I was innocent and you must have known<br/>
I'd needed you to play the hero's part</p>
<p>You saw me in the battle, I was scared<br/>
Saw my alliances were not with Death<br/>
My mother risked her life to see you spared<br/>
So spare, in turn, her son, her life, her breath?</p>
<p>So will you come and save me, Chosen One?<br/>
Or is my life of freedom gone and done?</p>
