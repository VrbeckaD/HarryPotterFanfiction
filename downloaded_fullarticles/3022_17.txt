    <p>Headcannon 1 - James and Sirius:<br/></p>
<p>James and Sirius were introduced by Sirius' mother. James Potter was pure-blooded and rich. The kind of friend her son, a Black, should have. James disliked his mother, instantly as she had warned Sirius not to befriend mudbloods.</p>
<p>"I don't like your family," James said, as soon as the train started.</p>
<p>"Well, I don't like them either," Sirius said, smiling.</p>
<p>That's how they first met each other.</p>
