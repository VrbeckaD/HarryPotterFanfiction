    <p>Disclaimer: All the characters and situations of the Harry Potter universe belong to JKR.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Hermione Granger thought she had everything in her life. All her immediate goals were achieved. Voldemort was burst into pieces at the hands of her best friend. The wizarding world was finally living at peace. Muggleborns were now being treated with much respect and love. Her work towards all the magical beings had been distinguished by the ministry, and the minister himself had asked her to join the department of magical law enforcement.</p>
<p>Coming to her personal life, she couldn't have been happier. Her parents have finally accepted her back into their lives and have given their blessing to continue her life in the magical world. And as for her love life, Ron had taken the plunge and got down on one knee. As any other girl, she had thought she didn't need anything else in her happy life. But what was that nagging feeling of emptiness that tugged at her heart? Why was she missing that sheer bliss of contentment?</p>
<p>The cool nightly breeze hit her face as she stepped out of the door. She stood on the doorstep relishing the teasing wisps of the cool air. She kept her eyes closed trying to calm her mind. But it didn't work. She sighed as her bare feet moved onto the gravel.</p>
<p>Her eyes darted to the marquee that was set up. It was magnificent against the beautiful night backdrop. Of course, it would be. After all, that is the place where two weddings of the century are going to take place. She slightly shook her head with a smile. She heard a small splash and her head whipped to see where it came from, while her hand moved to her pockets searching for the wand. Moody and his motto of constant vigilance got ingrained into her brain. But the familiar silhouette against the moonlight, near the stream, relaxed her.</p>
<p>"Just the person I needed," she mumbled sitting down next to him. "Don't worry, I won't let Ginny know that you broke her rule of separation till the wedding."</p>
<p>"Why am I not surprised," he said smiling. He was barefoot too. His Jeans were folded to the knees and his toes were playing with the water. "Finally it got to your nerves, huh?" He asked her giving his trademark roguish wink.</p>
<p>"You know me so well. Molly had finally given up urging us to have a good sleep for at least few hours. She had managed to drag Ginny for her beauty sleep. I agree it is almost dawn, and she was concerned for tomorrow. But I couldn't take it anymore," Hermione said mirroring his posture, welcoming the lovely sensation of water on her feet. "Ready for tomorrow?"</p>
<p>He looked back at the Marquee and sighed. "It seems elaborate."</p>
<p>"It is a bit," Hermione said watching a particular ripple that went particularly farther. "But you deserve it."</p>
<p>"I may deserve but do I really want it?" He chuckled and turned to her. "Did you ever imagine we would be getting married like this?"</p>
<p>"Every girl is entitled to her own dreams," Hermione said revisiting her childhood thoughts of her walking down the aisle in a white gown to the mysterious person waiting for her. She expected the mysterious person will be sporting red hair and long freckled nose by now, but he still remained cryptic. "But no, I didn't. It's definitely strange now I come to think of it, " she answered.</p>
<p>He nodded silently at her answer, his gaze fixed on the ripples in the water, glinting in the moonlight. He remained unusually solemn. Warning bells went off, in Hermione's head. She concernedly put her hands on his chin and turned his face towards her, "Something wrong, Harry?"</p>
<p>"Mmhm, nothing," Harry said turning back to the water.</p>
<p>"You know, you can tell me anything?" Hermione asked cupping his cheek.</p>
<p>"Can I? Now you're going to be someone else's," Harry asked his emerald eyes boring into hers. "I can't expect you to come running towards me when I'm in need of you."</p>
<p>Hermione laughed at his words. "You're joking right." But when Harry didn't laugh, she stiffened. "Harry, how can you say that? Your friendship's the most important thing in my life. Ron understands that. And I don't belong to anyone but myself." Hermione's eyes widened with a sudden realization. "Did Ron say anything about it? Do I need to go to the Grimmauld place and give him a lecture about the semantics of our relationship?"</p>
<p>"What are you going to do if I said he did?" Harry asked with a smirk.</p>
<p>"He clearly knows not to mess with me, on that topic. We had a very detailed discussion about that," Hermione said smugly. "So you listen to me, Harry Potter. Don't you ever keep doubts of that nature under this mop of hair," she said ruffling his hair. Harry leaned into his hand into her ministrations. Hermione smiled at the charming innocence of his gesture. "I'll always be there."</p>
<p>"Thanks! Hermione," Harry said taking her hand into his. "For everything."</p>
<p>Hermione smiled blushing at the words of his gratitude. "There's no need for that, Harry."</p>
<p>His hand found its place on her shoulders, as he pulled her closer to him. Hermione sighed at the familiar gesture and leaned her head on his shoulder. Harry Potter had become physically affectionate since he killed Voldemort. He needed that reassurance after seeing so many loved ones' death. "I came here directly from Godric's Hollow," he mumbled.</p>
<p>"Oh! Harry, I would've accompanied you," Hermione said lifting her head and looking into his eyes. "I understand how tough it would have been for you."</p>
<p>"I needed some alone time with them," Harry said as his gaze was now fixed on the crooked house, that had been his first home in this wizarding world. "I wanted their blessing for what I'm going to do."</p>
<p>Hermione agreed with a little nod. "They will always be here with you. Not only them, Dumbledore, Sirius, Remus, Tonks, everybody will be here tomorrow and not to forget, Snape," she finished teasingly.</p>
<p>"I'm not talking about tomorrow," Harry said looking at her.</p>
<p>"Harry," Hermione said in a warning tone. "You are freaking me out. Tell me what it is."</p>
<p>Harry's green eyes twinkled for a moment as the hand on her shoulder moved to her neck. "I'm not sorry for doing this," he whispered.</p>
<p>Before registering what was about to happen, his lips softly touched hers. He dissolved her sudden gasp as his fingers followed their way into her wild hair. She slowly realized he was kissing her and she wasn't pulling back. This was Harry and she shouldn't do this. But it felt so right and good that she started kissing him back. She heard him growl at her advances as he took her lips with more intensity.</p>
<p>Her mind was swirling with a plethora of emotions. Her fingers were boring holes into the sides of his shirt. She didn't realize when she had opened her mouth to his ministrations as his tongue possessively took hold of hers. His arms now moved to her waist as he pulled her into his lap, but not for one moment his lips didn't leave hers.</p>
<p>Panting they came apart, but their foreheads kept touching. Hermione opened her eyes to see Harry was looking straight at her. "Do you feel that?"</p>
<p>The word 'what' that formed in her brain stopped, before reaching her lips as she realized what he was asking? The missing piece of her puzzle, the feeling of contentment she had been missing, the sheer bliss she craved her, was right there in front of her. In her best friend, she thought of as her brother.</p>
<p>She nodded with a teary smile. He slowly took her hand and placed it on his chest. The reverberations of his heartbeat under his skin made her hand tingle. "We're soulmates, Hermione."</p>
<p>"How did you know?" Hermione whispered as her heart started palpitating.</p>
<p>"Dumbledore told me," Harry said dropping his eyes to the ground. "He told me when I met him after Voldemort hit me with that killing curse."</p>
<p>Hermione's heart dropped into her stomach. With a wave anger flowing through her veins, "How could you do this to me, Harry?" She screamed catching him by his collar.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry. There's no excuse. I thought you were happy and I tried to find what you had. But I couldn't anymore. Just the mere thought of losing you forever made me hurt so much. Hermione, please try to understand."</p>
<p>As soon as those words came out of his mouth, two rays of blue glowing light emanated from both of their hearts. They were warm and naughty. They surrounded them and tickled them. The rays slowly rose into the air bathing them in an ethereal glow and filling their hearts with warmth.</p>
<p>But as suddenly as they came and danced around them, they dived into the stream vanishing into the water, leaving the pair in shock.</p>
<p>"Whatever it was, wicked," Harry said gaping at the place the light had disappeared. Before Hermione's instincts kicked in, a faint sound of rumbling started and she caught onto his hand for support. Harry pushed her behind him, placing himself between her and the water. A fierce whirlpool had appeared almost immediately.</p>
<p>Harry and Hermione looked at each other in panic and started running back. But the tendrils of blue light emerged from the whirlpool and advanced towards the running pair.</p>
<p>Hermione gave a glance back and gasped as they rays were almost onto them.</p>
<p>"Hermione, don't stop," Harry yelled back pulling her close to him.</p>
<p>They were almost up to the door when Hermione had fallen face first into the ground. The rays have got hold of her foot and were slowly dragging her back into the stream. Hermione cried loudly clawing at them, trying to get free.</p>
<p>Harry stopped and looked at her and anger flashing in his eyes. He put his arms around her waist and pulled her against him kicking the light rays with his feet. But he didn't see What Hermione saw in the next moment.</p>
<p>"Look out," Hermione screeched as the rays now enclosed both of them. Hermione looked in panic while Harry tried to fight in vain at that offending light.</p>
<p>"Harry, what's happening to us?" Hermione asked in tears as all their efforts turned futile. They were now almost in the stream. Both their eyes turned to the Burrow. There was no light in there clearly stating that all the people inside were unaware of what was happening just a few feet away.</p>
<p>"I'll protect you, Hermione," Harry spoke in determination pulling her into his embrace, as they were sucked into the vacuum of the whirlpool.</p>
