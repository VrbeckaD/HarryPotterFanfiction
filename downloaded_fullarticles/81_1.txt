    <p>“Are you ready?” Hermione asked with a sad sort of smile as she fixed Harry’s tie. </p><p>Harry gave her an exasperated look. “Am I ready? Are you serious? Of course I’m not ready! I don’t want to be here. This is the last thing I’d ever want, Hermione. I thought you’d know this!” </p><p>Hermione wasn’t shocked by Harry’s outburst. He’d been like this all morning. At least he showed an emotion besides a mind-numbing expressionless mood that seemed to haunt everyone around him for the past month.</p><p>“I know, Harry, I just want to make sure you’re ok. I know this is really hard for you, I can’t imagine it would be anything but. I love you Harry, and I’ll always be here for you.”</p><p>“Me too, mate. You know we’ve always got your back. We’re the golden trio!” Ron had joined them, munching on a sandwich that he’d probably snagged from one of the hors d’oeuvres trays. </p><p>Harry sighed and rubbed his temples. He’d been dreading this day for weeks; ever since he’d heard what he’d have to do. He’d considered running away, hiding from everybody and everything, somewhere no one would find him. But of course, he couldn’t do that. Not to all those that had helped him: the Weasleys, who made him apart of their family, Hermione who constantly helped him in school and was always such a big supporter of his, and all those parental figures that took on such big roles in his life, ones that were never quite filled by those he needed most. </p><p>But now, he was dressed in a high quality, expensive suit, in a marvellously grand hotel, stuck with the worst, most impossible task he’d never thought possible. He was engaged to marry Draco Malfoy. Someone he could only think of as a disgustingly prideful, horrible, rude git who did nothing but bring anger and annoyance into Harry’s life. He hated this boy with a passion. But, nevertheless, his fate was sealed, or soon to be sealed, all because of a stupid prophecy. </p><p>——</p><p>1 month earlier</p><p>Harry was walking to the Gryffindor common room after transfiguration, planning to spend his spare period there before lunch. Hermione said she had to talk to McGonagall about the essay they were given and what the particular outline was for it, and ways she could go above and beyond (its Hermione, what would you expect?), and Ron had stayed with her. They promised to meet him there when they were done. So, as he was strolling along the empty corridors (the next period had already started) to their nearby common room, he passed by Proffessor Trelawney, which was odd, seeing as he rarely ever saw her outside her classroom and maybe the great hall for meals, especially since it was during a period. Still, he nodded politely at the batty woman. She had a flash of a weird look pass across her features before she stopped and turned to him. Recognizing this as a sign that someone wants to talk to him, Harry stopped and turned to her with a question on his tongue. But before he could speak, a raspy, echoing voice sounded the halls that wasn’t anything like her regular airy voice. </p><p>“The hate and anger that courses through the air when you two meet, hides what truly lies beneath. You will end up with the one you least expect, signing off on old magic will be the cause for you to connect. Do not heed this as a warning, but a guide, that you will need the boy with blond hair and grey eyes.”</p><p>She blinked a few times, shook her head, and as if coming back to the present greeted him like nothing just happened, and continued down the corridor. </p><p>Harry, confused and a little scared, raced off to the common room and waited for his friends to arrive. </p><p>“What do you think it all means?” He asked Ron and Hermione after he told them all he could remember from what the proffessor had revealed to him. </p><p>“Well, she told you not to heed this as a warning, but a guide. I mean, I’m definitely curious, but I wouldn’t be too worried if I were you.” Hermione said, taking out her homework from her bag. </p><p>“Well what should I do? Who do you think she was referring too? Blonde hair and grey eyes?” Harry was really sketched out by this and the fact that Hermione wasn’t all over this was quite concerning. </p><p>Ron just snorted. “Mate, are you that daft? Who do we know that you hate and makes you angry, with blond hair and grey eyes?”</p><p>Harry’s eyes widened as the realization dawned on him. “You seriously don’t think... it could not be .... MALFOY?!” He sat there, mouth gaping and brows furrowed. </p><p>“The one and only.” Ron smirked and took out his work. “Look, mate, we can go to her class later and ask her about it, maybe she’ll remember, or know something more, ok?” Harry could tell Ron was trying to be supportive and helpful, more than Hermione who was muttering away at her potions assignment. </p><p>“I seriously doubt she will. Just the way she looked at me after, it was like nothing even happened.”</p><p>Ron sighed then thought for a moment. Harry nodded towards his girlfriend with a questioning look, who was currently chewing the end of her quill into pieces. Ron saw what he was looking at and said “She hates Trelawney. More specifically divination. How ‘bout we go to Dumbledore tonight instead?” Ron had started listing the ingredients for a Pepper Up potion, so Harry decided to leave him to it. </p><p>“I think I’ll just go now.” He said sadly. His friends were always to busy for him. </p><p>As he made his way to Dumbledore’s office, he tried to remember everything Trelawney had said to him so he could tell his headmaster what happened as accurately as possible. </p><p>When he got to the eagle and muttered the password - fizzing wizbees- he was taken up to the door and let into the office. </p><p>“Ah, Harry, I was wondering when you’d come to visit me.” Dumbledore said with a large grin on his face. </p><p>Harry sat down in the chair in front of the desk and sighed deeply. </p><p>“What is it my boy?” Dumbledore asked, concerned. </p><p>“I, well, Proffessor Trelawney stopped me in the hall today and said something to me. I’m just confused with what it means and what’s going to happen.”</p><p>Dumbledore looked thoughtful for a moment. “She told you a prophecy.” He didn’t phrase it as a question.</p><p>“I believe so, sir. I would like to know what it means.”</p><p>“Do you remember what she said?”</p><p>“Something about me uniting with someone that I hate and makes me angry, signing off on old magic, and not to heed it as a warning but a guide. Oh, and he has blond hair and grey eyes.” He left out the part about how he thinks that its about him and Malfoy. </p><p>Naturally though, Dumbledore caught on. </p><p>“I believe the prophecy is based around you and Mr Malfoy, and you think this as well, I presume?” </p><p>Harry nodded. </p><p>“Very well. I will need to speak with Professor Trelawney, and I will call you and Mr Malfoy back here after lunch. Is there anything else you wish to tell me?” Dumbledore asked, writing on a piece of parchment. </p><p>“Er, yes. Afterwords, she seemed to fall out of some sort of trance, and acted as if nothing happened. I doubt you’ll get much from her, but I am very curious about what this all means.”</p><p>“Ah, well, in that case, we might need to use a pensieve memory. But, that will come after lunch. Now, don’t you have a potions assignment to start?” He said with a knowing glint in his eyes. </p><p>Harry smiled gratefully and left the office. On his way back to the common room, he couldn’t help but wonder - why? </p><p>——</p><p>“They’re ready for you soon.” A man Harry had seen running around the building during wedding preparations but didn’t bother learning his name, announced as he peaked into the room. </p><p>“Ok, we’ll be down there shortly.” Hermione said politely, giving the man his cue to leave. </p><p>Harry’s throat suddenly became too tight to breathe. He loosened his tie then immediately the distinct feeling of prickling started behind his eyes. He blinked back the tears that threatened to fall, still trying to get air into his lungs. As soon as Ron and Hermione noticed, worry etched into their features. As they sat him down in a nearby chair, trying to calm him down, he stood abruptly and started pacing around the vast expanse of the room. He managed to remove his tie - why was it so tight?! - but he still had trouble getting air to his oxygen deprived lungs. Hermione and Ron’s pleading voices for him to calm down drowned out in the rush of blood he heard in his ears. </p><p>He ripped off his jacket, suddenly his skin feeling hot and prickly, and started undoing the buttons of his shirt as he was sure that’s what has causing him to suffocate. But nothing seamed to work. He began pulling at his hair because his body failed at trying desperately to get air to fill his aching lungs, when a pair of strong arms wrapped around his torso, supporting his buckling knees and bringing his body back to the present. The stuttering thumping of his heart beat slowly faded out as worry-stricken voices took its place, trying to get his attention. </p><p>“Harry! Oh my gosh Harry, please!” It was Hermione. She was crying. </p><p>“C’mon mate, come back to us. That’s it.” Ron, he knew, was closer to him. As he blinked warily, he realized that it was Ron who was holding him up. His eyelids seemed heavier than he thought, and his brain was pounding proudly within its confines of his skull. </p><p>“I’m going to get him some water. Sit him up in the chair, Ron.” Hermione voice sounded frantic. </p><p>“Good idea. Boy’s heavier than he looks.” Ron said with a grunt. </p><p>As his back hit the soft cushion of the arm chair, he realized he was breathing. The cool air soothing his burning insides brought him back fully to consciousness. He looked into Ron’s worried blue eyes and nodded, confirming that he was okay. He sat up, readjusted himself as Hermione rushed back into the room with a glass of water and what looked like a wet face towel. </p><p>“Oh, Harry. Are you alright? What happened? You really scared us.” She said, placing the cup in his hand and wiped his face clean of tears and sweat. </p><p>“Yeah, ‘Mione, I’m ok.” He took a sip of the water, clearing his throat of the harsh feeling left behind. </p><p>“What happened? Why’d you panic all of a sudden.” </p><p>Harry glanced at Ron, begging him to help him. Ron knew about Harry’s panic attacks - he’s had them ever since third year at Hogwarts. Ron always helped him with them, and he knew by now that the only thing that really helped pull Harry out was contact. Warm, comforting, bodily contact really helped bring Harry back. </p><p>“‘Mione, now’s not the time. I’ll tell you later. They’re expecting him.” Ron said. He stood and gathered the clothing Harry had strewn across the room in his attempt for relief. </p><p>Hermione continued to insist on being told what had just happened, but as Ron helped get Harry ready again, and Harry practically sat slumped in the chair, Hermione was at a loss and began helping as well. </p><p>The trio didn’t speak again until Harry was once again dressed in his expensive suit, hair combed and fixed, and breathing deeply to Ron’s administrations.</p><p>Once they were ready, they stopped at the  doors and looked at each other. </p><p>“Well, this is it.” Hermione said. </p><p>“Yeah.” Harry whispered. </p><p>“Good luck, mate. You know we’re here for you.” Ron said reassuringly, clapping Harry on the back. </p><p>“Let’s just get this done and over with.” He said in a pained voice. </p><p>As the trio made their way to where the ceremony was to be held, Harry wondering what really awaited his future from that moment on.</p>
