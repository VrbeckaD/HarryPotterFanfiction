  <b>September 19th, 1716</b>
</p><p> </p><p><em> Ch</em><em>â</em><em>teau du Grange </em> - or Castle Granger, as it were - sat high on a French plateau overlooking a small French village. It was the aptly named summer home of the Grangers, the British Royal Wizarding Family. They were world-renowned for their kindness, gentleness, brains, cunning, and, most of all, bravery. The family had ruled for six centuries, bringing peace and tranquility to everyone. But there was unrest. In the far north of the United Kingdom, the scorned Black family watched, waited, and recruited, wishing to overthrow King Henry and his Muggle wife, Seraphina. They called him <em> Blood-traitor </em> in secret, wishing to keep their motives hidden.</p><p> </p><p>All but one.</p><p> </p><p>In the gardens of the castle sat a witch, alone with her history books. Well, mostly alone. Her best friends surrounded her, protecting her. She sighed as the head of her guard played around with a Snitch, thoroughly distracting her. She stared at him with a glare as her two other friends laughed at the two.</p><p> </p><p>“Sir James,” she said, catching his attention as he shyly put the Snitch away. She sighed again as she closed her book. “Go home to Lily. She probably needs you right now.” The young man shook his head.</p><p> </p><p>“No, Hermione,” he said. She almost smiled. She hated being called <em> Highness </em> or <em> Princess </em>. She wanted to be normal and had asked her friends to act accordingly. Her parents forced them to call her by her title whenever in public, but Hermione would be damned if they did the same around her. James continued to speak. “We need to protect you. There have been rumors of attacks near your home in England. We’re all lucky that your family is vacationing here.” She nodded and stood. She turned to look at her other two friends. Sir Remus of House Lupin and Sir Frank of House Longbottom stood and smiled at her. She smiled in return.</p><p>“I believe Nymphadora and Alice need you, too,” she said. “Please give them my best. You are all dismissed.” The eighteen-year-old men stared at the sixteen-year-old girl before them with humor.</p><p> </p><p>“Sorry, Hermione,” Remus said. “Your father is demanding that you be protected at all costs.” He paused, sniffing the air. His werewolf senses made it easier for him to notice things before they got out of hand. He turned and glared at the edge of the forest that bordered the garden before relaxing. Hermione turned to see a young man with long, black hair appear from the darkness of the forest. She smiled as the man dressed in black dress robes and a sword approached her. A cool summer breeze rustled her neat curls, making the man smile at her. She handed her book over to James and ran at the man. His grey eyes called to her. She lifted her skirts to not trip, although she knew she never could. She had been taught since she was four to be graceful. The arms of the intruder opened as soon as she was within arms reach. Her body collided with his. He picked her up and twirled her around. Her pale blue dress seemed almost white compared to his robes. James, Remus, and Frank all turned their heads at the two lovers. James smiled at the princess’s laughter.</p><p> </p><p>“Sorry for being late, love,” he said, holding her closely. He kissed her hair. “Mother and father would not let me leave again.” Hermione shook her head, smiling up at him.</p><p> </p><p>“You have nothing to apologize for,” she said. She stood on her tiptoes and brushed her lips against his. She was almost a foot shorter than him, but the height difference did not matter. He scooped her up and pressed a kiss to her lips. It was a few moments before they broke apart.</p><p> </p><p>“I do, though” he murmured. “I should not be late to my fiancée’s birthday.” Hermione sucked in a breath and stared at him.</p><p> </p><p>“You mean… Sirius, are you sure?” She whispered. Sirius Black smiled at her openly.</p><p> </p><p>“I am so sure,” he said, pulling a small diamond ring from his pocket. “I love you so much. I hate being away from you. We have courted for three years now, and I asked your parents for permission. Hermione Rose Granger, will you marry me?” Hermione smiled, tears in her eyes. She nodded, unable to speak. The two kissed as Sirius slid the ring onto her slim finger. There were a few moments of peace before Remus shouted.</p><p> </p><p>“Your Highness!” Hermione jumped and turned to her friend, Sirius holding onto her arms. Remus, James, and Frank ran forward to form a circle around her and Sirius, who cursed and drew his sword and his wand. “They found us!” Hermione’s heart sank. Before she knew what she was doing, she ran towards the castle, nearly tripping in trepidation of what lay waiting. The four men followed closely behind her, trying to get her to stop. Sirius caught up to her first and pulled her back.</p><p> </p><p>“Hermione!” He said, holding her to him as she struggled.</p><p> </p><p><em> “Maman!” </em> She cried out. <em> “Papa!” </em> Flashes of green shown through the throne room windows. “No! Calum!” She finally managed to break away from Sirius and the boys, taking a hidden passage to find her baby brother. She reached his room and found him crying in his crib. She relinquished her wand from its strap on her thigh and cast a silencing charm. The four men protecting her quickly entered the room, along with Lily, Alice, and Nymphadora. Hermione cast several spells - a Notice-Me-Not, some stronger wards - before shutting and locking the door. She ran to her brother, who cried in silence. Sirius came up to her, crying.</p><p> </p><p>“They tracked me,” he said, livid and hurt at the same time. “I should have known. My mother hugged me longer than normal today.” Hermione looked into her lover’s eyes, tears streaming down her face. She swiped at them, trying to calm down. Now was not the time to break down. Now was the time to fight.</p><p> </p><p>“Alice, Lily, Nymphadora,” she said. The three witches jumped to attention, immediately coming to Hermione’s side. She picked up her brother and kissed his forehead. “I love you, Calum,” she whispered to him. He stared up at her, noticing her serious face. He tugged one of her curls and she laughed sadly. She handed the seven-month-old child to Lily. “Keep him safe,” she said. “Keep him alive. Hide him.” Lily nodded and ran out of a servant’s tunnel. Hermione turned to those remaining. “We’re going to fight.” There were immediate protests, the loudest of which came from Sirius. Hermione raised her hand, and her staff members silenced. Sirius kept going.</p><p> </p><p>“You are <em> not </em>fighting,” he said, grabbing her by the arms. “I cannot lose you. We are to be married, remember?” Hermione smiled sadly at him.</p><p> </p><p>“Sirius, I must do this,” she said. Her place was defending her people. “For all I know, my parents are dead. That puts me in charge since Calum is under a year old. As the queen, I need to defend my people and my land.” As Sirius opened his mouth to protest, she kissed him. He kissed her back. They broke apart a moment later. “Sirius, I love you so much.” She cupped his cheek, smiling as he nuzzled into her touch. “You are my rock, my moon, my everything. But I need to do this.” She stepped away from him and stared at all of her friends. She stepped into the role she was born to take - queen. “James, since you are the head of my guard, you will stay by me and Sirius. Remus, you will bring up the rear. Frank, take the lead. Nymphadora and Alice, sneak into the throne room. We shall meet you there. Now go!” The two hand-witches nodded and left through the servant’s passage. The four men formed a circle around her. She watched as Sirius and James smiled at each other. They were best friends, after all. Frank took the lead, with James on her right and Sirius on her left. Remus stood behind her. She really did not need that much protection, but they were doing their jobs. “Alright, let us leave.” They left the confines of the nursery and headed towards the throne room. Dead servants littered the hallways. They had heard their screams in the garden.</p><p> </p><p>As one of the Black guards ran around a corner, Hermione flicked her wand, sending him flying without a word. Sirius smirked at his love.</p><p> </p><p>“Been holding out on me,” he asked. Hermione rolled her eyes. She sent more of the Black House flying. She knew it gave Sirius great joy, seeing the people who had tortured him go flying. The group finally made it to the throne room. While everyone else focused on the large group of cloaked figures standing in the center of the room, Hermione only had eyes for the two dead bodies floating in the air. She tried to restrain her emotions as she watched her parents float in lazy circles. The maniacal laughter that filled the hall pulled her attention to the group. Verona Black, Sirius’s mother, laughed and smiled at the dead royals.</p><p> </p><p>“We did it!” She exclaimed. “We will take over now!” The group cheered. Anger boiled in Hermione’s blood. When she blinked, the entire group had separated, choking up against the walls. She went straight to Verona.</p><p> </p><p>“How dare you?” She cried. “How dare you try to usurp power from us? We protected your family when no one else would! How could you betray our trust?” She turned and looked at several of the people who had joined the Royal Guard thirteen years ago. She looked at the Courtiers, the cooks - almost everyone she had held dear was now an enemy. The guilt on some of their faces almost made her forgive them. Out of the corner of her eye she watched as Nymphadora and Alice quietly entered the room. Her small group was still outmatched, but now they had more of a chance. Somehow, Verona broke out of the hold Hermione had on the group. She came over to the new queen and pulled out her wand.</p><p> </p><p>“Your <em> Majesty </em>,” the older witch snarled. “We’ve been expecting you.” She sent a curse at Hermione, who easily blocked the spell. The hold broke, and chaos ensued. The two groups fought for hours, Verona’s group suffering greatly. James, Remus, Frank, and Sirius had swords that protected them from spells. Nymphadora and Alice fought alongside their leader.</p><p> </p><p>Four and a half hours later, Hermione realized just how tired she was. She was nicked by a stinging curse, but she kept fighting. She sent a jinx toward Verona, who barely dodged it. Enraged with how the fight was going, she shouted in frustration.</p><p> </p><p><em> “Crucio!” </em> The older witch shouted. Hermione did not block it in time. She was hit, and her body felt like it was on fire. She screamed in pain, the world around her vanishing. She did not notice everyone stop fighting to stare in shock and horror at what was happening. She did not hear Sirius running and crying out. The only thing she noticed was the pain stopping suddenly. The world came back into view slowly, and she turned her head to see Sirius stabbing his own mother in the heart. He withdrew his blade and ran to Hermione’s side. He did not see Verona raise her wand and point it at him.</p><p> </p><p>“Sirius!” Hermione cried out, somehow managing to stand. She pushed him out of the way as Verona cast the curse.</p><p> </p><p><em> “Sectumsempra!” </em> Hermione pushed Sirius out of the way just in time for her to be hit by the curse. She collapsed as her skin tore open and she began to bleed out. She heard a scream and several swords drop. Sirius cradled her head, crying openly. She smiled up at him. She knew she would not survive. Her friends surrounded her, but her eyes were only for Sirius.</p><p> </p><p>“No,” he whispered. “No, no, no, no. You can’t die. Please. I can’t live without you.” Hermione smiled up at him. She took a shallow breath.</p><p> </p><p>“You will live on,” she said. “You are so strong. I love you so much.” She winced at the pain but continued. “We will see each other again.” She felt so tired. She began to close her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>“No! Come on, ‘Mione! You need to stay awake,” Sirius called out. Hermione’s bleary eyes opened, smiling again.</p><p> </p><p>“Goodbye, Slytherin King,” she whispered. He blinked, realizing what was happening. He took her right hand and kissed her knuckles gently.</p><p> </p><p>“Goodbye, my Queen,” he whispered. “I love you.” He cried, wishing for a miracle. But it was too late.</p><p> </p><p>Princess Hermione Rose Granger died with a smile on her face. Sirius just sat there, cradling his love. The remainder of Verona’s followers suddenly took action. James, Frank, and Remus shot hexes and jinxes at them, protecting Sirius as he and the two hand-witches mourned. A stray killing curse hit Sirius, and he collapsed on top of Hermione. The two lovers entwined in each other looked so peaceful.</p><p> </p><p>A force separated everyone, scattering them around the room. Everyone turned to see Alice standing, anguish and rage splayed across her face. Her eyes were black, and a booming voice came out of her. The wind in the room picked up.</p><p> </p><p><em> “I curse House Black and its followers,” </em> she said. <em> “I curse them to never know love. I curse House Black to never know what it means to have the love and adoration of their subjects. May only the pure of heart truly know happiness. The two lovers will return and destroy House Black. I curse House Black to live in fear.” </em> Another strong force swept across the room and out the door. It rolled over the hills of France and slowly made its way around the world. The curse was strong - in fact, too strong. It caused Alice to collapse on the spot once the strong wave had stopped. Frank crawled over to his wife. He shook her, trying to wake her. He sighed in relief when he saw her chest rise and fall. The rest of the Black family fled, knowing they had won the battle and now ruled over Britain. What was left of the former Royal Guard stared at each other, saddened.</p><p> </p><p>“Calum is our only hope,” James said, standing. “Lily and I will raise him as our own.” Everyone else nodded. “We cannot lose hope. I swore my fealty to House Granger. I plan to keep my promise to protect. What say you?” Everyone immediately agreed, swearing to protect House Granger at all costs.</p><p> </p><p>They never realized that the world as they knew it was over.</p>
