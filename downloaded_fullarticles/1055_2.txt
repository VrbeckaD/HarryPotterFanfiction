    <p>Draco Malfoy glances around the room, evidently bored. He just finished brewing a potion Professor Slughorn assigned for class. His eyes promptly land on one despairingly looking witch. Her hair is disheveled even more than usual, a slight blush is covering her cheeks and her eyebrows are furrowed. She's frustrated, with the cause for it visibly before her, fume rising from the cauldron. Potions - despite her best efforts, doesn't seem to be Hermione's strongest suit and Draco stops himself from smiling at her defiance.</p>
<p>Behind him, Blaise Zabini starts to observe him and his eyes quickly follow to where Hermione is now silently cursing under her breath. "Maybe you should help her out" he suggests with a slight shrug of his shoulders. It's a preposterous idea, really and Draco is about to spat at his classmate for even suggesting it when from the corner of his eyes he sees Hermione grabbing one of the mushrooms. Her poor attempt at a potion is going to be an actual health risk any minute now.</p>
<p>With an annoyed sigh he stalks over to her desk and in one swift move snatches her wrist away from the cauldron, the mushroom still in her grasp. Her skin is soft and warm. He notices that involuntarily - and despite his better judgment it feels nice. Not that he would ever admit that. Hermione abruptly turns to face him, surprised at the sudden interference. Draco only gives her a dry look.</p>
<p>"You might want to reconsider doing that. Unless of course you want all of us to end up in the hospital wing." Her eyes squint and she gives him her best death glare while freeing her wrist from his grip. "How kind of you, Malfoy" she retorts, her voice dripping with sarcasm. "But I think I can handle myself just fine. I've read the instructions." He scoffs at that and almost contemplates letting her ruin not just her grade but the entire classroom. When she moves once more to add the mushroom however, he reacts quickly by taking it out of her hand entirely. Ignoring her complaints the Slytherin softly shoves her to the side and starts to quarter the ingredient with the knife that lays on the table. He takes one piece and adds it to the cauldron before picking up another ingredient, squeezing its juice into her potion. With a slight 'poof' it changes colour to a scarlett tone and simmers down a little.</p>
<p>Draco barely has time to register the annoyance on Hermione's face turn into surprise and then acknowledgement before Professor Slughorn appears at their side. "Perfect, Mr. Malfoy. I'm glad to see you help out a fellow student. Ten points to Slytherin." With that Slughorn moves back towards the front of the class. The other Slytherins look pleased if not a little surprised at such unexpected praise for the Blonde but Draco barely registers that.</p>
<p>Because whatever regards Hermione Granger may have had for him only seconds before - they quickly diminish at the Professor's statement. She glares at him again and Draco can't help but show her a teasing smile. "You're very welcome, Granger." At that her mood only sours. "I certainly don't need <em>your</em> help, Draco Malfoy." She looks positively furious with him. He can't deny that he likes to be able to stir up intense emotions in her - to tease her but not so much as to degrade her. He's grown out of <em>that</em> and yet he's still on the borderline between good natured teasing and misled insults. Sometimes he's not sure he knows the difference.</p>
<p>Draco takes a step back. "Of course not." He just can't help himself but refrains from saying any more than that. He knows there's no need. She's already riled up enough as is. Instead he fakes an innocent smile and walks back to his desk, feeling Hermione glare deep holes in his back.</p>
<p>Unlike the Gryffindor witch, he’s in a good mood for the remainder of the class. </p>
