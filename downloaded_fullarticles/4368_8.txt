<p></p><div><p> </p><p>See, Cal had always told Raina she had a talent for identifying important people and just <span>knowing,</span> and of course, he was right. As always. To Raina, it was just instinctual- and she had learnt by now to always follow these instincts… so she did.</p><p> </p><p>Casually as she could, Raina stood up from her place at the coffee shop, quietly collected her meagre belongings and left, winking at the barista for good measure.</p><p> </p><p>Then she headed for the direction of the little girl. This would be important, she could feel it.</p><p>….</p><p> </p><p>After several minutes, Raina sighed. She had… ahh… lost the girl, which was quite unlike her. Usually, Raina had the art of following down to a T.</p><p> </p><p>Damn it. This was the first real lead that Raina had had in a while. The rest were powered, sure, but they weren't <span>important. </span></p><p> </p><p>Then there was a thud behind her and Raina turned around. That was the little girl! How… Raina smiled politely. "Hello, can I help you?"</p><p> </p><p>The girl wasted no time, "Why're you following me?" She took a step forward, surprising Raina. A little girl who wasn't afraid of strangers?! She reminded Raina oddly of herself.</p><p> </p><p>She breathed, "I'm Raina and I would like to talk to you for a bit. Is that alright?"</p><p> </p><p>"Okay." said the little girl. And then the little girl started to wander off. Was she trying to escape?</p><p> </p><p>"Hey! Excuse me?! Where are you going?"</p><p> </p><p>The girl turned around, "Sorry, there's a lot of blibbering humdingers around here, you know? Anyhow, I don’t think you'd want to talk to me, there are so many other interesting people here." she said lightly skipping back. "Would you like some tea? There's a good café around this part, I heard. You should stop following me too, it's very dangerous."</p><p> </p><p>Raina just giggled, "I'm sure it'll be fine. What's your name?"</p><p> </p><p>"Oh. I'm not allowed to tell strangers."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p></div></div></div>
