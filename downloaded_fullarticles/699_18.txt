    <p align="center">The Dark Lord's Child</p><p align="center">
  <em>Is a mistake</em>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p>When Bellatrix Lestrange found out that her lord's birthday was on December 31st she decided that she ought to do something special for it. It was 1978 and Bellatrix was dressed to the nines, or rather she preferred to be as little dressed as possible for the impending mission.</p><p>Men like her lord desperately wished for at least one hour of not thinking about anything. No war effort. No enemy brigades. No Dumbledore. No dying men and women dwindling his forces.</p><p>When she straddled him in his desk chair their kisses smelled of mulled wine.</p>
<hr/><p>A month later she asked him, quite bluntly, if he had ever heard of a contraceptive charm.</p><p>He retaliated by asking <em>her</em> if <em>she'd</em> heard of the same thing and if she wanted to seduce him she might as well be prepared what with her being a MARRIED woman.</p><p>This led to a very turbulent and passive aggressive fight that escalated further and further into a shouting match about the audacity of the other not to tell the other that they hadn't used a contraceptive charm.</p><p>''It's the man's responsibility! If even a smidgeon of chance existed of impregnating a woman even after the dark arts you've done to yourself you should have made sure to tell me about it!''</p><p>He had no proper comeback to that, so he just told her, quite briskly that: ''It was YOU who seduced ME, Bellatrix. If anyone knew what they were doing it was you. Good day.''</p><p>Then he left even though she had accosted him in his office in Malfoy Manor and logically she would have had to leave.</p><p>A few hours later they met up once more with a very giddy Abraxas Malfoy who told them that having a child was absolutely wonderful news. Antoinette Malfoy, his wife, looked at Bellatrix knowingly and lied straight to her face: ''Yes, pregnancy is a joy.''</p><p>Neither she nor her lord looked the least bit happy about this.</p>
<hr/><p>''Do you even want a child?''</p><p>''A bit too late to think about that now.''</p><p>''There are spells that can be used even after the accepted time-''</p><p>''They're too dangerous. We have a war to win.''</p><p>''To us, to the victors.''</p><p>''Yes.''</p><p>They toasted with water.</p>
<hr/><p>The matter of fact was that Bellatrix Lestrange was pregnant and she was both thrilled and really inconvenienced by the phenomenon. On one hand she had the Dark Lord's baby forming in her belly, whilst on the other hand she couldn't drink coffee anymore and she was going to massacre her lord and abscond to the Order of the Pheonix if he ever offered her to drink chamomile tea because black tea contained caffeine and was bad for the baby's brain development.</p><p>Rod was being a really good sport about it, though.</p><p>''I mean I would have preferred it if it were my child, but I still love you, you know.''</p><p>Bellatrix was about to retort and say something cruel because in these types of situations she never could fathom kindness, but luckily morning sickness kicked in and she was throwing up in a toilet. Saved by the miracle of pregnancy. She raised her head from the toilet and spittle dangled from her lips. Ugh.</p>
<hr/><p>''Will you care for it?''</p><p>''What kind of question is that?''</p><p>''You weren't raised to our ways.''</p><p>''I am the child's father.''</p><p>''A lot of men are their child's father and few of them care.''</p><p>''Will it be a Lestrange?''</p><p>''Will it be a bastard?''</p><p>''No. That I can tell you now. I take my duties seriously.''</p><p>''I hope so.''</p><p>Tentatively, reluctantly he placed a hand to Bellatrix's stomach and admitted: ''It will have a better life than mine was.''</p><p>''It will have parents.'' Bellatrix promised. Then, forcefully: ''It will be loved.''</p><p>He said nothing. That was fine. His presence was enough.</p>
<hr/><p>September 19th, 1979</p><p>Bellatrix Lestrange had a lot of things to say about childbirth and none of them were good.</p><p>''I should have gotten an abortion!''</p><p><em>''Then why didn't you?!'' </em>Lord Voldemort did not like to think about childbirth as his most immediate thought regarding it was <em>Death</em>. Bella looked so pale and worn out, yet angry enough to shout atop her lungs and scream her tongue off.</p><p>''I don't know! I had no idea it would be like this! <strong><em>Women lie!</em></strong>''</p><p>Abraxas and Antoinette Malfoy winked and wished them good luck. It was easy for them to say so when their son was grown and starting his own family. Voldemort tried to recall young Abraxas and Antoinete and remembered that he was in Albania away from young fathers and pregnant women.</p><p>The agony lasted much longer than Voldemort thought it would. He was no expert on women's physiology, far be it, but he thought that it would at least last less. The birth was held in Malfoy Manor under protective wards that no one could slip through unless they were accepted first by the Lord of the Manor and that was Abraxas, his most devoted.</p><p>Narcissa and Antoinette were in the room with the healers. Rodolphus stepped up and got inside, looking at Voldemort for the first time in a strange sort of pitying light.</p><p>Lucius, Abraxas, and he were in a room far away from the noise and the fanfare of childbirth. He wouldn't be there to hold Bella's hand, he wouldn't be there to see her dying, he wouldn't be there to be reminded of his mother's death.</p><p>Bellatrix didn't mind. He told her that he couldn't be there with her and she said that that was all right. ''But I'm naming her then.''</p><p>''Her?''</p><p>''Oh yes, I did a spell to check the sex. It's a girl.'' Bellatrix smiled. Grinned more like.</p><p>''I suppose that's fair.'' Voldemort didn't know what to do with a child, let alone a daughter.</p><p>A long time after the start of the birth Antoinette came or rather sauntered into their room, holding up a bundle of sleeping joy that awoke when she exclaimed: ''Behold! A baby!'' She went straight for Voldemort and showed the small girl to him, introducing them: ''My lord, meet your daughter.''</p><p>Only the people present at her birth knew about her. Bella named their daughter Delphini. He was not a fan of the name, but all things considered he would reward Bella for surviving by allowing it.</p><p>Bella and Rodolphus went into hiding until Bella got better. She’d been gone for months, some before the birth, and some after it.</p><p>But she still came back to fight.</p><p>And there was a rage about her that made her glow fiercely. Because now she fought like a mother who had a child to come back to.</p><p>Voldemort briefly wondered where he would be now if his own mother had had any of that spark… If he’d had a mother?</p>
<hr/><p>October 31st,1981</p><p>This was the night Bellatrix got captured by Alastor Moody. She could feel pain emanating in her mark, unlike anything she’d ever felt and a scream tore itself from her throat, so raw and so painful (much more than any labour may have ever been) because her lord couldn’t be <em>dead</em>.</p><p>With tears in her eyes she screamed: <strong><em>‘’WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO HIM?!’’</em></strong></p>
<hr/><p>Narcissa held her two year old niece and thought that the only way to survive this, to keep her husband by her side and to have her son grow up with two present parents was to give Dumbledore something great. She looked at little Delphini and whispered ‘’I am so sorry, darling girl.’’ She kissed her forehead and set up a meeting with Dumbledore.</p>
<hr/><p>What Dumbledore did with the girl, Narcissa didn’t know. She hated herself for not asking for a very long time.</p><p>Looking at her son growing up safely, with her husband out of prison and by her side – it did help her accept that maybe she didn’t have any other choice.</p><p>But sometimes she cried when nobody was home to hear her. Cried and wondered what her niece was up to or if she was even still alive. Surely she was? Dumbledore wouldn’t have sacrificed an innocent. The smart thing to do would be to hold her as leverage. Narcissa hoped Dumbledore thought similarly as she.</p>
<hr/><p>Arriving at platform Nine and Three-Quarters to escort Draco to his first year at Hogwarts was a magical moment for any parent. It meant that their child was growing up right before their eyes and that they could follow along and witness such steps.</p><p>But, Narcissa also thought that it was a magical moment because she saw a child being escorted by two muggles that was the spitting image of her sister.</p><p>Narcissa elbowed Lucius, who looked to where she glanced at.  Lucius did a double take and whispered: ‘’Andromeda’s got <em>two</em> children?’’ Because the girl looked a lot like Andromeda. Brown hair and brown eyes and a decisiveness about her that could only be found in a woman who defied her entire family for love. </p><p>A laugh slipped past Narcissa’s well kept façade. Draco was aboard the Hogwarts Express and out of the way to hear when Narcissa asked: ‘’That girl is my <em>niece</em>.’’</p><p>Lucius understood then, and he inhaled sharply. Because all of the Death Eaters thought that their lord was dead and that no part of him remained. Very few were privy to the information that their lord had a daughter. Even fewer knew that their lord’s daughter was alive.</p><p>‘’We need to find out who she is.’’</p><p>‘’My thoughts exactly.’’</p><p>Narcissa shoved Lucius to go greet the muggle parents and the terrified look he speared her with was something she’ll forever remember. But it was because of him that she relinquished her hold on her niece, it was only fair that he got acquainted with her adoptive parents in order to learn more information.</p><p>‘’How do you do.’’ Lucius outstretched his arm and shook hands with a man who smiled and said the same. ‘’My name is Lucius Malfoy, this is my wife Narcissa. We couldn’t help but note that you weren’t our sort – magic – do you—‘’ the pain in his tone, ‘’need any help? It can be very,’’ another gasp, Narcissa smiled and chit-chatted with the woman, ‘’daunting to have a magical child.’’</p><p>‘’Oh, thank you so much. That’s very kind of you.’’ The man said. ‘’Our Hermione’s always been an oddball of a child and we were worried for her, but it’s just that she’s a witch. Is your son a first year, as well?’’</p><p>‘’His name’s Draco, and yes,’’ Narcissa smiled, ‘’I hope our children get along.’’</p><p>Dr. and Dr. Granger met Lord and Lady Malfoy and a friendship of convenience was formed.</p><p>Later that day, Narcissa was clinking champagne flutes with Lucius, Abraxas, and Antoinette all while saying: ‘’To Hermione Granger.’’</p>
