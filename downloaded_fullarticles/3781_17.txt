    <p>On that worst of all nights, Lyall Lupin had arrived home from his office in the ministry at six o’clock sharp. He had been grumpy and ready to take the weight off his feet. He’d had to deal with a simply ridiculous man and his assertions that beasts should be afforded the same rights as wizards, and to make matters worse his favourite robes had been covered in gravy stains since lunchtime and nobody had bothered to tell him. </p>
<p>It had been with a great sigh that Lyall had slumped into the kitchen to thank and pay the babysitter.</p>
<p>“Hope the little monster wasn’t any trouble”, he’d said, kissing Remus on the cheek and completely ignoring the reply. </p>
<p>At last, after putting Remus to bed, he’d lain down. As his eyelids drooped, he congratulated himself on soldiering through a worry-filled day. Lyall Lupin fell asleep for the last time as a man who didn’t know the meaning of the ‘worry’. </p>
<p>Sometime long before dawn had touched the horizon, Lyall was awoken from his fitful sleep by a loud scream coming from the room next to him. Remus' room. He leaped out of bed, thinking that his son was having one of his nightmares and jogged towards the smallest bedroom to wake Remus up.</p>
<p>When he pushed the door open, his grey eyes widened with horror, there on the bed, hunched over the frame of a small child, was the largest werewolf he'd ever seen. It turned to him, blood covering its muzzle and snarled. For a moment Lyall did nothing, just stared at the glistening red droplets that should have been inside his son's body, not on this monster's fur.</p>
<p>It felt as if all the air had left his lungs, being sucked away to a point, far, far in the distance. This wasn’t happening. Couldn’t be happening. Not here. Not to Remus. </p>
<p>Then rage began to take hold. How dare this disgusting aberration stalk in from whatever pit it had come from to attack his son? How dare it even come near Lyall and his family? He whipped his wand out, pointed it at the foul beast and screamed "DEFODIO!"</p>
<p>A large chunk of flesh tore itself from the werewolf's chest as the gouging spell made contact, it howled in agony but Lyall wasn't done.</p>
<p>"DEPRIMO!" An intense blast of wind caught the creature full on as it was trying to coil itself for a huge leap. It was blown backwards out the window through which it'd come and landed with a heavy ‘Thud!’ in the garden outside. </p>
<p>Lyall scrambled to the window, barely able to see past the tears in his eyes and screamed "CONFRINGO!" The thing burst into flames with an ear splitting yelp.</p>
<p>"Cave inimicum." Lyall whispered this last, setting an invisible barrier around his house as the wolf dashed away in search of water to put itself out.</p>
<p>Lyall turned to his son and collapsed heavily onto the floor next to his bed. The small boy's frame was convulsing and shaking as blood and spittle foamed from his mouth. There were several jagged rents, torn by claws, along his side and blood pumped from them at an alarming rate. But what really drew Lyall's attention and horror was the row of tooth-marks on Remus' tiny neck. He was infected.</p>
<p>There was a horrible second where the dust in the room stopped swirling and the life pouring from Remus went from a river to a glacier, in which Lyall didn't know whether he wanted his son to live. Wouldn't it be better for everyone if Remus just died? Could he condemn a child, his child, to life of misery?</p>
<p>Lyall shook himself as he realised that no matter what, he wanted his son to survive this dreadful scarlet night. He ran to the fire place, still sobbing, and threw a handful of floo power into the grate. He stuck his head in and shouted "St Mungo's!" and experienced the whirling sensation of travelling via fire.</p>
<p>"How can I help?" asked a painfully calm and sterile voice.</p>
<p>"My son has been attacked by a…" Lyall hesitated for just an instant, "By a werewolf. Please help me!" He pleaded.</p>
<p>"Right away." Said the voice, which he saw belonged to a witch in white robes. "Healer Bones! We need the werewolf attack team to the Lupin residence immediately please!"</p>
<p>Even as the Healer shouted, Lyall heard a 'whomph!' from behind him and pulled his head back to his own house to see healers apparating and running for Remus' bedroom. He watched as they brought Remus into the living room and began weaving enchantments around him in circle. The waves of light washed over and through Remus. His pale form began to calm and still. His chest stopped rising and the blood stopped flowing from him.</p>
<p>They were too late. He'd died. His son was dead. Lyall screamed and ran towards Remus. One of the Healers stepped out from the circle and blocked Lyall's way.</p>
<p>"Your son is alive Mr Lupin." The woman said. "We're putting him in stasis so that his condition doesn't worsen while we transfer him to St. Mungo's and brew the necessary potions, some of which are quite rare and aren't used often."</p>
<p>"You've killed him." Lyall rasped. He hadn't been listening to a word of what had been said. He could just stare at his son, who did indeed look dead.</p>
<p>"You're in shock Mr Lupin." The healer said in an appallingly calm voice. "I'm afraid I'm going to have to sedate you."</p>
<p>Lyall Lupin didn't get chance to utter another word as drowsiness fell about him like a blanket. Rather than comfort him, it felt like he was being locked away with his pain in a cramped space. He whimpered as he passed out onto the floor.</p>
