  <strong>A ring made of Air?</strong>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>“Poppy, stop babbling I told you already I am not leaving this ward. I have things to ask Mr. Potter and for once Albus isn’t here to interrupt us.” Snape said in his usual cold voice.</p><p>Harry knew that didn’t bode well for him. He remembered why he was under the fabulous care of Mrs. Pomfrey again, there was a potion incident, Neville had added too much bat wings to their potion and Harry had put himself in between the soon to be exploding cauldron and his friend. ‘Damn his people saving thing, now he was stuck with Snape.’ He thought hastily.</p><p>One thing Harry was certain of the medi-witch always knew when he would wake up and made her way to his bed before the Headmaster could question him. Not that Harry had ever witnessed the Headmaster coming to watch over any other student and he spent quite a lot of the time in ‘his’ bed in the infirmary. ‘Three-Two-One’ Harry thought.</p><p>“Ah! Mr. Potter pleased to see you finally awake.” The gentle voice of Mrs. Pomfrey forced him somewhat to open his eyes so he could assure her that he was fine.</p><p>“Before you try to explain yourself Mr. Potter, I would like to know why it is that you seem to think it’s okay to be arrogant enough to play hero in potion class when you were too lazy this morning to put on your heir ring? Which I would like to remind you Mr. Longbottom was wearing as recommended and as such was in no danger of whatever you two managed to cook in your cauldron this afternoon.” Snape said all the while glaring at him.</p><p>Snape wasn’t as impressive as he could have been, but Harry assumed that if he hadn’t been so used to the disgusted looks, sneers, and glares, from his ‘loving’ family, the man might have frightened him, as it was Harry’s defense mechanism was to always try to up him, some part of his brain thought that he was just testing the man to know what it would take for him to break and go from verbal to physical abuses, because it’s always good to know.</p><p>“Well? Mister Potter?” Snape questioned when Harry took too long to answer.</p><p>“I am sorry Sir but I really don’t know what you are talking about, Mrs. Weasley said she bought everything that was on the list and I checked it twice since I always seem to be missing things other students have, whether for your class or for others. And before you start saying that I am so spoiled I don’t even shop for my school stuff on my own, it wasn’t my choice. We were going to go shopping the day after the Quidditch World Cup but obviously I wasn’t allowed outside of the Burrow after what happened especially since some people still thought it was me who casted the Mark since it came from my wand.” Harry explained and waited patiently for the man to retoured something.</p><p>“Harry, Darling?” Mrs. Pomfrey asked for his attention so he stopped glaring at his potion professor. “Why would Mrs. Weasley be in charge of procuring your heir ring for you?”</p><p>“Is it one of those things I can only buy in person? Like for my wand? Because if it is I don’t think I’ll ever get one. I mean I haven’t been to Diagon Alley to shop since the incident in second year. Between Lockhart trying to kidnap me, Malfoy Sr being his evil-self, Mr. Weasley and Mr. Malfoy fighting each other with their fists and my first floo travel ever ending with me in Knockturn Alley I understand why Mrs. Weasley took charge of our shopping after that. In third year, I was living in the Leaky Cauldron after I blew up Aunt Marge but the minister said I wasn’t to leave the establishment.” Harry explained naively. As he was looking at his hand the all time, ashamed somewhat that he had been treated like a child when Diagon was concern but that they had no problem telling him he needed to kill Voldemort when he would be back.</p><p>“Oh, I know” He said suddenly cheerful in the silence that had followed his last intervention. “Maybe I can get one in Hogsmeade, I mean Professor McGonagall has to let me go if it’s as important as you say, and surely someone his selling those ‘air rings’ in case we lost ours or if someone stole it right?”</p><p>“I…” Snape mumbled, Harry had never heard the man mumbled so he looked sharply at him. “Mr. Potter, an heir ring isn’t something you can buy.” Snape said in a firm voice but even Harry could say that something was bothering him.</p><p>“How am I supposed to get one if I can’t buy it?” Harry asked perplexed but it wasn’t the first weird thing that would happen in the magical world, after all he did get the philosopher stone from the mirror to his pocket, it just appeared there. “Is it something you have to transfigure? Because I know my work in transfiguration isn’t so bad but I don’t think I could manage something that would save me from potion accident.”</p><p>“Potter, please Stop Talking.” Snape snapped at him and Harry thought that maybe he should listen for once since the man had said please, and Harry had never heard him say ‘please’ before.</p><p>So, Harry just nodded that he agreed.</p><p>“Poppy, would you mind leaving us alone for a moment?” Snape asked the medi-witch who hesitated before Harry nodded to her and she left. “Mr. Potter, I know that your heir ring couldn’t be given to you the way it traditionally is…” Snape started and Harry already wanted to interrupt him.</p><p>Snape must have felt it and answer the unasked question. “It is something that the Lord or Lady of important family give to their heir, their first born, or their first son, or daughter, in case the lordship is gender specific.</p><p>Harry frowned at that, it would explain why he never heard of it before, Neville wouldn’t have mentioned it, he didn’t like to talk about his parents, and Ron was neither the first born, nor the first son of his family, Harry wasn’t even sure if Weasley was a Lordship, he had read that it used to be in the history book Hermione landed to him but he never heard anyone in the family talk about it, maybe Mr. Weasley had an older brother or sister and they were the ones with the Lordship.</p><p>“Now I know your parents couldn’t give it to you, but if the heir is too young for the responsibilities at his or her parents death, the rings are put into their Gringotts Vault for safe keeping and given to them before they enter Hogwarts.” Snape kept explaining, his voice nice and gentle when he mentioned children being orphaned at a young age like Harry had been.  </p><p>“Surely, your relatives took you to Gringotts so you could retrieve your ring and be given a statement of finances.” Snape wondered and looked at Harry, but he remembered not to talk and shook his head ‘no’.</p><p>“I need to know what I am working with before I let you explain yourself is that okay with you?” Snape asked and Harry nodded ‘yes’.</p><p>“You know, you’re not that much of a pain when you can’t talk Potter.” Snape joked and Harry looked at him wide eyed for a few second before he just shrugged, after all it certainly wasn’t the first time someone told him they didn’t want to listen to him, at least Snape was still talking to him and not just ignoring him.</p><p>“Do you know what a Statement of Finances is?” Snape asked, Harry shook his head.</p><p>“Didn’t your tutor explain it to you, or were you simply not paying attention?” Snape snapped at him before remembering to ask yes or no question and that it wasn’t Harry’s fault or at least Harry assumed that was what happened when the professor said “Sorry”.</p><p>“Did your tutor talk to you about Finances?” Snape asked Harry shook his head, trying to convey that he didn’t have a tutor, why would he have one.</p><p>“Did they teach you potion before you came to school?” Snape asked and again Harry shook head sighing, visibly it didn’t work.</p><p>“So, you only learn defense, figures it was why you have good grades in it.” Snape said without really looking at Harry but Harry kept shaking his head until he was sure the man had seen it.</p><p>“Did you have tutors, Mr. Potter?” Snape said cautiously and once more Harry shook his head.</p><p>“You can talk now.” Snape told him, and Harry took a big breath, not really sure why he prevented himself from breathing like he normally would while the man was questioning him, maybe he just didn’t want to break the tentative truce by making sounds.</p><p>“Quirrell talked to me about tutors too. I told him I never had any, he said I shouldn’t lie about such a thing just so I could slack off with Ron, that I should be proud to beat Hermione and Malfoy in his class that they had tutoring too.” Harry told him, he was now curious to know what was so important about tutoring.</p><p>“Professor Quirrell.” Snape corrected him absentmindedly.</p><p>“I have no respect for people who tried to kill me.” Harry mumbled.</p><p>Snape look at him for a while before he opened his mouth to close it immediately.</p><p>“I don’t understand if everyone has tutors before coming to Hogwarts, why isn’t there a primary school for magical children surely there isn’t that many qualified teachers in the United Kingdom that the Headmaster as to employ people like Quirrell, Lockhart, or Professor Trelawney…” Harry said thinking to himself, at Snape surprised look he added. “She only predicted my death, multiple times, she hasn’t try to kill me herself to make it true, yet.”</p><p>“Point.” Snape said nodding his approval to the logic. “The fact is Mr. Potter, that we were told you had tutors, and would know everything about the magical world, its culture and its history.”</p><p>“I had to learn all that between my birthday and getting on the Hogwarts express?” Harry asked in a defeated tone. “Even if I had been allowed to look at my school books, I am not smart enough to learn all that in a month. No wonder I used to feel so stupid sometimes when everyone knew so much more about me than I did or do.” He said with a sigh before adding in a whisper. “I still don’t know anything really, can’t even seem to find the books about me Hermione keeps talking about.”</p><p>“I think you misunderstood me Mr. Potter.” Snape told him, and Harry had to repress the shiver he was feeling every time someone spoke that word or the ones assimilated with it, ‘it’s only a misunderstanding’, ‘you misunderstood’, ‘misunderstand’, all of those only led to bad memories and shivers of fear.</p><p>Snape hadn’t miss the reaction and filed it out for later, he would ask about it once he knew more about the boy in front of him.</p><p>“I meant that, we were told you were being given a magical education at your relatives’ house.” Snape tried to explain as best as he could, but was perplex when the teen started to laugh so hard the medi-witch came back to check on them.</p><p>Once he had calmed down a little, Harry asked if the professor was serious and got a nod.</p><p>“I wasn’t even allowed to say the word magic in the house. Once I got punished because my cousin Dudley wanted to watch Merlin on tv and Aunt Petunia said I was trying to corrupt her son.” Harry explained and moved away from the professor when he saw the man’s reaction.</p><p>Snape’s face was red, just like Uncle Vernon before he started yelling at Harry, so Harry carefully backed away from his professor and into the headboard of his bed, pulling his knees against himself, it was late October and he was able to eat normally again, it had been quicker this time due to his weeks at the Weasley, he wasn’t about to let Snape ruin all his hard work with a misplaced blow.</p><p>“Petunia? The old fool left you with Petunia?” Snape started to yell angrily but stopped instantly when his eyes caught Harry’s. “Potter?” He asked sounding unsure and looked up at Mrs. Pomfrey.</p><p>“Harry, Darling, nothing is going to happen to you here, you’re safe at school remember?” She told him and gained a twin snort from both Harry and Snape for her efforts. At least, the twin snort relaxed Harry, a little.</p><p>“I am not mad at you Harry.” Snape told him and Harry turned incredulous eyes toward him, Snape had called him Harry. “I knew your mom and your aunt before we came to Hogwarts and she had never been a nice person toward those who were different, she hated that their parents were so proud of Lily for being a witch, and for being one of the brightest witch at school, when Petunia was just average. I don’t blame your grand-parents I have seen them encourage her too, they went to her horse riding competition, they put her scores on the fridge for the summer, but no matter how proud your grand-parents were of her she could never see past the fact that they still loved Lily even if she wasn’t ‘normal’. I don’t understand why the Headmaster left you with them, he knew that Petunia tried to push Lily down the stairs more than once to see if she could get her sister to lose her powers.”</p><p>“He knows she tried to beat them out of me too, he says I am exaggerating, that they love me and would be really hurt if they heard me talk about them like that.” Harry admitted for the first time since Dumbledore had sent him back to the Dursley at the end of first year.</p><p>Harry saw both of the adult in the room get their wand out in seconds and as soon as it happened he was off his bed trying to find his and cursing himself for taking so long to realize he didn’t have it in hand.</p><p>“Harry!” both adult cried out at the same time, stopping him in the middle of his frantic search.</p><p>“We just want to do a health scan on you.” Snape asked and Mrs. Pomfrey nodded.</p><p>“Didn’t Mrs. Pomfrey do one when I came in?” Harry asked hesitantly, he sat back on his bed ready to pounce away from them if needed.</p><p>“I did a surface one to know if you needed immediate medical care, or if you had any current injuries that needed treatment, as I do every time you come here. We…” She said and turned toward Snape who nodded. “We would like to do a deeper one, it would list everything that happen to you since you were born.”</p><p>Harry backed himself into the headboard shaking his head vigorously, he didn’t want them to know everything, he wouldn’t survive the humiliation and the mockery from the student body and from Snape.</p><p>Guessing what was wrong Snape offered something, “I, Severus Tobias Snape, promise to keep to myself everything that will be revealed by Harrison James Potter, may it be in writing, by speaking, or by sharing his memories with me, I swear on my magic that I will not talk, or write or share about it unless he gave me leave to do so, that includes mocking him or alluding to his situation in any fashion may it be comforting or demeaning in public as well as in private. So mote it be.”</p><p>“You…” Harry said and thought about what the professor just said. “You wouldn’t want to comfort me?” Not that Harry really cared or was suddenly expecting Snape to hug him but he thought that if he could be comforted by a simple world the man would at least attempt it.</p><p>“I just wanted to make sure you knew I would never speak of anything unless you tell me specifically that I can.” Snape assured him.</p><p>“My healer vow prevents me from speaking of anything to anyone other than another healer about a patient. But I could do the same that way no one can take it from my mind either.” And she did, with the exact same wording.</p><p>“You can comfort me in private, when it’s just us three, it’s private enough, if you wanted.” Harry assured the both of them and they nodded before pointing their wands at him again.</p><p>The scan took longer than expected, not that Harry knew how long it was supposed to take, but he could both see and sense Professor Snape and Mrs. Pomfrey getting more and more worried, as well as paler with every line the magical quill that had appeared wrote on the medi-witch parchment. Harry had tried once to move away from them, they seemed distracted enough that he thought maybe he could run for it, he was wearing one of the infirmary pajamas but that was okay it wouldn’t be the first time the other students in the castle would get to see him in those. He didn’t get far anyhow, not even out of the bed before Snape, he was pretty sure it was him, his magic felt different that the one from Mrs. Pomfrey, stocked him to the bed with the help of a sticking charm.</p><p>“I need…” Snape started then stopped with a warry look to the papers pilling up in the Medi-witch’s hands. “Yes, that’s it, I need you to stay on this bed, with Poppy sitting with you, I have a floocall to make.” He declared and left them alone going to the Medi-witch’s office.</p><p>“Mrs. Pomfrey?” Harry asked when she stayed silent, glaring at the parchments in front of her. “Are you okay?”</p><p>“Am I okay he asks! Am I okay?” Poppy ranted for a while before her eyes snapped toward him and she gave him a piercing look. “I should be the one asking if you are okay, Harry, not the other way around. This…” She said pointing at a line on the parchment that Harry couldn’t read from the bed. “And this…” She said pointing at another line. “And all of those…” She kept going from one parchment to another adding comments in the margin with her quill. “How are you even alive?”</p><p>“That is what I would like to know as well.” A deep voice said from behind him.</p><p>---------</p><p>Meanwhile in the office:</p><p>Severus sat down on the ridiculous cushion next to the floo. Why was it pastel green, why not Slytherin green, he knew the devil medi-witch didn’t even like green as a color, she didn’t have anything against his snake, but it was an aversion she develop during the first war after seeing too many casualties of the dreaded killing curse.</p><p>He was dreading the call he had to make, not that it was the first time he had to call the man but usually it involved pranks gone wrong and suitable punishment, never did he have to call on him for such an important matter. But he knew, he would be needed, or at least his wife would in some way. Plus, he hated the fact that he had to call out that stupid name every time he wanted to speak to the man.  </p><p>“Gryffindor’s Den.” Severus called out while sending a handful of floo powder in the fireplace.</p><p>“What be Master Potion need?” One of the House elf answered. “Are little Masters in trouble?”</p><p>“In a way, I need to speak to your Master and it’s rather urgent.” Severus said and the House Elf quickly popped away.</p><p>The man must have been close by, because he walked into the room not a minute later. Before any greetings could be exchanged Severus told him what he wanted from him.</p><p>“I need you to step into the infirmary right now.” Severus told him.</p><p>“Noda said none of the children are in trouble. What is this about Severus?” The man asked calmly.</p><p>“I took a vow not to divulge that information, but I am requesting as a friend that you step through as quickly as possible.” Severus explained putting as much urgency as he could in his voice, they couldn’t wait for Dumbledore to find out what they were doing, something told him the man would swipe it away as he had done with other important things.</p><p>“My grandson was with me for an afternoon tea, should he come with me?” The man asked.</p><p>Severus quickly thought about it, only one of them could be having tea with the man and since the more Harry talk the more they uncover it might be useful to have him on hand just in case they needed to make a quick trip, at least he could run interference with the Headmaster.</p><p>“Yes, take him with you.” Severus answered and stepped away from the Fireplace when he was told that they would come immediately.</p><p>Once again they skipped the pleasantries, Severus would apologies later but time was of the essence here. As they stepped through the door, Severus had to silence the younger man, glaring at him for daring to interrupt the Medi-witch in her rumbling. She didn’t give any details just pointed lines after lines on parchments that both of their guests recognized, the ‘in-depth medical report’ parchment had a very specific blue color it was very light and only people who had already gone through one or work in the medical field would know it for what it was, but they had never seen so many pertaining to the same person.  </p><p>“How are you even alive?” Poppy finally asked, and this seemed to check the older man out of his stilled stance.</p><p>“That is what I would like to know as well.”</p><p>Harry looked back at them, even though his position stuck on the bed wasn’t ideal for that.</p><p>He didn’t know what Snape had gone to do but since the man wasn’t dead he would assume he hadn’t told anyone what he had confined in him.</p><p>The older man next to Snape reminded him of someone, there was someone he couldn’t yet see behind them, but his attention was focused on the older gentleman. He was dressed in nice robes, in deep blue with a bit of gold on the hem, simple but yet looking expensive, at first glance Harry thought it might have been silk, he had seen Draco walking around in similar robes, but when the man walked closer to him he could see that what he had mistaken for the effect of the sun reflecting on silk was actually tiny mother of pearl scales twined together.</p><p>The man himself, although he looked well taken care off, looked ordinary, and old, Harry thought the man looked as old as Dumbledore himself, but instead of long hair and a long bear, his was shaved, and the few hair still present on his head were trimmed short and as white as chalk giving the impression that the man was bold although he wasn’t.</p><p>“Grand- Father let me introduce you.” A younger voice said from behind them and Harry recognized it immediately.</p><p>“Bill?” Harry ask incredulous and wondering why Snape had called Bill and who Harry assumed was Arthur’s Father having heard of Molly’s parents’ death not long after her brothers and finally understanding why the man looked so familiar to him.</p>
