    <p>"Is that what you wanted to hear, Draco Malfoy?" Harry asked, and he heard his own voice echo around him, cold and low and full of anger that he didn't feel. He saw Draco shiver and he tried to summon up the anger, he did, but all he felt was a horrible sort of emptiness. He shoved Draco away from him, and somewhere, somehow, he felt a pang go through him for the gentle touch he'd shared with Draco before. Which was wrong, so <em>wrong</em>.</p><p>He was turning to leave when he heard Draco's voice. It was soft at first, too low for him to make out. Harry didn't stop, couldn't allow himself to stop. And then Draco spoke again, strong and urging, and Harry's feet were still before he could process what he was doing, and he could feel Draco's heat right behind him, his voice whispering in his ear.</p><p>He hesitated, reveling in the feeling, in the warmth the closeness seemed to give him before he realized just how close they actually were. He turned, scrambling away from Draco, who just continued to talk as if nothing had happened.</p><p>"Do you have any idea how I felt when you immobilized me?" he asked, and Harry's back hit a wall, cutting off what little escape there had been. Draco just kept coming, his silver-grey eyes locking Harry in place more effectively than the wall ever could.</p><p>"Watching everything and not being able to do anything was torture. And the things Voldemort said to you, I wanted to kill him for even thinking about touching you," he said it like it made perfect sense. And Harry supposed to him, it must have. To Draco, life and fire and anger were easy to come by. Easy to hold.</p><p>"I didn't for a second think you were useless or dirty or pathetic. And don't you dare stand there and tell me what you think I want to hear," he said, and Harry blinked hard, feeling that unmistakable heat behind his eyes that he'd used to think he'd never feel again. It was strange, once his body seemed to accept the idea that it could cry again, it was as if the flood gates had opened. Draco stepped forward again, his hands coming up to rest on the wall along either side of Harry's head, and his face so close Harry would only need to push his face just a little bit forward...</p><p>"So, why don't you stop pushing me away and give me a chance to prove it?" Draco asked, his hot breath blowing across Harry's face.</p><p>He swallowed; he should want to run away, to close his eyes and feel nauseated as he'd always done when someone looked at him like that, but- He couldn't bring himself to feel anything but a burning desire to press his lips forward and finally understand how Draco's mouth would taste. And that… that scared him more than he would ever admit.</p><p>"Ok," he answered. He didn't know what he expected. Maybe for Draco to pat him on the shoulder and turn away, maybe he'd have a satisfied smile.</p><p>It was nothing compared to look Draco gave him.</p><p>His eyes lit up to pure molten silver filled with joy and something Harry would have said was adoration if he didn't know better. And Draco's lips were curled up into the widest smile he'd ever seen, much less directed at him. And then he was lowering his head, his lips hovering an inch from Harry's, hesitating.</p><p>Harry lifted his face, meeting Draco halfway and pressing their lips together, mouths tightly closed. He didn't know what he was doing, or why he was doing it, but he knew it felt fitting in a way precious little had ever felt in his life. And he just couldn't find it in himself to care about right or wrong anymore.</p><p align="center">~~3 Days Later~~</p><p>"You want us to ignore everything you've done?" Scrimgeour said. He had that look on his face, that look of demanding retribution for crimes that Severus just couldn't—wouldn't pay for. He had spent enough time hating himself for the choices he'd made. He simply couldn't afford to stand here and argue with a man he owed nothing to about debts he had already paid.</p><p>"Talk of ignoring whatever you want," Severus answered. "Dumbledore left me in charge of Hogwarts, and I will continue to run it until you actually have something to arrest me with." Scrimgeour scowled, but Severus was in no mood to humor him. "Now, if you've nothing else to say."</p><p>"Rest assured, Snape," Scrimgeour answered, already turning toward the fireplace. If Severus admired one thing about the man, it was that he knew when to leave. "The day will come when I do find something to send you to Azkaban with," Then he was throwing a handful of floo powder into the fire, calling out 'The Ministry', and stepping through.</p><p>Once he was gone, Severus sighed heavily and dropped into the chair behind Dumbledore's—his—desk. It was his office now. Dumbledore was dead. Severus had killed him, and this was <em>his</em> office him. He sighed again, raising his hands to run fingers through greasy black hair.</p><p>It had barely been a week since the Dark Lord's attack, and Dumbledore's subsequent death. The Ministry was on Severus' heels with accusations surrounding Dumbledore's death, and Severus' true alliances, but they couldn't really touch him because there had been too much evidence that Severus had fought the Dark Lord and his Death Eaters that same night. Still, he knew it was only a matter of time before Scrimgeour nailed him for something. Catching Death Eaters was what the man was known for after all.</p><p>Severus looked up when he heard a knock on the door, three soft raps with a single knuckle. Severus sat up straight in his chair, pushing his hair back behind his ears. He wanted to be alone, to not have to put on his mask and hold himself back, but then Severus had hardly ever gotten what he wanted.</p><p>"Come in, Lucius," Severus called, and Lucius pushed the door open before crossing the room and sitting lightly in the chair opposite Dumbledore's desk. He looked at Severus' face for a long moment, crossing his legs and shifting in his seat. Whatever he found didn't seem to please him, if the frown that touched his lips was anything to go by.</p><p>"I take it the Ministry meeting didn't go well."</p><p>"Of course not. Scrimgeour won't let this go, not now that he's got his teeth in."</p><p>"You'd think anyone with half a brain would know to leave you alone by now," Lucius answered, the area around his eyes tightening minutely.</p><p>"Yes, well, you know Scrimgeour. Just because he's Minister now, doesn't mean he'll give anything up without a fight," Severus sighed. "It just makes him that much more likely to succeed."</p><p>"True," Lucius' lips curled in barely concealed disgusted. "I never liked the man." Severus was silent; there was no real answer. Lucius already knew his opinion on the matter; there was no point restating it. They sat in silence for several minute, Severus' eyes firmly set on the desk in front of him. He could feel Lucius looking at him, but he didn't look up. There wasn't a point.</p><p>"You know," Lucius said finally. "I could make it go away. I still have quite a bit of influence in the Ministry."</p><p>"You mean you could blackmail and pay people off."</p><p>"If that's what you want to call it," Lucius answered, not bothering to hide the bite in his words. Severus sighed.</p><p>"Perhaps if he becomes a problem."</p><p>"It's already a problem, Severus," Lucius' eyes narrowed, and he leaned forward, placing his one hand on the desk as he stared. "Why don't you let me help you?"</p><p>"I can handle this," he answered, and Lucius' lips twisted at the blatant lie between them. Severus just turned his head away. He was tired, tired of arguing with Lucius about things that would never change.</p><p>They had spent the past three days together, careful, touching and talking and yet, not. Lucius had done nothing more than kiss him, and Severus was not about to ask for more. And when they <em>had </em>spoken, it had been the same stilted conversation it had always been. Both too afraid to say too much, to give too much away.</p><p>"Why do you lie?" Lucius asked, and his voice was that innocent tread again. Open and full of emotion as he stared and just for a second, Severus could believe he was everything to Lucius the way Lucius was to Severus.</p><p>"Who says I lie?"</p><p>"I say," Lucius answered, and Severus recognized that look in his silver eyes. The one that fell when Severus had yanked too far back, had asked for too much, had reminded Lucius that he had hurt him before, and they were both sure he would do it again. The look that said Lucius was angry; Lucius was angry, and he was looking to lash out the only way he knew how. "All you do it lie. You ask me to stay and then you act as if I am some kind of burden. You kiss me but then flinch away when I try to touch you," Lucius' lip twisted in a mocking sneer. "If you truly wanted nothing to do with me, you could have said, instead of pretending this <em>farce</em>." There was a beat before Severus spoke again.</p><p>The past three days had been bliss for Severus. It was better than he could ever have hoped to have Lucius looking at him and only him—It was almost good enough to make him forget how quickly it would end.</p><p>Honestly, Severus was surprised it had lasted three days.</p><p>"Rest assured," Severus answered. "If I was capable of staying away from you, I would have already done it." Lucius' eyebrows furrowed, and he stared as if his words didn't make sense, though Severus didn't know how that could possibly be true.</p><p>"Severus, I-," Lucius started. Of course, that was when someone else knocked on his door. Three loud bands as if he were afraid no one would answer. Harry.</p><hr/><p>Harry was bored, though he spent most of his days bored, so he didn't know why he was complaining now. Ever since Severus had taken over as headmaster, he'd been busy running the school, and Lucius was busy teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts and Potions now that Severus only had time to teach a few high-level classes. Frankly, Harry figured they both must have been running on will alone.</p><p>He was sitting in Gryffindor common room, listening to Granger and Weasley bicker about something that was doubtless important to them. They'd stopped asking him what he thought a long time ago; he didn't even know why he bothered to sit with them anymore. Dumbledore had always said appearances needed to be kept, and Harry had always been too tired to argue.</p><p>But he was beginning to be tired of being tired.</p><p>He supposed he could seek out Draco out. He could bother the pure-blood until he was no longer bored, but he hesitated. After Harry had kissed him on the Astronomy tower, Draco had seemed reluctant to touch him again. The few times they'd been to together, Draco had seemed distracted, nervous, unwilling to come too close, and Harry was wondering if Draco was truly as busy as he seemed or if Harry had done something wrong. Perhaps he had read the situation incorrect, and Draco hadn't wanted him like <em>that</em>. Perhaps he hadn't wanted Harry to kiss him, and he was trying to think up a suitable way to let him down.</p><p>He couldn't find it in himself to blame Draco; he wished he could, but the anger just wouldn't come like it used to.</p><p>Finally, he couldn't take it anymore. He stood and left the common room, not even bothering to make an excuse to Granger and Weasley. They didn't ask him what he was doing anyway. They never did anymore. He walked out of the portrait, and trekked down the hall, making a few turns without really having a destination in mind. He supposed he should go to the library, read a few more books, see if he could find more information. But he had found nothing every time he looked, and it was becoming tedious when nothing was to come of it.</p><p>"Harry!" a voice called behind him. He froze at the sound, his lips twisting in disgust before he could really stop them. There were only a few people who called him by that name, and even fewer who he tolerated to do so. Remus Lupin was not one of them. He turned to face the other man, narrowing his eyes to stare at the innocent expression. "What are you doing wandering around so late?"</p><p>"I would ask how that's your business, but frankly I don't want to hear whatever nonsense you're going to come up with," he answered, and Lupin pursed his lips. He looked offended, but a least he was smart enough not to say anything.</p><p>"I came for the Defense Against the Dark Arts position," Lupin said, smiling as he tried to engage Harry again. "The Order thought it was best to have someone monitoring Hogwarts."</p><p>"You mean, besides Me? And Severus, and McGonagall, and Hagrid?"</p><p>"You know what I mean," Lupin answered, his smile tightening just a little too much to be comfortable. Harry wasted half a second wondering why the man bothered; it wasn't as if he was fooling anymore.</p><p>"Well," he turned away from Lupin, fulling intending to continue down the hall. "Have fun with that."</p><p>"Harry, wait," Lupin was suddenly there, his hand on Harry's arm, holding him back. "I wanted-." Harry wrenched away from him, his arm tingling unpleasantly where Lupin had touched him. And for half a second, all he could see was a meaty face, hands, snake eyes, taunting lips drawn thin and holding him down. He glared; Lupin was just as guilty, just as dirty as them.</p><p>"Don't touch me."</p><p>"Harry, you can't-."</p><p>"And don't say my name," Harry answered, his eyes narrowed as he stared hard at Lupin. The man stepped back, holding his hand out as he seemed to realize the depth of Harry's anger. And Harry reveled in it. He reveled in his anger rising up and burning in his lungs as he stared at Lupin.</p><p>For a while, Harry would have done anything to rid himself of the anger that pulsed through his body and made it hard to breathe. But then, it had gone. It had left him trembling and hollow. It wasn't that he wasn't capable of feeling angry; he did. He was almost always bitter and angry, but it came with the tired sweep of his bones and that hollow quivering in the pit of his stomach.</p><p>And now, now Harry was <em>only</em> angry. He didn't have to push or pretend as he stared at Lupin and that felt... freeing.</p><p>"You know what?" he decided. "I will accompany you to the headmaster's office."</p><p>"That's not what I meant."</p><p>"Don't care," Harry answered, turning and moving in the direction of the headmaster's office. He knew without looking Lupin would follow him.</p><p>"So, Harry-."</p><p>"No."</p><p>"But-."</p><p>"I don't want to talk to you. Frankly, I don't even want to look at your face, but I'll settle for not hearing your voice," he said. Lupin was silent the rest of the way. It was almost a pleasant walk.</p><p>Harry stopped in front of the gargoyle statue that marked the entrance to the headmaster's office, sparing not even a moment of thought before he muttered the password and watched the gargoyle move to allow the staircase to open before them.</p><p>"How do you know the password?" Lupin asked him.</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"Yes, I know the password."</p><p>"That doesn't even make sense," Lupin sighed as they began to climb, and Harry resisted the urge to smile at his grumbling tone.</p><p>He hesitated before knocking on Severus' office door. He could tell by the voices inside that Lucius was there. He wasn't exactly sure what was happening between them, but he could tell from Severus's continued distress that he didn't like it, and he could tell from what Lucius had said, that he didn't understand why. Frankly, Harry was getting tired of hearing about Lucius' relationship problems.</p><p>Lupin moved an inch closer, and Harry decided he simply couldn't stand being this close to him any longer. He knocked on the door and listened as the voices silenced inside.</p><p>"Enter."</p><p>Harry opened the door and walked in, Lupin close on his heels. Severus caught Lupin's look and straightened in his seat, a heavy scowl crossing his face.</p><p>"Remus Lupin, to what do I owe the pleasure?"</p><p>"Ah, Severus," Lupin answered, moving further into the room. "I was hoping to speak to you about a teaching position."</p><p>"Oh? Last I remember you weren't very adept at potions, Lupin."</p><p>"I'm here about Defense Against the Dart Arts."</p><p>"That position is filled."</p><p>"Severus, do be reasonable," Lupin sighed.</p><p>"I don't think you're listening, wolf," Lucius said. He had his body turned toward Lupin, his legs crossed with his hands resting atop his cane as if he were perfectly relaxed. And Harry wondered why he bothered when he was obviously upset. "The position is taken, by me, in fact."</p><p>"Severus," Lupin answered, twisting his head away to focus back on Severus. "You and I both know you're in a tight spot. I can help you."</p><p>"I'm not sure what you're insinuating," Severus narrowed his eyes.</p><p>"The Ministry is at your back, you have a rogue werewolf as a student, you're a known Death Eater, and you have a known Death Eater on your staff. There's no Dumbledore to protect you anymore," Lupin said, and Harry resisted the urge to snort. As if Dumbledore had done much of that for any of them.</p><p>"And what do you think you could do?" Lucius asked, one pale eyebrow raising.</p><p>"I could at least get the Order off your back, and maybe stop some of the rumors about Draco being out of control. At the very least, with an older werewolf here, the Order will have to admit that he's more in control. I'd like to help you if you'll just let me."</p><p>"I'd like to cast a few cruciatus curses and toss you to the bottom of a pit somewhere, but nobody lets me do that," Harry answered, leaning against the wall as the room turned to stare at him.</p><p>"That's not helpful, Potter," Lucius said. Harry just shrugged.</p><p>"Why would you want to help us, Lupin?" Severus asked, ignoring Harry completely. Lupin blinked once before turning back to him, seeming to make an active effort to compose himself.</p><p>"I…" his eyes flicked to Harry. "I believe that this is what Dumbledore wanted to happen. I believe that to defeat Voldemort we need to trust people we may not have normally trusted." He looked pointedly at Lucius before focusing back to Severus. "You need my help."</p><p>Severus stared at him for a long moment before he sighed, his lips twisting with something close to annoyance. He finally nodded, his fingers clamping down on the edge of the table. Lucius' hand tightened on his cane, but he said nothing against Severus' decision. Harry made a disgusted sound in the back of his throat, cuffed his foot against the ground, and made a mental note to skip Lupin's class for the rest of the year.</p><p>"You'll take up Defense Against the Dark Arts; Lucius will teach Potions," Severus said. "Though if you step one foot out of line, Lupin, we'll know, understand?" Lupin had the dignity to say nothing as he nodded.</p><p>"Well," Harry pushed away from his wall, stepping subtly toward the door. "I'll be going now," he turned, pulling the door open.</p><p>He heard Lupin call after him, but Severus must have done something because the room was quiet behind him, allowing Harry to slip out and go back down the stairs. He moved away from Severus' office, heading for the library without really thinking about it. He had already wasted enough time, time spent with Draco, talking to Lucius, watching Severus, and dragging Lupin around. He paused outside the library, pulling his wand out of the sheath along his waist. He was allowed a lot of freedom inside Hogwarts, but that freedom did not extend to the library.</p><p>"<em>Accio</em> invisibility cloak," he called, and waited until the shimmering invisibility cloak landed in his hand. His lips twisted as he felt the thing; he hated it. He hated the reminder that his parents were dead—just a few more people to add to the list of those that had left him.</p><p>Harry slipped the cloak over his shoulders before creeping into the library, moving automatically to the history section. Voldemort had used one founder of Hogwarts' heirloom; Harry had a fair idea what he else he might use. He pulled a book down, examining it for a moment before setting it back on the shelf. The problem was that none of the books seemed inclined to tell him anything he didn't already know, which wasn't exactly helpful.</p><p>Dumbledore had left him with the word Horcruxes, and somehow expected Harry to come up with the rest. Sure, he'd destroyed one, and Harry had destroyed another in his second year. Dumbledore had even told Harry that he himself was a Horcrux, if that could be counted as helping, but there were at least four more.</p><p>He sighed, stepping back from the shelf as he drew another book down. He hated this, this horrible sense of duty. It had always been his job to stop Voldemort, since before he had even know the name. But he had somehow thought that dying would alleviate that duty, fulfill it in a way he'd never wanted to. Which was of course why it didn't work.</p>
