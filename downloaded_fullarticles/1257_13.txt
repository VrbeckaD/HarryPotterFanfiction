    <p>Hogwarts loomed ahead, a prominent figure in the horizon, and the train was slowing to a halt. Athanasia stepped out onto the open platform, suitcases in hand. She was looking around, unsure of how to proceed in her unfamiliar surroundings, when a large, lumbering man walked up. His robes were rugged looking, but his shoes were well kept. His most distinctive feature was the enormous amount of hair surrounding his face. The thick curls did not hide his jovial eyes, however. </p><p>     "'Ello ther' miss. Are ye headed fer Hogwarts?" The man looked down at her. Not at all condescendingly. It was just that this particular man was much taller than her.</p><p>     "Yes. And you are?"</p><p>     "Rebeus 'Agrid's my name." He grinned jovially. "It's nice t'meetcha."</p><p>     "DeLaide. It's nice to meet you as well." She smiled back.</p><p>     "Can I 'elp you with yer bags?"</p><p>     "No, it's quite alright, thank you. They're not heavy, I promise." Hagrid nodded and promptly waved his hand, gesturing her to follow him. Before she knew it, she was sailing along on a boat and staring up at the monstrous building she would now call her home. The ride, however, was far too short for her surroundings to properly sink in. Hagrid led her up to the large front doors of the school and opened them as if it were nothing. The inside was just as magnificent as the outside, but yet again, her attention was taken away by the imperious witch staring at her. </p><p>     "It is very nice to see you again McGonagall." I set down one of my bags and extend my hand out. She takes it and gives it a quick shake.</p><p>     "You may call me Minerva. Since Argus is off somewhere cleaning something, I'll be showing you around. I'm sure you know about the four houses." She promptly turned around and began walking. I hurried to catch up to her, but not before saying a quick 'goodbye' to Rebeus. </p><p>     "I seem to recall them, yes."</p><p>     "Good. That saves a lot of explaining. Be careful of the stairs, they enjoy being a nuisance. Your classroom is down near the Hufflepuff common room. It's also conveniently near the kitchens," She gave me a quick smirk. Maybe she has a mischievous side. "I'll let you get settled. I'll come and pick you up when it's dinner time. You can meet the other professors there." After walking up and down some staircases, through a courtyard, and along some corridors, Minerva stopped in front of a door. A ring with three keys appeared and she handed them to me. 'Take care' was the last thing she said before turning around and disappearing around a corner. </p><p>     I try the first key and it lets me in, the door opening with a little whine. Although slightly dusty, the room was more than I could've imagined. Rays of light peeked though the small windows near the top of the classroom walls, gently illuminating my surroundings. Underneath the windows were bookcases filled up with books and mysterious trinkets. The opposite wall was lined with candles. At the front of the room was a chalk board and a desk. I weaved my way around the haphazardly placed desks to get to the front. I placed my suitcases down on my new desk, opening one. I pulled out some things I thought might personalize the room some more; sage sticks, books on ancient languages, ancient religious texts and incense burners. A couple of simple spells and my additions to the room were arranged in a way I was content with and the desks were aligned in straight rows facing me. Lastly, a few scourgify spells were cast, wiping the thin layer of dust draped over the room away. </p><p>Â </p><p>     Several hours later, after I rearranged my new bedroom (attached to my classroom), Minerva walked into the classroom. She looked around briefly in what I presume to be a look of approval. Then again, she's hard to read. </p><p>     "Are you ready for dinner?"</p><p>     "Yes. I'm half starved." She nodded and quickly led me through the winding corridors that seemed to never end. After a few minutes, however, Minerva led me through a small door way and into a very large hall. We were behind a long table filled with food which already had some professors sitting. She pushed me forward and into an empty seat beside Rebeus. </p><p>     "I must speak with the headmaster." Minerva turned away and left me to my own devices. </p><p>     "Hello Rebeus - may I call you that?"</p><p>     "I don' mind." Rebeus smiled through his bushy beard. "It's 'Thanasia righ'?"</p><p>     "Yes." I smiled back. "Now what would you suggest for me to eat? I have no idea where to start." With a short chuckle, Rebeus began to point out all his personal favorites and I took a little bit out of each dish. As we settled into a comfortable silence, I took in the large hall. Four large tables faced us, completely devoid of students. The walls were stone with some fancy additions. The most impressive thing, however, were the vast amounts of candles gently floating around the ceiling and the night sky beyond them. If it didn't hurt my neck and I wasn't hungry I could probably stare at it all night long. </p><p>     My daydreaming was quickly interrupted with the tell-tale scrape of a chair being pulled out besides me. I looked over, expecting it to be Minerva, and was surprised to see a man settling himself on the patted seat. His black hair barely brushed his shoulders, framing a pale face. He wore all black, a harsh contrast to his complexion. I looked away and dove into some of my grains. I briefly toyed with the idea of introducing myself, but I decided to pay him no mind. I would much rather spend my diner in silence then participate in mindless chatter. </p><p>     That didn't mean of course I couldn't steal a glance or two at his side profile.</p>
