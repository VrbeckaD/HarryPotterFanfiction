    <p>Voldemort willed his wand to harm Harry, to kill Potter; the boy who lived, so that the prophecised threat to his life would be gone forever. But try as he might, their wands weren’t cooperating. His and Harry’s wand had encased them in a golden cage and the sounds coming from the golden tendrils were similar to a phoenix’s cries. He knew Harry had nothing to do with whatever was happening because the boy was looking just as lost and bewildered as him, looking at the golden cage with fear and shock in his eyes.</p><p> </p><p>Voldemort knew he will never get another chance like this again, the boy was protected at Hogwarts and his relatives house’s security was still in air.</p><p>He wanted Potter gone and he wanted him gone now. He will not die no matter what.  </p><p> </p><p>With that thought in mind, the Dark Lord broke the connection between his and Harry's wand and shot a cutting hex straight at Harry's chest.</p><p> </p><p>Desperate times called for desperate measures.</p><p> </p><p>Harry’s grip on his wand slackened and he looked at Voldemort with surprise and shock, the golden cage surrounding Harry and Voldemort long gone as Harry’s very life came to a halt. Harry gazed into the red eyes of the serpentine wizard, Tom Riddle with a lost look in his own. The fourteen year looked down at his bloodied chest before staggering and falling to the ground.</p><p> </p><p>The emerald eyes that were once the same shade of the killing curse filled with tears as the boy who lived realised he was dying.</p><p> </p><p>Voldemort felt an unfamiliar ache in his chest as he saw Harry's bloodied form, deaf to the jeers and howls of victory of his Death Eaters around him.</p><p>He felt <em>cold</em>, colder than usual at the moment.</p><p> </p><p>And somewhere in his non-existent heart, Tom Riddle felt something which he’d <em>never ever</em> felt in his life. He felt…<em>loss</em>.</p><p> </p><p>Before long Harry was lying in a pool of his own blood, eyes forever glazed and open, stuck with unshed tears.</p><p> </p><p>Voldemort didn’t feel like celebrating, he didn’t want to do anything but be alone. He glanced at the portkey and with a wave of his wand both Harry and the boy who had come with him to the graveyard were gone.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>In the following months, Voldemort freed his Death Eaters from Azkaban who honoured their oath and won him the wizarding world; causing as much havoc and destruction as they could.</p><p>Dumbledore with his Order of the Phoenix tried to stop the Dark Lord but in the end he was defeated, so were his allies.</p><p> </p><p>Within two years Voldemort had complete control of the Ministry of Magic and British wizarding world. He gave the mudbloods a choice, to either leave or be slaughtered. Most of the Hogwarts students left to go back to their families and were cut off from the magical world forever.</p><p> </p><p>All this time Voldemort could not let go off the feeling that he had done something terrible that night in the graveyard. When few times he closed his eyes to rest, all he could see was Potter’s last expression, shock and loss etched on his face.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Voldemort tried to immerse himself in his magic, to learn even more, push more boundaries of the gift he’d been given but it served no purpose. It only made him more godlike. Not a God. Never that.</p><p> </p><p>It didn’t fill the void Harry’s death had left in his heart either.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Voldemort glanced at the blue sky outside of the window of his Slytherin Manor and wondered why even after 250 years he was still lost and haunted by Harry’s death.</p><p>Nagini came and draped herself on his shoulders and he caressed her head, his mind still mulling things it shouldn’t.</p><p> </p><p>His death eaters, his loyal followers had died within eighty years of his reign. After the war was won, they had stopped going after muggles and had settled at their homes. No muggleborns were allowed in and the state of the wizarding world was pretty much how it was before the war with the Order of Dumbledore. Even some order members had settled in his world.</p><p> </p><p>But the thing which concerned Voldemort was that he still didn’t feel <em>anything</em>. He felt nothing.</p><p> </p><p>Voldemort was well aware of the fact that he’d always been cold and unfeeling; cruel. But now it was as if he was empty of even that.  He didn’t feel anything even if he tortured someone with crucio. Not to mention he had lost the will to hurt anyone; whether they be purebloods, mudbloods or muggles.</p><p>He had never cared for anyone.</p><p> </p><p>For the first time in centuries, Tom Riddle wondered what would have been different between him and Harry if he hadn’t started the first wizarding war.</p><p> </p><p>In last two hundred years Department of Mysteries had come a long way from what it was in nineteen nineties. It was time he, the Emperor of Wizarding World of Europe, Lord Voldemort/ Tom Marvolo Riddle went and pushed even the boundaries of Time itself.</p><p> </p><p>Time travel, the ability to go back in time and change it. Another marvelous thing magic could do.</p><p>Time Dust in the department was the answer to everything, answer to the unfamiliar ache he still felt in his heart.</p><p> </p><p>Voldemort didn’t care about the consequences, he had created six horcruxes, seven after he  had seized Hogwarts and acquired Godric Gryffindor’s sword. He wasn’t afraid of anything anymore. He never had been. He had conquered death, his only fear.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Voldemort found himself in his body after he had made the diadem into a horcrux. He’d created his fake snake like appearance immediately a year after because he wanted people to fear him. Horcruxes had only caused his features to become slightly gaunt and given him red eyes, the former something easily remedied by other magical arts. He had never truly lost his beautiful features. Only the colour of his eyes had changed permanently to ruby red. They remained the same since they could not be changed by any art.</p><p>After he'd re emerged as Lord Voldemort, no one could even connect him to his real self, Tom Marvolo Riddle. Even when he'd won the wizarding world, no one ever saw his real self. He only shed the serpentine visage when he was alone at the Slytherin Manor, whose location was not known to anyone and was barred to everyone except Nagini.</p><p> </p><p>Lord Voldemort, the name he'd given himself from his birth name, Tom Marvolo Riddle, defined him as much as the name given to him by his mother. Voldemort and Tom Riddle were same people, they were him. He'd disliked his name because it connected him to his father, his muggle heritage. With years, he realised how meaningless that thought really was.</p><p> </p><p>His father wasn’t a monster, his mother was; even if she was Salazar's direct descendant. His father had been a victim of the most heinous crime a human being could do to another. He hadn’t cared because he had been treated like a monster and devil in that wretched orphanage even when he had only retaliated. Billy and Amy had never told the matron that they had butchered his grass snake and left the carcass on his bed.</p><p> </p><p>Voldemort glanced at himself in the mirror and smirked viciously, his red eyes glowing with an eerie glow. He waved a hand over his ruby red eyes and they turned to their original silver grey.</p><p> </p><p>There will be no prophecy this time.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Voldemort worked day and night and made the Philosopher’s Stone.</p><p>This remarkable deed got him the praise of famed alchemist, Nicholas Flamel and many others, not to mention Order of Merlin First class. Everyone believed it was because of Elixir of Life he will be youthful and immortal forever. No one knew of his horcruxes and no one ever will know that he was frozen at the age of twenty eight because of Darkest of Dark arts.</p><p> </p><p>He started working in Ministry of Magic’s Auror department and had a good time dealing with stupid, small fry, that he and others were tasked to take out.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>With years the biggest surprise came in the form of Albus Dumbledore. The headmaster of Hogwarts wanted Tom Riddle to teach Defense against dark arts now.</p><p> </p><p>Voldemort didn’t know what was the reason behind the man’s request, the same man who had condemned him from the get go because of his affiliation with snakes, who’d always judged him for every little thing, who refused him twice the very position he was now being asked to take.</p><p> </p><p>He knew Dumbledore and Dippet had been good friends, and he knew Dumbledore must have said something to his unbiased headmaster. That was the only reason Dippet had refused to give him the job he actually liked.</p><p> </p><p>He refused Dumbledore’s offer.</p><p> </p><p>He did, however, remove the curse he had placed on the post and made it so that the teacher wouldn’t be gone only after a year.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Voldemort looked at the setting sun in front of him as he stood still in suspended air, one of the many things he could do with his incredible magic, fly and stay in air for as long as he wanted. He will not go back to Hogwarts no matter how much he loves the school. That part of his life was over.</p><p> </p><p>Life was good, Voldemort surmised as he drank his drink and looked at the vast orchard of flowers from his window of the manor. He didn’t have to do much, just go to his job and come back.</p><p> </p><p>He’d gone and taken control of Slytherin vaults which the goblins had been too happy to give to him. He now had Slytherin manor, Peverell manor and a lot of gold. That was a surprise, to know that he was related to another pureblood family.</p><p>This life of his was almost...peaceful.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Voldemort quirked a brow at the new letter in front of him.</p><p>Dumbledore apologies in recent letters, his confessions that he’d been wrong and downright cruel  to <em>him</em>, for no reason didn’t make him feel a thing. He just didn’t care. Not anymore. What was even the point of these letters? He didn’t know neither did he care.</p><p> </p><p>He sent in the same answer he’d always sent. He didn’t want anything to do with Hogwarts anymore. He was done.</p><p> </p><p>Voldemort knew he hadn’t been innocent either, he had killed people without remorse, but Dumbledore wasn’t a saint. He had no right to judge a child. He never ever gave him a chance or treated him kindly. He really had wanted to teach children every facet of magic, light and dark. He didn’t have a nefarious reason to be at Hogwarts.  All dark arts weren’t evil no matter what some idiots liked to think. The truth was they were too scared and weak to perform the spells.</p><p> </p><p>Voldemort gave a mocking look to a group of people who flinched and bowed quickly before Disapparating. His former allies, the first Death Eaters, Knights of Walpurgis had noticed his change in attitude but were too scared to question him about anything. They continued on with their lives, unwilling to incur his wrath by saying anything.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>Dumbledore didn’t hire  Sybill Trelawney.</p><p> </p><p>Trelawney didn’t make any prophecy, false or true.</p><p> </p><p>Harry Potter was born again to James and Lily Potter.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Voldemort noticed that this time James and Lily Potter had Harry much later than the first time. He was sure both James and Lily were in their late thirties unlike the last time where the idiots had to go and have a kid while being involved in the war. Hormonal desperation at it’s worst.</p>
