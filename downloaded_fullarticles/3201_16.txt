    <p>Draco wasn't one to believe in love.</p><p>He knew love existed in its unconditional form, like the one his mother had for him. There was friendship, too, that was also a form of love. He did love Pansy and Blaise, though they annoyed him sometimes. He could admit he also had seen proof of romantic love between a couple that seemed pretty solid. So yeah, he knew it could <em> exist </em>.</p><p>He just had a hard time to believe that it could happen to <em> him </em>, in the reciprocated way at least. It's not that he thought people couldn't fall for him or find him attractive, either. It had happened more than he cared to admit, during formal occasions or parties with co-workers, when he was forced to dress up and be sociable: someone would inevitably approach him and start flirting. Draco had learnt to tell the signs by now and tried not to lead them on, thus gaining the Romantically Unapproachable Bachelor status, which, although scaring away most of the weakly-interested parties, it made him quite popular among the ones who liked a challenge. To these people he would show no mercy, telling them right on that he wasn't interested, be it man or woman or anyone else.</p><p>The truth, though no one knew, was that he already had fallen for someone, so many years ago that he thought he would be over it by now. Yes, of course it was Harry sodding Potter. He still felt a hint of annoyance at his absolutely unreasonable attraction towards that git, but stopped fighting it a long time ago. He had his twenty-seventh birthday this year, which meant he had to live with it for eleven years, having realised this terrible truth in his sixth year.</p><p>He still felt sick thinking about that time, when things started spiralling out of control. He was a mess, perfectly aware of his bad choices, and yet his self-destructive attitude pressed him on. Well, that's what he thought at the time, anyway. Too late he realised what the hell was going on in his stupid brain, and by then he couldn't go back anymore. It was a cry for help, really. During fifth year, Potter barely paid him any mind, so he literally had to play cat and mouse with him, joining a patrolling squad for a crazy lady to catch his attention. Even then, alas, he couldn't hold it for more than a few minutes. So, during the summer, he took the chance of his father's failure to offer his services to the Dark Lord himself. He'd never seen his parents as proud as they were that day. If only they'd know the reason why he was doing it... not that he himself knew then. All this elaborate strategic thinking was going on in the back of his head. He just made himself believe that it finally was his time to shine, to leave a mark in history.</p><p>He felt smug at the beginning, but that toned down considerably in no time. The task was hard to complete, and a lot was on the line. Yes, Potter glared at him suspiciously every time they were in the same room and even followed him sometimes, but Draco was too scared of the consequences to allow himself to gloat or get distracted. On one hand, he was proud of himself for not getting caught, on the other... well, Potter <em> was </em> brilliant, right? It wasn't all high praise and stories made up by the papers, was it? Then why wasn't he coming to stop Draco? Draco was a hundred percent sure that he would have found a way to ruin the plan and also save his dark soul by the end of the year, possibly.</p><p>Apparently, though, he had other things in mind. Draco found out a bit later, being all engrossed in his mission, that Potter and the Weasley girl became a <em> thing </em> . It was disgusting to see it with his own eyes, really. He had never cared much for romantic relationships himself, and was only mildly annoyed by the couples he occasionally glimpsed in the hallways. This one, however... Every time he thought of them together, he felt physically sick. And livid. If he saw them being affectionate during breakfast, it would leave a bad taste in his mouth for the remainder of the day, making it impossible to concentrate on anything, kicking the sodding Cabinet out of frustration. Of course he was mad because Potter was having a good time while he feared for his future, or so he told himself. And cried, there was a lot of crying. He never stooped so low in his life. He fucking <em> needed </em> to be saved. But apparently, the great Harry Potter was too busy snogging his girlfriend and having 'secret' meetings with the headmaster to notice. Or maybe he just didn't care that much, because it was Draco, and he wasn't worth being saved. Potter wasn't even trying, or he would've stopped him a long time ago. Feeling forsaken even by the most disgustingly altruistic person he knew, he pressed on doing what he had to.</p><p>What the great Saviour did shortly after was... uncharacteristic, to say the least: he attacked him with a vicious curse that left Draco bleeding on the bathroom floor. He didn't know how to feel about that, still didn’t now as an adult man. It fucking hurt. Physically. And emotionally. It certainly made him <em> feel </em>something, a mixture of rage and wounded pride and rejection and an out-of-place sense of loneliness, and out of spite he actually managed to accomplish his mission. He couldn't complete the other half of his assignment, though Snape fulfilled his Unbreakable Vow and killed Dumbledore in his stance.</p><p>After that happened he had to lay low for a while, with time to think properly. It was just before the fall of the Ministry that he <em> realised </em>; he realised that he had helped a mad tyrant because he felt neglected by his crush. Really? He always fancied himself as a clever person, and yet here he was, regretting everything he had done in the past year, wishing he could go back and just confess, prevent all of this, even at the cost of his pride.</p><p>There was nothing he could do now. He kept following orders without using his mind or his heart. Only once he dared to defy the Dark Lord, when he refused to confirm Potter's identity. He didn't look good, but at least he was alive. Draco liked to think that his small, belated good action was somehow relevant in the course of events that led to the Dark Lord's defeat.</p><p>Then Potter took his wand. He might as well have killed him there and then. What's a wizard without his wand? Though after all, it's not like he took it to punish him, merely because he needed it. It was mainly because of Draco that everything went to hell, so it was fair that he should indirectly help Potter.</p><p>During the Battle of Hogwarts, he was torn between keeping his family safe and a watchful eye on Potter. Turns out he could do both at the same time. Unluckily, his daft friends were way into the whole let's-catch-Potter-and-gain-the-Dark-Lord's-favour and tried to kill him for real. The last thing Draco wanted was for someone in that room to die, even Weasley and Granger, who were surely fundamental in Potter's plans. Then Crabbe went and fucked it up further by conjuring bloody Fiendfyre. Potter finally lived up to his title of Saviour and risked his life to save them. Crabbe didn't make it, but it wasn't anybody's fault but his own. Draco's heart almost leapt out of his chest while he was tightly holding Potter's sides, only partly because of the deadly situation they were in, and as the deadly flames lunged hungrily towards them he thought, <em> I'm so fucked </em>.</p><p>Honestly, this only added to the boring cliches Draco was guilty of, but the fact that Potter saved him was groundbreaking for Draco, for his feelings. Finally. He finally did it. Had he been waiting seven years for this moment? All his life? He thought he fancied him before, but now, now it most certainly became proper <em> love </em>.</p><p>How the hell did this happen. Why Draco. Why Potter. All of this was ridiculous. He didn't even <em> know </em> him. Did years of rivalry count as 'knowing each other'? He doubted so.</p><p>Draco wished he could say that the trial where, once again, Potter came to his aid, was the last time he saw him. That he moved on and now his life had nothing to do with the Boy who Lived. But. He decided to pick a job that had a lot of relations with the Auror's Department, <em> specifically </em> because of Potter’s position in that office. Yes, he wanted to work as close to him as possible. Not because of his feelings, but because he had a huge debt to pay. Two times Potter saved his life: in the Room of Requirement, and in the trial. Yes, he counted the trial, too, because he was sure he wouldn't have survived Azkaban, even devoid of Dementors. He thought, Aurors often face dangerous situations: he could save Potter’s life a couple times, possibly without being noticed, and he could retire to sulk at the Manor for the rest of his life. That was the plan, but still no luck.</p><p>He would've been an Auror himself, but for some years after the war, former Dark Lord's supporters were automatically refused that position. So Draco settled for a consulting job in the Investigation Department, mostly desk work, with occasional field work along Aurors and Hit Wizards. He didn't care that it was boring, nor that he was actually 'doing something good'. All he cared about were those handfuls of missions where he was backing up Potter, half hoping he would end up in a life-or-death situation. Which he did, every time in fact, and every time he came out victorious without any help. Curse sodding Potter and his natural talent against the Dark Arts.</p><p>In these few occasions, they didn't exchange more than a few necessary words, strictly about the job. Also, Potter didn't trust Draco to have his back, which was perfectly reasonable but still hurt. Draco would never admit it, but his eyes were drawn to the successful young wizard more often than not, and not one time he caught those green eyes looking back. Tightening his jaw, he tried to remember that this was not about winning Potter over and making him fall in love. His feelings didn't matter. He was certain that the reason why he was never able to get over his crush was because he was never apart from him for more than a few weeks at a time: the sooner he would pay his debt and leave the sodding job, the sooner he could be free of this hell made of aching chests and nervous sweats.</p><p>Then the promotion came. Potter became Head of Auror's Department, which meant he could choose who to consult, and not-so-surprisingly, it was never Draco. This was bad for the plan. But he didn't have much time to worry, because in two months' time Draco helped to catch the last Death Eater, who was hiding in Ukraine, and was offered a promotion himself. This was a delicate situation because, if he accepted, it would mean Potter <em> had </em> to see him in meetings, but he wouldn't be a consultant working in the field as much as an administrative figure. In the end he refused, not knowing exactly what it was going to happen, and was rewarded beautifully: everyone in the office now respected him, especially the Head of the Department who was grateful he didn't take his place.This meant that whenever a request for a consultant was sent in by the Auror's Department, Draco was the first to be offered the job.</p><p>He never thought committing himself to work would bring him these pleasant results, nor this burning flame of pride in his chest, which he hadn't felt in a long time now. Up until now, he was just... there, doing the bare minimum not to get fired. Maybe he wouldn't leave the place after he was done with Potter. <em> If </em>he ever would be done with Potter, he redacted, reminding himself the score was still two to zero for Potter.</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">

</p><p align="center"> </p><p>“Come in.”</p><p>Draco stepped into Strudwick's office, and sat on the wooden chair in front of the desk when the man gestured to it. He seemed pleased to see him. Surely, he was glad Draco was sitting on that uncomfortable chair and not on his velvet-clad seat.</p><p>“We have a request from the Auror's Department-”</p><p>“I'll take it.”</p><p>Strudwick flashed him a patient smile.</p><p>“I wasn't done, Draco. We also have one from the Hit Wizards. The Aurors are looking for a rogue werewolf, it's been running wild in Dunbar for a couple of full moons now. The Hit Wizards are after the Leicester murderer, which I'm sure you read about in the papers lately. The choice is between ungrateful hours to catch a wild dog or fame and glory for catching a serial killer.”</p><p>Draco politely let him finish (final chuckle included), waited a couple of seconds to feign indecision, then said:</p><p>“I'll go with the werewolf.”</p><p>Strudwick bit his lip.</p><p>“Draco, Draco. I know you wanted to be an Auror, but this is leading you to wrong choices. That ship has sailed, my boy. I let you choose your assignments so that you can forge your career, not sink it. A rogue werewolf... yes, it killed a couple of muggles and it's been terrorising a town for some time. I'm pretty sure it will turn out to be an unknowing housewife who has no idea what's been happening to her. A serial killer, however... they have been looking for him for weeks, and yet he managed to kill five witches and wizards, and a young squib! If you help them catch him, you will not get a miserable column on the Prophet, you will be on the first page with a couple of the most respected Hit Wizards!”</p><p>Draco could see that the man cared about his success. Whether it was because he wanted to keep him away from his armchair, or because he actually wanted to help him, he couldn't say for sure. But he had a point. This job had just started feeling rewarding, and a rogue werewolf felt like a step back from the streak of thieves and international smugglers he had going on. On the other hand, a serial killer was <em> definitely </em> a step forward. Also, the Head of Aurors' couldn't be following such an insignificant case, so he would just be wasting his time.</p><p>"I don't know why Harry Potter is so determined about chasing this werewolf... I mean, I'm not saying Muggle lives are not important”, he laughed nervously, “but he really should let the Werewolf Capture Unit deal with this. Right now they've got their hands full with a lycanthropy propagation up in Manchester. As soon as they're done, I'm sure they will put their minds and hearts into it. Ah Potter... an excellent wizard, a brilliant Auror... he should be supporting the Hit Wizards with the Leicester murderer, not running around Muggle towns.”</p><p>Oh. So Potter himself was the one on the case. Well, he had no choice now. He rose from the hard chair.</p><p>“Mind if I consider this for a bit?”</p><p>He had to at least pretend he cared more about his career than a secret life debt with his former rival.</p><p>“Of course, but no later than two PM. Serial killers know no rest, except for when they're dead.”</p><p>Strudwick winked knowingly at him, certain that his wisdom was helping to shape a great Investigative Wizard.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>He met Potter at his office, three o'clock sharp, to discuss the case.</p><p>The place was a mess, unsurprisingly: papers scattered all over the desk, some on the floor even; memos flying everywhere, owl feathers, empty flasks, confiscated wands waiting to be put away; quills, ink bottles, and so, <em> so </em> many mugs on every horizontal surface; and to top it all off, a vaguely unpleasant smell in the room. Draco automatically waved his wand towards the window, opening it. Immediately, the cold October wind knocked a few papers off the desk, and Potter, after taking some time to find his own wand and closing the window, reserved him an annoyed glare. Draco unapologetically raised an eyebrow at him, though his insides were twisting and twirling. It had been some time since he last saw him, and no matter how tired or worried, he always managed to metaphorically punch Draco’s guts with a simple stare.</p><p>“We don't need a skilled Investigator such as yourself, Malfoy. This is a minor case.”</p><p>Behind the obvious mockery, there was a hint of something in his tone that Draco couldn't quite pin down.</p><p>"And yet here I am, humbling you with my presence. You better not waste my talent... or my time," he added, nodding towards the paperwork Potter was trying to put in order. He couldn't get his attention even when they were supposed to be working together.</p><p><em> This is not about winning him over </em>, he reminded himself.</p><p>Potter rubbed his eyes behind the glasses' lenses.</p><p>“All right... For the past two full moons, there have been werewolves attacks in the Muggle town of Dunbar. Two men and a woman were killed, two of which died instantly, the other one passed away in a hospital an hour after the attack. After the first deaths, members of the MLE Patrol were sent over from Edinburgh, but they came back empty-handed, swearing there was not a single witch or wizard in the town, and therefore there could not be a werewolf either.”</p><p>“Why not?”</p><p>If Potter thought it was a stupid question, he did not give it away.</p><p>“Muggles don't know how to deal with werewolf injuries, so they don't get a chance to get infected, they just... die. Anyway, as soon as the other killings took place, they sent in a request to us -to the Werewolf Capture Unit, precisely- and washed their hands of the whole thing.”</p><p>Draco expected a bit more of information on how the case landed on the Aurors' Head desk, but by the way Potter was going back to leaf through the paperwork, he thought that was it.</p><p>“All right. When are we leaving?” he asked impatiently.</p><p>“Hm?”</p><p>“The Auror on the case and I. When will we be leaving. You know, to Dunbar?” he added, not sure if Potter's mind was fully present.</p><p>“The Auror... Oh. That would be me. I'd say... as soon as I'm done with these?”</p><p>Draco lifted an eyebrow.</p><p>“It'll be tonight or tomorrow at the latest, I will let you know. Tell Strudwick I gave you the rest of the day off.”</p><p>Draco nodded, though Potter wasn't looking, and left the office, narrowly avoiding a memo in the eye. There were still four days to the next full moon. What were they supposed to do there so early?</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>After supper, Draco was in his room, perched on a stack of books like 'The Art of Investigation: How to Track Lurking Criminals of Average Dangerousness', and 'Records of the Most Bizarre Localisation Methods Used Before the Tracking Spell Was Discovered'. He was intensely focused on a page of 'Investigating Non-Ordinary Wizards and Semi-Sentient Creatures', when he caught a glimpse of a foreign source of light in the corner of his eye. There was a huge deer made of light staring at him from across the room. Draco almost fell from his chair when the damn thing opened his mouth and spoke with Potter's voice.</p><p>“Sorry, I couldn't finish after all... See you in my office tomorrow at one o'clock”</p><p>The deer stood silent for a while, watching him, and Draco wondered if there was something wrong with the spell, then it spoke again.</p><p>“Don't pack too many clothes, we'll be dressing as Muggles most of the time.”</p><p>Draco groaned and rubbed his face, while the Patronus hopped through the closed window.</p><p>Not that he hated Muggle clothes, he actually liked to wear them underneath his cloak for the most informal parties (his style was very much fashionable, as flirting co-workers and acquaintances kept saying); it was wearing them to blend in that bothered him, since he couldn't wear pointy hats nor long, warm capes. He always felt underdressed.</p><p>He knew the Department was going to provide the clothes, but he packed a few of his own anyway, not trusting a random wizard who knew nothing of his measurements or style to choose them for him.</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">

</p><p align="center"> </p><p>The following morning he kissed his mother goodbye and Flooed to the Ministry in his working hours, though he didn't have to. There was nothing to do there, except reading some more. When he approached Potter's office, ten minutes to one, the secretary outside looked at him with an apologetic smile and said, “I think he might be dead.”</p><p>Draco blinked a few times.</p><p>“...excuse me?”</p><p>"Mr Potter. He stayed overnight to finish the paperwork, and now I think he's dead. Can you check on him for me, please? I'm too afraid to do it myself.”</p><p>Draco kept his expression neutral, not sure if she was joking, and pushed the heavy mahogany door.</p><p>Well, he <em> did </em> look dead. The office was exactly like the day before, except Potter was now sleeping soundly on his desk. A thin thread of drool from his mouth had smudged the ink of the paper under his face, and a memo was desperately trying to free itself from the tangle of his hair. Draco allowed himself to smile, partly amused, partly softened.</p><p>He cleared his throat loudly. Potter groaned in his sleep.</p><p>“Potter!”</p><p>Potter's head instantly shot up, glasses askew, paper glued to his face, eyes terribly unfocused, and it was all Draco could do not to laugh in his face. Instead, he tapped his finger on the desk.</p><p>“I'm awake, I'm awake...” Potter said, peeling the piece of parchment from his cheek. He slowly picked up a nearby mug, examined its contents, shrugged and chugged it down.</p><p>“Glad to see professionalism is not dead.”</p><p>“Just a couple of minutes, <em> I promise </em>," he said, and disappeared behind a door which, Draco imagined, let into a private toilet, so he decided to wait outside.</p><p>“So, should I clear my desk?” the secretary asked him.</p><p>"His day has not come yet, I reckon," he answered, picking up on the mock concern.</p><p>Potter came back in what Draco counted to be five minutes, and asked the secretary if his baggage had arrived. She nodded and extended him a leather messenger bag.</p><p>“Please Letty, thank Hermione for me, she saved my life... Tell her I will buy her dinner when I come back”</p><p>Draco glanced at the bag and thought Potter had a weird concept of life-saving. Though, if that was the case, it could only help his chances of getting out of his life debt sooner.</p><p>Potter gave some more instructions to his secretary, then they took the lift to go to the Atrium. Draco automatically motioned towards the fireplaces, but Potter went straight to the reception and asked for a Portkey.</p><p>“Potter?”</p><p>“Hm?”</p><p>“Why aren't we Flooing?”</p><p>“I thought it would be more convenient this way. Also, I hate Flooing.”</p><p>“Oh.”</p><p>The receptionist came back Levitating a pair of rusty scissors.</p><p>"Whenever you're ready," he said.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>“Ouch, Potter, that's my foot!”</p><p>“Shhh! Sorry but it's kind of narrow here...”</p><p>'Narrow' was the word, all right. They were transported to what looked like an out-of-order bathroom stall, which was clearly designed for one occupant at a time. They got out of it with some difficulties, and they both ignored the surprised look that the man washing his hands gave them through the mirror. They were inside a Muggle fast-food, no doubt about it, and thank Merlin for that, because it was lunch rush and nobody would notice two whole grown men coming out of a toilet they didn't get into.</p><p>It <em> was </em>lunchtime, wasn't it? Though Draco was usually very careful with his eating habits, he felt his mouth watering at the smells. He could really go for that big, three-layered hamburger right now. He dared a glance to Potter and saw his desires mirrored in his expression.</p><p>"We could eat. The train leaves in forty minutes, we have time," he said as if he felt hunger radiating from the body beside him.</p><p>Draco temporarily forgot about his junk food cravings.</p><p>“Train?!”</p><p>“Yes. We're in Edinburgh right now” Potter explained apologetically. “Dunbar is a Muggle town. No Floo Network, no permission to Apparate or use Portkeys”</p><p>Draco made a show of rolling his eyes. He was going to do his bloody job, but no way he wasn't going to complain about every little inconvenience. He would never do this in front of anyone else of course, it would be very unprofessional; however, with Potter, it would feel weird not to because he would know that he was annoyed even if Draco didn't show it.</p><p>What he didn't expect was that smirk he barely glimpsed as Potter turned to consider the menu choices pictured above their heads. Draco nervously swallowed as he did the same.</p><p>They took the CrossCountry train at one forty-four, and by two o'clock Potter had resumed his nap, sprawling across two seats. Draco sat in the row directly ahead, and his snoring pleasantly distracted him whilst he skimmed through 'Inside the Mind of Werewolves: People with Beastly Instincts or Animals with Human Intelligence?'. Not thirty minutes into the journey, it started raining. Draco observed the droplets hitting the glass, casually remembering the train ride to his third year at Hogwarts. He still thought that Potter fainting because of Dementors was pretty funny; not the he-had-so-many-awful-memories-his-body-couldn't-handle-it part, but the he-fell-on-the-floor-unconscious-and-he-had-to-eat-chocolate-to-recover part. Then he remembered the Quidditch match that same year, and his own heart dropping to his stomach when he feared Potter was going to die from the fall. He swallowed. This was the reason why it had been so fucking hard understanding his feelings for Potter. He worried about him all the time but also loved making fun of him in a very mean way. He was so hurt at the beginning of the first year when his friendship offer was refused that his general mindset was a mixture of 'if I can't have him, no one can' and 'he hurt me so he deserves to be hurt'. For years he tried to make him feel miserable and ridicule him so that he would find himself alone, maybe then he would <em> understand </em>. But Draco was always on the losing side when it came to Potter.</p><p>The incorporeal female voice announced their arrival to Dunbar, and thankfully Draco didn't have to wake his colleague up this time, though he did have to remind him to take his messenger bag with him.</p><p>“We might as well check in into the B&amp;B right away," Potter said absently, ruffling his hair further.</p><p>Draco answered with a non-committal hum, forcibly tearing his eyes from that mess of a hairstyle that he definitely found unattractive. Luckily, the place was not far, but there was a lot of wind to add to the rain, so they were both soaked to the bone when they stepped into the warm atrium (they couldn't use magic for 'trivial matters' such as preventing deadly pneumonia, apparently). He let Potter talk with the man at the reception and immediately noticed he held only one key in his hand when he came back. He said nothing, hoping the colour in his cheek would be blamed on the temperature leap.</p><p>Something must have shown on his face, however, because Potter reassured him they would not be using the room a lot.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>They put the bags down and then they were out again, headed to the police station. There they consulted briefly with the Muggle Chief, who was under the impression they were from the London Wildlife Control Unit, and assured his department's full support. They already double checked that no one in the town was keeping a dangerous pet, and though they found an illegal cheetah, they swore there was nothing that could have inflicted that kind of wounds.</p><p>After the useless meeting, Draco and Potter stood for a few minutes outside of the station, sheltered from the rain, as if it could turn into drizzle if they wished it hard enough.</p><p>“Why are we here?” Draco asked.</p><p>“We had to let the Muggle authorities know-”</p><p>“I know that. I mean, why are we in Dunbar so early. It's still three days till the full moon.”</p><p>“We're here to <em> prevent </em> further attacks, not to investigate them after they happen.”</p><p>“How the hell are we supposed to do that? How can I trace someone that I know nothing about? If they are in the animal form...” Draco trailed off.</p><p>"It's the perfect chance to show off your amazing talent, then.”</p><p>Draco ignored the smirk and the mockery, tucking hands underneath his armpits.</p><p>"I want to help them," said Potter unprompted, looking straight ahead.</p><p>“Yes, I do too, but this...”</p><p>“I mean the werewolf. I want to help them. They most likely don't know how to stop.”</p><p>Draco observed his earnest profile, all made of soft curves.</p><p>“I forgot you had a... <em> thing </em> for werewolves.” he teased, trying to lighten up the mood.</p><p>“A thing?” Potter suddenly turned to him, and he didn't look amused. “A thing?! They are people! They don't know what they're doing while they're in that form! They can't stop! And the morning after they remember <em> everything</em>! How do you think they feel? Not all of them are like Greyback, you know!”</p><p>Draco was taken aback by the sudden outburst and was probably gawping at him.</p><p>“Potter...”</p><p>“If you knew you weren't going to take this seriously, you shouldn't have come at all!”</p><p>“Potter, the Statute of Secrecy!” Draco admonished.</p><p>Potter averted his eyes, obviously embarrassed about the outburst but still pissed off, and walked ahead without another word. Shaking himself, Draco followed.</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">

</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Although Potter had said they wouldn't stay much in the B&amp;B room, they spent the rest of the day listening to recordings of interviews the police had conducted with a few eyewitnesses. Most of them said that despite the streets were illuminated both by the full moon and the street lights, they couldn't see much, except for the blurred, huge mass of the creature. Some witnesses had been miles away, or inside their house, so their deposition was very vague.</p><p>Only one of them was helpful.</p><p>
  <em> It was a little after twelve. We were walking home together from a friend's house. Just... chatting, talking about the evening... we hear a low growl, and stop to understand where it comes from... next thing I know, I'm on the asphalt, and my sister is screaming, struggling with this enormous thing that is trying to rip her arm off, and blood is spraying everywhere, and the beast is using its claws to...claw... at her face... and well, I tried to... help her, but that bloody thing was impossible to move, I didn’t have any weapon with me... so I called you, but by the time you came... </em>
</p><p>
  <em> The beast just left? </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Yes, just before she... passed. Like... it didn't care for her, didn't even to try to eat her. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Ma'am, you referred to the creature as a beast now, but when you called earlier you said it was a giant wolf. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Ah, yes... well, it looked like a wolf, but something was off. It had some kind of... intelligent sparkle in its black eyes. That, and... wolves are extinct here, right? It might have been a vicious dog or something. I'm sorry, I don't know anymore... </em>
</p><p>
  <em> One more question ma'am. You were hurt that night. Was it the creature? </em>
</p><p>
  <em> No, actually. While I was trying to help my sister, she accidentally scratched me. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Thank you for your time. Please, if anything new comes to mind... </em>
</p><p>“Sure sounds like a werewolf...” Draco said, if only to break the awkward silence. “Hunting alone, leaving the victim there... it certainly didn't kill to feed. Plus, as the lady said, no wild wolves in Britain, so.”</p><p>Potter was staring thoughtfully at the thing that played the recordings —the leap-top or something.</p><p>“I'm not sure.”</p><p>Draco gawped at him.</p><p>“You're not serious, are you? It attacked twice, both times during the full moon. You think it's a coincidence?”</p><p>“No. But it doesn't mean it's a werewolf.”</p><p>How could he be raising these objections? Was he just trying to irritate him? Draco gathered all his patience with a deep breath.</p><p>“You're not making any sense. Have you ever read 'Howling at the Moon'? It's written by a man affected by lycanthropy, so it's pretty accurate. He says that sometimes he would attack Muggles, knowing that they wouldn't survive, and leave them to be found. And it's not weird that the sister was not attacked, because its mouth was still full of blood, and it probably didn't care for more as of that moment.”</p><p>Potter patiently waited for him to finish.</p><p>“Have you ever seen a werewolf with your own eyes, Malfoy? Up close, I mean.”</p><p>He met his gaze for the first time after the outburst at the police station.</p><p>Draco didn't answer.</p><p>“I have. And let me tell you, its eyes are not intelligent. They're completely mad, and hungry. They don't recognise people, all they see is prey. If the creature had really been a werewolf, she'd be dead. Also, that night it only attacked one person. It was just after twelve. What did it do the rest of the night? Where did it <em> go </em>?”</p><p>“Maybe... there was no one else out?” Draco said tentatively.</p><p>“No one else saw it. There were at least six police officers, four paramedics and a bunch of curious neighbours in that area only. You know it would have come back, smelling all those people.”</p><p>“So what are you trying to say? That it was... an actual wolf? Or a crazy dog?”</p><p>“I don't know... I don't know” Potter replied, tiredly rubbing his face.</p><p>Silence fell again between them, this time a contemplative one. Was this case even related to anything magical?</p><p>“I'm sorry about earlier.”</p><p>Draco's head turned so fast towards Potter that he heard a snap.</p><p>“I shouldn't have mentioned him, I know you didn't like him. Greyback.”</p><p>“How do you know?” Draco asked before he could stop himself.</p><p>“Oh. Er... well...” Potter seemed at a loss for words. “I... you didn't look happy when he appeared at the Astronomy tower.”</p><p>Draco almost fell to the floor trying to sit down on his bed.</p><p>“How do you know?” he repeated on the defensive.</p><p>“I was there. Kind of.”</p><p>No. Not this too. He saw him crying in the bathroom, and he saw him fail when he couldn't kill Dumbledore, too? That... might have been a good thing, actually. Maybe that was why he chose to vouch for him at his trial. But still, he saw him in another one of his darkest moments, and Draco wasn't even aware until now.</p><p>Draco almost asked, <em>why didn't you stop me then?</em>, but he held on tight on that last remnant of pride.</p><p>“You couldn't have been. There was just me and him, and then the Death Eaters came...”</p><p>“I was immobilised under my invisibility cloak” Potter shrugged, clearly not thrilled to talk about the subject either.</p><p>Draco nodded, not trusting himself to speak. After a few seconds, he couldn't bear it anymore and excused himself, mumbling he needed fresh air. He felt Potter's eyes on him, and for once he wished he wouldn't look at him.</p><p>He came back after taking a walk around the neighbourhood protected by a full-body Impervious Charm (he was too upset to get drenched again, damn the Statute of Secrecy); Potter was sitting at the small table, his back to him, so caught up in his writing he didn't even notice him.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Unsurprisingly, Draco dreamt of the Astronomy tower that night.</p><p>Everything was exactly as it happened, except this time, Draco knew Potter was there.</p><p>“Please, help me... You're the Saviour, you're supposed to help me...” he kept pleading to the empty room. Dumbledore looked at him with watery eyes full of compassion. He hated that.</p><p>Suddenly Greyback came into the room, alone this time, and started sniffing at the air.</p><p>“I smell Potty!” he said, salivating. “Where are you, Potty Potty Potty...”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>He was suddenly woken up by the bathroom door closing. The clock on the nightstand between the beds informed him it was seven thirty. Rubbing his eyes, he saw that outside was still dark, but at least it wasn't raining anymore. Or rather, it wasn't raining <em> yet </em>.</p><p>Potter came out of the bathroom fully dressed, stared at him for a few embarrassing seconds, then nodded awkwardly by way of good morning, and Draco did the same as he went into the toilet. He did his best to prepare mentally for the day ahead.</p><p>By eight twenty they were coming out of the Police station, where they asked for permission to see where the last attack took place and get directions. Draco suggested they borrow some police tape, but according to Potter, it did absolutely nothing if civilians tried to cross it. It wasn't even made of sturdy stuff, it ripped quite easily.</p><p>“It doesn't make any sense. Might as well put on signs that say 'please step all over the place', or let them help with the investigation.” Draco drawled, still half asleep.</p><p>"Muggles rely on the people's respect for the law enforcement more than we do.”</p><p>Draco shrugged. He would never understand Muggles. Potter did. Potter was a child of both worlds, he hadn't chosen one over the other. He didn't <em> have to </em> deal with Muggles, but he still did, and he was good at that. Draco was certain that if this case had been given to another Pureblood, let's say, for example, Weasley, they would have blown the Statute of Secrecy ten minutes after setting foot into the town.</p><p>They reached the scene of the last murder. Although it had been almost a month since it happened, they could still check for lingering traces of magic in the air; this procedure would have been impossible if it hadn't been a Muggles-only town.</p><p>Potter cast a Muggle-repelling charm that followed them as they moved, and they started to look for any kind of magic trail. Right where the murder happened, Draco found a faded remnant of something that definitely was not a spell, and was instead similar to the kind of trace some magical creatures left behind. It was so faint that nothing more could be gathered from it.</p><p>“Maybe we could have found something by examining the body... or its blood...” Potter mumbled to himself.</p><p>Draco was glad the body was already six feet under and no samples had been kept, since the case had been archived as a simple animal attack. Only a couple of times he had been asked to find dead bodies, and it hadn't been a pleasurable experience. His work was with the living, and he was thankful for that.</p><p>As they walked around the area once more, to be sure nothing was left overlooked, Draco suddenly jumped and let out a surprised yell when he saw something move at the edge of the street. It was a bloody snake. Potter laughed softly, and Draco hated him.</p><p>Potter stopped and crouched next to it, starting to chit-chat with the creature. It was fascinating, if only a bit ridiculous. The creature must have been three feet long, with a dark coloured body and a yellow collar.</p><p>Potter's expression turned very serious very suddenly, and his tone suggested urgency, while the snake answered just inches from his face. The whole exchange took four minutes at most.</p><p>“Malfoy, come here... come on, it's just a grass snake, it's not dangerous! She said she was in the area when the murder took place, and she is perfectly willing to help... if we feed her something good.”</p><p>Draco lifted his eyebrow at the snake, who was disconcertingly staring at him and flicking its tongue.</p><p>“Er... something in particular?”</p><p>“It must be small enough to fit in her mouth. 'Anything but toads', she said”</p><p>Draco sighed. Was he to be a snake's errand boy now?</p><p>“How about a mouse? A rat?” Draco suggests “Is there a, er, Muggle menagerie in this town?”</p><p>Potter crossed his arms.</p><p>“I'm not <em> buying </em> her a hamster to eat, Malfoy”</p><p>“Then <em> what </em>?”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Half an hour later, the snake was happily gobbling down half a dozen eggs from the store, not minding the fact that they weren't alive. Its body looked very weird after the meal.</p><p>Potter patiently waited, then started asking questions, nodding gravely while he listened.</p><p>“Come on,” he said, getting up from where he was crouching “she wants to show us something.”</p><p>As they walked to the mysterious location, Potter brought him up to speed with the interrogation.</p><p>"She said it was a weird creature, never seen before, and its smell... was that of a predator, but also had 'undertones of human' -her words-, but the vibrations she felt from its movements were very much animal-like. So I don't know, I think we're circling back to the werewolf theory here... Oh, she also said the leather of your shoes smell weird.”</p><p>Turns out the snake was taking them to her favourite pond, where she was happily swimming around when she felt the beast running in the vicinity. They checked for clues, but after all the time that passed (and the rain), there was nothing except for the faint trace of magic they found at the scene of the murder.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>“I'm still not convinced," said Potter for the sixth time as they were looking for a place to eat lunch.</p><p>“I've been thinking...” Draco began, immediately catching Potter's attention. Well, that was a first. He continued, "What about the Imperius curse? Wait, let me explain. Let's suppose werewolves are not sentient during a full moon, therefore not cursable in that state. What if they were cursed while in human form, would the spell still be active when they transformed?”</p><p>“Hm. I honestly don't know.”</p><p>They had some troubles choosing between an Italian restaurant and a fish and chips in High street but in the end, they chose the one Potter wanted, because he was the Head of Auror's Department and because he had Draco wrapped around his finger.</p><p>“Wait a minute,” Potter said suddenly, a forkful of pasta alla bolognese two inches from his mouth, “We were having troubles finding a single wizard in a Muggle town; now you say we're looking for two? Is it possible that they live here but don't practice any magic at all?”</p><p>“Forget about it. It was a stupid idea. I don't know what to look for any more”</p><p>“I don't think it's stupid. Let's keep it in mind.”</p><p>Draco didn't know what surprised him more, the validation of his theory or the earnest tone he used.</p><p>“All right then... Should we start looking in the neighbouring area?”</p><p>Potter sighed.</p><p>“I think so. But first I want to take a look at the other two crime scenes.”</p><p>Predictably, they didn't find anything new, and then it started to rain again, so they had to take shelter under porches while Draco discreetly tried to track magic sources in various parts of the small town.</p><p>“Nothing," he said for the hundredth time, shaking his head. So the werewolf wasn't there. They probably lived outside town, maybe in a neighbouring community, maybe alone in a country cottage or something. The day was nearly over and they made little to no progress. Just one more day to go, and then the full moon would be upon them.</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">

</p><p align="center"> </p><p>“So what are we going to do tomorrow?”, Draco asked while hanging up his soaking wet coat.</p><p>All he heard was a discouraged sigh from behind, and as he turned to the room he barely contained a choked sound from escaping his lips.</p><p>Potter had removed his own coat before him, and his jacket too, so that he was now only wearing his white shirt, which was damp and sticking to Potter's skin, leaving very little to the imagination. For a handful of seconds, Draco was unable to move or say anything.</p><p>Luckily, Potter was engrossed in checking some new letters that landed on the desk while they were gone, and didn't notice anything. When he (seemingly absent-mindedly) raised his fingers to undo the shirt buttons, Draco hurriedly said he was going to take a shower first, and went into the bathroom without waiting for Potter's reply.</p><p>He came out of it refreshed in spirit and physically warm, and all he would have wanted was a good meal and a night of good sleep, but he knew that was wishful thinking. They went over the case once again while eating a mediocre take-out dinner in their room, trying to see something new, thinking about new questions to ask the snake, scrambling their brains for knowledge they might have overlooked. After a couple of fruitless hours of conversation, they resolved to study each other's notes in the hope that a different wording of the same thoughts would bring something new to the table.</p><p>“Dammit!”</p><p>Draco was so surprised by the unexpected cry that the notes slipped from his fingers, ending up at his feet.</p><p>“What?” he asked, rubbing an eye with a hand and picking the notes with the other.</p><p>“Just.. fuck! We can't predict where it will hit! Catching them while in their human form was the only way to ensure no one got hurt! How am I supposed to...”</p><p>Draco looked at how worried Potter's expression was, how his hands did these big, useless gestures, how he kept bobbing his knee and biting his lower lip... Potter was <em> very </em> anxious.</p><p>During their previous partnerships, he always seemed to know what to do, but now he looked like a scared Auror trainee on his first mission. Draco's first instinct was to pat his shoulder and tell him that they were going to catch the bloody werewolf because they were the best the Ministry had to offer; he mentally slapped himself for even having that thought.</p><p>“No one will get hurt,” he said instead. "The police has already issued a curfew so that we will be the only ones outside at night. Besides, we'll be dressed like Muggles. We just need to keep our wands out of sight and the beast will come to us on its own.”</p><p>And just as he said it, he knew it was true. It was so simple. Yes, it would have been ideal to find the person <em> before </em> the full moon came; but even in the worst case scenario, they could catch it and no one but them would be in danger.</p><p>Potter's nervous ticks stopped all at once as he considered the plan; Draco just wished he wouldn't stare at him so intently as he did so.</p><p>“Wow, Malfoy. You're right, it <em> is </em> that simple. Now you're just making me look bad” Potter said finally, apparently approving of his plan.</p><p>Draco had to look away in embarrassment, pretending to be very interested in Potter's barely legible handwriting.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The first thing to do the next morning was visiting the police station. Once again, Potter did all the talking, and he was very vague about the details, asking that the curfew be extended “Until we catch our killer”, as if that night wasn't their only chance.</p><p>“Well, let's hope he doesn't hit tonight, or people will really start thinking it's a werewolf!” the chief of police said, laughing nervously.</p><p>“Muggles know about werewolves?” Draco whispered as they left the station's outer gate behind them.</p><p>“Yes, but they don't <em> believe </em> in them. They think of them as mythical creatures, like... like chimaeras and phoenixes” Potter gestured vaguely.</p><p>Draco nodded, pretending to have known that Muggles didn't believe in the existence of chimaeras and phoenixes.</p><p>Before going to lunch, they visited once again the last murder scene, then walked to the snake's pond. She was happily (or so Draco assumed) swallowing a toad, and she seemed glad to see them (again, from a non-Parseltongue speaker point of view). Potter chatted a bit with her, while Draco pretended not to sneak looks in their directions to understand whether they were talking about his clothes behind his back.</p><p>“Alright, let's have lunch," Potter said, walking in his direction. “I'm starving.”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>“You know what? I could really go for a walk right now.”</p><p>Draco shrugged in response. It wasn't as if they could do much more in those few hours before dark.</p><p>The seaside was grey and deserted and sad, but Draco liked it. He liked all things sad. Potter mumbled to himself beside him, and he felt a weird sense of peace in his chest, as if they were two friends walking together in comfortable silence and were not going to risk their lives that night.</p><p>“What the <em> hell </em> is that?”</p><p>Draco stopped in his tracks, and Potter did the same, searching for the source of Draco's confusion. There was a bridge in the water. Like, in the middle of it. It wasn't linking two earth lids. It was literally useless.</p><p>Potter started laughing, almost hysterically, and if Draco hadn't felt like he was laughing at him, he would have joined him. Maybe it was a Muggle thing that he couldn't comprehend.</p><p>“I don't know!” Potter said, catching his breath. “It must be... some kind... of art installation or something... Oh fuck, your <em> face </em>!”</p><p>Though Draco felt mildly insulted, he hated it much more when the sound of laughter died down, and the stern expression came back on Potter's face.</p><p>He turned to watch the bridge again, trying to imagine what it would be like to be there for a vacation instead of work, as a couple instead of two people with a purely professional relationship.</p><p>“Let's go back to the B&amp;B. We have a long night ahead of us.”</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">

</p><p align="center"> </p><p>They decided which route each of them had to take on a town map replica they bought in a small souvenir shop. Splitting gave them more chances to find -or rather, be found by- the werewolf: whoever saw it first would shoot red sparks overhead immediately, so that the other one could Apparate to that location. After Draco explained his plan, Potter apparently spent most of the previous night writing to the Ministry to ask permission to use magic in the town, which he was easily granted: a squad of Obliviators would arrive the following morning to wipe the memories of potential Muggle witnesses.</p><p>Though Draco managed to hide his anxiety in front of Potter, once he found himself walking alone on the wet pavement, he kept looking up at the sky, frantically searching for red sparks. If Potter died on his watch... of course on one hand Draco would be finally free, in so <em> many </em> ways, but on the other, he would also lose the chance at his only goal in life. While he thought about this, he deliberately overlooked how he would feel for the loss of the only person he ever had any romantic interest for. There was no point in considering that, because Draco would have died before something like that ever happened.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The evening seemed to proceed very slowly. At ten he met Potter for a check in; then they went back each to his own route. At about eleven thirty the sky started to get cloudy, and by the time they met again at midnight, it was raining heavily. According to Potter, a werewolf wouldn't transform into their wolf form if the moon was not visible; he wasn't sure what would happen if they were already transformed and the moon was temporarily hidden.</p><p>“What if there is no attack tonight?” Draco asked. “Will we come back the next full moon?”</p><p>Potter failed to hide an amused smile that, surprisingly, Draco didn't find annoying at all. "Oh no, I don't think I can take another day of vacation this year. I'm surprised I still haven't received a Howler from Letty telling me the office is flooded with paperwork.”</p><p>His tone was light, but it was clear he was dreading the moment he would return to the Ministry.</p><p>“Why did you even accept the promotion if you like field work best?” Draco asked before he could stop himself.</p><p>Potter considered him for long seconds before waving the question aside with his hand.</p><p>“As much as I'd love to talk about my life decisions with you, Malfoy, this werewolf isn't going to catch itself. Chop-chop!”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It finally happened, at two forty in the morning. The rain was now barely a drizzle and visibility was rather good under street lamps and in their general vicinity. Before he saw it though, he heard it. A growl so low Draco had the impression he felt it vibrate in his bones- he barely had the time to send red sparks through the air and the beast was upon him.</p><p>As he rolled away from its trajectory, he heard Potter perform a binding curse on the creature (no doubt his Auror experience trained his reflexes better that Draco's desk job) but the wolf tore its ropes like cobwebs and charged for a new attack, directed at Potter this time.</p><p>Draco acted before he had time to think about it: his feet stumbled on the wet cobblestones, his hands trying to grasp at the air, hoping that it would help him go faster, or at least fast enough- <em> fuck, please, let me do this right </em></p><p>-and sure enough, Draco felt a sharp, burning pain in his forearm as the beast's jaws closed around it and tried to rip it off.</p><p>Struggling to stay focused, he flicked his wand to whatever body part of the creature was the closest, but nothing happened. He was barely aware of Potter screaming spells from behind him (all of which bounced off from the target), holding his shoulder, trying to get the werewolf to release Draco's arm without tearing it away. After what seemed like an hour, a Stunner accidentally hit the nose of the wolf, who had to release Draco's arm to sneeze. Potter violently pulled him back, making him fall on his bottom: only then Draco realized he had been screaming non-stop since he had been bitten.</p><p>Between the sharp pain, his own bellowing, Potter's spells flying through the air one after the other and the beast's growling, he couldn't really tell what the hell was going on. The least he could do was shooting some curses, so he went for his wand, and that's when he noticed it was missing. Fuck. Not again.</p><p>Draco's vision started to blur more and more as he blindly felt the asphalt around him searching for his wand. He wasn't sure if the sudden absence of battle noises was because his senses were dimming or because something terrible happened, so he called for Potter.</p><p>In a second he was beside him, gently taking Draco's injured arm to check the wound.</p><p>“Malfoy... you need some silver and dittany as soon as possible”</p><p>“What about... the wolf?”</p><p>“It doesn't matter-”</p><p>“What... about it?”</p><p>"It ran away," Potter said with a hint of bitterness.</p><p>Of course it was Draco's fault. Luckily, he had a trick up his sleeve. He grabbed a handful of Potter's collar with his good arm and brought his face way closer than he intended.</p><p>“Promise me you won't go running after it.”</p><p>“How am I supposed to...?”</p><p>“Promise,” he hissed, trying not to groan in pain.</p><p>“All right. I promise,” Potter said. He couldn't see his face but he clearly heard the eye-roll in his tone.</p><p>“Brilliant. Well, I might have put a Tracker spell on it. It's going to last twelve hours, enough time for you to contact the Werewolf Capture Unit... Now bring me to a fucking Healer, I think I'm going to pass out.”</p><p>As soon as he said that, he lost consciousness.</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">

</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Unsurprisingly, he woke up in a hospital bed. He sure hoped it wasn't a Muggle hospital.</p><p>Surprisingly, though, after gaining control of his senses, he noticed Potter's figure sitting on a chair to his right, reading the Prophet.</p><p>“Potter?” he inquired, his voice drowsy and more drawled than ever.</p><p>Potter immediately put down the paper and inspected him closely. Draco barely had the time to feel embarrassed that Potter flicked a finger at his nose, drawing a surprised noise from him.</p><p>“Are you mental, Malfoy? What the fuck were you thinking, uh? You have a death wish or something?”</p><p>“You could just say, thank you for saving my life Malfoy, I wouldn't be here without you!”</p><p>“No, I won't, because I'm pretty sure that wasn't some heroic act! You <em> must </em> want something in return... So, what is it? A special interview where I admit the town is safe only thanks to you? A public handshake in front of the whole wizard community?”</p><p>Draco felt hurt and insulted at the same time. He was going to say something bitter to make Potter feel bad, but whatever potion had been given to him to ease the pain decided to do the talking for him.</p><p>“I don't want <em> anything </em>from you, Potter. I wish I never had to see you again after the trials but I did have one -or rather two- huge debts to repay, didn't I? So yes, it wasn't a 'heroic act' and I don't want you to think it was. Just... accept it and shut up, alright? One more stupid stunt like this and I will be out of your life forever.”</p><p>Potter's expression went through a range of emotions during this small monologue.</p><p>“What the fuck, Malfoy. I don't want you to repay me for the times I saved your life -which, by the way, are definitely more than two. I do things because I think they're right. I never wanted to be paid back.”</p><p>“That's your whole thing, isn't it?”</p><p>“Yes. And anyway, paying this huge debt to me is so important that you'd rather become a werewolf in my place than let me get hurt? Because, you should know, I definitely wasn't going to be killed by that attack. ”</p><p>Draco stared dumbly at Potter, momentarily not getting where this was coming from. Then it dawned on him.</p><p>“Oh. <em> Shit </em>.”</p><p>“Good job, Malfoy. A very brilliant mind. And here I was, ready to put in a good word for you with the Head of MLE...”</p><p>“Shit, I didn't even think about... Wait, what? You would?”</p><p>“Not sure if you deserve it. We don't value suicidal tendencies that much in our Department.”</p><p>"All right, all right, I get it. So, er... What is the policy on werewolves as of late?”</p><p>Potter stared at him for the longest time before rolling his eyes and answering.</p><p>“You're not a werewolf, Malfoy. The guy was an Animagus.”</p><p>“<em> What?! </em>”</p><p>“Yes, my first hunch was right. The Werewolf Capture Unit followed your Tracker spell and found this guy who lives in a shack in the middle of nowhere, so far from Dunbar that they had to Apparate to go there. And anyway, he has no sign of being our man except for the Tracker. Well, a couple of drops of Veritaserum and he confessed just in time for the morning Prophet. Page 9.”</p><p>He threw the paper on Draco's lap. There was a small two-column on the case, no pictures, on how a simple wizard who didn't attend any magic schools somehow learned to transform in a wolf-like creature and used it as a device to terrorize a Muggle town. Draco noticed how his name was listed right next to Potter's for importance and felt a burst of pride in his chest. He wondered if his mother read the paper that morning.</p><p>“So... I'm not a werewolf.”</p><p>“Nope.”</p><p>“Are you sure?”</p><p>“I'm not. But the Healers who checked on you are, so I'd say it's pretty safe.”</p><p>Draco sighed with relief. He really didn't think about the consequences when he jumped in front of Potter, and to tell the truth, he probably would have done it anyway... but Potter didn't need to know any of that.</p><p>"Well, I have to get back to work. Turns out my office is indeed flooded with paperwork, but Letty didn't want to distract me from my quest with such a trivial thing. So, er... get well soon, I guess.” he waved awkwardly from the door.</p><p>“All right” Draco replied, even more awkwardly. He wished they had more time to discuss the whole I-will-recommend-you-to-the-MLE thing. Not that he was considering becoming an Auror. Or maybe he was? He felt his head pulse and become heavier by the minute, a bit of feeling was coming back to his bandaged arm, and it wasn't a good one. A nurse entered the room with a big glass of clear azure potion for him, and as soon as he drank it he slipped into an easy sleep.</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">

  <em> Two days after the full moon </em>
</p><p>Harry sighed tiredly, letting go of the quill to rotate his right wrist, hoping this would be enough to alleviate the pain. Only back two days, and already feeling the old bones protesting. Merlin, how he enjoyed that little getaway in Dunbar. Back on the field, actually helping people by doing something concrete. It had been quick and clean, little to no Muggle witnesses, no ulterior casualties... the Auror's dream, basically. Well, besides the injured colleague, that is, but Malfoy would be on his feet in a day or two, so it wasn't that bad.</p><p>Ah, Malfoy. Harry accidentally let it slip that he thought he would be a good Auror. After hearing why the guy sacrificed his arm though... not so sure he wanted him taking up cases with his office anymore, let alone work in it. But he <em> was </em> good, and ex-Death Eaters were allowed to work in MLE Departments now. Malfoy was an adult; if running in circles around Harry hoping to take a bullet for him was what he wanted, it was not his responsibility to prevent him to do so. Except, if the Head of MLE did allow him to join the Auror's Department (and there was really no reason not to, with Harry Potter's recommendation), it <em> was </em> going to be his responsibility.</p><p>Harry sighed again. It was useless to think about it, since he had already asked for an official evaluation for Malfoy as soon as he came back from Dunbar. And, what was he doing, when he still had so much paperwork to catch up to?</p><p>He hadn't heard a peep from Malfoy since he saw him in the hospital; not that he was expecting him to write, being convalescent and all, but Harry did send him a Patronus yesterday to inform him of the evaluation, and he didn't receive as much as a <em> thank you, Potter </em>. He supposed he deserved it, since he didn't thank him for saving his life with the wolf. They were, basically, back to being childishly annoying to each other.</p><p>Not a great start for their future work together.</p><p> </p><p align="center"><br/> <img src="https://image.ibb.co/e6oOYp/div2.png" alt="" width="226" height="100" align="center" data-pagespeed-url-hash="460078179" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);" data-pagespeed-url-hash="460078179" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);"/></p><p align="center"> </p>
