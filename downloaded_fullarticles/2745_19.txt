    <p>Newt didn't just come to New York to pass through to get to Arizona and release Frank back into the wild. No, he had heard about what was happening in New York, had gotten news of the destruction of all that was going on. And it all pointed to an Obscurial, at least, that's what Newt is thinking so far.</p><p>Snapping the clasp on his case shut again, he walked through customs easily, making his way out to the streets of New York. Somehwere in this city, there would be another Obscurial. Some poor child who had to hide their magic and had learned to resent it. It was a painful thought, but one Newt had met with a lot of the time already.</p><p>“This great city sparkles with the jewels of man's inventions. Movie theaters, automobiles, the wireless, electric lights, all dazzle and bewitch us.”, a woman's voice rang through the small crowd of people that had gathered, into which Newt accidentally walked. He bumped into another lady, softly excusing himself.<br/>
“But where there is light, there is shadow, friend.”, the woman continued. Newt could see her now, standing on the stairs leading to a building. There was a banner next to her, hands holding a broken -wand? And fire beneath it.<br/>
“Something is stalking our city, wreaking destruction, and then disappearing without a trace! Listen to me. We have to fight. Join us, the Second Salemers, in our fight.”, she was raising his voice, and Newt had gotten to almost the front of the crowd, taking in the picture of the woman.<br/>
“You hear me? We have to fight together, for the sake of our-”, a man fell over Newt's case, which he had just put down to not strain his arm as he listened to the woman. Newt was quick to pick up his case again, checking that it was still closed.<br/>
“So sorry, my case..”, he said, watching the burly man stand up again.<br/>
“No harm done.”, he replied, though looked slightly exasperated. He turned to hurry up the steps, groaning a “Excuse me” as he went past the lady, and a young girl holding flyers in her hand.</p><p>“You!”, the woman who had talked said then, pointing straight at Newt. “Friend.”. Newt looked confused at her, did she mean him? Surely she did, looking at him like that. She was coming down a few steps, so she wouldn't have to yell to talk to Newt.<br/>
“What drew you to our meeting today?”, she asked, seemingly genuinely curious.<br/>
“O-oh, I was just passing.”, Newt replied, motioning slightly with his free hand. He hadn't intended to really stay and listen, but her speech had made him curious.<br/>
“Are you a seeker?”, she asked then, “A seeker after truth?”.<br/>
Newt didn't quite understand what she was asking for. “I'm more of a chaser, really.”, he answered nonetheless. He did chase whatever he had to after all.</p><p>“Hear my words.”, the woman was addressing the crowd again, voice raised and her gaze lifted from Newt -who was very thankful for that. He hated eye contact. “And heed my warning. And laugh if you dare!”, she seemed quite serious.<br/>
“Witches live among us.”, she said, and Newt felt slightly called out. He had just been addressed, and was very much a wizard. “We have to fight together, for the sake of our children! For the sake of tomorrow!”.<br/>
Newt noticed a young man handing out flyers, and curiously approached. He was slightly hunched over, not making eye contact, and barely raising his gaze whenever someone took an offered flyer from his hands.<br/>
“What do you say to that, friend?”, the woman addressed Newt again, who had his eyes somewhere else at the moment. He could see his niffler up the stairs, pulling a hat close to himself and pulling out the shiny coins inside of it.</p><p>“Excuse me.”, Newt hurried past the woman up the stairs, hoping he'd be able to catch the niffler again quickly. He would keep this in mind, though. The Second Salemers, hateful towards witches -and thus wizard-kind. It seemed like a perfect place for an Obscurial to grow, if one of the children were exposed to such hate constantly. He would have to investigate later, though. Right now, he had a niffler to catch.</p><p>Newt tried to hurry through the mass of people inside of the bank, chasing after his niffler. He could see it every now and then, pulling off shiny things from people's clothes, jumping into purses, tugging at clasps of suitcases. Newt hoped he could catch it but- the niffler got on the other side of where the public was allowed, and Newt had to act.<br/>
And then there was this person who somehow had gotten ahold of the occamy egg he had been carrying, and he <em>had</em> to use magic to get his egg and also get to find his niffler. This was all very very bad.</p><p>He saw his niffler squeeze into the vault, right after his occamy hatched in his hands and he had put it back into his case. With a simple “<em>Alohomora</em>” the vault was opening, though he could hear someone come down the steps. He couldn't let anyone see him, and the muggle. It would just be a mess for him to get caught opening the vault, and the muggle would get into trouble with the police force most likely as well.<br/>
“Stay quiet.”, Newt told the man and quickly cast a disillusionment charm over him, before facing whoever was coming. When the man stopped, Newt quickly cast a “<em>Petrificus Totalus</em>” on the man, before hurrying into the open vault. He grabbed the niffler with a shake of his head, shaking him upside-down until every last bit of gold and coins had fallen out of his pouch. He obliviated the man who had came down to the vault and lifted the charm off of the muggle, before apparating outside of the bank with him.</p><p>“Right. For the last time, you pilfering pest, paws off what doesn't belong to you.”, Newt set his case down and opened it with his free hand not holding the niffler. He put the little creature inside his case and quickly closed it again, pushing closed the clasps. Standing again, he turned towards the muggle, who was pressed against the wall. “Awfully sorry about that.”.<br/>
“What the hell was that?”, the muggle asked, pressed against the wall, watching almost fearful at Newt. Newt wasn't liking what he had to do, but he'd get in trouble if he didn't obliviate him.<br/>
“Nothing that need concern you.”, Newt replied. “Now, unfortunately, you have seen far too much.”. He pulled the muggle off the wall by his coat, before straightening the man's clothes again.<br/>
“If you wouldn't mind, if you just stand there, this'll be over in a jiffy.”. He turned away from the man to pull out his wand.<br/>
“Mh-hm, sure, yeah.”, the muggle muttered. He grabbed one of the two cases on the ground -they looked pretty identical- and quickly hit Newt over the head with it, before hurrying out of the alley they were in, a shaky “sorry” leaving him.</p><p>Newt wasn't too hurt by it, though his head ached now, and he stood back up, watching the man hurry away. “Bugger.”, he sighed. That would probably come and bite him in the arse later.<br/>
Seeing a woman hurriedly walking into the alley he was in, Newt stepped out of sight. Taking a deep breath, he grabbed his case, before he made his way out and walked calmly. He tried to keep his gaze lowered, glancing at the woman again and again. And when he was just passing him, he barely had time to feel her touch and the pull of apparation.</p><p>“Who are you?”, the woman was panting slightly, probably having chased around after him. Bugger.<br/>
“I'm sorry.”, Newt said quietly, glancing at the woman as he leaned against the wall where they were hiding, not daring to look at her.<br/>
“Who are you?”, she repeated again, voice quieter than before. Finally, Newt looked up at her, though didn't look into her eyes, keeping his gaze lower.<br/>
“Newt Scamander. And you are?”, he replied, though she talked right over him after he said his name.<br/>
“What's that thing in your case?”, she asked, clearly unhappy, motioning at the case at Newt's side.<br/>
“That's my niffler.”, Newt said, looking down at his case and away from her, before he glanced at her again.<br/>
“Say, you've got something on your-”, he raised his hand, which came close to touching her, making the woman flinch back and him shut up.<br/>
“Why in the name of Deliverance Dane did you let that thing loose?”, she asked, exasperated.<br/>
“I didn't mean to. He's incorrigible, you see.”, Newt replied, gaze going up, not wanting to look at her, before looking back down at his case, and then at her again. “Anything shiny, he's all over-”.<br/>
“You didn't mean to?”, she cut him off.<br/>
“No.”.<br/>
“You could not have chosen a worse time to let that creature loose.”, she said, sighing. “We're in the middle of a situation here!”.<br/>
“I'm taking you in.”, she said, looking rather unhappy, pulling something out of her grey overcoat.<br/>
“Was it- taking me in where?”, Newt asked, looking around, not liking this. He had more important things to do! Like searching for the Obscurial, and then go to Arizona to free Frank. And he desperately had to check in on his case, and its inhabitants.</p><p>“Magical Congress of the United States of America.”, she replied, holding out her Identification Card for him to see. He watched her quietly as she put it away again.<br/>
“So you work for MACUSA.”, he said, voice soft. This was going to be a problem. Maybe he could get out of this alright, without too much trouble. He had taken care that nothing was stolen from the bank, there had been no alarm, and the worker inside was obliviated. Only the muggle that had been with him had escaped without being obliviated.<br/>
“What are you, some kind of investigator?”, Newt asked, wondering why she bothered with him. He hadn't been able to read what she was on the card for the moment she had held it out to him.<br/>
She avoided the question though, which seemed rather suspicious to him, but what was he to do? Call her out on it? Definitely not.<br/>
“At least tell me you took care of the No-Maj.”, she said then, hoping that there would be no further trouble with this man. Other than that creature of his, and whatever else he might have in that case of his. Enlargement charms were illegal.<br/>
“The what?”, Newt asked, confused. What in the world was a No-Maj?<br/>
“The No-Maj.”, she repeated, looking at him like she couldn't believe he didn't understand. “No-Magic. The non-wizard!”.<br/>
Newt made a sound of realization, nodding his head. “Oh, sorry. We call them muggles.”, he tried to excuse himself.<br/>
“You wiped his memory, right?”, she asked, disregarding his words. “The No-Maj with the case?”.<br/>
Newt stayed quiet, not able to lie to her. He was a terrible liar, he just couldn't bring himself to. “Uhm..”.<br/>
“Oh..”, the woman sighed. “That's a Section 3-A, Mr Scamander.”, she said, and she sounded like she regretted the words, which Newt really didn't understand. “I'm taking you in.”.</p><p>With that, she grabbed his arm, and apparated again.</p><p>After a bit of a small mayhem in the Woolworth building -Newt couldn't help but think how his friend would love to be here and see this- Goldstein -the woman having taken him in- was going to open his case, in the presence of this Abernathy, and Director Graves. But, the opening revealed only pastries inside the case, and Newt couldn't have been more scared. That muggle- he must have grabbed his case instead of his own!</p><p>“I can't believe you didn't obliviate that man.”, Tina said as they walked together along the street, the woman carrying the case with the pastries. “If there's an inquiry, I'm finished.”.<br/>
“Why would you be finished?”, Newt asked, curious. “I'm the one that's-”<br/>
“I'm not supposed to go near the Second Salemers.”, she interrupted him, making Newt shut up. How awfully rude of her to interrupt him all the time. They stopped walking when something flew in front of them -a Billywig. It was quick to fly off again, and Newt's attention was immediately on his case, walking again.<br/>
“What was that?”, Tina asked, following Newt.<br/>
“Uh, moth, I think. Big moth.”, Newt replied, and they could hear the riot of people around the corner. Newt knew that if a billywig had gotten out, there must have been more.</p><p>Newt and Tina approached, hearing the crowd of people around an officer, standing in front of a partly collapsed building. While passing, Newt could hear a man talking about the Erumpent, and silently cast a spell to change his memory and his words, so they all claimed it was another gas explosion that had caused this.<br/>
With no one's attention on Newt, he quickly entered the building, while Tina stayed behind, looking up at yet another billywig in the air. Once she noticed Newt wasn't at her side anymore, she hurried to follow him inside.<br/>
By now, Newt had already found the muggle. Collapsed, laying on the ground, with two bloody puncture wounds on his neck.<br/>
“Mr Scamander!”, he could hear Tina call faintly, probably just having entered the building. Quickly, he cast a “<em>Reparo</em>”, the building fixing itself with the motions of his wand. He quickly sat down once finished, grabbing his case -<em>his</em> case- and opening, looking inside to try and see from up here if he could tell who was gone. He was quick to close it again when he heard Tina though, shutting the clasps as she entered the room he was in.</p><p>“It was open?”, she asked, almost in disbelief. Well, he would've been too, if he didn't know the clasp was broken, and thus made it far too easy for the creatures to escape.<br/>
“Just a smidge.”, Newt replied, looking at Tina with wide eyes, hoping she wouldn't try and take his case from him. He had to protect his creatures, and his friend.<br/>
“That crazy Niffler thing's on the loose again?”, Tina asked, hoping against hope it wouldn't be.<br/>
“Uh... might be.”, Newt replied, an uncertain smile on his lips. Probably not just the niffler was gone, judging from the damage to the building there had been.<br/>
“Then look for it.”, Tina said, before setting the other case down and hurrying into the room, finally having noticed the muggle on the ground.<br/>
“Look! Oh...”, she made a worried sound, crouching down by the muggle. “His neck's bleeding.”, she noted, looking at Newt almost accusingly, before focusing on the man again.<br/>
“He's hurt! Oh... Wake up! Mr No-Maj.”, she tried, before something hissed, and she yelped, falling backwards onto the ground, as a creature jumped out. Newt was quick to react and grabbed it though, setting his case on the ground to open it and drop it inside.<br/>
“What on earth is that?”, Tina asked, staying on the ground, watching warily.<br/>
“It's nothing to worry about.”, Newt replied, while the muggle had managed to push himself up, rubbing his forehead and eyes -probably sporting a headache.</p><p>“That is a Murtlap.”, Newt answered then, closing his case once more, looking over at Tina.<br/>
“What else have you got in there?”, she asked, very unhappy about this entire situation. Thankfully, he was spared an answer, as the muggle finally got to his senses and saw Newt.<br/>
“You?”, he spoke, in slight disbelief.<br/>
“Hello.”, Newt greeted and smiled at the muggle, probably slightly strained. When the man tried to stand up, Tina was quick to stop him.<br/>
“Easy, Mr..”, she said, getting back into a crouching position.<br/>
“Kowalski. Jacob.”, the muggle replied, exasperated. He sounded as unhappy about the situation like he looked like. His day must've been rather bad.<br/>
Newt pulled his wand out, ready to obliviate the muggle finally. But then, Tina threw herself in front of him.<br/>
“You can't obliviate him.”, she said, “We need him as a witness.”.<br/>
Newt lowered his wand, shaking his head lightly, not understanding this madness. “I'm sorry. You've just yelled at me the length of New York for not doing it in the first place.”, he really didn't understand this woman.<br/>
“He's hurt! He looks ill!”, Tina argued, the muggle behind her, already dizzy again.<br/>
“He'll be fine. Murtlap bites aren't serious.”, Newt argued, thought the muggle -Jacob- was groaning, clearly feeling terrible. Tina gave a pointed look at Newt at the sounds.<br/>
“Yeah, I admit that is a slightly more severe reaction than I've seen.”, Newt said, gaze flicking around the room, uncomfortable. “But if it was really serious, he'd have-”, he cut himself off, slightly uncomfortable. Jacob was on his arms and knees, and Tina behind him was getting back up on her feet. Jacob was pulling himself up along the wall, on his knees still.<br/>
“What?”, Tina prompted Newt to continue, who could barely look at her.<br/>
“Well the first symptom would be flames out of his anus.”, he explained, words more quick than before. “He doesn't seem to-”<br/>
“This is balled up!”, Tina interrupted, as she seemed to like doing.<br/>
“It'll last 48 hours at the most.”, Newt continued. “I can keep him, if you want me to.”, even though he really didn't want to do that. He was sure his friend would love another person to talk to for a while, but..</p><p>“Keep him?”, Tina interrupted his thoughts. “We don't keep them! Mr Scamander, do you know anything about the wizarding community in America?”. She was clearly tired of Newt and his ways, his way of thinking and doing.<br/>
“I do know a few things, actually.”, Newt replied and nodded. “I know that you have rather backwards laws about relations with Non-Magic people.”. He even managed to look her in the eyes to say that, because he really thought these laws were stupid. “That you're not meant to befriend them. That you can't marry them, which seems mildly absurd to me.”.<br/>
“Who's gonna marry him?”, Tina asked, motioning to Jacob for a moment, and very much missing Newt's point. Making the man look at her with wide eyes, and not even getting a chance to answer.<br/>
“You're both coming with me.”, she said, walking over to Jacob, to help him onto his feet finally.<br/>
“I don't see why I need to come with you.”, Newt said. He had to go find and capture his creatures again.<br/>
“Help me.”, Tina disregarded his words again, as Jacob couldn't hold himself on his feet, clutching onto her tightly.<br/>
“I'm dreaming, right?”, Jacob asked, collapsing back to the ground, Tina not really able to hold him up. “Yeah.”, Jacob continued.<br/>
Tina looked up at Newt. “Please.”.<br/>
“I'm tired.”, Jacob was talking to himself. “I never went to the bank.”.<br/>
Newt finally went to help, setting his case down to help get Jacob onto his feet.<br/>
“This is all just some big nightmare, right?”.<br/>
“For the both of us, Mr Kowalski.”, Tina said, an arm of Jacob's slung over her shoulders, while Newt held Jacob's other arm. They apparated away again, once Newt grabbed his case again.</p><p>After a forced dinner with Tina and her sister -a natural Legilimens, great- Newt was more than glad when he could finally go down into his case. He really needed to check on his creatures, and he had to take care of Jacob as well, and his friend-</p><p>Once Newt was down the case, and made sure wave Jacob down as well, he was immediately tackled in a hug, making him stumble a few steps back with a soft laugh.<br/>
“Mom!”, a child called, barely reaching Newt's hips, holding onto him tightly. The young boy was barely ten years old, skin dark and hair a bright straw-blond. His right eye a dark brown, and his left eye a bright blue.<br/>
“Yes yes Seraph. I'm here.”, Newt said, picking the child up and stepping away from the ladder. He didn't want to be in the way when Jacob eventually stumbled in. A wise decision, as Jacob fell down a few seconds later, having missed the thin ladder.</p><p>“Who's that?”, Seraph asked, curiously looking towards Jacob, who had righted himself and pressed himself back against the ladder, looking around the messy shed.<br/>
“That's Jacob Kowalski.”, Newt replied, setting Seraph down onto his desk. “Will you sit down?”, he asked Jacob, who nodded, sitting with a muttered “Good idea.”.<br/>
“I'm Seraph Scamander!”, Seraph called, smiling brightly. He swung his legs where he was sitting, watching Jacob and Newt curiously.<br/>
“Not really. He's a child I rescued. Long story.”, Newt dismissed, though smiled fondly. Seraph was an Obscurial he had rescued three years ago. Since then, Seraph had learned a bit about magic, and was doing rather well health-wise with his Obscurus. He wasn't the first Obscurial Newt had met and taken care of, but the first who stayed with him for so long. The child had gotten awfully attached, as had Newt.</p><p>Newt got to work then, touching the wounds on Kowalski's neck. “That's definitely the Murtlap.”, he said and sighed, moving to gather the ingredients he needed to make the medicine for Jacob.<br/>
“Oh yeah, sorry I couldn't help keep them all in.”, Seraph spoke up again, frowning.<br/>
“It's quite alright. I can't ask you to keep them all inside by yourself.”, Newt smiled softly at the child. He didn't like having him feel responsible for something he wasn't. Seraph nodded lightly in reply, staying quiet.<br/>
“You, Mr Kowalski, must be particularly susceptible. See, you're a muggle, so our physiologies are subtly different.”, Newt explained, as he made a paste and got some pills out of a little jar. He applied the paste to the little wounds, and gave the pills together with a mug of water to Jacob to take.<br/>
“That should stop the sweating.”, Newt said and walked over to Seraph, gently lifting his chin. The child had bandages wrapped around his throat, which Newt gently pulled off. “And one of those should sort the twitch.”, he added.</p><p>“How are you doing?”, Newt asked softly, taking in the marks on Seraph's skin, before grabbing a little jar again to smear the paste inside it onto them.<br/>
“I'm good! Missed you an awful lot, though.”, Seraph replied, head leaning back as he let Newt work, glad when Newt wrapped fresh bandages around his throat again.<br/>
“I know. Couldn't risk anything taking you up with me though. You know how muggles are.”, Newt replied, laying a hand onto Seraph's head with a soft smile.<br/>
“I know. But I like it down here! And I'm glad you're back!”, Seraph smiled brightly, hugging Newt again. It made the older man laugh softly, hugging Seraph back gently.<br/>
“Alright alright. Let's feed the creatures, hm?”, Newt suggested with a smile, and Seraph nodded, letting go of Newt. He grabbed a cleaver then, preparing some chunks of meat laying on his workbench, before throwing them into a bucket. He handed one of them to Jacob, before they left the shed -Seraph following behind Newt.</p><p> </p><p> </p>
