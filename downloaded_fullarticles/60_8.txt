    <p>“Rennerverate! Bloody hell, Hermione, you better not be dead…” Hermione started with a gasp, only to wince in pain. She glanced down as her clothed side, covered in what she first thought was dirt but soon realized was blood. Her blood. She dizzily looked up to see who cast the spell, grimacing at Neville’s face through the pain. “I did what I could to stop the bleeding, but nothing worked aside from covering it, like you taught me.”</p><p>“Thanks, Neville. What have I-” Hermione was cut off by a shriek. The room began to fill with Death Eaters and Order members, spells ricocheting off walls or hitting their targets. Hermione couldn’t tell which side was winning, and quite frankly she didn’t want to know. She needed to find Harry. Giving a cursory glance of thanks and recognition to Neville, she braced herself against the pain and rushed into the flood of color, out of the alcove she had been unconscious in.</p><p>Protective charms, hastily cast “Stupefy”s, and “Expelliarmus”s flew out her mouth as she ran to the exit, dodging people and spells alike. Cursing her lower-than-normal reflexes due to her injury, she reached the door at a jog. Her mind spun with her frantic planning; how was she to not only find Harry, but find him in time? Luckily, it seemed that the Death Eaters picked the wrong door and she had a bit more moments that she expected—the door-bordered circular room was empty, and none of the other doors showed signs of distress or attack.</p><p>Quickly finishing the loose ends of her half-baked plan, she nodded to herself and set out to quickly mark each door, step in, look for trouble, and step out. <em> After all, </em> Hermione thought, <em> where there’s Harry, trouble is bound to follow. </em>After a few doors, she opened one and immediately saw Harry. For a second, she felt her heart swell, victorious, before feeling it sink, still half-grown, settling at her stomach with dread. She quickly thought back; this door opened too easily, there was distress that she didn’t realize.</p><p>She stared at the face of none other than Bellatrix Black, her heart pounding. Harry was facing off against some Death Eater that Hermione didn’t take time to recognize, because she quickly focused in on who captured Bellatrix’s attention: Sirius. Remus was there too, she noted, but was split between protecting Sirius or Harry. Making his decision for him, she ran forward, toward the woman she never thought she’d willingly touch, let alone in an act of aggression.</p><p>As she got close enough to be seen, she noted Sirius’s face pale, which Bellatrix took as fear of her, not fear for Hermione. The room was too big, too many steps to get to the Veil, where they were mid-duel, and she feared she wouldn’t make it before Sirius made a blunder. It would only be too easy in his case, hollowed by Azkaban and quick to anger, especially when Bellatrix taunted him for his forced lack of guardianship over Harry. Just as Bellatrix released a quip angering Sirius to the point of thinking with his fists instead of his much more capable wand, they collided. Rather, Hermione collided, Bellatrix kind of just… moved with the impact, a small breath taken out of her but nothing the worse for wear.</p><p>But, Hermione triumphantly saw, when she looked down there was surprise. Bellatrix grabbed the other witch’s arm, thankfully not her wand-drawing arm, and yanked her in front of her, wand pointed at her head. Had Hermione had another moment to think, she would have rolled her eyes as the drama, the parallels her new wizarding life had to cheesy villain movies where the damsel in distress was held at gunpoint. However, Hermione was not a damsel in distress, thank you very much, and she would prove it.</p><p>As Sirius argued with Bellatrix, wand-hand twitching over its lack of use, Hermione thought. The other Order members would come in any minute, if they were able, and Hermione still had use of her wand. Her plan was simply executed, but with a small chance of success; Remus and Harry were busy dealing with some extra Death Eaters that had come in while she was running, and if Sirius did something too rash before her time came she would be forced to act early.</p><p>Luck, for once, it felt, was on her side, however. Just as she was beginning to get anxious, the Order members finally arrived, as the Death Eaters came in as well. There were whispers of Voldemort’s and Dumbledore’s arrival, but Hermione didn’t have time to be surprised, she had to act.</p><p>“Sirius, go help Harry,” she yelled, earning herself a cackle from the witch holding her captive.</p><p>“Is the little traitor to the family-line not good enough to even save Potter’s measly mudblood,” Bellatrix cooed, making Sirius turn red in the face. “Has Azkaban made you so useless you have to pretend to help the child you couldn’t protect even without enemies?” Before Sirius could respond, Hermione answered for him.</p><p>“No,” she fiercely yelled, “He is better than you could ever be. But,” she quickly moved her wand into position, “I don’t need saving from a bitch like you!” At this she stepped on Bellatrix’s foot and cast a disarming spell at her wand-hand. Bellatrix shrieked, her wand sent to Hermione’s hand, who had moved away when Bellatrix gasped in pain and shock. The older witch glared darkly before taking a step forward.</p><p>“You will pay for this, you belligerent little mudblood! You’re lucky my Lord has called us back.” At this, Hermione looked around as Bellatrix apparated away. She hadn’t noticed that the remaining Death Eaters were either finishing their duels or were captured, the rest having already moved out at Voldemort’s request. She sighed, resigning herself to having to play catch-up once again as she walked to Sirius.</p><p>"I didn't know you cursed, kitten," Sirius joked. Rolling her eyes, she grinned at him, her adrenaline making her care just a little to less and act a little more cocky. Before she could respond, however, she became faint and her vision went black as Sirius yelled her name and rushed to catch her.</p><hr/><p>She groaned. Again. Wondering if rude awakenings were a bad habit she was developing or an unfortunate coincidence, she slowly opened her eyes to the absurdly too-bright room. Blinking quickly to clear away the spots forming, she quickly moaned as she felt the pressure applied to her injury increase. She looked at the aged, kind yet stern hands of Madame Pomfrey, changing her dressings and ensuring it was a snug fit. Pomfrey looked at her, a strange mix of pity and surprise crossing over her face.</p><p>“What…” Hermione cleared her throat, finding her throat dry and her voice hoarse. “What happened?” Pomfrey’s expression softened, and she glanced at the chair that Hermione realized held a shaggy black dog.</p><p>“Perhaps you should be with your… pet for a minute while I send for Harry and Ron, they requested to be notified when you wake up.” After swiftly double-checking her bandages and filling a cup on her bedside with water, she left and closed the curtains around Hermione’s bed and the chair next to it, placing a simple silencing charm for added privacy. As soon as Hermione and Sirius were enclosed in the silenced curtains, he transformed back to himself, rushing to hold Hermione’s hand with both of his.</p><p>“You’ve been out for awhile, you know,” Sirius said quietly, almost as if talking to himself rather than her.</p><p>“How long, Sirius? What happened?”</p><p>“It’s been three or four days, I lost track of time stuck here as Snuffles. You got hit by Dolohov before you came to the Veil Room, a nasty curse that probably would have killed you had he not been silenced.” He glanced at her side, wincing apologetically almost as if he were the one who raised his wand to her. “He was one of the heralds for Harry’s arrival, I guess he wanted to get a head start on the fight but forgot to take off his own spell.” She asked how bad it was, cringing a bit when he said it’d most likely scar. She listened as he talked about how scared he was that Harry would lose one of his best friends, how healing spells only made her bleed faster. She gasped when he said that Voldemort and Dumbledore faced off, when Harry had a prophecy that shattered, and how Voldemort was really after that prophecy even though he already knew most of it. No one really knew the details, and Dumbledore left almost immediately after Voldemort, only assuring that Mad-Eye and Tonks had the captured Death Eaters under control before leaving back to Hogwarts.</p><p>By the time he finished explaining what he knew and answering her questions as best he could, Harry and Ron had arrived, surprisingly accompanied by the Headmaster himself. After their greetings and teary-eyed smiles and half-hugs, Dumbledore cleared his throat, and everyone quickly silenced themselves for him to speak.</p><p>“Miss Granger, were you aware of what the Veil is capable of?” He looked directly into her eyes, although she broke eye contact near immediately after feeling him lightly prod her mind. At her quiet headshake, he continued. “The Veil is a passage between the realm of the living and the dead, had Sirius dueled Bellatrix and even touched it, he would have fallen into the world of the dead, never to return. You almost certainly saved his life.” Ignoring her gasp of shock at this, he continued. “However, aside from congratulating your heroism and wishing you a speedy recovery, after you all had returned to Hogwarts, Sirius had requested a discussion after you woke up to give you time to spend with Harry and Ron.”</p><p>At his look, Sirius got up from his seat and moved to Dumbledore, Harry quickly taking the now empty seat. When the Golden Trio was finally left alone, they quietly discussed what happened and Harry, to Hermione’s delight, brought with him the homework she had missed. They were interrupted when they heard Sirius’s voice raise, although still muffled from the now-fading silencing charm Pomfrey placed. Grabbing her wand, she quickly dispelled the charm, catching the back-end of their argument.</p><p>“I don’t care about blood protection, he clearly isn’t safe there! I will take him home as soon as he has spent a week there, we both know that should be enough time to keep him protected! He has basically lived away from them every year and you never were concerned about that,” Sirius yelled over his shoulder as he opened the curtains, ignoring Dumbledore’s attempted reply and Pomfrey’s attempt to quiet them down. He grinned apologetically at Harry, glancing at Ron and letting his gaze linger on Hermione for a second longer than expected before going back to Harry. Hermione, already knowing what was probably going to happen, began preparing a plan to make the public see Sirius’s innocence, mentally rolling her eyes at his impulsiveness. Harry, oblivious as ever, looked at him questioningly. He lost his apologetic smile, instead beaming at Harry before asking the obvious.</p><p>“So, what do you think about living with me from now on?”</p>
