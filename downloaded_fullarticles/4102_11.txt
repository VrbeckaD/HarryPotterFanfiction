  <b>Dimitri  Yakovich Romanov : Son of a Spider. </b>
</p><p>
  <span>Prologue </span>
</p><p>
  <span>No red-headed little girl was born in the Evans family. After the difficult birth of their daughter Petunia, Mr and Mrs Evans were told that Mrs Evans would not be able to have other natural children. The thing is that a couple of years later, they wanted a second child. A sibling to their little girl. So they went to the orphanage, coming back home with another child, a red-headed little girl with stunning green eyes they named Lily.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The sisters were not really close, but it worsen when strange things start happening around Lily. No one knew what was happening, but Lily secretly knew, even though she could not tell. A day, she met a dark haired boy of her age who told her that it was magic. She already knew that, but now she could tell her family.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>You see, Lily had a secret. She never was born in England and wasn't going to turn eleven soon. She actually was old enough to have been there while the World War II was happening, she had been around 19 years old, actually. She was Russian. Natalia Alianovna Romanova. The Black Widow. Well, a deaged Black Widow sent by the Red Room to find what a certain meddling Headmaster form a certain magical school was up to.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Little did she know that her whole life would change. From here, everyone knows Lily Evans-Potter's story, but there's some differences. Not being able to carry children and pretending it was due to an accident when she was young in the muggle world, Lily and James Potter had to find a surrogate mother. Long black hair like James, stunning green eyes like Lily. Pale skin too. They never said any name, just codename. Prongs. The Spider. And Silvertongue. No one heard about Silvertongue after little Harry James Potter was born. No one ever knew the truth. Just like no one ever knew that Lily Evans was an adopted child.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>This was why, when the dreadful day came, when that prophecy was made, people thought that the Potters were one of them. Well, at least it save Neville Longbottom from being the "Boy-Who-Lived". </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>But a few hours after Albus Dumbledore left baby Harry on his "aunt and uncle's" doorstep, and seriously, that was the second big mistake he made concerning Harry.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The first one was to not send him in a magical family where he would gain more preparation for "his fate". Honestly, who would leave a baby in a basket on a doorstep in the middle of the night, in NOVEMBER?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>This is where the story you know changes. Right after Dumbledore, McGonagall and Hagrid left. And as no one checked on the baby, it would take ten years for them to know what truly happened that night. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry James Potter was no more. He will never be the Gryffindor house’s Golden Boy. </span>
</p><p><br/>
<span>What will be the life of Dimitri Harrison Yakovich Romanov, son of the infamous Black Widow Natalia Alianovna Romanova? Well… It's up to you to discover that. </span>
