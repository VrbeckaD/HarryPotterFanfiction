    <p>Aziraphale watches as rain sloughs down the bookshop windows. He waits for Crowley in silence and warmth, feeling quite safe within the paper and leather embrace of his bookstore. It had been raining for rather more than two days now, with only brisk pauses to space between the lot of it and let the city breathe. Aziraphale didn’t mind the rain — it made for a wonderful reading atmosphere — but the mud beneath his shoes became a bit tedious as walks with Crowley became more common. Still, he knew that anyone around Crowley could practically smell his love for rain. Aziraphale often wondered if The Almighty had put him in charge of that very first rain, 6000 years ago and before he’d fallen. He did seem quite fond of the stuff. As if summoned by the Angel’s thoughts, a speeding black Bentley approaches the store in an obviously illegal soeed, and he shakes his head with a smile. </p><p>“Speak of the demon,” he mutters, directing it to no one in particular and clasping his hands together before he walks to the front of the store to pull his door open. A swaggering, sultry Crowley wrenches himself up and out of his car. He ends up practically launching himself drunkenly towards the shop, and his legs twist in a dizzying ballet of broken steps. His eyes twinkle with yellow, his cheeks flush with red, and his fangs poke out a bit more than usual under a full toothed grin. </p><p>“Angel!” Crowley throws the door — then his arms — wide open, lips bursting with a smile and the lines of a smirk against his cheeks. He saunters about and hugs Aziraphale with the fervent excitement of a man who’d not seen their friend in over a millennium. Aziraphale finally recognizes the pink tint of his cheeks and stifles a laugh. The half-drunk bottle of wine they’d been supposed to share doesn’t go unnoticed either. “How are you?”</p><p>Aziraphale pulls himself from the hug, untangling himself. Crowley frowns a little, before grinning again just as rapidly and taking another drink. </p><p>(Most would say that the Devil was able to handle his liquor like a man who’d been an alcoholic since he was born. Crowley was <em> not </em>the devil.)</p><p> His alcohol tolerance was high above those of any human, but Aziraphale loved to tease the demon on the fact that an angel of heaven could hold his alcohol better than a demon of hell. “Dear boy, that was meant to be <em>shared,” </em> he chastises disapprovingly, with a pointed glance at the bottle still gripped in Crowley’s hands. He does not pout. Not in the slightest, because Angels could not <em>dance </em>or <em>pout. </em> “Miracles can’t help everything!”</p><p>“Miraclesss?” Crowley laughs — a small, hissing thing, matching the snake’s slur of his words — and throws himself against the couch nearby. “Miracles, Angel, can do a bloody <em> lot!” </em> He takes another swig before having his lifeline yanked unceremoniously from his hands. He leans towards the bottle annoyedly, before a cup full of red is placed back between his fingers in almost no time after it’s gone. Aziraphale pours a glass of his own and sits, a hand fluttering nervously to Crowley’s knee, which bounces like anything. </p><p>Crowley drinks from his new glass fervently. He still has one arm raised, as if looking for a high-five, and he seems to realize right as the wine starts to tip out of his glass. He quickly replaces his position with a new one — his previously occupied arm slung gently over Aziraphale’s shoulders. “Y’ find ‘sss not hard to make a-“ the wine glass refills a little, and he shivers as he goes only a bit soberer. “Few <em> miracles.” </em></p><p>“I know, love,” Aziraphale says, sipping wine of his own and settling into the cozy warmth of Crowley’s embrace. They drift, lazily drinking and only talking when the talk was required — which it often wasn’t. The silence is a comfortable one. It was the type one lapses into when in the presence of someone they trusted with more than their life — and Aziraphale and Crowley both trusted each other with a great deal more than such trivial things as their corporations. So, the silence in a comfortable one.</p><p>Until that is, it is not.</p><p>A tiny tinkling of a bell inserts itself between the quiet and giggles. Aziraphale frowns at its bold amusement. “I’d locked that,” he says to himself, before sliding away from Crowley's grip with a reassuring smile and a promise to be back. “I’ll just check up on that.”</p><p>“Alright, Angel,” Crowley says softly. He trails a finger over the stained edge of his cup and thinks.</p><p>---</p><p>Aziraphale had had his fair share of weird entrances. Still, his shop has never been broken in to. Not even the mafia, or any type of organized crime syndicate, or the cops had managed that. His customers tended to enjoy entering an unlocked door and then eventually leaving, bookless, through the same door and with either a disposable cup of tea or a slew of curses at their lips. Sometimes, he’d had people looking to fight with him, verbally or physically. Sometimes, he’d have tourists. On one, very drunk occasion, he’d had a demon dressed in drag. But, usually, the people coming through his door are simply <em>customers. </em></p><p>---</p><p>The person at the door is <em>not </em>a customer.</p><p>They are a tall, bulking person, a mass that takes up Aziraphale’s entire doorway and fiddles with what seems to be a bright pink crocheted scarf around their neck. A great brown fluff of hair sits against their head and flies about in a jerking pool of curls when he twists to meet Aziraphale. They find themself having to look down upon the Angel, but a huge smile bursts onto their face regardless.</p><p>“‘Ello!” They grin even wider and wave.</p><p>“Er- hello?” Aziraphale’s waves back and smiles awkwardly. This man had come into his locked shop, and he didn’t feel like extending all of his open kindness right then. He promptly begins to anxiously wring his gloved hands. “What’s… your name?”</p><p>“Rubeus Hagrid, at yer service.” The name isn’t familiar. Aziraphale blinks at him, but the man is already continuing. “Keeper of keys and grounds at Hogwarts school for Witchcraft and Wizardry!” </p><p>Aziraphale blinks again.</p><p>Hagrid blinks back, though he might not have realized he’d done it. Blinks like this were very important, but it seems Hagrid was not fully in the know.</p><p>“H- Hogwarts?” Aziraphale raises an eyebrow. He wasn’t intimidated, but he was bloody confused at the very least, and it has him wanting to step back, and away, and delve deep into his books in the hope that he remembers which Wizarding school Hogwarts was. It’s almost familiar, and a name -- an old friend, perhaps, one who had attended -- stands at the edge of his tongue. “I- I know of wizards and such, but… which school is-“</p><p>“A-“ Crowley appears from behind and heaves a hiccup. He throws an arm around Aziraphale’s shoulder, shuddering as alcohol leaves his system and refills his bottle. “Ngk- a..” He pauses to tuck his now-corked bottle under his armpit and put up air quotes. “A ‘Hogwarts,’ is the biggest bloody wizarding school out there, Angel. ‘S in Scotland. I always did like Scotland...” He trails off.</p><p>“I’m surprised y’ haven’t heard of it.” Hagrid looks put off at the revelation, but he stays quiet in his confusion. He clears his throat and continues happily. “But yes, Hogwarts! Dumbledore ‘imself has-“</p><p>“Dumbledore?” It’s Crowley’s turn to be confused. He raises an eyebrow and mouths the name again as if it was a wad of half-chewed and offensive gum. “Dumbledore.”</p><p>“The-” Hagrid pauses and raises a bushy eyebrow. At the realization that they really don’t know who that man is, he reels back. “You don’t know <em> Dumbledore? </em> Dumbledore, as in the most powerful Wizar’ alive?” His eyebrows fly up even higher when Aziraphale and Crowley share twin glances of confusion, and Aziraphale begins to wonder if they might fly off his head. Wizards were funny like that. You’d never know where their eyebrows might be going. “How d’you not know <em> Albus Dumbledore?” </em></p><p>“I’m so sorry about our confusion.” Aziraphale gestures behind him to his backroom, not populated with chairs and a sofa, and Crowley untangles himself from over his shoulder. “Will you come and sit down, please?”</p><p>Hagrid nods and follows behind the two. He watches as Crowley swaggers back and forth and Aziraphale walks quietly next to him. </p><p>He settles on Aziraphale’s couch when prompted too, and only winces a little when it sinks under his weight. The two others sit themselves down into matching armchairs in front of Hagrid. The redhead stares at him through black glasses, and Hagrid begins to have a strange sense that the man is looking into his soul. He squirms nervously and tugs at a string on his scarf, cursing to himself when it nearly snaps. </p><p>“Er- anyways-“ he clears his throat. “Albus sent me, an’ he wanted me t’ ask if you had any interest in becomin’ professors at ‘Hogwarts.” The scarf is beginning to come undone. Crowley -- he’s almost certain that one is Crowley -- continues to glower. Aziraphale puts a hand on his shoulder and the man’s aura recedes, if only a bit. “I assumed ye’d both know who he was since y’ stopped the apocalypse an’ all.” </p><p>They <em>all </em>blink.</p><p>“Wh- how the bloody hell do you know about that?” Crowley leans forward and his legs go pitching into the coffee table in front of him just as his voice pitches, both sending a resounding cracking noise through the room. He hisses — <em> really </em>hisses -- like a snake. “That’s supposed to be- erg-“</p><p>He cuts off when Azirpahale’s hand drops against his knee for the second time. The bouncing limb drops, but Crowley’s grimace does not, even if he doesn’t seem to mind Aziraphale’s touch.</p><p>“I may‘no be a genius,” Hagrid grumbles, “But I know a thing er’ two. I know about you two’s feat. The <em> Wizarding world </em>knows, Mr. Crowley, and Mr. Fell.” His eyes twinkle with a sharp amusement at the two’s gaping mouths. </p><p>(The brown surrounding his pupils turns a gentle orange in the glowing lamplight. Rain continues to batter the area outside. A pink umbrella in Hagrid’s hand turns suddenly dry. Crowley leans backward again, and the tension diffuses a little.)</p><p>“We don’ mean anything hostile by all of this. Dumbledore only wan’ed to offer, y’know?” Rubeus shakes his umbrella, checking for water, and accepts a cup of tea from Aziraphale. He takes a drink, then blinks back surprise when he realizes it’d been conjured out of thin air. Not even a spell. “How did y-”</p><p>“We’ll do it,” Crowley says, abruptly, staring at Aziraphale with an open expression. His fingers drift lazily over the edges of his sunglasses.  Aziraphale stares back -- then breaks the spell of silence by glancing away and shooting Hagrid an almost-apologetic look. </p><p>“Y- Y’ don’t even know what positions yet, though! Yer gonna have to hear m’ out first.” Hagrid pulls out one, no -- two -- notecards from a jacket pocket. Upon closer look, and them being handed to him, Azirphale realizes that they’re freshly sealed letters instead. His address is as plain as anything on the front of it, and a quick glance to Crowley’s letter shows him the same. A bright red wax seal rubs against Aziraphale’s perfectly manicured hands. Hagrid looks at Aziraphale first. “Mr. Azira Fell. Albus Dumbledore formally proposes that y’join Hogwarts’ staff as our official librarian.” Before Aziraphale can blink and express his excitement, Hagrid twists to meet Crowley’s unnervingly solid gaze.</p><p>“Mr. Anthony J. Crowley. Albus Dumbledore formally proposes that y’join Hogwarts’ staff as our official Herbologist.”</p><p>Well, neither of them dislike the offer. There isn’t much else to do.</p><p>---</p><p>“Well, he was certainly… someone.” Crowley sniffs and downs the final dredges of his wine. “Y’think he was a…”</p><p>“A giant?” Aziraphale nods and smiles. “Half, perhaps. I’d thought they’d all been killed..” His eyes dip to the ground as he mutters something about <em> Gabriel </em>and <em>xenophobia. </em> “But <em> I </em> think we should address the elephant in the room.”</p><p>“Elephant?” Crowley frowns, tipping his glass back to look for something that’s not there, and groaning when he realizes the red is only staining his throat, not the cup. “Was it an elephant in that one?”</p><p>“Yes, dear.” He waves a dismissive hand and sets his empty wineglass against a coaster on the table. “The elephant, being that <em>we </em>are not <em>wizards, </em> love. We may not be muggles, but we can’t start going around and saying-”</p><p>“Oh, ‘ello there, we’re just... “ Crowley gesticulates randomly with his empty hand. “A bloody demon and a blessed angel. How can we help you?” Another drink, and a small smile, and a villainous bow. The crinkles around his mouth are enough to have Aziraphale smiling as well. “Want a- a- <em> a </em> duck or something?” </p><p>“Crowley,” Aziraphale pleads through a laugh, “You aren’t helping!”</p><p>The demon groans in faux annoyance. “Fine, fine, but if I’m sober, you’re sober too!” For the third time that night, his wine bottle is refilled, and he begins to look a rather nasty shade of pale green. “Shit,” he snarls at the discomfort, and he saunters back and forth to drop his bottle unceremoniously onto the table. Aziraphale doesn’t miss the coaster he miracles in the way of the wood first. He almost calls Crowley out on it, then decides he’s content to just smile a few feet away. “Your turn, angel.”</p><p>Aziraphale squints as he feels a rush of liquor and heavy drunkenness drift out of his system, leaving him a similarly sickening shade of “No thank you, that seems a bit more than I’d ordered.” His grimace drops, and only returns when he realizes its starting to grow rather cold in the room. He almost changes the temperature, till he feels his shoulders being stolen away by a massive hug from Crowley. Well — it’s not much of a hug — truly, because Crowley didn’t really <em>hug. </em>He lounges behind Aziraphale with his arms over the angle’s shoulders. Aziraphale can’t find it in him to complain, and he takes Crowley’s long-nailed fingers in his hands, facing the wall and thinking. </p><p>“Dear, we probably should go find out where in this world we become wizards, shouldn’t we?” He smiles beside himself.</p><p>“Nfk. it can wait.”</p><p>And to that - Aziraphale can’t really disagree.</p><p>---</p><p>Rubeus -- He’d told Aziraphale and Crowley both that first names were fine -- had left them a day ago and with a sealed envelope each. They both had their address printed in perfect cursive script. It had a long, descriptive list for both of them, detailing instructions on how to arrive, (by train) where they would live, (in a town nearby, or their own homes, if they were willing to “apparate” off of school grounds) what they needed, (lots) and prospective lesson plans. </p><p>They make their way to a shabby and almost entirely hidden tavern by the name of “The Leaky Cauldron” on some foreign side street, as if it was intentionally shoved out of the way. It’s damp, and swirls with dusty darkness, smelling a little of mold, yet neither of them smell any occult or ethereal beings besides themselves. A man at the counter smiles at them as he rubs at an already clean glass, and so the two cross over. </p><p>“Hello.” He sets the glass down and nods to both of them as they slide into barstools. “Can I get you anything?”</p><p>“A scotch.” </p><p>“Nothing, please.”</p><p>He gestures his assent at Crowley, then at Aziraphale, and slides a cup across the table after a moment of pouring it. Crowley lets it swirl and flash about his cup before he downs it in one fell swoop, finding it pleasantly warm and delicious.</p><p>All in a hurry, the room begins to grow cramped, and louder. Crowley has seen many bars in all of his existence, and he’s surprised to find one like this so suddenly packed with people. When he swivels around he hears hushed gasps, outright exclamations, and many new people drawing near to the center and abandoning drinks and tables. In the center stands a dark black head of hair, thrown upwards and just above a bespectacled face. They’ve got a confused, slightly scared expression under their broken glasses, and their eyes seem to catch the floor and walls more than anything. Rubeus stands not far away, and both Crowley and Aziraphale stand in surprise. The man waves to them and smiles with enough kindness to kill a man. Or, more aptly, raise the dead.</p><p>“Harry Potter,” he mouths. In a sudden instance, Azirapphale sucks in a sharp breath, eyes widening. Crowley looks over in concern.</p><p>“Angel?” </p><p>“I-“ Azirpahale’s voice shakes with something like awe, and Crowley sets his hand in the angel’s shoulder, some irrational worry rising in his throat. “It was Lily and James Potter. That’s his child.” Aziraphale smiles, bittersweet. “I was their <em> friend.” </em></p><p>“You-“ Crowley frowns. “His parents?” He asks, pointing to the child stumbling about in the middle of the crowd.</p><p>“I was one of their friends. They were killed — their son lived.” He walks forward and brushes Crowley’s arm off. The demon follows, still a little surprised. Aziraphale always was the one who made too many friends, Crowley reasons. The crowd has begun to be pushed away with Rubeus’s help, leaving a green-eyed, underdressed, short child with a curious face. He had light brown skin that seemed to stretch too tightly over his bones, and he was tall for his age. He also has a bright scar in the form of a lightning bolt splitting his forehead and cutting through his brow.</p><p>“Harry <em> Potter.” </em>He walks up to the boy once everyone else has begun to leave. “Do you remember me?”</p><p>“I-“ Harry frowns, still looking shaken. His curls bounce over his eyes and he shoves them upwards with a hand. “I don’t think so. I don’t remember much of anyone. I’ve only just figured out I’m a <em> wizard.” </em></p><p>“His “family” didn’t tell him anything,” Rubeus spits from behind the boy as if “family” was a curse more than anything. Crowley and Aziraphale can relate much more than the man knows. Heaven and Hell were not hospitable. “Harry Potter, meet Mr. Fell and Mr. Crowley — soon t’ be the librarian and herbologist of ‘Ogwarts!”</p><p>“I’m sorry I don’t remember you, Mr. Fell.” Harry pauses, then taps a finger to his side anxiously. “Professor. Sorry.”</p><p>“My dear boy, it is <em> perfectly </em>alright.”Aziraphale sighs, a little shaken. Crowley stands back and continues to watch the proceedings. There’s something… off, about the boy. He’s not quite sure what, and he searches through the hatred he can find in the air, tugging on a line near the boy's form and searching</p><p>
  <em> Pulsing hate stuck deep under the scar, and bright green light, and there’s so much anger- </em>
</p><p>He hisses and grips his forehead. Whatever it was, it doesn’t like being disturbed. It’s not the boy, either. It’s something within him, but Crowley has never met a single child with the capabilities to hate that much.</p><p>“Dear?” Aziraphale twists around and frowns, eyebrows drawing together in worry while Crowley drops his hand and the boy watches with those eerily inquisitive eyes. “Are you alright?”</p><p>“Fine, fine, angel. I’m fine. Just a-“ he breathes a deep breath. “Headache.” Aziraphale nods</p><p>“Did you know em?”  Rubeus asks, quieted some.</p><p>“I knew them well. I met them…” Aziraphale shakes his head. “It doesn’t matter. <em> That’s </em>why Hogwarts sounded familiar to me.” </p><p>“You knew my parents?” Harry wonders, looking up to Aziraphale with a strangely anxious expression. He seems afraid to ask the question. </p><p>“Yes. They were… some of my closest friends. They were <em> wonderful, </em>and dear Sirius and I did look for you when they d-“</p><p>“Sirius?”</p><p>“Your godfather, dear.” Aziraphale makes to continue before he realizes that Rubeus is going a very odd shade of white. “Is something the matter?”</p><p>“Sirius?” Rubeus stutters on his words and starts to looks like he’s going to stumble into hell as fast as Crowley can say <em>wahoo. </em>“I-  we need to get goin’”</p><p>Crowley points to the backdoor. “Why don’t we come on with?”</p><p>---</p><p>Overall, Crowley finds his opinion of this Dumbledore fellow has already taken a massive hit.</p><p>His perception of Rubeus and Harry? They’ve only grown even better. </p><p>Harry is quiet. He’s quiet, and he’s smart, and he clearly hasn’t had a good childhood. He flinches away from Rubeus’s large armed movements, he’s timid when asking questions, and he seems to shrink under Aziraphale’s overbearing fondness. Crowley walks next to the boy and stays, for the most part, silent. </p><p>The streets are bright and packed full with all matter of people and beats. A pet store displays bats and hooting owls. A store with a firey red broomstick displayed in its window has children pressed to the glass. Plants, animals, wares, books, everything is strewn about in a messy array of life. After Harry and Rubeus visit an imposing building called “Gringgotts” populated with busy house-elves weighing and doling out money, they start at a massive shop -- dark, as many of the ones on the lane were -- and draped with the telltale signs of a seamstress. A woman bustles towards them with her arms draped lavishly in silken robes, confirming Crowley’s suspicions. </p><p>Hagrid walks off once Harry is settled. He asks what Crowley and Aziraphale like with ice cream, but they politely decline his offer. That leaves the two to watch as the boy indoors is fitted for long black robes. </p><p>“Well.” Crowley has the sudden urge to laugh, as the angel and demon are left alone in awkward silence and he’s suddenly reminded of the Garden. “That went down like something kind of like a-”</p><p>“Don’t,” Aziraphale warns, looking away to stare inside. “You feel it too, don’t you?”</p><p>Crowley nods. No further explanation is required. Aziraphale doesn’t have to be able to sense hate to know that something very wrong has gone on in the child’s life.</p><p>“Well,” Crowley begins, starting to feel a little uncomfortable. He can deal with “awkward.” He’s good at that. He can’t deal with <em>silent </em>awkwardness, especially around Aziraphale, who really did adore chatting when he wasn’t enamored with a book. Aziraphale shifts in the sun. “Should we go in? Get some robes of our own?”</p><p>Aziraphale nods, and so they walk in together, speaking to the woman -- Madam Malkin -- for a moment, till she leads them over to a waiting area. After owning their corporations for thousands of years, both Aziraphale and Crowley had gotten their measurements down perfectly, which she seemed to appreciate if her bright eyes and giddy smile were any indications. Aziraphale and Crowley start to chat, as people -- even Demons and Angels -- often did when there wasn’t much to talk about. Crowley watches Harry out of the corner of his eyes, half-listening to Aziraphale, and half-listening to an oily little blond boy with an upturned nose. </p><p>"I say, look at that man!" The blonde tilts his head toward the front window, where Hagrid has just stepped back into view. He’s grinning happily, holding two ice cream cones to show that he was currently unable to come in.</p><p>"That's Hagrid," Harry replies. Aziraphale has begun to listen as well. "He works at Hogwarts. "</p><p>"Oh, I've heard of him. He's a sort of servant, isn't he?"</p><p>Crowley has started to find that he’s found another child he doesn’t like. He did really enjoy children, even if he’d not admit it in 6000 years. This one, he was finding, was one of the ones he didn’t enjoy. Harry -- on the other hand -- already had the potential to be like Warlock or Adam to Crowley.</p><p>"He's the gamekeeper," Harry says, disdain just as obvious in his voice as it is on his face.</p><p>"Yes, exactly. I heard he's a sort of savage -- lives in a hut on the school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic, and ends up setting fire to his bed. "</p><p>"I think he's brilliant.”</p><p> It’s the first time Crowley’s heard the boy speak unkindly to anyone. He’s starting to feel proud.</p><p>"Do you?" Blonde sneers. "Why is he with you? Where are your parents?"</p><p>"They're dead," Harry replies shortly, and both Aziraphale and Crowleys seemed to simultaneously find this as their cue to intervene.</p><p>“Hello, Harry.” Crowley sniffs and finishes walking towards the two. “Almost finished?”</p><p>The robes miraculously find themselves almost finished.</p><p>“I.” Harry looks around at his robes and nods. “I think so?”</p><p>“Who’re they?” Blondie sneers. It seems to be his default expression. Crowley sneers harder. “<em> Muggles?” </em></p><p>“No.” Harry tilts his head. “What’s wrong with muggles?”</p><p>“Well, they shouldn’t really be aloud around here should they?” The boy looks at the mirror before him, and Crowley realizes with an agonizingly silent sigh that <em>damn it, this kid’s family fucking sucks as much as Harry’s. In different ways of course, but fuck. </em> He decides smiting him sounds like a bad idea no matter how irritating he seems. That doesn’t mean he can’t be rightfully pissed. “Them <em> or </em>half-bloods.”</p><p>“You’re all done, dearies.” Madam Malkin returns with Crowley and Aziraphale’s robes, which they won’t end up wearing much anyways, and ends any further conversation. They all take their fresh clothes and walk from the shop in silence.</p><p>Harry eats his ice cream with a thoughtful face and talks about Quidditch with Rubeus. Crowley files away the fact that he probably will need to use a broomstick if he wants to fly amongst these wizards. It’s for the best, really. He didn’t like using them much.</p><p>
  <em> Blood, and angry shouts. He presses his hands to someone’s golden stained side. There’s a war on. </em>
</p><p>He shakes the memory from his mind and continues walking, only finally chiming in when they begin to discuss Voldemort.</p><p>“Say his name,” he grumbles at the name you-know-who, shoving his hand into his pockets. “Say it, ‘cause otherwise you’re just giving him more power. Don’t let ‘im scare you, Harry.” He looks away. “All men are fleeting. Even wizards.”</p><p>---</p><p>They split paths when Rubeus takes Harry to a luncheon down the road, right after the boy’s wand has finished exploding golden light within a twisted and mazelike shop that smells like shoe polish and pine trees. Crowley and Aziraphale enter the wand shop just as the other two walk out. It’s small, but an endless amount of corridors flow from the front desk. Wands and wand boxes are scattered about, creating a comfortable mess. Their footsteps resound around the room as they tap forward on the checkerboard tiles, falling still at the edge of the room. They meet a man with catlike green eyes that shine as if he’d just sold someone a noose and he’s beginning to regret it. Crowley bristles at the look.</p><p>“You must be it, then.” </p><p>He says it with all the finality of a man walking to their grave. Or -- in Crowley and Aziraphale’s perspectives -- a tornado of hellfire and a bathtub of holy water respectively. </p><p>Aziraphale chuckles nervously. “I’m sorry, have we met?”</p><p>Ollivander shakes his head and turns away from them. “No, but I know who you are. You’re not wizards-” He disturbs the piles of wand boxes on the counter to pull two, completely identical cases free. “But you’re not muggles either.”</p><p>He looks at Aziraphale. Licks his lips, dodges his gaze, then looks away with a tripped smile. “Cedar, with a Phoenix core.” He pulls a wand from the box on top of his pile. “12 inches. Inflexible.” He hands it to Aziraphale. It’s a light color, and of simple construction, with roughly carved feathers twisting around the base of the wand. The Angel takes it, hesitant. It takes only a moment for the light to begin swarming about the room -- light yellows like an evening sun, old parchment, and a good cup of tea.</p><p>Now, he turns to Crowley, looking contemplative. “Hawthorn, with a phoenix core.” He takes from the last box now, hands shaking with age. “14 inches. Inflexible.” This one is handed to Crowley. It’s identical to Aziraphale’s in its carving -- the same rough, half whittled edges  -- but the feathers aren’t there. Instead, a snake curls around the edges of the bottom. A dark, ruby light flys from the wand -- winter sunsets, velvet, rippling snake scale. It subsides.</p><p>---</p><p>Harry has an owl. Harry has a snowy white owl, with pretty blue eyes and several black flecks in her wings. Harry has an owl, and he seems exceptionally overjoyed by that. Aziraphale almost pulls his wings out at the same time. He takes pride in seeing his creations. It even hoots at him a few times, and he nods in agreeance at its excited words.</p><p>(Raphael had always been the builder. He’d taught Aziraphale once, a silly rebellion. Aziraphale had only completed one project. He’d been creating one day -- an owl -- the first, with light brown feathers -- when the Falling had begun.)</p><p>He shakes the memories away and walks back into the tavern with everyone else.</p><p>---</p><p>Platform 2/8’s halves or something. Rubeus had dropped the boy onto a train and left. Harry had started to stare hollowly the moment he lost sight of them all, and so, by some mysterious miracle, Crowley and Aziraphale found themselves on the back of a train, feeling a little guilty for having abandoned him originally. They really were going native and starting to like this child more and more was a part of that.</p><p>“Hello again, Harry.” Aziraphale walks to his side and points to the seat across from him. “Can we sit?”</p><p>The boy’s great big green eyes light up with confusion but he nods silently. Aziraphale lets Crowley drop into the window seat, and then he slides in beside him.</p><p>Crowley snaps his fingers, and the Bentley appears in a parking lot at Harry’s stop without a driver. The train hums, bangs with a movement that swallows up their own, wheels driving forward smoothly. Harry pushes his glasses up, as they’d begun to slide down his nose. Crowley notices the tape keeping them together+, and with a curious snap of his fingers, the tape disappears and the two halves fuse together. Crowley thinks nothing of it, then starts cursing himself internally when he remembers he’s supposed to be using his wand. It was a pretty wand, too. </p><p>Harry pulls his glasses off, an awestruck expression on his face. “You…” He looks at Crowley, squinting a little then pressing his glasses back on. “You fixed them.”</p><p>It’s not a question, but Crowley nods in confirmation anyways.</p><p> “How’d you do it? Without a wand, I mean.”</p><p>Noticing Crowley’s panic, Aziraphale begins. “ It’s simple wandless magic.” He plucks his own wand from his pocket. It looks dead, and unlively, in that train car. Useless. “We don’t really need this much.”</p><p>“That’s amazing,” he admits, eyes wide. He’d yet to see any magic beyond Hagrid’s umbrella magic -- which wasn’t bad, he still adored Hagrid -- but he’d not even seen regular wand magic and now he’s seen <em>this? </em></p><p><em> “ </em> Er- Harry?” Harry turns back to Aziraphale. “Can I ask <em> why </em>they were broken?” Aziraphale taps his fingers against his wand. “Could your guardians not have gotten you new ones?”</p><p>Harry flinches. </p><p>Crowley frowns, but ignores it, while Aziraphale just smiles encouragingly. Ignoring his worry. </p><p>“My.. My cousin, Dudley. He dropped them.”</p><p>“Dropped them hard enough for them to ssnap?”</p><p>“He. He uhm- was just playing. And he stepped on them after he dropped them. Then threw them at a wall.”</p><p>“He <em> what?’ </em>  Aziraphale can’t hide his horror, but luckily, Harry doesn’t seem to take it as an attack to himself. “My dear child, why didn’t anyone <em> help </em>you?”</p><p>Harry shrugs. “It’s happened plenty of times already. I talked to a snake and got Dudley stuck in a zoo enclosure, and so they didn’t want to fix them.”</p><p>“You-” Crowley laughs, this time in sheer disbelief. His voice twists, warping to a hissing, stretched, singular syllable. It slides like water off his tongue and into Harry’s ears, but Aziraphale hasn’t a clue what they’re saying. He can guess -- he watches Crowley’s forked tongue hit his teeth and enunciate the rolling speech. “<em> It’s called parseltongue -- that’s talking to snakes, Harry.” </em></p><p><em> “You can do it too?” </em> The boy leans to the edge of his seat, suddenly eager to talk. <em> “Can Professor Fell do it?” </em></p><p><em> “Professor Fell can do a lot of things. He can talk to owls if you’re interested. But nope.” </em> He pops the P the best he can in parseltongue. <em> “None of this.” </em></p><p>“Owls?” Harry says, in English, attracting Aziraphale’s attention. He looks over to the man excitedly. “Can you talk to <em> her?” </em>He looks lovingly at the snowy white owl watching them in the other seat.</p><p>“Of course, I can ask whatever you like when she’s woken.”</p><p>Harry smiles.</p><p>---</p><p>They walk down the street to one <em> 4 Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey. </em> It’s a tall house, white, and utterly boring. There’s no personal flair beyond a fog of general annoyance shifting like a stormcloud around it. That -- and the fact that it is surrounded by torn trees, bushes, owls feathers, and letters. The Dursley’s car is still being unloaded when Crowley and Aziraphale walk up to them, Harry sandwiched protectively between them. They can both feel the bones of his shoulders digging into their sides. </p><p>“Hello, Mr. Dursley,” Aziraphale says with all of the sweetness of an owl about to dive. “Mrs. Dursley.” He smiles at them, and thanks Shakespeare for acting classes. “Mrs. Dursley. I, am Professor Fell. I will be teaching your nephew this coming year!” He extends a hand to be shaken. It is not shaken. He slides it back under Harry’s parcels, which he had been carrying.</p><p>The two are an odd couple. Vernon Dursley is wide, and short, with an unruly mop of sweaty hair so dark it almost matches the red shade of his face. He looks like a pug or a cat whose face had gotten into a fistfight with a wall. Waves of unpleasantness rolled off of him like sweat. He did not use deodorant.</p><p>Petunia Dursley was the opposite. She was tall, and her neck craned outwards -- perfect for gossiping and shrewd glares -- and she had a very birdlike face. She looks like she had tried to kiss Vernon with a bird’s beak, and accidentally turned him a plum color. The same unpleasantness as her husband mingled with her own and shuddered, turning into something worse. She looked nothing like Harry.</p><p>“An’ ‘m Mr. Crowley. I’ll be teaching him too” Crowley does not extend a hand. In fact, following God’s petty nature, he curls his panted black fingernails further into the ridges of a box he’d been carrying. Mr. Dursley turns a much darker shade of frothing purple. Aziraphale doesn’t even have the slightest urge to correct Crowley’s etiquette. </p><p><em> “You won’t be teaching him anything,” </em> Mr. Dursley roars, a great, belching noise like that of an ugly frog<em>. </em> He hurls curses between his words. His fists ball up and clench, unclench, at his sides. <em> “You wankers won’t teach him fucking MAGIC!” </em></p><p>The one-sided shouting match ends with a resounding smack.</p><p>(Harry had just been <em> too close </em>to the ugly, gigantic fists of Vernon Dursley. They bounced off his face like nothing, and he slammed to the concrete driveway with purple as bright as Dursley’s face blooming on his cheek. His head makes a loud noise as it slams against the ground and flies back up, starting to bleed. He sits on the ground, in shocked silence.)</p><p>
  <em> Gold, slipping between his fingers and digging into the cracks of their hands. Angel blood was the brightest of any shimmering gold, and it was a perfect mirror image against all ethereal being's hands. Angels and Demons alike had the gold running through their veins. It broke against their skin and painted them.</em>
</p><p>
  <em> (Harry was red.) </em>
</p><p>Aziraphale, ever the pacifist, brings an arm out from under his packages and slaps the man with the fury of an angel. Dursley reels back, clutching his now-broken cheekbone and gaping in surprise. </p><p>Crowley, ever the fighter, drops to his knees and grabs Harry gentle by the shoulders, already checking the damage. The owl screams.</p><p>“If you ever touch a child in such a way as that again,” Crowley mutters, voice twisted with a wave of simple, lethal anger. Venom heaves in his gut. “I will <em> kill </em>you.”</p><p>And, just to prove it, he rips his glasses off and stares right into, and past, the Dursley’s. Yellow and orange burns at them n his unyielding stare, and he smiles.</p><p>(Lucifer made deals. Crowley made <em> promises.) </em></p><p>---</p><p>“Do you have anything you need inside?”</p><p>Crowley whispers, making sure not to aggravate the sure-to-be-a-monster headache Harry is about to have. Harry can’t seem to get his lips to unstick and respond, so he just shakes his head, glasses smashed against the pavement not far away. Aziraphale sits next to Crowley and conceals an inordinate amount of anger. Harry just watches them. “Good. can you walk?”</p><p>Harry accepts a hand from Aziraphale and stands, walking next to Aziraphale as the Angel wrings his hands. While Crowley lugs packages four at a time into the car, Harry slumps into the seat, still shocked. </p><p>The Dursley’s have long since disappeared. They’d abandoned their nephew and orchestrated a chorus of horrified screams as they burrowed into their home.</p><p>Once the packages have been safely tucked into the trunk of the Bentley, Crowley staggers towards Harry’s seat, crouching down on the packed concrete earth with the balls of his heels and staring.</p><p>“Lean forward, would ya?” </p><p>Harry obeys, and Crowley slides a hand onto the back of his head. Aziraphale keeps watch behind them. Crowley’s hand begins to hover above the wound, and Harry shudders against a feeling of pleasantly warm water pouring down his scalp. Crowley pulls away and then cups the boy’s cheek with the same hand, a slender thumb touching the edge of Harry’s nose, and his palm falling gently against the purpling bruise. He shuts his eyes in concentration, then pulls away right as it finishes healing, hissing a little and shaking his hand back and forth.</p><p>“I’m sorry.”</p><p>It’s the first thing Harry says. He’s afraid to say it -- even though Crowley and Aziraphale were nice, they were still new to him -- and so he finds himself scared of something without even knowing what it is. It frustrates him to no end, so all he can vocalize is that “oh, I<em> am </em> sorry.” He doesn’t sound choked, or pained, or like much of anything at all. It’s a sullen, emotionless whisper of an apology.</p><p>“Ssstop that.” Crowley squeezes a hand gently onto his shoulder and stands. “Don’t apologissse for shitty people.”</p><p>“Language, dear.” Aziraphale turns to Harry before Crowley can be offended. “You haven’t done anything wrong in the slightest. You, in fact, must be stubbornly brave, aren’t you?” He sighs in the tone of an anxious Angel.</p><p>“I don’t think I’m very brave at all.”</p><p>“Then you’re being foolish,” Crowley states simply, before standing and closing Harry’s door, climbing into his seat and continuing the discussion as Aziraphale gets settled. “You’ve lived with them for years, and you’re still here. You’re brave.”</p><p>---</p><p>The bookshop isn’t cold or unwelcoming, per se, but it’s receiving a right lot of shivering new occupants. An exhausted and freshly healed Harry trails in front of Crowley, who is nudging him towards a couch. The two inhuman beings can both see the boy shivering from quite a bit more than cold, and another twinge of irritation and anger twitches through them. It’s a good thing the two were there, because there’s no telling when Harry would have gotten real medical care otherwise. </p><p>Aziraphale locks the doors and glances back to Harry with a sympathetic, worried, gaze, hands twitching to help as Crowley shoves a glass of water into the child’s shaking hands.</p><p>“Harry,” Crowley says, softer than Aziraphale has heard from him in a long time. The Nanny Astoreth part of him was usually the one softer with children, but Crowley’s hair remains short and his eyes are uncovered. The demon settles a hand next to Harry on the couch. The boy looks as if he wants to run under Crowley’s strange, snakelike gaze. “Do you want to go back to your… erg…. house?”</p><p>The boy glances at Aziraphale. Then, back at Crowley. “I don’t have much of a choice, do I?” He looks almost frightened before he averts his eyes.</p><p>“Oh sod that thought off,” Crowley growls, standing again. “We aren’t forcing you to go back <em> there </em> if it discorporates us in the process.” He snorts. “I may be evil incarnate, wahoo, but when you hurt <em> kids </em> or anyone besides who bloody deserves it, you’re not exactly an <em> angel.”  </em></p><p>“What he means,” Aziraphale continues as he joins Crowley’s side,  “Is that we’d rather like it if you stayed here. With us, until you can find a better home or until school if you prefer.” </p><p>Harry ponders this thought for a moment. He’s also pondering the legitimacy of the statement that Crowley is evil incarnate, but he focuses more on panicking at how nice they’re being to him. It’s unfamiliar. Unwelcome -- but only because he’s so incredibly sure he’s going to wake up in a cold sweat on that driveway with his uncle looming over him, Crowley, Hagrid, and Aziraphale all a nice dream.</p><p>“With you?” His curious green eyes dart about. His hair flashes into his eyes, and he mourns the loss of his glasses. Through his blurry vision, he finds Aziraphale holding a perfect, no-longer-smashed-to-bits, pair of his glasses. He accepts that with an open, confused stare. “Wh-”</p><p>“Best not to question it, dear.” A smile flutters onto Azirahale’s face. “And of course, I have more than enough room in the flat upstairs.</p><p>(A new room weaves into construction now, as they speak. Aziraphale concluded he was only <em> half </em>lying.)</p><p>Harry is silent for a long time, and the two let him be. He seems to sweat under the pressure, so Aziraphale goes around and prepares him a cup of tea, while Crowley kicks around dust and waits for an answer. The demon looks like he’s itching to let himself relax and sit down, so when Aziraphale walks back over, he sets a placating hand on the demon’s shoulder.</p><p>“I…” Harry swallows. “I’ll stay.”</p><p>Crowley breathes out a heavy sigh. He collapses, and Harry almost thinks he’d just passed out. His figure seems to fold onto itself, revealing a writhing, gigantic snake -- a mass of jagged ruby red scales and pearlescent eyes the same size as Crowley had just been. He’s huge, but Harry has the feeling that he could be a <em> lot </em>bigger.</p><p>Aziraphale lets out a matching breath. Suddenly, great white wings erupt through his back like twin limbs. They twitch as they curl around the room, brushing against bookshelves and then up against Crowley as the snake heaves its body into the sky and stares, unblinking, and right at Harry.</p><p>“You’re the serpent!” Harry stands, eyes opening in surprise and excitement, anxiety forgotten, if not gone. Crowley is very much taken aback. “The- the one from Eden!”</p><p>“I- I-” Crowley stutters in surprise. “Well, <em> yeah.” </em></p><p>“My aunt and Uncle were Christian, and I-” He gapes. “Wow, I can’t believe I was actually right when I guessed. I just saw the wings and the snake. But you... don’t seem very evil.”</p><p>“I’m still evil,” Crowley grumbles halfheartedly. Aziraphale glares at him for a second, before smiling at Harry again. </p><p>“What he means, is <em>yes, </em>he is the snake of Eden. And I, am the Principality Aziraphale. I am The Guardian of the Eastern Gate in the Garden.”</p><p>“You met in the Garden? You were a <em> guardian?” </em> Harry’s eyes sparkle with astonishment, and he straightens to attention, head and eyes whipping about, seeming to stare at each individual scale and feather. Crowley slides up onto Aziraphale’s arm. “You’re not even shapeshifters or anything, this is <em> amazing-” </em></p><p>“And,” Aziraphale says, feeling that a little boasting never hurts, “We helped stop the apocalypse.”</p><p>---</p><p>Harry, for the first time in his life since his parent’s deaths, has a good end of his summer. </p><p>It’s spent flipping through books, listening to stories from Crowley and Aziraphale, learning proper owl (and snake) care, etc. It’s a wildly confusing and startling summer. The Dursley’s don’t come looking for him, though, and he isn’t surprised in the slightest. What he <em>is </em>surprised about is the number of wizards who try to find him and congratulate him, talk to him, kidnap him, etc. Aziraphale seems more than slightly disgruntled at the new customers he’s begun to receive.</p><p>He’s taught of the past, and the present, and the lies planted within it all. He’s taught of Crowley, and of Aziraphale, and of the Fall and of everything else between. He’d loved to learn even when all he could learn was rubbish. Or, barely anything, when he was focusing on not being turned into bloody pulp at school than he was learning. He learns maths and English, and all the other subjects he’d been barely grasping before he moved in with Aziraphale and Crowley. He learns a few new spells and learns them <em>with </em> Aziraphale and Crowley. </p><p>(The two turn out completely incompetent with spells.)</p><p> He makes fast friends with Warlock, Adam, Pepper, Brian, and Wensleydale. He meets another witch -- an American one -- and she immediately begins to school him, chastising Aziraphale and Crowley over half of the things they do with their wands. By the end of it all, he’s become absolutely… something.</p><p>It’s a strange emotional brew, the one he feels, and one he can’t really seem to be able to put into words. Crowley and Aziraphale have become more of a family than the Dursleys ever would be.</p><p>And then, school arrives. </p><p>---</p><p>Aziraphale flys about his room in his flat, shoving his suitcase full of things and having a few near-misses of snapping his wand in half.</p><p>“Is everything packed, dear?” He peaks out his door, looking into Crowley’s room. The demon had moved in after Harry. It was simply easier than him going back and forth between homes. The room, and the upstairs flat in general, had begun to look a bit like a makeshift Garden of Eden. </p><p>Crowley lounges on his bed and brushes his knuckles thoughtfully against his suitcase. “All ready, same as the last time you checked.” He goes back to thinking in silence and glaring at a succulent on his windowsill. Aziraphale turns to Harry’s room and smiles.</p><p>The boy has taken to squashing all of his belongings into his suitcase with a fervor any eleven-year-old would have. Clothes and bits of everything are strewn all over the floor, and Aziraphale kneels down next to him, showing him how to actually pack while the boy watches silently. After a moment of silence in which Harry contemplates whether asking “Is neatness really important?” he starts gently settling things into his case. It takes him a bit of time but he eventually finds he can shut and lock the case without snapping his wand in half with frustration.</p><p>“You pack like Warlock,”  Crowley grumbles, walking into the room, suitcase in hand. Aziraphale grabs his own with a nearly imperceptible “oof.” </p><p>They walk out of the room and out of the house in varying degrees of success. Crowley has to yell at a plant, Aziraphale has to lock another window, Harry has to find another sock. </p><p>(If one marks time by the amount of time it takes for an Angel, Demon, and Human together to get out of a door, an hour would be twelve.)</p><p>Finally, when the sun is beginning to feel tired of passing time for them, they make their way out to the car. It’s a sunny, unfamiliar afternoon, where rain clouds threaten to push at the horizon but haven’t quite arrived yet. Queen bursts from a disc, covering some conversational Mozart or Tchaikovsky, and Harry can’t help but hum along to the tune of Bohemian Rhapsody. The streets are lousy with cars, but Crowley still speeds so quickly that Aziriphale starts to glare at him.</p><p>When they get to the station, it is just as packed as anything, and Harry starts to wonder how they’re going to find a mysterious platform -- or normal one -- at all. They skim around the edges of the crowds, pressed near walls and tucking themselves into empty rooms to avoid the horrible amount of people. Harry sees platform ten just when it seems all hope is lost, and his eyes widen, hands coming up to push his glasses up his head on reflex. </p><p>“Crowley,” he says, hoping to catch his attention over the angry buzz of sound in the area.”I found it.”</p><p>“Hgk?” He tips his head down, orange flashing behind his glasses. “Where’s it at, then?”</p><p>Harry nods at it, and Aziraphale starts to form a loose path forward, trailing in front of them like he’s leading a pack of ducks. People subconsciously step away, leaving them room. “Well,” Crowley drawls. “Where is it, then? Platform 9 and a quarter, or whatever Rubeus called it.”</p><p>Aziraphale responds with surprising patience. “Its platform 9 and 3 quarters, love.” They finish their trip, standing before the two separate platforms. Harry’s cart -- with Hedwig, and his many packages -- looks ridiculously out of place, but so do Aziraphale and Crowley by nature. The crowd doesn’t resume it’s crowding around them. For no reason any of the humans can think of, they drift off.</p><p>“Do professors ride the train?” Harry asks, strolling between the two. He’s begun to fill in his own form, and his clothes fit much better. His glasses, too, fit perfectly.</p><p>“That’s what Rubeus told us.” Crowley shrugs, and glances between platforms 10, and 9. He looks again. He blinks. “Shit.”</p><p>“Language!” Aziraphale steps forward and runs a hand over the wall, looking for any more labels and finding none. Harry, behind them, starts to look a little nervous. “Harry, it <em> was </em>9 and 3 quarters, correct?”</p><p>“Yeah,” he says, and holds his ticket up helplessly. “It- it’s right here.”</p><p>Out of the crowd --</p><p>"-- packed with Muggles, of course--"</p><p>Harry, Crowley, and Aziraphale all swing around at once. The voice came from a plump, motherly looking woman who was talking to four boys, all of whom had bright red-heads of flaming hair. All of the boys had a trunk -- next to a little girl who was staring jealously -- and one of them had an owl.</p><p>"Now, what's the platform number?" the children’s mother says.</p><p>"Nine and three-quarters!" The little red-headed girl squeezes her mother’s hand and looks up to her with a desperate look. "Mom, can't I go. . . "</p><p>"You're not old enough, Ginny, now be quiet. All right, Percy, you go first. "</p><p>The eldest -- but still not very old -- boy marches to the between-space beside platforms nine and ten. All three of the unknown spectators watch, unblinking -- which wasn’t very hard for an Angel, snake, or eager and excitable child -- as the boy runs between the air. He seems to split through atoms, flying forward with some childlike determination. </p><p>Just before they can see what happens, though, a great cloud of tourists clouds their vision. Crowley curses vividly enough to make a priest cry.</p><p>"Fred, you next," the woman says. She nods at one of the boys identical to the other.</p><p>"I'm not Fred, I'm George.” One of them rolls their eyes. "Honestly, woman, you call yourself our mother? Can't you tell I'm George?"</p><p>"Sorry, George, dear. "</p><p>"Only joking, I am Fred.” The boy winks and a toothy smile appears on his face right before he runs forward, hurried on by his brother’s chants of “Hurry up!” He disappears. Aziraphale is the one to sigh in troubled annoyance this time.</p><p>“You would think they would explain this,” Aziraphale says. “Especially for teachers.” </p><p>Now the third brother was half sprinting to the barrier, and he was almost there -- and then, sudden as anything, he collided with the wall and wasn’t there at all.</p><p>There was nothing else to do for it.</p><p>"Excuse me, "Aziraphale said to the older woman. She turns and smiles at him warmly, the way any mother might smile when they’re happy. “I was only wondering if you could tell us how to get into the platform?”</p><p>“Hello, dears.” She smiles even wider as Harry comes walking up. “First year at Hogwarts? Ron-” She gestures to the youngest boy “Is new too.” </p><p>The boy, despite being only Harry’s age, is tall, with big hands and feet, and an unruly mop of red hair. It rivals Harry’s ridiculous mess of hair, minus the jet black shade. Freckles poured across his cheeks like blush. Crowley looks at them -- the woman and the girl with their long, red hair -- and he muses that maybe his long hair should make a return.</p><p>“Yes,” Harry tells her. “The thing is, none of us know how to get onto the platform.”</p><p>“Oh, not to worry," she says. "All you have to do is walk straight at the barrier. Don't stop and, <em> don't </em>be scared you'll crash into it. That's very important.” She pauses as if done, then reconsiders. “You’d Best do it at a bit of a run if you're nervous. Go on, go now before Ron. "</p><p>Harry looks up to his guardians, and they both nod. “We will see you on the other side, Harry,” Aziraphale says, prompting him to go with a brief smile. Crowley waves a hand about and scrunches up his nose.</p><p> Harry gulps, fingers whitening against the handlebar of his cart. He starts slow, then speeds up, mouth twisted in worry and anxiety. All of this before -- in a flurry of an angry owl and childlike determination -- he disappears.</p><p>She turns to Aziraphale and Crowley. “Are you his fathers?”</p><p>Aziraphale -- who hadn’t been born prone to blushing -- but who had grown into the habit, flushed pink. Crowley rolled his eyes under his sunglasses. “Ah- ngk. No, not really.” Crowley shrugs, feigning cool nonchalance while he thinks on her question internally. “We’re not together. Only friends. Harry’s parents ‘ave died, and- and so we er... Took him in.”</p><p>“Harry..” Ron runs the name under and around his tongue, and then his eyes light up. “You mean Harry Potter?! The boy who lived?”</p><p>“I-”</p><p>“Ron, it’s rude to ask things like that,” the woman states, disapproving. </p><p>“It’s quite alright,” Aziraphale assures her, with a patient smile. “Yes, he is Harry Potter. We probably should be joining him.”</p><p>Before the younger boy can start growing more excited, his mother smiles and speaks again. “Well, it was nice to meet you…”</p><p>“Professor Fell,” Aziraphale says, with a smile. “And-”</p><p>“Professor Crowley.” Crowley nods at her.</p><p>“The pleasure is all ours, ma’am.” Aziraphale shakes her hand and lets her introduce herself.</p><p>“Oh! Molly, Molly Weasley, but you can just call me Molly.” She purses her lips. “Ma’am is to bloody formal.”</p><p>“Well, Molly, thank you.” </p><p>No longer hesitant, the two rush through the barrier, looking around for snow-white wings and dark black hair. Shrieks, laughs, chatting, crying. It all floods a nearly identical twin of King’s Cross station -- despite the towering black train upon the tracks. It's high necked figure breaks apart the scene in a perfect split. Children mill about and fill its cars, while parents help them with their luggage or tearfully say goodbye. Aziraphale and Crowley catch Harry pressed against a wall. He's utterly stuck, yet still driving forward, eyes narrowed at an empty compartment not far away. </p><p>Crowley shoves himself through and grabs onto the side of Harry’s cart, ignoring the boy as he looks up at his Godfather in surprise. </p><p>"My turn," he mutters, before a grin spreads across his face. He fully grips the handle, turning it to the side and nearly squashing a few people as he weaves expertly through the crowd. People yelp and dive away from his careening path, but seem unperturbed and unsurprised. In the end and by what should be a miracle, he arrives safely to the car Harry’d been eyeballing, the other two hurrying behind him before their chance to move closes up. </p><p>They stand for a moment, catching their breath. It is all too chaotic in the station. The rest of the area seems to have a cool regard for the small group, now that they've assembled near the train car.</p><p>“Alright, Harry.” Aziraphale sighs then begins to lift luggage into the empty cart. Crowley helps as well, in the form of climbing into the carriage and helping Harry to carry his trunk and Hedwig's cage inside. The suitcase lies flat on its side in the corner, and Hedwig hoots appreciatively when Crowley sets her on a seat and unlatches the cage. “I guess, it’s our time to go," the Angel says, soft. "I heard someone saying that the staff car was in the front.”</p><p>“Don’t get lost,” Harry tells Aziraphale, and the man smiles appreciatively and almost rolls his eyes. Harry turns to Crowley. “Don’t eat anyone’s pets.”</p><p>“Screw off.” Crowley smiles a wicked smile, but the smug fondness in it is so thick anyone could probably reach up and touch it.</p><p>“Don’t be rude, either of you.” Aziraphale finishes his incredibly insincere chastising, and holds his arms out to Harry, accepting a small and one-armed hesitant hug from the boy. He pulls away right as Harry does, hands clasped again, eyes ringed with maybe-pride.</p><p>“Now, climb on in.”</p>
