    <p>Draco felt his chest tighten as he looked at that stupid, <em>so fucking </em>stupid Granger from the other side of the Great Hall. He looked at her carefully, without even wanting to, he paid attention to the way she hugged the Weasel and the way she cried softly on his shoulder. The world had been about to crash about two hours ago and, even though Potter had been victorious, Draco couldn’t even think about it. Not when Granger had been <em>so stupid. </em>He wanted to go there and scream at her, maybe even point his own wand at her.</p><p>Hell, she was supposed to be the smart one in there, Draco thought. But, still, she had dared to face so many Death Eaters and she had even entered the Chamber with that useless Weasley boy. She had risked her life so many times that day and she had been so close to dying that Draco was still surprised she had got lucky. Maybe being the Chosen One’s best friend had helped to it or maybe it was just her who had managed to be successful in every mad plan that weird and annoying trio had organised.</p><p>However, her being alive and the Dark Lord being defeated was a fact.</p><p>Draco couldn’t think of a reason not to be happy at that moment, but he felt helpless inside. And then he remembered the way his Slytherin mates had looked at him when he had entered the Great Hall by himself, having left his mother outside, as if he were a traitor because of having fought for both sides. He thought about his father, the way Draco had yelled at him for not being brave enough to do the right thing for once, the way he had told him he felt ashamed to be his son and the way he had spitted that he was a coward.</p><p>And then Lucius was gone, and his dear mother was crying on his shoulder. And Draco had held her until Andromeda had come, accomplishing something that had seemed impossible at the time: Forgiveness. But still, Draco felt helpless. And empty.</p><p>No matter how McGonagall had sworn to protect him and his mother, who had been crucial to Potter’s victory. No matter how the Weasley patriarch had told him solemnly that his choice not to take Voldemort’s side at the end had been the good one, and that his actions wouldn’t be forgotten at the trial. His mother had kept on crying and he had maintained that empty look on his face.</p><p>Draco was going to trial. He was going to be tried. And he wasn’t sure about the outcome. It didn’t matter anymore; he didn’t care anymore. He just thought about how stupid Granger had been.</p><p>He thought about how much he’d like to approach her and then he remembered her crying in agony at his living room’s floor and he stopped himself from doing that madness. How on Earth had she been so stupid to risk her life in so many different ways and still, be proud of it?</p><p>But she was Granger; he reminded himself, nodding as he helped a first year with his bandages. She was that incredibly talented witch who was also a Griffindor, Merlin knows why. She was brave, and pure, and she was also so <em>bloody</em> stupid.</p><p>Hogwarts was in ruins and there was so much to do. Granger had been the first one to offer to come back next year and even spend her summer there trying to fix anything but Draco wasn’t sure about how <em>on Earth </em>she was planning to fix all the broken hearts that that war had left behind. Hers, to begin with.</p><p>“Malfoy” said a voice in a neutral tone, waking him up from his thoughts. Draco rolled his eyes when he saw who he had in front of him.</p><p>“Well, if it isn’t Potter, the boy who lived, the boy who won” he replied, smirking. Potter frowned and sat next to him. He looked terrible: his scar on the forehead wasn’t going to be the only one he was going to have for the rest of his life. Draco didn’t look much better himself; he knew it. But he didn’t care, either. He was as destroyed inside as he looked on the outside.</p><p>“I’ve talked to your mother. I will defend you on the trial…” Potter began, but Draco cut him off.</p><p>“Don’t bother, Potter” he murmured. Potter shook his head.</p><p>“Have you heard me? Have you heard McGonagall? You have chances to win the trial. You are part of the good ones, now. You should be thinking about your defense right now” Potter tried to explain, but Draco just laughed.</p><p>“Are you deaf, Potter? I don’t want a defense. I don’t deserve to win the trial. I just hope my sentence is long and I die in there”. And he really believed it. Potter got up and offered his hand.</p><p>“I’m going to do it anyway” he said, and Draco sighed. He was a stubborn one, Potter. But he didn’t complain, either. He just kept sitting there, looking around and wondering if all the chaos had been worth something. Next year was going to be a difficult one at Hogwarts. He just tried not to think about all the Slytherin boys who would be clearly ashamed of having been sorted in that house. Perhaps McGonagall finally, fucking finally made the whole house disappear.</p><p>And he also tried not to think about Granger, not to look at her while she was repairing the windows of the Great Hall, along with old Sluggy. She looked terribly tired, as if she had been on the run for several months. She had, indeed. She had also suffered a <em>Crucciatus</em> curse for hours and she had received terrible scars from his aunt. Draco shook his head.</p><p>Yet, he wondered why he was thinking about her, how he hadn’t stopped thinking about her since that night at Malfoy Manor. She then surprised him looking at her and he saw in her eyes so many emotions, as if she was trying not to cry. And he felt emptier inside. She then moved a foot towards him and he didn’t think it twice. He just got up and left that unbearable place.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>“Hermione, you can’t change this” Harry started, but Hermione shook her head furiously. They were all sitting at Griffindor’s common room. Herself, Harry and Ron, who had placed his hand protectively over her knee. She tried to calm herself down.</p><p>“It’s not fair! It is not fair, you know it.” she whined.</p><p>“’Mione, there’s nothing fair about war. There is nothing fair about anything that has happened”. Harry was right.</p><p>She hadn’t cried yet.</p><p>Ron hadn’t been able to keep it together any longer, and he had just screamed and yelled until she had shut him up with a kiss. He was a wreck, trembling against her. She couldn’t think of a way of calming him, not after seeing Fred’s corpse, not after seeing all those dead people, all those familiar faces and all that suffering that was going to come, that was already happening.</p><p>“They don’t get to have that” Hermione whispered. Harry shook his head. He was the hero of the story, books were going to be written about him, but he just looked so tired. So, so tired. So did she, but she knew she could take it. She was just on a quick break, she reminded herself. As soon as she was done with Harry’s wounds (they had agreed not to take him to the nursery, not when there was so much terror and pain in there, real, physical pain to be taken care of), Hermione was going back to the corridors.</p><p>“Hermione, it’s a way to know their stories, their reasons. They are going to be tried, there’s no way they are getting out of going to Azkaban”. Harry looked like the voice of the reason. That wasn’t his part to play. It was <em>hers</em>. She was the only one who had the right to say reasonable stuff. “Maybe now we get to avoid another rise. Now that we get to know what these people think, what were their objectives…” Harry continued with all those well-structured arguments against her idea. But she knew she was right.</p><p>“Their objectives? You don’t know what they were?” she almost shouted. “Oh, let me explain it for you. For starts, <em>oh, right. </em>They wanted to kill all Muggleborns. And we are a lot. Maybe keep us as slaves. What else? <em>What fucking else, </em>Harry?” she continued.</p><p>“I know that…” Harry interrupted.</p><p>“Oh, now I remember. They wanted a society based on blood purity, terror and chaos”</p><p>“If we want to build a better society, we need to do this the right way. We all know the outcome, but there still needs to be a bloody trial!”</p><p>“They don’t deserve it” Ron interrupted. “They don’t deserve to explain themselves”. He said it in a low tone, almost husky, and Hermione had shivered. Buts she agreed. She didn’t feel bad about it.</p><p>“Ron, some of them actually changed sides. What about Snape?” Harry continued.</p><p>“It’s funny, you know, that it’s Harry bloody Potter who says it. May I remember that they killed your parents? Sirius? Lupin, Tonks? Moody? My fucking brother?” Ron asked, looking straight at him. Hermione watched them in silence as they challenged each other, maybe about to rip each other’s hearts out.</p><p>“He is right” Hermione whispered. Both of them looked at her and she just swallowed.</p><p>“Thanks, ´Mione. Of course, I am right. Forgiveness was what Dumbledore taught us, do you even remember that?” Harry said, obviously in a sarcastic way, but Hermione smiled at that and looked at both of their best friends, sitting across from each other and breathing heavily.</p><p>“<em>Ron</em> is right” she replied, looking at Ron in the eye, the way he was even more surprised than Harry to have her support.</p><p>“They deserve to rot themselves in a cell. Not even that. They deserve to die, not with an <em>Avada</em>. They deserve to die in a painful, slow death. They deserve everything bad that happens in this world, but us giving them the chance to escape… it basically explains why we are the good ones” she said.</p><p>Hermione got up and straightened her already broken and filthy top. Ron came closer to her and she let him hug her, she let his warmth embrace her and she tried to feel safe, to feel anything, but she didn’t. And she was scared to death. But she didn’t cry. She hadn’t cried yet.</p><p>“Maybe I’m tired of being the good one, you know” she whispered against Ron’s shoulder, as he caressed her hair. “Perhaps everything bad that’s happened to us is a reminder of why we shouldn’t be the good ones” she continued, closing her eyes. She felt Harry’s hand on her back and she breathed again, having them both next to her. They didn’t even know how tired she was, how much she loved them and how much she hated herself for loving so fiercely.</p><p>“There’s more” Harry murmured. Hermione lifted her head to him and bit her bottom lip.</p><p>“Now you’re going to tell us we are invited to the trials” Ron guessed. “Save yourself the speech. If I get near any of them, I will cut their arm off” he said, bitterly.</p><p>“I wouldn’t…” Harry began. But Hermione knew what was coming. She knew he was about to say something incredibly stupid and brave and good, and she didn’t want to hear it.</p><p>“Spit it out, already” she cut him off.</p><p>“It’s Malfoy. He is going to be tried, so is his mum. And I think you should be there. I am. I’m defending him” he said, at last.</p><p>She got quiet. She couldn’t move. She had completely forgotten about Malfoy. He was a Death Eater, too. He was going to be tried. And Harry was trying to help him. She felt Ron’s respiration fasten and she took his hand with strength.</p><p>“He has the Mark. He’s equal to any of them. Nothing changes” he said.</p><p>“Everything changes. If you don’t remember, it was his mum who saved me. If not for her, I would be dead. And Voldemort would have won”. Hermione felt a shiver down her spine when she listened that name. Ron swore under his breath.</p><p>“He was there when ´Mione was tortured. He was there and did nothing.”</p><p>“He switched sides after all; he did it not because he thought they were going to lose but because he believed in our cause”.</p><p>“Are you sure about that?”</p><p>“I am” Harry said, fiercely.</p><p>“What about all the times he’s bullied us? He’s hated us and he’s called us so many names, and now you decide to help him?”</p><p>“Would you rather watch him die in Azkaban?”</p><p>“That family doesn’t deserve our pity…”</p><p>“Just stop” Hermione whispered. “Stop talking. Don’t talk about Malfoy, don’t talk about anything”. She couldn’t bear it.</p><p>Malfoy was going to be condemned, she was sure. No one, apart from Harry, was going to defend him. But she knew Harry was right. She just didn’t want to accept it.</p><p>She knew Malfoy had saved her life, last night, when a curse who was meant to disarm her hit his chest and she just stood there, watching him groan in pain as she took Ron’s hand, who hadn’t even noticed it, and ran away to kill that snake.</p><p>Hermione didn’t think Malfoy remembered at all. But she knew it. She knew it had happened and she knew she owed him. But she also knew he deserved to be tried and he deserve to explain himself.</p><p>And he <em>deserved to be free.</em></p><p>But that didn’t matter anymore. Because the war was over and everyone that Hermione cared about was safe. Dead or alive.</p><p>She hadn’t cried yet.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>When Hermione woke up in the middle of the night, it still felt like all her bones had been broken at the same time. She wondered whether that painful feeling would disappear, or maybe it was the aftermath of that night at Malfoy Manor, the consequences of all those months starving to death, always on the run, always exhausted. She cringed at the memory and found herself breathing heavily. She wasn’t able to cope with all the stress.</p><p>Hermione got up carefully, not wanting to wake any of her friends up. All of the former members of the DA had agreed on sleeping at the Common room, at least until all their parents would come back to pick them up. She realized her parents wouldn’t be able to take her home, basically because they didn’t know she existed. She couldn’t look around without noticing all of them had lost someone important during the war.</p><p>Hermione took one blanket and her purse, and she walked away. She needed to free her mind and that amount of people weren’t helping, so she went to the only place she felt she could be useful at: the hospital wing. There were still so many people in severe conditions, even days after the Battle, that she felt sick. St. Mungos hadn’t predicted that amount of injuries, so they had had to keep most of the wounded here, at Hogwarts.</p><p>One thing they all could agree on; Hogwarts didn’t feel like home anymore. It felt like death. Like a cemetery. Hermione didn’t hesitate and asked Madam Pomfrey what to do.</p><p>“You shouldn’t be here, darling” the nurse whispered, taking her hand. Hermione half smiled. She shouldn’t be anywhere, actually. She should be dead. Last night, to be precise. She wasn’t, thought, and there was one sole person who was responsible for that.</p><p>“I couldn’t sleep. It’s been days. And, still, I can’t sleep” she explained, not meeting Madam Pomfrey’s eyes. It had been 5 days. 5 days doing nothing but repair the walls of the school and the wounds of those hurt in battle. But there was so much to do, so much work to keep her mind busy.</p><p>“Maybe I could give you some sleeping potions…”the nurse suggested, but Hermione shook her head. She had tried. She had tried everything. Firewhisky had helped the most, to be honest.</p><p>“Please, let me help. I need to do something” she asked. Madam Pomfrey didn’t say anything, but led her between the beds and the people and pointed at those who still hadn’t had their wounds closed and stitched. When explained how to perform the spells, she smiled. Madam Pomfrey couldn’t understand the amount of times she had had to use those healing spells over the last years. She wasn’t the best at it, and Hermione personally thought that muggle stitches worked better and didn’t leave such scars. It was more laborious, but she didn’t really have anything else to do.</p><p>So she began to work on the patients, carefully choosing those who were half asleep or didn’t know who she was. She just didn’t want to talk to anybody.</p><p>Time passed, and Hermione lost count of how many scars she had healed. She didn’t think about anything, she just stitched and stitched. Her hands hurt and she felt tired, but she had to keep going. She had to escape from the night and all those hateful dreams that followed her whenever she tried to fall asleep. The sun rose, all nurses left for a rest and she kept stitching, changing beds, giving pain remedies, not talking to anyone. Hours later, she had sore fingers and her back hurt like hell, but she didn’t know if it was because of the <em>Cruciatus</em> or the long hours she had spent in the same position. She hadn’t opened her mouth, she hadn’t said a word and she felt like the world was a much quiet place, a peaceful one. Hermione wondered how it would feel if she just didn’t speak for the rest of her life. There wasn’t much to say, to be honest with herself.</p><p>Hermione checked her last patient and realized it had been hours since her last meal. She got up and walked towards the door of the hospital wing, when she heard Madam’s voice behind the door and stopped. Hermione found herself listening behind the door to whatever conversation Pomfrey was having.</p><p>“She’s been up all night and all day. Maybe 18 hours. She can’t stay like this. She needs help” she heard the nurse whisper.</p><p>“We’ve tried everything, but Merlin knows how stubborn she is” another voice pointed out. <em>Harry.</em></p><p>“She tries to rebuild everything all by herself” a third voice agreed. <em>Ronald.</em></p><p>“We are all coping with our demons in or own way” Ron said, whispering. “She is at least doing something for the greater good”. Hermione then swore in her mind. They were talking about her, obviously. They happened to enjoy talking about her and her emotions.</p><p>“Ron, she’s killing herself. She doesn’t sleep. She doesn’t talk about anything that’s happened. She just avoids the freaking conversation”</p><p>“Maybe we should all do the same! Pretend nothing happened…”</p><p>“Weasley!”</p><p>“It’s true! I don’t know, I trust her. I know she’ll do the right thing. She’s a freaking <em>sister</em> to me”.</p><p>“Sister? I thought…”</p><p>“You thought wrong. I guess it was the adrenaline. I still love her to death, though. Why are we talking about this?”</p><p>“Don’t pretend you aren’t hurt she didn’t want anything with you. You both have been trying to avoid your feelings for years…”</p><p>“And what? We all need each other in many different ways right now. Maybe in the future…”</p><p>“Boys, I don’t think this is the moment” Madam Pomfrey interrupted. Hermione frowned.</p><p>There were children who had just become orphans, people in that room fighting for their lives, parents whose kids had disappeared or died and Death Eaters who were on the run. But they were talking about <em>her </em>and her relationship with both of the boys. Oh, she felt furious.</p><p>“You know she hasn’t cried yet. You’ve cried, I’ve cried. Everyone has” Harry murmured.</p><p>“She might not need to cry. She’s freaking strong, you know…”</p><p>“I CARE ABOUT HER, RON! I won’t sit around when my best friend is about to have a panic attack whenever we mention what we’ve been through. What if she is in shock?”</p><p>“And I care about her just as much as you do, but whenever we try to talk to her she runs off. She doesn’t even stay at night. Maybe it’s best if we leave her.”</p><p>Hermione shook her head. For once, Ron was right. Merlin, how much she loved that giant pain. But, again, she felt so freaking helpless, with her friends worrying about her and herself not being able to tell them what was wrong. She opened the door of the hospital wing and went out; finding herself in front of both boys, one beside the other, looking at her with so much worry in their eyes Hermione couldn’t take it. Ginny was there, as well as Neville. And as the little one of the Weasley opened her arms to welcome her, Hermione stepped back and shook her head. No one could understand that she just wanted to fix the destruction that had surrounded her.</p><p>She shook her head and ran right, climbing the stairs.</p><p>Without even wanting it, she found herself in the Astronomy Tower. She took a packet of cigarettes from her purse. It was her father’s. Her heart ached remembering her parents, who she hadn’t been able to find yet. It wasn’t necessary at the moment, she reminded herself. She had time to cure everyone and then she could be able to have her family back. Hermione hesitated, but she found out she didn’t really care, so she just lit one cigarette up and breathed the smell that calmed all her body down. Maybe this muggle habit she’d been trying to avoid for long summers was the only way to escape from her problems, just until the cigarette burned itself to ashes in her mouth.</p><p>She hadn’t cried yet; she knew something was wrong with her and she knew not facing her feelings was going to be a big problem. But she wasn’t strong enough to cope with the stress, the pain, the sadness that being alive brought.</p><p>She wasn’t alone, though.</p><p>“I know you’re there” she whispered, turning around from her place, sitting down on her knees, back on the window. Hermione had felt that presence since she had arrived to her hidden place. She just didn’t care who was there. At least, she thought she didn’t mind, not until she recognized his face and her heart fell to her feet.</p><p>“Malfoy” she whispered. She hadn’t seen him since the morning after the battle, at the Great Hall, and she wasn’t going to lie, he looked like crap. His eyes looked bigger than ever, no light in them, surrounded by dark circles. He wasn’t thin at all, but he looked scrawny and tired, and his jaw looked sharpest than ever.</p><p> But it was his way of moving that shocked her. As if he was trying not to scare her, moving into the light slowly. The dark robes she was used to see him into had disappeared. He was just wearing trainers, an old sweater and jeans. Hermione put the blanket over her shoulders and opened the purse, looking for another cigarette.</p><p>“I should leave” Malfoy said, his voice flat. Hermione looked at him, frowning, while she held the cigarette between her lips and lit it with the muggle lighter.</p><p>“You should” she agreed. But he didn’t move, and Hermione found herself wondering why he was still there, why he hadn’t left her alone. He just looked at her as she smoked and she thought he would probably be thinking the same about her. She looked terrible, her hair frizzy and tangled, her face pale and scratched and her soul broken.</p><p>But Malfoy hadn’t left and she felt uncomfortable in his presence.</p><p>“You’re being tried” Hermione commented, exhaling the smoke. He just blinked and nodded.</p><p>“I am”</p><p>“You shouldn’t be tried” she said, not being able to hold back and shut up. He looked at her, without understanding. “Every Death Eater should just get the kiss and be locked in forever”. Malfoy sat next to her and Hermione hugged her knees, after throwing the holder away.</p><p>“Do you really think so?” he asked, his tone low, as he approached her. Hermione nodded, half smiling.</p><p>“I do”</p><p>“Then, thankfully the Ministry will listen to the Brightest Witch’s wish and end my torment” he added, bitterly. Hermione got up and took her purse, not looking away from him.</p><p>“But you changed your mind” she whispered. Malfoy rolled his eyes and Hermione guessed he had already heard those words several times.</p><p>“Cut the crap, Granger. Do you need to see the Mark?”</p><p>“Whatever. I have better places to be”. She didn’t insist. <em>You might be worse than them, since you took the mark because you were scared and not because you believed in him.</em></p><p>“Working your ass off until you faint? I’ve seen you, Granger; I know what panic attacks are when I see them. You should tell McGonagall” he said, and Hermione felt that now familiar rage in her chest. How dare he? He had no right to observe her; he had no right to even talk to her. Not when he was about to be tried and she wasn’t going to be there. He shouldn’t be there, making her furious. He shouldn’t be there, noticing those things no one had. And she should be leaving, she shouldn’t be talking with him.</p><p>“Shut up”</p><p>“I’m not stupid, Granger”. <em>Just let me be, Malfoy, stop pretending to care. Work on your trial and be free.</em></p><p>“What do you care?” she snapped. “Why do you suddenly pay so much attention to what I do? Just…” She breathed and got up. “Just take care of your own shit, Malfoy. You have enough to deal with”. She walked past him and was about to go down the stairs when she heard his voice again.</p><p>“I also wish we didn’t get to be tried. I don’t want to be saved”. She looked up at him and her heart shrank. Malfoy looked so small, so broken and so sorry. Hermione had been avoiding that kind of people who felt too much for the last week. She just had to get away from there.</p><p>“You deserve the chance” she whispered, instead. “I don’t think you do, but they do and they won’t let you rot in hell”. Malfoy laughed.</p><p>“So, what happened to Granger, defender of the lost causes?”</p><p>“Maybe you are not the cause I want to fight for” Hermione replied.</p><p>She didn’t know why she was talking to him that way, why she wasn’t about to cry and why she didn’t feel anything inside. But Malfoy just smiled.</p><p>“I wouldn’t be the cause I would choose to fight for, either” he agreed, and Hermione relaxed her shoulders. Malfoy looked outside the giant windows and sighed.</p><p>“Maybe we are all doomed, all of us who fought.” He said, after a minute. Hermione thought about it. He was right. She also deserved to be tried, for lying, killing. For having hope and not losing it even though everyone screamed at her to let go. It might have been her mistake.</p><p>“I’m not sorry of my choices” she just said.</p><p>“I am”</p><p>“Then fix them. Try to get as many supporters as you can before the trial.”</p><p>“You just said…” he started.</p><p>“I know what I said. I don’t think you should get to explain yourself. I don’t know why you did all those horrible things and I certainly don’t want to know your real reasons because they might be worse than those I imagined” Hermione interrupted him.</p><p>“Will you forgive me?” His question confused her.</p><p>“What does it matter? I will be gone after this place is repaired”. Malfoy smirked.</p><p>“We both know you won’t”</p><p>“If you know me so well, you’ll know my only question here is why you saved me, that night” she then snapped. She had had enough of philosophy, of forgiveness and all that crap.</p><p>“I don’t know. Will you forgive me?” he repeated, frowning. She shrugged and turned her back on him.</p><p>“I don’t know. Do you feel sorry for saving me?”</p><p>“No. Do you feel sorry for killing the man who attacked me right after I took the curse?”</p><p>“No”. And with that said, silence sat between them. She frowned at him, still trying to understand him. He was being honest in a brutal way and she didn’t know why that conversation had been the only interesting one she’d had since the Battle.</p><p>Hermione didn’t want to keep on talking. She wanted to go back to the Hospital Wing and work until her fingers bled, but she couldn’t stop staring at him, at the way his shoulders relaxed as he looked outside. There was nothing to look at. The Quidditch pitch had been destroyed, burned to ashes. She wanted to scream at him because she wanted him to know how utterly disgusting, he had been all these past years.</p><p>Yet all she could think of was how much Draco was feeling at the moment whereas she felt empty in the inside.</p><p>“How do you cope? With al the guilt” she murmured, then.</p><p>“I don’t” he replied, looking straight at her. His grey eyes were shining with danger, but she found herself captivated by them. Maybe Malfoy really deserved to die in Azkaban. But, again, so did she. “How do you cope with all the crap you are feeling?”</p><p>“I’ve found myself not feeling anything at all. Sadness, maybe. Nothing more”</p><p>“You’re a fucking liar, Granger. I thought we were telling each other the truth”</p><p>“Don’t get into my head” she groaned, closing her eyes. She wanted to run, she wanted to escape and not talk to anyone in her entire life.</p><p>“You feel guilty for being a good person, don’t you? Being good hasn’t brought you anything but problems. You love too much and you expected it would be recompensed in the end”</p><p>“Has anyone ever told you you’re infuriating?”</p><p>“To your information, being a bad person doesn’t bring me any satisfaction, either. So, perhaps, we are all doomed since we are born, us humans”</p><p>“Never took you for a philosopher, Malfoy” she replied, bitterly. He shrugged and she hated him, hated him for being right. He opened his mouth again, but she was faster. “Stop talking. I’m not opening my heart to you of all people”</p><p>He smirked, again, and she wanted to punch that smile away from that stupidly attractive face. Was it the lack of sleep that made her feel so calm around him? She was crazy, she was becoming a lunatic.</p><p>“Go, then.” He urged her, narrowing his eyes.  Hermione felt her heart against her chest, beating faster than ever. She hugged herself and let the blanket fall onto the floor.</p><p>But she didn’t move, and neither did he.</p><p>She studied him; in a way she hadn’t let herself look at him before. He had broad shoulders and a skin as light as porcelain, now full of cuts and bruises. His nose was pointed and seemed to have been broken and repaired, she noticed.</p><p>“I kind of have a feeling I’m been observed. I don’t like it, Granger” he said, then, and she turned her head, her cheeks burning.</p><p>“Prick”</p><p>“Good to know nothing has changed” he replied, amused, and she was so, so done with him and his sarcasm and his presence.</p><p>“Will you please fuck yourself? You just stand here, complaining about how much of a shit person you’ve been your whole life, expecting me to... what? What do you expect from me?”</p><p>He shrugged again, and sighed. Hermione bit her lower lip, waiting for an answer that didn’t seem to appear. What did <em>she </em>expect from him?</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>Draco thought about it. What did he expect, establishing that conversation? It felt nice, it felt bloody nice to finally talk with someone who didn’t believe in him having changed. It felt good to know she didn’t want to have anything to do with him. At least he felt calm. Calmer than ever.</p><p>But it still stung, the fact that she seemed so broken and no one seemed to notice it, no one but him. He wanted her to get all of her fury out of her system so that she could be the best person in the room again, full of life and forgiveness and hope.</p><p>Everything would be chaotic if Hermione Granger lost hope.</p><p>“I expected you not to lie” he answered, slowly. He saw a light in her big brown eyes. Was it anger? Was it amusement?</p><p>“I expected an apology” she snarled, then, and he was shocked to hear it. Her voice was low, full of cold fury. “I don’t know. I expected you to fight for forgiveness, not giving up so easily. You’re the only fucking person here who has a chance to be pardoned and here you are, feeling sorry for yourself and hoping you rot in hell” she continued.</p><p>He knew she was right. But it still hurt to hear it from someone else.</p><p>“I don’t want your fucking disappointment, Granger” he roared, but she kept talking. Always talking, that witch. She didn’t seem to ever shut up.</p><p>“Well, I didn’t want your bloody insults during six years at this school and I still got them, you know? I fought to be here, to be accepted and you ruined every good moment by calling me a filthy mudblood. Guess what,” she added. “life is hard, for everyone!”</p><p>“You seem to be way over those moments, Granger. You broke my nose, remember?”. He wasn’t there to argue about some bullying. He knew who he was, he had more important stuff to be sorry for. “If you want to be mad at me for something, you’d better choose a good one from the list”</p><p>“What the fuck are you talking about, Malfoy? I can be mad for whatever I want. I’m not even mad anymore, you know”. No, he wanted to tell her. That wasn’t the point. She had to be angry.</p><p>“There’s so much to choose. Oh, I let my crazy aunt torture you for hours and then let you rot in my dungeons. I tried to kill Dumbledore and I fucking let Death Eaters in Howgarts. That was a good one, to be fair” he snarled. She was breathing heavily. <em>That’s it, Granger. Give me some of that rage. </em></p><p>“Why are you doing this?” she murmured.</p><p>“I tortured twenty-three people the same way you were tortured. And let me tell you, it wasn’t fun. I still did it. You should have brought a pen, to write them down. I’m sure Potter will change his mind after this”</p><p>And then she got up and he thought she was going to leave, but she only got closer to him. He realized then how much smaller she was, almost two heads smaller than him. All hair and dark eyes and long lashes.</p><p>“You’re an asshole. You want everyone to hate you? That’s fine with me”</p><p>“The same way you want to be punished by your actions, Granger”</p><p>“I don’t need to be punished. I was on the good side, have you forgotten? I fucking won the War. I am a hero”</p><p>He laughed then, and she punched him hard in the chest. Her hands were tiny and pale, bitten nails. He shouldn’t be paying so much attention to those little details.</p><p>“Oh, sorry, that’s right. You’re a <em>bloody </em>war hero. But we both know you don’t feel like one. You feel guilty and you shouldn’t be, right?”</p><p>“Stop! Stop trying to figure out how I think, for God’s sake. It drives me mad. And get off me!”. But he couldn’t stop walking towards her, cornering her against the wall. He put both hands on either side of her head and looked down.</p><p>“Just tell me, Granger. You feel lost, don’t you?”. He knew he was right. It was not that hard to read her. They weren’t so different, after all. She was trying to be punished for all the bad stuff she had done but no one could see, and he wanted to tell everyone nothing he had done was good, no matter how hard they tried to convince him otherwise.</p><p>“STOP!”</p><p>“Come on, tell me. Tell me I’m the worst. But you can’t, can you?” he continued. She looked at him and there was something else in her eyes. “I am the only one who’s figured you by now, haven’t I? Not Potter, not even the Weasel”</p><p>“Don’t call him that” she interrupted, but she didn’t deny it. He smiled, then, and got even closer to her. He noticed she hadn’t lowered her head. She was afraid of herself, that’s for sure, but she wasn’t afraid of him. She should. Everyone should.</p><p>“You wish you could say it out loud, don’t you? That you feel like shit, that you feel guilty because you don’t want to be happy. Not after how much you’ve sacrificed and how much you’ve put up with. You expected relief after the war. You expected to feel whole again” he continued; his voice rasped against his tongue. She bit her lip again and he arched an eyebrow.</p><p>“But” he continued, merciless. “The War is over. And Miss Granger still feels guilty”</p><p>“You have no right to do this” she answered, pushing him hard. He danced on his tiptoes not to lose the balance and she breathed heavily, tying her hair in a low bun. “You have no fucking right to come here and <em>force </em>me to face my feelings, not when it is you who’s going to be tried”</p><p>She began then to shout as many insults as she knew, but Draco had long ago disconnected. There was something wrong. All of the sudden, all his skin was itchy and he felt a shiver down his spine. There were clouds surrounding the castle, all of a sudden. It had been long since he’d seen those clouds. A week, to be exact.</p><p>It was an odd feeling, something he thought he’d never have to face again. That electricity through his whole body, lighting it up from the inside. He shook his head. It was fucking impossible, he kept repeating in his head.</p><p>And then, the whole tower trembled.</p><p>“And” Granger kept screaming, “don’t you ever think you are better than me, because, you know what! You know what, Malfoy?! You’re a bloody snake and you just fucked with my mind! Like you have always done! You rat!”</p><p>“Granger” he murmured. It had become impossible to breathe now; the air was heavy in his lungs. He felt himself drowning. She didn’t listen.</p><p>“Why don’t you open a fucking psychology consult, you moron? You don’t know me! You and I hate each other and I really should have left as soon as I saw you!”</p><p>“Will you please shut the fuck up?!”. She opened her eyes, her mouth forming a perfect “O”. she frowned, then, waiting for an explanation. How could he explain it to her? It was something you either felt or you didn’t.</p><p>“What’s bitten you?” she asked then. She hadn’t felt a thing. But it was unmistakably close, now. He didn’t think twice and took her hand, pulling her into an embrace, waiting for it to break.</p><p>“MALFOY!” she muffled against his shoulder.</p><p>But he held her tight against him, his wand already in hand. He murmured a protecting spell and waited.</p><p>One.</p><p>Two.</p><p>Three.</p><p>
  <em>BOOM!!!!</em>
