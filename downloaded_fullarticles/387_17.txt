          <div class="userstuff"><hr/><p>The angry, hurtful words rang like a particularly loud bell in Harry’s head. The row had been spectacular. He’d confronted Ginny with her infidelity and she had exploded. Screamed that he had basically <em> abandoned </em> her, not paid attention to her <em> needs </em>. So what was she supposed to do? </p><p>He had of course screamed back, that she could have just broken up with him like a <em> normal person </em> instead of staying, telling him everything was fine when he asked, when he knew it wasn’t. Instead of cheating, of sleeping with any man she crossed. </p><p>She had of course not denied it only snorting derisively and telling Harry <em> again </em> that he hadn’t been attentive to her needs, that he was always <em> “depressed and moody and had no interest” </em> in her. He didn't know what to say to that. He <em> had </em> been depressed and moody. And not really interested in <em> anything, </em>sex or his relationship with his supposed girlfriend. He’d finally gone to see a Mind Healer on her insistence. She’d even gone to his first session with him. What did she expect exactly? An overnight turnaround?</p><p>When he had said as much to her it had of course pissed her off more. Profanity and insults and accusations were hurled at him like the Quaffle in a quidditch match. Harry had just turned and gone upstairs to their room, gathered all of his belongings and left.  </p><p>Now, hours later he’s laying on a bed in a cheap, rundown muggle hotel with his scattered belongings, shattered heart, and a bottle of cheap whiskey for company. He’s watching the rain fall against the window and pretends that tears aren’t falling from his eyes. Pretends that his heart hasn’t broken beyond repair. That his whole world hasn’t crashed down around him. He pretends that he’s fine. </p><p>And he wonders, not for the first time, if she actually loved him or if it was just the idea of him, the mythical hero who had defeated a dark wizard twice. Lifting the bottle to his lips, taking a large swallow, he figures it doesn’t really matter. His dream of that peaceful, wonderful life after the war is gone. Crumbled into ash and dust and swept away on a bitter wind. He takes another swallow of whiskey and pretends some more that he isn’t crying and that he’s fine. Everything is fine. After all, he’s Harry bloody Potter, he has to be fine, even when he’s not.</p></div>
