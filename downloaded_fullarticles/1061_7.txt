          <div class="userstuff"><p>As the train sped through the country, a young boy with sandy blonde hair practically drank in all the unique sights. He was reluctant to move from his spot, not for anything. </p>
<p>"Nerd." some other boys muttered as they passed him by</p>
<p>They didn't linger long enough to notice a hurt expression on his face, or the fact that his fists clenched and unclenched in rapid succession. </p>
<p>But someone did. It was a girl with pigtails wrapped around her head.</p>
<p>"Mind if I sat here?" she asked</p>
<p>"Of course not." he assured her, albeit without looking at her</p>
<p>"So what is your name?" she asked, in an effort to break the ice</p>
<p>She watched as his fists clenched again.</p>
<p>"I am sorry." she apologized "I --....."</p>
<p>"It's all right." he interrupted her "I am just not used to this kind of thing. My name is Bartemius, and my dad and I share the same name."</p>
<p>"That's quite a mouthful." the girl giggled "My name is Pandora. I'll call you Barty."</p>
<p>"Welcome to the weird name club." he grinned "And Barty is nice. I like Barty."</p>
<p>And it was at that moment that both Barty and Pandora found their first real friend.</p></div>
