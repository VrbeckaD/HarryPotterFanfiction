    <p>Hadrien Potter sat opposite Sirius Black, the man that was once his godfather, but in this new world, was his friend and godfather to a very young Harry Potter. A Harry Potter who was sound asleep in Hadrien’s arms.</p><p>“Alright, Hadrien, explain.” Remus Lupin sat beside Sirius on an old but sturdy settee.</p><p>Hadrien took a deep breath.</p><p>“You need to let me finish, once I start. Please?” He asked.</p><p>“Why do I not like the sounds of that?” Sirius grimaced.</p><p>“Because you won’t.” Ronson, Hadrien's younger brother warned.</p><p>“I really don’t like the sounds of this.” Sirius looked at Remus and screwed his face up.</p><p>“Hush, Siri. Let Hadrien speak.” Remus turned from Sirius to Hadrien. “We didn’t know about you two. James never said anything.”</p><p>“Yeah… there’s a reason for that.” Hadrien winced. “Let me tell the entire story and then we’ll talk. Please?”</p><p>Remus and Sirius shared a long complicated wordless conversation, before Sirius sighed.</p><p>“Begin.” He waved a hand.</p><p> </p><p> </p>
