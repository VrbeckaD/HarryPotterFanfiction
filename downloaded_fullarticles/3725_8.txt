    <p>Hermione POV<br/>
I was practically vibrating with excitement, I'm here, I'm really here was on a loop in my head. I couldn't believe it! The castle was beautiful, the architecture flawless. Well, mostly flawless. I, personally, would of used dark wood for the support beams, and replaced the dusty tapestries. They should really take better care of the place. The wear and tear of the school obvious if you looked.</p><p>The knowledge here could change the world, get rid of disease, of hunger. My mind began thinking of plans for the next few year's. What spell should I learn first? How could I help the world? Then, a cold thought made it's way to the front of my mind. </p><p>If they could change the world and potentially save all humans from a bad fate, why haven't they already?</p><p>The thought stopped me dead. They don't care, I realized. They never did, about humans. Or what did they call them, muggles.</p><p>They would rather leave them to die, in coldness, hunger, war, and they didn't give a damn. If they didn't care about my fate, my family's fate, why should I care about what they thought of me.</p><p>"Hermione Granger!"</p><p>As I walked to the stage with a newfound determination I knew what house I would be in and I was proud. </p><p>I knew they would all regret underestimating me because of my parents. I would make them regret it.</p><p>"Slytherin!"</p><p> </p><p>Harry POV<br/>
I was nervous. I grew up nervous, always anxious of my uncle's fists and my aunt's words. Always tense from the bully's at school. And frankly, I wanted to be free of his life of cowardess, of relying on other people. At Hogwarts I felt like I could start over.</p><p>As I waited in line trying not to figet with my robes or tap my foot, uncle Vernon installed into my mind with a slap everytime I embarrassed myself in front of a coworker. First impressions, he would say, never ruin first impressions. </p><p>I saw the dark girl named Hermione and pretty boy named Draco get sorted into Slytherin, they looked content. Free. And I wanted so badly to be free.</p><p>When my name was called I felt another burst of stomach twisting fear. What if I wasnt good enough? What if I was here by mistake? When I sat down though, the sorting hat knew my name. And asked, in the non-voice, a question: Harry Potter, the boy who lived, what do you want to be? </p><p>I didn't have to think about it. It was the thing I wanted to be my whole life. Never knowing the feeling and it seemed so out of reach then. This might be my only chance to be... Free.</p><p>Ah, said the sorting hat, you will only achive the freedom you want in Slytherin, but, the hat warned, you may get caught up in it. You must be careful my boy. </p><p>And with that he announced for the hall. "Slytherin,"</p><p> </p><p>Ronald POV<br/>
I saw my brothers wave from across the room, so happy. No one even thought to ask if I was. And I wasnt, in the slightest. I confessed once maybe twice to my family about my condition. The days of darkness, of loneliness. And they didn't do a thing, granted they could of sent me of to St. Mungos home for wizarding illness. It was an illness. It seeped into my brain like poison and no one could tell.</p><p>I am mad, Percy straight up said I would be better locked up and I believed him. The Weaslys weren't rich, they weren't powerful or important. They were merely there, quite like myself. </p><p>So, when my name was called I resented my heretige. I didn't want to be apart of this family, I wanted to be free of my famiies shadow. The shadow of disappointment, of never being good enough. </p><p>The hat read my thoughts, only whispered, 'are you sure?' it knew the awnser.</p><p>"Slytherin!"</p><p>The gasp in the room made me smile for the first time that day.</p>
