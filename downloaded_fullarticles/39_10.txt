  <span>Draco entered the Great Hall, with swagger to envy and a strut that comes from privilege alone. The only tell-tale signs of his activities was a mild flush behind his ears. He glanced at the Gryffindor table in disdain and tuned out Pansy’s and Blaise’s incessant bickering. Merlin, these two should be locked into a broom closet and be set free only when they resolve the sexual tension between them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Suddenly Pansy glanced at Draco and gasped in horror. Draco looks down and pales. Shining merrily against his rumpled but hastily smoothened out shirt was a gold and crimson tie, sitting there in all its Gryffindor glory. This was not how he planned to reveal himself. He hazarded a glance at the rival house’s table again, where his boyfriend sat oblivious. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Draco sighed. He stood up and drew himself to his fullest height. “Attention students and professors of  Hogwarts! I especially address the fangirls and groupies present in the Hall.” Summoning every ounce of courage inside him, Draco walked towards the Gryffindor Table, watching his boyfriend’s wary and confused expression. Merlin’s balls, he had to do everything in this relationship. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He pulled Harry by his Slytherin tie, hauled him out of his seat and kissed him full on the mouth. “MINE!”, he growled. The Great Hall had never been more silent. Ron was choking on his food, Hermione gave Harry a knowing smirk, Pansy fainted in Blaise’s lap, Professor McGonagall and Professor Snape shared an exasperated look and the fangirls looked as if they were going to burst into tears at any moment.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The silence was broken by Dumbledore who shouted, “100 points to Gryffindor and Slytherin for inter house unity!” Dumbledore winked at Draco, his eyes twinkling mischievously.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As for Harry, he looked at Draco with awe, amusement and something else as he kissed Draco back with even more fervour. They grinned as they broke apart, panting and touched their foreheads together as they inhaled each other’s scent. Around them the Hall broke into pandemonium. </span>
