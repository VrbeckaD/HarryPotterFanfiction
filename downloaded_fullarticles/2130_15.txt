    <p>Alarmed, Harry was rudely awakened by the sound of thunderous rapping at his door, by none other than his Aunt Petunia.</p><p>“Get up! Get up you little brat! We are waiting for breakfast!” She shrieked as Harry rose into a sitting position, gently scrubbing the sleep from his eyes.</p><p>Harry struggled to adjust to the surrounding darkness of his cupboard as he fumbled around for his glasses, just managing to find them before falling out of the cupboard and crashing onto the hard wood floor in a disgruntled heap.</p><p>Sighing and forcing himself up, Harry entered the kitchen to find his cousin, Dudley, parading around like a rampaging elephant, whilst Harry was dragged into the kitchen and instructed to prepare breakfast.</p><p>“Vernon wants eggs and bacon and our lovely Dudder’s wants pancakes, don’t you pumpkin?” Petunia said, sickeningly sweetly as she squeezed Dudley’s chubby cheek affectionately between her thumb and forefinger.</p><p>Harry just stood stoically, staring in disbelief before being swatted upside the head and having a frying pan forced into his outstretched arms.</p><p>“Yes, Aunt Petunia” Harry replied, silently hoping that, one day, he would manage to wipe the smug expression off of the horse-faced cow.</p><p>As though he had been set to auto-pilot, Harry set to work on Dudley’s breakfast first, not wanting to risk getting punished for not presenting ‘Prince Dudley’ with his breakfast in two minutes flat. Being especially careful not to burn them, Harry delicately transferred the perfectly assembled pancakes to a plate and presented them to Dudley. The whale of a boy scrutinising the proffered pancakes before finally deciding that they were edible, and shovelling them down his thick neck.</p><p>“Where on earth is my breakfast, boy?!” Uncle Vernon bellowed, startling Harry and almost causing him to drop the piece of bacon he was currently turning.</p><p>“It’s coming, Sir” Harry responded through gritted teeth as the toaster popped.</p><p>Gently placing two pieces of buttered toast on the dining room table in front of his Uncle, Harry hastily returned to the kitchen for the remaining eggs and bacon. He was methodically placing the contents of the frying pan atop of Vernon’s toast when Dudley barged past him in a desperate attempt to grab the chocolate spread, which was sitting in the centre of the table. Harry’s significantly small stature caused him to stumble a few steps and, as if it were happening in slow motion, spill the remaining oil all over his left hand before sending the frying pan crashing to the floor.</p><p>As Harry frantically scrambled to pick up the cookware, he was backhanded across his face by his Uncle. “Stupid boy!” Vernon exclaimed, seething with anger.</p><p>He then noticed Vernon’s face, round and red as a tomato, was inches from Harry’s own and his uncle lunged and grabbed Harry by the scruff of the neck, dragging him out into the hallway before forcefully throwing him into his cupboard under the stairs. Harry’s head smacked against the base of the stairs as he did so, the impact causing sunspots to dance across his vision.</p><p>“Your foolishness has cost you a day in the cupboard, Freak!” Vernon spat before turning to glare at his wife. “Well, stop gaping at me like a goldfish and get in the car, Petunia! We don’t want to be late to meet my sister or we will all get a bashing!”</p><p>Petunia sheepishly trotted out of the front door and into the Dursley’s silver Ford Focus, closely followed by Dudley, before Vernon slammed the door so aggressively that the family portraits on the wall, none of which included Harry, shook precariously. Harry gave an exasperated sigh. He was finally alone.</p><p>————————————————————————————————————————</p><p>After sitting and staring into the darkness for a few moments, Harry hesitantly prodded the back of his head and wasn’t at all surprised to feel the tackiness of blood that was now matted in his untamed hair. Letting out a heavy sigh, he turned his attention to the broken soldier figures that littered the single slanted shelf in his cupboard. Harry frequently fiddled with them when he was stuck in his cupboard, yet today, they served a different purpose. Choosing one soldier, which brandished a particularly sharp miniature sword, Harry began to fiddle with the lock, twisting the sword just so until he heard that familiar click. Harry suffered through years of failed attempts before he eventually managed to devise a way of escaping the confinement of his cupboard, which happened to be when the Dursley’s took a day trip to the zoo, no more than a year ago. Ever since then, the mere thought of being able to escape if need be, was reassuring enough for Harry to be able to tolerate his time in the compact space</p><p>Out of habit, Harry crept silently out of his cupboard, tentatively looking over his shoulder as if expecting to see his uncle to be looming behind him. He then quietly proceeded to the kitchen, where the destruction from breakfast still remained. Carefully, Harry opened the fridge door with his sleeve, ensuring that he didn’t leave any fingerprints, which he was sure wouldn’t go unnoticed by his aunt, and perused the fridge for something to eat. The fridge was stockpiled with an array of tempting treats, including chocolate bars, pastries and desserts. However, Harry knew better than to indulge in these items, knowing that their disappearance would immediately be noticed by Dudley, who kept a sharp eye on all of his confectionary items.</p><p>After living with the Dursley’s for so long, Harry noticed that the fruit in the bottom of the fridge often went untouched until the weekly bin collection, when he would see his aunt disgustedly throwing the mouldy fruit into a black sack. He could save the Dursley’s a fortune if they would just let him eat it, Harry mused before reaching for a dark, crimson apple from the bottom of the fridge, deciding that it was the safest thing to take, as the fact that it was missing would likely go unnoticed. Harry then had the first opportunity to inspect his severely burnt hand, the skin sporting an angry red colour and large boils already starting to develop. Again, using his sleeve, Harry decided to grab a bag of frozen peas from the freezer, resting them against his hand for a few moments, in a fruitless attempt to reduce the swelling and the constant burning sensation.</p><p>Once Harry had returned the bag of peas to their rightful place in the freezer, he crept up the creaking staircase to explore the rooms that he was never normally allowed to enter. He made his way over to his cousin Dudley’s room first and acknowledged just how much of a state the room was in. The walls were painted a garishly bright red and were adorned with several posters of his favourite football team, Manchester United. As for the floor, Harry couldn’t see it. Nearly every square inch of it was covered with clothing and he dreaded to think what might be lurking underneath the paraphernalia. Dudley’s bed, unsurprisingly, was still unmade, his curtains drawn and his bedside table littered with sweet wrappers. Harry thought it would be best to view Dudley’s room from afar, not venturing any further, as he was likely to fall over the mass of clothes strewn on the floor and never be seen again. He certainly endeavoured to avoid another beating from his uncle if he could help it.</p><p>Harry then began to make his way to his Aunt and Uncle’s room, whilst thinking about how tidy and well organised his bedroom would be if he had one. Taking in the room, Harry was surprised to discover that it was reasonably plain and sparse, unlike his aunt and uncle’s colourful personalities. Walking past the couples wardrobe, he jumped out of his skin when he saw himself reflected in the mirror. Harry chuckled and berated himself for being so skittish, yet, he just didn’t recognise the person staring back at him. Despite being relatively short, Harry was incredibly thin, his black hair tangled and out of control. He had dark circles under his sunken, emerald green eyes which luckily were somewhat covered by his large, round spectacles. The Dursley’s were not at all pleased at being forced into buying him glasses when he kept walking into the walls whilst doing the house work. However, he suspected they were just a generic pair as he still couldn’t see a thing out of them. His trousers were constantly falling down, seeing as they were a pair of Dudley’s cast-offs, and his shirt swamped him so much that the hem fell down below his knees.</p><p>Turning his nose up at his appearance, Harry spun around and made to exit the room when he noticed a collection of dusty boxes sitting under the bed. Harry was intrigued and, giving in to his curiosity, he dropped to his knees and proceeded to pull out some of the mysterious crates. Each one was conveniently labelled with titles such as ‘Dudley’s baby clothes’, ‘Wedding photos’ and ‘Florida Holiday 1985’. The last heading causing Harry to inwardly shudder as he remembered the week he had spent with his neighbour, Mrs Figg, and her felines instead of basking in the Florida sunshine. He couldn’t really complain though, Mrs Figg had always been kind to him whenever he had stayed with her, at least he got fed properly and had a warm bed to sink into at the end of the day. Thanking his aunt and her organisation skills, the clear labelling saved Harry the unnecessary trouble of digging through each box individually. Then, just as Harry was going to push the boxes back underneath the bed, he couldn’t help but notice a small, unassuming shoebox lurking behind all the others. Harry was interested to see what was inside and, struggling, dragged the shoe box out. The lid was absolutely caked in dust, so much so that Harry had to use the sleeve of his oversized shirt to uncover what was scribbled across the top. A lump appeared in Harry’s throat as he read the title: ‘Lily’s Things’.</p>
