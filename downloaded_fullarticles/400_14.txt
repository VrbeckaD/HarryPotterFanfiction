    <p>The first time someone's sleep made a difference, Remus was the one who slept. Sirius and James had been expelled from the cabin where they were with Lily Evans and Severus Snape, they both had to admit it was better that way, and when they were looking for a place to sit James saw through the glass window in the door of an almost empty cabin, a boy sleeping , had dark blond hair that spread over her head against the window, a book in her lap denounced that it was not an intentional sleep. By Sirius they would find another place, some with someone else nice, maybe older and less nerdy, but he wanted to be with James, he was nice and funny and the kind of person that Sirius could only have now, on the train, in the transition of a child pure blood for a young Slytherin, so they entered.</p><p>- Excuse me - James nudged the boy's shoulder, who soon woke up.</p><p>- Hum. Hello - greeted sleepily - need something?</p><p>- Actually yes, can we sit here?</p><p>- Sure - he yawned - feel free</p><p>- Thanks. My name is James, by the way.</p><p>- Remus, Remus Lupin. - he said, blushing when he realized his lack of respect.</p><p>- And I'm Sirius.</p><p>Soon they had started a conversation that would go on for hours and laughter, which distracted the sleepy (and sincerely aching) Remus. And he was happy to sleep surprising (unintentionally) the others who wanted to sit there, he wished with all his strength that he could go to the same dormitory as the boys, that his secret would give him time off, that he could be friends with those two crazy troublemakers, and thanked (only in his mind) James Potter for not letting him sleep in the morning after the full moon.</p><p>- passagem de tempo :) -</p><p>With Pedro it was so simple with everyone that they didn't even notice the difference when the boy sat with them at the first day's cafe, or when, months later, they were sleeping in the infirmary for helping their little friend, but it was also the sleep's fault . The three others lingered in the common room, talking happily and laughing, knowing each other even if for a few minutes, they did not go up with the others, when they arrived at the top of the stairs Frank was getting ready to sleep, and Pedro was lying, in his clothes and everything, in his bed, slept like stone. The three burst out laughing, laughed at being finished, until the boy woke up. Then they became friends, as an apology for the incessant laughter, and soon the accustomed presence of the sleeper was like a joke that never lost the grace to call him that. Before long they all cared for each other, loving themselves madly in that naughty way, and Pedro also loved them and wanted the good of those who welcomed him.<br/>But in the end things were always too superficial with Pedro Pettigrew.</p><p>-passagem de tempo-</p><p>Still in the first week of classes, Sirius had a nightmare, he woke up screaming for right after cursing himself softly for waking up his dorm mates, Pedro soon went back to sleep after verifying that he was fine, he hadn't been hurt or needed help, but it was Pedro after all. Remus and James were not so easy to get around, even if it was just a nightmare, something common in the lives of the Blacks if there was total honesty. But Sirius was crying after all, it couldn't be that simple, they couldn't take it as simple.<br/>Difficult as they were, they slept with Sirius, James by his side and Remus lying at their feet, like a dog, something that did not go unnoticed by Black's teary eyes, which soon made a joke. And that was what James saw in him, that was what made them close, something that was only realized when there was no turning back, James loved Sirius because even though he was fragile, scared, he made a joke, like James in a way, but better . Sirius was James's way of keeping himself happy and whole, as if keeping someone strong around him was also strong, and he kind of was. From that moment on, no one (except perhaps Remus) would know where James started and ended Sirius, nor where Sirius started and ended James. They came together in one embrace.</p><p>And Walburga Black finally did something for the son.</p><p>-passagem de tempo-</p><p>For Remus, the nightmares didn't arrive until the following month, but the full moon was just like that, a big nightmare, since the crescent moon. The friends have already questioned the scars, and Remus wanted to die when he told the half truth of the wolf attack, even though he didn't blame others for curiosity, after all, he was the only one who only changed clothes in the bathroom, who woke up early to bathe alone, which never wore short sleeves even when it was hot, but it hurt to tell him those things.</p><p>He knew he would cry even though he hadn't been crying before (which he was) when Sirius hugged him, after gently shaking him out of his nightmare. Sirius took him to wash his face, even though he was still crying and trembling, when he returned James was sitting on his pillow holding a glass of water he had just taken from the hand of Frank who smiled at them and went to bed without for not a single second to question anything. James managed to convince Remus to drink all the water, so that soon afterwards he lay him on his legs together with Sirius who as soon as he lay down embraced him. Nobody said anything, neither that time nor any of the others, but James, who was looking at that tangle of people that their embrace will become, noticed that if he wanted to be Sirius' friend he would also have to be Remus, because nothing or no one would stop Sirius Black from passing the crescent moons tangled with Remus Lupine.</p><p>And even if he still found the full moon a nightmare Remus knew he would never again think of the crescent moons in a different way than a restless dream with wolves and hugs</p><p>-passagem de tempo-</p><p>When James went to sleep, things were difficult. The marauders were already finishing the first year, it was the penultimate day before the holidays and the last day of the tests, in celebration the four together with Frank Longbottom stayed in the dormitory at dawn, eating sweets and playing, chatting all night about the holidays that came. But mostly eating, Remus, who was passionate about chocolate, had several bars to eat, and Frank will receive sweets from his mother, who still won't eat in the hustle and bustle of evidence, and in the middle of those sweets there was a single cinnamon candy. Nobody would eat it if they knew it was cinnamon, but they didn't know it, it was packed in a transparent paper, as if it came from a bigger bag destined for someone other than Frank, but ended up there, gooey, hard, strange among the sweet wizards .</p><p>- What a weird bullet - Pedro commented</p><p>- Who's going to eat? asked Sirius, looking at the bullet between Pedro's fingers.</p><p>- Whoever loses. - James gave the idea himself.</p><p>- What game? - James at the time gave the idea of a chess competition, but in the end nobody would remember, neither the stupid competition nor the game.</p><p>James lost, and ate the cinnamon candy.</p><p>James was allergic to cinnamon.</p><p>Nobody knew for sure how they got organized, but soon Frank was asking for help from people in the common room, Sirius shouting and knocking on all the doors of the men's dormitories and Remus rummaging through the bathroom looking for any potions he thought would help. And James, well, James was suffocating while Pedro held him, trying to somehow make him disengage. Thank goodness they had anti-allergic potion, not much, but enough for James to take a breath on the way to the hospital wing. As soon as they got someone to carry James, they left Frank with Pedro in the dormitory to clean up the mess, with the promise of news, and ran, on the way they knocked over a teacher and stepped on Madame Norra, but neither they nor Arthur Weasley, monitor who carried James, mattered.</p><p>Madam Pomfrey thanked the heavens that they had arrived in time, she soon managed to give James enough anti-allergic potion to breathe and the stomach potion to pass and make him vomit the bullet. James had passed out somewhere between the dorm and the hospital wing, but the healer was sure he would be fine. So much so that when the two friends of the boy who came with him begged to stay there she left, but locked the wing so that they would not leave in the middle of the night. Arthur left before that, promising to warn all Gryffindors frightened by the rush that everything was fine, and tell Pedro about the wings and stop him from getting into trouble trying to come to James.</p><p>When James woke up the first thing he heard was Remus reading, the first thing he felt was Remus' hands in his hair and Sirius's in his, when he opened his eyes the first thing he saw was that he was in the hospital wing and that there were dragged the bed beside him until he touched his nightstand, Sirius slept in it, all crooked and curled up in his crooked pajamas, while holding his hand, but he didn't see Remus. It took him a second of confusion before looking up and seeing him, he did not sleep with his head on the pillow, but on Remus' lap, who despite his dark circles did not sleep, concentrating on reading the children's tale from a book he will find there.</p><p>- Remy. - he called out weakly, his throat hurt.</p><p>- Hi - said the other sweetly, lowering the book</p><p>They talked for a while and soon James fell asleep, being thrown back into a peaceful sleep by the silent voice of his friend, who calmly explained what will happen. The next day when he asked Remus why he read, he received an answer:</p><p>- Madame said that you could wake up, and that maybe you were in pain or couldn't remember yesterday, and I didn't want you to wake up and feel lonely or confused. But I knew I would sleep, so I decided to read it, it helps me stay awake most of the time.</p><p>And since then James started to notice that Remus did several things that nobody would notice until they made a difference, hands on his shoulder, help that they didn't ask for, unreasonable smiles, reading to people sleeping, and depriving themselves of sleep or food so that no one would stay alone or confused. Remus was good at understanding people after all, James thought, remembering the desperation that was cut off from him when he heard the calm voice reading a bedtime story.</p><p>-passagem de tempo-</p><p>And all of that led to the current moment, Lílian Evans, now 17 years, who was going to make a Christmas surprise for her now boyfriend arriving at his house and to find him and his best friends sleeping together in the double bed, in a cake of members that made it difficult to find out which leg was whose. Lily laughed, James had always been like that after all, full of love and space in his heart.</p><p>And she just lay down next to him (his trunk at least) at the end of the bed without caring about the other boys. James's life actually took place at night, so she would let him sleep.</p>
