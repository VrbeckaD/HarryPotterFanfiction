    <p>It was a matter of circumstance that allowed Sally Jackson to take in the small dark-haired child that looked so much like her own son, part luck and part (in hindsight) divine intervention. Had her mother not kept the letters from her life in England and had she not inherited the small-town house they were kept in she would never have net her biological father and her half-sisters. She did not reach out to them at first, the loss of the parents to that aeroplane crash was too heavy in her heart and mind for her to do anything but go through the motions.</p>
<p>But Sally was nothing if not a curious woman and as the fog that had consumed her faded she found she wanted to meet the man who her Mum had apparently loved in her late teens. She couldn’t figure out how she was supposed contact him but once again the fates wove their magic and she was able to find a current address after months of letters and waiting. The rush of victory swelled in her chest as she booked a cruise all the way to the England, and the smile did not leave her face the whole trip.</p>
<p>Meeting the Evans family was a blur of stares, glares, tears and eventually a few bright smiles. Sally Jackson was welcomed into the Evans family as one of their own and despite the age difference she and a 16 year old Lily got along like two peas in a pod. They would share knowledge as well as gossip about their love lives and though there were always certain things they could not share with one another they had become inseparable. However, this closeness between them only seemed to distance Petunia from the family.</p>
<p>A year passed, and Sally had to return to the states, the exchange program she had been allowed into was up. So after teary farewells with the Evans family, minus one stiff Petunia off to the side, she was on another cruise ship back to the place she used to call home. Though they stayed in contact even through the death of Lily’s parents up until the birth of their sons. They were mere months apart the two had been exchanging excited letters about introducing the two cousins until Lily’s letters became fearful and eventually they stopped.</p>
<p>Then, after two years of silence and bitter sadness, there was a letter. Her little Lily had been murdered. Her son was to be sent into the care of her closest willing relative. That being, one Sally Jackson. She wasted no time in preparing her own son for a trip back to England, crossing the sea that was reflected in his bright eyes. She knew it would be a dangerous trip what with Percy’s blood being so strong, but she had a promise to keep to her sister.</p>
<p>Baby Harry was a sight that made her heart constrict he was so much like her Perseus yet so different, his eyes more like Lilly’s and his hair somehow already more untameable and that scar... She knew that she would protect this child with her life, just as she would for Percy. Speak of the devil, the two year old demigod was leaning forward in his seat, looking curiously at his cousin who was fast asleep in the arms of an old man. Dumbledore. His name was Albus Dumbledore, she had heard of him from Lily and knew she trusted the man with her life. Sally could see why. His presence was powerful. Not so much as Poseidon’s but more like Percy’s is and, surprisingly, Harry’s. </p>
<p> She wondered if there were gods alive in England too. </p>
