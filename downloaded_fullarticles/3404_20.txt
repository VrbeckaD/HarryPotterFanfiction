  <b>Prologue - Hello, Goodbye</b>
</p><p>
  <em> You say "Yes", I say "No". </em>
  <br/>
  <em> You say "Stop" and I say "Go, go, go". </em>
  <br/>
  <em> Oh no. </em>
  <br/>
  <em> You say "Goodbye" and I say "Hello.”</em>
</p><ul>
<li>“Hello, Goodbye”, the Beatles</li>
</ul><p><br/> </p><p>There were three things that Hermione Granger was sure of.</p><p> </p><p>First, kissing Ron had been a mistake. It was a heat of the moment thing. It had to be. Besides, Fred was her true love. Right? She had harbored a crush on him since she was fourteen. They were meant to be. At least, that’s how she felt. But now, Fred was dead, and she wasn’t quite sure anymore.</p><p> </p><p>Second, this war ended tonight. She knew that was going to happen, regardless who won. And from her vantage point, they were winning.</p><p> </p><p>Third, Bellatrix Lestrange had to die. The witch in front of her threw curse after curse in her direction, favoring her over Ginny. Which Hermione was okay with. As long as Ginny survived, she would be fine. Her main focus was on destroying the witch who destroyed her.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione and Ginny dueled against the Death Eater for what felt like hours. After Hermione sent a fairly nasty hex towards the witch - who dodged it - Bellatrix sent an unknown curse in her direction. Hermione tried to block it, but it went through her protection charm and hit her square in the chest. There was a sensation of pulling, and she turned to run. The last thing she remembered was hearing Ginny shout, <em> “Hermione!” </em> before she disappeared. The world around her twisted and turned until it returned to normal.</p><p> </p><p>Well, <em> relatively </em> normal.</p><p> </p><p>The Entry Hall was empty, save for two students. <em> But where was everyone else, </em> she thought. It was incredibly late, and the two students were going to be in detention if they got caught. She suddenly felt exhausted and nearly collapsed. The two students ran over to her, yelling something. The last thing she remembered before her world went black was hearing herself say one word, and a look of confusion on the two boys’ faces.</p><p> </p><p>“Harry?”</p>
