          <div class="userstuff"><p>There was a mad head called Dumbledore<br/>
Whose love of Christmas grew more and more<br/>
As a school Yule activity<br/>
Of a living nativity<br/>
Dumbles wanted to be the director.</p><p>Le directeur, er.</p><p>***</p><p>"My dear Mr Dobby, dear sir, dear Mr Elf,<br/>
Please do come down from the Gryffindor shelf,<br/>
Entertain the adoring audience,<br/>
Mr Harry Potter and all his friends,<br/>
Who will delight in and cheer Baby Jesus, yourself."</p><p>Smarmy, barmy.</p><p>***</p><p>"My dear Sybill, be a good girl,<br/>
And no more weak threats at me hurl,<br/>
As the show's star you will shine,<br/>
There'll be punch, eggnog and wine,<br/>
You're needed for the plot to unfurl."</p><p>Alcohol, skol.</p><p>***</p><p>"Mr Filch, buy some new underwear and a good suit<br/>
Gel your hair, shine first one, then t'other boot<br/>
Do bring Mrs Norris<br/>
She'll delight Dolores<br/>
You'll be looking handsome as a shepherd, and cute."</p><p>She's not here? Oh dear.</p><p>***</p><p>"Filius, my old colleague and friend,<br/>
Your exalted presence please lend,<br/>
I need you to lead,<br/>
By example and deed,<br/>
You'll be off duty on Hogsmeade weekend."</p><p>Peace and quiet instead of a riot</p><p>***</p><p>"Join the cast, dear, and stop causing tsoris<br/>
This nativity is good for student mores.<br/>
If not, you can kindle my funeral pyre,<br/>
Or worse, you'll make me retire,<br/>
Then you can welcome as my successor Dolores."</p><p>Umbridge in pink, the best threat I think.</p></div>
