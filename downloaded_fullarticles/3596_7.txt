  <em>The Ring has awakened. It is on a small world, a world of men. They would wield its power... But our ally knows its workings as they never will. He is ready to lead. And our forces, the armies of Mordor, will follow. The world will be his. This Middle-earth, yours. And men, what can they do, but burn?</em>

  <strong>SHIELD Helicopter 9S, en route to Joint Dark Energy Mission Facility, Mojave Desert, United States of America</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <b>December 4 | 12:52 AM</b>
</p>
<p>It was nearing an hour past midnight and Ana Amari was sitting near the window of the SHIELD helicopter, reading a long memo that was slipping through her brain without leaving the slightest trace of meaning behind. She was called to see what the trouble was with the Palantír, and between wondering when the wretched chopper would arrive, and trying to suppress unpleasant memories of what had been a very long, tiring, and difficult week, there was not much space in her head for anything else. The more she attempted to focus on the print on the page before her, the more the Wizard could feel weariness setting upon her.</p>
<p>She turned over the second page of the memo, saw how much longer it went on, and gave it up as a bad job. She turned to the rest of the cabin and she looked around at the other three sullenly. Ana was shorter in stature than the others; but her long white hair, her sweeping grey robes, and her broad shoulders, made her look like some wise queen of ancient legend. In her aged face under snowy brows her eyes were set like coals that could suddenly burst into fire. Leaning her staff against her shoulder and her sword, Glamdring, against the little space between her and the woman sitting on the opposite end of her, Ana shifted her gaze over to the window, looking out at the rushing thin mist that was pressing itself against the glass. It was then, as she sat with her back to the cabin, that she heard a soft cough behind her.</p>
<p>She turned to find three pairs of eyes all trained onto her left hand, placed on her knee, which bore a beautiful ruby set in a gold band; Narya was its name, the Ring of Fire, and Ana was its keeper. It shone a deep crimson, illuminating the helicopter cabin with a fiery red light, and all of them were entranced by it.</p>
<p>Ana rubbed her hands together and pulled the bring of her grey hat down further, till all anyone could see were peering fiery eyes in the shadow. Her hand traveled to her weathered lips as she whispered some foreign words, and her ring, Narya, vanished. Dropping them onto her knees, Ana slowly, thoughtfully, mentally isolated herself from her environment. She did to think and often to clear her head. The thoughts pervading her mind this time were of her past.</p>
<p>
  <strong> <em> All personnel, the evacuation order has been confirmed. Please proceed to your designated vehicles. This is not a drill. </em> </strong>
</p>
<p>Hearing the sirens and intercom voice, Ana peered out the window again and now saw the shimmering lights of the facility. Multiple lights were moving about frantically, with government vehicles and military equipment all growing in number as more and more were brought out and loaded into helicarriers.</p>
<p>Indeed, the Palantír had awoken. She needed to find out the damage and possible negative repercussions.</p>
<p>Moments later, the helicopter touched down meters from the main entrance onto a helipad. A stern, no-nonsense man in a sharp-looking suit stood motionlessly, with sunglasses masking his face. The door slid open and Ana’s right-hand agent, Maria Hill, jumped out first, followed by Ana who stepped out onto the black concrete. Large lights illuminated the area and she blinked to readjust. She recognized the man as Phillip Coulson, her right hand man in SHIELD. The rotors raised dust, and Ana held onto her wide-brimmed hat to keep it from flying away.</p>
<p>'How bad is it?' she said with a slightly raised voice.</p>
<p>Coulson took off his glasses. 'That’s the problem, ma’am!' he shouted over the noise. 'We don't know!'</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">/ / /</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ana and Agent Hill kept pace with Coulson, who led the two deeper into the facility. The running footsteps and worried shouts filled the air, and the hard tapping of Ana’s staff simply added to the noise.</p>
<p>“Dr. Selvig read an energy surge from the Palantír four hours ago,” said Coulson.</p>
<p>“If I recall NASA didn't authorize Selvig to test phase,” Ana retorted.</p>
<p>“He wasn't testing it; he wasn't even in the room,” Coulson answered as a technician stumbled into Ana. She shot him a pitiful glare as the terrified man ran. “Spontaneous advancement,”</p>
<p>“It just turned itself on?” Hill asked from the back.</p>
<p>Ana quickened her pace, her leather boots making no sound against the concrete floor. “What are the energy levels now?”</p>
<p>“Climbing. When Selvig couldn't shut it down, we ordered an evac.”</p>
<p>“How long to get everyone out?”</p>
<p>“Campus should be clear in the next half hour,” Coulson answered.</p>
<p>“Do better,” and Ana waved him away. He left, albeit reluctantly.</p>
<p>Ana and Hill continued down the stairs taking them deeper into the pits of the facility. A bad feeling was coursing through Ana’s veins. She never liked the idea of using the Palantír to harness its energy, but ever since Talon found it deep inside of a secret Soviet-era base in the Siberian frost-hell and got the attention of the United States government, and forged plans to weaponize its ridiculous power output, Ana had been on edge.</p>
<p>After a few moments, Agent Hill spoke. “Ma’am, evacuation may be futile.”</p>
<p>“We should tell them to go back to sleep?” Ana said angrily.</p>
<p>“If we can't control the Palantír's energy, there may not be a minimum safe distance.”</p>
<p>Ana grumbled under her breath. “I have seen these Seeing-stones, Maria, and this one is completely different from any other. All the others are communication tools, but this one… was simply not forged by Fëanor. Someone else did…” She turned to Hill. “I need you to make sure that Phase 2 prototypes are shipped out.”</p>
<p>“Ma’am, is that really a priority right now?” she exclaimed.</p>
<p>Ana stopped and turned to the agent, standing a few stairs above Hill.</p>
<p>“Until such time as the world ends, we will act as though it intends to spin on. Clear out the tech below. Every piece of Phase 2 on a truck and gone. Those weapons have the energy output of an atomic explosion, and if destroyed could cause such. Understood?”</p>
<p>“Yes, ma’am,” Hill answered begrudgingly. She turned to two other soldiers. “With me,” and the newly-formed trio marched away. Ana stood for a few moments before turning with a sweep of her robes and the thudding of her staff to the vacuum chamber, where the Palantír was being held.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">/ / /</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ana swept into the room, turning heads but for a moment before everyone returned to work, taking the hint from her stoic, yet pissed expression.</p>
<p>“Talk to me, doctor!”</p>
<p>Erik Selvig, the head scientist, emerged from behind the machine, a Compact Muon Solenoid coil, with a concerned expression. Ana threw a quick glance at the Palantír and it was glowing unusually brighter, with odd rings of cerulean shooting off it. <em> Strange </em>, Ana thought. Palantíri were typically dark-coloured, yet this one was a brilliant blue.</p>
<p>“Ana,” the doctor huffed.</p>
<p>“Is there anything we know for certain?” Ana asked as she approached the coil. Selvig joined her side.</p>
<p>“The Palantír is misbehaving.”</p>
<p>“Is that supposed to be funny?”</p>
<p>Selvig glanced at her. “No, it's not funny, at all. The Palantír is not only active, it's… misbehaving.”</p>
<p>“How soon until you pull the plug?” Ana asked as she looked around. Everyone was visibly shaken, and even the soldiers looked wary.</p>
<p>“It’s an energy source,” Selvig said. “If we turn off the power, it turns it back on. If it reaches peak level…”</p>
<p>“SHIELD is supposed to be prepared for this, doctor,” Ana said with an agitated tone. <em> Damn these people with their science projects! </em>“Harnessing energy from differing universes?”</p>
<p>Selvig frowned. “We don't have the harness. Our calculations are far from complete. Now it’s throwing off interference, radiation. Nothing harmful, low levels of gamma radiation.”</p>
<p>Ana furrowed her brow. “That can be harmful. Where's Frye?”</p>
<p>Selvig looked up from a datapad. “The other twin? Sneaking about, as usual.”</p>
<p>Ana looked up and saw a dark shape in the rafters. Jacob Frye, the other twin who worked with SHIELD, whereas his twin sister, Evie Frye, worked with Overwatch. A pair of eyes in two equally volatile environments to Ana.</p>
<p><em> Jacob, report</em>, she whispered. Not a moment to soon when he landed with a thud on the floor next to her. He swiftly stood at attention to Ana. She and Jacob walked around the massive room in a rather discreet manner.</p>
<p>“I gave you this detail so you could keep a close eye on things,” she said flatly.</p>
<p>“Well, I see better from a distance,” remarked Jacob.</p>
<p>“Are you seeing anything that might set this thing off?” Ana asked. They passed a scientist saying <em> Doctor, it’s spiking again </em> and Selvig running to her.</p>
<p>“No one’s come and gone. And Selvig’s clean. No contacts, no I.M.,” he said, crossing his arms and looking at the end of the platform wired to the C.M.S. device. “If there’s any tampering, Mithrandir, it wasn’t at this end.”</p>
<p>“At this end?”</p>
<p>“Don’t play a fool; you know more than I could ever hope to. This Palantír is a doorway to other dimensions, right?” he said, gripping his holstered gun. He turned to Ana. “And doors open from both sides.”</p>
<p>Then, as if on cue, the room started to tremble, and spread through the entire facility. Ana could sense it thundering in every single corner of the Earth itself. Pens, clipboards, and everything else that wasn't nailed down started to slide off the tables. The Palantír grew brighter, sparks and flares shooting off in even greater intensity as a deep hum echoed through the room. Time itself seemed to stand still.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a brilliant blue beam shot out towards the end platform. A deafening hum vibrated the chamber, and a massive blue portal formed before everyone’s eyes. It stayed for mere moments before the beam cut off and sent large flame-like walls towards Ana and all else. As everyone ducked in a futile effort to protect themselves, Ana raised a hand against it.</p>
<p>The blue waves passed through without harm yet the strong gust made her wide-brimmed hat fly off, and continued towards, and up the walls, until it clustered itself in a swirling cloud of dark and bright hues in the uppermost dome. Jacob, Selvig, and the others slowly lifted their heads and peered where the portal had been, while soldiers slowly approached it, their guns raised and their nerves shot. Ana slowly pointed her staff towards the dark figure in the shadows, small wisps of fiery smoke emanating from it, and a heavy breathing being the only sound.</p>
<p>Slowly, the figure rose and everyone seemed overcome with a chill. The figure, a man, was menacing in stature, from his black hair, to his deathly sallow skin. He was tall, yet fair in his complexion, and in his right hand he held a black scepter with a round blue gem settled between a large silver and smaller blade, covered in ancient runes in the Black Speech, and his left arm appeared to be ghostly, wraith-like in its form. An elegant set of armor adorned him, and a tattered cloak wrapped around him. Under his heavy hood Ana could see that he was a man of the Dúnedain, yet his orange-red eyes betrayed his allegiance as that to Mordor, and his lips were twisted into a thin line that betrayed no emotion. And Ana knew who he was, and a shadow of the past crept upon her mind.</p>
<p>Eridan, the Black Hand of Sauron.</p>
<p>“Sir, please put down the spear!”</p>
<p>Jacob’s voice shouted, and Eridan looked down for a brief moment at the scepter. His gaze returned to them, and in an instant raised the scepter and fired a brilliant azure beam towards Ana and the Frye twin. Ana merely absorbed it with a cast shield, although the force dispersion threw her and Jacob back. Ana heard gunfire go off, but she knew it was pointless. Beings of Arda, including her, could not be affected nor damaged by any weapons of Earth. She glanced over her shoulder to see the Black Hand leap from the platform in an impressive bound and incinerate two soldiers, and wraith-esque daggers flew from Eridan’s ghosted hand and dispatched two more with ease.</p>
<p>A few more blasts and all went silent. Sparks flew off damaged equipment, and the hum of the vacuum chamber starting to form above them seemed to drop an octave lower.</p>
<p>Jacob managed to stand up before Ana, but the moment he reached for his gun, Eridan’s ghostly hand grabbed Jacob’s.</p>
<p>“You have heart,” his evil voice pervading the room. A faint mist traveled through the scepter’s upper blade and seeped into Jacob’s chest. A dark sapphire color traveled in a geometric pattern up his neck and into his eyes, that swirled with a ink-black color and settled into his irises, turning a somewhat blue color. He stood up straight and holstered his gun.</p>
<p>Ana snuck away to the Palantír as Eridan continued making his rounds with the other SHIELD personnel, and unfolded a large silver cloth of Elvish make. Reaching up, she pried the large stone from its cradle, and wrapped it tight.</p>
<p>She stood up and tried to leave, but…</p>
<p>“Don’t. I still need that.”</p>
<p>Ana froze up straight. She turned to the Black Hand, eyeing him with distaste. For someone with a knowledge bank as vast as hers, Ana recalled little of his evil doings, but one thing she knew: his mere presence spreads terror to all on the battlefield, be they foes or servants. From her time in Gondor, she heard some say he was once a king from the east who brought Sauron the heads of the two blue Istari as gifts. Others said that he returned across the seas with Sauron after the fall of Númenor. Still others claimed that he is the Dark Lord himself, taking fair form once again within Mordor. People invented many stories of his origins. All of them lies. The only things which are certain are that he is a master of deceit, and that he serves his Dark Lord with absolute loyalty.</p>
<p>“This doesn’t have to get any messier.”</p>
<p>“Of course it does. I have come too far for anything else. You know more than these petty mortals, Ana. I am Eridan, the Black Hand of Sauron, and I... am a man on a mission.”</p>
<p>“Eridan? The Black Hand?” Selvig whispered, as he struggled to get up.</p>
<p>“We have no quarrel with the lands of Arda,” Ana continued.</p>
<p>“An ant has no quarrel with a boot,” spoke Eridan.</p>
<p>Ana tilted her head slightly. “Do you plan to step on us?”</p>
<p>A brief evil expression flashed over his face, before returning to his signature frown. He raised his arms in a boasting manner as he slowly walked towards Selvig, though his back still faced the doctor. “I come with glad tidings! Simply, return what is my master’s, and you may still continue your meaningless lives for a bit longer.”</p>
<p>“What is it Sauron seeks, hm?” Ana said as she started to back away. She was playing a risky roll here.</p>
<p>“You know exactly what,” he continued quietly. “The Ruling Ring… the mightiest gift of all. What still plagues, still weakens Gondor…” he expertly spun around and pressed the scepter into Selvig’s chest. His eyes turned black and into glowing blue orbs. “You know of what I speak, of Isildur's Bane.”</p>
<p>“Ah yes, I recall now,” Ana said, ignoring the growing hum and increased swirling from the blue cloud above them. Jacob looked up for a moment, then turned to Eridan. "Magical piece of jewellery, correct?"</p>
<p>“Sir, Ana is stalling. This place is about to blow. Drop a hundred feet of rock on us. She means to bury us.”</p>
<p>“Like the great kings of old,” Ana replied dryly.</p>
<p>“He's right. The portal is collapsing in on itself,” Selvig interjected. “We’ve got maybe two minutes before this goes critical.”</p>
<p>“Then, well, I cannot deny was good to see you, Mithrandir, but I fear our time is up. I do hope our paths cross again,” he smirked. As on command, in a blink of an eye, Jacob raised his gun and shot Ana, who deflected it but flinched enough for Eridan to shoot another blast at the old woman. She flew back, smashing hard against the concrete floor, dropping the Palantír. The now-black stone rolled towards the leaving group, with Jacob quickly picking it up and handing it to Selvig, who placed it into a metal suitcase designed to carry it.</p>
<p>Ana painfully lifted herself up, brushing away the now-ashen parts of her grey robes. She quickly grabbed a radio.</p>
<p>“Hill, do you copy?! Frye is—” Ana was interrupted by gunshots and various loud noises. She took the opportunity to rise, grab her staff, and bolt the hell out of there. The energy was brewing a shitstorm from the vacuum chamber ceiling. “He’s got the Palantír! Track it down!”</p>
<p>Ana continued running, avoiding the falling pipes and debris. The whole facility was in a goddamn earthquake.</p>
<p>“You’re clear ma’am! We need to go!” Coulson’s voice came over the radio.</p>
<p>Ana bolted like a bat out of hell to the chopper. She could feel the ground starting to cave away behind her, and no more than a second after she jumped onto the helicopter the ground gave away.</p>
<p>Suddenly a brilliant white light blew out all the windows of the crumbling facility, and everything collapsed in on itself.</p>
<p>Thirty seconds later, as they were flying over the main road, a Jeep with smashed windows and shit came roaring out of the tunnel. Ana opened the door quickly; she’d recognize that scepter and its owner any day. Uttering a spell, a burning orb of fire left the top of her staff towards the car. Jacob, being the driver, expertly avoided it, and Eridan fired a beam of blue energy towards the helicopter tail. Ana jumped out just before it crashed into the ground, it’s spinning rotors coming dangerously close to her.</p>
<p>She stood in place for a few moments, watching the car drive away into the distance. Her radio came to life at that moment, Coulson’s voice talking over it.</p>
<p>“Ana? Ana, do you copy?”</p>
<p>“The Palantír is with the enemy,” she said. Ana peeked over her shoulder at the ruined chopper. “I have men down. Hill?”</p>
<p>“A lot of men still under, don't know how many survivors,” her voice sounded, followed by some crunching noises and a colorful string of curses.</p>
<p>Ana pursed her lips. “Sound the general call. I want every living soul not working rescue looking for that briefcase.”</p>
<p>“Roger that,” Hill said.</p>
<p>“Coulson, get back to base. This is a level Seven. As of right now, we are at war.” She looked up. And she thought some things to herself.</p>
<p>“What do we do?” Coulson said.</p>
<p>Ana swallowed. The desert wind was toying with her white hair as her grey robes slowly turned light brown with dust.</p>
<p>"Prepare for war."</p>
