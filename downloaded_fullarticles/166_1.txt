    <p>
  <span>It wasn’t the first time it happened.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco sat trembling on his hard tiled kitchen floor, shards of whitebone china scattered at his feet. The porcelain pieces were all jagged, small, impossible to Reparo. He hadn’t even been thinking at the time, his mind focused instead on plastering a smile across his face. It wasn’t until the burning smell furled out of his oven that he realised something was wrong.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He had burned the roast. Again. This time only ten minutes before his mother and father were set to arrive for their monthly Sunday night dinner. Draco had failed once again, and upon that realisation, everything shattered.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He hurried all the pieces of expensive heirloom china into the bin and Flooed Pansy in a panic. Pans didn’t hesitate to cast over different place settings from her own lineage, and grittingly agreed to accompany him to the horrid dinner that was soon to occur. She even brought her own casserole, saint that she was. Molly always made enough food for everyone anyway; her contribution would not be missed at the Weasley household, and Ginny, mercifully and patiently, was quick with an excuse for Pansy’s absence.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Only minutes later, his mother was none the wiser that the seat she was currently sitting in was covered in shards of porcelain only moments before. His father, on the other hand, made some rude remark about how Parkinson china was inferior to the Malfoy heritage. Draco gritted his teeth and Pansy reached under the table to grip Draco’s hand before the window panes could crack.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You have got to get your magic under control,” Pansy lectured as soon as his parents were safely through the fireplace and out of sight. “Your excuse about having your china magically cleaned might have passed this time, although don’t think for a second your mother actually believed you. And according to your dipshit father, my Aubergine Parm was dry.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco fell into his favourite leather chair and buried his head in his hands. “I thought this was over when I set my ottomon on fire.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Pansy sat on the armrest and wrapped her arm around Draco’s shoulder. She leaned close and pressed the corner of her forehead against Draco’s. “When your father asked when you’d be producing an heir?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco slumped further forward. “No, that was when I shot that errant Reducio and turned my bedroom into doll furniture.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Right.” Pansy rubbed soothing circles into Draco’s back. “Do you think maybe you should-”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not an option, you know that.” Draco shook his head. “They’re my parents. I’m not cutting them off. Besides, they mean well. I just need to learn to channel my magic.” He clenched his hands into fists, angry that his own magical core was betraying him and behaving like some ridiculous child. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The truth was, he hadn’t been able to harness his magic in a very long time. Not since his wand was harnessed by someone else. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Potter</span>
  </em>
  <span>. When he took his wand, or rather, Draco handed it to him in the heat of war, he let go of the one piece that helped him command his gift. Even though it was back in his hands in all of it’s Hawthorn glory, he wasn’t able to manipulate it as well as he had before. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It didn’t happen all the time; not usually at Slug &amp; Jiggers, where Draco was an apprentice, nor when he was playing two-aside Quidditch. His ‘events’ occurred in times of extreme stress, more often than not when his parents were around. Something about their presence made Draco feel off-kilter, panicked. Unsure, and unprepared. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Still, they were his family, and he couldn’t stop being their child. No matter how cold his father was about his lifestyle. No matter how much his mother whined every Christmas that went by without a grandchild to spoil.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco rubbed his eyes, trying to steady his breaths as the stress of the evening passed. He had another thirty days before he had to deal with them again, and he tried to push the impending dread to the back of his mind. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You know,” Pansy said, her voice soft and calm and comforting, “I do have an idea.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What’s that?” Draco attempted to not sound rude, but he doubted Pansy had any suggestion that wasn’t ‘burn Lucius at the stake’.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Pansy paused her circles along his spine, and when he looked up at her, she winked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There’s someone I want you to meet.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>---------</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco stood nervously outside of Alice’s Holistic Maladies. He hadn’t been into this establishment, considering it was a direct competitor for his current proprietor, and he wasn’t sure how some non-potioned plants and herbs were supposed to solve his panic attacks. Still, Pansy had suggested it and he trusted her. With that in mind, Draco opened the solid wooden door and stepped inside.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The soft chime of a bell informed the shop of his arrival. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hello, Draco!” a masculine voice welcomed him from the back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco squinted through the dim light at the greeter. At first glance he looked tall, broad. His arms were exposed, a tank top stretched across his chest. As Draco ventured closer into the shop, he was able to see the man’s shaggy blond hair, his soft eyes, his charming smile.  “Longbottom?” Draco walked to the counter in disbelief. “You work here?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Neville shrugged, and Draco couldn’t help but watch his shoulders rise and fall. “I own here. Pansy said you’d be stopping by.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He continued to stare, his eyes wandering downward to read the writing across Neville’s tight shirt. ‘Plant Daddy’ was written in green flowing letters, and tiny daffodils were blooming at the end of each word, their golden yellow petals lengthening and contracting in a steady rhythm. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco hadn’t seen Neville since the war, although that was only in a blur of fear and ash. The last time he had actually noticed Neville was weeks before, a glimpse down a hallway, Neville’s arms tucked around a second year, leading them to the Room of Requirement.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>At the time, he knew he should have reported the spotting, the Room itself to the Carrows. But Draco had stopped reporting anything after that night at the Manor. When he lied to his mother for the first time and gave Potter his wand. When he knew for the first time what it felt like to be helpless under power.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Neville had...grown up since then. At Hogwarts he was clumsy, a bit cowardly. He never really made eye contact with Draco or his friends, and they had written him off as just another Potter supporter, not close enough to be a threat but not far enough to disregard completely.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Now, as Draco evaluated Longbottom for the first time in years, he could be more appreciative. He had certainly grown, or maybe his height was due to not cowering in fear. He certainly filled out a shirt better; Draco could practically see every outline of muscle under thin white fabric. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He definitely seemed more confident, and whether it was because he was in his own shop, surrounded by his familiar plants, or because he just exuded that kind of energy in his late twenties, Draco wasn’t sure. He licked his lips as he pondered this fact, and it wasn’t until he heard a cough that he realised how long he’d been staring at the daffodils painted across Neville’s pectorals, one petal barely dusting a peaked nub of fabric.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“See something you like?” Neville said, and Draco instantly averted his eyes to a plant directly over Neville’s right shoulder. It was spouting red-hued berries, and Draco felt his cheeks flush in a similar fashion. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Didn’t know you owned such a horrid shop,” Draco hurried to criticize. Neville’s shop or not, it was still a direct threat to his own industry, and surely offered an inferior product. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Horrid indeed,” Neville chuckled, grabbing a bottle from the counter and giving the berry bush a spritz. “So horrid I’ve managed to stay open for five years now.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Five years. Draco had been sitting behind a desk five years ago, and Neville had started a now-successful business. Typical Gryffindor. Potter was the same, already Head Auror at the ripe age of twenty-nine, while Draco was just starting his career. Not that Draco wasn’t ambitious; he had spent an additional eight years learning the ins and outs of potionwork. It was hard and strenuous, but it had prepared him for his line of work. He hadn’t had the time to keep up with most of his classmates, except for Pansy and Blaise of course. And he heard about Potter through Ginny, who he saw occasionally when he visited Pans. But Neville hadn’t come up. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Who’s Alice, then?” Draco itched for a change of subject, making a point to turn his body from Neville as he admired all the other plants and vines in the shop. One side was covered in dirt, housing a large number of trees with intertwining branches, several bearing fruit. Against the wall were several wooden shelves, all storing tiny succulents and colourful flowers and miniature cacti. It was quite stunning to see so much green inside, packed and blooming and bright. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Alice is my mother. That plant over there,” Neville pointed to a vine crawling up and jutting under a half-cracked window, “brought back her memory. As did Bellatrix dying, breaking some of her curses. Sorry about your aunt.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Congratulations for your mother.” Draco turned back and gave him a nod, careful not to venture past his neck.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, now that the pleasantries are over, how can I help?” Neville stared at Draco, his hazelnut eyes strong and inquisitive.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco swallowed. He tried to meet Neville’s gaze, but Draco wasn’t used to asking for things. He was used to demanding, to throwing around his name and his perfect complexion to get what he wanted. He held eye contact as long as possible, but ultimately glancing at the floor when he finally gained the courage to speak. “Pansy is under the impression you can help me with a little issue I’m having.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think setting your furniture on fire is more than a </span>
  <em>
    <span>little</span>
  </em>
  <span> issue.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well if you already knew, then why did you ask?” Draco snapped his head, setting Neville with a glare. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“To see if you could say it out loud.” Neville chuckled. “Admitting our faults is hard, admitting our needs is even harder.” Neville walked around the counter until he was standing directly in front of Draco. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>His commanding presence made Draco unwillingly nervous, and he let his eyes drop back to the floor until Neville placed a firm hand under his chin. “Tell me what you need, Draco,” he said, his brown eyes boring into Draco’s. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco exhaled a breath he hadn’t even realised he was holding. He wasn’t quite sure what he needed, more so what he needed to stop his magic’s erratic behaviour. This was ridiculous. In school, Longbottom could barely control his own magic. There’s no way he’d be able to help Draco control his own. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This was a mistake,” Draco shook his chin out of Neville’s grip and turned toward the door. “I should have never listened to Pansy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He was almost at the door when Neville shouted out behind him. “Come back here tonight. 9:30. I’ve got a remedy I think will help you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>---</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Merlin, Pansy, what the fuck did you have me walk into?” Draco called over the Floo.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I can’t talk about this here, Ron and the kids are over. Just...move, I’m coming through.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco shifted out of his squat in front of the fireplace and got comfortable in his leather chair. When Pansy arrived, she quickly accioed two whiskeys from Draco’s cabinet, and thrust one into Draco’s hand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The kids are cute and all, but this is more of an adult conversation.” Pansy sat on the sofa, cradling her glass in her hands. “Ginny would be mortified if Ron knew what was going on.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And what, exactly, </span>
  <em>
    <span>is</span>
  </em>
  <span> going on?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Pansy shot back her whiskey in one gulp. “Ginny agreed that I could discuss this with you. She’s actually talked about it with...someone else close to her, and felt that you might benefit from the same conversation.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She told one of her friends about holistic maladies? Not quite a secret conversation.” Draco rolled his eyes as Pansy accioed another glass. “Although I am offended you would shop there instead of S&amp;Js.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, Alice’s is just what Neville works on during the day. At night, he’s quite a different person.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Different as in,” Draco was starting to get a headache, and he didn’t fancy stirring a potion on his day off for a remedy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He trades his gardening gloves in for leather.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What do his gloves have to do with anything?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Everything, darling.” Pansy’s gaze went a little foggy, and Draco had to snap his fingers to get her attention again. She coughed, and continued. “Right. He’s a Dominant.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco raised his eyebrows. “A Dominant? I know he’s technically part of the Sacred Twenty-Eight, but there’s no way he’s more dominant than a Malfoy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Pansy shook her head. “Oh, my sweet summer child. This is not something that is passed down from generations. I doubt his grandmother knows how Neville spends his nights.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What does night have to do with it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Merlin, Draco, you just hate not knowing something, don’t you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not sure,” Draco spat back. “Hasn’t happened yet.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Pansy rolled her eyes. “When two adults love each other very, very much, they give each other a special hug. And sometimes if they're feeling naughty, a spanking.” She winked, sending Draco a sultry smile.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco could feel the colour rushing to his cheeks. “I know how sex works, thankyouverymuch.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This isn’t sex. Well, sometimes it is, but sometimes it isn’t.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Okay, so Longbottom sometimes has sex, but sometimes doesn’t, and spanking someone like a petulant child is involved?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And leather. Again, just sometimes.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Okay, so Neville </span>
  <em>
    <span>Longbottom</span>
  </em>
  <span> is a Dominant, with leather chaps and a whip and everything, which I find </span>
  <em>
    <span>very </span>
  </em>
  <span>hard to believe. How would you know this, Pans? He put Ginny in a ball gag in that Room they hid out in during Seventh?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Pansy shook her head. “More like he showed Ginny how to put a ball gag in my mouth. And showed me how to take it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco pressed his finger to his temple. His headache was growing stronger by the second. “I don’t think you’re explaining this correctly.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Just come with me tonight, Draco. Neville invited you, and I think it’d be good.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“To put a ball gag in my mouth? No thanks.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“At least it would shut you up. Now be a doll and go get ready. We’re going to the club tonight.” </span>
