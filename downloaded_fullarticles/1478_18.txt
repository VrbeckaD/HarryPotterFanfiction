    <p>One particular morning, the Great Hall was packed to the brim with Beauxbatons and Durmstrang students, as well as the whole Hogwarts student body and staff. Harry, Ron, and Hermione made their way down a few minutes late, if only because a cackling Peeves had shown up and started pelting them with orange peels. </p><p>“Hello, Harry, Ron, Hermione,” said Dean Thomas as the three of them sat down at the Gryffindor table. “It’s quite packed today, are you alright?”</p><p>“Yes, I s’pose we’ll be excused from our classes,” Ron said cheerily, no doubt thinking about the Double Potions class on their schedule. Harry was rather excited too, wondering why exactly the Beauxbatons and Durmstrang students were here. </p><p>“Oh, no, I’ve already done my Ancient Runes essay,” moaned Hermione, looking down at her pumpkin juice in despair. </p><p>“Typical Hermione,” muttered Ron to Harry. “Ah, well,” he said suddenly, “I’d better be going. I think I’ve seen someone over there - excuse me - ”</p><p>Sure enough, Fleur Delacour, one of the most beautiful Beauxbatons students, had just entered the Great Hall, flanked by her equally astonishing peers. Fleur’s hair was a shimmery blonde waterfall that swished as she moved. </p><p>“What is he doing, do you know?” asked Hermione, narrowing her bushy eyebrows at a mesmerized Ron. Harry hastily changed the subject. </p><p>“Probably going to the library - I dunno - have you any idea why the other schools are here?” </p><p>Hermione shifted her narrowed eyes to Harry, not believing for a second that Ron would visit the library for recreation. “Perhaps we’ve got another Triwizard Tournament - but that’s happened only last year…” </p><p>“Hermione, I heard that Viktor and you are going out - is that true?” asked Parvati Patil, who had leaned over the table, her eyes widening. </p><p>“No, where’d you get that information?” said Hermione, stiffening. Harry resisted the urge to laugh. </p><p>“I dunno - it just looked like you two were together last year,” said Parvati, frowning. “Listen, I’ve got to tell Lavender this, she was betting on it - ” </p><p>“So, are you going out with Viktor?” Harry turned on Hermione as Parvati left.</p><p>Hermione raised an eyebrow, sipping the dregs of her pumpkin juice. “I don’t see why this concerns you, Harry. Now, Cho Chang over there - I hear she’s got an eye on you - ” </p><p>Harry swiveled immediately toward the Ravenclaw table, and sure enough, the pretty dark-haired girl was waving at him. He tried to smile casually back, but he had a sinking suspicion that it came off more like a grimace. </p><p>“Merlin’s beard, don’t be too hard on yourself,” coaxed Hermione as Harry put his head in his heads. “You’ll be good with girls in no time - just some practice - ” </p><p>As Harry and Hermione stood up to leave, they noticed Ron was at Fleur’s table, no doubt convincing her to join theirs. “Just let him be,” said Harry as Hermione shot a furious look at the two of them. </p><p>“I can’t stand it how Ron is infatuated with that - veela - ” muttered Hermione as they left the Hall. She glanced wildly about for a second. “Oh, Merlin, I forgot I have prefect duties - sorry, Harry, catch up with you later!” </p><p>Harry watched Hermione dash toward the first years, rounding them up, and he began to walk back to the Gryffindor common room morosely. </p><p>“Oh, hi, Harry,” came a voice behind him. He whirled around, face-to-face with Cho Chang, who looked skinnier with shadows under her eyes. He couldn’t blame her, after the disastrous events at the Triwizard Tournament last year, and Cedric - </p><p>“Hey, Cho,” said Harry, already feeling lame. “Done with breakfast, are you?” </p><p>“Yes, I wanted to leave early,” said Cho. “Are you - er - up for a stroll, perhaps?”</p><p>Harry began to stutter. “A - a stroll - ?” </p><p>“Just around the common grounds,” said Cho, tears suddenly springing up in her eyes. “Unless you’re busy, Harry, I can go - ” </p><p>"No, no!” Harry blurted, leaping toward her. “I’d love to stroll a take - I mean, take a stroll with you - ” </p><p>“Okay!” Cho beamed at him, and Harry’s stomach did an Irish kick. They walked out of the great wooden doors and into the piercing sun. Butterflies glided lazily about, the grassy lawn was dewy from last night’s rain. Harry felt content from breakfast and a little bold, so he held out his hand for Cho to take. </p><p>Cho’s hand was small and warm, filling Harry’s insides with mush. “The weather’s quite nice,” said Harry hesitantly. </p><p>“Oh, yes, I read in the Quibbler that we’re supposed to have a good week, although Crumpled Snorkacks might attack us on Thurs - ” Cho cut off with a wild start, blushing furiously. “I mean, oh, Merlin - ” </p><p>“It’s all right,” said Harry, grinning despite himself. “So you read the Quibbler too, do you?” </p><p>“Sometimes,” said Cho slowly, who seemed to be processing what she said now. </p><p>Cho and Harry chatted a bit more about the weather, Quidditch, and the horrible Umbridge, (and it was nice, thought Harry, almost like talking with Ron and Hermione) but eventually they had exhausted most of the safe topics. A permeable silence oozed through the air until, at last, they had made a full circle around Hogwarts. </p><p>“We should do this more often,” said Cho, beaming as they parted, “unless, I mean, you don’t want to - but of course I do - ” </p><p>“No, no,” said Harry hurriedly, “I’d love to do this again.” </p><p>“Alright then, see you, Harry,” Cho said, disappearing around the corridor with one last wave. </p><p>Harry watched as she went, feeling as if he’d swallowed some of the butterflies outside.</p>
