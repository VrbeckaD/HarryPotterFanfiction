    <h4>History always repeats itself ….


Until someone learns from the mistakes</h4>
<p>I'm so nervous and lost that I could throw up. I can’t do that; I have to remind myself that <em> everyone looks, even if it seems that no, that they haven’t forgotten it, people always have an excellent memory for the chimes.</em>  Fortunately, my parents let me come alone, at least they do not have to see me making a fool of myself.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A girl named Rowan Khanna helps me get my books and wand. She talks a lot, asks more, and seems anxious to please. At the moment she asked me what clothes would be best to buy, I knew she was as desperate for friends as me, because nobody would ask a stranger her opinion on clothes if she had a friend to ask.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Maybe this could work.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>OoOoOoOoOoOoOoOo</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rowan confirmed my two theories when I returned from buying my wand: she has no friends and people never forget.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“The same Jacob Reyes who was expelled for breaking the rules and looking for the cursed vaults? Everyone at school will know,” Rowan went from being impressed to having a very annoying condescending smirk.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I know, everyone at school will think I'm weird.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The talk with Mr. Ollivander reminded me of the anger I felt with the people who judged him and with my brother himself for turning me into a pariah, and abandoning me without saying a word.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“We can be weird together! What do I say if someone bothers with the topic of your brother?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em> Oh.</em> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I can defend myself, but I could use a hand.” I am of the opinion that union is strength and if Rowan wanted to be my friend, it would be better to know that this is a give and take relationship. Besides, I still had not forgiven her for making fun of my situation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rowan and I broke apart with the promise of finding each other again at Hogwarts and I could not help but smile with relief at not having to face the castle alone.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>OoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOo</p>
<p>The train trip was overwhelming. I just wanted to avoid the other students and relax in an empty carriage but since the train was so full, I had to settle for a dark corner in the hallway.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At arrival, I had no choice but to join with the other first years, but managed to go unnoticed thanks to the commotion that caused a pink haired girl (or boy? I could not distinguish well), who tripped and fell into the lake, taking the boat and his companions with her.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Professor McGonagall introduced us to the castle Houses; it's not as if that interested me, I already had a house in mind after all.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Sadie Reyes!" The scream surprised me, I’m not going to lie, but I moved quickly towards the hat, hoping that the tremor in my legs would not be noticeable.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>-<em> Interesting</em> -  whispered in my mind a deep voice- <em>I have not seen such a mind in a long time, I would tell you where you belong, but I think you already made a choice, is not it?</em> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>-Yes ... yes- after all, what better to solve a mystery, than the house of secrets.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>-<em> If it is like that, it will be better that your adventure starts in<strong>  “SLYTHERIN!”</strong>but remember not all the secrets are to be discovered.</em> </p>
