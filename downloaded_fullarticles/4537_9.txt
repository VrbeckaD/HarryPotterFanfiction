    <p>Eighth year had started a hurricane in Harry's head. In all his life he had something to think about; the cupboard, hiding from his cousin, Voldemort, Death Eaters, war. Now with everything over he felt his head could hardly take it. He didn't in the slightest miss any part of his old life in the sense that he could never wholly rest, but now it was as if he was full of nothingness with nowhere to go. He felt slightly hopeless.</p>
<p>"Harry, concentrate." Hermione's voice cut across his day dreams, they were in the middle of a rather complex potions lesson and he knew full well he should be listening.</p>
<p>He focused in on Slughorn's moving figure and then zoned into the words he spoke. This meant he heard approximately two sentences of what he was meant to be doing, which on their own made no sense. It was at this point his eyes wandered to the familiar blonde in front of him, who unsurprisingly was listening into every last detail and making extensive notes.</p>
<p>After killing Voldemort, Harry had time to think about himself for once, not only about saving the wizarding world. And in that summer before returning to Hogwarts he realised he wasn't in love with Ginny. After getting back to school in good terms with her he realised he may just have taken a liking to Malfoy. After a two AM conversation with Hermione he realised he might have felt that way for a while. </p>
<p>"Harry," Hermione hissed, this time he zoned in to find an uncomfortable silence, "say flax wings."</p>
<p>"Flax wings." He recited out loud, this seemed to satisfy their teacher who turned to another class member and ask another question. In front, Malfoy turned enough to give Harry a sneer before following Slughorn around the room again with his eyes.</p>
<p>"Thanks, Hermione," he whispered, giving her a small smile in return to her frozen glare.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Class ended ten minutes later and Harry was thankful for being able to pack up his blank parchment and dry quill and leave the dungeon.</p>
<p>"I'm very seriously considering dropping potions for something else," he groaned, marching towards their common room with Hermione and Ron at his side.</p>
<p>"And what would you change it to?" </p>
<p>"What about being an Auror?" His friends replied simultaneously.</p>
<p>"I'm thinking muggle studies," Ron gasped, "I know, not like me. But I agree with Hermione, it would be interesting to see it from a wizarding perspective. Plus, I'm so exhausted at the moment I want nothing more than to throw everything in the fire and run for it. Maybe changing potions for something else might ease that. As for being an Auror, you know how I feel. I don't want to be one any more. Chasing bad guys has been my past, and I don't intend to make it my future."</p>
<p>Hermione grinned at Harry's first statement, and then joined Ron in nodding at his second. It wasn't the first time he had said no to being an Auror, it was just that Ron was set on becoming one and fancied Harry working alongside him.</p>
<p>They reached the common room and swiftly went to drops their bags off before walking to the Great Hall. Here they took seats at the Gryffindor table where they were shortly joined by Seamus and Dean who were eager to discuss the outcome of the next Chudley Cannon game. It didn't take long for Ron to heatedly join in and at that Hermione, food eaten, stood and said she would meet them in the common room. It didn't take saying for them all to know the book in her hand was from class and that she was off to start homework.</p>
<p>Harry let his eyes wander as he zoned in and out of the debate. It had been made a thousand times and he felt it best to stay out of it.</p>
<p>It was as his eyes scanned the Slytherin table that he found Malfoy. As ever his stomach did a small flip and it took the sudden arrival of Luna to stir him from his thoughts.</p>
<p>"Have you told him you like him yet?" She asked, looking at where his eyes had been.</p>
<p>"What -- No."</p>
<p>"It's not hard to know you want to. You should give it a shot."</p>
<p>"I- I don't know. It's…" he hesitated, but felt Luna was probably one of the most unbiased and honest people to tell. "He's different. I'm different. It's a difficult situation."</p>
<p>"Only because you're making it that way."</p>
<p>"I'm not-"</p>
<p>"You should tell him, I think you'd be surprised at his answer."</p>
<p>"A punch in the face would hardly be a surprise."</p>
<p>But Luna said nothing in return to justify what she'd meant, she simple stood up, her eyes twinkling knowingly, and left. Harry was short to follow, tagging along with Ron, Dean and Seamus as they continued their chat from hall to common room.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Quidditch is wonderful, but please could you stop!" Ginny introduced herself to their small gathering a little while later, she smiled at Harry as she took the seat beside him on the sofa. They'd joined Hermione who, at their arrival, had stopped studying.</p>
<p>"Evening, Gin. Always nice of you to join us," Ron said with a slight grumble, smirking at her anyway.</p>
<p>"Yeah, yeah, just because you don't know when to stop talking."</p>
<p>"Oi!”</p>
<p>Harry felt a familiar warmth in his stomach, a feeling he's only began to feel after the war when in company of the Weasley's. As if he'd finally found his family. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Just because Ginny and Harry had ended on friendly terms, it didn't meant their old spark had immediately fizzled out. That was why, when the rest had bid goodnight, Ginny took Harry's jaw in the cup of her hands and kissed him. That was why he felt so confused liking Malfoy. That was a reason why the hurricane in Harry's head kept turning.</p>
