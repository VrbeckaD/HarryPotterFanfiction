    <p> </p><p>"Look, if I'm old enough, then they're definitely old enough." Casting his glare around the table, the young man focused on Molly. She was the main oppose after all. And whilst, on one hand, he understood that she only wanted her son safe, it was still absolutely fucking ludicrous!</p><p>"But <em>you're </em>the Boy-Who-Lived. You <em>have </em>to be part of all this." Harry sighed in frustration. Merlin, the Order could be incredibly annoying.</p><p>"So? They've been through most of those little 'adventures' with me. They're both capable and intelligent, if in different ways. And they're both of age."</p><p>"It'll put them in danger! I won't allow my son-"</p><p>"Mrs. Weasley, as much as I hate to say it, just being who they are makes them targets as-is. Hermione's Muggleborn, Ron's a blood-traitor, a Weasley. They're both my best-friends. Inducting them will improve their chances of protecting themselves. Maybe we'll avoid another-" his voice caught for a moment, "another Ministry incident."</p><p>"Harry, dear, I can see your point, but I cannot-"</p><p>"Yes you can. The twins are part of the Order. So are Charlie and Bill. Ron's of age, he should get to decide for himself. Same with Hermione."</p><p>"You're being childish-!"</p><p>"No, I don't believe I am," there was steel in Harry's voice, and a fire blazing in his eyes,</p><p>"In fact, I believe I'm being more rational than you are. Do you want your children to survive this war?"</p><p>"Of course I do!"</p><p>"Then let them do whatever they can to survive. Including being part of the war effort."</p><p> </p><p>The matriarch finally subsided at this, visibly distressed but seeming to give up on the matter. Observing this, Harry reached across the table to grip her shoulder reassuringly, determination stiffening his features, understanding softening them,</p><p>"You know that they'll have as much protection as possible. Just being part of the Order doesn't mean they have to go out into battle. Keeping them part of things here should be enough," Harry took a moment, standing straight once more and glancing around the table,</p><p>"Any other objections? Or can they join us next week?" A low rumble of assent answered him.</p><p>"Thank you." And maybe the words were laced with just a little bit of sarcasm, but the sentiment was there all the same.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Hey, guess what?" Ron and Hermione both looked up as he entered. Harry smiled to himself, seeing how Ron's arm was wrapped around Hermione's shoulders. It was good to see the two more settled with each other.</p><p>"What?" He beamed at them now, playful, eyes glinting.</p><p>"Come on Harry, what is it?" Ron wheedled, a teasing grin flashing as he leaned forward a bit. Hermione simply smiled indulgently.</p><p>"There might be two more Order members next Meeting, assuming they choose to attend. It wasn't easy getting them permission, but I know they'll be ecstatic about it."</p><p>"Who?" Hermione asked cautiously, suspicious about the lack of information.</p><p>"Well, you two of course!" Harry laughed, revelling in Ron's whoop of joy and Mione's squeal. His best-friends were way too excitable sometimes. Still, he wouldn't really have them any other way.</p><p> </p><p> </p>
