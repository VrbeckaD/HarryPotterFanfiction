    <p>The young boy known as Harry Potter lived with his aunt, uncle, and cousin until he was about four years old. While he was there, they didn't treat him kindly at all. They were horrible, and starved him, and generally neglected him, favoring their own son instead while the boy in question took all of Harry's things and blamed him for all the problems. At least, that was up until he got bit by the funny looking dog after they locked him out on a full moon.</p><p>He'd only stayed with them a month after that. He felt achy and sick that whole month, until the next full moon. He couldn't remember the day or the night, but once it was over he felt much better. His family, however, wanted nothing to do with him, and drove him to the middle of London and dropped him off where his aunt said 'his kind' would be able to find him.</p><p>It didn't take too long for a nice looking man in funny, shabby clothing to find him. Harry thought the man smelled familiar, and he trusted his senses. So he went with that man, and was taken care of after that. There were a couple of rough months, where he would sometimes wake up and the man would be hurt all over, and himself too, but he never remembered the man hurting him and he smelled truthful. It didn't take him long to become aware on full moons again, and realize that he was changing into an animal.</p><p>The man, Remus, took some kind of medicine every month, but said that it would hurt Harry's insides, and so Harry couldn't have it. He saw how it made the man-wolf-man lethargic, and decided he didn't ever want to take it. He would learn how not to bite and scratch and be bad. After all, whatever made him change was good. It had brought him to Remus, and Remus was good and kind.</p><p>So he learned.</p>
