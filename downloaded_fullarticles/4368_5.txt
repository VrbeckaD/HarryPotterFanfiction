    <p>Draco woke up on the 31st of December feeling well-rested and comfortably warm. There was a messy mob of hair nestled just under his chin, attached to the steadily breathing man in his arms. Harry must have snuck into his bed again while he was asleep, as he had done several times over the last week.</p>
<p>Thus far Draco hadn’t managed to fall asleep when Harry was already in bed with him. His strict pureblood upbringing had left him with quite a few intimacy issues. He could suppress those while he was awake, but that required him to be alert, and one could hardly be alert while falling asleep. Luckily, Draco almost never woke up when Harry sought his comfort after he’d fallen asleep.</p>
<p>Smiling happily, he pressed a kiss on Harry’s head. There was no one there to see him look like a lovesick teenager, so he let himself have his moment. Harry stirred a bit, so Draco automatically tightened his arms around him. Harry still slept without a shirt, though now that that meant that he had free access to the man’s skin, Draco had stopped complaining about it.</p>
<p>“Morning.” Harry mumbled, his voice thick with sleep. He nudged his head against Draco’s chest, and Draco felt himself die a little. Okay, a lot.</p>
<p>“Morning.” He whispered back once his heart had stopped being so full of love that it blocked his throat.</p>
<p>“Meow.” Arthur told them as she hopped onto the bed.</p>
<p>“Ey darling.” Harry struggled to get his arms out from underneath the blankets, and Draco rolled to the side to give his boyfriend more space to pet the kitten. Hearing Harry whisper sweet nothings to Arthur was one of the best parts of his day, despite the fact that the cat was a misbehaving menace.</p>
<p>When Arthur hopped off the bed again after getting her morning dose of attention, Harry stretched and appeared to get ready for some more sleep. It had taken Draco a long time to fall asleep the night before, so Harry had probably only crawled in with him and slept himself around two in the morning. Feeling slightly guilty for that, Draco threw his legs out of the bed and got up.</p>
<p>“What are you going?” Draco chuckled at Harry’s jumbled English.</p>
<p>“The kitchens and the owlery.” He replied as he bent over Harry and kissed him on the cheek. His stomach was a storm of nerves as he did so, with several voices in his head telling him that he shouldn’t, that he was moving too fast, that he was deserting his roots and a whole load of other crap that he resolutely shoved away. His pureblood upbringing had so far only bright his misery, he couldn’t imagine it bringing him any good now.</p>
<p>“‘Kay.” Harry said, smiling. “Later.”</p>
<p>“Later Harry.” He said back, before quickly throwing on a loose outer robe and getting a start on his errands. He was back about fifteen minutes later with a breakfast tray and a copy of <em>Monthly International Potion Journal</em>. He’d gotten a subscription for it from Pansy for Christmas.</p>
<p>Harry was asleep again, but that didn’t stop him from putting his arms around Draco when he got back in bed. It was really rather sweet, and it took several minutes before Draco could get himself to open his magazine and start reading. Even then he kept glancing at Harry every few paragraphs, reassuring himself that it really was Harry lying next to him. That it had all been real, the past few weeks.</p>
<p>“You’re such a nerd.” Draco had finally managed to get invested into a research on regrowing coral reefs using a modified version of gillyweed, that he hadn’t noticed Harry waking up. “It’s very cute.”</p>
<p>“I am not cute.” Draco said absentmindedly as he tried to wrap his mind around the combination of transfiguration and genetic manipulation the people in the article had tried to pull off. He really had to do more research on this DNA thing, because he felt like he was missing something. “Stop saying that I am.”</p>
<p>“I won’t because it’s true. You’re cute and incredibly sappy.” Harry leaned over to him and kissed his underarm because it was closest to his face. “Not that that’s a bad thing. I like it.”</p>
<p>“Still not cute.” Draco muttered, bringing the article closer to his face to read the source material. He frowned. As far as he could see the formula the researchers had used had too many variables for a proper model. And they hadn’t taken the acidification of the ocean into account for some unknown reason.</p>
<p>“You expect me to believe you when you frown like that?” Harry heaved himself up and kissed Draco’s forehead. He’d indeed been unconsciously frowning, and realising that made him frown more. Harry laughed, and pressed his next kiss on his mouth. “I stand by my point, you’re incredibly cute.”</p>
