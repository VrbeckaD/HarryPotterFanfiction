    <p>The halls of 12 Grimmauld Place were usually silent, faint whispers coming from the few portraits that littered the dusty walls every now and then. </p><p>However, when Harry and Draco moved in together, the old estate seemed to change. The rooms were brighter, the air lighter, and the halls filled with sounds of laughter and joy almost all hours of the day. </p><p>It had been a little over a month since Draco and Harry realized that they were mates. They were happier than they had been in a long time. When they thought about it, it was kind of odd how they got together, and a little rushed. Not knowing much about each other, they spent most of their time together, slowly learning more about each other and their newfound love. </p><p>As a new day started, the sun peeked through the drapes and the birds chanted loudly outside the window. Hushed whispers and shy kisses were shared between tangled limbs and warm sheets. Although they were quite close now, they hadn't gone further than a few makeout sessions aside from their sweet kisses and small touches with each other. </p><p>Harry was happy where he was with Draco, and he didn't want to force him into anything by bringing it up. He knew the blond would come to him when he was ready, so he decided to wait until he did so. </p><p>Draco was also very happy where he was with Harry, but he did always feel bad when he'd end their heated kisses and touches, because he knew how Harry would get really into them. He would end the contact before things could escalate too far, and silently thanked Harry for not making a big deal of it. Actually he was really thankful because Harry would only smile and roll over to his side of the bed or resume his daily activities. Draco really did feel bad about it, and it's not that he wasn't ready to take things further with Harry, he actually really wanted to, he just wasn't sure how to tell the raven-haired beauty that he was ready to give him everything. He wanted his first time with Harry to be spectacular and memorable, not rushed in a moment of heated passion. However, he wanted it to happen and since he and Harry hadn't formally discussed it yet, he thought now would be a good choice to bring it up, with both of them fresh from a long restful sleep. </p><p>“Good morning gorgeous.” Harry smiled, moving closer to kiss Draco awake. </p><p>“Hmm, hi Harry.” He smiled back, nuzzling deeper into the warmth and comfort that constantly radiated off of the raven. </p><p>“What are your plans for the day?” Harry asked, holding Draco against himself tightly. </p><p>Draco groaned. “It's too early to know.” Harry chuckled. </p><p>“I have a few papers to finish up for Kingsley, but I was hoping we could go out for dinner tonight.”</p><p>Draco looked up with a smile “I'd love that.” Harry leaned down and pecked him, then kissed him again, more deeply this time. Draco responded immediately, pressing back with equal force. </p><p>Draco broke off with a slight gasp. “I actually have to talk to you about something.”</p><p>Harry's face straightened when he saw the seriousness in his mates eyes. “What? What's wrong? Is everything ok?” </p><p>Draco bit his lip and giggled at Harry's worries over him. “Yes, everything is fine.” Harry visibly relaxed. “It's about us, actually.” The stiffness returned, wide eyes accompanying it. </p><p>“Us? What about us? Draco, seriously-”</p><p>“Oh Merlin, calm down! We're fine. I just want to talk to you about something, about us… intimately.” Draco's gaze slowly left Harry's, as he suddenly found a loose thread on his pillow very interesting. He knew they would have to get intimate for when they’re bonded and want to mate, and he knew, being the Omega, that it would be him carrying their children. That really made him nervous.</p><p>Harry was silent for a moment. “Oh, ok. What - what do you want to talk about?”</p><p>Draco sighed but summoned enough courage to go on “Well, I know we haven't talked about it yet, and I've been thinking about it, I guess. I know we've come close a few times, but I thought we should talk first. You know, talk about our likes and what we’re comfortable with, everything. I totally understand if you don't want to talk about it right now though, I just thought I'd bring it up-” Draco's rambling was cut off as Harry grabbed his face and kissed him hard. </p><p>Draco just positively melted against Harry. He was very nervous about this whole thing, mainly about Harry's reaction. If he'd asked why Draco always pulled away before things could escalate between them, why they never discussed this before, why Draco wanted to discuss it now… </p><p>“I'm fine with whatever you decide. You know I'll always be there for you, for us. I know because you're my mate you're probably... eager, and I am too, but it also can all be intimidating.”</p><p>He wanted to tell Harry that he was ready, but nervous about what will happen, if anything happened. But he didn’t want Harry to think that he couldn’t handle being a father and carrying their children, and leave him for someone who is ready. </p><p>***</p><p>As Harry entered the kitchen after showering and getting ready for the day, he saw Draco had made their breakfast of eggs and bacon. He felt his mouth water as he sat down beside his mate. He kissed his cheek and thanked him for the wonderful meal before digging into it. As he was shoving a forkful of eggs into his mouth, Draco slid the morning paper in front of him.</p><p>“Another one?” Harry asked as he looked over it with furrowed brows.</p><p>“Mhmm. They’re back to claiming it’s the ‘imperius curse’.” Draco said as he crossed his arms over his chest and sighed deeply.</p><p>“It’s been a damn month! Why can’t they just leave it alone already?” </p><p>Harry was frustrated. He’d done the interview for The Daily Prophet a month before, and they were still getting news articles with their relationship plastered on the front page. He’d tried to tell them that they had gotten over their history and overcome their differences, and that they were happy. But no one wants happy. They only want lies to feed their gossip. </p><p>People had started saying that Draco had used the imperius curse on Harry, to use him for fame, fortune, everything. Then they moved onto saying that Draco was threatening Harry, then that he had kidnapped him and was using threats and magic to control him. Now they’re back with the imperius, saying that Harry could never love such a monster, an ex Death Eater. Harry continuously denied these accusations whenever they would go out. Draco would get verbally and physically abused when they were out in public, so he just resorted to staying at home, and Harry soon joined him. They were getting angry with how horrible everyone turned after Harry’s confession, and were desperate to put a stop to it.</p><p>“Who knows? People refuse to believe the truth because it’s easier.”</p><p>“This is ridiculous. I’m going to Kingsley.” Harry said in his best ‘im putting my foot down’ tone.</p><p>“You can’t rely on Shacklebolt to solve all our problems, you know.” </p><p>“I know, but how’re we supposed to stop this? I’ve had enough and I know you have too. Don’t deny it.”</p><p>Draco stared at Harry for a moment before replying “Ok, fine. This is a bit out of our control, I guess. I knew you shouldn’t have told them about us.” </p><p>Draco stood and gathered his empty plate and coffee mug and put them to wash in the sink. Harry stared at him with incredulous look.</p><p>“I told them because you looked so upset before I left. You wanted me to tell them about us!”</p><p>“Yes, but I still knew it was a bad idea.” Draco smiled and placed kissed Harry’s head.</p><p>“Wha- then why- ...what? Draco!” </p><p>Draco laughed. “Finish your eggs love. I’ll be in the library.” </p><p>And with that, he sauntered out of the kitchen with a sway of his hips, leaving behind a grumbling Harry to finish his breakfast.</p><p>***</p><p>“It’s out of control and downright annoying right now. I’m sure you can do something to stop all of this.” Harry was pleading with the minister to put an end to this madness. </p><p>“I understand, Harry, and I will do everything I can to help you and Mr Malfoy. I will speak to the Prophet’s editors and tell them to shut it down.” Kingsley wrote something down on a piece of parchment before returning back to Harry. “Is there anything else I can do for you?”</p><p>Harry breathed a sigh of relief. “No, thank you. I’m sure everything will calm down now. Thanks again, Kingsley. I really appreciate this.”</p><p>Kingsley nodded and smiled. “Yes, of course. Anything for you, Harry. Oh, I forgot to mention, there’s a charity event being held for St. Mungos’ children ward tomorrow night. I’ve been asked to invite you, I hope you and Draco can attend.”</p><p>“I will let him know. Thanks, Kingsley. Have a good one.” And with that, they ended the call. </p><p>Harry sat back in his chair, fiddling with a quill when his gorgeous boyfriend swept into the room, filling it with his brightness and ohmygodyes scent. A grin made its way on Harry’s face before he knew it. </p><p>“Hello.” Harry greeted. </p><p>“Hello yourself. What did Shacklebolt say?” </p><p>Harry shrugged. “He’s gonna take care of it. Also, there’s a Mungo's charity thing tomorrow if you wanna go.”</p><p>An immaculately plucked, pale eyebrow lifted on Draco’s face. “I’ve been invited?”</p><p>“Of course. They should know I wouldn’t go anywhere without you.” Harry beckoned the blond over to him. He straddled Harry’s lap, running his slim hands through the rat’s nets of hair. </p><p>“Well it’s only proper, seeing as we’re mates, soon to be bonded.” Draco said with a hopeful glint in his eye. </p><p>Harry studied him deeply for a minute, taking in his unadulterated beauty. Something he’d never get tired of. He did this until Draco started fidgeting under the intense stare. “About what you said this morning…” Harry started. </p><p>Draco swallowed nervously. “Yes?”</p><p>“Well, you said you wanted to talk about it.” </p><p>Draco looked for anything to take his gaze off of the all encompassing green that stared at him so brightly. “Well, yeah, kind of. I’ve, um, never done anything with a-a bloke before. Only a few girls, but nothing huge. I-I don’t know. What about you?”</p><p>“I’ve never done anything with anyone, except a very uncomfortable kiss with Cho Chang and a few with Ginny. Nothing huge.” Harry could tell his mate was getting restless, probably nerves, he thought. </p><p>He remained calm, and it worked, helping Draco to relax in his arms. “Really? Only kissing with the Weaselette? Thought you would’ve done a little more than that, Potter.” Draco jibbed, trying to mask his worries. </p><p>Harry smiled at the use of his last name, and shrugged again. “It didn’t feel right with her. It’s only ever felt right with one person.” </p><p>Draco’s cheeks heated and he ducked his head into Harry’s neck. Strong arms tightened around him further. “Me too.” He mumbled. </p><p>They stayed like that for a while, just enjoying each other’s presence. </p><p>“So what else?” Harry asked quietly, trying not to disrupt the nice silence that surrounded them. </p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>“About us, you know, sexually.” </p><p>“Oh-” Draco was cut off by an owl pecking at the window. </p><p>“That’s probably Ron.” Harry guessed. He stood up, taking Draco with him. Harry grinned as Draco squawked at him, trying to wriggle out of his arms. As he released the blond, he gave him a little slap on his arse. He got a glare in return. </p><p>Harry chuckled softly, untying the letter off of the owls leg and reading it silently. </p><p>“What does Weasley want?”</p><p>“Oh, just wondering if I wanted to go for a pint later.”</p><p>Harry caught the disappointment that flitted momentarily across Draco’s face that was soon replaced with a smile. “Oh good. You should go. You haven’t seen him in a while.”</p><p>“What about you? And our plans tonight?” He hadn’t seen Ron in a long time, busy with whatever Kingsley had him working on, and Ron had just started Auror training. He also avoided public outings as much as possible, and he absolutely hated being far from Draco for any amount of time. Going out for a pint with Ron would be amazing, but only if Draco was with him too. </p><p>Draco shifted his feet. “What about me? He’s not my friend. You should go. You haven’t seen him in a long time. And we can plan dinner for another night.”</p><p>Harry was filled with admiration for the blond in front of him. “Are you sure?”</p><p>Draco chuckled. “Merlin Harry, yes! Go! Have fun tonight. I have some new books I ordered from Flourish and Blotts to get started on.”</p><p>Harry smiled at the bookworm. “Ok.”</p><p>“Ok.” Draco said with a nod. </p><p>“I guess I’ll just…”</p><p>“Ok. I’ll see you later then.”</p><p>“Ok.” </p><p>Draco hugged him tightly before retreating back into his library. Harry quickly sent Ron a reply, then  went to their room to change before flooing to the three broomsticks in Hogsmeade. He hated aparating. </p><p>He got a table and ordered a firewhiskey while waiting for his best friend. When Ron came, they greeted with a hug then started chatting about everything: Ron’s training, Harry’s work, Hermione’s apprenticeship, Ron and Hermione’s relationship, and finally Draco. </p><p>Harry’s heart thumped painfully at the thought of his mate alone at home. </p><p>“So how is ferret doing? You guys have taken quite the blow recently with the Prophet and everything. How’re you taking it?”</p><p>Harry sighed and shrugged. “I honestly don’t know. He’s doing ok. We’re doing ok. I talked to Kingsley today, he’s gonna shut it down.”</p><p>“The Prophet?” Ron asked incredulously.</p><p>Harry laughed. “I wish. But no, just the stories.”</p><p>“Oh. Well that’s good. You guys certainly don’t need all that bullshit.”</p><p>“You’re telling me.” Harry said as he took another swing of his second beer. He was comfortably buzzed and had the sudden urge to get home and cuddle Draco. They said their goodbyes with a hug and a promise to get together soon, then parted ways. </p><p>***</p><p>Draco had read - or tried to, at least - since Harry left to meet up with Ron, but only managed to skim through a few pages before he got fed up and left the library. He ate warmed up leftovers from the night before, made some tea, then sat outside and tried to distract himself with anything but the small, unsettling anxiety that pooled in his stomach. </p><p>Nothing seemed to work, so he decided to just go to bed. 7:30 wasn’t that early, right? He changed into his pajamas and washed up. Harry still wasn’t home and the anxiety grew a little more. </p><p>He once again decided to try reading a little bit before he shut his eyes, but, of course, that failed too. So he turned off his light, rolled over, shut his eyes and hoped for sleep to take him quickly. </p><p>When a long time passed, longer than he hoped for, he sighed and breathed deeply into deep breaths, trying his best not to let the ball of emotion stuck in his throat break free. He blocked out the tears stinging behind his eyes and ignored the heat that rose on his cheeks. </p><p>Merlin, it's not like Harry left him for good! Why was he acting like this? He tried internally scolding himself for acting that way, but that didn’t seem to work either. Instead, he focused all his energy to forcing the tears back, wondering what Harry would think if he found him like that. </p><p>Draco knew Harry needed him, he said it everyday, obviously making Draco believe him. He believed him so much because Draco knew he felt the same way. He thought of all the light kisses they’d share when Draco brought Harry a cup of tea, or when Harry would card his hand through Draco’s hair as they cuddled on the couch watching the telly. He smiled, remembering how much he really loved all those times, and how much he really, really loved Harry. And when he felt strong arms return to their place around his waist and a warm body press against his back, he knew everything would be alright.</p>
