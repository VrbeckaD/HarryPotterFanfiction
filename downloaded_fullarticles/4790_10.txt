    <p>Neville set down two glasses of butterbeer on the table and took a seat opposite his companion. “I don’t know if you have butterbeer in France, Roselyn, I hope you like it.”</p>
<p>The pretty blonde witch beamed at him.  “I am sure I will, Neville.  Look how frosty it is, certain to be refreshing after a day of walking around. My feet are aching!”</p>
<p>Neville’s smile faltered. “I hope I haven’t worn you out!  I guess I was a little excited to show off London.  Especially Diagon Alley, it’s one of my favorite places.”</p>
<p>“I won’t soon forget Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes.”  They both laughed.  Roselyn continued.  “Everyone has been so friendly.  I was a bit worried because of the stereotype about dislike of the French, but it couldn’t be further from the truth.”</p>
<p>Neville smiled. “Well, I’m sure that you being part Veela had a little something to do with it.”</p>
<p>She winked at him. “True, and it is something I am used to. Although you don’t seem to be affected by it.  I know why, of course.  You are not attracted to women.”  Neville reddened slightly.  “I like that it doesn’t work on you.  It’s a nice change of pace.  I can have a conversation without worrying about the gibberish.”</p>
<p>Neville frowned quizzically. “The gibberish?”</p>
<p>Roselyn nodded knowingly. “Yes, the gibberish.  When my Veela charm hits someone so hard that they cannot speak.  Ah-bub-bub-bub-bub!”</p>
<p>Neville couldn’t help it, he burst out laughing at her comical rendition.  “I think I know what you’re referring to.  My friend Ron did that more than once during the Triwizard Tournament.”  </p>
<p>He chuckled at the memory, then took a sip of his butterbeer and glanced around the Leaky Cauldron. He almost did a spittake when he saw who was sitting a few tables away.  “Damn it!” He said it under his breath.  </p>
<p>Roselyn stared at his change of demeanor.  “What is it, Neville?”</p>
<p>He shook his head. “It’s nothing.  I’m just overreacting to an old ghost.”</p>
<p>She looked around. “Oh, you have ghosts in this tavern?”</p>
<p>“Well yes, but I meant figuratively.  A ghost from my past.  There’s a guy a few tables away that went to my school.  He was pretty much the bane of my existence in those days.”  He glanced over again at Draco Malfoy, who was deep in conversation with a woman he didn’t recognize.</p>
<p>Roselyn took a peek in the direction that Neville was looking.  “The one with the hair similar to mine?”  Neville cleared his throat and nodded.  “He’s quite handsome.  Did you two date?”</p>
<p>Neville blinked in shock. “What? No!  We hated each other.  He bullied me constantly.  I don’t…I don’t even know if he’s gay.  Probably not, he’s with a girl.  Let’s just…let’s just pretend he isn’t here.  I don’t want to spoil our nice day.”  Roselyn nodded her agreement and they went back to discussing their tour.</p>
<p>Neville was telling Roselyn about how Platform 9 ¾ worked when, without being conscious of it, his eyes drifted over to Draco again.  Draco was talking animatedly to the girl, his arms waving around.  The girl laughed at something he said, and he broke out into a grin.  Neville, who had picked up his butterbeer for another sip, was so startled that he sloshed liquid onto his sleeve.  Roselyn exclaimed, “Oh!”  </p>
<p>In exasperation, Neville put his glass down and whispered an incantation to clean up the mess.  His wand hand was shaking a bit.  He’d never seen Draco smile like that.  A genuine, warm smile.  At Hogwarts, whenever Draco smiled it always had a cruel edge to it and it always meant trouble.  He risked a glance back over at Draco.  He was still engrossed in the girl, and he was still smiling in amusement.  Roselyn was right, he was handsome.  Without the mask of the bully, he was actually quite arresting.  </p>
<p>Neville was having trouble taking his eyes off Draco and focusing on what Roselyn was telling him. He realized she was no longer saying anything and he tore his gaze away from Draco.  Roselyn was looking at him expectantly.  Damn it, what was it she had asked him?  He thought it was something about Gringotts.  Maybe she asked who ran the bank?  “Godgins.”  </p>
<p>She frowned.  “What?”</p>
<p>“Blodkins. Goblins!  The bank is run by goblins.”  </p>
<p>Roselyn’s expression seemed to indicate that this is not what she had asked.  She giggled.  “Ah, now I see the gibberish coming out.  Except it’s not because of me.  It’s because of him.  Your bully must be part Veela, too.  He does have the hair.”</p>
<p>Neville smiled sheepishly, then glanced over at Draco again.  Still smiling, and now his eyes were twinkling! He was twinkling at this woman! This time Neville was really unable to tear his gaze away.  And then suddenly Draco glanced up, and their eyes locked.  Neville froze.  He wondered if Draco would recognize him.  It’s been a couple of years, and Neville had a beard, now.  He saw confusion on Draco’s face, then recognition. Any moment now, his mouth would settle into that all-too-familiar sneer and Neville could go back to hating him. Except that it didn’t.  Instead, Draco’s expression was troubled, and he looked away.</p>
<p>That was odd.  Neville fully expected Draco to turn nasty as soon as he saw who it was, but such was not the case.  He lost his smile, which was kind of depressing, but no ugliness had emerged.  Neville looked a few more seconds as Draco continued his conversation with his companion, but the smile didn’t reappear.  His face remained impassive and he didn’t glance at Neville again. Neville finally turned back towards Roselyn, who seemed thoroughly amused. “I’m really, really sorry I keep getting distracted.”</p>
<p>She cracked a smile. “It’s okay, being ignored is a novelty experience for me.”  </p>
<p>Neville blushed.  “I’m a crap date, I know.  Maybe we should leave and go somewhere else for dinner?”</p>
<p>She raised one eyebrow. “Running away, are you?  He must really have an effect on you.”</p>
<p>“No, no, of course not. I was just thinking that the Leaky Cauldron has great butterbeer, but their food isn’t very good.  They don’t really try very hard because there’s no competition in this area.”  His voice trailed off a bit because someone had just appeared next to their table. Judging by the black suit and the pale, slender fingers that rested lightly on the table edge, it was Draco.</p>
<p>Steeling himself, Neville slowly trailed his eyes up the suit, absently noting how much Draco was the epitome of the posh boy.  He wondered what Draco’s expression would be.  When Neville got to his face, he saw that his expression was…polite.  “Hello, Longbottom,” he said in a neutral tone.</p>
<p>Now that he’d noticed just how handsome Draco was, having him in such close proximity was unnerving. Neville responded weakly, “Myfey.” Mortified, he cleared his throat. “Malfoy.  Hello.”  Neville waited for him to sneer at messing up his name.  He thought he saw a slight quizzical look, but it was gone in a flash, the polite expression remaining.  </p>
<p>“So, it’s been a long time.” Draco’s voice seemed subdued.</p>
<p>Neville nodded.  “Not..uh..not since Toogarts.”  He clenched his fist under the table.  “Er…Hogwarts, two years ago.”  He saw out of the corner of his eyes, Roselyn trying to suppress a laugh. Draco’s expression turned quizzical again, and stayed that way.  Neville gestured to Roselyn.  “Uh, Draco Malfoy, meet Roselyn Masson.  Roselyn is the Herbology professor at B…” He froze.  He knew he would definitely mess this one up and couldn’t bring himself to say it.  </p>
<p>Roselyn came to his rescue. “Beauxbatons Academy.”  She gave Draco a brilliant smile.  “I was delivering a rare flowering plant to Hogwarts in honor of their completed restoration, and as thanks Mr. Longbottom has been taking me on a tour of London.”</p>
<p>Draco nodded politely at her.  “Welcome to London, Ms. Masson.  Neville…” he turned back to look at Neville, who blinked at being addressed by his first name.  “There’s something I’ve been wanting to say to you, ever since…that day.”  He swallowed and took a deep breath.  “I wasn’t surprised by Potter’s brave acts of heroism.” There was a hint of cynicism in his tone.  “That seemed to be par for the course every year we were at school.  I was, however, surprised by you.  I mean, I knew you had courage.  I still remember you taking on Crabbe and Goyle at that quidditch match first year.” Here, he gave a ghost of a rueful smile, which made Neville hopeful.  But then it faded again and he became pensive.  “I certainly tried my best to bully that courage out of you.  And I’m sorry for that.  I just wanted to say that it was… incredible what you did at the battle. Facing up against V…all that evil. I was very impressed.  I just wanted you to know that.  Well done, Neville.”  He held out his hand.  Neville stared at it in astonishment.  He took a brief moment to let the praise sink in.  Then he slowly rose to his feet, noticing as he did so that Draco’s eyes trailed up and down him as he stood erect.  Neville supposed he had changed some since school, not just the beard.  </p>
<p>Neville took a deep breath and concentrated on his words.  “Thank you, Draco.  That means a lot, coming from you.”  Whew, he’d gotten them out without messing up.  He took Draco’s hand and shook it, trying to ignore the tiny jolt of electricity that traveled up his arm.  </p>
<p>Draco seemed to freeze for a moment.  But then as he slowly returned the hand shake, his lips curved into a wide smile, genuine and almost sultry.  The twinkling was there, too!  Neville felt like every molecule in his body went on red alert.  “Well,” Draco said, “I guess I’ll see you around then, Neville.”</p>
<p>“Yes!” Neville practically shouted.  Draco looked startled.  “I’d like to see you.  Then.  Around.  Well.”</p>
<p>Draco chuckled, but it wasn’t the same derisive laugh from years past.  It was deep and rumbly and good-humored.  And the twinkling was still there.  “Absolutely, we’ll see each other.”  He finally let go of Neville’s hand and glanced over at Roselyn. “Lovely to meet you, Ms. Masson.” Then he turned and walked away to rejoin his companion, who was waiting by the door that led back to Diagon Alley.  </p>
<p>When Draco had disappeared from sight, Neville sat down with a thud.  “So, give it to me straight.  Just how humiliating was that?”</p>
<p>Roselyn grinned.  “On a scale of lucid to gibberish, I’d say it fell somewhere in ‘barely English’ territory.”  Neville groaned and put his head in his hands.  “I must say, it was very amusing to see such a response directed at someone else for a change.  And don’t worry, it was very charming.”</p>
<p>“It wasn’t charming, I looked like a total git!  I acted like I didn’t have any brains, as if I were trying to prove that he’d been right all those years.”</p>
<p>Roselyn grabbed his hands and patted them soothingly.  “Oh Neville, that was not the case at all.  I saw the look he gave you when you stood up.  He talked of having seen the hero for the first time two years ago. Today he was seeing the man for the first time.  And he liked what he saw.”</p>
<p>Neville shook his head. “He’s not gay.  You saw him with that girl, they were obviously on a date.”</p>
<p>Roselyn tutted.  “I would suggest that maybe he’s bisexual, but I know that’s not the case.  You saw how he barely acknowledged me?  That is not the reaction of someone who likes girls and has just been introduced to a Veela. Non!  He is only interested in men, and he is certainly interested in you.  Now, my advice is to pluck up some of that Gryffindor courage and send an owl to him.  Immediately.”</p>
<p>Neville’s eyes widened. “You think I should send him a note?”</p>
<p>She smirked.  “Oh yes, a handwritten note is your best bet right now. Less chance for gibberish that way.”</p>
