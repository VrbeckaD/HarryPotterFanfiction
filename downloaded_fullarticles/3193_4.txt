  <strong>Beep… Beep… Beep… Beep… Beep… </strong>
</p><p>“It’s time to wake up Harry.”</p><p>Harry’s eyes fluttered open to white ceiling.</p><p>“Whe-… where am I?”</p><p>“You’re finally awake.” </p><p>Harry turned his head to see who spoke, only to see a black haired man sitting in the seat next to his bed</p><p>“Wh-…who are you and why am I here?” Harry asked the stranger.</p><p>“You’re at St Mungo’s Hospital… My name is Orion Black, and I am you’re father.”</p><p>Harry felt his whole body freeze, “…My dad?” </p><p>“You were stolen the week you were born, you have a twin named Sirius and a younger brother named Regulus” Orion explained.</p><p>Harry nodded his head with a pained face, “Are you alright?” Orion asked Harry; “yeah, my head just hurts.”</p><p>Orion nodded his head understandingly, “I’ll be back; I’m going to inform a mediwizard that you’re awake.”</p><p>“Okay” Harry replied quietly, watching Orion leave the room.</p><p>‘How did I get here? Last I remember was going to bed at the Durs- wait why can't I remember anything… crap my name is – and I'm from – DAMMIT! Why can't I remember anything ?!’ Harry frantically thought to himself.</p><p>
  <strong>Knock, Knock, Knock</strong>
</p><p>Harry saw a little boy poking his head through the door entrance.</p><p>“Hello” the little boy said shyly waving his hand at Harry; “my name is Regulus” he introduced himself.</p><p>“Hello” Harry replied, Regulus walked over to his bed and sat in the chair Orion had originally sat in. “You’re my brother Harrison right?” he asked him, “Is that my name?” Harry asked, “Yes it is; Harrison Black is your name” Orion said from the doorway startling the two boys. The mediwizard who walked behind Orion walked towards Harry smiling, “How are you feeling Mr Black?” he asked, “I’m…feeling okay, but my head hurts a bit” Harry replied. </p><p>“That’s understandable, you were found unconscious; here’s a pain relief potion to help sooth your head.” The mediwizard said as he handed him the vial, “Thank you” Harry replied as he took the potion from his hand.</p><p>“Uck… tastes horrible.” </p><p>Orion and Regulus lightly chuckled at the face Harry made when he drank the potion. “Okay Mr Black. I’ll be right back with Auror Windelvine” he informed them before walking out of the room. </p><p>“Why is he getting an Auror?” Harry asked with a puzzled expression.</p><p>“We wish to know what has happened to you in the past thirteen years” Orion told him; “After that is Harrison coming home with us father?” Regulus looked up to his father as he waited for his reply. </p><p>“If young Harrison wishes to come home with us, yes” Orion nodded. Regulus turned back to face Harry “Would like to live with us?” Harry looked between the two and nodded “Yes…I would like to know my family.”</p><p>“Then it’s settled you shall come home with us once everything here is fin-“</p><p>Orion was cut off by a loud screech from the door; “YOU’RE AWAKE!” the women quickly rushed to Harry followed by another boy trailing behind her.</p><p>The woman reached out and cradled his head, “Orion have they found those filthy bastards who stole our son yet!” The woman screeched.</p><p>“No dear. The Aurors are coming now to see what our son remembers,” Orion explained to his wife. “I see.” She sternly replied. She turned back to the child in her arms “I am your mother Walburga, and that boy over there is your younger twin brother Sirius.” She introduced them. Harry nodded “It's nice to meet you” he replied.</p><p>“Come Walburga. The Aurors have arrived and wish to see us before they speak with young Harrison” Orion gestured his wife to the door. With a huff Walburga let go of her son and followed gracefully behind her husband. </p><p>“Hello, so you're my twin” Sirius grinned at Harry, “I suppose we do look alike, sadly not identical though; too bad, we could had so much fun with if we were, I mean think of all the pranks we could of pulled?!” </p><p>Harry nodded, not knowing how to respond to him, “Do you remember anything?” Regulus asked, “I- have some vague memories, but not a lot” he explained his younger brother. </p><p>“We’ll it's okay me and Reg will help you out with anything, you'll be coming to Hogwarts with us next year, you'll be sorted in the same year as me, Merlin forbid if a Black was sorted in the wrong year” Sirius told Harry with a thoughtful expression “but in mean time you'll be home with us; but I'll be spending time with the Potters more though” he trailed off.</p><p>“Why will you be spending more time with the Potters? If you don't mind be asking.”</p><p>“Mother and Sirius don't see eye to eye” Regulus explained quietly, Sirius continued to explain “I’m not going by their expectations, so I try to spend as little time with our family.” Regulus looked hurt at Sirius’s explanation but quickly smoothed his mask but Harry caught it.</p><p>“I see…”</p><p>“We’ll be outside waiting for you while the Aurors talk to you” Regulus told Harry while dragging a pouting Sirius outside with him.</p><p>His parents and the Auror stepped inside the room as soon as the two younger boys left. “Hello there. I'm Auror Heath Windelvine, how are you feeling there son?”</p><p>“I'm good sir” Harry replied. Auror Windelvine walked up to him and sat on his bed while his parents stood guard at the door. “Well Mr Black, I’m going to ask a few questions. Is that alright?” He asked Harry.</p><p>“That's fine sir, I understand” Harry nodded </p><p>The Auror smiled at him “Good lad” </p><p>“Okay first question, do you remember who you've been living with for the past thirteen years?” </p><p>“I remember when I was around five I lived with someone but was killed in front of me. After the muggle police found out I was moved to an orphanage…it was a dreadful place to live…they didn’t liked that I could to magic, when I turned eight I ran away, I didn't want to be locked up in the cupboard under the stairs… Since then I lived with a madam Ciel, she was a squib but she taught me all about magic! But then she was killed, I didn't get a really good look at him before I passed out, but he had a really long beard” </p><p>Harry didn't know where all that information came from; it was like his mouth just started talking on autopilot. </p><p>“HOW DARE THEY!!” Walburga screamed “HOW DARE THEY DISRESPECT THE NAME OF BLACK, WHERE IS THIS MUGGLE ORPHANAGE!!” She raged, “Calm down dear, they will get their dues in time” Orion told his wife calmly with a dark look on his face. </p><p>“Do you remember who you lived with when you were five?” The Auror asked Harry.</p><p>Harry shoot his head “No, but I remember him telling me he found me in basket in front of his door one day” he explained to the Auror.</p><p>“Hmm I see. Thank you Mr Black, I'm going to go look through the muggle police file to see if we can find more clues on who took you” the Auror nodded his head at him and then to Orion and Walburga as he left. Orion gave a single nod back, whilst Walburga sneered at him.</p><p>Walburga walked up to Harry and brought a single finger under his chin to tilt his head to face her. “We will make sure that filthy muggle orphanage gets what's coming to them” she spoke sharply; Harry could only nod in response. </p><p>Walburga was satisfied that her oldest son understood, “You'll be coming home with us today. I will go speak with the mediwizard to get you discharged, while Orion helps you get ready.” She swiftly left the room not bothering to wait for a reply.</p><p>“I brought you some of Sirius clothes, you should be the same size. We shall get your own clothes tomorrow” </p><p>Orion handled Harry a neatly folded pile of clothes</p><p>“Thank you… Father”</p><p>Orion smiled at him “I shall be waiting outside with the other two” and left Harry to change. </p><p>Harry sighed to himself; he didn't know what to do. He could feel that he's forgetting something important that happened in his life, but he just couldn't for the life of him remember what it was. </p><p>Harry got up and started to change out of the hospital gown and into the clothes he was given. He looked at himself in the mirror, ‘I feel like I shouldn't look like this..’ he thought to himself. Harry did notice the resemblance between him and Sirius, but couldn't help feel like he should look different. </p><p>
  <strong>Knock, knock</strong>
</p><p>“Harrison? Are you finished changing” Orion asked from the other side of the door.</p><p>“Yes. I have.” Harry called back.</p><p>Orion opened the door, “Very well, we shall be leaving now. Come now Harrison” he gestured for Harry for follow him. </p><p>Regulus walked side-by-side Harry, “ We’re going to stay at the Black Manor. Mother thinks the wards are safer there than Grimmauld Place, we moved there because of the war, but mother and father decided it’s too risky to live there now.” </p><p>Harry nodded his head “How are we getting there?” He asked Regulus, “Father will be apparating you and Sirius and I will be apparating with mother.”</p><p>Orion turned to the boys “Now hold onto my arm Harrison” Harry turned to Regulus before grabbing his fathers arm “See you at the manor.” Regulus waved as they popped away. </p><p>“Welcome home Harrison” Orion put his hand on Harry's shoulder; “We expect great things from you as the Black heir” he looked at Harry proudly. “Indeed we expect marvellous things from you” Walburga told Harry smugly.</p><p>Harry turned away from his parents to face the hallway of the Black Manor.</p><p>“I'm home.”</p>
