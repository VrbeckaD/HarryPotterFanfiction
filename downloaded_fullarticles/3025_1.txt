    <p>"Credence? Merlin's beard, Credence!" Credence could hear someone saying his name. He knew he should respond. Mother would have beat him if he didn't respond to her. But he was so cold, so tired. He couldn't make his body move. He couldn't even manage to open his eyes. </p><p>"How did you-" the voice trails off and the only thing Credence can hear is... water?<br/>
Suddenly a series of metallic clicks rings out and someone is wrapping their arms around him. Credence desperately wants who ever this is to stop. To stop touching him and just leave him for dead. He just wants to disappear. But Credence still can't will his body to move and before he knows it, he can no longer hear water and he feels as if the world around him has completely changed. There's grunts and moans of things around him but he can't place the sounds. He's never heard such sounds before. </p><p>"Here seems alright." The voice says awkwardly and Credence is suddenly finds that he's being laid on something soft. "This will keep you warm." He couldn't deny that the voice was right. It was warm. "I'll be back soon." The voice says quietly, and then he's gone. </p><p>Credence wonders for a moment just who that was. They knew his name, so he must know them. There wasn't many people he did know so it shouldn't be that hard to figure out. Credence finds it harder and harder to concentrate though as he relaxes into the warmth of the room and the cot beneath him. He finally gives in and slips into darkness hoping that maybe he'll be lucky enough not to wake up.</p><p>~</p><p>"Come on Pickett, they're not going to hurt you." Newt says to the Bowtruckle clinging to his finger. "I promise you'll be ok." Pickett continued to cling to his finger though and finally Newt relented and put the little creature back in his pocket. He could never find the heart to say no to him, and at this point, Newt was starting to believe it would be impossible to convince the Bowtruckle. He felt that he would miss him though if he ever went back to his tree so Newt never really enforced it. </p><p>Newt went about doing his daily duties for his beasts. He fed them all and made sure everything was in order and clean in their habitats. He let some of the Occamies stretched up his arms as he cared for them and petted the Erumpent as he walked by her. When he went to check on the Niffler, he held out a small muggle coin to him, which the small creature happily took and put it among the rest of his collection. Small smiles appeared on Newt's face with every creature he visited. When he reached Frank's old exhibit, though, his smile fell. He missed the Thunderbird dearly, but seeing him fly free made it feel worth it. He was back where he belonged, Newt told himself.</p><p> It wasn't till he was done that he walked back to the small area with his desk, various equipment, and the newest addition to the suitcase. A skinny, too pale, dark haired young man that had an obscurus trapped inside of him. </p><p>Credence had yet to come out of his sleeping state. Sometimes he would have nightmares and would stir in his sleep. Newt would usually find him sweating and shaking when this happened, muttering and whispering incoherent words and sentences. Newt didn't know how to comfort people. Animals had always been easier to be around, to take care of. To heal. So that first time it happen, Newt found that he had no idea how to help settle him. After Credence's body began to shake violently though, Newt decided he needed to do something to calm him. For Credence's sake and his creatures. So Newt knelt beside him and stiffly brushed the hair of his bowl cut away from his face. "It's ok Credence. You're safe here." He said gently and careful continued to brush his hair away from his face. Slowly, Credence settled back into sleep and Newt smile down at him. "I promise, you're safe Credence." Was the last thing he whispered before leaving the boy to sleep.</p><p>That had been the first time Credence had a nightmare, and now that was how Newt went about settling him every time. Through soft word and gently touches. Worked like a charm every time. Credence was shifting a bit now but he didn't seem to be dreaming. Newt hoped this meant that maybe he would wake soon. He had so many questions to ask him. Like, how he lived, for example. That was a big one. </p><p>Newt grabs a notebook and takes one more glance to make sure Credence was still asleep before heading back out with his creatures.</p><p>~</p><p>Credence awoke to strange sounds. Sounds he can vaguely remember hearing before. Odd squeaks and grunts that he can't place an animal to but he knows that nothing but animals could make these sounds. </p><p>He opens his eyes slowly, blinking away the sleep from his eyes and looks around. He finds himself in a place he's never seen before and he suddenly panics. 'What is this place?' He thinks to himself. He was in a room full of books, small cauldrons, bottles of strangely colored liquid, and other things he didn't even know what to call. A latter lead up to somewhere on the opposite side of the room of where he found himself lying on a makeshift cot of old blankets and pillows. "Where..." he falls silent before he can finish his thought. Panic rises in him and he back up into the corner. </p><p>Suddenly, one of the walls, the one right next to him, opens almost as if it were a tent opening and a figure strides into the room. He immediately goes to the desk cluttered with books and bottles. He doesn't even glance in Credence's direction. Credence is frozen in place, staring at the figure. He can't quite place the man at first, and for a horrible moment he thinks about letting the darkness consume him. Who ever this was, Credence wanted no part of whatever the man had planed. </p><p>As Credence watches the man though, the unruly reddish hair and quick awkward movements comeback to him. 'He was in the subway... he said he wanted to help me...' Credence remembers him now. He looked different without the blue coat. </p><p>Credence relaxes a bit, as he watches the man rummage through the books furiously. He knew he shouldn't let himself, especially after Graves's betrayal. This man was probably no different from him. He probably wanted something from him and only offered to save him to earn his trust. To feel safe with him. As Credence watched him work though, he did start to feel calm. The man had finally found what he was looking for and quickly flipped through the pages of the book in his hands. Credence wondered what he was doing and why he was so frantic about it. 'It must be important.' He decides. He found the page he wanted and set it down only to turn to a second book and start carefully ripping a page out. </p><p>Credence's curiosity got the better of him and he slowly stands to try and get a better look. The white paper has some kind of drawing on it that seems to have a lot of detail, but Credence can't quite make out what it is. He slowly and quietly moves closer to see it better. It's of a strange looking animal that stood on four legs and had weird tentacle on its face. Credence stares at the thing a bit at a loss of thought. 'What is that?' He thinks to himself. </p><p>"It's a Graphorn." The man says, a smile on his lips. Credence is startled by the reply though and quickly tries to back away from the man. Carelessly, he trips over some buckets, and falls to the ground with a loud thud. Credence, ignoring his own throbbing behind, looks down at the mess of what looks to be raw meat and begins to panic all over again.</p><p> "I-I'm sorry..." he says softly, and quickly and shakily starts putting it back in the buckets. </p><p>"Oh, itâ€™s quite alright. No harm was done." The man says. To quickly Newt comes over to help Credence, only to have Credence quickly reel away with his back against the wall and his head down. "Credence?" Newt asks carefully. Slowly, he gets down and sits himself close to Credence but not quite close enough to touch. </p><p>"Credence, I'm Newt Scamander." He says gently. Credence doesn't respond and Newt can see the pale man start to shake. "I-I was in the subway with you when-" When the other witches and wizards tried to destroy you. Newt bites his cheek to stop himself from saying anything else about the subway. That was probably the worst thing to bring up to Credence right now. "I was there. Do you remember me Credence?"</p><p>Credence keeps his eyes glued to the floor. The man, Mr. Scamander, didn't seem angry and there was even a gentleness to his voice. Credence didn't want to be fooled again though, so he pushed the gentle tone out of his mind. As hard as it was, he didn't want to be anyone's toy. </p><p>"I'm not going to harm you Credence. You're safe here. No one will be able to find you here, I swear." Mr. Scamander continues gently. 'Stop... please stop.' Credence thinks to himself as a rush of anger and want hit him. 'He'll just be like Graves, he doesn't really care about you.' Credence forces himself to think. No one ever did care about him really. Credence can feel the fear and anger start pulling at him through the dark mass inside of him, and Credence almost let's go. It would be easier to just be a void, wouldn't it?</p><p>A metallic clang of a bucket draws him back though. He looks up just enough to see Newt picking up the raw meat and put it back into the bucket. "Aren't you going to punish me?" He asks shakily. Credence had nearly forgotten about the reason he was huddled against the wall in the first place. He needed to be punished for his mistake. </p><p>Newt looks up with an almost horrified expression and Credence feels more than ever like he's done something wrong. Credence reaches to his own waist and starts shakily taking off his belt with an obvious hesitancy to do so. Newt panics and feels sick at the thought of hurting Credence and the sight of Credence taking off his own belt without being even told to do so. As if it were the most natural thing in the world. </p><p>"Oh, Credence, no." Newt says. Credence stops and looks up in confusion at the panic at Newt's voice. "I'm... I'm not going to punish you. It's alright. Like I said, no harm was done. It was just an accident." Newt voice became calmer as he talked, more soothing. Credence was finding it hard not to be sucked in by that voice.   </p><p>"But-" Credence mumbles softly.</p><p>"What Mary Lou did to you was wrong Credence. No one should be treated like that." Newt says with an affirmative voice that didn't seem to fit the red head. </p><p>Credence ducks his head again and pulls his knees up to his chest. He can hear Newt let of a soft sigh, and continue to put the meat back in the bucket. Credence didn't want to argue. If Newt wasn't going to hit him today, Credence was alright with that. 'Just for today.' A small voice in the back of his mind says. Newt finishes picking the meat up and Credence can feel the hazel eyes back on him. "Are you alright Credence?" He asks gently. Credence thinks about ignoring him, but that would be bad. And Newt had already said he wouldn't hit him today, so Credence figured he shouldn't push his luck. He nods gently in response. </p><p>"That's good." Newt replies and Credence swears he hears a note of a smile in his voice. He doesn't look though. He doesn't want to be disappointed if it's not really there after all. </p><p>After a moment, Newt shuffles away, and takes the bucket with him. "If you need anything Credence, anything at all, just call out the door. I won't be far, so I'll hear you." Credence didn't move and Newt didn't see any reason to keep bothering the boy, so he retreated back to his creatures. Credence probably wanted to be alone at the moment </p><p>Newt didn't catch the way Credence's body stiffened when he left though, or he might have thought differently. Credence pulls himself into a tighter ball and drops his head to knees. He didn't want to call out to Newt. He didn't want to bother the man anymore than he already had. However he found that being alone wasn't any better. </p><p>He quietly sits and tries to not think about anything. He wanted to forget his Ma, New York and Graves, but most of all he wanted to forget about the monster he had become. So he concentrated hard on the noises around him, and forced himself to not think about anything else. The noises were still odd, but he remembered the strange drawing Newt had and figured the noises were probably actually normal compared to the animals they came from.</p><p> Eventually, Credence drifted off to sleep, still imaging the beast that  could possibly be lying right outside the door.~</p>
