    <p>"Harry James Potter, you have been found guilty of the murder of five students, treason against the Ministry of Magic, and conspiracy to return the Dark Lord, He Who Shall Not Be Named, to power. You have been deemed too dangerous to place in Azkaban, and therefore have been sentenced to be thrown into the Veil of Death, never to return to this place. Have you any last words before your sentence is carried out?"</p>
<p>Harry looked up at the assembled crowd from where he had been pushed to his knees when he'd been dragged into the room. The Weasleys were all there, Hermione right next to them. The only ones not glaring death at him were the twins. The rest of the crowd was looking at him with a mixture of fear and triumph. Theodore Nott, Ernie Macmillan, Terry Boot, and the Patil twins had been found two days ago just inside the Forbidden Forest, drained of blood, which sat in a large cauldron carved with ritual runes next to them. Harry had been found unconscious ten feet away, with no idea how he'd gotten there. </p>
<p>But that hardly mattered to these frightened sheep. All these years fighting to survive, learning everything he could to protect these idiots, fighting to be believed. Wasted. They'd needed someone to blame, even though no one could figure out what the ritual had been for, only that five students were dead with a convenient scapegoat lying right there next to them. Sixteen years old, and he was about to die so they could believe they'd done something right. He hated to admit it, but Voldemort was right. These people were weak.</p>
<p>He drew a shallow breath, and chuckled a little to himself. He only laughed harder when he noticed the sheep shuffling nervously at the sound. </p>
<p>"I'll only say, that whatever happens after this, you do it to yourselves," he grinned up at Dumbledore, standing right next to Fudge. "I suppose I should have learned a lesson from Sirius. But at least I won't have to deal with you bastards begging me to save your skins any more."</p>
<p>He looked back at the aurors holding him down. He grinned again when he saw their discomfort. "Come on then, shall we? Let's get this over with."</p>
<p>And just like his godfather, that was exactly how he was thrown through the Veil. </p>
<p>Grinning.</p>
<p>{&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&gt;}</p>
<p>The sun was entirely too bright.</p>
<p>Wait, why was he sitting in the sun? He was supposed to be dead wasn't he?</p>
<p>Slowly, Harry opened his eyes. Yes, that was sunlight.</p>
<p>Sitting up, Harry quickly realized that something had gone wrong. He appeared to be lying on a hill, overlooking a strangely futuristic looking city. He heard a strange whining noise overhead, and looked up to see what could only be a fucking spaceship coming down from the clouds. </p>
<p>"What in fucking hell...?" </p>
<p>Then just behind the ship he saw it. A strangely ominous looking comet, breaking into pieces as it fell. No, not breaking. Those were more spaceships. </p>
<p>And they didnt look friendly.</p>
<p>{&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&gt;}</p>
<p>"This one is a surprise. He submitted fairly quickly on the planet, but Purifying him has been a challenge. There is something in his mind that seems to resist the process, My Lord."</p>
<p>The man they called Lord Zylaw stepped close, and grabbed the black haired youth by the chin. Clouded emerald eyes looked up at him. "What is your name, boy?"</p>
<p>The teen just looked at him, no sense of recognition in his face. The boy actually shrugged at him.</p>
<p>"I think you might have been a little rough with this one, Purifyer."</p>
<p>"That's just why I wanted your opinion, My Lord. The boy definitely has some of his memory left, but he doesn't seem to have much will to recall it. Honestly I would have chucked him in with the rest of those deemed useless if it hadnt been for the fight that broke out after his second session in the Purifying chambers."</p>
<p>Zylaw looked at him oddly. "And what happened that you thought required my attention?"</p>
<p>The Purifyer shuffled a bit. "Well, there are always a few who simply crack under the pressure of the procedure. One man went mad, and started attacking the guards. The boy was nearby and got caught in the fray. He killed four convertees, two guards, and injured another two with a knife he lifted from the first guard. Whose neck he snapped bare handed." </p>
<p>Zylaw felt his eyebrows go up. It was rare these days that a new convertee could surprise him. "Well then. He obviously already has some combat training. Very well, do what you need to to bring him around to complete conversion, and put him with the advanced trainees. He could wind up being very useful."</p>
<p>The Lord Marshal looked back down at the teen kneeling on the floor. "Since you don't seem to want to remember your name, I believe we will call you...Vaako. Cylus Vaako. Do you understand me?"</p>
<p>Green eyes seemed to clear a bit as they looked up at him. "V-Vaako."</p>
<p>Zylaw nodded. "Good, that's correct." He looked back to the Purifyer and motioned for them to take the boy back down to the barracks. "Get him finished up. I think we are going to see some great things come from this one."</p>
<p>{&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&gt;}</p>
<p>Vaako shook his head back in annoyance. He needed to figure out something to do with this ridiculous hair.</p>
<p>He had just been through his fourth planetary conquest, and had just risen to the rank of Captain at an unprecedented speed. He had seen the opportunity arise when the previous Captain had begun getting cocky. He'd sent the man to the Underverse swiftly after.</p>
<p>"Captain Vaako,"</p>
<p>He snapped to attention, and quickly saluted when he saw Commander Scalp Taker coming towards him. "Sir?"</p>
<p>" The Lord Marshal has requested you in the main audience chamber. I suggest you finish cleaning yourself up quickly."</p>
<p>"Of course sir."</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes later found Vaako walking into the audience chamber, quickly coming to kneel before the Lord Marshal's throne. "Obedience without question, loyalty until Underverse come."</p>
<p>"Captain Vaako. Rise," he stood and faced the Lord Marshal, but kept his eyes respectfully diverted. "You've quite impressed me with your recent promotion. I believe you are the right man for another job I have in mind."</p>
<p>Vaako bowed his head. "What do you wish of me, My Lord?"</p>
<p>Zylaw motioned for someone to come closer, and Vaako looked up when he saw that the woman had come to stand next to him. She was lovely, with pale brown skin like milk and tea, sharp features, and smelling of some exotic spice, but her eyes made him wary. Something in his memory tugged at him at the sight of her eyes, dark with ambition and cold as stone. Something in them made him think of a serpent laying in wait.</p>
<p>"This is Serena. She is to be your bride, Vaako." </p>
<p>{&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&gt;}</p>
<p>Helion Prime. The battle had been quick, as it usually was on the affluent, peaceful planets. Looking out over the fleet as they made their way behind the Lord Marshal, Vaako had to wonder if they would even get any useful soldiers, but if nothing else the new converts could always be used as canon fodder. </p>
<p>"Never fails to inspire, does it?"</p>
<p>He turned slightly, glaring at his wife. He'd been right about one thing, Serena had turned out to be a manipulative snake wrapped in finery, with far too much ambition for her actual abilities. "Remember your place, Dame Vaako."</p>
<p>She merely smiled at him, wrapping her hand into the crook of his arm. "My place is at your side, husband. From here until Underverse come."</p>
<p>He resisted the urge to send her flying down the rest of the steps, and continued on in the Lord Marshal's wake. He still had no idea what the Lord was thinking when he ordered their marriage. If he'd been hoping to temper some of Serena's more treasonous ambition, the only thing that was going to do that was a knife in her gut. He only wished he could prove something so that he could be the one to put it there.</p>
<p>{&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&gt;}</p>
<p>It was amazing what a small demonstration of Zylaw's power could get done. One soul ripped to pieces and the entire assembly fell to their knees. Well, all but one. He stalked towards the man, telling him exactly what he was about to do.</p>
<p>"Look, Im not with everyone here," as if that mattered to them. "But I will take a piece of him."</p>
<p>The man pointed to Irgun, who lifted his axes and began to move forward. This should be interesting. Very well, if the breeder wanted to go down swinging, they could allow that. "Then a piece you shall have." </p>
<p>It was over almost before anyone could blink. Irgun had barely had time to move before the breeder had ripped the dagger from his armour and buried it in the soldier's chest. He moved to block the man's movement at the Lord Marshal's order, pulling his rifle up. He thought it might be a touch arrogant to hand the dagger back to him, but it wasn't his place to question it. As he moved to drag the breeder to the Quasi-Deads, he stopped and stared incredulously as his wife walked up to him. </p>
<p>"Been a long time since I smelled beautiful." </p>
<p>Serena grinned at him, but Vaako looked at the man oddly. He hadn't looking at her when he'd said that.</p>
<p>{&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&gt;}</p>
<p>The Quasi-Deads always made him a bit sick. Disgusting mind-raping creatures, but they had their uses. As expected, the man didnt put up much of a fight, though he was obviously struggling to throw them out. It wasn't until the Lord Marshal snapped his head up that he really paid any attention. </p>
<p>"Energy. We detect... Furyan energy."</p>
<p>Furyan? He had no idea what that was supposed to mean, but Zylaw was suddenly moving. "Where did he come from? Who are his people? These are the things I need to know."</p>
<p>Planet of origin had never mattered to the Necromongers before. Their goal to covert or kill had never allowed it, and Vaako found it strange that the Lord Marshal cared where one breeder had come from.</p>
<p>The translation vials began cracking around the Quasi-Deads, scattering glass and fluid.</p>
<p>"Furyan. Furyan survivor! Kill the Riddick, Kill the Riddick! KILL THE RIDDICK!"</p>
<p>Zylaw looked like he'd seen a ghost. Impressive for someone who was already halfway there himself. "Kill the Riddick."</p>
<p>{&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&gt;}</p>
<p>Vaako stood looking out at the baren hellhole someone had had the bright idea to build a prison on. At least this should make it easy to find the breeder Zylaw was so afraid of. </p>
<p>He still had trouble believing that the Lord Marshal was so afraid of one man at the word of one Elemental witch. He'd had time to look at the few records that hadn't been deleted, and they had been fierce warriors, the biggest threat to the Necromonger fleet, but they had eventually succumbed. What could only one of them be capable of?</p>
<p>Just then the hanger door slid open, a group of prison guards loading a small transport looking up at them in shock.</p>
<p>{&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&gt;}</p>
<p>What in the name of the Underverse was that? Seconds from having Riddick dead at his feet, blue energy had burst from the man, killing half his remaining men and sending the rest flying to the ground. Vaako tried to move to the unconcious breeder, determined to bring back his head, but the Crematorian sunrise was too harsh. He saw the Purifyer standing there, not making a move, but he could feel his skin beginning to burn and turned to go back to the ship. He had just ordered the ship to leave when the girl came running up the ramp. </p>
<p>"Wait! Take me with you!"</p>
<p>He slammed the controls for the ramp shut, looking her over. Small, scrawny even, but obviously a fighter considering she had just killed at least ten of his men herself. "You understand that if you wish to come with us, you will either convert to the Necromonger way, or die?" </p>
<p>She breathed heavily, looking at her feet. He took in the wild hair and ash stained face. There was something about her that made him want to pay attention to her. Something that called to a part of him long since forgotten. </p>
<p>"I have nothing left." She looked back up at him, brown eyes filled with grief, but she didn't shed any tears. "The only person I had left is dead now. If converting can take that pain away, I'll do it."</p>
<p>Vaako took her chin in his hand, surprising himself with how gentle he was being with her. "What's your name?"</p>
<p>"Kyra."</p>
<p>{&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&gt;}</p>
<p>He had settled the girl into a room to wash the ash off, and had the course back to Helion Prime plotted. He stood looking out the viewport at the stars, thankful not to have the Purifyer's cryptic words in his ear this time as he thought about what had just happened. </p>
<p>The Lord Marshal's fear of one man made far more sense now. The energy blast that had burst from Riddick was a powerful weapon, though the man was obviously uncontrolled. Probably the first time he had ever used it. </p>
<p>His mind kept going back to that moment. Something about it stirred his memory, of a time before he was converted. </p>
<p>Something he wasn't sure he really wanted to remember.</p>
<p>{&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&gt;}</p>
<p>"You mean on the planet?"</p>
<p>"I mean here, on this very ship!"</p>
<p>Damn that man. He never should have announced Riddick dead. That fucking cryptic Purifyer must have had something to do with this. Serena was already plotting how to get them out of this, but he knew this was never going to turn out in his favor. If he killed Zylaw now, after it became known Riddick hadn't died, he would never hold onto the throne. He would never be seen as anything but a deciever.</p>
<p>His wife made some comment about timing, before flouncing off to change her gown. Well she was right about one thing. If what he had in mind was going to work, his timing would have to be flawless.</p>
<p>{&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&gt;}</p>
<p>He watched from the balcony as the Furyan came flying over the throne at Zylaw. He had to give the man credit for the balls that move took. </p>
<p>Watching the Furyan was oddly inspiring. For all his muscle, Riddick moved fast, near silently, like a large feline. A true predator. Vaako watched stunned as Riddick resisted Zylaw, his very soul fighting to stay put. No one had ever managed that. </p>
<p>He snapped to attention when he saw Kyra moving to pick up the broken spear, and turned to grab the triple bladed halbert at his back. He didn't know why, but he didn't want the girl to die by Zylaw's hand. He jumped down, landing smoothly despite his heavy armour, and looked back at the girl. "Stay there." </p>
<p>Vaako heard his damned fool of a wife yell to kill the beast now, effectively drawing Zylaw's attention to him. Riddick had gotten a lucky strike into his back, and thankfully he seemed to believe Vaako was there to help him. He lifted the halbert above his head, and then did something he'd never done before.</p>
<p>He hesitated. </p>
<p>It wasn't long enough for anyone to realize he had, but it was just long enough for Zylaw to begin soul-running to the other side of the room. The moment he saw the beast try to move, he brought the axe down...</p>
<p>...straight into the marble floor.</p>
<p>He looked up just in time to watch Riddick bury his dagger into Zylaw's skull, and then snap the blade off. Serena gave an agonized scream from the balcony, and he resisted the urge to smile. </p>
<p>Vaako walked to the front of the assembly, glancing at the other Commanders. Scalp Taker seemed to be getting the drift, as was Scales, though Toal looked positively livid, though he seemed to be going with it for now. Krone was going to need an eye kept on him for a while. </p>
<p>He turned to look back at the throne, and saw Riddick holding Kyra by the arm. "Are you with me kid?"</p>
<p>She smiled at him, still holding the broken spear, and put her other hand on his arm. "I was always with you, Riddick." </p>
<p>Kyra saw the assembly moving forward, Vaako at the lead, which called Riddick's attention to him. The Furyan looked to be preparing for another fight as Vaako came to a stop before him, but before he could make a move, Vaako flicked a glance over his shoulder, and moved to take a knee before him. The entire assembly followed him down.</p>
<p>Vaako looked up, taking in the shocked look on Riddick's face, before he suddenly understood. Riddick looked right at him, and without the goggles his silver eyes seemed to bore into Vaako's soul.</p>
<p>"You keep what you kill."</p>
