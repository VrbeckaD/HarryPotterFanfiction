  <em> ''Harry.'' </em>
</p><p align="justify">He rouses when the all too familiar polished tone pushes through the fog of sleepiness, blearily glancing around until his gaze settles on the tall figure looming over the armchair that he had fallen asleep in.</p><p align="justify">''Father.'' Harry exhales softly, the corners of his lips tilting up in a pleased smile. ''I apologize. I didn't mean to fall asleep in your study. When did you arrive?''</p><p align="justify">''A few minutes ago.'' Lucius can't help but to soften a little when Harry immediately leans forward to seek comfort by pressing his cheek up against the male's hip. ''What's got you so exhausted, my boy?''</p><p align="justify">Harry murmurs something and Lucius taps him on the cheek. ''Exams.'' The raven-haired boy tilts his face up a fraction and Lucius is displeased to note that his week-long absence has indeed affected his boy. ''I did promise you that I'll perform better this term, Father.''</p><p align="justify">''Not at the expense of your health, you silly boy.'' Lucius chastises, curling his fingers around Harry's skinny wrist. He brings it up to his lips and fondly, as fond as Malfoys can, brushes his lips against the underside of his son's wrist.</p><p align="justify">''Did you miss me while I was away?''</p><p align="justify">The look that his son directs at him is far too cheeky between father and son, and he wonders how his youngest grew up to be such a cheeky minx. At one glance, no one would have guessed that Harry was a Malfoy, considering that he had inherited Narcissa's dark-colored hair. A beauty indeed. Nevertheless, the way he spoke and carried himself was enough indication that Harry was indeed a Malfoy.</p><p align="justify">''Did you miss me, daddy?'' Harry returns the question, the last word so utterly filthy that it rings in Lucius's ears.</p><p align="justify">He spares a glance towards the door. Narcissa was nowhere in sight and Draco knew better than to enter his study without permission. Of course, Lucius could cast a few spells but he quite liked the thrill of being reckless and doing something forbidden in his own manor.</p><p align="justify">''Very much so.'' Lucius answers, the fondness in his tone no longer surprising him. ''Did you miss having your cock up my ass, daddy?'' Harry's crudeness earns him a sharp tap on the lips with the tips of Lucius's fingers.</p><p align="justify">''How crude.'' And yet, Lucius leans down to trap Harry back against the armchair, soothing the sting away with a brush of his lips. ''And yes.'' He draws back, teasing, and Harry whines. He doesn't understand how a whine can sound so sweet-sounding instead of grating when it comes from his youngest.</p><p align="justify">''<em>How could I not?'</em>''</p><p align="justify">x.x.x</p><p align="justify">Dinner is a pleasant affair now that Lucius is back in the comforts of his manor. The atmosphere is relaxed with Draco and Harry exchanging playful banter. It mostly ends up with Draco giving in to his younger brother. They're two years apart but the brotherly love and affection that Draco has for Harry is astounding.</p><p align="justify">Growing up, Lucius was considerably stricter towards Draco. Being the oldest son, there were expectations and it wouldn't do well for him not to live up to them. Though, Lucius thinks he might have worried unnecessarily for his oldest son was doing remarkably well.</p><p align="justify">While Lucius's love for his oldest son is purely platonic, he wishes that he can say the same for</p><p align="justify">Harry. His love and affection for his youngest son went beyond fatherly and into a territory that most would describe as...taboo. If word ever got around, it would tarnish the Malfoys reputation beyond repair. Lucius isn't particularly worried about anyone finding out, not when he intends to guard this secret to the graves.</p><p align="justify">Narcissa's saying something about Bellatrix and Lucius pays attention enough to inject his own answers at the appropriate moments. In all honesty, he wishes to be done with dinner and retreat into the silence of his study with a stiff drink. And perhaps enjoy the pleasures that Harry's mouth can offer.</p><p align="justify">Perhaps not, Lucius thinks when he catches Harry stifling a yawn behind his palm. Dishes are cleared and replaced with dessert, but Harry, who has an immense sweet tooth, politely excuses himself from the table.</p><p align="justify">''Good night, Father.'' Ever so polite around others, that little brat. ''Good night, Mother.'' Harry chastely kisses Narcissa on the cheek, though he playfully makes a face when Draco ruffles his hair.</p><p align="justify">x.x.x</p><p align="justify">The next morning, Lucius finds Harry already seated at the dining table, a book propped open. Silently, he moves to stand behind his son, briefly glancing around the dining room before he rests his palm against Harry's nape.</p><p align="justify">''Muggle Studies, Harry?'' Harry flinches and twists abruptly in his seat, slamming the textbook close. ''Da-, Father.'' He hastily corrects. ''I-, yes. The exams are coming up.'' Idly, Lucius strokes at the skin of Harry's nape and uses his other hand to flip through the worn textbook. Judging by the condition of the book, it was clear that Harry has been going through it quite diligently. Lucius moves around the table and takes his rightful place at the head of the table.</p><p align="justify">''Hardly a subject which requires revising, yes?'' Harry's unable to hide a smile at his father's words. Over the years, Lucius has become more...tolerant towards the idea of Muggles but sometimes, there's still a hint of disdain when he speaks of them. He has no choice but to be more accepting considering Harry's choice of friends.</p><p align="justify">''Even if it's a subject that hardly requires revising, I still hope to score higher than an 'Exceeds Expectation', Father.'' Dobby, their house elf, pops up to pour tea into Lucius's teacup, but Harry dismisses him with a cheerful wave, opting to do it himself.</p><p align="justify">Lucius regards Harry over the rim of his teacup, ''Your sudden enthusiasm towards your studies is...surprising.'' He sets the cup down and motions for Harry to stand before him.</p><p align="justify">''I am a Malfoy.'' The boy declares haughtily, staying still long enough for Lucius to fix his tie with slender fingers. ''And besides...'' He leans in so that his lips are nearly brushing against the shell of his father's right ear. ''...can't have you thinking that Hermione is brighter than I am, can I?''</p><p align="justify">x.x.x</p><p align="justify">Don't get him wrong.</p><p align="justify">Hermione is his best friend and he loves her, yes, despite her constant nagging about every single thing. And yet, Harry had felt...jealous when Lucius had remarked that the girl was indeed a bright with for someone her age and having Muggles as her parents.</p><p align="justify">Harry is well aware of the fact that he is the apple of Lucius's eye, even if his father refuses to admit it. This...relationship that he has with his father is surely unhealthy and so very <em>wrong</em>. He can't bring himself to care though. Harry wants nothing more to than to prove that he's worthy of being Lucius's darling little boy.</p><p align="justify">Which is pretty much the reason why he's been studying and brushing up on a couple of subjects in his free time. It doesn't matter if he's not as smart as Hermione, but he's determined to match hisÂ grades with hers. Harry has managed to do so for most of his subjects, except for Muggle Studies. He knows Lucius wouldn't mind him not excelling in that subject, but the irrational part of him wouldn't be satisfied if he didn't try his best.</p><p align="justify">''Harry!'' He waits until Ron catches up with him, not bothering to muffle his laugh when the gangly male nearly knocks over a first year student.</p><p align="justify">''What's the rush? Hiding from Lavender, are you?'' Ron adjusts his robes and makes a retching sound at the name. ''She's mental. Anyway, let's not talk about her. Err, I-'' Ron clears his throat, awkwardly scratching at his nape. ''I just...wanted to say thanks. For putting in a good word for my dad to your father.''</p><p align="justify">''He got promoted then?'' Ron nods and Harry claps him on the shoulder, grinning brightly. ''Brilliant!''</p><p align="justify">''It means a lot to me, mate. To the whole family actually. He wouldn't have gotten the promotion if it wasn't for your dad.''</p><p align="justify">''Don't be daft. Despite father's opinion on Muggles, he does have to admit that the person best suited for the position is your dad.'' Harry grimaces when he catches sight of someone practically hurrying down the staircase. ''Lavender alert.''</p><p align="justify">''There you are, Won-Won!'' Ron mutters a ''Fucking hell!'', barely managing a ''See you later, mate!'' to Harry before he hightails it out of there.</p><p align="justify">x.x.x</p><p align="justify">''Father.''</p><p align="justify">Harry waits in the doorway until Lucius acknowledges his presence. He's faintly surprised that the older male is already home considering that the older male tends to work past dinnertime on most days. Meetings at the Ministry are well-known for stretching on for hours.</p><p align="justify">There's no one at home and that makes Harry bold enough to slip into Lucius's lap, comfortably straddling him and Harry curls his arms around his father's neck.</p><p align="justify">''Thank you.'' Harry murmurs against Lucius's cheek. When Harry had first broached the topic of Arthur Weasley's possible promotion, Lucius had not promised him anything. He wasn't surprised at all but the fact that Lucius had been willing to hear him out was progress enough.</p><p align="justify">''You promoted Arthur Weasley.'' ''I did nothing of the sort.'' Lucius sets his quill down. ''Merely had a word or two with Cornelius when I dropped by his office. I wouldn't be caught dead singing a Weasley's praises, dear boy.''</p><p align="justify">Harry muffles a laugh against Lucius's cheek. ''And yet, you listened to me. Besides, everyone knows you have more power than the Minister himself.''</p><p align="justify">''I'm afraid that...'' Lucius draws back, affection coloring his tone as he cups Harry's cheek in his palm. ''...being unable to say no to you will be my downfall one day.''</p><p align="justify">Harry turns his head slightly and brushes his lips against the tips of Lucius's fingers. ''Thank you, daddy.'' With that, he slinks down until he's on his knees between the older male's parted thighs.</p><p align="justify">Wordlessly, he leans his head against Lucius's knee and the fingers that card through his messy hair draws out a pleased purr from him. Lucius, in public, is rarely affectionate and Harry finds</p><p align="justify">himself always so starved for his father's love. Here, on his knees, with Lucius's undivided attention on him, Harry feels sated.</p><p align="justify">''Can I suck your cock, daddy?'' He doesn't wait for an answer and simply starts nuzzling his face against Lucius's crotch. The sheer size of it when flaccid is enough to make Harry's mouth water in anticipation. Harry's not exactly in the mood to tease tonight, slipping the older male's half-flaccid cock between his lips once his pants are divested. Lucius's cock is heavy on his tongue and Harry sucks with fervor, curling his fingers around the older male's knees.</p><p align="justify">''Such pretty cocksucking lips.'' Lucius breathes out, looking so fucking regal in his seat while his sixteen year old son tongues at the slit.</p><p align="justify">Harry loves the fact that he's sucking his father's cock. It's <em>filthy</em> and so very wrong and that's what makes it even better. He purses his lips, creating a tight suction and Lucius takes it as an indication to start fucking Harry's mouth. It's almost obscene how Harry seems to be enjoying it; saliva dripping down his chin and along Lucius's cock, slurping and gagging until his nose is brushing against Lucius's pubes.</p><p align="justify">''Filthy, filthy boy.'' Harry mouths at the engorged tip before drawing back, keening softly as he rubs his cheek against Lucius's cock, leaving behind smears of sticky white. Lucius yanks at Harry's hair when the boy starts tonguing at his balls, giving it kitten-like licks before sucking one into his mouth. The way he's working on Lucius's cock and balls is downright lewd for a sixteen year old. Four more minutes of Harry sloppily licking and mouthing at his cock like a cock-starved slut is all that Lucius can take.</p><p align="justify">''Daddy, I-'' Harry's breath is warm against his cock. ''My mouth. Please.'' His boy begs so very prettily, Lucius thinks to himself as empties himself into Harry's mouth, lips pursed tightly around the tip as if he doesn't want to waste a single drop. Sated, and so very pleased, Lucius draws Harry into his lap once again. It's then that he realizes the dampness of Harry's pants.</p><p align="justify">''Don't say anything.'' Harry hides his face against Lucius's neck. ''I can't help it that sucking your cock is enough to get me off, daddy.''</p><p align="justify">It's moments like this that reminds Lucius how so very young Harry is and he delights in this. This act of defiling his son. He wants to fuck Harry, fill him up with his cum over and over again until all that the boy can do is beg for more. What was the word...? Ah.</p><p align="justify">He wants to <em>breed</em> Harry.</p><p align="justify">x.x.x</p>
