    <p>The Basilisk had swept the Sorting Hat into Harry’s arms. Harry seized it. It was all he had left, his only chance. He rammed it onto his head and threw himself flat onto the floor as the Basilisk’s tail swung over him again.</p>
<p>“Help me … help me …” Harry thought, his eyes screwed tight under the Hat. “Please help me!”</p>
<p>---- End of quotation from Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (Chapter 17) ----</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And like the previous two times Harry heard a small voice in his ear, “Nice to see you again after your rather abrupt demeanour the last time. You know you could possibly establish a record considering how often I was already lowered onto your head. Normally, I meet every person just once in their lifetime on their first day at Hogwarts but we already met thrice. However, nothing about you seems to go the normal way, doesn’t it?”</p>
<p>In addition to the small voice of the Sorting Hat, Harry also heard Riddle screaming attempting to order the Basilisk to continue his attack on Harry. Currently the Basilisk was still confused and distracted because of Fawkes.</p>
<p>“In many ways you are a Gryffindor to the core, you are brave and daring. Yes, yes … but there is more. You are loyal and despite your fame and the circumstances of your childhood you are remarkably just and kind. Furthermore, you are not the most diligent student but if you want to achieve a goal you are willing to learn and to find an avenue which will lead you to your designated target even if some of your approaches are rather unusual. And at the end you are also determined, ambitious and although you would risk your life to safe those you value, you are self-preservative due to your life experience. Yes, like I already said twice you would fit perfectly in Slytherin and everyone expects a Parselmouth to be in Slytherin, even Salazar Slytherin himself would expect someone with your talent in his own house.”</p>
<p>Whilst Harry listened to the Sorting Hat he likewise tried to listen to the sounds of the Basilisk which was still distracted but Fawkes would not be able to distract it forever. The moment Harry had lowered the Sorting Hat on his head he was desperate, he had hoped that somehow the Sorting Hat would have been able to help him in this desperate situation. Now, minutes later, Harry’s desperation increased and he muttered, “Are you able to help me or will you just talk until the Basilisk kills me?”.</p>
<p>“I will help you but first you must understand something important. Your first encounter with a member of the House of Salazar Slytherin was during the murder of your parents. The second time you met someone related to Slytherin gave you no reason to revaluate your opinion towards this house. Nevertheless, in the emerging time you will have to learn to see behind the curtain and to reconsider some of your previous opinions. One day it could be crucial to you. You were sorted into Gryffindor but you have to understand that everybody has different traits and therefore everyone embodies certain traits of each house. The Sorting only tries to place every student in a house in which he is most likely to fit in the best. However, such a decision is never the only one possible because more than a few students could fit in more than just one house. In the end it is nothing more than a fair prediction. Therefore, fights between houses and an increasing feud are no desirable aim of the Sorting. You may compete amicable but you should never view students of other houses as enemies just because of their house affiliation. Now I am going to help you.”</p>
<p>Nearly at the same time as those words were spoken the Hat contracted, as though an invisible hand was squeezing it very tightly and something very hard and heavy thudded onto the top of Harry’s head. The impact almost knocked him out and Harry felt dizzy for a moment. Stars winking in front of his eyes, he thought the Sorting Hat had screamed one last word before it became silent again. Harry grabbed the top of the Hat to pull it off and felt something long and hard beneath it. Still a bit dizzy Harry recognised the object as a gleaming silver sword, its handle glittering with rubies the size of eggs.</p>
<p>The help just arrived in time because the Basilisk no longer targeted Fawkes but lunged blindly for Harry. Harry raised the sword in both his hands and the next time the Basilisk lunged, he threw his whole weight behind the sword and drove it to the hilt into the roof of the serpent’s mouth. Seconds later he felt a searing pain in his arm because of one long, poisonous fang which was sinking deeper and deeper into his arm and splintered as the Basilisk keeled over sideways and fell, twitching, to the floor.</p>
<p>Harry slid down the wall and gripped the poisonous fang to remove it but the white-hot pain was already spreading slowly and steadily from the wound. His vision went foggy for the second time this evening and he almost did not see Fawkes landing beside him. Harry wanted to thank Fawkes for his help but the poison prevented any attempt to communicate, he was not able to think clearly anymore. Therefore, he did not notice what happened around him nor was he able to understand what Riddle told him. He could hear the sound of a human voice but he could not understand the particular words.</p>
<p>Harry just noticed the pain leaving him. And then the chamber seemed to be coming back into focus. Harry gave his head a little shake and there was Fawkes, resting his head on Harry’s arm. A pearly patch of tears was shining all around the wound – except that there was no wound anymore. Harry still felt a bit dizzy but at the same time it felt like his strength was returning. He could hear Riddle screaming something at Fawkes and after he pointed Harry’s wand at the bird, Fawkes took flight again.</p>
<p>Harry could hear Riddle muttering something about phoenix tears and then his own wand was directed against him. Before Harry had time to panic, Fawkes returned and dropped something into Harry’s lap – the diary. For a split-second Riddle and Harry just stared at it. Then, without thinking, without considering, as though it was the obvious decision, Harry seized the poisonous fang and plunged it straight into the heart of the book.</p>
<p>The moment the fang pierced the book, a long and dreadful scream sounded in the chamber. Ink spurted out of the diary and Riddle was writhing and twisting, screaming and flailing and then… gone. The only sound perceptible was a clatter caused by Harry’s wand which fell to the floor. Still shaking Harry gathered his wand, the Sorting Hat and the retrieved sword.</p>
<p>A faint moan from the other side of the chamber reminded him of Ginny lying there. Harry hurried towards her and Ginny sat up. After she was able to survey the chamber, she started to apologize and to ramble. Harry tried his best to reassure her that everything was alright.</p>
<p>Fawkes was waiting for them, hovering in the chamber entrance. Harry urged Ginny forward and after they left the chamber, the stone doors closed behind them with a soft hiss. They walked in the dark tunnel and after a while they heard someone shifting rocks.</p>
<p>“Ron!” Harry yelled. “Ginny’s OK! I’ve got her!” Ron’s response was a strangled cheer and after the next bend they could see him through the sizeable gap he had managed to make. Ron’s face and red hair were covered with grey dust like Harry was completely covered in grey dust and red blood.</p>
<p>“Ginny!” Ron thrust an arm through the gap in the rock to pull Ginny through. “You’re alive! I don’t believe it! What happened?” Ron tried to comfort Ginny but she held him off and was just sobbing.</p>
<p>Whilst Fawkes led them the way back to the mouth of the pipe Ron inquired about the bird and the sword which Harry still held in his hands. Harry just promised him to answer his questions once they would be out of there and instead Ron told him what happened to Lockhart. Harry could not say he was terribly sorry for what had happened after Lockhart had already tried to obliviate them twice this evening.</p>
<p>However, at the moment they had other problems to solve – like returning to earth’ surface. “Have you thought how we are going to get back up this?” Harry asked Ron while he looked up the long, dark pipe. Ron negated but Fawkes was fluttering in front of him and was waving his long golden tail feathers. First Harry seemed uncertain but remembering that Fawkes was no normal bird he told the others to hold on to each other and then Harry took hold of Fawkes’ tail feathers. The second he touched those feathers Harry felt incredible light and they were flying upwards through the pipe. The ride did not seem to last any time at all and soon they were in Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom again.</p>
<p>The sink covering the pipe was sliding back in place and Myrtle googled at them. “You’re alive,” she said blankly to Harry. Harry frowned and stated “There is no need to sound so disappointed.” After this statement the ghost was actually blushing – even if she turned silver instead of red. “Oh, well … I’d just been thinking. If you had died, you’d have been welcome to share my toilet,” Myrtle said before she vanished into the sink behind them.</p>
<p>“Urgh!” said Ron, as they left the bathroom for the dark, deserted corridor outside. “Harry! I think Myrtle’s got fond of you! You’ve got competition, Ginny!” Despite Ron’s teasing Ginny still cried silently.</p>
<p>“Where now?” said Ron, with an anxious look at Ginny. Harry pointed at Fawkes who was leading the way, glowing gold along the corridor. They strode after him, and moments later, found themselves outside Professor McGonagall’s office. Harry knocked and pushed the door open.</p>
