</span>
  <span>Remus Lupin stopped, his breathing ragged, as he folded himself over the back of the bench. His legs had begun to shake a little while back, but it wasn’t until that moment that there was an intense burning pain coursing through his calves. His arms felt like two dead weights that weren’t meant to actually be a part of his body and were a discomfort he could really do without right now. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He hadn’t noticed - not until he began to heave - how agonisingly empty his stomach was, or just how cold a breeze in the dead of night could feel upon sweat-drenched skin. </span>
</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>

  <span>. It was a lie, some kind of trick, or perhaps a trap set by Voldemort. It had to be anything, </span>
  <em>

  <span>The urge to scream was simply too great, for Remus and for Moony. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Moony - </span>
  </em>
  <span>Remus could do with the wolf taking on a more dominant role in his subconscious right now, if only to give him a way to forget for a little while. Unfortunately, on the night after a full moon - and especially </span>
  <em>
    <span>this </span>
  </em>
  <span>night, when Remus’s battered body, fractured mind, and broken heart were at their weakest - all Moony could grant his human side was an earsplitting, thunderous howl that erupted from Remus’s mouth. The half-howl, half-scream echoed through the night in an explosion of sheer, raw pain.</span>

<p>
  <span>Sirius’s arms had found their way around Remus before the werewolf could fully formulate what was happening, having stumbled through the door of the Order headquarters only half a second prior. Sirius had crashed into Remus, at what Remus could only determine must have been full speed. “Thank fuck,” he heard the achingly familiar voice whisper somewhere close to his left ear.</span>
</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>
  <span>Finding, for the first time in three weeks, the trace of a smile tug at the corners of his mouth, Remus let out a lengthy sigh and allowed himself to be pulled fully against his boyfriend. The tenseness of his forced movements left him somewhat as he wordlessly granted Sirius permission to take a good deal of the brunt of Remus’s weight while he leant, almost entirely, on Sirius’s shoulder. “Come on,” he heard Sirius say, “let’s go home.”</span>
</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>
  <span>Remus, who was finding opening his eyes something of a problematic challenge, heard himself muttering, the voice sounding unfamiliar and estranged, even to himself, “Need...to give...report.”</span>
</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius snorted as Remus’s head lolled on the leather-clad shoulder. “Screw the report, you’re going to bed. I knew this one was too fucking much, not after the last time,” he heard Sirius mutter. “Hold on as much as you can.”</span>
</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>
  <span>“But...no...rep-” Remus’s reply was lost somewhere between exhaustion, pain and the woosh of apparition.</span>

  <span>Sirius’s reply was a lot softer than his last. “No.”</span>
</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>
  <span>Remus heard a light patter of footsteps and knew Lily had gone. “You begged me to forgive you for doing this one,” Remus heard Sirius whisper, “And I forgive you, for being away for far too long.” Remus wished more than anything he was able to reply, or at least curl his fingers around the ones that had grasped onto his, to show Sirius something, </span>
  <em>
    <span>anything</span>

  <span>, instead of lying there, helpless and unmoving. “So keep breathing, ‘cause I’m not leaving you anymore.”</span>

  <span>At that moment, much to Remus’s intense embarrassment, Sirius opted to drop, dramatically, to his knees and loudly exclaim, “On my knees, I’ll ask, last chance for one last dance!”</span>
</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Get up, Sirius,” Remus hissed, feeling his neck begin to warm up as a number of nearby wedding guests turned to look, curiously, at the couple. </span>

I think you might have been right all along,” his black hair flopping around his eyes as he stared at Remus, his expression having altogether lost his flippant jovialness. “I think I do want to get out of here.”</span>

  <span>The raid was a big one, Remus knew that - they all knew that - and yet sitting here, weak after a particularly rough moon, a moon he’d had to spend alone, Remus couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong. </span>
</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>
  <span>The Order missions were getting more dangerous, and every time they felt like they were making some kind of headway, the Death Eaters proved them wrong. The truth was simple, yet hard to take. They were losing. When Sirius wasn’t getting near killed by enemies, Remus was only just persuading other werewolves that he was trustworthy. He knew they didn’t fully believe him, and that’s why they had a tendency to use him as a punching, clawing, and biting bag. </span>
</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>
  <span>The seconds had long since turned into minutes, and each minute felt like a full day until finally, the next morning, Sirius returned. Battered and bloody, but alive. Remus let out what felt like his first breath since he’d awoke from the full moon, and rushed to pull Sirius into his arms. </span>

<p><span>Remus walked through the door of the flat with the weariness he wore on a monthly basis. </span><em><span>Damn Dumbledore, </span></em><span>he cursed internally, making him attend a meeting so soon after a full moon, </span><em><span>and damn Sirius, </span></em><span>for being able to pull out of said meeting due to </span><em><span>a personal emergency. </span></em><span>Remus grunted, the closest thing Sirius had come to a </span><em><span>personal emergency</span></em> <span>was running out of Firewhisky once their local off licence was closed. </span></p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Remus? Is that you?”</span>
</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>
  <span>“No, actually it’s Ozzy Osbourne,” Remus cried back grumpily, before taking a long sniff. “Sirius, what the hell is that smell?” </span>
</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Okay, babe would you mind not, err, coming in here?” Sirius called back from the kitchen, much to Remus’s surprise. </span>
</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Sirius what did you do?” Remus demanded, not much in the mood to learn that Sirius had attempted to charmed a bludger into a loaf of bread because he was too lazy to go to a shop, or something equally as ridiculous that only Sirius could manage. Narrowing his eyes, Remus strode towards the kitchen and ignoring Sirius’s shout of ‘NO! REMUS DO </span>
  <em>
    <span>NOT</span>
  </em>
  <span> COME IN HERE!’, pushed the door open. </span>
</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>
  <span>What met Remus was what could only be described as chaos. Every single cupboard door was flung open, every bowl, piece of cutlery and utensil they owned was spread around the surfaces, and everything appeared to be covered in a layer of flour. Sirius himself was standing in the middle of the room, utterly disheveled. Half his hair seemed to be slicked back with raw egg, his jeans were covered in more flour and a concoction of what looked like grated cheese, squashed carrot and honey, and he wore an expression of sheer hopelessness. “What in the world?” Remus breathed. </span>
</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius’s shoulders sagged. “I was...err...going to make you a Valentine's Day dinner…” he trailed off.</span>
</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>
  <span>Remus felt his demeanor altogether soften; as awfully as Sirius had orchestrated his idea, the plan was, Remus admitted to himself, a sweet one. “And instead, you had to fend off a pack of angry wildebeest from invading the kitchen?”</span>
</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>
  <span>Throwing Remus a quick half-smile, Sirius sighed. “I don’t think I’m cut out for this.”</span>
</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>
  <span>“No, Pads, I don’t think you are, either.”</span>
</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Do you fancy a takeaway?” Sirius asked, as both men began to shake with their impending laughter.</span>
</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I do,” Remus replied, “but first I’m putting you in a bath.”</span>
</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Aww, I was going to run you a bath.”</span>
</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>
  <span>Remus raised an eyebrow. “Oh, I do plan to have a bath.” </span>
</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>
  <span>Throwing Remus an excited grin, Sirius replied, “With me?”</span>
</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Only if you promise me something?”</span>
</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Hmm?”</span>
</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Never cook for me again.”</span>
</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Deal!”</span>

<p>
  <span>Sirius reached behind Remus and extracted the pack of cigarettes from the sideboard. “It’s hardly my fault the guy is a fucking pillock.”</span>
</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>
  <span>“No, but it </span>
  <em>
    <span>is </span>
  </em>
  <span>your choice to antagonise him.”</span>
</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I can’t believe I’m bloody paired up with him; he chats shit all day and he reeks of dung...which is fitting I suppose since that is literally his stupid name.”</span>
</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Still, you probably shouldn’t have hexed him more than, say, three times in a row.”</span>
</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>
  <span>“It was just a few stinging hexes, nothing that any decent Order member couldn’t have handled.”</span>
</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>
  <span>Remus snorted. Usually he would have berated Sirius for behaving so childishly, but there was certainly something about Mundungus Fletcher that made him want to praise Sirius for the hexes. </span>
</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>
  <span>“What did he say afterwards?”</span>
</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>
  <span>“After he’d stopped crying, you mean?”</span>
</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>
  <span>Snorting again, Remus replied, “Yeah.”</span>
</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>
  <span>“He said, ‘Are you fucking serious?’” Sirius replied with a grin and a wink.</span>
</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh no,” Remus said, immediately transported back to several memories of Seventh Year. “And you said?” he asked, knowing he already knew the answer. </span>
</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius reached for the back of Remus’s neck, and pulled him in for a quick kiss, before stating, proudly, “I said ‘No, but Remus is!’”</span>
</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>
  <span>Remus shook his head in amusement. “I love you.”</span>
</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>
  <span>Reaching his hand back to the same spot on Remus’s neck, Sirius pulled Remus’s head downwards, to touch their foreheads together, before he replied, “I’ve loved you all along.”</span>

<p>
  <span>“We can finally get rid of that pitiful tree,” Remus remarked, inclining his head towards the spruce. </span>
</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius narrowed his eyes at Remus’s words. “Stop insulting Bob.”</span>
</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>
  <span>“You named it.”</span>
</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>It </span>
  </em>
  <span>is not an it. </span>
  <em>
    <span>It </span>
  </em>
  <span>is a he, called Bob,” Sirius snapped as he took a gulp of Ogden’s finest Firewhisky. </span>
</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>
  <span>Remus raised his eyebrows and puffed his cheeks before letting out a slow, lengthy sigh. “Right, well </span>
  <em>
    <span>Bob </span>
  </em>
  <span>can finally be disposed of.”</span>
</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>
  <span>“You shut your mouth!” Sirius cried, “Bob is an institution of this household, he’s a marvel and has surpassed everyone’s expectations.”</span>
</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I’d hardly call the fact that it has stood there for a year </span>
  <em>
    <span>surpassing expectations</span>
  </em>
  <span>-”</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>You </span>
  </em>
  <span>were the one that said a christmas tree couldn’t stay up for a whole year, you were the one that set those expectations, and now you act like Bob has achieved nothing!” Sirius’s arms were flailing and the look of seriousness upon his face was making it a struggle for Remus to not laugh. </span>
</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Alright, Bob is the greatest tree that ever did tree, happy?”</span>
</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Not entirely, no.”</span>
</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>
  <span>“What would make you happy?” Remus asked, eyebrows raised.</span>
</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Well, since we’ll be saying goodbye to Bob, I feel we need something else going down next year.”</span>
</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>
  <span>Remus closed his book and cocked his head. “If I didn’t know you better, Sirius Black, I’d say you had a plan.”</span>
</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Me?”</span>
</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes, you.”</span>
</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I definitely do not have a plan.”</span>
</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>
  <span>Remus blinked at Sirius’s lie and brought his book back up to eye-level. “Okay…”</span>
</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius remained silent for approximately two minutes, during which Remus noted with amusement how Sirius laced a guitar pick through his fingers, in the way he always did when nervous. “Remus?”</span>
</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Do you want to tell me your plan now?”</span>
</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>
  <span>Narrowing his eyes, Sirius replied sheepishly, “Yes.”</span>
</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>
  <span>Once again, Remus lowered his book and looked expectantly at Sirius. “I think,” the animagus began, taking a deep breath and looking uncharacteristically uncomfortable, “that we should spend this year planning our wedding.”</span>
</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>
  <span>Remus’s mouth fell open. “Are you...are you asking me to marry you?”</span>
</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Maybe. I just thought it might be alright to do it this time next year, next December, you know?”</span>
</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Sirius?”</span>
</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius looked up at Remus through his tousled, black hair, his expression nervous yet his grey eyes were hopeful. “Yeah?”</span>
</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I’d love to marry you.”</span>
</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Next December?”</span>
</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Yeah,” Remus replied with a smile, “next December.”</span>
