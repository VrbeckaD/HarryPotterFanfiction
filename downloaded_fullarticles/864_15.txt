    <p>Chapter 1: They Call Me Ugly.</p><p>You are probably wondering how a person who is called (by his friends) the nicest person they know ended up like this...</p><p>In front of a laughing crowd, under a reflector, covered in paint and mud, hair and clothes destroyed in a mess and worse of all, the one he loves...well... 'loved', among that laughing crowd...</p><p>How did Luciano Lozano ended up running in shame through the halls of the palace with tears streaming down his eyes while his friends were trying to find him and comfort him... <br/>How his heart ended up so broken he ended up finding by accident the treasured fountain that could turn him into something beautiful...</p><p>So how did all happen?</p><p>Let's recall everything.. from the beginning.</p><p>This story starts with Carmen Lozano.</p><p>Carmen Lozano was not a rich woman, far from it. She grew up in poverty and even married in it! She lived in it until her husband died and she had to have their kid alone in poverty as well... But even after all that she kept living, living on a small, small apartment hidden on a small alley of Madrid, Spain.</p><p>After her husband died she was left alone with her child, Luciano, (whom she named after her husband), was a kid that the nurses described (in private) weird looking. He had a big nose and pale skin that was plastered on big brown freckles, they suspected he had some sort of vitiligo but didn't look too much into it. </p><p>After leaving the hospital, Carmen took care of herself and her kid the best she could! she was desperate to find a job so she landed on a textile factory making clothes a dozen a minute for a few euros that she used to pay a caretaker to look after Luciano when she was working and for clothing and food.</p><p>She got older quickly under the hard work, the long hours and the mistreatment of her boss but she kept going with hope that Luciano could be a happy, healthy kid with a bright future.</p><p>She believed so much in the future, in hope and miracles, she believed so much that she wasn't so surprised when Luciano started to show signs of magic. He started to clap and bubbles would come out of nowhere, he would cry and rain would fall even on a sunny day, he would smile and her world seemed happier but maybe that was only her motherly love and not magic itself.</p><p>When he got his invitation to go to a mysterious school for witches and wizards called Bauxbatons she got so excited she almost fainted. The invitation came from a man who identified himself as Monsieur Monte. He said he was a teacher at this school and he just happened to live nearby and wanted Luciano to go and learn magic.</p><p>They were both so excited that when she received the list of school supplies she only whimpered for a bit seeing at how expensive all these textbooks, beakers, cauldrons and other essentials were.</p><p>But this is what she always wanted, she wanted Luciano to be happy, she wanted him to be bright and have his life filled with wonders and magic surely could do that, right?! well she certainly hoped so! because she took all of her savings she had and met Monsieur Monte at the only magical market Madrid had. She bought everything second handed of course, from the books to the wand and she thought of saving even a couple of pennies by making the uniform herself!</p><p>And so she did, she worked day and night to make everything, from the pants to the cape to the shirt and the toughest of all, the hat. She made all of this even working on her break and lunch hours.</p><p>And so when he finally got dressed on that baby blue uniform she was so proud to see her own son looking cute and elegant on the clothes she made herself! she thought he looked like the most beautiful creature she'd seen.</p><p>But... Luciano knew better, he knew from a while that he wasn't 'cute' he had that weird nose and face with spots all over, tired eyes because he can't sleep unless his mom was home from work, and she arrived pretty late sometimes... He had greasy hair and some of his teeth were crooked as well... he knew all these things because kids in the neighborhood always pointed them out.</p><p>He wished he looked more like his mom, she had pale skin and skinny body, but that was probably because she never ate too much. She would rather him have most of the food, but even so! she had long black hair that reached her hips, honey eyes that were filled with love and her face, as old as it was now, looked like a doll's.</p><p>Yeah, he wished he looked more like her but instead he looks like..whatever he looks! but he wanted to believe things were going to get better soon, after all... he was a wizard! he had something nobody else on the neighborhood had, nobody on the apartment building, nobody at his old school! he could learn so many things at this new school and then, with enough luck, he could give his mom a happy easy life.</p><p>He hoped for so many things and wished for even more but days later he found out many truths of this world. Not everyone is beautiful and not everyone is nice.</p><p>He stood out, a lot. From the clothes he wore to the wand he used to the pigment of his skin even. He stood out a lot.</p><p>This castle...this palace was beautiful, hallways that extended for several meters and were decorated on moving art and portraits of beautiful elegant witches. Golden sculptures and gentle sounds at the time of eating and murals painted by the most amazing artists decorating their classrooms. And in this beautiful place he stood out like a sore thumb.</p><p>At first it started with odd looks, a kid with handmade clothes that were a bit too loose on the sides and a crooked hat made of Felt. He seemed tired all the time and people would just stare wondering if he was sorted in the right school.</p><p>Then he got prescribed with glasses and it seemed like the combination was completed, it seemed this invited people to just be mean around him. Before they gave him odd looks but when he got the glasses he seemed to fit the entire profile of a meek kid that would do anything people said and even if it wasn't true the other students made sure it felt that way.</p><p>Thiago Alphonse was the one to perpetuate this kind of behaviour. He was in the same class as Luciano and was described and named by other students as the 'Dark Beauty of Portugal'</p><p>Thiago had dark brown eyes on tanned skin, he was tall for his age and beautiful black curls always slicked back with hair products. He had a small following that would bother Luciano, demanding he would do their homework and their chores around class. Which was weird since Luciano thought he only got above average grades, not too shabby but enough to be considered hard working he guessed.</p><p>They would bother him, call him names and push him around when teachers were not looking, he didn't say anything about it thought because he was used to these sort of things around his hometown.</p><p>''Hey!'' Thiago yelled at him when class was over and the teachers were long gone. ''Ugly rat face! get this list of ingredients for me by the end of next class, will you?'' he said shoving a piece of parchment on his hands.</p><p>He read it and realized something quickly. ''But, we were supposed to prepare these last week, you haven't done any?'' he questioned and was pushed harshly to a desk next to him. ''Well I had things to do, now get this done before I put purple spots on top of those ugly shit stains you have on your face'' he growled and Luciano only managed to nod. There were a few laughs of the remaining students and then they left.</p><p>Luciano took a moment to compose himself and fixed his clothes a bit before getting up, smiling to himself and getting ready to head to the potions lab before the next class.</p><p>'You have a galaxy on your face' would say his mom when he told her that other kids on the neighborhood made fun of his freckles. He tried to think about that as he made his way quickly before the next class started.</p><p>He never told his mom what was going on at this school. No, he wanted to act like all was well and he was happy, he had to endure it until he graduated! he needed to graduate and get a good job soon so he could give his mom a good life! he was a muggleborn but he knew that the magic community wouldn't have a problem if he were to live on a house among muggles as he takes care of his mother and works to support her.</p><p>He smiled. Yes! that is the dream, getting a house out of that small alleyway, out of that neighborhood and out of that life. All he was doing was for that work, so he didn't bothered with bullies that wanted their homework done, if anything it would help him study so he can get better grades and therefore more opportunities at a better job.</p><p>He knocked the door of the lab and it was opened by Monsieur Monte who smiled down at him. ''Luciano, my child! at what do I own the pleasure? you know class doesn't start until next period, right?'' he asked and Luciano nodded smiling back at him. </p><p>Monsieur Monte was a tall blonde man with kind greenish eyes and an ability with creating potions so powerful it still blew Luciano's mind.  He had a thick french accent and Luciano was glad the palace had many spells that made them understand each other as well as other students since the school had students from many backgrounds and different speaking languages.</p><p>''I know, I just wanted to pick some ingredients I forgot for the next class, may I do it?''  he asked politely and Monsieur opened the door more for him. ''Well of course, go forth, little gentleman'' he joked, Luciano laughed a bit and bowed mockingly and went for the ingredients.</p><p>He liked Monsieur Mariano Monte, he was a true gentleman and a great teacher, he was the youngest of the teachers but he had such a great and fun personality that made many students fall in love with his classes.</p><p>Luciano quickly took the ingredients and said his goodbyes as he had to head for the next class. Rushing through the hallway, the old shoes that his mom repainted to look like the uniform shoes making patting sounds on the tiles of the floor. He rushed through the hallways and dodged quickly when someone came out of a classroom in a sudden manner.</p><p>''Ah, sorry about that, ah you!'' said an older boy with a french accent.</p><p>Luciano wanted to die!</p><p>Ok let me rewind a bit before explaining who is this. There is a thing a bout Luciano... he knew he was gay since he was even younger than he was right now. He knew he liked other boys at school or his neighborhood but he only ever told his mother about this fact. She was alright with it of course but he refrained from telling anyone else since he had enough things to worry about at his old neighborhood.</p><p>He was so happy when he found out that in the wizarding community they didn't cared much about who dated who and so he permitted himself to be himself once in his life... and being himself meant liking boys... boys like this one right here.</p><p>Nolan Fabron was, perfection!</p><p>Imagine a boy with dark golden hair with beautiful almost white blue eyes, golden skin with a beauty mark on his lower lip. His uniform always clean and shiny smile, manners and grades at the top of his year and on top of all of that a golden heart. He looked like a young Benjamin Rojas, an actor from Argentina that his mom watched on tv on old reruns of soap operas.</p><p>''Hi!'' Luciano said with a smile with his toothy grin.  Nolan looked at him with a weird face and covered his mouth not to made it twist with disgust, something that Luciano didn't noticed.</p><p>Nolan seemed ready to get out of there without saying anything when the voices of his classmates came from behind. ''Hey, hurry, we are going to be late'' said a boy coming behind him. ''Sure!'' Nolan said smiling at him and then smiled at Luciano. ''Please, do be more careful next time, we don't want you to get hurt'' he directed a prince charming smile at him and walked with his friends following close.</p><p>Luciano almost melted there. And don't get him wrong, he knew it perfectly well. He knew that Nolan was a boy who acted nice when other people were looking at him but whenever they crossed paths on the hallways and it was only the two of them he ignored Luciano like it was a bug on the floor.</p><p>Luciano was alright with it though, he didn't expect anything anyways so he was content to only get that fake amount of attention he could get from his crush whenever other people were around. Only a hello, or a good afternoon, a goodbye or a have a nice day on the hallways were sufficient for him to become a puddle in the floor.</p><p>It was fake, but for someone ugly like him it was all he could wish for.</p><p>He tried to walk quickly to his next class but was trampled by someone and pushed to the side almost dropping everything on his hands. A hand slammed on the wall next to him and he looked up to see a tall blonde girl looking at him with disgust. ''I thought I told you to stop talking to Nolan!'' she said.</p><p>He swallowed hard. Estrella DelaCoste, she was in fact the most beautiful girl on year two, her wavy red hair and eyes that look like a forest were admired by everyone at the school. Not to mention she was part of one of the longest line of purebloods in the country and her family owned several business. She was rich, beautiful and hated Luciano even more than Thiago.</p><p>''I- I'' he tried to say something but she quickly grabbed his shoulder and pressed on it, hard.</p><p>''Stay away from him freak, or I break you and whatever muggle family you have as well'' she threatened and threw the ingredients he had on the floor and walked away.</p><p>'Alright, breathe in and breathe out, things are alright' he told himself picking the things up. Things are alright, always! smile and keep going, you have a goal and things will turn out alright...' </p><p>He smiled again and went to class.</p><p>.</p><p>It seemed things were against Luciano, it always seemed like that, but he tried to remain positive, sure, people seemed not to like him and days got hard sometimes but he received a note from his mom everyday from  owls he borrowed from the school, the teachers were nice enough and seemed happy with his work and even he managed to make friends! so not all was bad!</p><p>Sure, people called them the ugly squad but he thought that all of them were bautiful on their own way. They met everyday on the gardens to eat and chat and would see each other on classes.</p><p>They were two kids. Marianne Laveau, a pureblood girl with a tall very tall lanky frame, named after the queen of vudu Marie Catherine  Laveau and with an old history of magic behind her. Even with that background it seemed the rest of the students didn't fancied her frizzy hair or bubbly personality and they let her know that. People would say she was meddlesome and annoying, loud and obnoxious but all Luciano could see was a girl who seeked knowledge and wanted to party and be happy.</p><p>The other one was called Aitor Cardona. A boy from Barcelona who was short, fat with puffy cheeks and pink skin and according to his classmates, a dirty pervert. They spread rumors of him looking under people's skirts when they went up the stairs of the palace or trying to sneak a peak on the girls swimming lessons, in reality, Luciano knew that those things were accidents.</p><p>Aitor was only on the wrong place at the wrong time, he was a shy kid that ends on situations that he didn't ask to be in the first place, the incident with the skirts happened because he was running away from some guys who wanted to to transfigure his tummy into a bongo and he hid behind the stairs when a girl passed by and saw him she yelled saying that she was a pervert. And yeah, he did ended up seeing something under that skirt but he got so embarrassed he didn't went to class for two days.</p><p>The pool thing was the same, he got lost trying to find the way to the park outside the school and ended up near the sport area without noticing, he came from some bushes trying to find his way and when he though he found it he realized he was on the fence of the girls pool lesson. Again they screamed and called for help and he missed an entire week from embarrassment.</p><p>''Ran into trouble?'' Marianne asked with her nasal voice as she threw a dice for some game she was playing with Aitor. Luciano smiled at her ''Not at all, what makes you think that?'' he asked feigning innocence. </p><p>Aitor looked down and pointed to his shoulder. ''There's a burnt mark there'' he said hiding his face a bit. Luciano looked and indeed his shoulder had a burnt mark on his shoulder, damn it was probably Estrella using some after burnt spell when she grabbed him. </p><p>''Ah, this is a... potions accident!'' he lied to them with a smile.</p><p>Aitor looked sad while Marianne looked annoyed. ''Oh fuck no! look this is not alright! if they are still bullying you we should speak out!'' she said clenching her fists.</p><p>''And tell who? my mom? they won't let muggles here to see the graduation ceremony when they finish school let alone they would let her get in to complain with Madame'' he reasoned and sat on the grass with them.</p><p>He put his hands on his shoulders. ''I'm fine, it will take more than a few pushes to break me, I'm sure of it'' he said.</p><p>His friends looked at each other and they nodded not being able to mimic his smile.</p><p>But it was true, it took more than that to break him to the point of tears, but in the end they did broke him.</p><p>It took them years to do it and it wasn't this year, it took them until year five, when he was fifteen when everything spiraled into the mess it was now.</p><p>It was at the beginning of year five when a student from Ukraine transferred from Durmstrang due to dangerous circumstances and caught everyone by surprise.</p><p>Dymytro Kravets. He turned fifteen the day he was to be transferred, the day he arrived to France with his parents, angry, sad and heartbroken, he didn't expect to make friends here, he didn't expect to be happy here or to heal what had happened back at home.</p><p>He didn't expect to fall in love the first week he transfered with the boy they all called ugly.</p>
