</p><p>Harry and his friends were sitting in the Great hall, having lunch, when everything went downhill. </p><p>He was actually in a good mood that day. It was weird, but he was. </p><p>And yet, he had the feeling something bad was going to happen.</p><p>Harry looked at the High table. </p><p>Flitwick was talking with McGonagall. </p><p>Now that Dumbledore was gone, Harry had been feeling like something dangerous was coming.</p><p>"Harry, you alright?" Ron, who was next to him, asked. </p><p>"Yeah, I'm fine." He vaguely answered. </p><p>Hermione, who sat on the other side of him, shared a worried look with Ginny.</p><p>"Are you sure?" </p><p>Harry was about to answer, when he heard strangely familiar voices outside the hall.</p><p>"I told you not to do it, and yet, you did." A woman's voice rang through the hall.</p><p>"'I'm sorry." A man's voice answered.</p><p>Three teenagers walked into the Hall. Their names? Harry Potter, Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger. All of them were 18 years old.</p><p>
  <b>(Harry, Hermione and Ron from the future will be in <em>italic)</em></b>
</p><p>Harry was staring at them with open mouths. More people started to notice them.</p><p>"Guys, can we just focus on the task?" <em>Harry</em> asked as they walked to the High Table as if nothing was wrong. </p><p>Students were standing up to see what was going on. </p><p>"Yes, when had we agreed, again?" <em>Ron</em> asked. For the first time the teenagers looked around, and they stopped dead in their tracks. </p><p>"This isn't right." <em>Hermione</em> said, looking at the teachers. </p><p>Harry grabbed his wand, ready to attack, Hermione and Ron were ready to do the same.</p><p>"Uhmm... What is going on?" Fred asked.</p><p><em>Ron</em> looked at his newly dead brother.</p><p>"That's what I'd like to know." Harry breathed.</p><p>"Ron? Harry? Hermione?" Ginny hesitantly asked.</p><p>"Yeah, that's us." <em>Harry</em> answered.</p><p>Everyone was staring at all six of the teenagers.</p><p>"Uhm... that's not posible." Ron said.</p><p><em>Harry</em> looked around the room. "Yes, but even more impossible things have happened."</p><p><em>Hermione</em> grinned and turned to the trio. "And as I recall, you do have some experience with it."</p><p>They looked taken back by it. "Time travel." Harry whispered so only Ron and Hermione could hear it. </p><p><em>Harry</em> smiled and turned back to the teachers. </p><p>"A look. It's Toad-Face." <em>he</em> exclaimed. </p><p>The twins and Lee Jordan burst out laughing as <em>Hermione</em> gave him a light smack on the back of his head. Soon the whole hall was snickering. </p><p>"I beg your pardon! I am-" Umbridge started but got cut of by <em>Ron</em>.</p><p>"Yes, yes. Annoying. We know." </p><p><em>Hermione</em> gave him a warning look.</p><p>"Why are you here?" McGonagall asked, amazed. </p><p>"Ah, yes. I had a note." <em>Harry</em> said. He reached inside his pocket and grabbed a note. He read it out loud so the whole hall could hear. </p><p>
  <b>Dear everyone,</b>
</p><p>
  <b>I know you are all confused, so I'll keep it short. It is true, these people are from the future and they are here with a message. A message in the form of books.</b>
</p><p>Everyone was looking thoroughly confused at this.</p><p>
  <b>You will all be reading about the life of Harry Potter.</b>
</p><p>It was silent for a second as Harry groaned loudly. </p><p>"NO."</p><p>
  <b>Yes, yes. I know. Horrible. But it will save a lot of people in the future.</b>
</p><p>Both of the Harry's looked up at that.</p><p>
  <b>Ready to do it yet? Here are the books.</b>
</p><p>
  <b>Signed,</b>
</p><p>
  <b>The Fates.</b>
</p><p>
  <b>Ps. Nobody can receive any punishment while reading these books.</b>
</p><p>
  <b>Have fun.</b>
</p><p>It was silent for a second until an awful noice filled the room.</p><p>"You are lying!" Umbridge screeched.</p><p>"Where have I heard that before." Harry muttered darkly. </p><p>"We asure you, It is real." <em>Hermione</em> said.</p><p>It was still dead silent. </p><p>"We will need to read the book."</p><p>"..."</p><p>"A book? I'm not reading a book." a Slytherin said.</p><p>"I agree, I'm not going to read some book about me." Harry said.</p><p>"Yes, I get that, but I promise you, it will be worth it." his future self answered.</p><p>A stack of 4 books appeared. </p><p>"May I remind you, that whatever happens here at Hogwarts, it doesn't happen without my permission." Umbridge said again. </p><p><em>Hermione</em> let out an annoyed sigh.</p><p>"Listen, this will be bad for him without your remarks, don't make it worse."</p><p>The twins cheered <em>Hermione</em> on.</p><p>"And everything will be in these books. Everything he has ever said, truth and lies." she continued while Harry was looking at Hermione and Ron with worry on their faces. </p><p>"This is going to be hilarious." Draco said.</p><p>There was a short pause as Harry was panicking. </p><p>"Will the books really cover everything?" he asked.</p><p>"I guess so. I haven't read them yet, either." <em>Harry</em> answered.</p><p>Harry laid his head in his hands.</p><p>He would have to relive everything. </p><p>Meeting Voldemort in his first year.</p><p>The Chamber of Secrets. </p><p>The Dementors.  </p><p>Harry's head jerked up.</p><p>That would mean they heard Sirius's story. </p><p>And Voldemorts return.</p><p>The <em>trio</em> saw his reaction and smiled at each other.</p><p>"We're missing a few." <em>Harry</em> mumbled.</p><p>The doors opened and Tonks, Remus, Sirius in his dog form, Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, Bill, Charlie, Alastor 'Mad-eye' Moody, Kingsley Shacklebolt, Cornelius Fudge and Amelia Bones walked in, McGonagall started to explain what was going on.  </p><p>"Well, it looks like we need a change of scenery." McGonagall said. </p><p>He waved his wand and the tables disappeared. They were replaced with chairs. </p><p>"Now, if everyone would be so kind to find a place?"  </p><p>Harry sat with Ron, Hermione, Remus, Tonks, Arthur, Molly, Ginny, Neville, Luna, Fred, George, Mad-eye, Bill, Charlie, <em>Ron</em>, <em>Hermione</em> and <em>Harry</em>.</p><p>Umbridge, Fudge, Amelia Bones and Shacklebolt were sitting with the rest of the teachers at the high table. </p><p>The rest of the students were sitting on the chairs presented to them. </p><p>Sirius was sitting by Harry's feet after having licked his face off. </p><p>"Where is professor Snape?" <em>Harry</em> suddenly asked since they already knew why Dumbledore was gone.</p><p>Ron looked at Harry. </p><p>"Why would you care? And did you just call him 'professor'?" he whispered.</p><p>"I don't know" Harry answered.</p><p>"I don't know. He hadn't turned up for breakfast yet when you appeared." Sprout informed them.</p><p>A lot of girls were looking at 18 year old <em>Harry</em>. He had certainly glowed up. He was a lot taller and muscular than his 15 year old self. </p><p>"Let's get this over with. I'm not really interested in reading my whole life story." Harry said quietly. </p><p>"Okay, rules: One, everything that happened in the past, will stay in the past. You can't punish anyone for it." <em>Hermione</em> said as Harry's heart made a little jump and looked at his fiends with big smiles.</p><p>Umbridge and Fudge wanted to object but <em>Hermione</em> stopped them.</p><p>"Secondly, no one can get arrested before we finish all the books." she continued.</p><p>Amelia Bones agreed.</p><p>"Okay, let's begin." Ron said as McGonagall enchanted the book so it would read itself out loud.</p><p>
