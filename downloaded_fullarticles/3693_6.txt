    <p>Draco Malfoy, one of the hugest misunderstood boys of this school. Sure, he acts like a complete dick to lots of people but deep down he has a soft side, especially for Y/N L/N. The clear symptoms of loving somebody, you know the flustered cheeks, butterflies in your stomach, you keep having thoughts of what it would be like if you two were together. Exactly, those thoughts. Those thoughts are what also kept Draco Malfoy from even having a mere conversation with you, but today something has to change.</p>
<p>You were in your fifth year at Hogwarts, you attended Potions class every morning with one of the worst and strictest teachers, Professor Snape. You had your usual classmates Harry, Hermione, Ron, and of course Draco.</p>
<p>Draco tried his best to take short glances at you as you sat across from him. Unfortunately, these glances sometimes turned into longer glances by fantasizing your absolute beauty. Professor Snape often scolded him, claiming that he's not paying attention to the lesson. Which, obviously was the truth. All he could even focus on was you. Everyone says Draco has a cold heart, but for you it was surely different.</p>
<p>"Mr. Malfoy, next time I catch you not paying attention to my lesson I'll smack you so hard upside your head you won't be able to think straight. Understand?" Professor Snape hissed. The class grew silent, staring at Draco. You would think Draco would come up with a witty comeback like he does with everyone, but instead something else happened.</p>
<p>"Right, right I'm sorry. Professor Snape." Draco coughed out politely. Saying this was surely out of character for Draco Malfoy, especially to Snape, the teacher that everyone despises.</p>
<p>Professor Snape gave him a blank look, before returning back with his lesson. Draco's eyes drifted back onto you, he constantly thought of scenarios in which he would talk to you. Shit, he could even talk to you about the weather and it would still make his day brighter. He just wanted that one reason to talk to you even if it was just for a moment.</p>
<p>The bell rang, as Draco's eyes fell onto his fellow classmate, Harry Potter. He noticed that he tried to rush out of the classroom as fast as possible. The first odd instinct going through his mind was to go after him. If it had to be someone it must be Harry Potter. Nobody else, not even his dimwitted friends would help him.</p>
<p>"Potter, where do you think you're going? Shouldn't you be heading to go make out with your best friend, Ron or something?" The usual snarky attitude rose from Draco's lips, as he couldn't help but archive a grin.</p>
<p>"No, actually Malfoy I'm going to go study unlike you who probably doesn't even know the definition of studying." Harry snapped back, while Draco rolled his eyes.</p>
<p>"Listen Potter, I'm not here to torment you this time, I actually want your advice. You're the one person I can turn to unfortunately." Draco said, while Harry raised an eyebrow.</p>
<p>"Let me guess, girl troubles? I'm definitely not helping you with that." Harry said, while Draco swallowed, before beginning to step away from Draco.</p>
<p>"Isn't it bloody obvious? He has a crush on Y/N. I thought the whole school knew!" Ron perked in, making Harry's eyes shift back at Draco.</p>
<p>"Y/N? Seriously? A Slytherin and a Hufflepuff, what an unlikely combo." Harry scoffed, while Ron stepped closer throwing a punch into Harry's shoulder.</p>
<p>"Harry! For once, don't be rude. If you want anybody's advice I'm obviously the one to ask. Harry's defitently not proficient with the term 'love', besides I can be your wingman." Ron suggested, while Draco crossed his arms.</p>
<p>Draco took a glance at you, as you scattered through the hallway "Someone's in love, huh?" Ron teased, giving a smirk at Draco.</p>
<p>"God Weasley! Can't I look at them for one second without somebody thinking I'm in love with them!" Draco scolded, as a few students gave him looks. A blush rose on Draco Malfoy's cheeks.</p>
<p>"Nice going, Malfoy. You totally convinced me you're not in love." Ron teased once again, stepping to the side of him.</p>
<p>"What do you suggest I do then, Weasley? Since you proclaim you're the best at advice." Draco questioned, as Ron slid over to him.</p>
<p>"Well, you've just have to be confident. We all know you have the biggest ego, so this step shouldn't be that difficult for you. Then, you have to make simple small talk. Get to know them, their interests, anything at all really. When the time is right you can ask them to hang out." Ron advised, while Harry gave him a glare.</p>
<p>Draco took a deep sigh "I can't believe I'm about to take advice from a Weasley, but I'll attempt it. I never thought I would thank you for anything but I suppose thanks for the advice." Draco responded, while Harry headed off into the hallways.</p>
<p>Ron shot a glance at him as he hurried away "God, can't he ever stick with me for once? Anyways, it's not just an attempt with my advice. It's a successful plan. You've got this, Malfoy." Ron said, before following Harry in the hallway.</p>
<p>Draco swallowed, before adventuring to find you in the hallway. Time felt like it was frozen still, when Draco saw you pass by in the hallways "Y/N?" Draco called out, your head turned to him quickly.</p>
<p>"Huh? Draco Malfoy? You never use first names on anybody. That's quite particular." You said, while Draco stood there dumbfounded by just that one thing you said. You swear you could hear his heart pound from where you were standing.</p>
<p>"Maybe that's because you're the one person in this school that doesn't act like a absolute fool." Draco blurted out, as a smirk appeared on your face gazing at Draco. Wow, good job Draco you just exposed yourself in the very FIRST sentence.</p>
<p>"Oh, really? That must be a compliment coming from you. You're truly flattering, Draco." You teased, while Draco's face began to become flushed.</p>
<p>"Correct, I mean, you're delusional." His palms were sweating, he has never acted like this before around anybody. The usual routine was to insult them and move on, maybe even slip out a curse word against them, but this? This was way out of his character.</p>
<p>"Delusional? I think someone's getting quite nervous. Don't you think?" You teased, as Draco gulped. You noticed how shaky his hands were.</p>
<p>You grappled onto his hand, giving him a smile "Draco, I know how you feel about me. It's been obvious since the day I came here. I'm not sure how we can have a date in Hogwarts, but why don't you meet me in the library or something like that? I promise you, it will be the date you hoped for." You suggested, giving him a wink. </p>
<p>"Oh, whatever you say, L/N." His face was still flustered, with large spots of red all across his face. You nodded your head slightly, giving him a quick peck on the cheek.</p>
<p>"Now, that's the Draco Malfoy I know." You said, before slipping your hand out of his, walking deeper into the hallways. You squealed internally. You had a date with Draco Malfoy, the secretly softest boy of this whole school.</p>
