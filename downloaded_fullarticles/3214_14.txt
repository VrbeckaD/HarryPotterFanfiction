And this year, the burden inside of him would weigh even more as he returns to Hogwarts. </p><p>   </p><p>   Cho Chang's angry with him thinking that Harry now hates her for the betrayal she has done; his suspension from the Quidditch games because of his lack of focus at his devastated state; the new DADA professor who is seemingly worse than anyone they've ever had before and one who seemingly harbors a secret of her own; the Potions Master's scrutinizing attribute and his hatred for Harry that seems to grow at every Occlumency lesson; his lack of communication from the Order of the Phoenix where he thinks they could no longer trust him with plans; Remus Lupin's seeming indifference towards him after the death of his last remaining bestfriend and the thread of the Dark Lord's growing power. </p><p>  But all is never enough.

But when Harry tries to tell someone about all of it, the mysterious apparitions disappear. </p><p>  Even his friends begin to abandon him in belief that because of grief, he has finally ran mad. Until one by one, students and staff begin to receive the same threats and claims to see the same apparitions that Harry sees.  Whispers and murmurs spread that a legendary woman called the bride of Judas returns at Hogwarts seeking revenge until the misty figure garbed in a bloody wedding dress is proven to be a human by its almost victim. </p><p> The rumors had turned into pranks that turned into a conclusion that someone at Hogwarts had become obsessed into bringing the legendary killer into life by eliciting the same method it does. But pranks soon die as attacks become more serious, more haunting. </p><p> </p><p>   Someone at Hogwarts rolls the 30 silver coins to warn and initiate the murder. But who amongst the many faces with different motives could be the real culprit behind the bloody veil? </p><p> </p><p>A secret past in the time of the Marauders draws the Golden trio deeper into the mystery that makes Harry feel terrified that after every attack, he only becomes closer to the culprit that he simply never suspects. </p><p> </p><p>Walk with Harry in the midst of the night as he reunites with Dumbledore's Army in order to solve the mystery that is haunting the once safest place in the Wizarding World.
