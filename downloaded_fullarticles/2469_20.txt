    <p>It’s already sixth year. Holy shit. I don’t realize how little time we have left at Hogwarts until we’re talking about it in the Gryffindor common room. </p><p>“Less than two years,” James mentions.</p><p>“Bloody hell, we better get our shit together,” Sirius adds.</p><p>Remus and I chuckle, and James seems to take it seriously—to impress Lily Evans, no doubt. I have to admit, it would be nice of him to stop hexing random students simply because he can.</p><p>The four of us have been friends since our first year. In second year, we all found out about Remus’s condition and James and Sirius learned how to become animagi last year. I’m still working on it—I haven’t gotten it quite right yet. Other than that, contradicting class schedules, and James’s Quidditch practices, the four of us are practically inseparable. I even sneak out of my dorm to stay with them half of the time, which is what I end up doing tonight after our reminiscent conversation.</p><p>Their dorm has an extra bed, and I’ve contemplated just moving all of my stuff here and staying with them permanently, but the students who stay in my dorm are suspicious enough that I disappear for entire nights so often. The last thing I need is for someone to rat on me to a professor and have me stripped of my “privileges” of staying in a dorm room that actually feels like home. </p><p>Sirius has his section of the room set up like a muggle boy’s, with posters of motorcycles, jets and sexy women, and honestly, I kind of love it. Coming from a muggle family, I feel as if Sirius’s room decorations should be what makes me feel at home, but in reality, it’s Remus. It’s just Remus. </p><p>•••</p><p>Potions class comes naturally to me, I usually get my work done quickly—and James subsequently gets a free ride considering he’s my partner for the class. Professor Slughorn allows me to study more advanced potions in my extra time, and while I mainly try to study healing potions and anything to lessen pain, James often convinces me to read up on potions to aid in his shenanigans. </p><p>“Veritaserum. We could use that,” says James.</p><p>“To get people to truthfully tell you that your an ass?”</p><p>He laughs. “For a game of truth or dare? Would you rather?”</p><p>“That should be interesting, we can invite Lily Evans to join us,” joins Sirius, taking a seat beside James.</p><p>Remus sits beside me.</p><p>“You two finish early, too?” I ask.</p><p>Remus nods. “Are we really going to brew Veritaserum for the sake of a game?”</p><p>“I vote yes,” says James.</p><p>“I second,” adds Sirius.</p><p>“It’s fairly advanced. Didn’t Slughorn mention that he expects us to make it after we succeed at brewing all the N.E.W.T. level potions?” I really don’t want anyone getting hurt if I fuck up an advanced potion.</p><p>“We can try our hand at it now, and we’ll be better prepared for our advanced potions in the future,” James persuades, with a tone making it evident that he won’t stop until I give in.</p><p>I sigh. “Alright, but you’re gathering my ingredients.” I write down everything I need and hand the list to James, only to copy it again in my notes and proceed to take notes on what the textbook has to offer in regards to the truth serum.</p><p>James takes the list, then glances at Severus Snape. I’ve noticed Severus starting a few times, but we’re speaking quietly enough that he shouldn’t be able to hear us scheming. With Severus, I always have to be cautious. He’s always attempting to find ways to get the four of us expelled—James and Sirius for obvious reasons, but Remus and I by association. Since it was James who caught him staring this time, there was no doubt in my mind that James would hex him.</p><p>“Don’t—” I warn, too late.</p><p>Severus’s arm jerks as James flicks his wand firmly, knocking an extra ingredient into his potion. He winces in pain and grabs his arm, watching his potion change in colour.</p><p>“Seriously? A stinging hex?” I whisper sternly to James, who is too busy trying not to laugh with Sirius.</p><p>Remus consolingly pats me on the shoulder, as my efforts to get them to stop bullying Severus are always in vain.</p><p>“At least you try,” Remus says regretfully, but with a subtle smile. </p><p>The words almost feel like a punch, but I’m not entirely sure why. I know that Remus wants to stand up for Severus, but he never does because he doesn’t want to even slightly risk losing James and Sirius. He cares too much about their friendship to disagree with them. It’s technically not my problem, it shouldn’t affect me like that.</p><p>“What is it?” Remus asks.</p><p>“What?” My expression must have conveyed my thoughts without my intention. </p><p>“Are you alright? If you’re upset about them we can—” </p><p>I cut him off. “I’m not upset about it, don’t worry,” I smile.</p><p>I’m not upset about James not listening to me, I’m not upset about Severus’s “misfortune”, and I’m not upset about James and Sirius laughing. I’m upset about the smallest indication that Remus is potentially feeling upset. Is that cruel?</p><p>Regardless, seeing Remus relax inherently causes me to relax.</p>
