  <em>— Malfoy Manor —</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He studied his reflection, a slight crease between his silvered brows. The face looking back at him was the same one he’d seen every day for sixteen years, and he understood it as little now as he had the very first time he’d looked in this mirror. He could still picture it—a toddler climbing onto the heavy chair, small hands grasping the edge of the ornate dressing table, eyes of clear grey gazing in surprise at the huge mirror, and a matching pair of eyes staring back out of it at him. He’d been surprised then. Now he was just confused.</p>
<p>It was a narrow face with clean, aristocratic lines and a chin just a little too pointed for real strength. Eyes like arctic ice under curved brows and long, almost colorless lashes. A wide, graceful, expressive mouth—the only part of him that ever betrayed his emotions—lips now thinned with concentration. And all of it framed by sleek, shining, white-blond hair that brushed back from his temples and, every so often, when it forgot itself and what was due its aristocratic lineage, fell over his forehead to tickle his eyebrows.</p>
<p>His father’s face, but with just a trace of his mother about the edges, softening it, making it more feminine.</p>
<p>He cocked his head to one side, studying his reflection through narrowed eyes and turning that word over in his mind, letting it lie on his tongue. <em>Feminine. </em>It didn’t taste wrong, not to him, but it made him wonder.</p>
<p>Was that what his father saw when he looked at him? Was that why he curled his lip, let his eyelids droop over his frigid eyes, and ordered his son to make himself <em>presentable </em>in that cutting way? Was Father afraid that others would see the hint of feminine grace in his features, in the turn of his head, in the way he wore his robes? Was he ashamed of his son?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>
  <em>If he only knew.</em>
</p>
<p>A sour smile lifted one corner of his mouth at that thought. The expression hardened his features, driving the ghost of his mother from them and leaving them all Lucius. All cold and vicious and secretly craven. Such a marvelous birthright. If only he were worthy of it.</p>
<p>He lifted a white hand, signet ring glinting in the candlelight, to pick a stray hair from the front of his dress robes. They were, like everything else he owned, flawless and expensive. The black velvet collar stood up around his pale throat, brushing his jaw, framing his marble-white face. Silver stitching gleamed opulently against the rich fabric, picking up the gleaming lights in his eyes and hair. When he rose to his feet, the heavy fabric fell gracefully from his shoulders and clung slightly to his legs as he moved. It felt luxurious. Maybe a touch pompous. But that was what his parents were going for, he was sure.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>He paused, giving himself a final once-over in the mirror. <em>Marvelous. I look like a wealthy undertaker.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em></p>
<p>With another sour half-smile, he swept out of the room.</p>
<p>He heard voices from the parlor, as he approached. His father was standing just outside the room, clearly waiting for him and looking none too happy. The grey eyes—so much like his own, yet so alien to him—swept over him from the crown of his silver-gilt head to the fine leather of his shoes, and he grunted. The lift of his father’s lip told him that the older man was firmly restraining himself from making some snide remark, though what, in all honesty, he could find to object to in his appearance, his son could not fathom.</p>
<p>“You’re late, Draco. How long does it take to put on a set of dress robes?”</p>
<p>“You told me to make myself presentable.” Draco halted a few feet away from his father and only just stopped himself from spreading his arms to display his immaculate person. Father would not appreciate the insolence in that gesture. Instead, he asked in a carefully level tone, “Are you satisfied?”</p>
<p>Lucius favored him with another critical look, then nodded once and caught his arm to draw him closer. Peering back through the open doors, he said, “Do you see that man by the hearth? The one speaking to Nott?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“He is the reason for this party. I need his support at the Ministry and our master wants to cement his allegiance.”</p>
<p>Draco said nothing to this, just gazed at the figure on the far side of the room with cool detachment. Another of his father’s political connections, which meant, another potential recruit for the Dark Lord’s army. Not a Death Eater yet, or this currying of favor would not be necessary. A tall man, lean and muscular, broad through the shoulders, with the stance of a trained fighter or athlete. He had dark eyes, set deep under frowning brows, with a gleam of dangerous intelligence in them, and when he quirked a non-smile at Nott, his eyes seemed to harden. Not one of Father’s fat, sweating, paper-pushing drones, then, but potentially a real asset in the coming war.</p>
<p><em>Handsome,</em> Draco thought, <em>and dangerous. Father won’t be able to control this one.</em></p>
<p>His eyes skimmed the rest of the room, taking in the faces he recognized and those he did not. Most of them were men he knew were already bound to Voldemort—with the Dark Mark or without—and he instinctively tried to withdraw from them. After so many months at Hogwarts, safe from his father and his machinations, he found it almost physically sickening to be so close to these people he both loathed and feared. He wanted to escape, but there was nowhere to go. He was trapped here for more than two months, so he would have to make the best of it.</p>
<p>His father was still talking, filling the air with his repugnant words, and Draco forced himself to listen. Self-preservation depended on it. “…what it takes to make this happen. No need to mention it to your mother.”</p>
<p>“No, sir,” he replied automatically. Mention what? What had he missed while he’d been wool-gathering?</p>
<p>“She’s unhappy that we had to throw the party so soon after that business at the Ministry and is worrying about appearances.”</p>
<p>Draco watched his mother swanning about the room with regal charm and thought she was doing no such thing, but he didn’t bother to argue.</p>
<p>“I haven’t shared our real goals with her. It would only add to her worries.”</p>
<p>“Of course.” The real problem was that Mother was frightened and angered by Father’s choice to rejoin the Dark Lord. She hated having to invite all these Death Eaters into her home and would pitch a fit if she knew Father was trying to recruit a new one over drinks in her best parlor. Draco didn’t blame her.</p>
<p>“Get in there, then. Talk to the man. Get me something to work with.”</p>
<p>Draco nodded and slipped through the doors, into the press of bodies. He hesitated by the doors, getting his bearings, and lifted a glass of champagne from a passing tray. It was balanced on the head of a house-elf who bobbed in an obsequious bow before scurrying off. He took a slug of the sparkling wine, letting it tickle his nose, then swallowed and squared his shoulders. Into the fray.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The man saw him approaching and broke off his conversation with Nott to offer him a lazy, beckoning smile. Draco immediately recognized the look and felt an answering jolt, somewhere down in his crotch, where he absolutely should <em>not </em>be noticing this man. He took another drink—a shot of Dutch courage—as he approached.</p>
<p>“Young Mr. Malfoy, I assume.” His voice was deep and smooth. A voice meant to persuade. “Your hair gives you away.”</p>
<p>Draco smiled his best ‘<em>I’m just a boy following eagerly in my hideous Death Eater father’s footsteps because I’m too innocent to know better</em>’ smile and stepped up to the stranger.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Merlin, he was tall! And <em>hot! </em>Draco had to tilt his chin up to look in his face and immediately wished he’d stayed farther back. Too late, now. He’d have to brazen it out and ignore the way the man was stripping him with his eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“How do you do, Sir?”</p>
<p>“I’m doing a deal better, now that you’ve driven off that bore, Nott.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Draco couldn’t help smiling at that. Nott <em>was</em> a bore. He was also a bully and a sadist and a moron, but Draco didn’t mention that.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The stranger caught his smile and his own widened. “You’ve just returned from Hogwarts?” Sipping his champagne to mask his face, Draco nodded. “I understand you had a bit of excitement there this year.”</p>
<p>“A bit. More at the Ministry than at the school,” he said, laying on the innocence a little thicker.</p>
<p>“Ye-es.” It came out as a drawl. Suddenly, a large, square hand dropped to Draco’s shoulder. “Thanks to The Boy Who Lived and his little friends, eh?”</p>
<p>Draco felt his face stiffen. “Was it?”</p>
<p>The man smiled down at him and twitched his head toward the french doors that opened onto the formal garden. “Walk with me, young Malfoy. This room is a too hot for my tastes, and I want to hear more about this… excitement at the Ministry.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The hand on his shoulder compelled Draco to follow. He fell into step at the man’s side, opening a path through the throng of guests, obeying the pressure of those fingers. Draco didn’t like being steered like a broomstick. He didn’t like being marched away from his parents and their guests. He didn’t like the implication that he knew more about what had gone on at the Ministry than he possibly could or that he would reveal secrets about Harry Potter and his friends. But his father’s orders were fresh in his mind, so he let the man lead him out of the room, into the night garden.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>It was certainly cooler out here, and much quieter. Draco sucked in a deep, cleansing breath, as if he could banish the clinging stench of Death Eater from his lungs, and followed the man down a curving path toward the distant greenhouse. An albino peacock strode over the grass toward them, almost glowing in the moonlight, dragging its immense tail, its head bobbing forward and back with each step.</p>
<p><em>Bloody stupid things, </em>he thought, as he watched the creature warily from the corners of his eyes. <em>And vicious. Only an arrogant prick like my father would let them run loose in the garden and attack people.</em></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The man didn’t waste a glance on the peacock but led Draco through the glimmering darkness to the pale, softly shining bulk of the greenhouse. The door was unlocked, and it opened easily under his hand. Then Draco was stepping over the threshold, into the dim, damp, warm space that smelled of earth and growing things.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The man did not turn on a light. He stepped closer to Draco, forcing him to edge backward until his hip nudged a potting table and he halted. The air was uncomfortably thick.</p>
<p>“You don’t want to talk about Harry Potter, do you, young Malfoy?”</p>
<p>Draco shrugged. “I don’t know much about him. We’re in different Houses and we’re not exactly friends.” He forced a note of childish bitterness into his voice. “He and his chums think Slytherins are all scum.”</p>
<p>“Well.” The man stepped still closer, and Draco felt his hot breath on his face. “They’ll learn their mistake, soon enough. But some of us,” his hand came up and stroked through Draco’s hair, “know real quality when we see it.”</p>
<p>“Sir…”</p>
<p>“Come now, Draco.” It was the first time the man had used his name, and Draco didn’t like the sound of it in his mouth. A frown drew his brows together, but if the man saw it, he didn’t let on. “A boy as lovely as you must know what he’s worth.”</p>
<p>“I’m… I’m not…”</p>
<p>“Not lovely?” the man taunted. His fingers combed through Draco’s hair again, then tightened around a handful of it. “Not worth a favor or two? Not willing to make the most of his assets?” The fingers trailed down to his cheek and caught on his lower lip. “I’d never have thought it of a Malfoy.”</p>
<p>Before Draco had time to withdraw, the man leaned in for a kiss.</p>
<p>It was not his first kiss, by any means. Not his first kiss from another man, or even the first time one of his father’s cronies had forced one on him when no one was looking. Draco should have known from the moment he felt the man’s gaze on him that this was coming, but somehow, he had not prepared himself for it. The firm press of lips against his, the clutch of fingers in his hair, the fiercely hot breath on his cheek all seemed to take him by surprise. He opened his mouth to protest and nearly choked on the tongue that plunged into his throat. He tried to recoil, to turn his head away, but the hand in his hair held him ruthlessly in place. Then the larger body moved up hard against his and shoved him back against the table.</p>
<p>Draco stumbled, reaching behind him to catch himself. A pot tumbled to the ground and shattered. The man leaned into him, forcing his spine to arch painfully, and he instinctively lifted a foot to ease the strain on his back. Suddenly, the man was between his thighs. An erection roughly the size of a Beater’s bat ground into his loins. He uttered something that could only be described as a whimper, and the man abruptly broke the kiss.</p>
<p>“You can suck it or you can ride it this first time. But I will be in you tonight, my lovely.”</p>
<p>Draco stared at him, his mouth dry with fear, no words coming. The man leaned into him still harder, fumbling with his free hand to ruck up Draco’s robe, as he claimed another plundering kiss.</p>
<p>Draco was frozen in panic. He had no idea what to do. He’d brought no wand with him and, in any case, could not attack his father’s guest with fists or magic. Even if the man were not inches taller than he was and pounds heavier, even if Draco could get a knee into his bollocks and lay him out in a groaning huddle on the ground, he didn’t dare. Not with the vision of his father’s cold, sneering face in front of him. For Merlin knew, even if Father might forgive him for physically attacking a guest to protect his own honor, he’d never forgive him for being in this position to begin with. He was going to get buggered in a greenhouse, and there wasn’t a blessed thing he could do about it.</p>
<p>The man had his robe up around his waist and was working on his trousers, still half choking him with his tongue, when a lamp suddenly flared to life. Draco turned his head, tearing out of the kiss, wild with mingled panic and hope, to see his father standing in the doorway. His attacker turned at the same time, but he did not relax his posture or let go of his fistful of silver-gilt hair. Draco was thoroughly, humiliatingly pinned beneath the man’s body and his father’s scathing glare. He shot a look of desperate pleading at his father, but Lucius flicked his eyes away and fixed them on his attacker, without ever acknowledging Draco.</p>
<p>“May I speak to you outside for a moment?” Lucius said, his voice cool and courteous.</p>
<p>The man straightened up and let go of Draco’s hair. “Of course.”</p>
<p>Lucius pinned his son with an arctic stare, making Draco squirm in his own skin, as the other man stepped around him and into the darkness. “Don’t move.”</p>
<p>Draco swallowed and pushed himself fully upright. He watched his father step out of the greenhouse and close the door. He absentmindedly straightened his robe, and he combed his hair back into place with shaking fingers. Then he simply stood there, waiting. What else could he do, after all?</p>
<p>He had no idea how long it took. He was too numb to register the passage of time. He only knew that, eventually, when the negotiations were complete, the door opened again and his father ushered his assailant through it.</p>
<p>“How long will you need?” Lucius asked in the same polite tone he had used before.</p>
<p>“A few hours will suffice.”</p>
<p><em>What are you doing?! </em>Draco screamed helplessly behind his blank, white face. <em>What the fuck are you doing?!</em></p>
<p>“You’re welcome to return to the Manor. The house-elves will prepare his room.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, but not tonight. Perhaps next time.”</p>
<p>Lucius merely nodded, his eyes touching Draco briefly and shifting away.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>
  <em>Don’t leave me, Father! Please! Please don’t do this!</em>
</p>
<p>He backed out of the greenhouse and closed the door.</p>
<p>
  <em>Oh, Merlin. Oh, fuck. Help me… Someone, please, help me…<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em>
</p>
<p>The man turned to Draco with a smile. “Where were we? Oh, yes, you were going to choose. Well, my lovely, what’s it to be?”</p>
<p>Draco just stared at him, frozen. His eyes were open unnaturally wide, his pupils dilated with fear, his mouth now so dry that he could not swallow. The pleas for help kept spooling through his head, unheard and unanswered, while the man who had just bought him from his father stepped nearer.</p>
<p>The man’s eyes gleamed unpleasantly, and his lips tilted in a predatory smile. “A suck or a ride? Quickly, now, before I take it out of your hands.”</p>
<p><em>He’s handsome. Hot. I wanted him. </em>Draco licked his lips and let his eyes skim down the man’s body. <em>I can do this. I can… Oh, fuck.</em></p>
<p>Slowly, silently, his body moving without instructions from his gibbering brain, Draco sank to his knees on the floor and reached for the man’s robe.</p>
<p>
  <em>Oh, gods. Please please please please someone help me…</em>
</p>
<p>He opened the man’s flies, freed his cock—as huge and hard as it had felt when pressed to his belly.</p>
<p>
  <em>Please, please, don’t make me do this!</em>
</p>
<p>He took it in his mouth.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That was the first time his father sold him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It happened again only a week or two later. Maybe the first man had spread the word. Maybe his father had put out subtle feelers. Maybe the Dark Lord had plundered Lucius’ mind, learned of Draco’s potential as a lure, and ordered him to use his son this way. Whatever the reason, Draco found himself on his knees in front of another Ministry official, opening his flies, stroking his cock to life, then swallowing it with pretended eagerness.</p>
<p>The next one made him sit naked astride his fleshy lap and call him Daddy. The next was one of Father’s Death Eater cronies who admitted that he’d always wanted to grease Draco’s pretty white arse. Why Lucius agreed to that one, Draco couldn’t begin to fathom. It wasn’t as if the brute had anything he or the Dark Lord needed. But pointless or not, he had no choice but to obey. Then Gregory Goyle’s father asked for a turn, and Draco had to hide his face in his arms to conceal the horrified tears in his eyes as his friend’s father took him on the plush Turkish carpet in Lucius’ study. That particular time he was grateful not to have to suck the man’s cock, certain that he couldn’t bear to show his face or play the willing trollop for his friend’s father—even a father as stupid and brutish as Mr. Goyle.</p>
<p>How Lucius kept it from his mother, Draco couldn’t guess. How much he had to pay the healer who stopped the bleeding after Goyle was done, he didn’t want to know. How long this could possibly go on, before someone found out and put a halt to it or Lucius ran out of paying customers, he didn’t dare consider. Most of the time, he didn’t even dare think about how it felt to be prostituted by his own father.</p>
<p>When he wasn’t sitting with his parents, playing the dutiful child, or taking a cock up the arse from one of his father’s political allies, Draco lay on his bed and pretended not to exist. Somewhere deep down inside where he didn’t have to look at it, he was humiliated and angry and wild to escape. The little voice in his head that had cried out so desperately in the greenhouse was rarely silent. But all that showed on his face was a kind of bafflement, much like what he’d felt when he looked in the mirror and tried to see himself as his father did.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>He grew thinner. Shadows crept in under his eyes and cheekbones. His hair turned shaggy and chronically messy as he neglected to trim or comb it. His eyes took on a certain dulness and refused to meet the gazes turned on him. His voice grew quieter and quieter, until he almost never spoke, and when he did, no one heard. He wondered, privately, if he was being gradually erased by his own magical power in answer to his secret, fervent wish.</p>
<p>By September the First, the beautiful and elegant Draco Malfoy had been reduced to a pale shadow of himself, but somehow, no one close to him seemed to have noticed. As he came down the stairs into the foyer, his Hogwarts trunk floating along behind, his mother met him with a gracious smile and a peck on the cheek. Then she ran a hand over his hair, ruffling it where it kicked up over his collar, and said, “You should have asked the house-elves for a trim.”</p>
<p>Apparently, this was all she had to say about his appearance. He looked at her with his deadened eyes and replied, “I thought I’d grow it out a bit. Like Father’s.”</p>
<p>Narcissa smiled again and placed an elegant hand on his shoulder. “Let’s go. We don’t want you to miss the train.”</p>
<p>He obediently turned and walked out the door, while deep, deep down inside, the little voice was crying, <em>You’re leaving! It’s over! You’re FREE!</em></p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>The trip to Hogwarts passed as it had every previous year. Hours of mind-numbing conversation with his idiot friends. Sniping and snarling at chance-met rivals. Too many sweets purchased from the Trolley Witch. A run to the bathroom, flanked by Crabbe and Goyle. Business as usual.</p>
<p>On the way back from the loo, he squeezed his way past a group of Gryffindors in the corridor, bumping the shoulder of the nearest boy on his way.</p>
<p>“Watch where you’re going, Ferret,” the Gryffindor snarled, without bothering to look properly at the Slytherin.</p>
<p>“Shove it up your arse, Scar-Face,” Draco retorted with equal disdain.</p>
<p>A hand fumbled for his, pressing a scrap of parchment into his palm. His pulse jumped and his belly clenched with an excitement that never reached his cold, sneering face. Shoving both fists into his trouser pockets, he sloped off down the corridor without a backward glance.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Back in his own carriage, surrounded by Slytherins, he resisted the urge to pull the scrap of parchment from his pocket, but warmth seemed to spread from it, rising through his fingers and arm to suffuse his entire body. The promise of it made him feel more solid and alive than he had in months. And still the little voice inside him cried, louder and louder with every mile that passed, <em>It’s over! You’re free!</em></p>
<p>It wasn’t until they pulled into Hogsmeade Station and all his friends crowded out of the compartment that Draco finally had a moment to look at the note. He hung back, pretending to fumble with the fastenings of his bag, waiting for Pansy to brush past him with a come-hither pout thrown over her shoulder. Waving her off, he turned his back on the corridor and pulled out the bit of parchment.</p>
<p><em>Our room, after the feast, </em>was all it said, but that was enough. More than enough. Heat and delight erupted in his belly, driving out the cold, the fear, the despair that had gripped him for so many miserable weeks. His head now up and his eyes shining in anticipation, he tucked the note away, swung his bag to his shoulder, and almost flew off the train. All he had to do was to survive the feast.</p>
<p>It ended at last. The new students were sorted, the food eaten, the speeches made, the faculty changes announced. Draco didn’t even bother to wonder or whisper over the fact that Professor Snape was now teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts. What would have mattered intensely to him just a short year ago was now a curiosity, no more. And the arrival of Professor Slughorn earned no more than a raised eyebrow and a half smile from him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Finally they all rose and climbed over the benches, trailing toward the doors that let onto the entrance hall. Again, Draco hung back. Again, his friends barely registered his absence. Weasley caught sight of him, as he ducked behind the broad back of a Hufflepuff Beater to avoid his housemates, but he only raised an eyebrow and threw an arm around Granger’s shoulders. Draco gave both Gryffindors a neutral nod and edged past them, headed for the main stairway. Then he was clear of the crowd and away.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>His feet barely touched the marble floors as he tore up the stairs and sped down long, echoing, empty hallways. He was panting, as much with eagerness as exertion, when he saw the round bulk of a tower ahead, a small door set in the curved wall. He lengthened his stride until he was running full tilt. Then, without warning, another figure appeared just in front of the door. Joy flooded him. He gave a shout of relief and threw himself bodily into the other boy’s arms.</p>
<p>“<em>Harry!</em>”</p>
<p>“Dragon!” Harry laughed, catching him and staggering back against the wall under his weight.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Their lips met in a furious, passionate, consuming kiss that instantly turned Draco’s brain to molten soup. Harry—taller than Draco by a few inches and broader through the shoulders—swept him off his feet in his delight and fired a wordless spell at the door behind him. It flew open. The two boys tumbled through it, onto the bed that filled the entire space, then scooted away from the door so Harry could spell it closed again.</p>
<p>Alone and together at last, with a solid door between them and the rest of the Wizarding world, they covered each other’s faces with mad kisses, laughing and gasping, clutching at hair and clothing, rolling about in wild, delirious abandon. Finally, Harry managed to pin Draco on his back in the middle of the mattress, using his superior weight to keep him still. Draco lay beneath him, no longer fighting his hold, and grinned at the feel of their bodies pressed so perfectly together. Harry pushed himself up on his elbows. A matching grin split his face as he gazed down at Draco, and his green eyes shone with happiness behind his crooked glasses.</p>
<p>“So, you got my note,” he said, pointlessly.</p>
<p>“Git,” Draco retorted.</p>
<p>Harry’s grin widened. “I missed you, too.”</p>
<p>With that, he stooped to claim Draco’s mouth again, and the Slytherin forgot all the teasing barbs poised on the tip of his tongue. In a matter of moments, he was sprawled naked on his back, thighs spread wide to welcome his lover’s body, ankles locked together against his spine, straining to hold his pumping cock and moaning his encouragement as the other boy thrust into him. He held nothing back. He never could with Potter. One touch and his walls crumbled, leaving him utterly exposed and defenseless, with nothing between him and madness but the boy who owned his heart and his reason.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>He loved Harry Potter. He needed him. He wanted him with a ferocity that was totally alien to his guarded nature. He knew that Harry was dangerous, a force of nature that he could never hope to control, but he couldn’t refuse him any more than he could refuse to breathe.</p>
<p>“Oh, gnngh… gods, Harry!” he sobbed, as the other boy reared up and pressed into him, pushing him to the brink of climax. His back arched and his hips twisted, pulling against the hard cock he rode. “<em>It hurts!</em>”</p>
<p>Harry drew back and thrust again, his eyes fixed on Draco’s face, and Draco felt his gaze like another touch. Hot fingers that stroked his flesh and made him cry out again, more desperately. “<em>Fuck! Harry!</em>”</p>
<p>“Let go,” Harry urged, his own face flushed and his voice rough. “Let it come.”</p>
<p>Ever obedient, Draco let it come. It hit him like an Unforgivable Curse, ripping through his body, leaving him gasping and sobbing, unstrung by the power of his release. Harry followed him only a heartbeat later, driving deep into Draco’s body and uttering a tearing groan as he came. Then they both collapsed in a nerveless, shuddering heap on the mattress and let the aftershocks grip them.</p>
<p>“Bloody fucking hell,” Harry groaned into the other boy’s ear, “I missed you, Malfoy!”</p>
<p>“I missed you,” Draco whispered. He reached up to smooth the unkempt mop of hair away from his lover’s forehead and fastened his fingers in it. He didn’t even notice the lightning bolt scar marking his skin. All he saw was the sated lust and adoration in his glowing, green eyes. “You have no idea how much.”</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Dazed as he was by sex and euphoria, it took Harry longer than it normally would to realize that something was up with Malfoy. The two boys sprawled on the bed, naked, their shoulders propped against the headboard, while they ate through the remains of the sweets he had bought on the train that day. And for a long, quiet time, Harry didn’t think beyond the simple fact that he had his Slytherin love close beside him again.</p>
<p>They were safe in their little room. No one would come looking for them or would have a clue where to start, if they tried. This broom closet—enlarged by one of Hermione’s best Extension charms and wrapped in every spell the Gryffindor Brain Trust could find for muting, concealment and protection—was their haven. It gave them a place to meet where no hostile magic could reach them and no hint of what they meant to each other could leak out. When he was here, Harry was free to simply love Draco, enjoy him, soothe him, do all the things he longed to do every moment of every day but was denied when the rest of Hogwarts was watching.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Harry sucked on the feathery end of a sugar quill, letting it turn his lips pink and sticky. Lazy with expended lust, he let his eyes drift over to Draco and watched as the Slytherin disemboweled a custard cream. He bit off one end, sucked out most of the center, then scooped the last traces of custard from the chocolate shell with his mobile tongue.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>It was incredibly erotic, and if Harry hadn’t just fucked Malfoy into babbling idiocy not fifteen minutes ago, it would have him ragingly hard. Just watching his mouth was enough to drive Harry mad with lust, especially when Malfoy began to lick the melted chocolate off of one fingertip.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><em>Merlin’s Balls</em>, that was hot!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Against all reason, Harry felt his cock stir. Then his eyes slid from Malfoy’s soft, chocolate-smeared lips to his face, and an entirely different feeling gripped him.</p>
<p>Harry abruptly straightened up. “Malfoy?”</p>
<p>“Hmm.”</p>
<p>“Are you all right?”</p>
<p>Grey eyes turned on Harry—the same eyes that had laughed up at him and burned with passion when he touched him, but now they were wary. One silver-white brow soared nearly to his hairline. “Why wouldn’t I be?”</p>
<p>“You look… tired.”</p>
<p>This might have been the understatement of the century, Harry reflected, as he stared at his lover. Draco had deep purple shadows below his eyes and frown lines cut between his brows. His cheekbones seemed to press too hard against the inside of his skin, as did his ribs, which Harry fancied he could count without touching him. And that beautiful, smooth, porcelain skin that he so loved to touch had gone faintly yellow, like spoiled milk. Draco didn’t just look tired. He looked as if he hadn’t eaten or slept properly in weeks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>At Harry’s searching look, something suspiciously like a blush darkened the Slytherin’s cheeks, but the unusual color didn’t make him look any healthier. He hitched an uncomfortable shoulder and stuck his thumb in his mouth to lick the chocolate from it.</p>
<p>“Draco?”</p>
<p>The thumb clean, he switched to another finger, his eyes fixed to his bare toes and avoiding Harry’s earnest gaze.</p>
<p>“Tell me what’s wrong.”</p>
<p>Still Draco said nothing, while Harry waited, counting out the seconds till he had to admit defeat. Harry’s instinctive approach to any problem was a frontal assault—fling himself at it and risk be damned—but with Draco Malfoy, that was a Forlorn Hope at best. It rarely worked, and only when he took the other boy so completely by surprise that he didn’t have time to get his defenses up. When it failed, as it nearly always did, repeated attacks only drove him farther back behind his walls.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Surprise had made Harry reckless this time. Instead of circling his prey, feeling out his mood and probing for weaknesses, looking for the chink in the other boy’s armor, he had blurted out his question without thinking and almost certainly lost his chance. He’d give it another ten seconds, then withdraw and regroup… Five seconds… Two…</p>
<p>“I haven’t slept.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Draco’s low voice made Harry start. “Why not?”</p>
<p>“I can’t.”</p>
<p>Harry swallowed. “Dreams?” he asked, softly.</p>
<p>Draco shook his head, his eyes still on his toes, which curled as if they were trying to withdraw into his feet. “I just can’t. Can’t… let my guard down.”</p>
<p>“Draco, what’s going on?” He could hear the first whispers of fear in his voice, and he knew from the way the Slytherin flinched that he did, too.</p>
<p>“My father is using me.” Draco swallowed painfully, then amended, “Selling me.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean? Selling you <em>how?</em>”</p>
<p>“My body.”</p>
<p>“Draco…”</p>
<p>“My father is selling my body for political favors.”</p>
<p>For a single, startled moment, Harry didn’t believe him. He almost smiled, and his voice trembled with the beginnings of laughter. “You’re winding me up… taking the Mickey…”</p>
<p>Then Draco lifted his eyes and Harry looked straight into them for the first time. The air rushed out of his lungs. His innards clenched. He almost couldn’t summon enough oxygen to say, “You’re serious.”</p>
<p>Draco just looked at him, unblinking and unflinching.</p>
<p>Harry had one more split second to register the fear lurking in those shadowed eyes, before rage erupted in him and he lost all grip on himself. He didn’t know that he was up on his knees, grabbing Draco by the shoulders, holding him tightly enough to bruise and shaking him as he poured a torrent of words over him. He didn’t know that Draco was struggling to pull away, cowering under the onslaught of his unleashed, uncontrolled power. He didn’t know that his magic was howling through the room, ricocheting off the walls, sending chunks of stone and twisted candle sconces flying, setting the bedclothes alight.</p>
<p>He only knew one thing. That Lucius Fucking Malfoy—the most foul, contemptible, disgusting, unforgivable excuse for a human being who had ever drawn breath—was hurting his dragon and that Harry was going to <em>kill him for it!</em></p>
<p>“<em>Harry! Harry, stop!!</em>”</p>
<p>The shouts finally penetrated the screams of fury in his head and brought him back to a sense of his surroundings.</p>
<p>“<em>Harry!</em>”</p>
<p>He blinked his eyes back into focus and saw Draco caught between his hands, desperately trying to wrench himself free, while flames licked across the quilt toward their naked bodies.</p>
<p>“My wand!” Draco cried, twisting toward the pillow and the wand under it. “Let me get my wand! Harry, <em>please!</em>”</p>
<p>“Bloody hell!” Harry gasped, snatching his hands away.</p>
<p>Draco dived for the pillow and grabbed his wand. Scrambling around to located the worst patch of flame, he pointed the wand at it and cried, “<em>Aguamenti!</em>”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Water shot from the tip of wand to soak the bed. The flames flickered out, and Draco swung his wand to point at another hotspot. Harry watched, too stunned by his own actions to move, until he saw Draco crawl to one side to avoid an encroaching tongue of flame. Then he snatched up his wand and went to work on the fire.</p>
<p>Between the two of them, they had all the flames out in less than a minute. They knelt on the bed in the smothering darkness, listening to each other pant for breath, smelling smoke, burnt cotton and the rich residue of magic in the air. A fresh tongue of flame leapt up to Harry’s left, and Draco fired a jet of water at it. It went out.</p>
<p>Draco’s voice came out of the darkness, small and disbelieving. “What was that?”</p>
<p>“I… lost my temper, I guess.”</p>
<p>Harry blinked to adjust his vision and saw dim moonlight filtering through the curtains shrouding the narrow window. It was just enough to reveal Draco, pale and insubstantial as a ghost, hovering a few feet away from him. His face was no more than a white smudge when it turned on Harry.</p>
<p>“It’s my fault. I should’ve told you before we…”</p>
<p>Harry felt a fresh spark of anger shoot through him, threatening to break free, and he snapped, “You should have told me the minute it started!”</p>
<p>Draco said nothing, while Harry tried to breathe through his rage. He could now see that two of the sconces were still attached to the wall, with candles in them. He flicked an <em>Incendio </em>at them, filling the room with candlelight again.</p>
<p>Turning dark, wounded eyes on the Slytherin, Harry said, severely, “You should have sent an owl or jumped in the floo and come to me.”</p>
<p>Draco flinched away from his gaze. “Right. With my father on my heels. What would that have done to all Dumbledore’s fancy protection charms? Dragging one of Voldemort’s minions into your living room?”</p>
<p>“You still should have told me. I’d never have let him get away with it.”</p>
<p>Draco continued to stare off to one side, his jaw rigid with strain and his lips pulled tight in a grimace of pain. Harry gazed sadly at him, seeing the marks of his own hands rising as bruises on his pale arms.</p>
<p>“Dragon.”</p>
<p>The other boy did not soften or turn to acknowledge him.</p>
<p>“Please. I’m sorry. I’m not mad at you. It’s…” He gritted his teeth, forcing the words out. “Your father. That <em>bastard</em>. I can’t believe he did this, and you didn’t come to me for <em>help!</em>”</p>
<p>“I didn’t come to you, because you can’t help.” He finally lifted his eyes to meet Harry’s, making the loyal Gryffindor wince at what he saw in them. “No one can. Don’t you get it, Harry? There’s no way out of this.”</p>
<p>“There has to be. If I can’t find it, Dumbledore can. Or Snape. <em>Someone.</em>”</p>
<p>Draco sighed and let his gaze drop to his hands, where they lay twisted together in his lap. His shoulders drooped ever so slightly—the closest Harry had ever seen him get to abandoning his Malfoy Poise and Posture.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“I can’t ask them for help. I can’t disobey my father or put my family in danger. They’ve chosen Voldemort…”</p>
<p>“<em>You</em> haven’t!”</p>
<p>“They have,” Draco repeated dully, “and that means I have. Or I have to pretend, anyway.”</p>
<p>“Not like this! Not to point where you let your bloody father <em>prostitute you!</em>”</p>
<p>Once again, Draco’s deadened eyes lifted to Harry’s face. Once again, the Gryffindor wanted to howl and tear his hair when he saw the agony in them. “It’s better than the alternative.”</p>
<p>The breath caught in Harry’s throat. He stiffened. “What alternative?”</p>
<p>“Taking the Dark Mark and joining his army.”</p>
<p>“Bloody hell,” Harry gasped. He shook his head sharply to drive out the image of Draco—<em>his</em> Draco—kneeling in front of Voldemort with his hand outstretched, a hideous black image burned into his skin. “There has to be another choice!”</p>
<p>“Maybe, but not for me. It’s too late for me.”</p>
<p>“Oh, Dragon,” Harry murmured, reaching for him. He slipped an arm around Draco’s shoulders and pulled him into a loose, undemanding embrace. Draco resisted him for a bare moment, then gave in and bent to rest his forehead in the hollow of Harry’s shoulder. Harry could feel him shaking.</p>
<p>Draco lay against him without moving for a minute or more. Harry didn’t know what to say and didn’t want to break the fragile peace, so he simply held his love with one arm and stroked his hair with the other hand, waiting. The shaking in the Slytherin’s limbs grew stronger.</p>
<p>“The bed is wet,” Draco said.</p>
<p>Harry gave a soggy laugh. “I’ll dry it.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Pressing a kiss to Draco’s forehead, he urged the other boy to straighten up, then he cast a drought charm with his wand. Draco followed suit. A cloud of steam rose above the bed, as some of the water evaporated, but when Harry pressed a hand to the blankets, they were still wet.</p>
<p>“We’re not very good at this,” Draco pointed out.</p>
<p>“No.” Harry looked around at the wet, singed, disreputable bedding and laughed. “I guess it’s easier to soak things than to dry them. Oh, well, no worries. Dobby will fix them for us.”</p>
<p>Draco’s head came up sharply. “What?”</p>
<p>“I’ll just call him…”</p>
<p>“You will <em>not!</em>”</p>
<p>“Would you rather sleep on wet sheets? Or go back to the Slytherin dungeon?” Harry countered.</p>
<p>“I’d rather not be caught stark naked in Harry Potter’s bed by my family’s former servant, thank you very much!”</p>
<p>“Oh.” Harry paused, considering this. “Well. I suppose you have a point. Get under the covers and he won’t know it’s you.”</p>
<p>“They’re wet.”</p>
<p>“They won’t be for long, if you stop whinging and get <em>in</em>.”</p>
<p>With a shudder and a roll of his eyes, Draco crawled to the head of the bed and burrowed under the sodden covers. Harry waited until he was no more than a faintly shivering lump beneath the blackened quilt, then he pulled on his robe to cover his own nakedness and called, “Dobby?”</p>
<p>There was a loud crack, and Dobby the house-elf appeared in the middle of the mattress.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Harry Potter!” Flinging his arms around Harry, he cried, “Harry Potter, you is here!”</p>
<p>“Yes, Dobby.” Harry returned his hug, then gently detached him and pushed him back. “I’m back for the new term.”</p>
<p>“Dobby is happy to be seeing Harry Potter again!”</p>
<p>“Thank you. I’m sorry for getting you up so late, but…”</p>
<p>“Oh, no, Harry Potter must never apologize. Harry Potter is needing Dobby, so Dobby comes. You is needing Dobby, is you not?”</p>
<p>“Well, yes.” Harry grinned in embarrassment and waved an arm around him at the wreckage of the bed. “I had a little accident with a candle. Now the bed is all scorched and wet. Can you fix it for me?”</p>
<p>“Of course Dobby can fix it.” The elf smiled and gave a snap of his fingers. Instantly, the mattress was smooth and clean, the pillows plumped and the bedding fresh. With another twinkling smile and another snap of his fingers, he sent a puff of comforting heat up from the quilt. “Dobby wants Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy to be comfortable.”</p>
<p>The lump in the bed gave a start. Harry’s jaw sagged open.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Draco’s not… I mean, why would you…” Harry floundered. “What did you say?”</p>
<p>“Dobby knows that Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy are friends. All the house-elves of Hogwarts know.”</p>
<p>The covers heaved, and Draco’s rumpled head appeared. He clutched the quilt up under his nose and stared at Dobby over it. The house-elf gave him a look that was far more cautious and measuring than the one he reserved for Harry, but that had no malice in it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Draco blinked at him, then pulled the quilt down a little to free his mouth. “Please don’t tell my father, Dobby.”</p>
<p>Dobby’s expression hardened and his bat-ears flattened. “Dobby does not speak to Lucius Malfoy. Lucius Malfoy is bad. Evil. Lucius Malfoy tries to hurt Harry Potter.”</p>
<p>“Yes, all right, Dobby,” Harry soothed. “I know you won’t tell our secret to Mr. Malfoy. But it is very important that no one knows Draco and I are friends—except the house-elves, of course. We know we can trust <em>them</em>.”</p>
<p>“Harry Potter <em>can</em> trust the house-elves of Hogwarts. Even those that are not free elves. They serve Dumbledore, and they revere Harry Potter.” His enormous green eyes turned on Harry, and they held just a hint of reproach in their depths. “If Harry Potter wants to protect Draco Malfoy, then the house-elves want to protect Draco Malfoy, even if Dobby remembers bad things about the son of his old master. If Harry Potter says that his friendship with Draco Malfoy is a secret, then the house-elves will keep this secret, even if Dobby thinks it is dangerous and will bring trouble to Harry Potter. Dobby will <em>always</em> do as Harry Potter asks.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Dobby.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Draco said, quietly, “thank you.”</p>
<p>Dobby bobbed his head in something that was not quite a bow and disappeared with a crack.</p>
<p>Harry stared at the spot where his house-elf friend had been a moment before, his face bemused. “Blimey,” he finally said.</p>
<p>Draco’s wide eyes fixed on him over the top of the quilt. “Are we worried?”</p>
<p>Harry swallowed, looked around helplessly, then shrugged and tried to smile. “I don’t think so. I trust Dobby.”</p>
<p>“And the rest of them?”</p>
<p>“Well, they must’ve known for a while and they haven’t said anything.”</p>
<p>“That’s true.” Draco pondered this new information for a long minute, his eyes guarded and the rest of his expression well-hidden behind the quilt—not that Harry would have been able to read it anyway—then he ventured, “It’ll take some getting used to, trusting house-elves.”</p>
<p>Harry grinned as he stripped off his robe and crawled beneath the covers. “Dobby’s a good one to start with. He’s a free elf, so he doesn’t owe obedience to anyone.”</p>
<p>“Except you.”</p>
<p>“That’s not obedience. That’s friendship.”</p>
<p>Draco was waiting for him in the warmth of the bed. He was still shivering, from nerves if not from cold, and he came eagerly into Harry’s arms. Curled close to his Gryffindor lover’s taller body, he closed his eyes in relief.</p>
<p>Harry held him tightly, savoring his closeness, and asked, “Do you want the candles out?”</p>
<p>Draco hesitated, a kind of coiled wariness in his body that wasn’t quite fear, then<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>murmured, “Okay.”</p>
<p>“We can leave them lit. I don’t mind.”</p>
<p>“No. The dark will help.”</p>
<p>“With what?”</p>
<p>Draco didn’t answer, so Harry reached for his wand. One flick, and they were plunged into near-darkness once again. He tucked the wand back under his pillow, gathered Draco a little closer in his arms, and closed his eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>He was relaxing, drifting toward sleep, when a quiet voice came to him out of the darkness. “I’m sorry, Harry.”</p>
<p>His eyes snapped open to frown at the invisible ceiling. Draco was apologizing. Draco? <em>Apologizing? </em>Fuck. This was not good.</p>
<p>“For what?”</p>
<p>“Letting you shag me without telling you.”</p>
<p>Harry gave a snort of laughter, ruffling the pale hair tickling his chin. “Don’t be daft. I don’t care about that.”</p>
<p>“I should’ve told you.”</p>
<p>“Do you think I wouldn’t have shagged you, if I’d known? Shall I shag you again, right this minute, and prove you wrong?”</p>
<p>“Do you really want to?”</p>
<p>Another soft, snorting laugh rose in his throat. He grabbed Draco’s hand and guided it down to his crotch, where his cock was already stirring. “Can you doubt me?”</p>
<p>Draco withdrew his hand, tucking it under his chin. “You wouldn’t, if you knew.”</p>
<p>“Knew what? Tell me.”</p>
<p>“I can’t.”</p>
<p>“Dragon.” Harry clasped his head and urged it up, searching for the gleam of moonlight in winter-grey eyes. “Don’t do this. Don’t lie there worrying all night, when you know you can tell me anything.”</p>
<p>“Not this.”</p>
<p>“Yes, this. <em>Anything.</em> We’ll both sleep better, if you do.”</p>
<p>“You’re such a sodding Gryffindor.”</p>
<p>Harry knew he was supposed to respond to that with a chuckle or an answering dig, but he couldn’t manage it. He was too unnerved by the echo of pain in Draco’s voice. “And you’re scaring me.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Harry, you…” His eyes, barely visible in the shadows, shone at Harry with something suspiciously like tears in them. “You won’t like it.”</p>
<p>“I’d got that far on my own. Just get it over with quick, like tearing off a band-aid.”</p>
<p>“A what?”</p>
<p>“Never mind. It’s a Muggle thing. Tell me what’s got you so spooked, Dragon.”</p>
<p>The Slytherin stared at him for another long moment, then swallowed painfully and began to speak. His voice was low and soft, little more than a whisper, but Harry could hear every word with shattering clarity.</p>
<p>“You think my father forced me, but it wasn’t like that. He didn’t. None of them did. I hated every second of it, but I did it of my own free will.”</p>
<p>“Why?” The question was no more than a breath on the chill air, fraught with hurt and disbelief.</p>
<p>“I was afraid. I don’t know how to stand up to my father, I never have, and now he has the Dark Lord behind him… I thought, if I refused, the punishment would be much worse…”</p>
<p>“Worse than rape?”</p>
<p>“It wasn’t rape. I told you, I didn’t fight it. I didn’t even say no. That means, I consented.”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t!” Harry pushed himself upright, forcing Draco to sit up with him, and caught his head between his hands. “There are all kinds of ways to hurt another person, to force them to do things they would never do by their own choice. Listen to me, Draco. <em>Listen to me!</em>” He gave the other boy a little shake and threw all his persuasive power into his voice. “Your father didn’t ask you if you wanted him to sell your body, he just <em>did it. </em>You went along with it, because you were <em>afraid.</em> That’s rape, in my book!”</p>
<p>Draco shook his head, pulling free of Harry’s hands in the process. “You don’t understand. I did everything. I sucked them and kissed them and let them put their fingers in me. I got hard. Sometimes I came. I didn’t want to, but my body just… reacted. And when it got really bad…” He broke off, his eyes skating away.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Harry reached up to stroke his cheek with infinite gentleness. “What?”</p>
<p>Tears began to slip between his lashes, painting streaks of moonlight on his cheeks. “I closed my eyes and pretended it was you.”</p>
<p>“Oh, Dragon,” Harry breathed. He leaned in to brush a kiss to Draco’s lips, but the other boy pulled sharply away.</p>
<p>“No. I can’t!”</p>
<p>“Can’t what?” He slipped both arms around Draco’s shoulders and drew him close. “Kiss me? That’s mental.”</p>
<p>“You don’t know where my lips have been,” Draco snapped, his voice a furious lash against his lover’s unprotected flesh.</p>
<p>Harry ignored the harshness of his words and moved again to kiss him. “Yes, I do, and I want them. Want you.”</p>
<p>This time, Draco could not resist him. He sank into the offered kiss, groaning with pleasure when Harry’s tongue slid into his mouth. He was breathing hard, his cock rising stiffly from between his thighs, by the time Harry pulled away again.</p>
<p>The Gryffindor nibbled along his jaw to his ear, fingers tracing lines of heat down his bare back, and murmured, “Let me show you how much I want you.”</p>
<p>“No. Please,” Draco moaned.</p>
<p>Harry instantly sat back and fixed him with fierce, burning eyes. “You want me to stop? I will, Dragon. I would never force you. But if it’s only because you’re afraid for me…”</p>
<p>Draco was crying again, the tears coursing down his cheeks and pooling in the corners of his mouth before they dripped off his chin. He swallowed, fighting for control, and whispered, “I can’t do this to you.”</p>
<p>“You’re not doing anything. I am, and I <em>want </em>to do it! I want to give you something just for you. Something to remind you how much I love you.”</p>
<p>“Harry…”</p>
<p>“No, shh. No more about what your father did, or those men, or how you let it happen. You’re here with me, now, where you belong, and I won’t let them ruin us. I won’t let them hurt you anymore.”</p>
<p>“Bloody hell!” Draco sobbed, twisting his head away and pressing the heel of his hand to one eye. “<em>Harry!</em>”</p>
<p>“I’m right here.” Harry gathered the other boy up in his arms again, bearing him back onto the mattress and settling his head into a pillow. “I’m always here.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>He stroked his hands down Draco’s chest to his belly, then to his loins, finding and clasping his painfully hard cock. One hand worked it slowly, expertly, while the other moved between his thighs. Draco instinctively opened to him, lifting and spreading his knee, then uttering a soft cry of welcome when Harry’s fingers found his most sensitive places.</p>
<p>“You’re in control, now,” Harry whispered, his lips moving against Draco’s as he spoke. “You choose. What do you want?”</p>
<p>Draco pushed him back just a little, so he could gaze into his eyes, and his fingers rested against his lower lip. Tears still leaked from between his clumped lashes, but the pain in his eyes had softened into something else. Something more enticing. He regarded Harry for a long, simmering moment. Then he whispered, “I want to come in your mouth.”</p>
<p>Harry grinned in unabashed delight. “Good choice.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When Harry had fulfilled his dragon’s wishes and brought him to a panting, moaning climax with his mouth and hands, he crawled back up to lie on the pillow beside him and gathered him up in his arms. Draco groaned softly, low in his throat, and burrowed his face into Harry’s neck where he could smell and taste him with every breath. The flutter of his eyelashes tickled Harry’s skin, and the tug of his lips when he sucked lightly at his throat made him laugh with delight.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Ready to sleep?” he murmured into the mop of silver-gilt hair.</p>
<p>“Mmm.”</p>
<p>“I’ll take that as a yes.”</p>
<p>“Harry?”</p>
<p>“Don’t start again…” he chided, half-seriously.</p>
<p>“Nngh-no. That was brilliant.”</p>
<p>“Have these magic lips ever let you down?”</p>
<p>Draco laughed—a low gurgle of sound smothered in Harry’s neck. “Never.”</p>
<p>“Neither will the rest of me.” He cradled Draco’s head gently and turned to press a kiss to it. “I promise you. I’ll find a way out of this for you, and when I’m done,” he swallowed and his voice roughened, “I’ll kill your fucking father.”</p>
