    <p>For an evening in London the weather had been most forgiving, affording a lovely stroll through its busy streets. Considering that just three days ago he was chasing down rumors of a Boitata in the sweltering heat of Brazil, the crisp English air was wholly welcomed. If he was being entirely honest though, the witch walking beside him was likely the reason that his day had such a pleasantness to it. From almost the moment he had returned Newt’s feet carried him to the magic investigations floor, eager to share details from his excursion with Tina. They had developed the pleasant ritual of taking lunch together when her work would allow and Newt had come to anticipate it greatly. His backlogged work load had robbed him of the opportunity this day, however, Tina seemed enthused to hear of his progress and wanted to catch up properly so they agreed to meet up as the work day wound down.</p><p>So much had changed since Paris and hiding amongst the comfort of his creatures was no longer an option, truthfully, after mending ties with his brother and Leta the world hadn’t been nearly so overwhelming a place. Having the foundation of his past repaired, the future he would build upon it was certain to be sturdy and strong. Upon meeting Jacob, Queenie, and of course Tina, there was every reason to take on the world and continue building brick by brick. Perhaps one of those individuals inspired his course more so than the others.</p><p>It had been some months since Tina had relocated to England, after accepting a position at the Ministry she agreed to a period of probation before being allowed to reclaim her full privileges as auror. This meant desk duty for at least another three months much to the irritation of his elder brother, who openly championed Tina to the head of the department. Using the opportunity to get settled in, she had initially rented a room in a bedsit run by a kindly older witch until a flat in one of the more reasonably priced Wizarding areas of London came available. Newt was keen to see her new abode, as well as survey the area in which she was to live, and so jumped at the opportunity when she offered to have him over for tea that evening.</p><p>Opening the door with an excited flourish Tina bid him to enter, “So...this is it, come on in.”</p><p>The open flat was actually a reasonable size for this area of London, likewise, Tina had furnished it smartly and with great organization. Newt couldn’t help but let a smile creep onto his face, she was always orderly (exasperatingly so) but it was something he had grown to be quite fond of. Politely offering to take his jacket she hurried him into one of the four chairs set around a modest table.</p><p>“I believe the proper English thing to do would be to offer you some tea!” She smiled brightly and Newt felt a warmth bloom in his chest, her excitement was contagious; it may well have been her smile, though he was slow to openly admit that fact.</p><p>Scurrying back to the table she deposited a tray of biscuits while summoning the teacups to be placed accordingly. Clattering about it was clear that she still hadn’t grown fully accustomed to her new living situation. With a flick of her wand she poured for him, adding in milk and sugar before Newt could protest. Plastering a tight grin to his face he set about trying the cuppa -honestly Tina was American so his expectations were not at all high.</p><p>Sipping politely his brows arched in surprise, “This is delicious!” Not only was it perfect but she added the amount of milk and sugar he normally took. Placing the cup back on the saucer he looked up to find her smirking wryly.</p><p>“Don’t act so surprised Mr. Scamander.” Sitting opposite him she fixed her own cup taking a long draw before continuing, “I am, after all, quite observant.”</p><p>Returning his cup to its saucer Newt fixed her with a pointed look, “Yes, well there is much more to a perfect pot of tea than simple observation. Someone taught you, someone extremely British.”</p><p>She bit back a coy smile and was poised to respond when a knock on her door disrupted their banter. Springing to her feet Tina hovered at the entryway as a look of cheerful surprise adorned her features at the unexpected arrival.</p><p>“Good evening Miss Tina, I hope I’m not disturbing you?”</p><p>At the sound of a deep timbered <em>very male</em> voice, Newt’s attention was suddenly quite fixed on the visitor. Inconspicuously leaning round the table to peer at the male, he did what came naturally, he observed. The gentleman in question was about at height with Tina, hair a bit too blonde to be considered truly ginger, dressed casually in a vest and jacket. No overcoat meant he lived in the vicinity, well no surprise there, while it wasn’t overly common for women to venture out and live on their own, there were bound to be bachelors occupying adjacent or nearby flats.</p><p>“Oh it’s no bother Tris, can I help you with anything?” A polite yet softened ghost of a smile played on her face, she knew this man on a personal level. Not too personal though, Newt noted the polite restraint; Tina, he discovered, had two modes of expression: subtle and New Yorker. (He’d been on the receiving end of the ‘New Yorker’ so he learnt quickly to read her subtler queues). The man, <em>Tris</em>, shifted on his feet but his steady gaze never left Tina’s face, in fact he stared far longer than Newt felt appropriate.</p><p>“No, well, that is... my mum took it upon herself to ensure I had a home cooked meal, says I’m looking ever the bachelor. I arrived home to a cauldron full of stew that can comfortably feed a small family! So, knowing a certain someone that takes meals out almost as much as I do, I figured I’d offer a chance at a proper home-cooked meal.”</p><p>Huffing in mock indignation Tina postured resting her hands on her hips, “Hey now, I’ll have you know I don’t eat out every day!”</p><p>“I know but you must admit you eat out more than is healthy. I just worry about you Miss Tina your job can take a toll on your health so it’s best to take extra care of the body. Seeing as you have no one looking out for you I feel it is my responsibility as a neighbor and a healer to do so.” Smirking sideways he crossed his arms with a look that brokered no argument.</p><p>Newt bristled hotly from his vantage point, “<em>No one to lookout for her!?”, </em>whomever this healer was he didn’t trust him. <em>Or his mums beef stew, could be poisoned for all they knew.</em></p><p>“Tris I’ve told you a thousand times, just Tina is fine!”</p><p>Laughing lightly he acquiesced, “Very well Tina, how about I...”</p><p>Newt felt impatience bubbling up within him and could no longer sit silent as the two of them continued on, truthfully he’d felt uncomfortable watching the interaction. “Ahem.” Clearing his throat loudly seemed to do the trick, Tina immediately reddened as if just recalling he was still taking tea at her table. Throwing an embarrassed glance at Newt, she stepped back a pace allowing for a complete view of the abode.</p><p>Tristan started, noticing that Tina was indeed not alone, looking over to where Newt sat stoically. “Apologies Tina, I wasn’t aware you had company. I’ll just be on my way, so sorry for interruption.”</p><p>As he made to leave Tina stopped him, “I’m the one that should apologize, where on earth are my manners?”, she motioned to Newt and he stood, “This is my dearest friend, Newton Scamander.” Grimacing slightly at the descriptors used for him he extended his hand to the other man nonetheless, “Pleasure”.</p><p>Biting her lip Tina motioned to the painfully handsome man beside her, “Newt this is my neighbor from a few buildings down, Tristan Prewett. Tris is a healer at St. Mungo’s”.</p><p>Taking his hand Mr. Prewett beamed, “The pleasure is all mine, Tina has told me so much about you. I must admit I’ve read your book several times Mr. Scamander, Tina insisted, and I’m glad she did!”</p><p>Any animosity or discomfort at the situation presented him fell away the moment he took in Tina’s proud face. She was genuinely excited to be introducing him to someone; she was proud at the fact she knew him. A bit more relaxed Newt smiled bowing his head embarrassedly, “I’m glad you enjoyed it Mr. Prewett, it means a lot to know that others appreciate my life’s work”.</p><p>A stretched awkward silence permeated the space until Tina’s stomach chose that moment to interject, “Sorry, I skipped lunch today working a case.” Folding both arms across her stomach Tina’s cheeks dusted a light pink, Newt couldn’t help the bemused look that fell upon his face. Shaking his head lightly he mused to himself, <em>“I wonder if she’d remember to eat at all if I didn’t drop by and force her out of doors.”</em></p><p>Laughing jovially, Mr. Prewett revisited his earlier offer, “Tell you what, why don’t I bring over some stew for you and Mr. Scamander in recompense for ruining your lovely evening together”</p><p>Flushing Tina darted her eyes to Newt and then away again, “It’s not like that Tris, I was just showing Newt my new place, in fact your welcome to stay. Why don’t we all have dinner together, you wouldn’t mind right Newt?”</p><p>His stomach twisted into a knot, he could hardly say no without looking like a pratt, “Of course Mr. Prewett, mores the merrier.”</p><p>“Well alright then I’ll be back in a tick.” Flashing an overly perfect smile the man briskly set off.</p><p>As he disappeared behind the closed door Newt was left alone with Tina. Questions raced through his mind: Why was Tina embarrassed to be alone with him? Was she still upset with him? What, if anything, was between her and this Tristan? Why hadn’t Tina mentioned this bloke to him before? He now felt almost as if he were intruding, nevertheless, something inside refused to leave her alone with this man.</p><p>Turning toward him Tina rushed forward, “I’m sorry Newt if you’d prefer we didn’t have dinner together that’s ok, I didn’t mean to put you on the spot. I just didn’t want to hurt his feelings after he’s been so nice.”</p><p>Newt returned to his chair tea quite forgotten, “No it really is fine Tina, just you never mentioned Mr. Prewett in any of your letters.” He attempted to keep his tone as far from accusatory as possible, but he was sure he was failing miserably. They had written one another with regular frequency during the two months he was in Brazil. She had mentioned her excitement over her new flat and provided him with her new address, but never was there once any mention of a tall handsome male with a well-chiseled jaw structure.</p><p>Setting the table Tina slid into the chair next to him, “I honestly didn’t want to bore you with the trivialities of my life when you’re so busy with your own. Between traveling, book promotions and caring for your creatures -even with Bunty’s help. I don’t see how you sort through your own thoughts let alone having to read silly snippets from my day.”</p><p>Reaching across he laid a hand over hers savoring the softness of her skin, “They’re not silly! I enjoy hearing about your days and value your opinions above anything. You know I’m never too busy for you, if you ever need anything...”</p><p>“What, you’ll come rushing back from whatever jungle or mountain you happen to be tracking creatures in? No Newt, I’d never ask that. Just knowing I have you as friend is more than I could ever hope for.” Biting her lip she looked as if she wanted to say something else but stopped herself.</p><p>Squaring himself he prodded politely, “So I gather that Mr. Prewett is a neighbor, how did you come to make his acquaintance?”</p><p>“Well, we met when I was coming off an all-nighter and he was returning from the graveyard shift at St.Mungos. Several days later I was out getting dinner at a little pub down the street, he was there and so we got talking. Turns out we have a lot in common both being detectives in our own way, so we occasionally meet up for dinner if we cross paths or trade out books with one another.”</p><p>“I see,” forcing a smile Newt pushed on, “Well, he seems an affable fellow...that obviously has good taste in people.”</p><p>Cocking a brow Tina chortled, “And books too?”</p><p>Smirking he allowed for his ego, “Yes I suppose that as well”.</p>
