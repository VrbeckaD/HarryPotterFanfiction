    <p>
  <span>Harry’s robes billowed around his ankles as he rushed through the corridors, his book bag jostling by his side; he was going to have a nasty bruise after the amount of times that bag hit him. He was also going to be so bloody late. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Skidding to a stop outside the potions classroom, he ran a hand through his hair, which was even more unruly than normal, probably due to how often he had run his hand through it. He pushed his glasses up his nose, and taking in a breath, walked into the full classroom. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The moment he stepped in he balked. The entire room smelt like Draco bloody Malfoy’s cologne. He scrunched up his nose. The unmistakable scent of broom stick polish, a citrus-flower scent, and treacle tart, was wafting around the room. What had the prat done, sprayed his cologne all over everything? However, instead of throwing Malfoy an angry glance, as he would normally have done if Malfoy bothered him, he realised he was suddenly very angry at the blond, what gave him the right to bombard Harry like this? As if he needed to smell more of him. It was bad enough that he even knew what Draco Malfoy smelt like, for peats sake, but that’s what you get when Draco Malfoy is always sticking his bloody wand in your face. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Late again I see, Potter.” Snape drawled from the front of the room.“I was beginning to wonder if you were coming at all.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione and Ron turned around in their seats, smiling weakly at Harry. Draco had turned around as well, a pleased smirk tugging at the corners of his lips. Stupid, stupid Malfoy. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I wish I hadn’t.” Harry said, scowling. “The entire room smells like Malfoy, what did you do? Spill your expensive bottle of perfume?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>At this everyone turned in their seats, mouths gaping and eyes wide. Harry looked around frantically, what had he done? Had the Malfoy comment been uncalled for? Was he being crazy? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This is Amortentia, Harry.” Hermione began, her hair fanning out behind her in a large ponytail. “It has an individual smell for each person, depending on what attracts them.” She looked worriedly at Ron, whose cheeks had turned red. Whether or not it was through anger at this reveal or embarrassment for his friend, Hermione couldn’t tell. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry’s own cheeks had now deepened to the darkest shade of pink imaginable. He looked at Draco, the old smirk had been completely wiped off his face, replaced by a strange contortion of emotions that Harry couldn’t discern. His brows were furrowed, the tips of his ears were blushing, and he was biting his lip, hard. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was nothing left to be done, with a squeak, Harry turned on his heel and rushed out the door. He sped down the halls, the ground suddenly becoming very appealing. Behind him he could hear someone throwing the door open and calling his name, but he didn’t slow down. He wasn’t sure if he wanted the person following him to catch him, but he knew that he hadn’t wanted to publicly state to the class that he was attracted to Draco sodding Malfoy. He couldn’t believe it in the first place. He and Malfoy went at each other every chance they got, they hated each other, they hated everything the other stood for. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And yet memories popped up in Harry’s mind. The paper crane, the way his stomach flipped every time Draco was near, the way he automatically started looking for his name every time he opened the marauder’s map. They hadn’t always been fighting either, there had been rare moments when they had shared small glances, they hadn’t been smiles, but they’d been looks. Harry had never known what it meant when they shared those looks, but perhaps now he knew. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He rubbed his nose with his sleeve, the back of his throat starting to scorch. He had never cried over something like this, he didn’t want to start now.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Potter!” Someone called, he turned, and running down the hall towards him was none other than Draco Malfoy. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry ignored him and began to walk away, he had ended up in a miscellaneous corridor he didn’t recognize, so he had no idea where he was going, but anywhere was better than a confrontation by Malfoy. However,  Draco ran up and grabbed his arm. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Potter- Harry. Stop.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Leave me alone Malfoy,” Harry snapped, attempting to pull away. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Instead of letting him go, Draco spun Harry around so that they were facing each other.  The smell from potions class came to life once more: broomstick polish, a citrus-floral perform, and treacle tart. Harry’s knees felt weak, he could almost convince himself he could see his reflection in Draco’s grey eyes, that’s how close they were. His breathing hitched, and he imagined his face was once again turning a nice shade of pink.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is it true? You really smelled ... Me? In the potions room?” Draco asked, his voice tremulously low. A shiver ran down Harry’s spine.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes.” He muttered, “the Amortentia smells like you and I announced it to the entire world and made a big fool of myself. What a way to figure out you like someone, by telling the entire class at the same time.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So you do like me?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry glowered, “That’s what I just said isn’t-” His words caught in his throat as Draco leaned in, the fact that he was taller than Harry cementing himself in the way that Draco bent down, strands of blond hair falling in front of his face. He peered at Harry from behind them, his eyes sparkling. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Can I kiss you?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>A million memories rose up in Harry’s mind, both bad and good. However, with one more inhale, one more look in Malfoy’s eyes, the idea that Malfoy liked him too became the dominant thought, and with that, the moment consumed him. He didn’t know if his voice was going to work if he spoke, so he nodded once, and Draco closed the gap between them. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Perhaps everything was moving too fast, he had only just realised he liked Malfoy- Draco, but he would deal with that later. Now that he had realised it, he knew this was what he wanted. He reckoned this was probably all he had ever wanted since the first day in Madam Malkin’s Robe Shop, when he had met a blond wizard who smelled of flowers and citrus trying on robes. </span>
