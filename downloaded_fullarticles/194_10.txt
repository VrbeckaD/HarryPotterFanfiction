<p>Draco Malfoy stood in the queue at the Ministry of Magic, waiting for his number to be called. Miraculously the numbers before his, and several after, had all been called; his number conveniently skipped for the third time that day. It came as no surprise to him that few Ministry workers wanted to speak with the former Death Eater, even seven years after You-Know-Who finally died. He recognized some of the names, displayed proudly on their respective counters; a few of the faces too. Brothers and sisters, perhaps even former peers of his at Hogwarts, all of whom undoubtedly knew who he was the minute he stepped foot inside the room. </p>
<p>Luckily, he’d made sure to put a cushioning charm on his dragon skin shoes before leaving his home that morning; knowing that British bureaucracy, even when it wasn’t actively working against him, was insufferably slow. </p>
<p>He would have simply left after the minute the clerks eyed him, a telltale sign that he wasn’t going to be helped, but his business was urgent and he would not be dissuaded. Instead, he delved into the most recent edition of the Prophet, glossing over the societal pages in lieu of quidditch scores and the crossword. In the four years since he’d requested weekly issues of the Daily Prophet be delivered, he had never <em> not </em> finished a crossword. It had become as much a part of his morning routine as his tea and daily run.</p>
<p>Waiting in the queue for the fourth time around, he heard a commotion behind him. A quick glance towards the elevator and suddenly the buzz made sense. The clerks rushed to tidy their stations as men straightened their ties, the infallible Hermione Granger stepping over the threshold into the department. </p>
<p>Sights set back on the counter above his head, three numbers until he was to be ignored for the fifth time, he tried to disregard the chatter around him.</p>
<p>“Still can’t believe she disappeared like that,”.one woman whispered.</p>
<p>“Ran to Australia allegedly,” another chimed in. </p>
<p>“Still bloody frightening,” the man in front of him said in a low tone, glancing over his shoulder. </p>
<p>“Rumor is she is an Unspeakable now. For the Australian Ministry.”</p>
<p>“Makes her that much more frightening.”</p>
<p>The room went quiet as she politely cleared her throat. Her presence commanded absolute silence, Draco certain he could hear the racing pulse of the man in front of him. Uneasy tension sat heavy in the air, the crowd consumed by their gossiping guilt, the clerk’s eyes darting every which way but hers. Conceding that he was somehow immune to the bizarre Granger-effect, he was silently thankful that the attention had shifted towards her. Respect, adoration, and <em> fear </em>; the room thick of it. </p>
<p>“Malfoy?” He’d barely registered the voice that cut through the stifling silence, certain that it couldn’t be directed towards him. “Are you ignoring me?” It took him half a second to realize that it was <em> her </em> , speaking to <em> him </em> . How long had it been since he’d heard her voice? <em> Seven years </em>, he reminded himself; that was the point of him being there after all. </p>
<p>Hermione’s voice wasn’t as high pitched as he had remembered. It’s swottiness all but gone. It was like velvet, pulling at every memory he’d ever had of her. Bossy. Know-it-all. Swot. Golden Girl. War Hero. Brightest Witch of Her Age. Insufferable--</p>
<p>“Draco Malfoy,” she snapped, an inexplicable chill running along his spine. </p>
<p>“Yes, Granger?” he acknowledged her, watching the counter. Two more numbers to call.</p>
<p>“Why are you ignoring me?” Hermione’s question wasn’t the incessantly shrill and demanding timbre of days past. Rather, he detected a hint of playfulness beneath the matured octave. </p>
<p>“Why are you speaking to me?” he countered, ignoring the unspoken comments of those around him. </p>
<p>“Still on that pureblood superiority propaganda?” <em> Playful indeed. </em> </p>
<p>“That propaganda died seven years ago alongside the Dark Lord. Or do you not remember that?”</p>
<p>“How dare you?” the man in front of him turned around and shot him a look. “Do you know who you are speaking to?” <em> Lousy Death Eater. Just like his father, this one. Should’ve gotten life in Az-- </em></p>
<p>
  <em> 𝑫𝒐𝒏'𝒕 𝒍𝒊𝒔𝒕𝒆𝒏 𝒕𝒐 𝒕𝒉𝒆𝒎, 𝑫𝒓𝒂𝒄𝒐 </em>
</p>
<p>“Oh, I am well aware,” Draco shot him an exaggerated grimace as though the man were a small child. </p>
<p>“Haven’t seen you since--”</p>
<p>“Graduation,” Draco finished Hermione’s sentence. </p>
<p>“I was going to say at Flourish and Bolts a few years back. With Astoria, I believe. How is she?”</p>
<p>“Married to Blaise,” he drawled, void of feeling. </p>
<p>“Astoria Zambini,” Hermione said, an equally indifferent tone. “Not as eloquent as Malfoy.”</p>
<p>“She was many things. Eloquent was never one of them.”</p>
<p>“Miss Granger?” One of the clerks waved at her, offering her the opportunity to cut the line. There were at least ten people before him, none of them seemed bothered in the slightest by it.</p>
<p>“Quite alright. I shall stand in the queue with everyone else,” she announced from the back of the room. </p>
<p>“It’s really no problem, Miss. I doubt anyone would object to letting <em> the </em> Hermione Granger have priority,” the clerk said, others in the room nodding and humming in agreement. </p>
<p>“<em> I </em> object to it,” she said curtly, her voice raising an octave. <em> There she is </em>, Draco thought, memories of their years together at Hogwarts coming to the forefront of his mind. “I am no more important than the rest of you. My time is of no more value.”</p>
<p>“But--”</p>
<p>“I appreciate the offer. Do let your superiors know that you tried,” Hermione sighed with an edge to her voice. </p>
<p>Thinking that his time in the queue had been rather boring thus far, Draco decided to push her buttons, if for no other reason than to see if he could get under her skin. “Not going to cash in that golden ticket, Granger?” </p>
<p>“Not today. Not for something so menial as acquiring a pass to apparate onto Hogwarts grounds.”</p>
<p>“Surprised you don’t have private floo access,” he drawled, “What, with the old bat being Headmistress.”</p>
<p>“She had the floo’s shut down altogether when they rebuilt,” Hermione said pointedly. “Vanishing cupboards as well.” Her words cut through him. <em> Cheeky and hurtful. 10 points to Gryffindor.  </em></p>
<p>“341,” the clerk called. Draco had one more to go. </p>
<p>“Rumor says you’ve been running amuck with the Kiwi’s,” he shifted subjects. </p>
<p>“Aussies. Don’t play dumb, Malfoy,” she bickered in a voice that sounded eerily similar to his late mother’s. “Neither of us are deaf to the peanut gallery’s chatter.”</p>
<p>“You do realize your muggle colloquialisms are all but lost on this crowd?”</p>
<p>“Yes, well, can’t be rude,” her words were clipped. </p>
<p>“Sure you can. I do it all the time,” he mused. </p>
<p>“I had forgotten they voted you Miss Congeniality.” Draco could hear the eye roll in her words. </p>
<p>“How <em> did </em>you know my favorite Bullock movie?” he teased. </p>
<p>“343,” a different clerk called, the man behind Draco cutting ahead of him in line. </p>
<p>“Did you miss your number?” Hermione mocked him. </p>
<p>“Nope,” he said, splitting from the line to take yet another ticket. 354. </p>
<p>“So they <em> skipped </em>you?” Hermione asked, her voice suddenly indignant. </p>
<p>“Don’t get your knickers in a twist, Granger. Eventually, I will be the last man standing and they'll have no choice but to address me.” He took his new place in line behind her. Draco gave her a subtle once-over. She had grown some; up and out. Her childish features had become more feminine, more mature than he had remembered. Sporting a rich tan, her eyes glittered in contrast. Her wild sunkissed coffee hair had tamed some, the frizz he remembered now a bundle of soft curls.</p>
<p>Draco would be lying to himself if he didn’t admit that she looked good. He had a slight crush on her at one point, namely for her know-it-all competitive attitude, but he never could have guessed she’d grow up to have such sex appeal. Ron Weasley was a daft git for letting her go. </p>
<p>“Well that’s not…” she began, turning towards him. Realizing that they were no longer the same height she looked up, her doe eyes soft as she <em> unsubtly </em> took him in. “...fair,” clearing her throat on the last word, a red hue hinting at her cheeks.</p>
<p><em> Fit </em>, her voice echoed in his head, forcing him to repress a sly smirk. </p>
<p>“Ah, welcome to being on the wrong side of the war,” he raised a brow, the woman in front of her shooting him a dirty look.</p>
<p>Void of any noxious perfumes, Hermione naturally smelled like a library. A musty scent of parchment and grasses with a subtle hint of vanilla; not at all unpleasant and not the least bit unexpected. Uniquely her own, it was both comforting and sensual, scratching at the part of his brain that found the aroma of knowledge so.</p>
<p>He pulled himself from his thoughts to focus on the present, boxing away that bit of information. He pushed it to the back of his mind right alongside his questions of how soft her hair might be and how undoubtedly un-single she likely was after all these years. </p>
<p>“First of all, don’t ever assume you have any effect on my knickers,” she snapped, not forgetting his earlier comment. “Secondly, I simply won’t stand for this.”</p>
<p>“Of course you won't,” Draco rolled his eyes. “Elves, centaurs, Malfoys…”</p>
<p>“Come on,” Hermione grabbed his hand, dragging him towards the front of the line, disregarding the looks from other people. </p>
<p>“It’ll do you no good,” he cautioned her, noting how warm her hand was around his. </p>
<p>“To hell, it won’t. What’s the point of being me if not throwing my name around in the name of injustice?”</p>
<p>“This is simply a matter of people lacking manners, Granger. Not equal rights for house-elves.”</p>
<p>“Excuse me,” Hermione said, cutting into an empty window as they were about to call the next number. “There seems to have been a mistake.”</p>
<p>“How may we help you Miss Granger?” the clerk smiled pleasantly. </p>
<p>“By helping Mr. Malfoy here,” she demanded, pulling him into view of the clerk. </p>
<p>The clerk cleared his throat, adjusting his tie once more. “Ahem, yes. What are you needing?”</p>
<p>“Permissions to apparate <em> and </em>disapparate to and from Hogwarts for the duration of the remembrance ceremony,” Draco rattled clearly and concisely. It was a sentence he had repeated to multiple officials in multiple countries for months since he had received his invitation via owl. </p>
<p>“Do you have--”</p>
<p>“Forms,” he held them up. “Signed. Witnessed. Notarized.”</p>
<p>“And--”</p>
<p>“Two character references,” Draco held up another parchment. </p>
<p>The clerk held out his hand impatiently, ripping the documents from Draco’s while falsely smiling at Hermione. Giving them a quick glance his face soured. “Application denied.”</p>
<p>“Excuse you?” Hermione asked before Draco could open his mouth. Her grip on his hand tightened.</p>
<p>“This form was dated yesterday, as you can clearly see here,” the clerk waved arbitrarily at the parchment. “Mr. Malfoy will have to--”</p>
<p>“I would like to see your supervisor,” she cut him off. </p>
<p>“It’s fine, Granger. I’ll simply <em> walk </em> there,” Draco attempted to lighten the tension, pushing the clerk’s thoughts out of his mind. “I’ve heard cardio is quite good for the heart.”</p>
<p>“No. It’s not <em> fine </em>,” Hermione snapped. “I would like to see your supervisor or manager or whomever it is that trained you,” she demanded, turning back to the clerk. </p>
<p>The clerk stepped back, motioning to the woman at the window next to him. “Miss Granger is asking for your assistance,” he said, clearly irritated. </p>
<p>“Ah yes, Miss Granger,” the heavier bespectacled woman smiled, unaware of Hermione’s smothering saintliness that was about to befall her. “Always lovely to see you. What may I help you with?”</p>
<p>“Your subordinate is being unreasonable and unfair--”</p>
<p>“Let it go, Granger,” Draco growled in her ear. “I’m quite used to this, I assure you.” </p>
<p>“You shouldn’t be,” Hermione’s umber eyes narrowed on him. He recognized the look: the classic Gryffindor fire and determination. “I would appreciate it if--”</p>
<p>“Miss, while I appreciate your empathy towards Mr. Malfoy, my department simply <em> will not </em> permit him transportation rights to the school his <em> people </em> once attacked. Surely you understand?”</p>
<p>“His <em> people </em>?” Hermione stepped closer. “You mean Hogwarts alumni, right?”</p>
<p>“Simply having attended Hogwarts does not constitute alumni status,” she said, looking down her glasses at the brunette.</p>
<p>“Silly me,” Hermione said, tipping up onto her toes to gain the height advantage. “Did Mr. Malfoy not attend Hogwarts?”</p>
<p>“Yes, but--”</p>
<p>“Just as I did?”</p>
<p>“Yes, but--”</p>
<p>“Tell me, Miss Prewett, you were in Ravenclaw, am I correct?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“But I don’t recall seeing you at the school during the final battle. Parents pulled you, didn’t they? Smart move. Smarter than staying to fight <em> Voldemort </em>,” the crowd made an audible noise, “and his armies, not that I’m judging.”</p>
<p>“Y-yes,” Prewett stuttered. “They did.”</p>
<p>“Finished your degree through the Ministry program that next summer? Brilliant thinking on Kinglsey’s part,” Hermione looked to Draco as though they were old friends catching up, “allowing dissociated students the opportunity to complete their last year while the castle was being rebuilt.”</p>
<p>“It was,” Prewett pursed her lips, understanding where Hermione’s point was going. </p>
<p>“Kingsley is just full of ideas. One of his better ones was the extended vacation he had wanted to send Harry, Ron, and myself on right after the war. I, of course, refused; going back to Hogwarts to help with the reconstruction efforts.”</p>
<p>“I remember seeing it in the paper.”</p>
<p>“While you were taking your N.E.W.T.’s.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“I assume the Ministry hired you right off? An intelligent girl like you?”</p>
<p>“Miss Granger--”</p>
<p>“You were likely receiving your orientation while Mr. Malfoy and I were headed back to Hogwarts to finish <em> our </em> seventh year. One could say, that technically, Mr. Malfoy has had more schooling than you. At Hogwarts nonetheless. Correct me if I’m wrong but that would make him more of an alumnus than you?”</p>
<p>“I cannot in good faith allow a Death Eater--”</p>
<p>“Acquitted,” Hermione snapped. </p>
<p>“Former,” Prewett snipped. “Death Eater permissions to--”</p>
<p>“I testified for him then and I vouch for him now. Do you need to pull my file to see my Order--”</p>
<p>“Granger,” Draco cut in. “You’re being ridiculous.”</p>
<p>“What's <em> ridiculous, </em>Malfoy is this sham of a bureaucratic system. Perhaps I should take this up with Kingsley?” </p>
<p>Prewett’s jaw dropped as Draco stifled an abrupt laugh. He couldn’t recall the last time he had seen Hermione so worked up over something. </p>
<p>“Last I checked he is still Minster over Wizarding Britain?” Hermione asked politely.</p>
<p>“No! I mean yes!” Prewett waved her hands, trying to calm Hermione. “No need for that. No need to involve the Minister.” </p>
<p>“Will you grant him permissions if I vouch for him?”</p>
<p>“It’s not that simple--”</p>
<p>“It is. Either you are going to grant him permission, which is his right as both alumnus and <em> acquitted </em> persons. Or you will refuse him, thus refusing me. You aren’t refusing <em> me </em> are you?”</p>
<p>“No, I just--”</p>
<p>“You are aware that I wasn’t the only one to speak on Mr. Malfoy’s behalf right? At his trial? The same trial that cleared him of all charges?</p>
<p>“Yes--”</p>
<p>“Cleared by the Wizengamot, the International Confederation, <em> and </em>the Supreme Mugwump?”</p>
<p><em> Paid off, likely </em>, a collective thought came from the room. </p>
<p>𝑻𝒉𝒂𝒕'𝒔 𝒏𝒐𝒕 𝒕𝒓𝒖𝒆, 𝑫𝒓𝒂𝒄𝒐. 𝑶𝒖𝒓 𝒂𝒔𝒔𝒆𝒕𝒔 𝒘𝒆𝒓𝒆 𝒔𝒆𝒊𝒛𝒆𝒅...</p>
<p>“Acquitted doesn’t mean innocent,” Prewett tried to stand up to Hermione. “I remember the headlines. I’d’ve voted to lock him away for the rest of his foul life,” she growled, others behind them humming in agreement.</p>
<p>“Lucky him you are merely a passport clerk,” Hermione glared at the woman, squeezing Draco’s hand hard enough to cut off his blood supply. </p>
<p>
  <em> No wonder he left her. Bossy bint. All that fame went straight to her head.  </em>
</p>
<p>“Would it be too much trouble to have you review my forms?” Hermione asked in a honeyed voice, approaching the argument from a different angle.</p>
<p>“You have no need of forms Miss Granger. You are free to transport however and wherever you please.” Prewitt's irritation was palpable. </p>
<p>Hermione’s brows furrowed. “And everyone else in this line?”</p>
<p>“Requires forms.”</p>
<p>“So you’re saying that I am receiving special permissions then?” Draco couldn’t help but notice the way her tone shifted; more disdain in her voice then there had been before.</p>
<p><em> This again… </em>A powerless resignation crawled through his mind, overwhelming helplessness rippling beneath the surface. Draco paused a moment, studying Hermione’s face. Just behind her ever-optimistic and currently piercing toffee eyes lay a flicker of something unexpected: self-contempt. </p>
<p>“You are <em> Hermione Granger, </em>” Prewett reminded her as though she had forgotten. “Your services during the war--”</p>
<p>Hermione held up a finger, silencing the woman. “I am aware of my identity,” she seethed, Prewitt's comments clearly hitting more than one nerve. “Get your department in order.”</p>
<p>“Excuse you?”</p>
<p>“Come on, Malfoy. You’re done here,” Hermione said, yanking Draco’s hand.</p>
<p>“I haven’t received permission--” he began.</p>
<p>“I’m taking you,” she growled, leading him through the room. </p>
<p>Hermione suddenly stopped, Draco nearly slamming into her as she turned back to Prewitt. “It really is shameful that you would try to deny him access to the remembrance ceremony. We’re here to mourn and honor the dead, not rehash the battle that died along with them.”</p>
<p>...<em> His friends and family died there too, </em>Hermione's thoughts pierced him.</p>
<p>Hermione turned and led Draco towards the lift. “You’re off your rocker, you know that? Threatening to sick Shacklebolt on her?” he said in disbelief. <em> Why should she care? </em></p>
<p>“Why should they give me special treatment, but deny you basic courtesies?” she huffed, dragging him onto the lift. Finally realizing that she had been holding his hand throughout her righteous fury, she quickly let go as though he had burnt her; trying to disguise both the physical and mental blush. </p>
<p>Draco pointed to her, “You: Granger. Me: Malfoy. Pretty self-explanatory.” </p>
<p>“I’m sick of it,” she huffed, impatiently pushing the button to the main floor repeatedly. “Free dinners, special privileges, people going out of their way to be nice… or worse yet because they fear my connection to Harry and Kingsley. Nevermind my work directly with Akingbade or any of the other accomplishments since I left this miserable country...” she muttered with disdain, her finger unrelenting. “I need a drink.”</p>
<p>“Must be awful,” he rolled his eyes. Draco couldn’t tell which she was more upset over: the supposed injustice towards him or the fact that they were holding her upon the golden pedestal that was her earned namesake. </p>
<p>“It becomes old,” she said frantically, smashing the unresponsive button. </p>
<p>“Wouldn’t know,” Draco reached across her, smacking her hand out of the way before firmly pressing the button once -causing it to light up.</p>
<p>Hermione froze as his arm grazed her, inhaling slightly before shaking her head out of her thoughts. “They really ought to go back to vocal commands,” Hermione huffed, crossing her arms.</p>
<p>“Wasn’t this one of your initiatives?” Draco smirked. “Muggle integration?” </p>
<p>“If Harry could have simply remembered who worked in which department--”</p>
<p>“Ah, blaming the Chosen One. How un-golden of you,” Draco’s eyes flashed. </p>
<p>“That, right there,” she spun on him, pointed finger in his chest. “Golden Trio. Golden Gryffindor. Golden blah blah blah. Sick of it. I renounce my accolades.”</p>
<p>Draco let out a wholehearted laugh, causing her glare to morph into shock. “Who pissed in your pumpkin juice this morning?”</p>
<p>“I’ve been back for two hours. Two. And people are bending over backward… I’m just over it. The war happened. It’s over. Move on.”</p>
<p>“I <em> shall </em> be sure to tell the families of the deceased that tomorrow.” </p>
<p>“You know what I mean, Malfoy,” Hermione swatted at him.  </p>
<p>“Sure don’t,” he stepped into her space as the lift opened on the main floor. “Not all of us are living that high life anymore.”</p>
<p>“Yes, well,” Hermione’s face dropped, her eyes scanning his body once more, the determined rage behind them dying. “Meet me here tomorrow morning then? Eight A.M.? I’ll side-along you since I am apparently free to do whatever I wish.”</p>
<p>“You don’t have to--”</p>
<p>“I insist. If only to apologize for making a scene back there,” Hermione bit her lip, a glimmer of guilt crossing her sun-kissed face. “I didn’t intend to embarrass you.”</p>
<p>“Eight works for me,” he said, knowing she wouldn’t take no for an answer. “And I have done far more egregious things than argue with a clerk to embarrass myself.” Draco’s sly smirk spread despite himself, quickly taking her hand to place a soft kiss on her knuckles. “Thanks for the show,” he dropped Hermione’s hand, silver eyes locked on her. “Valiant effort on your part. Can almost guarantee Prewitt will never hear the end of the day she refused the Illustrious Hermione Granger.”</p>
<p>Hermione sighed, the corners of her mouth quirking upwards in amusement. “You could not?” </p>
<p>“But it is simply too much fun.”</p>
<p>“Eight,” she said pointedly. </p>
<p>“I shall be dressed to the nines,” Draco gave a sweeping faux bow. </p>
<p>“It’s a memorial,” she reminded him as though he didn’t know why he was there. </p>
<p>“Yes, but who wears black better than me?” he grinned, catching the vibrant blush that had washed over her face and turned on his heel to walk away.</p>
<p>“Have a good day, Malfoy.”</p>
<p>“G’day, Granger,” his voice echoed. </p>
<p>Hermione stood in the lift, watching Draco disappear into a nearby floo. Everything burned: her face, her hand, her scar, her core… Determined to ignore the later, she collected herself, breathing deeply as her brain processed what had just happened. She had just stood up for <em> Draco Malfoy </em> of all people, rather viciously at that. Hermione controlled her breathing, counting in fours as she tapped her fingers to her thumb, resisting the urge to pick at her scar. </p>
<p>She laughed aloud to herself, realizing the absurdity of the situation, before going to hunt down the one person she’d come back to see.</p>
