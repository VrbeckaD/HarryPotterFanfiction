</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>“When did you two fall in love?”</p><p>Hermione sat cross-legged on a small plush armchair in front of Molly and Arthur Weasley, her muggle camcorder focused on the couple, as her question lingered between the three of them. Arthur blushed and Molly giggled, her head tilting up to peer at Arthur under her lashes.</p><p>“I knew Arthur had a penchant for muggle items when we were just kids at Hogwarts,” Molly started, a wide smile on her face.</p><p>“Arthur’s always been terribly shy, so I knew I had to make the first move. So finally, in Fifth Year I gathered up the courage to do something about my crush on him. I told my friend Alice I’d give her a very low-grade love potion I had brewed, in exchange for her Muggle camera.” Arthur nodded.</p><p>“A Kodak Motormatic 35,” he said fondly, eyes twinkling. “Everyone thought I was mad for loving Muggle products, but never Molly. She would listen to me go on about cameras, fridges, automobiles.” Molly placed her hand on his knee and gave a squeeze.</p><p>“I knew I fancied her when I first laid eyes on her in First Year, and when she surprised me with the camera, well, I knew she was<em> the one </em>and had to say something right away.”</p><p>“He took me for a stroll around the grounds and thanked me for the gift.”</p><p>“And I asked her to go steady with me.” Arthur said, wrapping an arm around Molly’s shoulders. She leaned into the embrace and placed a hand on his chest. Arthur kissed her softly on the lips. “The whole night was worth the scolding I got from Pringle.” Molly giggled.</p><p>“We snogged for hours,” she offered helpfully.</p><p>“We haven’t stopped since,” Arthur said with a sly grin. They both shared a long, loving look.</p><p>“You’ve both been married for such a long time—any advice for the young couples out there?” Hermione asked, a smile lighting her face.</p><p>“It’s healthy to be selfless. You must be willing to sometimes sacrifice your needs for the needs of your loved one, especially if you know by not doing so you may end up hurting them. It’s important to maintain open communication about these things. It’s a vital lesson not just for true marital harmony, but for all kinds of relationships. Friendships, for example,” Arthur said. Hermione nodded.</p><p>“One more question. Molly, why on <em>earth</em> did you have a love potion in your possession?” Hermione asked, scandalised.</p><p>The older woman laughed. She finally looked away from Arthur and fixed her soft gaze on Hermione.</p><p>“It was the sixties, dear. A witch always had an assortment of recreational, albeit <em>illegal</em>, potions in her handbag.” She gave a devilish wink as Arthur chuckled heartily. <b> </b></p><hr/><p align="center">
  <b>1 AUGUST 1998</b>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p>The first time Harry sees Draco Malfoy after the Battle of Hogwarts is during the final round of trials.</p><p>The Malfoy’s were presented in front of the Wizengamot the day after Harry’s eighteenth birthday. Harry found that not only was everything happening in his life simultaneously, it could also all be classified as <em> awful, humiliating </em>or just plain old  <em> uncomfortable. </em> There were funerals, press conferences, Ministry meetings, and the glaring spotlight from the entire Wizarding World. <em>This </em>event however set his teeth on edge the most in the trickle of months following the war. His birthday was a sombre event, with the Weasley family hosting a small dinner at the Burrow. The absence of Fred and so many others was staunchly felt and try as she might, Molly still carried a strong air of gloom about her. Before the end of the dinner, he was three sheets to the wind, trying to drink Ron under the table, all while using Hermione’s shoulder as his personal handkerchief. Once night had fallen, he was buried to the hilt in Ginny, thoughts of Malfoy’s impending doom and possible pitiful circumstances very much weighing on his mind.  </p><p>He shook away thoughts of the anticlimactic night he lost his virginity and instead tried to focus on the many faces of the Wizengamot, protestors and finally, Hermione. She was perched beside him with a notebook and ballpoint pen in her lap. She had insisted on coming along with him ‘for support.’”</p><p>His testimony only lasted about ten minutes. It was Narcissa he owed the Life Debt to, and testifying would ultimately repay it. Had it not been for Narcissa, Harry was quite sure the war would have ended differently. Hell, he was still unsure what to think of Malfoy’s hesitation at Malfoy Manor when he, Ron and Hermione were brought in by the Snatchers. He felt duty-bound to testify in favour of leniency for them both. </p><p>He chewed relentlessly on a hangnail as he took in the other boy. In the two and a half months that the trials dragged on, Malfoy’s white blond hair had become matted and dark with filth. His already sharp face was skeletal, cheekbones frighteningly sharp against nearly translucent skin. Around his left eye a bruise was blossoming and he was sporting a nasty split lip. He was wearing the traditional frayed Azkaban uniform which hung pitifully from his rail thin frame. Harry wondered what kinds of horrors Malfoy had endured in his short stint in prison. Despite Malfoy’s appearance, though, he was startled to find the defiant glint in Malfoy’s pale eyes as he looked out onto the Wizengamot, awaiting his verdict.</p><p>After twenty minutes of deliberation, the verdict was announced: Lucius would serve ten years in Azkaban for his war crimes. Narcissa, who had already spent the last three months under house arrest, assisting Aurors in the removal of Dark artefacts from Malfoy Manor, is released with no further sanctions. The youngest Malfoy was also granted freedom from Azkaban, but sentenced to ten years without the use of magic, both wand and wandless. He would face a sentence of five years in Azkaban if caught brewing or attempting any spells. The family was also to pay twenty-five million galleons in reparations, and agree to demolish the dungeons in the Manor.</p><p>Harry wanted to approach them, but as they stood huddled against one another with looks of relief and devastation fighting on their faces, he couldn’t. He watched instead as Lucius drew his wife to him, tenderly running a shaking hand through her long blonde hair before quickly pulling Draco to his side, his arm tightening around his son’s thin waist. Suddenly feeling awkward at having witnessed such an intimate moment, Harry looked away as the senior Malfoy lowered his chin to rest atop his wife’s head, eyes closing as he clung to her. Harry heard a soft feminine sob from Mrs Malfoy as the Aurors approach, having decided now was the proper time to take Lucius away. He shot one final look back just in time to see an Auror grip Lucius by the upper arm and haul him away from his wife and son.</p><p>It’s then that he makes eye contact with Malfoy; his grey eyes are bright, the defiant look from earlier slipping away for just the briefest of moments. There’s a flicker of something he’s never seen on the other boy’s face. He can’t bring himself to acknowledge what it is – but he knows. It’s soft and vulnerable. Gratitude.</p><p>He gives Malfoy a slow nod and exits the chamber.</p><hr/><p align="center">  <b>MARCH 1999</b></p><p align="center">
  <em> ---eight months later--- </em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>“Harry, we need to talk.”</p><p>Harry freezes on the spot, beans and toast halfway to his mouth. It’s a delicacy Kreacher can’t bring himself to make, so he has to make it himself.</p><p>He absolutely hates those five little words coming from Ginny—and it always comes out <em>that</em> way— an exasperated and painfully slow enunciation of <em>Harry</em>, followed by a no nonsense ‘we need to talk.’ The sentence always promised a spectacular row.</p><p>He groans inwardly, placing his toast carefully back onto his plate and watches with wary eyes as she slides gracefully into the empty seat beside him. Facing him, she places one elbow heavily on the surface of the table and the other arm drapes lazily across the back of her chair. She fidgets though and readjusts herself, this time hands clasped together tightly, resting in her lap. She frowns at him.</p><p>“What is it, Gin?” At his question her face flushes and he raises a quizzical brow. Merlin. She’s bloody <em>tense</em> and he’s suddenly very nervous. Having known her for years, he knew that the very small, uncomfortable frown on her reddening face was a clear indicator of trouble brewing. It didn’t help that he also noticed her jaw clenching.</p><p>She gives a resigned sigh.</p><p>“Harry…we have to break up.”</p><p>All he can do is splutter at the comment. Before he can regain the ability to speak, Ginny opens her mouth again, speaking with an urgency that startles him.</p><p>“I love you, Harry, I do, but I…” She pauses to run a hand through her barely-there hair. She had chopped off her long, luscious flaming red locks two days ago – very much to his shock— to sport a very short pixie cut, the back and sides closely cropped. It shows off her long pale neck and shoulders, and she looks like her brothers now more than ever. When he had asked her why she did it, she had said she needed a change – or did she say she was changing? Harry starts to panic now that he can’t quite recall her words. They feel very important now, like perhaps those words were a red flag to this conversation, and ultimately the impending end of their relationship. That damn haircut— regardless of how much he loves it—will now haunt him forever.</p><p>“I think I’m gay. <em>No.</em> I’m sorry, I <em>know </em>I’m gay.”</p><p>He gapes openly at her in bewilderment. Before she had uttered those five little words, a million reasons for a row had popped up in his head, like: <em>Harry, once again your shoes are all over the bloody hallway, I almost tripped and died </em>  or <em> Harry, you can’t keep hogging the wireless, </em> or, <em> Kreacher refuses to make beans and toast for me OR clean the bloody house! </em> or <em> I’m too bloody tired to fuck! </em> —that kind of thing. <em>Well</em>. This was not on the list at all.</p><p>“But…how can you be <em>gay</em>? Since when?” he asks.</p><p>“I…” she starts, but stops, tiny creases of distress appearing on her forehead, looking so out of place on her young visage. She takes a deep breath and tries once more.</p><p>“I’ve always been attracted to women. Since I was a little girl, even, yeah. I was just too afraid to embrace it, let alone admit it aloud. It’s been a terrible secret to have.” Ginny whispers, her voice trembling with emotion. Her face is the picture of discomfort tinged with fear and Harry suddenly feels overwhelming sympathy for her. He wants to reach out and touch her, offer some bit of comfort even though her words hurt him. Before he can make up his mind, she’s taken another deep breath and starts talking again.</p><p>“But then I met you and fell in love. I mean, you saved me from a giant basilisk, how could I <em>not</em> love you?” she asks with a small, sad smile. “It was all rather confusing for me, but I can’t keep lying to myself, Harry, I just, <em>can’t</em>. I don’t want to live in the closet anymore. The attraction I have for women has always been there and will always be there. I don’t want to keep it a secret. Do you understand?”</p><p>He shifts in his seat, now becoming aware of the stifling heat in the room. Which is strange, because it’s only March. Along with the unrelenting grey skies, the weather in London is rainy and still quite cold. And Ginny likes it a bit cold in the evenings, it gives her an excuse to walk around the house with a heavy throw draped over her shoulders like a cape. He gulps on the warm air, his face flushed and twisted in shock.</p><p>“No. No, I don’t understand at<em> all,”</em> he says sharply.</p><p>“Harry, I love you so much,” she says, “I really do. I wanted you, and you needed me and I tried so hard to suppress my feelings for women by dating men. I told myself that I thought it would be enough to know that I have you in my life. I thought I could just <em>rewire </em>my feelings, but it’s not possible, Harry. I just, I just can’t love you in that <em>way</em>.”</p><p>Harry notes with mild horror that this is <em>actually happening </em>to him right now. Merlin, he doesn’t want to cry, but it feels like he’s a hair’s breadth away from it. What did this admission even mean? Is she <em>really </em>leaving him?</p><p>“I don’t want to hurt you and I don’t expect you to understand right now, but just know that this is the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do.” She starts to openly weep.</p><p><em> This can’t be happening; </em>he thinks to himself. He curses the sudden rush of comprehension flooding over him. It hits him so hard that he does indeed start to cry – slow, harsh choked sounds that hurt his stomach as they travel up his throat.</p><p>At his first choked sob Ginny flies from her seat to wrap her arms around him, her small hands clutching his shoulders as her own sobs escape her between whispered apologies. Underneath the confusion he feels like something is slipping away from him. It causes him to choke on another sob. This is loss like he’s never experienced before. He’s waited so long to have someone as remarkable as Ginny in his life— he had survived a war, coming out just a little bit broken, hoping that she would be the glue to piece him back together.</p><p>He was wrong, so very, very wrong. And he <em> can </em> put his finger on it, the thing that’s slipping away. <em> A family. </em> The dream of three kids, a crup, lazy Christmas mornings, intense family Quidditch games. And it’s a family with <em> her</em>, the one he’s loved for years, fought to get back to in the war to be with. All those hopes and dreams he had of her are now slipping away and he can’t stand it. He needs her. Loves her. Isn’t that enough?</p><p>This is surreal because, well, he was just about to eat his beans and toast, wasn’t he? Then curl up with her on the couch to catch the last bit of Neville’s guest-starring on <em> Toots, Shoots ‘n’ Roots </em>on the Wizarding Wireless Network, right? They were supposed to play fight over who would Summon the butterbeers from the kitchen afterwards. It was supposed to be a regular Sunday night.</p><p>Yes. He’s obviously having a nightmare right now; this can’t be reality, he thinks despairingly. But here he is with Ginny’s warm body pressed against him, her anchoring hand on his back, making this situation too real and so very fleeting all at once.</p><p>As the gravity of the situation continued to dawn on him, Harry felt like a limb was being ripped from his body, the excruciating pain causing his vision to blacken around the edges and his stomach to lurch with nausea. And oh, why can’t he breathe right now? His heart is pounding so fast and so hard. And Merlin, why is he trembling all of a sudden? He<em> must </em>be physically wounded, because her words <em>burn and painfully throb </em>and he <em>oh fuck, he really can’t fucking breathe – </em></p><p>“Harry, breathe in and out slowly! You’re safe, you’re at home, nothing can hurt you...it’s okay, it’s <em> okay,</em> you’re having a panic attack.”</p><p>Harry tries to listen to her raspy voice. But he <em> is </em> hurt. He is.</p><p>There’s some air coming and going from his lungs, he thinks. He feels disoriented, his mind racing, but his vision is slowly coming back to him which is good. Merlin, he feels like a complete cock; but despite this, as soon as she starts to rock him, he wraps his arms around her tiny waist, desperate for her touch.</p><p>“What are we going to do?” he asks against her shoulder. She pulls away slightly and cards a hand through his wild hair. Her face is red and her nose is runny; the sight makes his heart ache even more. He hates seeing her like this.</p><p>“I’ll move back in with my parents and—”</p><p>He suddenly has a thought so overwhelming that her response goes unheard.</p><p>“—What about all the sex we’ve had?” he takes in another shuddering breath as he pulls away from her completely. He refrains from mentioning that they haven’t had any sex in over three months, and before that, their sex life consisted of quick hand-jobs and finger-fucking.</p><p>“Did you pretend to enjoy it?” </p><p>“I never faked anything with you,” Ginny says softly as she sits back down in her seat, a bit of hurt creeping into her voice. She places a hand in his numb one and squeezes before quickly removing it.</p><p>“It’s a bit complicated Harry. I…I’m just no longer interested in having sex with you. Or any man. Ever.” </p><p>“I…I don’t know what to say. Why can’t we at least <em>try </em>to make it work—”</p><p>“It can’t work that way, Harry,” she says gently. “What you’re asking me to do<em> is </em>pretend and I already told you that I’ve never faked anything with you, nor will I ever. You must understand that I can’t just turn off what I’m feeling. I can’t do that to be with you. Not ever.” She wipes her tears from her cheeks with the back of her hand.</p><p>“Please, understand. This isn’t something I can change. You’re my best friend and I <em>need </em>  you in my life. I  <em> need </em> to know you’ll be okay.” She whispers the words, her shoulders trembling as she speaks. </p><p>“Okay,” he starts, taking another shaky breath. “Yeah.” With a shake of his head he drops it into his waiting hands, completely spent. He half hopes his clammy palms will suffocate him so he can temporarily black out and avoid the rest of this breakup.</p><p>“Is it something I did?” He hates that his voice cracks as he asks. He’s felt this small before. Those nights when he was a little boy locked away in his cupboard, cold, and so very alone, believing that he would never be worthy of someone’s love.</p><p>“No,” she says vehemently despite her sniffles. “You did <em> nothing </em> wrong– it’s not you. Do you understand me? It’s <em> me</em>.” He gives a sharp, pained bark of a laughter at her words. She pushes on.</p><p>“I’m serious, Harry! You didn’t cause these feelings in me. This is something I’ve been struggling with since I was a little girl. I’ve just reached a breaking point and I’m sorry I’ve hurt you but…we’ve both spent so much of our lives fighting to survive so we can live the life we want.”</p><p>He nods slowly, finding rationale in her words even though his heart is sinking further into the pit of his stomach. He could never ask her to live a life she didn’t want just for him. It would be cruel and unfair. He knew that, but it still didn’t relieve any of the hurt he was feeling.</p><p>“Is there…is there someone else? A woman?”</p><p>At this question, she bows her head and nods. He inhales sharply.</p><p>“Who?”</p><p>“Parvati.” </p><p>Harry’s eyes widen and his mouth slides open, utterly confused. He thinks about her flirtatious personality, her lovely long inky black hair, dark eyes, dark skin, and full sensual lips. He thinks about the Yule Ball and the many boys who followed her around.</p><p>“But she’s not gay!”</p><p>“She’s pansexual, Harry.”</p><p>“<em>Pansexual? </em>What the hell does that even <em>mean? </em>”</p><p>“She’s just…gender, gender identities aren’t important to her…she’s not going to be restricted to just male or female, you know? She’s open to anyone that will make her happy.”</p><p><em> Pansexual</em>. This term is one that he’s unfamiliar with but he allows the definition to whirl around in his head. He’s never thought too much about sexuality or gender. That’s not to say that he’s never thought of all the romantic and sexual possibilities that are available for a person. It’s crossed his mind as a fleeting thought before, but there was always something more important that needed his attention. If anything, thinking about it made him confused and slightly uncomfortable. He spent the first eleven years of his life friendless and locked in a cupboard, and the next seven years fighting off a megalomaniac that wanted to kill him, and  <em> did </em>  kill him…he had no time to think about such things like  <em> pansexuality </em>and <em>gender identities</em>. And really, he’d never had to think about anything like that because he’d always had Ginny. She was always just there for him.</p><p>And now she was leaving.</p><p>“Are you sleeping with her?” Merlin, he <em> really </em>tried to ask this as calmly as possible, but inwardly cringes at the accusatory tone that comes out instead.</p><p>Ginny gasps sharply, clearly affronted by his question.</p><p>“Absolutely not! How can you even <em> think </em> that? I’m being honest with you here. You need to believe me. I would never <em> cheat.</em>” She spits out the last word as if it left a nasty taste in her mouth. She leans forward, staring directly into his eyes.</p><p>“Parvati and I worked together after she interviewed me for <em>Witch Weekly. </em>We’re colleagues and friends. You know she’s doing an internship there to bring Quidditch to a wider female audience. It’s always been harmless. I don’t even know if she even thinks about me that way. And I wasn’t going to disrespect what we have by pursuing her to find out. I could <em> never..</em>.”</p><p>“Okay,” he whispers, looking away from her as he quickly dashes away yet another tear. “I-I’m just…I’m shocked, Gin. I—this—doesn’t feel <em>real </em>.”</p><p>“Don’t you think we both deserve to be happy?”</p><p>“I<em> am </em>happy. With <em>you</em>. But you’re bloody leaving me!” He spits angrily, crossing his arms against his chest, willing the tears and the flush of his cheeks to go away. He knows he should calm down, but <em>fuck</em>, this is all too much for him to swallow.</p><p>She deflates.</p><p>“Harry,” she starts slowly, “Are you sure you’re happy with me? Are you sure that...<em>maybe</em>…you don’t have some feelings you want to explore yourself?”</p><p>He fixes her with a bewildered stare.</p><p>“What are you <em>talking </em>about? I <em>love </em>you, there are no other feelings to explore!”</p><p>“It’s just that I’ve noticed some things<em>— </em>”</p><p>“Like what?” he sharply interrupts. “I’ve never even <em>glanced </em>at another woman!”</p><p>She purses her lips and then shakes her head as if to expel whatever thoughts are plaguing her.</p><p>“Alright. I’m sorry, Harry. I really am, but I’m not going to be ashamed of how I feel. I need to be open with you about this and – Harry, look at me,” she demands. They look at each other for a beat, and then Harry’s eyes drop down to his now cold beans on toast. He takes deep, steady breaths that Hermione taught him to ease episodes of anger or anxiety.</p><p>“Harry, <em> look </em> at me.” He continues to ignore her, instead concentrating on his breathing, willing the air to go in and out of his body smoothly. The burning in the back of his throat is nearly unbearable, but he’ll be damned if he starts sobbing again. She pushes her chair back and stands. His gaze is still obediently fixed on his plate but he can feel the heat of her gaze and body next to him. “I understand that you may not forgive me for this right now, but I hope that the man I’ve come to know, love, and respect will come around for me.” The determination in her voice is unwavering, even through her tears. She leans forward and runs her warm fingertips down his cheek. He closes his eyes against the simple, soft touch. It’s a touch that he’s so very fond of, and realising that this may be the last time he feels it just fucking  <em> hurts. </em> </p><p>“I’m being honest with you. I’m doing this for the both of us, can’t you see that?”</p><p>At his continued silence she gives a tight sob, as if it escaped her without her permission.</p><p>“I’ll wait for you. For however long it takes, I’ll wait for you to come around. I’m so sorry.” She pushes lightly off from the table to head upstairs, no doubt to their bedroom. He knows she’s going to gather her belongings.</p><p>A little over an hour later, all her possessions are probably neatly packed away, shrunk for transport. Harry wouldn’t know. He hasn’t moved from his spot at the table, his food still untouched.</p><p>She doesn’t come back to him, either. Instead, he hears the Floo flare to life in the lounge, her rough voice calling out for the Burrow.  </p><hr/><p align="center">  <b>JULY 1999</b></p><p>The next time Harry sees Draco Malfoy after the trials, they’re both in Diagon Alley and it’s a cloudless, humid Friday.</p><p>Harry missed the many articles on Malfoy’s registration and tagging with the Ministry. The newly introduced ban on his employment opportunities. The laxness in protection for him from the DMLE. This was because Harry had taken a leave of absence from Auror training to get his head sorted following the end of his relationship. He wasn’t even sure he wanted to be an Auror anymore. He wasn’t sure of anything nowadays; so he’d been blissfully out of the loop on such bureaucratic measures within the Ministry.</p><p>Adjusting to life after the war and the brutal aftermath of Ginny <em>ripping his heart out and stomping all over it</em> has preoccupied his thoughts. When he <em>finally</em> pulled himself out of the emotional funk that came post-Ginny, nearly four months had passed since <em>The Big Gay Break Up</em> (fondly dubbed by Ron). Harry’s quite proud to point out to anyone that will listen (namely an irate Hermione who would frequently tell him he needs to ‘stop being so fucking bitter and let go’) that he no longer numbly roams his house in just pants, surviving solely on greasy takeaway from the chicken shop around the corner. But when it was bad, many a time Hermione would let herself into Grimmauld Place, late at night, to find him drunkenly slouched in an armchair in only his pants, with plastic takeaway containers and whisky bottles strewn across the floor, No Doubt’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TR3Vdo5etCQ" rel="nofollow"><em>Don’t Speak</em></a> blasting from his speakers on repeat. She always got him properly dressed and put to bed. He’d wake to a hangover potion on his nightstand, a glass of water charmed to stay cool, and a pristinely sorted sitting room. He’s yet to thank her for it.</p><p>Now, he’s <em>finally </em>accepted why Ginny needed to leave him and he’s doing well. He’s moving on, thank you very much. He’s even showing support for her coming out with the glittering rainbow curtain that now covers Walburga’s portrait, compliments of his impressive transfiguration skills. He had proudly showed it off to Ginny when she came to visit last month with Luna after the Gay Pride Parade. They were both trying to convince him to join them at the pubs with everyone else. It wasn’t lost on him that Parvati had not accompanied Ginny to Grimmauld Place. He was thankful for small mercies but had decided to sit it out to avoid any awkwardness.</p><p>She had looked so pretty. Her short hair was slicked back. She had on super tight, short, nylon, neon-pink cycling shorts that clung low on her narrow hips, a matching sports bra on that showed off her toned stomach and recently pierced belly button. Her eyelids were painted with yellow eyeshadow, lips a glossy pink, her long pale neck adorned with several multi-coloured beads. She was slightly sweaty and she looked so damn <em> beautiful</em>. So damn <em> happy. </em> </p><p>Yeah. That’s it. She’s finally happy.</p><p>But all that aside, even Hermione was impressed with his Walburga makeover, particularly the glitter portion of the transfiguration, and of course his sentimental – <em> “I will always be there for you because I accept you, Gin!</em>”— attitude. She had told him firmly that this was a <em>start.</em> He didn’t even react too badly when he saw the picture of his beautiful ex-girlfriend and Parvati plastered on the front page of the <em>Daily Prophet </em><em>— </em>   </p><p></p><blockquote>
  <p><em> THE WIZARDING WORLD’S </em>WOMEN OF THE YEAR<em>: GINEVRA WEASLEY AND PARVATI PATIL ARE PAVING THE WAY FOR QUIDDITCH LOVING WOMEN! </em></p>
  <p>
    <em> *Interviewed personally by Editor-in-Chief, Pansy Parkinson </em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p><em> –  </em> that Ron so rudely flashed in his face a fortnight ago, the absolute dickhead. He may have excused himself to the toilet for a proper cry, but at least he had done it in the solitude of his own bathroom and not in front of Ron and Hermione again over dinner. Or in <em>their  </em> bathroom. Or waiting for Dean and Seamus in <em> The York </em> off Islington High Street. Or in front of Molly at the Burrow when Ginny was away. Or tea with Luna at her and Rolf’s new Kentish Town flat.</p><p>But bugger it, her beatific smile was wide and her eyes sparkled up at him through the paper, before turning her gaze to an equally glowing Parvati. He was reminded of all the times she had looked at<em> him </em>like that and frankly, he was <em> gutted</em>. But despite the pain he suffered from seeing that article, he survived that setback to his self-esteem, desperate to win at this recovery game from “The Big Gay Break Up”. Maybe in due-time they’d both be able to sit together and not bat an eye over their lost love. But not now. Not today.</p><p>He’d decided to quickly pop over to Diagon Alley’s Quality Quidditch Supplies to look for broom polish and indulge in some general ogling of new brooms, when he noticed the small angry mob of people across the way from the Magical Menagerie. His wand was out before he realised it as he took off towards the mass of bodies. Gasping and quite befuddled, he quickly ducked as a pineapple came flying towards him, followed by a hasty <em>sorry! </em>If he hadn’t have ducked, it would have hit him, as the aim was nearly spot on. The person who threw the offending fruit came jogging towards him.</p><p>“Sorry—oh! <em> Oh,</em> <em>bloody fuck, it’s </em><em>Harry Potter!” </em>the young witch screams hysterically before a hand flies up to her mouth, seemingly startled by her own volume. She looks no older than 16. She gapes up at him with large blue eyes and stumbles sideways, bumping into another hoodlum who had followed her. She looks vaguely familiar, maybe a fellow Gryffindor. People continue shouting as fruit and flashes of light fly towards the centre of the mob.</p><p>“Harry Potter!” the girl repeats, this time at a more acceptable volume, still looking ready to faint. Soon a hush falls over the crowd and people begin to collectively whisper—</p><p>“<em>Harry Potter!” </em></p><p>
  <em> “He saved us!” </em>
</p><p>
  <em> “The Chosen One…” </em>
</p><p>The small crowd pushes towards him and he jumps back in surprise, dropping his wand arm to his side. “What on earth is going on here?” he asks the girl, his eyes searching the many faces that immediately surround him. He can’t discern what people are saying with everyone speaking at once. He takes another step back, overwhelmed by the response as the crowd lurches towards him again. A glamour would not have gone amiss here; Harry silently regrets not changing his appearance before leaving home.</p><p>“Er,” he starts awkwardly. The girl who haphazardly tossed the pineapple wraps both of her hands around his forearm and tugs him towards the centre of the mob.</p><p>“Mr Potter!” she gasps. “Oh, Mr Potter, that Death Eater…” the crowd parts then to reveal an immobile figure collapsed on the ground. Harry saw elegant forest green robes and a shock of white blond hair.</p><p>Merlin fuck. It’s Malfoy<em>. </em></p><p>“How dare he show his face!” someone shouts from the crowd. Shouts of agreement ring out –</p><p>
  <em> “He’s scum!” </em>
</p><p>
  <em> “Death Eater!” </em>
</p><p>
  <em> “MURDERER!” </em>
</p><p>Harry jerks his arm from the girl’s grasp and roughly pushes through the angry mob to drop to his knees beside Malfoy. The other man is face down, blood caking one side of his face from a wound at his temple, possibly from a rock or…a perfectly aimed pineapple.</p><p>
  <em> Shit buggering fuck shit! </em>
</p><p>His mind races as his eyes catalogue each injury before placing his wand down beside Malfoy’s head. He immediately leans forward to check Malfoy’s pulse – weak, but there. “Malfoy, can you hear me?” he asks loudly, placing a hand on Malfoy’s shoulder.</p><p>“What are you<em> doing?”</em> the young witch hisses, her eyes wild with shock. One of the girl’s goons lunges forward to tug him away from Malfoy. Harry slaps the hoodlum’s encroaching hands.</p><p>“Why are you helping him?” she barks. He ignores her and instead turns Malfoy onto his back to assess his other wounds when two strong pairs of hands clamp down on his shoulders, attempting to pull him away from Malfoy. Harry snaps his head up to glare at the two older wizards from the mob manhandling him.</p><p>Harry can feel his skin break out in goosebumps, the hair on the back of his arms are standing erect.</p><p>“Are you completely <em> insane?”</em> he hisses. A rush of his magic grows deep in the centre of his chest, spreading wide as his anger climbs.</p><p>“Get the bloody hell off me!” When the assailants hesitate to remove their hands from his person, he snatches up his wand, viciously slashing it in the air with a wordless <em> Confundus. </em> Shouts of fear and bewilderment greet him from the crowd as the two men release him, confused expressions writ across their faces. They bump into one another before stumbling away from the mob. In the midst of the enshrouding chaos, he flings a hasty <em> Protego </em>around Malfoy’s body. Breathing heavily through his nose, the angry rush of magic still crackling inside him.</p><p>Despite the ozone-like smell of wild magic in the air, the size of the crowd doesn’t thin out. Instead, the spectacle seems to draw the attention of <em> more </em> people, probably curious to see <em> the Great Harry Potter lose his shit </em>in the middle of Diagon Alley. Witches and wizards, young and old, surround him with looks of disbelief, fear, and some even with outright disgust.</p><p>“Listen to me!” he shouts, glaring at the angry mob, trying to muster an authoritative tone to quickly dispel the group. He religiously ignores the strong, impulsive desire to just hex everyone around him.</p><p>“You lot should get the fuck out of here before I call the Aurors. How dare you do something like this!”</p><p>“The Aurors would certainly reward us for keeping scum like this in their place!” some calls out from the crowd.</p><p>“Yeah, who does he think he is? Roaming the streets freely?” another person shout, people begin clapping and making noises of agreement.</p><p>“He can’t even do magic! What’s he here for anyway?” another cries.</p><p>That last observation is actually a really valid one, he considers, as the crowd becomes even more restless and agitated. Regardless, this kind of behaviour is bloody savage. No one deserved this kind of treatment.</p><p>“Malfoy was served his punishment. It’s not your job to take the law into your hands. Now get the fuck out of here!” he shouts.</p><p>To his surprise and relief, the mob of people slowly begin to disperse with looks of shock and betrayal on their faces. He could hardly be bothered to care about their dejected feelings as he removes the protective shield to once again assess Malfoy’s injuries.</p><p>The rock—or fruit, but he’s wagering on rock— that collided with Malfoy’s head surely caused a concussion. The bruising on his face is immense and to his horror, he realises that at some point they must have used their fists. He glances around. No one was coming to help him. With a heavy sigh, he lifts his wand once more and whispers ‘<em> Levicorpus</em>.’ Slowly the other man rises. He flicks his wand once more towards Malfoy to cast a quick Notice-Me-Not charm on his body. He figures he’ll take Malfoy to The Leaky Cauldron and Floo to St Mungo’s from there.</p><p align="center"> ----</p><p>Hours later, he finds himself sitting in a private room he’d finagled the hospital staff into for Malfoy. To his shock and disgust, he was met with adamant resistance as no one wanted to treat the former Death Eater. Much to his discomfort, he had to throw around his name to procure a Healer for Malfoy, the Welcoming Witch having not noticed his identity when he first arrived. So here he sat, in a tiny secluded room far from the nurse’s station feeling sick to his stomach at having manipulated the staff, but strangely proud that he had done it at the same time. After all, he couldn’t very well let Malfoy lapse into a coma or whatever happens to someone who is concussed for a long time.</p><p>When Malfoy finally opens his eyes, it’s with a gut-wrenching cry that startles him.</p><p>“Where am I?” Malfoy asks quietly, as if meant for just himself as he stares up at the ceiling.</p><p>“Nice to see you, too, Malfoy. You’re at St Mungo’s,” he responds nonchalantly. Malfoy flinches. Some part of him doesn’t know why he stayed behind to watch over Malfoy, but the larger part – the winning part – tells him it’s because Malfoy has no one else.</p><p>He’s sitting close to the door in a stuffy armchair, a copy of the latest issue of <em> Witch Weekly </em> open on his lap. He was skimming through Parvati’s op-ed piece on misogyny and equal pay issues for women in major league Quidditch that he’d snagged from reception before Malfoy gained consciousness.</p><p>“The-the mob?” Malfoy asks, his voice coming out in hushed, staccato breaths. Harry can see him swallowing hard. “What happened to the mob?”</p><p>He raises an incredulous eyebrow. He had expected some yelling or at least a stern demand to leave the room, not this quietly puzzled Malfoy. Perhaps the concussion had left him off-kilter.</p><p>“I told them to piss off,” he responds. “You were roughed up quite a bit.” Closing the magazine, he stands and drags the overstuffed chair over to Malfoy’s bedside. The other man eyes him warily as he settles back into the seat. The bruising that had peppered his face was now just a sickly yellow instead of the black and purple mess it had been earlier.</p><p>Harry allows himself to really<em> look </em>at the other man. His lashes are impossibly long and they’re almost as fair as the hair on his head, perfectly framing his intelligent silvery grey eyes. His alabaster skin, despite the receding bruises, has a hint of a pink flush. He’s still quite pointy—all sharp edges and wiry limbs, but he’s grown into it, having picked up a bit of weight since the trials. His Cupid-bow shaped lips are as pouty and petulant as ever. Harry can begrudgingly acknowledge that Malfoy is quite attractive—if a touch too pretty. He likes it.</p><p>Wait, no, no, no, he thinks. He shakes himself, feeling slightly faint at his line of thinking. Malfoy? <em> Attractive? Pretty? </em>  Bloody buggering hell, what is <em> wrong </em> with him?</p><p>“Do you mind telling me what exactly happened?” Harry asks, still damning himself and shifting uncomfortably in his seat.</p><p>“I went into Diagon Alley to purchase a Kneazle. Without magic, I’m left quite vulnerable so a Kneazle would be an asset to the wards at the Manor and to myself.”</p><p>Harry clears his throat.</p><p>“Er…Malfoy, I hate to break it to you, but I didn’t see any Kneazle before I brought you here.”</p><p>Malfoy glowers at him.</p><p>“Of course you wouldn’t, Potter,” he snaps. He closes his eyes and through gritted teeth says, “They wouldn’t sell me a certified Kneazle at Magical Menagerie.”</p><p>“Are you still going to look for a Kneazle elsewhere?”</p><p>“Potter… are you going to properly take my statement anytime soon or is this conversation going to be about Kneazles?”</p><p>Harry’s brows lower in confusion.</p><p>“Your statement?”</p><p>“You’re a bloody Auror, aren’t you?”</p><p>“Er…no, I’m not.”</p><p>Malfoy releases a nasally, exasperated sigh.</p><p>“What, in Merlin’s name, were you doing there then, Potter? Did you participate in the violent flash mob?”</p><p>“What? No!” He starts, offended. “I told you, I broke the crowd up and when I saw what they had done to you—I, I couldn’t<em> leave</em> you there.”</p><p>“<em>Good grief,</em>” Malfoy hisses, eyes alit with fury. “Are you to witness <em>every </em>single humiliating event in my fucking life?”  </p><p>Harry sits back in his armchair, his arms crossing against his chest as he glares at Malfoy. He ignores the slight sting of pity he feels for the blond because his accusation and anger are hardly fair. It’s not like he <em> wants  </em>to be a witness to these things.</p><p>“I think what you’re rooting around for in that brain of yours is a <em>thank you</em>.”</p><p>“Piss off, Potter,” Malfoy growls. “I don’t owe you anything for pulling your self-indulgent Saviour bollocks. As far as I’m concerned, this day never happened. Go save someone else.” Malfoy then turns to face the wall, exposing his back to Harry in an angry huff. A part of him feels pleased that Malfoy is speaking to him in such a dismissive way now— not quite as off-kilter as he was previously led to believe.</p><p>“How the hell did you even get there if you’re not allowed to do magic?” With apparition and the Floo Network being out of the question, and Malfoy’s limited knowledge of muggle transportation, it was a valid question. There’s a long pause and he’s annoyed to find that Malfoy is ignoring him.</p><p>“Malfoy?” he asks again. He’s about to poke the other man in the shoulder when he hears what sounds like <em>oh for Merlin’s sake </em>under Malfoy’s breath.</p><p>“My conditions with the Ministry, as draconian as they are, do permit me to have Auror supervised visits to the magical community of my choice once every month. Otherwise, I’m limited to the Manor without magic. The Auror on duty was supposed to wait outside of The Magical Menagerie but when I came out, he was nowhere in sight. Then some snot-nosed brat shouted at me and before I knew it, I was surrounded by the mob and hit with a hex or a fist, I can’t quite recall which happened first,” he explains flatly.</p><p>Harry’s irritation melts away as he stares at Malfoy’s back in horror.</p><p>“Merlin, I’m sorry Malfoy, that’s awful.” It wasn’t fair that Malfoy was being treated this way by the Ministry or the public. Malfoy could have died today and Harry fears that little would have been done to punish the parties responsible. And really, <em>what the fuck </em>was wrong with that supervising Auror? What the hell was he thinking, leaving Malfoy alone like that?</p><p>Harry wrestles back his fury, realising that it probably wouldn’t sit well with Malfoy to see him vexed on his behalf. He suddenly remembers Narcissa Malfoy.</p><p>“Where’s your mum?” he asks curiously. Couldn’t she have gone out to Diagon Alley for him?</p><p>Malfoy slowly turns back to him, his face twisted up into a grimace, tone terse.</p><p>“She’s moved to France—St. Laurent de Belzagot. Bought a vineyard out there and some horses to indulge in her love of Equestrianism.”</p><p>“Why didn’t you go with her?”</p><p>“Bloody hell, Potter. For someone <em>not</em> taking a statement, you sure are being thorough in prying into my personal affairs! Why don’t you leave now? I need to contact a <em>real Auror </em>so I can get back to the Manor.” Harry winces and suddenly feels embarrassed. Malfoy had just undergone a rather horrific attack and here he was relentlessly harassing the poor sod.</p><p>“Fine, I’ll leave you to it, Malfoy. I-I guess I just wanted to make sure you’re alright,” he says, hesitant to leave, but not wanting to drag this awkward reunion out any longer. Malfoy rolls his eyes, staring straight up at the ceiling.</p><p>“I don’t need your help, Potter. If there’s anything to take away from today’s events, it’s that I should no longer trust the Magical community. I think it’s time I make a decision about my future in it.”</p><p>Several questions spring forward in Harry’s mind at Malfoy’s words, but he grudgingly refrains from questioning the man any further. He takes in Malfoy’s grey, exhausted face and his slightly trembling lips. Harry looks away.</p><p>“I’ll just be going then,” he whispers as he stands. When he approaches the door, he turns once more to face Malfoy.</p><p>“Take care of yourself, Malfoy,” Harry says earnestly. The other man gives him a jerky nod, not meeting his gaze at all.</p><p>He leaves.</p><p>As soon as he arrives home he makes a Floo call to Ron, still an Auror in training, to file a formal complaint against Malfoy’s supervising Auror and to arrange for Malfoy to get back to the Manor safely. Ron’s confused and more than a bit curious, but takes it all in stride and promises to work on it immediately. As he ends the Floo call, he smiles to himself.</p><p>The git will just have to scold him from afar for his meddling, Saviour-Martyring ways.   </p><hr/><p>“Oh, Harry, stop being such a bore, we should <em>absolutely </em>do something for your birthday!” Hermione says as she stands precariously atop a stool, texting furiously on her bright red Nokia. The back of her phone is decorated with stickers shaped like gold stars, compliments of Ron’s current obsession with muggle stationary.</p><p>Merlin, was it already his birthday again? It felt like he had just turned 18 yesterday. “I’m not really in the partying mood,” he mutters. “Who are you texting?” he watches Hermione’s fingers move across the dial pad with lightning speed. They’re in Madam Malkin’s shop.</p><p>“My mum.” She sighs in exasperation and glances down at the young wizard pinning the bottom of her new Ministry robes. Harry’s seated in a comfortable wingback armchair before her, her purse in his lap, and a half-finished tea service sat beside him on a small table. His lips twitch upward as he watches her slowly lose patience. Granted, she<em> has </em> been standing for nearly thirty minutes now on that small stool.</p><p>He stares up at her, the smooth dark maroon robes flattering against her dark skin and curvy figure. A small smile tugs at his lips. She’s grown into a stunningly beautiful, and fiercely powerful witch. He chuckles to himself, overcome with pride for his best friend. Hermione is clearly on her way to becoming Minister of Magic one day. He smiles fondly up at her as her frustration becomes clear as day on her face.</p><p>She takes a deep, calming breath.</p><p>“I’m sorry, sir, how much longer?” she asks politely.</p><p>“A few more minutes, Ms Granger,” the young man says absently, focused entirely on the hem of her robe. “We don’t want the <em> newest </em> and  <em> youngest </em>Under Secretary to the Head of the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures to look out of sorts, do we?” The tailor gently teases her with a grin, his German accent accentuating his baritone voice.</p><p>Harry takes a moment to glance at the man. They had to be around the same age. He’s quite handsome, Harry thinks. The bloke’s heavy-set, tall and friendly-looking with thick chestnut-coloured hair and icy blue eyes. Harry can’t help but notice how nicely his trousers stretch over his backside as he bends forward, calling attention to the man’s round, firm-looking arse.</p><p>“Harry!” It was then that he caught sight of Hermione’s flapping hand in the mirror. She had been trying to get his attention. </p><p>“What?” Harry asks, wincing and looking up at Hermione. Her thick, shapely eyebrows are drawn together in that way they get when she’s assessing and cataloguing information. Harry clears his throat, the realisation of <em> exactly </em> what he was thinking and doing dawning on him.</p><p>It’s fine, wasn’t it? He’s just noticing…<em>things</em>…about the other bloke. His arse was literally in Harry’s face.</p><p>“It looked like he missed a spot,” Harry says weakly. At this, the tailor straightens up abruptly and turns sharply to face him, cheeks flushed pink.</p><p>“Pardon, Mr Potter, but my alterations are <em>superb!</em>” he says haughtily, leaving no room for argument. The tone reminds him of someone, but he can’t quite place it. Either way, that was him told. Harry gives the man a sheepish, apologetic smile. The tailor goes back to work on Hermione’s hem without so much as another look in his direction. Harry, quite humiliated, looks up to Hermione as she struggles and fails to keep a straight face.</p><p>“Well?” Hermione says as she composes herself, though still smirking and looking quite amused. “What would you like to do?”</p><p>Harry gives her a half-hearted, exasperated glare and shrugs his shoulders. “I don’t know, Hermione. How about a pub night with everyone?” he grumbles. “Is that enough for you?”</p><p>Hermione narrows her eyes, but her lips are still turned up in that self-satisfied smirk of hers.</p><p>“It’ll do.” There’s a brief pause before she enquires, “And what about Ginny and Parvati?”</p><p>“<em>Pardon me?</em>” he asks, aghast at her suggestion.</p><p>“All done,” the tailor interrupts, stepping back to survey his handiwork with a smug look. Harry watches as the tailor pulls out his wand. With a flourish the robe vanishes, Hermione’s sensible sky-blue maxi dress billowing out just a bit.</p><p>“I’ll get three sets of the robes back to you in 24-hours, Ms Granger.”</p><p>“Excellent,” she says, hopping off the stool and extending a hand to the tailor which he shakes enthusiastically. She then steps towards Harry,  grabbing her bag from his lap. Before he can scramble to his feet, she disappears behind a thick curtain leading to the front of the small shop. He glowers at her retreating form and follows her to where a tall witch behind the till slips her the Ministry-paid receipt for her new robes. She gives the employee a jaunty ‘<em>Cheers’ </em>before she turns sharply to him with an expectant look on her face, blindly shoving the receipt into her bag. Harry sighs, rolling his eyes.</p><p>“Fine, fine. Of course, they should be invited.”</p><p>“That’s the spirit, Harry,” she says, stepping forward to wrap him into a tight hug.</p><p>“You were texting Ginny earlier, weren’t you?” he asks through a mouthful of Hermione’s wild coconut-scented hair.</p><p>“Oh, erm, what? No!” she says unconvincingly as she releases him. “It’ll be fine. You’ll see.” She peers down at her small wristwatch.</p><p>“Lunch?” she asks cheerfully. He grunts in affirmation.</p><hr/><p align="center"> <b>August 1999</b></p><p> </p><p>“So, you’re going to be gone for how long?”</p><p>“A solid month, mate.”</p><p>“But why?”</p><p>At his question, Hermione pops up from behind a stack of books, muggle CDs and vinyls, her hair escaping her bun, the springy coils bouncing against her face, which is now contorted in pained discomfort. At the look, Harry feels embarrassed and begins to worry at the tassels on the pillow in his lap. Hermione and Ron just moved into a new flat – he takes in the infinite number of books, scrolls of parchment, still packed boxes, and albums piled everywhere – what were they thinking about traveling for, anyway?</p><p>Hermione shuffles a stack of books to the side and pulls out the Smashing Pumpkins CD Ron requested earlier, placing it in her stereo and starting it.</p><p>“Well, Harry. This year has been rather difficult,” she starts carefully, “and what with my impending work at the Ministry, and Ron about to start as a full Auror, we thought it would be best to take the trip now,” Hermione says as she comes to sit beside Ron on the sofa. Ron, seemingly instinctively, brushes the hair back from her face before offering her a cup of tea which she happily takes from him. He then curls his arm around her shoulders.</p><p>“I just figured I’d spend the end of summer hols with you, that’s all,” Harry mutters. He takes a long, lingering look outside their bay windows. It’s raining in London today and it’s still very humid for early August.</p><p>His birthday party had been a complete disaster. Another year older and none the wiser apparently, as he had gotten so drunk he made an utter arse of himself in front of everyone. He had made Ginny cry at his insensitive remarks about how their relationship ended, puked all over Hermione, and received a black eye from <em>forever-in-a-cardi </em> Neville<em>,</em> of all people. He was still unsure as to why Neville punched him, but from his understanding it had something to do with a crude joke about Hannah’s ample breasts. <em>Fuck, </em>he was an arse when got legless. He was mortified and had sent off an apology to everyone that had attended. He’s yet to hear back from Neville, though.</p><p>Hermione’s called him hot-headed and irrational so many times in the last week that it’s starting to sound like a bloody mantra. Hermione’s sigh brings his attention back to her.</p><p>“I know, Harry,” Hermione says gently. “Perhaps now would be an excellent time to figure out what is it you’d like to do with yourself, career-wise. You have so much potential…”</p><p>“Yeah, you really do, mate,” Ron says with an encouraging nod.</p><p>“Have you checked out that list of charities I sent you?” Hermione asks.</p><p>“Er…”</p><p>“You could always nip around the shop to help George,” Ron offers with a wry smile. “You know he’s always in search of someone to test his new creations on.” Harry immediately feels faint, images of him blowing up and floating away like his Aunt Marge or shooting fireworks from his nose coming to mind at the thought of working for George.</p><p>“I don’t know about that, Ron,” he starts slowly. “Sorry, I’m just a bit taken aback by your news.” He shifts uncomfortably in his seat, casting his eyes downward as Hermione makes a wounded little sound.</p><p>“Mate, we’d invite you—” Ron starts.</p><p>“—but it’s something we must do,” Hermione interjects quickly. Harry looks up. “Ron and I… <em> as a couple.</em>” Her words are awkward as she averts her own gaze to the ground. He feels a pang of sadness. It’s pathetic, really, that his best mates had to go about breaking their news to him like this. An invite to their flat on a Sunday morning with copious amounts of tea and a gentle rundown on why they were doing this to him… why they were leaving him to fend for himself for a whole month.</p><p>Hell, he knows he’s being unreasonable, dramatic, even. He doesn’t <em>own </em>Ron or Hermione. He feels guilty that they’re being overly cautious with him.</p><p>They could always see right through him, though. Ron had taken him out to the Leaky just last week to gauge how he was doing sans Ginny. Harry often found himself in Hermione’s company now that he had dropped out of Auror training and Ron had stayed. Ron was quickly making a name for himself in the department, Harry’s heard, and he couldn’t be more proud, but sometimes he sorely missed his best mate. It’s not as if he doesn’t spend time with them—he’s constantly joining them for dinner, meeting up with Hermione for lunch at the Ministry, coming around for tea when they probably just want to spend what little free time they have with each other. But it just wasn’t the same.</p><p>Merlin, he’s terribly ashamed at just how needy he’s become. He’s not mental or anything. Right? Do <em>they </em>think he's mental? He clears his throat and forces a weak smile.</p><p>“I completely understand,” he says. “Really. You guys deserve this. Don’t worry about me!” His best friends share one of those long looks with one another—the kind that only couples that are perfectly happy and in-tune with one another share to hold a wordless conversation. It’s the kind of look that drives him absolutely mad with envy nowadays. They look back at him. Ron doesn’t seem convinced and Hermione is worrying her lower lip so badly Harry thinks she’s going to chew it off completely.</p><p>Yes.</p><p> </p><p>They think he’s completely mental.</p><p> </p>
