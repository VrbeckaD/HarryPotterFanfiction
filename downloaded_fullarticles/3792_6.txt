    <p>A last day of school party was going. The music was booming and loud, several students laughing happily and drinking butter beer. Severus sat alone in the corner of the room. He could see Lily flirting with James, his bully since year 1. As much as he gotten over her he couldn't believe how childish and betraying she could be. So what if he called her a mudblood he didn't mean it. And it's not like he called her a slut or something.<br/>Scoffing, Severus stood up to leave the room. The booming music fading behind him. He entered an abandoned classroom and sat by the corner.</p><p>The minute he sat down the door slammed open with force there stood Sirius Black with a sick smile on his face. Severus pointed his wand at him only for it to be knocked away by a simple spell. Black approached him slowly, the door behind him closed and locked itself.<br/>Severus backed away from him till his back hit the wall.</p><p>That night the young boys innocence was taken.<br/>______________________________________________________<br/>Severus has recently published his new book. But after that he went under a new name. Evie Prince. Being the last living Prince made him the heir to the Prince fortune and so on. Malfoy was currently looking for new recruits for the dark lords upbringing, while Dumbledore was recruiting curtain people for the order. Evie wanted no part of this civil war, what have they done for him. He's seen the way they both looked at him expectantly, like they believe he will join them. Oh please, they made him sick. How pathetic.</p><p>Evie turned his eyes on a certain red head all his negativity and bitterness focused on her. The desire to light her on fire. But stopped until he realised Lily was screaming. The focus ended and Lily stopped screaming as it did but she was shaking as if someone had actually hurt her. Everyone was crowded around her with worry.</p><p>Evie got up to leave, however as he was leaving Bellatrix stood there with amazement on her face "I know your the one who did that, but it wasn't magic was it."<br/>Evie just looked at her before telling her *what he knew*.<br/>______________________________________________________<br/>Evie was currently reading the newspaper on a bench by a lake in the middle of muggle London. "Do you mind if I sit here?" Evie turned his head to face a handsome man in his 20's, he seemed intimidating and intriguing at the same time. He had a serious aura around him that had history. "No I don't mind." Evie replied. The man sat down next to him watching the lake as the ducks swam around. "It's a lovely day isn't it?" Evie turned his head to look at the stranger once more, "Yes. I suppose it is.". Evie smiled at him. "Excuse my manners -" the stranger held out his hand "Erik Lehnsherr." Evie took the hand and shook it politely "Evie Prince."<br/>______________________________________________________7 months later~</p><p>Wedding bells could be heard as a ceremony took place. Evie was wearing a white dress while her newly married husband was wearing a black tux that he looked so handsome in. The bump on Evie's stomach grew as the baby grew bigger.</p>
