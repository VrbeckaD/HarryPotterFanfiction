  <strong>A Warp in Destiny – Chapter 1 (An Abrupt Shift)</strong>
</p><p>It had almost seemed like a usual argument with Prince Arthur. It wasn't uncommon for Prince Arthur and Merlin to be arguing about something or another. But this wasn't just any argument, Merlin felt like. Especially concerning what their last words that had been exchanged.</p><p>"You're my friend, Arthur! If you would just listen—" Merlin spoke urgently.</p><p>"No, Merlin! You are just my servant!" was Arthur's harsh retort. "Why should I have to care about anything you have to say!? Now get out of my sight!"</p><p>Merlin took a physical step back, as if he was slapped. His face showed hurt all over his face. He felt an intense pain run through him of the clear reminder of being dismissed like he was, as if he were nothing. Like the years of friendship with Arthur didn't matter.</p><p>The Warlock's blue eyes became downcast as he whispered, "I thought you were better… apparently I was wrong."</p><p>Merlin turned without a word. He may have just slammed the door as it clicked shut softly.</p><p>The warlock walked as fast as he could away from the prince's chambers. He wanted to be as far away as possible. He didn't even care if the prince needed his help later that day. He felt hurt and honestly betrayed. Arthur had basically called him worthless and apparently wanted nothing to do with him.</p><p>He almost decided to walk back to Gaius' chambers before quickly changing his mind. He wasn't sure he could face Gaius at the moment, even if he would love to have his counseling. But he didn't want the chance of Gaius being patronizing and that he should give Arthur another chance.</p><p>With his mind made up, Merlin decided he needed to see someone. With that, he made his way to the stables to get his horse and made his way out of Camelot. He had one destination in mind.</p>
<hr/><p>Gwaine's eyes widened in surprise before grinning. "Well isn't this a surprise, I didn't think I would see you for another few days."</p><p>Merlin crashed into Gwaine for an intense hug, clinging to the man.</p><p>Gwaine kept a strong grip on Merlin, unsure what brought this on. But glad to have the young Warlock in his arms.</p><p>Even after Merlin broke the hug, he stayed in Gwaine's arms. Enjoying the warmth they provided.</p><p>Gwaine didn't hesitate to wipe the stray tear from Merlin's eyes. "I won't say I'm not pleased to see you, Merlin. Because I am. But what happened?"</p><p>Merlin stayed silent for a few moments. Then he slowly explained the argument that hadn't even happened an hour ago. About the argument that transpired between him and the Prince. Where Arthur had banished him from his chambers and declared that he didn't want to see him.</p><p>Gwaine stayed silent through it all, not saying a word until Merlin finished. And he wasn't a fool to not hear the hurt and betrayal through Merlin's tale.</p><p>"I can't say I'm the biggest fan of Arthur at the moment, because I'm not. You never deserve to be treated that like. And I don't care for what Arthur's reasoning," Gwaine's voice was blunt and strong.</p><p>"Thank you," Merlin whispered.</p><p>Gwaine held Merlin close to him, stroking a finger through Merlin's locks. Enjoying their moment together. It had felt like forever since he was able to hold Merlin this close. After all, Merlin didn't have many days off and it felt like forever since his and Merlin's journey to the Perilous Lands.</p><p>There were several long moments of silence between them, neither of them finding the need to speak. Until Merlin finally broke it.</p><p>"What made you stay so close to the border?"</p><p>Gwaine gave a soft smile, "I made a promise to you, didn't I? Shouldn't that be reason enough?"</p><p>Merlin nodded. "I'm glad." He then used that moment to let his lips touch Gwaine's. He had to turn slightly in order to do so. He let his eyes shift close and let himself just feel Gwaine and the emotions it brought.</p><p>Gwaine didn't hesitate to return the kiss and deepened it. He let his hands rest on Merlin's hips. Though his fingertips slightly slipped under Merlin's tunic.</p><p>Something the Warlock didn't seem to mind. He even leaned into the touch, noticing that Gwaine's hands were warm to the touch. "I missed this," Merlin whispered.</p><p>Gwaine tightened his hold on Merlin, "I don't want to let you go." His voice was quiet, though he knew that he couldn't. Merlin would eventually have to leave back towards Camelot, no matter how much he wished that he would not.</p><p>"Then don't," Merlin murmured against Gwaine's neck.</p><p>It wasn't too soon after Merlin spoke that he suddenly felt like someone was squeezing his insides. And Gwaine didn't look any better. It was obvious that Gwaine looked to be in the same pain as Merlin. And next thing they knew there was no floor and began to fall endlessly.</p><p>Merlin didn't even know how long he was falling, but he never let go of Gwaine. But he knew that he was being taken somewhere, where that may be, he didn't know. But he wasn't going to allow himself to be alone.</p><p>The next thing the two realized, they were being slammed onto soft grass.</p><p>Merlin groaned in pain, but the squeezing of his insides was gone. For that he was thankful. But when he looked around, he felt lost. The lands felt foreign to him, unfamiliar. And yet they didn't. He could feel the pull of magic, which made the warlock confused. There were only a few select places that radiated that feeling. But he was at neither of those places. He quickly turned around to look at Gwaine.</p><p>The brunette had almost made a groan of pain when they landed. But it appeared that Gwaine was barely conscious. His worry turned up a notch, but slightly calmed when he was still breathing. No doubt whatever had brought them here, had taken a toll on Gwaine's body. Merlin then furrowed his brows, Gwaine seemed different somehow, but he looked the same. It made no sense, Merlin just hoped he could figure out what it was.</p><p>Suddenly, Merlin doubled over clutching his head. The pain had been so sudden, but it was slowly fading, for which he was thankful. That was when he realized who was speaking to him, telepathically.</p><p>"Merlin," the ancient voice came.</p><p>Merlin smiled, "Kilgharrah… where am I?"</p><p>"You have been sent to a time that needs you," came the dragon's voice.</p><p>"I thought Arthur needed me?" Merlin's voice was laced with hurt.</p><p>"The young Pendragon is well on his way on his destiny. But you both need to take your separate paths to fulfill yours. Its has taken another route that you must see."</p><p>Merlin rubbed his temples, "what do you mean?"</p><p>"A young wizard desperately needs your aid. Or else all the work you've done to unite Albion will be lost," Kilgharrah's voice sounded grave.</p><p>"Who?" Merlin asked in his mind.</p><p>"Harry Potter. He needs more help than he will ever know. He faces an enemy he can't possibly defeat."</p><p>Merlin nodded, "how will I be able to help him?"</p><p>"That is up to you, young Warlock. I'm afraid this will be the last time we will speak. Seek out one of my kin. You will know when the times comes," Kilgharrah's voice was filled with sadness.</p><p>Merlin felt his eyes fill with tears, "why?"</p><p>"You are somewhere I can never reach. Farewell young warlock."</p><p>Merlin grasped at the grass with a harsh grip. Did Kilgharrah really mean that he would never see him again. He considered the Great Dragon to be his friend, despite his attack on Camelot. He didn't want to believe it, but Kilgharrah's ancient voice faded. Never to speak another word to him again. Merlin gave a heavy sigh, his eyes flickering over to Gwaine's motionless body, his fingers tracing through his hair. His hand slowly flexed to rid his nerves, he needed to find this Harry Potter. But his first concern was Gwaine and to find out where they were. With that, he slowly made his way to his feet.</p><p>A good thing, because he could hear someone approaching.</p><p>It was a woman who looked to be wearing a thick green cloak. She was obviously wearing some type of robe. The weird thing was, she was wearing some type of hat. The closer she got, he saw a stick in her hand.</p><p>Merlin was instantly on his guard and stood over Gwaine protectively. He would not let this person to hurt him if he could help it. "Who are you?" he demanded.</p><p>The woman had gotten closer and he watched as she pointed the stick in a threatening manner at him. Like he thought, the stick was a weapon of some kind. He wondered if she used it for magic.</p><p>"I don't believe you're in a manner to ask anything? How did you get here?" the woman's tone was stern.</p><p>Merlin's posture was stiff as she got closer. "Why should I answer you? You're the one threatening me."</p><p>The woman's eyes flashed at his defiance to her. "I won't ask again."</p><p>"Neither will I and don't even try to step closer, you'll regret it," Merlin promised as he raised his hand in a threatening manner.</p><p>The woman snorted at that.</p><p>Merlin reacted when she made another step towards him. His eyes flashed gold and threw the woman back. It was not enough to kill her, but to make his warning clear. It would wind her, but it wouldn't hurt her that badly.</p><p>Normally Merlin wouldn't use magic so openly, but this wasn't Camelot. He wasn't positive he was in the same time era. Kilgharrah after all did mention that another time had needed him. But he was going to defend Gwaine until the man was conscious enough to defend himself.</p><p>The woman in the green robe rose unsteadily to her feet, no doubt she was not expecting to be thrown back. "You just cast wandless magic," her voice had a hint of awe in it.</p><p>"So," Merlin growled. "You going to answer who you are and not threaten me. You're lucky I didn't kill you."</p><p>The woman in the green robe nodded, sheathing her wand. Though she looked a little shaken at Merlin's last words. "I am Professor McGonagall."</p><p>"Professor?" Merlin's voice was confused.</p><p>"I teach at Hogwarts," her voice was confident.</p><p>"Hogwarts?" Merlin was even more confused.</p><p>McGonagall's eyes widened a notch. "You have magic, surely you have heard of it."</p><p>"Never, where I'm from you would be killed," Merlin commented nonchalantly.</p><p>McGonagall narrowed her eyes.</p><p>Merlin wasn't paying attention to her now, because Gwaine was groaning.</p><p>"What happened?" Gwaine asked.</p><p>"You knocked yourself out," Merlin helpfully commented.</p><p>"I'm not the princess," he grumbled.</p><p>Merlin snickered at that.</p><p>That was when Gwaine conveniently looked at the woman in green. He instantly jumped to his feet and withdrew his sword. "Who are you?!"</p><p>If McGonagall had been shocked by Merlin, she definitely was now. It wasn't often a wizard or witch had a sword pointing at them.</p><p>"Gwaine," Merlin hissed.</p><p>Gwaine narrowed his eyes, but slightly lowered his sword. He never sheathed it though.</p><p>"It may be better to ask on what your names are," McGonagall commented.</p><p>Merlin shared a glance with Gwaine, who shrugged at him.</p><p>"I'm Gwaine."</p><p>"Merlin."</p><p>The woman's jaw dropped when she heard of Merlin's name. "You can't be…"</p><p>"Can't be what?" Merlin asked.</p><p>McGonagall straightened her features, "there is only one Merlin. He died ages ago after he created our world. He's renowned as the greatest Sorcerer of all time."</p><p>Merlin looked pale.</p><p>Gwaine tightened the grip on his sword as he glanced at the warlock. "I'm afraid he's not lying, he is Merlin."</p><p>Merlin looked at Gwaine with shock and a little bit of fear.</p><p>Gwaine grinned good naturally, "I hate to tell you, Merlin, but you aren't the best at keeping your secret."</p><p>Merlin glowered at him, "Arthur never figured it out."</p><p>Gwaine laughed, "the princess wouldn't be able to figure it out if you shouted it at him."</p><p>Merlin shrugged, he couldn't disagree with that.</p><p>McGonagall kept blinking her eyes at the two men in front of her. Not quite believing what she was hearing. Was it really true that 'the Merlin' was in front her and one of Arthur's knights?</p><p>Merlin sighed, "You wouldn't happen to know what year this is?"</p><p>"1994."</p><p>Merlin's eyes widened at that. He felt his hands slightly shaking, he didn't realize he was so far into the future. He had an inkling of an idea, but to be so bluntly told… it was a little mind boggling.</p><p>Gwaine let a finger trace down Merlin's forearm, an attempt at comfort. He had lowed his sword completely, aware that this woman was not an enemy of them. It appeared she was more of a fan of his lover. But she had seemed to have recognized his name as well. Not to count he was just as shocked on what time he was in. It would definitely take some getting used to.</p><p>"Kilgharrah couldn't have forewarned me, could he?" Merlin muttered under his breath.</p><p>Gwaine heard his words, he had never heard of that name. Hopefully Merlin would be open for sharing later. It was obviously important.</p><p>"Who is Kilgharrah?" McGongall's voice came.</p><p>Merlin snapped to look at the older woman. He could see the curiosity in her eyes. He almost didn't tell her, but he knew he wouldn't find this wizard he needed to protect without some help.</p><p>"A friend of mine," Merlin worded carefully. "He said I was to protect someone, someone by the name of Harry Potter."</p><p>Merlin and Gwaine watched as the woman's eyes went from curious to restrained. Her stance was almost protective, just like Merlin's was earlier. She obviously knew the name, that was for sure.</p><p>"Normally I wouldn't believe your claim on who you are. But the evidence of your magic earlier is enough to satisfy me. I've seen wandless magic before, but none to the extent of yours. There is more to what you're saying. But I won't force you to divulge those. If anyone has the capability and power to protect Mr. Potter, it is you," McGonagall gave a small smile.</p><p>"Then, you know who he is," Merlin remarked.</p><p>McGonagall nodded, "he is one of my students at Hogwarts."</p><p>"Would it be possible to go to this Hogwarts, so I can keep an eye on him?" Merlin asked.</p><p>McGonagall nodded, "if your task is to keep him safe. Then I will help you as much as I am able. You are aware that it is not a good idea to announce yourself as Merlin. That name is very famous here and considered bad luck when someone names their child after you."</p><p>Merlin looked stunned, he didn't realize he was 'that' well known. Though it was nice to know that Kilgharrah was right.</p><p>"I would suggest for you to choose another name, though your friend will be fine. Gwaine is a bit unusual for a name. But not as alarming as yours."</p><p>Merlin nodded in understanding. Though he didn't know how his name could be so famous. But he guessed if he had helped create this world, it shouldn't be too surprising. "Sorry for throwing you, you've been a big help." Merlin looked embarrassed now.</p><p>"I'm glad you did, Merlin. As I would never have believed you otherwise. As you would be stunned and thrown out of Hogwarts Grounds." McGonagall stated. "I will guide you both to the castle and explain some things there. As there are bound to be things that are different here opposed to your time."</p><p>Gwaine and Merlin nodded as they walked side by side behind the professor. And if their fingers were intertwined, well the professor couldn't see it.</p>
