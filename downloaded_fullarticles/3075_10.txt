          <div class="userstuff"><p> </p><p>There once was a pureblooded guy;<br/>
A raven-haired boy took his eye.<br/>
He spoke with a sneer,<br/>
Made his views very clear,<br/>
And the chance of a friendship passed by.</p><p>The boys went to wizarding school<br/>
And as rivals they fought in a duel.<br/>
As they prepared,<br/>
Malfoy asked, ‘Are you scared?’<br/>
‘You wish’ Potter said, playing cool.</p><p>They glared at each other all day;<br/>
Green eyes boring into cool grey.<br/>
All was not as it seems;<br/>
No one knew of their schemes<br/>
Or realised they were horny and gay.</p><p>Let me tell you the real situation:<br/>
One kiss led to shared masturbation.<br/>
With dark lidded eyes,<br/>
A grunt and some sighs,<br/>
Moaning ‘Merlin!’ and ‘Fuck!’ in elation.</p><p>One night, interrupted by Finnigan,<br/>
They silently tried to begin again.<br/>
Potter stifled a shout<br/>
As Malfoy pulled out,<br/>
But he screamed when he plunged right back in again.</p><p>The moment he knew Potter was his:<br/>
An ‘I love you’ whilst doing the biz.<br/>
Potter clutched his blond hair,<br/>
As they shagged in mid-air,<br/>
And he splattered the broomstick with jizz.</p><p> </p></div>
