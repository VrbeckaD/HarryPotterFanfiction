</center><p dir="ltr">Hermione groaned as she fumbled to silence her blaring alarm. The grey light of the early spring morning that peeked through the blinds was still far too harsh for her pounding head. She wouldn't have thought it possible to be hungover and still feel slightly drunk from the night before - but here she was. She burrowed back into the comfort of her bed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Just five more minutes," a husky voice rumbled behind her as a well-muscled arm wrapped around her waist and pulled her tightly against a very warm, very<em> naked </em> body.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hermione's eyes shot open - headache forgotten as hazy glimpses of last night flashed through her mind.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em> Taking shot after shot of tequila - the bite of the lime cutting through the harsh taste. Giggling nervously when strong arms caged her in. Heartbeat like a hummingbird's wings as a patrician nose slid up her long neck, inhaling everything that was uniquely her. Getting lost in deep grey pools that glinted silver as he leaned in dangerously close. Surrendering with a moan as his lips claimed hers.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> Teeth and tongue nipping at and soothing her neck. Everything blurring together as their passion built. Clothes disappearing, falling back onto her bed. Warm, insistent hands spreading her legs. His eyes flashing with molten heat as he lowered his mouth between her thighs, lapping up the sweet nectar that pooled there. Her hands slipping through silvery blond locks, grasping the silky hair and pulling him closer. Climbing and peaking more times than either could keep track of until suddenly his mouth was claiming hers once more - sharing the taste of her arousal as he slid inside her warmth. Gasping at the delicious stretch as he filled her over and over again until all she could feel was him and the pleasure he wouldn't stop giving her. </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The sudden sensation of fingers sliding through her slippery folds - stroking her with a practiced touch brought her thoughts screeching back to the present. Hermione squirmed and arched her back as he lined himself up, seeking entry into her body once again. His name left her lips in a breathy moan as he slowly pushed inside, "<em> Draco! </em>"</p>
<p> </p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>Hermione savoured her coffee letting the hot steam warm the tip of her nose as she settled against the wall of the lift. Hangover potions were a blessing but coffee was a necessity on a day like this. She refused to acknowledge the person who leaned against the wall next to her. <em> He </em> had taken up enough of her time this morning, besides it was sure to annoy him - something she had the inexplicable urge to do.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Morning, Granger. Sleep well?"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"You mean for the three hours you stopped fucking me long enough to do so?"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"I didn't hear you complaining last night," Draco said with a smirk, "Or this morning for that matter - in the bed or the shower."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"I do seem to recall raising an objection when you destroyed my smoke alarm!"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"We've been over this, that was quite the flare-up of —"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"'Accidental magic.' I know. So you've said."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"It's hardly my fault that the blasted thing started screeching louder than a caterwauling charm right as I was —"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"That's quite enough of that, thank you! I was there, I don't need to be reminded."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Don't you?" Draco gently tipped her chin up, bringing her amber eyes up to meet his smoky gaze. "What set it off, again? I don't seem to recall any smoke in the bedroom, though things were rather <em> steamy</em>."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"You can wipe that smirk off your face, Malfoy. I already told you it was just overly sensitive," she said with a groan. "As if your ego wasn't big enough already!"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I was wondering when you’d bring up size.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Oh, you are so immature. Why do I put up with you again?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At this, Draco cut her off with a kiss - cupping her face in his palms as his tongue sought entry to her mouth. Hermione tried to deny him out of pure spite by pressing her lips tightly together but when he slid one hand down to cup her breast and expertly pinched her nipple through her clothing, she couldn't help the gasp that escaped. Never one to let an opportunity pass him by, he took full advantage and plundered her mouth. He didn't pull away until he'd kissed her completely breathless. He studied the flecks of gold just visible in her lust-darkened eyes for a moment before dropping his gaze to her mouth. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>"That's why," Draco said as his thumb brushed lightly over her kiss-swollen lips. Hermione thought for a moment he might lean in to kiss her again when he stepped away. He was gone, the glimmer of his silvery hair disappearing behind the lift doors, while she was left panting - struggling to gather her thoughts. <em> Damn</em>.</p>
