    <p> </p><p>It was late at night, Lily had yet again slipped into the blissful embrace of the sleep. But tonight she had yet again another dream, a special type of dream. They had started after she got pregnant, some would say they were merely the results of her hormones or stress, or something of the same sort. But those dreams were different from normal ones, because Lily was conscious, and they felt so real, as if she had actually lived them before. actually almost in control of her body. Or at least it seemed to be her body, and yet it wasn't.</p><p>Whenever she looked down she would see nothing but silver metal painted white and red, a robotic body that was completely alien, out of this world. And yet, she felt at ease in it; it felt like this body was really hers. Nothing out of place, everything felt familiar, like it had always been this way since she was born. This felt as natural as being made of flesh and bones.</p><p>She even knew her surrounding, the city of Kaon , it looked like a vision straight out of a science fiction movie to her when she was awake, but now in those dreams it was so real, and familiar, nothing abnormal, everything being just the city's usual. But as wonderful as it would seem for some, she hated those dreams, because they would always turn into nightmares as she was faced with the reality of her life on this planet named Cybertron, during what the inhabitants called the "Golden Age".</p><p>Her name was Red Alert,from what she understood that name was given to her due to her temperament, she worked as a medic for the miners, and everyday she would see mechs and femmes who were pushed beyond their limits, forced to work like slaves, they would arrive in her medical ward in various states of harms or exhaustion. Lily had thought she had already seen a lot with the crimes of the Deatheaters, but the mines of Kaon... it was hell, a whole new level of nightmare. There were no other words for that.</p><p>Dark, insanitary,dangerously unstable in some places. How many cybertronian she had seen offlining while she tried her best to save them? She had lost the count, just as she had shed all the tears she had. Oh she tried her best,but the equipment she had at her disposal was not sufficient, she didn't have even half the equipment that the most backwater clinic would have. It was infuriating to her, and eventually, at night, despair came to visit her, whenever she was unable to do anything as her patients agonized. She sighed as she tried to drown her pain in high grade energon, she already started to feel dizzy from the drink, but as disgusting as it was, it was the only thing that allowed her to keep going, to make the pain go away for a little while.</p><p>She sighed heavily as she sat down on the chair of her desk, in her "office" if that dark and damp room could be called that. The door opened again causing her to hide the high grade, and rapidly turn around, she knew who it was and she did not want him to see her like that.</p><p>A smile graced her face as a tall silver mech walked in "Well well, look who's there. Our great champion, Megatronus, defender of the low castes" she said playfully trying to act as normal as possible.</p><p>Megatronus smirked "You haven't lost that humor of yours? Good, so I suppose everything was alright" he said with a chuckle, though he couldn't help but notice the smell of high grade which made his smile turn into a frown. He hated that scent, it was the smell of despair that ate at all the low class cybertronians who got drunk to forget their pains, it was the smell of decadence and defeat.</p><p>Alert's smile suddenly became a forced one, a fake one, a mask to hide pain and despair, as she had noticed that Megatronus had caught the smell of the high grade she had been hiding, she felt really shameful, but sometimes she just couldn't do anything else "Well I don't have much of choice, seeing the way things are...I may as well laugh as much as I can" she said her mask shattering after receiving a piercing look from Megatronus, he had seen right through her, she had never been good at lying or concealing things,especially not from him. It was kind of hard to hide anything from your sparkmate.</p><p>He pulled her closer, and she felt a soothing warmth in her chasis as her sparkbeat began to slowly match that of the gladiator. "I'm sorry, it's just...we lost five other miners...they uncovered a huge colony of scraplets, two were devoured, and the three other...I couldn't save them...the damages were already critical..." a lone drop of coolant fell from her right optic as her frame shook with anger She was angry at herself for being so useless and weak "I am sorry, I shouldn't be crying like this, especially in front of you. After all you and the resistance are the only ones who actually do something"</p><p>The optics of the gladiator shone with sadness "Red, you shouldn't feel that way, you are doing a lot with what you have, clearly another medic would have gave up. You, you kept working here saving as many lives as you could, you also helped our resistance movement. Not many would take the risk of getting caught, if you had been caught repairing us you would have been arrested and and thrown in jail without even a proper trial. It's for the ones like you that we fight, for a society that will finally treat us all as equals." he took a deep breath "Anyway, I'd like you to come with me to meet our new recruit"</p><p>The warmth Red felt in her chassis helped her fight off her tears. She nodded "Thank you" she took a deep breath and smiled again, a weak but genuine smile "So, who is this new ally of the Resistance that seem so important"</p><p>Megatronus chuckled feeling a little better now that he could feel in his spark that Red was at peace "An archivist from Iacon" he answered.</p><p>"Archivist? a middle caste mech?' Red asked she didn't really understood what was so important about a simple archivist.</p><p>The gladiator chuckled "An archivist yes, but one with connections in the high-castes, and who could bring us very influential allies to support our cause." he answered with a smirk.</p><p>"Well we shouldn't make him wait, it's a long way from Iacon to Kaon" was the last thing that Lily heard before waking up from this strange dream.</p><p>The witch stood careful to not wake up her husband as she stood up, she went downstairs to prepare an infusion. She was really confused about this dream and what she felt, it was as if she had truly lived all these events, in another life, in another era long gone. She reached within herself, to her magical core, that felt so remarkably similar to the spark Red Alert had, then she froze as she prodded her core and felt something. She found the bonds, the bonds that Red had formed during her life, One to her twin brother and one to her mate.</p><p>Lily bit her lower lip in anxiousness as understanding dawned upon her: Red Alert and her, they are one and the same. She couldn't help but tentatively prod the bonds , trying to feel and know if Megatronus and her brother were alive and well, after all Cybertronians could live for eons. That's when it happened ,she felt it, felt them, they were alive, here on this planet, and had felt her reaching out to them through the bonds they had believed gone. Lily could suddenly feel a hundred of questions aimed at her over the bonds, and raw emotions: surprise,disbelief,relief,worry, a real storm of emotions.</p><p>Lily was about to answer when she realized what she was doing and was horrified, she quickly stopped everything and silenced the bonds. She took a deep breath, and tried to hold back her tears, but found she couldn't, they ran down her face as quiet muffled sobs escaped her as she sat down on the couch. She felt horrible for what she had just done, giving false hopes to persons who had lost someone very important in their lives . It was even worde in Megatronus' case, she couldn't show herself as she was now, human, with a new family, married with another man, pregnant with his son. No, Red Alert was dead, she was Lily Potter né Evans, and no one else, she would have to live with it. She couldn't go back to her old life, nothing could give it back not even her magic. "I'm sorry..." was all she could say. She repeated it over and over, and eventually a revelation dawned upon her, Red Alert was not dead, she was very much alive. Her emotions, her memories, everything was there, even the bonds she created, all were there within Lily, they were one and the same without doubt.</p><p>Pain didn't want to go away, it only went crescendo as more of Red Alert's memories assaulted Lily who was now curling into a fetal position ,and one was particularly strong and vivid, the death of Red Alert.</p><p>It was a particularly violent one. Part of the mine had collapsed and she had rushed to save the miners , she had seen one miner who was still alive ,stuck under the boulders. She had approached to get him out of there but as she walked to him the rest of the tunnel collapsed on top of her. Her death was a long agonizing one as her energon bled from her body , and the worst par of it was when she felt that within her , a life was slowly fading away. Yes, as she died she realized she was carrying, and that not only her life was ending, but also one that had not even started causing her even more pain and despair.</p><p>Lily bit down on her lower lip so hard it bled, she reached for her belly, scared of losing her child like Red had. The idea was terrifying for her, but as she cried she felt a soft warm feeling. Another bond , a bond to her son, that felt strangely familliar. And then she realized that memories and bonds were not the only thing she still had of her previous life, the spark she had carried was there, and now belonged to her yet to be born son.</p><p>A small sad smile appeared on her face, maybe this time she and her child would have a better life, but she still couldn't help but worry for her past mate.</p><p>Soon she fell asleep ,exhausted by those intense emotions.</p><p>Jasper, Nevada,Autobot Base</p><p>Ratchet was frantic, he had been working on his synthetic energon formula when he had felt hid bond to his twin reconnect. She was alive, somewhere on this planet! He typed furiously on his keyboard trying to find a signal, a transmission, anything that could lead him to his sister.</p><p>Optimus walked to the medic , he had been staying up way too late which had the autobot leader worry "Is everything alright old friend? you seem worried"</p><p>"Optimus, Red is alive! she is here! somewhere on this planet!" the frantic medic exclaimed.</p><p>The prime's optics widened out of surprise staring at the medic "Ratchet this is impossible, she was buried alive in the mines, all of us saw her dead frame, me ,you, Megatron. There is simply no way for her to be alive, and why would she be here of all places?" he asked with disbelief.</p><p>"Optimus, I wouldn't be trying anything if I was not absolutely sure! I felt our bond reconnect! she is here, just...blocking me for some reason. Maybe because she doesn't want me to get in danger for her, but...if she is truly alive...I have to do something" the medic said, the pain and guilt in his optics was obvious. Ratchet had always regretted the fact he had left his sister do what she wanted and go to Kaon. He had always been against the idea, he knew something bad would eventually happen, but she was so determined to go to this pit of Unicron to try and save as many lives as she could.</p><p>Optimus looked at his friend with confusion, he didn't know what to think or say. The leader was now deep in his thoughts, the possibility that Red Alert was alive was something he hadn't expected, he hadn't known the femme for long, but he agreed that she was a remarkable person; brave and strong ready to do anything to help those who needed her help. And above all she was the sister of a friend who had stood by his side for longer than any of the Autobots. Ratchet had been with him through thick and thin, Optimus knew that he owed him this much "Very well old friend, keep searching,and warn me when you have found a lead"</p><p>Ratchet smiled he was full of gratitude , he knew this wasn't a priority , and yet Optimus granted him this one favor. He went back to work, he needed to find Red and quick, for if he knew she was alive, it was very unlikely he was the only one.</p><p><em> Somewhere in Earth's orbit </em> on board of the Nemesis</p><p>Megatron suddenly awoke from his recharge, a rather restless one.</p><p>His right servo reached for his chest, over his spark. He had felt it, felt her, she was there! Red was alive all this time! She was there for a few seconds, and then she was gone again. The Decepticon warlord couldn't believe she was alive, it had to be some sort of cruel trick,an illusion, and yet...he knew it wasn't.</p><p>He left his room and went to the bridge "Soundwave!"</p><p>The spymaster wordlessly stood to attention ready to receive his lord's order. And though he let none of it appear, he was surprised by what he was seeing. He had known the Decepticon leader for long enough to know his body language. And the way he stood indicated he was agitated by many emotions at once.</p><p>"I want you to scan this planet for Red Alert's signature!"</p><p>This time Soundwave was unable to contain his surprise and tilted his head in confusion, Red Alert was dead, but he knew better than second guess Megatron when he was in such a state and did as he was told. Scanning the entire planet took long minutes which felt agonizing to Megatron. And finally when the results arrived he felt his spark sink, nothing, not even the smallest signal.</p><p>The warlord shook his helm, this couldn't be right, he knew she was there, she had too"I want you to collect all that you can, track any possible trace of her on this wretched rock! Stay alert at all time and warn me when you have found something!" he snarled as he glared at the planet on the screen.</p><p>Red Alert was somewhere on this planet. He didn't knew what kept her from him, but he'll find her, even if he has to burn this entire planet in order to do so, nothing would stop him from finding her, nothing and no one. He swore on his spark that he would have her back by his side as she was meant to be, and that whoever was keeping her from him would pay dearly for it.</p>
