    <p> </p><p> </p><p>Newt's return to New York is as abrupt and unplanned as most of his life, really. </p><p>He got a patronus call from is brother in the ministry saying he better get there now, apparated to London, and took a portky to the States with the instructions to catch the Nundu with minimal damage or the creature would be put down. He didn't even know where they were sending him to.</p><p> </p><p>Landing at the foot of a stairset, still dizzy, Newt spins around in a 360 turn to check whether the Nundu was in immediate vicinity. </p><p>He only sees humans- thankfully wizards and witches, apparently, as there were no shocked calls about his sudden entry but only rather disdainful looks about his appearance in general. That, Newt is used to, and given that he was still wearing dirt covered work clothes it is probably deserved.</p><p> </p><p>A man comes down the stairs in his direction, writing something on memo that immediately flies away as he's done- then he looks up at Newt, and Newt freezes.</p><p>He knows this face.</p><p>Instinct screams that this is a situation for a fight or flight reaction, but after his initial shock, Newt forces himself to relax his posture and greet that man. </p><p>He knows what the real Grindelwald looks like.</p><p>The man in front of him must be the real Director Graves, and is therefore about as likely to be or be impersonated by a dark wizard as everyone else.</p><p>Well, less likely, given that Grindelwald would have to be really bloody stupid to try that particular stunt again.</p><p>Except if he was going for reverse psychology, an honestly interesting theory introduced to newt by a philosopher and magician in Germany- </p><p>No, Graves is no more likely to be evil than anyone else, either way. </p><p>Newt shakes himself out of his ever spinning thoughts, reminding himself of his manners, and reaches Graves his hand.</p><p>"Mr. Graves, I presume? Newt Scamander, I'm here to catch a Nundu, you don't happen to know where that would be?"</p><p> </p><p>Looking uncomfortable, Graves quickly takes his hand, barely pressing it before letting go. He doesn't look Newt in the eyes, either.</p><p>"Yes, and I am truly sorry you have to deal with me here, I know you were involved in the... events earlier this year..."</p><p>Graves takes a deep breath, but before Newt can think of something to say the other man continues "It's just that we don't have an actual creature department or anything in the ministry, so everything concerning magical creaturesin muggle areas is given either to the secrecy personell or the aurors, depending on the danger. And as no-one quite knows for what else to use Mr anyways these days..."</p><p>The man sounds so bitter, and Newt instantly feels sorry for him, as well as embarrassed about the fact that apparently, Graves noticed his earlier instinctual reaction. </p><p>"It's no problem, really- well, that you don't have anyone to deal with the creatures here definitely is something that should be addressed, but you working with me will be fine. I'm incredibly sorry for my unprofessional reaction earlier."</p><p>Graves scoffs. "No need to be sorry, it's a normal reaction really. Now, the Nundu is in central park, do you need anything first or should we just apparate there?"</p><p> </p><p> </p>
