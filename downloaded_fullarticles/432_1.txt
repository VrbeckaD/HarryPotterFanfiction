  <b>First Year</b>
</p>
<p>Any other year, Scorpius was sure that his Sorting would have been the most exciting.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Any other year, a son of the Malfoy family being sorted into Gryffindor instead of Slytherin would have made headlines.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Son Of Death Eater, Age 7, Sorted Into Hero’s House! Does This Spell Redemption For The Malfoys?” is what Scorpius is sure Rita Skeeter would have titled her exquisitely detailed, yet factually questionable, article for the Daily Prophet.</p>
<p>Yet a few moments later, Scorpius knew that article would be titled: “The Boy Who Lived’s Son, Age 5, Sorted Into Death Eater House! Does This Spell Doom For Dumbledore’s Army?” and would be published in the Quibbler instead. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>In all honesty, Scorpius thought that Albus was the only person who wasn’t all too surprised at his sorting.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sure, his eyes widened for just a moment, but he eventually shrugged and calmly walked towards the Slytherin table.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While the rest of the hall was in an uproar, Scorpius felt a tap on his shoulder, only to turn and see 2nd year James Potter, Albus’s older brother.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Scorpius had always been surprised that people say that Albus took after their father, and James took after their mother.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sure Albus had his father’s eye shape, and James his mother’s, but that was the only major difference.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Both were extremely pale, with curly orange hair that looked like managing it was a loosing battle, a healthy dose of freckles, and the most startling green eyes. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Mind if I squeeze in next to you?” James said.</p>
<p>Scorpius could only nod.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He had met James once before, at a Ministry party both of their fathers had forced them to attend, as “heirs” to the glorious Houses of Malfoy and Potter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He hadn’t known what to make of him then, especially since their fathers, while civil in each other’s presence, still seemed to act cooly towards each other.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But Scorpius knew what to make of him then, with the eyes of his housemates giving him confused, almost hostel looks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While many people had many of the traits represented in the Houses and only got placed in one by a small margin, James was definitely a full-blooded Gryffindor. <span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p>James sat down and instantly threw an arm over Scorpius’s shoulder and came close.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Listen,” he said warmly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I know you’ll probably be… mistreated by some people for being a Malfoy in Gryffindor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Whether it’s from our fellow housemates for being from a family of Slytherins, or from the Slytherins for being a house traitor, you come to me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ll make sure they’re taken care of.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Got it?”</p>
<p>Scorpius nodded.</p>
<p>James returned the nod.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Good.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Oh, it looks like Rose got sorted into our house.”</p>
<p>And it did look that way, because moments later a girl who looked very much like a Weasley sat down across from the two boys.</p>
<p>“I can’t believe that bloody Albus got himself sorted into bloody Slytherin!” Rose Granger-Weasley spewed immediately.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It’s bloody disgraceful.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>James, how can you be so calm about your bloody brother getting sorted into bloody Slytherin?”</p>
<p>The warm smile James had when he was talking to Scorpius disappeared when he glared at Rose.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Because he’s <em>still</em> my brother Rose.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If I don’t support him, then he probably won’t have anyone else here that will.”</p>
<p>For some reason, Scorpius smiled at that, and Rose seemed to have gotten the message, going to sit down with some other Weasleys.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Malfoy figured that Rose was the olive to James’s martini.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A seven month old rotten olive that was quickly thrown away for something tastier.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Rose was replaced with one of the prettiest girls Scorpius had ever seen.</p>
<p>“Scorpius, right?” the girl said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She had a rather sultry voice for someone so young.</p>
<p>“Dominique, please don’t flirt with him,” James said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I think he’s still in shock from sorting.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He hasn’t said anything since sitting down.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And he’s eleven.”</p>
<p>Dominique gave James a playful smile.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“What do you take me for, James?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A pervert?”</p>
<p>She threw her head back, and gave a single, overly dramatic and very loud “HA!” before looking back at Scorpius with an intense gaze and slamming both hands on the table.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I am DOMINIQUE WEASLEY! As your NEWLY INSTATED fifth year prefect, if anybody gives you TROUBLE, then they’ll have to deal with ME! DOMINIQUE WEASLEY!” <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Dominique “HA!”-ed again.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Scorpius guessed she was the cheese to James’s fine wine.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The fanciest of cheeses, to be sure, but still cheese.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Scorpius smiled.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Thank you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Really.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Up in Gryffindor tower after the feast (“YES!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>SMALL ONES!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Follow me, DOMINIQUE WEASLEY!, to the TOWER of GODRIC GRYFFINDOR!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>HA!”), Scorpius now had the unpleasant task of writing to his family.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On second thought, Scorpius changed his mind.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With a dramatic flair he was sure DOMINIQUE! would be proud of, he stabbed his parchment with his quill, HA!-ed, then proceeded to throw said parchment into the roaring fire, packed up his quill and ink, then tried to head upstairs to unpack. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>A red-headed girl was sitting on the stairs up to the dormitories.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She was short, at least a head shorter than Scorpius, even though Scorpius was only about average height for an eleven year old boy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>From the looks of it, Scorpius had run into another Weasley.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Whether this girl was an olive or a cheese, or something entirely different, was yet to be seen.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She definitely seemed sleepy.</p>
<p>“I don’t think I’ve ever seen a red-headed Malfoy before,” the girl said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Then again, I also don’t think I’ve ever seen anyone so close to imitating Dominique-”</p>
<p>From the background, there was a loud “It’s DOMINIQUE!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>HA!”</p>
<p>The girl sighed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You get my point.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’m Molly, by the way.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Molly Weasley.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’m in the same year as James.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Anyway, I don’t think I heard anyone apologize for Rose being a prick at the feast earlier.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She has a bad habit of taking house and family loyalty to mean not deviating from what house and family have always done.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Anyway, Weasley-Malfoy, I’m going to sleep.”</p>
<p>And she did.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Right on the stairs, too.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Scorpius was definitely impressed she could fall asleep on the cold stairs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Definitely the sour patch kid to James’s Vodka. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>As delicately as he could, Scorpius stepped around Molly and went up to his dorm.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Plopping down onto his bed, he looked at his schedule.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His first class: Charms.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The professor: Cho Chang.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Time: 8 AM. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Oh boy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Scorpius survived his first month.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Somehow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He only got lost on the moving stairs once.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then he found his way to class thanks to his fairy godfather James, who was the gin to his own gin. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The fact that the previous sentence even went through his mind was proof that Scorpius really didn’t completely survive his first month.</p>
<p>Dominique had found out that he imitated her when he threw his parent’s letters into the fire, so she then decided there would be a nightly ritual where the two of them would HA! in the face of danger and destroy the letters together.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Screw his parents and screw Grandfather Lucius in particular!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Because that’s what being a Gryffindor meant to Dominique, apparently.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And Scorpius knew that the school had probably contacted his parents and let them know what house he was placed in, but he was still worried about what his family would say.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>And so Scorpius woke on Saturday morning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At home he wouldn’t be caught dead waking up at 9:30, but since his rituals with Dominique, he felt unusually liberated.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So liberated, in fact, that when he went down to the common room and sat down on the couch, he didn’t even notice the kid next to him was wearing Slytherin robes.</p>
<p>Well, until he did notice and jumped straight off the couch.</p>
<p>“Oh, I see you’ve met Albus,” James said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Albus, for his part, tried to smile and gave an awkward half wave.</p>
<p>Scorpius gave an equally awkward wave back.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was weird seeing someone who looked so much like a Weasley and a Potter in Slytherin robes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was wide for an eleven year old: the same height as Scorpius, only heavier.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not fat exactly, but solid and sturdy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At the same time, though, Scorpius realized that it must have been equally as strange to see a Malfoy in Gryffindor robes, even if said Malfoy was also a redhead. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>James took the now unoccupied spot next to Albus and gestured for Scorpius to sit in front of them on the hearth.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Seeing them sit next to each other, Scorpius mused about how they really did look like siblings, even if James was the only one who had really started puberty.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Scorpius had always wondered what it would be like to have siblings of his own. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“On to business,” James said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’ve heard from Dominique that you’ve been throwing away your parent’s letters.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And I can imagine that you’re parent probably wouldn’t be as accepting of you being a Gryffindor as Dad is of Albus here being in Slytherin.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mum though… <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Anyway, I was telling Albus all of this, when he showed me this.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>James held up a letter.</p>
<p>“It’s a letter from your father,” Albus whispered while pointing to himself.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“To me.”</p>
<p>“Seriously?” Scorpius said.</p>
<p>Albus gave a small nod and gestured for James to hand over the letter, which James did.</p>
<p>It read:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>Albus Severus Potter,</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em> As predicted, Rita Skeeter did her yearly report on all of the interesting sortings at Hogwarts this year.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Your’s was at the top of the list.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I do not know how your family reacted, but I wanted to let you that if you need anything, please feel free to contact me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Even though the last war is over two decades past, its scars still show.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Young Slytherins still have it tough, especially those whose families are of different Houses.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If you need any advice and you feel as though you are unable to go to your own family, feel free to owl me.</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>Draco Malfoy</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>P.S. If you ever run across my son, Scorpius, could you please tell him that his mother and I love him, and are proud of his Sorting.</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When it looked like Scorpius had finished reading the letter Albus awkwardly said: “I’m sorry I didn’t come show you earlier.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was slightly… overwhelmed that your Dad was contacting me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And I… didn’t know what you looked like.”</p>
<p>That made Scorpius smile almost as much as seeing his parents weren’t mad at him. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“You really didn’t know what I looked like?”</p>
<p>Albus nodded his head.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I… couldn’t remember… I was worried about my own parents…<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And we don’t have any classes together… And, well… ”<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p>Scorpius thought that Albus was definitely the chocolate to James’s rum.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Hey, Al,” James suddenly said, “how did you get past the Fat Lady?”</p>
<p>“Oh… that.” Albus blushed and gave a sheepish grin.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I… overheard some other first years saying the password rather loudly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She… doesn’t really seem to care about who comes in, as long as they have the password… and she’s had enough to drink.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For some reason, Scorpius imagined the train ride home for his first Christmas break of his Hogwarts career to be different than it was.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He certainly didn’t expect to be alone with Albus Potter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Since Albus had shown Scorpius his father’s letter, the two had talked a few more times.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>James would occasionally invite Albus to study with them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then James would inevitably decide to leave the study session early to go sleep or eat and leave the two of them alone.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Albus was at least smart enough to sneak snacks into the library on occasion.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Well, more like every study session.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Both Potter boys seemed to have large appetites. <span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p>So when James did the exact same thing on the train ride home, only this time with a wink and a sly grin, Scorpius wasn’t exactly surprised. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Has… has he told you yet?” Albus said immediately after James shut the compartment door.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Why he keeps… leaving us like this?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Scorpius shook his head.</p>
<p>Albus gave one of his awkward smiles.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One of the ones where it looked as though he had forgotten to smile, then tried really hard to make his make-up smile not look too creepy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It somehow turned out endearing.</p>
<p>“He wants us to be friends,” Albus explained.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I… don’t exactly… have friends…<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Other than James.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“We’re already friends, aren’t we?” Scorpius said.</p>
<p>Albus’s eyes widened in surprise.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“R-r-really?”</p>
<p>Scorpius smiled.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Of course!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You’re the only one I can complain to about being in a different house from my family!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And as much as Father and Mother say they’re fine with me being in Gryffindor, I still don’t think they like it all too much.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Well… at least your parents at least say they’re okay… My Mum still hasn’t gotten over the… shock,” Albus said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His eyes went dark when he said that. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“It’s fine though,” Albus continued.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I have you and James… and Dad, I think.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ll just ignore Mum like I ignore Rose!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mum’s tiny, so it shouldn’t be that hard.”</p>
<p>Both boys laughed at that.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On the way back after Christmas, James didn’t leave Scorpius and Albus.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Scorpius wondered if it had to do with Albus looking so down.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The younger Potter just kept looking out of the train window the entire time and blocked out the rest of the world.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Albus probably had a rougher time at home than Scorpius did, though, in all honesty, Scorpius really did have a good time at home.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After an awkward first evening where both parents and son were trying to avoid the subject, Grandmother Narcissa casually brought up the subject of Scorpius being in Gryffindor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She seemed so indifferent to the fact that it really made Scorpius feel stupid.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And Scorpius knew that, even as awkward as the first few hours were, his parents really had accepted his sorting when he received gold and red sheets for his bed and a blanket with a large lion on in for Christmas.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Albus though…<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Scorpius decided not to push Albus on the subject.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And thankfully, James was willing to fill him in.</p>
<p>“It’s not that Al doesn’t want to tell you about Christmas,” James said up in the Gryffindor dorms that evening.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The two of them were on James’s bed, Scorpius leaning up against the headboard and James against one of the pillars at the end of the bed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“He’s not even talking to me about it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s just that Mum kept letting the entire Weasley family know how disappointed she was.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>About Albus being in Slytherin, and about me and him being friends with you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On the second day back Al went up to our room in the afternoon and didn’t come out for the rest of the holiday.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I had to take him food and everything…”</p>
<p>Scorpius smiled, mostly relieved.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If Albus wasn’t even talking to James, then it wasn’t something Scorpius had done.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Has he done anything like that before?”</p>
<p>James smiled, as though reminiscing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“A few times.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Whenever Albus gets <em>really </em>angry or frustrated, he just gets away from people.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After some amount of time he would just come back and be like he was on the train, but mostly cooled off.”</p>
<p>The grin on James’s face grew even bigger.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You should have seen him glaring at Mum right before he went to our room.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was probably the best thing I’ve ever seen.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Scared the crap out of Mum and Dad.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Their awkward and silly Al, looking like he would like to murder her!”</p>
<p>James shrugged.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“When he wants to talk, he will.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We just have to make sure we’re there when he does, okay?”</p>
<p>Scorpius nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>“So!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Change of subject,” James said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“How was your break?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We’re your Slytherin parents nearly as dramatic as my Slytherin brother?”</p>
<p>Scorpius laughed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I wish!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Drama is much more exciting.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was just awkward for a lot of it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But Mother and Father got me some really cool Gryffindor bedding and blankets and stuff.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So, it’s all good!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>They stayed on James’s bed for another hour or so before Scorpius fell asleep.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On James’s bed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Why he didn’t just make the 20 second walk to his own dorm, he didn’t know, but James didn’t really seem to mind.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That boy was too nice for his own good sometimes.</p>
