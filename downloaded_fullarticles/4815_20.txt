    <p>Sirius Black was the type of bloke who would try anything once.</p><p>Well— not <em>anything</em>, really, because <em>anything</em> included the kind of idiotic bollocks every proper Black got up to— and, where his family was concerned, he'd rather try the deliberate opposite of <em>anything</em>, just to see his mother yell and shout. Trying the opposite of <em>anything</em> became sort of his thing, which may be why he'd got along so well with a certain James Potter, long-established partner in crime and self-proclaimed Chaser Extraordinaire.</p><p>They snuck out past curfew to cast <em>colloportus</em> on all classroom doors. They cast <em>confundo</em> on Professor Binns during one particularly dull lecture in history of magic. One could say they only ever really excelled at spells they learned when there was opportunity to use those spells for mischief.</p><p>"I was <em>trying</em> to understand what he said about the goblin uprising of 1744," Remus Lupin sighed when the spell part-worked and part didn't so much, leaving Binns curiously awakened from his own numbing drone when he realized for once that he'd lost his place in the text he was orating.</p><p>"No you weren't," James snickered under his breath, and Sirius commended him on a job well done; even good boy Remus Lupin would have to appreciate the rare diversion from this exasperatingly dull class. And, secretly, Remus did, and sometimes he couldn't help snickering visibly to himself at the various shenanigans his best mates had pulled; while he'd chastise them with a serious look in his eyes he'd nevertheless join in when they got together on the ratty couch at Gryffindor Commons. James and Sirius would exchange knowing glances that by then were an old familiar to Remus, and at last he'd ask impatiently what it was they had up their sleeve that time.</p><p>Sirius would look around cleverly, already stifling a grin while he inspected the room to be sure no one was listening in<em>—</em> and then he'd begin to relay in hushed tones what he and James had planned, and there also was Peter who'd listen in straight away, impressed and all too vastly amused by whatever it was the two had to say.</p><p>"You lot are terrible," Remus would laugh, but the words came in a way that meant unmistakably that he too was amused, and he too wanted in, even if he tried inwardly to tell himself that he really ought not to. Timid and mild-mannered, he was quite self-conscious after all about his <em>furry little problem— </em>and after compassionate efforts on part of their headmaster to keep his secret just that, Remus felt an inward obligation to work his hardest to do well.</p><p>Truth was, he really loved his friends. James and Sirius were almost hurt when they found he had a secret that he kept away from them, but reasoned that if he was gonna spend one day each month hanging out as a werewolf, then they'd just have to figure out some way to hang out with him properly. The animagus transformation, then, was probably their most extravagant example of working hard to learn magic purely for the sake of mischief.</p><p>Remus put on a very serious face when a stag, a rat, and a very big dog showed up excitedly to pay him a visit at the Shrieking Shack one evening before his transformation occurred, and proceeded with a combination of fascination and rage to lecture them on how they'd somehow managed to outdo themselves as far as reckless and irresponsible acts of utter idiocy were concerned—</p><p>But even as he waved his finger around and muttered and raged, there were tears glittering hot in his eyes, and he wiped at them stupidly as the words went incoherent and gradually lost, "<em>You daft lot of…of…</em>" he murmured as he laughed despite himself, struggling to appear like he was still mad as he plopped down on the creaking old mattress, and the great shaggy dog galloped toward him, front paws going on his knees as he reached up to lap at the side of his face.</p><p>"Idiot," Remus said with gentle affection, laughing as he sniffled and wiped with embarrassment at his own eyes, and soon the rat and the stag joined in.</p><p>Being a large scruffy dog was a great way of picking up ladies, Remus would mutter irritably at both Sirius and James when self-proclaimed Chaser Extraordinaire stepped out swaggering unto the lawn one sunny Saturday with a giant black dog on a leash, it was risky and stupid and <em>did the lot of them realize the kind of trouble they'd get themselves in if anyone found out they'd learned this sort of spell completely without regulations—</em></p><p>It was exactly, of course, the sort of thing those two would do, and it wasn't beneath Sirius, either, to trot up to the ladies and nuzzle his face all over parts of them they'd absolutely slap him for if he was in proper human form. <em>Show-off</em>, James would murmur under his breath, though he got plenty of attention as well, when they'd laugh and pet his dog and start chatting with him after that.</p><p><em>He's called Padfoot</em>, James told them, <em>Mister Padfoot</em>, though Mister Padfoot hardly had trouble getting the ladies' attention in proper human form as well. He was all too aware of his own good looks, but he wasn't so much arrogant as he liked to tease and torment James, they had a little contest of sorts, the two of them did. At that age, anything relating to sex seemed very adult and scandalous and taboo, and it was all you ever thought about and what you snickered about knowingly as though the mere fact you had something to say would suggest you were very adult and mature and advanced.</p><p>James and Sirius had an unspoken contest between them, which later went from unspoken to spoken outright and rubbed nearly constantly in each other's face, about just how far each of them had successfully gone and who would get to what base first.</p><p>"That's cheating, you're cheating…!" James exclaimed indignantly when one day Sirius announced broadly but without any words that he'd successfully managed second base, and the reason it was cheating was because Sirius got up to it with both girls and blokes, and it was a lot easier when you had double the playing field.</p><p>"How is that cheating?" Sirius laughed, plopping down on his bed like a king, because James' reaction had all but confirmed that here Mister Padfoot was farther ahead. This made James really vastly concerned of course, because truth was that for some time now he had fancied one particular bird, and he was no closer to even first base with her than Slytherin house was to winning the next quidditch match.</p><p>Lily Evans was in love with him, of course. She just needed a dashing chaser's help to realize and better understand her feelings.</p><p>Being not only dashing and charming, but also quite generous and willing to help, James thought he'd be more than happy to offer assistance in this regard; he invested himself tirelessly in this failing endeavor, and certainly made his offer of kindness quite clear during supper— or charms class, or partway through a quidditch game, or at any other time— to his friends' combined fascination and horror.</p><p>"He is such a <em>tit</em>," Sirius laughed over his breakfast some time before class, he watched while, down near the end of the Gryffindor table, James <em>accidentally</em> dropped his glasses just behind the spot where Lily sat; he then went on to pick them up and rose to his full height with an exaggerated show of astonishment.</p><p>"Oh, good morning, Evans…!" he said with feigned surprise; he attempted somehow to flex what muscles he had from beneath the hopelessly obscuring drape of his robes, while Lily heaved a sigh of annoyance. Just how many days in a row could a guy pretend to drop his glasses behind you at breakfast before he realized how obvious he was...?</p><p><em>She wants me</em>, James mouthed to Sirius from the other end of the table; he now pointed both fingers down at Lily while remaining stood behind her. After that, he winked and gave his friends a thumbs-up, and finally proceeded to turn around and swagger back toward them; <em>That ought to set him straight</em>, he thought in regard to Sirius, and assured himself he'd be ahead in the race in no time.</p><p>"Nicely done, mate," Sirius laughed when James sat at his side; "she seems clearly smitten."</p><p>"Clearly."</p><p>James turned his head sideward while he buttered his roll, flashing Evans his thousand-Watt smile from the end of the table and winking with his best boyish charm.</p><p>"Yeah, hurry up and eat," Remus said, though he too couldn't help grinning; "we haven't got much longer before potions."</p><p>
