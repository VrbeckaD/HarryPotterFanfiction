    <p>He was sitting high above in his self proclaimed nest. He was on the late night watch, alone. Just how he liked it. He didn’t really understand this assignment per say but he did what he was told to do. </p>
<p>The facility was nearly empty except for him and a few other security personnel that were working inside near the labs. They had a series of cameras set up to watch the hunk of metal to make sure that nothing happened to it or it didn’t let off any readings. They hadn’t had any movement on it since 2 days ago when a drunken Viking of a man broke in and tried to take it. But he, just like the 100s of others from the area couldn’t lift the item from the ground. He even saw them bring trucks and excavators in to try to pull it with no luck. It was almost like it was melded to the earth. </p>
<p>He was drawn out of his thoughts by a soft popping sound. To his amazement a small woman walked in to the circle. She was waving her hand in a weird manor. He was about to say something to her when he heard her start to talk to herself. </p>
<p>“Oh Hermione you are comfortable in the muggle world right?.. well of course I’m bloody comfortable I grew up in it didn’t I. ‘We’re sending you on a mission there. Oh ho but not in Britain where you are familiar, nooo we’re sending you to the States! New Mexico.. what happened to old Mexico? Probably melted off the bloody map... but did I say no, of course not. And what am I doing here. Looking for some kind of alien hammer?... I need a vacation.”</p>
<p>As odd as the situation was he had to stop himself from chuckling. She was obviously mad at herself and wasn’t afraid to scold herself for it. He watched as she waved her hands around the hammer like object still mumbling. </p>
<p>He keyed up his comm as silent as he could to get a message out. </p>
<p>“This is Barton, we have movement in the..” </p>
<p>Right as he was speaking he watched with amazement as she reached forward and gripped the handle and with little to no effort she lifted the hammer from the ground. She spun it once in her hand before taking the massive hammer and sinking it into her tiny purse. He couldn’t stop him self. </p>
<p>“What the hell!?” He said from his perched position and she startled before jerking her head up to look at him. </p>
<p>Her mouth opened in a O shape and she paled significantly. She was going to speak when the alarms and sirens sounded. She looked back up at him with an apologetic expression. </p>
<p>“I’ll bring it back. I promise, well.. probably.” She dropped a rock on the ground and the room was plunged into darkness. When it cleared she was gone. </p>
<p>=============================</p>
<p>“There’s nothing. Every single camera and radar and every piece of technical equipment we own failed at the exact time the hammer disappeared. Don’t tell me it’s a coincidence!” Coulson demanded as he stalked through the lab. </p>
<p>Clint sat on a table watching the lab rats scattering trying to come up with something to explain the lapse in data. </p>
<p>“I’ve told you it was a girl, a young woman. No older than 25 for sure, small stature, brown curly hair and a British accent. She waved her hands around, picked up the hammer, stuck it in her purse apologized to me before vanishing into the temporary darkness. Phil it sounds crazy but I saw it with my own eyes. You got to trust me.” </p>
<p>The lead agent stood staring at him for a minute deep in thought. </p>
<p>“A brittish accent you say? Wasn’t that guy we brought in the other night foreign as well? Maybe we should ask him a few more questions....” he turned in his black suit and stomped out. </p>
<p>==============================</p>
<p>“Harry what the actual hell have I gotten myself into. When I get home I’m going to Avada Kings. I swear!” She was pacing back and front I front of the mirror. </p>
<p>“Calm down Mione and talk to me.” Her shaggy headed friend tried soothing her. </p>
<p>“Ok,” she took a deep breath. “Unless I’m wrong, which we both know doesn’t happen often. I am currently in possession of Mjolnir.” </p>
<p>At Harry’s blank expression she sighed and continued. </p>
<p>“The Norse legend of Thors magical hammer. Which means if this is real, then the legends are real. And if that’s true then my entire world is spinning out of control right now. I mean literal Gods Harry! From other realms!” She was starting to hyper ventilate again. </p>
<p>“I’m not even sure what to say. How do we find out for sure? I mean this is bigger than what Kingsley thought when he sent you right?” Harry was rubbing his brow trying to wrap his mind around what she was saying. </p>
<p>“Loads bigger. The only thing I can think to do is get back inside shield. They’ve been studying it since it landed perhaps they know more. I just know that according to legend Thor and his hammer are never far apart, so there’s a good chance he is here. On earth.” She huffed and sat down. </p>
<p>“If I find him I have to convince him to go back to Asgard. The last thing we need is people looking too close at fairy tales and legends.”</p>
<p>================================</p>
<p>Coulson had just left the small cell they kept him in to give him a moment to come up with a story as to why he was there. The agent had accused him of being a soldier or a gun for hire. He couldn’t even bother to correct the man that he was in fact a god. If he couldn’t lift his own hammer he knew he wasn’t worthy of the title. </p>
<p>He sighed heavily and looked up with a start. There in the room with him was his brother Loki. </p>
<p>===========</p>
<p>Hermione watched the two brothers speak and her heart hurt for Thor. He honestly believed everything Loki was telling him but Hermione didn’t. </p>
<p>She tried to read him but quickly realized he was only a projection of himself. A very neat trick if she said so herself. But there was something in his eyes. That very Slytherin look that she had seen so many times before that let he know he was lying. Unable to see the hurt on the strapping Asgardian any longer she intervened. </p>
<p>Stepping out of her disillusionment spell she placed a small hand on the god of thunders shoulders. </p>
<p>Thor startled and even Loki looked shocked. The black Haired god immediately narrowed his eyes trying to understand what and who he was looking at. </p>
<p>“I am sorry to interrupt this family reunion. But if you will come with me your grace we need to get you out of here.” </p>
<p>Thor was still too shocked and couldn’t form the words to speak to her. She was looking down at his restraints when Loki spoke. </p>
<p>“Who are you?” </p>
<p>She didn’t respond as she pulled her wand and released Thor from his bindings. He looked up at her with wide blue eyes. </p>
<p>“A magic weilder.” He gasped. </p>
<p>She gave him a small smile and nodded reaching for his hand. </p>
<p>“A witch, I believe is legends are to be trusted your mother was raised by witches. However now is not the time for stories. We need to leave before they come back for you.” </p>
<p>She reached her hand into her bag pulling the hammer out to hand it to him. Loki has moved next to Thor and they both looked as if their eyes would explode from their sockets. </p>
<p>“I do believe this is yours?” She said as she tried to hand Mjolnir to him. </p>
<p>“How are you.... what are you. What is happening?” Loki’s stuttered most ungracefully. </p>
<p>Thor was shaking his head. “I cannot lift it anymore. How did you get it?” </p>
<p>The door to the cell shook a clue someone was about to enter. She shot a panicked look to the two gods. </p>
<p>“Oh bollocks.” She said as she jumped forward and wrapped a hand around Thors. </p>
<p>“I’m sorry about this!” She twisted and the two disappeared with a crack. </p>
