<br/>
Shimmering letters in the front window of Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes dissolved and reassembled themselves to say Closed. Fred and George, the twin Weasleys of note, disappeared with a crack and a wave of their wands, apparating home to the small apartment they shared. With the money they made from the shop, they could easily have afforded something larger, or nicer, or closer to home, but why waste the money when they were perfectly happy where they were?<br/>
<br/>
Not that their mother particularly agreed with them. Or their siblings. But no one else in their family understood Fred and George’s identical twin bond, the way they finished each other’s sentences almost to the point of reading the other’s mind, the way they each felt the physical pain of the other. Sharing a bedroom seemed the least attached part of their lives.<br/>
<br/>
In the year since the Battle of Hogwarts and the end of the war against Voldemort, Fred and George retreated even more into their relationship. Losing Percy in battle caused them to cling tightly to each other, both sure that neither one could live without the other.<br/>
<br/>
Fred dropped down onto their worn, overstuffed couch. “Good to be home,” he muttered, leaning his head back and closing his eyes happily.<br/>
<br/>
George leaned his forearms on the back of a large easy chair. “Absolutely. Did we get an owl from Mum today?”<br/>
<br/>
“Don’t think so. Why, are you expecting one?”<br/>
<br/>
“About our birthday. I’m sure she’ll want all of us back home for an evening.”<br/>
<br/>
Fred groaned. “Do we have to have a birthday?”<br/>
<br/>
George looked hurt. “You don’t want to celebrate? Blimey, Freddie, you almost weren’t here for this one.”<br/>
<br/>
A flash of pain crossed Fred’s features. He tried not to think about it – how closely he had come to being the one who didn’t make it out of battle instead of Percy. “Of course I want to celebrate,” he said. “Just not up for another round of Mum’s ‘why can’t you boys find some nice girls and settle down?’ speech.”<br/>
<br/>
George smirked. “We could tell her the truth.”<br/>
<br/>
At this, Fred opened his eyes and glared at his brother. “Please tell me you’re joking. Mum would have a heart attack. And then she’d kill us.”<br/>
<br/>
“Okay, okay.” George gave Fred an odd look. “I do have a birthday present for us,” he finally said.<br/>
<br/>
“You do?”<br/>
<br/>
George nodded. “I made something. Or, I tried to.”<br/>
<br/>
“Well?” Fred glanced around. “Where is it?”<br/>
<br/>
“Hold on.” George disappeared into their bedroom, and returned just as quickly with something hidden behind his back. Fred craned his neck, trying to see what he was hiding. “No, no, dear brother,” George scolded. “Wouldn’t want to ruin the surprise.”<br/>
<br/>
Fred rolled his eyes. “Come on, George.”<br/>
<br/>
George frowned. “It’s our birthday present,” he repeated.<br/>
<br/>
Fred grumbled and reluctantly shut his eyes. Pulling the object from behind his back, George said, “Okay.”<br/>
<br/>
Fred opened his eyes and gaped. “Wicked!” he said, watching the small hourglass swing gently on its chain. “How in Merlin’s name did you get a Time Turner?” George grinned cheekily. “Never mind,” Fred said, “I don’t want to know.” He got up from the couch and crossed the living room to where his twin stood with their prize. “What are we going to do with it?”<br/>
<br/>
“Well…” George said slowly. “This isn’t actually the whole present.”<br/>
<br/>
“It’s not?”<br/>
<br/>
Shaking his head, George’s eyes lit up dangerously. “I’ve turned it into a portkey.”<br/>
<br/>
“George!” Fred gaped at him.<br/>
<br/>
“What?”<br/>
<br/>
“I know classes were never high on our priority list,” Fred said. Then he smacked George’s good ear. “But didn’t you learn anything? You can’t make an enchanted object into a portkey. The magics interfere with each other.”<br/>
<br/>
“No risk, no reward!” George looked hopefully at Fred. “Don’t you even want to try it?”<br/>
<br/>
Fred thought for all of two seconds. “You know me better than to ask, brother.”<br/>
<br/>
George grinned, and practically skipped to Fred’s side. “This will be fun, I promise!” he said as he threw the chain around both of their necks.<br/>
<br/>
“How does it work?”<br/>
<br/>
“I think we spin it for how far we want to go back,” George said. “And then just hold on, I suppose.”<br/>
<br/>
“Where are we going?”<br/>
<br/>
George grinned. “Ever wondered what Umbridge looked like being carried off screaming by centaurs?”<br/>
<br/>
Fred snickered. “All right then, give it a spin, yeah?”<br/>
<br/>
Holding his wand to the hourglass, George gave it a flick to get it spinning.<br/>
<br/>
Once it started spinning, though, it didn’t slow or stop. “That’s probably enough,” Fred said as he watched.<br/>
<br/>
George tried to stop the disc, but his wand gave off a sharp blue spark and the spinning only went faster. He grabbed Fred’s hand as the air around them felt like it was being squeezed. “Hold on!”<br/>
<br/>
The portkey went off, pulling at them from inside like a hook in their stomach. And suddenly, the twins were dumped unceremoniously on the ground.<br/>
<br/>
George sat up and looked around. “Uh-oh.”<br/>
<br/>
Fred blinked. “Mum’s gonna kill us.”</p>
