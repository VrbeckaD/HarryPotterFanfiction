    <p>“Mom, have you seen my fantastic beast’s book?” Ginny called as she turned her room over for the fourth time. She stood looking around the chaos, hoping that it would reveal itself. She was sure that she’d left it on top of her trunk with her other school books. She distinctly remembered coming back to the Leaky Cauldron and piling them all there ready to pack her trunk, but now, all the other books were there, but Newt Scamander’s book was mysteriously gone. The Hogwarts express would leave without her at this rate.</p><p>“I think you left it in the bathroom, dear.” Hollered her mother sounding as harassed as usual this September first. “George! Fred!” Come and get these awful things out of the kitchen. Why in Merlin’s name did you buy these Canopic jars? And why are they here?” She heard her ask before the twins rumbled down the stairs.</p><p>“Research” they replied in tandem as they almost knocked another patron out of the way. </p><p>Ginny shook her head as she moved to the bathroom. She passed her eyes over every surface, but there was no sign of her book anywhere. She growled in frustration before turning back to her room. She would have to borrow one when she got to school. Hermione would probably have a copy she could borrow. That was the second item in as many days to up and disappear. First, it was her pygmy puff pencil case and now her school book. She wondered whether the twins had anything to do with it. She would get the truth even if she had to fight dirty.</p><p>She flopped down on her bed and sighed as she looked around the mess before rolling her eyes. She went to stand when something caught her eye. Something mud brown in colour lay over the back of her trunk. That hadn’t been there before. She stood up and reached for it and realised that it was a Quidditch uniform. Why would there be a quidditch uniform in her trunk? She saw the two brooms and recognised the emblem as belonging to Puddlemere United. She turned it around to read the back, just in case, there was a name. She frowned when she realised it was blank. </p><p>Maybe it was the cleaning goblin, and this was someone else’s jersey. She rolled her eyes as she packed everything away into her trunk again. She looked at the jersey again before throwing it into her trunk. Something told her that she should keep it.</p>
