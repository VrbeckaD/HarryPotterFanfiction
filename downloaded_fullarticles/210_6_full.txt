    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Blood. Fresh blood.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">The scent hits Harry with a heavy sourness that he doesn't expect. He chokes, grimacing as the stench grows worse. A hand goes to his mouth, a spell for a scent charm, comes next. That isn't what he'd expects to interrupt his relaxing evening.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">But that scent…he knows it. Knows it in the same way that he can pick his Bonded out of a line-up by scraps of their shadows. There's something wrong here, and it sets his fangs on edge. The slightest inkling of worry creeps in.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Something tells him that it's Theo, though he can't feel any life-threatening concerns through their bond. Theo is—alright, but mostly muted. Harry squirms. He doesn't know what it is, but he feels it in his bones. The scents grow stronger and now, Harry sits up his attention refocusing.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">With the obvious tinge of blood in the air, he knows he's right—it <em>is</em> Theo.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"Ethan? Fred?" he calls out, rising from the lounge and making his way through the sitting room. There is no immediate sense of danger, but he knows that they will feel his worry now. "George?"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">His Pareya were there only minutes ago and now, they're nowhere to be seen. Absently, Harry rubs his arms, fingers skimming over his Claim marks out of habit. There's muted feedback still, but nothing definite that he could pinpoint.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"Charlie?" he calls next, feeling his Beta's bond flare with concern. There's a sharpness on the edge of that spike of surprise and he doesn't like it.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">The last time something like this had happened, the ghostly events left him frustrated and cranky for the remainder of the month. Well, mostly due to the headache that had followed the ghost, but that was beside the point. There were some things that would never change, simply because of what they were and who he was.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Namely, it's Halloween.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">That same dreaded day where some strange misfortune always finds him. It's lessened over the years. The past few have been almost tolerable. More so since old Voldysnort was gone, but some days, Harry wishes he could have <em>all</em> of the peace and quiet.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Just for one year, really. He wouldn't complain too much after that. He tries to stay quiet and minding his own business, every year, but that never works out. Sometimes, it doesn't seem worth the hassle of pretending everything's alright.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Maybe he should just try to screw something up on purpose, because then, at least, he'll know what he's up against.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">A quick gathering spell checks the entire house, confirming that there were no otherworldly entities within Emerald Hollow. That's good. Harry's magic practically purrs as he let it twine around him and the walls, as he walks from the sitting room and towards the front of the manor. He pulls gently on a each of the bonds that hasn't reacted outright to his slight burst of fright.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">He's alright, but he wants his Bonded near. At least, until he's settled again.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"Harry, what's going on?" It's Alec, his prickly Merrow, scowling as he melts out of the shadows, his face fixed in a permanent frown. He wrinkles his delicate nose, looking as if he'd like to say something about the smell, before his brain seems to catch up to his mouth.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"Alec-" Harry reaches for him, even as a deep shudder runs up his spine. He wants Theo now, but Alec will do until he's sure that everyone is alright. He can definitely pinpoint that his Bonded are tempering their bonds, blocking the emotional feedback, so as not to worry him.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Alec growls, drawing him closer and keeping him there, with an arm around his waist. "Theo's," he says, shortly. "Move."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Harry shuffles forward at Alec's guiding hands. He's guessing, but he knows Theo's scent as well as Theo knows his. There's no mistaking that Theo's blood is partially the source of the smell, but something else is happening.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Something darker, lurking and teasing at the corners. It's as if there's eyes on him. Watching, waiting, <em>lurking</em>. He doesn't like it.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"Alec…"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"It's outside," Alec says, stiffly. "Can't reach you in here."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">And Harry loves him for that. Knowing what he wants to ask and answering his question in a way that soothes the uncomfortable ache in his stomach, as his empathy begins to reach out around him.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"What is it?"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">The Merrow darkens, pale blue skin, shifting to a darker, nearly navy hue. His teal hair seems to be turning black at the tips. "Something ugly," Alec says, at last. "Something dead."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Harry only nods. That's enough to work on, if he needs to. He stops at the front receiving room of the manor and traces the threads of magic that are seeping out of it. It seems that his entire Circle is on the other side of the door.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Alec shuffles closer, waiting. There's a few layered barriers over this point and it's obvious that they're active, from the visible flickers of gold and green magic glowing at the corners.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Harry steps through the sound barrier, feeling the thin film of magic snap around him. Sound rushes at him from all sides and it takes a few minutes to be oriented with what's happening. He hears shouts and yells—the Twins and Ethan—barking at each other, calling for all sorts of healing things.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Quinn, of course, is in the middle of it. Ethan is being his voice. No one looks up at Harry's entrance. They're too busy with what's sprawled out on the ground between them.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"Theo-!" Harry gasps—and he rushes forward.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Alec keeps up with him easily, grabbing Harry around the shoulders before he can interrupt Quinn's work. It's definitely Theo and he's in terrible shape.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Supported heavily by Wikhn and Hadrian, a grim, bloodied Theo coughs and spits mouthfuls of dark blood on the pure white floor.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Standing two feet in front of him, Quinn, rapidly chain-casts a series of antidote and deep-tissue repair spells, while Ethan and the others rush to bring him the healing tonics and powders requested. His eyes glow a bright, brilliant teal and his magic is liberally spread around the room, some strands even boring straight through the floor, to reach the Earth.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"It's not all his," Hadrian says, heavily. "Calm yourself, Harry." He winces, even as he speaks, as if he knows that's the wrong thing to say.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"Calm?" Harry snarls. He wrenches free of Alec's grip, unable to ignore the fact that Alec barely tried to hold him at all. In fact, there's a definite chill to the Merrow, now that they've broken through the soundproofed barrier.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">He's never seen Alec truly furious and he doesn't want to. Not now. Not tonight. There's different magics at play and tonight—is bad.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"Calm down," Wikhn says, sternly. His eyes were so close to pitch-black, it's the only reason that excuses the way he's curled in on himself. "Panicking now will only cause problems. Stay out of Quinn's way. Let him work."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Logically, Harry knows this, but instinctively, he hates the unofficial reprimand. Wikhn's not tempering his voice and it sounds like a scolding. A low rumble builds in his throat, because there's nothing wrong about <em>worrying</em>.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Ethan eases Theo to the ground, taking over from Wikhn and Hadrian. His gold eyes flux a deeper and darker brown, but he's just as close to the edge as the rest of them. He's barely keeping from blurting out the questions hang overhead.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"A bit harsh, don't you think?" Charlie says, mildly. His sense of agitation is visible in his flaming ponytail. It's five different shades of crimson, instead of his normal, cheerful flames. "Hadrian—what happened? I thought you said it was under control."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"It was under control," Hadrian says, tightly. He holds out an arm to Wikhn, looking as if he could keel over right there, if his shadows weren't clustering around him, keeping him upright. "Come on."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"This isn't under control," Charlie growls. "Hadrian!"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"And he'll live and you can shut up for five seconds," Hadrian snapped. Shadows peeled off of him, swirling around the floor. "You have no idea what that was and I don't want to think about it right now. Wikhn!"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Wikhn glares at him, rebelliously. Even as tremors overtook him, he made no move to draw closer at the obvious invitation.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Hadrian snarls and stalks forward. He grabs Wikhn by the neck with one, massive, clawed hand, dragging him forward on tip-toe. "When I tell you to come, I expect you to move," he growls, leaning in to make his point. "Do you want to lose control here? In front of Harry? Theo? They're not in any condition to handle you!"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Wikhn's answer is an angry hiss, the last slivers of red giving way to a deathly blackened gaze. "I am not your blade to command!"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"Damn right, you aren't. But you are my King when you choose to be and five minutes ago, you chose. Deal with it." He yanked Wikhn's head back with one tight-fisted hand in his inky hair, keeping his neck bared for a sharp, savage bite.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Fred, George and Ethan all hiss and growl in tandem. They don't care for the aggressive display and especially not so close to Theo in his weakened state. Quinn carefully avoids eye contact, crouching beside Theo and channeling more of his healing energy into him in slow, deliberate measures.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">The room chills. Alec's displeasure sweeping through it like an icy torrent, bent on complete destruction.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">It's enough to drag Harry's screaming instincts to their senses. He feels both of them through their respective bonds and the undercurrent of pain, makes his heart hurt. He doesn't need to know how their dynamics work right now, but he wants answers.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">He needs to know what's happened and what they'll be doing about it. "Hadrian—Wikhn," he tries. "Please. Not now. Don't—hurt him."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"I don't think he'd let him, if he didn't want it," Alec says, annoyed. But his eyes had gone several shades of blue-green-purple and his scales were now on full-display and darkened beyond its usual bright hues. "Though I'd just as soon <em>not</em> witness it."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Hadrian releases Wikhn with a low, rumbling growl in his throat. His eyes are alight with dark delight and his reaper signs begin to show along his arms, revealed by way of his ruined arm guards.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Wikhn licked his lips and leaned forward. The flat-palm to Hadrian's chin, threw his head back, while a bit of Fae magic kept Hadrian right where Wikhn wanted him. It was only seconds before his fangs were sharply embedded in Hadrian's neck, with a loud, contented purr, filling the room.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">The rest of their Bonded shuffle uncomfortably. They all want answers and this is taking too long.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Alec snorts. "If you're done being disgusting and annoying, would one of you please tell us what's going on?"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Quinn sighs, drawing their attention.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Theo is unconscious now, thankfully, for the long threads of magic that continue to knit and repair the extensive damage to his body. Charlie now sits on the floor with Theo's head cradled in his lap. There's a definite furrow in his brow and the Twins are now flanking him.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Harry rubs his face. "Charlie?" He prompts, edging closer. The tension in the room has settled, now that Hadrian and Wikhn are alright and Quinn can focus again.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Alec draws him back with an arm around his shoulder. "Give him space," he grumbles, eyeing Quinn. "Don't crowd."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Harry pats Alec's hand, appreciating the gesture, even if it <em>is</em> really hard to stay there and not rush straight to Theo's side. He can see that the Twins and Charlie are channeling warmth into Theo, on top of Quinn's healing.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"He was checking something," Charlie says, slowly. "He only told me he had a favor he wanted to check on. He didn't say who it was or why, just that he needed to be sure of something."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"And you let him go alone?" Ethan asks, glancing between Charlie and the growling, purring couple of Hadrian and Wikhn. "Correction—did he tell you to let him go alone?"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Hadrian patted Wikhn's shoulders, then settled for rubbing up and down Wikhn's half-scarred sides with slow hands. "Wik—need to talk to them," he says, hoarsely.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Wikhn snuffles, but withdraws, his eyes bright red, his expression a tad manic. "He told us to be on standby," he says, snuggling into Hadrian's arms and somehow, still looking rather dangerous. "We were on standby. We're always on standby. We stood and-"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"And he said he had it under control," Hadrian says, darkly. "If he wasn't half-dead, I'd have my fangs in him instead of Wikhn.." He nuzzles the top of Wikhn's head, wrapping his arms securely around him. "We were trawling around the Shadow Territories, near the edges. He went to visit someone—or something—in that house down by the river on the bank. The one with the blue stone for a doorbell."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Harry freezes. "He <em>what</em>?"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">All of his Bonded turned to look at him. It's Charlie that breaks the awkward silence. "Anything you want to share, Harry?" Fred and George nudge each other, eyes bright with curiosity.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Harry offers a weak smile. He isn't sure he wants to share this secret just yet, but he might have to. "I just—it's an innocent question. W-what was he doing all the way down there?"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"That's what I couldn't figure out," Hadrian admits. "We really had no business at that corner of the water's edge," his dark eyes flick to Alec's scowling figure behind Harry. "No offense, of course."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Alec rolls his eyes in answer. "He has no business being there, because of what you are and you should know that better than all the rest!"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"Reaper business," Wikhn translates, mirroring Alec's annoyed expression. "They store souls over there. It's a metaphor for the River Styx and all of that." He leans harder into Hadrian, nibbling on his lower lip. "What I don't understand is why Harry knows that."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Harry winces. He had managed to walk right into that. "If I say it's a lucky guess-"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"Then I'd call you a liar," Ethan says, calmly. He taps his own cheek in warning. "I can feel that. Try again, Harry."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">A helpless groan escapes and Harry slides down to the floor. He barely notices when Alec eases down to float beside him—because naturally, the Merrow couldn't actually <em>sit</em> on the floor, like the rest of them.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"Harry?" Charlie prompts.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"I saw it when I was flying figure eights a couple months ago. It feels like Hadrian so..." Harry shrugs. "I don't know how to explain that, I just meant that-"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"You're right," Hadrian says. "It is a temporary holding spot. A Soulstop, if you would. Most wouldn't know that or recognize it, because most aren't exposed to-"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"To Death and bonded to a Grim Reaper," Harry says, sighing. "I know. I just—I didn't do it on purpose."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"Of course you didn't," George says, loyally. "Did he, Forge?"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"Course not, Gred," Fred says, nudging him back. "Kiss him, sourfish."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Alec hisses in answer, but hugs Harry from behind. "It is fortunate you didn't investigate. There are things there that should never come into contact with you. Your empathy wouldn't be able to handle it."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Harry winces. He can't say that he was close enough to figure it out on his own. Alec will kill him—after he's done hugging him, of course.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"Harry?" Alec squeezes him. He's picked up on Harry's reluctance.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"Can I just say upfront that I didn't know this would happen?"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Collectively, his Bonded groans.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"Harry!" Charlie says, exasperated.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Harry tries to grin, but it's hard. He's only staring at Theo's solemn, sleeping face and it's making him remember things. "See, my empathy's fine. I know how to block better than I used to and it's gotten much better lately."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Wikhn groans. "I told you!" He slaps Hadrian's chest with one flat palm. "I told you he did, but no, you didn't believe me. You didn't believe <em>me</em>, the one who was standing right there beside you when-"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Hadrian kisses Wikhn to shut him up. Surprisingly, it works. Wikhn's expression grows softer now, and Hadrian's shadows calm themselves.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Alec rolls his eyes again, but leans forward at a silent prompt from Quinn, offering one blue sparking vial.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">The pre-drawn Merrow Blood brings Theo around in a hurry, much to everyone's relief. It supercharges Quinn's healing spells and Theo's vitals began to steady. It's a matter of minutes, before the healing is complete.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Theo lurches upright, his hair wild and half-singed, his entire body radiating pure panic. "Harry-!" he cries, lurching halfway out of Charlie's lap and through Ethan's protesting hands. "Your—!"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Harry sighs. "Where is he?"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Theo nearly pouts. "Outside. Property's still warded. I couldn't—I'm fine, Harry. I swear I am."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Harry doesn't call him out on the lie, but he's not happy and he's sure it shows.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Charlie glances between them. "Do you want to fill me in or is my lecture you're avoiding now?" To his surprise, both Theo and Harry wince. "Mine? Huh. That's a first."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Fred and George light up at once. "Har-ry," they chorus. "Is it-"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Harry shakes his head. "Yes, it's Sirius. You can let him through the wards—<em>but</em>-!" He holds up a hand. "Only after we get Theo upstairs and in bed."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"I'm fine," Theo says, quickly. "Completely fine. No need to fuss over—OW!" He shoots Charlie an injured look. "I didn't go looking for him!"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"Of course you didn't," Charlie says, mildly. "Especially since you two hate each other. Why would you <em>ever</em> go out looking for him?"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Harry clears his throat, a smile teases at the corners of his mouth. "Thanks for finding him, Theo," he says, earnestly. "I didn't know if he'd come this year or-"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"He's come every year since we've figured out that it breaks your bad luck streak," Ethan says, wearily. "And you two—no pranks in Quinn's kitchen!"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Quinn grins, relieved. He helps Theo up with Charlie, the two of them balancing the slightly dizzy Theo between them.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"You can ask him," Theo says, wearily. "He can—explain. I just—ow."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Quinn frowns. He pats at Theo's sides, then shakes his head.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"Upstairs bath?" Charlie guesses.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"He can use my healing salts," Alec says, abruptly. He pulls Harry up to stand beside him. "And my bathing rooms," he said, quieter. "And I don't want to see your ghostly—godfather for any-"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"You don't have to," Harry says, calmly. He kisses Alec's cool cheek. "He doesn't care if you're there or not, so you don't have to visit. Thanks for volunteering your precious bath salts." He's relieved to have figured out most of what's happened and now, there's just the matter of what to do about it.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"They aren't precious-!" Alec starts to say, before he throws his hands up.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Harry watches Alec flounce off, admiring the view from behind—especially the way his charmed hair skims right over his delectable—his view is interrupted by an annoyed Ethan. "What?"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"Harry!" Ethan grumbles. "Are you listening? Do you want to go and greet him before he sets something on fire again? Or would you rather-"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"I'll go," Harry says, grinning. "If I don't, he'll try to come and find me. You just get Theo settled."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"He won't settle until you spend a few minutes with him-"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"I know, I know," Harry says, waving him off. "But he brought Sirius here for me and it is Halloween night. I should at least say hello." He skips off to the tune of Ethan's half-hearted growl.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Why Theo and Sirius didn't get along, he'll never know. There are some things that he's probably better off not knowing. There's one side of him that suggests it'ss a pureblooded wizard thing, but then he's seen the way that Theo's eyes had gone dark brown—not black—but a definite dark brown, the first time Sirius had made the connection between Harry and his handsome Circle.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">A smirk surfaces. As much as he loves Sirius—and really, he does—sometimes, a few pranks never hurt. He loves Theo and his Circle, dearly. Never will change that, no matter what Sirius says and the sooner they'd have that out of the way, the sooner things can return to their usual chaotic normal.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Harry trots out into the front yard to see George and Fred happily chattering away with an impatiently floating, semi-visible Sirius. He waves, the moment Sirius sees him and tries to rush the barrier. A laugh escapes when Sirius crashes into the invisible barrier and bounces back like a bubble.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"Har-ry!" Sirius gestures wildly to the ward and pantomimes hugging him across the courtyard.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"Sirius," Harry says, grinning as he join them. "Stand back."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"Need help?" The Twins ask, flanking him out of habit.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"Got it," Harry says. His magic gently twines around the bits and pieces of the protective wards keeping Emerald Hollow safe from the rest of the realms and some of Nevarah's ever-present Fabrine. "Ah—wait, Sirius. Rules!"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Sirius groans. Loudly. "Harry. Har-ry. What rules? We don't need rules-"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"The rules, Sirius," Harry says, in mock sternness. "You know the rules."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"No pranks in the kitchen. No going near the water—stuff." Sirius pretended to think.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Harry perked a brow.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Sirius gave an exaggerated sigh. "And no frighting your snakey little boyfriend." He frowned. "Or husband. Or whatever that wimp-"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"That wimp saved you from a Class Nine Banishing Light?" Harry says, knowingly. Because he knows how dangerous those are. He also knows the odd smell it will leave, when it burns through blood that is more shadow-than-light magic.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">The Twins twist around to stare at him. "Theo?" Fred says.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"Class Nine?" George says in dismay. "That's what left him like that?"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">But Harry's not finished yet. There's a faintly scolding tone as he continues. "I'd bet he also smuggled you through the hounds and the exorcists guarding the river? That same wimp?"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Sirius droops. He really can't joke about this, because it is far more serious than last year and he doesn't want Harry to worry. "You had to take all the fun out of it."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"When he's bleeding out on the floor, yes," Harry says, tartly. "I mind. I like him in one piece. One very delectable piece of-"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"Don't!" Sirius sticks his ghostly fingers in his ears. "I can't hear you. La la la la-"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Harry sniggers. Just seeing Sirius has eased a little bit of his worry and he's glad that he's alright. "Really?"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">The Twins high-five behind Harry as the wards come down, allowing Sirius to enter the property. They immediately start recasting and strengthening the magic once he's through.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"Really," Sirius says, warmly. He floats down, hugging Harry as best as his ghostly form would allow. "Look at you—a whole year, eh? Looks good on you." He tries to pat Harry's shoulder, but his hand is stuck halfway in Harry's shoulder, before his entire form wavers.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"You look—the same," Harry says. His fingers skim over the strange coldness that is Sirius' current form. "What happened? You've never had trouble breaching the river this time of year."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Sirius scowls. "I don't know, but I don't like it," he says, huffing. "Something came out of nowhere. Nearly swallowed me whole. That little wimp of yours—that <em>Theo</em> of yours, stopped it. I don't know how or why, but he did."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"Because he knows you're important to me," Harry says, simply. "I told you that you're judging him the wrong way. Not my fault that you don't want to pay attention to his good points."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Sirius grimaces. "I know he has them," he says, reluctantly. "I'd just rather not <em>see</em> them yet, alright?"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Harry grins his head. "Your loss," he says. "How's Mum and Dad? Remus and Tonks? I thought they might come this year."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"They're fine. Everyone's fine. Remus says thanks for taking in Teddy, James and Lily said hi. Lily wants to be in your Holiday picture, so make sure you put out the right kind of mirror and your Dad says he liked that last prank. They're sorry they couldn't cross over this time, but-"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"But there's something different in the realm borders than last year," Harry says, quietly. "I figured."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"Stuck with me," Sirius says, trying for levity and only halfway reaching it. "What've you been up to?"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"The usual. Getting into trouble. Then getting out of it."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"Lots of trouble," George says, grinning. He strolls over to rejoin them, hands shoved in his pockets, hair flaming a bright, cheerful yellow. "Wards are up again. They kind of didn't want to reconnect. You don't suppose something followed Theo home?"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Harry doesn't want to think of that, but before he can answer, Fred jogs over, looking just as worried as George is.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"So much trouble," Fred says. His eyes glow a bright, searing red. "Harry—hate to be the bearer of bad news, but—you sense anything out there? I can't see it, but I'm sure it's there."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"How sure?" George asks.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Fred shrugs. "I'm very sure of it."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Harry squints into the dark. He can feel the large, empty void of shadows, just out of reach and not quite within Nevarah's astral plane. He sighs. He'd hoped it wasn't anything big, but he knows better. After all, Theo can fight and will definitely leave a path of destruction in his wake, when the circumstances call for it.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Sirius floats a little higher, shading his eyes with his hands as if that will help. "I don't see anything obvious from here."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Harry smiles, sadly. "Yeah. There's something out there. It's everything and nothing right now. Just existing. Light. Dark. All of that."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Sirius drifts down to float beside him, his expression kind. "That's normal then. Let's go inside, so you don't have to look at it, eh?"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"Inside's good," Harry says, linking arms with George. "Hey, Sirius?"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"Harry?"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"It's good to see you again."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Sirius finally smiles. "Always good to see you, Harry."</span>
</p>
<hr/><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Harry loves seeing Sirius, especially since Nevarah allows Sirius to visit for the entire day. It's a chance to catch up on important things with important people and he's always grateful for it.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Eventually, he leaves the Twins to continue updating and entertaining his godfather when Ethan appears in the doorway of the sitting room, one eyebrow arched in a silence question.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"Be right back," Harry says, apologetically. "Don't scare up anything without me." It's meant to be a joke and it works—the Twins groan, loudly.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"Har-ry!" they call after him.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">But he's already left, silently laughing to himself as he follows Ethan down the halls and towards the Merrow portion of the house. He's relieved that Alec allows Theo to recuperate here in relative peace and quiet.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">It's always a surprise to see that Alec, with his strong personality, can get along with Theo. There's virtually never any arguments or disagreements with the occasional muttered exclamation from both sides to the tune of 'you said you did <em>what</em>?'</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">So Harry's expecting something when Ethan leads him into the bathroom.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">He isn't prepared to see Theo sitting in a dry tub, hugging his knees to his chest, eyes vacant and still half-hazel, rather than gold. Theo looks worse now, up here, alone.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Ethan gives a slight shake of his head, gesturing to the tub. "He won't let me near him and he wouldn't respond. Alec filled the tub twice and he banished the water, so now Alec's off sulking while Theo is—well."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"In shock?" Harry guesses. He approaches the tub, taking care to make some noise so Theo will know he was there. "Theo..."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">There's no answer.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"I think it was more than a Banishing Light that did this," Ethan said, unhappily. He perched on the closed toilet lid, while Harry knelt beside the bathtub. "Water's charmed to be as hot as he wants or as cold as he likes, but it feels freezing to me no matter way I've tried to spell it."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"The-o," Harry murmurs, leaning against the tub's broad edge to try and gain his Alpha's attention. The lack of reaction is worrisome, but Harry feels that Theo is there.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Faintly, but still present. He's hiding inside of himself though and Harry doesn't like that. It doesn't suit the Theo that he knows. He wants that silence gone, if only to know that Theo is alright, because Theo would never lie to him.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Not about this.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Picking up the showerhead, Harry turns the taps until the water feels warm to him. "It can't feel good covered in blood," he says, softly. "So I'll just warm you up, alright? Get some of it off of you. Let it wash away. It doesn't smell like yours. I'm glad it isn't."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Theo only turns his face to the warm spray of water that trickles over him in steady dribbles. He allows Harry to scrub him down, banishing his clothes one piece at a time, until he can verify that Theo is alright—and that there's no hidden wounds on scale or skin.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Harry's wet hands slick over half-scaled skin. Dark brown scales with only the barest hint of gold to them. Theo watches him, silently, with eyes that ask all sorts of unspoken questions. Things he won't ask, answers he doesn't want.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">It's just them. Coming down from the adrenaline high. Processing the crazy emotional rush that accompanied it. Realizing that maybe, somethings weren't all that they seem. Sitting in the tub, frozen.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">But Harry cares about more than that. Things that are deeper than the surface. He is patient as he drizzles softly scented shower gel over Theo's thin shoulders. It never fails to amaze him of the strength that his Alpha hides beneath such a slender frame.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">They call him the Little Alpha for a reason. To Harry, he's so much more than that and in moments like this, he wishes he could shower him with every bit of affection that he holds in his heart. Everything that he has to offer, so that Theo knows how much he is wanted, treasured and cherished.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Theo. His Theo.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">It must've cost him dearly to venture out that far. Though the more Harry thinks of it, he doesn't like what his mind is coming up with. Theo is methodical and precise. He likes to think things through and Harry likes to watch him think.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Especially when he can help with those thoughts in very <em>special</em> ways. Harry ducks his head, feeling his cheeks heat. Now is not the time to be thinking of that last brainstorming session that had very little to do with actual scheming and a lot to do with the rug in front of the fireplace in Theo's office.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">He likes that rug. Theo likes him on that rug. It's amazing, the way that they fit together, Harry thinks. So when his mind tells him what Theo hasn't, but his empathy can read, Harry is—understandably, upset.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Someone has manipulated his Theo into something awful. While he's grateful that Sirius still exists in his current form and that Theo is always able to wrangle his way out of difficult situations, Harry likes it when he doesn't <em>have</em> to.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Harry hums very softly as he swirls the frothy lather along Theo's body, taking care to rub gently at the points where the blood clings to scale. If Theo minds or notices, he gives no indication at all. He merely sits there, allowing Harry to raise his arms and lather him up, then rinse him down.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Sometimes, these moments of silent intimacy carry more emotion than weeks of lavish indulgence. It feeds the softly shimmering threads of Harry's empathy and he does his best to mirror it back to the one who always makes him feel treasured.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"The-o," he murmurs, when he's through. "I want you to be alright."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">There is only a faint smile, vaguely humoring, from Theo's solemn face. The only dash of emotion that's visible after all this time.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"M'fine, Harry."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"You're thinking too hard," Harry says. He presses a kiss to Theo's damp cheek. "Is it so serious you can't even tell me? Or are you just that frustrated with yourself?"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">And there it is, a soft, gentle sigh. Theo slumps in the tub, his head tipping back to rest on the edge. His eyes are half-closed. "I should've seen that coming," he says, at last. "I knew they were targeting us, but I missed something and-"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Harry frowns. He can usually follow most of Theo's abstract strategies, but sometimes, his clever Alpha thinks in too many directions at once and Harry finds his brain tied up in knots when he isn't sure which one of their many enemies they're supposed to be sparring with this week.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"Which part?" he asks. "The Blight or Sirius? Thank you for saving him, by the way. I know he's not your favorite."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"You are my only favorite," Theo murmurs, a smile teasing at the corners of his mouth. Harry's careful attentions have soothed a raw edge inside of him and he can find his voice, if only for a little while. "I can only have one."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Harry rests his head on the edge of the tub. "And you are mine," he says, easily. The thought registers and he speaks without truly sorting through the muddle in his mind. "What were you doing down there, anyway?"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Silence is Theo's answer. An Alpha has their pride after all, and this is one of those times.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Harry sifts through the possible answers and makes a soft sound in his throat when he realizes there is one very specific possibility that he'd automatically overlooked in his early musings. As much as Theo would make allowances for Sirius, this is one more thing he would absolutely overextend himself for.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">The one thing he, himself, does not have.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Harry barely trusts himself to speak clearly, because the rush of emotions tangling up inside of him, threaten to turn dark and ugly. He would hurt things for hurting his Theo. His Circle. His entire heart and <em>soul.</em></span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"Theo—did someone try to banish my parents?"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Beneath the clear, warm water, Theo's shifts entirely to half brown, half golden scales. He protects himself, even when he doesn't need to. He can't help reading what Harry isn't saying outright and it's a testament to how synchronized they are with each other, that Harry says nothing and Theo answers without speaking.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">It's a tap on Theo's shoulder and the barest, faintest press of Theo's cheek to Harry's hand. The moment freezes right then, the understanding passing through them as the kind of silent conversation that happens, isn't something that requires words.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Too soon, the moment is over. Harry's breaths return to normal and Theo tilts his head back to rest on the edge of the tub, staring up at the blank ceiling. The expressionless mask is back, along with the darkening of his scales. Theo is nearly more brown than gold at this point and it's all purely self-defense. He's remembering things that he won't share aloud. Maybe never.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Harry manages to keep his voice even and controlled, even though it makes his heart hurt to see that automatic reflex. "Next time call for help," he pleads. "Please? You know we would come."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"Who would come?" Theo asks, sharply. "Hadrian, who answers Death? Wikhn, who only answers you? The rest of our suite who is stretched thin and overworked by circumstances I can't control? Harry, there is no one left to come-"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"Shhhh," Harry soothes. He kisses Theo's forehead and shushes him with a finger to his lips. "They would still try. We would still try. Maybe there is something. I don't know. I was only asking. I don't like to see you like this and I don't know how to help."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">The tension is gone with those earnest words.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">And Theo sighs again. "You do more than you could ever know, my treasure. So much more. I wish you would see yourself through my eyes."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"With your sparkles and rose-colored everything?" Harry snorts. "No, thank you."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">The playful tone works and Theo smiles. He settles into the warm water and doesn't protest in the slightest when Harry strips and eases into the tub with him. This washing ritual may have a few Gheyo hints to it, but it is all theirs.</span>
</p>
<hr/><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">When he's seen Theo safely tucked into bed, with Quinn for a cuddle partner, Harry is finally reassured enough to rejoin Sirius and the others in the main sitting room. His presence reassures the rest of his Bonded and that alone, stirs something else.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">A strong, protective urge. An instinct that Harry works hard to keep carefully controlled. His magic is strong on its own and his Empathy makes it a hundred times more powerful. If he isn't careful, terrible things can happen.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Great power. Terrible power. Enormous responsibility. Harry cracks his knuckles, slowly. Theo's confirmation did not ease the gently simmering temper he's always kept carefully buried. He will have to remember to only let a little bit of it out.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Just a little bit.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">It is Halloween Night, after all, and they have permission slips for the kinds of things he wants to be doing.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"Harry?" Sirius floats onto the cushion on the lounge beside him. "You're thinking awfully hard there."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"Just thinking, Sirius," Harry says, his smile a bit sharp. "How did Theo find you? Did you call for someone?"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Sirius flickers half-blue, half-silvery-white. There is a contemplative expression on his face and finally, he floats in front of Harry, his dark eyes quite serious. "You know that we cannot control when we manifest into your realm and how we will arrive?"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"Yes."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"Your parents left a full cycle before I did, but upon arrival, I could not sense them anywhere. I followed a trail that led to James—all the way to the Purging River. There was someone—something—delivering souls across the waters."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"And you went after them alone?" Harry says. It's hard to hide his exasperation and he knows that Sirius can see it.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">And there's that familiar, pained expression on his godfather's face. "Harry, I didn't want to, but I couldn't help it. There was no time."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"There's always time, Sirius! Suppose something happened to you—again. All of you! I've only just barely seen you all more than a handful of times. If you disappeared—if this—everything, disappeared, I couldn't stand it. I can't lose you again!"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"Oh, Harry." There's regret in his face as Sirius floats closer. His ghostly hand brushes over Harry's cheek. "I am so sorry I wasn't there for you. I know there's no excuses or explanations for the way our parting was, but you have to know it wasn't on purpose. I didn't want to leave you like that or-"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Harry twitched, faintly, under the ghostly coolness of the hands patting his head. "How did Theo get mixed up in this? Wasn't he just passing by?"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"...yes."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">The lie, when it comes, doesn't quite hurt. Harry can't figure if Sirius is protecting him or Theo, but the gesture, though is only somewhat appreciated.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"And he helped you?" Harry's eyes narrow faintly, green finger flickering at the corners.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"He helped your mother," Sirius says, flatly. "She asked him to help the rest of us—your father included."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Harry's not surprised at that admission. Theo has a soft spot for mothers. Especially any motherly figure in Harry's life. Of <em>course</em> he'd react to Lily Potter being in danger—whether she was fully corporeal or not.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">It's then that the rest of Sirius' words register. "You said you had no choice?"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Now, Sirius balks. He'd meant to cover that slip of the tongue, but it's a little too late. "Harry, don't take it that way. Harry-"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"What way? There is order in everything. That's how Death likes it."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"Harry!" Sirius can't keep the fearful sharpness from his voice. He knows what Harry is going to do and already knows that he can't do anything about it. "Don't risk it. Don't risk all of this! You have everything that you need and-"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"I had peace for a little while," Harry says, calmly. "It was very nice. I'm glad you were able to come and visit, Sirius."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"What? Harry? Harry, where are you going?"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"Nowhere," Harry says, lightly. Too lightly. He's finally made a few connections of his own and now Theo's incomplete explanation is making a little bit of sense. "It's just that I promised I'd stay out of it—as long as they left us out of it. This is not leaving us out of it."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Harry!"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"You can help if you like, Sirius. Keep an eye out for me, please?"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"Harry James Potter!"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"It's Nott, you know. Harry James Gorgens-Nott." The smile on Harry's face is far too cold to add any warmth to the first freezing swirl of icy magic that blossoms beneath his feet.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">There is righteous anger coursing through his veins and he'll be damned if he lets it melt and trickle away to nothing. There are <em>rules,</em> for Arielle's sake. A whole library full of the rules that he has to follow.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"What are you going to do? You can't take it on alone!"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"It?" Harry swivels to stare, there's a vaguely calculating look on his face. The way Lily always looked before she charged into battle, headfirst. He's had suspicions and now, Sirius has confirmed them.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Sirius looks stricken. "Don't-" he tries, but there's no strength behind his plea. He knows Harry. Knows him the same way he knew James and Lily. Harry is their son and there are some things that cannot be erased.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Harry's smile is far too bright. "Something you want to share, Sirius? Now's as good as any other time."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"Can't you call one of your-"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"It's late. My Bonded need their rest and I need to work out my frustrations before I take it out on them," Harry says, matter-of-factly. "If you don't want to help, you don't need to. It's alright. I can manage."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"None of this is alright!" Sirius splutters.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">But Harry doesn't pay him any mind. They leave the manor and head to the property line. It takes a touch of Air-magic to float a little faster than walking, but Harry uses the moment to sort out how he wants this to happen.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Sirius can't think of a single way to stop Harry's single-minded determination and he doesn't know what else to do in his current form. Reluctantly, he floats along beside Harry, aware that whatever will happen—is going to happen.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Harry feels it then, as the wards reach out to touch him. He's close enough to feel their warmth and protection washing over him. Definitely close enough to see the massive swarm of blackness frothing and fighting overhead.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">There isn't an ounce of fear to be found in him. Harry remains calm, cool and collected. He rolls up his sleeves, wand in his teeth, as he buttons the cuffs on his jacket sleeve. Quinn had stenciled some calming runes on his wrist earlier in the day and now, they're helping to store a bit of excess magic.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"Harry!" Sirius pleads. "I can't help you more than-"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Wand back in hand, Harry rolls his shoulders back. His shoulders twitch, his wings shifting restlessly inside of him. His eyes burn the brightest shade of emerald green that they've ever been in some time. "Be my lookout," Harry reminds him. "I trust you Sirius."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">And Merlin, those are words that Sirius can't ignore. He huffs, ghostly arms crossed over his chest, as he watches Harry start the first spell. "That's the biggest swarm I've ever seen."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"Fabrine don't cluster like this, unless something is herding them," Harry says, quietly. "That means it's a Rouge Blight. I've listened to Hadrian complain enough to know that's how it works."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"Blights are supposed to be-"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"Pure? Good? Every kind of white magic imaginable?" Harry says, sarcastically. The wards are already unraveling where he's asked. "They're formed from Banishing Lights. You know that. If the light isn't neutral enough, then the intent changes when it evolves."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"Shouldn't you wait for backup or—something's coming," Sirius says, straightening up. "Harry—Harry, this is bigger than-"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"How big?"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"Enormous."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"Great," says Harry, cheerfully. "Just what I need."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">When it arrives, The Blackness swallows it whole, turning a once-pure entity into something else entirely. The sky remains dark and thunderous, while flashes of light crackle overhead. A storm without the agony.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Wand drawn, Harry points it to the sky. "Expelliarmus," he murmurs. There's no need to shout, after all. A dark wand with a shiny knob flies out from the cloud of Fabrine, to land at his feet. Harry sighes. "Expecto Patronum!" </span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">And his magic obeys. There's something pure and unrestrained in the way that his patronus is no longer a stag, but rather—snakes. An entire army of snakes that pour out from the tip of Harry's wand.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">They charge upwards, streaking through the sky, wide-fanged mouths swallowing the blackness with each massive gulp. And there's so many of them. Harry's focus is strong and the spell is happy to convey his wishes.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">The Fabrine is devoured alive and Harry's patronus remains a Hydra, with ever-growing heads. When everything fades out, there's an angry shriek in the distance.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Harry smirks. He trots through the break in the wards and off the property line. This kind of magic doesn't necessarily need to be tied to him, after all. "I warned you," he says, calmly.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">The flailing figure is furious though. He refuses to be silenced in the way he howls his displeasure. "You miserable excuse of a wizard! You'll meet the same sticky end, you <em>will</em>-!"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"Mr. Malfoy, you've been sentenced to work off the debts that prevent you from reaching the next level of your—journey," Harry says, delicately. Because it is quite clear that Lucius Malfoy is very, very dead.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">He begged Theo to make the deal, because Draco is something of a friend these days and Mrs. Malfoy had turned out to be quite nice. But there is always drama where the Malfoys are concerned and Harry doesn't like the thought that Lucius had a hand in Theo's current condition.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">In fact, it leaves him borderline murderous, really. His wonderful Theo. Harry yawns, hearing his jaw crack. He's trying to decide what's the best way to make his point. A simple erasure would ruin all the time and effort they've put into this rehabilitation program and that doesn't feel good.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"Because of you! My own <em>son</em> won't speak to me. Won't even <em>look</em> at me!"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"Maybe you should've taken Mrs. Malfoy's feelings more seriously," Harry says. He scans the horizon. There's one more layer to this and he wants it all wrapped up soon. He has plans for the evening, after all. "She might've put in a good word for you."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"She's dead!" Lucius shrieked. "Dead like the-"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"Dead means dead," Harry interrupts. There's a hint of darkness in his gaze now. "And the only reason you're not with her is because of what <em>you've</em> done. I spoke on your behalf because Draco begged me to. This redemption is your choice."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"You tricked me!"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"...that's fair," Harry agrees. Though really, it was a very simple question and he didn't think that Lucius Malfoy could be any <em>stupider</em>, but there was really no telling sometimes. "Usually because you've done something stupid or really stupid. Like now. Just because you're dead, doesn't mean I can't touch you."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"You can't!" Lucius snarled. "Your little guardian couldn't either."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">And that, was precisely the wrong thing to say.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Harry's wand flashes out and it was a matter of three spells and one darkened growl, before Lucius writhed on the grassy hill behind the manor, waves of wispy green-white energy crackling over him.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"This is my <em>home</em>," Harry snarls. "These are my <em>family. </em>This is my world and Theo is <em>my Alpha</em>. I warned you, never to lift your hands against him or any of us, no matter what kind of grudge you think is acceptable to cling to, after all these years."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">The ground trembles.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">A flicker of fear shoots through Lucius. He's regretting ever listening to that old fool that promised redemption and revenge. "I-it wasn't me!" he blabbers, frantically. "W-wasn't me. Stop. Stop it, Potter-!"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">But Harry's burning green eyes hold absolutely no mercy. He tucks his wand behind one ear and gathers magic in his hands. Lucius can't escape the shining light that literally dissolves him into a handful of shimmering stardust.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">He shrieks and wails, but just as quickly as he's started his revolt, it's over. Harry is always thorough anyway. It matters little now, how much time he's given to this. It doesn't matter, not when it comes to his Circle.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Harry wipes his hands on his jacket and takes his wand in hand again. This time, he twirls it in one hand on the way up the hill and to the clear, grassy field behind it.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"You'd better come out," he warns the empty field. "If you don't, we'll have to do this the hard way."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"There's no one here," Sirius says. He stares at Harry in awe, half-casting a glance over one shoulder. He followed, even though he didn't know what he'd do to help. "Nice spellwork back there, by the way. Since when do you know banishing magic?"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Harry grins, but the eerie light is still in his eyes. "Thanks, Sirius. Would you take a message back to Charlie for me?"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"Sure!"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">It isn't until Sirius is well out of sight, that Harry turns back to the near-empty field. His eyes are still brimming with barely restrained power. He's well and truly riled this time and erasing Lucius hasn't eased the thirst for revenge that burns in his veins.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">He's not satisfied-yet. He won't be, until one more thing is taken care of.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"Show yourself, Diablo!" The words are bit off, one at a time.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">So faintly, it's almost imagined at first, but then the shimmering lines grow more pronounced and when the hateful Reaper steps out, his gleaming crimson scythe propped on one shoulder, it's clear that he only wants Harry's soul and nothing else.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"We had a deal," Harry says, coolly. "Leave me and mine alone and I'll leave you alone."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"Weak!" Diablo hisses. "Prancing around with your pretty parade of-"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"My Bonded Circle and their families are none of your business," Harry snaps. "We had a deal. You broke it."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"He was a heartsick fool!" Diablo mocks. "Moping over his wife and son! Deserved to be removed from the realms for his whinging and scheming like a pathetic mortal-"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"Just like you?" Harry asks, pleasantly. "Minus the mortal part, of course."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">The air stills. Time pauses.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Diablo can't look away from Harry's hypnotizing emerald eyes. The magic there, screams and begs for release. It wants to consume and devour—and Diablo is the only thing it can see within reach.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"You can't-!" Another wretched hiss escapes Diablo's decaying mouth, but it is already too late. "You have no authority here."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Harry shrugs. "I warned you," he says, softly. "This is my property—my home. We don't wage war at our doorstep—and I don't play with lives. I never did."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"You're not a Reaper!" Diablo backs away, his scythe now tightly clutched in his bruised, skeletal hands. "No Reaper can touch me without-"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"I can't," Harry agrees. "But he can." He steps aside, the wicked gleam in his eyes filled with every single scrap of emotion he's struggled to stomach for the past three weeks. All the little bits and pieces of news that add up in the worst way. The truth, really, that solidifies why he's going to see this through.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Diablo bares his teeth.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"Hadrian?" Harry waits.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Behind him, rising from the ground, a veritable thundercloud of wrath and destruction is Hadrian. Death's favored one. The expression on his face is quite murderous, but he only acknowledges Harry with a tip of his head as he glides past.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Eyes burn red, shadows stretch upwards and in a matter of seconds, Hadrian is now the Reaper that he has always been.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Harry tucks his wand back up his sleeve. He's done here, for now. Maybe he'll see if there's anything worth salvaging tomorrow. Maybe casting grounds?</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"You can't-!" Diablo snarls. He backs away, his scythe held in front of him. </span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">But Harry can swear that he's seen the Reaper's hand tremble<em>.</em></span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Hadrian's grim look makes it worse as he approaches, his own scythe swirling to life in his darkened hands. "I can," he says, simply. "Because Harry never asks me for <em>anything</em>."</span>
</p>
<hr/><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Harry leaves them to it and makes his way back to the house. He doesn't need to witness what's going to happen. He already knows how it will end. There's an invisible weight that's eased off of his shoulders, now that one less enemy hangs over their head.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Theo will be happy—miffed—but eventually happy. He doesn't like Harry playing with his life like that and if Harry doesn't time things right, he might be in a little bit of trouble.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Just a little bit. But he's better at getting out of it these days and right now, from the sound of things, he's done an excellent job of getting out of it.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">A faint smile touches his face as Harry glances over his shoulder. He can see jagged streaks of crimson lightning and flashes of black and white brilliance. The magic filling the air from a fight to the death between two elite Reapers is intoxicating.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">He'd like to bask on it for a few minutes, but that seems a little tacky. He'll just have to imagine how lovely it feels. If Hadrian wouldn't mind it so much, he'd watch, just to see his ACE in his element.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Charlie waits for him, at the edge of the porch, his expression stern, but relief lining every angle of his tanned body. "Harry," he breathes, folding him up into a hug tight enough to make his bones creak.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Harry wriggles, experimentally, before giving into the hug. It's not that he wants to be free, but he knows that sometimes a Weasley temper lurks beneath Charlie's worry and he likes to brace himself before any scoldings are handed out. "Charlie," he says, softly.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"That was very risky," Charlie scolds, nuzzling the top of his head. "Don't do it again."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Harry grins up at him. "You're terrible at punishments," he says.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Charlie snorts. "I'll try harder next time." He hugs Harry hard again, renewed relief pulsing through their bond. "You banished Lucius."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"Erased him," Harry says. "Couldn't help it. Sorry."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"He was long overdue." Charlie sighs as his hair finally bursts into flame, frothing around his shoulders. "I know you didn't want to give up on him, but sometimes-"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"I can't save anyone," Harry says, surprised to find that there is no heaviness accompanying those words, this time. He has learned, through the years.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"True and people only change when they want to. You can't force them to change, no matter how much you think they need it. Don't forget to tell Draco before he reads about it in the remembrance columns."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"Alright." Harry snuggles into the embrace, losing himself in the warmth and moment. The feeling that everything is alright again, is enough to undo him. He'd rather wait until things are a little more private than just standing out in their backyard.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"That was fast," Charlie murmurs, staring off into the distance. He makes no move to return to the house and that's how Harry knows he <em>is</em> in trouble.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Not with Charlie or rather, Charlie has given him up to a certain someone.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"Charlie?"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">His Beta grins at him, fondly. Much in the same way Theo will humor him, though exasperated. "Not getting off that easy," he says. "In you go. Behave."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Rolling his eyes, Harry slips away and towards the house. He has a pretty good idea of how his evening will be. He's expected that much, after all, even if was tempting to add Charlie to that fantasy for a few minutes.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Hadrian waits at the back door when Harry steps into the manor again. He's displeased and it shows in the sharp slant of his shoulders and the thin line of his mouth.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"Hadrian," Harry greets. He stretches up on tip-toe to kiss his cheek. "Everything's fine. The wards are back to normal."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"And you're in so much trouble," Hadrian growls, snagging him with an arm around the waist and pulling Harry flush to his side. "Put that wand away."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"And if I don't?"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"How much trouble do you want to be in?" Hadrian's growl is a little raspier this time. "Because I'm sure you'd like to actually spend some of your holiday doing things, instead of spending it in my-"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"Hadrian."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"Don't. You said you wouldn't get involved with Diablo again and then Charlie tells me that I need to find you straightaway and to keep as calm as possible."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"You were very calm," Harry says, straight-faced. "Thank you." His cheek earns him a pinch to his unprotected side. "Ow?"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"The only reason Theo isn't here is because he's fast asleep. He'll lose it tomorrow," Hadrian scolds. "What were you thinking?"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"He won't," Harry says, calmly. "I was thinking like Theo. It's hard. Takes a lot of effort." He wriggles a bit to check Hadrian's grip. It's tight. Even if Theo lets him off tomorrow, it seems that Hadrian isn't letting him off tonight.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">That's okay. He's kind of looking forward to it.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Alright. Really looking forward to it.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Maybe Charlie will join them after all. It's not like he had other plans anyway.</span>
</p>
<hr/><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"Theo!" Harry chirps, the next morning. He greets his Alpha with an enthusiastic hug and a kiss to match when Theo enters the kitchen the next morning. "Better?" He tries to nuzzle Theo's chin and somewhat succeeds.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Theo laughs as he nuzzles back. "Better. Thank you."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"Theodore," Hadrian growls from the doorway. "Don't encourage him. Do you have any idea what he did last night?"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">But it's clear to everyone at a glance that just seeing Harry and knowing that all is well, is everything that Theo needs to be alright. There's a tempered sharpness that's returned, but it's dulled in the way that Theo always is around all of them.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Sirius is long gone now that the Halloween Night has passed. There's been an entire host of Shadow dragels tramping around in the backyard, cataloging and filing reports on the incident. Harry had watched them until Quinn had announced breakfast.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"He took care of a threat to our Circle," Theo says, smirking. "If you feel otherwise about his method and my attention to it, then please take it up with us later. Preferably after breakfast."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"He already took it up with me last night," Harry says, lips halfway into a pout. It was a good night, but he's not above milking it for all he can get.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"Did he, now?" Theo kisses the tip of his nose, amused. "I'm sure he was thoroughly satisfied at the end result."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">And of all the things to say, <em>that</em> is what makes Harry's face turn as red as the fruit in Quinn's fresh fruit parfaits.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"Theo!" he protests.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"Yes, my treasure?"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"Not fair!"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">"Oh, I'll show you fair..."</span>
