    <p>
  <span>Jason wants to scream. His </span>
  <em>
    <span>father</span>
  </em>
  <span> decided that they weren’t going to spend even a month in Ohio. Apparently the job was far to easy once he brought the idea of gays into negotiations and </span>
  <em>
    <span>boom</span>
  </em>
  <span>. No more monument.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He’s so tired of moving all the time. He really thought that maybe, just maybe, this girl Veronica would be good for him. But no, they just had to move. Well, only Jason.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>For reasons unbeknownst to him, Jason was being sent to the UK. It’s not like he’s the reason there’s food or even a steady income, after all. In a strange way, it’s almost an indirect version of revenge.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>So now Jason is standing in front of a house next to an orphanage were apparently someone who agreed to take care of him resides. He doesn’t even know how his father has connections to a foriegn country. He’s as patriotic and militaristic as one can get in America.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The door opens to show a man no older than 35. “Who the hell are you?” He asks sharply.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Jason sighs and looks back down at the slip of paper his father gave him and back at the house and street. It’s the right house. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I apologize if I’m intruding on your weekend. My father sent me here to stay until I am old enough to live on my own, I believe. He gave me this address, which is yours. If you don’t know my father, Bud Dean, then I will be on my way to find work and a place to stay. If Britain's economic system is at least as miserably decent as America’s, I will be fine.” Jason tells the man. He’d been worried that his father had given him a red herring, and it seems he was correct. Lucky him it took a while to travel here and Jason does not think mindlessly.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The man looks Jason up and down and looks at his bag hanging off his shoulder. “What’s in there?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Jason opens the flap to show a few worn books, clothing, and travel sized necessities. He takes out one of the books, which happens to be his book on Nietzsche. “What you would expect in a travel bag along with a few light reads on psychology and philosophers. This one is actually one of my favorites.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The man nods. “I do not know your father. However, it wouldn’t hurt to have you stay for a day or two until you get a job, I believe. Do you have the ability to go back to America?” He asks.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Jason shakes his head and the man steps aside and gestures for Jason to enter. He walks into the small house with a grateful nod.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He’s surprised to see the lack of technological objects. There’s no telephone, TV, or radio, at least. The man closes the door and leads Jason to a small bedroom.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“This is where you will stay. Remember, I’m not housing you for weeks, just a few days.” He says.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Of course.” Jason nods. “I apologize again, I didn’t get your name. I’m JD.” He introduces.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“William Smith. Does JD mean anything?” William asks.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Jason glares at the bed. “Jason Dean, my name. But JD is the name I prefer.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>William nods when there’s another knock on the door. He pales. “JD, you need to hide. Now.” And he rushes out of the room. JD tilts his head and takes out one of his guns. He checks that it’s loaded before clicking off the safety and hiding in the closet. He aims the gun to the entryway, were the bullet should hit anybody with an average height in the upper leg or hip.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>JD hears muffled talking. Two voices he can’t identify and one that is William. And a hiss. There’s a yell, and a flash of green, and a thud. Well, that’s a new thing. Is that a Britain thing?</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Footsteps come closer to the bedroom JD’s hiding in, and he gets ready to fight the hell out of this house. A tall man in dark and flowey clothing walks in and holds up a stick. JD quickly ducks as he says some sort of language and shoots the man in his lower abdomen.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The man falls down in shock as JD vaults over the bed and steps directly on the hand holding the stick, making it fall to the ground. He lifts his gun and shoots a masked figure square in the chest and places his gun on the tall man’s head.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Who the fuck are you?” JD spits. “And what the fuck did you just do?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The man stares at JD with crimson eyes and starts laughing. He starts laughing like he just heard the funniest joke and moves his free hand. The gun shoots out of JD’s hand to the hallway and JD is thrown back on the bed on top of his bag. He takes out his Nietzsche book. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The man picks up his stick and stalks towards JD. “No wizard has ever managed to make me bleed, and yet.” He waves the stick and the bullet comes out and the visible hole in his abdomen closes. “A muggle has given me what could have been a fatal wound and killed one of my men, along with disarming me. Too bad you can’t live.” And the stick is raised.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>JD throws the book and it hits the man in the face. He takes out another one and jumps at the man and smacks it across his face.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You talk too much. It’s like I’m back in high school, but which one is the real question?” JD grins down at the man with insanity as he pulls out another gun from his trenchcoat and turns off the safety. “You better hope I’m a bad man.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The tall man stares at JD with some unknown emotion. “Are you sure you’re not a wizard?” He asks.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>JD laughs. “Yes. Otherwise my </span>
  <em>
    <span>father</span>
  </em>
  <span> would be dead for my mother.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The man and JD stare at each other for long seconds, staying perfectly still.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What makes you think you can kill me?” The man finally asks. “What if I’m immortal, or a god?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>JD smiles as if he had just heard the answer to all his problems. “Then I’ll shoot your head and cut you up like Westly would do to Prince Humperdinck, and I will have no issues with it. If I had the ability to, I would have blown up every school I ever went to since I was seven. I don’t care about your life, or anyone else’s. As you can see now, I am a bad man. Because you are still without lead in your skull.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The man’s red eyes seem to glow with power. “There is always an exception, isn’t there?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>JD lets out a cackle. “That there is. And I don’t believe I will live long enough to find it.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The man lowers his stick and takes a step towards JD, who cocks his gun in return. “I do believe I want to have a conversation with you, Muggle. On the grounds we do not harm each other.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>JD’s eyes narrow. “I keep my gun. Safety on. In my pocket. You leave your stick.” He agrees.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The man gives a light chuckle and places his stick next to JD’s bag. “It is my wand, Muggle. Now, let’s go sit in the dining room.” The man leaves, and JD follows to a room with a table with a few chairs</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Would you like something to drink?” The man asks, and JD feels pain fill his heart. No more 7-11. No more places to call home. JD guesses that he’s finally gone to a place meant to kill him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No. You wouldn’t have what I want, anyway.” He waves the man off. “There’s no 7-11 in Britain.” He says as he sees the man’s questioning look.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He nods and sits down, as does JD. “I’m just going to ask questions, and you will just ask questions. Does this sound fair, Muggle?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>JD nods. “Call me JD, not Muggle. Or call me Muggle, if you hate my name.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The man sighs. “JD, then. I am Lord Voldemort.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>JD laughs. “Lord ‘Flight of Death’? Man, anyone who knows French must be so confused.” The man glares.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Call me Marvolo, then. If you hate my name.” He tells JD, reusing his words.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It is a title with the Lord. If you want my title, call me JD, son of a shit faced bastard. Oh! Or maybe Sir Pyromaniac Arsonist, if you want to get fancy.” JD says as he looks at the man.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The man glares at JD. “And JD isn’t a title the same way Voldemort is?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No.” JD answers. “It is my initials. But it’s better than my given name of Jason </span>
  <em>
    <span>Dean</span>
  </em>
  <span>.” JD spits out his name with venom. “I do not wish to be connected to the man who pushed my mother to suicide.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Marvolo sighs. “It seems we both hold grudges against our fathers and are without mothers. Where did you grow up?” He asks.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“All over America. We moved every three months or so. You?” JD answers.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“The orphanage next door. Where simple minded children attacked me for my prowess.” Marvolo hisses.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>JD nods. “Rather sad, don’t you think? How the strong and intelligent are hated and belittled and then expected to make the world better for those who hurt them?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Marvolo looks at JD, who’s brown eyes are glazed over in memories. JD shakes his head. “What brought you to that conclusion?” Marvolo queeries.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Many people. My teachers, counselors, peers, most of all my father. The only good he’s ever done for me is to teach me how to blow things up, make bombs, and how to shoot. Why did you keep asking me if I was a wizard?” Jason leans forwards in curiosity.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Marvolo takes a deep breath. “Wizards are real. I am a wizard. In fact, I’ve been gathering followers and working on making all magic equal and bringing back traditions since the muggleborns have taken them away.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>JD tilts his head. “Muggleborns are like how the British and Spanish explorers killed over 75% of the native populations of the Americas, but for magic.” He deduces.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Marvolo nods. “Normally I would kill all Muggles that I come across. However, you seem different. You don’t want to kill wizards, nor do you hate magic. You attacked me and killed one of my followers out of self-preservation rather than radical prejudice. And you’ve agreed to have a conversation that’s revealed we have more in common than one would think. I only have one question left. Would you kill simply because someone told you to?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>JD thinks it over for a few moments. “Maybe. If it is someone who has my trust, and I have theirs, yes. If it is someone I love, without question. Otherwise, no, unless I want to. Are you going to kill me now?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Marvolo smirks with mirth. “No.”</span>
