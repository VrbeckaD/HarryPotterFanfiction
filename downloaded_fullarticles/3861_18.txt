    <p>Harry beamed as he watched Ginny walked down the aisle. She looked beautiful in the tailored navy blue robes that complimented her flaming hair surprisingly well. He looked to his left to see Luna staring at her soon-to-be wife with loving eyes. Harry took Ginny’s bouquet from her as she took her place on the altar, opposite from Luna.  Their vows were beautiful, and had everyone in tears by the time they finished.</p><p>“I now pronounce you wife and wife,” said Luna’s great uncle, who they had gotten to be their minister. The two leaned in and kissed as their guests erupted into cheers and applause. Harry grinned and clapped along with everyone else, the love he felt for both of his friends was so strong, and he was extremely happy for them.</p><p>After the war, Harry and Ginny both realized that they loved each other like brother and sister, and parted mutually as friends. In fact, their past relationship was often brought about as a joke, and Ron liked to tease that Harry turned Ginny gay. But everyone knew that Ginny and Luna fit better together than Harry and Ginny ever could, and Harry was quite relieved at that. He realized that he had used Ginny as a way to be legally apart of the Weasley family. When he and Ginny broke up, he apologized extensively for this, and Ginny with her fierce temper was mad at him for using her, but understood his reason.</p><p>Another realization for Harry, was that he was bisexual. When he told Ron and Hermione, they both gave him a look that said, <em>do you think we’re stupid? </em>Even Ron had concluded some things from the way Harry would look longingly at both boys and girls during their Hogwarts years.</p><p>“So, you’re- you’re okay with it? I’m not a- a freak or anything?” Years of hearing the Dursleys ramble on about how disgusting the gay couple who lived down the street was flashed through his mind. <em>Disgusting faggots, polluting our children, that’s what they’re doing</em>. Vernon had liked to say when the Sander-Davies could be seen walking with their adopted son.</p><p>“Of course not, Harry! Blimey, calling you a freak would have me going against Ginny, wouldn’t it?” Ron had told him reassuringly.</p><p>“Harry, we’ll love you no matter who you choose to love, you deserve that happiness,” Harry beamed at their words and had enveloped them both into hugs. He felt so loved in that moment, and for the first time after the war, he felt a small shrivel of peace. Two months after that day he was walking into Luna and Ginny’s wedding reception with Justin Finch-Fletchley on his arm.</p><p>The reporters had gone into a frenzy as he walked into building, shouting inquiries about his sexuality, and if he was in a relationship with Justin. He seemed a bit nervous, and Harry gave his arm a reassuring squeeze as they stepped into the hall the Weasley’s had rented for the wedding. Harry smiled at Justin before walking over to take his place at the head table beside Neville, who was Luna’s best man. They both gave their speeches that had half of the guests in fits of laughter, and the other crying from the emotional parts.</p><p>“To the happy couple!” Harry shouted, and the room repeated his words with enthusiasm. The rest of the wedding went very well. Harry danced with Justin a couple of times, and found him to be a fun, even if shy, person to be around.  They didn’t kiss, but promised to meet up for a pint sometime before Justin left for Auror training.</p><p>As Harry laughed with his arms slung around Seamus and Ron’s shoulders, singing to a song they didn’t know, he felt like the pressure and guilt from the war was lifted from his shoulders, not entirely, but enough.</p><p>Harry said his goodbyes, wished Luna and Ginny a happy honeymoon, and left with Hermione and Ron to go back to the flat they shared in Hogsmeade. Ron and Hermione weren’t together either, understanding that they were both better as friends.</p><p>Their flat wasn’t big, but managed to fit the trio just fine. Harry still had Grimmauld place, but it held too many memories that he wasn’t ready to deal with yet. There was a sitting room with an overstuffed couch and armchairs, similar to the ones found in the Gryffindor common room. Bookshelves lined the walls, holding the books Hermione couldn’t fit in her room, along with several photographs and potted plants.</p><p>The kitchen was full of muggle appliances that Ron refused to touch after a peculiar incident involving the toaster. There was a wooden breakfast table that had a view of the village, and even a distant glimpse of Hogwarts.</p><p>The three of them stumbled into the flat laughing about nothing at all, sporting grins and equal levels of amusement. They murmured goodnights and went to their separate rooms. Harry got into his bed and fell asleep right away, the night was fun, yet a tiring one. As he dozed off, the last images that flitted through his head were the happy smiles of his friends and the way everyone seemed to forget about the war for one beautiful night.</p><p>***</p><p>Two years later, and not too far away, Draco Malfoy was on the receiving end of news that he had anticipated. He knew what was wrong the minute Astoria sat down with him.</p><p>“You’re pregnant,”</p><p>“I’m pregnant,” they both spoke at the same time, Draco smirked.</p><p>“Damn, how do you always do that? You knew when I told you about my Healer internship and now this!” She yelled but there was no mirth to her words.  </p><p>“How old should he be when we divorce?”</p><p>“I’d say at least two years, and how do you know it’s not a girl?”<br/>
<br/>
“At the moment I cannot come up with any Malfoy men who have produced a girl as their first-born, and you know I have the family tree memorized by heart,” Astoria sighed and shook her head fondly.</p><p>“Alright, we should tell our families now, yes?”</p><p>“Yes, I’m certain mother would kill me if she found out I did not inform her immediately,”</p><p>Draco stood and they both visited each family together, informing of them of the pregnancy, but only Daphne was to know of the coming divorce. Astoria trusted her more than she was willing to admit.</p><p>They entered their townhouse and sat down together in the sitting room.</p><p>“How’s Millie doing?”</p><p>“Oh she’s lovely, I’m seeing her tomorrow night,” Draco raised a brow, this would be the fifth time she would be meeting up with Millie this week. “Speaking of dates, why haven’t I seen you with any hot young men?”<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Draco raised his left arm, showing the faded mark, “I think you may be forgetting a certain detail,”</p><p>“Yes, but that doesn’t mean you can’t use a glamour and pull every once in a while,” Draco rolled his eyes. He knew he could do that, but abhorred the idea of his glamour fading and his partner recoiling in disgust at the sight of him. “And besides, there are plenty of men who would be willing to overlook it, you are very handsome you know. If I wasn’t a lesbian I would probably enjoy our sex life,”</p><p>Draco laughed and kissed her cheek as he stood, “I’m going to visit Pansy, I’ll see you later, Stori,”</p><p>“Think about going to one of those gay bars!” she shouted as he stepped through the floo.</p><p>Draco supposed that he and Astoria would be a good match if they both weren’t extremely gay. They had an agreement that as long as they produced an heir, they could go out with anyone they wanted while still being married to the other. Draco loved Astoria, but not in the way their mothers had hoped.</p><p>She was his best friend, and even though their marriage was arranged, he wouldn’t pick anyone else to be his wife.</p><p>He greeted Pansy at the little cafe she had grown fond of, a little shop on the edge of Hogsmeade. Pansy’s taste was often questionable, but Draco found the little tea shop, with it’s fairy lights and light yellow walls, wasn’t all too bad. The tea was good as well, Draco thought as he sipped his peppermint blend. He crossed his ankles and relaxed as he listened to Pansy go on about how awful the man her parents had introduced her to the night before was.</p><p>“Far too full of himself, and this is coming from me! It seemed as though he wanted me to applaud him for bringing the bloody wine! Fucking narcissist,” Draco smiled at her rantings, he didn’t realize how much he had missed hanging out with her. Nothing was ever normal after the war, but they were healing, very slowly.  </p><p>“Takes one to know one,” Draco said, quirking up the end of his mouth.</p><p>“Oh fuck off,”</p><p>It was August, a little over two years after the war and Draco had surprisingly kept in touch with most of his Slytherin peers. He and Pansy had tea almost every Sunday afternoon, on Friday nights he would have a pint with Blaise, Millie, and occasionally Theo. And at least three times a month, he, Astoria, Daphne, Pansy, Blaise, Theo, Millie, and Greg would meet up to eat dinner as a group and get pissed.</p><p>He had expected them to have split up after the war, it was the most realistic outcome. But they were Slyterthins, and would stick together for as long as possible.</p><p>“Stori’s expecting,” Draco said casually in between sips of his tea. Pansy shrieked, attracting the attention of the people around them. She ignored them and clapped her hands.</p><p>“God, it’s like fifth year all over again,” Pansy rolled her eyes but was smiling joviantly.</p><p>“Oh! I’m going to be an Aunt Pansy!”</p><p>“And a terrible one you will be,” Draco said, smirking. Pansy smacked his arm playfully.</p><p>“It’ll be a spring birth! Oh, imagine you getting the alert in the middle of a lesson!” Pansy laughed and Draco huffed. He had been the Arithmancy professor at Hogwarts for a year now, and was mortified at the thought of his students hearing about the birth of his son in the middle of class. He would much rather have a proper, public announcement.</p><p>A half-hour later he was bidding Pansy goodbye. There was a little potions shop he needed to go to for Astoria’s maternity potions. He walked out of the door of the little teashop and right into the person he had been hoping to avoid.</p>
