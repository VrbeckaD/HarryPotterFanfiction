    <p>Severus Snape could feel his body floating through the air. Well not exactly floating, but he knew something was different and he wasn't sure what it was. The last thing that he remembered was being bit by a snake, if you would call it that. His last moments involved releasing some memories to the child of Lily Evans. Now here he was, filled to the brim with regrets. He regretted causing the death of Lily Evans and her family. He regretted being a death eater. He regretted ending the friendship between him and Lily. Lily was the one he loved, the friend he admired most. Looking back, he saw the friends he had back in Slytherin, but they weren't really friends to him. They were more like the people that would cause him to reach the point of no return. <em>Why did I have to fuck up like that? I should have known better. I should have done something differently. I regret everything I have ever done, </em>Severus thought to himself, nearly crying.</p>
<p>He felt a mysterious force push him down. Severus looked around at his surroundings and noticed that he was sitting on a path surrounded by white pillars. In the distance he could see someone, someone who seemed too familiar, someone who he knew. <em>Lily, </em>Snape thought to himself, <em>I'm so sorry. I fucked up, don't tell me that I didn't. I joined the death eaters, spyed on the Order for Voldemort. I treated Harry terribly and made his life a living hell during potions class. I delivered the prophecy to Voldemort that caused your death. I never should have done any of this, I regret it so much. I hate myself for hurting you. I mean it Lily. Ever since the day we met, I was in love with you. I wanted you to be mine.</em></p>
<p>Lily walked towards the Potions Master, the tears welling up in her eyes. She knew he had been through a lot, from living with an abusive dad to having the Marauders bully him. Yet her former best friend turned out to be the good guy in the end. That had meant a lot to Lily, she would have been romantically interested in Snape had he not been interested in the Dark Arts. She didn't hate Snape, in fact she had been pregnant when she died and had talked James into letting her</p>
<p>name Snape as the future child's godfather. James reluctantly agreed and they both wanted to apologize to Snape.</p>
<p>Snape ran up to Lily, tears building up in his obsidian eyes as he hugged her, repeatedly muttering, "I'm sorry Lily, I'm sorry. You didn't deserve this at all. I never should have supported Voldemort, I regret it so fucking much. Please forgive me. Please."</p>
<p>Lily looked at the man who was completely broken down in front of her. She felt bad for him, his mistakes had finally caught up to him, yet she couldn't find it in herself to forgive him for the way he had treated her son. Or any of the members of her former house. Especially the poor boy Neville. Lily pushed Severus away from her saying, "Forget it Snape. I can forgive you becoming a death eater, but I will never forget that. Especially with the way that you treated Harry. My poor baby. He didn't deserve that. Go away."</p>
<p>Snape ran off, his black robes billowing behind him as he ran. He needed some time to himself, he wasn't in a very good mood at the present moment and he needed to clear the thoughts that wracked his brain from his head. He found a tree and found himself sitting at the base of it. He thought he saw James in the background. Or was it Harry?</p>
<p>James was running up to him, the laughter rising in his throat. He wanted to laugh so hard. Finally he could get revenge on Snape. His son had never deserved any of the mistreatment from Snape and James would see to it that he would get revenge on the much older and wiser man. Sure he had grown up a lot since the fifth year, but he had been wanting revenge after he had been hit with the killing curse. "Hey Snivellus, how's heaven working out. Oh wait, this is Hell. I'm sure Lily would have accepted you had this been in Heaven. You're just a worthless grease bag. Wash your hair."</p>
<p>Snape ignored the nagging comments from his arch nemesis and he ran off, seeing the worn face of his mother who had been crying. "I'm sorry Eileen for the way I acted. I'm sorry. I just want another chance, please."</p>
<p>Eileen's tear stained eyes stared into Severus's and she could see that her son had been crying. Her son had locked away emotion; Tobias hated it when his son had shown emotion and would beat him whenever the emotion came out. Yet her son was crying. That had to mean something, he only showed emotion when something was seriously amiss. "It's okay Severus," she said, stroking the soft hair of her son.</p>
<p>"No it's not Mom. I fucked up," Snape wailed like a child.</p>
<p>"Severus, there's a way to get a second chance. If someone seriously regrets something they did, they may have the ability to go back into the past and change whatever they did for a different outcome."</p>
<p>"Mom, I think that's what I need."</p>
<p>Before Eileen could say anything, Snape felt himself being whisked back into time, he felt his body reach strange contortions and he woke up. Touching his face to rub his eyes, Snape was surprised to see a small, pale, lanky hand do the action rather than a hand worn with age. He got out of his bed and looked at himself in the mirror covered in dust.</p>
<p><em>I'm eleven years old again</em>, Snape thought to himself.</p>
