    <p>Pain so much pain. Harry's head was spinning as he woke up in his cupboard. He felt like he was going to be sick. He tried to remember what had happened but his mind kept drawing a blank. Since when was that new though? He shifted and regretted it as his body seized in a fit of pain. His spine bowed and he couldn't breathe what vision he had blurred. When the attack passed he was left gasping for air and shaking. Tears stung his eyes. He saw a blue screen floating in front of him. </p>
<p>

</p>

  <b>Your ability to take and block out pain.<b></b></b>
</p>
<p>
 <i>'Screw you.'</i> Harry thought to himself and the screen. He pressed the red 'X' and the screen closed. <i>I've got to get out of here. I can't take anymore of this. But how?'</i> He lay there trying to think. <i>'I can't just leave my things here but I doubt that I can pull it along. I'm not strong enough. On top of that I'm probably being watched this summer as well. I wish I had a place to store my things so that no one but me can get to them. Heh something like on one of Dudley's video games. An Inventory.'</i>
</p>
<p>
 A blue screen with blank screens appeared in front of him. He blinked. He took a few calming breaths and sat up. Pain shot through him again. He wondered if this would work. Searching around he found his old baby blanket. He put it in the screen and it appeared in the first slot. He pushed his hand in the screen again and pulled it out no damage. He smirked and put it back in. He quickly used a bobby pin from his hair to pick the lock of the chains on his trunk and began cleaning it out putting everything he wanted into his Inventory. He left everything that wasn't important behind. He took all of his school stuff of course. Nodding to himself he put his wand in his pocket and found the muggle money he kept hidden in his cupboard it would get him to London to the Leaky Cauldron. 
</p>
<p>
 He tried his door and found it unlocked. He opened it and listened straining his senses as much as he could.

 He could tell everyone was up stairs so he snuck out of his cupboard and shut the door locking it. He went through the kitchen and out the sliding glass door. He made it was shut behind him. He bit his lip then decided to go over the back wall he just needed to make it without any gaurds catching he looked to the front. Near the street that he could see he was shocked to see a name even through he couldn't see anyone.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Molly Weasley</b><br/>
<b>Order of the Phoenix, Overbearing Mother</b><br/>
<b>Level: ???</b>
</p>
<p>
Harry smirked to himself. 
</p>
<p>
<i>'Overbearing is right.'</i> Harry thought.
</p>
<p>
He began sneaking towards the back wall.

</p>
<p>
<i>'Screw Fucking you!'</i> Harry yelled mentally.
</p>
<p>
Harry was insulted by the level as he snuck through the night. He quickly went over the back wall knocking off his glasses as he did. 
</p>
<p>
He kept creeping through the night until he came to the muggle underground. He stopped using Stealth and payed for a ticket and quickly boarded the train. He had a train care alone for which he was grateful. 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Harry blinked waking at the voice announcing that they'd reached his stop. He quickly got off the train and made his way on to the street. He only had to go two blocks before he got to the Leaky Cauldron. He took a deep breath, which hurt like hell, and went in. It was virtually empty and no one looked at him except Tom who frowned as he came to the counter. 
</p>
<p>
 "Is Gringotts open?" Harry asked desperately. 
</p>
<p>
 "Wont be until seven, Mr. Potter." Tom said in a low voice. "Come on, you can rest in a private room until  then I'll wake you." 
</p>
<p>
 "Thanks, Tom, I can pay....Once I go to Gringotts." 
</p>
<p>
 "You look like shit and you're bleedin', Mr. Potter." Tom helped Harry on to a couch. "Let me treat your wounds. No charge." 
</p>
<p>
Harry got some first aide and all the bleeding he was doing stopped. He thanked Tom. 
</p>
<p>
 "What happened, Mr. Potter?" 
</p>
<p>
 "Don' wanna go home." Harry murmured as he slid into sleep.
</p>
<p>
 That spoke volumes to Tom who felt rage go through him. Harry Potter was being abused. He wondered if anyone else knew. He quickly summoned a blanked and covered Harry up and went back to the counter
</p><hr/>
<p>
 Harry sat in front of Griphook who was going through Potter paperwork trying to find away to get Harry away from the Dursley's and Dumbledore. 
</p>
<p>
"Come on, Griphook!" Harry cried, there were three other goblins in the room. "I'll give you a 50 Galleon bonus if you find something! Anything!" 
</p>
<p>
 The Goblins were shocked and Griphook doubled his efforts smirking to himself. Harry Potter certainly knew how to speak his language. 
</p>
<p>
 "Ah." Griphook finally said, ten minutes later. "I have found something at last but you will not like it, Mr. Potter." 
</p>
<p>
 "What is it?" Harry wondered, fidgeting. He regretted it as pain shot through him again. He'd been here nearly two hours. 
</p>
<p>
 "Marriage contracts." Griphook replied. "Four of them that are coming do. If you do not activate them you could lose your magic on Halloween of this year. You will have to live with these men until you are eighteen then you must choose one of them and marry that person." 
</p><hr/>
<p>
 "I feel sick." Harry muttered. 
</p>
<p>
 "Save it for when you hear the families the contracts are with." Griphook sneared. "Prince of which the Lord is the only one in the main family. Severus Snape being that man." Harry dry heaved and one goblin got a waste basket. "LeStrange of which there is the youngest son Rabastan." Dry heave." Lord Lucius Malfoy specifically." Dry heave. "and the Gaunt family......" 
</p>
<p>
 "Thomas Marvolo Riddle II." Harry cried desperately. Then was violently ill as Griphook nodded. After ten minutes Harry stopped tears in his eyes. "Contact them please. We'll sort this out."
</p><hr/>
<p>
 An hour later all four men were sitting with Harry in the room. Among Harry's four goblins four more had joined. Griphook was in a shouting match with them in Goblygook. As was the eldest Goblin. Harry surmised the other two were the elder Goblins guards. Harry coughed a bit. 
</p>
<p>
 "Griphook, I'm gonna be sick again." Harry said, suddenly.
</p>
<p>
 Griphook snapped something and one of the guards got Harry the wastebasket which was now empty. Sure enough Harry was ill. 
</p>
<p>
 Tom, Severus, Lucius and Rabastan watched the boy it was clear to all over him that he was hurt and ill. He looked feverish. 
</p>
<p>
 "What is this about?" Lucius finally demanded. "Potter looks as if he needs a Healer so if we could please hurry this up." 
</p>
<p>
 "Marriage contracts." Harry wheezed. 
</p>
<p>
 "Excuse me?" Severus drawled "what did you say, Potter?"
</p>
<p>
 "Marriage contracts." Harry repeated sitting the wastebasket down and wiping his mouth. "Four of them between the Potter family the Gaunt family, the Prince family, Lucius Malfoy, and the LeStrange family. I'm the last Potter so ......." He shrugged. "If we don't activate them by this Halloween we all lose our magic."
</p>
<p>
 "That contract between the Potter's and I is void." Lucius said, to the Goblins who were silent now. "I married my wife instead." 
</p>
<p>
  "I'm afraid the wording in the contract means it is still active." Griphook said, clearing his throat. "and will remain until you marry into the Potter family or Mr. Potter the final Potter marries someone else and becomes Lord Potter. Than you and he may mutually deactivate the contract." 
</p>
<p>
 "Lord Potter?" Harry asked, "I don't understand." 
</p>
<p>
Everyone in the room stared at him in shock.
</p>
<p>
 "Dumbledore has never told you of your heritage?" Severus demanded.
</p>
<p>
"No." Harry said, weakly. "Look, we'll save that for later shall we? We need to get this sorted. It wont be long before Molly Weasley notices I'm not fast asleep in the house like I supposed to be. She'll alert the Order and they'll come looking for me. I'd like to be behind strong wards before that happens." 
</p>
<p>
 That spoke volumes to everyone. 
</p>
<p>
 "Harry is quite right." Tom finally spoke. "Show us these contracts. Let us read them." 
</p>
<p>
 Harry blacked out halfway through reading the one about the Gaunt family.
</p><hr/>
<p>
 Harry moaned waking up. He was laying on a soft bed and staring at white ceiling. 
</p>
<p>
 "Hospital." He said, instantly. 
</p>
<p>
 "St. Mungo's, Mr. Potter." a female voice said. "I'm Andromeda Tonks." 
</p>
<p>
 "I don't trust you," Harry said, instantly looking at her. "Get away from me." 
</p>
<p>
 The woman looked shocked. 
</p>
<p>
 Harry noted the Malfoy's and Snape were in the room. 
</p>
<p>
 "I assure you....." 
</p>
<p>
 "Get away from me!" Harry yelled, sitting up. "NOW!" 
</p>
<p>
 "Harry, calm down." Lucius said, "Andy is not going to hurt you...." 
</p>
<p>
  "Her daughter is in the Order!" Harry snapped, "She's going to tell her daughter I'm here and then Tonks in going to tell Dumbledore and I'll be right back with the Dursley's!"
</p>
<p>
 Everyone let that sink in. 
</p>
<p>
  "I am a Healer, Mr. Potter." Andromeda said, softly. "I am bound by contract and Oath. I can not tell a soul you are here or reveal to anyone your medical history without your consent. " 
</p>
<p>
  Harry frowned at her hard. He looked at Snape. 
</p>
<p>
 "Is that true?" He demanded. 
</p>
<p>
  Severus cocked an eyebrow. 
</p>
<p>
 "Yes, A Healer's Oath is magically binding." He stated. 
</p>
<p>
 Harry frowned at Andromeda. 
</p>
<p>
 "I bet Dumbledore can find away around that! Occlumency!" He snapped. 
</p>
<p>
 Severus tried to repress a smirk. 
</p>
<p>
 "I know he knows Legitimacy!"
</p>
<p>
 "He does." Andromeda conceded. "But, Mr. Potter, I was raised in the Black family...." They all watched Harry wilt and pain swallow him. They all knew why as well. "We all master Occlumency before going to Hogwarts......" 
</p>
<p>
 "So what?!" Harry snapped, his voice cracking with pain and emotion. His mind on Sirius. "Dumbledore is one of the most powerful wizards in the world. Tom and Snape are the only ones who can block him out all together!" 
</p>
<p>
 Severus did smirk that time. There was actually a brain in Potters head after all. He had to give points to Potter for realizing that he was that powerful and skilled himself. 
</p>
<p>
 Lucius shot Severus an amused smile and got a smug smirk in return. 
</p>
<p>
 "You're right about that, Potter." Severus said, "But between her Occlumency and her Healer's Oath Dumbledore will get nothing. She can not mention anything that goes on here at work. She can be trusted." 
</p>
<p>
 "No she can't!" Harry spat. "Her daughter is in the Order and she was blasted off the Black family tree!"
</p>
<p>
 "How do you know that?" Andromeda and Narcissa chorused. 
</p>
<p>
 "Sirius showed me." Harry said, in a whisper. "last Christmas......" his eyes filled with depression. "He was blasted off too....."
</p>
<p>
 "You've been in the Black Home." Narcissa gasped, hand to her mouth. 
</p>
<p>
 Draco was getting tired of this but he was still trying to come to terms with his Father, Godfather, Uncle-in-law, and Lord all courting Harry Potter or losing their magic. He glanced at Potter. The other teen looked like he needed help. His mind raced. 
</p>
<p>
 "Geesh, Potter, you're acting like such a chicken what would the Lions say if they could see you now." He teased. 
</p>
<p>
 "I'm not acting like a Chicken, Malfoy!" Harry snapped, "I'm being cautious!" 
</p>
<p>
 "I can't believe your scared." Draco went on. 
</p>
<p>
  After ten full minutes of goading from Draco Harry finally let Andromeda take scans of him. His rage was building he was so angry. He missed Draco smirk and Lucius, Narcissa and Severus pat Draco's back in a job well done.
