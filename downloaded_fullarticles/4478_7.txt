          <div class="userstuff"><p>Severus Snape flung open the door so violently that it slammed back against the wall. He looked livid, his hair sticking out in all directions. Minerva noticed with surprise that his shirt was untucked, and he wasn't wearing any shoes.<br/>
<br/>
"Good gracious Severus, have you been <em>fighting</em>?"</p><p>He snarled, leaning forward with his hands on the doorframe. She stepped back in alarm. He looked positively deranged.<br/>
<br/>
<em>Accident with a dodgy potion?</em></p><p><br/>
"There is a <em>witch</em>, Minerva," he hissed, "against all reason and probability, there is a witch. In there."<br/>
The Potions master jerked his head towards a door behind him.<br/>
<br/>
<em>An intruder in the castle?</em><br/>
<br/>
 Before she could say anything however, he continued.</p><p>"Oh yes, there <em>is</em> a witch. Would you like to know what she is doing, Headmistress, in there?"<br/>
<br/>
His tone was almost conversational now, but neither it nor his rage could quite disguise something akin to unholy glee. Suddenly, she felt that answering him might not be the correct choice.<br/>
<br/>
"She is <em>tied up</em>, Minerva. In my <em>bedroom</em>."<br/>
<br/>
<em>Perhaps he's drunk? Or been at Pomona's private herbs?</em></p><p>"And she's <em>not</em> wearing any clothes."<br/>
<br/>
He'd leaned out to faux-whisper the last part in her ear in a sibilant, menacing hiss. She went scarlet from ears to tartan slippers.<br/>
<br/>
"So, Headmistress," he stepped back, face now a mask of indifferent enquiry, "What was so urgent that couldn't wait till morning?"</p><p>Completely out of her depth, she opened her mouth to snap at him.<br/>
<br/>
Eyebrow aloft, he mouthed the word "naked!" at her. She sputtered.<br/>
<br/>
With a last ghastly grin, he jumped backwards and slammed the door.<br/>
<br/>
<em>The poor man has finally cracked. I wonder, should I send for Poppy?</em></p><p><br/>
She hurried off, oblivious to the hilarity which erupted behind the dungeon door.<br/>
