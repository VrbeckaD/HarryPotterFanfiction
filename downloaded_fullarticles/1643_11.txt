    <u>PROLOGUE: THE OCTOBER STORM</u>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Dear diary,</em>
</p><p><em>Where to begin? I suppose the present is always a reasonable place to start with – it’s raining right now, just as it was nearly three years ago, when all this began. It’s raining so hard that</em> <em> I can barely see out the window. It’s cold outside, I can tell, but I’m warm here in my bed, with my little lamp on. James is dead to the world lying beside me, but our baby is restless; I can feel it shifting. It’s been eight months now. It won’t be much</em> <em> longer. </em></p><p>
  <em>The story I’m about to tell you is one I never really intended to put onto paper. You see, there are so many stories inextricably intertwined with this one that I never felt I had the complete right to tell it. There is so much heartache, so muc</em>
  <em>h mystery, and so many secrets that it’s almost as if this story is the very darkness which has seeped into our lives, and I suppose, in some ways, it is. None of it would have happened if our lives had not been marked for change. </em>
</p><p><em>I’m not going to take y</em><em>ou back to the very beginning of seventh year, for everything from the train trip on September 1</em> <em> <sup>st</sup> </em> <em> to that stormy October night was very uneventful, unless you count James being made Head Boy. After all, that surprised me (not that I’d mention it these day</em><em>s). </em></p><p><em>Instead, I’m taking you back to a night when thunder raged and the sky flashed white every few seconds as lightning split it; the rain was torrential, as today. Maybe it was an omen, a cliché, that such terrible weather would signal such a change in </em> <em>our circumstances, but that was just the way it was. </em></p><p><em>As I said, I never intended to be the one writing this tale. I don’t think of myself as terribly eloquent – Kes, perhaps, or Remus, should be the one recording this, but I know Remus, at least, wants t</em> <em>o block most of it from his memory. I got to thinking the other day as I waited for my regular Maternity Healer appointment that my child should know his or her mother’s story, and the story of the people she loves, even if someday I’m not around to tell i</em> <em>t. </em></p><p>
  <em>And so here it is. My retelling may not be the most eloquent, and I may not know why some things turned out the way they did, and let me warn you that this is certainly not a tale with a happy ending, but it is what it is. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Our story begins with a le</em>

  <strong> <em>October, 1976</em> </strong>
</p><p>
  <em>My dearest sister,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>You cannot imagine how difficult this is. You wouldn’t think, for example, that it would be so hard to write what I’ve always suspected and now know, safe in the knowledge that this letter will never reac</em>
  <em>h your eyes. But it is. </em>
</p><p><em>Despite our best efforts, our family has manipulated every aspect of our lives. They took our mother from us, and they broke our father’s heart. And, in doing so, they took a piece of each of ours as well. Maybe I cannot think of </em> <em>them as monsters, but I know their flaws well enough. And so, </em> <em>Isidora dear, I am confused. How can we have thought one thing for so long, and yet have the truth be another thing entirely? </em></p><p>
  <em>I’m sorry, love, if I’m not making any sense. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>I think maybe, dee</em>
  <em>p down, you always knew the truth. It was repressed, perhaps, but it was there; you used to call out in your sleep for our mother, always in the shadows of our lives but never actually present. But you don’t remember that, and I don’t care to remind you. </em>
</p><p><em>But the truth is, </em> <em>Isidora, they never even denied it when they discovered I knew! All these years, they tol- - - </em></p><p>Lily Evans frowned at the torn edge of the parchment; it was like a teasing crumb left behind to intrigue and infuriate her. She’d never before made a habit of reading other people’s private correspondence – the idea went against all of her morals – but this particular letter had enthralled her for several reasons.</p><p>The first was the manner in which she had come upon it. For years when she had had difficulty sleeping, Lily had snuck into the Hogwarts library. There was nothing like reading a good book to stop the ticking in her mind and allow her to relax. It had been so tonight – the violent rain and an excess of homework had stopped her drifting off easily.</p><p>So, as usual, she had broken into the library and wandered the shelves looking for a book. Her eye had been caught quickly by a thick, leather-bound volume with an unmarked spine. She had slid it off the shelf, marvelling at the intricate and incredibly life-like bat in full flight that was depicted on the front cover, beneath which the word ‘Drakula’ was pressed into the leather. Her recollection of how much she had loved Stoker’s book the first time she had read it had moved her to open it; in retrospect, she would think about how out-of-place the Muggle book had been in the school’s library. In any case, at the time, the apparently well-loved volume fell open virtually at the centre, revealing the folded letter.</p><p>The lettering was slanted, elegant, and somewhat familiar, as black as night on pale parchment; the first couple of lines had demanded Lily’s attention immediately. And, finally, she was well and truly intrigued by that single important name: <em>Isidora.</em></p><p>It didn’t matter which way you said it – Isidora, Iz, Izza – the only Isidora Lily knew was Isidora ‘Izza’ Moldovan, one of her best friends, whose own unusual circumstances were too similar to what was described in the letter to be coincidence. Izza was an intensely private person; she always had been. As such, even Lily knew very little about her family; they were Romanian, or her father’s side was, anyway. Her mother was Swedish. It made no difference, Izza sometimes said, because they were both dead. Her mother was long dead, and her father was, too, apparently of a broken heart. Izza’s older brother, Kes, had practically raised her. He had to have been the one who had penned the letter. Lily peered at it, tilting her head slightly to the side. When she looked at it properly, the handwriting was similar to Izza’s, which was probably why she thought it familiar.</p><p>Lily knew she should throw the letter away and forget about it, but she also knew that it would be impossible. Her mind was already racing with a dilemma – should she show it to Izza, the person to whom it was addressed, but also the one never supposed to lay eyes on it? Her own curiosity too was proving difficult to deal with. She wanted to know the terrible truth – what had Kes been about to reveal? She knew the Moldovan’s were difficult and manipulative, but what had they done? What had they kept secret? What was so explosive?</p><p>A noise like a footstep made Lily jump and nearly drop the heavy book. She clutched it to her chest and listened, her heart racing in her ears, but no noise followed. As quietly as possible, she shut the book and replaced it on the shelf where she found it, putting the letter into the pocket of her dressing gown.</p><p>“You promised me.”</p><p>Lily froze at the sound of the voice. It was low and rough, the timbre undeniably male. It sounded urgent, with an undercurrent of betrayal. Lily didn’t move; she had a feeling she shouldn’t make her presence known.</p><p>“Darling, don’t be ridiculous. You’re so dramatic sometimes, it’s cute.” A second voice joined the first, a low purr that sent a chill down Lily’s spine.</p><p>“You said she’d be safe, but where is she? How am I supposed to trust you or him when all of you twist everything in your favour?”</p><p>There was an exasperated sigh, as if this was an oft-explained, simple concept that the male had never quite grasped. “Have you not received everything I promised you? Have I given you reason to mistrust me?” The female voice dropped an octave, shifting into a more subtly seductive gear. “Your little girlfriend is fine, just as I promised. However, her remaining that way is entirely up to you and how consistently pleased I remain with you.”</p><p>“But-”</p><p>The female voice interrupted smoothly. “I’m tired of this conversation. Same time and place on Thursday. Am I well understood, darling?”</p><p>“Yes.” The male voice was resentful. Moments later, soft footsteps retreated, followed by heavier ones; after a tense minute, Lily was sure she was alone once more.</p><p>Her heart was racing, and she was reeling at the turn her mundane night had taken. She could still hear that menacing female voice in her ears; despite her fear, she longed to know what they had been talking about.</p><p>Lily’s heart continued to gallop all the way back to the Gryffindor tower. She only remembered the letter she had found when she reached her dorm. When lightning flashed, she could just make out Izza’s silhouette.</p><p>As silently as she could manage, Lily opened her bedside drawer and hid the letter within a book. She then climbed into bed and pulled her hangings shut, knowing it was useless – she felt like sleep was a million miles away.</p><p>As she lay there, she felt like every sound was amplified in the room; she could hear Mary MacDonald’s heavy, even breathing across the room, the steady lash of rain on the window, and the rustle of sheets as Izza moved restlessly in her sleep.</p><p><em>‘Stay asleep, Izza,’</em> Lily pleaded silently with her best mate.</p><p>Izza sighed. “For fuck’s sake,” she murmured, half-asleep, and seconds later, Lily heard her pull her hangings back and cross the room to the bathroom. Lily felt a stab of sympathy for her friend; she hated it when Izza had nightmares.</p><p>“Lily.”</p><p>Lily jumped at the whisper of her name. She sat up just as Marlene McKinnon poked her head through the hangings. Lily beckoned her and she climbed into the bed, her goldish-brown hair tickling Lily’s cheek.</p><p>“She’ll have a bad day tomorrow, won’t she?” Marlene said quietly. Lily didn’t even have to ask who. “She’s been up and down about three times now.”</p><p>“Has she?” Lily asked without thinking.</p><p>Marlene sat up, frowning at Lily. “Where have you been?” She smiled mischievously. “I didn’t think even the Head Girl was allowed to wander the corridors aimlessly at night.”</p><p>“I wasn’t wandering aimlessly,” Lily whispered, feeling herself flush. “I was thinking. I have a lot on my mind.” That much, at least, was true.</p><p>In the bathroom, Izza was crying.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>“You look like hell,” Sirius Black said to Izza over his glass of Firewhiskey. She glared at him with those eldritch violet-blue eyes of hers - eyes that currently had dark, bruise-like shadows beneath them. </p><p>“Sirius,” Remus said warningly, glancing at Izza. “You know better.”</p><p>Izza was staring at her own Firewhiskey in a contemplative sort of way. “It’s all right,” she sighed. “He’s just telling the truth.”</p><p>It was Friday night, and the seventh years were doing what they did best – drinking to forget how much homework they had to tackle over the weekend. Most of the younger students had evacuated the common room, and those that remained, Lily thought, had stupidly forgotten how wild her classmates got when they had a few drinks in them. Like Peter, for example: Peter was a lightweight at the best of times, and half a bottle of Ogden’s best had him dancing around the room by himself, completely off and away in a world of his own.</p><p>Lily liked a drink or two herself, but she, and often Remus, was usually eclipsed by the others. She preferred to allow her motherly instincts to kick in and take care of the others – particularly Izza, who had always had a talent for the reckless – instead of writing herself off. Thus far, it had been a typical night; Peter was already on his way to a killer hangover, Remus was starting to loosen, and Izza and Sirius were going drink for drink, as they would until Izza tried to do something stupid and dangerous, at which point she and Sirius would disappear to somewhere quiet and alcohol-free until she was over it. Lily had once found them behind a statue, playing rock-paper-scissors. The trick was to distract her.</p><p>Mary was a bit of a lightweight, also, and would generally spend the night being even more flirtatious than usual. Marlene would just dance until she dropped from exhaustion.</p><p>The conundrum was James Potter. Everyone else was predictable; Lily knew exactly the pattern that their nights would take. Usually, James could be counted on to be getting up to no good with Sirius and Izza. But, tonight, he was sitting on the windowsill, staring outside. Lily had lost count of how many drinks he’d had, but he wasn’t being somewhat ridiculous the way he usually was. He wasn’t (loudly) coming up with insane plots to win her heart. Every now and then, he would glance at Izza and Sirius, as if checking on them the way Lily did, but he remained where he was, a picture of seriousness.</p><p>Lily didn’t like it one bit. She’d reached seventh year thinking that that was it, that she’d known these people for six years, that there wasn’t any way they could possibly surprise her. And yet Izza was still a mystery (Lily didn’t like to admit she’d never quite figured her best friend out as well as she claimed to), James had done a personality 360, and Mary was whispering in Remus’ ear (this last was more trivial than anything; Mary would grow bored in a few days and move on to someone new).</p><p>She didn’t like mystery; she never had, except in literature. Her parents were pragmatic, practical people. She liked fact, and she liked what she could see and prove. And so, she decided, as she watched James run a hand through his hair and sigh, she was going to get to the bottom of all the mystery in her life. James, the letter, and that conversation; she was going to unravel it all.</p>
