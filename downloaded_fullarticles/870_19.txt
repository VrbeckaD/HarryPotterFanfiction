    <p>Thin wisps of frost cracked under warm, weathered bare feet while his breath misted in front of his face. Weary, bright green eyes scanned his surroundings like the flickering of a searchlight. Searching for anything or anyone, that would do him harm.</p><p>Harry glanced down as he squeezed his toes into the dead patches of grass underfoot. The grass was covered by melting layers of snows flakes; delicate and light figures that had fallen with such grace. He frowned sadly at the sight of the slushy snow and the yellowing grass. He never liked it when the garden died. First the falling leaves and now the menacing ice crystals. They both had both plotted the destruction of his well-beloved garden.</p><p>It wasn't exactly his garden and his only, but he cared for it as if it was. And like most things in his life, he could do nothing to save it. It was something that his aunt was too impatient to tend to and she pushed the task onto him. He had to care for the lovely flowers, meticulously weed the mischievous vines that winded around the tall trees that shielded him from everyone. His aunt would much rather use her long neck to spy on her neighbors rather then to peek at the budding flowers and use her spindly hands to tend to her grubby little boy.</p><p>If Harry had been asked to describe his cousin, he would compare him to a big, fat weed. One that soaked up all of the sunlight, making it so that Harry could be compared to a delicate tulip; easy to bend with fragile petals that floated away on harsh winds. All that Harry wanted to do was to uproot that little weed but the harsh wind, which held a likeness to his Uncle Vernon, would surely punish him if he struck back at little Duddlykins. Dudley seemed to absolutely charm his Aunt Petunia, similar to how a dandelion charms little children. Harry's aunt acted like her namesake. For while his aunt was seemingly well-liked, she was as deadly as Nightshade. A close relative to Petunias.</p><p>Harry had been told about these flowers from a little, gray snake that claimed to have come from someplace called Africa and had traveled around the world. Encountering hundreds of animals and learning a bunch of things from the places that he visited. He knew a lot about Petunias since he had passed many hot regions in Southern Europe; where he says many variations of the Petunia bloom and romanticized the Deadly Nightshade. The plant was spoken about in such a flattering light that Harry often wondered if he could crush its berries and mix it in with his relative's food.</p><p>Even if he did find a patch of Atropa Belladonna, he knew that he wouldn't-- couldn't do such horrible things like they have done to him. He was, however, very glad that no one could read his mind and view those old, flashing fantasies. Many would be surprised by his dark thoughts but years of having time to delve into his own mind gave him a sense of familiarity with his thoughts. They were almost comforting. Some were depressing, like when he was curled up in his cupboard, wishing for it to all end; and some were scary, just like his thoughts on killing his relatives.</p><p>He knew that his heart was kind though, since the snake had told him many times before. "A true heart of gold," he had said. He was the only one who Harry seemed to be able to talk to, the only being that he trusted in his small, lonely world. He said that his name was Imari and he dubbed Harry, 'Jabari'. Harry didn't understand the name or its meaning to Imari, but he liked it more than any of the names that he was called by the people inside the normal looking house behind him. Harry only knew his own 'name' because of their next-door neighbor, Mrs. Figg.</p><p>She had caught him once in the past, bringing in the groceries, and his aunt had had to introduce him to her. Only to appear normal, of course. She had looked down at him pointedly and said that he was Harry-- her nephew that was often ill and couldn't go to school because of his sickness. He felt like his aunt had made the name up on the spot with the fake story, therefore he detested it.</p><p> So far, he hadn't had any need for the normal name, as he rarely went outside of the backyard anymore,and his aunt and uncle kept him from going to school. Harry hadn't even known what a school was before Imari explained it. When he was younger he just assumed that his Uncle Vernon took Dudley to do whatever errand they needed to run. Imari told him differently at the start of the cold season, when Dudley was leaving the house more frequently. Harry had asked Imari many questions and the snake was more than happy to entertain the boy.</p><p> Harry was taught all he knew from the reptile, often times while he trimmed the leaves of the fenced garden; both hidden in the thick trees. Harry's sharp eyes surveyed the blank white yard, his heart already aching for his friend. Imari had warned him of his hibernation of course, but he still missed his friend.</p><p>His aunt Petunia had just pushed him out of the back door right after making an early breakfast for the three. Said breakfast would act as an appetizer for when they go out to get a big lunch. Harry walked towards the bushes where Imari was sleeping in a deep hole under some branches, a nest that Harry had made specially for him. He shifted in his large shorts and tattered shirt, unwashed hand-me-downs that his aunt had given him years ago. They were even more dirty and grubby looking, as they hadn't been washed since then. Instead of filling the clothes in as he grew older, Harry found himself to almost be shrinking like a little grape, drying into a raisin under the beating rays of the sun.</p><p>The cold made his joints hurt and the dim light of the rising sun made his eyes strain behind his very broken glasses. He absently wondered what was so special about today. Hell, he wondered what was so special about this whole month! All month and the months before, Dudley had been whining about getting more and more gifts-- whining much more often than any other time of the year. Uncle Vernon had even brought in a tree to the house like last year, and his Aunt Petunia made him cook trey after trey of cookies in all sorts of weird shapes. He had heard the peculiar songs play on the radio as well, songs about mother's kissing a pair of claws or something. He never did understand these normal people, much like Imari didn't understand humans. Well, humans besides him. Rubbing his tired eyes with a yawn, Harry stiffened as he heard the bushes near him rustle.</p><p>Harry had problems with the creatures that wandered into his garden at times. But that's to come when your family (If you could call them that), throws you outside at any possible time that they can. He felt his empty stomach churned nervously at the thought of dealing with an animal by himself. Harry took a few deep breathes, making sure to keep his eyes on the area where the rustling came from. Harry slowly stood up just like Imari told him to, and started to shuffle towards a tree all while making himself look larger in case it was an animal that wanted to eat him.</p><p>Without a second of hesitation, Harry climbed the tree just as a medium-sized cat slinked out from under the bush. 
It looked like a walking corpse. Its ribs were caved in and its hungry eyes looked around the snow-laden grass, just as he had done a few minutes ago. It was searching for a mouse or a squirrel that hadn't made it to their tree before the cold winds came in and the snow knocked the leaves to the ground. Harry sympathized with the black and white cat; his cautious green eyes watching it prowl around the yard and step over his dead plants. He watched it go over to the garbage tin and stare up at it, but he knew that there was nothing in it. He had already scavenged the crumbs that the Dursley's left in it.</p><p>It was a desperate season for the both of them. Harry observed the way that the cat seemed to droop when its delicate nose couldn't pick up any scent of food. It sluggishly climbed one of the smaller trees as to get to the neighbor's yard. A hop over the fence and the cat was gone as abruptly as it had appeared. Deciding not to waste any more of his limited energy, Harry stayed perched in his tree. Breathing in icy cold air that pierced his lungs, while his teeth clattered together in a symphony of bones and his lips gradually colored blue.</p><p>It felt like decades had passed before his aunt called him in. Always in that low voice, her lips barely moving as she stood in the doorway. Huddled up in a cheaply made fur coat, Petunia beckoned him down from the tree, her gaze disapproving as he sluggishly lumbered down on the thick branches. "Are you some monkey, boy?" She asked him in a disdainful voice when she closed the door behind him, his eyes blinking slowly as he frowned. He glanced up at his dolled up aunt and gave a soft shake of his head. His aunt scoffed, giving the back of his head a swat with her wool glove. "Just get into your cupboard," She commanded, pushing his bony shoulder towards the normal looking door that hid years of torment behind it.</p><p>He nodded quickly, not wanting to get into his uncle's path. The fat man was bustling around the house as Dudley played with his new toys. Harry barely glanced at the new devices, knowing that his aunt or uncle would accuse him of planning on stealing any of his cousin's trinkets. He opened the door and allowed his aunt to shut it harshly, barely getting his ankle out of the way before it snapped shut. </p><p> Alone again in the darkness it seemed. Harry listened as the floorboards creaked dangerously over his head, the staircase groaning as Dudley ran up and down them. Hurriedly stuffing toys into his room, his greedy hands taking more and more. Never sparing Harry any. He didn't much care for toys, though, so no tears were shed on his part. It was a cycle, this life. Imari had told him about cycles-- cycles such as the Buddhists' and Hindus' reincarnation cycle. Whenever imari taught him, Harry would almost drink in the information like the few drops of water that he was allotted. Harry connected his life with this information, that he was like the Untouchables in the Caste System. An outcast who was accused of doing something wrong in another life.</p><p>Maybe he did do something horribly wrong in his other life. Harry thought this to himself as he huddled up on his old, tattered mattress that acted as a bed. His blankets were riddled with unwashable dirt-- flecks of dead skin and crumbs that were just as old as him. They were filled with the pungent smell of urine resulting from years of nightmares and nights stuck in the cupboard without a trip to the loo. He felt much better in here though, at least in here he could stay warm. Locked outside, warmth was stolen from you, taken from every breath that you exhaled. His thoughts whirled around like a hurricane, his mind jumbled from the cold and the new layer of utter sadness blooming in his chest. </p><p>'This is what I get for having friends,' Harry thought dejectedly, his lips set into a deep frown as his very blood seemed to pump loneliness throughout his body. As lost in his thoughts as he had been, Harry suddenly realized that the house was silent. So used to the constant noise that came with living with people like the Dursley's, Harry was actually quite startled by the quiet.</p><p>He sat up slowly, his heart pounding rapidly in his ears as if to replace the noise of the telly or the stomping of feet. Running his tongue over his chapped lips, Harry brought his hand timidly to the doorknob. When he was younger, he used to try to open the door but was always bad at guessing when the Dursley's were gone. Often times he was beaten as a freak was when they tried to get out of their cupboards.</p><p>His stomach growled fiercely from not having a fortnight of anything but rotten fruits and spoiled milk from the garbage tin. He had been sick the entire time, miserable when he awoke and melancholic when he went to fall into a fitful sleep. Putting his ear to the door carefully, Harry double checked that they were actually gone. Nothing reached his ear through the door, besides the suddenly blissful cry of silence. </p><p> Harry slowly brought his hand up to the doorknob and twisted it gently. He gave a soft gasp, his eyes widening as he found the knob turn with his hand. Gripping it like a lifeline, Harry opened the door a crack. He brushed his neglected hair out of his face as he peeked through the opening, listening again at the doorway. He couldn't believe that they had forgotten to lock the door! Harry suppressed a giddy giggle as he crawled to the kitchen, knowing to avoid the windows. Even if the curtains promised to hide him from the eyes outside. He slowly stood up from the tiled floor and reached out for the refrigerator door before having second thoughts. He quickly changed his mind and made his way over to the pantry instead, having enough of the disgusting fruit for the time being.</p><p>In this empty kitchen, he would eat whatever he felt like eating. As he scanned the contents of the pantry, he worriedly thought of what would happen if his aunt, or even Dudley, realized that some food had been taken. Letting out an anxious breath and bouncing on his toes, Harry carefully moved the containers around until he made it to the back of the pantry. He found an old can of tuna fish. Probably the exact can from a few years back, when his aunt had bought some only to find out that her little Dudders hated tuna. </p><p> Harry could care less about when it had been bought, he could only think about how hungry he was and how his stomach seemed to be trying to eat itself no matter how much he put into it. Moving everything back to where it had been, Harry pulled the tab open swiftly, lapping up the oils that threatened to spill over the top as he hid under the table. He didn't give a thought to why he was crouched under the kitchen table, he could only feel a sense of protection; a sense of relief at being hidden.</p><p>For when he was hidden, Harry had no worries. He didn't have to slave over his messy cousin; be harassed by his aunt; or beaten to a pulp by his unforgiving uncle. Harry knew that nothing would change for him, years of having his hope being torn from his little body forced him to see the reality of his situation. </p><p>No one would want to save a freak like him.</p>
