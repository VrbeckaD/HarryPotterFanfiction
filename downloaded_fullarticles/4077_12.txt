    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p class="p1">Harry possessed power.</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">This was a fact that Tom was quite well acquainted with. Harry’s power was subtle, but strong. Where one might brag of their strength and skill in combat, Harry kept his carefully away from the public eye, almost as though he had no idea it even existed. Others could sense it from him. Others were attracted to it, drawn to it like a moth to flame. But Tom was certain, now more than ever, that he needed to possess it.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">If he was not careful, that hidden power could be used against him.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It was after years of watching the boy, years of gathering information, piece by piece that made Tom realize that Harry had not only possessed this power for ages, he had been ignoring it and suppressing it. Those around him even seemed to dismiss him completely, only recognizing his name, his history and not his true potential. His mentors thought he needed to be cared for like a child. His friends had grown dulled to claims of him sensing darkness around him, and his warnings of oncoming attacks. Even his supposed ‘rivals’ had no idea the sort of magical abilities the boy could truly wield. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> <em>Such a waste of talent. I shall remedy this…</em> </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It was precisely midnight when Tom knocked politely at the plain wooden door to Harry’s unassuming little apartment in the sleepy end of London, once, twice, three times, before he stepped back on his doorstep and waited.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">--</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry was cursed. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He had grown used to it by now, but the fact still remained. No matter what he did, however he tried to remedy his situation, fate always seemed to pull the rug out from under him at the very last minute. The only things that kept him from ending it all were his friends and the hope that tomorrow would be better. It never was, but he clung desperately to the possibility that things would change. For him, even the smallest victories were victories. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">But even those minute successes couldn’t stop the nightmares that plagued him every time he closed his eyes. The death of his parents was the worst. He would find himself jolting awake, covered in sweat. Vampires, they said. A secret coven, lurking right under their noses. Many had tried to uncover the true nature of the coven, but to no avail. Every time someone got close to a revelation, the death count would rise. Harry tried his best to stay out of it all, live as much under the radar as one could with his reputation, but he couldn’t help but warn others when he could feel the darkness the coven seemed to carry setting in. It was, after all, the result of his reputation. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He had been told he was lucky. That he had escaped death that night. It was celebrated as if it was some grand miracle, to survive a vampire attack. Harry didn’t feel lucky. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It was the knock on his door that pulled him from the nightmare that night. He grumbled as he dragged himself out of bed. As grateful as he was, he didn’t enjoy being woken up at such an hour. Snatching his glasses from his bedside table, he groggily made his way to the door.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">--</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The door opened. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Frankly, Tom had not been expecting this. He had expected questioning, horror, hostility, or at least something resembling fear. As far as the ‘vampire legend’ went, there was supposedly no way that he could enter without Harry opening the doors of his abode to him. According to the aforementioned legend, even the great Lord Riddle was bound to the precepts and magical law of the immortal and eternal.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">But Harry had <em>already</em> opened his doors to him, at the slightest prompting Tom could have ever hoped for. A slow smile spread across his pale face as he peered down at the young man. “<em>Oh, Harry</em>.” He seemed to savor the name as though tasting some fine and delicate wine. He let those soft words settle between them before moving fluidly, easily into Harry’s abode. There was something wicked burning within his eyes that seemed predatory.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The small home itself was quaint, small and sparse, but with a lived in quality to it. There were dirty dishes in the sink (the clear sign of a bachelor), a few shirts and bits of clothing strewn about, but nothing overwhelmingly dirty to make it unlivable. A pristine white Snowy Owl hooted softly within its cage from the corner of Harry’s tiny kitchen, as though surprised to find a guest now wandering about this place. Tom tilted his head as he considered the creature, and watched as it tilted its head right back as though mimicking him. He laughed softly as he considered the myriad ways he could kill the creature later, before turning back to his unwilling host and taking in the full sight of him as he stood there blinking blearily in the dark. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry was a short lad in comparison to Riddle, and his nineteen years had not been gracious when it came to endowing him with a muscular physique. But there was something about his slender build that seemed functional, and in extension, beautiful. Tom couldn’t help but note that he smelled absolutely exquisite. In these close quarters, there was something about him that seemed to glow alluringly even in the complete darkness that surrounded them. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Harry, do you have any idea who I am?” He asked softly.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">--</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He opened the door.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Still half-asleep, Harry’s brain didn’t even register that letting a complete stranger into his apartment in the middle of the night might not be such a good idea. He yawned as the stranger entered, wearily blinking away sleep. If he had been more awake, more aware of the situation, he would have been significantly more on guard. For all he knew, this could be one of the vampires from the coven that continued to ruin his life. But between a long day and a restless night so far, he was completely defenseless in his tired state.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry managed to blink the remnants of sleep away at the same time the stranger called his name. Of course, it wasn’t so much a call as a croon. It was said so beautifully, the words sounding like sin tumbling from his lips. Harry shivered when the words reached his ears, his world going silent for a fraction of a moment. Then the moment passed, and everything was as it should be, although the weight of the stranger’s words still lingered in the air.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It was then that Harry finally took a chance to look at his unexpected company. He was incredibly handsome and dressed like nobility, making him seem out of place in Harry’s dingy flat. The man didn’t look to be too significantly older than him, but there was a certain aura he carried, alerting Harry that he was much older than he appeared. And that he was much more than what he seemed. If the aura didn’t give it away, his eyes certainly did; a deep, rich, blood red. There was something predatory about his eyes, as if Harry could expect to be swallowed up by his gaze at any moment. Harry gulped silently, taking a small step away from the man.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hedwig seemed to puff up at the stranger’s sudden appearance, hooting softly and tilting her head in both curiosity and fear. It was as if she could sense that there was something not quite right about the man Harry had make the mistake of letting into his dwelling. Her yellow eyes narrowed in distrust. Hearing her hooting, Harry looked over to his pet, noticing her agitation.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">His eyes flicked back to the man in front of him. Slowly, he shook his head. “Sorry, but no. I don’t know who you are. But I have a feeling I know <em>what</em>.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">--</span>
</p><p class="p1"><span class="s2"><em>Interesting</em>. His ‘keepers’ had never bothered to tell the young lad exactly what his assailant had looked like all those years ago, and perhaps not even what powers he was capable of. The mysterious and deadly Lord Riddle had done his damnedest to keep control of London, as both a coven leader as well as a skilled magic user, but his reputation was hard to pin down with all of the rumors that tended to surface around him.</span> <span class="s1"></span><br/>
<br/>
<span class="s2">One fact had always seemed to string all of the stories together into a single truth. Lord Riddle, the immortal and eternal leader of the Death Eater coven, had brilliant red eyes, a beautiful face, and a merciless attitude. </span> <span class="s1"></span><br/>
<br/>
<span class="s2">Tom’s looks, of course, were nothing like Harry’s though. Harry seemed to be brimming with color, life and energy, even despite his current sluggish state. Where Tom had a cold, pristine beauty about him, as though shaped from porcelain, Harry’s seemed to be sporting an entire rainbow of colors. His skin was a warm, light tan, his cheeks flushed, his eyes glimmering a brilliantly verdant shade of green. He was quite the work of art, an impressionist masterpiece, even while barely awake, and barely functioning.</span> <span class="s1"></span><br/>
<br/>
<span class="s2">“Well, that’s certainly a start.” Tom replied to his host finally with a good natured smile. Magic crackled at his fingertips as he snapped his fingers. The tea pot sitting on the stove jumped to life, screeching as though it had been boiling for ages. Tom made a curt motion with his hand and a teapot slid from the high shelf and floated down, accompanied by two ceramic mugs. “All you have is black tea?” Tom muttered, rummaging through Harry’s spice drawer before sighing in defeat and bringing it over to the teapot to make them something warm to sip.</span> <span class="s1"></span><br/>
<br/>
<span class="s2">“Sit down, Harry. We have a great deal to discuss.” He murmured, pouring the boiling water over the leaves.</span></p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">--</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I’m sorry my tea isn’t up to your standards,” Harry muttered in response upon hearing the stranger’s comment. “I’m not exactly rich, in case you haven’t noticed.” He had only recently finished his schooling, and was currently in the process of obtaining a job, made increasingly difficult by his reputation and orphan status. Very few were willing to take on the dangers associated with hiring such a marked young man, no matter how famous he was. Just the thought of it made his fingers twitch with the desire to run them over his scar, but he restrained himself. Doing so would likely draw attention to the scar and lead to more questions that he was in no mood to answer.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The stranger requested for him to take a seat as he prepared a pot of tea for the two of them. Harry, however, remained standing. “I’m sure we do, but it’s the middle of the bloody night. Whatever you’re wanting to discuss, it can wait.” Walking back to the door, he opened it and gestured for the man to leave. He didn’t care if he was being stupid and stubborn. He didn’t care that he was being rude to a vampire he had accidentally allowed into his flat. He just wanted to go back to sleep.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The stranger, however, made no move to leave Harry in his solace. After a few painstaking minutes of a stalemate, Harry sighed. Taking a seat across from the man, he removed his glasses briefly in order to pinch the bridge of his nose in exhaustion.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Sitting across from him, Harry was struck even more by the man’s beauty. It was as if he walked straight out of a classical painting, kept preserved and pristine for years. Yet there was a deadly aura about him that even Harry could not deny. He knew he had made a mistake, letting him in, and now he had to tread carefully to avoid meeting his doom.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Alright,” he finally said. “What do you want with me?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">--</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Your tea is quite sufficient, Harry. Really, it’s fine.” Tom murmured soothingly as he took his own seat at the table. With a fluid gesture, the opposite chair at the small kitchen table pulled itself out for Harry. All at the same time, two cups drifted from Harry’s taller cabinet, settling themselves next to Tom as he calmly waited for his host to come to his senses.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I’m not going anywhere.” Tom whispered, his voice low, almost threatening. It was a long moment in which they held one another’s gaze, Harry’s stubbornly standing by the door, insisting that Tom leave immediately, but after a long, drawn out moment, they both became overwhelmingly aware that Tom was unswayed. He stared contentedly, his wine colored eyes tracing the gentle curve of Harry’s face, as though memorizing every little feature, every twitch of anger or hint of exhaustion. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">His gaze lingered on Harry’s slender neck.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry finally gave up, slamming the door back into place with perhaps just a touch too much force. He pinched the bridge of his nose, as if warding off a headache. <em>Adorable, human weakness. How quaint</em>. Harry stumbled back into the kitchen and slumped into the chair opposite Tom only to shoot the first question he could think up.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I desire a great deal from you, Harry, but I find it quite curious that you don’t seem very concerned with who I am.” Tom began, his voice easy and smoothed by nonchalance. “And I wouldn’t be too concerned with needlessly bringing attention to your scar and giving yourself away, Harry. I’m quite familiar with your <em>famous scar</em>, seeing as I am the one who gave it to you.” Tom continued with a pleasant smile that never quite reached those dark eyes. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I go by many different names. Most of them are born of fear, but some have more of a perfunctory nature. For the sake of our conversation, you can call me Lord Riddle. Or Tom, maybe, seeing as I’d like to get a bit better acquainted with you.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Tea?” He offered, not bothering to wait for an answer as he poured his host a cup and slid it across the table to him. “Be careful, it’s quite hot.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">--</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Unconsciously, Harry’s fingers flew to his scar when the man across from him brought attention to it. <em>How did he?</em> For a mere moment, Harry’s eyes reflected the natural fear one should have when dealing with an immortal creature of the night. However, the fear left as quickly as it came, despite the creature’s confession to giving Harry the scar that had made him so famous.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I don’t exactly see why I need be concerned,” he finally replied, his voice coming out with more strength than he felt at the moment. “If you had come here to kill me, you would have done so by now, <em>Lord Riddle</em>.” Unlike the smooth, sultry tones Lord Riddle had used when speaking Harry’s name, Harry’s tone was a cold hiss, filled to the brim with scorn.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry was certainly awake now, all the tiredness in his bones replaced with a suspicion and wariness that kept him alert and on edge. There was no doubt in his mind that Lord Riddle was toying with him. For what purpose, he didn’t know. But he had a feeling that he was better off not knowing. One thing he knew for sure: he’d be lucky if he made it through the night the same way he entered it.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">No longer wanting to meet the man’s predatory, wine-colored gaze, Harry turned his attention to the cup of tea that had been thrust upon him. He made no move to take a drink, choosing to stare at his own reflection in the liquid, hands clenched tightly in his lap under the table. For the first time that night, Harry was truly silent. It was uncomfortable, being subjected to such a piercing gaze, and Harry felt as if he was being swallowed up in the other’s eyes, despite not looking at them. His body language was tense, a sign of his inner distress. Yet he stayed silent, saying nothing more as if he feared a reaction from the other. Unlike everything he had so far encountered in his life, this opponent was a complete mystery, one he knew next to nothing about. And, seeing as Lord Riddle apparently knew everything about Harry, he was at an obvious disadvantage.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hedwig hooted softly in the background as Harry was slowly overcome with the feeling of dread.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">--</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry’s expressions changed so rapidly, so drastically, that Tom felt as though he were being mocked for a beat of a moment. He went from being exhausted and irate to shocked in a heartbeat. His hand shot to his scar, running his fingertips along it gently until he slowly lowered it once again, his eyes locked on to Tom, wide with terror. While the vampire did enjoy a certain sense of gravitas in his entrances, there was a tempered sort of anger and acceptance that came with Harry’s realization. The shock value had worn off and now Harry was left with something far different.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Anger burned behind those brilliant green eyes. It seared its way into Tom’s memory, making him think quite forcibly of a young woman he had the unfortunate happenstance of facing off against thrice before she was finally felled. Strange, that he should look so much like his father and yet, Tom could really only sense his mother staring back out at him through those glimmering green eyes of his.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Smart lad.” Tom commented, now pouring himself his own cup of tea before setting the teapot aside. “You’re right, of course, but there’s really no point to killing you, Harry. Not when you’re so very useful to me <em>alive</em>.” Tom spoke softly, gently. He seemed to taste the words, letting them settle between himself and his host as his dark eyes focused on Harry.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The owl hooted softly as the boy absolutely refused to hold his gaze. <em>Petulant little child.</em></span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Why do you think I am here? If not to destroy you, than what else is there?” Tom asked him, his slender fingertips running over the rim of his simple ceramic mug before taking a small sip. Unlike his counterpart, his wine colored eyes never left Harry, as though eagerly awaiting the moment to recapture his bright eyed gaze and slowly draw him in. “You have not been trained to think tactically, I understand that. But, <em>think</em>. What have I to gain by being here? What have you to gain by speaking with me?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">--</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Still looking at his cup, Harry’s eyes widened in shock at Lord Riddle’s words. Useful? What did he mean by that? He wasn’t anything special. There were so many people around him that were exponentially more talented than he was. The only thing Harry seemed to be good at was getting into trouble and avoid dying. His hands shaking, he finally lifted the cup of tea to his lips, in an attempt to calm his nerves. It didn’t seem to make much of a difference, but at least his hands stopped shaking.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry closed his eyes and took a deep breath, letting the remaining warmth of the drink fill his body and relieve some of the chill he felt the longer he remained in the room with the vampire lord. “I don’t know,” he responded to the man’s question, his voice no more than a whisper. He cleared his throat. “I don’t know,” he repeated, louder this time. “That’s why I’m asking you.” His body was tense again, cycling between fear and anger as if torn between how to act in front of his guest. Still, he refused to meet the man’s gaze.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He could still feel Lord Riddle’s piercing look on him, drinking in every little aspect of the young man in front of him. Harry was used to stares, being relatively well known by the general public, but this was different. Lord Riddle’s stare was something else entirely. It was haunting and relentless, following his every motion with a burning sort of hunger. He was loathe to admit it, but the unnaturalness of Lord Riddle’s eyes, coupled with his perfectly sculpted features, scared him.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“What do you want, Lord Riddle?” In a moment of impulse, he looked up into his enemy’s eyes.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">--</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry’s mind really was just as blank as he was telling Riddle over and over again. Frankly, his thoughts were so panicked, it was remarkable that he was able to form complete sentences. His brilliant green eyes darted around the room before focusing on his cup of tea and stumbling over his words. He was trembling like the final leaves of autumn, clinging to their branch for dear life. It was more than apparent now that the boy had not been personally trained by any of his supposed ‘mentors’. They would have made sure that he could hide any shadows of emotions from his face, guarding him from overly observant enemies.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Perhaps they had expected to be able to protect him at all times. How foolishly naive.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Harry, let’s begin with your current situation.” Riddle replied, his voice light and well-mannered and he set his cup back down on the table. “You and your group of human, magic user allies are outnumbered and out skilled by my forces. This is a fact, but this is not entirely why I’m here to speak with you.” He murmured with a nod of confirmation. “Let’s remove my forces from this picture completely. We will pretend, for the sake of this argument, that they are not deadly, trained fighters ready to do my bidding at a moment’s notice.” He said, sliding his hand across the table in a firm motion, as though shifting them off to the side and out of the way. “The fact that they are no longer a threat to you does not guarantee your safety. There are two other, extremely powerful forces that continue to dog you and your companions.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Fenrir Grayback will not stop until he has brutalized those who you know and love. You know his methods, and the havoc he wreaks.” Tom motioned with his left hand, as if to introduce an enemy force to the conversation. “Just in case you need a reminder, he’s responsible for <em>killing, raping and skinning</em> those who oppose him, and you had better hope he feels magnanimous enough to do so in that order.” Tom revealed, his voice dropping to a deadly whisper. “He seeks to destroy Remus Lupin, and you know he will not hesitate to murder you to make it to him.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“And, of course, your association with Albus had brought you to the attention of Gellert Grindelwald.” Tom laughed, a touch bitterly, motioning with his right hand this time. “His methods are mysterious, but it’s not uncommon to hear whispers of ‘necromancy’ in the same breath as his name. I’ve met the man, Harry. He’s no one to be trifled with. He’s been playing this deadly game twice as long as I have, and while I can admit that I’m far better at tactics and war games than he ever can hope to be, he’s far better at experimentation.” Tom trailed, his eyes locked on to Harry again. “He wants to destroy Albus. Yet again, you stand directly in the way of his attack, and I don’t think he would be opposed to turning you or your friends into one of his ‘grand experiments’.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Tom let silence settle between them, folding his elegantly long fingers together over his cup of tea, feeling the heat rise from the steam as he continued to consider the boy from across the table. Those crimson eyes softened as he gazed at him, gradually allowing his hands to settle before him.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I know of a way to save you and all those who you love, Harry.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">--</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry’s mentors and colleagues had tried to train to guard himself, his mind, and his emotions, but their efforts had all been wasted. It was nearly impossible for Harry to be anything but an open book. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t keep himself from being transparent, even when facing off against an enemy. Combined with his somewhat reckless nature, it was almost entirely sheer luck that Harry hadn’t been captured or killed at this point in his life. Of course, he had never been in a situation as dire as facing a vampire lord before. But the two had already established that Lord Riddle was not there to kill him. Harry still wasn’t certain what the reason for the midnight visit was, but at the very least he was certain that he would live to see the next sunrise.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">As Riddle began to speak, outlining his intentions with carefully guarded precision, Harry had to bite his tongue and keep from lashing out. He knew that the group he was involved with was small and inexperienced in comparison with the vampire coven, but they were his family. Even though their odds weren’t the best, they were loyal and protective of each other. They would do whatever it took to take down an enemy. Harry found that he admired their bravery and he didn’t like hearing Lord Riddle talk about them like that. And he hated even more what seemed like an underlying threat that if Harry didn’t go along with his offer, he might as well say goodbye to everyone he knew and loved.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Still, Harry just clenched his jaw and continued to hear the vampire lord out. It turned out to be the best decision he had made all night, as Lord Riddle revealed information that Harry had known absolutely nothing about. From what he was saying, the vampire coven they had been working so hard to take down, while perhaps the closest to home for him, was only one of the many deadly enemies against Harry. According to Lord Riddle, there were at least two other forces plotting against him as he stood in the way of their ultimate goals. If he didn’t do something, he would die at the hands of one of these three leaders, and his death would be used for nothing but destruction of both the world and the mentors he cared deeply for.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It was a difficult situation. If he continued to live and fight against these powers, he knew that his friends and mentors would do anything to keep him safe, and he would not allow any more blood to be spilled on his behalf. But dying also held its own consequences, as Lord Riddle had so <em>kindly</em> outlined for him. If he died, there was no stopping the path of destruction that would follow. It seemed that he was the last line of defense. For everyone.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“What are you suggesting? I can’t say that I’ll accept your proposal, but………” Harry took a deep, shuddering breath. “I’ll hear you out. It’s better than nothing.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">--</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It was the moment of truth. Tom could have planned every second up until this moment of held suspense between them while he decided how to approach such a personal, rather intimate subject with Harry. He was just a poor little mortal human, after all. He couldn’t be expected to fully understand each comprehensive facet of the offer that Tom was about to make, or exactly how very connected and complicated this was about to become.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> <em>But the power Tom could hold…</em> </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Tom simply could not deny what he sensed, even right now, sitting at this shabby little kitchen table with the young man. He could feel that unknown energy radiating off of him. Tom even had his suspicions that Harry didn’t have the slightest idea of exactly what kind of power was contained within him, or that he was exceptional, or special because of it. From what Tom could tell, he simply knew that a good deal of these problems seemed to revolve around him directly or indirectly, and he needed to deal with them head on.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Harry, my noble race has a legend of sorts.” Tom trailed, taking a sip of his tea and savoring the bitter taste, taking the time to choose his next words. “When there is an extremely powerful vampire of noble lineage, like myself, they may choose to create something called a ‘Chalice’.” He explained simply, keeping his terms as elementary as possible.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“A Chalice is an individual who acts as the vampire’s main source of sustenance. They’re not killed by the vampire, or even turned undead. Yet, from what I understand, their senses are honed and they achieve a magical variety of preservation and longevity. This is to say, quite simply that their powers are increased drastically. They evolve into a being that is beyond mere human to something far more perfect, more exquisite. In addition, the vampire no longer has to hunt to survive any longer. They can depend on one steady source of blood, which they will not ever kill. The relationship is purely symbiotic.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Tom fought to keep a knowing smile from his lips. This was no time to be taunting the boy, but the urge to do so was nearly overwhelming. He tried not to look at the boy as if he had him exactly where he wanted him. No matter his answer, Tom knew precisely what would unfold. It was only a matter of time, after all.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Harry, if you if you would be willing to become my chalice, I would protect you and your forces. You would never have to worry over any of the threats that surround you. I would ensure your safety.” He murmured, trying to keep as calm, as comforting as possible, but there was an undeniable hunger burning within his eyes.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">--</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Chalice.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry remembered hearing that word before, likely from one of his friends or mentors. He couldn’t recall much more beyond the recognition of the word, but it wasn’t as if those around him had any information to go on. If his fleeting memories served him correctly, there were very little records of those chosen to be Chalices. He vaguely recalled Hermione telling him about how most Chalices left their human lives behind after forming the bond with the vampire. He gave a small snort internally. He never thought that someday Hermione’s seemingly random bits of knowledge she would share out of the blue would come in handy. The girl was a walking encyclopedia, and Harry had long since started to tune her out along with his best friend Ron.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">A somewhat uncomfortable silence settled in the room after Lord Riddle finished speaking. While Harry was known to be a man of action, rarely taking the time to stop and think things through, he was deep in thought for the first time in months. He sat quietly across the table from the vampire lord, weighing his choices.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">On one hand, entering a relationship with Lord Riddle like the one he was describing would, based on his words, keep his friends safe from any outside threats. However, it seemed to be an extremely risky sacrifice of his own person, and, if he was being honest, Harry wasn’t entirely sure he could trust the man. They had been enemies up until this point, and that was the only thing Harry knew him as. Partnering with Lord Riddle would be like partnering with a very powerful, hungry serpent. And just because their leader would be civil with Harry and his allies didn’t mean that Lord Riddle’s underlings would follow his example.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">As he pondered his choices, Harry looked upon Lord Riddle again, taking in his aristocratic beauty. The man, no, creature, Harry refused to think of him as something as mortal as a man, looked as if he had been carved straight from the highest quality of marble, a perfect statue come to life. His beauty made the hungry, taunting, almost malicious (in Harry’s mind) aura about him all the more unnerving. The power that pulsed from him was nothing like Harry had ever encountered before, and yet he found himself stubbornly refusing to back down and submit to the vampire. Whether it was out of bravery or sheer stupidity, Harry couldn’t say.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">After some time had passed, Harry made his decision. “I understand what you’re saying,” Harry said, his voice almost level. He hoped he was making the right choice. “But I will have to refuse. I don’t need to be anything more than I already am, nor do I want to stand out any more than I already do. As for my friends, I’m sure we’ll be able to manage.” He stood up from the table. “Thank you for the information, though. I will make sure it is put to good use. Now, if you don’t mind, I’m going back to bed. I take it you can see yourself out.” And with that, Harry walked away from Lord Riddle, not caring if he left or not.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">--</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It was rather hard to tell, but the moment that Tom finished speaking, he braced himself. It wasn’t that he really feared any sort of reaction from the young mortal, it was that he would prefer not to have an entire pot of tea thrown in his face (because it was really more of a question of injury to his dignity than to his person). While Harry still seemed to be processing the entire conversation, Tom let the silence stretch between them. One minute, two…maybe five now, it was impossible to tell. While the vampire lord was far from being ‘uncomfortable’, he realized that this moment might be considered rather tense to his young companion, but it was imperative that Harry considered his options fully and completely.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">And quite frankly, Tom was dumbfounded. He had expected shrieking rage, screaming threats, unwavering intense anger, but what he found before him was a pensive young man, staring blankly into a cup of tea as his thoughts moved far more quickly than he could even consider voicing. From what he had seen of Harry before, this did not seem to align with the brash, reckless young human he had anticipated. The change was as surprising as it was refreshing. Perhaps he had judged his situation too early to even get a full grasp on what the boy was capable of. Maybe Harry would even acquiesce to the request after all.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">When the boy spoke again, his voice was even, calm and measured. He spoke with an assurance that Tom had not been expecting, yet still, the answer was exactly what the vampire had planned for. It was a polite and well-spoken refusal, worthy of a student under the tutelage of both Remus and Albus (among many others). </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">No rage, no thrown teacups, no destroyed kitchen, no temper tantrum. Tom even found himself quietly considering the boy’s words as he spoke, which was a delightful and pleasant surprise. Granted, he had planned for this outcome, so a refusal was going exactly according to his wishes but it did lengthen the process of obtaining his precious Chalice just the slightest bit longer. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I hope you’re right, Harry.” He murmured, his tone a delighted little sing-song that seemed to imply that he knew far more than he was letting on. He watched the boy retreat now, setting his cup on the table and finally allowing himself to go off to bed. It didn’t seem to matter in the slightest that there was currently a powerful vampire lord sitting at his table, sharing his future hopes for them. Harry had enough of this and he was about to make himself painfully clear about that fact. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Tom sat alone for just a moment before he set the kitchen right once again. With a casual wave of his hand, the cups and tea pot began to magically float over the sink and wash themselves clean.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">So, the boy was just more than irrational, reckless behavior backed up by more powerful mentor figures? Tom was learning far more from this short conversation than he had ever thought possible, and what he found, he was liking more and more. His future Chalice should be able to think on his toes, but also be logical and pragmatic about their conclusions. Harry had done well tonight. Despite his pervious slip up, letting a deadly enemy waltz into his home, he had managed the conversation and offer with about as much grace as a young mortal could. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">As he made his way out of the front door, Tom smiled as he breathed in the fresh air, anticipating the next step in this process. This was the waiting game. And while this could seem to drag on forever, he knew that the promise of victory at the end of this dark tunnel would be all the sweeter for his patience.</span>
