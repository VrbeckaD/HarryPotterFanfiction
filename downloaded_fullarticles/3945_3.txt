    <p> FADE IN:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>EXT. KNOCKTURN ALLEY — JUST BEFORE DAWN</p>
<p>We open on a dark street, rain dripping off the rooftops onto slimy cobblestones. Shop windows with bars over them, haphazard displays coated in cobwebs and grime. Outer walls pasted with WANTED posters peeling from the bricks, many defaced or torn away. The convicts’ photos glare out at us.</p>
<p>A DRUNKEN MAN in tattered robes stumbles through the street, holding a bottle full of bright green liquid, singing incomprehensibly, off-key. As he lurches about, he slips on something, and falls to the ground — he groans, sitting up, and snatches it: one of the posters, obscured. He tosses it into the darkness, using the bottle to push to his feet —</p>
<p>The shadows shift. The man drops his bottle, reaching into his robes, drawing something and brandishing it like a knife, shouting as he does so:   </p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>DRUNKEN MAN<br/>Who’s there?</p>
</blockquote><p>He realizes it’s a broken quill he’s holding, and begins to panic as the from the darkness emerges —</p>
<p>A DOG with mangy fur. It steps on the poster and yawns.  </p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>DRUNKEN MAN<br/>     (sneering, to himself)<br/>Just a stray. </p>
</blockquote><p>He replaces the quill with his wand and with a few waves the shattered bottle comes together again. There’s clearly grime from the street mixing with the green liquid, but he doesn’t seem to notice. He continues to stumble on his way.</p>
<p>We stay with the dog, which bends down and sniffs the torn paper. We can just see the convict in the image now, his face gaunt as he blinks up at the dog, but then the dog breaks into a run, stepping on it again. We watch him dart down the street, and pull up to reveal that he is headed towards DIAGON ALLEY, as the sun is breaking over LONDON beyond, and we hold there for a moment before we hear:</p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>MAN’S VOICE (OS)<br/>Mr Potter!</p>
</blockquote><p> </p>
<p>INT. LEAKY CAULDRON — MORNING</p>
<p>Back down, into the Leaky Cauldron, the pub and inn serving as the gateway between magical Diagon Alley and Muggle London. The ground floor is quiet: a few customers eating breakfast, a wizard reading as his coffee stirs itself.* We can see more wanted posters on the walls. In the background, TOM, the barman, is using magic to pull chairs off tables, scrubbing them clean with a flick of his wand. All normal. </p>
<p>And then: a boy, frozen halfway down the stairs. Scrawny, black hair sticking up in every direction, a faded hoodie and rolled-up jeans that would fit someone twice his size, round glasses taped together over his nose magnifying his bright green eyes. This is HARRY POTTER. A student at HOGWARTS on summer holiday. And, as we will soon learn: a runaway. He has his school book bag slung over one arm, and his other hand is tight around the wand sticking out of his pocket as he looks down the stairs. He sees:</p>
<p>A tired-looking wizard in black robes. He has dark skin, dark eyes, and dark hair shaved close to the scalp. A patch on his chest identifies him as an employee of the Ministry of Magic.</p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>MINISTRY EMPLOYEE<br/>Yes, Mr Potter, clearly. I’ve been looking for you for three days. </p>
  <p>HARRY<br/>...Sorry?<br/>     (a pause)<br/>Who are you?</p>
  <p>MINISTRY EMPLOYEE<br/>Lionel Willoughby, Muggle Affairs. Would you like to have this conversation on the stairs, or will you come down?  </p>
</blockquote><p>After a moment, Harry follows Lionel over to one of the booths. Harry has to stretch his feet so that his toes are pressed firmly into the ground. He’s ready to bolt. </p>
<p>Lionel waves to Tom. A teapot and two cracked mugs float across the room, landing on the table with a CRASH that makes Harry jump. </p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>LIONEL<br/>You know why I’m here.</p>
  <p>HARRY<br/>Do I?</p>
  <p>LIONEL<br/>     (sighing)<br/>Mr Potter, regardless of who your parents are, it does not excuse the fact that you blew up your aunt — your <em>muggle </em>aunt — and sent her loose out over the rooftops of Surrey.</p>
</blockquote><p> </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br/>EXT. LITTLE WHINGING, THREE DAYS EARLIER — DUSK </p>
<p>MARGE’s inflated form floats over the rows of rooftops like a wayward balloon, wailing. A man off screen — UNCLE VERNON — calls desperately after her.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>BACK AT THE LEAKY CAULDRON — DAY </p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>HARRY<br/>She’s not my aunt. She’s my uncle’s sister, not Aunt Petunia’s. And she deserved it.</p>
  <p>LIONEL<br/>She’s a muggle, and—</p>
  <p>HARRY<br/>She insulted my parents. </p>
</blockquote><p>Lionel gapes. Harry’s got him now. </p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>LIONEL<br/>Be that as it may—</p>
  <p>HARRY<br/>She called James Potter a drunk and a worthless layabout. And she referred to Lily Potter as—<br/>     (whispers)<br/>a bitch.</p>
</blockquote><p>Lionel clenches his jaw, and Harry holds back a satisfied smile. James and Lily Potter, heroes martyred before Harry can remember, are matters of national pride. Symbols of Wizarding Britain’s continued moral superiority. A ministry man like Lionel is patriotically obligated to be offended.</p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>HARRY<br/>     (continued)<br/>Of course she doesn’t know they were heroes, but there’s no excuse for insulting someone’s mother.</p>
  <p>LIONEL<br/>     (recovering)<br/>There’s no excuse for using a swelling charm on a muggle, either. Mr Potter.</p>
  <p>HARRY<br/>     (frustrated)<br/>Well, I didn’t mean to, did I? Only she’d been on about it since she showed up, and I lost my temper, and I thought I was just telling her to shut up, but then…</p>
  <p>LIONEL<br/>You mean to say that was accidental magic?</p>
  <p>HARRY<br/>I didn’t do it intentionally, if that’s what you mean. It’s not like I’m going around waving my wand all summer. That’s illegal. Besides, it was locked in my trunk with the rest of my things.</p>
  <p>LIONEL<br/>Your Uncle showed us the damage you did to the cupboard door.</p>
  <p>HARRY<br/>Well, the cupboard was—</p>
</blockquote><p>He stops abruptly, glancing around the room. No one is paying attention to them.</p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>HARRY (CONT’D)<br/>I needed my things, to be able to leave.</p>
</blockquote><p>Lionel sighs, pouring the tea. He pushes one of the mugs towards Harry, but Harry ignores it.</p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>LIONEL<br/>Well, this is your second warning, Mr Potter. If it was accidental… I suppose you’ll say the hover charm last year was accidental too?</p>
  <p>HARRY<br/>No. That wasn’t me. I got blamed for it, but it wasn’t.</p>
  <p>LIONEL<br/>The Trace can tell when there is another wizard present, Mr Potter.</p>
  <p>HARRY<br/>It wasn’t a wizard. It was a house-elf.</p>
  <p>LIONEL<br/>A house-elf? In a muggle home?</p>
  <p>HARRY<br/>His name is Dobby. He used to work for Mr Malfoy, but I helped him get free, last year. He hated the Malfoys. He was trying to warn me about the Chamber of Secrets.</p>
</blockquote><p>CUT TO:<br/>INT. HARRY’S ROOM, ONE YEAR EARLIER — NIGHT</p>
<p>Harry sits on the bed, while DOBBY, a wide-eyed house-elf in a dirty pillowcase, waves his arms frantically. </p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>DOBBY<br/>Harry Potter must not go back to Hogwarts!</p>
  <p>HARRY<br/>You’ve said that, but I have to! I can’t stay here.</p>
  <p>DOBBY<br/>Harry Potter must —</p>
  <p>HARRY<br/>     (desperately)<br/>But why?</p>
  <p>DOBBY<br/>Dobby cannot say! Only that there is something coming to Hogwarts, something terrible, and Harry Potter will be in danger!</p>
</blockquote><p>BACK AT THE LEAKY CAULDRON — DAY</p>
<p>Where Lionel has gone wide-eyed at the mention of the Chamber. Harry looks wary. </p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>HARRY<br/>Dumbledore knows about Dobby. And Dobby would probably tell you, if you could find him.</p>
  <p>LIONEL<br/>     (reluctantly moving on)<br/>And why didn’t you write back to the letter, then?</p>
  <p>HARRY<br/>I was locked in my room for the rest of the summer. Didn’t you see the bars on the window? Dumbledore had to send someone to get me, when school started. They didn’t want me to go back. They didn’t want me to go in the first place.</p>
  <p>LIONEL<br/>You ran away… to Hogwarts.</p>
</blockquote><p>Harry shrugs, and Lionel sighs again, rubbing his temples.</p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>LIONEL (CONT’D)<br/>Well, if that is the case, you should write to Mafalda Hopkirk, in the Improper Use of Magic office. You don’t want something like that on your record, Mr Potter.</p>
  <p>HARRY<br/>Is this going on my record?</p>
  <p>LIONEL<br/>May I have your wand?</p>
  <p>HARRY<br/>What do you want with it?</p>
  <p>LIONEL<br/>There’s a spell to check what was last cast by a wand. If you’re telling the truth, there’s not going to be a swelling charm there.</p>
</blockquote><p>Harry slowly pulls his wand out of his pocket and sets it on the table. He watches carefully while Lionel produces his own wand and casts the spell —</p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>LIONEL<br/><em>Priori Incantato.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>— and the wand emits several bursts of faint, glowing, golden lights, which criss-cross into webs in the air, wrapping into a shape — the form of Harry’s school trunk. Lionel raises an eyebrow.</p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>HARRY<br/>I had to protect my things from them. I cast them on the train. So they couldn’t open it and destroy anything, or take my money — gold is more valuable, to muggles. I need it or I won’t be able to buy my school things. </p>
</blockquote><p>Well, it’s not completely a lie. He’d used it first to protect his things from his classmates, back when they thought he was the Heir of Slytherin and his trunk was torn apart by Ginny looking for Tom Riddle’s Diary, and more recently —<br/><br/>A pause, and then we rewind backwards through the morning, following Harry away from the table, up the stairs, and into the little room he’s rented at the end of the hall, to the moment before he clicks his trunk shut —</p>
<p>And moving forwards again: </p>
<p>The lid clicks shut. Harry, crouching in front of his trunk, pulls out his wand without hesitation, and begins to murmur spells, though his words are lost under the sound of the room rattling as a train rushes by outside his window. It’s not completely gone before Harry stands, grabs his bag and hurrying out the door, on to the scene we return to now:<br/><br/>Where he is looking sharply at Lionel, as though daring him to call out the lie.</p>
<p>Lionel frowns, but flicks his wand, the golden light dissolving. He pushes the wand back across the table towards Harry, who shoves it back into his pocket.</p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>LIONEL<br/>I will have to question your aunt and uncle again, but if this was accidental, it will be removed from your record.</p>
  <p>HARRY<br/>...I’m not going to be expelled?</p>
  <p>LIONEL<br/>Expelled? Merlin, no. At worst you would be doing community service hours, but I don’t think that will be necessary.</p>
</blockquote><p>Harry breathes a sigh of relief, relaxing in his seat. </p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>LIONEL (CONT’D)<br/>However, there is the matter of the rest of your summer.</p>
  <p>HARRY<br/>I’m <em>not </em>going back to the Dursleys.</p>
  <p>LIONEL<br/>Normally, you wouldn’t have a choice. You are a minor, Mr Potter.<br/>     (quickly, before Harry can interrupt)<br/>However, we have determined that, for the time being, it would be… safer, for you to remain here. Yes, well, of course you will be able to go home next summer, or perhaps sooner if they contact us before then. Once things cool down a bit.</p>
  <p>HARRY<br/>They won’t. I’m not going back.</p>
</blockquote><p>Lionel seems to decide it isn’t worth the argument.</p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>LIONEL<br/>If you do stay here, the Ministry can send someone to escort you to King’s Cross on September first, to catch the Hogwarts express.</p>
  <p>HARRY<br/>Er… That’s alright. I can get there myself. I’m used to muggle transit, and… Most wizards aren’t exactly, um, subtle.</p>
  <p>LIONEL<br/>Are you certain?</p>
</blockquote><p> </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br/>INT. LONDON UNDERGROUND, TWO YEARS EARLIER</p>
<p>Harry, eleven, is squeezed in a seat next to HAGRID. Hagrid is about five times the size of anyone else on the train, and pretty much everyone is staring and whispering. Harry squirms under the attention, trying to hide behind Hagrid.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>BACK AT THE LEAKY CAULDRON</p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>HARRY<br/>I’m used to doing things on my own.</p>
</blockquote><p>Lionel looks unhappy about this, but there’s sudden commotion across the room as a large group comes in — a family or redheads. The Weasleys. We can just hear the youngest of the four boys, RON, speaking:</p>
<p> </p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>RON<br/>Mum, can’t I just wait until Seamus gets here? I told him I’d meet him.</p>
</blockquote><p>We don’t hear MRS WEASLEY’s reply, because when Harry spots the youngest Weasley and only girl, GINNY, his eyes go wide, and for a moment we see into his mind as memories from the previous year collide:</p>
<p> </p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>RON (OS)<br/>You killed her! He killed my sister! He’s the heir of Slytherin—</p>
  <p>TOM RIDDLE (OS)<br/>How curious that you, the child of the two who killed Lord Voldemort, can speak Parseltongue. But it doesn’t matter, because soon you, too, will be dead —</p>
</blockquote><p>Ginny Weasley’s body lies cold and still on the floor, but suddenly she gasps in air and her eyes open, and the first thing she sees is —</p>
<p> </p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>GINNY<br/>Harry?</p>
</blockquote><p> </p>
<p>BACK AT THE LEAKY CAULDRON</p>
<p>Harry quickly looks away. </p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>HARRY<br/>Can I go now?</p>
  <p>LIONEL<br/>Are you sure you’ll be fine on your own?</p>
  <p>HARRY<br/>I’m thirteen, Mr Willow, not five. Can I go?</p>
  <p>LIONEL<br/>Willoughby. It’s— yes. You can go.</p>
</blockquote><p>Harry quickly jumps to his feet, hurrying away.</p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>LIONEL (CONT’D)<br/>But send that letter to Madame Hopkirk!</p>
</blockquote><p>Harry is gone before he finishes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>EXT. DIAGON ALLEY </p>
<p>Even though it is still early, there are already crowds beginning to form, as the rush of Hogwarts students coming for supplies has just begun. We hear bits of conversation, adults complaining over the price of potions ingredients, children begging for the newest broom — the FIREBOLT, seen displayed in the window of one of the shops, Quality Quidditch Supplies, where a group is already gathering. Near the back, we see three children of varying ages, peering through the crowd, and catch their conversation:</p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>TEENAGE GIRL<br/>It’s the prototype of the new Firebolt.</p>
  <p>LITTLE GIRL<br/>Let me see! Let me see!</p>
  <p>BOY<br/>I’ve heard it’s the favorite for the World Cup!</p>
</blockquote><p>But Harry’s not listening — he squeezes past them and turns into the narrow alley next to the shop, leaning up against the wall next to a stack of crates. We can see his hands are shaking, and he pulls up his sleeve to reveal a circular scar on his arm—</p>
<p>The image of the basilisk lunges towards us—</p>
<p> Harry flinches back into the bricks, his hand covering the scar as he squeezes his eyes shut. Memories continue to intrude:</p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>DUMBLEDORE (OS)<br/>Your parents would be proud of you, Harry… And I’m sure the Weasleys will want to give their thanks...</p>
  <p>HARRY (OS)<br/>Don’t tell them it was me.</p>
  <p>DUMBLEDORE<br/>Don’t tell them?</p>
  <p>HARRY<br/>Please. I don’t want — I don’t want the rumors to start again. That I’m the Heir of Slytherin. I’m not.</p>
  <p>DUMBLEDORE<br/>I’m afraid, my boy, they already know.</p>
</blockquote><p>He opens his eyes again, pulling his sleeve down over the scar. He opens the book bag momentarily, and looks inside, where there is a bundle of fabric — he puts his hand in it, and it disappears. This is his father’s old invisibility cloak. Being able to disappear calms his shaking.</p>
<p>But out of the corner of his eye, he spots movement, and jumps, pulling the book bag to his chest before he sees—</p>
<p>The mangy Dog, wagging its tail. Harry looks relieved, but then he frowns. He’s seen this dog before, in:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>PRIVET DRIVE — EXTERIOR — NIGHT </p>
<p>The night that he left, specifically. He stomps down the street, projecting his anger for all to see, dragging his trunk behind him. A vibrant bruise mottles his cheek. A rustling in the bushes startles him, and he sticks out his wand at it, just spotting the dog, but the in doing so he accidentally calls the Knight Bus: he’s thrown back from the street as it slams to a halt before him, and we’re thrown:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>BACK TO DIAGON ALLEY</p>
<p>Maybe it’s just a similar-looking stray. Either way, he backs slowly away, closes his book bag again and turns towards the alley, steeling himself before disappearing out onto the street.</p>
<p>We quickly lose Harry in the crowd and pull up and backwards, Diagon Alley and the noise of the crowd winking out of existence as we pull back into muggle London, where an elevated train is approaching and cuts across the screen. The sound carries over to:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>INT. HOGWARTS EXPRESS COMPARTMENT, DAY </p>
<p>Harry sits alone. Students in the aisle peek in the window, hoping for a place to sit, but they spot him and move past. Harry is reading a copy of the Daily Prophet — we can just see the front, where the same image from the WANTED poster is pictured under the headline: SIRIUS BLACK STILL MISSING! MINISTRY INCOMPETENT? The door of the compartment opens, and Harry looks up to see: </p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>NEVILLE LONGBOTTOM<br/>There you are! I’ve been looking for you all over.</p>
</blockquote><p>Harry smiles. This is one person he’s happy to see.</p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>HARRY<br/>Well, I’ve been right here. Close the door, would you? Don’t need Malfoy or someone coming in here.</p>
  <p>NEVILLE<br/>He’s up at the other end of the train.</p>
  <p>HARRY<br/>     (alert)<br/>Did he do something to you?</p>
  <p>NEVILLE<br/>No, no. You know he hasn’t bothered me s—since…</p>
</blockquote><p>He stammers his way into awkward silence. </p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>HARRY<br/>Well, alright then. How was the rest of your summer? Did you get your new wand? </p>
</blockquote><p>Neville brightens up, pulling his wand out. He’s already in robes, unlike Harry. </p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>NEVILLE<br/>Cherry and unicorn hair. Gran wasn’t happy, since my old one was da’s, but Ollivander told her outright it couldn’t have worked for me. Too stubborn. That’s why it backfired on Lockhart. And…<br/>     (leaning in, a bit quieter)<br/>I tried a few spells, after what you wrote me about the Trace? And it’s… he was right, Ollivander. This wand, it’s… I actually felt like a wizard, you know? Like I could actually use magic. And Gran saw, but she couldn’t be that mad.</p>
  <p>HARRY<br/>Hermione Granger better watch out. You’ll be topping the class.</p>
  <p>NEVILLE<br/>Don’t poke fun.</p>
  <p>HARRY<br/>I’m not! You’ve always worked twice as hard as any of us. Even her. But I never thought there’d be any reason to thank Lockhart.</p>
</blockquote><p>Neville looks embarrassed but pleased as he laughs.</p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>NEVILLE<br/>Me either. Who do you think the new Professor will be? I haven’t heard.</p>
</blockquote><p>We leave them to their conversation, moving out to</p>
<p> </p>
<p>INT. HOGWARTS EXPRESS HALLWAY, DAY</p>
<p>Where students are cheerfully running up and down the hallways.</p>
<p>PERCY WEASLEY, with a badge on his chest reading HEAD BOY, tries to chase down his twin brothers FRED and GEORGE, but is caught up not able to get past the crowd.</p>
<p>LEE JORDAN, a friend of theirs, is buying candy from the TROLLEY WITCH, and tosses Fred a chocolate frog as he goes by, but it slips from his hand and jumps into the hair of HERMIONE GRANGER, who shrieks and drops her new cat, CROOKSHANKS, ugly and orange, who jumps about a foot into the air, hissing.</p>
<p>Ron Weasley, going by with SEAMUS FINNIGAN and DEAN THOMAS, looks at the cat in disgust, shielding his pet rat, SCABBERS, against his chest.</p>
<p>He begins to warn Hermione off, but we go past this and down to the end of the train, the chatter growing distant, and in the last compartment find a man is huddled against the window, a shabby robe covering his head, though he is clearly asleep. But we don’t linger on him for long, moving out the window to:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>EXT. HOGWARTS EXPRESS, DAY</p>
<p>As the train rolls through the countryside, the afternoon progresses, and we return to Harry and Neville’s conversation, later, and Neville is laughing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>INT. COMPARTMENT, DUSK </p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>NEVILLE<br/><em>Celestina Warbeck? </em>No way. Well, maybe she’d do us all a favor and teach the Fat Lady how to sing, but — that’s almost as bad as Lockhart!</p>
  <p>HARRY<br/>I don’t think anyone could be as bad as Lockhart. Quirrel wasn’t even that bad, if you, you know, ignore the whole Voldemort thing.</p>
  <p>NEVILLE<br/>Maybe it’ll be someone decent?</p>
  <p>HARRY<br/>Is that even possible? If the position really is cursed, they have to be running out of people to teach it… maybe we’ll be stuck with Snape.</p>
</blockquote><p>As he speaks, we see fog beginning to form on the windows. Harry notices it. Neville does not. </p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>NEVILLE<br/>Don’t say that! You know he hates me — look! You’re giving me goosebumps.</p>
  <p>HARRY<br/>…Neville, I don’t think that’s —  </p>
</blockquote><p>The train jolts to a halt, sending Neville toppling forward from his seat. A moment later, the lights in the compartment go out, too, and it is very quiet and still.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>EXT. HOGWARTS EXPRESS</p>
<p>We pull back to see the Hogwarts Express over a raised bridge, as the lights in the compartments go out in a chain. A DARK FIGURE swoops past the camera, cutting us back to</p>
<p> </p>
<p>INT. COMPARTMENT</p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>HARRY<br/>Why are we stopped?</p>
  <p>NEVILLE<br/>     (stuttering)<br/>H—H—H— Harry —</p>
  <p>HARRY<br/>What is it?</p>
  <p>NEVILLE<br/>Th—th—there’s someth—thing —</p>
</blockquote><p>He gives up speaking and points outside the window. Harry turns and looks just as another Dark Figure swoops past. </p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>NEVILLE<br/>Wh—wh—what —</p>
</blockquote><p>Harry doesn’t know either, but he pulls out his wand and waves it at the door with the incantation: <em>Collallis Duri </em>. We see the same golden spell that Lionel’s Priori Incantatem pulled from Harry’s wand earlier settle over the door — but before it can complete something comes sliding up the hall. It’s one of the Dark Figures, and its SKELETAL HAND reaches towards the door.<br/><br/>Neville is wide-eyed, pressing back, but then he glances at Harry, who has gone pale and still. </p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>NEVILLE<br/>     (whispering)<br/>Harry?</p>
</blockquote><p>The rest of the golden spell dissolves away. The lock clicks. The door slides open. Neville shakes Harry’s arm.</p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>NEVILLE<br/>Harry! </p>
</blockquote><p>The Dark Figure swoops into the doorway, looming over them. But we cut to a CLOSE UP of Harry’s face, eyes wide, and begin to hear a woman’s voice — </p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>VOICE (OS, DISTANT)<br/>Not Harry! Please, not Harry — </p>
</blockquote><p>Neville shakes him again —</p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>NEVILLE<br/>     (voice breaking)<br/>Harry!</p>
</blockquote><p>But Harry is completely unresponsive. Neville looks up at the Dark Figure, which is clearly looking towards Harry. He swallows, and then stands up, fists clenched,</p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>NEVILLE<br/>     (shaky)<br/>St—st—stay b—back!</p>
</blockquote><p>The Dark Figure looks at Neville, and we begin to hear whispers — his grandmother and his great uncle telling him he’s no good at magic, the doctors in St Mungo’s discussing his parents, among others — but Neville stands firm. He remembers to get his wand out.</p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>NEVILLE<br/>I’m w—w—warning you!</p>
</blockquote><p>The Dark Figure leers forward, growing even taller —</p>
<p>But suddenly a WHITE LIGHT bursts forward. The Dark Figure lets out an inhuman sound and pulls away, and Neville covers his eyes at the brightness. When he opens them again, the figure is gone, and Neville stares in amazement, wondering what he’s done. He turns back to ask Harry, but as he does —</p>
<p>Harry faints to the floor. We FADE TO BLACK.</p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>NEVILLE<br/>Harry!</p>
</blockquote><p>In the darkness, we hear Harry’s dream. The woman’s voice from before is still at a distance. But as her pleading grows louder, it is layered with a Man’s Voice, calling his name as well, and it all grows more intense until:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A GREEN FLASH  </p>
<p>  </p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>VOICE (OS, MAN)<br/>Harry?</p>
</blockquote><p> </p>
<p>Harry’s eyes open wide and he sits up from the floor, panting heavily. The compartment is lit again, and the train is moving, though it is dark outside, and there’s rain hitting the windows. The man from the last compartment is squatting on the floor next to him, and Neville is kneeling. Harry notices the man first, and scrambles back, looking around frantically.</p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>MAN (CONT’D)<br/>Easy.</p>
  <p>HARRY<br/>What — What was that thing?</p>
</blockquote><p>He jumps again as there is a loud snap. The man is holding two pieces of a chocolate bar, which he holds out to each of the boys. Harry takes it automatically. </p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>MAN<br/><em>That </em>was a dementor.</p>
</blockquote><p>Neville lets out a gasp, earning a glance from the others. He blushes and accepts the chocolate.</p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>MAN (CONT’D)<br/>They were supposed to be searching for Sirius Black.</p>
  <p>NEVILLE<br/>     (shaken)<br/>On— th—the H—Hogwarts Exp—ress?</p>
</blockquote><p>The man doesn’t answer, standing up. </p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>MAN*<br/>I’m going to talk to the conductor. Eat that chocolate. It will help.</p>
</blockquote><p>The man leaves. The door slides shut behind him.</p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>HARRY<br/>What’s a dementor?</p>
  <p>NEVILLE<br/>Th—th—ey g—guard Az—kaban. Th—e —prison.</p>
</blockquote><p>Harry looks at Neville in concern, and purposefully takes a bite of the chocolate. Neville follows suit. They both look down at it in surprise, calming down. </p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>HARRY<br/>Was someone screaming?</p>
  <p>NEVILLE<br/>S—creaming?</p>
  <p>HARRY<br/>A woman. I heard a woman, she was…</p>
</blockquote><p>He trails away. Neville looks concerned.  </p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>HARRY (CONT’D)<br/>Who was that man?</p>
  <p>NEVILLE<br/>Th—the new D—defense prof—essor. He scared th—the d— dementor away. He doesn’t s—eem that bad…</p>
  <p>HARRY<br/>     (trying to joke)<br/>Just wait. Maybe he’ll turn out to be a...</p>
</blockquote><p>But nothing seems funny, after the dementor. They both get up off the floor, returning to their seats. Percy Weasley goes by, peering in through the window, and moves on.</p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>NEVILLE<br/>     (softly, carefully)<br/>W—hy would they l—ook for Sirius Black on the train? You — you don’t think he’s coming to Hogwarts, do you?</p>
</blockquote><p> </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br/>INT. GREAT HALL, NIGHT </p>
<p>The tables are filled with students waiting for dinner. ALBUS DUMBLEDORE, the headmaster, stands behind the staff table, addressing them: </p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>DUMBLEDORE*<br/>The Minister has assured me that the Dementors are just here as a precaution, and will remain stationed at the entrances of the school. However, I must be clear that there are to be no unsupervised trips off the grounds. They are not fooled by disguises or invisibility cloaks—</p>
</blockquote><p>Harry and Neville, at Gryffindor table, glance at each other, then quickly away again.</p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>DUMBLEDORE (CONT’D)*<br/>And it is not in the nature of a Dementor to be forgiving.</p>
</blockquote><p>Beside Harry, we find Fred and George, whispering.</p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>GEORGE<br/>Do you suppose they know —</p>
  <p>FRED<br/>Nah, they can’t —</p>
</blockquote><p>They catch Harry listening and cut off, but smile. Harry quickly looks away.</p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>DUMBLEDORE*<br/>On a happier note, I would like to welcome our newest members of the staff! First, please join me in welcoming Professor Remus Lupin, who will be covering Defense Against the Dark Arts.</p>
</blockquote><p>The students let out mixed applause as the man stands. Harry elbows Neville. </p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>HARRY<br/>Look at Snape!</p>
</blockquote><p>Snape is seated next to Lupin, and clearly displeased by the arrangement.</p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>DUMBLEDORE*<br/>I am also sorry to announce that Professor Kettleburn, our Care of Magical Creatures teacher, retired at the end of last year in order to enjoy more time with his remaining limbs. However, I am delighted to say that his place will be filled by none other than our very own Rubeus Hagrid.</p>
</blockquote><p>Hagrid stands, disturbing the table with a loud scraping sound. This time, there is strong applause from the Gryffindors, and no applause at all from Slytherin.* Harry looks up at the man in surprise, and claps readily.</p>
<p>The commotion dies, and Hagrid sits back down with another loud scrape.</p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>DUMBLEDORE<br/>And now, what I’m sure you have all been waiting for: the feast! </p>
</blockquote><p>The tables fill with platters loaded with food, and the students dig in as Dumbledore sits.</p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>NEVILLE<br/>Well, I’m glad we didn’t sign up for Care of Magical Creatures.</p>
  <p>HARRY<br/>     (offended)<br/>What’s wrong with Hagrid?</p>
  <p>NEVILLE<br/>He scares me. And — remember Fluffy?</p>
</blockquote><p> </p>
<p>INT. HOGWARTS, FIRST YEAR</p>
<p>A THREE-HEADED DOG, growling over a terrified Harry and Neville. As they open their mouths to scream, we jump:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>BACK TO THE GREAT HALL </p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>HARRY<br/>Never mind. You’re right.</p>
</blockquote><p>They are interrupted by the girl sitting across from them: </p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>HERMIONE<br/>Who’s Fluffy?</p>
</blockquote><p>Neville and Harry share a glance. Hermione is always curious, and they never know how much to tell her. </p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>HARRY<br/>Are you in Hagrid’s class?</p>
  <p>HERMIONE<br/>Yes, of course.</p>
  <p>HARRY<br/>Good luck.</p>
</blockquote><p>As Hermione opens her mouth to push, THUNDER CRASHES in the ceiling. Many of the students jump, only burst into laughter as they realize it is just the enchantment that displays the outside sky, but we pull up through the ceiling to:</p>
<p>EXT. HOGWARTS </p>
<p dir="ltr">Lightning briefly illuminating the castle, but we turn, panning down past the WHOMPING WILLOW and over the BLACK LAKE, rippling with the rain. We pass quickly through the trees of the FORBIDDEN FOREST, to a crumbling STONE WALL, and past more of the DEMENTORS floating through the air. Where they float, the rain turns to ice, and the water on the stones freezes.</p>
<p>But we don’t linger. We move along quickly, to a</p>
<p>EXT. MUGGLE STREET</p>
<p>A woman walks alone in the dark. She’s moving quickly, glancing around, passing parked cars and skirting streetlights. As she reaches the door of a row house and fumbles in her bag for her keys, she spots movement in the alley, lined with overflowing bins. </p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>WOMAN<br/>     (whispering)<br/>Is someone there?</p>
</blockquote><p>As the shadows shift more, she pulls a can of pepper spray from her purse.</p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>WOMAN<br/>I’m armed!</p>
</blockquote><p>She jumps as a car turns onto the street, and the lights flash across the dark alley, illuminating briefly the gaunt face of SIRIUS BLACK.</p>
<p>The woman screams.</p>
<p>Lights flicker on in the nearby houses. A head sticks out from the window across the street. Doorways open.</p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>WOMAN<br/>It was him! That — that man from the telly! Sirius Black!</p>
</blockquote><p>The muggles look stunned. </p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>VOICE (OS)<br/><em>Here? </em>Are you — are you certain?</p>
  <p>WOMAN<br/>Yes I’m certain!</p>
  <p>MAN IN THE WINDOW<br/>Get inside and call the police! They say he has a gun!</p>
</blockquote><p>All the muggles retreat, closing doors and windows, and the lights turn off, though we can spot faces peering out from between curtains. The woman hurries to unlock her door and move inside. A moment later, we hear her voice: </p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>WOMAN<br/>     (muffled)<br/>Hello? Yes, I — I saw him… Sirius Black...</p>
</blockquote><p>But we move away, into the alley, and through a hole in the chain-link fence at the other end, and catch up to…</p>
<p>The Dog, who drops a cleaned chicken bone. He moves forward, but cowers into the shadows as a moment later a cop car rushes past, lights flashing, and when it is gone jumps out, racing across the street, into the alley on the other side.</p>
<p>Thunder crashes again.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>FADE TO BLACK.</p>
