    <p>Hermione Granger cared very much for the opinion of others, even if she didn´t show it, even if she wore her hair in a twist so tight her face looked pinched, because Hermione Granger may have been smart, and the most logical girl in her town but, she was above all, a lady. And even though her clothes were often worn and dirty and she read more than any girl this town - or even maybe this world - she was poor. And there wasn´t much more you needed to know about anyone in this day and age other than how much money they inherited.</p><p>Born to people who loved each other and made a living doing hard work, but work that didn´t pay much, born in a town in which nothing ever changes. People don´t live comfortably unless they were born into it, and even then they rarely ever go up. In her mothers case, she was born to a middle class family, rather well off and fell in love with a boy stationed below her. Cut off by her family because they would rather be heirless than let her disgrace their good name.</p><p>Hermione couldn´t ever imagine giving up a life of luxury in the name of love, and maybe becuase she was young, and she´d never been in love but she couldn´t very well see what was so great about it. Not when, when you got married you were signing your life away, to become property of a man. Hermione couldn´t think of anything worse, she would never be anybodies property, if she were to ever get married she would be her husbands equal. If he didn´t see her that way then she very well wouldn´t get married.</p><p>And it wasn´t like she was very attractive anyways, what qualities most men found handsome had been lost on her. Instead of being womanly she was tall and narrow, partially due to her unhealthy diet, and partially due to bad genetics. Not one man found a tall woman attractive, and even then she had horridly bushy hair, so even if she longed to get married - which she most certainly did not, thank you very much - itś not like she´d have very many options.</p><p>--</p><p>Cholera was a disease Hermione was not immune to, and neither were her parents. A family had infected her street and then it spread like wildfire, the sick becoming sicker and Hermione was helpless to watch.<br/>
--<br/>
Minerva McGonagall was an imposing woman, she stood tall and regal her hair tight but her face not pinched at all, her eyes were cold, just like her voice. Unforgiving, and the picture of grace, and elegance. To the best of Hermioneś knowledge she was not widowed, just unmarried. A great heiress in her own right, one who needent be dependant on a man and oh how jealous Hermione was.</p><p>Ms. McGonagall was here on a trip visiting her sisterś family, or so Hermione had heard from the greasy woman who gossiped, she wasn´t meant to stay long.</p><p>Hermione had yet to see her in person, and being only twelve, dirty, and soon to be orphaned - not that she´d ever admit it - she doubted anyone so pristine and classy would ever indulge her corner of the town. No matter how hard twelve year olds wished. She wasn´t royalty but she very well could have been.</p><p>--<br/>
Minerva McGonagall did not wish to stay at West Point long, she didn´t find it particularly lacking for all intents and purposes, but it was dirty and there were more poor people than she had been accustomed to. Her sister was sweet but she had no mind of her own, spoke only when allowed, and her children were very mannered but very spoiled. Spoiled so rotten Minerva could hardly bare their presence.</p><p>She was due to head back home to London rather soon, but having been in West Point for such a short amount of time she took to wandering the streets. Going for brisks walks during the day, regretting it when she´d come across another poverty stricken neighborhood, clouded with disease.</p><p>How disgusting it was, and she wanted no part of it, nor did her expensive gowns had any place in it. Today she´d wandered across a particularly disgusting neighborhood, Iĺl have to burn my dress, she thought morbidly. How horrid this place was, with the smell of rotting flesh thick in the air, clinging to any vecsel of life it could find.</p><p>And it would have been scandalous for her to wander the streets alone should she not have been a spinster. Nor was she afraid of what the people said of her, Minerva knew who she was and knew what was important. Nevermind the townspeople often called her a witch, it was her money that kept the town running and they did well to remember that.</p><p>She´s planning on turning around and heading back to her sisters home to prepare for dinner and then her long journey back home to London when she hears a desperate wailing that you´d have to be deaf to have ignored. Curiosity was a horribly ugly trait on a woman, but she didn´t very well care and decided to go picking about. Hoping not to find a burglary, how bloody those could get. But it´d hardly matter if she had to burn her dress anyways.</p><p>The wailing doesn´t stop, it pierces the air, and hangs heavy. Almost as if it belongs in such a dreary disgusting place, it belongs to a child, Minerva can tell. She was a firm believer that a child should be seen and not heard. She always imagined even the poor taught their children manners. She must have been wrong.</p><p>She stops at an alleyway, in wish she sees a small child, thin, no doubt from her lack of food, hovering over two bodies. Dead bodies. They must have been her parents, how unfortunate, McGonagall thought. To find someone dead, even worse when you love them.</p><p>¨Are those your parents?¨ Minerva feels herself let the question slip from her lips without thinking, the small child jumps back, out of fear her lips trembling. Her face covered in dirt and sweat, her hair falling out of the hastily made bun. Her clothes torn, her face pale, if only she hadn´t been born into such a low position in society. She holds an air of dignity and intelligence that could almost be aristocratic.</p><p>More´s the pity that she was so lowly ranked in society.</p><p>¨Yes they are, and you are Minerva McGonagall.¨ She states plainly, her eyes brown and clouded with grief. She is forgetting her manners but it should hardly matter to Hermione Granger, because her parents are dead and she is meeting Ms. McGonagall in an alley. Wishing out of everything it would have at least been on the street in the daylight on a day she could have made herself look presentable. Because how it hurt her pride to be face to face with someone so clean knowing you hadn´t had access to good bath water in weeks.</p><p>¨I see my reputation precedes me." She states blandly not at all caring for the girls manner. What unfortunate circumstances, but it didn´t give her a right to be so rude, and to her superior no doubt.</p><p> </p><p>¨Excuse me, but I am not in a particularly jovial mood." She interjects her voice crude, and her eyes fierce. Why Hermione was being so cross with someone she once longed to see, she had no idea. Perhaps it had been because she had been walking with her parents when they couldn´t continue. And how horrible it got all at once, and it´s not as if it came completely out of nowhere, but Hermione refused to believe it could be her parents. Even after Pansy Parkinson´s mother had died.</p><p>Refused to believe because even if it was true, and even if she didn´t have a particular attachment to her parents and her lifestyle, she was only twelve. Not even a woman and now she would be on her own, completely. What would they do with her, she´d become a ward of the state no doubt, forced in an orphanage. She couldn´t quite picture herself in an orphanage.</p><p>¨Do you speak to everyone this way girl, it´s a wonder you haven´t been properly educated." Minerva glowers, and she´s not even mad at her anymore. Because it´s very clear this little girl is horrid and rude and Minerva has not time for rude little girls with no manners, but something about her intrigues Minerva. And she is looking for an heir and it´s very clear she won´t be having any children of her own and why not? Why should she choose a perfect neat little girl with a bow in her hair when she could choose <em>this</em>. </p><p>And yes, she would need a lot of work, and who´s to say she´d even wish to go with her. And how odd it would be too, when they´d ask where Minerva had located her. What would she say? <em>Oh it´s quite a fun story, I was wandering about a disease stricken neighborhood when I found this tiny child mourning her late parents, and I knew then and there this would be the one. </em></p><p>¨There´s not exactly any schools around here, now is there?¨ Hermione shot back irritated, and worried, what would she do? What could she do? Nothing, she was properly helpless and at the mercy of a woman she was dreadfully rude to. And how mortified Hermione would have been if she wasn´t so hot headed and out raged, if she knew how to control her temper. But as level headed and logical as she had always been her temper was not something she had learned to easily control. </p><p>¨Right, well, I don´t suppose you have any other family.¨</p><p>¨No, ma´am.¨ Hermione whispered, her voice no longer holding the same fire, her gaze down cast as if to repent. She shouldn´t have been so rude, this was a tragedy, yes. But she was a lady, and ladies never behaved so horridly. </p><p>¨Good, I see you do know some manners. Very well then, as I see it you have very little options. I am in search of an heir.¨ McGonagall starts and Hermione´s eyes go wide, she couldn´t mean to take her as her heir. How bizarre, how completely inappropriate. She was newly orphaned and not at all civil, she was a nasty little girl and how could Minerva think to take her into her care. Either way, Hermione should hardly like to object. She refused to get hopes up, in case this was all some nasty prank. </p><p><br/>
<br/>
¨And you mean to make me your heir?¨ She questions curiously.</p><p>¨You´d need a lot of work, and we´d have to train you privately before we sent you to an actual boarding school. I won´t have you disgracing my name, and should you fail to completely master the art of dignity, grace, and beauty you can kiss any good life behind. I will not introduce you into society as you are now.¨ She says sternly but her voice filled with possibility, as she talks about a future that hasn´t happened yet. And how exciting Hermione thinks, if only her parents hadn´t just croaked. What a horrible damper on her mood. </p><p><br/>
She knew it was horrible to make fun so, and that little girls that were naughty would go to hell but she could hardly care. They were her parents, and yes they gave her life but they gave her a horrible life. A poverty stricken life and here was a way out, Hermione could mourn her parents later, when she had a new dress everyday. Now she needed to get out, or she doubted she ever could. </p>
