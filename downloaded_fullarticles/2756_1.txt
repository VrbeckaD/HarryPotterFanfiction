          <div class="userstuff"><p>Remus lay on the grass. The sparkle in his eyes just a reflection of the stars above. His face was blank.<br/> <br/> He looked down at that blank face astonished. Though he’d heard stories of such things happening before, Remus never believed in them.<br/> <br/> “I suppose that doesn’t matter now.”<br/> <br/> Just then a voice behind him said, “Come on, Remus, don’t turn narcissistic on me now.”<br/> <br/> Remus smiled and turned, “And why shouldn’t I?”<br/> <br/> “Well, if you’re too busy fawning over yourself, who’s gonna fawn over me?”<br/> <br/> “You.”<br/> <br/> “Touché,” Sirius smiled and for the first time in a very long time, Remus felt at peace. “Let’s go, Moony.”<br/> <br/> He nodded and began to follow Sirius, but a scream from behind made him stop. And he turned to see Tonks running toward his body.<br/> <br/> “I can’t, I have to – “</p>
<p>He tried to run. Sirius held his wrist, “No, Remus.”</p>
<p>When Remus turned to look at him, furious, ready to scream of his responsibility and loyalty, he was silenced. Sirius looked completely torn.<br/> <br/> “She’ll be with us soon.”</p></div>
