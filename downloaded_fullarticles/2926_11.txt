    <p>“Make this annoyance stop, <em>now</em>!”, Draco yelled, waving his right hand at a pygmy owl that had landed on the table in front of him. His demanding shouts were addressed at Blaise Zabini, loyal friend since childhood, fellow post-war- expatriate, co-owner of their mansion, and therefore, in Draco’s opinion, obliged to take care of his mental well-being.</p>
<p>Draco’s outbursts had become such a routine part of their breakfast that Blaise neither cared nor dared to respond anymore. Ever since they had left Hogwarts and the greatest part of their family’s histories behind, the two had grown closer. Their sharing a manor was a concession to their need for company and sympathy in times where it was not easy to be an ex-Slytherin.</p>
<p>“Blaise Zabini, how <em>dare</em> you ignore the fact that I am continuously being harassed by these unspeakable intrusions!”</p>
<p>“Just take the letter and it will go away.”, Blaise commented dryly.</p>
<p>“No! I won’t let that drivel ruin my morning again.”</p>
<p>Blaise bit his tongue. Draco had for sure ruined <em>his</em> morning, again, but he knew that it was pointless to fuel his rage. Taking note that he was being ignored, Draco leaned back, arms and legs crossed, staring at the small owl with disdain. Under Blaise’s judgmental gaze, he pointed his wand at the bird that was stretching its neck to present its delivery to Draco.</p>
<p>“Draco… please tell me you are just going to send it back.”</p>
<p>“You, my dear friend, should know so much better.”</p>
<p>And a second later, the black owl was replaced with a candlestick of the same color, it’s delivery standing upright in place of a candle. Draco picked it up gingerly.</p>
<p>“Mind you, Blaise, could you at least hand me one of those candles?”</p>
<p>Blaise sighed in resignation and fetched one of the candles from the candelabra in the middle of the table. The letter burned to ashes within a second.</p>
<p>“At least this one did not shout a love poem through the entire house…”, he muttered. “or worse.”</p>
<p>Blaise turned back to his toast while Draco just played with the small morsels of ash that had fallen onto his plate. His friend knew all too well what that meant. There was only one thing that turned Draco’s mood so sour that he neglected his strict dietary regimen.</p>
<p>“That one did not make it long, huh?”</p>
<p>“Argh. It became so <em>boring</em>. It was so… stereotyped. I don’t know what I was thinking.”</p>
<p>“Permission to quote?” Draco snorted in response. “As far as I remember, she was ‘one of the most stimulating intellectual minds encountered in years’ with ‘a bloody gorgeous body that made up for her lack of experience a hundred times’.”</p>
<p>Draco did not look at Blaise as he got up and left the room without further comment. He did not need a reminder that the last woman, attempt number thirty-three, had started out very promising. And Draco had enjoyed the time together for about two weeks. And then the same thing happened that always happened around week two. The other got needy. And Draco could not handle that.</p>
<p>The problem was, he could also not handle being single. Or, at least, with someone to warm his bed and fuck him to sleep. He even had to admit, though with grinding teeth, that he easily fell for someone once she or he sparked his interest. The last woman had been enchantingly witty, a gorgeous sight, maybe a little bit too young but oh, that naïveté had made it so much sweeter to seduce her.</p>
<p>It did not even matter to him whether it was a man or a woman. Draco loved all things beautiful. Love being the problematic word. When he met someone that he wanted, he fell in a state that Blaise classified as ‘fallen in love’. Draco called it different things. He obsessed about that person. He wanted them. He craved their body. For about two weeks. And then it was over, the feelings vanished, and all that Draco could still see besides an attractive façade were flaws and blemish. And the worst flaw of all that they all seemed to develop was that they insisted on ‘moving to another level’, on staying for breakfast, on talking about the past, the present, the future.</p>
<p>A future <em>together</em>. It made Draco shudder. No matter how infatuated he became with another person, he never had an intention to continue the Malfoy family line. That nightmare needed to be over. For the first time in his life, he felt free to do what he wanted to do, uncompromised by the demands of a bloodline, because there was nothing left to be proud of as a Malfoy. The family name was tainted with the stain of the Dark Mark in a time where the Dark Lord had been defeated. Time to move on and to forget.</p>
<p>And he did forget when he was engaged with his newest capture. For the first year, he had told himself that it was all a game. A game that demonstrated that he could have whomever he wanted for how long he wanted. That he was in control of the situation. Until Blaise had pointed out for the thirtieth time that he was not. And Draco, then standing amidst the shards of the porcelain that he had just smashed to smithers in a rage, had to admit that the break-ups and make-up attempts of his discarded lovers hit him harder each time the cycle repeated.</p>
<p align="center">~*~</p>
<p>The sound of rain drumming against the windows woke Harry up. He instinctively grabbed the body next to him, a comforter against the nasty weather outside. He buried his nose where the neck and shoulders of the other met, resting his right arm around his waist. The familiar scent of sweat and sex flooded Harry’s nose and promised to take him back to sleep along with the lulling warmth of two bodies underneath one blanket.</p>
<p>Much to his annoyance, the other person did not seem to share his plans to merely serve as a self-heating pillow. Instead, he started to move and wiggle the lower part of his body closer to Harry’s. His arm slowly freed itself from Harry’s firm hug, stroking first his lower arm, then his biceps, then reaching across to touch his glutes. Harry grabbed his hand in half-hearted disapproval, moving it back in front of the other man’s chest. But that was only taken as an opportunity to guide Harry’s hand from there to deeper regions. With timid force, Harry’s hand was guided across an incipient erection, across the testicles beneath it, up again, suggesting a gentle rhythm that let the other’s arousal grow tangibly.</p>
<p>Harry’s initial grumbling turned into a deep purr. If the other did not let him sleep, perhaps the alternative was not so bad after all. He freed his hand from the initial guidance, slowing his movements, letting his fingers play with alternations of pressure, exploring the shape of the other’s penis as he did so, smiling at the noises that he was starting to produce. He inched his own hips forward, moving his groin against the other’s back in the same rhythm that his hand had taken on.</p>
<p>But the other had not yet let go of the situation’s control. With a mixture of sigh and growl, he grabbed Harry’s wrist, pulled himself up on his left elbow, and turned himself around with Harry who now found himself pinned to the bed by one hand and sooner than he could protest by his hips, held firmly in place by one of the other’s legs. He bent up, pretending to struggle once, twice, just to feel the strength of the other holding him down. Helpless in the sweetest way.</p>
<p>It was only then that Harry’s eyes blinked open and caught a glimpse of blonde hair and a smooth chest. Another glimpse passed and he was turned onto his stomach, his just-emerging erection caught between his own body and the sheets. He moaned at the pressure the position created, arching his back a little more as he felt the other holding both of his wrists in a firm grip pinned to his lower back. The friction his movements created let the heat between his legs rise even more.</p>
<p>Then he felt lips on his neck, teeth exploring the possibility of a bite, a tongue offering excuses to the insulted skin. But all of that nibbling and teasing that sent shivers down his spine and up again to the tip of his hairs was just a distraction from what was about to happen to his ass. Harry acknowledged the thoughtfulness with a little moan, signaling to the other that everything was alright, that he could go on. Now.</p>
<p>And soon enough he could feel a finger running across his anus playfully, wet, a little bit too cold. He inched his hips up as much as he could with his arms still held firmly behind his back. The first finger entered him effortlessly, courtesy to the night before, and Harry indulged in that feeling of almost uncompromised pleasure. As the other kept his fingers moving, his mouth kissing, Harry’s mind went blank. He felt his body move, heard his voice moaning but had given up control of either. This was heavenly, sweet oblivion.</p>
<p>He could feel the other’s cock pressing against his thighs. He could hear his subdued groans. He felt the grip around his wrists tightening rhythmically as the other hand was still massaging his butthole. Harry soaked in the other’s desire.</p>
<p>“Do you want me?”, he asked, gasping for air.</p>
<p>“Oh, sweetheart, you know just about how much I want you now.”, the other replied, pressing more firmly against Harry’s ass, not quite forcing himself into him yet.</p>
<p>“Tell me.”, Harry demanded in a halting voice.</p>
<p>“I want you. I fucking want you.”</p>
<p>And with that, he gave Harry that addictive feeling of fullness, of pain-inspired pleasure as he started to fuck him, gently at first, letting go eventually, more with every thrust, spiked by their moans and lust and a hotness that came from deep within.</p>
<p>Minutes later, Harry rolled onto his back, his head buzzing with dizziness, his balls twitching with the aftermath of an orgasm. Deep satisfaction floated through his body. He listened to his breath calming down to normal speed, stretching his arms, almost hitting the person next to him. It only then struck him that he had no clue who that person was.</p>
<p>With a mix of curiosity and shame, he turned on his side to face the other man. He was around Harry’s age, blonde, with the statue of somebody who had grown tall early on in life, retaining thin long limbs and little muscle. He was blonde, the hair on his chest only visible because of the tan that covered almost the entire body but an almost comic shorts silhouette. The face was slightly familiar to Harry, plain and pleasant, beardless and well-cared for, but he could not recall a name.</p>
<p>“Are you alright? You’re staring at me as if I had just transfigured into your mother.”, the other asked, smiling, while he was removing the condom from his penis. “You were pretty out there when I fucked you.”</p>
<p>Harry blushed. “Yeah. Thanks for that. It was really good.”</p>
<p>“Ah-ah. Thank <em>you</em>.”</p>
<p>The other was trying to give him a kiss. Harry managed to cut it short by getting up on his elbows. He could not possibly ask for a name now, could he? The last one had not taken that question well. Harry took a look around the room and even though he could not see more than blurry outlines, it was clear that he was in his bedroom. He sighed. No easy way out.</p>
<p>“You want me to leave, don’t you?”, the other asked, a bitter undertone well hidden by perhaps genuine empathy.</p>
<p>Harry searched for his glasses to stall for time. When he had put them on his nose, he forced himself to look at the other man’s face again. With a sharp breath in, Harry confessed to himself that it was the same game all over again. A blonde man in his bed, blue eyes, sharp chin, narrow face. They were all alike, all strangers, all nameless.</p>
<p>“If you don’t mind…”, he managed to squeeze out. “It’s not that I did not enjoy…”</p>
<p>“Oh, I’m pretty sure you did.” The other’s smile wavered between sour and amused. “And it’s ok. We all need that sometimes. To just feel that someone wants us. Even if it’s not the one we really want.”</p>
<p>Harry swallowed hard. “How…”</p>
<p>“You were very specific about what you want to hear in bed.”, the other said while he was already starting to get dressed.</p>
<p>Harry’s cheeks turned from pink to scarlet. “Am… I’m sorry if I made you-“</p>
<p>“Stop being sorry. I had fun. You are fun. Owl me if you’d like to repeat this.”</p>
<p>Harry kept his eyes fixed on the sheets. His right hand playing with the blanket that he had drawn over himself.</p>
<p>“It’s Alex.”, the other added. He reached out to touch Harry’s cheek, hesitating as Harry leaned back an inch. “It was good to meet you, Clay.”</p>
<p>Harry sighed deeply when the front door clicked shut behind Alex. While his body felt great, his inner self felt like garbage. Fake names, forgotten names, strangers in his bed. He was sure that he would find a transfiguration spell cast at least on his forehead, if not his entire face that had hidden his identity.</p>
<p>Is it possible to feel used by oneself, he asked quietly, knowing the answer was yes because that was exactly what he was feeling. Ever since his life had started to resemble a normal wizarding life, he had tried to fill a growing emptiness. With Voldemort defeated and the world at relative ease, there was no need for the hero Harry Potter anymore. The only thing left from the identity that defined him was an annoying media interest in his persona, seeking for scandals and entertainment. But the fact was: nobody needed Harry Potter. The-boy-who-lived had fulfilled his duty and there was nothing meaningful left to do for the man Harry Potter.</p>
<p>He wanted someone to want <em>him</em>, as a person. And the easiest way to feel wanted, the most tangible, exciting, all-consuming way to feel wanted was to spark desire in another. Harry had become an expert in this game. He knew how to lure a man into his bed, as Harry Potter or otherwise. He knew how to dangle the promise of an exciting night in front of their noses. He knew how to fill the emptiness inside him, each night, temporarily. He did not know how to fill it for good.</p>
