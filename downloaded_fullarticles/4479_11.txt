<p><strong>Draco:</strong> Why should I?</p>
<p><strong>Harry:</strong> …You’re distracting me. Now leave.</p>
<p><strong>Draco:</strong> Oh? Are you flustered?</p>
<p><strong>Harry:</strong> No! I’m not. Not at all. Just trying to focus.</p>
<p><strong>Draco:</strong> I’m entitled to be in here, Harry, same as you. It <em>is</em> the library after all.</p>
<p><strong>Harry:</strong> …</p>
<p><strong>Draco:</strong> Is it warm in here? You appear flushed. Perhaps you might like to go somewhere to…cool off? Might even help your concentration.</p>
<p><strong>Harry, trying not to smile:</strong> And I take it you’d be honor-bound to accompany me?</p>
<p><strong>Draco:</strong> Why, of course! I’m sure I could think of <em>something</em> to help cool you down.</p>
<p><strong>Harry:</strong> Draco Malfoy, I’m pretty sure what you have in mind would only heat things up..</p>
<p><strong>Draco:</strong> It’ll be an important scientific experiment then: I hypothesize that it will help you cool down. Would you like the chance to prove me wrong?</p>
<p><strong>Harry, grinning openly now:</strong> <em>So</em> very much.</p></div>
