    <p>Harry scrubbed his fingers down his jaw, soft, brown hands catching on the coarse stubble. His hands had become more pliant in the years he'd had off the field, God, years. The words felt tangy in his mouth as he surveyed how much he'd changed while hunched behind the hulking desk of a secretary. </p><p> When he'd initially taken up office as Head Auror, he knew it wouldn't be the interchangeable position that he'd been promised - just like working in the field, but with more power over your inferiors - but he didn't think the difference would be as drastic as it was. At least that's what he kept telling himself. His stomach had filled out yet again and, while he was by no means overweight, he definitely wasn't as lithe as he once had been. All the straight lines and the hard angles had given way to a more rounded appearance. Almost a facade of Harry Potter. Some days, he felt more like Cornelius Fudge than he would like to admit. </p><p> A slight knock drew Harry out of his thoughts. 'Constant Vigilance', Alistair Moody muttered somewhere to the left of his mind, just outside of conscious thought. Clearing his throat, Harry drew all the authority he could muster at 9 o' clock on a Wednesday afternoon. <br/>"Come in."</p><p>"Harry Potter, sir?" Harry sighed in relief. Sometimes new interns and Auror Trainees were sent to him and he had to deal with the awkward awe they subjected him to. This time, however, it was none of the above. </p><p>"What can I do for you Dorothy?" <br/>Dorothy Harold was a withered old woman whoâ€™d seemingly been working for the Ministry since the early 1900's. As soon as he'd been appointed Head Auror she'd become Harry's permanent 'advisor'.</p><p>"Unfortunately, I have more paperwork for you lovely. I did take a little peek as the top one wasn't labelled anything silly like 'Private and Confidential.' And, I've told you several times, call me Dora." The soft voice she used was offset by the clicking of her tongue - a habit she'd gained whilst still a secretary under other Ministry officials, she'd confided. </p><p>Harry couldn't bring himself to call her Dora. Even now. </p><p>Dorothy seemed to move around the Ministry performing various roles for various people, with backgrounds in sectorial work, teaching and numerous other data collection work, she was what some would call a gossip. It was a wonder she hadn't been sacked. Then again, it would be hard to, considering that she'd been there to see at least seven different Ministers rise to - and fall from - power. He didn't have a problem with her reading his paperwork, he secretly believed she knew more than he did about it anyway, since he was only given what he had to know. Anything else, well, that was the Minister's business. </p><p>The plush carpet masked the footfalls of her low heeled boots and soon she was stood near enough to Harry's desk to easily deposit the small stack of paper. He would have thanked her for giving him something to do, if not for the two piles currently on his desk.  Two pieces of ripped parchment seemed to be spell-o-taped to what should look like mesh filing trays. Both of which were perched either side of his new computer. </p><p>It was Hermione's idea, of course. She had insisted he at least try to be like her. Organised, she'd called it. Harry just thought they took up desk space he needed. Needed to do what exactly? Stretch? Tap his fingers on the wood?</p><p>"Stop that!" Dorothy glared at his right hand, nails bitten down to the quick, rising and falling against the edge of his desk. Harry only barely noticed he was tapping out a Muggle tune he'd heard. </p><p>Harry concealed his burgeoning smile, ceasing his tapping only to pick up the papers Dorothy had tossed on his desk.<br/> "Sorry." </p><p>He eyed the 'finished' pile, despairing at how thin it was. Resolving to not just shove the new sheets he'd been handed at the bottom of the 'unfinished' pile and forget about them (again), Harry swivelled around in his chair. He pushed his glassed up the ridge of his nose before eyeing the notes before him. </p><p>His eyes dragged over typed lettering, the words just missing their target of absorption into his brain. Harry shook his head, dark hair brushing about halfway down his lenses. However long and unkempt it was, it would never truly be enough to hide the scar. Or the memories that came with it. </p><p>Swallowing another sip of strong coffee, Harry groaned inwardly. He glared at the papers in his hand until the words started to make sense. It was another case file, not unlike the rest, sort of. </p><p>Dorothy, who had tottered off and poured herself a hot tea, came back to squint over Harry's shoulder. She almost looked as if she hadn't moved from her position at all. Peering at him with fascinated, milky eyes, she smiled. "I think this case is yours, dear. Correct me if I'm wrong."</p><p>"Mine?" </p><p>"Yes, dear." Dorothy looked like a doting grandmother, coddling her sweet tea like a child. She carried on, explaining as if Harry couldn't read. (He might as well have not been able to, considering how he'd barely scanned the documents in front of him.) "There's no stains you see. The paper is all perfectly pressed, like ironing. Oh, and it has your name on it." She gestured towards the whole stack of paper, not just the top sheave. She banged the door shut - probably intentionally - on her way out, ensuring Harry elbowed his coffee off the doddering perch he called "empty space" on his cramped table. </p><p>She was right of course. If Harry had read the file as intended, he would have seen that his name was, indeed printed in block letters on the last sheet. However, he had run through the details rather quickly, assuming it would be passed over to the Aurors below him or another department of the Magical Law Enforcement. And did he have to show for that carelessness? An empty coffee mug and wet robes. Harry cursed at himself before casting a quick cleaning charm over his thighs. </p><p>the thick wad of papers into a folder, Harry pushed his chair back roughly and stood up. Tucking his wand into his robes, he made his way to the door, file tucked under his arm and empty mug in hand. He pressed his back against the heavy panelling until it gave way to his unrelenting shoulders. </p><p>He almost never got field work anymore, but the few times he was called upon for it, it was bad - very bad. He wasn't sure whether to be excited or worried. <br/>It turned out to be the latter.</p><p>***</p><p>The hall echoed as Harry made his way towards the lift at the end of the second floor. It was far too dark, and Harry gazed wearily at the flickering strip lights overhead. He walked faster, determined not to jump when one of the lights above sparked and, ultimately blew itself out. </p><p>"Morning Mister Potter, sir!" <br/>Harry's best attempt at a smile turned up a grimace as Richard Heath from Floo Maintenance (and Networking) whirled past him in the other direction, paying no mind to the flickering lights and ghostly inactivity of the hallway. How anyone could be that cheerful at such an early hour, Harry would never know. </p><p>Arriving on time was never Harry's strong suit, and it was on an even rarer occasion that he arrived early. However, the universe must have looked upon him with some grain of pity after the incident with the coffee, (that, and the fact that he was almost running through the Curse Breaking Department in order to avoid no-one in particular) because he did, in fact, have to wait outside the Minister's door for a full five minutes before being let inside. </p><p>Shacklebolt sat atop the seat as a king might sit atop a throne, it suited him quite well and Harry had grown used to the way he scratched at the underside of his desk with his pencil when he was frustrated. Unfortunately, he was doing just that almost constantly now. And even Harry - who was still an unobservant bloke by all standards - had noticed. (It was a wonder at all that he'd passed General Training - let alone become Head of anything). </p><p>"Harry." <br/>The illusion of invitation was inviting enough and, on some level, even more warm than usual. For the past year and a half Harry felt like he was back in the Auror Academy; or even Hogwarts, for the amount of times he was called into office for unwarranted behaviour. But looking at the Minister's expression, Harry wished more than ever that he'd just been caught Apparating while drunk. </p><p>The Minister's face was grave as he glanced down at the file Harry still had clutched in his hands, held before him like a child holding a stuffed bear. The grating sounds of the pencil stopped. </p><p>Harry was shocked out of his thoughts at the subsequent snapping of said pencil. <br/>"Mr. Potter?" All the warm undertones of Shacklebolts rolling voice were gone. "Meeting. Ten thirty-five. Sharp."</p><p>"Yes, Minister."</p><p>****</p><p>"I'm sure you're aware why you're all here." </p><p>Shacklebolt looked around the room and Harry suddenly seemed to realise the long table had filled with people. Most were from his own Department, Aurors that had been under him for two years or more - including Ron Weasley, who gave him a subtle wink from across the table. </p><p>Upon closer inspection - Harry called it an inspection but he was really trying to stay awake - he was coffee-less and Shacklebolt's voice was drawling - he saw a lot of faces he knew. A smattering of other staff members were in place too; Curse Breakers, some people from the Improper Use of Magic Offices... some people he didn't recognise, their robes being a colour he hadn't encountered. A few wizards from the Department of Mysteries were also loitering about the entrance.</p><p>Unsuccessfully trying to hide a shudder that spread through him, Harry turned back to the head of the table, where Shacklebolt's eyes were pinned to him. </p><p>"Ah, I'm glad you were listening after all Auror", Shacklebolt chuckled, but the sound was as hollow as Harry's heart, which might as well have dropped out of his chest completely. "What would you suggest?" Dark eyes pierced him to his chair and Harry had a suspicion that even if he could draw his attention away from the imposing man, he'd be confronted with a lot of expectant faces instead. </p><p>Swallowing thickly, Harry crossed his fingers under the table. "I suggest asking Auror Pines first, sir." </p><p>Shacklebolt narrowed his eyes for a split second before whirling around, fixing his gaze on Pines. Harry glanced at her, hoping to convey how sorry he was to be putting her in this position. It was her first year on the force, she was barely out of the Academy before they'd assigned her to work under Weasley's faction of Aurors. </p><p>She was a small girl, the mousey brown hair she sported currently pulled into a tight ponytail. It made her look young and the way she shrank back into her ministry issued robes made Harry feel guilty.</p><p> "I, um - uh, I think- I think that we'd be vulnerable with too many scouts sir." Her pale green eyes darted around the table. When no one interuppted - to disagree or otherwise - she continued, "the operation would have to be low-profile until we know what we're dealing with." </p><p>Shacklebolt nodded, sitting back in his seat. During Rebecca's little speech, he'd leant forward in his seat, hands on his chin, listening raptly. Harry thought he'd have pointed out inconstancies - since that was what he'd done with Harry the first time a higher-up had denoted something to him. </p><p>"Do you conclude the same, Auror Potter?" <br/>Harry hoped his flush didn't reach down the back of his neck at the realisation that he was probably just incompetent. </p><p>"Um- yes, actually, two to six scouts would be best-"</p><p>Kingsley still didn't look entirely convinced that Harry had heard the briefing, but he seemed to have answered well enough that he couldn't be questioned further until alone. The possibility of which left him  simultaneously relieved and terrified.</p><p>Before further discussion could begin, the door was flung open and all heads turned to see a (slightly sweaty) Draco Malfoy approach the table, he slipped into his seat without a word, flicking hair that had plastered to his forehead, not unflatteringly, out of his eyes. <br/>Kingsley paid no mind, continuing with the discussion. </p><p>Harry was slightly furious at that. If he'd done it - </p><p>His thoughts were cut short as a lightness to Kingsley's originally grim tone  caught his attention. "And Mister Malfoy, I'm so happy to see you're the first to volunteer for Scout Duty!"<br/>Harry was delighted to note Draco's look of absolute horror at the prospect.</p><p>"Anyone else?" The faux cheer in his voice continued around the room as other people made their excuses and the men from the Department of Mysteries seemed to vanish. "AH!" His eyes swivelled over Harry's head as he seemed to spot someone at the other end of the room. Harry seemed almost smug until Shacklebolt's booming voice came back to life.</p><p>"Auror Potter! Brilliant of you to allow Mister Malfoy here to join your case!" Harry's self-righteous smirk dropped from his face. He should have seen it coming. All the signs had been there, (including his name, printed in bold, black ink on the back of his case notes). He was an idiot, sometimes. Dorothy often reminded him he was what was known as unobservant. It wasn't a word that settled his stomach when he thought about all the Dark Wizard catching that lay ahead. </p><p>He wished for a polite, adult way he could bang his head on the desk in front of him. Sadly, there was not, so he settled for a sullen frown instead before clearing up his paperwork and moving to leave. He stole a glance at Malfoy, who had managed to catch his eye from where he was standing. Thankfully, he didn't look all too thrilled at the predicament now that it had sunk in that he'd have to actually work with Harry. </p><p>***</p><p>They'd always had a rocky relationship, but since the War (and everything that had transpired since), Harry and Draco were on nodding terms - that is to say, if nodding terms also includes taking the long way round to the Atrium once or twice a week to avoid all civilities altogether. </p><p>Draco definitly didn't carry his name as well as his father had and it showed all too much, especially in Harry's presence. It's glaringly obvious by how uncomfortably he was squirming in his seat. Harry had the odd inclination to move his chair forward and make sure there was as little space as possible between himself and Draco - just to see how the poor sod would react. </p><p>Fortunately for Draco, the table was sandwiched haphazardly between them. He looked over the desk, down his thin nose at Harry. <br/>"I know you disapprove of House Elves but this is ridiculous!"</p><p>"What's ridiculous?" Harry hummed as he licked his index finger, peeling a piece of paper from the top of his pile of unfinished work.</p><p>Draco huffed and gestured to the mess. "You have an office, that the Ministry so kindly supplied to you, and you let it get like this. I think if a bomb exploded in here you wouldn't notice much of a difference." </p><p>Harry snorted and pulled a pen from under the shambles of an overstuffed desk drawer. </p><p>"What's that?" </p><p>"A pen?" Harry answered sounding slightly amused.</p><p>"Why don't you just use a quill like the rest of us?"</p><p> "Just because Hogwarts keeps up an aesthetic from the 1800's doesn't mean I have to." Harry shrugged. It wasn't as if he couldn't use a self writing quill, he just preferred the Muggle way of doing things sometimes. (A lot of the time, recently - it used to drive Ginny up the wall). </p><p>They sat in silence for longer than was comfortable. Harry was the first to break it. "What can I do for you, Malfoy?" <br/>His tone wasn't unpleasant, but a certain childhood insolence had snuck it's way into the childhood nickname, he wasn't sure he could actually help it, after all this time. Some habits died hard, at least that's what he told himself. Although, he wasn't sure if he could be so forgiving if Malfoy took on the same tone. He also wouldn't be surprised. </p><p>Pulling himself together, he tried again. "We're going to have to be civil if we're going to work together on this case; do you have the notes?"<br/>"Of course I have the notes, Potter." Draco decided he wasn't going to point out that he was the only one remaining civil because as soon as he said it it would contradict his original statement and he wasn't a hypocrite. </p><p>He wasn't anymore, he amended thoughtfully. After the last battle everything had changed. He had Potter to thank for his place at the Ministry and Potter to thank for his Azkaban ruling. Always Potter. <br/>"Well, not always..." </p><p>Potter hummed in acknowledgement. He had actually heard part of Draco's musings, and even if he didn't ask, it was still an invasion of his privacy. Draco would reprimand himself at home for speaking out of turn, but, as far as he was concerned, he was in Harry's office. Harry's office was Harry's space, not his, so everything bad that happened while there was Harry's fault, obviously.</p><p>"Malfoy?"<br/> Draco's head jerked up as if he'd just been caught with his head in someone else's pensieve. <br/>"The notes?"<br/>"Oh. yes." He'd been so wrapped up in himself that he hadn't had a chance to take the folder from his satchel. </p><p>There wasn't optimal space for Harry's belongings on his desk, let alone Draco's. So he pushed his chair back to make room on his lap for the printed case notes. He hadn't questioned it when Shacklebolt had handed the papers to him, but now, he conceded it would have been a good idea to look over them in a private setting first. </p><p>The sharp intake of breath he gave made Harry look up from the case he was examining. He pulled over a different stack of paper and grimaced. He knew why Draco had reacted as soon as his eyes hit the suspect list. <br/>The interrogation put the Slytherins first. </p><p>"Hermione is trying to change it, you know." Harry said in an effort to quell the annoyance that flashed darkly across grey eyes.<br/> If it was possible Draco's eyes grew darker, and his lips turned upwards in a sour attempt at a smile. "Thank you." He managed before going back to his notes.</p><p>Harry had already read his, multiple times. It was about the only thing he'd done on schedule because it had been so long since a case had been so fascinating. And, it was his case, too. He hadn't had one of those in a long time either, which would have been disappointing, if he wasn't being paired up with Malfoy. He was reminded of a time in his Muggle school - primary - when all the children had to pick a partner and their teacher had instructed them to hold hands. <br/>Harry couldn't imagine holding hands with a Malfoy, Draco or otherwise. He pulled a face as Lucius crossed his mind. </p><p>Harry jumped in shock as Draco's thin mouth opened, "Weren't thinking about my father were you Potter?" </p><p>It had been quite some time since anyone had thought, or spoke of the elder Malfoy, but Draco recognised the disgusted face all the same, he remembered it in the testimony hall at Lucius' trial and again when Narcissa had begged for a shorter sentence/release two years ago. </p><p>Draco watched Harry shiver, the movement going through his spine first, before it spread across to his right hand. </p><p>He almost laughed at Harry's sour expression as a mug fell to the floor. </p><p>Harry buried his head in his hands, propping his elbows on the paper scattered around his desk and moaned. "That's the second time today." He mumbled.<br/>Dorothy appeared not a moment later, almost as if Harry summoned her with his frustrated wailing. </p><p>"Oh dear. You really need to do something about this mess, flower, no one can work in this." She affected the air of concern she always did with present guests, but she didn't keep it up for long. Neither man said anything when she pointedly rolled her her eyes before pulling her wand from the elastic of her skirt's waistband. <br/>"Tergeo". </p><p>Glaring at Harry disapprovingly, Dorothy's eyes moved to Draco. She kept her eyes trained on him after she'd given him the once over. They'd never worked in the same sector - Dorothy favouring the higher-up's - but they'd crossed paths enough for her to know his name. <br/>"Malfoy, isn't it?" </p><p>"Yes." It would have been said tersely, if it were directed at Harry, but this woman was nothing like Harry and she looked old enough to forget anyone's name, regardless of how infamous a death eater they were. </p><p>"Harry talks about you all the time!" She didn't insinuate that what Harry had said about Draco was downright abhorrent at worst and unimaginatively petty at best. Harry didn't even try to correct her, or he would become a stuttering mess, and somehow, that was worse than Dorothy's false perkiness that she didn't seem to exhibit anywhere else. </p><p>Harry fingered his collar underneath his robes before resolving to take them off altogether. With the three of them standing in the messy room, Harry felt both trapped and hot. It wasn't stifling by any means, but he took the opportunity to crack the window behind him anyway - if only to break away from Draco's uncomfortably blank eyes. </p><p>Smiling at Draco, Dorothy glanced around the rest of the room before Harry heard her small heels clacking across the floor toward the front door of Harry's office. When he didn't look up, she made an extra effort to look imposing in the doorway. She managed it too, even with her short stature and her billowing skirt, the early afternoon sun that filtered through the window, glancing off Harry's paperwork and dissipating at her feet, leaving her as a shadowy hulk, her elbows elongating once she planted her hands squarely on her lower hips. She did look quite menacing, even Draco had to agree.</p><p>"Humph, honestly", she muttered under her breath as Harry continued to ignore her. "The things I do for you." Cutting herself off so she could concentrate, Dorothy raised her wand, citing several incantations that Harry had probably never used in his life. Slowly, his stacks of paperwork floated into neat, organised piles. </p><p>"Hey! Now I won't know where anything is!" Harry protested, but he didn't try to counter Dorothy's cleaning spells. Instead, he and Draco watched in rapt fascination as she dispelled the dust from the windowsill and cast a quick reparo on an old stool in the corner, before transfiguring it into a footstool. </p><p>Glowering at Harry, she turned towards the door again. "Make yourself comfortable then, ungrateful-". </p><p>"Dorothy?" Draco sounded as though he was trying to talk to his mother when she had a particularly bad bout of forgetfulness and everything came out as a question. "I don't suppose you could make me a tea? Two sugars?" Nodding, Dorothy removed herself from Harry's office, letting the door shut with a bang. <br/>Harry looked mortified. "She's not senile you know." Malfoy just threw his head back and laughed</p><p>***</p><p>"I like her". Draco mumbled through his second cup of tea. Harry could practically taste the air thick with Draco's sugared tea. It was sickly. He wrinkled his nose and deigned to answer fully, although the noncommittal hum of assent seemed to appease Draco. He held his tongue from comment on Draco's appearance at the meeting. He did, however, speak when Draco brandished his wand. </p><p>Harry almost sighed, thinking they'd end up in a childish fight as they had as, well, children. It almost ended that way.</p><p>He didn't quite know what to think when his possessions started rearranging themselves for a second time that day. A simple "Locomotor" from Draco had his entire room up in the air. Anything that wasn't tied to the floor was already making it's way across his room, things being re-positioned and re-stacked. <br/>"What the hell are you doing". It sounded almost inarticulate - adolescent in the way his voice rose and dipped, cracking in places it shouldn't at his age. </p><p>"Rearranging," was Draco's only reply. Harry noticed that his hair was back to the way it had been in school, plastered to his skull like an official, not a school-boy, or, in this case, Harry's underclassman. He wondered briefly when Draco had had chance to right himself. Probably in the tea-room with Dorothy when Harry had been going through his file patterns. Draco had seemed to take too long chatting... </p><p>Harry pulled himself from his thoughts, grappling for his wand, which was jammed in his front pocket and not the designated wand slot on his robes, as Draco's had been. Late afternoon light filtered through the curtains and down his wrist. </p><p>Wearily, he pocketed his wand again.</p><p>Technically, Draco was under him. Not an Auror and certainly not a respected man in his field. Not that he wasn't talented, he was. He just wasn't trustworthy. The Ministry had taken a stab in the dark at many of their new employee's. No one wanted to work for a corrupt company and many had fled the country after the war. Whatever the reason, the Ministry now seemed to (unintentionally) comprise itself of two factions - those who worked there to make it a better place, and those who worked there to make themselves look like better people. Unfortunately, most of these people weren't the type to change, so many got put in a position like Draco's. </p><p>Draco Malfoy, however, knew he had a better deal than most. Harry Potter was too noble and righteous to believe anyone was under him (deserved placement or not) and Draco himself, well, he just didn't like being thought of as a lesser person. It made him uneasy when he really scrutinised himself and determined it was probably necessary for redemption. </p><p>Both men jumped involuntarily at the tea-trolley sound of Harry's wall clock. He'd affectionately given it the name in remembrance of the tinny, jangling sound (along with the accompanying squeaky wheels) of the metal trolley on the Hogwarts Express. Although, he didn't fancy telling Draco that. </p><p>"It's six o' clock". Harry mumbled almost inaudibly. He was almost on repeat now, a constant that would drive his wife mad if she knew he was doing it. </p><p>That was the image he left with, Ginny berating about quitting from 'that hell hole' and leaving the god forsaken place behind. She was always bright-eyed and starry when she came back from work, because she loved her job, and believed Harry should too. Well, a small smile played at his lips; she couldn't whinge when he told her he's been assigned a new case, well, hopefully. </p><p>It turned out to be a double edged sword.</p>
