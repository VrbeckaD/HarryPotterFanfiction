  <p dir="ltr"><em>My mum decided to give me this diary for my birthday 2 days ago. I've asked her so many times to change diary to journal on the cover, but she keeps saying no.</em> </p>

  <p dir="ltr"><em>So, I guess I have to write about my 'feelings' in here. I'm pretty sure normal guys shouldn't have to do this, but whatever.</em> <em>My mum told me that she wouldn't allow me to eat any sweets for a month if I didn't write a long passage before the week ends. How rude! That's a horrible punishment for not writing in here. She makes no sense. </em></p>

  <p dir="ltr"><em>My mum decided to tell me about her time at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. She was placed into Hufflepuff, the house for people like me. The stories she told consisted of her classes, O.W.L.s, N.E.W.T.s, and how she finally got a boyfriend in sixth year.</em> <em> I fell asleep just listening to her talk. She's now grounded me from eating sweets for a week. The nerve of that woman. </em></p>

  <p dir="ltr"><em>In other news, I got my Hogwarts letter yesterday! Just a little less than two months and I'll be stepping onto the Hogwarts Express. I'm excited, but nervous at the same time. I just don't know if I'll make any friends. Everyone would probably hate me for no reason.</em> <em>B</em><em>ut if I did make friends, I would stay loyal to them until the day I die. If not, then I would know I was having a nightmare.</em></p>

  <p dir="ltr"><em>I was scurrying around in my backyard when I found a gray rat scurrying around as </em> <em>well</em> <em>. I picked it up and examined its features. It was a male rat that was as big as my foot. </em> <em>He had a long tail and black eyes. The most important detail though, is that one ear is cut in half. Strange...</em></p>

  <p dir="ltr"><em>The rat scurried around the yard while I chased him. I went easy on him at first but then decided not to anymore. I ran and almost jumped into a bush so I could catch him. I stood up slowly while keeping the rat in my hands and started walking back home until</em> he ran away. I could've sworn I heard him squeak, "Oh my wizardgod!"</p>

  <p dir="ltr"><em>I walked into my room and </em> <em>checked my legs. I noticed I had a couple bruises, but luckily, mum won't notice because I'm wearing jeans.</em></p>
