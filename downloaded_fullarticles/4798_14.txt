          <div class="userstuff"><p>1997 was a difficult year for the wizarding world at large, but it was a particularly difficult one for the group that would be come to known as the ‘<em>Golden </em>Trio’. One rainy morning found Ron resting after his disastrous apparition attempt, and Harry and Hermione puzzling over a book of children’s stories, searching and scanning for a clue to help them in their search for Voldemort’s horcruxes.</p><p>“I’m telling you ‘Mione”, said Harry, raking a hand through his dark hair, sending it into further disarray, “There’s got to be some clue in there”</p><p>Ron could hear the growing irritation his friend’s voice, a sound that was getting more and more familiar as their unofficial camping trip stretched ever longer with few tangible results. He blinked his eyes open, ready to respond if the argument got heated, in time to see Harry roll up the sleeves of his flannel shirt and bend over the book.</p><p>“Honestly Harry!” exclaimed Hermione, her exasperation evident as she peered over his shoulder, dark skin glowing in the light from the lantern they had set on the table “Do you really think Dumbledore left us a secret code in a <em>children’s book</em>”</p><p>“He wasn’t exactly known for his conventional ideas!” Harry shot back, flipping the pages</p><p>“I still say you’re looking too deeply into it.”</p><p>“Really? Because that’s what you said last year.” His voice took on an exaggeratedly high pitch “‘Oh Harry you’re just paranoid, Malfoy’s not acting anymore suspicious than usual!’ Look how well that turned out.”</p><p>Hermione let out an unintelligible noise of frustration, which perfectly masked Ron’s snort. He rolled over and went back to sleep, deciding that the situation was under control for now.</p><p>***</p><p>Hermione closed her eyes in defeat when her office door was shoved open, accompanied by a series of increasingly aggressive swears. Head Auror Blackwell must have been a prick again. She sighed and raised her head.</p><p>“Hello Harry.” She said calmly, putting her paperwork away. She never got any work done while Harry was in her office.</p><p>Harry slammed the door shut and began to pace the length of the room, muttering angrily, his brown face becoming flushed.</p><p>“… doesn’t know what he’s talking about. He’s worse than Lockheart I swear. At least that man was just incompetent, Blackwell is ignorant, and not willing to learn at all. He calls me ‘Mr.Potter’ so condescendingly I swear it almost makes me miss Snape!”</p><p>Harry paused for breath, and Hermione took the pause as an opportunity to interject “I’m sure he’s not so bad Harry.” She doubted it, Blackwell was the type of man who thought that he was God’s gift to wizards, and that his word was law. He and Harry had been at odds since Harry’s recruitment.  Harry glared at her, and she cursed internally.</p><p>“Really ‘Mione? <em>Not so bad?</em>”</p><p>“I-“</p><p>Harry threw his hands in the air dramatically, and Hermione bit back a groan. “That’s what you said about Snape too, remember?”</p><p>“Snape was on our side in the end!”</p><p>“And I’m sure you would have said that in sixth year, when I <em>tried</em> to tell everybody”</p><p>Hermione really did groan at that. “Tea?” she asked, as Harry launched into another diatribe. She was going to need much more than tea to deal with this today.</p><p>***</p><p>“Mrs. Granger-Weasley?” The inquisitive voice of Johnson, one of his trainees, pulled Harry out of his conversation with Ron. Johnson had apparently gotten bored waiting for his turn to take a crack at the exercise Harry had set up for them, and decided to strike up a conversation with Hermione, who was waiting for Harry and Ron to take their lunch break. “Mr. Potter mentioned that he predicted Professor Snape’s temporary defection back in his sixth year?”</p><p>Harry felt, rather than heard Hermione’s exasperated sigh, and Ron was visibly stifling his laughter, which was, frankly, rude. Johnson’s eyes held a mischievous twinkle that Harry was more used to seeing behind a pair of half-moon spectacles. This boy new exactly what he was doing.</p><p>“I wouldn’t say he predicted it…” began Hermione, and Harry let out an offended noise. Might as well give them a show.</p><p>“I definitely predicted it!”</p><p> “Harry you didn’t predict it so much as outright accuse him of being a death eater!”</p><p>“And I was <em>right</em>! But what did you all say? ‘No Harry, he can’t be a death eater! Dumbledore trusts him!’” Harry trailed off speculatively “In all fairness, you didn’t realize Dumbledore was playing a long game, so I guess that’s half a point in your favour?”</p><p>“<em>HARRY!”</em></p><p>“What, am I wrong? And more importantly, I was <em>right</em>!”</p><p>“That’s not the point!”</p><p>“Of course it’s point!”</p><p>Ron took this moment to step in between them. “Let’s take a break for lunch, shall we?” he said, unsuccessfully smothering his laughter, “And Johnson?”</p><p>The trainee, who was doing a poor job at concealing his own merriment, looked at him. “Yes sir?”</p><p>“Take a lap.”</p><p>***</p><p>If someone had told a 16 Year old Hermione Granger that she’d become an expert at an array of silencing spells, she would have assumed it was because she and her friends would need to sneak around in the war, or silence their enemies while infiltrating their bases. She would not have expected it to come from constantly silencing her best friend in the middle of his rants.</p><p>She wasn’t sure if she was more proud or irritated that Harry had gotten so good at nonverbal counter spells.</p><p>“And yet when Malfoy was acting susp-HURK”</p><p>She smiled as the spell took effect. It was a particularly complicated one, which Harry hadn’t yet been able to counteract by himself yet. She settled into her seat, enjoying the blissful silence, and keeping time in her head, out of habit. <em>12. 13. 14. 15. 16.</em></p><p> “AND YET, WHEN MALFOY WAS ACTING SUSPICIOUS, NONE OF YOU BELIEVED ME!”</p><p>Hermione wasn’t sure whether to laugh or cry when she met her friend’s smug grin.</p><p>***</p><p>“You know the lead singer of the <em>Petrifyd Pixies</em> is part Acromantula, right?” Harry said casually to Ron while making coffee in the breakroom.</p><p>Ron exhaled a huff of laughter, eyes darting to the corner of the room, where Hermione had buried her head in the Prophet in an attempt to ignore them. “Did you finally accept Luna’s offer to be a part-time contributor to the Quibbler then?</p><p>“I’m serious!”</p><p>“You’re mad, that’s what you are.”</p><p>“Not really surprised that you don’t believe me, to be honest.” said Harry, voice taking on the melodramatic pitch it always did when he was attempting to needle Hermione into a reaction. Ron fought back the bubble of laughter that threatened to explode out of him, unwilling to give up the game yet. “Merlin knows no one ever does. Voldemort in 5<sup>th</sup> Year. Malfoy in 6<sup>th</sup>. Snape.” He let out an exaggerated sigh, and Ron nearly choked on his coffee. Hermione muttered something into her paper, and Harry’s lips quirked upwards.</p><p>“If I was right about those, why can’t I be right when-“ his voice cut off and lips moved without making sound. Hermione shot them both a smug grin. Ron toasted his wife with his coffee mug. One point, Hermione.</p><p>***</p><p>James burst into the den where his siblings and cousins were entertaining themselves, face flushed, shaking with excitement.</p><p>“They’re at it again!” He shouted, locking eyes with Teddy, who was happy to leave the chess game he was losing to Hugo.</p><p>“What’s it about?”</p><p>“Whether Uncle Kingsley is moonlighting as a muggle private detective.” said James, who still waiting by the door, with an extendable ear trailing out into the hall.</p><p>Teddy grinned.</p><p>“Place your bets everyone!” He called, fishing out his ever present notebook and pencil. The muggle method of note keeping was much more useful in this scenario.</p><p>“Malfoy, a level three silencing spell, Dad will throw it off in under 30 seconds, and Uncle Ron will intervene by 2 minutes in, pulling Aunt Hermione away. 1 sickle.” said Albus confidently.</p><p>“Snape. A beginner level spell, because mum thinks it’ll throw Uncle Harry for a loop, and it’ll take him a minute to break it. Dad won’t have to intervene. A sickle and 5 knuts.” Countered Rose.</p><p>Teddy was nodding as he scribbled the details into his notepad. The other cousins took it in turn to place their bets, not noticing Lily and Hugo huddled together in a corner. Lily suddenly piped up, inserting her opinion in the betting pool for the first time.</p><p>“Hugo and I say both Snape and Malfoy, Aunt Audrey’s favourite silencing charm, and it’ll take dad 10 seconds to counter it. Oh and Uncle Ron will distract Dad before Aunt Hermione gets mad. 6 sickles.”</p><p>Teddy looked at his god sister for a moment.</p><p>“Are you sure Lils?” asked Dominque, looking up from her book. “That’s an awfully specific bet. And that’s half your allowance.”</p><p>“We’re sure.” said Hugo, with a smirk. Teddy returned the look, and wrote it down in the book, silence overtook them. James was listening intently.</p><p>“Don’t be upset if you don’t get all of the categories.” Fred told Lily and Hugo in a low voice “Teddy’s the only one who’s ever done that.”</p><p>“Ah yes, the Great Explosion of 2012.” said Teddy wistfully, as Hugo’s queen threw his bishop off the board.</p><p>Lily just grinned at them. The room was silent once more.</p><p>“MERLINS SOGGY LEFT SOCK!” yelled James, making everyone in the room jump and setting off the house of cards that Louis, Roxanne, and Molly were building with a pack of exploding snap.</p><p>“What happened?” asked Victorie, after she made sure no one was harmed.</p><p>James said nothing, simply looked at Hugo and Lily in awe. The two just smiled at him beatifically.</p><p>Harry pretended not to know where Lily got the money for her new Pygmy puff.</p><p>***</p><p>Scorpius thought that the World Wide Wizarding Web, WWWW as it was more commonly known, was probably the best crossover from Muggle society to enter the wizarding world. Even his father had taken to it, running a fairly popular Howler account. The wizard who took the muggle concept of Twitter and introduced it to the wizarding world was minting galleons, Scorpius was sure of it.</p><p>He was following his father of course, as well as other well-known personalities. Like Harry Potter. Honestly at this point <em>everyone </em>was following Harry Potter. The man was genuinely funny, and he wasn’t just saying that because he was his best mate’s dad. Mr. Potter’s posts were part cool Auror stuff, part dorky dad stuff, and part gallows humour. It was great. Of course lately, his Howler account was more entertaining than usual, because Scorpius’ dad decided to get involved. They were both prominent personalities, what with his dad being a highly visible advocate for muggleborn integration and Mr. Potter being who he was. They were even on civil terms in real life, they had just never interacted online.</p><p>Then Mr. Potter had shared a link to an online Prophet article stating that  a high ranking ministry official was participating in questionable rituals, with the comment “Y’all didn’t believe me about Malfoy either!”</p><p>His father had responded with “What did you say about me Potter?!” and the game was on. For weeks. It was equal parts entertaining and exhausting. Scorpius had called Albus to ask for details about that betting pool he was always talking about.</p><p>Hermione Weasley-Granger had to invent a silencing spell that worked over the web. And possibly changed Mr. Potter’s password. Scorpius was a little unclear on that part. It took Mr. Potter three days to figure out how to break the charm and reset his password so that he could type again. Sorpius’ dad took it as a win.</p><p>***</p><p>

  <strong>Excerpt from the Daily Prophet:</strong>
</p><p align="center">HARRY POTTER COMES OUT OF THE CUPBOARD!</p><p align="center">IS THERE MORE TO THE WIZARDING WORLD’S GOLDEN BOY THAN EVERYONE THINKS</p><p>
  <strong>Rita Skeeter</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>In a shocking twist to what seemed to be a normal, if rather morbid series of Howler posts, Harry Potter, known to the wizarding world as the Chosen One who defeated the Dark Lord Voldemort 25 years ago, revealed to the world that he is Gay. In the tweet, Potter referred to his childhood in the cupboard, <strong>clearly </strong>a veiled statement alluding to Mr. Potter’s sexuality. That’s right ladies and gentlemen, you heard it here first, our beloved hero Harry Potter is Gay! Does his wife know? Do his children? Those are questions your intrepid reporter has gone to great lengths to answer.</em>
