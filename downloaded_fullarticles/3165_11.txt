    <p>Harry is all about mending fences after the war ends.  Maybe a bit too much about it, all things considered, but everyone copes in his own way, and Harry would prefer to pretend at closure than to acknowledge that things nearly never wrap up as neatly as one would like.</p><p>Ron and Ginny, as a natural extension of their family, are not naturally inclined towards mending fences.  The Weasleys are the sort to hold righteous grudges, a trait which can be both a tremendously endearing credit and a tremendously frustrating flaw, often at the same time.</p><p>Hermione is more practically minded.  Since the war has ended, life must go on, and supposing one wishes to make something of her life, one cannot just simply pretend a significant portion of the wizarding world no longer exists simply because it is unpleasant.  So, when Harry gets caught on the notion of mending fences with the Malfoy family, Hermione allows herself to be dragged along.</p><p>The small gathering is uniquely uncomfortable.  Hermione doesn't know how she'll explain to Harry that just because someone doesn't actively want him dead, or, less specifically, doesn't actively want the utter destruction of the world as they know it, doesn't mean they'll have something to chat about over tea.  But the manor is big enough to wander whilst Harry and a handful of other prominent 'representatives' make nice, and it's really rather beautiful when one is not being tortured in it.</p><p>Hermione isn't the sort of person who attracts attention when she doesn't try to, a fact which used to drive her to acts of utter madness in the hopes of the barest sliver of recognition, but as she's grown up, she's realized that blending in can be a tremendous asset.  No one pays her much mind now, for example, and she is ostensibly free to roam the halls of an old wizarding mansion in peace.</p><p>She strolls with arms folded subconsciously across her chest, observes face after cruel, hard face sneering at her from each family portrait she passes, positively shivers when her eye catches on a portrait of the three Black sisters with a dark explosion right in the center.</p><p>They're much younger in the picture, but Hermione would know either of them anywhere.  Right next to one another, she can even see the family resemblance: each holds her head proudly and curls her lip just so, a smile both beautiful and cold.</p><p>Without meaning to, Hermione draws nearer, captivated by a young Bellatrix Lestrange, eyes clear of madness and even of malice, haughty but not deranged.  Not unlike uncovering the history of Tom Riddle, it's disturbing to think of Bellatrix, who haunts Hermione's nightmares, as just another person one might come across in the course of a lifetime.  She remembers hearing about how people liked Riddle, even trusted him, and tries to imagine a circumstance in which it could have been the same with Bellatrix.</p><p>Just beyond the stilted chatter from the other room, Hermione becomes aware of piano music somewhere above her.  Her eyes follow the gilded banister that follows the staircase nearest her, wondering idly whether she is allowed to go upstairs unaccompanied and, setting that aside, whether doing so is a good idea.  Mending fences or not, who knows what horrors still lurk in a place such as this?</p><p>Still, the music is enchanting, all the more so the longer she listens, and Hermione fears she will never grow immune to the thrill of doing something just slightly outside the bounds of polite behaviour.</p><p>She ascends the stairs cautiously, expecting an alarm or, perhaps a bit foolishly, some kind of medieval trap, but is met only with the disapproving stares of more family portraits that line the walls.  The tune is familiar, something she's sure she recognizes, but if it's sounding in the halls of this place, she doubts very much that it's a Muggle composer.</p><p>A part of her is on high alert, reminding her with increasing notes of desperation that she should definitely not be up here, should just go back to the little party and grit her teeth and ask the hosts where that enchanting music is coming from, but still her feet carry her onward, and her eyes grow heavy-lidded in response to the swell in the melody.  Her parents loved classical music, before they—</p><p>And when she was a little girl, and the weather grew stormy enough to frighten her, they pulled out something grand and sweeping.  They opened all the windows and turned the volume up high, and together they danced and twirled to the song and the storm alike.</p><p>Hermione stops cold, and the memory fades.</p><p>She had heard.  Known.  Been glad, even, for in Hermione's opinion, death is nearly never better, never deserved, for who is to say when a person is beyond saving?  She has thought this as recently as a few moments prior, gazing upon the face of a younger and saner woman immortalized in a family portrait.</p><p>Still, it's like seeing a ghost, or the beginnings of a nightmare.</p><p>Bellatrix Lestrange sits at a grand piano, posture perfect, long, dark hair and long, dark gown falling all around her, a shadow in a sun-streaked room.  Her eyes are half-closed, and she plays, expressive yet restrained, beautiful, yet somehow heart-wrenching.</p><p>Hermione ought to leave.</p><p>She ought never to have come here, to this room or to this house, Harry would have been fine without her, just like everyone is always fine without her—better off, even, from Harry to Ron to her parents, so Hermione should just go downstairs, say her goodbyes, and—</p><p>"Not enjoying the festivities?" Bellatrix wonders coolly as she plays.</p><p><em>I'm sorry to disturb you, I'll just be going, oh Merlin, what am I doing here?</em>  "It's a lovely piece," she hears herself say as though from a great distance.  "I...sort of couldn't resist it."</p><p>"Hm," says Bellatrix as her left hand crosses the right with a flourish both musical and visual.  "Lucida Nightingor," she continues at the start of the next phrase.  "The wife of the famous Alastair Nightingor, although I suppose you wouldn't know anything about that—" another flourish, in time with the <em>t</em>, "—would you?"</p><p>"Lucida Nightingor," Hermione echoes, too distracted to pay the insult much mind.  "Her husband drove her mad," she continues vaguely, in the way of old knowledge half-remembered.  "Wasn't it speculated that he stole her work?"</p><p>"Stole," Bellatrix scoffs airily.  "As though a woman's work is her own.  How can he steal what is his under the law?"</p><p>"But that law was changed," Hermione insists.  "And people were—"</p><p>"People," Bellatrix spits, "do not know, and do not want to.  Why, it's only a Mudblood and a madwoman speaking of it now, a century too late, and no one cares what either one of us has to say."</p><p>Hermione falls silent, feeling somehow too vulnerable to lash out.</p><p>"Incidentally," Bellatrix continues as the music changes, "a handful of pieces were published under her name, even after her marriage.  They were the ones dear Alastair deemed too simple to bear his illustrious name, I'm sure, but they hold their own charm in that respect."</p><p>Hermione has drawn nearer without realizing it, and now she can clearly see the heavy chains upon Bellatrix's ankles catching the light beneath her dark gown.  Bellatrix affords Hermione a sideways glance, derisive, dismissive, but decidedly lucid.  Utterly divorced from the unhinged woman Hermione remembers.</p><p>"You're looking...very well, all things considered," Hermione dares, clumsily.</p><p>"Such glowing praise," Bellatrix drawls, with only the faintest hint of the mocking singsong Hermione remembers.  "What a wonder you haven't stolen my heart already."</p><p>"I'm glad you're alive," Hermione says, too loudly, and all in a rush. </p><p>The music stops short, and Bellatrix looks directly up at her with an unreadable expression.  "Are you," she says coolly, not even nearly a question.</p><p>Hermione lifts her chin proudly, not unlike the portrait of the three Black sisters.  "Yes," she says.</p><p>Bellatrix stands, slowly, movements smooth like the flowing gown she wears, and with each passing moment she grows further from the madwoman Hermione remembers and nearer to the portrait Hermione could not previously have imagined.  Hermione remembers a monster, with a hunched back and twisted features and a mad, terrible face.  This woman stands tall and her features, though sharp, are not ugly by any stretch of the imagination.  Indeed, Hermione finds herself momentarily flung out of the confines of her reality, faced with a stranger instead of a ghost and a nightmare, and for the duration of that moment, she is dazzled by Bellatrix's beauty.</p><p>"And why is that?" Bellatrix wonders, with the faintest hint of menace just beneath her surface of her tone, and the edges of the universe fall back into place around them.  "Is this fitting enough a punishment for you?  Granger?" she draws out the name with the utmost disgust, gesturing down to the shackles on her feet, and then she leans in, looming.  "Would a fiery explosion have been a bit overkill, in your expert opinion?"</p><p>Hermione holds her head higher, finds that she must to meet Bellatrix's burning gaze, finds that she is not nearly so immune to Bellatrix's beauty even now, when she is suddenly so much closer to the monster Hermione remembers.</p><p>But there is the monster, and then there is this woman, who plays the piano and spins a tale of a woman driven mad, her life's work stolen from her by a man who purported to love her, and in spite of everything, Hermione cannot bring herself to wish an utter end to the woman who stands before her.</p><p>"How fortunate I am," Bellatrix continues, again with the shadow of mocking singsong, "that the Righteous Mudblood deems me worthy of life.  I shall tell you, that makes exactly one person who wouldn't prefer I had died."</p><p>"Not even you?" Hermione challenges before she has fully intended to speak, and she steps forward even despite a desperate part of herself still begging her to turn tail and run.</p><p>Bellatrix lets out a little huff, something like halfhearted derision, or mirthless amusement.  "A fine life I've been left with," she says quietly, then returns to the piano bench and starts up playing another tune, something low and dark like distant thunder.</p><p>"Our Lucida was a fool, did you know?" Bellatrix continues, cool and detached once more.</p><p>"A fool?" Hermione echoes.</p><p>"She was by all accounts the better musician.  But she fancied herself <em>in love</em>," Bellatrix sneers.  "Alastair laid on the charm, and she diminished herself to fit neatly into the shadow of a lesser man."</p><p>Hermione traces a finger along the edge of the piano, averts her eyes so she has the courage to ask, "And you?"</p><p>She feels rather than sees Bellatrix look up, but the music does not falter.  "I have never been so foolish as to fancy myself in love with any man," she replies crisply.  "But some of us are not so fortunate as the Queen Mudblood and her enlightened opinion that because a law is changed the people will follow it gladly."</p><p>Hermione looks up, and Bellatrix returns her attention to the keys.  The music swells, effusive, emotional, gripping, but Bellatrix's posture and expression do not change.</p><p>"As far as I could tell," Bellatrix continues, so quietly her voice might well be a part of the piece she plays, "the only choice I had was in whose shadow I might tread."</p><p>The melody rises again, a soaring melisma over dense chords in the bass as it comes to a heavy and dark conclusion.  "You'd better get back to the party, <em>Miss Granger</em>."  Again she draws out Hermione's name like it's an insult upon her lips.  But then, to Hermione's surprise, the corner of her lip twitches into a smirk that bears no malice.  "Merlin help you if anyone in attendance learns you preferred my company to everyone else combined."</p>
