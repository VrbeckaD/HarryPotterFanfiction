    <p>The Order of the Phoenix was sitting at the long dining room table in Number 12 Grimmauld Place. The members of the Order that were present consisted of Albus Dumbledore, Sirius Black, Remus Lupin, Bill Weasley, Molly Weasley, Arthur Weasley, Alastor "Mad Eye" Moody, and Nymphadora Tonks. The rest of the people eating dinner were made up of teenagers by the names of Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger, Fred and George Weasley, and Ginny Weasley.</p><p>With Harry's trial tomorrow he wasn't as happy as he usually was when with the Weasley's and co., neither was anyone else for that matter. They ate their meal in silence and would have continued to if there wasn't a thud that came from the next room.</p><p>Instantly everyone had their wands out and the members of the Order rose up. After glancing quickly at the children Remus spoke, "You all stay here, we'll check it out." He looked at his former Headmaster for his agreement and led the group of adults out of the room after getting a nod of approval. As soon as the wizards had left the room the teenagers looked at each other. Without saying a word they all nodded simultaneously and hurried quietly after the others, their wands held out readily in front of them.</p><p>They were about to enter the room in which the Order members had disappeared when a voice stopped them. "No...it can't be," the unmistakable voice of Sirius managed to croak out. "It can't be..." This was all the small group of kids needed to continue after their superiors.</p><p>What they found in the room, it was a type of living room, was a circle of people surrounding...something. Managing to squeeze their way in between the adults, the teenagers looked at whatever was lying on the floor in front of them.</p><p>"We told you all to stay behind!" Molly shrieked at her children and their friends. But no one paid attention to her, they were too busy gazing at the thing before them. Harry looked up at his godfather and was surprised to find his face deathly pale, as if he'd seen a ghost.</p><p>"Sirius?" Harry asked. "Sirius, are you okay?" There was no answer. Just silence.</p><p>"Who is that?" Fred asked, directing the question at his father. Arthur looked up at his son, but he didn't answer. "I don't know," he replied honestly. None of the other Order members spoke up, although Dumbledore's eyes twinkled knowingly. It was Sirius who finally spoke.</p><p>"He's my brother," he whispered it so quietly that everyone had to strain to hear him. But they heard him all the same. Harry looked down at the boy at his feet once more.<br/>
He couldn't have been older than eighteen, but he looked a lot like Sirius. He was a lot smaller in stature, but he was just as handsome. His hair was definitely shorter and neater than Sirius's, but was the same shade of black. And if his eyes were open they would have been the same gray as his brother's. He was wearing a simple white v-neck t-shirt and blue jeans. He didn't have any shoes on and his feet poked out from under the jeans. He wasn't smiling, but wasn't frowning either. He just looked...peaceful.</p><p>"But...Sirius, your brother's dead," Remus said gently.</p><p>"Yeah," Sirius let out a dry, hollow sounding laugh, "yeah, I know." Tonks knelt down next the body and warily placed two of her fingers against the boy's throat.</p><p>"No pulse," she stated. The rest of the Order and co. looked at Sirius pityingly.</p><p>"He's a Death Eater?" Ron broke the silence. Everyone followed his eyes down to the dead teenager's left arm.</p><p>"He was, yeah," Sirius answered hoarsely. "He tried to get out of it, got in too deep. Or so I heard. No one just leaves the Death Eaters. He was killed because of that, the idiot. No one ever found his body."</p><p>The gathered few gazed down at Sirius's brother, confused. Hermione finally voiced what they'd all been thinking.</p><p>"If they never found his body," she started slowly, looking up at Sirius hesitantly, "then how did he get here?" No one had an answer for her.</p><p>"I brought him." Everyone spun around to face the direction the voice had come from. There, in the doorway, stood a very beautiful woman wearing a light blue and green gown with tapered sleeves and long brown hair. A spell fired from someone's wand hit her, but seemed to dissolve as soon as it hit her skin.</p><p>"That won't work on me," she said. Her voice was as pretty as she was, soft and kind, too.</p><p>"Who are you?" Dumbledore asked. How the heck was he remaining so calm? No one knew.</p><p>"My name is Fate," she said stepping forward. The group unconsciously parted to let her through. She knelt down next to Sirius's brother and brushed his hair out of his face.</p><p>"Hey! Just what do you think-," Sirius began sharply.</p><p>"Poor little Regulus," Fate murmured, interrupting Harry's godfather, "he died so young. Barely eighteen."</p><p>She straightened up, directing her gaze towards Sirius. "Died with his own brother hating him."<br/>
"How dare-," but once again he was cut off.</p><p>"Died without anyone knowing how, why, or what he died for," Fate continued. "Died all alone in the dark with no one there to save him. Without his big brother to protect him."</p><p>This time Sirius didn't say anything, just glared defiantly at the woman. "You don't know the real story, the true story of Regulus Arcturus Black. There's more to him than meets the eye. He wasn't just your parents' perfect little son. He wasn't just an obedient Death Eater. He wasn't just something you left behind when you ran away. He was so much more."</p><p>"What do you mean "left behind"?" Sirius was able to say this without Fate interrupting him this time. She smiled in response.</p><p>"Yes, poor little Regulus," she repeated. "Abandoned by his brother who swapped one family for another. Switching him for James. Leaving without saying goodbye, leaving Regulus all alone. Poor, poor Regulus Black."</p><p>About now everyone was at least slightly confused if not way more. Sirius was the same, yet he looked a little guilty and very sad. Sadder than Harry had ever seen him.</p><p>"When did you two drift apart?" Fate asked sharply, turning back to the dog animagus.</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"You and Regulus were close as children, were you not?" Fate continued. "When did you drift apart?"</p><p>"When I was sorted into Gryffindor, I suppose," Sirius answered slowly, not really sure what was going on.</p><p>"No, no, no," Fate shook her head, still smiling. "You're wrong there. Come on Sirius, you must remember."</p><p>Judging by his face, Sirius did not remember. The rest of the gathered people looked at him curiously, but he just shrugged in an "I-don't-know-what's-going-on-either" kind of way.</p><p>"You were right, it was at a sorting," Fate stepped away from Sirius and looked down at Regulus, "but not your own."</p><p>"What are you talking about?" Sirius inquired hoarsely. Fate just continued smiling.</p><p>"Maybe this will jog your memory," she said innocently. Fate snapped her fingers and a voice filled up the room, seemingly coming from everywhere at once.</p><p>"Siri, what are you talking about?"</p><p>"Reggie...," Sirius whispered. That had been his baby brother's voice. He didn't sound very old, probably around eleven. Yes, Sirius did remember this, and he remembered his response.</p><p>"I don't associate with filthy snakes!"</p><p>Sirius hung his head, not willing to meet anyone's eyes.</p><p>"Poor Regulus," Fate shook her head. "He was so excited to come to Hogwarts. To spend time with you again. He wrote to you your first year, but you stopped writing back. Then you didn't come home for Christmas. You didn't come out of your room during the summer except to go to your new friends' houses. And then that happened. He didn't push you away Sirius, you pushed him away."</p><p>Fate waited until Sirius had raised his head again to continue. "And then...then you left."</p><p>To say that Sirius looked guilty would be an understatement. He looked broken, like all those years of guilt had come crashing down on him and had buried him in a pile of "what if's" and "what could have been's". "What do you want?" The hurt in his voice made Harry want to throw his arms around his godfather. But he didn't. Now was not the time.</p><p>"Regulus learned a lot from watching you," Fate ignored Sirius. "He learned that love is conditional, that his parents could turn on him at anytime. He learned that being different is wrong. He learned that having your own thoughts on something was punishable. So he kept his head down, kept his mouth shut. But he kept his eyes and ears open. He saw and heard what others didn't. He knew things. Things you didn't think he knew. Things that could have, and did, get him killed."</p><p>Sirius and everyone else were thoroughly confused and intrigued at this point. "He knows things that could help you."</p><p>"Knows?" Mr. Weasley spoke up for the first time since the woman had come in. "As in present tense?" Fate continued smiling just as Dumbledore's eyes continued twinkling.</p><p>"There's a lot about your brother you don't know, Sirius," Fate smiled at the older Black sibling. "he had secrets, many, many secrets. And who knows? Maybe some will be worth finding out. But there's a catch. You can't ask him, he needs to tell you, otherwise he'll die again."</p><p>"Again?" Sirius sputtered. What the crap was going on?</p><p>"Yes, again," Fate nodded. She knelt down next to Regulus once more. "Poor Regulus. Regulus who did what he was told. Regulus who tried to please his parents. Regulus who was nice to house-elves. Regulus who just wanted his big brother back."</p><p>Everyone was still very confused and now slightly scared. Except for Dumbledore, who just kept twinkling away without a care in the world.</p><p>"Regulus Arcturus Black," Fate murmured quietly. She dipped her head down and placed her lips on the boy's forehead, kissing him. "R.A.B." And with that she disappeared, still smiling.</p><p>"What the bloody hell just happened?!" Ron asked, looking wildly around at everyone.</p><p>"Look!" Ginny yelled before anyone could answer her brother.</p><p>They were all shocked to see that Regulus's clothes had changed so that he was now wearing a black, button down shirt with the sleeves rolled up and dark jeans that weren't as loose as the pair before. His feet were now covered in black, dragon-hide boots. His face was now gaunt and sickly looking, almost dead-like. The main difference though, was that he was now drenched completely in water. His wet hair was plastered to his forehead and he didn't look as peaceful as he had before, he just looked dead.</p><p>"Was that how he looked when he died?" Mrs. Weasley whispered, as if she was afraid to ask.</p><p>"I'm afraid so Molly," Dumbledore confirmed everyone's suspicions.</p><p>"Then how the heck did he die?" Sirius breathed. "That certainly wasn't done by the killing curse."</p><p>"Judging by the amount of water, I'd say he was drowned," Dumbledore deducted reasonably.</p><p>"Drowning doesn't exactly seem like Voldemort's style," Remus's words caused some in the room to flinch.</p><p>"No, it doesn't," Dumbledore agreed, "but as Fate said, there is more to Sirius's brother than meets the eye."</p><p>"Who was Fate?" Harry finally spoke.</p><p>"Exactly who she said she was, Fate," Dumbledore said simply.</p><p>"Fate. As in destiny?" Bill questioned.</p><p>"Yes, precisely," Dumbledore's eyes twinkled.</p><p>"Why would Fate want to bring as the body of some Death Eater?" Mad Eye said gruffly. Sirius's eyes turned angry at this statement, but he didn't say anything.</p><p>"Weren't you listening?" Dumbledore said. "He knows something that can help us. Only, we can't ask him, he must tell us."</p><p>"Tell us? Tell us how?!" George's eyes were wide. "He's dead!"</p><p>Then, something extremely weird happened. Extremely. Regulus's body began to lift off the floor with...well, with nothing helping it. He stopped moving when only the tip of his head and his feet were brushing the floor. His mouth parted slightly and sucked in air. As in he breathed. A dead person breathed! His body hit the floor with everyone's mouths' round in shock.</p><p>Then he moved. He freakin' moved! Regulus rolled over onto his hands and knees and started hacking up water. No one did anything, no one dared. Regulus was too busy spewing water all over the wooden floor to notice them. When he'd finished emptying the contents of his stomach onto the floor, Regulus rolled over once again, this time curling in on himself. His eyes were shut tight in pain and his breath came out ragged and erratic. Everyone just kind of stood there awkwardly, pointing their wands at him.</p><p>When Regulus had finally calmed down and seemed to be in less pain he slowly brought himself to his knees with his head bowed. He lifted his hands up to see them, his eyes filled with shock and disbelief. He moved his fingers one at a time and he tested out his wrists, twisting his hands this way and that.</p><p>"This...this isn't right," he managed to say hoarsely. It was like he hadn't used his voice in years, which he hadn't. "I'm...I'm not supposed to be alive."</p><p>It was then that he looked up to find a wand pointed directly between his eyes. Regulus raised his hands in the universal "I-mean-no-harm" gesture.</p><p>"Um...hi?" he said sheepishly.</p>
