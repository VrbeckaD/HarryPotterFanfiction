          <div class="userstuff"><p>Harry Potter took a deep breath. He was ready. The dementors were coming--maybe not right away, but still, he had to be prepared. So before he could hesitate anymore, he said it: </p><p>"Expecto Patronum!"</p><p>Something silvery did come out of his wand. For a second, Harry didn't realize something was even wrong. But then he narrowed his eyes.</p><p>"...sup."</p><p>"Wait, Ron?" Harry's eyebrows shot up. "I thought my patronus was a deer!" Or a stag, to be more specific. </p><p>"Well, you know what they say," the silvery patronus version of Ron said cheekily. "You can't spell 'patronus' without 'Ron'."</p><p>That...was a terrible joke. Harry didn't even know what was happening. So it was just as terrible that he actually laughed at this.</p></div>
