    <p>Hermione was having a pretty decent summer. It wasn’t the best summer ever – that was fourth year, when it had been such a bloody <em>relief </em>to get away from Harry’s pale face and the whispering muttering worried atmosphere of the school – but it definitely wasn’t the worst either (second year, when she’d been afraid to go to sleep for months after the incident with the basilisk, and had spent the holidays pale and wan and tired in her room.)</p>
<p>No, the summer after fifth year was decent, despite Sirius and the lingering ache from her scar, and the occasional screaming nightmare where she was <em>convinced </em>that her ribcage was still gaping open like an anatomy display. Her mum was doing her usual hinting about how much the family would adore it if she would come home to stay after Hogwarts. The family needed her, Mum said. Think of all the research that was waiting for her – all the research only Hermione could do! Hermione had politely declined and mentioned that she hoped to win an apprenticeship, and had continued to politely decline for the next three weeks. The family could have her over the summer, and over weekends during her apprenticeship, but she was going to learn everything she possibly could in the outside world before burying herself in the family’s neverending research, and hadn’t the Pater approved this plan? It took several pointed hints about the Aunties overstepping in their eagerness to have her home for good to make her mother back off, but this was par for the course. All in all, quite ordinary.</p>
<p>However.</p>
<p>There was <em>something</em>. She wasn’t exactly sure what that <em>something </em>was, but…was the news a little more violent every day? How many mysterious and vicious attacks could there really be over a single summer? It got so bad that on the second Wednesday of the holiday, she took the train to London and the Tube as close to Grimmauld Place as she could get, her backpack full of newspapers. Her da had pulled a few strings when she’d expressed concern, and had presented her with a file full of autopsy reports. He didn’t tell her where he’d gotten them, and she didn’t ask.</p>
<p>Number Twelve appeared between Eleven and Thirteen and she stepped inside, glancing about at the entry hall as she entered. The house was silent. Was Number Twelve even the headquarters of the Order anymore? She despised the secrecy that kept the members of the Order – and those who were not members, but should be, like her and Harry and Ron – fumbling in the dark day after day, not knowing what was happening and just doing the best they could. The signs of recent occupation – a book here, the remains of breakfast in the kitchen, a cloak hung over the back of a chair – reassured her that at least she was in the right place. Probably.</p>
<p>She eventually found signs of life in the library. Professor Snape had his boots on an antique Black coffee table and appeared to be engrossed in a book. He lowered the book as she stepped into the room, raising an eyebrow at her. Hermione fought the urge to step back into the shadows of the hallway. The Professor had always been less grumpy with her when she wasn’t around the boys, but that didn’t mean that he wasn’t grumpy at all, and Hermione was a little too stressed what with the cannibals and everything, to feel entirely secure dealing with a grumpy Potions Master as well.</p>
<p>“Miss Granger,” he said. “I was not aware that you were expected.”</p>
<p>“I’m not – I mean, I wasn’t expected, sir. But I need to-“</p>
<p>He regarded her silently, raising an eyebrow, and Hermione screwed her courage to the sticking place and went for it.</p>
<p>“Sir, has <em>he</em> been up to anything specific regarding Muggles lately?”</p>
<p>Professor Snape shot to his feet, glaring at her, and Hermione rushed to explain.</p>
<p>“I don’t – I’m sorry if I’ve offended you, sir,” she said carefully. “It’s just that there seems to be something very strange going on, and if it’s <em>him </em>and the Order is aware of it I’d quite like to be able to reassure my parents.”</p>
<p>“Explain,” he snarled, looking down his long nose at her. Hermione sucked in a deep breath, unhitched the backpack, and knelt by the coffee table. After a long moment, Professor Snape sat down, still glaring.</p>
<p>“It started small, sir,” she said, dragging out the folder. “An attack here and there – one, maybe two people. They go berserk, and attack. See?” She pointed out the first report she’d noticed, from a few weeks before she’d come home. “And then…” she flipped forward to the article about the crazed mob of twelve individuals who had broken into an old folks’ home – literally broken, the police said the attackers had beaten down the doors and climbed straight through the windows – in Sussex. The old people had been <em>eaten</em>, the report didn’t say (but her mother’s friends <em>did </em>say, and of the two, Hermione knew who she believed).</p>
<p>Professor Snape took the page from her and sat back, reading it with a ferocious scowl on his face.</p>
<p>“You have more,” he said flatly. “Give it here.”</p>
<p>She handed him the folder of autopsy reports and watched him flip through them, his long thin fingers flicking quickly from page to page. When he was done, he looked up at her.</p>
<p>“This is not the Dark Lord’s work,” he said, and shot to his feet to pace in front of the fireplace. Hermione stayed where she was, watching him.</p>
<p>“Are you sure, sir?”</p>
<p>He waved a hand dismissively.</p>
<p>“It’s not his…style, Miss Granger. Believe me, if this had been his work, I would have known about it. He would have been unable to refrain from shouting it from the rooftops. Summarise the rest of your folder, if you will. Do the Muggle authorities have an explanation?”</p>
<p>Hermione shrugged and gave him a brief summary of her data. It wasn’t all that much, to be honest. The perpetrators seemed to be almost impervious to physical pain, and attacked without discrimination. No weapons, but they almost always tried to bite – they never hit, and they seemed to be uncoordinated, but their grip, according to a police officer who’d managed to dislodge (and accidentally kill, but the reports all agreed that it was most definitely self-defence) an attacker by bashing him over the head with a section of pipe, was immensely strong.</p>
<p>“The police at the scene told the media it’s probably rabies, but Mum says really they don’t have a fucking clue, and Dad says everyone’s running around like headless chickens.”</p>
<p>“Language, Miss Granger,” Professor Snape murmured, but he looked amused, so Hermione continued.</p>
<p>“When it started it was one attack a week but now it’s almost daily, and the numbers are getting larger. I thought perhaps Inferi, but the autopsy results…Dad says they’re looking to get him a specimen to examine, probably this week sometime. If it’s magical I want to warn him beforehand, but if it’s not, he’ll have more information for me then.” She looked up from her files to find Professor Snape watching her, a strange expression on his face. “If it’s not…the Dark Lord, sir, I don’t know what it is.”</p>
<p>“We have ruled out the Dark Lord,” he said firmly. “I wouldn’t put something like this past Bellatrix, if she had the skill. Sadly, Azkaban has not done wonders for her magical prowess. No, Miss Granger, you are looking for the enemy in the wrong place.”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir,” Hermione said. “Could you look into it, sir? The <em>Prophet </em>isn’t exactly reliable, and I don’t know if any wizarding communities have been affected by this…whatever it is.”</p>
<p>He inclined his head.</p>
<p>“And you will persuade your father to allow me to attend the examination.”</p>
<p>Hermione sat up straight.</p>
<p>“I think I can do that, sir,” she said. “I can reassure my father you won’t fry his equipment, right? Only most wizards…”</p>
<p>Professor Snape sneered impressively.</p>
<p>“I am not a Weasley, Miss Granger,” he said. “I am fully capable of controlling my magic enough to coexist with electronics. Now get out. Leave the files.”</p>
<p>Hermione stacked the files on the coffee table, rifled through her backpack for enough change for the fare home, and smiled up at him.</p>
<p>“Thank you for taking me seriously, sir,” she said. “I’ll let you know about the examination.”</p>
<p>She was almost at the door of the library when he spoke again.</p>
<p>“Granger. Stop.”</p>
<p>She turned, to find him on his feet again.</p>
<p>“How are you getting home?”</p>
<p>“Tube, sir, then train. I don’t have my Apparition license yet.”</p>
<p>Hermione was surprised to see the professor pinch the bridge of his nose and mutter something that sounded suspiciously like ‘give me strength’. Less surprised when he glared at her ferociously. This was clearly Glare No.18 – Why Am I Surrounded By Idiots.</p>
<p>“You mean to tell me that you’ve been wandering around on <em>your own</em>? You stupid, stupid girl! Have you no-“</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, sir,” she interrupted as quietly, but firmly as she could, and was mildly amused when he fell silent, apparently from pure shock – she didn’t imagine many people dared to interrupt him. “I thought it was important. <em>You </em>clearly think it’s important. I don’t have an owl, I can’t apparate, and I couldn’t send a Patronus from a Muggle residence. How would you like me to have made the Order aware of the situation?”</p>
<p>Ah, and there it was, Filthy Look No.10 – You Have A Point But I’ll Be Buggered Before I Admit It.</p>
<p>“I’ll apparate you home, Miss Granger. Come here.”</p>
<p>He held out his arm in a strangely courtly gesture, and Hermione laid her hand on top of it.</p>
<p>“Hold on,” he said, and she clenched her hand in his sleeve and then the swirling vortex of apparition took her. A moment later they were somewhere else and Hermione staggered to her knees, fighting the urge to throw up.</p>
<p>“Ugh, side-along is <em>awful</em>,” she muttered, and looked up. They were standing in her parents’ back garden, Professor Snape looking singularly out of place against her mother’s bright flowerbeds. Her mother finished pulling a weed and stood, cocking her head at Hermione.</p>
<p>“I thought you were taking the train back, darling,” she said.</p>
<p>“Professor Snape thought it would be safer to apparate,” Hermione said. “Professor, this is my mother, Jean. Mum, this is Professor Snape from Hogwarts. I’ve let him have a look at the file – he says it’s not the Dark Lord. He’d like to go with Daddy to look at the specimen when it comes in.”</p>
<p>Hermione’s mother tilted her head and eyed Professor Snape curiously. He stood statue-still, returning her gaze. Hermione felt, for a moment, as though a tumbleweed was about to blow through the pretty little suburban garden.</p>
<p>Then her mum smiled, pulled off the glove, and offered Professor Snape her hand with an impish grin.</p>
<p>“We’ve heard a lot about you, Professor, and it’s a pleasure to meet you.”</p>
<p>Professor Snape shook her hand and looked impassive, but nodded when she asked if he’d like a cuppa, since Hermione’s dad would be home shortly.</p>
<p>“I’ll get it,” Hermione said, and led the way into the kitchen.</p>
<p>“So, Professor,” Jean Granger said as Hermione put the kettle on. “I have to ask. Do you think them up beforehand, or are your insults spontaneous? Roger and I have been debating about this since Hermione sent home her first letter from Hogwarts, and-“</p>
<p>“Mum!” Hermione exclaimed, turning around with a mug in each hand. Her mother laughed and flapped a hand, while Professor Snape eyed them both incredulously.</p>
<p>“Excuse me?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Oh, Hermione sends us a sort of Best of Professor Snape every week. It’s our favourite part of her letters, to be honest – can’t comment much about Arithmancy and my opinion of those friends of hers really can’t be shared in polite society, but I’ve always enjoyed a good insult and you, sir, are a master.”</p>
<p>Hermione decided that discretion was the better part of valour and turned away to hide her flaming face, busying herself with the tea things.</p>
<p>“You don’t like Potter and Weasley?” Professor Snape asked after a long silence.</p>
<p>“Well, young Harry sounds like a nice enough boy,” Jean said, “but I’m afraid the shine rather went off them for me after the whole thing with the rats and the brooms.”</p>
<p>“That would have been…third year, I think?” Professor Snape asked. “When Potter was sent the Firebolt and she insisted on having it checked.” He chuckled. “I remember the incident, Professor McGonagall was thoroughly impressed with your daughter’s good sense. And the rat…Miss Granger, what was the story about the rat? I’m afraid staff room gossip never did quite clarify the situation.”</p>
<p>Hermione found the situation entirely surreal. Professor Snape was in her kitchen, politely making conversation with her mum.</p>
<p>“My cat tried to eat Ron’s rat,” she said as she set their tea in front of them. “Of course, Ron’s rat turned out to be that odious little twerp Wormtail, so it would have been better if Crooks <em>had </em>eaten him, but he hadn’t.”</p>
<p>“A cat of good sense, then, and do inform your cat that he has my blessing to eat Wormtail if he comes across him again.” Professor Snape said, and smirked. A moment later the front door opened, and Hermione’s dad came in, smiling at everyone.</p>
<p>Introductions were made, as was more tea, and a few minutes later Roger Granger was seated at the table too, looking curiously at Professor Snape.</p>
<p>“Your daughter brought me some interesting information today, Mr. Granger,” Professor Snape said. “She also mentioned that you might be able to obtain a specimen. Would it be possible to be present at the examination?”</p>
<p>“She thought it might be something to do with your lot,” Hermione’s dad said. “I was going to have her come in and see if she could figure out anything, but if you’re willing, I’d be delighted!”</p>
<p>“I can still come, though, right, Daddy?” Hermione asked urgently, and her father took a slow sip of his tea.</p>
<p>“I’ve already told the Aunties you’d be there, Hermione. I’m reasonably sure that if I show up without you they’d have me actually shot. Now, Professor Snape, we’re expecting the specimen to be delivered tonight. Would tomorrow morning be convenient for you?”</p>
<p>The professor agreed, times were set, and then he insisted that Hermione walk him out. Once they were out of earshot of her parents, Professor Snape fixed Hermione with a scowl.</p>
<p>“I distinctly remember Professor McGonagall telling the staff room that your parents are <em>dentists</em>, Miss Granger. Those people are <em>not </em>dentists.”</p>
<p>“Well, no,” Hermione said, and scratched at the back of her neck. “Not so much with the dentistry. But dentistry is common and boring to Muggles, and wizards don’t care about Muggle things, so nobody asks too many questions if you say your parents are dentists. Try telling people at school your parents are part of an ancient secret society, though, and the questions never stop. So you can see why we went with dentistry.”</p>
<p>His eyebrows were nearly at his hairline, and Hermione scuffed the dirt with the toe of her trainer. She felt twelve years old again under that obsidian glare.</p>
<p>“Look, it’s not…we’re not like, the Illuminati or Muggle Death Eaters or anything like that. We just…take care of things. We don’t even have a name, not really. Mostly we do research and development. Intelligence work. Things like that. You could ask Headmaster Black’s portrait about my great-aunt Sabine, if you like. They apparently worked together for a bit although my great-grandmother was convinced that they had a torrid affair.”</p>
<p>Whether his incredulous look was due to the thought of her family’s extracurricular activities or the idea of Phineas Nigellus Black having a <em>torrid affair</em> with anyone, let alone a Muggle, Hermione couldn’t have said. After a moment, though, he gave her a short nod and apparated away.</p>
<p>Hermione trudged back inside to find her parents bickering over dinner. Her mother wordlessly shoved a pile of carrots at her, and Hermione began to peel.</p>
<p>“Observant man, your professor,” her dad said mildly. “Seems nice enough though.”</p>
<p>“Well, he is a spy,” her mum said. “Stands to reason you’d have to be pretty observant to be a spy. He’s quite concerned about this…phenomenon, isn’t he?”</p>
<p>Hermione nodded.</p>
<p>“He didn’t say in so many words but if he’s willing to come to the examination tomorrow morning, he’s quite concerned. Word is that with Malfoy imprisoned, he’s the Dark Lord’s new right-hand man,” Hermione said. “I don’t think he has a lot of free time. Ginny said Fleur said he’s got Wormtail living with him too, so getting away isn’t exactly easy.”</p>
<p>“Wormtail is the one who used to be your friend’s rat?” her dad asked, and Hermione nodded. “And your Professor Snape is working with him for this Dark Lord fellow? Hermione darling, you know we’ve always trusted your judgement, but are you sure we should be sharing all this information with him? You know we’re going to have to show him the Hive tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“I trust Professor Snape, Dad,” she said firmly. “He put himself between me and a <em>werewolf</em>. Plus, he saved my life at the end of term. If it hadn’t been for him knowing how to counter that purple hex, I’d be <em>dead</em> now. Plus he’s an expert in the Dark Arts. If what we’re dealing with is magical at all, Professor Snape will be able to tell.”</p>
<p>“You know the man better than we do, of course,” her mum said with a shrug. “Now come over here and stir for me, there’s a girl.”</p>
<p>Xxxx</p>
<p>Severus Snape apparated into the library at Grimmauld with a pensive expression on his face. After a long moment, he strolled into the hallway and poked the portrait of Headmaster Black.</p>
<p>The old man sat up straight and glared at him, and Severus smirked.</p>
<p>“A word, Headmaster Black?” he asked mildly. The old man nodded and disappeared, presumably into a portrait in the library – which was indeed where Severus found him.</p>
<p>“And how can I help you, Snape?”</p>
<p>Severus turned an armchair to face the portrait, sat down, and steepled his fingers. He was striving to present an unaffected façade, instead of the burning curiosity that had been his downfall all his life. The late Headmaster was eyeing him from an armchair in a painting that mirrored the Black library almost exactly, almost giving the impression that they were in the same room.</p>
<p>“I’ve been told,” Severus said, with a curl of his lip to emphasize how fond he was of being ordered about, “to ask you about someone named Sabine. A Muggle, I believe. You would have worked with her at one point, and apparently her sister was convinced that there was…something more?”</p>
<p>Black seemed to flinch at the name, and eyed Severus closely.</p>
<p>“You’re talking about Sabine Granger, aren’t you,” the portrait said flatly. “How did you come to hear of her?”</p>
<p>“I believe I am, yes. Apparently the young Muggleborn girl you may have seen fluttering about here is a relative of hers.” Severus sat back and watched the portrait process this.</p>
<p>“Not the Gryffindor?” He made a horrified face. “My word, Sabine would have had a fit, to think of one of her relatives in that benighted house. The whole family was made for Ravenclaw, of course, or they would have been if they hadn’t been Muggles. Ravenclaw down to the bone, always wanting to know things. How it worked, why it worked, what it was. Mad for knowledge, they all were. Yes, I worked with Sabine for a time, before I became Headmaster. The wards on their home needed recasting-“</p>
<p>“Forgive the interruption, Headmaster,” Severus said, sitting forward intently. “The wards? I was under the impression that the family was Muggle…”</p>
<p>Black waved a hand as if to dismiss the concern.</p>
<p>“For a given value of ‘Muggle,’ certainly, Snape. However, there has been…shall we say, a history of cooperation? Between certain parts of the wizarding world and the House of Granger for centuries. It was a Granger who wrote the Statute of Secrecy, not that you’d know it from the history books. Sabine approached me on behalf of her family when the wards began to fail. Called in an old debt, as it were. We may have forgotten House Granger, Snape, but they most certainly have not forgotten <em>us</em>.” Headmaster Black settled back in his armchair, smiling almost pleasantly. “So they’ve finally thrown a witch, have they?” he said. “The family must have been delighted when she started to show magical potential.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“Well, they’ve always wanted magic, of course,” Black said idly. “Not enough to allow a wizard in their gene pool if he wasn’t ‘properly qualified’, naturally – wouldn’t do to have substandard Grangers with magic running about. I wonder if they found a wizard bright enough to satisfy the aunts, or if the girl is an anomaly.”</p>
<p>The old man eyed Severus speculatively, and snorted.</p>
<p>“If I were you, young man, I’d keep a lid on that brain of yours around the Grangers, or the Aunties will have you matched up in half a heartbeat.”</p>
<p>Severus felt his eyebrows crawling up his forehead.</p>
<p>“I <em>beg </em>your pardon?” he managed, eventually.</p>
<p>“They breed for brains, of course,” Black said, waving a hand as though it should have been obvious. “A thousand years, they’ve been at it, and I daresay it’s worked, if what I’ve heard about the little Mudblood’s even half true. Sabine would have had me – nine NEWTs, I definitely qualified – but the Aunties nixed it. Apparently the Black line has a history of instability and they didn’t want to risk it.”</p>
<p>Severus sat back in his chair, eyeing the portrait, and finally gave a small smirk. The portrait scowled.</p>
<p>“Yes, yes, you don’t need to rub it in, Snape – between dear Bellatrix and that good-for-nothing great-grandson of mine, it certainly looks like we’ve proved the Aunties right.” Black smirked again. “You, on the other hand…your mother was a Prince, wasn’t she? Clever family, the Princes. Not much in the looks department, but you can’t have everything. But sane, they say. No mad uncles in <em>that </em>family.”</p>
<p>Severus shot to his feet, feeling his face contort into his most vicious scowl.</p>
<p>“Enough,” he snapped. “I thank you for your time, Headmaster, but I’m afraid I must be going.”</p>
<p>He made it halfway to the door before Black called out.</p>
<p>“You’re going to the Hive, then?” he asked. Severus turned and raised an eyebrow, and Black leaned forward in the armchair. “The Granger place.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps,” Severus replied. “Miss Granger’s father has been kind enough to allow me access to a unique specimen he’s acquired.”</p>
<p>“Take me with you,” Black said eagerly. “There’s a pocket-watch with an empty frame in the compartment behind my portrait. Take it, and I’ll be able to accompany you.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“Why would you, or why would I want to?”</p>
<p>“Either,” Severus said. “Or both.”</p>
<p>“I haven’t been there in eighty years. I’d like to see the place again.” Black eyed Severus carefully, and sighed. “I’m bored, damn it! Between Albus’ office and this dump, I haven’t been anywhere interesting since I died. You’re going to the Hive, and I’m bored, so why not?”</p>
<p>Severus narrowed his eyes at the late headmaster.</p>
<p>“Black, your attempts at spying are as pathetic as a Gryffindor’s. If Albus wanted to know about this matter, he would know already.”</p>
<p>“It’s not for Albus,” Black said, frowning. “<em>This </em>portrait isn’t bound to the Headmaster’s oath, you know. As long as I’m in this frame – or indeed any frame not in that damn office – I am not bound to obey the headmaster’s whims. I’m telling you, Snape, this is purely to relieve my boredom.”</p>
<p>Severus sighed. It wasn’t as though he didn’t understand the concept of boredom, it was just that he had very little personal experience with the phenomenon.</p>
<p>“Yes, yes fine, Black, I’ll drag you along. I’m warning you though – one comment about Mudbloods and I’m chucking you in the Thames and we’ll see how bored you get watching boat bottoms go by.”</p>
<p>The old man grinned and strolled out of his portrait. Severus made sure to find the pocket watch before Apparating away from Number Twelve and back to Spinner’s End, where he amused himself by tormenting Wormtail until bedtime.</p>
