    <p>You're extremely beautiful, but to Thor the color you love wear isn't. He admired lots of things about you like your exoticness compared to Asgardian women. To start off you were a bit on the shorter side which was extremely undesirable in a wife to the men of Asgard, but your height was forgotten because you were effortlessly charming and have a lovely voice. It's a shade a green that was only a couple of shades off to Loki's green. The two of you looked like you belong together.</p><p>For a long time Thor meant to take you from Loki. It wasn't anything he hadn't done before, he always made a point to charm girls who even shows the slightest interest in his younger brother. However, you proved you were immune to his charms unlike his lack of immunity to yours. Sometimes you would laugh and call him silly and other times you would call him your brother which made a part of him burn for some reason. </p><p>Thor remembered the day that you cried into your hands and told Loki that you were a monster after he himself had discovered his true origins. He remembers the death drop his stomach did when he saw your skin turn blue and your eyes wash over red. He remember how Loki let his Jotunn form takeover and how he kissed you softly and told you that he loved you. It was then Thor knew he had no chance.</p><p>After you married Loki the people of Asgard called you Sigyn. They loved you and treated you like their queen which Thor lacked. For a thousand years you and Loki lives happily, but Thor did not. Jane had died what seemed like eons ago after falling in love with another mortal and living a happy life, not that Thor cared. The only thing he cared for was for you and had found himself shaping into something ugly. Now he had come up with his most wicked plan yet. He would banish Loki and take you for himself, to him Loki was forcing you to be his wife. In his mind you loved him and not your husband. To Thor Loki was abusing you and that's why after a thousand years of marriage you still didn't have any children. </p><p>- </p><p>You sobbed as Thor dragged Loki's limp form toward the bifrost. After fighting and destroying a fourth of Asgard Thor finally got the best of Loki. You had no idea whether your love was alive or not. </p><p>"Please stop, please don't kill him," you cry as you run to keep up with Thor. You grab his arm and dig your nails into his arms and willed them to become claws, but you had no energy what-so-ever from shielding civilians in the line of fire. Thor pushes you to the ground and keeps walking. </p><p>"Stay back, fair maiden. This man is dangerous," Thor says in his best hero voice. Anger wells up inside you. </p><p>"He's my husband, he's never hurt me," you shout at him and pick yourself up. Heimdall stands stoically at the bifrost, he obviously disturbed by the sight of Loki so near to death seeing that he had made a bit of trouble for anyone in over a thousand years. Thor drips Loki like a sack of potatoes and you rush to him and stoop down on the ground. You cup his face, it's strange and you realize that his jaw is most like broken or dislocated. You pop it back in place, thankfully it's only dislocated. It wakes him up. </p><p>"Darling, don't strain yourself. Save your strength," Loki says, he's trying to keep the discomfort from all the bruises and broken bones he's sustained and blood loss. </p><p>"No, you can't die," you say as you start crying againÂ  and try to heal him. You feel Thor grab onto your hair and yank you back. You and Loki both let out a cry. </p><p>"I said stay back," Thor yells at you as your sobbing continues. Loki is completely defenseless against Thor, his magic was drained and both his legs were broken. </p><p>"I hate you," you shout fiercely at Thor after he turns his back. He turns and looks at you, his anger sits on his face clear as day. </p><p>"No, you love me," he tells you. He moves quickly and grabs you and tries to force his lips onto your yours. He's not so pleased when you bite him as hard as you can. </p><p>"I don't love you and I never will," you tell him and you unsheath one of his daggers and bury it in his torso without a single thought. He's shocked and looks at you like his one true love betrayed him. He staggers backwards and you follow and bury dagger after dagger inside of his until he collapses against the bifrost. Heimdall is gone. </p><p>"Y/N," Thor says in a heartbroken voice, you put your hand on his chest and stared using his the last of his life force to replenish your powers. The last thing Thor sees his your face twisted in anger and he finally understood. You stare at his unseeing eyes for a moment before you turn your attention to Loki. You heal him as best you can. The only things you couldn't heal until your power was used up was bruises and cut along his body, but all rupture organs and broken and dislocated bones had been restored to its rightful order. You're so tired that you lay there beside Loki. Loki takes you in his sore and bruised arms. You ask him one question before you drift off to sleep. </p><p>"How did this happen?" </p><p>-</p><p>A short while later Thor's body was burned on a boat like the tradition called for. The mourning was short because Heimdall made it a point to tarnish Thor's name for some reason. You and Loki were coronated as king and queen of Asgard and a little while later you gave birth to a daughter named Frigg.</p>
