    <p>Unphased by the smoke-tinted windows and flickering neon signs advertising local beer brands, I opened the door to The Smoking Cauldron and heard the familiar chime ring to announce my entrance.</p><p>I paused inside the doorway to let my eyes adjust to the dim light, since the only lights in the bar were the paper lantern covered bulbs hanging from the ceiling and the old fairy lights attached to the top of each window, and I had come from outside where the sidewalk was brightly illuminated by the afternoon sun.</p><p>"Hey Tom," I greeted the owner as I casually flashed him my ID.  Tom made a checkmark on the back of my hand with a sharpie to mark that I was of-age as I put my wallet back in the pocket of my bag.  "I’m surprised to see my usual seat by the window taken so early in the evening."</p><p>"Nah, man, it’s not taken.  The dude sitting there is our new hire," Tom answered.  "He's just finishing up paperwork.  Come say hi!"</p><p>I, for better or for worse, came to the local hookah bar often enough where I was more of a staple than their hired help, and I followed Tom over to the table to meet the newest waiter.</p><p>"Sirius," Tom nodded in the direction of the new-hire, "this is Remus, one of our regulars.  Remus, this is our new waiter, Sirius.  Tonight's his first night, so let me know if he fucks up!"  Tom nudged Sirius playfully in the ribs.  "Remus is a good dude and he'll be patient with you while you're learning."</p><p>"Hey," Sirius said as he looked up from his paperwork and flashed me a smile.  "I'll get out of your table in one second."  He turned to Tom and added, "I think I finished this paperwork.  I'll bring in a copy of my Social Security card tomorrow and then we should be all set!"  </p><p>"Sweet," Tom responded, picking the papers up off of the table.  "Well, for tonight you'll be shadowing me, so prepare to learn from the best, as our friend Remus can attest to."</p><p>I nodded earnestly.  Not only was Tom a good waiter, but he was a genuinely good dude, too.</p><p>Tom turned to Sirius.  "So, first off, introduce yourself.  It may seem silly since I already introduced you to Remus, but you gotta get in the habit of it."</p><p>Sirius paused awkwardly before stating, "Hi, I'm Sirius."</p><p>"Hello, Sirius," I responded with a small smile.  "Can I have some lemon tea?"</p><p>"See, he's a good sport!" Tom said to Sirius, clapping him on the shoulder.  "Although next time, make sure you tell the table you''ll be their waiter.  For all Remus knows, you could be some random dude who just wanted to share his name.  Lord knows Remus gets hit on all the time here."</p><p>"Har, har," I said dryly.  "I'm just the awkward person who comes in here to grade papers far too often and sits in the corner silently watching everyone."</p><p>"The way you say that makes you sound like a pervy old man!" Tom joked.  "Come on, Sirius, I'll show you how we make tea here.  We'll be back with that and your usual hookah, Remus."</p><p>I nodded and settled into my seat.  I was going to be here a while.  My students had recently written a short-essay on the prompt, "In ten years, I'll be..." and they had gotten really into it.  It was great from an educational engagement perspective, but not so great from a grading perspective.  Since it was only the second week of school, I wanted to give the kids a lot of feedback, especially on an assignment so personal to them.  Plus, it was way too early in September for me to get behind on grading already.  </p><p>I pulled the first class of assignments out of my backpack when Sirius returned to the table carrying the hookah. </p><p>"Tom will be out in a second with the tea," he said as he set the hookah on the table.  "Thanks again for putting up with me being new here."</p><p>"No problem," I replied.  "It may be cliche, but everyone was new at something at one point."</p><p>Sirius smiled as he clumsily unwrapped the hose and the mouthpiece from the body of the hookah and placed it on the table.  To his credit, he appeared confident in spite of not quite knowing what he was doing.</p><p>He was getting ready to use tongs to take the coal out of the pan and put it on the foil when I decided to try to put him at ease.  "So, Sirius," I started.  "That's an unusual name."      </p><p>Great job, I thought to myself.  Not only is that a killer conversation starter, but it jumps right into a conversation I probably don't want to have right now.</p><p>"Yeah, my parents were hippies or something like that in the 60's, before the world made them cynical," Sirius responded, proudly balancing the coal on the foil.  "They named me after a star."</p><p>"Nice!" I responded, glad the hookah was all assembled and burning without a catastrophe.  "The hippie counter-culture is one of the subjects my kids love to learn about the most."</p><p>"You teach?" Sirius asked, nodding at the stack of papers in front of me.</p><p>"He sure does!" Tom answered for me, coming out from the kitchen through a bead curtain with my tea.  "It's fun because sometimes his kids will write hilariously wrong answers and he'll share them with us.  I’ve missed that over the past few summer months when you haven’t had students!"</p><p>"Tom," I shushed him, blushing slightly.  "I really shouldn't share them with you guys."</p><p>"Oh stop, Remus," Tom answered.  "You know as well as I do that we aren't going to rat you out for sharing your kids work.  Besides, you never tell us their names and I don't even know any high school kids.  Do you, Sirius?"</p><p>"Nah," responded Sirius.  "My mom was a teacher and she used to come home with some great stories about her elementary school kids.  I can imagine high schoolers give you some even crazier stories!”</p><p>"Yeah, well, you can ask him about his students later," Tom cut in with a grin.  "I've got to show you some stuff behind the bar before we get too many customers in here."</p><p>I watched them walk away as I inhaled on my hookah.  Tom wasn't too spectacular to look at, in all honestly.  A plain, average height, slightly chubby, thirty something, Tom was a career waiter by choice.  He liked working with people and he liked the variety of customers the hookah bar provided for him, from the old-school traditional Indian smokers to the young-twenties crowd who were excited to try something for the first time.  </p><p>Sirius, on the other hand, was nothing short of gorgeous.  He was slim but muscular, in his mid-twenties, with black hair that he wore pulled back into a short pony tail.  He was only slightly shorter than me--which at my six-foot-two meant he was still pretty tall, and dressed in all black.  But what initially caught my attention was his eyes--steel gray, but warm and expressive, especially when he smiled.  What kept me looking was his tattoos.  First, he was clearly covered in them and they poked out of the ends of his sleeves and the collar of his shirt.  Second, they weren't the usual tattoo designs, which I noticed as his shirt moved as he reached above the bar to grab a bottle.  He had what looked to be a hand of cards tattooed on his side, but the suit wasn't a normal one.  It was either dogs or bears, I couldn't quite tell from this far away.</p><p>"Mrmp," I muttered out loud, pulling myself out of my staring and focusing on my stack of papers.  "I need to get work done."</p><p>With that, I started reading my student's essays.  The more I read, the more I was glad I gave this assignment.  As a present-day history teacher, giving the students abstract assignments was more of a personal preference of mine than it was a curriculum requirement.  I liked to see how the student's view themselves, their world, and their future.  It gives them a good, concrete angle to view historical figures from.  After all, half the fun of history is speculating what different people were actually thinking at the time important events occurred.  Whether it's wondering what LBJ really thought during the anti-Vietnam War protests or who thought it would be a good idea to, once again,  invade Russia during the winter, putting names and faces to events makes them more intriguing and, at least to my history-loving self, more enjoyable.</p><p>Slowly the bar filled up, which wasn't surprising for a Thursday night.  What I did find surprising, as I scanned the room during my grading breaks, was that Sirius seemed a lot more comfortable with every other customer, but still seemed nervous around me.  He made a show to appear confident, but it wasn’t quite believable.  Maybe that was because I was his first table, or maybe I was reading too much into his actions.  </p><p>You never forget your first, I joked to myself.  </p><p>"Oh my god, I am such an old man for only being 28-years-old," I groaned out loud.</p><p>With that, I paid my tab and left early--a fitting ending to the night for an old man.</p>
