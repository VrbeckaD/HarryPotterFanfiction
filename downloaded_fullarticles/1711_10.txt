          <div class="userstuff"><p>2015</p><p>J. H. Wringlo is an author, he wrote a very successful story about a boy wizard named, yes, that’s right, Harry Potter. He wrote a story that changed the Muggle literacy world, made him the most known author all over the world. There wasn't a person alive who hadn't heard of Harry Potter, even if they had never read the books, they had still heard of him.</p><p> </p><p>21st July 2015 and J. H. Wringlo was waiting behind the curtains a bag of nerves waiting to do a reading of his seventh and last book. And he couldn't help but think of the night he decided that he would write these books and the reaction of his friends when they told him and a smile appeared at the thought of where he is and think ‘<em>ha! Look at me now.’ </em></p><p> 2000</p><p> </p><p>It was the hottest day of the year, the London heatwave setting in at the highest its been for years 36.7oC , the second hottest day ever recorded in England, to be fact. It was the evening of Harry's twentieth birthday meal, and he <em> really </em> wanted to cancel it’s just ‘ <em> too bloody hot to cook and entertain guests’ </em>he thought as beads of sweat washed over his face and neck, but it was too late to cancel. So he dressed in his casual black shorts and lightest white t shirt he could find.</p><p> </p><p>He huffed into the mirror at the thought of the next few hours he will have to endure. Then he saw Ginny enter the room ‘Is that what you’re wearing?’ sounding disapproving.</p><p> </p><p>‘Yes. It’s my birthday, Gin. And I'll wear what I want.’ he replied a bit too sharp than intended. Looking at her through the mirror, that comment had earned him a scowl from Ginny. He signed heavily pinching the bridge of his nose ‘Sorry. It's too hot to get formally dressed up. If I had my way I'd wear nothing.’ in a softer tone with a cheeky wink and a smirk.</p><p> *</p><p>Sitting around the large table poking at his food with a fork and trying to look a tiny bit interested in his dinner. No one was speaking, Hermione was fanning herself, Ginny taking tiny bites of the salad and Ron drinking his ice cold beer. Harry broke that silence and said ‘I'm going to write a story. About Hogwarts and my time there, one book per year.’ Ginny, Ron and Hermione all turned and looked.</p><p> </p><p>Ron laughed and said ‘I think he has heat exhaustion.’</p><p> </p><p>‘What? Where has this suddenly come from? What about Auror training? I thought that was your dream job?’ Ginny questioned. ‘And writing is hard work, and it can take <em> years </em> to do just one book.’</p><p> </p><p>‘Yeah, mate, where’s this come from?’ Ron said raising an inquisitive eyebrow.</p><p> </p><p>‘I don’t know. Just, why not? I've been thinking about it for about a year now. I’ve even started some notes. I mean, how hard can it be? I'll just be writing about my time at school, like an autobiography, sort of.’ Harry replied.</p><p> </p><p>‘But Harry, where are you going to -’ Hermione started before Harry interrupted</p><p> </p><p>‘I'm not going to publish it in the wizarding world. I'm going to write it for the Muggle world’</p><p> </p><p>‘WHAT!’ they all shouted at once.</p><p> </p><p>‘Harry, you’re mad. You can’t do that! You’ll expose our world, don’t be a fool!’ Ginny said</p><p> </p><p>‘They’ll just see it as fiction. They won't know’ Harry argued. ‘It’s not the first time they’ve read about witchcraft. You know that Hermione’ he said nodding at her ‘The Worst Witch, The Lion The Witch and the Wardrobe, Shakespeare.’ he counted on his hand. ‘To them it’ll just be another story about witches and wizards. I’ve even thought of a name J. H. Wringlo, silent W’ he added.</p><p> </p><p>‘Wringlo? What the fuck? What does that mean?’ said Ron</p><p> </p><p>‘I’ve no idea. Just popped into my head, I like it.’ he said as he shrugged his shoulders.</p><p> </p><p>‘Maybe you should have a backup job, Harry. You know, just in case’ Ginny said with concern in her voice</p><p> </p><p>`I already have the title of my first book <em> ‘Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone.’ </em>he smiled</p><p> </p><p>They didn't smile. ‘But Harry, come on, this is ludicrous.’ Hermione said</p><p> </p><p>Harry’s smile faded. ‘You don't think I can do it?’</p><p> </p><p>‘Now, Harry, were not saying that. It's just, well, it's a bit .  . . unrealistic, is all’ Ginny said.</p><p> </p><p>‘Unrealistic?’ he repeated slowly. ‘Yeah, you’re right. What was I thinking?’ as he forced a smile.</p><p> </p><p>‘Come on, mate, let’s abandon this dinner, it's too hot. Lets go and have a cold beer in the front room where it's cooler.’ Ron said as he slapped Harry on the back when he stood up.</p><p><br/>
For the first five years he kept his story very secret. They never knew he was writing his book, until he got a publisher and a date of release. . .then he told them, and their jaws dropped in shock. Harry got a job ‘ <em> just in case </em>’ he worked at Honeydukes. It wasn’t a great paying job, but in reality he didn't need the money, he had all the money he could have from his parents and compensation from the war. He worked to keep himself busy. And when he wasn't working or socialising he was in his study writing.</p><p> </p><p>2015 </p><p> </p><p>Giving Ginny a kiss 'Good luck' she said and he straightened up and blew out a low long breath and walked through the curtains.</p></div>
