    <p>Ron Weasley is twelve when the Wizarding World hails him as a hero. </p>
<p>For the first time in his life he is not overshadowed by his brothers or by his friends. In the hallways people whisper behind his back, raising him up, giving him titles. He’s the Snake Slayer, the Sword Bearer, Slytherin’s Vanquisher and many other things he doesn’t care to know. This fame he always wished to have has cost him much — too much — and now he can’t escape it. </p>
<p>It tastes like ashes in his mouth.</p>
<p>There are always people next to him now; he’s never been more alone.</p>
<p>There’s questions now, everywhere. Since he dragged his numb body into the hospital wing, tired, dirty, bloody and clutching Gryffindor’s sword, there’s been questions. First, the teachers; compassionate blue eyes, shocked lamentations and warm hands on his shoulders. Then, the Aurors; steady, calm, business-like and firm. And then, the others; whispers and gossip, pity and awe, his life an entertaining book or play they watch from a distance for their own amusement. </p>
<p>He can’t look any of them in the eyes. Part of it is shame for his helplessness, part of it anger at their own inaction and some…some of it is fear; fear that they would see the truth in his eyes if they only looked close enough.</p>
<p>Hermione hasn’t woken up yet, a statue in the hospital bed, blessed with the silence of unconsciousness. Perhaps that’s the reason he sits hours by her side, quietly watching, very much aware of the diary hidden among her school books next to the bed. Sometimes he reads to her out of the textbooks — he doesn’t dare touch the diary, of course, and he hasn’t the stomach for any Hogwarts history, so not her favorite history book either — and the words slip out of his mouth without registering in his mind, a background memory as his thoughts twist around, trying to find a way forward.</p>
<p>The auror investigation finishes. Only a few days have passed, though it feels longer to him. The school closes, perhaps forever, at least for a year. Hermione is transferred to Saint Mungo’s, a muggleborn girl, no matter how bright and brilliant is not important at all in the larger scheme of things. The adults have more important things to do, dealing with the fallout. He packs her school books away, slipping the diary into his own pocket. It burns against his side and he has to force himself to not pat it, reassure himself that it’s still there.</p>
<p>Departure day arrives and the school empties, the streams of children like rats leaving a sinking ship. Some go to Hogsmeade, leave with portkeys or the floo. Others board the express perhaps for the last time. </p>
<p>It is the first time that all of his brothers gather in the same room since the news. Percy’s back is ramrod straight, shoulders back, black bags under his eyes. His reign has been tyrannical since the news, no leniency at all. Fred and George are silent, for once, but there is a cruel glint in their eyes now. He knows that more Slytherins ended up in the hospital wing since the news than in all the months put together before. He knows who is responsible. Their jokes are twisted now, malevolent in a way they never have been before. </p>
<p>He can’t bring himself to care. </p>
<p>A better person would.</p>
<p>The empty space between them screams so loudly of her absence that he is glad when his father appears in the headmaster’s office. His mother doesn’t come and he’s glad for it. Silently, Father ushers them through the floo and they’re back home. The twins run up to their room, Percy gives Mother a kiss on the cheek and he, he leaves through the backdoor and into the orchard, sitting down beneath an apple tree. His mother is a shadow of herself; thinner, bleached of color and emotion. He doesn’t want to look at her, fears what would look back.</p>
<p>The days are hot with little rain. He sleeps with the window open. During the night, he hears his parents talking, his mother crying. The twins’ room is ominously silent. He manages to convince Father to let him visit Hermione in Saint Mungo’s if he goes by floo. Her parents aren’t there. He wonders if someone has contacted them at all, wonders if he should send them an owl and let them know. But he’s tired, too tired at the thought of speaking to her parents, meeting them. He doesn’t even know what he’ll tell Hermione when she finally wakes, not to mention her parents. So he doesn’t do anything. He comes every day, though, and sits by her side and thinks. It’s as much to get away from the Burrow as to be near her, the only other one left.</p>
<p>Hermione doesn’t wake for Ginny’s funeral. He would have liked her to be there. </p>
<p>It’s a small, intimate thing, the funeral. Only family is allowed and a few friends. He sees Dumbledore and McGonagall there and doesn’t look at them. The resentment and anger is too great. They didn’t help Ginny, didn’t save her. They were responsible for her, for all of them, and they weren’t there. He ignores their haggard looks, knows in the back of his mind that the whole Wizarding World is after them, needing someone to blame, and looks back down to the ground. </p>
<p>The priest drones on and on. He remembers kissing Ginny’s cold dead cheek down there in the Chamber, his final goodbye and suppresses a shudder.</p>
<p>Hermione doesn’t wake for Harry’s funeral either, and he is glad. </p>
<p>He barely manages to hold onto his temper, not saying a word during the whole thing and staring at the ground. He ignores the Ministry officials, the Minister’s eulogy, ignores the angry words between Hogwarts staff and Ministry, the flashes of cameras. Harry’s body is laid to rest next to his parents’ in Godric’s Hollow and he thinks that that’s the only thing of this funeral that Harry would approve of.</p>
<p>Two weeks later Hermione finally stirs, the potion finished and doing its work. There’s a flurry of activity around her —  healers, aurors, finally her parents. He doesn’t know how she manages to convince her parents to let her visit him, later, but she does. </p>
<p>It is under his apple tree that they sit down and he takes her hand in his, fingers entwining. Her brown eyes have been a dull muddy color since they’ve told her. He doesn’t like it at all. Perhaps that’s why the bluntness that’s always been so much a part of his character finally stirs again with a vengeance after long weeks of dormancy.</p>
<p>“Harry’s not dead,” he whispers, instinctively lowering his voice as his secret of weeks is now set free. It’s been hammering inside his chest, burning in his pocket all this time. </p>
<p>Carefully, oh so carefully, he takes the diary out and puts it on his knee. Sunshine falls upon it and the golden letters shine brightly. T.M.Riddle. But it’s not his anymore. </p>
<p>It’s no abomination. </p>
<p>It’s hope.</p>
<p>Hermione’s fingers tighten painfully around his. He doesn’t flinch. Her eyes sharpen, the muddy brown clearing, mouth in a thin line.</p>
<p>“Tell me.” It could almost be a sigh, but it’s much too forceful for that.</p>
<p>He nods, leans back against the bark of the apple tree, his face only inches away from hers and begins to whisper his story, the air from his words caressing her lips as the forbidden tale escapes him. Of how he managed to enter the Chamber; of how it was too late — Ginny lying on the cold stone floor, Harry’s spirit now trapped in the diary, valiantly standing firm against young Tom Riddle, the Dark Lord Voldemort made flesh again. A situation without hope. Of Harry managing to focus Voldemort’s attention solely on him.</p>
<p>“And then…then I put on the cloak and took Gryffindor’s sword and when His back was turned to me, I rammed it in as far as I could. He died there on that filthy floor.”</p>
<p>“Good riddance.” There is satisfaction in her voice and in her eyes. He feels her words and shivers.</p>
<p>He swallows and licks his dry lips.</p>
<p>“Harry begged me to stab the diary and then, when I hesitated, he begged me to take it to Dumbledore. Hermione,” he breathes, “he was so sure that Dumbledore would do it, would truly kill him. He was so, so certain, Hermione.”</p>
<p>She rests her free hand on the diary, softly, gently. Part of her hand is resting on his knee. It’s warm.</p>
<p>“Harry knows Dumbledore best.” She nods and stares down at the small book. When her head finally lifts, she smiles at him. It’s grim and full of teeth. Her eyes are clear.</p>
<p>It doesn’t need saying.</p>
<p>“We’ll save Harry. We’ll bring him back.” He says it anyway.</p>
<p>“We will.”</p>
