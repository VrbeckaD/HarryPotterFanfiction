<p>Being Decisive</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Hermione crossed her arms. “Yes?” </p>
<p>Ron cleared his throat. “I…erm…was thinking…” </p>
<p>She raised an eyebrow.</p>
<p>“Maybe we could go to the party together?” </p>
<p>Hermione huffed. “Remember the Yule Ball?”</p>
<p>Ron flushed. “Why’d you have to bring that up?”</p>
<p>“Because it’s happening again. The party’s <i>tomorrow</i>!” Hermione hissed. “I’ve already been invited to attend with someone else, and I said yes.” </p>
<p>“But you knew I’d ask!” </p>
<p>“No, I didn’t!” Hermione sighed. “In future, be more decisive, Ron.” </p>
<p>Blaise Zabini approached. “I’m really looking forward to tomorrow, Hermione.” He offered his arm.</p>
<p>Hermione took it, ignoring Ron’s sputtering.  “Me, too.” </p>
