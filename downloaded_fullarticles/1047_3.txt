  <em>If I'm to die before I reach you. Please know I'm meant to love you till I did.</em>
</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">His mother ushers him into his room far too quickly for it be normal and slams the door behind her.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">“Oh Draco you've really done it now” She sighs, pacing up and down the length of the room, muttering to herself.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">“Mother I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. It's not like I ever thought you would find out.” He explains, hating himself for feeling the urge to cry.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">“Not only is it a boy Draco, which is bad enough in itself, but Harry Potter? Give us something to work with.” She exclaims.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">“Believe me I know. You're not the only one ashamed of this.” He mutters bitterly.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">She stops her pacing and turns to look at him, tears in her eyes and sympathy written all over her face.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">“Draco, your father and I aren't ashamed at all. We don't care that you're gay, and although we wish it could have been <em><b>anyone </b></em>but Potter, within time we would have accepted it. If you weren't a pure blood. And with the Dark Lord.... It's not going to work my boy. You know that you're going to have to stop this right?” She tells him, her tears so close to spilling.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">He nods numbly. “Yes mother I know. But I don't regret it. I love him. I enjoyed something good while it lasted.”</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">
  <em>If I'm to slip beneath a train meant to take me, know that I believe it was worth it.</em>
</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">His mother nods in understanding before walking over to where he's sitting on the bed, taking him into her arms.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">“You know you're going to get punished for this right?” She whispers brokenly into his hair, gently running her hand through it. He nods against her and her embrace tightens.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">“Oh what we do for love.” She laughs without humour.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">Suddenly the door bursts open, and his father rushes in. “Our Lord has been informed. Your sister is on her way. We better go, she can't know that we're okay with this.” He says to his wife.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">“Wait, you were okay with it?” He asks, suspire clear on his face. His father looks at him with an expression worryingly close to fondness.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">“Your mother and I were fine with it because it was clear that you were happy. We must go now. For what it's worth, I'm sorry this has to happen.” He says with full sincerity.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">He struts over to Draco and squeezes his shoulder. “Come on dear let's go.”</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">His mother nods and kisses the top of his head with a whispered 'good luck' before leaving with her husband, the door closing swifty behind them.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">
  <em>Tell my friends goodbye. Tell my now ex-boyfriend that I loved him and left him too soon.</em>
</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">He hates this waiting. He knows what's going to happen, and he knows that his Aunt Bella is ruthless and merciless. He knows that she's most likely going to <em>Crucio </em>him. He knows all of this and he's just sick of waiting for it to happen.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">He doesn't know if he can actually break up with Harry. He really does love him, and he knows that Harry loves him back. He did warn him that his parents might not like it, so he can easily lie to him, tell him that is parents demanded their relationship to end and then they could carry that on in secret. That's a fairly good plan. He really doesn't want this to end. He really does love him.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">He stares at a photo of Harry he always keeps with him. It was winter, and there was snow lightly falling, and it made the brunet look so beautiful. His finger traces Harry's face and he realises how much he misses him. He'll understand about the need for secrecy. He told him what could happen. He kisses the picture, and folds it up, hiding it in his mattress. Aunt Bella didn't need to see it.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">
  <em>Oh I hope to be holding you soon. </em>
</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">He can hear muffled sounds of conversation followed by an insane laugh and he knows that what ever sick and twisted fate is coming for him and it's going to be here any second. The sounds of footsteps thundering up stairs makes his body tense up, and he closes his eye.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">
  <em>Who knows what happens if I leave my room,Oh I'm scared that you'll know what to do.</em>
</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">Once again the door to his room bursts open and this time he knows that it isn't love or understanding waiting for him. It's fear and pain.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">“Oh you have been a very naughty boy Draco! I simply can't wait to punish you!” She cackles.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">He can't stop the overwhelming fear that takes over his body, and it only gets worse when he sees her take out his wound.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">“Stupefy!” She says delightfully.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">
  <em>If I'm to die before you.</em>
</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="CENTER">------------/--------------</p><p class="western" align="CENTER"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">He dreams of the time he got full marks on his Potions exam. Harry had laughed at how stressed he was, and how he studied nearly 24/7, practically ignoring his presence, ignoring everything if he's honest. Harry had teased him about blue balling him, but Draco had just stuck his nose deeper into his Potions book.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">But his almost constant studying had paid off, and he achieved full marks on his exam. He had been so freaking happy that he thoughtlessly waked up to Harry in the great hall and literally dragged him out, deaf to the protests of his friends. The other boy barely had a chance to speak before he was telling him about the good news, and Harry was practically swelling with pride. And instead of mind blowing sex, they actually just talked and cuddled for the rest of the day, Harry telling him how smart he was and how proud he was of Draco every other second and he had honestly never been happier.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">
  <em>If I'm to die before I hold you, know my arms will be worse off for it</em>
</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">It had been a really good day, and seeing Granger look that mad and surprised had been pretty good too. His Mother had hugged him for what seemed like hours and his Father had hugged him too, which was nearly the best part of the day. But no, the best part of the day was seeing Harry look at him with such pride and <em>love </em>and Draco had honestly never felt better in his whole life. It felt like everything was perfect. But then the Christmas holidays came up, and he went home, completely oblivious to the horrors that would await him.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">
  <em>If I'm set upon dragged from my room as I write</em>
</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">He's dragged from his dream when a bucket of ice cold water is thrown over him. He gasps for air as his vision slowly comes back to him. He tries to move his arms but he instantly stops when a sharp pain goes through his wrists and he doesn't need to try and move his legs to know that he's tied up. His arms are behind his back and his legs are uncomfortably tied around what's obviously a chair.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">His vision finally clears and his Aunt's smiling face comes into view.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">“Glad you could join us Draco.” She says cheerfully, and her twisted smile grows when she sees his eyebrows are furrowed in confusion.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">“Oh 'us' is me and my friend here Fenir Greyback. And don't worry my boy, he won't be turning you.” She says reassuringly.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">But it's not reassuring at all. Because if he's not here to turn him, then he's here too...</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">His body freezes in fear and he can hear his heart beating frantically in his chest and he can't breathe any more and please no no no not this, anything but this. He'd rather die than this.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">
  <em>You'll be my last thought before I quit. Give my family love, I would watch from above but I fear there is nothing but sleep. </em>
</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">Greyback stalks over to him, sinister expression on his face, and he leans down to whisper in his ear.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">“So pretty. I like it when they're pretty.” The way he says it sends shudders down his spine, and he closes his eyes as his stomach churns.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">“Oh what's the matter Draco? Thought I was going to let you off with the Cruciatus Curse do you?YOU WILLING DATED HARRY POTTER!” She screams at him, and it's clear she's losing her temper, and fast.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">Tears well up in his eyes and he's fucking terrified because he thought he knew, he thought he knew what was going to happen, but he didn't and this is so much worse and shit he can't breathe.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">“So since you love it up the ass so much, I figure that you wouldn't mind Fenir here having his turn? It's been oh so long for him.” She asks innocently, and his stomach turns again because yes, he does mind, he very much minds. Fear has taken over his mind, and he still can't breathe god dammit.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">Somewhere in the fog that has taken over his mind he realises he's probably having a panic attack. He's had one before but Harry had been there to help him. <em>Harry. </em>He thinks of the boy he loves. The smiles, the gentle touches, the looks shared across a room. Slowly but surely he gets his breathing under control and he can finally fucking breathe.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">
  <em>Oh I hope to be seeing you soon. I don't know what's out there more fear I assume, oh I'm scared that you'll know what to do.</em>
</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">“I'm going to leave now, let you <em><b>lover birds </b></em>have some alone time yeah?”She beams. No no no, please don't leave, just use the curse, starve him for days, kill him, please anything but this. He prays and prays and begs whoever up there is listening that please someone help him, someone save him.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">But no help is coming, no one is out there coming to save him, and there is no god. Aunt Bella skips out the room and the door slams shut.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">Greyback comes into his line of sight, and he grins at Draco. He squeezes his eyes closed and tries to calm the stormy sea inside of him. Fear and terror are taking over his whole body and his mind and the realisation that yes, this is going to happen finally sinks in and shit please no don't do this.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">“Let's get this show started then shall we?” He says, and Draco nearly throws up at the pure pleasure he can hear in his voice.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">
  <em>If I'm to die before you</em>
</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">Rough lips are suddenly against his and if his mouth wasn't currently occupied he would have screamed. A slimy tongue forces it's way into his mouth, and he feels so dirty and gross, and for god knows why he feels guilty, and he feels so wrong because someone else is kissing him and he's still technically with Harry, and he really does love him and he feels like a filthy horrible cheater.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">With a wave of his wand the ropes are gone, and Greyback finally stops kissing him and he has to swallow the bile in his throat. Long jagged nails are pressing into his skin as he in manhandled onto the bed on his stomach, and he has to choke back a sob. His t-shirt gets ripped off of him almost painfully and the foul creature behind him licks up the length of his back and this time he can't suppress the shudder that wrecks his entire body. He feels dirty and gross and god dammit does he wish that he had taken up Harry's offer to stay at the Burrow for the Christmas holidays.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">He'd declined because although Granger and Weasley are starting to warm up to him they aren't quite there yet, and even though Harry had said that it's okay he still didn't feel like intruding. But fuck does he regret saying no now, because he could be snuggling up with Harry right now and this wouldn't be happening. If only he had said yes, because although the last time he saw him is a good memory, it might be the <em>very </em>last time he sees him since there is a very real chance that he can die right now.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">
  <em>And if I'm to die before we spend a soft day know my final thought will be of regret. </em>
</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">His trousers are pulled down roughly and a whole new wave of fear crashes into him. Greyback licks up his thighs and his stomach churns and tears sting his eyes. “You taste so good.” He whispers into his ear, and once again he has to swallow bile.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">He's flipped onto his back and Greyback takes his jeans off completely and he's left in his boxers, and now he has to look into those sociopathic eyes as they gleam with pleasure. The werewolf's lips latch onto one of his nipples and he cries out because he bit it, and he bit it <em>hard</em>. Greyback grips him roughly through his boxers and Draco has never been so flaccid in his life. Unfortunately it doesn't throw him off.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">“Oh what's the matter? Not enjoying it?” He laughs like a man who's lost his mind, and he's Draco's not sure if he's going to come out of this alive. He's not sure he <em><b>wants </b></em>to come out of this alive.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">
  <em>If I'm to drown in the deep sea that parts us, I once lived and loved don't forget.</em>
</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">He's flipped onto his back again and he knows that this it, and fuck is he terrified. His boxers and pulled down and he can hear the sound of a zipper and dread fills him once he realises that he's not even going to prepared.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">“Please.” He begs, voice broken. “Just prep me please.”</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">He squeezes his eyes shut against the onslaught of tears, and he feels filthy and horrible for begging but the chance of him being seriously injured without prep is very real. Greyback just laughs at him, and it fills the room and he just knows that it's going to haunt him for a very long time.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">“Oh, but I like it best dry.” He tells him, and then he tongues his ass hole and the tears in his eyes spill over and he burrows his head into the pillow and tries to block out everything that's happening but he can't do it, it's all to real and fuck this is really happening.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">“There you go <em>sweetie</em>, there's your prep.” He murmurs.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">He pushes into him roughly, a scream tears from his throat and he goes all the way in almost immediately and it feels like he's going to be split in half and there's blood, he knows that there's blood and he wants it all to stop, and this is way, way worse than the Cruciatus Curse, and he's never been in more pain in his life, and please just make it stop he wants it stop, please he just wants everything to stop. He feels filthy and disgusting and horrible. He feels worthless.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">
  <em>Give my paintings to Alice, tell all my good friends that I didn't dare earn their respect.</em>
</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">He sets a fast brutal pace, pounding into him and Draco can barely comprehend what is happening and he's is so much pain. At this point he's practically sobbing into the pillow, making sure his sounds are muffled because he doesn't want to give Greyback the sick satisfaction that he's breaking him. Also he knows that Aunt Bella didn't put any silence charms up and the werewolf didn't either and he his parents did <em>not </em>need to hear this. It would only add to the heart break and humiliation.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">Greyback takes his arms and pins them above Draco's head, holding them in an incredibly tight grip that he knows that it's going to bruise. His hips are most likely already bruised, he doesn't even want to begin to think about what his thighs are going to look like, but he can't ignore the steady stream (and the horrible stench) of blood that is trailing down them.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">If possible he goes even faster, rougher and harder and Draco is hoping, praying, begging that it means he is close to completion. He just wants to wake up from this nightmare but he can't because this is not a dream. Not even in his worst nightmares would he imagine this happening, and this pain is excruciation and he wishes he is dead. Why can't he be dead? Harry is never going to forgive him for this, Draco's just a filthy, worthless cheater.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">
  <em>Oh I hope to be seeing you soon</em>
</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">Greyback lets out a long, loud moan and empties himself in Draco and he wants to sob, out of relief, pain or fear he doesn't know. His thighs are now sticky with come and blood and he biles rises in his throat. He swallows it down thinking that he doesn't know how much longer he can do this for. He pulls out and Draco winces in pain, and suddenly he's being manhandled again, and he would of said that Greyback's movements are almost gentle if he didn't know him, and if he didn't see the sadistic gleam in his eyes. He's just being manipulative. He's now being forced to sip up on the bed, his legs over the edge, and fucking hell it hurt.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">“Oh and don't worry about Potter, I've taken the liberty of sending him a letter for you. It said 'Harry, I'm breaking up with you. I'm sorry, goodbye.' Aren't I smart?” He says cheerfully, picking up his clothes and putting them on.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">Draco felt hollow inside, he would of thought that at least he as allowed to break up with Harry himself. He would have been more gentle, maybe even hinted that this wasn't his decision. Damn they're smart, they know him too well.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">“Oh and as additional punishment, I've cursed you. Don't look like that. You deserve this. Now the curse is already in place.” He tells him gleefully. Draco doesn't have the energy to ask what it is, but Greyback must of seen it on his face, or maybe he just took pleasure in his pain.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">“This curse renders magic unable to heal you. That's right, you're going to heal from any injures, including these, like a muggle would. Oh, and only the caster of the curse can break it. Which I won't.” He laughs as if this some big funny joke, and not the life of a teenager he's talking about.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">He struts out the room, leaving Draco broken and alone with his thoughts. He stands up and winces in pain again, tears stinging at his eyes. Slowly and barely even surely he puts his boxers on, does a quick cleaning spell, which is only good for the dried come because he's still bleeding. Bile rises in his throat and he staggers to the corner of his room, not wanting to go outside. He pukes until his stomach his nothing left, and then he wretches some more.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">
  <em>I don't know what happens if I leave my room, oh I'm scared that she'll know what to do.</em>
</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">Too exhausted to stand up and walk, he crawls instead, dragging himself to another corner of the room. He curls up into a ball, and closes his eyes. He has no intention of sleeping, he just wants to shut out the outside world. Sooner rather than later his thoughts drift to Harry. He knows that by now he's probably got the letter. Is he crying? Is he cursing Draco? Maybe Granger and Weasley know, and they're planning some sort of revenge.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">Nothing can be worse than this, so it doesn't bother him. Maybe Harry knows that Draco didn't send it, maybe he's thinks that this is his parents doing, and that Draco will explain it to him when they get from the holidays. He won't though. He would of if he had gotten the Cruciatus Curse, but he got much worse than that, and Draco's knows that he won't survive this again. He doesn't even know if he's going to survive <em>this. </em>So now Harry is going to hate him, he's going to genuinely begin to hate him, he's going to see that Granger and Weasley were right, he's going to realise that Draco really was a waste of time and nothing but a bad choice. He's going to move on with his life, and Draco's going to be stuck loving him.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">
  <em>If I'm to die before you. If I'm to die before you...</em>
