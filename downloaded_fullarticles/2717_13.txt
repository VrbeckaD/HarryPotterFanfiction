    <p>Honestly, going back for an eighth year at Hogwarts had sounded a lot better in theory than it was in practice.</p><p>Once you had complete independence, it was sort of hard to go back to having a curfew. And, in theory, Harry didn’t want any special treatment just because he had defeated Voldemort, but was it really fair that the man who was responsible enough to rough it for months while hunting down a crazy cult leader now had to be in the eighth year’s section by ten pm, and in his bedroom by midnight?</p><p>Harry didn’t think so. And he didn’t appreciate Hermione’s scolding that <em>at least the eighth years get their own common room</em> and <em>at least we all get our own bedrooms</em>. The tiny number of them that had come back made it not worth it to try to cram them back into their respective houses. They truly did have more in common with one another.</p><p>And he kind of didn’t think it was fair that Draco Malfoy and Pansy Parkinson and Blaise Zabini were getting the same treatment as him. Sure, he had sat in front of the Wizengamot and waxed poetic about how Draco was surrounded by bad influences, clearly wracked with guilt through the whole process, and was “doomed as soon as he was born the Malfoy Heir,” to quote a particularly ridiculous line he had spouted at random during Draco’s trial. He had wanted them all to be acquitted, and he was happy when they were, and he wasn’t into using that kind of leverage against people, he didn’t want them to feel like they owed him. And sure, the war couldn’t have been won without him playing dumb when Harry was caught and taken to the manor. But the war really couldn’t have been won without Harry doing everything else. And they did owe him! And for god’s sake, Harry was just about done following stupid rules.</p><p>And unfortunately, Slytherins prospered under stupid rules. End of the day, when Harry had realized that was the crux of it all. Why do purebloods have so many dumbass rules? Because they’re all cunning, conniving Slytherins who come out of the womb knowing how to manipulate rules that make no sense to their advantage.</p><p>God, he can’t imagine pureblood home life being anything other than a chess game. And sure, Harry’s had been a fight-for-your-life game, but at least he knew who liked him and who didn’t.</p><p>Harry sighed and threw his book to the side, looking at the clock. Eleven after midnight. Full moon shining through the window. He stood up, locking the door, quickly arranging the robes and blankets under his covers, opening up the window and grabbing his broom. He floated out gently, sighing and stretching. Obviously the living-in-the-forest experience had been horrible. No contesting that. But sometimes he missed it. Wanted to sleep out under the stars again, hear crickets and leaves rather than other people and the groans of the castle settling.</p><p>Maybe he should go camping some weekend. He could ask McGonagall. He was sure there’d be a ridiculous, stupid, rule-filled process for it, but he wanted to sleep under the stars.</p><p>He flew around for a bit, checking each level before he lowered himself, making sure that nobody was peeking out, ready to rat on him. Eventually he got down to the edge of the Forbidden forest, walking in and holding his broom. He took deep lungfuls of the fir trees around him, wandering deeper in. Yeah, he’d have to ask to go camping sometime. Maybe Hermione or Ron would want to come with him. Hermione especially seemed to enjoy the outdoors, but he was betting Ron would enjoy it a lot too without the pressure of the whole horcrux-Voldemort-war business.</p><p>His mind drifted back to the Slytherins. They were doing so well back at school, huh? Harry’d like to see them camping. He barked out a laugh, picturing Pansy teetering on her heels, stilettos sinking into the ground. He thought of Blaise, who would obviously be disgusted by all the dirt and mud and cancel. And Draco…</p><p>Draco seemed like the type who would be no help at all. The type who would whine until the fire was roaring in front of him, then wrap a blanket around his shoulders and settle down by it and do nothing else. He could almost see Draco leaning back in a camping chair, flicking a strand of hair out of his eyes, leaning back to turn that pout on Harry, beg for him to come put more firewood on. He could almost see how Draco would open his frosty gray eyes wide, bat his eyelashes, only to narrow them and smirk when Harry did what he wanted. Honestly, it was a good thing Harry had no problem doing the work for two people, he just knew Draco would be nothing more than pretty decoration on a camping trip. He could see Draco being even more useless come morning, walking out of the tent with sleep-mussed hair, frowning at the lack of immediate tea. He could almost hear how Draco would whine, like how he whined when he didn’t like the fruit at breakfast, how he’d roll his eyes and say <em>Harry</em>, long and high pitched.</p><p>He whipped around when he realized that wasn’t his imagination, that was really someone in the distance calling his name, and, hey, he was a lot further into the forest than he realized. He coughed, pushing images of Draco camping out of his head, making the immediate decision not to dwell on how focused on that daydream he had been when he had to worry about the fact that he was caught.</p><p>“I’m in here! I’m fine-“ He cut himself off, freezing up and turning around. Call it a sixth sense from literally 18 years of people wanting his head on a pike, but Harry knew when he was in danger, when someone was watching him. But when he turned around, there was just a wolf. An eerie wolf, sure, but not a werewolf. He lifted a leg, straddling his broom, deciding the best option was probably just flying back over the forest.</p><p>But before he could take off, another growl from behind him caught his attention. When he twisted to eye that wolf, a third leaped out and sunk its teeth into his leg, yanking him off his broom as he yelled and fought. His fingers scraped over fabric as he tried to get his wand out, kicking at the wolves. He made contact with the head of one, only for another to dive at his face. He brought his hands up to protect his face, dully registering the teeth sinking into his arms, the blood dripping down onto his face. He screamed out again, hearing the answering cry from whoever was looking for him before a wolf latched onto his side and he passed out unceremoniously.</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>The first thing he felt when he woke up was pain. He groaned loudly, trying to lift his arms only to find them restrained. He screwed up his face, struggling to open his eyes and jerking in surprise when he found Ron and Hermione’s faces inches from his own. “Madam Pomfrey!”</p><p>Harry didn’t know why she had to scream it, but whatever. He settled back and let the healer check him over, ignoring everyone’s chiding and asking him what he had been thinking.</p><p>“Why am I tied up?”</p><p>Professor McGonagall stepped over, leaning over the edge of his bed. “Mr. Potter, what do you remember?”</p><p>“I snuck out – sorry about that – and went to the forest, and got attacked by a pack of wolves, of all things. Not even the werewolves that live there, just regular ones.”</p><p>Her robes moved as she prepared herself. “There are no werewolves in the Forbidden Forest. And those were not regular wolves. When two werewolves, on the full moon, in their wolf form, mate – very interesting animals are born.” She paused, then nodded to Hermione, who had been actively fighting the urge to interrupt.</p><p>“Harry, it’s so interesting. They’re wolves, they never transform to humans, but they’re especially intelligent, very human-like-“</p><p>“Okay, well, they tried to eat me, so you can lay off the praise.” Harry interrupted, grinning when Ron snorted.</p><p>“Harry. Anyway, it’s so rare that werewolves are interested in anything other than… well, eating, that this almost never happens. But it did, and Dumbledore let them live in the forest so they could be studied by the teachers here.”</p><p>“The problem is,” McGonagall picked up again, “we have no idea how their attack would compare to an ordinary wolf, a werewolf, anything.”</p><p>“… I might be a werewolf.” He said slowly.</p><p>“We won’t know for another month.” She said gently. “But we’ll take care of you, when that month comes.”</p><p>Harry nodded, sitting back. He couldn’t help it – he thought of Lupin. Becoming a werewolf would be… awful, but manageable. One crappy week a month. Hell, Hermione had been managing that since second year.</p><p>He accepted the Headmistress’ offer to call in specialists, researchers, and let her unbind his hands now that they were sure he wasn’t going to wake up feral. He let Hermione check his wounds, and then he let Pomfrey check his wounds for real. She tallied them up in a brusque voice that left no room for vanity – “You’ll have a scar along your right calf, scars up and down the ulnar side of your forearms, and severe scarring across the left side of your side and hip. You likely won’t suffer any long term muscle weakness after the week is out, but I assume you’re benched from Quidditch until we can fully understand any changes that may have taken place.” She paused and lowered the chart, cracking him a smile. “I strongly suspect the only change you’ll experience is a fondness for meat, Mr. Potter. I’ve treated quite a few werewolf attacks, and this was different.”</p><p>He smiled back and watched as she waved her wand and the vitals hovering above his body vanished.</p><p>“So… I can go?”</p><p>“You can go on the condition you dial back exercise, take it easy, and make sure someone comes with you when you go up or down stairs.”</p><p>Harry was already climbing out of bed, accepting the robes Ron gave him, letting Hermione put on his glasses, and heading into the small bathroom.</p><p>Time to face facts.</p><p>He spun around, checking his arms and body for scars. He expected to be horrified. He didn’t expect to kind of enjoy it. All his life he had experienced scars as marks of trauma, but suddenly they looked like some sort of badass resume of all the ass he’s kicked. He got dressed and headed out, flashing a smile at his friends and adjusting his badly smudged glasses.</p><p>They settled into step, heading into the crowds to get down to dinner. He smiled and slapped hands with everyone who stopped him on the way down to tease him about getting into trouble, ask him how he was doing. A smile spread over his face the more people he saw. He knew everyone here, he cared about everyone and they cared about him. Harry had never felt so at home. He threw open the doors to the Great Hall, striding in and breaking away from Ron and Hermione.</p><p>All of a sudden, it wasn’t just the warm feeling of family pushing at him to keep moving. There was a <em>heat</em> pressing against his chest, sinking down, he was practically hyperventilating to follow the smell until the source of the smell was so close, <em>so close-</em> and when he slammed his shoulder into Blaise Zabini’s back and tossed him onto the table in order to drag Draco Malfoy off the bench and to the floor, he didn’t feel bad at all.</p><p>He melted down dreamily, plastering every inch of skin together, ripping off his glasses to bury his nose in the milky white skin of his mate’s neck, soft and unblemished unlike Harry’s scarred tan, and smelling oh so good. He rolled his hips against him repeatedly, enjoying the wiggling body against his crotch and the heady scent in his nose.</p><p>Really, the only bad thing about the situation was that Draco was screaming bloody murder. He growled at him, a little playful rumble meant to remind him who was in charge. Evidently, Draco didn’t see it that way, as his scream went up an octave and suddenly Harry was being dragged off him, snarling and snapping, and he saw Pansy grab her full water goblet and fling it at him, and everyone was staring at him like he’d lost his mind. He shook his head, sending water flying over the group holding him back.</p><p>Unfortunately, after the war, seeing a group of Slytherins grab Harry Potter and throw water at him had some different reactions, and a group of passing Gryffindor’s leapt up and pointed their wands, demanding the burly Slytherins release him as Draco demanded they <em>didn’t do that, under any circumstances</em>.</p><p>Hermione burst into the middle, holding up her hands and looking from group to group. “Just- hold onto him.” She instructed, waving their housemates down as Pansy pulled Draco to his feet, trembling and looking like he couldn’t have been more shocked if Harry stripped nude and started singing Celestina Warbeck. “I know how this looks, but I promise there’s a very reasonable explanation.” She paused. “… Which Harry will tell you!”</p><p>Harry blinked, dripping wet and still staring at Draco. Damn, he was going to think Harry had lost his mind. He had to come up with something good. “I’m sick.”</p><p>“He’s sick!” Hermione repeated, coming over to take his arm and try to drag him away. “I’m going to take him to the hospital wing now.” The Slytherins reluctantly released him, and Hermione dug her nails into his arm, Ron grabbing the other one as they marched him right back to Madam Pomfrey.</p><p>She stopped when they walked in, sighing and rubbing her forehead. “How?”</p><p>“He didn’t get hurt, he-“ She exchanged a look with them, ignored Harry’s pointed glare (what he thought was the universal signal for <em>don’t rat me out</em>), and ratted him out. “He jumped Draco Malfoy and started humping him. Like a dog.”</p><p>Madam Pomfrey was a professional, and her eyes barely widened before she nodded knowingly. “Okay. And- did anything prompt that, Harry?”</p><p>“Uh. Well, it was just the way he… smelled?”</p><p>“The way he smelled?” She prompted, already scribbling away in her notebook. “Was it a good smell, or-“</p><p>“Yes.” He nodded, closing his eyes. Now that he had been so close, he could almost pick it out – when Draco had walked outside sometime back, when he had visited the hospital wing a bit ago. “It was a <em>good smell</em>.”</p><p>“Was it erotic-“</p><p>“Woah!” Ron shouted, flushing to his hair. “We don’t have to be here for this, do we?”</p><p>“Ron, if Harry has an erotic reaction to Draco Malfoy’s smell, then we are going to support him.” Hermione insisted, looking like she concentrating very hard on keeping her lunch down.</p><p>“Honestly, it really wasn’t, until he started moving.”</p><p>“Moving?” She asked in confusion.</p><p>“By ‘moving’, Harry means ‘trying to get away’.” Hermione said.</p><p>“Yeah. Then I started humping him.” He still had his eyes closed, leaning toward the bed. Had Draco been in the hospital wing lately? Harry didn’t remember hearing about it, but it smelled like him. Recent, too. “Is Draco sick?”</p><p>“Excuse me?”</p><p>“The bed smells like him.” He stuck his nose in it, but he couldn’t smell anything sour like some of the other beds.</p><p>“I can’t disclose that information- Harry, stop sniffing the beds.” She said firmly as he resurfaced. “Tell me more about the reaction.”</p><p>“It was just… nice. Like Amortentia, the same reaction. But… more extreme. I just wanted to smell it. I still want to smell it.”</p><p>Hermione frowned, stepping closer. “Madam Pomfrey, when’s the last time Draco was in here?”</p><p>“If he can smell him, his sense of smell has enhanced. Harry, would you mind-“ When Pomfrey stood up, she had a glint in her eye, and Harry knew he was in for a rough year.</p><p>For the next two hours, Harry was poked and prodded and examined. Dinner was sent up, and Harry identified each item of food while Ron was still coming up the stairs. They discovered he could hear whispering out the door and halfway down the hall. His eyesight had improved past the point of needing glasses and past what humans could do. When Hermione and Ron went to fetch clothing from their friends for testing, Harry could tell who they had taken it from before they even entered the room. She tested his reflexes, made him run on a section of floor that would slide like a treadmill, and when she finally let him go to bed, he was so exhausted he fell asleep without demanding an explanation.</p><p>The next morning, he woke up to find that fourteen of the Wizarding World’s foremost experts on lycanthropy had arrived to study him. He was introduced to werewolves, who confirmed they didn’t experience any elevated senses when they weren’t transformed, and gleefully informed him they had never humped anyone, ever.</p><p>When a woman in crisp formal robes heard about what the experts were referring to as “the humping incident”, she immediately dragged the Headmistress and Pomfrey into a private room with Harry. “Mr. Potter? Could you describe the smell of the humping target-“</p><p>“Okay, we don’t need to say the h-word so much.” He said immediately, cheeks flushed as he rubbed his forehead. He was a lot easier embarrassed when he couldn’t stick his nose into the pillow Draco had used at night and focus on the smell of sugar and flowers and wood and tart. Pomfrey had, unfortunately, caught him sniffing the sheets one too many times and changed them. “It was- I felt warm, and happy, and I just wanted to- I just wanted to hold him, I swear, and then he just moved against me. And I growled at him.”</p><p>“Why did you growl? Were you angry?”</p><p>“No, I just- did it, I guess, to-“ He shifted uncomfortably. “To show him I was in charge?”</p><p>She smiled. “There’s nothing to be ashamed of, Mr. Potter. What do you feel about him now?”</p><p>He paused and considered, but even before the mauling Harry had felt his feelings strongly and worn them on his sleeve, and it was only worse now. “I want him here. Or I want to be where he is. I’m worried about him.”</p><p>She clasped her hands to her heart. “Mr. Potter, it seems you’ve inherited several lupine traits – enhanced senses, speed, reflexes, and certain lupine instincts.”</p><p>“Great. So what am I?”</p><p>“Oh, Mr. Potter, this is the first case of its kind. You are something new entirely.” She smiled. “But I can explain the humping incident.”</p><p>“Good, because I don’t get it.”</p><p>“That boy is your True Mate.”</p><p>Harry had the immediate feeling that he was fucked this year. Abruptly any anxiety vanished, replaced with the comforting knowledge that his life was still a shitshow. "What's that?" He sighed out, fully prepared for the worst.</p><p>“It’s been found in magically enhanced lupine species that frequently there will be one wolf above all that wolf chooses to mate with. Mates are selected by scent, and if they are separated before they can mate, both will travel and abstain from mating until they find their True Mate.” She obviously considered this romantic. Harry didn’t quite see it.</p><p>“Uh, that’s not possible. He hates me. I hate him.”</p><p>“No you don’t.</p><p>“Yes, I do.”</p><p>She frowned, not really appreciating the backsass. “I assure you, you don’t. Your… inner wolf, let’s say-“</p><p>“Let’s not!”</p><p>“Let’s!” She repeated happily, ignoring the truly horrified look on Harry’s face. “Your inner wolf has found that boy to be your True Mate. Not to worry, True Mates are always attracted to each other, I’m sure he returns your feelings-“</p><p>“He doesn’t. And neither do I. Let’s say I ignore it, what’s the worst that could happen?”</p><p>She shrugged. “It’s likely you won’t be able to. Particularly as the moon grows.”</p><p>“What?” He demanded. “I won’t be able to?”</p><p>“Well, did you decide to jump on him and begin humping him, or did it just happen?”</p><p>The lady makes a good fucking point, Harry thought. “… Say I leave Hogwarts. What then?”</p><p>“I would have concerns about sleep apparition. And the inevitable catastrophic splinch. If your conscious refuses to be near him, your unconscious will become more desperate to do so.” She was beginning to frown as the severity of the situation sunk in. “I need to be clear, this is mandatory. And I can’t imagine why he’d hate you of all people-“</p><p>“He used to be a Death Eater, Elliana.” The Headmistress spoke up frostily, noticing the widening of Elliana the Mate Expert’s eyes. “Harry-“</p><p>“Can you send in Ron and Hermione? Can I just talk to them for a second?” He settled back as the grown women left, waiting for his friends to come back in. He didn’t know why, but he wanted them closer now too. So much so that he grabbed them and hugged them tightly as soon as they got in.</p><p>Considering Hermione looked like she feared for Harry’s life, Harry probably should’ve seen it coming when, after he explained his predicament, Hermione stood up and announced that, “it’s not a problem, honestly, we defeated Voldemort. How hard can seducing one little Malfoy be?”</p><p>“You know, I don’t love that we’re phrasing it ‘we’re seducing Malfoy’.” Ron said thoughtfully. “Maybe we can say we’re helping? Assisting?”</p><p>Hermione was already digging out a notebook. “Alright. We need a game plan. Let’s focus on shifting his perception of you- do you think you should apologize for hum-“</p><p>“Don’t say the h-word!” He snapped. “… Yes, I think I should.”</p><p>“Okay. Either he’s going to want to cut his own humiliation short and pretend he never got humped on the floor of the great hall, or he’s going to want to drag your humiliation out by making sure everyone knows you humped him in the great hall. You should be prepared to be extremely subtle and apologetic.”</p><p>“Okay. Step one, convince Draco Malfoy I’m not actively crazy.”</p><p>“Step two, convince him you didn’t ruin his life!” Ron said cheerily, standing and helping him up.</p><p>Two hours later found Hermione and Ron casually sitting in the hall, Hermione taking notes, eyes on Draco as he chatted with another eighth year Slytherin. She laughed and reached up, stroking his shoulder. Hermione saw as Harry caught sight of that, a dark look falling over his features. He stormed toward them, practically colliding with the girl as he slid between them, very much in Draco’s personal space. The blonde took a step back in surprise, only for Harry to grab his arm right where she had stroked it, a bright smile on Harry’s face as he rubbed Draco’s arm. “Hey, Draco!”</p><p>Draco, meanwhile, was still pretty sure Harry had lost his fucking mind. His mouth dropped open slightly, looking up as Calliope retreated before making eye contact with Harry and shivering. He glanced to the side primly, ignoring how his cheeks heated. The memory of Harry Potter throwing him to the floor and rutting against him like some kind of wild animal was fresh in his mind, and he did not approve in the slightest.</p><p>It was completely unheard of behavior outside of the lurid romance novels Draco had secretly purchased and kept hidden in the bottom of his trunk, charmed to look like books on potions, and Draco did not want to be thinking about Harry Potter and his treasured novels in the same area at all. He already had a hard enough time making sure Potter stayed out of his more improper dreams.</p><p>“Here to knock me over again?” He snapped, glancing around the hallway for another Slytherin – <em>any Slytherin</em> – to save him, witness this, be ready to sound the alarm, something.</p><p>“No, I want to apologize for that.” He flashed him that smile, brighter than any lumos, and Draco pointedly looked away. “I apparently had a bad reaction to something Pomfrey gave me, and was tripping balls. I don’t even remember it, but I get it must’ve been pretty terrifying for you. I didn’t mean to scare you, I would never try to scare you, and I appreciate that you didn’t even hex me. Would’ve been justified.”</p><p>“Oh.” Harry watched as pureblood politeness kicked in, and Draco accepted the apology. “Don’t think on it another moment. I wasn’t scared, you don’t scare me.” Partially true, that. He really hadn’t been scared when it happened, just startled and alarmed. But he couldn’t deny that, somewhere deep down, he was truly frightened of the Boy Who Lived.</p><p>“I’m glad to hear that. Did I bruise you?”</p><p>Draco flushed harshly. He bruised like a fucking peach, not only was there a bruise on his rear from the initial tackle, there were three under his high collar where Potter had sucked on his neck. None of which he would be discussing. “Was there something you wanted, Potter?”</p><p>Harry frowned slightly, rubbing his arm more insistently before Draco squirmed out of his grip. “Just- let me know how I can make it up to you, okay? Anything you need me for, just ask.”</p><p>“…” Draco opened his mouth to brush it off, but realized that having Harry Potter owe him a favor might come in handy. And didn’t he deserve it? He got mauled in front of everyone! He got hard in front of Pansy, he deserves Potter kissing his feet. “I will. Thank you, Harry.”</p><p>At Harry’s excited grin, Draco bailed, visibly weirded out. The fuck was up with that kid? Harry stared at his back until he rounded the corner, and turned to tug Hermione and Ron into an empty classroom. “He said my name! Did you hear that?”</p><p>“Oh, we heard!” Ron said excitedly, slapping Harry’s arm. “Then you went and fondled him like a freak, and he ran off. Operation Convince-Malfoy-Harry-Is-Sane was <em>not</em> a success.”</p><p>Harry’s face fell, and he turned back, taking a deep inhale. “I guess he does smell a little uncomfortable.”</p><p>Hermione was busily analyzing her notes. “Harry, he blushed when you first touched him, and then again when you asked if you bruised him. I think you were a little too personal. Maybe we should avoid touching.”</p><p>“I couldn’t stop. I just wanted to smell him again.” Harry said honestly before Hermione’s eyes lit up.</p><p>“I have an idea. Let’s steal some shit.” She said instantly, snapping the notebook shut. “Harry can get his fix, and then behave reasonably next time. I’m an eighth year prefect, I can access his room, let’s just take something.”</p><p>Unable to think of a good enough reason not to, they headed back to the eighth year’s common room, Ron standing guard while Hermione waved her wand and then opened Draco’s door. She and Harry ducked inside immediately.</p><p>Harry froze, taking in a deep breath before flopping facefirst onto Draco’s bed, ignoring Hermione’s reprimands as he dragged a pillow down, buried his face in it, and took a deep breath. “I want this.”</p><p>“As if he wouldn’t notice a pillow missing?!” She demanded, whacking the back of his thigh and ignoring his growl. “He’s organized. He might notice anything missing.”</p><p>Harry sat bolt upright. “I’m not leaving this room without something, Hermione.”</p><p>“… I’ve got it. Go get all the pillows from your room. We’ll see which one we can swap. It looks like most of these he brought from home, but some are from Hogwarts.”</p><p>“I don’t want to leave.” Harry’s voice came from where it was buried deep in the pillow, ignoring his best friend as she left the room. He rolled over, bringing the pillows with him, smushing several of them into his face at once. God, that scent. It almost evolved with each inhale, starting with a tart burst, easing into a sugary-flowery sweetness, and mellowing out into a woody scent. Better than Amortentia. Not as good as getting it straight from the source, but he’d take it. A few more deep inhales, and he got up to look around Draco’s room. It was neat, kept together. Didn’t reveal a lot. No pictures taped up to the walls, everything in its place. He stood up, bringing a pillow to sniff as he opened Draco’s armoire. Everything pressed and hung nicely. He headed to his desk after that, finding notebooks and marked up textbooks and even a journal.</p><p>Harry had the morals not to touch that, but not enough to stop sniffing the pillow. He opened his desk drawer, looking at the nicely organized school supplies before shutting it and diving back into the bed when Hermione got back.</p><p>“Okay.” Moments later, she had sorted out the pillows they could swap, and Harry was heading back to his own bedroom with four fluffy prizes clutched to his chest. He climbed on his bed proudly, setting up his new pillows and rolling around in them.</p><p>He suddenly felt bad for giving Elliana the Mate Expert so much shit. Here he was, stealing fucking pillows to get his fix.</p><p>He really was going to have to seduce Draco Malfoy, wasn’t he?</p>
