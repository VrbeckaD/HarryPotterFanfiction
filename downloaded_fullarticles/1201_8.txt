    <p>Dean blinked, willing the tears out of his eyes. His whole life had been a lie. Everything he knew about his mother had been fake. Their father had told them she was a cop who died on the job. Dean should have noticed his bullshit, but he never did. He even planned his life around being a cop, to honor his mom. Now he knew the truth, his mom was an auror (whatever that was) and more importantly a witch. He and his brother were wizards and they had been accepted into a school for magic. Dean was furious. His father had been keeping the truth from him his whole life. </p>
<p>“It’s your choice what to do, you can stay with me and live a normal, happy life.” John paused and sighed “Or you can go to this… School, but nothing but misery will follow you”<br/>Sam looked at Dean as if to ask his older what to do, Dean knew Sam would follow whatever choice he made. He thought, although there really wasn’t much thinking to do. He and his brother never really fit in in this world, they were weird. Dean could hold his own, but Sam. Then there was their dad clearly bipolar, abusive, and manipulative. Anyway, he needed to know more about his mother, about this life. He could not just suppress magic.</p>
<p>“I’m going.” He stated without looking into his father’s eyes. He knew his father wouldn’t be happy with the decision and knew his wrath.</p>
<p>“I will too” Sam piped up. There was a pause.</p>
<p>“Look me in the eyes and say that boy.” came the low growl of his father’s voice. Dean didn’t he couldn’t look up.“But what about me?” Dean heard the crack in his father’s voice. </p>
<p>“What about you?” Dean knew he shouldn’t talk that way to his father, knew what it got him. But it didn’t matter, he was leaving anyway.</p>
<p>“No.” his father shook his head clearly thinking hard. “You were supposed to choose me, and then we could tell them, and put all this behind us. You were supposed to pick family. But you,” He gave a cruel laugh “Of course you chose to betray me, to leave me. You ungrateful bitches.” Dean swallowed hard but tried to look tough. He should’ve known this was some kind of trick, his father would never give them a choice to defy him, not really. “You will change your mind, you will write to these people and tell them you’re not interested in going to their FREAK SCHOOL.” Dean winced at the word, His father had called him that word twice before, once when he accidentally made a picture of his mom break and the other time when he walked in on dean a second away from kissing some kid named Elliot. His father hated Gays; the beating that ensued was one he’d never forget. He suppressed his sexuality after that, becoming quite the ladies’ man. But this time he would stand his ground. </p>
<p>“No” Dean’s blazing green eyes met his father’s brown ones. He could tell they were filled with rage, he had the look he got when he drank and blamed them for mom, except he wasn’t drunk, and this wasn’t about mom.</p>
<p>“What’d you say to me boy”</p>
<p>“I’m not a boy, I’m 16, I can make my own choices and I choose to go”</p>
<p>“No, no that’ll never happen. Not on my watch.” He father got up and made across the room to him. Dean sat up ready to run. “ I’m going to beat that ungodly curse out of you if it’s the last thing I do.” Dean tried to run, he can’t say he was proud of the moment but what could he do? He wasn’t just going to sit there and have his ass beat, and he couldn’t fight his dad. He’d tried. His dad was too fast though and he caught Dean. “ oh running are we boy?” He punched dean between every word “well” Punch “You’re” Punch “not” punch “going” Punch, blood had started to come out of Deans lips “Anywhere” He was done with Dean, thank God. Then Dean saw his dad move to Sammy. “Your turn freak” He heard Sam’s whimper, saw his brother cower.<br/>“And you, choose to follow your dumbass brother instead of staying with me.” Then he heard the smack. No. Getting his own ass beat was one thing but he’d be damned if he let his father do this to Sammy. He struggled to his feet and crossed the room to his father who was just about to land another punch. He grabbed his Dad’s coat and whipped him around much to the older man’s surprise. He landed a punch square in the jaw. His father fell back unbalanced but quickly got to his feet. “Stupid, stupid boy” Dean could see Sammy crying. Then he felt himself being lifted up by his neck. His dad threw him into a bookshelf breaking the wooden structure. Dean gasped for air, the throw was hard. He tried to get up but he couldn’t. He saw his father making his way to him but couldn’t do anything. Then he saw his little brother get up.</p>
<p>“No Sammy” he tried to say, but only blood came out. Sam kicked his father in the back of the knee. John’s leg crumpled beneath him and he almost fell, then he turned to Sam. The last thing Dean saw was his dad beating the shit out of his little brother. Then everything went black.</p>
