    <p>“Tonks, what do you think?” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>A sleepy Nymphadora looked up from her bed blearily, eyeing her twin sister who was not only wide awake, but perched gingerly on Tonks dresser with her massive amount of black, curly hair in her hands. She was eyeing herself in the mirror, clearly indesisive. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“What do I... What?” Tonks asked, rubbing the sleep out of her eyes and stretching out fully on her four poster. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“What do you think about my curls,” her sister elaborated. “I like the super tight spirals but I feel like they make me look too much like Aunt Bella.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You haven’t got the eyelids to look like Aunt Bella,” Tonks said, waving away Ellie’s concerns and heaving herself upright, short pink hair sticking up in all directions. “Or the twinge of insanity in your eyes.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I suppose you’re right.” said Ellie, who was still looking her heart shaped face over in Tonks’ mirror. She screwed up her face, and as if releasing a long held breath, her hair relaxed into soft curls that ran down her back in loose spirals. “All the same, if I make it too curly it’ll friz in this weather.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ellie removed herself from Tonks’s dresser and collapsed onto the unoccupied side of the bed. It was their first day back at Hogwarts in their final year and the rain was beating down hard against the castle as if in protest of their arrival. Ellie, who woke up every morning at six as if she had an internal alarm clock, had already gotten up from her bed in Gryffindor tower, showered, dressed, and snuck into the Hufflepuff common room to bug her sister. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Tonks, who wasn’t remotely a morning person, still looked like she could use an additional two hours. A few of the other seventh year Hufflepuffs were already out of bed and probably getting breakfast, while two others were still snoozing comfortably. Ellie caught Tonks giving them envious looks before she got up out of bed herself and changed from her pajamas to her school robes. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Once she had gotten dressed and stared herself down in the mirror, the two of them walked out of the Hufflepuff common room side by side. Tonks was sporting vibrant blue hair that fell straight down to her collarbones. Both were now chatting away about the classes they’d be taking that year. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I still can’t believe you’ve talked me into taking N.E.W.T. level potions,” Tonks sighed dramatically. “I was really hoping to be done with him last year. He hates me you know,” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Oh, Snape hates everyone,” Ellie said dismissively, “besides, if you want to be an auror you’ll need your N.E.W.T. in potions,”  she added matter-o-factly. “And this year you’ll have me to dick around with.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Yeah, that brings me to my other question. What is your reason for taking potions this year anyway?” Tonks asked. They were now past the kitchens and headed up to the great hall. Their stomachs were growling from the smells of breakfast wafting from the kitchens. “You’re planning on going into a care of magical creatures field.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I just enjoy the subject” Ellie said innocently, “and you never know, Potions might be useful in whatever field I decide to delve into.” </p>
<p>From the look she was receiving, she could tell Dora wasn’t convinced. For the vast majority of the school save the Slytherins, potions class was anything but enjoyable. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Right,” said Tonks, her voice dripping with sarcasm. “Couldn’t have anything to do with that little crush you have on Snape, could it?” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ellie grinned in spite of herself. Her left foot had caught her right leg and she tripped forward, stumbling to keep herself from face planting onto the stone floor. When she rose up her cheeks were red. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I don’t have a crush on Snape.” Ellie replied airily, blowing a black curl out of her face. Tonks sniggered. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Sure you don’t,” Tonks said, grinning, “you just watch his every move in potions class, and answer all his questions, and get perfect grades, and-“ </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Y’know, some would call that being a good student,” Ellie said superiority before winking at her sister. “And so what if I want a little ‘extra credit’,”  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I still think you’ve been addled by a few too many bludgers to the head,” Tonks said, pulling a disgusted face. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ellie was spared thinking of a retort by the appearance of Charlie Weasley, another seventh year who had just ran into them on his way from the Gryffindor tower. He grinned ear to ear when he saw Ellie. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I sure hope not,” said the stocky redhead as he fell into step with the twins. He shifted his school bag over from one meaty arm to another. “I still need you as one of my beaters.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Oh, Charlie,” Ellie said reproachfully, “you know no amount of brain damage would keep me from pummeling Slytherin team with a bat.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“That’s my girl!” Charlie said approvingly, “first practice is Thursday afternoon, I’m holding some tryouts since our keeper and one of our chasers left end of last term. If you miss it I’ll have to kill you.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You can try,” said Ellie, punching Charlie’s arm. “I’ll grab your schedule if you grab me some eggs.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Deal,” said Charlie, and with a wink he split off from the two of them, heading over to the Gryffindor table and ruffling the hair of two identical red headed first years. The Weasley twins Fred and George. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“See,” Tonks continued, gesturing towards the retreating Charlie, “there’s someone you could fancy. He’s your age, he’s not hideous, he has a personality, he’s your age, he doesn’t have the temper of a mountain troll, he’s YOUR AGE-“ </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Charlie and I are about as interested in each other as Dumbledore is the Dark Arts.” said Ellie, “the day Charlie is more interested in girls than he is dragons is the day I eat a desk.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Yeah, Yeah, whatever,” Tonks said, rolling her eyes. She looked back over at the two red heads that were the Weasley twins and smirked. “Is it just me, or do those two look like trouble?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You never know,” Ellie shrugged, “for all we know they could be minute versions of Percy.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The two of them snorted. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Tonks walked over to one end of the staff table to get her schedule from Professor Sprout. Ellie walked towards the other end to see a severe looking witch with dark hair pulled neatly back into a tight bun. She had a pair of square shaped glasses perched on top of her nose. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Morning Professor,” said Ellie with a grin. “Can I get my schedule? Oh, and Charlie’s too please,” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Certainly,” said Professor McGonnagall. She thumbed through the papers set before her and brandished two schedules, the top one reading, “Tonks, Alyrianna,” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>”Thanks!” Ellie said, “see you..” she trailed off as her eyes darted over her schedule, “this afternoon!” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Professor McGonagall gave Ellie a rare smile as she turned toward her twin and they walked down to their tables. Tonks held up her own schedule and groaned loudly in contempt. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Potions! Our first day back and the first damn class is potions?!” She smacked her palm to her forehead, “the last thing I feel like seeing first thing on a Monday morning is Snape curling his lip at whatever I’m trying to make,” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“That makes one of us.” said Ellie in a singsong voice, grinning toothily at her sister. The look Tonks gave her in response was a mixture of disgust and amusement. But if she was going to call Ellie out on her little crush, she was going to have her own fun with it. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You better hope having the trace lifted off me hasn’t put me in heat,” Ellie whispered before turning to head down to her own house table. The sound of Tonks’ obnoxious retching at her last statement made her grin even wider. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>She walked down the Gryffindor table and sat herself down next to Charlie, who, as promised, had a plate piled high with scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, and toast. Adjacent to that was a goblet of ice cold pumpkin juice with her name all over it. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Weasley, you’re a god.” Ellie said, looking down hungrily at the feast set before her. She handed him his schedule and sat down on his left, almost not noticing the twins sitting opposite her and Charlie. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Ellie,” Charlie said after swallowing a particularly large bite of pancakes, “these are my brothers Fred and George,” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The twins looked up and grinned. They had a glint in their eye of something that made Ellie quite sure they’d be nothing whatsoever like their rule loving brother Percy. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Hi,” Ellie said warmly, “erm, which one of you’s which?” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“No idea half the time,” Charlie said with a shrug, “they love to drive Percy mad. Peeves is gonna love them.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I’m Fred,” said the one directly in front of her, “this is George,” he pointed in turn to his left. George grinned, his mouth too full to talk. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Pleasure to meet you!” said Ellie, “I’m Alyrianna Tonks, but please call me Ellie.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Why should we call you Ellie?” Inquired George, who finished whatever had been previously occupying his mouth. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Because Alyrianna sounds like a sexually transmitted disease,” Ellie stated matter-o-factly. “and my sister called dibs on our surname so I’m stuck with the nickname Charlie gave me in our first year.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“It’s not a bad nickname!” said Charlie, elbowing her in the ribs. “And you certainly seem to like it better than ‘Alyrianna’,” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Oh, stuff it,” she said, casting a playful look at Charlie before indulging herself in what was the best breakfast she’d had in what felt like ages. In about ten minutes she had cleared the plate and looked up, noticing that the twins were staring at her open mouthed. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Where do you put it all?” asked Fred.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>”Have you got a hollow leg?” asked George</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“She eats enough to feed a troll,” Charlie told the twins, who were clearly impressed. “You should see how much she puts away at dinner. She might look tiny but she’s got the density of a dying star.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“So tactful,” Ellie said approvingly, then looked back over to the twins. “I’m beater for the Gryffindor quidditch team. I’m five foot six inches of pure muscle.” she pulled one of her sleeves up and flexed a well muscled arm to demonstrate. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Wicked,” said George, grinning. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>After chatting merrily with the Weasleys for another ten minutes, Ellie finally rose from her seat and slung her bag over one shoulder. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I’m off to potions, see you three later!” She called over her shoulder, heading back towards the double doors. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Oh right, that reminds me,” she heard Charlie saying to the twins, almost businesslike,  “our Potions Master is Snape, he’s a major twat. You’ll hate him.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                          ***</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There was a restless murmur in the dungeons classroom as the students who signed up for N.E.W.T. level potions rustled through their bags and pulled out supplies. Tonks was sat at the table in front of Ellie, chatting away with another seventh year Hufflepuff about how their summer holiday had been, and their plans after graduation. All chatter ceased, however, when the dungeon door slammed closed, and a brooding man with long dark hair and a sour face swept into the room. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Good morning,” Snape said icily as he strode to the front of the class, glaring at each of them in turn until his eyes rested on Ellie. She smirked back at him in response, one hand playing with a loose black curl, the other drumming the pads of her fingers silently against the top of her desk. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Morning Professor,” Ellie said, winking. Muffled laughter came from behind her. Students in her class last year were all too aware of her infatuation with their potions master. Snape blinked once at her before turning back to the rest of classroom and giving them a brief speech on his expectations of them, considering they were his top level class. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“To see how many of you did the proper studying over the summer, you shall be creating a solution of fortification. You will have exactly one hour and twenty-five minutes to complete the potion. At the end of the lesson we shall choose one to test.” He flicked his wand, “you will find the instructions on the board.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>At once everyone studied the board for a few moments and then set off unpacking ingredients they’d be using,  and preparing the kindling beneath their cauldrons to be lit later. Ellie began by placing a good sized chunk of dried dragon liver down on the cutting board in front of her and doused it in a small amount of water to rehydrate. The then pulled a sprig of foxglove from her bundle of herbs and started to chop it into fine pieces. After glancing up at the board a few more times, she eventually got into the swing of things, and before she knew it, she was looking down at a simmering, translucent potion with a slight purple hue. She had just ladled some into a vial and corked it when Snape called for the rest of the class to stop what they were doing and come up with their own vials. Ellie rose up out of her chair and handed Professor Snape her corked potion. She made a point to let her fingers graze his own for a moment before she turned to sit back down at her chair. Snape’s Mouth was a thin line.</p>
<p> After everyone had handed over their own potions, some looking very similar to Ellie’s, others looking a muddy brown color, Professor snape spoke again. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Who’s shall we test then?” He asked, looking around at the students. “Anyone care to offer?” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Tonks, who had delivered one of the rather off looking potions, ducked her head down, as if the blue hair obscuring half her face would draw less attention. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I’ll test mine,” Ellie said, raising her hand up. Snape turned his cold gaze over to her again and she bit her lip. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Very well.” Snape said, folding his arms across his chest. The rest of the class turned to Ellie who had stood herself back up and ladled another bit of potion into a vial. She looked around at the room for a split second before tilting the vial upside down and downing it in two gulps. She shuddered violently and grimaced, thinking for a moment that she might show the entire class what she had had for breakfast. Then the nausea subsided and was replaced with a feeling of cold water trickling down her head. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“How does it taste?” Snape asked, his lip curling into what was almost a smirk. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Like a house elf’s loin cloth,” Ellie said, causing Tonks to snort so loud a few students jumped. “How do we know if it worked?” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I reckon we’ll have to chuck something heavy at you and see if it bounces off or not,” said Daine, a Ravenclaw seventh year. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“That’s the idea,” Snape said cooly. “I have a rather large brick next to the door that should be sufficient.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ellie raised her eyebrows and grinned at the handful of students in the room. No one seemed too keen to throw something heavy at her. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Come on then, Jericho,” she goaded, looking over at the Slytherin quidditch team captain. He had short dark hair and deep blue eyes that made the vast majority of the girls in school swoon. “You know you want an excuse to lob something at my head,” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Jericho’s lips turned upward in a smirk, and he rose to his own feet, walking across the classroom to the brick the size of a very fat hedgehog. It was the one Snape used regularly to prop open the heavy dungeon door. She watched his arm stiffen as he picked up the brick and cradled it. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Stand there, Mr. Odine,” Snape said, gesturing for Jericho to stand a few paces to Snape’s left, about five yards from herself. “and don’t miss.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The class held it’s breath as Ellie squared her shoulders and watched Jericho get into position and maneuver the brick into a comfortable position in husband hand. She made sure to keep her arms by her sides, even when the sight of him pulling back his arm caused adrenaline to pump wildly through her veins. Had she double checked her ingredients? Triple checked? Timed the simmering correctly before adding more materials? She was so concerned with thinking through her potion over in her head that she didn’t notice the brick being thrown until it collided with her chest and shattered into a million pieces. Several students shriked in surprise. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ellie blinked several times, looking down at herself in shock and looking back up at Jericho, who mirrored her own look of surprise.  She hadn’t even felt it hit her. She let out the breath she had been holding and the plume of dust from the brick that had shattered on her chest made her sneeze. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Full marks,” Snape said dully, “class dismissed.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The classroom fell silent again and everyone slowly registered what had just happened. Tonks grinned broadly at her sister and clapped a few times. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“That was bitchin’, Ellie!” Tonks shouted as they left the classroom. She was walking sideways and tossing ink bottles at Ellie’s head and catching them as they bounced back at her. “How long is it supposed to last?” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Before Ellie could answer, a hand was placed on her shoulder and she looked up to see Snape glaring down at them both. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I’ll need to remove that,” he said evenly. “This way please.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ellie tried not to look visibly displeased as she turned away from her sister and followed snape back to the classroom. She hoped if she got out of there quickly enough she’d be able to keep her newfound armor until it wore off on its own. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Can’t I keep it?” She asked tentatively “I was hoping to find Peeves later and really freak him out“ </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Certainly not,” said Snape, closing the door behind them and striding over to his desk, rummaging through drawers apparently looking for the antedote. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Well..” she said slowly, walking forward to sit on the desk in front of his own, “How was your summer, then?” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Snape stopped rummaging and looked up at her at her like she had gone mad. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I just did lots of applications, mostly,” Ellie went on when she realized Snape wasn’t going to divulge her in details of his own summer break. “Trying to find a position doing something care of magical creatures related. Maybe working with dragons or something.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Snape was now uncorking an unlabeled vial of  black liquid and smelling it, before corking it again and handing it to her. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Pity you didn’t decide to go into something for potions,” Snape said, “you have an aptitude for it.” He was now sitting at his desk with his fingers laced together. He raised his eyebrows at her when she grinned at him. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Drink.” Snape said, “before you’re late to your next class. I’m not writing you an excuse.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ellie scowled at him before tilting back the vial and drinking the antidote. This, unlike the potion she herself created, tasted sweet and and left her feeling warm and fuzzy in her middle. Snape took a small mint from a bowl at his desk and pelted it at her forehead. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Ouch!” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You’re cured.” He stated, “Out.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ellie stared at him in shock before laughing and removing herself from the top of her desk and heaving her bag higher up on her shoulder. She turned her head on her way out the door and grinned at him. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“See you around, then,” she said, before letting the door close behind her. She hurried up the dungeon steps and bit her lip to keep from looking too pleased with herself.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Author’s Note: </p>
<p>Hi guys! I’m not sure how popular fan fiction is anymore. It’s been a loooong time since I’ve read any but I’ve had the story stuck in my head for quite a while and figured I’d write it out somewhere. If you like what you see and would like for me to continue, please leave a comment. Thanks!!</p>
