    <p>To be very honest, Harry Potter, aged 12, liked Defence Against the Dark Arts the most. He adored the nature of the course – to defend against something. Too bad he couldn’t actually yelled <em>stupefy </em>at Dudley. That would probably save him all the energy needed to run away and probably stunning everyone in Privet Drive would allow him to stash more than just extra bread slice for dinner.</p><p> </p><p>And maybe, if he had a better teacher, he would excel spectacularly in the subject. Granted he had only two teachers to compare so far but both gave no impression they had fought dark arts. Hell, Harry didn’t think they were the fighting-type at all.</p><p> </p><p>Professor Quirrel stuttered a lot and rarely talked with his eyes looking at the person he was talking to. He stopped because he claimed the Hogwarts castle had too many ghosts and there were voices which kept him awake at night. Harry suspected it was Peeves – everyone did. But who can stop a quivering professor without breaking him further?</p><p> </p><p>Then there was Gilderoy Lockhart. Harry refused to call him professor since the guy cared more about his appearance than actual teaching. He had no idea how the professor’s smile affected the girls in his year so much. He might be able to understand the constant dreamy eyes they had when Lockhart flaunted his shiny teeth but he didn’t think he could hear more of <em>‘Professor Lockhart looked at me today’ </em>or ‘<em>Do you know he defeated two werewolves during the full moon by himself?</em>’.</p><p> </p><p>After countless complaints – mostly from the boys – for the lack of what they called<em> defence practise, </em>the blonde professor finally decided to organized Duelling Club to give ‘<em>extra lessons for the lost little lambs’. </em>The idea of it was fun. Everyone was excited to show their skills with the Weasley twins planned to humiliate Lockhart with jelly-leg curse. Ron was sceptical of the idea of the club all-in-all saying ‘<em>It’s gonna be another platform to tell how he killed a banshee barehanded, that if Snape didn’t get to him first. I don’t know which one is worst; having Lockhart as the instructor or Snape as his assistant’. </em></p><p> </p><p>How Harry wished Fred and George would do their thing at the moment. Instead, he was standing in the middle of duelling area with one Draco Malfoy as his opponent. He should have known the Slytherin won’t settle with spells found in books of their age. He just had to summon a snake, trying to induce fear (he did make everyone gasped). And of course, being the one who had to save the day and not even giving Harry chance to utter a simple <em>stupefy,</em> Lockhart came in front, shouted another spell that was supposed to burn the snake into ashes. It would be quite a show, Harry believed, if Lockhart managed to aim his wand in the right direction. On a second thought, Harry didn’t even think Lockhart pronounced a correct spell.</p><p> </p><p>As the snake hissed – angry that its tail was injured – everyone blanched even more when it somehow grew bigger than when it first being conjured. Harry, the always odd guy in the group, was amazed rather than turning white.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>You can grow bigger?</em>” Harry asked innocently, not realizing he was hissing.</p><p> </p><p>There was absolute silence in the room. The snake went rigid too.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>I thought you aren’t real,</em>” he hissed again, oblivious to the surrounding.</p><p> </p><p>It took a moment to realize every single soul was staring hard at him and it took another minute before he realized what he had done. Ron was gaping in horror while Fred and George had the opposite reaction – they were cheering on him. Hermione’s brows would link if she frowned harder and a Slytherin girl next to her – Pansy if he remembered her name right – had an accusing look on her face. The rest of the floor wear similar expressions and whispers started to fill the air.</p><p> </p><p>A curse was spoken and the snake was vanished. Professor Snape, who stopped being a spectator, put his wand away as no more smoke can be seen. His normally sour face went worst while Draco who was standing not far behind him seemed… angry?</p><p> </p><p>“Well, I guess I let my shock overrule my mind,” Lockhart broke the silence. “Thank you, Professor Snape, for taking care of the snake. I wish I could give a good <em>Fiendfyre </em>show before. Too bad, next time I guess.”</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Fiendfyre </em>is <em>deadly,</em> Professor Lockhart,” Snape stated, his eyes not moving away from Harry. “Sure you can control it just well? Even I didn’t dare conjuring the fire with students nearby,”</p><p> </p><p>“Ahh… that’s the beauty of being adventurous like me, isn’t it so, Severus? You learn <em>hard </em>things like that,” Lockhart smiled cheerfully, “Although I wish I could learn Parseltongue like our Harry did here. You know, when I travelled to India to search more about inferi, I met a guy who would teach me the language. I was half-way mastering it when he died of heart attack…”</p><p> </p><p>Lockhart babbled some more indistinctive information he didn’t catch up because Harry was involved in unplanned battle of who-look-away-first-lose with Professor Snape. He didn’t know what the professor want from him. The Slytherin’s head never took interest in him unless to belittle his sloppy work, claiming talents couldn’t be inherited – whatever it meant. And now, the man seemed like he was trying to read things inside his head. He felt something poked his mind but that got to be just a feeling, right?</p><p> </p><p>He felt his hand were pulled when he realized other students had dispersed, leaving him with a handful of Gryffindors.</p><p> </p><p>“You never tell us you could talk to snake, Harry,” Fred spoke first, grinning as he rested his arms on Harry’s shoulder.</p><p> </p><p>“If we know you had this talent, we wouldn’t have to hunt for the snakes for their venoms in the Forbidden Forest. You know, research purpose,” George continued, mimicking his twin’s action on the other side.</p><p> </p><p>“Forbidden Forest had its name for a purpose. You could get killed,” Hermione intercepted. “Why didn’t you tell us, Harry?”</p><p> </p><p>“Tell you what?” Harry feigned innocence.</p><p> </p><p>“That you could talk to snake!” Ron replied, almost bellowed him. “Parselmouth shouldn’t be trusted! And I trusted you with lots of secrets!”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, my dear brother, was it about you had secret fetish with women with large bosom?” Fred asked.</p><p> </p><p>“Or was it that you love your red trunks too much you don’t mind wearing them even they’re full of holes? Come on, it’s not Harry. That’s us. Can’t you tell?” George added.</p><p> </p><p>They were all laughing sans Ron. Harry managed to chuckle but stopped immediately when Ron turned red.</p><p> </p><p>It did take him a while before he could say, “I don’t think it’s a big deal,”</p><p> </p><p>Harry lied. He distantly remembered Tom said otherwise. It’s not an ability to be feared but rather an ability that will give you all kind of advantages when it was kept secret. So it was a big deal.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t think I can trust you after this,” Ron snapped before diverted his eyes to the remaining crowd, “He can speak to snake and he’s in Gryffindor! For all I know that’s shady enough not to trust him. Who’s with me?”</p><p> </p><p>Harry was sure Ron was expecting some sort of rebel group supported his belief but what happened was no more than whispers. Fred and George, seeing that, grinned ear to ear and whistled mockingly.</p><p> </p><p>But the twins didn’t see what Harry saw. The whispers were nothing close to ridiculing Ron; they were more of debating the idea he boldly stated. Hermione in particular can be seen with frowns when she was stuck at questions and intend to do her research at library – that, if the library had the answer.</p><p> </p><p>Realizing no one was about to support his statement, Ron huffed and left them. Hermione followed not long after. It was then everyone went quiet and looked at him with accusatory eyes; more intense that what Pansy gave him.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, come on, really?” George broke the silence.</p><p> </p><p>“Let them, dear brother. I believe we have new… fascinating things to focus on,” Fred said, consoling Harry at the same time.</p><p> </p><p>“Why do you still believe him? Are you a traitor too?” Seamus, Harry’s dorm mate spoke before the twins managed to get him away.</p><p> </p><p>“Well, we are already blood traitor, they said,”</p><p> </p><p>“Why not add more to that title?”</p><p> </p><p>Wishing the earth would swallow him, Harry gave them a thin smile before choosing to look at the floor. He knew he will be alienated again; <em>just like before</em>.</p><p> </p><p>He felt he was swapped away, too distracted to realize where he was brought to. He wondered if Tom was right – about not fearing Parselmouth. It was less than minute and he already experienced the heavy glances thrown on his way. He can foresee his upcoming days, years even, would be spent with people holding prejudice against him.</p><p> </p><p>It seemed the castle slowly turned into Privet Drive in term of how he’ll get treated. The only consolation he got was at least the castle would offer plenty of spaces to hide if everything became too overwhelming. Maybe the twins will help him. Or maybe he could ask the ghost; Peeves would know how to hide better providing he could provide the poltergeist something in return. Or if Madam Pince decided she would finally show any sign of sympathy towards him, maybe she’ll show a secluded area that no one heard of.</p><p> </p><p>Harry was so lost in his thought that only after he heard a door was shut he broke his reverie. Fred and George looked at him worriedly.</p><p> </p><p>“You okay?” Fred asked first.</p><p> </p><p>Harry nodded, realizing he was in the twin’s room. Their roommates weren’t there. He was seated on the bed which he suspected belonged to George.</p><p> </p><p>“You know Ron can be a git, right?” one of them asked. “And you know we’ll shield you if anything went overboard, right?”</p><p> </p><p>Harry gave them a weak smile. “Why are you always kind to me?” he asked, not answering their earlier question.</p><p> </p><p>George shrugged. “I guess we like you a lot,”</p><p> </p><p>“Thank you,” Harry replied, not all convinced. “But, why?”</p><p> </p><p>“Just because,” Fred answered.</p><p> </p><p>The answer reminded him of Tom.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>“Why?” he asked.</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Arching his brows, Tom asked back. “Why what?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Why did you save me?” </em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>The question made Tom wondered the same thing. “What’s your name?” he asked, avoiding the question.</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Harry,” </em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Harry… Hi, Harry. My name is Tom,” Tom didn’t offer his hand, rather, he put them in his pockets. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“You still haven’t answer my question; why did you save me?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Why are you so curious? Aren’t you supposed to say thank you? That’s manner, you know,”</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Thank you, Tom,” Harry replied, probably half-heartedly grateful. “Again… why did—”</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“—I save you?” Tom cut him. “Just because,”</em>
</p><p> </p><p>“No one saves someone else for just because,” Harry whispered, repeating words he said to Tom.</p><p> </p><p>“What are you saying, Harry?” George asked, not catching his sentence.</p><p> </p><p>“No one is kind to me just because,”</p><p> </p><p>The twins laughed. Harry frowned.</p><p> </p><p>“You know, for someone who haven’t received enough kindness to ask question like that, you yourself is too good to be true,” Fred started his speech. George who sat next to him nodded vigorously. “We aren’t exactly a kind person to tell you this, but to make it simple… how do I say this…”</p><p>“I told you, we like you. Like a lot,” George continued, his arms opened wide.</p><p> </p><p>“Why do you like me though?” Harry asked again. “I am like the plainest person ever exist,”</p><p> </p><p>It was the twins’ turn to frown. Their face scrunched trying to think how to answer the question.</p><p> </p><p>“Can’t we just like you?” George asked after a while.</p><p> </p><p>“Without reason?” Harry asked him back.</p><p> </p><p>“Maybe one day we’ll find reason. But for now, yes, we just happen to like you without any,” Fred answered genuinely.</p><p> </p><p>Harry regarded them carefully, mouth agape in wonder. It had never crossed his mind that one can like others without reason. It was a peculiar thought. But maybe just like Fred said, maybe one day the reason will come out. As for now, he was glad.</p><p> </p><p>“I like you guys too,”</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>“Now, try to turn them into a nice looking goblet. Work with your partner,”</p><p> </p><p>As Professor McGonagall finished, everyone turned to the person next to him. Harry wasn’t sure what he should do; no one was sitting beside him.</p><p> </p><p>“Where is your partner, Mr Potter?” the Professor asked.</p><p> </p><p>Harry gave him a weak smile. He scratched his head, hoping he could find appropriate reason without letting her know directly no one was talking to him since the incident; not that the professor didn’t know what was happening.</p><p> </p><p>He saw Ron said something at Neville but the latter didn’t even listen to him. Their eyes met and Neville could only mutter sorry. The class was in odd number that day since Hermione couldn’t show up due to an incident related to Polyjuice Potion. Otherwise, Ron would be her partner while Neville would be his.</p><p> </p><p>Harry smiled again; this time at Neville, understanding. Neville wasn’t exactly any better than him. He too was a plain, quiet boy but somehow the universe decided Harry was the one with a bitter life.  </p><p> </p><p>“Can I work alone today, professor?” Harry asked politely, his eyes lingered at the newly formed pair.</p><p> </p><p>Professor McGonagall followed his sight and sighed almost immediately. Of course he heard what happened during the duelling club but she didn’t expect Harry to be ostracized yet again. She thought at least her Gryffindors were more than this.</p><p> </p><p>“Sure you’ll be okay?”</p><p> </p><p>Harry nodded.</p><p> </p><p>“I can easily put you in any pair of your choice, you know,” she stated, obviously had a soft spot for the raven.</p><p> </p><p>“You can be my partner if you want, Professor,” Harry blurted jokingly.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t trust your class members who I believe would somehow blow things in front of them. Like—” a loud explosion came from the front, “oh, dear,”</p><p> </p><p>On the third row, smokes dissipated and revealed one Seamus Finnigan with traces of ashes. He did it again; blowing things up. Everyone were laughing, Harry did too. But when his eyes met the embarrassed boy, he was assaulted with a glare from the latter. Harry quickly turned away, ignoring the commotion.</p><p> </p><p>He waved his wand repeatedly, enchanting the spell he just learnt despite being distracted. It wasn’t fair and he was tired. It had been a week and things were not improving – no one talked to him or involved him in anything, loathed faces when he was partnered with other than Neville and now he wasn’t even welcomed to laugh at silly mistakes when everyone else did.</p><p> </p><p>“Mr Potter!” Professor McGonagall called his name, snapping him out. “I wish you would very well wave your wand properly. I don’t fancy another explosion in my class,”</p><p> </p><p>Everyone chuckled menacingly at him. Ron sneered as if the raven made the silliest mistakes that day.</p><p> </p><p>“Maybe you should try talking the rat language, Potter,” a Slytherin mocked him. He didn’t see who. “It suits you better, you know,”</p><p> </p><p>Laughter erupted and Harry was so sure his face had the same colour with his tie. He gritted his teeth; pretended he never heard any of that or that he saw Ron laughed the loudest.</p><p> </p><p>He tried to focus on what in front of him, remembering the wand movement showed by his teacher in attempt to ignore the commotion. He believed he heard Professor McGonagall scolded them and deducted some points but he refused to care. Taking a deep breath, Harry waved his wand again; this time with more determination with a clear image of a ruby-studded goblet in his head. It took a few try before…</p><p> </p><p>“Congratulations, Mr Potter,” he heard Professor McGonagall said. “The first one to actually do what a student in my class supposed to do. That is indeed a nice-looking goblet. 10 points to Gryffindor,”</p><p> </p><p>Harry stared at the newly formed object in front of him. It wasn’t full of rubies as he imagined but the gems were here and there. The goblet itself has gold colour.</p><p> </p><p>“Thank you, Professor,” he finally said, almost forgetting his manner.</p><p> </p><p>That simple word contained a combination of self-satisfaction and his version of mocking which directed towards the rest of the class. Putting his wand aside, Harry pretended to drink from it and asked if Professor McGonagall would kindly fill the goblet with wine; claiming it was the only drink befitted to be poured in.</p><p> </p><p>She chuckled. Harry chuckled too. Everyone else was not.</p>
