</p>
<p>
  <span>The faculty lounge of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry was toasty warm, a stark contrast to the sky outside, already pitch black as was typical for December in Scotland even though it was only just past five. A golden glow cast by the ornately carved marble hearth, held back the shadows with a roaring fire. It was large enough to accommodate a tall wizard who insisted on floo-travelling in the completely upright position. Hermione mused that it could probably handle two or even three people at once, and doubtlessly had been used for the very purposes for hundreds of years.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The founders themselves may have sat together as the faculty did tonight, managing the school in this very room hundreds of years ago. To Hermione, the weight of such history was simultaneously discomfiting and inspiring. A second glass of mulled wine cradled in her hands kept her pleasantly relaxed. She was comfortable in this august company, no longer feeling the need to react to every point. Tenure did that to a witch. Even so, she yearned to leave her mark on the school. To make a difference. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The Headmistress’ voice shifted away from a monotonous monologue dedicated to the mundanity of everyday management of the school. “The last item I’d like to discuss with you is a call for service. Professor Granger, you have the floor.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Minerva’s eyes of glacial blue pulled Hermione back to the moment. Her heart skipped a beat much like it might have if she were late for class and eleven years old. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Sitting up straighter, Hermione put down her mug and pointed her wand at the frame above the hearth, conjuring her visual aid for her presentation. Thus prepared, she began. “As you all know, I’ve been very concerned about the need for a better system to help our Muggleborn students get ready for, and matriculate into a magical institution. You all recall how badly things went for Betsy Norwood?” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The unfortunate girl had arrived at school completely unprepared, without even a robe or wand. Investigation revealed that she’d been abandoned by her family at King’s Cross. It could have been avoided entirely if the family had been educated properly, and if this failed, provide a better safety net to protect these innocent children. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Muttered agreement from her colleagues encouraged her to continue, so Hermione pressed onward to the next point. “We need to raise funds to fill a new position on staff, a full-time teacher who will spend all of their time seeking out these muggleborn students and their families, and help them get the resources they need. Schools in the United States call these teachers guidance counsellors. Now, the Board of Governors have agreed that there is an obvious need, but have declined to commit sufficient funds.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>In fact, the Board hadn’t lowered themselves to reject the proposal on Principle, blaming the strain of an already tight budget. She’d managed to get in writing that they agreed with the idea in the most abstract, non-committal manner possible. As far as Hermione was concerned, she’d won, for she’d never let a paucity of Galleons get in her way. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>A snort drew her attention to the figure closest to the door, well away from the fire. Tall, lean, and witty, Severus Snape was in his essentials the same wizard who’d dissected her ego into tiny evenly sized matchsticks of insecurity as a student. From a vantage changed by time and a much more even footing, his acerbic humour paired with his dark, perceptive eyes were utterly </span>
  <em>
    <span>compelling</span>
  </em>
  <span>.  </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>She’d let silence fill the space too long. As he had every other time she’d given him an opening, Snape showed no mercy. </span>
</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/>
<p><br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Severus let a feral smile slip across his face.  “Pray tell, Granger, what ludicrous plan have you conjured up for fundraising this time?” After a beat, he asked, “Are we to knit?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The cheeky titters from the side of the table undoubtedly came from Rolanda and Pomona, which he ignored. His glittering eyes were firmly fixed upon Granger’s face, which had blossomed into a delightful shade of scarlet.  Severus couldn’t help himself, she made it far too easy to get a rise out of her. Shooting a barb or two, especially when Granger was on her sanctimonious Gryffindor high horse, was one of his most satisfying pastimes.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Knitting?” a no-nonsense voice asked from the seat beside the red-faced Arithmancy Professor.  </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“A joke,” Granger gritted through her teeth.  She shook her head, her curls flaring out into the space around her, and faced her American seatmate.  “Referencing a folly from my schooldays.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Severus’ gaze slid to the grey-haired older woman, a good two decades older than the Headmistress herself. It was quite a coup for Minerva to snag her as this year’s visiting Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor.  The legend of the position’s curse persisted, and the Board had given up trying to permanently fill the vacancy long ago. Tina’s expectations for her students were particularly brutal, and her methodology blunt and refreshingly straightforward. In spite of her rough American manners (which bordered on outright arrogance), he couldn’t help but admire her. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Not so long ago for you, pet.” Tina turned slowly, catching everyone’s eyes at the table as she said, “</span>
  <span>At Ilvermony we’d never make light of the plight of children, or the lack of funds for such a necessary solution.”  </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Severus felt the sting of embarrassment when her gaze captured his own and held it.  He briefly wondered how much innate mind-magic she possessed if her sister’s renowned skills had been any indication. Queenie Goldstein, a national treasure, was born with a rare talent, and her skills remained unrivalled to this day. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Buoyed by the support, Granger smiled widely as if </span>
  <span>she was a Kneazle that got the cream.   “I am pleased to say that you won’t be required to knit, Professor Snape.”  Granger’s eyes snapped back to his in silent challenge.  </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Severus leaned back into his seat, crossed his arms, and raised one eyebrow for she had won her point. As she worked herself into a ramble, he turned his attention inward, for he already knew this project, whatever it was would be maddening, unpleasant, and ultimately unavoidable. Fundraising in its essentials was a bloodsport not suitable for serious educators. Add a Gryffindor tactician at the forefront of the advancing line, and one would really need to don a suit of armour to protect oneself from the battle ahead.  Severus spared a glance at the witch as she gestured enthusiastically with her hands.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>As a probationary Professor, Hermione Granger had blown into the Staff Room with the power of an Anemoi for her very first meeting.  Indefatigable and acquiescent, she commanded her space and was desperate for approval. In short, she had been irritating to the highest degree.  He was just now beginning to forget about the Longest Staff Meeting That Ever Was that had occurred during her first three months. Her list of New Business had been as long as her Potions O.W.L. and just as tedious and rote.  He had briefly considered jinxing Minerva’s bladder to move things along but was saved from following through by Filius’ raucous snoring. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Unquestionably in the intervening years, Granger honed her skills and now tortured him in ways that looked purely innocent on the surface, leaving her above reproach.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Of course, she had matured and now was less likely to publicly share her opinion on every point. When she did so, her contributions were carefully crafted and </span>
  <em>
    <span>intriguing</span>
  </em>
  <span>.  Severus found himself inexplicably anticipating their scholarly conversations over meals.  When Granger wasn’t so bloody focused on impressing everyone, her innovative theories were a welcome addition to his own.  </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>When they entered a heated debate, he relished the fiery spark that lit up her eyes. This danger thrilled him viscerally. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>It wasn’t lost on him that they were two of the youngest teachers on staff at Hogwarts. He wasn’t the only one who struggled to separate the adult witch from their memories of her as a student. He reflected that it didn’t hurt that Granger filled out her womanly shape in ways Severus was just now allowing himself to appreciate.  And that hair… he wanted to snag an amber curl around his pale finger. This temptation tortured him on the regular when she frequently rudely encroached upon his space at the High Table.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Minerva’s bright voice interrupted his ruminations, like the sudden appearance of a manned lighthouse in a foggy bay, “What a splendid idea, Hermione. My thanks to Tina for proving to be such a valuable resource of inspiration as well.”  Minerva bowed towards the older woman. “Let’s take it to a vote. All in favour?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>A chorus of ‘Ayes’ rang around the space.  Severus added his indifferent assent.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Granger clapped her hands together in pleasure, her eyes glowing with gratitude.  “Oh, this will be wonderful! I’ll write to Hagrid, he’ll be able to supply us with plenty of spruces.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Spruces?  </span>
  </em>
  <span>Immediately, Severus realised that he should have been paying closer attention.  </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He peeked at </span>
  <span>Aurora Sinistra’s neatly-written </span>
  <span>notes beside him.  Severus’ eyes widened when he discovered what Granger proposed: a Festival of Trees.  Apparently, it was an American tradition of decorating pine trees in themes and people could purchase them, with the proceeds donated to a worthy cause.  Such as funding a Muggleborn Liaison. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Oh, he didn’t like this one bit. Knitting was a viable option after all. Didn’t Dumbledore enjoy pattern work?  </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>It was too late to take back his assent, he had already given it. There was nothing he could have said to talk this back, the worth of her cause was unassailable. Minerva dismissed everyone, putting the discussion to bed with a finality that left no room for argument.  </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Fuck me.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/>
<p><br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione was elated as she surveyed the circle of people who she considered friends, nay family. She had a Quest, and allies that she knew she could count upon, and it was delightful to see her enthusiasm reflected back to her. A smile from Poppy. A nod from Tina. A hand on her shoulder in silent support from Hooch. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>She shouldn’t have been disappointed or even surprised by Professor Snape’s disinterest. Her mood deflated a fraction as she studied the knot of misanthropic contradiction wrapped in industrial gauge wool protective robes. Tension weighed his shoulders down as he hunched to surreptitiously read </span>
  <span>Sinistra’s</span>
  <span> notes. Hermione’s heart sunk a little further when he let slip a fleeting expression of surprise, subtle as it was - a widening of his eyes, a stillness.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The Astronomy Professor stood and pocketed her notebook, leaving Snape to stare at the empty spot. When he did move, the abruptness made Hermione gasp. Maybe he hadn’t noticed? </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>A pointed glare told her otherwise. Snape held her gaze long enough that something vital in her chest began to wobble in giddy consternation. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Before she could think of anything to say, he spun neatly on his heel and stalked out of the room in a black cloud of floating robes. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>When storm clouds leave the sky should brighten, but to her, the room was that much darker in his wake.  How did Snape do that? </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The Headmistress spoke from her elbow. “I wouldn’t worry, dear. He hates Christmas. As sure as the nights are long, you can depend on Severus to be particularly miserable.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>A glint off of McGonagall’s thistle brooch stirred an idea deep in Hermione’s brain, just a tiny spark of inspiration. Something she’d read long ago in a Potions Journal. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Perhaps she might be able to change things for the dour man. Yule, Christmas, or Chanukah; all agreed that it wasn’t right to let anyone suffer. Even the darkest corners of humanity should feel the warmth of happiness and renewal, for hope shone on all in the longest and darkest time of the year. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Holding onto that spark, Hermione answered, “Thanks, Minerva. I have some ideas I want to explore.” She’d have to go to the library tonight. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Chuckling, the Headmistress shooed Hermione away. “I have no doubt. Off with you. You’ve your hands quite full.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione missed the twinkle in Minerva’s eye as she bent to place a kiss onto the soft, powdery cheek of her favourite teacher. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Minerva murmured to her retreating back, “Good luck, lass.” </span>
