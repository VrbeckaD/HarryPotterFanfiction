    <p>She had run all the way from platform 9 3/4 and stood in the middle of platform two at King's Cross Station and realized that she had missed her parents' train; it had been the last train of the evening and she would have to wait for the next Chunnel rail to Paris. Disgruntled, Hermione Granger made her way to the information kiosk hoping that someone would still be available to assist her. As she approached, she saw the closed sign and looked at the hours: 6:45 AM to 8:30 PM. She glanced at her watch and saw that the time was 8:37. Tears filled her eyes and she pulled her trunk behind her as she listened to Crookshanks share his unhappiness and meow mournfully from the confines of his carrier as well as the stale Christmas music being piped through the speakers. She looked out the large windows and saw that was raining hard outside and stopped by one of the many gift shops and purchased an umbrella for her walk toward The Leaky Cauldron. Hopefully, she would be able to let a room for the night. She made her way through the crowds toward the side street where the old pub was located and walked the pavement toward the heavy oak door and opened it, closed her umbrella and stepped inside. She looked up and her heart sank as she saw at least a hundred people milling about the pub. She approached the bar and flagged Tom the innkeeper, down.</p><p>"Excuse me Tom?"</p><p>"Happy Christmas, Miss Granger! How are you?"</p><p>"Thank you Tom. I've been better, thanks. Would you by any chance have any available rooms for the night? My parents train left without me and I'm stranded here in London until the morning."</p><p>Her face fell when he frowned and shook his head. "No my dear, I'm terribly sorry. We're completely full up. I don't even have any students boarding over that you could room with."</p><p>She closed her eyes and nodded her head. "Alright, thank you." She turned on her heel and headed for the door, with no idea where she could go.</p><p>"Miss Granger, wait!" Tom came from around the bar and approached her, wiping his hands on a towel, then slinging it over his shoulder. "Perhaps you should inform the Headmistress of your situation? I'm certain that she could come up with something?"</p><p>Hermione shook her head. "There is no one there save Professor Snape and Mister Filch and if you please, I will sleep in the alley before I contact one of them!"</p><p>Tom smiled and nodded. "I understand, but you're--"</p><p>"I'll be fine. I have one other place that I can try. Thank you though."</p><p>"Alright," he said uneasily. "You take care!"</p><p>"I will. Happy Christmas," she replied as she opened the door and was assaulted by the cold air.</p><p>She knew that she didn't have enough money to hail a taxi for home, so she headed for the closest place that she knew she would be able to stay; where, if she was lucky, she might even be able to get a hot meal...Number 12 Grimmauld Place.</p><p>She quickly left the Leaky behind her and then passed King's Cross station, as she walked along the pavement, pulling her heavy trunk behind her. She was damp from walking the rain and had felt the temperatures dropping. Soon, she was walking through a light snowfall and she pulled her muggle coat tighter to her as the snow had grown thicker and heavier. She had dropped Crookshanks off at the boarding kennel, where at least he might enjoy his holiday being pampered. Within forty-five minutes, she was standing in front of the hidden entrance to the Headquarters to the Order of the Phoenix. Looking around in all directions, she withdrew her wand and tapped on the wall of the building three times and stepped back, still keeping an eye out for anyone who might come her way. Moments later, the house row home came into view and she opened the door and walked inside, where she heard loud heavy rock music blaring from downstairs...at least someone would be inside and she knew that it most likely was Sirius Black and that he'd be alone. She inhaled deeply; he was cooking something that smelled wonderful and she left her trunk at the front door and approached the back of the house, removing her coat as she walked along the narrow corridor.</p><p>"Hello?"</p><p>She laughed as she heard Sirius's voice raised in song and realized that the man could actually sing. Kreacher eyed her from the top of the second story landing and he stomped down the stairs.</p><p>"Hello Kreacher," she said pleasantly. She had no reason to be pleasant; in fact, she was quite unhappy and quite chilled from her long walk through the streets of London. "Would you please tell Sirius that I'm here and that I need a place to stay?"</p><p>"Filthy mudblood! Tell him yourself," he spat.</p><p>"Rude! Fine, I will!"</p><p>As Kreacher insolently moved past her, he <em>accidentally</em> cracked her ankle hard with his broom stick and caused her to cry out. He then looked at his broomstick and realized that he had broken it; the end of it was splintered and he cursed at her; he was only silent when they heard Sirius's voice raised in alarm.</p><p>"Hey! Who's there!"</p><p>"Sirius! It's me, Hermione Granger!"</p><p>Sirius flew up the stairs with his wand brandished and fury in his eyes as if he had been expecting an ambush. When he saw that she was seated on the step, her hand was clasped at her ankle and his face softened. He looked past her and saw that she was alone, then returned his wand to its holster at his hip. "And what brings you to my humble abode might I ask?"</p><p>She relayed her adventures in the long corridor and watched as his face showed more and more sympathy for her misadventures. Only when she told him about Kreacher's attitude and that he had purposefully hit her with his broom and he noticed the piece of broken broom stick nestled at the baseboard behind her, did his features darken.</p><p>"Oh did he now," he fumed.</p><p>"Yes, I'm sorry but I thought you ought to know."</p><p>He nodded. "Mmm. Let's have a look at your ankle, shall we?"</p><p>He knelt down and pulled off her shoe and then her soaked sock. He saw that her ankle was already quite swollen and red at the area of impact. He also saw a few splinters of wood that needed to be removed as well. Sirius breathed in deeply. "This needs ice," he said.</p><p>"You think so?"</p><p>He nodded. "Mmhmm. Come on," he said and he placed his arm beneath hers and helped her hobble downstairs toward the kitchen and sat her down at the closest chair to the entrance. He knelt down and removed her sock and saw dried blood at the area of impact. "Damn it, I'll need tweezers to get this wood out. Fuck."</p><p>"Does it look bad?"</p><p>"Not all that bad. I've certainly seen worse, but we're not talking about me. I'm so sorry that he did this to you, Hermione; don't worry, I'll get with him. I've got something upstairs that will take care of this. Stay put, I'll be right back." He pushed a plate of fresh oatmeal and raisin biscuits toward her and invited her to help herself as he trotted up the stairs to the bathroom where his first aide kit was located.</p><p>"Did you make these?"</p><p>He stuck his head out of the bathroom and into the corridor. "What!"</p><p>"I said, did you bake these biscuits! They're quite good!"</p><p>He trotted back down the stairs and smiled. "I did," he said. "Bet ya didn't know I'm a wiz in the kitchen, did you?" He knelt down and sat on the floor Indian-style and placed her foot gently into his lap and went to work pulling out the splintered wood. He knew that he would have to keep her engaged so that she might not feel the pain so keenly...it was going to hurt.</p><p>She smiled and chuckled nervously. "Well, <em>oww!</em>"</p><p>"I'm sorry Pet," he hissed and then looked into her eyes. "You were saying?"</p><p>"Oh yes. Well, obviously you are a wizard, as I am a witch and yes we are in the kitchen, and so..."</p><p>He looked up at her and raised his brow as he wiped off the blood that had already begun drying with a clean, wet cloth.</p><p>"Erm, what I meant to say was, <em>no, I had no idea</em>."</p><p>Sirius barked a laugh and shook his head.Â  She thought his eyes positively twinkled when he genuinely laughed...perhaps it was how his nose wrinkled? What ever it was, she thought him quite handsome and wondered why it never occurred to her before? As he cleaned on the wound, he blew on it and she felt far more comforted than she had wanted to; he did the same with the antiseptic and when she hissed, he grimaced and whispered his apologies. He then reached into the little basket and pulled out a muggle bandage and held it up. "Tada!"</p><p>She laughed and watched as he tore the paper, and pulled it apart gently and removed the little plastic bandage. He peeled the paper from one side of the bandage and placed it on her skin. He noticed that she shaved her legs and he smiled. He didn't think that many witches did that, although he wished that they did. He placed the other half of the bandage on her ankle and then placed his hands flat on his thighs and looked up at her, then smiled finally. "All done," he said. "Now that wasn't so bad, was it?"</p><p>She blushed. "No, not at all. Thank you."</p><p>"You're quite welcome. Say, have you had any supper yet? I realize that it's a bit late."</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>He nodded. "Ah. Well, you're certainly welcome to share my supper with me. It's just a simple roast of beef, potatoes and peas, fairly simple really. I'm afraid I don't have any pumpkin juice, or ah, anything else you might like. But I've got coffee and tea and," he lowered his head and his voice, "as well as all manner of liquor, ale and wine in the cellar, none of which <em>you</em> can have."</p><p>"Why, because I'm under age?"</p><p>He stood and held out his hands for her as he shook his head, pulling her up. "Nope."</p><p>"Why then?"</p><p>"Because you've got a bleeder. It needs to clot properly and alcohol will do nothing for that."</p><p>"Oh yes, that's right. It thins the blood."</p><p>"Exactly." He smiled and nodded.</p><p>"So, if I weren't injured--"</p><p>"You could have what ever you wanted. Providing of course, that you didn't let slip that I let you have it."</p><p>"Oh, I would never tell!"</p><p>His smiled turned into a mischievous grin. "I thought as much."</p><p>He had helped her to a better seat near the oven where she could keep warm as she saw that her school uniform was soaked through as well as her hair. He suggested that she take a hot shower and get warm, then by the time she was finished, supper would be nearly ready. He turned to the icebox and withdrew a few pieces of ice and placed them in a clean towel and positioned it gently on the swollen side of her ankle and she breathed in sharply. Once again, he hissed and muttered his apologies.</p><p>She agreed and moved to hobble up the stairs only then realizing that she had to hobble up at least two flights just to get to where the bedrooms were; he followed behind her with her trunk, keeping a respectful distance between them. He closed his eyes tightly when he finally noticed just how short her skirt actually was and when he did open his eyes, he was very nearly on her as she had stopped on the stairs to remove her shoe as it had become tight on her foot due to the swelling. He realized that his face was very nearly beneath her skirt.</p><p>"Ooh! Sorry!"</p><p>He craned his neck to look up at her. "Uh huh." He chuckled when he saw that her face had turned scarlet. "Never would have pegged you for yellow and pink flowered knickers," he said. He pulled his head back, lifting the fabric of her skirt and caught a glimpse of her rounded bum. He exhaled quickly and tossed the hair back that had fallen into his eyes.</p><p>"I usually wear white," she confessed.</p><p>Sirius nodded and looked away.</p><p>"I'm sorry! You really didn't need to know that, did you?"</p><p>He shook his head and licked his lips and then pulled them inward and finally looked up at her. "No," he said. "But since you mentioned it, I always pegged you for solid colors, probably white? Or perhaps, pink? Or possibly powder blue or lilac? The flowers don't suit you at all."</p><p>"Sometimes," she offered.</p><p>He nodded. He thought it refreshing that she was mature enough to engage him in a personal discussion, the topic being as silly as it was.</p><p>"What color are your shorts," she asked brazenly.</p><p>He looked up at her and grinned as he leaned on the handrail, still holding on to her trunk. "Who said I wear any?"</p><p>"Oh."</p><p>"Haven't for a very long time," he confessed as he smiled unashamedly.</p><p>"Since," she began and ended in a whisper as she leaned in, <em>"Azkaban?"</em></p><p>He shook his head and looked into her chocolate-brown eyes. "No, longer than that," he said.</p><p>She eyed him hard and tilted her head.</p><p>"Since I was sixteen. You see, the less I have to worry about with regard to clothing whilst performing the animagus charm, the better."</p><p>"That's a long time," she said.</p><p>He nodded. "Yes it is."</p><p>"Makes perfect sense though."</p><p>He nodded again and smiled. "Yes it does." He winked his eye. "And while I'd love nothing more than to chat you up on the stairs about the color of your underwear and the non-existence of mine, I do have a roast in the oven. And besides, your trunk is getting quite heavy."</p><p>Her face turned scarlet. "Oh yes! Of course! I'm sorry, Sirius!"</p><p>He nodded. "Of course. It's all right, 'Mione. No harm done."</p><p>Hermione continued to hobble up the stairs, pulling her weight up with the handrail and Sirius followed with her trunk. She arrived at the top of the staircase and moved so that he could pass her; she had no idea where he would put her for the night. He set the trunk down and reached into the front pocket of his jeans and withdrew a set of keys.</p><p>"You know, I feel very much like a bloody inn keeper! This is a lovely room and believe it or not, it's actually clean as well. Tada!" he said as he opened the door, feeling the cold air instantly.</p><p>She laughed at his banter and he reached in and flicked a light switch on the wall that operated the oil-lamp sconces on the wall above the fireplace mantle that lit instantly creating a minuscule bit of light in the large room. He produced his wand and lit the fireplace. He picked up the trunk again and walked it into the room and then cast lumos to light the bedside table lamps. Together, they created a warm comforting glow to the room.</p><p>She entered the room behind him, hopping on one foot and he looked down and grimaced. "Oooh. It's really swelling up. Damn it." Placing the trunk down, he held out his arm for her to take and he led her to the bed to sit down. When she hopped to turn around, she lost her balance and reached out for his other arm to steady her, only to lose her balance again and she fell onto the bed, taking him with her. She blinked her eyes at him as he looked into them and smiled.</p><p>"If only you were ten years older," he whispered to himself.</p><p>"What?"</p><p>He shook his head. "Nothing." He rolled over next to her and leaned on his elbow, pointing out a tasseled cord by the fireplace that rang a butler's bell down in the kitchen and he instructed her to ring it when she was out of her school uniform and into something more comfortable; he would be up to fetch her and help her back down the stair case. His body was right up on hers and she felt the stiffened bulge through the fabric of his jeans. He seemed to pay no attention to it and so she pretended not to notice. Finally he stood up and pulled her into a sit on the edge of the bed. She glanced at the zipper of his jeans and looked up into his gray eyes.</p><p>"I'm sorry," she said again.</p><p>"You know what? I swear that if I hear you say, 'I'm sorry' one more time, I'll turn you into a brandy snifter, fill you up and drink you dry."</p><p>"I'm--I <em>apologize?</em>"</p><p>He rolled his eyes and shook his head, grumbling a half-hearted growl. "Ring the bell," he said, pointing. He chuckled as he shook his head and left her to her privacy.</p><p>Hermione peeled off her damp clothing and lay it all across the fireplace screen and then opened her trunk and withdrew the first nightgown she came across; a pink baby doll adorned with satin ribbon and white lace that had been newly purchased for her trip. It was fairly short and left very little to the imagination, but it was all she had brought with her. She wondered if her mother had made the purchase on purpose or if it was because she merely thought it was very feminine and quite pretty? She tossed it on the bed and withdrew her housecoat and slippers. After removing her socks and her bra she hobbled over to the screen and placed them there as well. She looked down at her underwear and decided to find something that would be more comfortable, since he had mentioned the flowered print. She donned the nightgown and a fresh pair of clean white bikini-cut underwear and hobbled toward the cord and pulled on it. She turned and donned her housecoat and pulled it tightly around her body and secured it with the fabric tie. She had only slipped her feet into her slippers, when he knocked on the door.</p><p>"Yes," she said.</p><p>He opened the door and stuck his head in. "Ya decent?"</p><p>"Quite," she replied.</p><p>He shook his head and laughed. "Damn! Missed it!"</p><p>She fought a grin as he entered the room and held out his hands to pull her up from the bed. Forgetting his own strength for a moment, he pulled her up a little too quickly and she fell into him. He stepped back, only to step forward again to steady her. They were so close to one another, an amoeba wouldn't have been able to slip between them.</p><p>"I say Mister Black, is that a wand in your pocket, or are you simply happy to see me?"</p><p>He raised his brow. "Yes," he said truthfully.</p><p>She smiled. "That's nice," she said sweetly.</p><p>"Indeed," he whispered.</p><p>"Is it bad that my ankle burns?"</p><p>He nodded. "Yeah," he said quietly. "Let's get you down stairs. Unless you'd rather stay up here?"</p><p>She grinned. "And would you stay up here and entertain me with some of your stories then?"</p><p>"I could," he said. Then he frowned. "But then our dinner would burn. Also too, wouldn't be appropriate. Would it?"</p><p>"I suppose not," she said. "And I'd hate for your dinner to burn."</p><p>He moved to stand next to her and took her hand in his and placed it on the back of his neck and wound his free arm around her waist, then practically carried her from the room to the stairs. As they stood at the top of the steps, he realized that while he relished the touch of a female's hand at the nape of his bare neck, they would most certainly fall the entire length of the stair well. "Put your arm around my waist," he said.</p><p>"You could just levitate me down?"</p><p>He looked sideways into her eyes. "Where would the fun be in that?"</p><p>She nodded and giggled. "Right-o, you're the boss!"</p><p>He nodded. "Uh huh. Don't you dare forget it."</p><p>They made it to half way down the stairs when Sirius' foot stepped on the hem of her housecoat and after he released her to steady himself, she sighed hard.</p><p>"Oh bother," she said and pulled off the housecoat and tossed it to the bottom of the stairs.</p><p>He glanced with appreciation at the sight of the slight cleavage the garment provided him and he felt the air leave his lips. "Oh Hermione," he whispered. "I really wish you hadn't done that."</p><p>"But we both would have fallen," she replied.</p><p>"That's not what I'm talking about," he continued as he moved to stand on the steps before her. "Don't you have any long tee shirts with you, or perhaps pajamas with pants? I know you have them."</p><p>"Not with me," she said. "Those things are at the Weasley's. Mother said that she has new winter clothes for me and to pick only this. I wasn't even supposed to bring my dressing gown, but I did anyway."</p><p>He nodded and closed his eyes. What he really wanted to do was to touch her...it had been so long since he had touched a woman; he had to remind himself that she was but a young girl of fifteen. He breathed in deeply just once and opened his eyes to look into hers. "Stay right here," he said as he gently squeezed her hands.</p><p>"Where are you going," she asked.</p><p>"I'll be right back," he replied.</p><p>She nodded as he moved past her and ran up three flights of stairs and returned with a long sleeved flannel shirt that had been his when he was her age. It would provide enough coverage so that he might not be so easily distracted.</p><p>"I'm going to take you to the dining room and when I leave to bring up dinner, I would appreciate it if you kindly change into this please?" He held out the shirt to her. "I do still have some of my old pajamas, but they're far too big for you. They're too long, you see and under the circumstances, well, it's bad enough that we'll have to roll up half the sleeves just to get to your wrists. I daresay that you wouldn't be able to walk at all."</p><p>She nodded her head as she looked into his eyes. He shifted his weight and moved a bit closer to her. He could smell her perfume that masked her true scent and since Padfoot heightened that particular capability, he was easily aware of it.</p><p>"I must confess, it's been a very long time since I've been alone in the company of a female. <em>Any</em> female. And truth be told, I've always had a bit of a soft spot for you, 'Mione."</p><p>"I understand," she replied quietly. She took in a quick breath and opened her mouth to speak, but he placed his finger on her lips and found them to be quite soft and he bit his lower lip.</p><p>"Don't say it," he whispered as he raised his brow as he stared at the little bow that was her mouth. He looked into her eyes again.</p><p>"I won't." She shook her head, her warm breath reaching his finger, then his wrist and the rest of his hand. His ring finger and his thumb traced the line of her jaw as if they had a mind of their own.</p><p>Finally, he came to his senses and he tagged the tip of her nose with the same finger and smiled, then winked his eye. "Come on," he said quietly.</p><p>His loins burned as he placed his arm around her once again and helped her down the stairs and to the dining room. He pulled out a chair from the table and sat her down gently, then handed her the shirt and her housecoat.</p><p>"I'll return shortly."</p><p>"Alright thank you," she said quietly.</p><p>"You're welcome," he replied.</p><p>Â </p>
