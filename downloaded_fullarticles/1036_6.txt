  <span>“Do you want children?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Draco posed the question like the response was going to be explosive, shocked, or incredulous. His eyes had averted from Harry’s long before they both got home that evening, and even for such a momentous inquiry, Draco couldn’t gather the steel to see the expression on his husband’s face. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry put down a few magical creature figurines he’d been attempting to bring to life, a surprise birthday present every Hogwarts student of Defense Against The Dark Arts had come to expect. When he realized what Draco had asked, Harry’s gaze raked over his tense shoulders and Draco’s means of sitting that made him seem small, so small. He still hadn’t made eye contact. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The couch gave an exhausted sigh as Harry rose from his seat and strode to stand in front of the blonde, who was laid vertical on their antique chaise and decidedly not speaking anymore. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Harry crouched and rose a hand to run through Draco’s long unbraided hair, but the other flinched.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span> A few long moments passed.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Of course- yeah, of course. I’ve always wanted a family.” Harry frowned. “Any particular reason you’re asking now?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco slowly brought himself to a full sitting position before standing up and wandering the room to fixate his mind on something else, fluttering the living room’s billowing curtains closed, pondering on the strange new scent of age settling upon Grimmauld Place, fixing back sofa cushions and frowning to himself. “I love Teddy. Do you understand that, Harry? I would do anything for him.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I know. So would I.” A questioning sound attached itself to the end of Harry’s statement.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“And I want to take care of him, for as long as he needs us-” He stopped fiddling to cross his arms over himself, squeezing himself tight. “But when I ask if you want children, I don’t want it to seem like Teddy isn’t enough- because he is. He’s more than enough. And I don’t want you to doubt that. Because I love him very, very much.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Harry crossed the room from around the couch and stood solidly before Draco. With one hand, Harry brought the other’s chin up to look at him, seeing trepidation, shame, and the smallest bought of fear in his eyes. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I understand… I perfectly understand.” Draco’s expression relaxed like a rose blooming, mouth smoothing out and eyes widening a fraction at what Harry continued on to say. “I want that with you, as many times as you want. As many times as I can have it.” Then, a smile was breaking out on the brunette’s face, “But you know, we do have to prepare for something like this.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Draco grasped the back of his husband’s head, dragging his fingers through tangled locks to bring the other’s head down, and kissed him until they had to stop for breath.</span>
