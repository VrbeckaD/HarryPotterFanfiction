    <p>Konnichiwa! My name is Sashimi Katana Yuki-chan and I am 16 years old and a student at Hogwarts the English Wizard School of England! My house is Hufflepuff and I am sooo happy to be here bc Hufflepuffle is so fluffy and therefore fits me super! You might have noticed that I like Japanese words, but not only that! I looove the japanese culture in general, that‘s why I changed my name to Sashimi Katana Yuki-chan. No, I will not tell you my old name xD. But you can call me Sashimi-chan! (Or senpai hehe) I actually identify as Japanese as well so pls respect that, sank chuuu. ^^/ </p><p>Anyway today we have our first day bacc at Hogwarts and I am super duper hyped! I will see my super lovely friends again, they all have top grades and are the best in school and we totally are the coolest in this school and the only ones who rlly read books AND understand them hehe (thats yallzzz book club!yaas books sugoi desu nee!)<br/>I enter the great hall and sit at the Hufflepuff table. There is already a boy called Basil, I call him Baesil because he is just so kawaii and soft &gt;&lt; We are bffs.<br/>´hi Baesil. How were your holidays? I hope sugoi!´<br/>´hello Sashimi. They were good. I painted.`<br/>Baesil always paints or draws, he is really good at it. And he also draws Manga yeeey! ^^/<br/>Especially yaoi gehe, blush, and he gives me drawings when he´s done. I love my sinning bbys &gt;///&lt;<br/>One day he want to be a magical painter and create pictures that come alive.<br/>´cool!´<br/>Just then my friends come in and come over to my table. We are all in Huffle, yaay! They sit down and we wait a bit until everyone was there and then Dumbledor (Senpaiiiiiiii) came up and spoke.<br/>´Welcome to Hogwarts! I hope this year will be super teaching and fun for you.´<br/>He shot us all a smile and his teeth blinked in the candlelight.<br/>And then everyone clapped.<br/>The tables suddenly were full of yummy food and my friends and I screeched excitedly.<br/>‚Itadakimasuu!‘<br/>We ate a bit, i ate much cake because I really love cake! Then I remembered something.<br/>´Oh, minna-saan! I nearly forgot!´<br/>I opened my pastel-blue leather bag that I always have with me and gave everyone a glittery flower-crown in yellow and black. Thy were all super happy and giggled but suddenly Dumbledoor spoke again.<br/>´Hey, i forgot to tell you that we will have a new student. baka me. His name is…. Dorian Gray and he comes from Beauxbatons, the french wizarding school of france.´<br/>there was silence and everyone waited for the new boy to appear but nothing happened. <br/>Then suddenly the gate slammed open and blinding light screamed into the hall. Everyone shielded their eyes and when we looked again there were red roses raining from the sky! <br/>Two boys stood in the door.<br/>ONE WAS HENRy Wotton the Slytherin Lord, people call him, he is super mean and bad and no one likes him. Except for the emo slytherins of course -_-. Also he cheats on his girlfriend Victoria who is a Hufflepuff1!!1 Super no-go!!<br/>The other boy no one knew. We alll gasped. <br/>He was suuuper pretty and perfect, I felt my heart doki doki in my chest and let out a giggle, blushing very hard. He was literally a prince!<br/>He wore a Hogwartts Uniform but it was dark-scarlet and had black lace all over it, he also wore a flower-white button up shirt with ruffles and a bowtie around the pale neck and black pants and knee high boots (nose bleed, there is my SON). He looked a bit like Levi from Shingeki no kyojin but with shiny and angel-like blonde hair! And sky-blue eyes. Like a summer sky. With no clouds…<br/>I squealed loudly and grabbed Baesil´s arm then looked at his face. He looked at the stranger with wide eyes and a pale blush and sparkles in his irises.<br/>´Doki-doki´<br/>I WHISPERED into his ear and he jumped and became red like a tomato.<br/>´Wh- wha—? n-no!´<br/>I giggled and looked up at the new guy just as he passed me by. Our eyes met and-<br/>I blushed and gasped. He stopped and looked at me, then smiled beautifully and took my hand and kissed it! &gt;////&lt;<br/>´Hi.´He said sexily. (jfnjfndkvsd so schmexyyyy xDDDD) ´I´m Dorian Gray.  You´re cute.´<br/>My friends gasped but baesil looked sadly at me, then turned away. I didn‘t notice however because I was so obsessed with Dorian!<br/>Henry grabbed Dorian‘s arm and pulled him away from me, meanie, and towards the Slytherin table.<br/>‚Guyssss.... I think I‘m in love!!“<br/>I whispered to my friends with red cheeks. We all giggled excitedly.</p>
