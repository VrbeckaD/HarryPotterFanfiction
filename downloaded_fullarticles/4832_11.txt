    <p>"You're wrong!" Harry shouted.<br/> <br/> How could Draco say all that about Dumbledore? He was the greatest wizard of all time, without a shadow of a doubt. <br/> <br/> "What Goyle?" Draco demanded "There's someone worse than Dumbledore?" <br/> <br/> "Well... Ummmm..." Harry stuttered has Ron cast him a weary look.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Goyle?"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"HARRY POTTER!" Harry shouted, stumbling over the "T's"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Ha" Draco scoffed "you're not wrong there"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Yeah" Ron chipped in "with his stupid friends"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"And his blind faith in Dumbledore" Harry said.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Hmm" Draco continued "and how he always hangs around with that giant hairy oaf Hagrid, or that stupid owl he loves so much."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Boy, Gotta hate him" harry said.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Yeah" Draco sighed "the way everyone praises him like a saint, the way Grainger thinks she has a chance with him."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ron coughed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco ignored him, for all he knew Crabbe had just eaten too much cake.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Or…or… or the way he smiles and his eyes do the thing and how he constantly flicks his hair out of his eyes, yet refuses to get a haircut, how his hands are just the perfect size for mine and the fact he fastens his tie different to everyone else but he still pulls it off and… and…”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry stared at him, of course Draco had no idea it was him. Harry was just trying to take in all he was hearing, he thought Draco despised him. Did he still despise him?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“And the fact that he was born with this great destiny that he can’t escape, that he didn’t even choose. There’s no getting out of it, he has no say in the matter and I … I just want nothing better than to just take him away from all that and live! Just live! Us two- Us two against the world.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ron shifted but Harry avoided his gaze.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You two must be sick of hearing this but it’s true. I tell you all the time because I can’t tell anyone else but I want it.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco ran his fingers through his gelled hair until all the white blonde strands came out of their slick position and fell loosely around his face.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Fucking Merlin, I want it.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco had to blink back the tears.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“But he hates me of course, he would never look twice at me and I’ll have to find some fucking pureblood girl eventually. Probably picked out by my father so I can live my life exactly like him and Potter will either have everything he ever wanted…or be dead.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And then Draco couldn’t stop the tears anymore as Ron reached over and took Harry’s hand, Harry then looked at him for the first time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Scar!” Ron whispered as the lightning bolt appeared on Goyle’s confused face.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry looked and Crabbe’s ginger-forming hairline.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Hair!” he whispered back.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>Shit</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Then Harry stood up and marched towards Draco. He had no idea what he was going to do, either slap him, or just run out of the common room.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Goyle, what?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry began to look more and more like himself and Draco immediately realised what was happening.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He quickly wiped his tears away but fresh ones were still falling.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Oh my- Harry, I swear… I never meant any of those things, oh my- you weren’t mean to hear, Merlin, I-"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And then Harry did something no-one expected, not even him.</p>
<p>He grabbed Draco by the robe and pulled him into a long overdue kiss.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em><strong></strong>Bloody Merlin!</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry didn’t know how long he had been craving this but Draco had been waiting for so long.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It tasted of tears and angst.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco’s lips were cold, freezing almost.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He did a thing where he brushed his lips softly over Harry’s own and then pushed harder with more passion and more aggression and ran his fingers through his hair.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ron was long-gone since then.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco seemed experienced to Harry, he wondered if it was because he had practised with others or just because he had been waiting for this moment for so long.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco’s eyed hit the floor as they pulled away, so Harry gently lifted his face up, he kept his hand cupped around either side of Draco’s face on each of his cheeks.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Harry I-”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Shh Harry whispered as he wiped Draco’s tears of his perfectly symmetrical face.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco smiled, then frowned.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Um Harry, don’t think I will just forgive you for spying on me like that!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Wait a second! You made my life a living hell just to get my attention!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Only because I had to! And besides, it’s not like I could’ve got it any other way!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Well you’ve certainly captured my attention now” Harry smirked holding Draco’s elegant hands in his own.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Look Harry, I … This isn’t- I still have to- What I mean to say is that well this doesn’t change anything.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Draco! This changes everything!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Harry!” He began, then he stopped himself. He could put off the thoughts of his father and Voldemort and Harry’s “Boy who lived” duties for the moment. Right now he just wanted to be in the arms of his love, like he had wanted for so long.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Seriously though Harry, I never knew it could have been like this and I- Never would have… I mean I would’ve had to but I wouldn’t. I didn’t know that-”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I know Draco, I know” Harry smiled.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco sighed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You were right Draco.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Your hands do fit perfectly in mine.”</p>
