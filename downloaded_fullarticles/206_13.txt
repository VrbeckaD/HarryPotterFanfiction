  <strong>Chapter 1:</strong>
</p><p>Hadrian was in his 7th year at Hogwarts when he gets James Potters’s attention.</p><p>Hadrian was getting ready for his NEWTS and as a Ravenclaw, he was a little stressed. So when the marauders decide to prank the Ravenclaws he was beyond pissed. So he may have pranked them back a couple of times. But he didn’t catch James’ attention in tell he was seen defending Severus Snape in the library from some purebloods that looked scared for their lifes knowing that Hadrian was powerful enough that their parents would disown them for making him an enemy.</p><p><br/>
<strong>Chapter 2:</strong>
</p><p>When James Potter confronted Hadrian about spending time with Severus. Hadrian was confused about why did it matter, he didn't know James or care to know him. He knew the rumors about him being a bully and was in love with Lily Evans. And when he started to say how "Snivellus" was a bad influence on his innocent muggleborn mind. Which confused Hadrian even more, wasn't James a pureblood? Surely he had to hear about him, he knew other pureblood children had been informed about him but was James that disconnected to his Lord father that he wasn't informed too?</p>
