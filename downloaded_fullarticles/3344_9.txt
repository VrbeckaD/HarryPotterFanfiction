</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="left">"Harry?"</p><p>...</p><p>"<em>Harry?!</em>"</p><p>"Mate, you alright?"</p><p>Harry jumped as Ron's hand landed on his shoulder, startling him out of the one sided glaring competition he had been engaged since they had come down for breakfast.</p><p>"I'm fine," he responded dismissively.</p><p>He eyed the ghost of Tom Riddle warrily, but the apparition was ignoring him for now, which he should have been grateful for, he supposed, but the way he was looking at Ginny Weasley, who was seating farther down the Gryffindor table, was even more disturbing than how he'd been staring at Harry himself for the past few days.</p><p>"You haven't eaten anything," Ron remarked. Hermione nodded emphatically from the other side of the table, eyes wide in concern. She had put down her charms book, and Harry realized then that she had been the one trying to catch his attention earlier.</p><p>"Just not hungry," he mumbled.</p><p>His friends exchanged unconvinced glances, but let him be, Hermione reopening her book and Ron going back to his breakfast.</p><p>Riddle snickered - silent, as ever, but it was still clearly a snicker - twirling the heavy ring he was wearing around his finger.</p><p>The ring was new, Harry realized, squinting at the piece of jewelry in suspicion. But then again, a lot of things were "new" about Riddle's appearance.</p><p>He had looked older at first. Had been wearing a dark suit and an equally dark cape, both without any distinctive signs but elegant nonetheless - or maybe it was just the person wearing the clothes, Harry had thought. He doubted Tom Riddle could have looked inelegant even wearing a potato sac - but after a few days, he'd appeared just as he had in the Chamber of Secrets: a terribly smug looking fifteen or sixteen years old schoolboy in Slytherin robes.</p><p>Harry hadn't seen the change take place. He had just been confronted with the fact when he'd looked up from his potion essay one evening. And Riddle had just smiled with mirth at his perplexity, though he hadn't said anything. Then again he hadn't said a word since he had appeared, so that didn't meant much.</p><p>He wasn't a particularly menacing apparition, save, of course, for the ever present dread that came with knowing his identity, combined with the one created by the mystery of his presence. He was just... Hanging around. Lounging on furniture. Watching Harry.</p><p><em>Have I finally gone crazy?</em> Harry wondered. </p><p>Riddle winked at him then, and Harry tried to not react beyond nervously gnawing on his already worse for wear fingernails and the increasingly rapid tapping of his foot on the stone floor. Merlin he was a twitching mess lately.</p><p><em>No, it’s just another of Voldemort’s game</em><em>s</em>, he told himself for the hundredth time that week. A product of their connection, that the Dark Lord was somehow using against him - the unwanted proof that Snape was right, he was as abysmal in occlumancy than in potions. And he would not let himself be played with. That would please to many people far too much, if he started to doubt his own sanity. If he started to buy into the rumors that he was making things up, a maniacal that used his own deranged visions to attract attention… That was not him. He wasn’t a liar. He wasn’t a lunatic.</p><p>On the back of his hand, the words <em>"I must not tell lies"</em> itched, and he clenched his fist over his wand. He had barely let go of it those last few days, ready as he was to fire at Riddle if the apparition started to act up.</p><p>A loud noise came from the professor’s table. Umbridge's glass had exploded in her hands, provoking first a few surprised exclamations, then a scattered laughter at her face - she looked as if stupefied as she watched a mix of blood and pumpkin juice drip from her drenched fist - then silence to fall over the entire Hall. No one wanted to endure whatever punishment the toad would reserve for the person who had dared hex her.</p><p>Tom Riddle smiled.</p><p>A wave of nausea filled Harry. Had the apparition done this? But he wasn’t even corporeal! Or at least, Harry hadn’t seen him interact with the world around him beyond sitting – or leaning, or fucking <em>sprawling</em>, most of the time all over Harry’s things – and he wasn’t even visible! Surely what appeared to not being more than a mere vision couldn’t have the magical power necessary to make a glass explode on the other side of the Great Hall!</p><p>No, that must have been something else, maybe accidental magic, provoked by his own anger at the Inquisitor. Or maybe this didn’t even had anything to do with him. Maybe Umbridge’s screams about being hexed by a student weren’t unfounded. Merlin knew most of them, and Harry first, would have greatly enjoyed hexing the daylights out of her.</p><p>But even trying to rationalize this event wasn’t doing much to soothe his fraying nerves. Even his locket seemed to be affected, pulsating wildly against his skin, a trepidation Harry felt echo in his own heart, and he ran a trembling finger over his lucky charm through the open collar of his shirt, the contact of the cool metal doing what logical thought couldn’t, and he took a deep breath, <em>there is nothing to worry about</em>. Just the same weird stuff he had been dealing all his life.</p><p>Tom Riddle raised an eyebrow, the mocking expression on his face more eloquent than a thousand words would have been.</p><p>
  <em>"I WILL HAVE ORDER!" </em>
</p><p>Umbridge's shout caused Harry to look up, only to see that the Great Hall was emptying quicker than if someone had thrown a dungbomb in it.</p><p>"Let's go," Ron said through his last mouthful of eggs. He swallowed while Hermione gathered her books hastily. "Don't wanna be the last ones in there. Betcha she wouldn't even care that it wasn't us. She'll just punish anyone she can get her hands on."</p><p>Harry didn't need to be told twice, he bolted from the bench, picking up his bag, and followed his friends out of the Great Hall. One last glance behind told him that Umbridge was being fussed over by Madam Pomfrey, who winked at him as she caught his gaze on her. The nurse would distract the Inquisitor long enough that everyone would get safely to their classes or common room. What a wonderful woman. </p><p>And then there was Riddle, trailing behind Harry with a wide, satisfied grin, that gave Harry goosebumps. Seeing the Dark Lord so happy was never a good sign, illusion or not.</p><p>"Come on, you creep," he muttered. "Let's go to transfiguration." </p><p> </p>
