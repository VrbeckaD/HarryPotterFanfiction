    <p>
  <span>Sirius huffed in frustration. He’d snuck into the Hospital Wing after he saw Dumbledore leave, but he hadn’t been fast enough to reach Remus before Madame Pomfrey had administered a Sleeping Draught. Now he was crouched in the shadows like an idiot, waiting until he was sure the Healer had gone to bed. Once all was quiet, he pulled a chair next to Remus’s bed and resigned himself to a long wait - call it penance for what he’d done. He certainly deserved worse than this. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The rustling of the crisp, starched sheets woke him. Sirius raised his head to see Remus stirring at last. Obviously, he’d fallen asleep at some point. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Quite the vigil</span>
  </em>
  <span>, he thought bitterly. Sirius jumped to his feet and bent closer to Remus.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What are you doing here?” Remus asked hoarsely.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius couldn’t quite determine if his tone was cold or simply curious. “I wanted to- I mean, I thought maybe, I, ah,” he stammered incoherently and felt a blush creeping up his face. Why did Remus have this effect on him? If either of them should be feeling vulnerable, it should be the one lying bruised and bloody in a hospital bed. But Sirius felt exposed under Remus’s unwavering gaze, and this was definitely not the first time he’d been disarmed by the werewolf’s haunted gray eyes. He sighed, admitting defeat, “I can go if you want."</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No,” Remus said softly, “You can stay.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius let out a little, </span>
  <em>
    <span>oh</span>
  </em>
  <span>, of surprise. He’d already gathered himself to exit the Hospital Wing, fully expecting Remus would want nothing to do with him. He sat back down, but now that he’d been given permission to stay, shame and regret set in, blanketing them in silence like a thick layer of dust. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It was stupid,” he finally managed to get out.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It was beyond stupid,” Remus shook his head, “It was reckless.” Sirius braced himself for the anger he knew he deserved, but Remus merely paused and said, “James and Peter didn’t stick around?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Again, Sirius felt a disorienting jolt of surprise at Remus’s calm demeanor. “N-no, they wanted to, but they left after Dumbledore came in to talk to you.” He pulled at a loose thread in the blanket, desperately avoiding Remus’s gaze. “He’ll have told you what happened then?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes, I got the gist of it,” Remus said dismissively. “But you stayed?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“W-what?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You stayed after Dumbledore left, even when James and Peter went up.” Remus frowned, “Why?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Because I’m sick with guilt over what I’ve done, </span>
  </em>
  <span>Sirius thought, </span>
  <em>
    <span>isn’t it obvious?</span>
  </em>
  <span> “I guess I...I didn’t want you to wake up alone.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Remus seemed to consider this for a moment. “You got detention?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes, every Saturday for the rest of term. Snape’s got them as well, although I reckon that’s part of the punishment - having to do them together.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Ha,” Remus uttered a sound that was too cynical to call a laugh.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I know I’ve got off easy,” Sirius looked his friend straight in the eye now, begging for forgiveness. “I know I could’ve gotten us both expelled, but if you’d heard what-”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Expelled?” Remus burst out, “Sirius, I could’ve been </span>
  <em>
    <span>arrested</span>
  </em>
  <span>. Or worse,” he added, almost under his breath, “put down.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius paled, “No, the Ministry wouldn’t - they couldn’t. Dumbledore wouldn’t let them.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Dumbledore’s jurisdiction only stands as long as no one gets hurt,” Remus said quietly. “The Ministry already doesn’t like that I’m at Hogwarts, but Dumbledore assured them that I would pose no threat to the students. If I had… If Snape had been hurt, I don’t think even he could protect me.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“But they wouldn’t…put you down…” Sirius said weakly, stomach turning at the thought.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Remus closed his eyes; Sirius had seen him in worse shape after a full moon, but he didn’t think he’d ever seen him look so thoroughly exhausted before. He looked as if he had the weight of the world on his shoulders. “Wizarding laws concerning werewolves are,” Remus paused, “murky at best. I guarantee you it’s happened before.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Moony,” Sirius whispered, the full weight of what he’d done had finally hit him. “I’m </span>
  <em>
    <span>so</span>
  </em>
  <span>-”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Don’t,” Remus cut him off again. He shifted uncomfortably in bed, wincing slightly, but his tone remained steady, “You don’t need to apologize. I suppose I should be thanking you actually.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Remus…” Sirius tried again.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Thank you Sirius, for reminding me of the monster I am. Ever since you lot mastered your transformations, I’ve gotten far too lax about the full moon, but this was good, really. You might see it as a monthly excuse to get out of the castle and get into trouble, but for me it’s a risk. It’s always a risk, and one I have no choice in taking. I’d nearly forgotten that. This probably won’t be the last close call, just the first.” He took a shuddering breath, his steely demeanor finally cracking, “If I had hurt Severus… or </span>
  <em>
    <span>turned</span>
  </em>
  <span> him…”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Remus broke down and Sirius moved toward him without thinking. Each sob pierced his chest like a shard of glass, but still he was drawn to Remus, moving closer until he sat on the edge of the bed. “I don’t give a flying fuck about Snape,” Sirius covered Remus’s hand with his own, “but if anything happened to you, because of something I did,” Remus raised his head to look at him, “I don’t think I could live with myself.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“This is my </span>
  <em>
    <span>life</span>
  </em>
  <span>, Sirius,” Remus whispered, “do you get that?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I do,” Sirius replied gravely, “I understand.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Then don’t you ever,” Remus’s voice shook with emotion, “</span>
  <em>
    <span>ever</span>
  </em>
  <span> use me as a weapon again. I’ve been so careful Sirius, so damn careful. And you almost ruined that for me, and for what - a bloody grudge?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius found he was quite at a loss for words. Remus had done what few others had managed before him - rendered him speechless. Here was this boy, nearly a man, sitting across from him looking so frail and so miserable - someone he’d spent the better part of five years with, eating meals with him, sitting in class together, sleeping in the same room - and yet Sirius was suddenly struck by just how strong Remus Lupin was. He thought of telling him what had spurred his actions on the full moon, he could try to explain it, try to lessen his guilt by shifting the blame. But any way he framed it, it was only an excuse, and it paled in comparison to what he’d put Remus through, what he’d already been through in his young life. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You know I wasn’t even five when I was bitten?” Remus’s voice broke through Sirius’s thoughts. He spoke to Sirius, but his eyes focused on something far in the distance, as if trying to capture a memory. “Can you imagine that? A five-year old werewolf? Can you imagine what my parents had to do, to contain me?” Sirius gripped Remus’s hand in his own, but he remained silent. “And as I got bigger - stronger - what they watched me do to myself,” Remus continued, “because I couldn’t get to them. Well-” he shrugged in a way that was anything but casual, “you’ve seen the scars.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius enfolded Remus’s hand between both of his, as if it were something precious - almost as if he were praying over it. Still, Remus’s gaze remained distant.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’ve changed, every month for the past eleven years, and I </span>
  <em>
    <span>will</span>
  </em>
  <span> change every month, for the rest of my life, until the day I die. I didn’t ask for this and there’s nothing I can do to stop it. Yet somehow the Wizarding World has declared me a second class citizen.” Remus finally focused on him, “After we graduate, you’re going to get a job. You’re going to settle down, start a family. I’m never going to have those things, Sirius.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You will,” Sirius breathed, hardly convincing himself.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Remus shook his head, “Who’s going to hire someone like me? Who’s going trust me?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I will,” Sirius said instantly. “I trust you Remus, more than anyone - more than James, even,” Sirius added at Remus’s skeptical expression. “And I know I lost your trust, but I promise you, I’m going to work to gain it back, however I can.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Remus hesitated, as if he didn’t dare speak his next words aloud, “Who’s going to love me Sirius?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Before he could think better of it, Sirius leaned forward and kissed Remus firmly on the mouth. The other boy tensed under him, but Sirius reached up to cup his jaw, pulling Remus into him. To his immense relief, he felt Remus begin to relax and return the kiss. Remus reached up to card his fingers through Sirius’s hair and pulled just slightly, making Sirius shiver and deepen the kiss.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“This isn’t just because you feel sorry for me?” Remus breathed when they both pulled away panting.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No,” Sirius assured him, and crashed back into Remus. He pulled him closer, tongue darting out boldly to gain entrance, and Sirius couldn’t believe it when Remus obliged. He licked into Remus’s mouth and sucked on his bottom lip, eliciting a soft moan from Remus that shot straight through Sirius.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Do you have to stay here?” Sirius asked a bit desperately.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No, no,” Remus gasped as Sirius mouthed at his neck.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius sucked a mark onto Remus’s collarbone and looked up, smirking, “Well then let’s get you upstairs and in bed.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius went to check that Madame Pomfrey was still asleep, while Remus changed into his robes as fast as he could. He returned and grasped Remus’s hand, grinning as he pulled him towards the door. Remus held back.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius frowned, “What’s wrong?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Remus shrugged and muttered, “I don’t- I don’t want anyone to see me like this.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius’s heart sank, “You mean with me?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No!” Remus exclaimed, “Merlin, no. I meant how I look.” He gestured to his complexion - skin ashen, new scratches in the process of healing, bruises around his eyes.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius scoffed, “If anyone asks we’ll tell them you got in a fight with a Hippogriff,” he winked, “and won. Luckily we won’t be totally on our own.” From beneath his robes he produced the map they’d recently completed. He scanned the route, “Looks like the coast is clear.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Remus pulled Sirius back yet again, “Padfoot,” he said softly, “this doesn’t mean I forgive you.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius nodded, but couldn’t quite hide his disappointment, “I understand. We have a lot more to talk about.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Remus closed the distance between them and kissed him roughly, pushing Sirius up against the door. “Except I don’t feel much like talking right now,” he whispered wickedly in Sirius’s ear. “Maybe you can make it up to me some other way.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Wh-what did you have in mind?” Sirius stammered.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Get me upstairs and maybe I’ll show you,” Remus smirked.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius didn’t need to be told twice. He scrambled away from the door, wrenched it open, and pulled Remus down the hall. The two made it back to the Common Room in record time. Mercifully, James and Peter were still asleep when they entered their dorm. Remus collapsed on his four poster bed and Sirius moved to join him. He went to pull the curtains shut, but winced when they shrieked loudly in their track.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Padfoot?” James muttered groggily from the bed next to them, “Are you just getting in?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius cursed silently, “Yeah, just putting Moony to bed.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Morning James,” Remus called and sat up in the bed.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>James sat up and stretched, “You two’ve made up then?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius shot Remus a questioning look. “Something like that,” Remus said with a smile towards Sirius.</span>
