    <p> </p><p>Three days after the wizarding world was enlightened to the bitter truth of Voldemort's return, and three days after Sirius Black fell through the Veil in the Department of Mysteries, Harry Potter finally managed to escape from the heavy gazes of friends and strangers alike. He was currently trying to find seclusion on the shore of the Black Lake, and after he confirmed that the spot was mostly hidden by conveniently placed shrubbery, he dropped onto the bank and drew his knees to his chest, staring blankly at the horizon. Harry knew that if he looked in the water’s reflection, he would see that his black hair was in its usual disarray, and that dark circles hung under his eyes, and that in blunt terms he looked like shite. But his mind was heavy with the echo of Sirius’ laugh, and Trelawney's voice as it spoke the prophecy that ultimately connected his life to Voldemort.  Ironically, Harry was so oblivious to the world around him that he didn't even notice someone was nearing until the unmistakable crack of a stick sounded behind him. He inwardly groaned, and his last thought as blue light enveloped him was that it would almost be a relief for it to all end before he was forced to lose anybody else he cared about.</p><p> </p><p>___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p><p> </p><p>Draco Malfoy was not amused. He was currently in a dream that others might perceive as perfectly ordinary. You see, in the haze of his unconscious mind, he was in the company of a rather skinny boy whose green eyes burned with rage and messy hair screamed to be brushed. He was flanked by a red-faced ginger boy and a bushy-haired girl whose nose was turned up in a way that implied she was a know-it-all (and Draco knew this because he saw the same expression in the mirror every day).</p><p> </p><p>The green-eyed boy kept telling Draco “You need to fix it, pointy-faced git” and each time he said it his voice rose in volume. It wasn’t until the chant mimicked that of a scream that Draco woke, pyjamas soaked with sweat and tears streaming down his face. He would have been mortified at the state of himself if it hadn’t become almost normal after the past two months of the secret dreams.</p><p> </p><p>Deeming his damp clothing uncomfortable, he performed a couple of cleaning and drying spells, then sat cross-legged in his bed, wondering why things like this had to happen to him. He was aware that he was monumentally important, but that certainly did not entail going utterly barmy. While he had no clue who the three Gryffindors were - they were always in school uniform in the dreams - he intuitively knew that whoever they were he hated them and that they returned that hatred. He firmly ignored the strange flutter in his stomach that appeared when he saw the boy with the lightning scar. When his subconscious began to bring it up, he immediately explained to himself that it was just gas. Because it definitely could not be anything else.</p><p> </p><p>Draco knew that if he ever so much as mentioned that he was dreaming about people who, to his knowledge, didn’t exist, the family healer would be called over to check for any brain damage. Well, that and the fact that he had a feeling deep in his gut that if the dreams did mean something, they must be coming to him and not anyone else for a reason.</p><p>Grabbing his silver wristwatch from his nightstand, Draco let out a rather pitiful groan when he saw it was barely a quarter to six in the morning but still rose to dress in something warm enough for him to enjoy a morning ride on his broom. It was a sort of habit, he’d wake from a particularly intense dream, and if he couldn’t quiet down his mind, then he’d go out on his well-loved Firebolt for an hour or two.</p><p> </p><p>After careful consideration of how he should get to the broom shed that stood outside of the manor, he half-whispered, “Dobby!”. A slight pop and the bulb eyed house elf stood in front of him.</p><p> </p><p>“Bring me my morning tea.”</p><p> </p><p>Dobby returned with the tea and rocked from side to side while Draco drank it, and carefully accepted the empty mug when he was finished. Before the elf could waffle on about his latest attempt to be freed, he held out his left hand and commanded him to take him to the area right outside of the shed. Draco grimaced as they landed outside in the crisp fall air, he had forgotten how dizzying side-apparition was. A casual wave of his hand sent the elf right back to wherever it is he went when he wasn’t moping about or following orders.</p><p> </p><p>Turning to the shed, he went on with grabbing his broom and putting on a warm hat before mounting the Firebolt and taking off to the sky. Draco was lucky that the manor was located on Wiltshire countryside, and that wards prevented any stray muggles from seeing anything but trees and empty pasture. It left him kilometres of acreage to fly through, and although he sometimes wondered if his rides would be more enjoyable with a companion, the beautiful gardens and tranquillity he felt when he rode made up for any loneliness that might sneak up on him. Feeling more adventurous than he did most mornings, he cast a high strength disillusionment charm on himself and the broom and headed toward the tourist-heavy Wardour Castle. It was a rather depressing example of what happened when a wizard abandoned his home, but the hidden alcoves and open rooms had often been used as a play place for Draco when his mother wanted to escape the manor.</p><p> </p><p>He had rediscovered it only recently and kept returning due to the random doors that appeared when he would arrive. His last visit had led him to what once was the kitchen and servants quarters. For a castle that had been damaged sometime in the latter half of the 15 century, then left to crumble as an “ornamental feature” by the muggle that managed to inherit it, it was incredible that there were parts of the ancient house that still looked habitable. While he didn’t share the intense hatred for muggles like his father and most of his preferred company, he had to admit that they liked to royally fuck up things that they shouldn’t have the right to touch, examples including Stonehenge and wizarding castles.</p><p> </p><p>The sun was barely peeking above the horizon when Draco finally landed in front of the castle’s cave, and a slight morning mist settled around him as he shrunk the broom and slipped it into his robe pocket. The cave was one area of the old house he hadn’t thoroughly explored, and he decided with a firm shake of his head that it would be the focus of the day's visit.</p><p> </p><p>As Draco climbed the small set of stairs leading to the cave, he noticed that the roof was covered in overgrown variegated ivy and that it looked as though there was no way to enter. Muttering to himself as he sidestepped through the narrow gap at its front, he barely stifled a gasp when an arched outline of an entrance began to glow along the previously unblemished looking wall of stone. As he neared closer, it started to materialise into an actual door, complete with a bronze ringed handle on its left-hand side. He reasoned with himself that it was probably okay to open because the other magically appearing doors had not been trapped or led him to an untimely death. An inscription curved along the arch of the door and began to grow as though it felt Draco trying to read it. Memores acti prudentes futuri. A soft voice spoke as though it was right behind him, “Be mindful of what has been done, and aware of what will be” but when he turned around he found himself alone. With a light shrug, he reached to open the door, surprised when he felt a tingle of magic rush up his arm and along the rest of his body when his hand closed around the bronze ring and pulled.</p><p> </p><p>The door opened to reveal a short hallway, dimly lit with torches, which curved to the left after about six metres. A quick popping of his knuckles and he was off, striding down the hall like he wasn’t internally screaming at his arse to go back and forget that he ever saw the door. Halfway down the hallway, he heard a slight creaking as the door inexplicably closed behind him, and he turned around with an unimpressed glare at the stone wall where the door had once been.</p><p> </p><p>“Well, fuck you too.”</p><p> </p><p>When he rounded the corner of the hallway, he was suddenly inside of a large study. Decorated in a deep red and accented with dark oak furniture, it looked like it belonged to a well-rounded wizard, with its small potions lab, alchemy table, three fully stocked bookshelves, and squared desk on which books on ancient runes sat along with many strange artefacts. One artefact, in particular, caught Draco's eye, a rounded globe that reminded him of a prophecy orb, except the changing colours of the swirls inside of it were like nothing he had ever seen or read. Picking it up and holding it in both hands, he heard a soft voice whispering and felt small vibrations under his fingertips. He was just about to put the orb against his ear to try and listen to the voice properly when it suddenly burst from his hands, zipping across the room until it was floating about two metres from Draco’s face. The whispering he had heard before suddenly grew until the voice could be heard clearly:</p><p> </p><p>“With truth and courage, know thyself</p><p>   You have lived life before</p><p>   Know this to understand that which must be changed forever</p><p>   From Merlin's mind, I give untold knowledge</p><p>   For if you want peace, you must prepare for the war.”</p><p> </p><p>As the last word was spoken an intense light filled the room, and a pulse threw Draco backwards until he hit the wall, and he collapsed as his vision went completely dark.</p><p> </p><p>___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p><p> </p><p>Draco woke up with a pounding headache, and two sets of memories for every year of his life, which was almost but not quite as nauseating as the time Mad-eye Moody turned him into a ferret. He was lying on his side on the chilly stone floor of the study, and after a quick check that all of his limbs were in working order he pushed himself up into a sitting position. After the initial head rush, he pulled one knee up to his chest and propped his elbow on it, then rested his chin on his hand.</p><p> </p><p>“I swear to Salazar this is all Scarhead’s fault,” he muttered before his eyes comically widened as he remembered that in this current world, Potter didn’t exist.</p><p> </p><p>Was it funny that even after all the hating and whining and stalking that his enemy being erased from existence made him depressed? Even Draco could admit that if he were a bystander he’d laugh until his face went red. But he wasn’t. Instead, he was sitting here trying to figure out how to breathe, because, without Harry Potter, the lunatic snake man would probably walk the earth until the end of time, and that just wasn’t acceptable. Draco might be safe as a pureblood who has a strong allegiance with the Dark Lord, but he knows that he was meant to remember Potter for a reason. Meant to remember his past life for a reason. He knew now without a shadow of a doubt that life was immensely better when Voldemort was dead versus when he was alive. He’d had to live with the nutter for a whole year in the world with Potter, and in this world, he knew just how many people(good people, or at least good enough) eventually died because they realised how barmy he was.</p><p> </p><p>Feeling determined to fix it somehow, because Draco wasn’t an idiot and understood that the orb was telling him that he was the unfortunate sod that was destined to fix this mess, he got to his feet and cautiously approached the now-lacklustre ball that had given him back his memories. He touched it with his shoe, nothing happened. With pursed lips, he slowly bent down to pick it up, wary that it might throw another tantrum and blind him with light. When he managed to pick it up without anything happening, he smirked and scrutinised it. Of course, now that it had done its job it looked and felt like the divination balls Trelawney used in her classroom, which implied it would be utterly useless. He quickly decided that he would come back to it later, and set it back on top of the desk where he had first picked it up. It was when his eyes landed on a sloppily bound book titled <em> Horcruxes, What They Are and How to Safely Make One </em> that he realised the untold knowledge the orb had talked about wasn’t just total rubbish. Because there was a memory, or something resembling a memory, of all five of Voldemort’s Horcruxes and their locations. Deciding that he needed to learn about Horcruxes before he did anything else, he pulled out the red velvet desk chair and started reading.</p><p> </p><p>“The man believed that splitting his soul five times was a good idea?!”  Draco audibly scoffed.</p><p> </p><p>“Immortality? Sure! Just sign this line right here, and we’ll give it to you. Directly after we completely eradicate whatever inch of morality you had left in you by splitting your soul into five parts. What an absolute nutcase,” he muttered to the empty room.</p><p> </p><p>If he didn’t think Voldemort was a lunatic before, he certainly did now, promptly closing the book and setting it on the desk.</p><p> </p><p>Checking his wristwatch, Draco was pleased to see that it was only half past eight, which left him with plenty of time to continue his search of the study. Stretching his arms as he rose from the chair, he walked over to the knapsack resting on top of a red scarf on the left-hand corner of the desk. It looked to made of dragonhide and had three pouch sized pockets along its front. Draco opened all three and was disappointed at the emptiness of them. The main space of the bag, however, was quite a feat, as two leather bound journals lay inside, and rows upon rows of little potion bottle-sized pockets. Making up his mind that he would be taking the bag back home with him, he grabbed the book on Horcruxes and the orb and put them inside the bag.</p><p> </p><p>Walking over to the most prominent bookshelf in the room, Draco began skimming the titles for anything that would be helpful to him. <em> Secrets of the Darkest Arts </em> , <em> Moste Potente Potions </em> , and <em> Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them </em> , were the books Draco grabbed and put into the knapsack, the latter because he had been wanting a copy of his own for years, and hadn’t acquired one due to Father thinking it was completely bogus. After coming up empty-handed from the second bookshelf, Draco didn’t expect much from the last but was happily proved wrong when he noticed that almost all of the books on the shelf were journals. He grabbed <em> Changing Time Using Runes </em> and <em> Time Travel Using the Dark Arts </em>, and almost missed the book that was glowing right under his nose. It didn’t have a title or any markings on the spine, but it must be vital if it was glowing just like the door and orb had. Stuffing the books into the bag and swinging it over his shoulder, he did a final sweep of the room and decided the only thing left to look at was the small potions lab and the small wardrobe next to the wooden door that had appeared along the wall he crashed into earlier.</p><p> </p><p>The potions lab ended up having an ingredients case filled to the brim, and a book listing ingredients and everything about them to a more considerable degree than a common Ingredient Encyclopaedia did. The wardrobe was sparsely filled but did have an expensive cloak that had strong disillusionment, and defensive charms weaved into it, a pair of dragonhide gloves, and a strange pouch which had an enchanted necklace inside it. The gloves and pouch Draco put inside the knapsack, but he switched the cloak he was currently wearing for the one in the wardrobe. One last look around the room and then Draco was out the door and on his broom, hoping that he could find a way to bring Potter back as quickly as possible.</p><p> </p><p>____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p><p> </p><p>Three days after the orb incident and getting his ‘old’ memories back, Draco found out that Harry Potter hadn’t been erased from existence, but instead had been born two decades earlier than he was initially supposed to. He wasn’t entirely shocked to learn that he had gotten himself killed the summer after graduating from Hogwarts, in a raid attack in some village in the Scottish Highlands. From Draco's memories of the original timeline, Potter and his friends were all apart of some Order that Dumbledore had founded during the First War. A week and a half after that Draco found a spell that could send him back as a permanent member of that timeline. It had been extremely tricky, as when he realised that it would be better to prevent the first war from ending as disastrously as it did, he had to look for an entirely different kind of spell to send him back. The ritual he had found had one requirement, and that was that he couldn’t become a part of a family unless their "blood flowed through his veins", and for the umpteenth time that week he thanked Merlin he wasn't a mudblood. Luckily for him, he was a pureblood with ties to multiple families that went back centuries, and the only thing he had to think about was which family to become a part of.</p><p> </p><p>It was one day before his scheduled departure date that he remembered he would need to keep some of his memories to defeat Voldemort properly. Pulling out the glowing journal he had grabbed from the study, he asked the book if it was able to preserve what Draco needed to remember. It was the reason he knew about Potter, the first time he had opened the journal it had eagerly given him everything he needed to know about where the messy-haired git had been sent. The book hummed in his hands, and he was comforted by the memories that were now preserved, he assumed, in the pages of the magical journal. He already had a way for the knapsack to move back in time with him, and he had made sure only to put things he thought would be necessary in his quest (everything he had taken from the study) and wouldn’t look too out of place (a couple of childhood books his mother had given to him that were published before his arrival date). With a small sigh, he put everything on the desk in his room and went downstairs to enjoy the last dinner he would have with his parents.</p><p> </p><p>Lucius Malfoy was looking pristine while scolding a house elf when Draco entered the dining room. His mother, elegant as always, was gliding across the room, watering the plants that lay in boxes in front of the eight paralleled windows on the side walls.</p><p> </p><p>“Draco, keep your chin up, you look like a filthy squib with that slouch.” Lucius all but commanded.</p><p> </p><p>“Of course, Father,” Draco quipped. </p><p> </p><p>He mentally laughed at what his father would do if Draco were to be a little more external with his sarcastic tendencies. Probably bring out the cane, as Draco wasn’t entirely confident that Lucius would deem Draco too old to be punished that way. He rubbed his backside in remembrance as he sat down at his place at the table, thanking Merlin he wouldn’t have to tolerate a father like that when he went back in time. Dinner passed without much conversation or real importance, which was perfectly fine as Draco would rather things be boring than disruptive to the plan set in place. It was after he had been excused and was halfway up the staircase that led to his quarters that his mother softly called out his name.</p><p> </p><p>Turning around he saw her gently beckon him back down the stairs, and once his feet hit the deep plum rug of the foyer, she began to glide towards the library, clearly expecting him to trail after her. He followed her as she weaved through the bookcases until finally she gracefully sat in her comfy chair in the corner of her nook and tucked her feet underneath her.</p><p> </p><p>A wave of her wand and a chair similar to hers appeared opposite her, and she pointedly looked at it before waving her hand and a tray to serve tea popped onto the small circular table which sat between the two chairs. Draco sat down in the chair and poured her tea before serving himself, and they sat in comfortable silence.</p><p> </p><p>She eventually turned to look at him, her voice gentle, “Little Dragon, do you know without any doubt that what you’re about to do is for the greater good?”</p><p> </p><p>Well, that was a loaded question Draco hadn’t seen coming, but he knew better than to question how she knew about what he was about to do. He looked down at his lap, where his fingers were idly tracing the pattern on his teacup, then leaned forward to place the tea on its saucer, keeping his elbows on his knees as he put his face in his hands.</p><p> </p><p>Letting out a shaky breath he didn’t know he’d been holding, he replied, “I know that I’m the only one with the knowledge that could save hundreds upon hundreds of lives and that for once in my life I feel brave enough to fight for those lives. To be the person that risks their existence for a better past and future.”</p><p> </p><p>He looked up to see her smiling at him with watery eyes, but her voice was firm and clear when she said, “Then, Little Dragon, it’s time for you to fly."</p><p> </p><p>___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p><p> </p><p>The door to Draco’s quarters had been locked and warded, but the paranoia that someone would figure out his plan still lingered. Even if it was an irrational fear as his mother was the only person aware of his quest, and his father had left for the Ministry earlier that morning. He had never been a fan of pacing, but his feet were restless and his palms might have been shaking, so if walking back and forth in front of his desk helped then he’d gladly pace. He was currently trying to go through the extensive list of things that he needed to complete the complicated ritual he was about to start. It had been one of the only spells concerning time travel listed in the Secrets of the Darkest Arts and the most recommended way to permanently travel back in time in the journal Time Travel Using the Dark Arts. It involved Draco taking a symbolic possession that represented the life of Draco Lucius Malfoy, smearing it with some of his blood, and then him destroying it with the spell provided in the book. Once this was finished, he would have to say the chant precisely as it was written, and if done right he would be pulled to his new life.</p><p> </p><p>He was attempting to stay calm, but if things didn’t go perfectly, he could be erased or killed and many other depressing alternatives. Adrenaline was surging through his veins like it did when he had a Quidditch match, and like it did during fourth year when he realised his infatuation with Potter had risen to new heights while watching his horrendous dancing, and like it did whenever his father raised a hand too quickly. With a final shake of his head, he pulled out his wand, “Accio family portrait”. He caught the small photograph as it sailed to him, looking at his young self-standing in front of a grimacing Lucius and laughing Narcissa.</p><p> </p><p>He remembered the day it was taken, how his father’s hand had been painfully digging into his shoulder, and how his mother had gently fixed his hair and kissed his cheek. Taking his wand he pointed it to his right forearm because he wasn’t about to cut his palm like some barmy muggle, he was far too dignified for that. He felt a slight sting as the cut began to bleed, and tilted his arm over the photo, watching as it darkened from the blood. Placing it in front of him on the ground, he muttered “Lacarnum Inflamarae”, and the photo let out a small hiss as it was set aflame, curling into itself as it turned to ash. Letting out a shaky breath he went over the chant in his head one more time.</p><p> </p><p>“In manus tuas commendo spiritum meum.” The room met his voice with an echo.</p><p> </p><p>“Ut renati, Ut ius iniurias.” It could be his imagination, but it sounded like voices were chanting along with him.</p><p> </p><p>“Memores acti prudentes futuri.” The voices were real, and they were growing louder.</p><p> </p><p>“Aut Vincere aut mori.” He could barely hear himself over the chorus of voices that rebounded throughout the room.</p><p> </p><p>“Alea iacta est.” Once the last word was spoken silence weighed down on his shoulders like a heavy blanket, and just when he doubted that the spell had worked, he suddenly felt like he was falling, and was still falling when everything went black.</p><p> </p>
