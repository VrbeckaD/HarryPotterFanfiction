<p>Ladies’ Night</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>They heard the club before seeing it. Throbbing music emanated from it, making the ground shudder. As they entered, the beat permeated Astoria’s very bones.</p>
<p>“You’re here!” Pansy cried, spotting them. She smirked. “Draco actually let you leave him to spend time with your disreputable friends?” </p>
<p>Astoria rolled her eyes. “Well, it’s ladies’ night. He probably feels safe letting me come since men aren’t allowed.” </p>
<p>“I’m glad you made it.” Pansy huffed. “Millicent’s getting on my nerves.” She shot an inquisitive look to Astoria’s companion. “Who’s your friend?” </p>
<p>“I’m Daria.” Daria extended a hand towards Pansy, who shook it. “I’m…related to Draco.” </p>
<p>“A cousin?” At Daria’s nod, Pansy tilted her head. “I see the resemblance.” </p>
<p>“Draco thought it would be fun to take Daria out for a night on the town,” said Astoria. </p>
<p>“Why not?” Pansy tossed her head. “The more the merrier. Join us!” </p>
<p>The table they’d commandeered was in a prime spot to watch all the action, and as Astoria and Daria got settled, Tracey Davis took drink orders and headed for the bar. </p>
<p>“Where did you attend school, Daria?” Pansy asked once everyone had introduced themselves. </p>
<p>“Beauxbatons.” Daria smiled. “And before you ask, no, I’m not friends with Fleur Delacour.” </p>
<p>“Get that question a lot, do you?” Pansy laughed. “Well, I won’t ask about that bitch. I had enough of her during the Triwizard.” She rolled her eyes. “Veela bitches suck all the air out of a room, am I right?” </p>
<p>Just then, Tracey returned with their drinks, and Daria nodded. “I’ll drink to that.” </p>
<p>After clinking their glasses they all drank, and Millicent and Pansy began arguing about Quidditch.  </p>
<p>Thirty minutes in, Daria rose. “Loo?” </p>
<p>“I’ll show you,” said Astoria. “We’ll be right back.” </p>
<p>Pansy and Millicent, still arguing, barely acknowledged them; everyone else was off dancing. </p>
<p>Once inside the bathroom, Daria grabbed Astoria, dragging her into a stall. Astoria raised an eyebrow. “You realise this will look suspicious?” </p>
<p>Daria snorted. “I don’t care. That dress you’re <i>almost</i> wearing’s driving me mad.” </p>
<p>“This old thing?” Astoria smirked.</p>
<p>Daria hauled Astoria close and kissing her. “You know it makes me want to ravish you.” </p>
<p>“If you’re doing that,” panted Astoria, “be quick. The others will get suspicious if we take too long.” </p>
<p>Daria wasted no time hiking up Astoria’s skirt and slipping fingers between her legs. Upon finding no knickers, Daria hissed. “You slag.” </p>
<p>Astoria smirked. “Just for you, darling.” </p>
<p>Daria growled. “It better be.” Devouring Astoria’s mouth, Daria thrust three fingers into her cunt, bringing her to a quick, intense, orgasm. </p>
<p>Once she had caught her breath, Astoria whispered, “I can suck—”</p>
<p>“No time.” Daria’s face morphed into Draco’s familiar features. “Shit, it’s worn off, hasn’t it?” </p>
<p>“Mmhm.” Clasping his face in her palms, Astoria kissed him. “That was lovely. Now, drink your Polyjuice so we can rejoin our friends and finish the evening.” </p>
<p>Shaking his head, Draco obeyed, and when he was Daria once more, he opened the stall and gestured her out. “Shall we?” </p>
