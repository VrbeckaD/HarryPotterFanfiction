          <div class="userstuff"><p dir="ltr" align="justify">"Hey, Moons! Guess what? We won!" Sirius announced with a grin. Remus stayed still and silent. "Moons?" Sirius asked worriedly. Remus grunted. "Come on Re, what're you--" Sirius started, eyes widening as he saw Remus's face. "Geez, Re, do you have a fever?" Sirius exclaimed. Remus's cheeks were red, and a drop of sweat was falling down his temple.</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">"No, I do <em>not.</em>" Remus said. Sirius rolled his eyes, placing his palm on Remus's forehead.</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">"Yikes, you're smoking hot!" Sirius exclaimed, chuckling after he realized what he had said. "I mean, yeah, but really, Moons. You have a fever. Stop studying." Sirius said, more serious by now.</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">"We have an <em>examination </em>tomorrow, Padfoot. I'm not missing it!" Remus hissed, although he put his quill on the table. Sirius scoffed.</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">"Uh, yes – yes you <em>are.</em> I'm not letting you go to class in this condition."</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">Minutes later Remus was lying on the bed, tucked in with a bowl of soup and a glass of water in front of him. "Took a while to bring those up without spilling 'em", Sirius huffed.</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">"So... I'm not allowed to leave my bed unless it's an emergency?" Remus asked, still not happy with the situation.</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">"No, you are not. And remember, <em>no studying</em>!" Sirius commanded.</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">"But what if–" Remus started, but Sirius stood his ground.</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">"No. No studying in<em> any</em> case. It gives you headaches", he said.</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify"><em>As if I</em> wouldn't <em>study</em>, Remus thought as he pulled his Charms book from under his blanket. Sirius had left to the Great Hall, so Remus now had time to study Charms and Potions.</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">Time had passed – Remus didn't even know how long – but all of sudden he heard a voice beside him. "Oh, this is what you've done all the time?" Sirius asked, a little bit hurt.</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">"Sirius, I–" Remus started, but decided to toughen up. "I have to practice for the Charms test", he said. Sirius looked angry.</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">"Didn't I already say you're not going there?" he asked. 

"Yeah, but–" only Sirius's gaze was enough to tell Remus to shut up.</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">Remus pouted angrily, continuing to read his Charms book. "C'mon, Re. I'll keep you company", Sirius said, softening a bit. Remus tried hard not to look at Sirius. "Sit up for a second, would you?" Sirius asked politely. Remus frowned, but sat up anyway. <em>What in Merlin is he</em> doing<em>?</em></p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">Sirius sat on Remus's pillow. "C'mere, Moons", Sirius said softly. <em>Not the puppy eyes</em>, Remus prayed, <em>not the puppy eyes</em>— </p><p dir="ltr" align="justify"> He glanced at Sirius, who indeed was making the puppy eyes. Remus rolled his own before sitting between Sirius's legs. "You don't need <em>this</em>", Sirius whispered as he gently took Remus's sweater off of him, hugging his boyfriend.</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">Sirius threw the Charms book away (being responded to by an annoyed "Hey! I'm not a trash can!" from James) and sniffed Remus's hair. Sirius planted a light, gentle and caring kiss on every scar he could reach.</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">"I love you. You know that, right?" Sirius whispered. Remus nodded, planting a gentle kiss on Sirius's lips, lingering just for a moment longer.</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">"I love you too", Remus whispered so quietly that only Sirius could hear it.</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">And maybe this was the best place. Maybe it was better to be cuddled by your boyfriend than to be practicing for some stupid exams.</p></div>
