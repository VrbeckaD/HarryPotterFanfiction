    <p>2003</p>
<p>I felt extremely tired. A few HYDRA goons had shot what felt like a dozen of tranquilizer darts at me. They had first tried it with one but because of my advanced healing, I woke up pretty fast.</p>
<p>I look around and see that I'm in a small room. The floor under me is concrete and I have a small window but it's dark so it's not of much use.</p>
<p>The metal door in front of me opens and a guard walks in. He grips my arm and pulls me up. Usually, I would fight but I'm too tired and it looks like he is taking me out of this cell-like room.</p>
<p>He shoves me out of the door and through a hallway. As I walk past a room I can see a little Girl, not older than 10 sitting in a glass container that looks frozen.</p>
<p>Poor thing. When I get out of here I want to free her too. I feel how the tranquilizer gets weaker in my system and I get more awake.</p>
<p>As the guard pushes me into a room with two chairs and a metal table I roll my eyes. He pushes me down on one of the chairs and leaves the room.</p>
<p>A man steps Into the room but I can't really see his features. He has black hair and on his Jacket is a red Symbol that looks like an octopus. The HYDRA Symbol.</p>
<p>"Hello Izabel, it's a pleasure to finally meet you." He says. "The feelings are not mutual" I mumble. He laughs.</p>
<p>I am now fully awake and look for an exit. Behind List is a door but I want to save the little girl so I'll have to use the door behind me.</p>
<p>"How old are you?" List asks. "Old" I reply. I know, I'm helpful. "What powers do you exactly have?" I want to reply with 'None' and in cases like these, I hate the fact that I can't lie. "None of your business" I reply to the doctor.</p>
<p>I wonder why they haven't cuffed me to this table, it's so easy to get out of here. I'll just have to use my Wings- Wait, they want to see my Wings!</p>
<p>Well, I'm not gonna do them the favor. Quickly I pull out a spare feather that I usually wear in my hair. I know it sounds silly but hey, in this case, it's useful.</p>
<p>I will the feather to become dagger-like and leap over the table to hold it against Dr.List's neck. This probably looks really stupid, holding a feather to someone's neck but I don't care.</p>
<p>I walk with List in front of me towards the door and kick it open. The Guard who brought me to this room stands there and points the gun towards us.</p>
<p>"Lower the weapon!" He yells and I roll my eyes. "Bring me to the exit or I'll hurt him!" I want to say that I'll kill him, but I know I won't so I couldn't say it.</p>
<p>The guard clenches his jaw and nods. He brings me through the hallway again and I stop in front of the room where the little girl is in.</p>
<p>"What's with her?" I ask, nodding to her. "She's going to be unfrozen in four years" List chuckles. Damn HYDRA!</p>
<p>I just nod and we start walking again. Surprisingly nobody steps in the way.</p>
<p>2005<br/>It's been two years since my little in counter with HYDRA. In two years I'm going to free the little girl. Currently, I'm looking for something to do to help people. I would go to Charles, but I haven't seen him since the fight with Erik and I don't think that I want to get into that Drama.</p>
<p>I heard a lot about someone who calls himself the Ghost Rider and I thought about joining the Fantastic Four, but you know, they already are Four and it would be strange.</p>
<p>So I started looking for Captain America again like I promised Howard.</p>
