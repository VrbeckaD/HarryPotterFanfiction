    <p> </p>
<p>Once, there were rumours that Hogwarts’ Potion Master Severus Snape was a vampire and that he was hundreds of years old. Of course, that were only rumours as nobody would believe Albus Dumbledore would hire a vampire to teach students. The rumours, although kept circling inside Hogwarts, were regarded as jokes all the times. But, it spread again after the Headmaster hired Remus Lupin to teach Defense Against the Dark Art in that very school. And then, the well renowned Headmaster went again and hired a Muggle to teach Muggle studies. Yes, a Muggle. Not a squib. A Muggle.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It was the first day of the term. Final year students were returning after the war, including the Golden Trio; Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley and most of the students in their year. The house sorting for new students went without problems although the Sorting Hat sometimes took too long to decide which house the student should go, a situation rarely occurred before the war. Perhaps the hat had some internal conflict with its decision previously. Eventually, the Headmaster stood to give his speech after the sorting ended.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I am delighted to see all of you sorted accordingly. Welcome to the new students and welcome back to the rest of you. I’m pleased to share that this year, we have two new teachers joining us. Please welcome Mr. Firenze and Miss Levy Redfox. Mr. Firenze will teach Defense Against the Dark Arts and Ms. Redfox will be teaching Muggle Studies onwards.” The Headmaster started clapping his hand and the feast began. Quite a short speech compared to the previous years. No do’s and don’ts and warnings of restricted area spouted from him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I don’t remember having a Muggle colleague in Hogwarts. Ever. Aren’t you violating the law, Albus?” Minerva McGonagall, Head house of Gryffindor whispered to the Headmaster. She was seated on his left side. “And why am I not informed until now? Firenze I can understand, but muggle? She has no magic, Albus. Why?” She enquired while eating the delicacies on her plate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Minerva, you’re not the only one. I am shocked too. Let’s continue this after the feast. Is that okay, Headmaster?” Severus Snape retorted to his colleague’s question, also in whisper. He wondered whether the Muggle beside him heard his words or not. But that was not important.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The feast ended with Prefects leading the students to their respective dormitories. And the teachers went to gather in the Headmaster’s room including the two new teachers. They took a seat, but no one spoke anything and silence engulfed the room. The new Muggle teacher fidgeted with her skirt, realized that everyone was watching her. She felt relieved once the Headmaster entered the room.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Albus, I’ve never doubted your decision before, but please clarify why you hire a muggle to teach in a wizarding school. No offense Ms. Redfox, I’m just trying to figure this out.” McGonagall turned to face the lady to explain and turned back to face the Headmaster, demanding answer. All the other teachers nodded in agreement.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Does the Ministry know you did this? Muggles do not know of our world, Albus. I don’t want Shacklebolt to come here and take her away while teaching because you revealed our world to a muggle. The students will be alarmed. And we need a replacement at the ready to cover her syllabus if that happened. Which will be a waste of time for her and the replacement obviously.” Another teacher, Pomona Sprout voiced her concerns. She looked at the said muggle and wondered if the poor lady had other jobs in Muggle world before coming to Hogwarts.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>McGonagall gasped. “So you’re not concern about her status but her teaching schedule? Merlin, why do I not thinking about that. The students! My poor students! They were traumatised after war yet still have to come and finish their studies. If..if there’s anything that could distract them it would certainly be avoided at all cost. What am I thinking…….” Guilt look flashed on her face. </p>
<p>There was truth in what her colleague said. If they already knew the muggle teacher would be taken away once the Ministry were notified, why would they still hire her and risk the students being unable to concentrate on their studies? It would be better to hire a teacher that would not bring such circumstance to the students.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I can explain. Over these years, we had had many colleagues with us. Flitwick here is part-goblin. Hagrid-a giant. Lupin-a werewolf. And at sometimes recently we even had Voldemort’s Death Eater in classroom, and Voldemort himself taught Defense while possessing Professor Quirrell.  Although they can’t be viewed as teachers as they teach nothing.” Headmaster Dumbledore started his reasoning.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Yes, but all of them has magic. Ms.Redfox here is not even a squib. She is not supposed to know of our world, Albus. She can’t even defend herself if the students prank her. ” McGonagall was worried. Not that she worried that her students would prank the new teacher, but it was more like how would she fare living in a place full of magic while unable to channel it on daily basis. Well, Argus Filch did not have magic too as he was born a squib, but he was a…special case. He had worked in Hogwarts for a long time and the magical world was not unfamiliar to him. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Do tell me Albus, where did you find her?” Snape decided to join the questioning. He glanced at the muggle lady and instantly revert his eyes when said muggle looked at him in what looked like fear. The Potion Master had tried to read her mind, but surprisingly, he could not. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Ah..you see, I was wandering in Muggle London after the war and met her by chance. Ms. Redfox here was Mrs. Figg’s caretaker. She has muggle’s medical knowledge and served as local nurse in a clinic in Little Whinging before she moved into Mrs. Figg’s house to be her caretaker.” Albus Dumbledore casually explained to everyone present, oblivious of their confused look.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Then why did you bring her here? Shouldn’t she be with Mrs. Figg? I figured she must be in poor health if she needs a caretaker living with her?” Poppy Pomfrey, the school’s healer and matron asked the Headmaster, concerned of the mentioned Mrs. Figg. She had joined them in the room seeing as no one was admitted to the school’s hospital wing at the time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“She..had died awhile ago. I’m renting a room and searching for a job when I met Headmaster Dumbledore. He brought me here.” The muggle lady spoke, barely audible to people farther than her seat. She felt like crying with all the questions. “I ca..I can go back if..”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Ms. Redfox, do you have any family in muggle world?” Severus Snape asked her, trying to divert her thought after seeing her miserable state. He tried to control his voice as not to startle the young lady. Her eyes were already watered and he did not want to see a crying lady in front of him. She shook her head as her answer. And lucky for him, the tears never came. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“If you lived with Mrs. Figg, did you know Harry Potter then?” McGonagall asked her again, curiously.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I saw him a few times but we never interact. I don’t know if he remembers me.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Where will she reside, Albus?” Snape looked at the Headmaster, trying to figure where she would live. He wanted to end it fast and cut through the questions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Ah..that, I’m actually going to ask your opinion. Her belongings are still in this room.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Silence once again engulfed the room. Everyone looked at one another but still, no one spoke. Snape looked at the muggle in front of him again. She was holding her tears well. And once again, he could not read her mind!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“She can use my room if she wants. You know I have a house in Hogsmeade. I can floo here for my class.” He offered, breaking the silence in the room. Everyone looked at him in disbelief.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Absolutely not! She can’t stay in the dungeon, for Merlin sake. Besides, she’s a muggle. Who knows what might happen!” McGonagall shrieked and glared at the Potion master. “You’ll come with me if need be, Ms. Redfox.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Slytherins were known to have a bad relationship with Muggle-born wizards, and now Snape wanted to let a muggle live there? No way that would happen! Not in her watch anyway.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I think..it’s better if she comes with me. Albus said she has muggle’s medical knowledge. I might need her at some point later. And Severus, she’s a girl. Your…room..might not suit her. I believe we are finished here, Albus. Come, Ms. Redfox, follow me. I’ll have the house elf bring your things to the tower.” Pomfrey stood and gestured for the soon-to-be teacher to follow her.</p>
<p>


  <strong>..o0o..</strong>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The new muggle teacher awkwardly taught the new students in her classes. Most students did not want to follow her instructions and never did their assignments. All the professors did not know how to help her as she was in fact a muggle. They had no experience in helping a muggle to adapt in wizarding world. It was a relief to the staffs that the Ministry approved of her employment, given that she proved her worth in a year’s term. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Third day of the term, she hid herself in an empty classroom after finishing her morning lecture. Retracting to the corner of the room, she sat down, hugging her legs as tears ran down her cheeks. There was no sobbing as she did not want anyone to notice her presence inside the classroom. She buried her face down, trying to comfort herself. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Severus Snape was walking down the corridor when he saw the muggle teacher went into the empty classroom. He cast a notice-me-not charm and followed her stealthily. To his dismay, he saw her broke down and cursed himself for following her. The young teacher looked up and saw him despite his notice-me-not charm being activated, and she was crying. The tears stopped when their eyes met.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Are you going to tell me I don’t belong here?” Hazel eyes stared at his’, waiting for his answer.</p>
