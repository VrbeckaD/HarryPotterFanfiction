          <div class="userstuff"><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Draco stood at the large bay window, hands clasped behind his back, watching the rain pound against the glass.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He wanted to scream - to cry and rage, maybe throw an antique vase or two.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But he didn’t.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He couldn’t.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And so he watched the storm, letting the howling wind and merciless rain do damage for him.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">It had been two months since Ron Weasley left him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And wasn’t that a fine fucking joke?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Imagine, a Weasley, leaving a Malfoy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></span> <span class="s2"><em>How dare he</em>, </span> <span class="s1">Draco thought, for about the millionth time in eight weeks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></span> <span class="s2"><em>How dare that freckled, clumsy, boorish git leave me, by myself, to deal with this mess</em>? </span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Draco didn’t have the option of walking away.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He had responsibilities, people depending on him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He couldn’t just fuck off and leave it all to someone else.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He wouldn’t want to, even if he could, but it still made him angry, that he didn’t have the choice.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Because this was not the life Draco Malfoy had chosen.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He had let his guard down, had fallen in love, started a family.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Been happy. That was what Draco wanted; what he was supposed to have.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not this pathetic existence, where his husband could leave him, and Draco stood abandoned in his study, waiting for the only thing that made life worth living anymore.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">At exactly seven pm, Draco’s floo chimed, and a hesitant voice called out, “Draco, dear?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Draco plastered a smile onto his face and turned around to greet his caller.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Good evening, Molly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s delightful to see you.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>From the look on his Mother-in-law’s face, his jolly voice and rigour-like grimace were not fooling the woman in the slightest.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He forged ahead valiantly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I trust Rigel was well behaved?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Of course.  It was a pleasure having him, as always.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She paused, dropping her gaze from Draco’s.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You are welcome anytime.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I hope you realize that, dear.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Just because Ronald is...” she trailed off with a hitch.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">A lump formed in Draco’s throat.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Thank you Molly,” he said formally, and tried to ignore the woman’s flinch.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Perhaps when I’m less busy.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Anytime,” she said again, her tone warm and tender.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Draco blinked rapidly against the tears forming in his eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’ll send Rigel through now, shall I?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Draco nodded sharply, afraid to trust his voice.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Molly’s face disappeared, and a moment later, an over-excited five year old came bounding out of the floo.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He sprinted over to Draco, who bent down, enveloping the small boy in his arms.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Papa!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I missed you!”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I missed you too,” Draco murmured into his son’s neck.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He smelled of the Burrow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Of homemade cookies and evergreens and...well, and Ron, to be honest. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Draco pulled his face back sharply, and planted a kiss on his son’s nose.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“A bath, and bed, I think,” he announced, holding out his hand.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“And a story?” The little boy asked, his face turned up hopefully as he grasped Draco’s hand.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I’m sure that could be arranged,” Draco replied with a smile.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">———</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Draco’s life after the war was predictably unpleasant.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He and his parents had escaped sentencing in Azkaban, in large part due to Harry Potter’s testimony and Lucius turning traitor and offering up all he could on other Death Eaters.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Still, they were social pariahs, to those on both sides of the war.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Draco spent most of his time rambling about the Manor, sifting through books in the library, trying to make up for the appalling education he received in his last two years at Hogwarts.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Lucius was away a lot, providing evidence in numerous trials against the people he once called friends and allies.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Ministry used this time to bully Draco and Narcissa.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Once a fortnight or so, a group of Aurors would show up at the gate demanding entrance.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They’d stomp around, crushing Narcissa’s prize-winning Foxglove plants while they searched for dark artifacts.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Narcissa would retire to her chambers, leaving Draco to oversee the intrusion.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not like the Aurors required much input.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They confiscated anything they wanted, and asked very little before doing so.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Draco had gotten so used to the farce, he was severely taken-aback when he heard a familiar voice say, “ah, come on now Tom, put that down.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s just a book.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“A book filled with strange, dark things,” a voice answered contemptuously.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Draco peeked his head into the library, just in time to see Ron Weasley sigh and run his hand through his hair in frustration.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“No, it’s a text about alchemy, which Draco Malfoy has been studying.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We are not stealing priceless books that are no threat whatsoever.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“And how do you know it’s not a threat?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You’ve been an Auror, what?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All of three months?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And you accomplished that riding Potter’s coat tails.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Weasley took a deep breath before answering.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I know it’s not a threat because I’ve read that text before.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some of us studied in school, Tom.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Draco was greatly impressed with Weasley’s ability to keep his cool.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He had been such a hot-headed little prig back at Hogwarts.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The only thing that hinted at his present ire was the faint red tinge of his ears.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I’ll leave you to sort the library, then, as you’re such an expert,” Tom said, pushing past Weasley.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He gave Draco a murderous look as he passed.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Merlin, what a wanker,” Weasley murmured under his breath.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Draco cleared his throat, and the Auror snapped his head up.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Oh, Malfoy!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I didn’t see you there.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Weasley,” Draco said, dropping a nod.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And then, because he couldn’t help himself, he continued, “I was surprised to hear you claim to studying at school.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Weasley smirked, running his finger over the picture of the philosopher’s stone in Draco’s book.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Well, I did read this text back in first year, when we were doing some research.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“When Granger was doing some research?” Draco corrected.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Yeah, something like that,” Weasley said guiltily.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There was a small silence before the Auror continued, “sorry about Tom.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Draco examined him with a keen eye.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Weasley seemed embarrassed, although he couldn’t imagine why.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’ve become accustomed to my artifacts being stolen and my Mother’s flowers trampled to death.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Weasley snorted, saying, “you haven’t changed a bit, have ya?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Still a stuck-up, posh git who thinks he’s better than everybody else, even the bloody DMLE.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Draco put his hands up in surrender, his face a bland mask.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I have the utmost respect for the Aurors,” he said, with just enough bite for Weasley to smile.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’ve never contested a raid, or requested a single item be returned.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ve never asked for recompense for the many plants your Aurors destroyed.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Hey, they are not my Aurors,” Weasley said hotly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“And, for what it’s worth, I think these raids are a load of Hippogriff dung.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I don’t like you, and I don’t trust your dear old Dad as far as I could throw him, but I don’t think it’s fair how you are being targeted.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Thanks, Weasley.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I don’t like you either.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Weasley’s eyes crinkled up in the corners, and he let out an uncouth, braying laugh.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Despite his coarseness, Draco found himself enjoying the exchange.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was the first bit of semi-pleasant conversation he’d had with someone besides immediate family or house elves for months.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’ll get them out as soon as I’m able.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And I’ll take a look through what we’ve confiscated, get Hermione to help me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We’ll return what we can.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He stuck out his hand. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">On instinct, as a well-raised boy with impeccable manners, Draco grasped the offered hand and shook it firmly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He remembered, just a few short years ago, when he had extended his hand to Harry Potter, who had turned down Draco’s friendship in exchange for the red-headed boy in front of him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This felt different, natural even.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A logical progression in their antagonistic relationship, that had cumulated with Draco in disgrace, and Ron a valued member of the most elite force in the Wizarding world.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’ve already thanked you once,” Draco said, dropping his hand.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I hope you don’t expect a repeat performance.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Weasley just smiled, and left the room.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Within half and hour, the Auror force had left, and Draco was back in front of his text.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He couldn’t concentrate, the words jumbled in front of him, as he traced the photo where Weasley had run his finger.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">———</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“...and they lived happily ever after,” Draco said, shutting the book with an audible snap.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Rigel was cuddled up to his side, his head resting on Draco’s chest.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“They really loved each other, huh?” The boy asked, twisting around to look at Draco.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His blue, searching eyes were so much like Ron’s, it brought an ache to Draco’s chest.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“They did,” Draco said, although he was not sure he agreed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Muggle fairy tales were not his favourite, but Rigel loved them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Hermione had gifted them a huge tome when the baby was born, and as he grew, he became fascinated with the colourful but motionless pictures and the old-fashioned writing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Draco found them trite and nonsensical.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Just like you and Daddy,” Rigel said, nestling back into Draco.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Draco’s breath caught in his chest.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was afraid if he breathed, his lungs would flay apart.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I miss Daddy.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Draco finally exhaled, and drew another breath.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It felt like glass, scraping up his insides.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I know you do,” Draco said, planting a kiss on Rigel’s platinum head.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’m sorry he’s not here.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“You miss him too, Papa,” Rigel stated, almost accusingly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Draco couldn’t reply, but he supposed the tears that fell silently onto his son’s blond head were answer enough.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">———</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The next visit from the Aurors came a month later.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The increased time should have been a welcome reprieve, but in actuality had made Narcissa and Draco progressively more nervous and on edge.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When they finally arrived, tip-toeing around the gardens and nodding politely to Narcissa, Draco was at his wit’s end.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was like a tightly wound spring, ready to recoil at the slightest provocation.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He found it in the library, where Weasley was pulling books off the shelves seemingly at random.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Just what do you think you are doing?” Draco demanded.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Fucking Tom’s fault,” Ron replied, his back still to Draco.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Look, Malfoy, I know your texts were thoroughly examined before you were allowed back in the Manor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But I’ve got to look at them again.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Tom reported that he saw dark magic books in here, and even with my assurances that it was a alchemy text, the powers that be are still demanding a spot check of the library.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“And you think you are the best man for the job?” Draco asked, a sneer on his face and voice laced with venom.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Can you even read without Granger here to help you?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Weasley turned slowly to look at Draco, eyes wide with astonishment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Are you bloody serious?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’m doing you a favour here, Malfoy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Do you think anyone else would be so careful with these books?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Do you think anyone else wouldn’t just confiscate the lot, and be done with it?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Do you think anyone else would instruct the other Aurors to be mindful of your Mother’s plants?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Do you think-“</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I get the picture, Weasel.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As I said before, I’ve thanked you once, I refuse on principle to do it again for you acting like a decent human being.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Even as Draco uttered the words with disdain, his anger began to recede.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Ok, fair enough,” Weasley said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“But what I said is true. They wanted to take your whole library. I volunteered for this.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Always the Martyr,” Draco said, even though he knew it wasn’t true.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That was Potter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Weasley was hot-headed and rash, self-conscious and lacking self-esteem.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although that seemed to have changed.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Fuck you, Malfoy,” Weasley said, his ears and cheeks flushing red.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Yes, there was a glimpse of the boy from Hogwarts.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“How wonderfully unprofessional,” Draco said charmingly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You’d like that, wouldn’t you?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Weasley tilted his chin up defiantly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Maybe I would,” he said, raking his eyes up and down Draco’s body.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Draco was fully dressed in an emerald green cashmere sweater and light wool black trousers, but still felt exposed by the Auror’s bold stare.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I could report you for that,” Draco said, his voice high and tight.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Weasley turned away, shoulders stiff, back to the shelves.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“But I won’t,” he continued, just a little breathless, and he sped out of the library as fast as his legs could carry him. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">———</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">There was pile of correspondence on Draco’s office desk.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He needed to go through it, he knew that, but with each passing day, the stack grew a little taller, and it became just a little bit harder to face.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He blamed Ron, of course.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Draco prided himself on being tidy and organized.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But since Ron left, there were just some things that Draco couldn’t face, loath as he was to admit it.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">As he glared at the tower of mail, willing it shrink, a sleek grey owl swooped on and landed on the edge of Draco’s desk.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Draco made a motion to the stack, indicating the owl should drop the latest letter on top of the others.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">As the grey owl flew away, Draco caught a glimpse of Harry Potter’s childish scrawl, before the whole tower teetered ominously and tumbled off the desk to the floor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></span> <span class="s2"><em>Fucking Weasley leaving, now his annoying fucking best mate is creating a fucking mess in my fucking office,</em> </span> <span class="s1">Draco thought, sinking down to the floor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He brought his legs up to his chest, burying his face in his knees.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></span> <span class="s2">Everything was falling apart.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Including Draco himself.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">———</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Draco did the unthinkable.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He researched Ron Weasley.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It involved swallowing his pride, taking out a renewed subscription to the Daily Prophet, and requesting all the back issues he had missed since the war ended.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">There was plenty of material. Too much.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ron couldn’t seem to walk down Diagon Alley without getting photographed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Draco studied each picture intently, hoping to see something in particular.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If Ron wasn’t alone, he was with Potter, or Granger, or a red-headed, scraggly person that could only be a relation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not what Draco was looking for.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">And there wasn’t so much as a sniff about his personal life, besides his decision to join the Aurors.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No hint at a relationship, either past or present, with Granger or anyone else.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It was just...Draco had gotten the feeling that Ron was checking him out.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For real, not just as a laugh to wind him up.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And that made Draco’s chest flutter a little.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not because of Weasley in particular, mind you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Draco had just never met another Wizard who admitted to being attracted to blokes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He had been worried he was broken, somehow damaged, a sexual perversion.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But Weasley had eyed him so openly...</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Unfortunately, there was not one mention, or even a grainy photo, linking Weasley romantically to another man.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Draco would just have to wait until the next inevitable Auror visit, and hope the ginger pillock came back.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">———</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Picking up Rigel after school gave Draco purpose.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When he had first become pregnant (surprise!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Pureblood male wizards could have children together.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What a mind fuck that had been.), Draco had despaired leaving his job at Gringott’s. However, it wasn’t long before the rapidly growing fetus became too much for his ill-equipped, fragile male body, and he was confined to bed rest.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>By the time Rigel was born, Draco couldn’t contemplate leaving him in someone else’s care all day, so he decided to stay home and raise the boy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was still able to do some work from home, and visited the office from time to time when Ron or Molly could look after for Rigel.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">This year, Rigel had begun to attend a small Muggle school, close to the house.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The boy’s magic had not manifested yet, and Draco had instilled the need to keep the Wizarding world a secret from Muggles.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">His son was a whirlwind of activity on the walk home, jumping from one story to the next, grabbing crayon scribbles out of his pack and shoving them into Draco’s hands.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“...and at snack, Susie sneezed, and she didn’t cover her nose, and a bogey dripped out, right onto her apple slices.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was wicked!”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Wicked,” Draco head Ron say in his mind, a memory of a devilish, cat-like grin on his handsome face, reaching out with a tanned arm to bring Draco closer to his body. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Draco shook the memory off.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“That’s disgusting!” he exclaimed, poking Rigel in the side.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Yup.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And funny!” The boy replied happily.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Another piece of paper hit Draco’s hands.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“This one’s for the Father’s Day football game next week,” Rigel said excitedly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You’ll come, right Papa?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I wouldn’t miss it,” Draco said, rubbing his hand through his son’s hair.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Rigel looked at him and smiled, his eyes crinkling in the corners, just like his Dad’s.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then his smile dropped a little, and he said sadly, “Daddy will miss it thought, won’t he?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Draco’s heart fell to his stomach like a lead balloon.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’m afraid so,” he said shortly, trying to keep his tone normal and even.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Rigel gripped Draco’s hand, and they finished their walk in silence, both thinking of the tall, freckled man with the booming laugh and the wide smile who had left such a big hole in their lives.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">———</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Draco had been expecting a troop of Aurors.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What he got was Weasley, slouched and uncomfortable looking, followed by a bushy head of hair with her face stuck in a book.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“S’up, Malfoy?” Ron mumbled.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He shoved a cardboard box into Draco’s arms.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Thought you might like your stuff back - this lot’s all been cleared.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Uh, thank you?” Draco replied, making it into a question.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He stared pointedly at his other ‘guest’.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Oh, yeah.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Hermione helped.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And then she wanted to come along.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ron stopped talking, but mouthed silently to Draco, “she forced me to bring her.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Draco wanted to laugh, but instead just shook his head and cleared his throat.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Granger?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The girl popped her head up from her book, looking nonplussed to find herself in Malfoy Manor’s entryway.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“How can I be of assistance?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Ron, give him the...oh, you did already, good.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Granger strode forward, tapping the box in Draco’s hands.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Pull each artifact out separately.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The box has been magically enhanced to hold a great number of items.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She turned her head, and started stalking down the hallway.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Where’s your library?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Draco looked at Ron, who shrugged his shoulders, chagrined.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Yes, please do make yourself at home, Granger.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s this way,” Draco said, catching up with her.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He grabbed the text out of her hands as he passed.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Hey,” Hermione said, fingers outstretched to reclaim the book. “I wasn’t done reading that.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“You are now,” Draco answered irritably.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Meanwhile, Weasley followed in their wake, silent as a shadow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Once they were all in the library, Draco summoned a house elf and requested tea.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He saw Granger wrinkle her nose out of the corner of his eye.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Before you start giving away your manky socks, please know that our elves all receive fair wages, and are free to leave at anytime, should they so desire.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Hermione gave a little sniff, but she seemed mollified.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Tea was an awkward affair, where Draco became more and more high strung, Weasley remained mute, and Granger gazed around the library unabashedly, a look of total adoration in her eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Finally, Draco couldn’t stand it anymore.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“So, are you two love’s young dream?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Huh?” Weasley asked dully. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Draco spared him a glance before focusing on Granger.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Pardon?” she asked, and at least had the good grace to look sheepish at her lack of attention.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“The two of you,” Draco said, his voice louder and shriller than he would like.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He gestured between them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You are an item?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A couple?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You are stepping out together?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Me and Ron?” Hermione asked, like Draco was being totally ludicrous.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“No!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What gave you that idea?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Draco flopped back in his chair.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Why are you here, Granger, if not to support your boyfriend?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Books,” Weasley and Granger answered at the same time.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Granger smiled at the red head.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“The alchemy text Ronald brought to the Ministry I had of course seen before, but did you know it is a first edition?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That book is hundreds of years old!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You have to let me borrow your books.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I have to?” Draco asked, arching one brow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He turned to Weasley.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Is this a new Auror request?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Weasley shook his head, as Granger snorted and said, “no, of course not!”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“So then why would I allow you to take my books out of my library?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As you so rightfully mentioned, many are first editions; quite rare, and valuable.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Draco steepled his hands in front of his face.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Well, because all that knowledge should be shared!” Granger stated with conviction.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“And just how many books do you think you should be allowed to take?” Draco wondered, his voice smooth as silk.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hermione looked at Ron, trying to figure out the lay of the land.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Five at a time?” she said, somewhat hesitantly.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Draco smiled a cruel smile, and laughed a merciless laugh.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“No, I don’t think so Granger.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You see, these aren’t my books, they are my Father’s.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“But...but,” Granger said, looking around the shelves desperately. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Draco realized he’d never get rid of her at this rate, and what Draco really wanted was to get Ron Weasley, who was apparently NOT dating Granger, alone.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’ll make you a deal.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You can take one book-“ Hermione opened her mouth to interrupt.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Draco held up his hand, raised his voice, and continued, “one book.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At the end of the week, you may send it back with Weasley here.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If the book is still in pristine condition, I will send another one.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“How about three a week?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“One,” Draco said firmly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“That’s the offer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Take it or leave it.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Fine,” Hermione said begrudgingly, “but that’s not very nice of you.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“No one’s ever accused me of being nice,” Draco said, baring his teeth in a semblance of a smile.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Pommy!” Draco yelled.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Please show Miss Granger out.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">A little house elf appeared, clad in all black, with an elegant blue scarf tied jauntily around her ears.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She started pulling on Granger’s arm, who grabbed a book at random from a shelf and clutched it to her chest.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Ron?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Are you coming?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“No, I’ve got some business to take care of,” he replied, his eyes boring into Draco. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Once alone, Ron sat forward in his seat, elbows on his knees.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Did you really just volunteer me to come back here once a week?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Would that really be such a hardship?” Draco shot back.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Salazar, Weasley really brought out his prickly side.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They continued to stare at each other.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Draco could feel his heart rate increasing as the atmosphere got more charged.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Something had to give.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Fuck it,” he said, pushing himself out of his chair and closing the gap between himself and Weasley in three steps.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He landed in the other man’s lap, wrapping his arms around Ron’s neck and bringing their faces so close, he could feel Weasley’s breath on his cheek.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Weasley’s eyes were blown wide, either with shock or lust, and that pushed Draco over the edge, fully into madness.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He moved his hands to grip the thick, red hair by Weasley’s ears, and firmly pressed his lips to Ron’s.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Weasley gasped, and Draco used it to his advantage, sliding his tongue into Ron’s mouth.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Weasley brought his hands to Draco’s waist, pulling him in closer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Draco felt a jolt of elation course through his body.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was happening!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was kissing another boy, and that boy was kissing back, and...Draco’s mind was blowing, because it was Ron fucking Weasley, and Draco was sitting in his lap, but somehow it was perfect.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Absolutely fucking perfect, and Draco didn’t want to ever stop kissing Ron, who was now biting his way down Draco’s jaw, moving to his neck.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I’m not even sure I like you,” Ron muttered into Draco’s neck, before sucking a rather large bruise into the pale skin there.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Well, that was an improvement from Weasley’s previous declaration of ‘I don’t like you.’</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I’m not sure I like you either”, Draco replied, tilting his head to give Weasley better access.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“But don’t stop.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For the love of Salazar, don’t stop.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Draco felt Weasley smile into the crook of his neck.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I won’t,” he said, pulling his face back up until he was looking at Draco once more.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I don’t think I could stop if I wanted to.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And he leaned forward, catching Draco’s lips in a searing kiss.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">———</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Hey, Draco.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Draco whipped around, clutching his purchases to his chest.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He had just picked up a few new robes and casual items he ordered for Rigel.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The boy was outgrowing his clothes at an alarming rate.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Leaning against the brick wall of Madam Malkin’s was Harry Potter, Hermione Granger standing at attention next to him.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Hello Harry.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Granger,” Draco said, moving to walk past them.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hermione stepped in his way.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Do you have time for a chat?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There’s a new tea house around the corner, I hear they serve fancy Muggle coffees with so much caffeine it’s like drinking a pepper-up potion.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Were you waiting here for me?” Draco asked, bristling at thought of being ambushed by Ron’s friends.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hermione shot a questioning look at Potter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Uh, maybe?” she said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“We just wanted to see you.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Send an owl, like a normal person,” Draco sniffed, trying in vain to get around Granger once again.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I have,” Harry stated, pushing off of the wall.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“We all have.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You don’t answer any of them.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Then take a bloody hint,” Draco muttered, remembering guiltily the pile of letters stacked on his desk, Potter’s the one that made them all come crashing down.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He threw his hands up in the air in exasperation, dropping his parcels as Hermione blocked his escape route once more.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Granger bent down and picked up Draco’s items.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You’re avoiding us.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Anyone who was close to Ron.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s not healthy, Draco-“</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Don’t,” Draco said menacingly, pointing his finger at Hermione.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Don’t pretend that we are mates.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ron’s gone, now you lot can be shot of me too.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>How lucky for you.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hermione gasped, stepping back into Harry, who slung an arm over her shoulder.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“We ARE your mates,” Harry called after him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You can’t chase us away.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We’ll be here, when you need us.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When you are ready.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Oh, go fuck yourself,” Draco mumbled.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>An elderly witch who looked a great deal like Professor McGonagall, disappointed gaze and all, tutted at him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Draco spun on the spot, disapperating to the safety of his own home, where none of Ron’s friends could lie in wait and accost him.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">———</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Draco Malfoy and Ronald Weasley.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ron and Draco.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ferret and Weasel.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No matter how one looked at it, what they had shouldn’t have worked.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Every week Draco wondered if this would be the time Ron didn’t show up.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If he’d just send an owl with Draco’s book, maybe a scribbled note with something along the lines of, </span> <span class="s2"> <em>I’ve come to my senses, found a non ex death eater to fuck.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Regards, Weasley.</em> </span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">But then there he would be, in all his broad shouldered, towering glory.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Using his physical strength against Draco in a way that drove him wild.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Kissing him sweetly while he petted Draco’s body, learning all the little secrets hidden beneath the starched, expensive robes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Listening to Draco’s anecdotes and puffing light laughter in his ear as he nibbled on Draco’s ear lobe.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They grew careless.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or maybe Draco had never cared about proprietary in the first place, and had dragged Weasley along with him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One morning, as the winter sun was just beginning to peek over the horizon, the door to Draco’s chambers burst open.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lucius stood silhouetted in the doorway, his wand drawn, face marred with disgust and shame.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“How dare you, you filthy blood traitor!”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ron sprung instantly awake, pulling his arms away from the blond boy he was wrapped around.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They were both naked, haven fallen asleep on top of Draco’s impressive four poster bed after a frantic evening of mutual orgasms.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’ll kill you for this!”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lucius levelled his wand at Ron, pointing straight at his heart.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Dirty, despicable, wanton acts of depravity in my house!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You’ll pay Weasley.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Ron scrambled backwards on the bed, and ended up falling off, landing on the floor in a heap of flailing limbs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He sprung up, tossing his head back and forth, seeking an exit.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His wand was across the room, in his robe pocket, folded neatly over the chair at Draco’s desk.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Even if he could summon it wordlessly, by the time he caught it, Lucius would have hexed him into oblivion.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Lucius took a menacing step forward, jabbed his wand in Ron’s direction, and opened his mouth.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Avad-</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“NO!” Draco shouted.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Waking up to his Father threatening his lover at wand point had left Draco immobilized with fear, but he found his nerve now.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He threw himself in front of Ron, arms outstretched, legs akimbo.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“No, Father.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Don’t hurt him.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Step aside, Draco.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ll deal with you later,” he sneered, and Draco flinched.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Is that what he had looked like, all those years, when he tried his best to mirror his Father’s actions?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I won’t let this...this blood traitor besmirch the Malfoy name one moment longer.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Lucius flicked his wand at his son, who skidded out of the way, falling back on the bed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ron was helpless, his hands up in the air in surrender.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But instead of looking at Lucius, he was gazing at Draco, a wistful smile tugging at the corners of his mouth.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“STOP!” Draco screamed, scrambling to cover Ron once more.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Give me one good reason why I shouldn’t hex this vile boy into the middle of next week,” Lucius said, distain dripping from his words.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Draco turned at looked at Weasley.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Glorious Ron, naked and beautiful.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In that moment, Draco came to a sudden, crushing realization.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Because I love him,” he answered, still focused on Ron.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The other boy’s eyes widened, and his mouth fell open.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Behind him, Draco heard a gurgling, strangled noise, before Lucius fell over in a dead faint. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Ron turned away towards his robes, and Draco felt his heart drop out of his chest.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Obviously he was going to leave.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was an Auror for Salazar’s sake, there was never any real hope for the two of them. And after Lucius’s little stunt, who could blame Ron for running?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Draco stood and watched as Ron grasped his robe.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He withdrew his wand, pointed it at Lucius, and sent his prone body flying backwards out of the room.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then Ron locked the door with an audible click.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Ron prowled forward towards Draco, like a predator stalks its prey.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He gripped Draco’s wrists hard in one hand, backing them both up until Draco’s ass hit the wall.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ron proceeded to silently worship Draco’s body.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He sucked and kissed behind Draco’s ears, the junction of his neck, his collar bones, his nipples.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ron let go of Draco’s wrists, and fell to his knees, licking the plains of Draco’s abs, curling his tongue around the faint smattering of blond hair leading down.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His hands came up to Draco’s thighs, and he rubbed them up and down, touching him lightly behind the knee, trailing light, burning touches all the way to his groin.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Draco’s breath was coming in short, hard pants.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Little mews of pleasure escaped his lips.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He dug his hands into Ron’s hair, doing his best to ground himself.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His whole body was alight and feverish.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Each of Ron’s touches felt amplified, like his nerve endings were on fire.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I want you,” Draco said, openly, plainly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Slytherin inside him cringed at the admission, but after his previous declaration of love, he really didn’t have anything left to lose.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Ron smiled up at him, and stood back up, grabbing Draco’s hand and leading them over to the bed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They had done so much together in the last few weeks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Discovered so many ways to pull pleasure from each other’s bodies.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But they had always stopped short of this.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Perhaps they hadn’t been ready, until this exact moment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Now all Draco wanted was to feel Ron inside him, to be owned by him, filled by him, surrounded by him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was sentimental and foolish, and not something a Malfoy should desire, but that just made Draco want it all the more.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Finally, he was making a decision for himself.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not for his parents, or some evil overlord.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was doing something that made him happy.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Ron laid him out, sprawled on his back on the satin sheets, a beautiful alabaster vision.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They kissed languidly until Draco was dizzy with it, Ron stroking his side and frotting against him leisurely.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I want you,” Draco said again, and Ron’s breath hitched.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Their kisses became more frenzied.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ron inched a hand down, lightly stroking Draco’s cock, falling further to rub his balls, before finding Draco’s furled hole.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He petted his index finger over it, increasing the pressure with each stroke as Draco gasped and let his legs fall open.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Lube,” Draco said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He didn’t trust himself to preform the charm properly, so he grabbed a tube out of his bedside drawer and threw it to Weasley.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Draco was rewarded with another blazing kiss.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ron’s finger drew away, and was replaced a second later, warm and slick. The teasing petting began again, until it was all Draco could do to keep himself from thrusting onto Ron’s hand.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Ron moved to Draco’s neck, mouthing at the tendon with little kitten licks, which he knew drove Draco wild.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Draco moaned, low and deep, shaking with want.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The finger petting his arsehole slowed, applying more pressure, until the tip slipped in.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ron stilled for a moment, before inching forward until his finger was all the way in Draco’s hole.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It felt weird, but in a good way.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And once Ron started pumping it in and out, Draco felt his body respond, craving more.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“You are so hot, so tight,” Ron murmured, breaking his silence, and moved up to plant a kiss on Draco’s temple.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Draco could have cried: at Ron’s tenderness, at the fact that he stayed, at the way their bodies fit perfectly together.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Another slick finger probed Draco’s entrance.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There was more of a burn this time, but after a few slides, Ron curved his fingers, and sparks of pleasure burned through Draco.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Each thrust of Ron’s fingers hit a hidden spot of ecstasy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Draco knew he wouldn’t last long.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He gazed up at Ron, whose wide, blue eyes were trained on the point where his fingers disappeared into Draco’s body, and thought, </span> <span class="s2"><em>I love him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I actually do love this rumpled Gryffindor</em>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></span> <span class="s1">Draco grasped his cock, stroking in time to Ron’s fingers moving deliciously in and out of his ass.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ron groaned when his eyes moved to watch Draco pump his own cock.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A few more thrusts, a particularly clever curve of Ron’s fingers, and Draco was spilling all over his chest, writhing in euphoria, lazily pushing his bum down onto Ron’s hand.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Draco felt pliant and content.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I still want you,” he said, pulling Ron down.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He slipped his tongue in Ron’s mouth, thrilling at the urgency with which Ron responded.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ron fumbled for a moment with the bottle of lube, coated his cock, and lined himself up at Draco’s entrance.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There was a bit of pain; a bit of a stretch and a burn, but Draco was so fuzzily happy, he didn’t really mind.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And the fullness felt good.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ron was inside of him, joining them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ron’s eyes were once again fascinated with Draco’s hole, watching his cock slip in and out at a maddeningly slow pace.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He gripped Draco’s hips tight, marking him with his fingers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ron started gasping almost immediately, pumping his cock into Draco’s ass only a handful of times before his face turned slack, and Draco felt his insides grow even warmer.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">In the afterglow, Ron gathered Draco up into his arms.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“So, you love me, huh?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Shut up, Weasley,” Draco said, without any real heat. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Ron kissed Draco’s cheek.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Wanna go out for dinner tonight?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“In public?” Draco asked.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They had never left the Manor before.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They’d never done anything but fool around.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Draco had been sure the whole thing was just a fling.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A fun bit of experimentation, nothing more.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Until Lucius Malfoy burst into the room, and Draco was forced to confront his feelings.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Yes, in public.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Isn’t that what boyfr...” Weasley stumbled on the word, but plowed ahead heroically, “...what boyfriends do?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Go on dates?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Yeah, ok,” Draco said nonchalantly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But the huge smile on his face rather betrayed his emotions. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Your Dad is gonna kill me,” Ron said, chuckling as he ran a hand through Draco’s hair.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Good thing I’m an Auror.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“And I’m worth it,” Draco said, hoping it was true.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“And you’re worth it,” Ron agreed.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">———</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Papa’s sad,” Draco heard Rigel say.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Who was he talking to?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Deep down, Draco knew he should get up and investigate.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Make sure his son was ok.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">But he couldn’t. His whole body was heavy, weighing him down, pinning him to the couch.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was exhausted, mentally and physically, and couldn’t even summon the energy to open his eyes, let alone stand up and look for his son.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It didn’t matter, anyway.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Draco was insignificant.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Unworthy of being loved, by anyone, even Rigel. That was why Ron had left.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Obviously. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The floo flared in the other room, signalling the arrival of a guest.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Draco clenched his eyes shut even tighter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Terror gripped his body.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He needed to protect Rigel. If only he could get his leaden limbs to obey.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Draco?” Molly called, as she walked into the living room.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Can you help Papa, Granny Molly?” Rigel asked, his sweet voice tinged with worry.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Draco cracked one eye open.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’m fine,” he croaked, consumed with guilt.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He couldn’t even look after his son properly.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Molly crouched down to speak to Rigel.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It’s Sunday, do you know what that means?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Brunch?” Rigel asked hesitantly, sending another fretful look Draco’s way.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“That’s right!” Molly proclaimed, a bright smile on her face.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’ve made my famous apple pasties, and Grandpa is whipping up his special pancakes as we speak.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Does that sound good?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Rigel nodded, a tentative smile creeping over his face.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Let’s go to the Burrow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We’ll send someone back to help Papa.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Draco closed his eye, feeling nauseous at the thought.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I’m fine,” he tried to say again, but Molly cut him off.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“You are not,” she said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She didn’t sound angry, or disappointed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>More like...heartbroken.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You’re family, Draco, whether you can face it or not.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And family sticks together.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Molly and Rigel left, leaving Draco in merciful silence.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Merlin, he was useless.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Just good for nothing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A blight on society, no matter what Molly said.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The floo flared again, and Draco steeled himself for he arrival of Potter, or Granger.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One of Ronald’s best mates, there to tell him that life was grand, everything would be fine.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The couch dipped at the end, and a strong pair of hands brought Draco’s feet to their lap.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Draco kept his eyes closed, trying to remain as small and inconsequential as possible.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Clever fingers began to massage his instep, bringing a sob to Draco’s throat.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ron had been a master at rubbing Draco’s feet, especially when he was pregnant and aching.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With a sudden surge of energy he sat up, pulling his feet away and looking at his visitor.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“George,” Draco stated in a flat voice.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Draco,” George replied kindly.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“What are you doing here?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Whatever you need me to do,” George said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“We can sit in silence, if you want.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or I can make you a bite.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or we can talk about Ron-“ Draco squawked, and George smiled before continuing, “it’s up to you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The one thing I won’t do is leave.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Why not?” Draco asked sullenly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“What if I want to be alone?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Then I’ll sit here and say nothing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You won’t even know I’m here.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>George pulled Draco’s feet back into his lap, and Draco sank down into the cushions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He tried to get comfortable, but he kept sneaking glances at George.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His hair was more carroty, his nose less pointy and body more willowy, but his resemblance to Ron was still painfully strong.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“You and your family should leave me alone.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Your brother left me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He didn’t want me anymore.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Shhh, Draco, you know that’s not true.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“It is true!” Draco stated hotly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“He left me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He...left...me,” Draco said around a large sob.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Out of nowhere he was weeping uncontrollably, pulling in huge gusts of air and making small, grunting cries.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“He didn’t want to,” George said, picking Draco up and placing him in his lap.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He wrapped his arms firmly around the sobbing man. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“He did.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He did!” Draco screeched.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’m nothing.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“You are not nothing,” George said firmly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“And you were everything to Ron.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Then why did he leave me?” Draco whispered.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“He didn’t want to, Draco,” George answered, his voice thick with tears.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“He loved you more than anything.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Then he should have stayed safe.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He should have quit his risky job, gone to work with you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He should never have-“ Draco choked on a sob, his body wracked with tremors.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“He was working on it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You know he was, Draco.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was a freak accident-“</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Fuck you!” Draco screamed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Fuck you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He left me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Do you know how that feels?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He left me!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He’s gone!”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">George tightened his grip, rocking Draco to and fro.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I know how it feels to lose my two favourite brothers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And while that might not compare to the death of a husband, I do have an idea of what you are going through, Draco.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Draco keened, an animalistic cry pulled from his core.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He felt shattered, wrung out. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“It was a freak accident.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There was nothing you, or Ron, or anyone could have done to prevent it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Fuck, I’m sorry, Draco.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It sucks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s shitty, and unfair, and nothing I can say will ever make it right.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But Ron did love you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sometimes we questioned his sanity, he loved you so much, little uptight prick that you are.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One thing I know for certain is Ron would never have left you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not willingly.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>George stopped rocking Draco, who had gone limp in his arms.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You and Rigel were everything to him.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I miss him,” Draco admitted, for the first time.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It brought a renewed torrent of tears to his eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I miss him, George, so fucking much.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But I’m angry, too.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I can’t help it, I’m so furious at him.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I know,” George said soothingly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I know, Draco.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s normal to feel that way.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I felt abandoned, when Fred died. I couldn’t believe he would go on without me.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Yes,” Draco agreed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I feel abandoned, too.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I know it’s not rational-“</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Don’t,” George said firmly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You don’t have to be rational.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But you do need to work through it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At least for Rigel’s sake.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I know,” Draco said, feeling a small flutter of happiness when he thought of his son.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Ron will live on through him, and the memories the two of you shared,” George said, patting Draco’s knee.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Now, I know everything isn’t instantly better after our little talk, but do you feel well enough to come visit the Burrow for brunch?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Draco pictured all the Weasley’s, looking at him with a mixture of pity and love, and shied away.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“No, not today.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Maybe soon.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“How about eating a sketchy take-away with me and Charlie in the flat above the shop?” George asked.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Angelina and the kids are at her parents.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What do you say?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Ok,” Draco said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He willed his body to stand, and his limbs complied with very little effort.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The heaviness seeping into his bones had receded a bit.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Just enough to propel Draco to the floo, the tiniest sliver bit of hope blooming in his chest.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">———</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Marry me,” Ron said, his face buried in Draco’s bare chest.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“You cretin!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That’s no way to ask a man to marry you!” Draco said jokingly. They had spent a rigorous morning in bed, and Draco had just brought up coffee and fruit for them to munch on.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Ron sat back and smirked at Draco.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Ok, how’s this?” he asked, face turning solemn.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Draco Malfoy, from the moment I met you, you got under my skin.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I can’t stop thinking about you, I can’t stop dreaming about you, and I want to spend every moment with you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Will you marry me?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“What?” Draco asked throatily.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Is this some kind of joke?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“No joke,” Ron said, reaching to grab his trousers from the floor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Inside the pocket was a ring box, which he handed to Draco.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He flipped it open to reveal the silver antique ring that had caught his eye weeks before, when they were shopping together in Hogsmeade.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I love you, Draco.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Marry me.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Yes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Yes!” Draco smiled, slipping the ring on his finger.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“So, you love me, huh?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Shut up Malfoy,” Ron replied, shoving Draco’s head into his pillow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Of course I do.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">———</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It was another gloomy, rainy day, and Draco stood staring out the window, hands behind his back, watching the water trail down the window in winding rivulets. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Are you ready, son?” Narcissa asked in a gentle voice.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“As I’ll ever be,” Draco replied. They made their way outside, Draco holding an umbrella over their heads, Narcissa with a bouquet of flowers clutched tight in her hands.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It was a fair walk to their destination, but they still arrived too soon for Draco’s liking.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The scenery was beautiful, that much Draco could admit.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A small pond was just a stone’s throw away.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Draco inhaled deeply, the smell of evergreens flooding his senses, reminding him again of Ron.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Behind him stood Narcissa, and a little further back, a group of Ron’s family and closest friends.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They were there to silently support Draco.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Draco stepped forward, moving towards the large marker under a pine tree.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Somewhere in the distance, and owl hooted.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Draco read the text, tears welling up in his eyes.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s2"> <em>Ronald Bilius Weasley</em> </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s2"> <em>Loving husband</em> </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s2"> <em>Devoted father</em> </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s2"> <em>Beloved by his family and friends</em> </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Draco trailed one finger over the inscription, pushing in to trace the word husband.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The tears streamed steadily down his face now.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Mom?” Draco said, holding out his hand.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He hadn’t called Narcissa anything other than Mother in over twenty years, but it felt right today.</span>

  <span class="s1">She gripped his hand, giving it a squeeze, and said, “remember when he got the Aurors to stop ruining my flower gardens?”</span>
