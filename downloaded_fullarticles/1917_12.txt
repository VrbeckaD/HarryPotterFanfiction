    <p><i>“We’ve got to go for help,“ Hermione cried. She was bleeding too; the Willow had cut her across the shoulder.</i> “Wait - take out the map. We can see where they’ve gone.”

Harry snatched it from his pocket, smoothed it out and scanned it. Ron’s and Black’s dots were disappearing down the tunnel, and with them was... Peter Pettigrew? Harry racked his brains. “Hermione... does that name sound familiar to you?”</p><p>She covered her hand with her mouth. “Oh, my God. He’s supposed to be dead, Harry. Remember, we heard McGonagall and Hagrid discussing it at Hogsmeade?”</p><p>“Well, the map must be wrong, then,” said Harry, oddly disappointed. He had never known it to steer them wrong before.</p><p>They exchanged frightened glances. Hermione’s eyes were wide. “We can’t take on a full-grown wizard and — and whoever else is in there. Not by ourselves!”</p><p>“I know,” said Harry testily. “Hang on a minute and let me look at the Map.” He scanned the grounds, the lakeside and the Great Hall and found no teachers, not even Sprout. Of course, they’d all be up at the castle now, in their common rooms. Except Snape, and there was no way he was going to go to that quarter for help.</p><p>With a rush of relief he noticed Lupin was closest, still in his classroom on the third floor.</p><p>“I’ll go - stay there!” Harry bolted for the main building, faster than he’d ever run from Dudley’s gang. When he burst into the DADA classroom, Lupin looked up, surprised. “Harry,” he started.</p><p>“Professor,” Harry gasped. “Black - Black’s taken Ron!”</p><p>Lupin stared. “What do you mean, Black’s taken Ron?”</p><p>“I mean Sirius Black,” snapped Harry. He took a deep breath. “We were - were following him, and he turned into a dog and dragged Ron into a tunnel under the Whomping Willow. The Map says he’s got someone called Peter Pettigrew helping him. Hermione’s waiting outside the tunnel.” Yanking the map from his robes, he thrust it under Lupin’s nose.</p><p>Lupin glanced at the map, then swore. He threw some Floo Powder into the fireplace, and shouted, “Severus Snape!”</p><p>Snape‘s head appeared in the flames. “What is it, Lupin?” he asked. “Do you require a minder to take a simple dose of potion, now?“ His eyes moved beyond Lupin to where Harry was standing. “Ah, Potter, our star Defence pupil. If I have been lucky beyond my wildest dreams and managed to poison Lupin, do be gracious enough to clean up the mess.” Harry grimaced - so much for avoiding Snape.</p><p>“Severus,” said Lupin, far more calmly than Harry would have thought possible. “Sirius Black’s taken Ron Weasley to the tunnel under the Whomping Willow. And... he appears to have an accomplice.”</p><p>Snape sneered. “Indeed?” he said. “Dear me, what dangerous creatures the headmaster lets in.” In one movement he stepped through the fireplace, wand in hand. He pointed it towards the empty goblet on Lupin’s desk and muttered, “Aguamenti. Portus.” The goblet  juddered, glowed and righted itself. “Potter, grab hold of the other end. Lupin, you take the long way.” He smirked.</p><p>Harry seized the other end, relieved that the adults were taking over. He couldn‘t have run all the way back to the grounds if he’d wanted to; he felt as though someone had cast Jelly-Legs on him. </p><p>“On three, Potter. One, two, three!” Snape tapped the goblet. There was the feeling of a hook behind his navel and a sickening whirling sensation. Harry felt as though he was being squeezed from all directions, crushed from skull to ankle, as though his brain was about to leak out through his teeth; it was worse even than being Petrified.</p><p>As soon as they touched solid ground, Harry’s knees buckled. Dozens of chocolate frogs were doing somersaults in his stomach, he thought — and then disgorged his dinner with gusto into the nearest bush.</p><p>He thought he heard a snort from Snape. “Get up, Potter,” he demanded, hauling Harry up by the elbow so that the ground tilted nauseatingly away from him. Snape’s conjured glass of water did nothing to ease his nerves.</p><p>While Hermione ran to meet them, Snape Engorged a nearby branch. Then, like lightning, he darted under the tree and used the stick to jab at a knot on the trunk. The tree stilled; Snape emerged, with a cut on his cheek where the Willow had caught it. </p><p>
  <i>Harry went first. He crawled forwards, head first, and slid down the earthy slope towards a very long tunnel. They moved as fast as they could, bent almost double. On and on went the passage. All Harry could think of was Ron, and what Black might be doing to him... he was drawing breath in sharp, painful gasps, running at a crouch...</i>
</p><p>
  <i>And then the tunnel began to rise. Moments later, it twisted and opened out, and Harry pulled himself out of the hole. Snape and Hermione followed, so close that Harry could hear their robes swish.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>They were in a room, a disordered, dusty room. Paper was peeling from the walls; there were stains all over the floor; every piece of furniture was smashed or broken. The windows were all boarded up. A door to the right stood open, leading to a shadowy hallway.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>“Lumos,” he whispered. Behind him, Snape and Hermione did the same. Quietly as they could, they crept along the hallway and up the crumbling staircase. Everything was covered in a thick layer of dust except the floor, where a wide, shiny stripe had been made by something being dragged along it.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>Ron, thought Harry, with a fresh wave of nausea. He crept towards the door, and flung it open. On the floor, clutching his leg, which stuck out at a strange angle, was Ron.</i>
</p><p>“Expel- “</p><p>“Protego!” roared Snape. Ron’s wand flew out of one wizened hand, and Black collapsed to the ground as though he was a puppet whose strings had been cut. Kicking the unconscious man aside, <i>Snape knelt at Ron’s side and muttered, “Ferula.” Bandages spun up Ron's leg, strapping it tightly to a splint.</i> Ron moaned in pain; Hermione gave a dry sob and went to kneel beside him. Then there was a light tread on the stair, and Lupin came in. He looked, thought Harry, even more haggard than he had twenty minutes ago.</p><p>“Keep back,” cried Hermione. She pointed a trembling wand at Lupin. “Sir, he’s a werewolf!”</p><p>“I know that, you idiot girl,” said Snape poisonously, rounding on her. “He is also quiescent thanks to THE POTION I BREWED! Now get out of the way!” She shrank back and glared at him.</p><p>Lupin gave her a wan smile. “Professor Snape is right, Hermione. It’s quite safe.” He glanced around the tiny room. “Where is he? Where’s Pettigrew?” 

Startled - he’d almost forgotten about Pettigrew in all the commotion - Harry dashed to the far wall of the little shack, and paused. “He’s not here, Professor,” he said, mystified. There was no way he could’ve got out of the door. Did Pettigrew have an invisibility cloak?</p><p>

Lupin went very still. He drew in a long  breath, nose actually twitching. Then he walked up to Ron and asked, “Ron, show me your rat.” </p>
