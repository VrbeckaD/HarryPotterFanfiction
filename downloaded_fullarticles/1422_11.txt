    <p>He wasn’t quite sure when it all became so real.</p>
<p>Was it when the number of births per year started declining and more and more people were finding they were sterile? Or was it when they first took over the government and started changing the laws? Or was it when they began dragging many of the lower class young men in for testing to see if they carried that one mysterious gene that could be part of the answer, as well as the young women who were still fertile? </p>
<p>Maybe it was then. They refused to share the results of the tests, whether positive or negative, but soon he found out when they came for him again. He’d tried to run when he saw the van approaching, but they caught him. Of course they did.</p>
<p>Maybe it was when he’d been forced to have the surgery. He still wasn’t entirely sure what they did or how they did it since science was never his strong point at school and nobody would tell him. Yes, it must have been then: waking up and finding that he was now every bit as fertile as the young women they had started gathering up, and fertile in the same way.</p>
<p>He could now give birth.</p>
<p>It was strange because everything looked as it did before on the outside: he was still as male as before, only now something inside worked differently. Apparently they had made him infertile in getting other people pregnant, but he could get pregnant and safely give birth himself.</p>
<p>Or maybe it was actually when he and the others who had passed this test were sent into the Centres with the fertile women. Handmaids, they were called now. As a group, they were majority female but there were some men now too. They wanted as many bodies as possible to carry babies, not caring whether those bodies were male or female, willing or not. As long as they could birth then they still had their use. He had to admit to himself, this must be better than what was waiting in the Colonies.</p>
<p>But maybe it was when he was assigned to his first household, when they were sure that he had been tamed enough to be privileged with the honour of carrying the child of a Commander. That made it real for sure. The Commander himself was an awful man, as evil as they came, and he revelled in his position as one of the most powerful men in this new country. He held that power over everyone in the household, including his Handmaid. Especially his Handmaid. And the Wife, she hadn’t been too kind either. Most likely she was jealous, having to act as an extra when her husband attempted to get someone else pregnant. Someone who could carry the baby. It hadn’t happened, so he had been moved to a new house instead.</p>
<p>That was undoubtedly when it truly became real. The high feeling when he had been told that he would be escaping this household, these cruel people, and then the low feeling when they told him it was just so the same could be done to him elsewhere.</p>
<p>But here was different.</p>
<p>He was still unsure sometimes, it felt so wrong. No, it felt too right, too normal in this now abnormal world. The Commander and the Wife were kind and good and fair. They treated their Marthas and Guardians as almost equals. Of course, nobody outside of the house knew this, so when he had first arrived they had acted as all other households did, worried that the brainwashing of the Handmaids meant he would give them away, give them all up for their treason.</p>
<p>But he didn’t.</p>
<p>Soon, he had been befriended by both of the Guardians, James and Peter, as well as the two Marthas, Lily and Fleur. They began to trust him enough to slowly reveal how this household really worked, how everyone was treated like a human being, like before this whole nightmare. Then came the greater secrets: the budding relationships between Lily and James, and between Fleur and the Wife, Nymphadora. Only he was told never to call her that; she preferred to go by her own maiden name Tonks.</p>
<p>Nobody else called their masters and mistresses by anything other than a title of respect. This still took a bit of time getting used to.</p>
<p>But, for Sirius, it was never so real as when he began developing these feelings for the Commander, Remus Lupin. He was a rich and powerful man, Sirius knew this due to his new name: Ofremus. But they never called him that, he noticed the Commander flinch every time that name was mentioned because it made this young man of similar age just one of his possessions. The Commander seemed to be avoiding him, leaving any room Sirius entered or actively trying not to glance in his direction whenever that he could not leave. In fact, they were so distant that the dreadful Ceremony in which the Commander would attempt to impregnate the Handmaid did not occur. Tonks shuddered at the thought of aiding a rape and Remus did not see it as a duty because it was so abhorrent.</p>
<p>He wouldn’t hurt a fly, Tonks said. We’ll just let people think it’s happening. Don’t worry, no one will touch you here without your consent.</p>
<p>The feelings had started when Remus started to open up more to Sirius after he expressed his gratitude at not being raped and treated as he had been in his previous household. Remus seemed shocked that Sirius had been treated so badly that he thought he needed to say thank you for not being taken against his will. Remus was still master of the house, but he was kind to everyone who ranked below him. He was the strongest supporter of his Wife’s relationship with their Martha, knowing they had not chosen to marry for love but to protect themselves in this new place.</p>
<p>Sirius had his own feelings of course, thinking they could never be returned, that they were harmless. But then he found that the Commander was gay too (which made sense that he had married Tonks since they shared a strong friendship and could keep each other’s secret) and his feelings suddenly felt heavier, more important.</p>
<p>Yes, that was when it became real.</p>
