<p>Hogging Behaviour</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“…far from perfect,” Harry hears. “He hogs the sheets, and he takes such long showers, the hot water’s gone by the time I get in.”</p>
<p>“If he’s so horrid, dump him,” says Parkinson. </p>
<p>Harry pauses, waiting for Draco’s answer.</p>
<p>“Someone has to be with him. It may as well be me.” </p>
<p>Rolling his eyes, Harry enters the room. “I’m sure the world appreciates your sacrifice,” he says, sitting beside Draco. </p>
<p>“It should.” Draco leans into Harry, who automatically adjusts to support him. “And no one likes eavesdroppers.” </p>
<p>“But gossip’s okay?” </p>
<p>Draco eyes him pityingly. “<i>Obviously</i>. Now, I heard that Blaise—”</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>That night, Draco’s in bed before Harry, who finds him tightly cocooned in sheets. “And <i>I’m</i> the sheet hog?” he grumbles. Climbing in, he attempts to unwrap Draco. </p>
<p>They wrestle, with Draco ending up on top, the sheet a tent around them. </p>
<p>“Well, isn’t this convenient—?” Harry’s words are interrupted by Draco’s mouth devouring his, and as they shag, the sheet eventually hits the floor. </p>
<p>“Cold,” Draco complains afterwards.</p>
<p>Huffing, Harry Summons the sheet, settling it over them. “By the way, why didn’t you tell Parkinson we shower together in the mornings?”</p>
<p>Draco curls closer. “Because some things are private.” </p>
