    <p>Ding!</p><p>The timer felt almost deafening in the quiet shop. A harried look came over the young man at the prep counter, sighing as he wiped his hands on the apron.</p><p>The apple slices would be uneven-- nothing detectable by the average eye, but Mr. Iida would be sure to notice. He swore under his breath, but gave it up as lost as he went to pull the loaves out of the open, enjoying the satisfying click of the trays on the resting racks.</p><p>It was Draco’s favorite time of day, this early morning, where everything was quiet-- well, as quiet as London ever got. When the sun was coming up, and he was alone with his work, he could almost forget how far he was from home.</p><p>Almost.</p><p>He looked mournfully at the half-prepped apples, but went back with renewed determination. He could always just eat the middling slice, he realized, and it was halfway to his mouth before a strong manicured hand snatched it from his grip. He startled.</p><p>“Mr. Iida, I-- oh, it’s just you,” he said, equally relieved and annoyed as his eyes met the brown laughing eyes of his head baker.</p><p>“No eating at the prep counter, you know the rules,” Miriam Iida said sternly, popping the slice into her mouth with a lazy smirk. He pointed dramatically as she chewed. She shrugged.</p><p>“I’m not on the clock, am I?”</p><p>Draco opened his mouth to retort, but she popped a pilfered grape into his mouth instead. He gave up.</p><p>“Bit early today, aren’t we,” He drawled through the juice. “Are you planning to actually accomplish anything, or simply lure unsuspecting young men into your talons?”</p><p>“Lucky me, you do both! Well, lucky for Papa, anyway, because you’re so much better than me it’s almost insulting,” she said brightly.</p><p>She was right. Draco was very, very good at this. Years of practicing delicate cuts, exacting stirs, and potentially fatal reactions made him a perfect fit for the fiddly, gastronomic precision that was Iida’s main business. It was the best patisserie this side of Paris (including some of them besides), and all Draco lived for. Well, most of it anyway, besides his mother.</p><p>His mother. She hadn’t been the happiest when he’d first started working here, but at least it was the best in London, she’d said, sighing. He almost pitied her pride, except it hid in the corners of his heart just as fierce.</p><p>He’d fallen into this line of work completely by accident-- Miriam had been one of his first friends after his release, and the only one to stick. She was a shag gone upside down, when Draco didn’t know himself, stopping halfway because he was ‘somewhere else’ and making herself a cheese toastie Draco could still taste. She’d been his guide when it was all too new and too terrifying, armed with a fierce brightness Draco adored.</p><p>And when she begged for his help last Christmas, he’d jumped at the chance to do <em>something</em>, something respectable, something he’d thought he could at least slightly enjoy, after weeks of coming home with the stench of Peri Peri making him nauseous.</p><p>He never expected the father of brilliant, smiling Miriam would be an exacting, hawk-eyed Master that took him right back to being eleven. He never expected to adore the work-- the elegant symmetry of simple and complex that entwined each creation that entered the storefront.</p><p>It was a good little life, now; left alone, work held to a challenging standard, a hellion poking her nose in just often enough to entertain. It was good to nourish peoples’ bodies, to watch the lines smooth away just a little as they put treats in little hands, or picked up a cake in anticipation. He’d never been smiled at so much in his life.</p><p>After so many years of tight lipped pain, the ability to bring smiles was a precious treasure Draco held close: like the talks with his mother, and the way it felt to chase a snitch, god he missed that, arms outstretched for a satisfying--</p><p>“Oi! Draco! Unbelievable. You haven’t heard a word, have you.” Draco shook an unapologetic head. She worried her lip.</p><p>“Draco, we have a massive order. I mean really big. And important, by the looks of it. Must be very important, because I’ve never heard of them. Something about a prison renovation?”<br/>
She pulled out a sheaf of paper from her handbag.</p><p>Draco raised an eyebrow. Plenty of important people-- movie stars, government officials, professional athletes-- all of them had to eat, and everyone knew that the tiny bright haven of Iida was the best place to source it.</p><p>“They want over a thousand of every seasonal item, but in miniature, if you can bloody believe it, plus miniatures of the savory items from the end of summer, though heaven can only surmise where we’ll get cherries from in fucking April and not have them be absolute rubbish. Plus a cake shaped like some dead bonkers castle, though that’ll be me, obviously.”</p><p>She pulled out the picture for reference, and his blood froze. It must have shown, because Miriam put down her papers, face alarmed.</p><p>“Draco? Draco, love, you well?”</p><p>Well? WELL? How could anyone look at Azkaban and feel well?</p><p>She didn’t know, she doesn’t know, she can’t know. <em>Backwards from ten</em>, Draco, <em>backwards from ten</em>.</p><p>“Just a bit tired, sorry. Renovations, you were saying?” Miriam eyed him with the look of the unconvinced. He managed a smile, hoping it didn’t look as grim as he felt. She turned her head back to the papers.</p><p>“It’s a reopening? Of sorts. Some sort of prison reform. I’m out of my depth, but you’re welcome to take a look,” she handed him a sheet, and it was all he could do not to toss them in the oven. He set it above his workstation, heart beating wildly.</p><p>“When’s it done? Next month?”</p><p>“Er, the 30th. Of this month.” The way she winced told Draco she’d yet to tell her father. He’d lose his mind if he found out.</p><p>“I know, I know,” she said, as if reading his mind, “but we’ve got no special orders this month, and the compensation is enough to run the shop for months and give you a bonus besides. Anyway, someone will come by tomorrow to talk. Has to be early morning though apparently, so would you mind--?”</p><p>His breath stopped.</p><p>“--staying a bit later to finish the samples? I know Papa will want to, but his backs dead fucked, and he can’t be doing such delicate work for that long. I’ll pay you time and a haaaaallllllf.” She sang in his ear, and he rolled his eyes swatting at her and feeling giddy with relief.</p><p>“Of course, you hag. Just leave the list.”</p><p>“Oh excellent, I knew I could count on you!” She beamed at him, and he smiled, feeling a pang in his heart at her open face. Why he’d picked her up in the first place.</p><p>Just then, Mr. Iida walked in, and the anxiety was lost as the shop whirred to life, morning rush of pastry giving way to afternoon tea cakes, and evening bread rush, and by the time he turned the placard over he finally felt he could think without vomiting.</p><p><em>Azkaban</em>, he said to himself as he laid out the croissant dough. Butter. Fold. <em>Azkaban</em>. Turn. Butter. Fold. Screams. Turn. Next. Butter. Fold. <em>Azkaban</em>. Turn. <em>Azkaban</em>. Butter. <em>Azkaban</em>. Fold. Fold--</p><p>“Fuck!” Draco swore. He’d forgotten the butter. He peeled back the long thin mess.</p><p>Still salveagable. He sighed with relief, stomach still roiling, images flashing.</p><p>His father’s ashen face as they wheeled him in, his mother’s worried face still strong and beautiful, head high and cheeks just rosy enough for Draco to know it was flush.</p><p>He smiled into the cherry blossom paste he was blending, carefully piping it into the buttery nests. She was the only one allowed communication (his rules), and he adored her even more than he had at age seven, hands in her skirts and stealing her canapes.</p><p>He really should take some of these home for her. She’d be pleased to see his work, and these were just her taste. Gentle bright cherry and earthy wild mushroom, blood oranges in crisp crusts speckled with veiny, crumbly cheese; even the odd Japanese perilla and salmon tea sandwich. All Mr. Iida’s creations. All heavenly.</p><p>His mother deserved all heavenly items after so many years of personal hell.</p><p>He looked at the clock. Merlin. It was nearly midnight, and he’d have to be back in the wee hours to do the regular work of morning prep besides.</p><p>He stuffed the sheaf of paper in his bag hastily; a single page fell out.</p><p><em>We are pleased</em>, it read, <em>to announce the completion of the renewed Azkaban Rehabilitation Centre!</em></p><p>The green ink glittered in a distinctly magical way-- Draco wondered if Miriam had been able to see it.</p><p><em>We would like to invite you to a celebration of justice, peace, and progress as we begin a revolution in system reform. All are welcome. None are to be turned away</em>.</p><p>Signed--</p><p>He almost dropped the paper. So much history. All down to those three names. He knew he should feel something-- bitterness, gratitude, something-- but he just felt tired. He stuffed it in his bag, walking home barely conscious, eyes closed for what seemed only a brief moment before his alarm blared.</p><p>He arrived back at Iida in much the same condition he left it, bag still in the front where he’d dropped it.</p><p>Miriam, however, was already there, tongue peeking out in concentration as she piped royal icing onto delicate cookies.</p><p>“Petits in the oven, ta love.” She barely looked at him, and when she did, he saw his tiredness reflected.</p><p>“Didn’t take it well then?” He said, the cold water and soap on his skin a welcome jolt, and she scoffed, eyes hard.</p><p>“Not his problem, is it?” She said shortly. Draco opened his mouth, but shut it again quickly, and they passed the several hours till sunrise in companionable but tense silence.</p><p>The bell tinkled.</p><p>“Hello? May we come in?”</p><p>He froze. No mistaking that voice. In pain, in joy, in fear. Unmistakeable.</p><p>“Back here! Just a moment, please!” Miriam shouted.</p><p>“Draco, love, can you show them where to sit, please.”</p><p>He blanched. Not a chance.</p><p>“Miriam, there are a total of four tables, if they’re stupid enough to get lost they don’t deserve to be here,” he said snappishly. She frowned, narrowing her eyes.</p><p>“You’re tetchy. Why so tetchy, my little star? Is one of them fit, is it that? No use being frightened hiding back here, you know, you’re right edible yourself, fit enough, and--”</p><p>“Please!” He didn’t care how desperate he sounded. “Don’t make me go out there.”</p><p>Miriam’s eyes narrowed even further.</p><p>“Don’t think this is over, Mallory,” she said, shoulders squared as she carried out serving platters, kicking the doors open with a bang.</p><p>Draco was frozen the whole time she was out, unable to do anything for fear of being seen. It seemed an age before she strode back in. He jumped.</p><p>“Not the right PUMPKIN, he says. <em>Bland</em>, he says. BLAND! One of our savories. <em>BLAND</em>! I’ve half a mind to tell them all to piss off right this minute!”</p><p>“Why don’t you?” Draco said carelessly.</p><p>“Because they’re paying enough to afford Papa’s Live-In, that’s why!”</p><p>Draco blinked and they stared at each other. She collapsed onto a stool.</p><p>“I meant to tell you soon, but never found the time. Papa needs surgery, but he’ll need someone for a few months. We were thinking of keeping you on only part time and just closing all but bread service and special orders… or… well, closing entirely.”</p><p>Draco blanched. Iida hadn’t closed a single day. Ever. It was a point very well-hammered into Draco’s psyche from the interview on. Keeping tradition was important. Draco understood.</p><p>“With the money from this contract, we can keep the shop open full time with the two of us and give you the pay rise you deserve as head baker. So we’re doing it. Fuck. They just want this stupid, ridiculous, Pasty. Who would want a pasty.”</p><p>Draco knew in a second. Of course he knew. How could he not? He’d had them every year, wrapped in hopes and love and new challenges, fresh with magic, when everything was as simple and heartbreaking as it ever would be.</p><p>“I know what to do. Tell them we’ll take it.” The words came out before he knew it, and she arched an eyebrow.</p><p>“I don’t know what you’re up to, my bizarre pointy angel, but I’ll trust you. You’re sure, yeah?”</p><p>“Trust me, I know exactly what they want,” he said confidently. She nodded, still tense, and went out. Her brows were still furrowed when she came back in, but the anger in her eyes was gone.</p><p>“They’ll be back in two days. And offered enough for the trouble to give you a very nice Halloween bonus besides.” She folded onto the stool, head falling onto floured muslin. A cloud billowed around her dark hair.</p><p>The next two minutes happened both in slow motion and all at once.</p><p>Granger’s voice sounded far away as she pushed the doors open softly.</p><p>“I’m sorry about Ron, I mean, my friend, he means well, it’s just that he’s obnoxiously particular, not that we knew that before, obviously, I--”</p><p>Her eyes met Draco’s, and the words died off. They stared for a moment before Miriam broke the spell, coughing conspicuously as she wiped the circle of flour off her forehead.</p><p>“Well,” Granger said, looking around wildly. “It’s been a while, Malfoy.”</p><p>Draco panicked.</p><p>“I don’t know what you’re talking about. You must have the wrong person. My name is Mallory. Am I correct in assuming you’re the one making the absurd demand to create an entirely new pastry in the next two days?” He said coolly, hoping his eyes wouldn’t betray his desperation. She winced, turning to Miriam.</p><p>“I really am very sorry about that. If I had known that was going-- I would have notified you if I knew they were going to make such an enormous fuss. I hope the additional compensation will be sufficient?”</p><p>“Don’t ask me, it’s Draco who’ll be up late with this nonsense. If he hadn’t have said yes, you and your lot would be begging at an Ottolenghi.”</p><p>Granger raised an eyebrow.</p><p>“Well then. Thank you, Mr. Mallory. I look forward to seeing the final product. This is-- it’s a very important night, you see. We need to show people that the old ways are no longer necessary, that we can mix together all sorts and take care of those of us who make mistakes. We normally wouldn’t be out--” she glanced at Miriam. “--here. But… well… you’re the best,” she said, slightly out of breath from all the atrocious subtext.</p><p>It made him sick.</p><p>“All right cheers, see you in two days, this way then,” Miriam said briskly, cutting in not a moment to soon and practically dragging that earnest monstrosity out of the room. All the air went with her, and he collapsed onto the table.</p><p><em>Backwards from ten</em>, Draco. <em>Backwards from ten</em>.</p><p>Miriam slammed back in, fury in her eyes. She stopped short, eyes darting across his face.</p><p>“You well?” She asked quickly. He pulled himself together to say yes, but somehow only managed a despicably small, “no.”</p><p>She nodded her head.</p><p>“Right then. The financiers need doing, double the sweet basil for the gift sets. Cottage loaves’ second proofing will be done in ten. Off you fuck.”</p><p>That night, for the first time in over a month, he firecalled his mother, her eyed crinkling like Christmas wrapping as she described her garden.</p><p>Even so, her laughter was tinged with sadness, and it gave him the courage to tell her.</p><p>“They’ve asked Iida to cater the Reopening ceremony.” He used all his years of breeding to keep his voice flat as possible. She would already know about it-- A Black is a Black, after all. Her eyes went dark.</p><p>“And I’m to assume you’ve agreed, my dove?”</p><p>“Yes. They didn’t know it was me at first, but-- one came back to talk to Miriam and she saw me.”</p><p>“What did she say?” His mother’s voice sounded even flatter than his, and something in him snapped.</p><p>“It’s more what she didn’t say. It was abhorrent, Mother, so much… so much goodwill and <em>sympathy</em>.” He spat the words out. His mother was quiet for a long time.</p><p>“My dragon, do you not think you are worthy of goodwill and sympathy?” She asked, eyes filled with emotion. He sputtered.</p><p>“Well-- I mean--I don’t need it. Or them. And their quiet condescension. They can take it back the whole lot of them. Malfoy’s don’t take charity, especially the emotional sort.”</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>“You are the only Malfoy left,” she said. “It’s up to you what we do and do not do.” She reached out and touched his face.</p><p>“Your father and I led you so wrong, my dragon, and not a day goes by that I don’t think about how we could have gotten out, made it better. I should have been stronger, even when your father was not, and I will be sorry that I failed you for every moment of my existence. Possibly after, should my stars wish it so.” Tears were rolling down her face, but her voice was clearer than Draco ever thought he’d heard it.</p><p>Draco’s voice died in his throat, choking on the weight and sadness, and they both sat in silence until the fire died out.</p>
