<p>“<em>Hey isn't that the Kyuubi Noko?” A man asked, a blue book with BINGO written in red was in his hands. </em><br/> “<em>You mean the one that beat the Final Dungeon and earned a tenth tail?” A woman asked from next to him.</em><br/> “I heard she beat it all on her own!”<br/> “<em>Impossible! Nobody can beat the Rabbit Queen alone!”</em><br/> “<em>Legend has it, Noko beat the Rabbit Queen without any Summons or buffs!”<br/> “Now you're just spewing Internet Lore! Everyone knows she beat the Rabbit Queen using Illusions!”<br/> “Did you hear about the Hundred PK Slaughter?”</em><br/> “<em>You mean when Noko was attacked by a Hundred Player Killers and lived to tell the tale?” </em></p>
