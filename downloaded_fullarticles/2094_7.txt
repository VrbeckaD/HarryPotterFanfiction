    <p>They were in the Gems section of Eccentricities when she first saw Bellatrix Black, the day of Hermione's arrival in Whenchester. </p>
<p>She was leaning against the display of salt lamps, waiting for Mum and Dad to finish muttering and chuckling under their breaths about how bustling the college-town spiritualism shop was for an utter scam. "The greatest creators of beautiful nonsense are not, in fact, the poets and the preachers, but those who wish to swindle children out of their parents' hard-earned pound," Mr. Granger was fond of commenting while blockading the aisles of any store that had caught his fancy and which he, himself had readily chosen to enter. </p>
<p>As he studied the facets of an over-glitzing geode like a keen spectator of the sport of bedazzling, Hermione noticed a woman idling in the next row. </p>
<p>She was wild-haired, slim as a rapier. Dressed in poker-den chic, a crisp black suit with a black-buttoned jacket and black leather boots more meat-skewer than heel. She ill-matched the place; utterly two-toned aside from the salt-lamp hues staining her monochrome skin in shades of terrible pastel, pink and puce and purple and coral, the lone gambler skulking into a candy shop, the licorice amongst gum-balls. There was an obviousness, however, in her carriage: she liked to snatch up nervous eyes. Her hooded stare dripped the utter satisfaction of a beautiful woman well used to being seen, yet lacked the false nervousness, the self-conscious sidling gaze and double-darting glances so common in those feigning modesty. </p>
<p>That made it harder to hate her. </p>
<p>Hermione had never cared for the sort of woman who walked through life as though everyone else should be her camera, forever shutter-blinking twice and panning along behind her in limp-longing envy, likely because Hermione couldn't imagine anyone's lens ever turned on her, not even her own. And yet she (and the purple-haired boy beside her whose mouth looked poised to receive the polished obsidian sphere in his hand like a whole hard-boiled egg down the gullet) couldn't help but turn and shutter-shut and snap-snap-snap away their blinking silence because even with several drawers of tumbled crystals and the whole leaning tower of tarot between them, the woman was unbelievably stunning and strange. </p>
<p>To quote the Wenchester College Welcoming Brochure she'd been reading on the drive over, "Through this searing experience of God, one sees a world which hints of beauty and radiance not known to the rest of us." </p>
<p>It was, in fact, a quote about the one-eyed statue of Saint Francis in the center of the main lawn, the mascot of Whenchester College, often bedecked in costume jewelry and the undergarments of the underclass, and yet it was those words which danced in perfect recollection at the sight of this stranger in black. </p>
<p>She lowered two sticks of incense back into the diffuser on display and began to walk towards them. </p>
<p>"Granite with azurite inclusions from Everest or blue topaz for manifestation?" asked Dad. </p>
<p>Her stilettos skivered the floor. Hermione made a determined effort to strangle shut the iris, squinting unconvincingly at the flimsy business-card description on the bin full of topaz: </p><ol>
<li>Excellent for manifestation </li>
<li>Helps one align their thoughts and actions with intention</li>
<li>Attracts teachers and mentors into one's life when needed most</li>
</ol>
<p>Though she'd zoomed in on words, Hermione couldn't help but notice the sway of darkness drawing closer, blurry but far more distracting than anything else in the store. As she passed, her stare crossed first Mrs., then Mr. Granger with all the interest of a businessman fording a shallow puddle. When she caught Hermione's eye, she smiled. </p>
<p>There was an unkind elegance about her, spider-spun, like something that could go unseen in both daylight and darkness, save for an uncomfortably romantic sparkling out of the corner of the eye. She was older than Hermione'd guessed; she'd say "fifty?" with disbelief, but would still be unsurprised if it were true. Yet the least believable thing about her was that she was <em>here</em>, in this hipsterized pawn shop for the magically inclined but magic-less; she carried such a strong sense of the certified <em>other;</em> bones all aligned incredibly close the skin like the matting of a photograph behind glass, all splayed out to make it impossible to miss their perfection. Hermione feared, when she opened her mouth, she'd speak rapid-fire Cockney like the shop-girl or the g-heavy Scouse of the Whenchester College prefect who’d given the tour ("Fere's two dorms left ta nab for a new girl; tage yeh pig.") and break this eerie proof of impossible things with mundanity. </p>
<p>Then again, it was equally worrying that she'd speak and out would pour the Queen's-Own, Marry-Poppins-Proper nonsense sort of lullaby-chatter that had gone extinct outside the one socially-acceptable brand of reality telly: recreational romanticization of the royal family. </p>
<p>Hermione couldn't quite convince herself, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, that she was real. It was this place, this sham of a magic shop for first-years rebelling against decades of store-brand Christianity by dipping into the fresher materialism of “Wicca” which was nothing of the sort. This woman could have been a witch. In which case, why on earth would she be in Eccentricities. For all her hair was an utter hedge of dense, black curls, not one seemed to stray in a direction it was not perfectly intended to go; the faint smudge of incense on her first two fingers like an artful embellishment, a kiss of fairy dust. She carried the complete conviction that, wherever she was off to have dinner, she'd be the subject of a rousing, "Cheers!" And when that smile raised her eyes to the last quarter-mast, it turned form spider-spun to spider: dangerously welcoming. </p>
<p>"I'm thinking this hunk of pink salt's more worth the seven pounds than that glob of amethyst stuck to a magnet. You can crumble it up over spaghetti! What do you think? Hermione?" </p>
