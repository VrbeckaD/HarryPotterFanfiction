    <p>Graves’ footsteps echo in the empty house.</p><p>He’s wearing shoes inside, which is strange enough.</p><p>And to be here, in an empty room—it’s so strange it nearly knocks him over.</p><p>Deliberately, Graves runs his hand along the wall, fingertips trailing over paper and paint, committing the sensation to memory. He looks around, at the empty space where a bed used to stand, at the curtain-less windows where he’s watched so many snowstorms, at the still-cracked ceiling that Credence had accidentally hit during a nasty nightmare. This was their bedroom. Theirs—his and Credence’s, a sanctuary within a sanctuary. How many nights have they spent here, tangled up in each other, sharing everything it’s possible to share? Graves didn’t keep a count, but he wishes that he had.</p><p>He leaves the bedroom and pauses, glancing into the bathroom. He had thought there wouldn’t be memories attached to this room. He was wrong. There won’t be any more taking the time to hum favorite old songs and prepare himself for the day, no more terribly narrow sink edge where they both have a bad habit of balancing straight razors—these are  good memories, too. Graves swallows hard, staring at the tiles on the floor, and turns quickly on his heel.</p><p>He’s confronted by the study, then, and here he doesn’t stop in the doorway but walks into the room and stands in the center, turning slowly. There are still the shadows of bookcases on the walls, where they blocked the sun from hitting the paper. How often was Credence in here, awake past the witching hour, leaving Graves to find him asleep on the desk in the morning? This was Credence’s place, really, and Graves is going to miss it. It seems far too empty without Credence in it.</p><p>And then the sitting room—if the study belonged to Credence, then this was Graves’ room. He spent hours here, reading, practicing his magic, improving his understanding of magical theory, or just thinking. Graves has lost count of the number of times Credence came in and found him staring absently into the fire, thinking, an empty cup of coffee forgotten in his hand. Every time, Credence would smile, take the cup, and leave Graves to it.</p><p>Graves comes last into the kitchen and has to stop. This was the center of their life, really, if he’s to think about it properly. Arguments over the correct way to organize dishes. Plants on every available surface, assuming that books hadn’t claimed them first. Evenings at the table, Credence researching his latest project while Graves wrote letters to their friends. That one incident that resulted in a permanently wobbly leg on the table. Credence irritably dragging pail after pail of raspberries into the house from the garden while Graves methodically put together jar after jar of preserves, laughing at Credence’s sunburned shoulders and grass-stained bare feet.</p><p>And here is where Graves finds Credence, standing staring out the window at the now-empty garden. He’d been outside a long time yesterday, even though the plants are gray and dead in the winter cold, and Graves can’t blame him. Credence has poured his heart and soul into the project, and now he’s leaving it for good. The anxiety Credence is clearly feeling about this—anxiety of which Graves feels a real echo—is perfectly understandable.</p><p>Graves crosses the empty room to embrace Credence from behind. Immediately Credence leans back into him, and Graves rests his chin on Credence’s shoulder. “We don’t have to go,” he says, one final time. He’s offered this more than once, and always Credence has turned him down.</p><p>This time is no exception. “We do,” Credence replies. He turns his head a bit, so they’re cheek to cheek, and closes his eyes.</p><p>This was a decision long in the making, one they’ve discussed so much that Graves could recite every argument for and against in his sleep. They could stay safe here for the rest of their lives. But they won’t. Graves, who can’t speak Russian and can’t seem to learn it, is not doing well with only Credence for company. He wouldn’t complain, if Credence chose to stay, but the isolation is beginning to get to him. And it’s time, now that he won’t be shot on sight or arrested, for Credence to enter wizarding society. There are opportunities waiting for him, in London or Paris or Stockholm. Graves is certain of it. A move now is the best possible choice.</p><p>But that doesn’t mean this isn’t hard.</p><p>“I don’t want to go,” Credence confesses in a whisper, after a long moment of silence. “This is—this is home, Percival.”</p><p>“I know,” Graves says. His heart is heavy. This is the first place Credence ever called ‘home,’ and one of very few places where Graves has ever felt safe. Moving away means those things are lost, and Credence is not handling it well. “I know.”</p><p>They stand in the empty kitchen for a while. Credence needs a last chance to mourn this particular loss, and Graves is happy to hold him while he does. Still, Graves hopes that Credence will recover quickly from this change. This, as he’s said over and over, is an adventure. A whole new world for Credence. It’s something that Credence has wanted his whole life, and something that Graves can’t wait for him to have.</p><p>Graves half expects Credence to turn and ask that they stop now. That they stay here, safe and hidden, that Graves send the world away again. As much as it might hurt, if Credence asked, Graves would do anything.  </p><p>Credence doesn’t ask.</p><p>Instead, they lock up the house for the final time. They collect their bags and walk down the mountain for the last time in the drab late-winter sunlight. The morning air is chill, promising snow again soon. Graves has another brief moment of nostalgia: they won’t be here to see the storms this time, or the summer that follows. He dismisses it, though. He turns his face into the wind and reminds himself that what matters is not the place, but the man walking next to him.</p><p>Graves is forty-seven; not so old, considering, but beside twenty-nine-year-old Credence, he feels damn near ancient. Credence stands straight and tall now, confident, his handsome face perpetually alive with thought. His hair, increasingly wavy, has grown all the way to his shoulders and even a bit past. He wears it tied back with a ribbon, typically, though Graves always likes to see it down.</p><p>Lately Graves has noticed a change in his demeanor, his former cheer carrying a harder edge than usual, but he can’t help attributing it to stress. Credence still suffers the worst nightmares, but he’s worked impossibly hard to overcome the obstacles in his path. There are a hundred and one things that must be done for both of them to live normally, with the Obscurus a constant presence for Credence, and still Credence manages to smile. Graves isn’t sure if it’s possible for him to love the man more.</p><p>They don’t hold hands, walking down that mountain, only go shoulder to shoulder. The tiny village is bustling at this hour. People wave to them; Credence waves back. Graves, who somehow still knows barely anyone, doesn’t. It’s Credence who goes to church weekly, who’s acquired more than passable Russian. Despite Credence’s familiarity here, they don’t stop to chat. There just isn’t time. Newt will be here soon with their transportation to England.</p><p>At an empty field just on the other side of the village, mostly flat and quite wide, Credence and Graves stop. This is the prearranged meeting point, and they’re early.</p><p>“Is being overly punctual an Auror thing?” Credence asks, dropping the bags he carries and shaking out his arms.</p><p>“No, I think it’s an age thing,” Graves says. He sets down his load and stretches a bit. “You’ve been getting better over time.”</p><p>“Because of overexposure to you, old man.”</p><p>Graves sighs and shakes his head. “You’re just a whippersnapper with no idea what you’re doing.”</p><p>Credence shoves his hands in his pockets and lounges with pointed insolence on a fence post, looking like an absolute delinquent. “Oh, really?”</p><p>Graves narrows his eyes, unable to stop a smile pulling at his mouth. “Really.”</p><p>“I always know what I’m doing,” Credence says smugly.</p><p>Something catches Graves’ eye before he can reply. He pauses and turns, looking up into the sky, shading his eyes with his hand. Half a second later, Credence bursts out,</p><p>“Is that a <em>flying carriage</em>?”</p><p>It is, in fact, a flying carriage.</p><p>Graves laughs with delight, waving without dignity as the carriage circles the village in a swinging arc. “I had no idea Newt would take one!”</p><p>Credence is utterly agape. “Wizards <em>have</em> those!?”</p><p>“I’d forgotten you hadn’t seen one yet,” Graves says. He stops watching the carriage in favor of watching Credence. It’s always a delight when Credence encounters new magic.</p><p>“It’s big as an aeroplane!” Credence says. His eyes are huge and he’s absolutely beaming.</p><p>The flying carriage swoops around the village one more time and then plunges from the sky with alarming quickness and grace to alight across the field. And then a familiar slim figure, red hair gleaming in the pale sunlight, leaps down from the seat and bounds across the field toward them. “Credence! Percival!” Newt crows.</p><p>Credence drops everything he’s holding to sprint across the field and crash into Newt in a messy hug. Graves just smiles, watching Newt fumble for a moment before returning the hug tenfold. It’s almost as if they didn’t see each other a mere month ago. When Graves gets there, he and Newt share a hug that’s just as strong. Graves will never cease to treasure his friendship with the magizoologist or believe that Newt is one of the best friends he’s ever had.</p><p>And, of course, Pickett came along. Graves greets him happily: the Bowtruckle is mature, with a glorious crown of leaves, and he has a lot to say. “I still don’t understand a word you’re saying,” Graves says, setting Pickett on his shoulder, “but I missed you too.”</p><p>They load up the bags into the carriage. There’s space for Newt and Graves and Credence, all three of them, and Newt promises to sit inside with them instead of up on the box as he did when he flew out here. “I only didn’t because I was worried the Hippogriffs might get a bit lost,” he explains, heaving the bag that contains most of the furniture—miniaturized with Shrinking Charms—through the door.</p><p>Credence peers around the front of the carriage at them. Graves glances over his shoulder. The Hippogriffs are stunning. Proud beasts, with inky black feathers and swirling golden eyes. “They don’t look like they’d get lost easily.”</p><p>“Not easily, but they can be temperamental and quite stubborn,” Newt says. He watches them with a soft fondness. “Might have just turned around and gone back to England, if I wasn’t careful.”</p><p> </p><p>“Like carrier pigeons!”</p><p>Graves nods thoughtfully. “Efficient. Though—Newt, are you <em>really </em>breaking the law to get us back to England with you?”</p><p>“Oh, no one cares,” Newt says.</p><p>His flippancy is already giving Graves a pleasant headache. “Unbelievably illegal activity with dangerous magical creatures is how we got into our first mess, or did you forget? Hippogriffs aren’t to be used publicly for travel.”</p><p>“There are permits, if you’re clever.”</p><p>“If you have a brother who was in the Ministry of Magic, you mean.”</p><p>“Theseus would <em>never</em>—”</p><p>The argument continues all the way until they board the carriage and Newt sets the Hippogriffs on course for England and the Scamander estate. Graves forgot how smooth flying carriages are, and relishes being in the air again. He doesn’t like brooms, but this kind of conveyance is always nice.</p><p>And the conversation is good, too. Newt is full of stories about the younger Theseus Scamander, about how he’s speaking well for his age, and stumbling along after his parents with the best of efforts, and sharing things with everyone. “I do think he’s learning from Dougal,” Newt says. “He wants to share everything. And I think the Occamies think he’s their sibling…”</p><p>“I wouldn’t be surprised,” Graves says. He’s got his arm around Credence’s shoulders and Credence is leaning against him like a pillow. Graves knows his arm will fall asleep in a bit, but he doesn’t really mind. “You treat those creatures like they’re your children.”</p><p>Newt rolls his eyes. “There’s no other way to treat them.”</p><p>Muffled by Graves’ coat, Credence says, “You could treat them as, you know, as regular old creatures.”</p><p>“I couldn’t!”</p><p>“A Fwooper isn’t that different from a chicken, at the end of the day,” Credence says.</p><p>Newt makes an offended noise, but Graves laughs. “He has a point,” he says, and Newt looks disgruntled, but smiles reluctantly when Graves continues: “Still, I wouldn’t use their eggs for omelets.”</p><p>They drift into a comfortable silence, after a while. The rocking of the carriage as the Hippogriffs fly is soothing, Credence’s weight on Graves is warm, and the sound of wind against the carriage is entrancing. Eventually, Newt, tired from the trip out, stretches out over the opposite seat to take a cat nap. Credence and Graves, for their part, sit in comfortable silence together.</p><p>Finally, Credence speaks. “So we’ll be staying at the Scamander estate for a while, right?”</p><p>“That’s our plan.”</p><p>“Given our history with well-laid plans, I can safely assume we’ll be living in the suitcase somewhere in Wales, then.”</p><p>Graves laughs quietly, careful not to wake Newt. “Probably.”</p><p>They settle into silence again. Nothing more needs to be said. Graves thinks fondly about all the times that their plans, in the last six years, have gone awry. There are the famous incidents—an ill-advised trip to a speakeasy comes immediately to mind—and the less famous ones, like the time that Credence said he’d plant just a couple of tomatoes and ended up growing an entire garden full.</p><p>Here’s to hoping that this plan, at least, doesn’t derail too spectacularly.</p>
