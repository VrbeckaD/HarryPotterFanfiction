    <p>Movement Towards the Rising Sun</p><p> </p><p>When Harry first fell for Draco, he was sure this was it, the absolute maximum of how much you could feel for another person. So much longing, desire, needing to be close. But boy, was he wrong.</p><p>With every moment Harry knows he falls more and more in love with this weird, arrogant, extravagant beautiful person. He is completely lost by now, he knows. And he could not care less. With every quirk he discovers this warm thing inside of him, that screams ‘Draco’ from the top of his lungs and seems to cover almost every inch of his insides, just grows and grows.</p><p>~</p><p>The first time they do a road trip together is at the beginning of spring after the first warm days. Astoria has eagerly been waiting for the sun to come out behind the clouds of the London sky and as soon as the temperature has risen above 12 degree, she seems to spend every waking hour in the sun.  Harry particularly enjoys this because it means they often hang out in in his garden now, drinking sparkly things and enjoying life.</p><p> </p><p>From the very first day on Draco of course has claimed the one old, gigantic wooden chair in the garden for himself and spends huge amounts of time there reading. Harry was more than pleasantly surprised to find his boyfriend sitting there completely at peace with himself when he returned from work on a Friday afternoon. Carefully not to disturb the other man, he walks closer only to be greeted by a warm smile twitching around the corners of the pink-haired’s mouth. A clear sign, Draco is up to something.</p><p> </p><p>“Are you free this weekend?”, he asks playfully even though he very well knows Harry always tries to keep his weekends free so they could spend time together and do things.</p><p>Grinning like a maniac Harry leans in closer in order to steal a kiss. He doesn’t go all the way as he still from time to time is insecure whether he is asking for too much. He knows Draco is not a very physical person at all so he makes sure to leave his partner enough space to show what he wants. Most of the time he gets rewarded. Today it is not a kiss but the very intimate touch of a forehead on his, so close their noses are slightly rubbing against each other and for a brief moment he is sure, he ca feel the tiny bump where Hermione successfully broke the bridge of Draco’s nose in third grade.</p><p>He loves how perfectly their faces fit together. Like they were made for cosy whispered conversations, feeling each other’s breath tingle on your own skin and he wonders how he managed to live one day on this earth without being able to whisper things to Draco.</p><p>“What are you planning?”, he whispers out of breath and is surprised by how rough his own voice sounds. He did not intend to imply anything but his treacherous body decided to betray him.</p><p> </p><p> </p>
