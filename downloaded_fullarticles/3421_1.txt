    <p>The age of Grimmauld Place was most likely the only reason that Harry had awoken to the sharp staccato of squeaking floorboards sounding under pressure. His eyes flew open at the sound, but he dared not move until he was certain that the footsteps had yet to reach his room.</p>
<p><em>They’re at the top of the stairs, </em>Harry thought after a moment, grabbing his want and lighting his bedside lamp before moving behind the door to surprise the would be attacker. Briefly Harry thought that it might not be an attacker at all due to the noise they were making, but then the door opened and adrenaline kicked in. </p>
<p>As soon as the person entered the room, Harry rounded the door, raised his wand, and shouted, “Stop!”</p>
<p>“Potter,” the intruder that turned out to be Malfoy, seethed back at him. Harry relaxed and lowered his wand.</p>
<p>“Malfoy?”</p>
<p>“Potter, what is the meaning of this?!” he shouted, holding up a piece of parchment.</p>
<p>“Merlin Malfoy, I should be asking you that since <em>you’re </em>the one breaking into my bedroom in the middle of the night. Here for a booty call?” Harry asked, smirk covering his face and crossing his arms now that he knew he wasn’t in immediate danger. If Harry didn’t know any better, he would have sworn that Malfoy blushed at Harry’s query.</p>
<p>“N….o…..I…. Why did you open an account for mother and I at Gringott’s?” Malfoy stammered, still fluttering the paper about. Harry sighed and walked over to sit on his bed, flickering the remaining unlit lights on.</p>
<p>“That was supposed to be anonymous,” Harry said quietly.</p>
<p>Draco had calmed down some, but still maintained his usual haughtly anger. “Why.” He said curtly.</p>
<p>“I know that your assets are frozen, I also know that you don’t deserve all the punishment the ministry is doling out. Now care to explain how you broke into my house in the middle of the night, Malfoy?”</p>
<p>Draco sneered, although there was no heat to the facial expression. “I apparated, the savior apparently doesn’t have very good security.”</p>
<p>Harry looked confused, “I have wards against…” he paused a moment before it dawned on him. “You’re a Black, the house wards probably can’t keep you out.”</p>
<p>Malfoy thought for a second, “That would make sense, yes.”</p>
<p>An awkward silence fell on the pair. Harry glanced at the clock, 4:45AM. He wouldn’t be getting anymore sleep tonight anyways so he offered Malfoy a cup of tea. Much to Harry’s surprise the Slytherin accepted. </p>
<p>“You’ll willingly accept my tea, but throw a fit in the middle of the night about my money, you’re unbelievable.”</p>
<p>Malfoy glared at him. “We don’t need your charity Potter.”</p>
<p>“I can’t quite picture Draco Malfoy cutting expenses and getting a job in Diagon Alley,” Harry quipped.</p>
<p>Draco growled, “Potter.”</p>
<p>Harry just snorted. “Just take the money and take care of your mother. Now if you’ll excuse me, I have to get to work.”</p>
<p>“At this ungodly hour? I thought you were the beloved savior?”</p>
<p>Harry grimaced into the last of his tea. “Auror training waits for no one. And <em>you </em>are the one who broke into my house at this <em>ungodly</em> hour.”</p>
<p>Malfoy gave him and odd look before saying he would let himself out. Harry shrugged and went back upstairs to dress and brush his teeth before flooing to the ministry. When he came back to the kitchen to put his mug in the sink, he found toast and scrambled eggs waiting along with a note:</p>
<p>            <em>Thanks –DM</em></p>
<p>Harry’s heart did some rather creative acrobatics in his chest when he realized that Malfoy, Draco Malfoy, had made him breakfast.</p>
<p> *****</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“It would probably be cute if it was anyone else doing it for you mate,” Ron said after Harry had explained that Malfoy had been making him breakfast everyday since the latter had found out about the bank account. Harry had left out the part where Malfoy also left encouraging notes along with the food. He was in for enough teasing from Ron as it was.</p>
<p>“It <em>is</em> endearing Harry, Draco is trying to express his gratitude to you,” Hermione emphasized, glaring at Ron.</p>
<p>“Since when are we calling him Draco?!” Ron exclaimed.</p>
<p>Hermione sighed. “Honestly Ronald, the war is over and Draco has clearly changed, we shouldn’t hold his past against him.”</p>
<p>“But why is he making me breakfast likes he’s a bloody house elf??” Harry asked, shaking his hands on either side of his head to express his frustration.</p>
<p>“You not only saved him from serving a sentence in Azkaban, but also gave him money. He is trying to thank you in his own Slytherin way I suppose,” Hermione defended.</p>
<p>“It’s still whack, he’s breaking into Harry’s house daily!” </p>
<p>“Harry hasn’t adjusted the wards to keep him out.”</p>
<p>Ron turned to Harry who had collapsed on the couch in frustration. “Yeah, why haven’t you?”</p>
<p>That was precisely the question he had wished his friends wouldn’t think to ask when he had explained what was going on with Malfoy. <em>Nothing’s going on with Malfoy and that’s the problem, </em>his traitorous brain supplied. Harry internally groaned. Giving Draco and Narcissa access to enough funds so they could live comfortably had been out of the goodness of his heart, but there was part of him that had hoped Draco would find out it was him and... <em>And what? Snog you senseless? </em></p>
<p>“I’m not sure I could if I wanted to. The wards in place should already keep him out, but he is a Black so I think the house sees him as family.” </p>
<p>“<em>If </em>you wanted to, mate?” Ron asked. Harry blushed.</p>
<p>“Ronald,” Hermione scolded.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“If Harry wants to tell us about his personal life that’s his choice?”</p>
<p>“What, it’s not like he wants to snog Malfoy!” Ron turned to look at Harry who said nothing in reply. “Oh my god you want to snog Malfoy!!!”</p>
<p>Harry groaned, covering his increasingly scarlet face. “I don’t know what I want.” </p>
<p>“We will support you no matter what you want, won’t we Ronald?” Hermione asked, glaring harshly at her boyfriend.</p>
<p>“Well yeah, of course but Malfoy? Really mate?”</p>
<p>“Have you looked at his ass Ron? It’s so perfect it hurts.”</p>
<p>“Can’t say that I have, but if you were dating you would have something good to shut his mouth with,” Ron grinned. </p>
<p>Hermione rolled her eyes. “You need to talk to him Harry.”</p>
<p>Harry finally sat up on the couples couch. “I don’t have a choice there, his mother invited me to dinner tonight to thank me for helping them.” </p>
<p>“Excellent. Wear your blue button down, it will bring out your eyes,” Hermione advised. </p>
<p> </p>
