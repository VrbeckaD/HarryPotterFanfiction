    <p>
  <span>She had the cloak of her father, the stone from the snitch she caught in first year, and she was pretty sure that the wand Voldemort was holding was hers.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When the stone fell out of the snitch and touched her palm, Harry felt something shift.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She had heard the tale, about the three brothers and death.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>About the three objects touched by death’s magic.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Surely, with all the phobia he held towards death, Voldemort should’ve known better than meddle with them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Because they were Harry’s know.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Stay close to me,</span>
  </em>
  <span> she had pleaded to her mother.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The two of them looking close to twins, if it wasn’t that Harry’s hair was dark like her father’s.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I love you,</span>
  </em>
  <span> her mother had answered. </span>
  <em>
    <span>You’ve been brave, deerheart.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Her father, Sirius, and Remus had appeared as well. But no way in hell would Sirius ever tell her that it was fine to die.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That was the Stone’s curse. Harry had to bite down the urge to blast it, death used her loved ones to manipulate her into its arms.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I thought she would come,” Harry heard the sibilant voice of Voldemort over Hagrid’s sobs, “I expected her to come.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry looked around, there they were. Voldemort’s lackeys. Bellatrix, trying to talk to her Lord, the Malfoys, Dolohov… Everyone.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I was, it seems ... mistaken,” said Voldemort.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You weren’t.” Harry uncovered herself, tugging on the cloak. She didn’t notice it disappear from sight. The stone was nowhere to be seen either. “You were right. I’m here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry noticed Nagini so close to her, but she knew it was futile to try and maim at the snake. No, she had to be careful. The Death Eaters had started into screams of laughter at her seventeen self.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Harry!” Hagrid wailed, “Harry, no!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Both Harry and Voldemort didn’t pay Hagrid any attention to his wails. Harry barely held herself back from cursing the Death Eater that silenced her friend.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Voldemort raised his left hand, the Elder wand on his grasp.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>That wand is mine</span>
  </em>
  <span>, Harry thought. </span>
  <em>
    <span>How dare you point me with my own wand</span>
  </em>
  <span>. Her green eyes glowed softly with rage. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Harry Potter,” Voldemort’s voice was barely above a whisper, “The Girl Who Lived, come to die.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He mouthed two words, and a jet of green light hit her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Internally, Harry was laughing. Her vision painted itself in white.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry was sure that this had to be a dream. She woke up to arched arcs and train roads. She was in King Cross Station? On the magical side of Platform Nine and Three Quarters?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She sat up from her spot on the floor. Harry looked down, and realized that she was naked. A robe instantly appeared when she wished for something to cover her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She quickly dressed herself, feeling naked even with the robe on.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was a pitiful whine that made her look behind her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There, below a bench, was a baby drenched in blood. But it resembled the homunculus Voldemort had resided in during Fourth year.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry scrambled to her feet and moved backwards, it was a horrifying sight.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A baby, and it didn’t matter that it was Voldemort in baby form, it was still a baby drenched in blood and clearly crying for help.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My dear,” Dumbledore’s voice made her turn around. Her hand ached for her wand, or maybe it was the itch a well placed punch would satiate. “Harry.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Professor Dumbledore,” Harry automatically answered, still eyeing the baby.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Harry,” Dumbledore was wearing his extravagant robes and his beard was nearly blending with the white surrounding them. “You cannot help.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry took a step back from him. She noticed how healthy he looked, his hands were clean.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Harry, you brave woman.” Dumbledore said, eyes twinkling. “Let us walk.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry looked back to the baby, “But,”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Harry,” Dumbledore insisted.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry fell into a quick step easily next to the previous Headmaster. The old man guided them to a bench far away from the baby. Dumbledore sat down, twiddling his thumbs.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I thought you were dead.” Harry said, not bothering to sit next to Dumbledore. “How is that you’re here when this is… limbo, I suppose.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ah,” Dumbledore started smiling, “but my dear girl-”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not your dear girl, Professor.” Harry interrupted him, her green eyes were ablaze. “Are you even Dumbledore’s soul? Or something else? Something, not human.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dumbledore’s face grew grave, his thumbs stopped twiddling. “Harry,”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Harry held up a hand, “I’m done.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She took a step back from him, “I’m done playing by the rules of a dead man.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Harry, but you must,” Dumbledore stood up.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Harry scoffed, “I don’t have to. You’re dead.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The dead sometimes don’t stay dead,” a soft voice said behind her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry turned around quickly, behind her there was a girl.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A small child, wearing white robes over a white dress. Her hair reminded Harry of the rich red blood that flowed through her veins, and her skin of a vampire. But her eyes, her eyes were dark. They didn’t hold a color, they were just dark.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mistress,” the child smiled innocently, she bowed into a low curtsey. “I have been waiting for a long time.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry’s mind raced, “... Death.” she murmured.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The child’s smile grew brighter.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dumbledore’s figure started fading.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Harry,” Dumbledore tried once again, but neither women paid him any attention. “Harry, you must!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You shouldn’t have come here.” the child said, her voice sweet as honey. She laid her dark eyes on Dumbledore. “It is not your place to welcome the newcomers to the in between.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>With a flick of her dainty hand, the supposed soul of Dumbledore vanished.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mistress!” the child regarded Harry once again. “Have you come here to join me?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry regarded the child Death was impersonating.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Your façade isn’t working.” Harry told the child, “Maybe it works for other souls who come here, but it doesn’t work on me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The child stopped smiling. Her body grew, and soon a perfect copy of her mother was right in front of her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So you say, Mistress.” Death spoke through Lily Evans’ lips. “What is it that I may aid you with?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What are my options?” Harry asked, making her way to the bench she had disregarded before and sat down.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You do not have options, Mistress.” Death spoke, “Mistress can do what Mistress </span>
  <em>
    <span>wishes</span>
  </em>
  <span> to do.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry stayed silent, thinking.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Was my life a lie?” Harry finally murmured.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>During this past year on the run, she noticed how her bonds for her girlfriend, Ginny, and her bonds towards Ron and Hermione wore themselves down.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Death inclined their head, but didn’t answer outright.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My… friends.” Harry expanded, “The familiar ties I made in the Wixen World.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Death changed forms once again, a male counterpart of herself sat down next to her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They shared everything, but Death’s hair was unruly like her father’s and shorter. Harry’s hair was like her mother’s, but dyed with her father’s colors.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mistress,” Death allowed Harry to hold their hand, “... not everyone.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry closed her eyes. Somehow, she knew it. Being in the in between meant that she was no longer in her body. So the enchantments or potions dosed in it are not influencing her in the in between.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Who?” Harry asked, turning to face what could have been her body if she was born a boy. “Who was innocent and who is guilty?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You know, Mistress.” Death whispered, they raised a hand and gently removed a stray hair from Harry’s face. “You know who they are.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You call me Mistress.” Harry pulled back gently, she faced Death properly. “Don’t call me Mistress, call me Harry.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Death closed the eyes of the body they were shifted to.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What shall I call you?” Harry asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Whatever you wish, </span>
  <em>
    <span>Harry.</span>
  </em>
  <span>” Death leaned in, “I am yours.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re no one’s.” said Harry, firmly. “You’re a free being. I don’t care that I collected the Hallows. I refuse to own Death.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Death recoiled, “You… don’t want me?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry sighed, catching Death’s hand and holding onto it with a tight grip. “That’s not what I meant.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Death stopped recoiling away from Harry.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You of all entities should know how I feel of someone owning me.” Harry said quietly, “I was my aunt’s and uncle’s freak girl. Later on I was the Wixen World’s saviour, and Dumbledore’s poster girl.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Death relaxed, “I understand, </span>
  <em>
    <span>Harry.</span>
  </em>
  <span>”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry’s lips tilted upwards, “You say my name like a prayer, </span>
  <em>
    <span>Death.</span>
  </em>
  <span>”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Death’s dark eyes gazed into Harry’s, “You’re my Mistress.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry sighed, “So that’s it? I collected them, so you’re mine?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s also within your blood, </span>
  <em>
    <span>Harry.</span>
  </em>
  <span>” Death whispered, “You descend from the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Peverell</span>
  </em>
  <span> line, the wraith descends as well, but you my Mistress,” Death leaned in, “Mistress is the rightful owner of the title.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry nodded, “What now?” she asked. “What do I do now?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Death smiled, “Whatever you wish to do, Mistress.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I could go back,” Harry mused.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Death nodded. “Or go on.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“On?” Harry raised an eyebrow. “You mean, to your realm? Where the souls of the dead rest?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Death nodded, “I have a feeling that you, my Mistress, will find a friend within Hades.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry was stunned.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hades,” she repeated, “as in Greek God Hades?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You did see a cerberus on your first year in Hogwarts.” Death reminded her, amused.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes but,” Harry protested lightly, “I would never had thought…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Death laughed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They sat, in silence. Until Harry heard the whimpers of baby Voldemort.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Death,” Harry started.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“His soul piece,” Death answered, “will stay within limbo to pay for his sins.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry frowned, “Would it be possible to bind his soul whole again?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Death tilted their head, pensitive. “It could happen, </span>
  <em>
    <span>Harry.</span>
  </em>
  <span>”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What about the soul piece within me? Surely that piece would be the diadem one.” Harry questioned, gesturing to the baby from afar and her scar.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Death gazed at her scar. It burned slightly. Until a heavy presence she didn’t realize that she always carried within her disappeared.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>What looked like a fetus appeared below the bench Harry and Death were sitting on.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Gone.” Death answered. “I got rid of it. It was leeching off your magic.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“… Is time travel possible?” Harry asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Death shifted, “Depends.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“On?” she asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What do you mean by time travel.” Death answered, “Do you wish to be within your younger body? Or go beyond the time you were born? If you appear like this while your younger self is still alive, reality might break. And I wouldn’t recommend to go beyond the time you were born.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And resurrection?” Harry asked, hesitant.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Death sighed, “What did the second brother ask for?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh,” said Harry, dumbly. “</span>
  <em>
    <span>oh.</span>
  </em>
  <span>”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry stayed silent, “What is going on right now with the living?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My reapers are working.” Death evaded Harry’s eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Oh.</span>
  </em>
  <span>” Death stayed silent as Harry went through the five stages of grief.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If I go back,” Harry said, “would you still be mine?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Death nodded, “The cloak is yours by blood, not even Dumbledore will be able to claim it. The Stone accepted you as its owner when it touched your palm and you didn’t fall under its curse. And you won the Elder wand by an inconvenient duel.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It was Malfoy’s, wasn’t it?” she muttered, “Until I won his wand by disarming him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Felix Felicis runs within your veins, </span>
  <em>
    <span>Harry.</span>
  </em>
  <span>” Death said, amused. “Must be the Potter luck.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry laughed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So,” she sobered herself, “I can go back to my eleven year old self, and still hold onto the title?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Yes.</span>
  </em>
  <span>”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Will the Trace pick up if I use the Elder wand?” Harry’s </span>
  <em>
    <span>avada kedavra</span>
  </em>
  <span> eyes glittered.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>No.</span>
  </em>
  <span>” Death shifted forms again, the male counterpart of herself was now around twenty or so.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Will I have the horcrux in my scar if I go back?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s your choice, Mistress.” said Death, “You wish, Fate writes.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry smiled.</span>
