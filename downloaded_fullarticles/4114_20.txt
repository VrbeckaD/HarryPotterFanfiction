<p>Moving Up</p>

<p>“So,” said Harry, feeling better, “obviously you’re a legend around here, why don’t you show me the ropes?” </p>
<p>Draco smiled. “Don’t worry, I will.” Tipping back his head, he drained his glass, placing it on a nearby shelf. </p>
<p>Harry followed suit, and as soon as he’d set his glass down, Draco tugged him onto the packed dance floor, where he proceeded to slowly undulate against him. </p>
<p>Despite his best efforts, Harry couldn’t match him, so finally, he just wrapped his arms around Draco’s neck and danced in place. </p>
<p>“You all right?” Draco asked, staring into Harry’s eyes. </p>
<p>Harry smiled. “Brilliant.” </p>
<p>~</p>
<p>The music shifted, changed, becoming throbbing, pulsing, and soon, Harry, caught up in Draco’s eyes and the sensual beat, began moving his hips in time with Draco’s. </p>
<p>“Mmm, yes,” said Draco, licking his lips. “I knew you’d finally catch on."</p>
<p>“We can’t all be dancing legends,” Harry replied. Drawing back, he swept his gaze up and down Draco, “Although I understand why you’re so well known here,” he murmured. “You’re an amazing dancer.” </p>
<p>“Lots of practice,” said Draco. Leaning in, he whispered, “So, are you ready for the back room?” </p>
<p>Harry swallowed. “I am if you are.” </p>
<p>“Lovely. Let’s go.” </p>
