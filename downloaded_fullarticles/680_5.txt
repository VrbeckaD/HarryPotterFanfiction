    <p>Fleur gasped at what she saw before her, before steeling herself, and giving orders.</p><p> </p><p>"Put him on a bed, now".</p><p> </p><p>Pulling out her wand, she cast a quick cleansing charm on the bed, so that it was completely sterilised. She watched as Hermione hovered the bleeding man onto the bed, while she heard Tonks still at the door shouting at nosy students to get back to class, before shutting and sealing the door.</p><p> </p><p>"What happened"? Fleur asked calmly, as she began to wave her wand up and down the person lying on the bed.</p><p> </p><p>"Malfoy", Hermione bit out. "He cornered us in an out of the way corridor. I don't know what else he would have done if Tonks wasn't walking past".</p><p> </p><p>"Stunned the little shit", growled Tonks. "A couple prefects are taking him up to McGonagall".</p><p> </p><p>"Whose bright idea was it to let him back"? Muttered Fleur. "Doesn't matter now though. What did he do"?</p><p> </p><p>"He fired a Bombarda at us, neither of us had the time to pull our wands. Harry just raised his hand, managing to get a wandless shield up in time", she looked down at the black haired man on the bed, running a soft hand across his forehead.</p><p> </p><p>"The shield mustn't have formed quick enough", said Fleur, her wand hovering over the bloodied left hand and arm. "I've seen him do wandless magic before, it would usually have easily stopped a simple Bombarda".</p><p> </p><p>She cast a cleaning charm on the arm and hand, cleansing it of the blood that caked it. The little and ring fingers were completely blown off, and the outside of the arm all the way to the elbow was charred and torn. She fired a sealing charm at the finger stumps and arm, before taking a blood replenishing potion out of the large front pocket of her apron, shooing Hermione out of the way before uncorking it and pouring the contents down Harry's throat.</p><p> </p><p>--------------------</p><p> </p><p>Harry groaned as he rolled onto his left side, hissing as a sudden pain shot up his left hand.</p><p> </p><p>"I wouldn't recommend doing that", came a jovial, slightly accented voice. </p><p> </p><p>Harry snorted in humour as he rolled onto his back, turning his head to the right to see the smirking face of Fleur as she sashayed over to him. Harry still couldn't understand how Bill allowed her to get away. The woman before him was an absolute goddess. When Fleur had first told him that Bill had dumped her, he'd thought the man to be a raving lunatic. He still did now to be honest, watching the silver haired beauty stalk toward him.</p><p> </p><p>"What's happened to Malfoy"?</p><p> </p><p>"Minerva called the DMLE. Madam Bones came personally to collect him. We wont be seeing him for a while as I understand it", Fleur smirked at the last bit.</p><p> </p><p>She came to stand on his left side, pulling her wand out, she fired several diagnostic scans at his arm and hand, before nodding to herself. Tucking her wand back in it's small pouch, she flashed Harry a dazzling smile.</p><p> </p><p>"What am I going to do with you Mr Potter? Just can't keep yourself out of trouble can you"?</p><p> </p><p>"Hey! It's not my fault!"</p><p> </p><p>Fleur laughed and flicked Harry's nose, before walking around the bed and sitting on the edge of it next to Harry. She watched him for a few minutes, the two of them just staring into each other's eyes, before Fleur sighed, shook her head, and looked away. She was about to stand up when something grabbed her hand. Looking down, she saw that it was Harry's, holding her own.</p><p> </p><p>"Thank you", he said, a smile forming on his face.</p><p> </p><p>Fleur gasped as he suddenly pulled her down, his lips smashing against her own. She moaned into his mouth as she pulled herself properly onto the bed, her right leg going up and over Harry, so she was sat straddling him.</p>
