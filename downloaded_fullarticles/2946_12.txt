    <p>
  <span>He’s had the words on his wrist for as long as he can remember. One of his earliest memories is of him asking Theseus – doubtlessly home for holidays from Hogwarts – to read them aloud. “Who are you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They’re actually fairly common, as far as soulmate words are concerned. Newt finds it slightly disappointing that it’s nothing unique enough to tell – well, </span>
  <em>
    <span>anything</span>
  </em>
  <span> about his soulmate’s identity. Not until he meets them and they say those words.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He tells Leta in third year, and she looks over his wrist with keen eyes, making out the thin white words that nearly look like a scar. She grins, then, tracing a finger over his words, “You know, Newt, this could be a man’s handwriting…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He blushes, although he knows this is likely Leta’s way of trying to get a rise out of him (she won’t disrespect creatures, which is the only surefire way, with him, so she tries to be creative sometimes). “It’s – certainly possible.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You really think so?” Leta asks, raising an eyebrow.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Newt shrugs. “It’s soulmate magic. Who’s really to know?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You think it </span>
  <em>
    <span>could</span>
  </em>
  <span> be a man?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Could be,” Newt agrees. “Or a woman.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Leta looks at him like she doesn’t know what to think. Newt knows, of course, that it’s not Leta, because she’d never said his words, and sometimes, like right now, that hurts, a bit. But he’d never tell her that, because his feelings are his and there’s no need to make her feel like she should have to do anything she’s not enthusiastically in favour of. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And if it’s not Leta, then, as far as Newt is concerned, it is perfectly equally likely that his soulmate is a wizard as it is that his soulmate is a witch.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Would you be disappointed?” Leta asks. “If it </span>
  <em>
    <span>were</span>
  </em>
  <span> a man?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Newt considers it. His mother would be, certainly, although Theseus would likely accept it as one of Newt’s many oddities and move on quickly enough. “I think </span>
  <em>
    <span>I’d</span>
  </em>
  <span> only be disappointed if – whoever it is, witch or wizard – doesn’t care about creatures, although, truthfully, I rather think that’s unlikely, myself.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh,” Leta says.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Have you met your soulmate yet?” Newt asks. “You’ve never said.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Leta shakes her head, and though she tries to hide it, she looks pained. Newt’s sorry he asked. “I don’t think I have one.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Everyone’s got one,” Newt says.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not me. I haven’t got – words, or a timer, or a soulmark, or a string, or – anything.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That doesn’t mean you </span>
  <em>
    <span>haven’t got one,”</span>
  </em>
  <span> Newt says. “There are countless ways of finding your soulmate – of knowing that you’ve found them – and not all of them are immediately visually obvious.”</span>
</p>
<hr/><p>
  <span>Of course Leta’s soulmate is Theseus. Of course.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He’s known since he met Leta that she wasn’t his soulmate, but somehow he had never considered that hers might be his older brother. After all, he’d known his whole life that Theseus hadn’t had any visual mark of his soulmate. Just like Leta.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He tells himself he’s happy for them – he tells </span>
  <em>
    <span>them</span>
  </em>
  <span> he’s happy for them – and he ships off the next day for the Eastern Front. He keeps a photograph of Leta, and tells himself that it’s simply because she’s been his best friend for years – his only friend, really.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He says the same to the Russian Dragonologist he meets on the Front. Newt is eighteen and it’s far too easy to fall in love with this handsome wizard with a wife at home in Russia. He, like Leta, is not Newt’s soulmate (his first words to Newt had been a stilted ‘hello’, and Newt knows enough to know that most people who </span>
  <em>
    <span>do</span>
  </em>
  <span> have words have some form of ‘hello’, even if he does not), but unlike Leta, he’s clearly interested in Newt – and Newt accepts the affection behind closed doors.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It’s wrong, he knows – being with someone when they’ve got someone waiting for them at home – but he’s eighteen and the world is at war and Leta and his brother are </span>
  <em>
    <span>soulmates,</span>
  </em>
  <span> and Newt still has yet to meet his own.</span>
</p>
<hr/><p>
  <span>Queenie has a timer. Tina thinks, sometimes, that she might prefer that; timers are exact and the only anxiety one could have over them was the </span>
  <em>
    <span>when.</span>
  </em>
  <span> But Tina has words on her wrist, white like a scar, and they’ve alarmed her ever since she first had Mame read them out to her as a child: “So sorry.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sorry for what? Sorry for bumping into her? For spilling ink on her notes? Or sorry for something much less innocuous? She has no way to know. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She thought about it a lot as a child – what kind of person was her soulmate? Was he (or she; by age fourteen or so she started to accept that her soulmate </span>
  <em>
    <span>could</span>
  </em>
  <span> be another witch) kind and compassionate?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But over the years, she’s stopped paying much mind to the words on her wrist. Her parents were soulmates, after all; that didn’t bring them back to life, and it hadn’t prevented them from getting sick and dying and leaving two small girls alone in the world.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She has bigger things to worry about than her soulmate, like keeping her job, making sure she and Queenie have a place to live and enough food to eat to avoid starvation (and, later, to stay mostly healthy).</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Queenie is getting really unbearable about it, lately, though, mostly due to the fact that her timer now has just a few days left. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m gonna meet him during Chanukah, Teen! How romantic! I wonder if he’s Jewish, too?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’ll marry him even if he isn’t,” Tina says, because she knows her sister.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, I know,” Queenie says, “but I sorta think it’d be perfect if he is.”</span>
</p>
<hr/><p>
  <span>Tina doesn’t expect to meet her soulmate at a Second Salemer’s gathering – she’s certainly not supposed to be there, and if anyone recognizes her, then she can count herself out of work. She’s not really very concerned about Mary Lou’s rhetoric or even how it affects Muggles around them, but she does search out Credence, who looks cowed and terrified but physically well. Something in her aches, but she knows she can’t intervene.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She turns, then, to her hot dog and noshes on it when someone bumps into her. She feels rather than hears the words as he says them in an accent that is </span>
  <em>
    <span>definitely</span>
  </em>
  <span> not from around here: “So sorry.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her wrist is burning, and she nearly drops her hot dog as she gawks after him. He stops, and looks right at her, but she can’t think fast enough to respond. He’s handsome, though, and tall and thin, with wiry reddish hair – and then he’s gone, lost in the crowd.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Well, shit.</span>
</p>
<hr/><p>
  <span>Newt’s first coherent thought, beyond a sense of annoyance, is about how beautiful she is. But then she snaps at him, which isn’t much in itself, except for the fact that she snaps </span>
  <em>
    <span>his words</span>
  </em>
  <span> and his wrist </span>
  <em>
    <span>burns</span>
  </em>
  <span> as the words, he knows, turn black.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Who are you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sorry,” he says, and he’s not sure if he’s apologising for being – well, </span>
  <em>
    <span>himself</span>
  </em>
  <span> – or if he’s asking her to repeat herself.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Who are you?” she repeats. She looks to be around his age – in her late twenties or so – and she looks vaguely panicked, although he’s not sure whether that’s because of the apparent robbery (successful recapturing of his Niffler) or because she’s just met her soulmate, or any combination of the two.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Newt Scamander, and you are?” he tries, because he needs to know her name, and surely she knows that.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What’s that thing in your case?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He remembers that he’s in New York – in </span>
  <em>
    <span>America,</span>
  </em>
  <span> with its backwards laws (and even in London, a Niffler getting out a Muggle bank would likely cause some witches and wizards to be concerned about a statute violation), and wonders if her panic is because of </span>
  <em>
    <span>that.</span>
  </em>
  <span> “That’s my Niffler. Say, you’ve got something on your –” He goes to wipe the sauce off of her upper lip, and she leans back – away from him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He’s really got his work cut out for him, here.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why in the name of Deliverance Dane did you let that thing loose?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I didn’t mean to; he’s incorrigible; he sees anything shiny and he’s all over it,” Newt says, because that’s the truth and the Niffler, while adorable and sometimes useful, can be a proper pain.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You didn’t mean to?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Newt says. “I’m sorry – it’s just that – unless I’m gravely mistaken, we </span>
  <em>
    <span>are</span>
  </em>
  <span> soulmates, and I don’t even know your </span>
  <em>
    <span>name.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>She pulls out a badge and shows it to him. “Tina Goldstein.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He knows the look of a Ministry badge, and this has it; a closer look reveals that his suspicion was right, and he’s looking at a badge for a MACUSA employee. “You’re with MACUSA?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tina Goldstein – what a beautiful name, really – nods. “Please tell me you at least obliviated the No-Maj.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sorry, the what?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No-Maj,” Tina repeats. “Non-Wizard.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh!” Newt says. “You see, where I’m from, we call them Muggles, and I, er – no, I meant to, you see, but he got away.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He got away?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tina sighs. “I should take you in for that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He catches the conditional clause in her statement, and starts. “Should?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tina worries at her lower lip, which Newt finds </span>
  <em>
    <span>adorable,</span>
  </em>
  <span> and looks to him. “I’m not supposed to be around the Second Salemers. I can lose my job.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We could – try to find him,” Newt offers.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My sister would never let me live it down if I arrested my soulmate,” Tina says. “I don’t think we have another option.”</span>
