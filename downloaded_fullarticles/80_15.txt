    <p>Draco's shinning prefect badge, brand new broom Firebolt 3, robes, parchments, quills and books laid on his bed. O.W.Ls was starting this year and he had to do good if he wanted to join the Ministry. He was ecstatic of the fact that this will be the last year he does a class of that oaf Hagrid. And so many new reasons to annoy Potter. Draco didn't believe that he was the one to kill Diggory but oh well, get on with the times. The whole wizarding community was against Potter. The Daily Prophet spend half of their pages cooking up new conspiracy theories about him. The latest scandal was he had conjured a patronus in Little Whinging in front of his muggle cousin and blamed dementors. Honestly dementors in Little Whinging? He was basically writing his own expulsion letter now.</p><p>"Draco come down," his father's voice came from the living room.</p><p>"Honestly Lucius is it necessary for him to get tangled in this mess?" A furious but scared Narcissa whispered to her husband. Draco stopped to listen.</p><p>"If I don't then he will kill all of us. We have to do this. To protect his life," Lucius pleaded with his wife.</p><p>"Ah Lucius right you are. You were always one of my smartest ones weren't you?"</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>Draco's blood ran cold. It was like a hiss, the coldest,most ruthless hiss ever. Who was here?</p><p>"Draco come down," Lucius called again.</p><p>Draco nervously entered the room."You called me fa-"</p><p>Draco's heart stopped. Potter was right. The Ministry, the prophet everyone was in denial. It was him. And Pettigrew by his side if he was not wrong.(He had seen Pettigrew's pictures in the Prophet when Black had broke out. He thought he was dead. Didn't Black kill him?)</p><p>He was hedious, both of them.</p><p>"Draco, Draco, you know what you're father is right?", He asked coming closer to his face.</p><p>"No sir," Draco could barely answer.</p><p>"Lord. You will call me the Dark Lord. Like your father does," He looked at Lucius. </p><p>Lucius flinched. Narcissa looked like she wanted to murder the darkest wizard ever with her bare hands.</p><p>"You're father is one of my followers Draco. He took the dark mark along with many other capable ones when I first rose to power. But alas as I fell due to that aweful boy," he sneered,"so did many of my followers' loyalty. And that unfortunately included your father."</p><p>"Mm-m-my Lord I simply-",Lucius stammered. </p><p>"Silence Lucius. I know what you did. You see Draco don't you think he needs to prove his loyalty to me in some way?"</p><p>Draco nodded his head without looking up.</p><p>"Well Lucius has kindly volunteered you to join my nobel followers," Draco finally looked at his eyes. They were redder than blood.</p><p>He remained silent. </p><p>"Wormtail!" Voldemort ordered the very dissoriented and tiny man.</p><p>"Yes my lord of course," he dragged a man into the room and opened his gags.</p><p>"See Draco becoming a death eater requires some ceremonies or criterias. Since you are one of my longtime followers' son I can skip some of those for you. You will attend Hogwarts this year and keep a close eye on Dumbledore and Potter's schemings against me. You can do that can't you?" He asked again.</p><p>Draco didn't answer.</p><p>"Very well then. You see that man Draco?" He pounted towards the man that Wormtail had brought in earlier. </p><p>"He is a muggle and is anti witchcraft minded. He was telling his fellow muggles to kill a witch or wizard whenever they see them. I want you to kill him and show him what magic is capable of," he finished.</p><p>"Kill him?" Draco asked like an idiot.</p><p>"Yes. Kill him and then you shall recieve your dark mark."</p><p>Draco looked at his mom. She was scared out of this world for him and furious. </p><p>"Please please have mercy! I'll never say another bad thing about magic ever again!" The man pleaded and screamed.  His pleads were silenced with a flick of His wand.</p><p>"Go on Draco. Go on. Show him," He was smiling maliciously. </p><p>Draco was torn. He was many things but a murderer was not one of them. Yes, he didn't like muggles. But he wasn't going to murder an innocent man.</p><p>He stood there, his wand raised for about 30 seconds.</p><p>He lowered it.</p><p>"I can't. I won't kill him," he said tears stinging his eyes. </p><p>"What!" You-know-who was equally suprised and furious. </p><p>"No. You won't touch my son," Narcissa burst out.</p><p>"No my lord of course, of course he will be a death eater!" Lucius intervened.</p><p>"No father. I can't. I can't kill innocent people in cold blood. Irregardless of their blood status," Draco somehow found his voice.</p><p>"Lucius you didn't tell me you had raised a blood traitor," his nostrils flared,"very well then Draco. You're father has to pay back in some way. Maybe with your life," he raised his wand.</p><p>Draco braced himself. Atleast he did one thing right.</p><p>"No!" Narcissa screamed.</p><p>She fell to her knees." My lord spare his life. I will be at your service in his place," Narcissa sounded desperate. </p><p>Draco knew how much Narcissa despised Lucius's scar and His policies.</p><p>"My lord he is too proud for his own good. He is too proud of his wealth, his pureblood status, his bloodline," Narcissa looked at her son like he was a vermin. Draco's heart broke just a little.</p><p>"I say we devoid him of all of this. Throw him in the streets. Snatch away his Malfoy name. Reduce him to the status of a nobody. With humiliation from his fellow classmates like Parkinson and especially from Crabbe and Goyle maybe some sense will get into his head. And he will return."</p><p>"And if doesn't Narcissa?" </p><p>"Then I will kill him myself the next time I see him," the reply came from Lucius. </p><p>"Very well. Narcissa kill that muggle."</p><p>Narcissa killed that muggle without a flinch and a terrible look of agony in her eyes. Draco exited the room. He ran to his own and packed all that he needed for his new school year,some clothes and some galleons he had saved for his personal spendings. He was gonna be better than this. He was gonna prove them wrong. He will not return. He will never return. He will take off on his broom. Go to Hogwarts. Tell Dumbledore everything.  He will help.</p><p>Narcissa burst in and wrapped Draco in a bone crushing hug. </p><p>"I thought I was a disgrace," he said.</p><p>"Oh my boy I'm so proud of you. Here go here. You'll get all the help you need here," she shoved a parchment containing an address. It was in London.</p><p>"Quick Draco hurry go. Be excellent at O.W.Ls! We are both proud of you!" Narcissa said to him as he flew away through his bedroom window on his brand new broomstick. </p><p>"12 Grimmauld Place, London," he muttered to himself ignoring the tears in his eyes.</p><p>.</p>
