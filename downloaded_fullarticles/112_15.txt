    <p>Hermione sat in silence as the train rattled its way towards Hogwarts. She had not seen the castle nor its grounds since the morning after the final battle. Her mind flittered through unwelcome images of bodies broken upon stone and grass. Empty eyes staring up towards the sky, and limbs twisted in the dirt. A girlish giggle snapped her back into the present. Ginny sat across the carriage, her hand resting on Harry's thigh. Again she laughed at something he had said, tucking her hair behind her ear and quickly kissing him on the cheek. It made Hermione uncomfortable, how at ease they seemed. As if they weren't returning to the place that so many were slaughtered. They had been like this all summer, lost in each other. Harry eager to live a normal life, Ginny unwilling to acknowledge her brother’s death. They were all coping in their own way, but none of them were coping, not really. </p>
<p>Hermione's mind slipped back to the summer. The burrow had not been the warm, homely abode it was before the war. While Ginny found her comfort in Harry, the rest of the Weasley's mourned in their own ways. Molly, unable to cope with the loss of her son, was heard day and night wailing from her bed. Arthur, not knowing how to comfort her, withdrew to tinker in his shed. Percy, Charlie and Bill, reluctant to witness their shattered family, retreated into their separate lives. George was broken, not only having lost a brother, but a part of himself. Bitter at the world, he began to drink. The stench of Firewhisky soon proceeded his arrival. One moment he would appear detached from reality in a drunken stupor, in others reality seemed to come crashing down upon him in an instant. Loath to witness his own reflection, less it remind him of his loss, George had shattered every window in the home within two days.</p>
<p>Then there was Ron. After the turmoil of the war and the kiss they had shared, Hermione believed they would finally begin a relationship in earnest. However, the romance she deemed inevitable never arrived. Once the chase had reached its climax, Ron's interest quickly diminished. The renown that came with being one of the Golden Trio and a celebrated war hero, also brought the attention of women. To these adorations Ronald Weasley was particularly inclined. He had spent the summer with many women, often not bothering to remember their name. He forego any notion of a relationship with Hermione, participating in one conquest after another, never stopping to observe the heartache he had caused.</p>
<p>Neither of Hermione's two best friends showed any signs of noticing her pain, in fact not one of them seemed to notice her at all. It took her only five days after the battle to decide she was leaving. Absorbed in their own pain and distractions, no one remembered that Hermione had been required to obliviate her parents. When she told them all she was leaving no one offered to assist, so she departed alone. She spent the summer tracking her parents across Australia. When at last she found them in a small coastal town, they looked right through her, as if a complete stranger. Despite her best attempts the modifications on their memories were far too strong, she could not bring them back to her. She spent the remainder of the summer watching them from afar, attempting to convince herself she had done the right thing. </p>
<p>"Hermione." A voice called to her, pulling her from her thoughts. The train had stopped moving and Harry was perched across from her leaning forward. </p>
<p>"Where’d you go there? I called your name three times." A look of curiosity and perhaps a flicker of concern crossed his face. Before she could respond however Ginny spoke from the doorway of the cabin. "We better get going, almost everyone has left the train now."</p>
<p>After being so consumed by her memories for such a length of time, it took Hermione a moment to ground herself back in the present. She shook her head and looked up through the glass. It was now dark and she could make out the lights of the castles many windows in the distance. This was it, her final year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry had begun. A year in which she could focus on her studies and achieving good grades in her NEWTs. No evil mad man to fight, no running for her life. This year should be simple, it should be easy. But she couldn't shake the feeling that in its own way, this would be her hardest year yet.</p>
<p>"Hermione, come on, we need to go." Harry was now speaking to her from the doorway, his arm wrapped around Ginny's small waist. They turned to leave, Hermione quickly grabbed her things and moved swiftly to follow them both off the train. </p>
<p>From the silence of the train, she stepped out onto the chaos of the platform. Everywhere students were rushing to gather their luggage and find their friends. Suddenly, her breath caught in her throat. A tight pain spread across her chest, as her breathing became shallow and rapid. She tried in vain to regain control as her vision began to twist at the edges. Abruptly the pressure in her chest seemed to bubble over. Hermione felt as if a flood gate had been cracked wide open. She could feel her magic radiating from her centre, crackling almost painfully across her skin.</p>
<p>Overwhelmed by the sudden sensation she stumbled backwards from the crowd, her elbow connecting with something solid. The magic scorching her skin rushed to the point of contact, erupting with an audible bang. With the release of the magical tension, Hermione exhaled deeply, her vision coming back into focus. </p>
<p>"What in Salazar's name was that Granger?" Hermione's head snapped around to see Draco Malfoy a short distance away, picking himself up from the ground. She gazed down at him, struggling to grasp at the edges of her mind, trying to make sense of what had just taken place. </p>
<p>Gaining no immediate response, Malfoy picked himself up off the ground, brushing his hands on his trousers. Stepping forward he continued, his tone almost questioning, “Granger, you just stupefied me."</p>
<p>Still attempting to calm her breathing, she looked up slowly, meeting his steel blue eyes. He was now standing close to her, closer than Hermione could ever recall. Caught off-guard by his height, she found herself equally surprised to find no hint of intimidation in his posture.</p>
<p>"I... I'm s-sorry Malfoy." She managed to stutter, struggling to find her voice.</p>
<p>So softly, almost a whisper he replied, "Don’t worry about it." Turning away from her he slid his hands into his pockets and stalked off towards the carriages.</p>
<p>Left confused by the lack of confrontation in their interaction, Hermione watched him as he strode towards the swarm of students. Composing herself, she followed in his direction, towards the once seemingly horseless carriages. Unable to see Harry and Ginny in the crowd she climbed into the next available seat. The two Hufflepuff third years across from her abruptly ceased their conversation, staring with their mouths agape at Hermione. Uninclined to cater to their awe she turned her attention towards the Thestrals, examining their dark skeletal features. The two girls returned adamantly to their conversation in whispered tones, their eyes darting to and from Hermione. With a sigh she recalled the way women had began to look at Harry and Ron after the war had finished, with admiration and desire. While Harry remained almost oblivious to their advances, Ron's ego swelled. Unlike Harry and herself, Ron had declined the invitation to return to Hogwarts to finish his studies. He instead decided his time would be better spent traversing the world, making full use of the money they had been awarded, as well as the multitude of women drawn towards his newfound wealth and fame.</p>
<p>Just as her thoughts began to spiral towards her ever growing distaste of Ron's actions, the carriage came to a halt. She stood and stepped down from the carriage, leaving her luggage behind with the knowledge that the house elves would have it transported to her dorm before the feasts end. This close to the ancient castle she could see the major damage it had sustained during the battle had been repaired, although it had not yet been returned to its former glory. As she stepped through the giant front doors of the castle she felt the magic of the new wards wash over her. Students were filing through the entry and into the Great Hall, walking towards their respective house tables. Suddenly halting mid stride, Hermione was overcome with images of the past. Instead of the four long tables, she could vividly see row upon row of sheet covered bodies upon the Halls floor. Only vaguely aware of the students passing around her, she felt the panic begin to set in and her magic crackle to the surface. All too aware of her slipping control, she drew in a deep and trembling breath. Slowly Hermione willed herself to focus on the present and her vision began to clarify. Still shaken, Hermione took a small, tentative step forward and entered the Great Hall with her peers.</p>
<p>As she walked towards the Gryffindor table Hermione's eyes wandered, searching for her friends. A short distance away from where she stood, she spotted Harry and Ginny seated so close together that they were almost atop one another. Across from them sat Neville with his back to her. The spot next to him was thankfully vacant so swiftly she took the seat. Neville flinched and his head snapped up, eyes locking with hers, she noticed his hand dart to his robe pocket and surmised he had grasped at his wand.</p>
<p>"Merlin Hermione, you gave me a fright." Neville declared, as he removed his hand from his robes and rubbed at his temple. "I just don't do so well with people sneaking up on me, not since the war." </p>
<p>"Oh I'm sorry Neville, I didn't even think that I might startle you." Hermione apologised. </p>
<p>Neville sighed, "No, it’s ok. I know I'm just being paranoid, but I can't help feeling as if there is still something lurking around every corner. I just can't seem to let my guard down anymore."</p>
<p>She knew the feeling all too well herself, always on edge, ready for the next attack. She looked up into his eyes to respond, "We all have our problems after what we have been through, I guess it might take some time to return to normal."</p>
<p>Again he sighed and spoke to no one in particular, "I wonder if things ever really will get back to normal."</p>
<p>Before Hermione could respond, McGonagall cleared her throat from the podium at the front of the Hall. The chatter in the Hall fell to silence as the Headmistress began her address.</p>
<p>"Welcome back to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, in a moment our newest students will walk through those doors and join us to be sorted into their houses. I ask that each and every one of you extend a welcoming and helpful hand to our new editions over the coming year. Now please welcome our new first year students."</p>
<p>As the last word crossed McGonagall’s lips, the large doors at the opposite end of the room opened and a group of small, terrified looking students entered the Great Hall. Their eyes were wide and darted around the expanse of the room as they made their way down the centre aisle. </p>
<p>"Why are there only that many of them?" Ginny queried. Hermione turned toward the girl and noted the look of confusion upon her face. There really were so few of them, barely more than twenty. Her tone sombre, she answered Ginny's question, "Most of the new students are Muggleborns. A lot of wizarding families decided to send their children to Durmstrang, Beauxbaton's and even Ilvermorny in North America. They were too terrified to send them to Hogwarts." Looking around the room and the spattering of empty seats she added, "It looks as if a lot of the older students must have been transferred as well."</p>
<p>Before the others could reply, McGonagall cleared her throat once more. The whispers around the Hall diminished and all eyes were drawn to the tattered hat, which sat upon a stool before the group of young witches and wizards. The seam along the hats brim split open as the old hat became animate and began to sing.</p>

<p></p><center>
  <p>"Ancient stone and towers tall,<br/>
To this castle there is more.<br/>
Highest keep and dungeon deep,<br/>
All this held by pillars four.</p>
  <p>Through segregation of us all,<br/>
In the past have formed cracks.<br/>
If these halls are to be saved,<br/>
Together now forge new pacts.</p>
  <p>Though we suffer wounds cut deep,<br/>
We all desire our home not fall.<br/>
It is dire now to become as one.<br/>
Mend the damage heed my call."</p>
</center><p>As the sorting hat finished its song a heavy silence stretched across the Hall. McGonagall stepped forward unfurling a scroll. Her tone authoritative yet kind, she called forward the first student, "Argent, Rachelle."  </p>
<p>The tiny first year girl stepped forward and took her seat on the stool. As the sorting hat was placed on her head, slipping down over her eyes, the hat called out in a booming voice, "Ravenclaw!" </p>
<p>The child jumped down from the stool and almost skipped towards the Ravenclaw table while applause rang around the Hall. </p>
<p>McGonagall called the next name on her list, "Burke, Alistair."</p>
<p>Stepping forward with his head held high and shoulders set squarely, the dark haired boy took his seat. The moment the sorting hat reached his head, it let out a shout, "Slytherin!"</p>
<p>Applause erupted from the Slytherin table, but around the rest of the Hall only a few sparse claps were heard. Aware that she was the only one in her vicinity applauding with vigour, she looked to her friends. Harry and Neville clapped absently, while Ginny sat stoically with her arms crossed against her chest.</p>
<p>"What is wrong with you all?" Hermione questioned in an aggressive whisper.</p>
<p>A look of disgust crossed Ginny's face. "What? He’s just one more slimy snake added to their nest. Do you know who he is 'Mione? He’s a Burke, one of the sacred twenty eight. I bet he is a dirty purist just like Malfoy." </p>
<p>"Really Ginny? Do you not realise you and Neville are both considered part of the sacred twenty eight? Don't judge the boy before he has had the chance to show his colours." Hermione rubbed at her temple, frustrated at her friends’ dismissal of the young boy.</p>
<p>Ginny scoffed, "Yeah 'Mione, I'm sure he’s just a ray of sunshine like the lot of ‘em."</p>
<p>Feeling the anger begin to swell inside her at her friend’s discrimination, she drew in a deep breath before responding. "Did you not listen to the sorting hats song? It was a warning, if we don't strive for house unity Hogwarts may not survive." </p>
<p>Rolling her eyes, Ginny opened her mouth to argue her point. As she did so food materialised between the two of them. She sighed and continued, "Look Hermione, you're not going to change my mind on this, they’re all snakes. I'm hungry, let’s just eat."</p>
<p>After dismissing Hermione, Ginny loaded her plate and turned back to flirt playfully with Harry. He spared Hermione a short glace and small smile, then returned to flirt with his girlfriend in earnest. </p>
<p>Hermione spent the remainder of the meal in relative solitude. Harry and Ginny enamoured in each other’s attentions, and Neville recounting his tale of beheading Nagini to some enthralled Sixth years. </p>
<p>Once the last of the plates cleared, McGonagall returned to the podium. Her eyes swept across the Hall as she began her address, "Welcome to our staff and students, both new and old. This past year has been trialling for our society. We have suffered tragedy and great losses. I can only hope that these trials act as a crucible for us all, that we learn from our past mistakes, and become stronger as a whole. I ask that you all make an effort to mend old divides and pursue a newly forged unity as we move forward. If the Prefects could now please stand and direct our new First years to your respective house dormitories." </p>
<p>There was a moment of whispered chatter as the Prefects each left the Hall with their small cohort of new students. Once they had departed McGonagall continued, "This year brings the return of some students that should have rightfully concluded their education in the year past. If these returning Eighth year students could please remain behind. Everyone else please return to your dormitories post-haste, you are dismissed."</p>
<p>The majority of the student body stood and left the Hall, Ginny swooped down to kiss Harry before joining the crowd. As the mass of laughter and chatter receded into the distance, Hermione glanced around at the others in the Hall. So few of them had returned.</p>
