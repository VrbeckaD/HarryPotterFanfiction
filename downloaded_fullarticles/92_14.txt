          <div class="userstuff"><p>Our story starts in the Three Broomsticks, owner and bartender Madam Rosmerta has hired some new employees to help her run the place. Her girlfriend Rolanda Hooch is visiting.</p><p>Rolanda smiled. "Things seem to be running smoothly since you hired more people."</p><p>Rosmerta sighed. "It feels weird not rushing around all the time though."</p><p>Rolanda said, "Think of it this way, we now have more time together."</p><p>Rosmerta smirked. "I never said I was ready to leave the pub altogether, dear."</p><p>Rolanda replied, "That's too bad really, I just purchased two tickets to see the Hobgoblins. I guess I'll just have to find someone else to go with then."</p><p>Rosmerta stated, "No, don't do that. I'm sure I can manage to leave this place for a short while."</p><p>Rolanda asked, "I thought you just said you weren't ready to leave the pub altogether though, Rosie?"</p><p>Rosmerta grinned. "I did, but you changed my mind. Besides what's the worst that could happen if I leave for a couple of hours?"</p><p>Rolanda responded, "True, I highly doubt any harm will come to the place." She added, "But,who said it was just going to be for a couple of hours?"</p><p>Rosmerta muttered, "I thought you said..."</p><p>Rolanda beamed, "The concert is in Cardiff, so I thought we could stay the whole weekend."</p><p>Rosmerta answered, "That sounds lovely."</p></div>
