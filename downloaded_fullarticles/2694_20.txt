  <strong>Chapter 1-How Dumbledore's plan failed from the beginning</strong>
</p><hr/><p align="center"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">Petunia Dursley, née Evans, was perfectly normal, living in a perfectly normal house, in a normal neighborhood with her perfectly normal husband and their perfectly normal son. Thank you very much! Petunia Dursley, née Evans, was the vice-president of her neighborhood's book club, the thrice time winner of the best garden of Little Whingning and was the street gossip queen. Her husband, Vernon Dursley, was the important Vice-president of the sale department at Grunning Drill Company and was a man who always remember to put down the toilet seat after he was done. Her son, Dudley Dursley, one year and a few months old, was a little angel who was a bit fussy about certain things, but always deserved the very best and always made her proud.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">There was a few hiccups in her perfect world. Marge Dursley, Vernon's spinter sister, and her horrid lap-dog, Ripper, who came at her home to visit and always left half-drunk. She would always be loud and quite crude. However, the woman only came one week every few years. Then, there was her freakish sister Lily that was a freak with her freak of a husband and kid. Petunia liked to pretend that her freak of a sister and her world didn't exist. The good thing was that Lily and her never spoke, see or even mention one another under any circumstances. Her last hiccup came in the form of Rose Evans, her youngest and mysterious sister.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Rose Evans was quite peculiar. At the tender age of 7 years old, Rose entered the Royal Military Academy. There she learned how to be a soldier for ten years; then, she enrolled in the Royal Navy of her Majesty for 2 years before being discharged for being wounded during battle. Since then, Rose has been working as a private consultant for a protection company. It was all hush hush and Rose made lots of money. She rolled in a Ferrari, wore top designer suits and lived in a luxurious and expensive three bedroom apartment in downtown London. Rose and Petunia barely spoke to each other; neither were quite impressed by the others life style.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Petunia believed that Rose should found herself a husband a quit this silly business of a job; the bitter older sister thought that women should be satisfied with a house, a husband and kids. She honestly could not understand her sister's ambitions to be more than housewives and mothers. Rose could not understand why, with all the brain that Petunia had, she would settle with less than what she could be.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Edward and Iris Evans sent all their daughters to private and specialised schools; Petunia went to a private school for young women that taught an amazing science programs, Lily went to Hogwarts to learn magic and Rose to her military school. Each girls went to the best school their parents could afford. To Rose, when Petunia decided to drop her chances at Oxford to marry that walrus of a man, she had disgraced and disrespected her parents sacrifices to give them the best futures possible. They have not spoken in six months after their last fight.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Yet, all this animosity between the two of the sisters was thrown out of the window on the morning of the <sup>2nd</sup> of November of 1981, when Petunia opened the door of her house to find her fifteen months old nephew on her porch like a bottle of milk. She honestly couldn't understand who would leave a child like this in the middle of the night without so much as thicker blanket or even ringing the door bell to explain what was going on. Who in the world announced that one sister, along with her husband, was now dead at the hand of a terrorist and that their nephew was the only protection they had against the madman and it's follower?</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Petunia's heart shattered at the news that her sister's death and at the thought that her nephew now being an orphan. However, all the hearbreak, all the sadness she felt and all the love she could possibly have felt for her nephew and estrange sister all vanished when she realised that her nephew was a freak just like his parents!</p><p align="JUSTIFY">No! No! She would not allow her sister's child hurt or taint her own son by accident or otherwise. Besides, Vernon would never accept the boy in his house without using physical, verbal and emotional abuse to vent his frustrations. Even if they were safe from the terrorists, it would only protect her family if the boy survived the beatings from Vernon.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">No, the boy could not stay here! He would not be safe... <em>Neither will we if the boy does not stay!</em> <em>Is this not what the letter said?</em> Said a little voice in her head. What could she do? What should she do? She didn't known!</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Petunia nearly jumped out of her skin as she heard her husband coming out of the bathroom; in a panick, the woman looked around frantically to spot a hiding place for the child before her husband saw him. Her eyes fell on the cupboard under the stairs and her mind was made up. She barely had time to close the door before Vernon made it down the stairs. Hushering him to the kitchen, she prayed that the baby would stay silent until her man left for work. It didn't take long before Vernon left in his shiny new car.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Making her way to Dudley's room to check on him and feed him, Petunia decided to call her last and only sister alive for help. If anyone could help her, it was Rose. She would know what to do with the baby and what could be done to protect her family. As usual, Dudley made a little fuss about his bottle; he wanted soda instead of his milk. Thankfully, both Vernon and herself were very strict about Dudley's health; no candies or soda before noon.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Once Petunia fed and changed her own son, she made her way to her contact book and look through to find her sister's number. It took her less than four tries before her sister finally picked up the phone.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">``Yeah... wha... Who's this?'' asked a sleepy and tired voice on the other side of the line.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">''Rose? It's me. Petunia. We... we need... we need to speak face to face! It's Lily! She... Her... Lily's dead, Rose... She was killed by some madman from her freak world and... and... her son is here and... I don't know what to do. There's this letter and it's... Please! Please, come and help me! I'm scared! Please Rose!'' cried Petunia as she finally allowed herself to feel her emotions.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">''... I'll be there in less than an hour. Don't leave the house. Do not answer the door or the phone. Close all the drapes and keep your family in the same room with an exit. Always keep a knife or something to fight back. I'll use our old code when I'll arrive.'' ordered the youngest Evan sister before hanging up.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Petunia didn't waste any time to make sure her sister's advices were followed and she waited in the kitchen; it took less than 40 minutes before she heard the tale tell sound of the Evan sister's old code. Carefully, Petunia opened the front door and led eyes upon her youngest sister. Rose walked right in without a word and made her way to the kitchen. There she saw her two nephews; one in a highchair with chocolate milk, the other on the floor chewing on his blanket.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">''What happened?'' asked Rose with a monotone voice.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">The answer to her question came in the form of a letter. Taking it from Petunia's trembling hand, Rose began to read and pray that whatever deity in the universe that the Chief Wizard of the Wizengamot and Headmaster of Hogwarts never crossed her path.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">
  <em>Dear Petunia,</em>
</p><p align="JUSTIFY">
  <em> It is my greatest regret that I must inform you that your sister and her husband were killed last night in Godric Hollow by the Dark Lord Voldemort. Her son managed to defeat the Dark Lord known as Lord Voldemort and lived to tell the tale. However, despite the Dark Lord  being dead, his followers, I am afraid, are not. It is therefore imperative that young Harry lives with you and your family to secure the Blood wards that will not only protect you, but your family as well. </em>
</p><p align="JUSTIFY">
  <em> I ask of you, my girl, that you do not tell the boy of his fame in the wizarding world, of his parents or of the wizarding world. In fact, it would be of the upmost importance that you do not treat Harry with any kind of love or affection. The more meek and submissive you can make the boy, the greater the reward; 5000 pounds per months to be exact. Simply remember that Lily was able to go to a magical school just like you wanted, land a rich husband that could get her anything and became extremely popular both in school and at home if you ever start to waver in your conviction. Remember that your parents always praised Lily more than they ever praised you or even cared for you.</em>
</p><p align="JUSTIFY">
  <em> With all my regards,</em>
</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">
  <em>Albus Percival Wolfric Brian Dumbledoor,</em>
</p><p align="JUSTIFY">
  <em>Headmaster of Hogwarts,</em>
</p><p align="JUSTIFY">
  <em>Chief Wizard of the Wizengamot.</em>
</p><p align="JUSTIFY">It took every once of strengh and training in Rose not to break down in tears. She couldn't fantom how someone could be so cold and heartless as to announce that their sister had lost her life in such a manner. And that was nothing compared to what the man was asking Petunia to do to little Harry! The man, basically, told her to neglect and treat Harry like less than family and delibrately left the boy in the hands of a woman he had to know hated magic. Why else would he remind her of all the magical things that Petunia wanted but Lily had in such a way?</p><p align="JUSTIFY">''I can't keep him. He... He won't survive Vernon! You known how he hates magic since... You know. I... I'll never love him. I'll never treat him like family or treat him well. You know me. Please... What should we do?'' asked Petunia, on the verge of a mental break down.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">''You will tell Vernon to accept that promotion in America. You will tell him that it will be good for his reputation and for your son if you all moved to America. You will write a letter saying that you grant ME sole custody of our nephew Harry James Potter and have one of your neighbors sign as a witness. You will move as soon as possible and you will never come back. Do not tell anyone where exactly you are going and do not give them a forwarding address. You will dissapear and never come back to England. Am I clear?'' demanded the youngest woman as she looked straight in her sister's eyes.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">''Yes.''</p><p align="JUSTIFY">''I will take custody of Harry and leave the country as soon as I can reach a certain friend of mine. I will be taking Harry with me as I leave. Now write the letter and fetch one of your friends. I need to make a few phones calls.'' said Rose as she pulled out two pieces of papers and making her way to the toddler on the floor.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">It didn't take long before the toddler with a raven's nest for hair raised his head and looked up at his aunt and a bright smile came across his face. He raised his little pudgy arms and made a grabby hands motion to have his aunt raise him up. Without waiting, Rose took Harry in her arms and gave him the bigest hug she could give him without being crushed. She placed a small kiss on her nephew's forehead to offer a bit of comfort to her now orphan nephew.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately, her other nephew didn't appreciate not being the center of attention and began to wail and throw a temper tantrum. Rose steadily ignored the boy and proceed to take some baby food to feed Harry. It only made Dudley angrier; to make sure that everyone knew it by throwing his toy at his aunt's head. It never Rose as she caught the toy mere inches from her head and kept the toy in her hand. This did not made Dudley any happier; it made things worse.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Both Rose and Harry ignored him at the best of their abilities. Why should they pay attention to that brat?</p><p align="JUSTIFY">''Rose! Why aren't you letting Dudley cry like this? Just leave the... the... boy... and help Dudley! He's not your son. Why should you pay him any time?'' asked Petunia as she rushed to her son.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">''Neither is Dudley! I am taking care of Harry, because no one fed him, changed him or comfort him after he JUST lost his parents! I didn't pay attention to Dudley because he was throwing a temper tantrum just because he wants to be the center of attention.'' snapped back Rose, insulted that her sister would dare scowl her for for not indulging her stupid kid. ''I said that I would going to take care of Harry and that is what I am going to do. Since, you are clearly too incompetent to take care or notice of anyone else than your own child. I will take care and notice this child and no other.''</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Thin lipped and tight jaw, Petunia took her son in her arms and handed the passation of custody to her sister with the letter given to her. She knew that Rose made a point and that she was in the wrong. Of course, she wasn't going to tell her this. She just couldn't say that HER precious Dudders could be in the wrong. It would be like she was giving preferential treatement to Lily's son over her own. Petunia had been overshadowed by her sisters accomplishments all her life, she wouldn't let her son suffer through that. No. It was the... the... boy that was in the wrong. Taking Rose's attention and food away from him.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">''I will take Harry now and you will leave as soon as possible. This is the last time we will see each other. Something we can both agree that it is in our best interests. Let's face it. We never even liked each other. Even as children. Lily was the only one who could make us civil towards one another. Goodbye. And good luck!''</p><p align="JUSTIFY">With this Rose left 4 Privet Drive in Little Whining in Surrey to never return.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">
  <em>Five days later...</em>
</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Miss Figgs entered her new home. She was so happy and excited at the idea of helping the great Dumbledoor and doing such a noble task. She was to keep an eye on Harry and his relative and make sure to report anything suspicious and dangerous around the family. She was happy to know that the family that used to live here was being relocated to a nice place elsewhere; it meant she had a better view on 4 Privet Drive.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Her door bell rang to announce a visitor. Expecting to see Petunia at her door to welcome her into the neighborhood, however, it wasn't. Instead, it was Miss number 5 Privet Drive. She brought a casserole and offered her the last new gossip on the street. According to her, Petunia and her family left for America after her husband received a promotion and the family left in less than three days later. It was all strange and rather suspicious as everyone knew that Vernon was an asbismal employee at his job and there was no way that he could have a promotion. So it was everyone's guess as to why the Dursleys left so fast. Obviously something scandalous.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">Mrs Figgs was rightfully shocked. Petunia Dursley left for America with Harry Potter! She had to tell Dumbledoor and make sure that they could find the boy before the Death Eaters did. They had to make sure that the muggles would never again leave their home like this. How was the Order supposed to protect and train Harry to his destiny if the Dursley family kept moving from one place to another? This was awful! Just awful!</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Rudely and abruptely, Mrs Figgs closed the door of Mrs number 5 Privet Drive and ran as fast as her old legs could to her fireplace to contact Dumbledoor. Unfortunately for her, Mrs Figgs did not see Mr Whiskers, one of her many kneazles, and tripped over him and cracked her head on the edge of her fireplace. Hearing the commotion, Mrs number 5 and Mrs number 7 Privet Drive entered the old lady's house to find her unconcious and bleeding. The ambulance arrive exactly fifteen minutes later to pick up Mrs Figgs. Unfortunately for the old woman, Mrs number 7 watched a lot of medical drama series on television and believed herself to be a professional doctor and decided that Mrs Figgs's head had to be moved as her awkward angle could hurt her in the long run. This had the undesire effect to snapped the old woman's neck; killing her instantely. The first responders could only confirm her death.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">And so, Mrs Figgs never reported to Albus Dumbledoor about the Dursley's departure for America or about the treatement of little Harry. Albus never knew that the Dursley family arrived in New Jersey for Vernon's work; he never knew that Harry was never raised by Petunia and Vernon; he never found out that Rose established herself with Harry in France (one of the few country in the International Confederation of Wizards where Albus Dumbledoor had no influence or was regarded with any respect what-so-ever) and never leaned that the Dursley family died at the hands of a serial killer three years later. Not even Lord Voldemort had caused such a disruption into the old manipulator's plans as much as the Evans sisters. He never knew and when he would learn of his failed plans, it would be far to late to do anything.</p><p> </p>
