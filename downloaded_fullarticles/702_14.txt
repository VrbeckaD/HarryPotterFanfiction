    <p>Tom furrowed his brows in irritated surprise as he was tugged into an empty classroom. Wrenching his arm free, he whipped around to glare at the unfamiliar witch who had dragged him, without any sense of propriety, into the dark room. </p><p>“What is the meaning of this?” He sneered in derision. “That’ll be fifteen points from-“ He paused, his angry gaze distorting into an uncomfortable and almost unrecognizable confusion. At that thought he grimaced, Tom Riddle was never confused. But who was this girl? Darting her eyes around the room, waving her wand as she silently cast spells, until finally her deep golden eyes landed on him. He couldn't make out any distinct features in the dim light, but he wasn't sure he'd be able to recognize her in better lighting either. </p><p>“If you know what’s good for you Riddle, you’ll shut up,” she muttered, still conducting magic with her wand. Light slowly made is way into the room and Tom realized he was in the Come and Go Room.</p><p>Interesting, he thought, seeing as he had been far from the seventh floor and on his way to potions at the time of this little detour. He turned his focus back on the witch, and was surprised to note that she looked rather ruffled. She was wearing some fitted muggle clothes that were, in a word, grimy. There were dark stains and rips she hadn’t bothered to fix alongside scrapes and scratches scattered across her face and- her arm. </p><p>Carved into pale flesh was the beginnings of a word: M-U-D. Tom didn’t have to be a genius to know what that meant. His scowl deepened. “You have no right to lay your hands upon me,” he chided, in an almost playful tone, although he didn’t bother concealing the true darkness behind his words. A cruel grin tugged at the corner of his lips in anticipation for one of his favorite curses. “and such an offense should never go unpunished—“</p><p>“Silencio.”</p><p>Her audacity, more so than her spell, rendered him temporarily mute as she crossed her arms and rolled her eyes. Tom quickly countered it, nonverbally of course, and consciously suppressed his rising ire, nevertheless he took several threatening steps towards her, closing the distance until he could easily reach out and grab her. </p><p>“How dare you-“</p><p>She cut him off again, raising a hand to stop him in his tracks. “If you want to achieve your goal, you need to go about it a different way,” she stated in a flat tone, although it seemed she was carefully picking her words. After a calculated pause she continued. “Your horcruxes will only take you down a path of madness.” </p><p>He nearly balked. “You have no idea the path I am on,” he determined, recovering after a moments pause and making his mind in that moment to keep an eye on this witch who he was certain he had never encountered before. </p><p>Using her eye contact to his advantage he delved into her mind, only to find strong walls in place, keeping him barred from gleaning any useful information about her person. He emerged, shocked that she had withstood his violent assault on her memory. Aside from a slightly shaky inhale, she showed no signs of breaking. So he tore back in, searching for any chinks in the wall surrounding her thoughts, memories, and intentions. once again he found none, and retreated. She watched him silently, as though she had anticipated each and every one of his moves. He hated it. </p><p>“Who are you and why did you drag me in here?” he demanded, scrutinizing the girl from her unruly curls to her battered trainers. “Why aren’t you in uniform?”</p><p>The girl huffed out a laugh, “I’m just here to give you a glimpse of your future, but by all means, continue on your way to class.”</p><p>She was beyond strange, her light tone was strained, and her strength was masked by an air of defeat. True, he didn’t buy into his Knights’ views of purity to the extent that they did, but if her scars held any truth then she was the lowest of the low. And yet she could keep him out of her head. Tom was intrigued. She had potential, but, looking at his timepiece, he found that he didn’t have time. </p><p>“Accost me again and I won’t bother wasting my breath to explain myself,” he murmured in a low voice before turning on his heel and making his way to the door. He opened it with poise and stepped into a very different hall than the one he’d been taken from moments prior. The portraits were vacated, tapestries torn, smoke and dust filled the air, and massive chunks of the wall had apparently been blasted away, leaving rubble and stone scattered across the floors that had, only a moment before, been filled with bustling students. </p><p>In the three minutes he had spent inside the room, Hogwarts had seen a war.</p>
