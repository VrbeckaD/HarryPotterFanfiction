    <p>'The marks humans leave are too often scars'<br/>
-John Green</p><p>Ron sighs for the tenth time that night. He hates his job. Hell, he hates his life. What had he done to deserve living in this hellhole? “God forbid the tables are free from vermin for once. And the glasses, oh don't even get me started on the glasses.” He thinks. To be honest, everything about this place disgusts him. Especially the old men who leer at him and make bigoted comments about his uniform. The bar was teaming, as usual, with rejects of the places which had standards. The only thing out of place from the norm tonight was the woman sitting on the second to last barstool. She wore a green pencil skirt with a matching green clutch which she holds on to for dear life while typing rapidly on her laptop with one hand. But that wasn't the strange thing. No, the strange thing was, all the time she has been typing, she has never once looked away from him, even as he hurries around the bar. Finally, he has has enough. Slamming down the glass he was in the process of cleaning and leaning on the bar he almost shouts to be heard over the pounding music. </p><p>"Just what is your problem!?" He questions indignantly "You sit here not ordering a thing in your fancy suit typing away and staring at me all the time. Now let me tell you one thing. I'm not proud of what I've sunk to, but that doesn't mean I give a flying hoot about your opinion. Because guess what? You don't have the right to judge me. You can't just come in her and act all aloof and look down on me. Because my curse is circumstance and what's more, you should pray for the wicked." </p><p>The woman looks slightly taken aback but then cracks an ear-splitting grin.  </p><p>"Oh, you ARE perfect. I thought it but i didn't dare hope. I must call McGonagall! Oh, she's going to love me for this" Okay so now he was less angry and more confused. Perfect for what? And who was McGonagall?  </p><p>"Okay, well as much as i would love to stay and chat with you I have a job to get back to." He turns to leave but the woman grabs his sleeve. </p><p>"Oh no you are not going anywhere. You're my ticket out of McGonagall's bad book and into Blaise's good one." Ron is really starting to get impatient now. Who is this random woman to come into his life and treat him like an object (he got enough of that anyway) to trade for people's favor!? </p><p>"Alright so I can see that you're starting to get annoyed now but just hear me out. I'll be quick i promise." She doesn't wait for a reply before launching into her speech. </p><p>"My name's Pansy Parkinson." She slides a green and black embossed business card across the table and continues talking. "I work for a modeling company. It's quite famous. Anyway, you're exactly the type of person we're looking for to be the new face of the company." Ron is in a state of total shock. Him!? Modeling!? He can hear his mother's laughter ringing in his ears. Perhaps that was the reason he shakes his head, the thought of invoking any more of his mother's scorn than absolutely necessary making him shudder. </p><p>"Thanks for the offer." He says (he might be disowned but if that meant he was going to be anything less than absolutely polite than his name wasn't Ronald Bilius Weasley) "But it's a no. I'm fine here." Pansy looks skeptical but nods. </p><p>"Just think about it." She presses the business card into his hand, and he slides it into his pocket almost reflexively  </p><p>"Fine" He begins to walk away but, distracted as he is, he isn't quite as adept at avoiding the sea of hands that grabbed at him and accidently allows himself to be snagged into the lap of some disgusting pervert. </p><p>"Oh! Excuse me I must have tripped" He tries to lever himself to his feet, but the men grab at him, keeping him down. </p><p>"Come on darlin'. Loosen up! We'll show you a good time..." The clearly drunken man let his slur trail off with his intention clear. </p><p>"I'm good thanks." Ron replies somewhat nervously. </p><p>"Oh, come on, don't be a killjoy" Ron somehow manages to tear himself from their grip and strides over to where Pansy still typed furiously, ignoring the shouts of "prude" that followed him across the room.  </p><p>"I've reconsidered" He says, and Pansy turns around with a smirk </p><p>"Oh really?" </p><p>She gives him no chance to re-evaluate his choice, dragging him out into the bitter wind without even a jacket, no matter that it was the middle of his shift. She hails a taxi and pushes him inside, and then leans through the front driver window to speak to him. Ron can only hear the faintest shreds of their conversation through the roaring wind but the general message he gets is that the driver was refusing to drive a 'prostitute' (although he didn't say prostitute if you know what I mean) and Pansy is bargaining desperately. </p><p>It takes a total of over 15 minutes, but she finally slides into the seat next to him with a sour look. </p><p>"Absolutely robbed me" She mutters as the cab takes off. Ron feels uncomfortable because he's only just met the woman and she's already had to pay quite a lot for it. Oh, and all the messages about stranger danger his estranged mother had drilled into him at an early age are rushing back to him and he can't believe he's just gotten into a car with a total stranger oh god he is going to die.  </p><p>"The agency is right around the corner, so I'll show you to McGonagall and then we'll work something out." He nods and looks straight ahead of him, a bundle of nerves and trepidation. He hopes he won't completely mess up his chance at escaping that horrible place, but he decides not to hold out much hope. On the other hand, what’s the worst that could happen?</p>
