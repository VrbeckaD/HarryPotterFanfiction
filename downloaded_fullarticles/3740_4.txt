  <b>November 2006</b>
</p><p> </p><p>The light pierced his eyes through his eyelids like razors. There was a horrible, bitter taste in his mouth and his whole body ached. The position he was in was uncomfortable, but he didn’t feel strong enough to move. Slowly, he opened his eyes, and the world appeared in front of him like a badly taken photograph. He couldn’t see right because everything was blurry. His head throbbed and someone was trying to talk to him. The same person shoved him on his shoulder with some insistence. Merlin, he just wanted to <em>die</em>.</p><p> </p><p>He blinked a few times, trying to get the hangover out of his head, and Pansy appeared in his line of sight.</p><p> </p><p>"I'll throw you down the porch if you don’t get up now." Her voice threatened and he rolled his eyes, sitting up on her huge sofa. It wasn’t his house. For a moment, he was disoriented. He wasn’t at home. Then the images began to appear slowly in his troubled mind. Oh. The club. He was out with Pansy, Blaise and Theo. He drank until he was pissed drunk, danced with several people, and after that, things began to disappear. As per usual. He didn’t care anymore. But the <em>day after’s headache</em>...</p><p> </p><p>Draco always felt like shite when he woke up in the following days. That didn’t stop him from doing it all over again, though. He rested his elbows on his thighs and his face in his hands, staring for a while at the emptiness before rising on his feet. His legs were wobbly, but he was accustomed to the sensation. He went to the toilet and looked at his face in the mirror. He was a mess. His blond hair was sticking in different directions, and he had glitter all over himself. He had deep dark circles and his lips were cracked. There were purple spots on his neck, where someone had certainly been excited, but he didn’t remember. He swallowed, blinking at his face, and quickly wiped a tear that slipped. He took a deep breath before starting to take off his destroyed clothes. Draco had a collection of them at Pansy's house, where he often woke up.</p><p> </p><p>The truth, he thought as he let hot water fall on his battered muscles, was that he hated this life. He hated clubs, hated drinking, hated the guys he danced with and fell with every night, and he hated the next days. But he couldn’t stop. He couldn’t stop simply because being sober was much worse than being hungover. Thinking about a headache, the taste of bile and the preaching he would receive from Pansy was better than the pain that was constantly there. A pain that didn’t quit even after an orgasm with a delicious face. That didn’t dissipate even when he was laughing and dancing. He needed to be asleep not to think. And he did it night after night, after night...</p><p> </p><p>His Gringotts’s account was suffering from his constant excesses. His health, too. He didn’t care. There were days when he wondered if it would be that the day that he would finally stop waking up. It was dramatic, he knew. He always woke up the next day. And that just made him want to drink more.</p><p> </p><p>When he arrived in the kitchen of his friend's modern apartment, practically in the centre of London, he felt better. He was wearing denims that he knew fit perfectly to his body, but he didn’t bother to put on a shirt. The smell of tea was wonderful even from a distance, and as he sat down at the table, Pansy set a steaming cup in front of him. Her expression, however, was severe.</p><p> </p><p>"Draco, you have to stop.” She said, sighing and sitting down next to him. Draco couldn’t stop his eyes from rolling.</p><p> </p><p>“Pans, I already...”</p><p> </p><p>"Draco, I'm serious,” Pansy interrupted him, and for a moment, he realized she was no longer his teenage friend. Pansy was a twenty-five-year-old woman. <em>Heavens</em>. 25 years old and she already looked like an adult. He wanted to die. "Theo had to get you out of a car yesterday. A Muggle’s car. Do you know how dangerous is this?”</p><p> </p><p>“A Muggle’s?” Draco laughed, wishing to remember, but without actually making any effort.</p><p> </p><p>“Drake, seriously. <em>Please</em>,” She frowned. “Everyone's worried. You just get worse. It’s no longer fun. Either you get over it or we're going to have you hospitalized for addiction.”</p><p> </p><p>“Pans, please. Stop overreacting. I'm fine, am I not?”</p><p> </p><p>"Not by your own choice!" She practically screamed, her eyes filling with tears. He felt a little guilty. "Can you stop trying to kill yourself? Everyone's trying, here. It's not easy for anyone. But you seem to want to sink and drag everyone down with you!”</p><p> </p><p>"Then don’t go with me!" He replied it to the same extent, standing up angrily.</p><p> </p><p>Pansy stared at him for some time, hurt. She sniffled, wiping her eyes and trying to calm down.</p><p> </p><p>“Draco, I love you. I love you so much. But you <em>have</em> to stop. I don’t want to bury anyone else,” She said in a weak voice, and he fell back on the chair, hiding his face in his hands. He felt her warm hand on his back, her fingernails making soothing circles on his back. "You could talk to him-"</p><p> </p><p>"And ruin his perfect life, Pans?" Draco lifted his face, laughing at the tears streaming down his face. “It's been years. It doesn’t make any difference.”</p><p> </p><p>“It does for you.”</p><p> </p><p>Draco couldn’t deny it. He denied for a whole year after the ‘incident’ and tried to live as if he wasn’t hurt. As if he wasn’t empty. Like he wasn’t dying inside. Now, he couldn’t deny it. Every night was difficult, but when his name appeared, it was worse. When he saw his face on the <em>Prophet</em>, Draco couldn’t stop thinking ‘what if...’. What if he had made different decisions three years ago? Had he admitted to himself what he felt at that moment? If he hadn’t been so afraid... If... If... Now he couldn’t do anything. The paths had already been traced, in very different directions, and Draco couldn’t simply turn his back and return. How do you go back in a direction that you had lost so long ago?</p><p> </p><p>“He doesn’t even remember me,” His voice sounded fake even to himself.</p><p> </p><p>"You're Draco Malfoy. He's Harry Potter. If there's anyone he remembers, it's you,” She said, simply, and pulled him into a hug that he would deny forever that he needed, but that took minutes to finish.</p><p> </p><p>||<em>First line, take mine; I'm fine as fuck</em><br/> <em>Love myself tonight and I think you can feel the same</em><br/><em> Moonshine, good time; babe, you're in luck</em><br/><em> 'Cause I will do whatever comes to mind</em><br/><em> You'll go insane</em> ||</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> <b>- Influence – Tove Lo</b> </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <b>July 2003</b>
</p><p> </p><p>Draco couldn’t believe his eyes. Apparently, Pansy and Blaise couldn’t either. They were in their favourite pub, the Fairy Finger, conveniently located in a hidden part of the Wizarding London. After the war, Draco had found the pub when he was looking for somewhere to celebrate his freedom after five months of community service - his sentence greatly diminished by the influence of certain heroes - and nowadays he was a frequent customer. It was cosy, and at the same time, it had a certain class that he thought was fit for someone in his condition - his name was in the mud, but he was still rich, so he didn’t want to go to the Leaky like some commoner. He should’ve realized that that day was special because... Well, first, it was the end of the month. People were out on the street spending their just received salaries. And for some reason, there was celebration everywhere.</p><p> </p><p>As he entered the pub, Draco realized why. It was the birthday of the Great Saviour of the Wizarding World, and this same Saviour was completely drunk on the karaoke stage, singing Celestina Warbeck at the top of his lungs. Granger seemed to be laughing to tears at a nearby table, and Weasley was standing on the chair, singing along, even though Potter’s out of tune singing was standing all over the voices singing the same song.</p><p> </p><p>Draco looked at the scene firstly with contempt, then with disgust, and then he could no longer control his laughter. Potter made faces, practically hugging the amplifier as if it was the love of his life. And when Draco started laughing, for some reason, it was the moment when Potter decided to open his eyes and move them directly to Draco.</p><p> </p><p>“Draco Malfoy!” He shouted, and many heads turned to the pub’s entrance. "You came to congratulate me! Thank you! You're beautiful!” Potter said, and Draco started to laugh even harder, his cheeks burning. Pansy laughed so hard that she was practically hanging on Blaise’s neck. “Hermione! I want him as a gift!”</p><p> </p><p>Draco watched as Granger stepped onto the stage to pull the amplifier out of Harry’s hands, who seemed reluctant to drop the object. If Draco knew that by the end of that night he would be against a wall and being snogged mercilessly by Harry Potter's insistent lips, he would probably have turned around at that moment and gone home. But as he didn’t know, he just laughed when Pansy tapped his shoulder and asked in a jocular tone:</p><p> </p><p>"What about that, Drake? Are you going to give Potter the gift he wants?”</p><p> </p><p>After that day, it was easy to accept Potter's attacks. Draco owed nothing to anyone, he was free, Potter himself had freed him from his ties to the Ministry, and despite the tattoo still marking his skin, the brunet looked like he didn’t care about the past. At least it was what it seemed when his mouth marked the thin skin of Draco's neck before he even opened the door to his flat.</p><p> </p><p>They had three first dates. On Potter's birthday, Draco was deliciously attacked at the bar, and he realised with delight that Potter cared nothing for the public, considering that his hands didn’t leave his arse for a second and, if they left, it was to hold tight on his leg, his waist or his neck. He would have taken him home if Granger and Weasley had not dragged him away, claiming that Potter was ‘too drunk to know what he was doing’. Other than that, however, they didn’t seem to care that their precious Saint Potter was boggling with a Malfoy against the wall of a pub. In fact, they left laughing.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Weird.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>At the second date, however, Harry was sober. He was in a new club that had opened a few weeks ago and was having a debut boom. Potter was alone and sat next to him with two drinks and a humorous smile on his lips. Apparently, Potter was curious because, although he had had some affairs, he had never gone to bed with any man. Draco was more than happy to help him with this problem. Potter took him to his flat, which he apparently had bought on impulse, and if he didn’t know beforehand, Draco would have thought he was a pro. Potter took pleasure in giving pleasure, and Draco lost his teacher posture after the first five minutes. Potter wasn’t that good at sucking, it was true. He couldn’t go too deep and had little care with his teeth, but the same couldn’t be said of his ability to lick. Draco was completely ashamed of how many moans came out of his mouth, his mind confused and his mouth drooling, as Harry pushed him against the mattress, his hands opening his arse cheeks obscenely as he applied one of his best demonstrations of a cunnilingus.</p><p> </p><p>Not to mention all the rest, of course. Potter was wonderfully well-endowed - 23 centimetres and a half if he remembered Harry's words correctly - which was ironic since Harry was almost 10 centimetres shorter than he was. Draco was proud of his nearly 17, but he was also what would be called a size queen, so he could say that he made a point of enjoying the night very well. In fact, when he woke up, it was four in the morning, and he felt hot, sore in the best places and completely exhausted. He didn’t even want to sleep. He hated sleeping over after sex, and he hated giving the wrong impression. But there he was, at dawn, trying to pull away from Potter's arms, which seemed more like tentacles, so tightly wrapped around him.</p><p> </p><p>When he got home, however, Draco had a smile on his face.</p><p> </p><p>At the third date, Potter barely had to call him. They ended the night against the back wall of the pub, Draco's trousers around his knees and Potter kneeling behind him. Malfoy didn’t know he liked having his arse eaten out so much up to that point, and who would he be to deny something that Potter wanted to do and was terribly good at?</p><p> </p><p>From that day on, they ended up creating a ritual, though not explicit. Every Friday, they'd meet up in Fairy Finger casually, and they'd end the night together in Potter's flat for another sex session. He couldn’t say they were friends. They barely knew each other. Draco could describe Harry's favourite methods in detail as he prepared Draco to be penetrated. He could also tell what kind of lubricant he liked and that Potter hated protection spells, but since Draco refused to use those Muggle things, he resigned himself to using them - Draco suspected that it wasn’t for the spell itself, but because Potter always had to ask Draco to conjure them, which always broke the mood. After realising this, Draco simply did it without being asked, and Potter no longer complained about it. If he complained, Draco would be insistent. He wanted nothing between his body and that masterpiece that was Harry Potter's cock. Other than that, Draco had no idea if Potter preferred fermented or distilled beverages, or whether he cheered for Puddlemore or the Cannons, like the rest of the Weasleys. And he was fine with it. Potter was fun, a guarantee of sex at the end of the week that he liked to think of as a last resource if he couldn’t get someone better.</p><p> </p><p>Draco kept seeing other people, of course. He also still went to clubs and danced until he got tired. He was young, free. His father was in Azkaban, his mother didn’t give a flipping fuck of what he did in his life, and Draco wanted to enjoy it. He wanted to enjoy that freedom before he had to do whatever adults did. Marrying, raising a family, having a job or whatever. He was 22 years old and was very happy to do what he absolutely wanted. He should have realised when things started to change. As always, he let these important details pass.</p><p> </p><p><em>|| Now if we're talking body</em><br/> <em>You got a perfect one, so put it on me</em><br/><em> Swear it won't take you long</em><br/><em> If you love me right</em><br/><em> We fuck for life, on and on and on</em>||</p><p>
  <em> <b>- Talking body – Tove Lo</b> </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, Malfoy,” Potter sat beside him casually, not caring for Theodore Nott's raised eyebrows for his intrusion on the Slytherin table. It was agreed that neither the Slytherins nor the Gryffindors would interfere with the meetings between their two members, but they didn’t mingle. Harry smiled at Pansy, who smiled back, and slapped Blaise's shoulder as if they were best friends. “Thursday. You have to go. It's your team, isn’t it?” Potter said, holding out what looked like a ticket.</p><p> </p><p>Draco frowned, grabbing the ticket and reading it. It was the Puddlemore game that was going to happen on that Thursday. The tickets were sold out in the first hour of opening, and Draco only heard anything about the game the next day.</p><p> </p><p>"Are you asking me to go with you?" He asked, and Potter nodded as if it were nothing, drinking from his beer bottle before answering.</p><p> </p><p>"Yes. I would have called you guys too, but they gave me a courtesy, and there were only two of them,” He explained to the others. He turned to Draco and smiled. "I'll see you Thursday, then. In my flat.” And with a kiss on the corner of his mouth, Harry got up and went to the Gryffindors’ table.</p><p> </p><p>Draco stared at the ticket in his hand, not really knowing what to do, so he just tucked it into his pocket and went back to drinking his cocktail.</p><p> </p><p>"Has Potter just called you on a date?" Theodore asked, and Draco laughed.</p><p> </p><p>"He has a very bad idea of a date, then. A Quidditch game is anything but romantic,” He said.</p><p> </p><p>"But there's a lot of hot blokes being aggressive,” Pansy pointed, and Draco laughed even more.</p><p> </p><p>"Well, if he wanted me just for him, he would hardly show me more hot men, would he?" Draco asked, and Blaise scowled at his drink.</p><p> </p><p>"Can we stop talking about these things? There is someone at this table who has no preference towards penises,” Zabini complained, and Theo turned to Pansy.</p><p> </p><p>"Getting out of the closet, Pans?" He asked, and had to jump off the table to avoid the kick that Blaise aimed at his legs while Pansy tried to breath as she laughed and choked at the same time.</p><p> </p><p>On that night, he didn’t return to Potter's flat for another sex session, which was a strange change in his routine, but Draco dismissed the thoughts about it. It was only a week without kissing Potter. He had spent much more time without doing this and it wasn’t the end of the world. It was relatively early when he returned to the Manor, and he couldn’t resist staring at the ticket for a while. What was the problem? He liked Puddlemore, apparently Potter too. Obviously, he couldn’t take Weasley with him, and it was common knowledge that Granger wasn’t a fan of the sport. Draco didn’t know about Potter’s other friends, but he believed that the brunet’s best option was him and why let a ticket get lost if he could take someone who would enjoy the game as much as he?</p><p> </p><p>Draco decided he didn’t want to think about it anymore. He changed his clothes and went out to a nightclub. Some drink, dancing, and maybe some casual sex would lighten his thoughts. A few hours later, he was in a hotel room with a boy with brown curls and an athlete body, tanned and ripped. Draco was amused, but the athlete wasn’t exceptional and certainly didn’t have 23 centimetres. A few minutes later, he was getting dressed and soon returned home. It was nice to be distracted, but when he laid his head on his bed, Draco didn’t sleep right away. He could only relax after he decided what clothes he was going to use for the game on Thursday, even though he still had many days to decide.</p><p> </p><p>When Thursday came, Draco was ready before lunch. Of course, it was because he needed to be perfect, as always. Potter would probably be dressed in jeans and a tee, so he tried not to dress in a classic way. Black trousers, Italian leather boots, and a light blue jumper looked quite appropriate. The day was cold, but when Draco rang the bell, his coat was on his arm rather than on his body. He didn’t want to look so formal or casual. Potter soon opened the door, and Draco wasn’t wrong when he thought he would be dressed quite casually. That didn’t mean that Potter wasn’t delicious. He wore faded blue denims, trail boots, and a Puddlemore United shirt, which was the exact size to cover his body and at the same time reveal every muscle in his chest, abdomen, and arms.</p><p> </p><p>Draco looked at him without really trying to disguise it, and when he looked up at Harry's face again, there was a smug smile on his lips. The blond noticed that Potter had pointed incisors, and one of them was slightly crooked. He couldn’t help but think it was adorable.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey,” Draco greeted him, and Harry pulled him by the waist and kissed him right there at the door, to Draco's surprise. His big hands were warm from where they were, at the sides of his waist, and he unconsciously leaned against Harry’s body, his free arm leaning against his chest. Potter had a delicious kiss, always long, with tongue and small nibbles and sucking on his lips.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey,” Potter said against his mouth, and Draco smiled sideways, raising a hand and gently pulling the little curls that rested on the back of Harry’s neck.</p><p> </p><p>“Changing your mind about the game? Would you rather stay at home?” Draco asked, feeling his body heat easily with the prospect of sex, but Potter gave him a kiss on the lips before he moved.</p><p> </p><p>"Are you crazy? Pudd will play against the Arrows and I plan to see them completely destroyed by the end of the day,” He said, pushing Draco a little further into the hall, before pulling on his own coat and closing the door to his flat. "Not that I wouldn’t love to see you completely destroyed by the end of the day either.” He winked, and Draco rolled his eyes, following Harry to the apparition point.</p><p> </p><p>They made their way to the place where they would get the portkey, and about half an hour later they were climbing the endless steps of the Arrows' Quidditch pitch. Puddlemore would play away from home, but most of the spectators in the field were wearing blue, at least so far. After long minutes of climbing, they finally reached the VIP area, where there were small booths where they could stay away from the eyes of the general public and enjoy the game without worrying about all the thrust that always happened. He and Harry would be left alone for the duration of the game, and Draco's mind had been filled with not very chaste ideas. As Harry sat down in one of the comfortable chairs, he looked up to Draco, waiting for him to sit on the other, but the blond had another idea.</p><p> </p><p>He sat down on Potter's lap with one leg on either side and, taking advantage of Harry's surprise, grabbed him by the hair, kissing him hungrily. Potter moaned between surprise and pleasure, his hands immediately going to his arse, as Draco knew they would. Potter had a fascination with his arse and couldn’t even disguise it; Draco took advantage of that whenever possible. He felt the man's hands go up to his back, slip under his jumper, and crawl over his warm skin. Draco bit his lover’s lower lip, sucking it, then giving the same treatment to the top one before completely losing them. Potter was attacking his neck, and Draco smiled, his eyes closed. He knew that that afternoon would be very enjoyable. He was lost in Potter’s hands and kisses, but they stopped as soon as the whistle indicating the beginning of the game sounded. Potter was panting and smiling, but he pushed him gently, making Draco sit in the chair next to him. His denims didn’t cover the huge erection in his crotch area, and Draco wanted to kneel between his legs and free him from his confinement, but the players flying in front of him caught his eye.</p><p> </p><p><em>Well,</em> he thought. <em>We have the whole game. We'll soon be catching up again.</em></p><p> </p><p>Four hours later, Draco was grinning from ear to ear as he and Harry were going down the bleachers. His throat burned and his voice was hoarse, but for different reasons than he had imagined. The game was relatively fast for a match between Puddlemere and the Appleby Arrows, but extremely exciting. Draco had forgotten how much he loved Quidditch. After half an hour, he found himself screaming, laughing and vibrating at every turn of the players, cursing wrong moves and commenting every step with Potter, who was as excited as he was. As time passed, kisses were forgotten in favour of commemoration when the Arrows' seeker caught the snitch inadvertently, ending the game and making Puddlemere win by more than 130 points ahead.</p><p> </p><p>When the game was over, it was dark, and he was hungry. They followed the flow of the crowd, and Harry held him by the wrist so they wouldn’t get lost in the sea of people. The warmth of his palm felt good around his wrist, soothing, and he couldn’t stop laughing and reviewing on his favourite moments, practically screaming to be heard in the crowd’s cacophony.</p><p> </p><p>"Jacobson’s feint was amazing! I've seen it before, but he did it so well that I didn’t notice it until now!” Draco said, impressed, trying not to gesture a lot with his free hand because of the little space.<br/> "The best part was Thomas trying to recover after it,” Harry laughed, and for a few seconds, Draco was lost in that carefree smile. They crossed the gates, and Draco managed to breathe deeply as the crowd dispersed.</p><p> </p><p>“I'm starving,” Potter said, releasing the other's wrist now that they were freer, and Draco wished they were between those people again because he missed the contact. “There's a snack bar I love. I mean, it sells hotdogs and burgers, but we can go to a more refined place if you want.”</p><p> </p><p>Draco rolled his eyes, playfully punching the brunet on the shoulder.</p><p> </p><p>"I can enjoy a burger as much as anyone, okay?”</p><p> </p><p>"I'm sorry to think that the Great Draco Malfoy wouldn’t know the wonders of Muggle fast food." Harry raised his hands as if surrendering, and Draco laughed at his gesture.</p><p> </p><p>They took the portkey and soon they were back in London. They apparated in a dark alley near the snack bar and, logically, they took a few minutes to cling to themselves against the wall for a long snog. It was colder now at night and they both wore their coats, even as they entered the diner, that was a little warmer.</p><p> </p><p>They sat at one of the tables near the wall, where the benches were padded and they could sit side by side. They made their orders and ended up taking off their coats as they waited, as it started to get hot. The place was relatively empty and they felt more comfortable talking about the game without attracting the attention of uninformed Muggles. They ate and Harry couldn’t resist teasing Draco with his chips, and they started a mini-war until Draco agreed to show how far he could get a hotdog into his mouth.</p><p> </p><p>They were enjoying themselves so much that they only noticed a man muttering on the other side of the diner at the end of the meal. Draco was sure he heard the man say something like ‘<em>bloody fags</em>’ against his drink, and look at them with an unfriendly expression. Which was funny because until that moment they hadn’t touched, kissed, hugged or anything. Draco elbowed Potter and pointed the man with his eyes. Harry noticed and his smile was too Slytherin for Draco's taste. He took one last sip of his coke before turning sideways. Without any warning, he attacked the blond's neck in an open kiss, running his tongue across the muscle and sucking the spot hard enough for Draco to know that it would turn purple even if he healed it with magic. It was hard to control a moan as he felt Harry's mouth work around his neck, and even more when his hand rested high on his thigh, too close to his crotch. Draco practically closed his eyes, his lips parted and his breathing heavy, but then he saw that the man on the other side was wide-eyed and horrified, staring at them.</p><p> </p><p>Draco's smile was wide enough to bother him even more. Harry's hand got into his jumper, indiscreetly going up and down his stomach, and Draco held up a hand, tucked it into Harry’s jet black curls, exposing his neck further, unabashedly. In moments, Harry pulled his face and his mouth was soon receiving the same treatment as his neck was before. Draco forgot the reason for the show almost immediately, and they pulled away only when they heard someone clearing their throat.</p><p> </p><p>Draco turned away from Potter, his lips swollen and red, and looked up. A waitress tried to sound serious, but she was clearly nervous.</p><p> </p><p>"I'm sorry, but... I need to ask you to stop. The other customers are feeling uncomfortable,” She said, her voice cracking a little, and Draco laughed wryly. The ‘other clients’ were a couple of punks who were doing exactly what he and Harry were doing a few seconds ago and the man on the other side. Before he could say anything, however, Harry stood up, pulling him with him.</p><p> </p><p>"Don’t worry, Daisy,” Potter said in his deliciously hoarse voice, the same Harry used when he described what he was going to do to Draco while he took off his clothes. Potter took his wallet out of his pocket, picking up several notes of Muggle money, folding them and stuffing it into the front pocket of the girl's shirt, where her name was sawn. “We're leaving.” He finished, pushing Draco out of the space so they could leave. He grabbed their coats from the upholstery and smiled provocatively at her. Draco didn’t know if he really liked seeing that smile directed at someone else. "And if you want to know... I would have done the same to you," He said, giving her a kiss on the cheek, which clearly made her melt, before taking Draco by the wrist again and pulling him out of the diner.</p><p> </p><p>When the chill of the night hit them hard in the face, Potter was laughing freely, as if there was nothing wrong in the world. Maybe there wasn’t. Draco couldn’t resist laughing along with him.</p><p> </p><p>"Did you see his face?" Potter asked, turning his smiling face to Draco and giving him his coat, then putting on his own.</p><p> </p><p>"He'll never forget the hottest thing he's ever seen," Draco responded, and they laughed while they walked to the apparition point.</p><p> </p><p>Everything was silent when they arrived, and a smile still gleamed in their eyes. Unhurried, Harry held Draco by the waist and pushed him against the wall, kissing his lips slowly, almost casually. Draco's arms wrapped around the youngest's neck, one wrist resting on the other, and he let Harry’s body lean against his. He lost himself in that kiss and in the hands that held him firmly in the same place, not caring how long he stood there, his eyes closed, his lips moving against Potter's, tongues dragging against each other and occasionally small bites.</p><p> </p><p>When Potter pulled away, his eyes were almost closed, but the green glowed with a sensual vibration that burned Draco's eyes in the warmest way.</p><p> </p><p>"I'm going to fuck you so good you'll remember the feeling of my cock thrusting into you until next year," Potter said before he parted them both.</p><p> </p><p>Draco should’ve been wary of the veracity of these words. At the moment, however, he was so hard that he thought of nothing but the feeling of Harry fucking him into the mattress.</p><p> </p><p>If there was something that Draco had agreed to in those last few weeks Potter was good at sex. No. Not good. He was exceptional. For Harry, there was no wrong time to feel pleasure. Knowing he had been his first man did wonders for Draco's ego. He didn’t know if he was the only one, and thinking about it made him thoughtful, but he didn’t want to have second thoughts about what Potter did or didn’t do when he wasn’t with him. It was his life, after all.</p><p> </p><p>Besides, when he was being undressed by Harry’s dark hands and had his cock swallowed by his lips, Draco had lost his line of thought. Potter still wasn’t great at sucking cock, but he certainly struggled to get better. Draco grabbed him by the hair, but let him follow his own pace. Potter gripped his thighs, opening his legs and stopping his mouth for a moment. Draco stared at him for a while, grinning as Potter reached for the pot of lubricant before returning to what he was doing with even more determination.</p><p> </p><p>Draco moaned loudly as he felt two wet fingers entering his body, and spread his legs even wider, pushing against Harry's mouth involuntarily. He didn’t choke, so Draco didn’t stop, lost in the delicious pleasure he was feeling. Harry was coming and going in the rhythm of his fingers, and when the third entered, less lubricated than the others, Draco lost himself. His body arched and he was struck by an orgasm that made his toes curl, his hands tight on the sheets and his body arching out of bed. Harry didn’t stop sucking him through his orgasm, swallowing every drop of his pleasure, making Draco see stars.</p><p> </p><p>When it was over, Draco was melted against the mattress, but Harry’s fingers kept coming in and out of his body. He smiled, raising his legs and holding them under his thighs, displaying himself unashamedly. Potter's breathing got even heavier. With the help of more lubricant, he stuck the fourth finger, and Draco moaned too loud.</p><p> </p><p>“Do you like it?” Harry asked, his voice sounding hoarse and a little unsure. Draco nodded, encouraging him to continue, even though he was incapable of any coherent thinking. “Do you like to know that you’ll be open and wet... To be used as I want?”</p><p> </p><p>"Ah! Y-yes!” Draco moaned, his fingers pressing on his thighs so hard they marked them. “I want to be... Ah... Really open to you...!”</p><p> </p><p>"So open that only my cock is going to be good enough to fuck you?" Harry looked more imposing now, and Draco arched his body once more. He had never been much in love with dirty talk or possessiveness, but the pleasure was spurting through his body, and he found himself agreeing once more.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes...! Only your huge cock will fit in me...!” He moaned, narrowing his eyes as one leg escaped his sweaty hand. Potter pushed it against Draco’s chest with his free hand, making Draco practically bend back against himself, thrusting his four fingers even deeper into his body. Draco roared with pleasure, his cock once again hard and dripping over his abdomen.</p><p> </p><p>"I'm going to fuck you really slow, Malfoy... And I'm going to cum so deep inside you that when I fuck you next week, you'll still be wet with my spunk,” Potter growled close to his ear and Draco felt his legs tremble uncontrollably. <em>Merlin</em>, he knew that what Potter was saying was physically impossible, but his cock believed it to be true and was throbbing furiously, begging for relief.</p><p> </p><p>“P-Potter...!” He begged, but Harry didn’t stop with his fingers.</p><p> </p><p>"No. <em>Potter</em>, no."</p><p> </p><p>“Ugh...! H-Ha... Aah... <em>Bloody H--</em>! Ha-Haaaag...!” Draco was trying. He really was trying, but either he was talking, or he controlled himself so he wouldn’t just come with only Harry’s fingers. - <em>Haaa ~ rry!</em> Please...!”</p><p> </p><p>"Please what, my little dragon...?" The damn sadist provoked, and Draco felt the orgasm begin to rise inside him. He thought he would have to give up the need to cum while Harry fucked him.</p><p> </p><p>"Fuck me..." Draco snapped, hoarse and low. “Fuck me... <em>Fuck me</em>... <em><b>Fuck m—ah</b></em>! Aaah! <em>Harry</em>...!”</p><p> </p><p>He was about to explode when the fingers left his body and the energy dissipated, causing his body to shake so violently that Potter had to push him down with both hands and enter him at once without the help of his hands. He didn’t need it, though. His cock was so hard and Draco so deliciously open that it was a relatively easy task.</p><p> </p><p>Despite being prepared by his fingers, Draco felt Harry’s cock open him even more, and that was when he lost himself. He shrieked, involuntarily moving between them two, with strong jets of cum, painting him with pleasure all over his chest and neck, his nails pressing into his thighs with such force that they sank into his skin. Harry didn’t stop, however. He was thrusting against him, and Draco managed to open his eyes just as Harry gave in to his own orgasm, his chest and face red with excess blood, his arms still pushing Draco’s legs and a guttural moan coming out from his throat.</p><p> </p><p>Potter let his legs free and slowly Draco lowered them, feeling his back hurt a little, but his body was so exhausted that he barely noticed when he dozed off in Potter's bed once again, even before Harry could get out of him.</p><p> </p><p>At least this time he didn’t faint for hours, only minutes. When he woke up, Potter was at his side, still sweaty, with a faint smile and watching him.</p><p> </p><p>“Did you like our day?” Harry asked, and Draco let out a half-weary, half-aching laugh. God, his whole body was begging him not to move, but he felt good. Truly good, as if nothing could touch him at that moment.</p><p> </p><p>"If every trip with you ends in sex, Potter, your friends must be very happy," Draco teased, and Harry laughed, pinching him lightly on his waist.</p><p> </p><p>"None of them have an arse like yours, so I don’t really want to end the day like this with them," Potter said, biting Draco's shoulder and giving him a huge, satisfied smile.</p><p> </p><p>Draco couldn’t deny that, so he laughed and accepted the slow kiss he received.</p><p> </p><p>After a few minutes enjoying the rest of the sexual energy he still had with a few kisses, Draco got dressed and went home. He took a long bath, and almost slept in the bathtub. When he lay down in his enormous bed, only in his boxers, he fell asleep almost immediately, but a smile still gleamed on his face.</p><p> </p><p>||<em> I don't know how it led to this</em><br/> I felt a tremor in your kiss<br/> Earth shakes, and I answer it, my body realigns<br/> It's too much, I cannot handle this<br/> I taste the pleasure on your lips<br/> You make planets start to spin<br/> I'm ready to ignite||</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> <b>- Meteorite – Years and Years</b> </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“You look happy,” Pansy said when Draco met her the next night so they could go to a new nightclub with Theo and Blaise.</p><p> </p><p>"’Well fucked’ is more accurate,” Draco said, laughing. They were walking from the apparition point to the nightclub. The black leather trousers were tight around the blond’s legs and he practically paraded with his open jacket with a transparent shirt inside. He was so excited that he wanted to dance and drink all night.</p><p> </p><p>"Wasn’t it your date with Potter yesterday?" Theodore asked, and Draco snorted.</p><p> </p><p>“We watched the game, and then we grabbed a cheap dinner and fucked until we passed out. It was a good day,” He said, smiling smugly to Theo, who shook his head.</p><p> </p><p>"Don’t you think about anything beyond sex?" Blaise asked, and Draco looked at him with disdain.</p><p> </p><p>“Do you?”</p><p> </p><p>"<em>Merlin</em>! Men really have their brain on their dick heads,” Pansy rolled her eyes, and Draco hugged her by the shoulders.</p><p> </p><p>"And you have yours on your tits. That's why your clothes have so much cleavage,” He said, cupping one of her breasts as she tried to escape his grip, laughing and beating his hand.</p><p> </p><p>“Can you stop playing around? I know you wanted a pair of these beauties, but unfortunately, you were born with a pair of balls,” She pushed him over the head, making him stumble, but he was still laughing.</p><p> </p><p>"Why do you let him touch you, but not us?" Theodore asked indignantly.</p><p> </p><p>"Because when I pick them up, my prick doesn’t get hard,” Draco replied simply, and Blaise laughed.</p><p> </p><p>They entered the club, and Draco let the rhythm take him away. He danced, lost his count of how many drinks he had or how many boys he kissed. He danced over the bar, lost his jacket, and gave Pansy a lapdance, who put galleons in his pockets. Draco felt truly happy. Free.<br/> Merlin, he felt <em>free</em>. And that was the best feeling in the world.</p><p> </p><p>The days passed, and he found himself in a predictable routine. Every Friday he met with Potter, went to a restaurant or ate fast food, and always ended the day in bed. The brunet was getting better and better at giving head, and more and more sure of himself in sex. Draco realized at each passing week that Potter was full of kinks and that he tried to perform them whenever possible.</p><p> </p><p>From time to time they met in the clubs and danced together out of rhythm. Potter wasn’t really a good dancer, but it was nice to fret against him and feel his hands touching his body without shame. They usually left the club separated. Potter always went first, and Draco much, much later with someone in his arm for a sex session that wasn’t nearly as intense as with Potter, but that made him sleep smiling.</p><p> </p><p>It was late November when Draco began to notice something different. Not strange, but different. Since the beginning of the month, he had reduced the number of his encounters with other people but exponentially increased his encounters with Potter. And they were hanging out in the daytime. And they were not always having sex.</p><p> </p><p>Draco tried not to think too much about it. From time to time, he was still coming home with someone who wasn’t Potter, and even though the two were talking much more, going to restaurants and diners together, it was just the natural course of things. Draco wasn’t worried. He thought Potter was hot, the sex was great, and he had a 23 and a half centimetres prick. It was all Draco needed in his life.</p><p> </p><p>|| <em>Is it desire</em><br/> Or is it love that I'm feeling for you?<br/> I want desire<br/> 'Cause your love only gets me abused</p><p><em>Is it desire (is it desire)</em><br/> Or is it love that I'm feeling for you?<br/> I want desire<br/> I wanna see what you're willing to lose||</p><p>
  <em> <b>- Desire – Years and Years</b> </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Draco wouldn’t say he was questioning his silent agreement with Potter. No. He was just wondering if they were caring too much about each other. Harry once questioned why he was still going to the clubs, and Draco thought it was a very stupid question to ask. <em>Because he could</em>. Because it was good. Because he was young, rich and had his brain in his private parts. At the same time, he wanted to ask exactly the same question to Potter. He wanted to know why the hell he was still going to the clubs.</p><p> </p><p>He never saw Potter dancing with people other than himself. Did he also have dates with people other than Draco? Did he have something as intense as the sex they had with someone else? Was Potter just using Draco to find himself out? It was possible.</p><p> </p><p>Draco didn’t want to admit it, but sometimes - just a few times - those questions left him up too long at night. When he thought of Potter with someone else, he felt a sting of jealousy going through his body. A wave he tried to control at all costs. He couldn’t ask for fidelity to someone who wasn’t his boyfriend, much less when he offered none to anyone. Still, the feeling of selfishness was there. He had Potter in his bed and didn’t want to share that sexual talent with anyone. He didn’t like the idea of someone having Potter as intimately as he had, and that made him nervous.</p><p> </p><p>So the solution was always more drink, more clubs, more guys. In January, Draco spent the New Year fucking with what’s-his-name, who had a lovely fox tattoo on his left thigh, which Draco looked at for a long time before actually performing a blowjob on the guy lying beneath him. The sex wasn’t as good as with Potter, but he always had Fridays so he didn’t mind picking up some stupid guys while he waited.</p><p> </p><p>By the second week of January, however, Harry said he couldn’t meet him on that Friday. He had a celebration of something that Draco didn’t pay attention to with his friends and the Weasleys, so couldn’t hang out with him. Unless Draco wanted to go.</p><p> </p><p>Draco obviously went to drink and fuck strangers.</p><p> </p><p>Late in the evening, however, as he undressed to bed, Draco desperately tried to remember what Harry was celebrating. Whatever it was, now he had realized he wanted to be a part of it, but he simply said ‘congratulations, Potter’ when the brunet had told him, then refused the invitation.</p><p> </p><p>On the next week, however, he was determined to know what he had lost. Potter met him in the Fairy Finger, as usual, and they drank a few pints and talked among their groups of friends. After months of this same routine, they no longer felt uncomfortable between the two tables, and Draco needed to be restrained from being shocked to see Ginny Weasley sitting on Blaise Zabini's lap as if she were a queen sitting on a throne.</p><p> </p><p>Well, Draco had his own throne.</p><p> </p><p>At the moment, he was looking at Harry's face with fascination. Harry's cock was practically buried in his throat, and Draco bobbed his head up and down, feeling his jaw ache with the repetitive motion, his mouth opened almost impossibly, his tongue curling around his thick cock, the bittersweet taste of Harry lingering in his mouth. His fingernails were buried in the other's muscular thighs, and he didn’t control a groan whenever Harry tugged lightly at his hair, lost in his own pleasure. His plump lips were parted and his eyes closed in sheer delight. Draco felt something in his stomach, like butterflies, when he thought that it was <em>he</em> who caused these sensations in Harry. It was he who gave this pleasure to him.</p><p> </p><p>Draco wanted more, though. He wanted to have Potter completely at his mercy. So he pulled away, his breathing unsteady. It caught the attention of Potter, who opened his eyes and swallowed.</p><p> </p><p>"Dray..." he whispered hoarsely, and Draco almost came just from hearing his voice so filled with pleasure.</p><p> </p><p>" ’Arry..." Draco tried to speak, but his tongue was heavy. He swallowed his own saliva, thick, with a taste that was definitely Harry. “Fuck my throat...”</p><p> </p><p>"Draay... No..." Harry tried to deny, his cock throbbing painfully between Draco's fingers. “Don’t ask for that... A-Ahh...”</p><p> </p><p>“I need it... Harry... Fuck my throat... Fuck my mouth just like you do with my arse... Fuck my mouth, let me swallow your cum... Harry...” He begged, and Harry squinted, holding Draco's hair one more time and thrusting his cock into his anxious mouth. He only waited for Draco to look at him, giving him permission, before he moved his hips with vigour, holding the sides of Draco’s head and thrusting his cock to the end.</p><p> </p><p>Draco had to concentrate so he wouldn’t choke and take it all, but he didn’t need to wait long. Harry squirmed on the couch, emptying himself so deep into Draco's throat that the blond couldn’t feel his taste on his tongue.</p><p> </p><p>Draco pulled away, smiling as he licked his mouth clean, his ego growing wonderfully as he saw Harry lost, staring at the ceiling vaguely as if he had used drugs. Well... Sex was kind of a drug, really. Draco knew how addicted he was.</p><p> </p><p>Draco climbed up on Harry, straddling his hips, and closed his eyes as Harry's warm arms wrapped around his naked body, pulling him to himself and spent a few seconds with his eyes closed, listening to Draco's heartbeat. The blond smiled, stroking Harry's incredibly soft hair. Draco had come twice that night. The first time, Harry had made him sit on his lap, his back to him, and fucked him with his fingers while he spoke what Draco thought were dirty words in <em>parseltongue</em> in his ear. Draco didn’t understand it at all, but he had never been so turned on with Harry speaking in his ear as at that moment.</p><p> </p><p>Then, taking advantage of the fact that Draco was stretched and slick, Harry made him ride his cock until he came again, shivering and screaming. Only then did he ask Draco to suck him until he finally had his turn. Who would Draco be to deny it to him?</p><p> </p><p>Now that he was feeling really good in that embrace, Draco realised that it was a wonderful moment to find out what Harry had done to be celebrated. Well, it had been easier than he'd expected.</p><p> </p><p>"Hey, could we change our dates to Saturday?" Harry asked, moving his face just to look at Draco’s eyes.</p><p> </p><p>"But why?" Draco asked, somewhat confused. "Everybody's there on Friday.”</p><p> </p><p>“I know. But I talked to the others and all, and they said it was fine. I mean, next month I'm going to start training at St. Mungo's and it's going to be a very tight schedule, you know? They said that the first year of the Healer training is the worst. Being a Mediwizard is easier, but... You know...” He smiled, and Draco looked at that crooked little tooth before turning his eyes to the man’s eyes.</p><p> </p><p>He had passed the tests to St. Mungo’s Healer training. Merlin, how had he achieved this when he was so bad at potions?</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Healer.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Woa, good. Draco was speechless for a moment. But, well, they weren’t boyfriends. It wasn’t his obligation to have attended any party with Potter and his friends, after all. “It's all right. If my friends don’t mind...”</p><p> </p><p>"I talked to Pansy and Ginny talked to Blaise. It's okay with them,” Harry smirked. “They were at the party. Last week.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh,” Draco rose from his lap, a little awkwardly. He felt his cheeks warm and hoped that the faint light of the candles he had conjured wasn’t enough to show how embarrassed he was. He began to look for his clothes on the floor and dress them. "Well, all right then. See you next Saturday?”</p><p> </p><p>“If you can,” Harry said, and Draco thought his voice sounded a little dry. “Why don’t you stay here?"</p><p> </p><p>“I'm tired. And I drank too much,” Draco laughed as he buttoned his trousers and pulled on his shirt. “I'm going home to sleep.”</p><p> </p><p>"You can sleep here," Potter insisted.</p><p> </p><p>“I like my bed.”</p><p> </p><p>Potter didn’t say anything. In fact, he also stood up, put on his own clothes and approached Draco, kissing him on the cheek without looking into his eyes.</p><p> </p><p>“See you next week, then.”</p><p> </p><p>Draco couldn’t sleep that night. He was already getting frustrated with this whole situation. Potter looked happy and satisfied in one moment, and then he looked cold, as if he hadn’t come enough. It made Draco wonder what the hell was going on between them. Maybe it was stress on Harry’s part. He knew that, in order to get into healer training, he had to do a complicated three-step test. He was probably still stressed about it. Draco hugged his pillow, thinking he was lucky he didn’t need to work.</p><p> </p><p>He knew Potter had a considerable fortune. He thought of why Potter needed to work, but he didn’t spend much time thinking about it. If Potter wanted to ruin his youth in a hospital, it was not his business.</p><p> </p><p>He didn’t care at all.</p><p> </p><p>Potter's weekly meetings went back to what they were. At least Draco thought so. They met, now on Saturday, laughed, talked, drank, went to Potter's house - he had had a little panic attack when Draco mentioned visiting the Manor - they had sex and Draco went home.</p><p> </p><p>On February 14, however, something changed. Draco didn’t really think about the consequence of his actions that day. The meeting on Saturday had been canceled because most of his friends wanted to go out with their respective boyfriends and girlfriends, and singles ones did what they wanted. Draco didn’t really like Valentine's Day, but the romantic aura of the day made him decide to go out at night. He went to the pub, drank some pints, and met a boy who had light brown hair, almost blond. Draco decided he would go home with him. Almost half past midnight, when Draco was already half drunk and sitting more on his evening date than the bench, Potter appeared.</p><p> </p><p>Draco's first thought was that he was delicious. Those jeans were tight in the places, and Draco loved that black zippered leather jacket. The dark-haired man smiled when he saw him, but his smile died when he saw the boy Draco was with.</p><p> </p><p>Potter came closer, looking unsure, and Draco greeted him.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, Potter! Were you abandoned today as well?” He asked, and Potter looked confused.</p><p> </p><p>"I thought Saturday was our day," He said in a low tune, and Draco frowned.</p><p> </p><p>"But wasn’t it canceled?"</p><p> </p><p>“I meant... Well, I thought you were...”</p><p> </p><p>"Oh, you thought I was going to be with you?" Draco seemed to understand and muttered an apology. "Gods, I'm sorry. I should have warned you. Now I am with... hm...”</p><p> </p><p>“Ivan,” The boy answered, and Draco snorted.</p><p> </p><p>“Ivan,” He said to Potter. "I'll send you a gift box of chocolates, okay?" Draco teased and lifted a hand to touch the man's face, but Potter looked hurt.</p><p> </p><p>“Nevermind,” He licked his lips, and Draco wanted to kiss him. Maybe he would kiss him. “Listen... Can I talk to you?”</p><p> </p><p>“Hm? Yeah, spill it out,” Draco tilted the drink in his hand, drinking the rest of its content with three large sips, then blinking at Potter.</p><p> </p><p>Harry put his hands in his pockets and stared at the floor for a few seconds before pressing his lips together.</p><p> </p><p>“I want to stop,” He said simply, and Draco frowned.</p><p> </p><p>“Stop what?”</p><p> </p><p>"Our meetings, Malfoy. It’s over. Let's just keep meeting with everyone else, shall we?” He said, and Draco looked confused.</p><p> </p><p>"You mean... No sex?" And then he laughed, a little nervous, shaking his head. "Potter, you're going to die without sex."</p><p> </p><p>"I didn’t say I'm not going to have sex. I said I won’t have it with you.”</p><p> </p><p>Potter's words hurt as if they were a direct punch in his nose, but Draco smiled, shrugging.</p><p> </p><p>"Well, if that's what you want..."</p><p> </p><p>"It's not what I want. But that's what I need. I won’t have time to play games anymore, Malfoy,” He sounded angry, and Draco nodded.</p><p> </p><p>"You're going to be a healer. Yes, of course. No time to fuck. Well, I hope you enjoy your time. I will certainly enjoy it today,” Draco said. His eyes sting, but it must have been the smoke. Of course, it had been the smoke.</p><p> </p><p>“Hope so,” Potter tapped on his shoulder and turned to leave. Draco wanted to ask him to stay. He wanted to turn around and tell Ivan that he had other plans. He wanted to at least feel the fabric of that jacket in his hand again. Something told him that this would be the last time he would be able to feel it.</p><p> </p><p>“Potter!” He cried, in an act of courage. Harry turned, his green eyes shining with some emotion that Draco couldn’t understand. “I'm gonna miss your prick!”</p><p> </p><p>Potter laughed. From that distance, Draco couldn’t see his crooked little tooth. Potter turned again and walked away.</p><p> </p><p>Draco wanted to die.</p><p> </p><p>||<em>You can run free, I won't hold it against ya</em><br/> <em>You do your thing, never wanted a future</em><br/><em> Fuck if I knew how to put it romantic</em><br/><em> Speaking my truth, there's no need to panic</em>||</p><p>

</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t hurting. Not at all. Draco was at his table with the other Slytherins, his best shoes on his feet, a drink in his hand and a plate of horrible chips in the middle of the table. He stared at the table across the bar, watching <em>him</em>. Potter looked happy. He looked so happy that Draco wanted to get his pint bottle throw it at him. How could he be smiling like that when Draco felt miserable?</p><p> </p><p>"Soon Potter will choke on an olive if you don’t stop looking at him like that," He heard Theodore's voice, distant, and rolled his eyes, drinking from his bottle.</p><p> </p><p>"Maybe he'll stop being an arsehole after a near-death experience," That was his answer. Draco grabbed a handful of those awful chips and stuffed his mouth, chewing aggressively. Blaise, damn traitor, was at the other table with his tongue inside Weaselette's throat. Draco wanted to kill them all.</p><p> </p><p>"Wow, you need sex. I never thought I'd tell you this, but after Potter decided that he didn’t want your skinny arse, you are horrible,” Pansy said, and Draco threw his chips on her, and she screamed in disgust.</p><p> </p><p>“I just don’t understand! He said he didn’t have time, but he's been drinking like a bastard. On a Saturday!” Draco complained, placing his bottle on the table. “Fucking liar.”</p><p> </p><p>"Well, you couldn’t expect him to play games with you forever, could you?" Theo asked, raising an eyebrow. "Not everyone wants to just have fun.”</p><p> </p><p>"I don’t know anyone who would prefer a household life if they could choose something else,” Draco said, and Pansy pointed at the other table with a chip before she shoved it into her mouth.</p><p> </p><p>"A bunch of Gryffindors and a traitor, same shit,” He grunted, turning his face to Harry again. Well, he'd never asked for a relationship. Really, Draco didn’t have any reason to be so upset.</p><p> </p><p>“Come on, I'm tired you moping around,” Pansy held him by his wrist. "Let's go clubbing and dancing until we pass out. Theo, pay the bill. Draco will drink until Potter is detoxified from his system.”</p><p> </p><p>Draco laughed. As he left, his eyes met Potter's, and perhaps there was sadness in his look. But if he had really seen it, well... He didn’t remember very well. After that night, he never remembered very well.</p><p> </p><p>|| <em>Pretty boys, they didn't teach me things I didn't know</em><br/> <em>They don't have the thing that I need, but they don't know they don't</em><br/><em> You got that old thing about ya, and I can't hide my feels</em><br/><em> Pretty girls, they always die out, need another sex appeal</em><br/><em> I said come on, zero fucks about it</em><br/><em> Come on, I know I'm gonna get hurt</em><br/><em> Come on, zero fucks about it</em><br/><em> Come on</em><br/><em> Keep playing my heartstrings faster and faster</em><br/><em> You can be just what I want, my true disaster</em> ||</p><p> </p><p>

  <b>September 2004</b>
</p><p> </p><p>The painting of the ceiling was fading. Draco was dying to get his wand, which was somewhere on top of his folded clothes, and peel it. He felt his partner's breath on his neck, and his own body moving in the rhythm of the body on top of his. Draco had his legs spread open, his feet on the bed, concentrating on the paint so he wouldn’t think about the light burn between his legs. Gods, that was horrible.</p><p> </p><p>"You know, you can touch my cock. It won’t fall,” Draco said, and the guy on top of him lifted his head. His eyes were a beautiful shade of green when Draco asked him out, but now they looked like an odious mossy tone. Maybe he sobered up enough to notice that.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, ok,” What’s-his-name nodded, breathing heavily. Draco rolled his eyes, then closed them to see if he'd forget the paint peeling off the ceiling. The movements returned, along with a hand that now moved up and down his half-hard prick.</p><p> </p><p>Draco bit his lower lip, concentrating. Big, warm hands were moving all over him, and they touched him as if they had been made for it.</p><p> </p><p>"Come on, kitty," a voice said in his ear. It was hoarse, and at the same time, controlling and gentle. "You're so beautiful when you come... Come for me."</p><p> </p><p>Draco opened his lips, letting out a low moan. The phantom sensation that those memories caused him slowly brought him to an orgasm. His body twitched slightly, a weak moan dying on his lips, and he soon felt the other man's body trembling on top of him. He pushed him away, wincing as their bodies parted.</p><p> </p><p>"Are you sure these Muggle things really work?" The man asked, pulling on the rubber that protected his cock.</p><p> </p><p>“Of course it works,” It was Draco's answer. In a few seconds, he was already dressed and apparating home. When he reappeared in his room, he felt sick. He was definitely still under the influence of alcohol, but not enough. He left his room, going to the cellar and grabbing a bottle of wine.</p><p> </p><p>As he was walking back to his rooms, his eyes fixed on an edition of the Daily Prophet. Harry Potter was on the front page, which was strange because it had been some time since he had appeared in the paper. It wasn’t the main subject, however, only a small note in the left corner, indicating that the report was in the Daily Life area of the newspaper. Draco picked it up, reading the headline.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> <b>Boy Who Survived Twice starts second semester in St Mungo’s with high marks!</b> </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Draco smiled with his lips tight, watching Harry's smiling face in the small image. They hadn’t talked to each other in months. After the first strange and uncomfortable attempts, they ended up moving away. There was no official request, of course. It happened. It just happened.</p><p> </p><p>Draco felt his eyes burn and swallowed hard. He set the bottle of wine on the table, looking for the report in the newspaper. When he found it, he carefully tore out the photo that illustrated the material. When he had the picture in his hands, he wiped his wet cheek, grabbed the bottle once again, and, after putting the picture in a safe place, drank it until he forgot that he had seen that image in the first place.</p><p> </p><p>|| <em>I, I'm not the prettiest you've ever seen</em><br/> But I have my moments, I have my moments<br/> Not the flawless one, I've never been<br/> But I have my moments, I have my moments<br/> I can get a little drunk, I get into all the drugs<br/> But on good days, I am charming as fuck ||</p><p> </p><p>

</p><p> </p><p>“Draco!” He heard Pansy's exasperated voice screaming, but he didn’t care. His bare feet moved over the Buffet table, avoiding the food plates as he rocked in the rhythm of the loud music that played. He could hear Blaise's laughter somewhere, but his mind was in a delicious limbo. In his head he had Ginevra Weasley’s veil – or would it be Zabini, now? – and it gave him an air of purity together with his expensive white robes.</p><p> </p><p>“Leave him be, Pans! Look how happy he is,” Blaise said, and Draco laughed at him, holding the sides of the veil and spinning, his hips moving to the rhythm of the song.</p><p> </p><p>"You," Draco said, opening his eyes, still dancing as he looked at Blaise. “are an idiot! But at least you’re going to have sex every day! Every. <em>Fucking. <b>Day</b></em>!” Blaise laughed, and Draco heard Ginevra's laughter somewhere alongside him. He looked around and was surprised to see that she was up there too. "You're a beautiful bride. Even though you are ginger and freckled.”</p><p> </p><p>"Thank you, Malfoy. You're a beautiful bride. Even though you are barefoot and drunk,” She answered, and he laughed, taking her by the hands and pulling her to dance with him.</p><p> </p><p>He laughed, his mind a mess. Deep inside him, though, he wondered if the guy he'd found sticking his tongue into Harry Potter's mouth sucked cock as well as he himself did.</p><p> </p><p>Draco hoped not.</p><p> </p><p>||<em> Denying</em><br/> Saying 'Time will heal'<br/> Keep lying<br/> To make me feel<br/> I'm OK</p><p><em>So you believe</em><br/> I'd forget you<br/> Seriously?</p><p>

</p><p> </p><p>Draco was alone in the Fairy Finger. He was staring blankly at the glass in his hand. It was late. He wondered when Pansy would walk through the doors and pull him by the ears. He wiped his cheeks, a tear falling into the drink and making little waves.</p><p> </p><p>It had been a year. <em>Merlin!</em>, an entire year in which he was feeling utterly miserable. It had been almost two years since the first kiss.</p><p> </p><p>Draco licked his dry lips, slipping a hand into the back pocket of his trousers and picking up a pack of pills. It was just muscle relaxant. It wasn’t a problem, was it? He was tense and needed it. Draco pushed the plastic over the tablets, putting three in his palm. On second thought, he added another. Granger had assured him they were good and only took a little longer to take effect because they were weaker than a potion.</p><p> </p><p>Well, he didn’t need a prescription for those. And Merlin protected him from having to pass anywhere near St. Mungo's. He stuffed the pills into his mouth and swallowed with the help of the drink, grimacing and shoving the remaining carton back into his pocket.</p><p> </p><p>He waited a few minutes while circling his thumb over the top of the glass. He noticed when a handsome red-haired boy sat next to him, but he wasn’t really paying attention. It all seemed kind of in slow motion. He smiled, though, because he wanted to be polite.</p><p> </p><p>The world died out for a few seconds, and when it returned, Draco was looking at Pansy. He was in a very light place. Hm... It looked like her new flat.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, Pans,” He said huskily, and she let out a strangled cry. He watched as she lifted the carton with the pills, swinging them in front of his face.</p><p> </p><p>"How many of these did you take?" It was a question, but it felt like a stab. His head was hurting so much and he vaguely noticed that her eyes were red.</p><p> </p><p>"Two, three... I don’t know, Pans. It's just muscle relaxant,” He said, shaking a dismissive hand.</p><p> </p><p>"You passed out for almost 24 hours, you idiot!" She yelled at him, tossing the pills on the floor. "If I have you exaggerating on these things again, I will put you in a Center, Draco Malfoy!" Pansy threatened. "And get up. Theo is coming to dinner and you're going to help me do it.”</p><p> </p><p>Draco yawned, turning on the couch to escape the light from the windows. He massaged his temple. 24 hours, huh? If he took six of these, would he sleep for two days?</p><p> </p><p>|| <em>Baby, listen please</em><br/> I'm not on drugs, I'm not on drugs,<br/> I'm just in love (Oh)</p><p><em>Baby, don't you see?</em><br/> I'm not on drugs, I'm not on drugs,<br/> I'm just in love</p><p><em>You're high enough for me.</em>||</p><p>

</p><p> </p><p>Draco buttoned his shirt, but left the top two buttons open. He moved away from the mirror to get an overview of his body, liking what he saw. He smiled to himself, but the smile disappeared quickly. Draco touched his cheeks, realizing how thin he looked. A few years ago, he had pink cheeks and flesh enough to hide his angular bones, but now the lines of his face were sharp, and his eyes deep, with dark circles around it. He bit his lower lip then let out a sigh, putting on perfume and getting his wand. He wasn’t as handsome as he was before, big deal. He was still rich, and there was an idiot on his feet every night.</p><p> </p><p>Pansy had said the day before that Draco needed to calm down. Well, he had no reason for that, had he? She was just saying that because she now had a string ring around her ring finger and was probably being licked by Lovegood every day. <em>Merlin</em>. She kept saying that he was going to die alone and that soon he would be the only bachelor in the group. And it was true. Theodore had been hanging around the Greengrass sisters for some time, and he didn’t even want to think about Blaise. The son of a bitch was already breeding. Not that he could blame him. The fact that Ginevra looked like a miniature whale only proved they had sex, but that only made Zabini judge him constantly. He wasn’t even going to the club meetings anymore, only appearing in that damn pub.</p><p> </p><p>Draco had never gone to the Fairy Finger again. In fact, the last time he'd been there was on this very significant date the previous year. His drunken, stupid feet always drove him there.</p><p> </p><p>He walked over to his dresser, picking up some potion flasks from it. They were small, just the right measure that he needed of soothing potions. He took one, opening the lid and swallowing its contents. He had spent a few hours preparing them, and besides being strong enough, which was what he wanted, Draco had a proof that he was still good at it, even though it had been centuries since he had made any kind of potion. He picked up some other little flasks, put them in his pocket and left the room.</p><p> </p><p>He went down the stairs to the living room where his mother was sitting with a book in her hands.</p><p> </p><p>“Are you leaving?” She asked, raising her head, and he frowned.</p><p> </p><p>"Yes," Draco said simply. She had never questioned his nights out – sure, she had never seen him completely drunk, though they had had horrible fights when his excesses appeared in the papers. But there were so many of them that the Prophet no longer bothered to publish old news. In any case, she hardly saw him leave or arrive.</p><p> </p><p>"Draco, it is Wednesday. How about you stay at home today? The elves are going to make a marvellous dinner,” She said, setting the book aside and getting on her feet. Draco realised she was thinner as well. How had he not realised how her hands were bony? He used to look at Narcissa's hands all the time. He always loved the fact that his hands were the same as hers.</p><p> </p><p>"Mother, it's Valentine's Day. I won’t stay at home mopping around,” He said, rolling his eyes and waving his wand, but didn’t apparate as wished. He tried again, with the same result. He took a deep breath, the potion he'd just taken helping him to stay in control. “Mother. The wards.”</p><p> </p><p>"Draco, I cannot let you live like this,” She said, lifting a hand and touching him on the shoulder, making him jerk away. Narcissa looked extremely hurt by that attitude, and Draco felt his stomach ache. He used to be his mother's best friend, what the bloody hell had happened in the meantime?</p><p> </p><p>He had fallen in love, broken his heart and lost his mind. Somewhere in the middle, Draco had turned away from the person who had done everything to protect him. Guilt grabbed him by his inside, rustling his intestines and squeezing his heart so tightly he wanted to jump from the porch. His will was to break everything. Bloody hell!</p><p> </p><p>"I'm not a child anymore. I do what I want,” He said roughly, and Narcissa shook her head.</p><p> </p><p>"That's right, Draco. You're not a child anymore. You are a man of almost 26, who does not have a job, a boyfriend, a hobby, nothing! You have nothing but your drunkenness and its inconsequence! This will stop now, Draco Malfoy, even if I have to stop you by force!” She said, her face becoming stern, tears stuck in her red streamed eyes.</p><p>"And who's to blame?" He asked wickedly, feeling the anger rise to his head. Draco pulled the sleeve of his shirt up to his elbow, practically rubbing the dark mark on his mother's face. "Whose fault is it that I have this shite on my arm? Who's to blame, Mother?!”</p><p> </p><p>She narrowed her eyes, turning her face away from him, unable to see the mark on her son's arm.</p><p> </p><p>"Draco, I did what I could..."</p><p> </p><p>"You didn’t do enough," He spat, his words full of poison. "He still put it on my skin, didn’t he? He made me almost kill several people. He made me torture others. He made me sit in the same room as him and lick his fingers,” Draco laughed nervously. "I think I deserve to get out of this hell every now and then, don’t I?" And without waiting for any reply, he headed out the front door. He would walk the ten-minute walk to the gates and apparate from outside.</p><p> </p><p>Who the hell did she think she was to lock him at home like a spoiled child?</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Merlin!</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Two hours later, Draco was slowly moving his head to the beat of the song. His feet were bare – he didn’t know where his boots had gone – and he watched the couples around him. Celestina Warbeck was singing at the top of her lungs on the radio, the same song he remembered Potter singing on the karaoke all those years ago, which was off that day because of Valentine's Day. He had already taken two more vials of the potion, but he still felt nervous.</p><p> </p><p>"Are you still going to drink this?" The bartender asked, indicating the almost empty bottle beside the blonde.</p><p> </p><p>“Hm. Yes, I will,” Draco said, blankly, taking the bottle by the neck and drinking it all at once. The liquid trickled down his throat, and he didn’t even notice when he emptied it. He pushed the bottle from his face, frowning at it.</p><p> </p><p>He looked into the middle of the bar, where some couples danced. Couples... Well, he thought it was couples. His vision was blurry and he couldn’t quite tell what was happening.</p><p> </p><p>He rose from the bench where he was, stumbling towards the loo, feeling his head spin. He didn’t know very well how he arrived, but he soon opened one of the stalls, closing the door and trying to lock it, but with no success. He decided that he didn’t mind, and sat in the toilet, without lifting the lid. He lifted one leg and pushed it against the door to shut it.</p><p> </p><p>He hugged himself and let his pain go, his tears dripping and his face turning into the image of pain. He felt his lips tear, dry, but he couldn’t care less. Heavens, he'd never felt so much pain. That day was always the worst day of the year. It was the worst day of his life. Why hadn’t he simply done what his heart said and left with Harry? Why didn’t he grab the brunet's jacket when he could and said he wanted to leave with him?</p><p> </p><p>Painfully, Draco remembered his name all the time. Ivan. He wasn’t even good, he had bad jokes and the sex was so empty that Draco decided to leave before he even came. He had traded Harry for it, and because he ‘could’. Because he didn’t want Potter to think he was important to be with him on Valentine's Day. Valentine's Day was to be spent with who you loved. Draco didn’t love anyone.</p><p> </p><p>At least he tried to convince himself.</p><p> </p><p>It had been years ago, but the disappointment, guilt, and regret of his actions had never faded. Never. He leaned his head against the wall behind him, sobbing. Even his mother. Merlin, he was horrible. He had hurt her so much. What kind of son was he? What kind of son hurts so much a mother who sacrificed her own life for himself? She was right. He had nothing. He had no purpose, he had no future, he had no reason to be alive. He had absolutely <em>no</em> reason to be alive.</p><p> </p><p>"Why did you take me out of the fire, then?" He asked between sobs, into the void, without waiting for an answer.</p><p> </p><p>And without thinking, he took the four small vials in his front pocket and removed the lid of the four of them. He just wanted to stop it. Stop the world and sleep until the pain was over. He turned the potions in his mouth and swallowed it like water. His burned tongue didn’t even taste the strong potion that instantly doped him. The vials fell to the floor, breaking. His leg slipped from the door to the floor and the door opened slightly. He let his heavy body slip. Not that he could hold himself, of course.</p><p>That was the best feeling in the world. No sound, no pain, no heartache. Draco felt as if he were sinking into the Black Lake. It was cold, dark and soft... So soft, and he couldn’t breathe. If only that day he could have told Harry how much he was in love. How happy he was to see his smile, how much he loved his tender gestures and worried questions. If only Draco had accepted his hugs and affection when it was offered. If only he'd said he loved him.</p><p> </p><p>Everything was empty.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>[ Why don't you tell me, in your own words, why you did what you did?</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Was it the narcotics?]</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Draco felt his body move from side to side. He couldn’t open his eyes, but he could feel the movements.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>(Maybe.)</em>
</p><p> </p><p>They put him on something soft. Was it his bed?</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>[Were you unhappy?]</em>
</p><p> </p><p>There were screams. People talking loudly.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>(No.)</em>
</p><p> </p><p>A siren.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>[Was it him?]</em>
</p><p> </p><p>They put something on his face. He wanted to beat the person away, but his hand was stuck.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>(No.)</em>
</p><p> </p><p>There was a light over his eyes, and he tried to pull it away, but his body was so, so heavy...</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>[Well, then what was it?]</em>
</p><p> </p><p>He felt magic over him. More movement. Hands.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>(I don’t know what you mean.)</em>
</p><p> </p><p>His eyes opened a little. Light. A lot of light. He closed them again tightly. He felt his body lighten, more movement.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>[I know what's wrong with you.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>You're just... broken... inside.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>You never did anything right.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>You're fucked up.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Say it with me.]</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Draco managed to open his eyes slightly, and though it was all foggy, he could see a ceiling. Lights passed quickly through his line of sight. Someone was pushing him somewhere, in a hurry. A man. Draco could see the gleam of spectacle lenses in the light. He had beautiful dark hair. He felt himself falling into a park, so, so green...</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>(I'm broken.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I never did anything right.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I'm fucked up.)</em>
</p><p> </p><p>The man looked at him. The ceiling lights made him look like an angel falling from the sky. He said something, but Draco was lost in the worry so evident in that river of emeralds on his face. Was it possible that someone had emeralds instead of eyes? Draco was sure he did. He smiled. Maybe he was dead. That was it... He had died, and was in heaven, where Harry was an angel and would take him to a soft bed where they would sleep late, and Draco would wake up looking at his smile, and realise once again that he had a crooked, adorable tooth, and would count all the freckles on his nose, and touch his hair with his fingers, kiss all his scars and hug him against his chest. Harry loved to hear his heart, Draco knew. Harry always liked it. He closed his eyes and let himself be taken.</p><p> </p><p>Finally, he was dying.</p><p> </p><p>
