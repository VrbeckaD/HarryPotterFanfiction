    <p>
  <span>Summer after her first year was good but odd. She was on edge the entire time, waiting for curses that never came. She couldn’t talk to her parents about anything more important than the weather. They didn’t have the frame of reference to understand. This wasn’t just when they didn’t initially understand that she did like random strangers touching her hair but they listened to her and came to understand. They couldn’t understand the basics of the world she spent the last eight months in and they couldn’t engage. Whenever they looked like they might show an interest a blank look would spread over their faces. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She got four pieces of post from Hogwarts or people she knew from Hogwarts over the summer. Exam results in mid-July, placing her first in the year, new supply lists in mid-August, including a week of detention with Filch for cheating from Snape, and two notes from Potter in his meticulous careful writing that was still badly smudged, ‘Muggle summers suck’ and ‘My mail’s been redirected. None received this summer.’ both from a gorgeous snowy owl who waited in the big oak tree outside her window for a reply. She sent him two letters in response to the first. One condensing everything she could find out about the Dark Lord he supposedly defeated into a foot of parchment with contradictions highlighted, including information from texts she’d only seen in Slytherin common room and someone’s notes she’d found in the desk in her room, a dubious source but they’d highlighted the same inconsistencies as her. The second of suggestions to work round the increasingly complex wand movements required for charms from her own research into African wandless traditions and flitched rehabilitation texts off her parents. Not a loss though, she always kept copies of her correspondence, the first was just her own notes minus her suppositions and the research had been interesting for the second.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The first letter from Hogwarts is the only time she and her parents connect over the summer. They don’t understand the way Wizarding exams are marked but they understand McGonagall’s reluctant concession that she has, despite her propensity to fighting, achieved the highest score in her year. Their eyes skip over the comment about fighting, whatever control charm has been placed on them stopping them from objecting to anything about her education at Hogwarts. Hermione’s parents reward her with five new magical books, and their lack of understanding allows her to order them from places other than the Hogwart’s approved supplier </span>
  <em>
    <span>Flourish and Blotts</span>
  </em>
  <span>. She gets a book on Uagadou, a Wizarding school in Africa located very close to the orphanage in Kitgum she was adopted from, one on the wandless traditions from Central Africa with practical exercises, another on self-transfiguration, a beginners alchemy text, and a book of blood magic that would be illegal if it had been published in Britain or she’d bought it from a British shop she later discovers. British Wizarding law is full of delightful loopholes to let purebloods keep their dark objects and teach their children what they think mudbloods shouldn’t know, that a determined mudblood can exploit.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her parents take exactly five days of leave over the summer otherwise working and leaving her to her own devices in a sleepy village with nothing for a teen to do. Unlike her former classmates, she spends her summer studying  borderline illegal blood and wandless magic rather than discovering illegal drugs. They travel to France for their annual holiday and leave her to her own devices as much as they do at home. It was a happy week, she explored the Wizarding area of Nice while her parents sunbathed and tasted too wine. Her holiday money was changed to Wizarding money the first day there and she was so deep in magical areas no one could tell the difference between her casting and an adult Wizard. France is less restrictive of magic than Britain but more restrictive on Muggle interactions. Swings and roundabouts, she shrugged. The new books were nice, full of nasty spells for her trunk and room, and good practice for her French. She was distressed to discover it had lapsed severely while she was at Hogwarts and brought a subscription to the French National Wizarding newspaper to prevent it from relapsing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When she travelled to Diagon Alley alone, nominally with an older cousin but they separate at Victoria and she isn’t there when Hermione gets on the train back to Kent, something motivates her to bring and copy her version of the two letters she sent Potter. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The new book list was a disappointment; seven at best autobiographies, at worst works of complete fiction as well as the standard texts. If she hadn’t bought a trunk with a dedicated library section none of her self study texts would fit. The new DADA teacher is either a fan or the author, who is more of a narcissist than the works suggest, but at least they were available cheap from a second hand shop and her parents gave her money for all seven full price so she enjoys a fruitful expedition. Coming away with a book on the Animagi transformation, British Magical law, a small black text on the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Art of Mind Magic</span>
  </em>
  <span>, and more barely legal books of curses. If she’s going to survive the Snake Pit then she needs to be better or more brutal than everyone else. She missed the excitement of the Malfoy and Weasley families brawling in </span>
  <em>
    <span>Flourish and Blotts</span>
  </em>
  <span>. Hogwarts supply lists go out the second week of August traditionally, according to </span>
  <em>
    <span>Hogwarts: A History,</span>
  </em>
  <span> and her trip was planned before the lists came out. Whatever the new DADA professor required she would need to buy the standard course books not reuse books already in the family.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The Prophet documented their scuffle though, a big photo of Lockhart, who is that much of a narcissist, and a waif like Potter on the front page announcing Lockhart as their new DADA teacher, who at least isn’t possessed by a supposedly dead dark lord, and inside a delightfully spiteful article by Rita Skeeter and accompanying photo of Lucius Malfoy and the Wesley patriarch brawling like Muggles. She smiled cruelly when she first saw it; that should haunt Malfoy and kill Weasley’s patronising Muggle Protection Bill.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The rest of the holidays were a haze of reading and preparing, better to have notes before school starts, before sliding on to the train as it arrives and charming a carriage to be unnoticeable. The very late arrival of the Weasleys and Potter overrode her spells, the Weasley twins depositing their younger brother, sister and the boy hero with her. “You still to ‘Assist Potter’, Granger?” One of them asked, doing a scarily accurate impression of Professor Snape. She nods once scowling at him and he hexed her before they left. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She dodged the spell and waved off Potter’s apologies. Sitting back down and pulling out the two letters for Potter from her book bag. “You said your post was diverted.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He smiled which grew warmer as he saw the topic of the first letter. “Why were you writing to him you—” Weasley blustered before Potter interrupted.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“About Voldemort.” Potter replied having flicked to the second. “Thanks. McGonagall said you’d be sharing all my classes with me this year.” He seemed happy about that. Weasley grumped and the Weasley girl hadn’t stopped looking uncomfortable but she’d got a diary out from her bag and was writing, a ink bottle precariously perched next to her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Something about that diary wasn’t right, but that’s none of her business. More importantly she’s sat next to the littlest Weasley and that open ink bottle is far too close, Hermione thought casting a spell to prevent the ink from spilling.  Both of the Weasleys huff. “What you wanted to spill ink all over the carriage?” She asked before getting the book she had been reading back out.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Potter tried to make conversation but it’s made awkward by Weasley Minimus’s inability to talk to Potter or not go bright red when he interacts with her, Weasley Minor’s inability to say anything polite to Hermione and Hermione’s general unfamiliarity with conversations that don’t involve academics or her being cursed. Instead they fall into silence that felt strained. Weasley Minimus’s attention was caught by the Muggle journal she was writing in the entire eight hour journey. Even Hermione can’t read or write uninterrupted for that long. For the first couple of hours she, Potter and Weasley Minor tried to read: her a complicated treatise on self-transfiguration, Weasley a battered book on flying he defaced as he read and Potter her letters, but Potter kept trying to discreetly rub his scar. He may once have been capable of such things but now fine control of his arms requires care and concentration for them to do what he wants and even then he’s not always successful. She and Weasley Minor were very aware that Potter is in pain. Weasley Minor fretted and fidgeted for an hour longer than she expected before abruptly announcing he’s going to the toilet. Potter’s scar was an angry red from the pale pink it had been when he entered the carriage and she wondered if it would open and bleed like it did in DADA last year.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Weasley Minor came back with the senior Weasley at Hogwarts looking less concerned. Weasley Senior casted a number of spells she didn’t recognise, one of which obviously gave Potter some relief then checked his temperature, “You’ll go to see Madame Pomfrey tonight.” Weasley Senior said. Hermione made a mental note to look up healing in the Library.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m fine Perce.” Harry ducked away from Wesley Senior but blinked up at him oddly pleased looking.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Go see Madame Pomfrey or I won’t take you flying.” Weasley Senior replied, Potter looked like he wanted to smile. Looking at Hermione and Weasley Minor, Weasley Senior added, “Come get me if he gets any worse and make sure he gets to Madame Pomfrey.” They nodded and spent the rest of the trip quietly playing card games. Weasley Minimus never poked her head out of her diary but Potter didn’t worsen and Weasley Minor took responsibility for getting Potter from the Great Hall to Infirmary after the feast.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was only when she was sitting at her end of the Slytherin table that she had to encounter her Housemates properly. Notice-me-not charms are surprisingly effective when people would rather you didn’t exist but they can’t withstand actually sitting with her tormentors. Malfoy hissed, “Cheat” at her and tried to cast something sure to be unpleasant but he’s obvious and Greengrass grabbed his arm keeping it on the table, her nails leaving bloody crescents in his wrist.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How Malfoy?” She asked. “I used the same anti-cheating quills as you and I faced the same anti-Slytherin disadvantage as you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He spluttered, “Professor Snape said-”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How?” She interrupted asking again. Her voice was clear and loud enough to carry down the table if her Housemates chose to listen but not enough for the teachers to hear and intercede. “The bigot told the other bigot the only way a Muggle raised student could have done better than a Wizarding raised student was by cheating.” She paused to let him give her a reason other than their Head of House’s say so or to interject with something other than mudblood. “But he couldn’t offer any proof or plausible method or McGonagall wouldn’t have begrudgingly admitted I was top in our year. So either I’m smart enough to cheat so well that neither Snape nor McGonagall could catch me or you are so dumb a filthy Muggle could score better than you.” Malfoy spluttered to a halt and she could see various people eyeing her calculatingly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Malfoy remained silent, either seething or struggling to come up with a response until the last firstie was sorted and sat down too close to her. “Keep away from the filth.” He sneered. “That’s the mudblood Dumbledore forces on us. Treat it like the animal it is.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Muggle raised, Malfoy.” She corrected, her tone carefully bored. “I know the distinction is difficult for your small mind to grasp.” He opened his mouth and she casted a nasty variant of the stinging hex at him. Unlike Malfoy, she was subtle about casting and it was his howl of pain that drew their Head of House’s attention by which point her wand had disappeared back up her sleeve. “I believe this is a form of behaviour modification you are familiar with.” To the first year, loud enough to carry down their table to the professors, she said “I was adopted by Muggles just north of Buganda in 1981.” She saw some of her Housemates make the connection she hoped. It’s not enough yet but Muggle raised they can tolerate, Muggleborn they can’t. She doesn’t need to prove she isn’t a Muggleborn, just produce enough doubt and be good enough that it is easier to accept the possibility that she isn’t and keep their prejudices.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The meal, complete and the normal start of year announcements made - no extra forbidden areas of the castle but much preening from Lockhart - they toddled off to their Houses like good little students. Hermione was sure other Heads of House had different rules but Snape’s remained first and foremost don’t make me realise you exist. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Some of the more annoying new fourth years tried to start the year off with a rousing session of curse the mudblood but gave up when more of them were bleeding unconscious on the floor than standing. “Muggle raised” she corrected, enunciating carefully and not showing that their curses had affected her at all until she was safely back in her room and the door closed. All in all, a successful first evening she thinks and a good morning to look forward to with the bad night she had guaranteed Malfoy. The stinging hex variant was from a rather useful book on Good Housekeeping she’d picked up in France by Madame L. Malfoy for cultural context. Designed to punish children while leaving no trace, it creates a localised sting sensation, without the mark associated with a standard stinging hex, for one hour for each year of the child’s life at alternating severity with no counter and resistant to pain potions.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Snape cared not at all whether or when his House arrived for breakfast for all but one day of the year but on the first day of term, first through fifth year of his House were there first thing or in detention with Filch. He looked barely awake himself as he slashed his wand sending out the first and second year timetables to each student except for Hermione. Malfoy smirked, “ They finally realised you don’t belong here?” Dark circles and bloodshot eyes contrasted his wan skin but his face had lit up with malicious glee “Hurry on home, mudblood.” He was saying as Snape violently cast a more directed spell sending individual timetables to the third, fourth, and fifth years and Hermione.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Potter hadn’t been kidding. A quick glance at her timetable showed she had been placed with the Gryffindors for all classes whether or not Slytherin shared the class. On Snape’s way up to the Head table he hissed at her, “Assist Potter properly this year.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Attending all her classes with the Gryffindors as Potter’s assistant was odd. She wasn’t seated next to him for any classes except Potions and Herbology, where she cut his ingredients and stirred or demonstrated the technique Sprout wanted them to carry out. In Charms and Transfiguration she sat ignored at the back of the class and took careful notes during the lecturing aspect of their classes, which she copied for Potter, while Potter and Weasley sat at the front under Flitwick and McGonagall’s watchful gaze. If there was a casting element she cast it herself then spent the rest of the lesson working out what alterations, if any, Potter would need to be able to cast it. During that lesson Potter would attempt to cast as the class was instructed. Next lesson he would use her alterations commenting on what was possible for him to do and what worked, which would transfer to her notes. By the end of the second week she was making three copies, Potter shared with Weasley Minor whatever and sometimes his notes were insightful, she also grew to recognise Weasley Senior’s spiky handwriting.  All this extra work cut into her self study time and outside Slytherin House she was more likely to be found with her head in a book of wand movements, Arithmancy or Muggle Maths, which her parents had happily provided, than the greyer books of offensive magic that bothered her teachers in first year.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She’s not entirely sure why Potter bothered to attend History of Magic. It’s purely a lecture through which he can’t take notes fast enough or clearly enough to gain anything from and it’s Binns attendance is pointless anyway. If she wasn’t trying to avoid Snape remembering she existed, she’d skip, Binns has given the same lectures unchanged for fifty years and the same tests. At least Potter dedicates himself to reading the book and her notes during class. He and Weasley are surprisingly good at History when they ignore Binns and their contributions to her notes are extensive and useful. History is the class she pays least attention to intending to drop it after O.W.Ls and only aiming for an E.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She’s even less certain why any of them bother to attend Defense. After an impressively narcissistic first lesson and spectacularly bad second lesson where Lockhart proved himself incapable of handling Cornish Pixies, Defense had become a reenactment of Lockhart’s novels starring a reluctant Potter. The second lesson was notable for being the first time she and Weasley fell in either side of Potter, each trusting the other to protect their side. They’d fallen in to protect him before but neither had fully trusted the other and they had done less well as a result. Future lessons were notable for displaying just how uncomfortable Potter was with attention and how little truth was in Lockhart’s books.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The teachers were initially wary of her but by October they seemed to only realise she was not an oddly dressed Gryffindor when Gryffindor and Slytherin shared a class. They even began calling on her in class and giving points when she cast successfully first, well Gryffindor got points for her achievements but the spirit was there and it wasn’t as though she had some deeply ingrained House loyalty. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She was also away from her Housemates most of the time, assisting Potter or in detention with Filch for neglecting her duties whenever Snape noticed her existence and she wasn’t glued to Potter’s side, something she tried hard to avoid, so she was getting cursed less. Her summer studying has been productive, when her attackers were lower than fifth year she was leaving them more damaged than she was and they were finding out their Head of House was no happier to be reminded of their existence when they went to Madame Pomfrey. All but the most determined bigots like Malfoy were beginning to reevaluate her, she expected the better connected to African politics were checking if it was possible a Wizard born infant could have ended up in a Muggle orphanage in the time and location she had implied. When she, Potter and Weasley Minor got caught in one of the unused classrooms near Gryffindor tower for the fifth time, Weasley Senior spoke for her giving her access to the tower before curfew while they were studying. There were no strange mysteries endangering Potter, and as a result her, and the Headmaster seemed to have gotten over his weird obsession with Potter. Overall, her second year was shaping up to be far better than first, if this kept up.</span></p>
