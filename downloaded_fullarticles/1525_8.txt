    <p class="p1">Sirius, in a most unlike-Sirius fashion, had been packed for days. If Regulus hadn’t known better, he might have thought that his older brother hadn’t ever bothered to <em>unpack</em> once he’d returned home from his first year at Hogwarts earlier that summer, but he knew that Mother had forced him to. He’d seen the evidence.</p><p class="p1">But now, with mere hours to go before both sons of the House of Black would be boarding the Hogwarts Express, Regulus found he was overcome with nerves and hesitation. He was stood in the middle of his bedroom, school trunk open on the floor and almost empty, while the house-elf looked on with watery eyes.</p><p class="p1">“Master Regulus will be wanting plenty of socks, yes, in that draughty old castle. It is cold and damp in the Slytherin dungeons and Kreacher knows how Master Regulus dislikes being cold.”</p><p class="p1">“Thank you, Kreacher,” he said weakly, watching as the elf levitated neat piles of folded black socks out of his chest of drawers and into his trunk. It was cold in Gryffindor Tower too, he suspected, but he didn’t dare voice out loud the fear that he would follow in his brother’s footsteps and be Sorted <em>there</em>. Only Slytherin House would be acceptable for him after what Sirius had done.</p><p class="p1">“…And thick wool jumpers, too, and Kreacher has written Master Regulus’s name in each one. Kreacher knows that Master Regulus takes very good care of his clothes, but those <em>Hogwarts elves </em>are not as fastidious as Kreacher, no.”</p><p class="p1">The corner of Regulus’s mouth quirked up at Kreacher’s scowl. He had been fussing all summer about the <em>inferior nature </em>of the house-elves up at the school, worrying that they wouldn’t be able to warm Regulus’s bed the way that he liked, or iron his clothing properly, or cook his favourite meals. Even Sirius had (grudgingly) admitted that Kreacher’s cooking was far better than the school elves’, but he hadn’t had any other complaints so Regulus wasn’t too worried. He still wished he could take Kreacher with him, though; he would miss his wrinkled old friend.</p><p class="p1">He handed Kreacher his stack of newly-acquired textbooks — already with cracked spines and dog-eared pages, much to Mother’s annoyance; she complained that his peers would think they were second-hand but in reality Regulus just hadn’t been able to hold himself back from reading them — and the elf shrunk them and carefully tucked them away between starched white shirts and warm winter cloaks.</p><p class="p1">“Would Master Regulus like to take Hydrus with him to Hogwarts?”</p><p class="p1">Regulus snapped his head round to the stuffed dragon sitting atop his pillows at the head of his bed. The toy looked a little worse for wear with a torn ear, dangling eye and singed patch of fur that was a result of Sirius experimenting to try and make it breathe real fire. He would like very much to take Hydrus to Hogwarts; his stuffed dragon was the only thing that had helped him to sleep this long year that Sirius had left him alone at home. But would the other children have stuffed toys with them?</p><p class="p1">Sirius hadn’t taken Tufty. He had tried but Mother had taken it out of his trunk at the very last moment and they had argued about it all morning, ruining everything. Regulus knew that Kreacher would hide Hydrus for him if he really wanted to take it. Maybe he should. Just in case. He could leave it in his trunk if it turned out that none of the other children had stuffed toys with them, or maybe hide it under his sheets so no one else could see.</p><p class="p1">Regulus nodded. “Just in case.”</p><p class="p1">“Kreacher will pack Hydrus in the morning. Master Regulus should go to sleep now, it is getting very late.”</p><p class="p1">“Alright,” he agreed, attempting to stifle a yawn. It <em>had </em>been dark for hours. “Thank you, Kreacher.”</p><p class="p1">He lay down on the bed and Kreacher patted him on the head. “Goodnight, Master Regulus,” he said, his croaky voice wavering. Regulus felt rather emotional too as he realised that this would be the last time that Kreacher would wish him goodnight for <em>months</em>.</p><p class="p1">“Goodnight Kreacher,” he said tightly, turning his back to the elf so he might not see the tears forming in his eyes. It was only when Regulus heard the telltale <em>crack! </em>that signified Kreacher’s disappearance that he pulled the covers over his shoulders, curled into a ball, and hugged Hydrus to his chest as he silently wept.</p><p class="p1">The darkness outside had almost lifted by the time Regulus had finally drifted into a restless sleep, and he felt groggy and heavy-headed when Kreacher awoke him the following morning. He sat up and yawned widely, rubbing at his groggy eyes as the house-elf pulled back the heavy green velvet curtains at his window and let the morning sunlight flood his bedroom. It looked to be a bright, clear day: the kind of day that would normally have Sirius insisting that they go flying on their brooms or on Aunt Cassiopeia’s Granians. Not today, though, Regulus realised and flopped back onto his pillows with a groan.</p><p class="p1">Some time later, after Kreacher had managed to coax him out of bed and into the bathroom to wash and dress and make himself look presentable, Regulus was sat at the breakfast table with Mother and Father and Sirius.</p><p class="p1">There had been some bickering already because Sirius hadn’t tucked his shirt in or done all his buttons up and had somehow managed to crease it in the short journey from his bedroom to the dining room. Regulus, of course, had kept his shirt immaculate but Mother hadn’t appeared to notice.</p><p class="p1">Sirius had griped that the eggs were poached and not scrambled but Regulus was happy about that because poached eggs were his favourite — he hadn’t quite realised that Kreacher knew that and had cooked them for that very reason. Kreacher had wanted his favourite little Master to head off on his first trip to school with the memory of excellent eggs fresh in his mind because Salazar knew the Hogwarts elves wouldn’t be able to poach eggs to his exacting standards.</p><p class="p1">Father spent the meal hidden behind his newspaper, as always, sipping at a black coffee that was laced with Firewhisky. Regulus would be surprised if he noticed that both his sons were missing at breakfast the following morning. Mother alternated between scowling at her grapefruit and scowling at Sirius. Sirius seemed unaware of her gaze and was concentrating on scoffing his food at an alarming rate, head bent over the plate and knee jiggling underneath the table, despite his earlier complaints about the eggs.</p><p class="p1">Regulus, for his part, tried to enjoy a rare (mostly) peaceful breakfast and hoped that his stomach would settle enough for him to be able to keep his food down on the long train journey north.</p><p class="p1">For Sirius, time seemed to move at a glacial pace that morning. But all too soon Regulus found himself standing in front of the fireplace for a last minute inspection from Mother. His appearance was deemed acceptable, but he had to wait for Sirius to tie his shoelaces and straighten his robes and comb his hair before they could leave.</p><p class="p1">Father had retired to his study without so much as a farewell.</p><p class="p1">Mother went through the Floo with Sirius, presumably because she thought he might flee the second he was out of her sight. Kreacher took Regulus, and he squeezed the elf’s wrinkled hand as the world whirled around him and was grateful that Mother was too preoccupied to notice him stumble as they exited into the wizarding waiting room at King’s Cross.</p><p class="p1">The station was busy. Regulus was sure he had never seen so many people in one place in his life; certainly not so many <em>muggles</em>. He tried not to stare. Sirius received a clip around the ear but fortunately the waiting room was just a few steps away from the barrier between platforms nine and ten and soon enough they were through to the other side, away from those muggles. Well, most of those muggles. Sirius had said that some of the students in his year had muggles for <em>parents</em>. Mudbloods. Regulus was rather nervous about this and hoped he wouldn’t have to speak to any.</p><p class="p1">Platform nine-and-three-quarters was, if possible, even busier than the muggle part of the train station. Regulus felt hemmed in at all sides as children yelled at each other and ran about all over the place as if they had never been taught their manners. Their parents weren’t much better, rushing backwards and forwards with trunks and cages and shouting at their offspring to hurry up onto the train.</p><p class="p1">Mother had found Aunt Druella — who was here to drop off Cissa, the last of Regulus’s first cousins remaining at Hogwarts — and Sirius had made the most of her distraction to abandon his brother in favour of his new <em>friends</em>. Doubtless that gormless-looking bespectacled boy with unruly hair was that <em>Potter </em>Sirius hadn’t been able to shut up about all summer. Regulus crept ever closer to Kreacher’s side until Mother had chided him and told him to board the train with his head held high like a Proper Black.</p><p class="p1">He had obeyed, disheartened that he had ever bothered to hope that she might send him off with a pleasant word or even a kiss on the cheek. But Kreacher squeezed his wrist and sniffed, and that was almost as good.</p><p class="p1">The narrow corridors of the Hogwarts Express was filled with boisterous boys <em>and </em>just-as-boisterous girls jostling and pushing and knocking him as they darted past, shrieking with laughter as they were reunited with old friends or leaning out of the windows to gawp and wave at their parents.</p><p class="p1">Regulus had felt utterly lost until Cissa had poked her head out of a compartment door and ushered him inside. But this, too, felt claustrophobic. He was sat opposite her boyfriend (the Malfoy boy; soon to be her fiancé if Aunt Druella was to be believed) with their knees almost touching because he was taking up an inordinate amount of space. Regulus felt quite small in comparison. Alright, maybe he <em>was</em> small. And he felt like he was getting smaller and smaller as the journey went on, wedged between his cousin-by-marriage Evan and the compartment wall.</p><p class="p1">He was mostly silent as the train rumbled on and spent his time half-listening to the older students’ conversations about Professor Dumbledore’s shortcomings and who they thought the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher might be and who had gotten engaged over the summer and who might be getting an apprenticeship next summer. They had said the word <em>apprenticeship </em>in rather odd voices but Regulus was too busy trying not to be sick to pay as much attention as he might have done under normal circumstances.</p><p class="p1">He was worried about the Sorting (he <em>had </em>to be in Slytherin), about his classes (he <em>had </em>to do better than Sirius), about making friends (just one, please), about hiding his homesickness and missing Kreacher and Mother and even Father. Evan was a first year too, but he didn’t seem particularly nervous about anything. He had even made one of Cissa’s friends laugh. Regulus wasn’t sure if he had ever made anyone laugh.</p><p class="p1">Things didn’t improve when the Hogwarts Express had reached its destination. He had abandoned his trunk and his owl (Malfoy, a Prefect, had assured him that they would be safely escorted to the Castle and waiting for him in the Slytherin dormitory) and found himself crammed into an impossibly small boat with Evan and two other boys. He had met an enormous hairy man and he was sure that if Mother knew this half-breed was in charge of escorting the students across the Lake she would be furious. He might tell her when he wrote home.</p><p class="p1">He survived the Lake crossing and a stern lecture from a strict witch who turned out to be the Gryffindor Head of House. Regulus supposed she had to be stern and strict if she had Sirius and his friends to contend with. He had met the Slytherin Head of House before at one of Aunt Druella’s summer parties and knew that he was a jovial, if slightly vacuous, sort of fellow.</p><p class="p1">And when he entered the Great Hall and saw its enchanted ceiling he forgot, for the first time in weeks, all his anxieties and worries about school.</p><p class="p1">He didn’t notice the four long wooden tables filled with students in dark robes, exactly like his but for the coloured linings and House crests, their faces lit only by the light of a thousand flickering candles and the enchanted stars above them. He didn’t notice his brother sat among the lions or his cousin with the serpents, two pairs of eyes searching for his among the crowd. He didn’t notice the row of professors at the far end of the Hall, with the muggle-loving Headmaster sitting tall in the middle of them in garish violet robes. He didn’t notice the ancient Sorting Hat, sat ready for them, or the floating House banners or the hourglasses waiting to be filled with glittering gems.</p><p class="p1">All Regulus had eyes for was the inky black canopy above him, the perfect replica of the real sky outside, dotting with bright twinkling stars and a curved crescent moon and the faintest wisp of a cloud. He wondered what kind of power was needed for such an enchantment, whether it had been (or could be) replicated anywhere else, what it looked like when there was inclement weather — would it look like raindrops splashing against glass, or would it actually rain inside and perhaps evaporate before it could fall on their heads?</p><p class="p1">A jostling at his side interrupted Regulus’s thoughts and for the first time he looked down and around him. He joined the queue of first years now lining up in front of the professors’ table, some looking rather excitable. The blonde girl to his right was almost quivering with anticipation. Others looked nervous, Regulus among them. He attempted to conceal his emotions as best he could, just like Father did. He tugged at his collar. It had to be Slytherin; there could be no other house. Not for him. Not after Sirius.</p><p class="p1">An Abbott, a Bagnold, a Belby and a Bell were sorted before him. Two Hufflepuffs and two Gryffindors. And when Regulus took his place on that old wooden stool and felt the old leather Hat placed rather unceremoniously on his head and when the Hat began to speak, muttering how he had the head of a serpent but the soul of an eagle and the heart of a lion he gripped the edge of the stool, his knuckles turning white, as he desperately tried not to shout out <em>Slytherin, it can only be Slytherin! </em>for all the school to hear.</p><p class="p1">The Hat must have understood, because it bellowed out <em>SLYTHERIN! </em>and such relief poured through his veins as he lifted it from his head with shaking hands and placed it back on the stool behind him. The Slytherin table felt very far away.</p><p class="p1">He looked across the hall to the table draped in red and gold without really realising it, searching for his brother. Sirius was concentrating very hard on staring at his empty plate. Regulus could see his fists clenched tightly on the tabletop. His foot was probably tapping on the stone floor underneath the table the way it always did when he was annoyed or anxious and trying desperately not to lash out. Sirius always seemed to be trying not to lash out these days. And there was Potter, whispering something to his brother while another boy filled a goblet with water and pushed it towards him.</p><p class="p1">Regulus sighed. He hoped Sirius would understand.</p><p class="p1">He had done it for him, after all. If Regulus was housed with the serpents then maybe Mother wouldn’t mind so much that Sirius was with the lions. Maybe she wouldn’t get so angry and maybe she wouldn’t shout and maybe she’d stop throwing things. If Regulus did everything that she wanted, if he played the part of the perfect pureblood son, the perfect Black son, then maybe she would leave his brother alone.</p><p class="p1">With a deep breath, he tore his eyes from the Gryffindor table and looked to the Slytherins. Cissa’s long white-blonde hair stood out immediately. She was beckoning him over, smiling indulgently, and he forced his feet to carry him to his favourite cousin even though it felt like he was wading through thick sludge.</p><p class="p1">She had saved a space for him beside her on the bench, and despite thinking he was probably supposed to sit at the end of the table and wait for the other newly-sorted first years he sat beside her anyway.</p><p class="p1">“Well <em>done</em>, Reggie!” she whispered over the applause as the girl who had followed him to the Sorting Hat was sent to Hufflepuff. “We’re all <em>so </em>proud of you! You must write to your mother as soon as you get to your dormitory. She will be delighted!”</p><p class="p1">And Cissa kissed him on the side of his head and he probably should have pushed her away or looked disgruntled at her babying him in front of his new housemates but it felt nice, and comforting, and almost like someone was looking out for him. Almost like someone <em>cared </em>about him.</p><p class="p1">All too quickly the Sorting Ceremony was over and the Hall descended into chaos. Food appeared in front of them to shrieks of delight from some students — half-bloods and mudbloods, no doubt — and he had to endure Cissa’s fussing over his selections (he just wanted a bowl of mashed potato and gravy but that wasn’t <em>appropriate</em>) and the thundering chatter around him. Elbows and knees knocked into him as he tried to eat as sedately and politely as he had been brought up to do, but the sombre dining room at Grimmauld Place was about as far away from the cacophonous Great Hall as the twinkling star he was named for.</p><p class="p1">Then, to top it all off, he had to suffer the indignity of sharing a bedroom and a bathroom with <em>four </em>other boys. Even with the curtains drawn tightly around his bed and privacy charms erected he felt exposed and surrounded on all sides. He could hear Evan’s laughter as he chatted away merrily to the other boys (Rowle was alright, he supposed, but he’d never heard of Higgs or Dunbar and what if they were mudbloods? what would Mother say?) and he could hear horrible wet squelchy sounds as <em>things </em>that lived in the Great Lake slapped against the dormitory windows. It was cold and it was damp and whichever house-elf had put the warming pan in his bed hadn’t done a very good job because his sheets were tepid at best and Kreacher had been right, the Hogwarts elves were <em>rubbish</em>. He pulled on a third pair of those thick woollen socks his house-elf had packed and huddled with Hydrus beneath the bedcovers that didn’t smell anything at all like home.</p><p class="p1">Regulus longed for peace and quiet and solitude. He felt desperately indignant that no one had thought to warn him that Hogwarts Castle, despite its vastness, would be so full of other people.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p>
