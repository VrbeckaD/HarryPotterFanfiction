          <div class="userstuff"><p dir="ltr">The Great Hall was loud and chaotic, teaming with color and movement and life. It seemed like every being at Hogwarts was eating at the same time. The candles over head bobbed and the banners danced to the cacophony of noises - the clinking of utensils on plates, the thudding of cups on table tops, hundreds of shoes pounding the floor, and the white-noise thrumming of so many voices joking, laughing, talking. So much talking.</p><p>Even now, well into their 8th year, the energy in the Hall was thick with the adrenaline of a fresh start. A sense of victorious alleviation hung in the air so dense in was all but tangible.</p><p>They were alive. They were alive and free and the relief of it all continued to sink in more every day, like someone slowly loosening a knot from around their insides allowing for a deeper breath each new and bright morning.</p><p>Harry sat quietly neutral to all the noise and movement around him. Of course he was glad for the jovial, energetic sounds, grateful even. Yet lately he found himself unable to engage with it all, unable to revel in the victory the way his friends did. More and more he felt at odds and strangely detached from his surroundings. Nothing wrong per se, yet still not quite “right” inside. Restless legs with nowhere he had be. Restless mind with nothing he had to figure out. No one around him making demands of him. It was all a striking, disorienting change.</p><p>It was a cruel sort of irony too. He was the one who ended the war after all. He walked into that forest alone. He stood in front of Riddle by himself. Even as much as he hates to think about it, his death won the war. And sitting here surrounded by the life fought so hard for, the victory celebration seemed to allude him. He could not shake the incompleteness he felt growing in his chest. There was some kind of unfinished business he felt brewing. There was another battle looming in the distance of his mind, but to his great frustration he could not seem to work out exactly what it was he was even fighting against. Who wins, who loses, when you’re only battling with yourself?</p><p>He was only 11 years old when he found out his enemy's name. He found out he not only had an enemy but was in a war last time. The battle lines were drawn for him. He life was spelled out in so many ways that he was in a constant state of reacting rather than living.</p><p>Now he just continues to put one metaphorical foot in front of the other, hoping someday he will latch on to the peace and joy that he sees so many people experiencing. Most days it seems that he only feels the inner conflict growing. No clear enemy, no right side or wrong side, just unfinished, unsettled tangles snagging and pulling at his mind and heart. There's an internal tug of war - something fighting to be released and set free verses something urging him to maintain the status quo and stay in control. </p><p>He can hear his mind-healer's voice in his head encouraging him to “Stay present Harry. Don’t relive the past. Don’t forecast the future. Be present in the moment you have in front of you. Sit with unknown. The unknown is not your enemy anymore.”</p><p>He took a deep breath, trying to relax his insides and looking around for something to ground himself to the present. He casually crossed his arms in front of himself and leaned forward onto the table to rest his chin on his forearms.</p><p>His eyes scanned around to take in the whole room. He tried hard not to look over to the silver and green table <em>again</em>, but his eyes seemed unable to settle anywhere else these days. He knew very well where they always wanted to go. He felt that pull, that tug, in his gut. He felt his magic prickle, as if it were alerting him to something, drawing him across the room. He frowned in confusion and fought with himself for a minute before finally giving in.</p><p>Outwardly Harry tried to appear the picture of calm, relaxing with his friends after a good meal, but subconsciously his eyes narrowed and his brows furrowed in deep concentration as if there was a puzzle to work out on the Slytherin table.</p><p>"Harry? ... Harry!"</p><p>Harry jumped. "Yeah? Yeah. I'm listening." Of course it was Hermione that noticed. She always noticed. He figured it was his stillness that gave him away. That, and the fact that he had not stopped starring across the Hall for several minutes now. Hell, he'd hardly even blinked since he found his target.</p><p>Ron scoffed at this, "Mate. Juuust go talk to him already!" He grumbled and stuffed another roll into his mouth before turning to Hermione, "You know, I honestly thought the obsessing was over for a while there."</p><p>"Ron hush," she quickly waved off the other boy before softening her tone, "Harry...you can't take your eyes off him."</p><p>"What?!" Harry quickly sat straight up, mind scrambling. "That's not true! I'm - I'm just thinking.. about...quidditch." His finish to that statement was weak and he knew it.</p><p>"You're a shit liar mate. And you're a prat for lying in the first place. <em>And</em> a git for just sitting here." Ron stared Harry down, challenging him to respond. Finally he sighed, "You're allowed to want something for yourself, Mate. Go make it happen!"</p><p>"Harry, its just... we care about you," Hermione glanced at Ron before continuing, "And well, we know you have, you know... feelings. For him."</p><p>Where Ron was all confrontation and push, Hermione was a gentle hand, urging but supportive. Unfortunately Harry wanted nothing to do with either.</p><p>He felt both sides of his civil war rise up in his head. These moments of conflict were happening with increasing frequency. He had yet to find a way to get control over his wandering thoughts and it showed. His denial and panic made him increasingly edgy and defensive. It spiraled more and more every time he was confronted. </p><p>"Stop ok! Guys just, just stop. There are no "feelings" alright?? He's just - look I don't know ok? I don't know. We're friends. Friends. ...and its fine. I'm fine."</p><p>As soon as he heard his harsh tone he backed down, instantly apologetic. He knew he was lashing out and mentally kicked himself for pushing away the safest people in his life. But they kept bringing this up. Kept pushing him. Kept "helping."</p><p>"Well then,” Hermione pressed, “why do you know exactly who we're talking about?"</p><p>Hermione's question hung in the air. The silence was loud and Harry had no response so he just dropped his head down on to his crossed forearms with a disgruntled, exasperated noise. Ron and Hermione knew their friend so well that this non-verbal cue to end the conversation was registered loud and clear.</p><p>Ron and Hermione moved on talking quietly between themselves, and Harry's eyes drifted across the room to find their target again as if discontent to rest anywhere else but on that face. He released a subconscious sigh.</p><p>Professor McGonagall stood then, cleared her throat, and quieted the room. Harry didn't register her words, simply watched the other boy watch her. He couldn't bring himself to care about retaining the instructions that he knew Hermione would inevitably repeat to him on their way back to the common room. His gaze stayed fixated on the "just friend" friend across the room and his thoughts swirled in his head.</p><p>
  <em>He’s a friend. Just a friend. Why am I thinking about him all the bloody time now? </em>
</p><p>
  <em>And why does his hair have to just fall like that across his stupid forehead? If I could just brush my fingers through it, then I could really see his eyes. His eyes... </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Shit.</em>
</p><p>He blinked rapidly a few times and shook his head quickly back and forth as if he could shake the attraction out from his ears.</p><p><em>He licked his lips. His fucking lips. I just want to... </em> <em>How would they feel ...just stretched around and sucking and -</em></p><p>
  <em>Fucking hell.</em>
</p><p>He shifted restlessly in his chair.</p><p><em>And those long fingers. And his arms look so strong now. But oh</em> <em> god I could so easily pin those poshy slim wrists above his head, and god those broad shoulders...</em></p><p>
  <em>I am so fucked. I so want to- </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Fuuuck!</em>
</p><p><em>No. No I do not want Malfoy. I do not. I do not want to...see more of that collar bone that’s just poking out of his shirt there. </em> <em>I do like when he wears that blue shirt. </em></p><p><em>Oh, I could trail my tongue along his neck there and... </em> <em>Oh bloody hell.</em></p><p>He all but groaned out loud when the boy stretched his arms about his head, flexing his muscles a bit.</p><p>Malfoy's eyes easily found Harry across the room pinning him where he sat. And like magic, the entire room froze. The edges blurred away, the noises muffled down to silence, and all movements stopped. It was just Harry and the boy across the room.</p><p>Harry's breath caught in his throat. He didn't know if he was ashamed to be caught starting or relieved to find his gaze returned. He sat there transfixed, watching as Malfoy, almost in slow motion, intentionally turned away from the front of room and locked his whole attention onto Harry. Harry unconsciously picked his head off his arms.</p><p>Malfoy did not blink or shift. He was zeroed in on Harry, returning Harry's stare in kind, and letting Harry know that he had definitely felt the intense, lustful gaze. </p><p>Harry had never seen him look back at him like <em>that </em>before.</p><p>
  <em>Holy Shit. </em>
</p><p>Suddenly Harry couldn't breathe and there was a yank in Harry's gut - an invisible, magnetic, visceral draw pulling him towards Malfoy. It made his heart race. He knew he thought Malfoy was attractive, but this? <em>This? </em>This was something else.</p><p>This was burning and undeniable. This he felt in his core. This stopped him in his tracks. This was more than acknowledging his friend was good-looking. This was full on desire. Full on want.</p><p>
  <em>I want him.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Oh. ...oh gods.</em>
</p><p>Harry had no idea how to process this spiral of information. He had felt attraction before, he was sure of it, but he was also sure that no one had ever captivated him like this. No one had effected him in his bones like this. Not even close.</p><p>Dessert appeared in front of them breaking the spell before Harry had a chance to unravel his tangle of thoughts. It felt as if he was waking up from the fog of a too-long sleep. He was slightly dazed and more than slightly confused. All he knew in that moment was that he had to <em>go</em>. He had to think, to breathe. And he couldn't do that here. He couldn’t be in the same room, even this grand of a room, or any where near Draco Malfoy for a moment longer. Not until he figured this all out. Not until he got a fucking grip. </p><p>They're friendship was fragile and newly formed, but Harry treasured it. It was one type of victory that he actually could feel, and he couldn't bare the idea of losing it, of losing Draco.</p><p>Draco who surprised him over and over again.</p><p>Draco who listened, really listened, and responded to him with an empathetic understanding.</p><p>Draco who made him laugh til tears with his dry wit and sarcastic commentary.</p><p>Draco who helped him study and focus and actually find enjoyment in learning new magical theory again.</p><p>Draco who pushed him to be a better version of himself, even if he was a prat about it most of the time.</p><p>Draco who helped him enjoy himself, grounding him to the moment.</p><p>Draco, Draco, Draco.</p><p>Turns out, when Draco isn't being abused by a racist parent or blackmailed into a corner by a murderous lunatic, he’s a really good person. And anyone who could stare their offenses in the face the way he did, own them, apologize for them, well, Harry knew that took a hell of a lot of courage and strength. It did not take long for Harry to realize that Draco had his respect. Draco had his attention.</p><p>Now he knew Draco had <em>him</em>.</p><p>Harry stood quickly, startling Ron and Hermione.</p><p>"Mate? Where-"</p><p>"I need some air. I'm fine, um, I'll just meet you upstairs in a while, yeah?"</p><p>"You sure? We could come with you?"</p><p>"No. No I'm fine, really. I just need to go, um. Now."</p><p>Harry turned and walked quickly out of the hall leaving his confused friends behind and feeling a specific pair of eyes watching his back all the way out.</p><p>The next few days Harry found himself in a vicious cycle. He didn’t want to damage his friendship with Draco so he couldn't ignore him, but every time he found himself anywhere near the other boy, the flood of feelings, the pull, the longing would overwhelm him and he would have to get away before he did something idiotic.</p><p>Harry found it best to not even look in Draco’s direction and force his mind to focus anywhere else. He played quidditch with Katie Bell and chess with Ron. He helped Neville with the plants in the newly built greenhouses and built fires around the lake with Dean and Seamus. He even studied with Hermione and one desperate afternoon, counted the stones in the wall of his room. Anything to keep from acknowledging that he was missing Draco so badly it physically hurt.</p><p>He was overwhelmed at the sight of the other boy, and very angry that these feelings had stolen the comfort of his friend.</p><p>When Draco would come into a room, he would find a reason to leave. He made up one lame excuses after another. He took different hallways and short cuts. He skipped meals and snuck snacks from the kitchens. He tracked Malfoy on the map even more obsessively than sixth year, only this time to avoid rather than to stalk. Reverse stalking? Harry wondered if there was such a thing.</p><p>
  <em>Where is he? Come on... bloody map is too big.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I managed to hide from Voldemort for a whole damn year. Why can't I hide from one blonde git for a few bloody days?! </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Cause you don’t actually want to. </em>
</p><p><em>Cause all you can think </em> <em>about</em> <em> is being very, very near him.</em></p><p>
  <em>Cause you’re not hiding, you’re running</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Shit!</em>
</p><p>Harry hid in an alcove as Draco and Pansy walked by. Pansy was rambling on about something, but Draco was obviously ignoring her completely. He looked lost in his own thoughts, and Harry wondered what was on his mind. He wondered if it was him. He let his head fall back into the wall with a silent groan, before turning reluctantly in the other direction.</p><p>His plan was, well not working per se and it was admittedly not a great plan, but he was at least buying some time to sort himself out. And he was making some progress, he supposed. That is, until the weekend came and all of his friends wanted his attention - including his “just friend” friend. And, <em>great</em>. He had to pass through them all sat around in the common room to get to his refuge up the stairs.</p><p>“Oi Harry! Good, you're finally here. Come on Mate! Seamus snuck in some fire whiskey!” </p><p>“Yes Potter, do relax. No heroes needed for today and all that.” Draco waved a dismissive hand towards the open side of the sofa he and Pansy sat on, but Harry caught the unspoken question, the insecurity in his voice.</p><p>He caught a brief glimpse of Draco’s face as Draco looked off into the fire. Harry saw confusion there and frustration and hurt. He mumbled something about a headache to no one in particular and ignored their protests and questions as he made a hasty exit from the group lounging all around the Eighth Year’s common room. </p><p>He was driving everyone, including himself, mental with his erratic behavior. He just couldn’t figure out the right thing to do.</p><p>He slammed his door closed, flung himself down face first across his bed, and forced himself to just be still and breathe.</p><p>He was alone in the quiet for a few long minutes until three curt knocks shattered the silence. He was expecting them to check on him, but it still made him slightly jump.</p><p>"Hermione, I'm fine! Thank you but I don't need any potions," he yelled to his closed door. He was so bloody tired of running and hiding, so done convincing everyone he was fine. </p><p>
  <em>I AM fine goddammit.</em>
</p><p>and then, “Potter. I’m coming in.”</p><p>
  <em>No. Shit. I’m not ready. I'm not fine. I'm so not fine!</em>
</p><p>Harry stayed frozen across his bed with his head turned towards the wall. He didn't move or speak. He felt Draco enter the room.</p><p>“Potter, honestly, what the hell happened in here? Did you lose a fight with a troll? I can’t even see the floor.”</p><p>“I’ve never lost a fight with a troll,” Harry mumbled into his blankets.</p><p>“What? Potter really. This is beyond ridiculous. Will you sit up already?”</p><p>Harry huffed and forced himself to turn his face out of the covers just enough to speak clearly but without turning towards Draco. “Malfoy just... just go ok? I just need to be alone.”</p><p>“Oh you don’t need shit. You need to get your head out of your ass.”</p><p>“What the hell Malfoy! This is my room!”</p><p>“Yes, and your pity party apparently.”</p><p>“Just go already.” He had meant it to come out with force, meant it to be commanding. Instead his voice was pleading, almost whiny. He wanted to fall through his bed and through the floor to escape this conversation.</p><p>“Fine, Potter. I’ll go. I’ll go just as soon as you tell me what in Merlin’s name I did to piss you off so much.”</p><p>
  <em>What the hell?</em>
</p><p>“What? What are you on about? I’m not pissed at you.”</p><p>“Oh really. <em>Really</em>? You haven’t stood in same room with me <em>voluntarily</em>, in over a week. You can’t even look me in the eye! I know we’re new to this whole friendship thing, but I thought we were at least passed this level of tripe.” Malfoy sounded tired and he sounded hurt. This was the opposite of what Harry wanted.</p><p>“Malfoy, I’m not mad, I swear. I’m...I’m just, I don’t know. I’m thinking.”</p><p>“Thinking. Thinking about what, dare I ask? Thinking how to tell me to fuck off? Well don’t worry, Potter. Consider your owl received.”</p><p>“Malfoy no. No. This isn’t even about you, you prat! ...Well... it is...but it’s not like that, alight!”</p><p>“Oh Alright. Sure. Then what <em>is</em> it like? If it is about me then explain it to me. Don’t tell me that Gryffindor courage has finally run out.”</p><p>“Don’t do that. Don’t provoke me, Malfoy. You know I hate all that stereotypical bullshit.”</p><p>“Fine then, Potter. Stop running the fuck away from me and talk to me! And you could at least stand and attempt to have a proper conversation! You can't even turn your stupid head? Or you won’t? What is the bloody problem!?”</p><p>Harry slapped his hands on his bed and forced himself to rise to his feet. He did not give in and look at Malfoy, instead he whirled around to look out his window, folding his arms to keep himself together.</p><p>They were silent for several tense moments.</p><p>“Potter," Draco's voice was all of a sudden soft and almost vulnerable. It threw Harry off balance. "I know you’ve been avoiding me. You never stay when we meet in the tower or the library or anywhere anymore. Merlin, you don't even come to meals in the Hall. You won't relax with your friends if I'm there. You won’t even look at me." Draco sounded small and wounded by the end. It made Harry ache inside.</p><p>"Just tell me. What did I do?”</p><p>“Nothing. Nothing ok? You just...are you. And I can’t, I mean I... god dammit. I don’t want to ruin our friendship ok!? We just found this and ...it’ll just ruin everything.”</p><p>“What will? I don’t understand.”</p><p>“Ugh!! Me, ok? <em>This</em>. This feeling I have and this thing in me that won’t go away." Harry clawed at his chest like he could scrape it all out. "I just need some time to-to figure it out. So I don’t ...hurt you.”</p><p>“Potter, what thing? What feeling?”</p><p>Harry didn’t reply. He just dropped his arms, his whole body assuming the posture of someone who is completely out of fight.</p><p>“Feelings? Potter you... are you saying you have feelings... for me?”</p><p>Harry stood breathing hard, infuriated with himself and panic rising. Everything in him was screaming at the same time. Turn. Don't turn. Tell him everything. Set it all free. Protect the friendship. Deny. Tell him nothing. It all felt like a disaster and somewhere deep inside of him he felt the damn break open.</p><p>“Yes! Yes ok! And I know what you're going to say 'Oh well done Potter, spoiled something again!' ...Don’t worry ok, I get it. I understand if its too uncomfortable—“</p><p>“Potter, look at me.”</p><p>Harry did not move.</p><p>“Look. At. Me.”</p><p>...</p><p>“God dammit Potter LOOK-“</p><p>“I CAN’T ALRIGHT!” Harry panted, desperate to get a hold of this, a hold of himself. He took a deep, slow breath. And then another. His mind jumped to the last conversation he had with his mind-healer. Her words tumbled back to him like he was inside a pensive memory.</p><p>
  <em>"Sounds to me like you've been told who you are for most of your life, would you agree Harry?"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>He simple nodded, trying to process this new filter to his past.</em>
</p><p><em>"Well, those voices are gone, aren't they? It's all yours now Harry. Only you get to decide what labels sticks. Only you get to decide who you are and what's right for you. It really is </em>your<em> life - only yours. So... who are you, Harry? You've told me about so many people who care about you unconditionally - Ron, Hermione, ...Draco. I'm sure they want you to be "just Harry" as you like to say. I'm sure they will help you find your way, if you let them. I suppose the question is, do you have the courage for one more journey? Do you have the courage to break free one more time?"</em></p><p>As he searched himself he realized that no, no he had not run out of courage just yet.</p><p>
  <em>Ron, Hermione, ...Draco. </em>
</p><p>Harry took a giant breath, and let it all come tumbling out.</p><p>“When I look at you, <em>if</em> I look at you... I’ll see your eyes," he shrugged, "And if I see your eyes, I won’t be able to look away. And then ...then I’ll see your lips, and if I see your lips Draco, I <em>am</em> going to kiss you. And...and if I start kissing you...," he huffed a sarcastic laugh, "I am not going to stop kissing you. So no. No, I can’t look at you right now, alright?”</p><p>Harry felt a warm hand grasp his wrist and pull him around. He screwed his eyes shut and kept his head down.</p><p>
  <em>Don't ruin this! Don't hurt your friend. Can't lose Draco.</em>
</p><p>“Potter.”</p><p>
  <em>Draco.</em>
</p><p>“Potter look at me.”</p><p>...</p><p>“Please?”</p><p>
  <em>Fuck.</em>
</p><p>Harry slowly cracked his eyes open. He saw the tops of Draco’s stupid polished dress shoes. He trailed up his long, tailored grey pants. Past his shiny belt buckle, up his white buttons to his perfectly starched collar. He swallowed hard as he stared at Draco’s long elegant neck, but stopped there just below his chin.</p><p>Harry’s eyes jumped up and out to Draco’s ear and then higher to his soft, silky blonde hair, higher still. He was looking up and over Draco, cheating.</p><p>"Come on Potter."</p><p>“Draco,” he whispered to the ceiling, “are you sure?”</p><p>“Harry James Potter, please... <em>look at</em> <em>me</em>.”</p><p>Harry nearly melted through the floor.</p><p>He closed his eyes again, took as deep a breath as he could manage with his heart trying to beat out through his chest, and he did it. He looked straight into Draco’s eyes, his big beautiful swirling silvery blue, stunning eyes. </p><p>Draco met his gaze with a soft intensity and shy smile. Harry couldn’t move. He was lost in the molten whirlpool depths of Draco.</p><p>“Hello Harry,” Draco whispered breathlessly. And then it was Draco’s hands that shot to Harry’s face as he closed the small space in between them.</p><p>The kissing was all the contradictions Harry knew and loved about Draco. It was soft and firm. It was sweet but insistent. It was bold and unsure. It was fast and slow. It was too much and not ever enough. It was oxygen and he couldn’t breathe. It was so very Draco.</p><p>Their lips parted and their heads tilted. Their tongues tangled and rolled and slid and pressed, and as the kisses grew deeper and arms grasped tighter, Harry's world stopped turning for moment... <em>oooh gods </em>...and then started spinning in a whole new direction.</p><p>His magic began to vibrate within him. He felt emboldened, freed, flooded with a new sense of self and a tsunami of desire. Without thinking he was pushing Draco back, causing him to stumble a bit until his back hit the wall. Harry’s hands mapped Draco’s body and he kissed him in a frenzy. Draco broke the kiss.</p><p>“Harry. Harry. Wait. Slow *kiss* slow down.”</p><p>They panted and stared at each other.</p><p>“Sorry. Sorry. But I did warn you, and you just- it feels so-“</p><p>”Yeah. Yeah I know.” A small smile broke out on Draco’s face. Harry’s smile followed. And then they were laughing together, giddy on relief and the wonder of possibilities.</p><p>“So Potter,” Draco sniffed and squared his shoulders as only an impossibly poshy git could, “you fancy me, eh?”</p><p>“Oh shove off Malfoy.” Harry tried not to laugh. He failed.</p><p>Malfoy smiled down at him in authentic happiness. It was blindingly beautiful and Harry could do nothing but kiss him again. And again. And again. And-</p><p><em>Knock. Knock. </em>“Harry, you alright mate? Sorry, s’just you know how Mione... can...be...?”</p><p>Harry jumped back from Draco as Ron entered the room, but their rumpled clothes, chaotic hair, and general disheveled appearances gave them away loud and clear.</p><p>“Oh bloody hell,” Ron chuckled with fond exasperation. He shook his head, turned, and walked away leaving the door open and calling down, “S’alright Mione! They’ve just finally sorted their stupid selves out!”</p><p>Harry laughed as a wave of affection for Ron Weasley wash over him.</p><p>“Have we then Potter? Sorted ourselves out?” They met eyes again.</p><p>“A bit yeah,” Harry chuckled, basking in the alleviation. “Probably have a bit of talking to do though.”</p><p>“Probably, yes. And I dare say we could do a fair amount of talking on say, a date to Hogsmeade? Tomorrow?”</p><p>“Y-yeah? I mean. Yes, brilliant. Yeah.”</p><p>“Eloquent as always, Chosen One."</p><p>"Such a Tosser," Harry said with a smile.</p><p>"And who knows Potter, I might even let you look at me some more.”</p><p>“Shut it Malfoy.” Harry grabbed the front of Draco’s shirt and playfully pushed him back into the wall. “You have to be careful tomorrow, you know, you might even enjoy yourself.”</p><p>“The horror of it all.”</p><p>The two boys stared at each other with silly wide grins stretching their faces, reveling in the enormity of this moment. Harry gazed up into Draco’s brilliant, beautiful eyes, and Draco stared passionately right back.</p><p>“Harry Potter, stop looking at me like that or I will be forced to keep kissing you.”</p><p>”I’m not ever going to stop, Draco Malfoy. I’m never going to run from this again.”</p><p>Harry felt something profound settle deep within himself. He felt bold and brave. All the sides of himself finally singing in harmony. He felt found. </p><p>The victory of the war was for the good of them all. This victory though, this freedom to be his true authentic self, this was all for him. He was finally, completely free. And he'd be damned if he wasn't going to let himself enjoy it for a very long time.</p></div>
