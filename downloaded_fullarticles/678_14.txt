  <em> <strong>Year One</strong> </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Mr. and Mrs. Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much.</p><p>Harry, however, didn’t care too much about that nonsense. He had never been normal and he certainly wasn’t about to start now.</p><p>.</p><p>It began, as too many stories do, with hateful words and cruel actions. He was ridiculed, cast aside, dismissed as <em>the worthless freak, </em>as if that made him less than human. Strange things had a habit of occurring whenever he was feeling particularly angry or sad, and children often had words that bit deeper than any adult’s could.</p><p>He had tried to pretend at normalcy. He had tried to push and push down the feelings of something inside him, something trying to come out to play. It didn’t work all that well. He wasn’t all that surprised, anyway.</p><p>So no, Harry was not normal.</p><p>He let their words and behaviour be and pretended that it didn't hurt. He wouldn't <em>let</em> it hurt. </p><p>.</p><p>He loved his hair.</p><p>It always came back. However many times his aunt had attempted to shear it off, more crooked and with more blood as time wore on, his hair would grow back overnight. Every time, without fail.</p><p>Harry really loved his hair. </p><p>It was untameable. </p><p>.</p><p>Others laughed at his scar, but if he was honest with himself, as he made a point to be, he was rather fond of the slightly-raised lightning bolt. It hurt sometimes, late at night as he lay in his cupboard with the spiders and the mice, but he whispered soft words as a comfort to himself until the pain receded.</p><p>Most of the special things in his life came with pain anyway. Harry didn’t mind so much anymore.</p><p>Besides, he could take that kind of pain. He had plenty of practice. </p><p>. </p><p>Head down, face hidden, not out of shame but out of self-preservation. </p><p>If they didn't see him, then there was nothing to tame, yes? </p><p>.</p><p>Harry, for all the things he’d discovered about himself, hadn't known he could talk to snakes. </p><p>He could make things move without touching them. He could heat his cupboard with a thought. He could make his cuts and bruises heal far faster than they were supposed to and his stomach hurt less than it should. Occasionally he could even make music out of air, soft notes and faint melodies floating through the wind that curled around him as he worked.</p><p>And now he could shift his thinking and his throat and speak in the hissing-language, but quietly, because he knew better than to let Dudley hear.</p><p>He could make glass vanish too.</p><p>.</p><p>Then the letters came.</p><p>Hogwarts, School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.</p><p>He’d plucked one out of the air while his uncle was gathering the ones on the ground. His uncle’s face was red and his aunt was shaking. Harry hid it under his shirt, which was big enough for the bulge not to show, and read it as he holed up in his cupboard for the night.</p><p>Apparently, if he asked nicely enough with the strange force that laid within him, he could make his finger softly glow as a light to read by.</p><p><em> Hogwarts</em>. What a strange name.</p><p>It sounded equal parts ridiculous and perfect. Harry decided on the latter.</p><p>.</p><p>It was never silent in his cupboard.</p><p>He could hear Dudley in the room above him, his aunt and uncle as they shifted around, seemingly never satisfied with where they were. He was good at sleeping through the creaking of the house and the cold of the cupboard and the hunger of his stomach.</p><p>Thankfully, the spiders and mice stayed away when he asked. He might have been the first to say ‘please’.</p><p>.</p><p>His uncle still didn’t know that he’d found a letter, so Harry, avoiding the argument and the inevitable beating that would come after, followed them to that miserable little shack in the middle of the sea. Then, as he settled on the floor, something hit the door.</p><p>
  <em> BOOM. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> . </em>
</p><p>Uncle had a rifle. The strange man had an umbrella.</p><p>Harry felt something coming off the man, something that was similar yet foreign at the same time, and he didn’t doubt for a second that if it came down to it, the man would win. </p><p>It was a fascinating feeling and Harry wanted <em>more. </em></p><p>.</p><p>“Harry — yer a wizard.”</p><p>Harry felt something inside of him twist. It was brilliant, the idea that he could do <em>magic</em>, that he would finally be where he belonged, that he would finally have people <em>like him</em>, as he'd always really wanted... it was like a breath of fresh air in a world otherwise dead. But it still struck a little wrong. A feeling more than a voice, made more of instinct than words, tickled at the back of his mind. </p><p>After all, the strange man looked expectant as he watched Harry's face. Like he had just revealed some great secret, or pulled back the bushes surrounding a spring of forbidden knowledge. But Harry wasn't surprised, not really, because how could a child <em>not notice</em> that thing inside him? How could they remain oblivious to the force that would respond to their call, happily, eager to agree in exchange for a 'please'?</p><p>Unless the singular act of noticing was Harry's doing. </p><p>There were questions building up in his mind, resting somewhere behind his eyes and putting an odd sort of strain on his vision. If <em>this</em> was all the wizarding world had to offer, strange men and pink umbrellas and mutilated pastries, then Harry might just have to do what he'd been doing for the past decade. Head down, face hidden, because if they couldn't see him then they wouldn't bother at all. </p><p>"I'm a what?" he asked loudly, predictably, plastering a bewildered look on his face. If he was going to downplay his abilities, he had to do it properly. </p><p>Funny, and he was so happy to finally belong. </p><p>But he refused to be a target. </p><p>Harry <em>learned. </em></p><p>.</p><p>Of course, after he'd already committed to the path of acting-like-less-than-he-was, Harry discovered that really, he didn't have a choice in the matter to begin with.</p><p>Harry Potter was the Boy Who Lived. He was only half-surprised.</p><p>Harry endured the muttering along with the disbelieving looks and awed glances. He was used to being not normal, but he wasn’t used to standing out in the way that he did now. Harry <em>liked</em> blending in. He was <em>good</em> at blending in. He <em>liked</em> learning in the background, unnoticed and uninterrupted. </p><p>Harry wasn't ashamed to admit that maybe, sometimes, it was nice to be seen. The background could, admittedly, be lonely. Safe, but lonely. </p><p>But they didn't see Harry. They saw their Saviour. </p><p>They didn't see <em>him</em>. </p><p>The looks of awe weren't worth the price. </p><p>.</p><p><em>Why</em>, Harry couldn't help but think, <em>if my parents were magic, and children with parents with magic live around magic...</em></p><p>
  <em>Why was I left to muggles? </em>
</p><p>It was a thought that took seed, watered with every tinking laugh of wizard-children. </p><p>.</p><p>
  <em> Enter, stranger, but take heed </em>
</p><p>Harry read slowly, carefully, taking in and remembering every word, because the goblin sneering at the door left an impression that he'd rather not trifle with.</p><p>
  <em> Of what awaits the sin of greed, </em>
</p><p>
  <em> For those who take, but do not earn, </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Must pay most dearly in their turn. </em>
</p><p>He thought — this, the goblin's countenance — this was more than a simple warning, because the wording, the aura, something about it screamed a sort of <em>personal vengeance</em>. He'd have to look into goblins and their history, Harry noted absentmindedly, but the one at the door was already eyeing him suspiciously. Time to move on. </p><p>
  <em> So if you seek beneath our floors </em>
</p><p>
  <em> A treasure that was never yours, </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Thief, you have been warned, beware </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Of finding more than treasure there. </em>
</p><p>Beware indeed, Harry thought wryly. </p><p>.</p><p>He’d never had money before, but the novelty was quickly overshadowed by <em>“the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen.”</em></p><p>Harry wouldn't typically call himself a cynic. As a general rule, he tried not to judge people too soon after meeting them, and certainly never before. He knew that people rarely deserved the benefit of the doubt, but he preferred to give it anyway. </p><p>Nonetheless, he found that he already had a few things to say about this ‘Dumbledore’ character.</p><p>Was the Headmaster an idiot, or did he just think that Harry was one?</p><p>But no. Prejudgements were unbecoming, and Harry preferred to be better than that. </p><p>.</p><p>Listening to Hagrid speak was an experience in of itself. Harry had to completely reconsider everything he had previously thought about himself. It seemed that the process might be a recurring theme in the wizarding world.</p><p>As Harry's chest tightened further and further, he thought, he just might be a cynic after all. </p><p>.</p><p>Vault six hundred and eighty-seven. Seventeen silver Sickles to a Galleon. Twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle.</p><p>“One speed only,” said Griphook, and Harry felt his the corner of his lip twitch into what wanted to be a smile. It was the closest he had gotten in a week. </p><p>It felt nice.</p><p>.</p><p>Harry had originally thought he was good at reading people. This, it seemed, would have to be re-evaluated. Either Harry himself was exceptional, or everyone else was painfully obvious, or this world as a whole was somehow leagues ahead of him and only playing to his ignorance. His chest tightened just a bit more every time he thought he saw a sign of the former. His face was hidden but his eyes remained watching. </p><p>Just once, he'd wanted to fit in. </p><p>“— another young man being fitted up just now, in fact,” Madam Malkin said, and something similar to disapproval flashed across her face. Harry had a feeling it wasn’t pointed toward him as he approached the only other boy in the room.</p><p>“Hello,” said the boy. He was holding his arms stiffly beside him and his posture was rigidly straight. “Hogwarts, too?”</p><p>Harry took a moment to look at him; the black of the boy’s robes made a too-harsh contrast against his skin. His white-blond hair was slicked back with far too much hair product, to the point where it almost looked painful, and his nose was stuck just a bit pompously in the air. The boy's discomfort felt almost palpable, though Harry wasn’t sure he'd even noticed. So Harry simply nodded, letting the boy fill up the silence and watching as he had to stop himself from shifting.</p><p>“My father’s next door buying my books and Mother’s up the street looking at wands. Then I’m going to drag them off to look at racing brooms. I don’t see why first years can’t have their own. I think I’ll bully Father into getting me one and I’ll smuggle it in somehow.”</p><p>Harry very briefly considered telling the boy that he was trying too hard, but he never paused to breathe, so Harry kept quiet. </p><p>“— until they get there, do they, but I know I’ll be in Slytherin, all our family has been — imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think I’d leave, wouldn’t you?”</p><p>Harry hummed noncommittally. The boy was under familial pressure, then, to be in this <em> Slytherin </em> group, whatever that was. His father undoubtedly held influence from the way he was mentioned. The boy had money and was in the upper tiers of society. Given what Hagrid had said, the boy's father was, quite possibly, on the darker side of the law. </p><p>Harry wasn’t one to make judgments, but he was also smart enough to keep track of potential allies. </p><p>Enemies too, of course. </p><p>This boy was of equal potential for either, perhaps. </p><p>.</p><p>Ollivander’s eyes saw too much. Or maybe just enough; Harry couldn’t quite decide. The concentrated magic in the wand shop was making his head spin. It wasn't the same as what lived within him, and it was overwhelming, the bombardment of <em>otherness. </em></p><p>Holly, phoenix feather, eleven inches. Nice and supple.</p><p><em> Terrible things, but great, </em>said Ollivander, and Harry sighed softly. </p><p>Harry wouldn't tell others that part. He didn't want a legacy to live up to, twice-connected to a Dark Lord. </p><p>.</p><p>He almost felt guilty for denying Hagrid, but he didn’t exactly have the space or need for an owl. Hagrid scoffed at the idea of a cat, so they left the pet shop empty-handed. Harry didn't mind; the snakes were getting awfully chatty, and they were rather hard to ignore once they got started. They wanted mice and cleaner glass. Much beyond that stretched their limited vocabulary. </p><p>Harry knew because he had crept into a corner, hiding in the shadows like they were a part of him, and whispered; "What are your names?" he had asked, along with "where are you from?" and "do you have family?" and every question that he had. </p><p>"Mice?" They had replied, "sticky cave? More mice?" </p><p>And then Hagrid was calling his name, so Harry slipped out of the shadows and pretended like nothing had occurred. In a way it hadn't. Regardless, he had a feeling that talking to snakes, an animal associated with sin and <em>bad,</em> was a part of him also not normal. </p><p>.</p><p>Thankfully, his remaining week at the Dursleys' went quickly. He didn’t bother them and they didn’t bother him. Harry only hoped it would last. </p><p>If it didn't — well.</p><p>Now Harry knew what to call his magic, and he knew that they were unequivocally terrified of the subject, and he had no qualms about using their fear against them. </p><p>It would be what it would be. Harry didn't bother to deny his curiosity, because he had discovered a gap in his knowledge, and he wanted to <em>know. </em></p><p>.</p><p>Fred and George were his favorite.</p><p>He didn’t know how their mother couldn’t tell them apart. They felt distinctly different, the feeling of other that Harry had learned to identify after his wizard-watching. Feeling himself was still easier than reaching out, but he was slowly getting better, though he was still recovering from the backlash of the wand shop. </p><p>The red-headed family was almost a breath of fresh air. </p><p>Mrs. Weasley was overwhelming. Ron was nervous. Ginny was giddy. Percy needed a few deep-breathing exercises. But the twins, they were clever and quick-witted, with a sort of sharpness in their demeanor that Harry could appreciate. </p><p>Gred and Forge were just the right type of loud.</p><p>.</p><p>He sat with Ron anyway. </p><p>The boy was quiet, if anything. </p><p>.</p><p>Hermione was going to be in Gryffindor.</p><p>Harry had bought several books and soaked in every bit of information he could, in the week before school, curled on the old bed in Dudley's second bedroom. According to everything he'd read, Hermione would most likely fit best in Ravenclaw. She was practically the <em>textbook definition</em> of a Ravenclaw. </p><p>But he could feel the frantic, dancing energy around her. Hermione most likely wouldn’t find balance for years to come.</p><p>She was going to be in Gryffindor, because that was how children worked. </p><p>Harry wondered what he was like. </p><p>.</p><p>The rat felt <em>off</em>, Harry noticed. </p><p><em>Scabbers. </em>Something about Ron's rat was wrong, and it wasn't the creature's refusal to turn yellow. Harry filed the information away for later use; he trusted the feeling inside him, the one that let him read others, and it had never let him down before. </p><p>The not-knowing bothered Harry. He couldn’t quite put his finger on it. The knowledge was right there, locked in his brain in a place that he couldn't quite reach. </p><p>For some reason, the image of an old woman and a cat flashed in his mind.</p><p>.</p><p>Ron was worried that they would have to fight a troll. Harry suppressed a sigh. </p><p>.</p><p>“The… <em> wrong sort</em>,” Draco Malfoy sneered.</p><p>Harry debated. He didn’t particularly like Ron and friendship with Draco would most likely prove more beneficial in the long run. Draco's father had connections. Harry could tell by the way the other boy had introduced himself, even if it was mostly posturing. </p><p>But Draco was hated by a majority of the students he'd met thus far, it would seem, and Slytherin by even more so, so Harry inwardly winced and <em>I think I can tell the wrong sort for myself, thanks</em>.</p><p>If he ever met Draco’s father, he would have to make a good impression. Thankfully, children tended to be much quicker to forgive and forget. </p><p>Still — the hurt look on Draco's face almost made Harry reconsider. </p><p>"It was nice to meet you," Harry said, his kindness genuine. Draco himself wasn't bad. He just wasn't useful. </p><p>.</p><p><em>“Ah, you’re a tricky one, aren’t you?"  </em>The Sorting Hat whispered into his mind.</p><p>Hermione had gone into Gryffindor, Draco into Slytherin. He had a choice to make.</p><p><em>“You’d do well in Slytherin,”</em>  the Hat suggested.</p><p><em>“Slytherin would hold me back,”</em>  Harry thought. <em>“I would go farther in another House, one that played to my strengths and minimized my weaknesses. The spotlight would be stifling. I’d rather a place where expectations would do good rather than harm.”</em></p><p>The Hat sounded almost amused. “<em>What would you choose, then? </em>”</p><p><em>“Ravenclaw</em>,<em>”</em>  Harry said. <em>“Access to information and bias that allows me to be free with my interests and unquestioned in my motives. Or at least, that's what I've gathered so far.”</em></p><p>
  <em>“That’s an awfully Slytherin mindset of yours.”</em>
</p><p><em>“Yes,”</em>  Harry admitted. <em>“But you don’t place students in Houses simply for their traits, do you? Hermione Granger, by all accounts, should be in Ravenclaw, but she chose Gryffindor for who she </em>wanted<em> to be, didn't she?"</em></p><p>
  <em>“You can’t choose your House.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Can’t you?”</em>
</p><p>And so the Hat called out his House, and Harry went to sit with the Claws.</p><p>.</p><p>Harry was given his own dorm room. Not enough people, the Prefect had said with a small shrug. The room wasn’t big, exactly, but it was several times larger than Harry’s cupboard and had its own window and small alcove. </p><p>Harry loved it, from the dark mahogany floors to the pale blue walls, off-white drapes across the window and blankets piled on the bed. </p><p>It was <em>his</em>. </p><p>.</p><p>Professor Flitwick must have known his parents.</p><p>Objectively, Harry was horrendous at making the small feather float. It was ironic, he thought, because he was talented in ways that others were not, but utterly lost when it came to what was a simple charm for most. His pronunciation came out stilted and awkward, his wand movements jerky and forced. Flitwick still beamed in his direction.</p><p>Hermione Granger was rather impressive, even as she lectured Ron Weasley. Swish and flick, she said. Harry tried to follow along. The feather twitched.</p><p>It was another mark of how different he was, <em> not normal </em> even among magic-users. Harry had no doubt that he could make the feather <em>soar</em>, but the wand confused him. It centered his magic, focusing it to such a thin point that it was harder to manipulate.</p><p>Harry had always done spells by politely asking the force inside him to lend him power, to help him pull the strings of reality for just a short moment. It wasn’t in him to <em>manhandle </em>a spell into being. His magic liked to help, anyway; it was always rather responsive, spreading through his body before he had even fully formed the request.</p><p>But with a wand, he had to direct. Command. There was no softly worded question or guiding with a gentle hand. No, the magic had to <em>obey.</em></p><p>His magic didn't like that so much, and besides, it didn’t make sense to him. Perhaps that was why he couldn’t make himself shove the power into the small stick of wood. He didn’t want his magic confined to a certain set of boundaries. </p><p>Harry hated confinement and his magic was a part of him. It was only logical that his magic felt the same. </p><p>But this was school and he didn't have a choice, so he whispered a <em> sorry </em>and softly pushed his magic from his fingers and into his wand, half-heartedly muttering the incantation while telling the force, <em> please, I’m sorry, I don’t mean to constrain you like this, forced into this—what is it, dead wood?—, but please can you lift this feather?</em></p><p>The feather floated. Harry smiled; a small, wistful thing, a twitch of the mouth coupled with bittersweet eyes. </p><p>.</p><p>He stayed away from the Restricted Section.</p><p>Harry was obviously curious, as he was with the vast majority of things in life, but he didn’t want to raise questions about himself so early in the year. It didn’t mean he wasn’t tempted.</p><p>He resolved to sneak in at some point, if only to peruse the shelves and see what exactly got itself listed as <em>restricted.</em></p><p>Instead, he focused on his newest fascination: runes. The specialized class wasn’t available for first-years, but he had seen a textbook from one of his fellow Housemates and found himself intrigued. And it wasn't restricted, even with the dangers he was discovering, simply because students didn't care enough to bother. </p><p>Runes, unlike spells, were suggestions. They could mean many different things, had an almost ludicrous number of different interpretations, and required precision in every line. A mistake made something new entirely.</p><p>Runes channeled power in a way more all-encompassing than either wand or wizard. Runes created and strengthened wards, they siphoned strength, they could act as a storage unit for excess magic or discouragement for mal-intended spells. They could be modified to fit their purpose or created to best suit a new one.</p><p>Most of all, they were not necessarily a <em>structure.</em> Runes were more of a very strong, very powerful <em>suggestion</em>.</p><p>Harry could very much support that. </p><p>.</p><p>Professor Snape, like Professor Flitwick, must have known his parents. </p><p>Harry had never before had a legacy. He’d never had someone to look or live up to. That had completely changed, and he found that he did not appreciate it. </p><p>Professor Snape held a permanent sneer in his direction. It was almost impressive, if Harry was being honest, that one person could hold so much animosity for a stranger.</p><p>“Harry Potter, our new — <em> celebrity</em>.”</p><p>Yes, definitely impressive, Harry decided.</p><p>“Tell me,” Professor Snape said, “what would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?”</p><p>He could tell that the professor’s question was an effort to humiliate, considering that no first-year student would read the entire text before the first class had even begun. He debated not answering, but he was in the House of the Clever, and he had to prove that he could succeed here. Even if he was only proving it to himself. There was no need to bury his head underground in an effort to keep himself unnoticed.</p><p>Hermione’s hand shot up. (Perhaps Harry had been wrong, and there was <em>one</em> first-year student that had read the entire text before the first class had even begun.) The professor ignored the girl altogether, his face twisting more when Harry didn’t answer. “Nothing for me, <em>Potter?”</em></p><p>Harry furrowed his brow, thinking. Asphodel? Wormwood? He hadn't memorized the specific ingredients to each potion, because really, that would be asinine, but he knew a bit about the plants and animals involved. His first thought was some sort of cleansing solution, but that was far too mundane for a man like Professor Snape, and the man has said powdered, not sliced, which made a dramatic difference. </p><p>“Some sort of very strong sedative, I’d imagine,” Harry said, “I don’t know enough about the specific names, but based on those properties… an incredibly potent draught.”</p><p>He was right. He could tell by the increasingly-displeased look on the professor’s face.</p><p>“Where could I find a bezoar?” Professor Snape shot back, ever the picture of professionalism.</p><p>Yes, Harry had read something about this one, around the time he was looking into how to identify more dangerous magical substances. Just in case, of course.</p><p>“The stomach of a goat, Sir.”</p><p>Professor Snape’s scowl grew deeper.</p><p>It hadn’t even been ten minutes and Harry was already exhausted. Pity, he’d been looking forward to Potions. Maybe he could self-study?</p><p>“What’s the difference between —”</p><p>Yes, it would seem he was on his own for this class.</p><p>.</p><p>To be fair, Harry found himself on his own most times.</p><p>Days passed relatively quickly. He ate by himself, marveling at the amount of food available to begin with, bringing his quill with him but leaving his books in his room. He’d hate to get food on them, after all, but he could spare pieces of parchment if it meant being able to write legibly.</p><p>It was difficult. Who had come up with the idea of writing with a giant <em>feather? </em> Honestly. </p><p>.</p><p>He explored the castle between classes.</p><p>He made sure to stay in his room during the night because, despite his curiosity, he didn’t want to be found by the infamous Mr. Filch. Harry was sure the man wasn’t as bad as the rumors claimed, but he wasn't incredibly eager to test that theory. Optimism, he'd found, was often an unnecessary risk. </p><p>Besides, extra attention and all that. He'd really rather not. </p><p>.</p><p>Harry knew he was bothering Madam Hooch. He didn’t much care.</p><p>The other students stood by their brooms, hands out, <em> up, up, UP</em>.</p><p>“But are the brooms magic?” He asked her, quietly as not to draw too much attention, because Merlin forbid the books in the library tell them something so simple. He wanted to know for the sake of knowing, which he perhaps was rare in of itself.</p><p>“They’re charmed, Mr. Potter,” Madam Hooch said. “It’s a very complicated process.”</p><p>“Why <em> brooms</em>?” He asked, unable to help himself, because <em>'It's complicated'</em> should never count as a proper answer to any question. “They don’t look very comfortable, and while there might be some level of aerodynamics involved, it would make sense to enchant something that would be easier to hold on to —”</p><p>She gave him an unreadable look. He pulled back his curiosity and held his hand above his given broom, ratty and chipped and second-hand. He waited until she had walked away to softly ask, “Up?”, and the broom lazily drifted into his hand. </p><p>It was for the aesthetic of traditionality. Like the quills and parchment. Or the lack of lightbulbs and plastic shampoo bottles. Without a better explanation on hand, that was what Harry had decided. </p><p>.</p><p>Draco had stolen Neville’s Remembrall.</p><p>Harry found himself uncommonly irritated. Neville wasn’t the best in class, that much was already obvious, but Harry wasn’t one to sit back while someone was in pain for pain's sake. He walked over, refusing to doubt himself or think about how much <em>attention</em> this would likely bring, instead stepping closer and closer until he was invading Draco’s space in a very personal way.</p><p>“Draco,” Harry said softly, iron in his words and darkness in his bones, because his cupboard stayed under his skin and the twisted dark with it. The blond boy shivered. “You are the Malfoy Heir. Act the part.”</p><p>The blond, for reasons not quite known to Harry, dropped the Remembrall into Neville’s open hand.</p><p>Not without a sneer, of course, but Harry took it as a win. </p><p>Even if he had used his dark to get it. It was such a small hint that it barely counted, anyway. </p><p>.</p><p>Harry liked Professor McGonagall.</p><p>There was only one problem. Harry had felt the sort of magic around her, just once before, when he was new to this world and what it entailed.</p><p>Professor McGonagall was also a cat, which meant Scabbers must have also been a man.</p><p>He had no doubt that Ron didn’t know.</p><p>The thought was — quite uncomfortable. </p><p>.</p><p>True to his nature, Harry ended up in the library. It was official; he was going to learn <em>what </em>that was and <em>how </em>to do it. Becoming an animal... that could give him a huge advantage. Over <em>everything. </em></p><p>.</p><p>Professor Quirrell gave him a sick feeling. Harry didn’t know why; he seemed like a perfectly nice man. But Harry knew better than to ignore what his magic whispered into his ear, especially when his magic was saying <em> wrong, stay away, wrongwrongwrong. </em></p><p>Harry was careful to be very quiet in that class. Disappointing, because it might have otherwise been his favorite. </p><p>Despite his stutter, Quirrell was a half-decent professor. </p><p>Wrong, claimed his magic, and Harry listened. </p><p>.</p><p><em> Animagi</em>. He had a new goal, but the process was long and difficult, so he decided to leave it until summer. It wasn't like he'd be doing anything else. </p><p>.</p><p>A month into the term, Harry had the unsettling realisation that he was living in a <em> castle.</em></p><p>The ghosts were surreal, sure, and talking paintings were still a bit disconcerting. But now, and Harry really didn't know why he was even still surprised, he had found a secret passage.</p><p>.</p><p>He was in the library every day. Pince barely spared him a second glance. </p><p>It was there, buried in a book about the Founders looking for information about secret passages, that he found an interesting annotation. Apparently, his hissing-language wasn't unique, and it had a name: <em>Parseltongue. </em></p><p>Harry all but drowned himself in his family history, because it would be equal parts fascinating and terrifying if he was a descendant of Salazar Slytherin himself.</p><p>(He wasn’t. Harry wasn’t too disappointed, but he was <em>curious,</em> because he had to have gotten the ability from somewhere.</p><p>So he looked further.)</p><p>.</p><p>Harry liked flying. He didn't like much the class, but he loved the act itself. People looked small from up high, when the wind was screaming in his ears and dancing on his skin.</p><p>He could make the music appear there, too, and it was beautiful; he never showed anyone. He didn’t have anyone to show, but for the first time, that wasn’t the problem.</p><p>Harry had looked it up. Making music from air simply wasn’t something that magic-users did.</p><p>Absently, he wondered if anyone else could hear it at all.</p><p>.</p><p>Update: Yes. Mrs. Norris could.</p><p>She hated it. </p><p>Harry found this disproportionately amusing. </p><p>.</p><p>Professor Flitwick must have really loved his parents, because Harry was one of the worst students in Charms and Flitwick still smiled proudly. </p><p><em> Lumos </em>was a relatively simple spell. He had done it a million times. He still could; Harry had checked to make sure curled under his blankets in his dorms, the soft light he had so often summoned glowing beside him. If he asked, it would stay on the tip of his finger, but he preferred to have it float at his side.</p><p>The one he brought to the end of his wand sputtered, flashing too brightly.</p><p>He hated his wand, and it surprisingly had nothing to do with its brother owner. </p><p>Briefly, Harry considered going outside and finding a normal stick and keeping everything wandless after all. </p><p>But that would be...</p><p>.</p><p>Harry went somewhat unnoticed in Potions.</p><p>They weren’t allowed to use magic, and for that, he was glad, because every small mistake would cause a very large explosion, and when wands were involved, he made an embarrassing number of small mistakes. He'd yet to go to the Hospital Wing and Harry would much prefer to keep it that way. </p><p>Professor Snape ignored him for the most part. Scathing comments and burning looks were sent his way every few minutes, but that didn’t really count. </p><p>Harry had a decade of experience behind him.</p><p>.</p><p>Harry finally went outside and found a normal stick.</p><p>He apologized to the tree that he stole it from, because that's what it was, stealing, and then he shaved it down, polished it with half a thought, and pored over the small piece of wood until it looked identical to his magical wand. </p><p>He loved his new stick. His magic kept the wood alive, making its way through the stolen sprig far happier than it had ever been with the phoenix feather.</p><p>Harry kept his real wand close by, just in case.</p><p>.</p><p>His love for Runes was slowly put on hold for Theory.</p><p>At first he was just curious, as with everything, because his particular brand of magic didn’t seem to fit anyone else’s. It took him four days and thirteen books to reach a conclusion: Harry simply had a different perspective from the rest of the wizarding world.</p><p>At least, the rest of the wizarding world that the students at Hogwarts were allowed to study. Harry wasn’t blind and he certainly wasn't stupid. He <em>knew</em> there was more. He knew their provided material was censored. Probably quite heavily, by the looks of it, but he was good at taking bits and pieces and snips and abstract thoughts and bringing them together.</p><p>There was one thing that stood out to him in his hours of studying.</p><p>‘Magic’ had a lot of rules.</p><p>Perhaps that was where he and the rest differed. Harry knew that where there were rules, there were limits; while often a good thing, providing structures and standards, rules were also why wizard needed to wave wands and recite words and learn what was <em>impossible</em>.</p><p>He’d always hated the word ‘impossible’, but he didn’t know enough to push the limits more than he had already.</p><p>Tried-and-true had its value. Harry was only eleven. It was no time to start reshaping the world. That would have to wait a couple years. </p><p>.</p><p>He kept using his fake wand, though. </p><p>Professor Flitwick finally had a reason to be happy with him in Charms. </p><p>.</p><p>Harry woke early, bathed, dressed, and made his way to the Hall before the rest of his Housemates. Professor Snape was there most days, but Harry didn’t pay much attention to him.</p><p>He had never really had access to fresh food at the Dursleys', and choice was a foreign concept, so he allowed himself to eat only fruit and vegetables. The meat here was too greasy, and it reminded him of hot oil and cast iron pans. </p><p>Others looked at him oddly, the lone boy avoiding meat and sweets and drowning himself in work.</p><p>But he was a Ravenclaw, so it was okay. They were strange anyway.</p><p>.</p><p>It came to him, one night as he laid in the dark and stared at the sky, that people might think he was arrogant or stuck-up because of his withdrawn nature.</p><p>A laugh bubbled up.</p><p>Harry was glad he chose Ravenclaw. He might have had friends in the other Houses, but it would be so much more tedious.</p><p>.</p><p>Hermione Granger was interesting.</p><p>She had argued with the Sorting Hat just as he did, for the opposite reasons. She wanted to be seen, heard, recognized.</p><p>She wanted it so badly that she kept screwing it up.</p><p>Harry almost felt sorry for her.</p><p>Almost, but not quite.</p><p>She should have been smarter. </p><p>Some things would never be learned through books; it took years of hearing harsh words from the mouths and minds of children. </p><p>.</p><p>He realized something, as every morning he watched the Gryffindor table part for Hermione, that no one was willing to be directly beside her. She always sat in the middle, unconsciously wanting to be included.</p><p>Harry sat at the end of the table, where everyone could ignore him and no one had to move.</p><p>But Hermione didn’t seem to realize that her efforts were the very thing driving others away.</p><p>Harry already didn’t talk much in class, but he began to write a little less on his essays.</p><p>.</p><p>“Troll! Troll in the Dungeons!”</p><p>Harry debated. He had read about trolls, of course, but to see a live one would be a different sort of knowledge altogether, and how fascinating was that? He'd seen goblins and ghosts, but no other magical creature.</p><p>But no, he thought, the repercussions weren’t worth the attention it would bring. So the Boy Who Lived simply sighed and dutifully followed his Housemates to his common room.</p><p>.</p><p>Within the hour, the news came out: Ronald Weasley and Neville Longbottom had heroically run to warn Hermione Granger of the danger and the three first-years managed to defeat the troll.</p><p>It would be the talk of the school for a while. </p><p>Their eyes were not on Harry, and he was free to walk the shadows. It made it easier to ignore the swirling under his skin. </p><p>.</p><p>Harry spent the majority of his free time in the library. </p><p>He read too fast, he was discovering. The library was large, but only held so many books about any given subject. With his actual schoolwork on the backburner and his curiosities brought to the front, he methodically made his way through the vast aisles.</p><p>It was then that he discovered the idea of magic sensitivity.</p><p>It was one of the first concrete answers he’d found in a while. <em> This </em>was why he could sense others. <em> This </em>was why he could sense himself, too.</p><p>After that, Harry practiced. A lot. He didn’t have much to do, anyway, because staying average was rather easy. So he continued wandering the halls and stumbling his way through understanding his instincts.</p><p>The books didn’t have specifics. They didn’t have specifics on most things, actually, which could be rather irritating. He had to teach himself best he could, which admittedly wasn’t well, but it wasn’t as if Harry could exactly <em>ask </em>anyone.</p><p>The most interesting thing he discovered on his wanderings, when one of the staircases moved beneath him, was that the castle was <em>inundated </em>with magic. He hadn’t noticed before because it was so strong, but Hogwarts was positively <em>humming</em>.</p><p>It helped, a lot, when Professor Snape was berating him for one thing or another, to look solemn and nod and listen to the castle around him instead of the professor’s words.</p><p>Snape never seemed to notice. </p><p>.</p><p>Talking to oneself is the first sign of insanity, they say, but he wasn’t talking to himself at all.</p><p>He was talking to Hogwarts.</p><p>The castle never replied in words, exactly, but the magic pulsed around him almost like a living thing.</p><p>He had never felt quite so safe or comforted than during those late nights, looking out of his window and whispering his thoughts to the school.</p><p>Maybe he was going insane, but Harry could swear that Hogwarts’ magic got just a bit lighter whenever he let his music swirl around him.</p><p>.</p><p>Hogwarts led him to the Wish Room.</p><p>Harry didn’t know what it was really called, but he understood the purpose of the room itself, so he made do.</p><p>The Wish Room had books left behind, those that were most likely long forgotten. Harry asked; Hogwarts didn’t mind him reading them, but it didn’t want him to take the books out of the room.</p><p>It was knowledge for the wanderers. Harry understood.</p><p>.</p><p>Until the day that he understood too much.</p><p>One moment in his life, almost forgotten but always there. </p><p>The darkness that lived under his skin. </p><p>.</p><p>Half of him wished he had never found the Wish Room. That he had never picked up those books and dug into their contents with his usual hunger, devouring their words, a being too-long starved.</p><p>.</p><p>But now he understood.</p><p>Almost all of it, it seemed. Not quite, but almost.</p><p>.</p><p>Harry Potter had almost become an Obscurial.</p><p>He could remember that day, actually, when the darkness within him threatened to consume his being from the inside out and rip his skin and tear his mind and feed on his bones and destroy who he was. When he had almost let it.</p><p>He had dropped a vase, an ugly, floral-printed thing. Harry could still feel the drop in his gut, the feeling that <em> no, god, she’s going to kill me</em>.</p><p>The funny thing was, the vase didn’t even shatter. He had caught it. He was proud.</p><p>He was so <em>incredibly </em>proud.</p><p>And Dudley had seen the vase fall, and Harry’s catch, and it would have been fine if only not for the fact that Harry didn’t catch it with his hands but his magic.</p><p>He had never seen so much blood more than he did that night.</p><p>Harry had crawled into his cabinet, bones cracked and wrongly-healed, hunger too painful for his magic to dull, cold too deep inside himself for his light to reach.</p><p>He had almost died that night. And every night the week after, when he was blessedly ignored and left on his own to recover.</p><p>His hatred had almost eaten him alive. He had almost been happy to let it.</p><p>Harry was four.</p><p>And then his music came, the simple melody curling through the air and around his soul and lifting him up and up until he was no longer drowning in his darkness. It was there, still and waiting under his skin, but it was quiet.</p><p>Harry had <em>almost become an Obscurial.</em></p><p>In that moment, sitting in the Wish Room and holding back tears, Harry made himself a promise.</p><p>If he ever found out who forced him into the Dursleys' care, instead of some other <em>proper wizarding house</em>, like <em>proper wizarding children</em>, Harry would kill them.</p><p>How much that person was responsible for, well.</p><p>That would determine how long their death would take.</p><p>.</p><p>Harry stayed at school for Christmas.</p><p>Professor Flitwick gave him a pitying look, which Harry promptly ignored. His Head of House had no say in his decision.</p><p>He went through the same routine as always: shower, breakfast, library, lunch, library, dinner, library, bed. It was a habit at that point, a ritual in which he could find comfort.</p><p>Harry received a single gift on Christmas day. It was the first gift he could remember receiving.</p><p>And now, he could wander at night.</p><p>.</p><p>The Invisibility Cloak, as he’d learned it was called, starred in one very famous children’s tale.</p><p>But in every tale there was some truth. Harry researched deeper.</p><p>.</p><p>The Three Brothers. The Deathly Hallows.</p><p>It all came back to the Peverells.</p><p>The Stone, the Cloak, the Wand.</p><p>Maybe they didn’t exist. But Harry, like always, was curious.</p><p>.</p><p>One day, on a leap of most likely faulty logic, Harry saw Dumbledore’s wand held loosely in the old man’s hand and something in his mind clicked.</p><p>The mysterious person who had given him the cloak. A wand that looked awfully familiar to a certain picture in a certain book.</p><p>Harry hoped more than anything that he was wrong.</p><p>.</p><p>
  <em> Dumbledore and Grindewald, 1945. </em>
</p><p>Did every wizard already know this? Was the connection common sense, or did they simply not believe in the Elder Wand?</p><p>.</p><p>The night before Christmas break ended, Harry found a large, covered mirror in an abandoned room. The inscription looked like gibberish.</p><p>
  <em> erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi </em>
</p><p>Harry paused, avoiding looking in the mirror. He didn’t recognize the language, but he certainly didn’t want to find himself trapped in some sort of cursed object.</p><p>The most common language for wizards was Latin. This didn’t even have Latin roots, so either it was completely foreign, despite being in the English alphabet, or it was in code.</p><p>Wait, Harry thought. That one painter, da Vinci. He wrote backwards in a script you could only read in a mirror.</p><p><em>“I show not your face</em> <em>but your heart’s desire,”</em>  Harry mumbled, thanking Merlin for muggle school.</p><p>He considered not looking into the glass. Just walking away, avoiding the temptation.</p><p>But both fortunately and unfortunately for Harry, he prided himself in finding answers regardless of his personal opinion of whatever he’d find.</p><p>He moved forward slowly, coming into view of the mirror, whose image shimmered and shifted slightly. He could almost <em>see </em>the magic around it, subtly probing into his head and swirling around the mirror.</p><p>An older version of himself was staring contentedly off to the side, lazily curled up with another man and a thick book. The man was unidentifiable, less of a stranger and more of a person that had yet to be identified. The scene looked warm and comfortable, his older self’s body and the other’s fitting perfectly together as he rested in the man’s arms.</p><p>It was almost fitting, really, that his greatest desire would be faceless. He didn’t know anyone well enough to crave.</p><p>Harry turned and left with a heavy heart. It wouldn’t do to linger.</p><p>.</p><p>He found himself on the Astronomy tower, high above everything but the stars in the sky. Harry allowed himself a tear, surrounded by stone walls where no one could see. The cool night air burned in his lungs, but he kept breathing, in and out, over and over, until his head felt clear and his heart was light enough to move. </p><p>.</p><p>Harry spent the night in the Wish Room. Its magic unfurled around him like a friend’s, acknowledging his presence and lending its strength. A fireplace appeared in the corner, already lit, the heat of the flames slowly warming the air.</p><p>Harry smiled and held his blanket close, a mug of warm tea in his hands, and curled into a ball beside the crackling warmth. The Wish Room hummed happily around him.</p><p>If anything, magic would always be there.</p><p>.</p><p>The holidays ended. They learned <em>Alohomora</em>, the Unlocking Charm, and Harry was remarkably proficient for the first time.</p><p>His fake wand was paying off.</p><p>As Professor Flitwick beamed down on him, he could have sworn that he felt Hogwarts giggle.</p><p>.</p><p>Professor Quirrell was making him increasingly nervous. Something was changing. The murmurs of <em> wrongwrongwrong </em> had gotten louder and more insistent.</p><p>Harry couldn’t focus. Or rather, he couldn’t focus on anything but the man himself.</p><p>There was something about seeing his back to Harry that made Harry want to vomit.</p><p>.</p><p>He loved the invisibility cloak, but he officially <em>hated </em>what he found while wandering at night.</p><p>There was a <em> three-headed dog </em>on the ‘forbidden’ third-floor.</p><p>Three. Heads.</p><p>Harry hated magic sometimes.</p><p>.</p><p>He wasn’t paying attention to Professor Snape.</p><p>Instead, Harry was listening to the little voice in the back of his mind that had gotten louder as the days wore on.</p><p>The Potions Master had a limp. It was subtle, but Harry had hidden enough injuries of his own to know what suppressed pain looked like.</p><p>
  <em> Vault seven hundred and thirteen. Trolls. The wrongness around Professor Quirrell. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Who gave a child an Invisibility Cloak when danger sat so thick in the air? </em>
</p><p>His mind wouldn’t let go of the thoughts.</p><p>.</p><p>There was something off about Professor Quirrell’s stutter.</p><p>He couldn’t tell what, exactly, but <em> something</em>.</p><p>.</p><p>Professor McGonagall asked a question, and for once Harry didn’t know the answer. Only half an ear was listening. </p><p>He couldn’t shake the feeling that it was all <em> connected</em>.</p><p>.</p><p>Harry Potter wasn’t so egotistical as to think that the world revolved around him.</p><p>With that said, there were a lot of strange things happening that coincidentally coincided with him coming to Hogwarts.</p><p>As he absentmindedly perused the library, he came across his undeserved title, the one that his parents had died to give him.</p><p><em> Harry Potter, the Boy Who Lived</em>.</p><p>He was missing something. He almost had it. </p><p>.</p><p>Where was the Dark Lord last seen, again?</p><p>Where did Quirrell say he came from?</p><p>.</p><p>Harry didn’t often jump to conclusions, but it was all so painfully absurd that it fit together.</p><p>Nicolas Flamel. The Philosopher’s Stone and its resulting Elixir of Life. Vault seven hundred and thirteen, all that security, for only one small brown parcel. A robbery in Gringotts, everything left untouched. </p><p>Professor Quirrell. Albania. A stutter that didn’t quite ring true. Magic that said <em> wrongwrongwrong.</em></p><p>The third-floor corridor with a three-headed dog. The troll that managed to pass through Hogwarts’ wards.</p><p>It was time to revisit a certain floor.</p><p>.</p><p>Harry had never liked dogs. It probably came from memories of Marge, but with three heads snarling loudly in his face, he didn't have time to psychoanalyze. </p><p>Thankfully, someone had irritatingly annotated one of the creature-books with the ambiguous advice ‘<em>sing</em>’. Harry liked humming, so on a hunch, he did that instead.</p><p>Despite his hatred for dogs, he couldn’t help but rest his hand on one of its ears as he walked past the sleeping animal.</p><p>.</p><p>Plants. Plants that were trying to tear him apart.</p><p>Harry’s mind raced.</p><p>
  <em> What is a person’s first instinct? The perfect trap uses the victim’s mind against them, takes and twists their thoughts until thinking is useless and lost to panic. What is the first thing a person does when they’re scared and being held down? </em>
</p><p>
  <em> They fight. </em>
</p><p>Harry took a deep breath and forced himself to relax.</p><p>.</p><p>He had to find the key.</p><p>There was a broom in the corner.</p><p>With half a thought, the broom was racing towards him, and three seconds later, the key was in his hand.</p><p>.</p><p>This was too simple.</p><p>There was no possible way the Philosopher’s Stone would be hidden behind these ‘tests’ like an obstacle course. There was something <em> off</em>.</p><p>Harry was terrible at chess. He made his way around the enlarged board in place of playing the game.</p><p>Because that’s what this was. A game<em>. </em></p><p>.</p><p>Then he came across the Potions riddle, and a sort of fury spread throughout his body to his core as the pieces of the puzzle clicked together.</p><p>Herbology. Charms. Transfiguration. Potions.</p><p>A <em> three-headed dog </em> in a school full of <em> children</em>.</p><p>.</p><p><em> It really was a game</em>.</p><p>Harry felt disgusted.</p><p>Every professor had known.</p><p>They were <em> children</em>.</p><p>.</p><p>As Harry swallowed the correct potion, he slipped the nettle wine into his pocket. He had a feeling he’d need to numb out whatever happened next.</p><p>.</p><p>So he was right.</p><p>Quirrell pointed him towards the mirror. “Give me the Stone.”</p><p>“I will do nothing for your Lord,” Harry said quietly. Hogwarts shimmered around him.</p><p>“<em>The Stone</em>.”</p><p>Harry’s voice was steel, not unlike the tone he’d taken with Draco so long ago. “I will do <em> nothing </em> for your Lord.”</p><p>.</p><p>The voice requested to see him. Or demanded, he should say, because nothing was really a request with this man.</p><p>The Dark Lord was weak. Deformed. He couldn’t so much as form full sentences. Harry was half-tempted to give the man the Stone anyway, just to rid him of his pitiful form, but the pathetic creature thought it could control him.</p><p>Instead, he briefly consulted with the darkness that he held inside him, requesting that it help him with the removal of a certain parasite.</p><p>The darkness readily agreed.</p><p>.</p><p>There had never before been a wizard pulled back from becoming an Obscurial. Not so late.</p><p>There was a reason for that, Harry thought, as the blackness bled from his pores and fed on the air. His Obscurus might always live inside him, guiding his hand when he meant to destroy.</p><p>A parasite to kill a parasite.</p><p>Harry smiled his first true smile of the year. The room turned black. </p><p>Giddiness washed through him as the screaming started, and kept going.</p><p>And going.</p><p>And going.</p><p>He probably shouldn’t be enjoying this as much as he was, he thought absentmindedly, listening to his Obscurus rip his Professor to shreds from the inside out. But to be fair, if the Dark Lord had never killed his parents, the blackness would never have been inside him. </p><p>What comes around goes around, Harry mused, as a heavy body fell to the floor. </p><p>The Dark Lord undoubtedly had measures in place to come back, but never again to this body, never again to that form. The darkness had split him into pieces and burned him alive. </p><p>Well. Harry called it 'the darkness', but really, he knew it was just him. </p><p>.</p><p>He was in the infirmary. He wasn’t hurt, but he tolerated Madam Pomfrey’s fretting. His darkness had been sated and was satisfied to sit in the back of his mind, not forgotten but put aside for the time being.</p><p><em> What an adventure, my boy</em>, Dumbledore said.</p><p><em> The Invisibility Cloak, given to me by your father for safekeeping, </em> Dumbledore said.</p><p><em> I’m proud of you</em>, Dumbledore said.</p><p><em> The power of a mother’s love</em>, Dumbledore said.</p><p><em> When I chose the Dursleys… </em> Dumbledore said.</p><p>Through the old man’s speech, watching his eyes twinkle in a way that they had <em>no right</em>, Harry decided definitively this time.</p><p>Him.</p><p>
  <strong> <em>When I chose the Dursleys... </em> </strong>
</p><p>He was going to kill Albus Dumbledore, and he was going to make it <em> slow.</em><strong> <br/></strong></p>
