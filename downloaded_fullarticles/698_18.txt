    <p>Hermione watched with ever growing horror as Harry screamed. Screamed for Sirius, screamed for his pain, screamed for the injustice of being left alone again. Hot tears dripped down her face as she saw his heart breaking.</p>
<p>          But she, too, was in danger.</p>
<p>          The cold bite of Bellatrix’s blade was digging into the soft skin of her throat, beading sickenly warm droplets of blood on the surface. Behind her, a laugh was growing in Bellatrix’s chest, the amused, belly-deep laugh of the insane. As it spilled from her lips into Hermione’s ear, the shaking dug the knife ever further into her skin. Everyone was frozen, watching in shared mute horror as Remus held Harry back from the veil with sheer strength.</p>
<p>          And Hermione was still in danger.</p>
<p>          Bellatrix’s laugh finally settled to an amused chortle as she started dragging Hermione back towards the exit.</p>
<p>          “No,” Hermione said, trying to blink the blinding tears out of her eyes. “No!” she called.</p>
<p>          That finally caught the attention of the Order members. They quickly sprung into action, aiming their wands directly at the pair.</p>
<p>          Bellatrix wasn’t laughing anymore.</p>
<p>          “Stop, or she dies!” she boomed.</p>
<p>          Each and every person froze their movements as Bellatrix dug the knife further yet, cackling when Hermione’s mouth dropped open in a silent cry. The cut was streaming out warm blood, and Hermione was almost convinced her throat would be slit if it went any deeper.</p>
<p>          Bellatrix drug them closer still to the exit.</p>
<p>          “Hermione, no!” Harry yelled, struggling more against Remus, his tears flying off his face with the force of his jerks. “Let her go!”</p>
<p>        Bellatrix laughed her belly deep laugh. “I’m afraid not. The Dark Lord will have fun with this one! How does it feel, Potter, to lose your godfather and best friend...in the same night?”</p>
<p>          Harry growled - literally growled - and redoubled his struggles.</p>
<p>          Hermione was breathing as shallowly as she could, each inhale a deeper sting in her throat. She blinked away the last of her tears and the room came into focus once more. The veil, sitting tall on the dial in the center of the room, the people staring in wide-eyed horror as they watched their friend and comrade being dragged from the room by an insane Death Eater.</p>
<p>          Hermione caught Neville’s eye as she was pulled through the door. He was scared, she could just tell, but his face was determined, sending strength her way. Before she could decipher what it meant, she was pulled headfirst out of the room. The last thing she saw was Harry, pushing against Remus’s chest, still screaming for her.</p>
<p>                                                                                                                        *</p>
<p>	Hermione doubled over as far as she could, coughing out the ash she’d breathed in on her Floo trip to Malfoy Manor. When she’d heard the destination, her heart had sunk straight into the hearth. She’d heard Draco brag about it being unplottable for years and her hope of a rescue sunk ever lower. But then she’d remembered Neville’s silent support and determination that could only mean one thing - they were going to try their best to come for her.</p>
<p>        So she was going to try her very best to be alive when they arrived.</p>
<p>        Jeers met her ears as she was tugged, this time by the hair, to the utter relief of her windpipe, into what she assumed was a ballroom. Death Eaters lined the walls, all in black robes, and none with masks, to her relief. If - when - she got out of here, she’d be able to tell Dumbledore who the Death Eaters were. She then remembered Professor Snape and his spy status. Of course, Dumbledore already knew who the Death Eaters were - he had a spy in their ranks.</p>
<p>        Oh, but Professor Snape! If he were to come then maybe he’d take her away, and she’d be back at Hogwarts and not have dozens of leering men and women appraising her, looking her up and down with disgust in their eyes - but no. His spy status was worth more than just her life, she knew that. Even as it panged in her chest, she knew he wouldn’t - couldn’t - save her.</p>
<p>        That was okay, she told herself. She would be brave, she managed to convince herself. She’d be strong until either she found a way out (even then she knew it was more unlikely than a Blast-Ended Skrewt that didn’t explode) or someone came for her. She knew they’d try, oh yes, they’d try, even if just to keep Harry from going out on his own to get her. But would they succeed?</p>
<p>        Everything in Hermione froze as she took in the sight at the front of the room. Red eyes were among the sets appraising her. Red, red eyes. Eyes should never be that color, she thought, eyes should never be the color of blood, of murder, of anger.</p>
<p>        And then those eyes met hers.</p>
<p>        And the world exploded.</p>
<p>        Fire in her head, all thought vanishing except for how does Harry do this so often? Memories flashing through her mind, her and Harry and Ron sitting in the common room in their favorite chairs by the fire, her watching Harry with concern as he trudged into the Great Hall for breakfast, looking like he hadn’t slept at all, Harry screaming as Sirius fell through the veil, and of course, he wants information about Harry. She focused as much as she could and pushed with all her might against the slimy, disturbing, violating, huge presence in her mind. It disgusted her, and he felt that.</p>
<p>        As he left her mind, Hermione’s senses came back to her. She was on her knees in front of Bellatrix, being held up by her hair. That pain just managed to mingle with the new pain in her head. Voldemort was laughing, a high, cruel laugh that mixed with the Death Eater’s laughs reverberating around the room.</p>
<p>        “Well, well, Hermione.” Her name slithered out of his thin lips without permission. “I’m impressed. Shall we see what you know about about the infamous Order of the Phoenix? We will get to your lovely Mr. Potter soon, don’t worry. I do hope you know something of use,” he hissed.</p>
<p>        “I know many things, Tom, you’re going to have to be a bit more specific,” Hermione tossed out shakily. She was shocked at her own ability to speak calmly.</p>
<p>        Hisses and protests rang throughout the room until Voldemort raised his hand to silence them. He smirked down at her from his throne-like seat at the head of the room, making her stomach twist.</p>
<p>        “Dumbledore would be proud of you, no doubt. Just as disrespectful as Harry Potter. Surely you must know my name is Lord Voldemort? Harry is quite adamant about calling me Voldemort whenever he sees me. I will admit, it does grate on my nerves to hear my name coming from his mouth.” He leaned back in his seat. “I hope I can convince you to call me ‘my Lord’. I will not tolerate disrespect, Hermione. Say it. Say ‘my Lord’.”</p>
<p>        Hermione stared up at him with her chin raised, staring him in the eye. “I think Tom suits you better.”</p>
<p>        She was not prepared for what came next.</p>
<p>        White hot pain in every inch of her body, her mind going absolutely blank except for the agony coursing through her very veins. Some part of her recognized her own voice screaming as she’d never screamed before but she couldn’t have stopped it even if she’d wanted to. Her already aching head was going to explode, surely this was death, this sort of pain could only mean the end -</p>
<p>        And it was over. She lay with her cheek pressing down on the cold, hard floor, more laughter ringing out. I’d like to see you laugh after you feel that. Panting, she rose shakily to her knees and then her feet.</p>
<p>        “Definitely a Tom,” she said hoarsely.</p>
<p>        “You dare?” Bellatrix hissed. She snatched a handful of frizzy hair and yanked, tilting Hermione’s head back, exposing her bloody throat.</p>
<p>        “My faithful Death Eaters,” Voldemort called. “I think the Mudblood needs help loosening her tongue. Who will volunteer for this task?”</p>
<p>        “Me, my Lord,” Bellatrix called out in a husky voice. “I volunteer for this task.”</p>
<p>        Around the room, volunteers offered their services. Hermione shivered in horror at what was to come, though she couldn’t have known.</p>
<p>        “Dear Bellatrix,” Voldemort said in the warmest voice Hermione ever heard from his mouth. “You will start. Do what you must, but leave her eyes. I want to tell Potter that his Mudblood pet was looking at me when she finally succumbed to the torture.”</p>
<p>        “Anything, my Lord,” she simpered in a disgustingly sultry voice.</p>
<p>        She let go of Hermione’s hair with a shove and stepped around to face her. Hermione had to stuff down a whimper when the wicked silver knife came into view. Bellatrix smirked as she raised her wand, wordlessly creating tight ropes around Hermione, tying her arms to her torso and her legs together.</p>
<p>        With a shove to the shoulder, Hermione was flat on her back on the floor, a sick woman above her. Bellatrix straddled Hermione’s waist, lowly chuckling at the younger woman’s shudder.</p>
<p>        “This will be fun,” the madwoman intoned playfully. She raised her knife and waved it a few times before Hermione’s face before lowering the tip to her cheekbone.<br/>Resolution to be brave or not, when the blade cut through the skin to the bone, following it straight to her hairline, tears leaked out.</p>
<p>        “Ooooh,” Bellatrix cooed. “Crying already, are we, Mudblood?”</p>
<p>        “You all need to work on your insults. Do you think Mudblood is the worst thing I’ve been called today?” Hermione retorted, voice trembling.</p>
<p>        In retaliation, Bellatrix copied the movement on her other cheekbone. When the involuntary tears hit the cut it stung like lemon juice. She repeated the technique on her jawline, stopping on both sides before it could reach her chin. When she attacked halfway between her jaw and cheekbone, Hermione was terrified Bellatrix was going to cut through her cheek; she didn’t.</p>
<p>        Hermione was given six perfectly symmetrical cuts, but it wasn’t over yet.</p>
<p>        Bellatrix’s cold hands opened the buttons on her shirt slowly, so slowly. For the first time, Hermione thrashed in her bindings - no way was this happening, she was not going to be exposed in front of all of these people. The only thing her thrashing accomplished was to anger Bellatrix enough for her to rip the rest of the buttons off completely. The cold air that met her sweating skin was a relief even as dread filled her at the sound of wolf whistles.</p>
<p>       Bellatrix leaned her face close - too close - to Hermione’s and she cringed away.</p>
<p>       “Be still unless you want to be stuck with this knife!” she yelled. Spit flew from her mouth onto Hermione’s red face.</p>
<p>       “Patience, Bella,” Voldemort drawled. “You will get your chance.”</p>
<p>       Bellatrix leaned back. “Yes, my Lord.”</p>
<p>       She trailed the tip of her knife over each of Hermione’s collar bones, once again cutting down to the bone. Hermione’s breath hitched as cold fingers touched the blood dripping down her chest. The fingers went no further, but they were brought up to her forehead were her blood was smeared roughly across her skin.</p>
<p>       Her shirt was pushed to the side and the knife was drawn over each of her ribs. It crossed Hermione’s mind that Bellatrix was so insane she might just consider what she was doing to be art.</p>
<p>       Her hips were traced as well before she was blown over onto her stomach. Her breath was definitely coming faster now that she couldn’t see what was coming. Her shoulder blades and spine were traced as well, harder than anything on the front had been. Her tears were constantly coming now, mixing with the blood on the floor where her cheek was pressed.</p>
<p>       All of a sudden the tracing changed to drawing. She could tell it was runes that Bellatrix was drawing, but in her pain and fear addled mind she couldn’t focus on that. Focus. She needed to focus.</p>
<p>       She knew things that would have her killed in an instant after much worse torture than she was currently getting; she knew this. If Voldemort found out that she knew of his Horcruxes, and the fact that the Order was working towards locating and destroying the rest of them, she had absolutely no hope of escaping alive. She was already disfigured, but she only spared that a moment’s consideration.</p>
<p>        She needed to remember all she could about Occlumency. She’d never been taught, but she’d read about it in an attempt to help Harry (and out of curiosity if she was being honest), so she knew the theory. Now she just had to put it into action.</p>
<p>       Clear your mind.</p>
<p>       What did that even mean? Could ones mind even ever be clear? The brain never stopped working, so to clear it do you focus on just one thing?</p>
<p>       Hermione decided to try it.</p>
<p>       She focused on the Hogwarts library, walking through the shelves in each section, trying to remember as much as she could. When she had the image firmly in her mind she realized that that was the best she could do as pain seared her back that now had at least a dozen runes strewn down the skin in straight lines.</p>
<p>        She also realized that while holding the image in her mind, her breathing was deep and steady. Her fear had left her for a moment.</p>
<p>        When Bellatrix stood, laughter rang out. Hermione didn’t even want to know what was written on her skin.</p>
<p>        “Well done, Bella,” Voldemort congratulated. “You must be given extra points for creativity. Who is next?”</p>
<p>        And that was when the magical torture started. Harsh stinging hexes, slashing hexes that were healed to disgusting scabs before she could properly bleed out, potions that made the blood boil, then freeze, then boil again, and given the antidote before she died. Of course there was the Cruciatus as well, but the Death Eaters seemed to be competing for the most creative techniques.</p>
<p>        Some preferred Muggle methods; she now had no fingernails (her toenails were still intact, thank Merlin), a black eye, at least two broken or fractured ribs, still sluggishly bleeding wounds via Bellatrix’s knife, and had almost been drowned three times.</p>
<p>        It was just after the latest attempt to drown her that she lay unresponsive on the floor, breathing shallowly as not to aggravate her burning lungs.</p>
<p>        “Ah, well,” Voldemort said, mock sympathetically. “It seems we will have to reconvene tomorrow when all parties are...feeling up to it.”</p>
<p>        Hermione couldn’t stop shivering. Her throat was burning from both the potions they’d made her ingest and the water inhalation. In fact, there didn’t seem to be anywhere on her entire body that didn’t hurt. There was one thing she could think of that they hadn’t yet do, and she was praying to Merlin that they wouldn’t with all her might. She didn’t know what she would do if they took it, if they made her give it.</p>
<p>        “Take her to the cellar. Don’t let her die overnight,” Voldemort called to someone. Hermione didn’t see who, but when she was lifted up into the air she smelled it; musky cologne that on any other day she might have enjoyed, grass, and, oddly, roast beef. She wondered if this Death Eater had just come from dinner. The smell of one of her favorite foods in this place was sickening to her.</p>
<p>        She kept her eyes closed as she drifted out of the door and down a set of stairs. She could tell it was getting darker even through her closed lids, and the air was danker too. The smell of the man transporting her grew until that smell overpowered even the mildew of the cellar.</p>
<p>        She heard a lock click open and the grate of metal on metal as a door opened. She drifted inside and was unceremoniously dropped onto what felt like a pile of potato sacks.</p>
<p>        She felt someone lean close to her face and she recoiled as the smell of roast beef drew closer. It made her think of her mother even as it made the contents of her stomach curdle.</p>
<p>        “Looks like it’s just you and me, princess,” a deep, raspy voice spoke. “Don’t scream.”</p>
<p>        And then he took it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>	And so it continued. Every day she refused to speak, and every day Voldemort was shoved as unceremoniously out of her mind as she was dropped onto the ground at the end of the days torture session. Voldemort truly was an arrogant man, if he could indeed be called one. He spoke of how he would break her while his Death Eaters did the dirty work. And every night the man visited her. Sometimes Voldemort visited as well, just so he could spring a surprise attack on her when she woke up. He almost got information about the Horcruxes the first night, but after that Hermione only let herself drift off halfway. She knew she was weakening.</p>
<p>        And after a long, horrendous eight days, the end came.</p>
