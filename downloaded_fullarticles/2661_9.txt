    <p>“Newt, I’m home!” Tina called to the empty cottage. </p><p>	His reply was muffled. “In the case, dear!”</p><p>	She shed her coat, depositing it on the coat rack as she made her way toward the case and climbed down the ladder carefully. She snaked her arms around Newt from behind, kissing him on the cheek. “Hey.”</p><p>	He turned around smiling, pulling her to him and kissing her soundly. “Hello yourself. How was work?”</p><p>	She let her fingers brush his cheek ever so slightly as she pulled away. “It was good. Busy, but hopefully something will give soon.”</p><p>	He fiddled with his hands, looking down at the dirt under their feet. </p><p>	“What’s wrong?” She asked gently.</p><p>	“Dumbledore wants me to give a guest lecture to his class at Hogwarts.” He mumbled.</p><p>	Her face lit up. “That’s great! People are finally listening to what you have to say about these creatures.”</p><p>	“I’ve already drafted my letter of decline.”</p><p>	“Why?” Her face fell.</p><p>	He seemed to draw into himself- his shoulders tensed and his posture slumped. “I don’t do public speaking. I’ll just make a mess out of the whole thing.”</p><p>	She grabbed his hand, running her thumb over it soothingly. “Let’s put the kettle on and then we can talk about this over a cup of tea, hm?”</p><p>	He squeezed her hand back. “Alright. Let me finish up with the mooncalves and I’ll join you.”</p>
