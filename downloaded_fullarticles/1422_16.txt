          <div class="userstuff"><p>Dear Fred,</p><p>You're gone, and <em>blimey</em>... what am I supposed to do?</p><p>The business I can handle- Ron and Percy offered to lend a hand. And I guess I can handle comforting Mum and Dad, and protecting Ginny and Harry and Ron.</p><p>But living without you?</p><p>Bloody <em>hell</em>, Fred. How am I supposed to live without <em>you?</em></p><p>I didn't say it often, Fred, but I think we both knew: we understood each other, yeah? Never one without the other, two peas in a pod. Mum would always have us confused. Sometimes she still thinks I'm you.</p><p>You were my better half, Freddy. The only person I knew I could always count on. The only guy in our school that could give Umbridge as bad a scare as you did. </p><p>I have other brothers, but I only have one twin.</p><p>And that's you.</p><p>That <em>was</em> you.</p><p>I'm not going to be the same. But I'll keep the joke shop open. And I'll torment Percy as always. And I'll give Harry the big brother talk the day he marries Ginny.</p><p>But you gotta look after them, too, Fred. </p><p>I miss you, and I'll never forget you. (How could I? I have your face!)</p><p>Love you.</p><p> </p><p>George</p></div>
