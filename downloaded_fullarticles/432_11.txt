    <h1>PART I: The Potions Master and the Wolf</h1><p align="center">CHAPTER 1: Indoctrination</p><p>"Well done, Potter." Snape's drawl snapped him out of his reverie, and he sat 
up and looked around. "You have successfully rescued Professor Lupin from my 
evil clutches. I think it's time you went back to your dormitory."</p><p>"But--"</p><p>"It's all right, Harry," Lupin said, pressing a quick kiss to his temple and 
brushing the fringe out of his eyes. "It's getting late." He slid forward and 
set Harry gingerly on the floor before sprawling backwards over the table and 
throwing his arm over his eyes with a groan.</p><p>"Professor? What--"</p><p>"You heard him, Potter. Out." He cast a quick cleansing charm and a healing charm 
that left him slightly sore, but not aching. "In the future, I suggest you stay 
out of other people's business."</p><p>"But--" He glanced quickly at Professor Lupin. "Is he all right?"</p><p>"He's fine. Or will be shortly. Regardless, it isn't any of your 
concern."</p><p>Harry glared at Snape. "But it is my business--after--he just--you just--"</p><p>"After you were just raped by two grown men," Professor Lupin snapped. "Just put on your clothes and go."</p><p>"But," Harry said, not understanding.  He didn't know what <em>rape</em> was, not really, but he was pretty sure that girls got raped, not boys.  </p><p>"He could stay, Professor Lupin.  He could watch.  He could join in, if he wanted," Snape said, with a calculating look at Harry's naked body.  Harry shifted uncomfortably.</p><p>"We could rape him again, you mean," Lupin said bitterly.</p><p>But as Harry stood there hesitating, Snape walked up to him and touched his face.  Harry forced himself not to flinch.  "What's rape if he wants it, Remus?" Snape said silkily, not taking his eyes off Harry. </p><p>Harry swallowed.</p><p>Lupin finally moved his arm and turned his head to look at Harry.  "You're a good boy, Harry," he said.  "You don't want to do that again, do you?"</p><p>Snape huffed a laugh.  "We don't have to do it like that again, Potter.  There are...<em>other</em> things we could do."  This last was directed at Lupin, which was just as well, because Harry didn't know what he was talking about.  Lupin seemed to know, though, and he whimpered and covered his eyes again.</p><p>"Come, Potter," Snape said.  "Lupin wants something from you, but he's afraid to ask."</p><p>Snape put a firm hand on Harry's shoulder and guided him over to Lupin.  Harry only stumbled slightly.  Snape bent down and whispered in Harry's ear.  "Ask him what he wants, Potter."</p><p>Harry shuddered.  His arse clenched and he wasn't sure what he wanted himself, and didn't know if he should be afraid of what Lupin might want.  His eyes went to Lupin's cock, still exposed, and he felt himself getting hard again.  Harry swallowed.</p><p>"Ask him, Potter," Snape whispered again, and licked Harry's ear, making him shudder again.</p><p>"Sir?" Harry said uncertainly.  "Do you want something?"</p><p>Lupin moaned.  "Stop it, Severus," he said, but as Harry watched, Professor Lupin's cock started to get hard, too.</p><p>"He's afraid to ask for it," Snape whispered in Harry's ear again, and snaked his hand around to touch Harry's cock.</p><p>Harry made a choking sound.  "Sir?" he tried again. "Can I do something for you?"</p><p>Lupin looked at Snape.  "Please, stop."</p><p>Snape grinned.  "The boy wants to help you, Lupin, but he doesn't know how.  Tell him."  Snape continued to stroke Harry's cock, and then Harry startled slightly when Snape's other hand went to Harry's arse.  But instead of the huge pestle, Snape just slid cool fingers into his arse.  Harry sighed and wiggled into the sensation.</p><p>"Look at him, Lupin," Snape said.</p><p>Lupin looked in Harry's direction, but his eyes were focused on what Snape's hands were doing.  And then, as if Snape had been waiting for this, he moved his fingers just <em>so</em> and hit that same <em>something</em> inside of Harry that almost made his knees buckle.  Harry made an indecent sound, and he felt Lupin's eyes on his face.</p><p>"Harry," Lupin choked out, and Harry looked at him.  "Come here," he said.</p><p>Harry hesitated, but then Snape removed both of his hands, making Harry whimper.  Snape ignored this and pushed Harry forward.  Harry kept his eyes on Lupin's cock.</p><p>"Do you want to touch it?" Snape whispered in his ear.</p><p>Harry swallowed and nodded.  Snape licked a stripe on Harry's neck and bit down on his shoulder.  "Then do it," Snape said in a commanding voice.</p><p>Harry reached out a hand and touched Lupin's cock.  Lupin groaned and reached down to wrap his own hand around Harry's, guiding him in rhythmic strokes.  </p><p>"Harry," Lupin said, and Harry looked up into his eyes.  "Lick it," Lupin said.</p><p>Harry frowned, and Lupin groaned again.  "You're such a good boy, Harry," he said.  "Put your mouth on it."</p><p>Behind Harry, Snape laughed.  "I'll show him," Snape said, and walked around to the other side of the table.  Keeping his eyes on Harry, Snape <em>licked</em> up Lupin's cock and grinned at Harry while Lupin moaned and grabbed at Snape's hair.  And then Snape wrapped his lips around the tip of Lupin's cock and--never looking away from Harry--sank his head all the way down.  </p><p>Harry whimpered and grabbed his own cock.  Snape lifted his head and said sharply, "Don't touch yourself.  Only we can touch you while you're here."  Harry dropped his hands, and took an involuntary step closer to the table, facing Snape, with Lupin's cock between them.  </p><p>Lupin raised himself up onto his elbows.  "Do it," he said raggedly.</p><p>Snape locked his eyes with Harry's, and moved his mouth to Lupin's cock.  Harry moved closer, too, and Snape's eyes glittered.  "Do what I do," he said, and licked Lupin's cock again.</p><p>"Christ," Lupin muttered.</p><p>Harry stuck out his own tongue and slowly licked Lupin's cock.  It wasn't bad, and he went to do it again, and Snape joined him this time, licking the other side of Lupin's cock.  When they reached the tip, Snape kept going with his tongue and licked into Harry's mouth, grabbing Harry's head and kissing him hard. </p><p>It was Harry's first kiss, and it left him breathless and woozy.  And then Snape ended the kiss and pulled Harry's head toward Lupin's cock.  "Mind your teeth," Snape said, and Harry tried not to fight as Snape pushed his head down, but he was soon gagging and choking, until Snape muttered something that was probably a spell, and Harry found that he could take Lupin's cock all the way into the back of his throat.  </p><p>And then Snape's hands were gone, replaced by Lupin's, who kept saying "Good boy, good boy."  And then Snape grabbed Harry from behind, and without ceremony, Snape pushed his cock into Harry's arse, and it was almost welcome, and not nearly as painful as it had been the last time when there had already been a cock there, and it almost felt good, and Harry moaned on Lupin's cock and Lupin shuddered and came in Harry's mouth, and--that should probably have been weird, but Harry barely had time to think on it, barely registered the bitter taste--but Snape kept pounding into Harry's arse, and hit that <em>spot</em> again, and Harry yelled and came himself, and Snape kept pounding into him until he finished.</p><p>Lupin recovered first.  "Fuck," he said.</p><p>Shaky and unsure of himself, Harry didn't know what to say.  <em>Snape had been his first kiss, and he'd liked it.</em></p><p>Lupin seemed to see something in Harry's eyes, because he asked kindly, "That wasn't so bad, was it, Harry?"</p><p>Snape, still behind Harry, chuckled darkly.  "Indeed not," Snape said.  "The more we rape him, the easier it gets to rape him again."</p><p>"Boys can't get raped," Harry said, and he was pretty sure that was true until he turned and saw the look Professor Snape was giving him.  "Right, sir?" he added uncertainly.</p><p>"Call <em>him</em> 'sir.'  Call me 'Professor.'"</p><p>More uncertain that ever, Harry said, "Yes, Professor."</p><p>Snape smiled, almost cruelly.  This made Harry angry, so he said, "You kissed me."</p><p>Snape just blinked at him, and somehow Harry knew he'd broken form.  He corrected himself.  "You kissed me, Professor."</p><p>Snape smiled again, just as cruelly.  "I did."</p><p>"Probably the only part of this whole experience he understood," Lupin muttered.</p><p>"That's not true," Harry snapped, and he felt Professor Snape's hand clench on his shoulder.  "That's not true, sir," Harry corrected himself.</p><p>"Oh, Merlin, you're training him," Lupin said.</p><p>"And he's taking rather well to it, don't you think?" Snape said. "He always just needed something more productive to do with that mouth."  The hand on Harry's shoulder became a caress, and Harry found himself leaning into it.  Then Snape did something truly odd and kissed the top of Harry's head.  "I have an idea, Lupin," he said.  "<em>Incarcerous</em>."</p><p>Harry's hands were suddenly bound above his head.  Startled, he tried to move, but found that although his feet were still on the floor, his hands were bound to the ceiling.</p><p>"Sn--S--Professor?" he asked shakily.</p><p>"Good boy," Snape said, and sank to his knees and put his mouth around Harry's soft cock.  Harry squeaked as his cock started to get hard almost immediately.  </p><p>Not quite believing what was happening, Harry looked at Lupin.  "Lu--Pro--Sir?" he asked.</p><p>But then Snape manoeuvred Harry around so that his back was to Lupin.  Snape moved his mouth to lick at Harry's balls <em>fuck he licked Harry's balls fuck</em> and, with his hands, he pulled at Harry's arse.  Harry hoped he'd put in some fingers, but Snape's hands stayed away from his hole.</p><p>"Jesus fuck, Severus," Lupin said, from right behind Harry, and then Harry heard Lupin rustling around behind him, and then--and then--<em>Lupin was kissing his arsehole</em> while Snape held his cheeks open.  And then Lupin used his thumbs and his tongue to drive Harry crazy, as Snape continued to suck his cock, and Harry didn't know it was possible to feel all of this at the same time, and he didn't think he could come again, until he came.  Snape chuckled around his cock and licked him clean.</p><p>And then Harry's shoulders started to hurt, and he realised he was hanging from the ceiling and his legs couldn't support him at all.</p><p>"Good boy, Harry," Lupin said, as he helped Harry to his feet and cancelled the spell that tied him up.</p><p>"Shall we rape him a fourth time, or send him along?" Professor Snape asked, sounding bored.</p><p>Lupin shuddered, and Professor Snape smiled again, in a way that Harry found he almost liked.</p><p>"Ask Harry, then," Professor Snape said.</p><p>"Harry, was that so bad?"</p><p>"N--no, sir, it was good," Harry said.  He wasn't sure "good" was the right word--but it hadn't been <em>bad</em>, certainly.  But he was naked and Lupin and Professor Snape kept looking at him--and they didn't look angry with him--they looked almost pleased, but it wasn't the same look Uncle Vernon gave Dudley, not quite.  But it was better than the way Uncle Vernon looked at Harry, and better than the way Snape usually looked at him.  Besides, Snape and Lupin kept calling him a "good boy."  So Harry nodded and repeated firmly, "It was good."</p><p>"Would you like to do anything else?" Lupin asked kindly.</p><p>Harry hesitated.  Snape had kissed him, after all, but not Lupin.  It didn't seem fair.</p><p>"Harry?"</p><p>"Could you kiss me, sir?"</p><p>Lupin's eyes became unreadable and almost scary, but Harry didn't look away.  "I will kiss you, Harry, but you must do something for me."</p><p>This was a relief to Harry, who had thought for a moment that Lupin might say no.  "Anything, sir."</p><p>Snape came up behind Harry, and started running his hands up and down Harry's legs and thighs.  "Be careful what you promise him, Potter.  He pretends to kindness, but he can be more cruel than I."  But even as Snape said this, he licked the nape of Harry's neck, and slipped one hand down Harry's arse.  Harry arched into it without thinking, and Snape laughed and slipped a finger inside Harry.  "Lupin," Snape said, as if something had just occurred to him. "He's such a sweet fuck."  And he slipped in another finger, and Harry ground back against him.  "Ask him for anything, he'll give it to you."  </p><p>"And if I ask if Severus and I can both fuck you at the same time again?  Would you like that, Harry?"</p><p>"Yes, sir," Harry gasped, and Snape bit his shoulder.  "But you'll kiss me, right?"</p><p>"Of course, Harry." Lupin said, his voice hard.  "But won't it hurt you, if we both fuck you again?"</p><p>Harry hesitated.  "It might hurt, but I can handle it."  He tried to hold Lupin's eyes, but Snape's fingers were very distracting.</p><p>"I want him on all fours," Lupin said to Snape.</p><p>"Of course you do," Snape said.  "Kiss him first."</p><p>"I'll kiss him after," Lupin said coldly.</p><p>"You'll kiss him now," Snape said, and, as if to demonstrate, he moved around Harry, and, still moving his fingers inside of Harry, he kissed him, slow and sweet, using his tongue.  Harry melted into it, rocking back against the fingers inside of him and eagerly kissing Snape back.  Snape finally broke the kiss and kept his eyes on Harry, but addressed Lupin.  "He's ours now, Lupin.  He'll let us do anything to him.  But he wants a kiss, and you will give it to him."</p><p>"I'm not--" Harry began, but Snape kissed him again, and he forgot what he was going to say.  </p><p>Snape broke the kiss pulled out his fingers.  Harry was about to protest, but Snape was moving--he guided Harry firmly over to Lupin, who was looking at Snape with such a cold look in his eyes that Harry looked down.  He found himself looking at Lupin's cock, which was jutting out from his robes, hard as ever.  </p><p>"Tell him, Potter," Snape whispered in his ear.  "Tell him what you want."</p><p>"I--" Harry said.  He couldn't remember much right now.  He wanted Lupin to look at him and call him <em>good boy</em>--</p><p>"Will you get on your hands and knees for Professor Lupin, Potter?"</p><p>Harry nodded--it was such a simple thing--of course he would do it--and he started to kneel down, but Snape's hands gripped his shoulders and kept him standing up.</p><p>"Do you want Professor Lupin to kiss you first, Potter?"</p><p>"Yes," Harry said, even though he didn't really care about the order.</p><p>"Ask him," Snape whispered in Harry's ear.</p><p>"Please--please sir, would you kiss me?"</p><p>And suddenly, Professor Lupin was all over Harry, kissing his eyes, his cheeks, his neck, running his hands through his hair, then down his back, slipping his fingers in Harry's arse, then finally--finally--kissing Harry on the mouth.  Harry whimpered and opened his mouth wide and did his best to kiss back--and it was wonderful, to feel wanted--</p><p>But before Harry was done with the kiss, Lupin pulled away, turned Harry around, and shoved him down on the floor.  Harry was confused, but remembered that he was supposed to be on his hands and knees--but Lupin had already pushed his knees farther apart and knelt down over Harry and shoved his cock into Harry's arse.</p><p>It was shocking, even after everything that had happened tonight--but the most shocking thing, really, was how much <em>deeper</em> Lupin's cock could get when Harry was in this position.  It hurt, but not nearly as bad as it had when it had been Lupin and Snape's cocks both in him, and not even as bad as when it had been the pestle.  And Harry was starting to think that he really liked this particular kind of hurting, anyway.  When Lupin pulled out and shoved back in, Harry shoved his own arse back to meet him halfway.  It sparked that spot inside of Harry, and he cried out.  Then Lupin growled and did it again, and Harry did it again, too, and they worked together that way, faster and faster, until Harry couldn't keep up the rhythm, so he sank down to his elbows, arse still in the air, and let Lupin do all the work.  But then a hand was in his hair, yanking his head up.  </p><p>"Potter," Snape said, and Harry looked up to see Snape's cock, just in front of his face, and Snape's hand--the one not gripping his hair--was working his cock furiously.</p><p>It should have been weird, probably, but instead it was...mesmerising.  "Pro--profess--sir," Harry stuttered, as Lupin continued to pound into his arse, and Harry couldn't take his eyes off Snape's cock as he wanked, right there, right in front of Harry, and Lupin hit that spot again, and--</p><p>"Oh," Harry said, and Snape tightened his grip on Harry's hair and came.  The mess shot all over Harry's face.  It should have been weird, but instead it made Harry come instantly, his arse clenching around Lupin's cock, and Lupin's movements became more desperate and he howled and came, too.</p><p>Harry went limp and felt rubbery and worn-out, and not a little sore, but so, so...</p><p>He didn't know what he felt, really.  He was barely aware of his own limbs, let alone his feelings.  <em>This should be weird,</em> he thought.  But it wasn't so much weird as it was...unexpected?--</p><p>But then he realised that he was naked on the floor of the Potions classroom and Lupin was licking Snape's come off his face.  Harry turned slightly, and met Lupin's mouth with his own.  And Lupin, <em>thank goodness</em>, kissed Harry back eagerly.  He tasted odd--like Snape's come, Harry supposed, which tasted a lot like Lupin's come, but different somehow--smokier, maybe?  Then Lupin broke the kiss and continued to lick Harry's face. </p><p>"Christ," Snape said.  And then he stood up gingerly and tucked himself away into his robes.  He rolled his shoulders, and looked down at Harry, catching him staring.   But Harry couldn't look away.  Snape suddenly looked like...Professor Snape again--and that was the single weirdest thing that had happened all evening.  <em>That man had been Harry's first kiss.</em>  Meanwhile, Lupin started licking Harry's neck.</p><p>"What do you say, Potter?" Snape said, in his bored voice again.</p><p>Harry wasn't sure, but he tried to guess.  "Thank you, Professor."</p><p>"Not to me," Snape snapped.  "What do you say to Professor Lupin, Potter?"</p><p>"Thank you, sir," Harry said dutifully, still not looking away from Snape.</p><p>Lupin touched Harry's face, and kissed his lips tenderly.  "Don't tell your friends," he said.  "And come back to us tomorrow night."</p><p>Harry looked back at Snape.  "Yes, sir," Harry whispered.  Snape narrowed his eyes and walked away.  Harry sighed.  It would have been nice to be called a "good boy" again.</p><p align="center"> *</p><p>After Harry left, Remus felt doubt settle in.  "What have we done, Severus?" Remus whispered.</p><p>"We just thoroughly debauched a thirteen-year-old boy," Severus said easily.  "And we liked it, and we'll probably do it again tomorrow."</p><p>"I won't," Remus said.</p><p>Severus just looked at him.</p><p>"I won't," Remus repeated.  "That was James's son, Severus.  I held him when he was a baby."</p><p>"And you have now come inside his arse, as well as in his mouth."</p><p>"Stop it."</p><p>"You've put your tongue in his arse."</p><p>Remus rubbed his face.</p><p>"And then you kissed him," Severus said.  "Because he begged you to."</p><p>"That's Lily's son, too, you know."</p><p>"And Lily is dead," Severus said harshly.  "As is James.  And Harry is alive."</p><p>"Harry is thirteen."</p><p>Severus snorted.  "Your guilt always arrives late to the party, Lupin.  Potter will be back here tomorrow night.  Feel free to spend the evening in your own office, if you wish.  I will, of course, not turn away your company, any more than I will turn away Potter's."</p><p>"You <em>enjoyed</em> raping him," Remus spat.</p><p>Severus moved for the first time since Harry left, and grabbed Remus around the throat.  "I did," he growled.  "You enjoyed it, too.  He even <em>thanked</em> us, afterwards."</p><p>Remus gasped, and Severus let go of his throat.  "Go," Severus said.  "Take your crisis of conscience and leave these rooms."</p><p>"You intend to rape him again?"</p><p>"I intend to take whatever he offers."</p><p>And the impact of what they'd done hit Remus in the chest.  "He'll offer anything," he said shakily.</p><p>Snape flashed a deadly smile.  "He will.  And as I say, I will take it."</p>
