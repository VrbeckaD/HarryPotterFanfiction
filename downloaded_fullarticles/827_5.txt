  <strong>Chapter One: Death’s Birth Day Musings</strong>
</p><p>            It wasn’t necessary, strictly speaking, for him to observe a mortal’s life chronologically. In fact, as so many people lived mundane lives, they lived lifetimes with little variation across a plethora of worlds regardless of whatever vagaries of magic or science made each of the universes unique in and of itself. When it came time for Death to usher a soul into either an echoing world or the next great adventure, he could review the life at will. Thus, chronological (let alone synchronous) observance seemed an unnecessary indulgence for the entity.</p><p>            More to the point, this particular soul had the habit (sometimes to Death’s chagrin, often to his delight, and generally to his (and every mortal’s) benefit) of popping up all over the universes. She’d already been in this particular Earth eight times already. Death, in other days, might have been annoyed at the level of attention she was attracting on yet another entry into a world. But today he was feeling a bit indulgent to the girl who was experiencing a true first. Death could justify the unusual level of observance this once.</p><p>            Despite her omnipresence across the universes, she’d only ever been <em>born</em> one time. She lived no mundane repeat life on any planet. She began, unlike almost everyone else, in only one place, and that was here, on Death’s thirteenth created world. And so Death watched eagerly from the metaplane just next to existence and scarcely past his veil as, screaming and undignified, this soul made her presence known.</p><p>            Death rarely stopped to fully observe birth, despite the necessity of birth in the grand order of things, but he took time for the full course today. If only his dear friend could see herself now, he thought with what others might call glee.</p><p>            Knowing her name was a foregone conclusion, Death watched in amusement as mother and father debated her immortal moniker. So few people realized that the original name of a soul was with that soul forever and often named their tiny humans according to fads or trends. These two were at least basing it off of tradition. Lily, daughter of Iris and sister of Petunia, felt that their daughter should be called something flowery. Sirius, despite his antagonism for many of the Blacks he grew up with, still felt compelled to call his progeny for the landmarks of the firmament. He’d actually researched the Black family for generations in an attempt to find details to discomfit his mother and had been surprised to learn that the asterally based names traced back to the earliest record of a Black at the time of the Founders of Hogwarts. As he said to his wife, how could he deny a near millennium of tradition?</p><p>            His argument was eventually deemed the more pressing and Lily conceded. She did insist on choosing a name that nobody in recent memory had borne (heaven forbid their child feel any kinship to dear cousin Bellatrix). In fact, she ended up choosing the star that hadn’t been picked in centuries (since the Founders themselves, Death knew, and he found the irony delicious).</p><p>            Spica Lilac Black. There was the beginning of a name that, though unknown to most mortals all galaxies over, would shape millions of lives and even more deaths.</p><p>            Having graced her illustrious birth with his almost presence, Death desisted from his keen scrutinizing (he already knew what color her eyes would be when they settled down from the generic blue of newborns and felt no need to listen to the young couple’s cheerful bickering) and so took himself off for other duties. He had so many souls to usher on since that meddlesome Tom Riddle hadn’t contented himself with merely upsetting nature’s balance with his vile horcruxes but was insisting on hastening the funerals of far too many others. Death would check back in when things got interesting again.</p>
<hr/><p>            Over the next fifteen months, Death popped in to look over the small Black family and young Spica at least once a month. Sometimes he saw mundane little details but often he managed to happen upon moments that he felt were prologue to the future adventures of his old friend. One day he caught Lily singing a lullaby taught to her by Andromeda Black; he knew that lullaby would be sung to all of Spica’s children, whatever the universe. Another day he caught Spica's first laugh. Nominally the most important moment he’d caught was when Albus Dumbledore came to Sirius and Lily Black with a warning about a recently overheard prophecy.</p><p>            Sirius and Lily were aghast and frightened by the fact that the wizard who had disrupted their childhood and whom they both diligently fought against was coming after their baby. Sirius had cursed at Dumbledore, Lily had held her daughter very close, and a series of plans to hide the Blacks from Tom Riddle were devised.</p><p>            James Potter, inheritor of one of Death’s three hallows, came by to offer comfort to his friends and distraction for the baby. Death watched with amusement as James entertained his young goddaughter by playing hide and seek with his invisibility cloak. The infant was enthralled with the smooth fabric, giggling uncontrollably whenever she managed to touch it. Death had long suspected that his master held a special fondness for this cloak over the other hallows—definitely over the wand—and it had seemed that this fascination had started early.</p><p>           Death felt a pang of sorrow for these young and vibrant lives, lives he knew were soon to meet violent ends. But he couldn't interfere. For multiple reasons—most of which would be solved by having a master to work with—but especially because these moments were crucial in providing the master he needed. Death busied himself with collecting more and more souls as All Hallow's Eve grew closer and closer.</p><p>          The Blacks, after months of more transitive hiding, went under the Fidelius Charm. James Potter, best friend, brother, and godfather to the little family became the Secret Keeper. Dumbledore sought vainly to understand the power of the Cloak of Invisibility, convincing himself that the fabled Mastery of Death might be what the prophecy was alluding to. Remus Lupin continued to spy on Riddle's group of werewolf allies. Severus Snape continued to spy on Death Eaters while telling Riddle information carefully concocted with Dumbledore, desperate to somehow save Lily Evans. Peter Pettigrew grew even more desperate to escape Riddle's negative attention through offering up one great final reward.</p><p>          As October 31 dawned in Great Britain, Death stood on standby. He had some very important souls to collect today. Later historians would fail to grasp exactly how early in the day the critical events came into play. In the dawn's light Peter Pettigrew and the other Death Eaters planned their assault on muggles and bloodtraitors, excited to use the muggle traditions of costumes and revelry as cover for their own assaults.</p><p>         Pettigrew, reveling in his important information, told Voldemort that he knew how to deliver the Blacks to him. It was only a small gathering at this point. Pettigrew had been anxious to impress but had not been permitted to speak in front of the whole inner circle. Only a few of Tom Riddle's favorites—Bellatrix, Lucius, the Lestrange brothers, Augustus—were there to listen as Riddle debated the merits of the pureblooded Longbottom heir over the halfblood (but now suddenly graspable) baby Black. In the end, Pettigrew led his mad master to the hiding place of one James Potter.</p><p>         The last Ignotus Peverell descendant was loyal. He would die before betraying his friends. Sirius and Lily had chosen well in that regard. James Potter would never imagine that a close friend could betray him. Death watched as James realized that Peter had brought Voldemort to his home. Death was impressed. Perhaps in another situation, this Peverell would have been the one to gather all the Hallows. He had the courage to stand firm in his love even in the face of great betrayal, hatred, and pain. He could have been a good Master of Death. But that was not to be his fate. Death watched as the magic of this night and the critical choices of seven powerful wizards all came into play. </p><p>        There was after all, a flaw in the Fidelius charm. In the end, James Potter—battered, broken, and bloody—did not have to tell the Secret. Defiantly, James Potter pulled himself upright. He was wandless. He was injured, he was nearly dead. Still, he stared at Voldemort and defied him again.</p><p>        "I will die before I tell you where Sirius and Lily are. They are my family."</p><p>        Tom Riddle laughed, high, clear, and cruel. "How much faith you place in friendship, Potter." Here Riddle twitched his wand, yanking Pettigrew out of the dark corner he was cowering in as his longtime friend was tortured. For one terrible moment, James and Peter met eyes. "Even when you see that others will betray you. Wormtail—that is what you call him isn't it?" Riddle asked with faux solicitousness. "Wormtail here is happy enough to give you up to save his own life. He is wiser than you. What do you think your death will prove? I'll still find them. When Wormtail first told me the Blacks were going to hide under the Fidelius charm, I researched it. Rookwood was eager to tell me all about it. When the Secret Keeper dies, every individual who knew this Secret becomes a Secret Keeper. And I have the feeling that you told it to Wormtail, didn't you?"</p><p>        For one last moment, the two childhood friends had similar reactions. Both felt horror as this news came out. But Wormtail masked his quickly after a fleeting look at his chosen master. Death watched as both once friends turned their horror into resolve. Both had, after all, chosen their paths.</p><p>        "Goodbye, James Potter. But let it not be imagined that Lord Voldemort is not merciful. Your <em>family</em> will be joining you shortly." James Potter fell with the final flash of spellwork as if a marionette who had lost its strings. Dispassionately, Tom Riddle turned to the still cowering Pettigrew.</p><p>       "Now, my <em>faithful</em> servant, where do the Blacks live?"</p>
<hr/><p>        Sirius Black fell quickly to Voldemort's wand. Voldemort barely spared a few moments to taunt that James Potter was dead and Pettigrew had betrayed him before cutting down the last son of the House of Black. Riddle was far too impatient to get rid of this ridiculous prophesied destruction. Death knew that Riddle thought he would further defy his doom by turning the murder of a child into his sixth and final horcrux. Stepping over Black's splayed body, Tom Riddle climbed the cottage stairs, towards the nursery where Lily Black could be heard desperately trying to barricade the door.</p><p>       Voldemort laughed at the paltry defenses, blasting through them with ease. Death watched with interest. He knew the basics of why Spica Black had managed to defeat death at fifteen months old, but, just as he'd watched her birth with invested interest, he would watch the entirety of this scene. Lily Black dropped her child in the crib behind her before facing Riddle.</p><p>       "Stand aside," Riddle uttered, eager to get the woman out of the way. Death knew this option to step aside was out of character for a man who would rather cut down obstacles than take a moment to move them out of his way. But Riddle, so grateful for Severus' report of a way to get rid of all of his competition had promised that he'd spare the woman's life. Death hovered as close to his young future master as he could from the next reality, feeling so grateful for the three adults who were giving their lives for this little girl. In the millennia he had worked with Spica he had not realized how fond he had grown of her. If Lily backed down, Spica would die and Death would lose his master apprentice, rewriting all the history of a thousand lives. After all, choices were the crux of the matter. </p><p>       But Lily did not back down. "Take me instead," she plead.</p><p>       "Very well," said Riddle, not even realizing that he'd changed the terms of the promise he had made to Severus. Riddle had offered Severus Lily's life in exchange for the prophecy. And now he offered Lily her daughter's life in exchange for hers. Despite how Riddle thought that with his horcruxes he had a deeper understanding of death than any other, Death knew his understanding to be paltry. The why a someone died mattered. It mattered enormously. Souls lived eternally and how they lived and how they died rippled out, influencing fate itself. The self-proclaimed Voldemort killed Lily Evans Black. And then, disregarding the death promises he had made, he tried to kill Spica.</p><p>      The nursery exploded around Tom Riddle. Spica was shielded by the love of her mother, by the love of her father and godfather, by the love of those who had been given a choice to save their own lives but instead chose to save hers. Death writhed briefly in anger that he couldn't collect Tom Riddle's soul. Instead, most of Riddle's mutilated soul fled away as Riddle's body tore itself apart. The little girl, who had been strangely quiet during her mother's final confrontation, at last started to wail, her forehead bleeding as a sliver of Riddle's soul took root in the lightening bolt cut. Death was surprised at his own desire to suddenly breach the partition between his metaplane and the plane of the mortals simply so he could pick up the child and comfort it. Spica Black truly had wormed her way into his heart, he realized. But he could not. The whole reason he needed a master was to have someone interfere in the realm of the mortals.</p><p>      Powerless to hold the crying child, Death still lingered by. He watched as the cowardly Pettigrew scampered into the destroyed house. The rat transformed into a man, looking with horror at the torn robes and discarded yew wand that was all that marked where Voldemort had stood. Studiously ignoring the sight of his old friend's corpse or the crying child, Pettigrew stooped up and picked up Voldemort's wand. Then, looking furtively around as if someone would witness this act of loyalty to Tom Riddle, he quickly transformed back into a rat and scampered away.</p><p>      Someone would come to find the child soon Death knew. After all, the explosion of power that had destroyed Riddle's body had also sent out a shock wave to all bound to the man through the Dark Mark. Dark detectors and other instruments would register the explosion and then the absence of the malevolent power. Those who had been under the control of Voldemort's imperius curses would be coming to themselves. But Death could not leave the screaming child, even as he was powerless to defend her. There had to be something he could do, though.</p><p>      The idea did not come instantly, but Death did eventually conclude that he might be able to bend the usual rules a little bit. After all, Spica Black, by dint of inheriting all of James Potter's possessions as his only goddaughter, had just become the technical owner of her first Hallow. She might be sensitive to a whisper from the other side.</p><p>      Hesitantly, Death began to sing the lullaby Lily Black had sung to her daughter every night. Death was no singer, and his voice lacked the sweetness of her mother's. However, Death realized, as he sang, that he felt the same sentiment for the child as Lily Black had as she sang the song. The tune was familiar to the black-haired baby. Spica looked around as the first line of the chorus began, <em>"I'm glad that you were born, Born to laugh, Born to dream, Born to spread your light..."</em> Death was not exactly human, not exactly designed to smile. But as the little girl stopped crying in favor of clinging to the bars of her crib, looking down at her still mother while listening to her mother's song, Death managed a strange approximation of a wry smile. Though they had been master and apprentice for ages, this was in many ways the true beginning of Death and his Master, Spica Lilac Black.</p>
