    <p>The smell of pencil dust and brand-new history textbooks wafted through the early morning breeze as Ron and Ginny Weasley stood on the pavement outside Warrensburg High School. The word “pavement” is a word used in the United Kingdom to describe a path that is paved for pedestrians on the side of a road. Although it was the precise word that the two Weasleys were thinking of, it is a word that would be considered incorrect in this context. This is because Ron and Ginny Weasley were about to walk into their first day of American public high school, something they were both anxiously awaiting.</p><p>Ron was gripping the straps of his backpack with anticipation and had a bounce in his step as he made his way towards the front doors. This year would be better than last; he was sure of it. He could feel his insides bubbling with excitement; he thought he might explode if he had to wait any longer.</p><p>Ginny was also gripping the straps of her backpack, for if she held on tight enough she might be able to dissipate through sheer force of will. As she walked next to her brother, her feet barely touched the ground, for her heart was beating so quickly against her chest that she thought her ribs might crack. This year had so much potential to be worse than the last. She could feel her insides bubbling like sparkling cider; she thought she might throw up.</p><p>“I think I might throw up,” Ginny said, as they pushed open the double doors and were immediately thrown into the hustle and bustle of students rushing around the school and chatting with their friends. Warrensburg High School was a large school with many students, resulting in many traffic jams both in the parking lots and in the hallways.</p><p>“Oh, come on, Ginny,” Ron smiled. “Don’t be such a Negative Nancy.”</p><p>“I am not!” she protested. A Negative Nancy is someone who is frequently a downer, no matter if their name is Nancy or not. Ron was oftentimes a Negative Nancy himself, especially when it came to educational matters. Today he was quite the opposite.</p><p><em> Who are you, and what have you done with my brother? </em>Ginny thought, pondering the terrifying prospect of Ron acting the role of the golden child. Now she really was going to throw up.</p><p>A cacophonous crumpling noise sounded over the crowd streaming around them, snapping Ginny out of her speculation. Next to her, Ron had pulled an extraordinarily wrinkled piece of paper out of his pocket, covered in coffee stains and god-knows-what. It hardly even looked like paper at all.</p><p>“Ron, what is that?” Ginny glowered.</p><p>“It’s my schedule.”</p><p>“No, it’s disgusting.”</p><p>He scrunched his face mockingly in response, still looking at his schedule. “So, my first class is… calculus. Well, that’s just great. What about you, Gin?”</p><p>“I’ve got drawing and painting.”</p><p>“Since when do you do art?” Ron asked.</p><p>“Since two fine arts credits are required to graduate high school,” she replied. Art had never been Ginny’s specialty.</p><p>Ron glanced again at his sully parchment. “Math is in the east wing, and I think the art department is on the way. I can walk you to class if—”</p><p>“No!” Ginny spat. “I don’t want my loser older brother walking me to class on the first day of school.”</p><p>An intense ring suddenly vibrated through the walls. It was the warning bell, which rang at precisely eight-thirty-five every morning, and gave both Weasleys a shock. However, the crowd around them brushed it off nonchalantly and began to break off from their packs, hurrying off to their respective classes.</p><p>Backing away, Ron turned towards his sister. “Well, good luck finding your class on your own then.” And with that, he slipped into the horde of students.</p><p>The hallways were cleared in a matter of a minute, and Ginny was left standing by herself, which was the exact opposite of what she wanted.</p><p><em> Shit. </em> She had come to the full realization that she had absolutely no idea where to find her class. This school was much bigger than her old school, in terms of population and square footage. Not to mention, it was built like a labyrinth of sorts, with hallways that winded back on each other and far too many stairwells for one building alone. Ginny was essentially stuck in the middle of a difficult maze with five minutes to get to her first-period class wondering why she hadn’t just let her brother show her the way. And, as any person who has ever been in a situation much like Ginny’s would know, Ginny had absolutely no idea what to do next.</p><p>She remembered before she’d stepped onto the bus, her mom had told her to stick with her brother and not get into trouble. As if she couldn’t find her classes on her own! She was sixteen years old. She could drive. She was a junior in high school, whatever that meant. She didn’t need to be babysitted. And with that Ginny stormed down the hall, determined to find her way.</p><p> </p><p>No matter how much determination someone has, it is almost impossible to find anything when one hasn’t the slightest idea of where they’re supposed to go, and Ginny didn’t even know what floor she was supposed to be on. Her backpack was already beginning to give her shoulders knots. She knew she had passed through the science hallways because of the painted DNA strands on the walls, and she was pretty sure that the far end of the second and third floors was all English classes. Aside from that, every hallway looked exactly the same as the last, as if she was stuck in a time loop. For a second, she actually wondered if she was stuck in a time loop.</p><p>As she walked past the same bathroom for the fourth time, she heard voices echoing from the stairwells. Asking strangers for directions would make Ginny look like a total noob, which is a term many youths use to refer to someone who is not only new but also lacking in intelligence. It is one of the many labels Ginny did not want to be put on herself, but she also didn’t want to be caught ditching class. That would make her mother furious, and herself grounded.</p><p>The voices grew louder the closer she got, and more comprehensible.</p><p>“Oh, are you Potter’s little friend now?” It was a sharp, pitchy voice, definitely belonging to a teenage boy. And an annoying one, at that. “That’s real cute, Longbottom.”</p><p>Ginny frowned. The more comprehensible the boy’s voice became, the less his words were.</p><p>“Yeah, I am his friend,” clumsily quipped another boy, likely Longbottom. “Unlike you, I actually have friends.”</p><p>She hovered in the entryway of the stairwell, brushing the doorframe with her fingers. Lifting herself up on her toes, she peered over the railing to view the boys, who were on the platform that separated the flights of stairs.</p><p>The boy who presumably was the one with the annoying voice was slim, blonde, and was holding the other boy up against the brick wall by his sweater. Behind him stood two boys much larger than he was, more intimidating. Neither of them were blonde.</p><p>“I have two friends standing right behind me, dumbass,” he said, tightening his grip on the Longbottom’s sweater.</p><p>“Who, Crabbe and Goyle? You mean your goons?” the boy said.</p><p>The one Ginny assumed was Goyle, but could have been Crabbe, lurched forward, holding his fist but a hair away from Longbottom’s nose. The blonde made a snarky remark, and the other goon, who Ginny assumed was Crabbe, chuckled, but all of it was beginning to blur together in Ginny’s mind.</p><p>If you’ve ever had a bad day, you would know how frustrating bad days are. Ginny hadn’t even arrived at her first-period class yet, and she was already having a quite a bad day. She was incredibley frustrated. She wasn’t even sure about what. It could’ve been that she’d regretted neglecting directions from Ron, or that her mom assumed she’d get lost, or possibly the fact that she was completely and utterly astray, a word that here means Ginny was, in fact, lost. It could’ve also been that a seemingly kind guy was getting beat up by a bunch of idiots. It could’ve been all these things combined, and it could’ve been none of them at all. But something pushed all the thoughts out of Ginny’s brain and let all of the boys’ words go in one of her ears and fly out the other. She didn’t remember going down the stairs, or grabbing the blond’s arm and yanking him off the boy named Longbottom. She could only vaguely recall him laughing at her before she turned the tables on him, and shoved him up against the wall himself. She hardly retained his words when he told her she was “acting like a bitch.” When she tossled him back against the bricks again, her face landed less than an inch from his, and he asked her if she was “trying to make out with him or something? Can’t blame you,” she remembered that vividly, for she had to resist the urge to smash his head in right then and there. However, what she remembered best was how the hairs on the back of her neck stood up when she heard the sound of a woman behind her clearing her throat.</p><p>She released her grip on the boy and turned around to see a stern woman with a tight bun staring back at her. She wore a maroon lanyard around her neck, with an ID dangling on the end, indicating that she was a member of the school administration.</p><p>“I—” Ginny began to defend herself, but couldn’t think of anything to save herself now.</p><p>“She was just trying to help me!” Longbottom blurted.</p><p>“He’s lying!” the blonde abruptly contradicted. “Freckle-face here is crazy! She just came out of nowhere and attacked me!”</p><p>“That’s not true!”</p><p>“Oh, yes it is!”</p><p>The two boys shouted over each other with defenses and accusations so quickly that neither Ginny nor the woman who was most likely about to give Ginny detention could hear either of them.</p><p>“Enough,” the woman silenced them. “Miss—what is your name, dear?”</p><p>“Ginny Weasley,” she said, trying to stand tall and appear responsible despite the fact that she had been about to beat the living daylight out of another student.</p><p>“Hah!” the boy cackled. “Weasley? That’s the stupidest name I’ve ever heard.”</p><p>“Oh, because Malfoy is such a charmer,” the other boy said.</p><p>“As I was saying,” the woman interrupted again. “Miss Weasley and Mr. Malfoy, you will report to detention after school today.”</p><p>She began to walk away from them.</p><p>Malfoy’s jaw dropped open. “But Ms. McGonagall, I didn’t do anything.”</p><p>“Oh, I think we both know that you did,” she said, looking at them over her shoulder. “You should all get to class now.”</p><p>They stood in silence.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>Malfoy swung his backpack onto his shoulder and scrambled up the stairs. McGonagall rolled her eyes and strode off in the other direction.</p><p>Ginny twisted around to see Longbottom still slouched on the ground. He had a round face, kind eyes, and was wearing a Marvel t-shirt. Ginny thought that he ought to be better than that Malfoy kid by the dozen.</p><p>“Hey,” Ginny reached out to him. “You look like you could use one.”</p><p>“One what?” he asked.</p><p>“A hand.”</p><p>He took her hand, and he hefted himself off the ground. “Thanks…. For the hand, and for defending me.”</p><p>“No problem. I’m Ginny,” she said.</p><p>“I know,” he said. Ginny furrowed her brows. “Not because I’m a stalker, which I’m not. You just told McGonagall a second ago. I’m Neville. Thank you for not letting Malfoy beat me up.”</p><p>“You already said that,” she smiled.</p><p>“It seemed like it was worth saying again,” he smirked sheepishly. “I wish there was someway better to thank you.”</p><p>“Actually,” Ginny said, remembering why she’d approached him in the first place. “I’m a bit lost. Very lost. Could you maybe show me where to find my art class? I’ve got Ms. Burbage as a teacher. You don’t have to, though. You’re probably late, too.”</p><p>“No, I’ve got a study hall first hour,” he replied. “And I know exactly where that is. My friend Luna is in your class.”</p><p>“Oh, that awesome,” Ginny said, and the waltzed down the stairs side by side. Although her day had been going bad, she was now very happy, because she had hopefully made a friend, and a good friend can always make a bad day much better.</p><p> </p><p>They rounded a corner, into a hall that Ginny hadn’t even passed through. They had spent their journey chatting about how the school was impossible to navigate. Neville had said that his freshman year he hadn’t been able to find his classes for weeks. He’d said that she’d like it here though. The American public high school experience could be hellish, but it was hellish in a particularly entertaining and comical way.</p><p>“So, who was that guy?” Ginny asked him.</p><p>“What guy? Oh, Draco Malfoy?” he answered. She nodded. “He’s horrible. His dad is loaded, so he lives in this huge house in Rolling Blue, which is also known as the Country Club District. It’s basically where all the rich people live. Anyways, the Malfoys are the worst. We hate them.”</p><p>“I can get on board with that,” she agreed.</p><p>“Here we are,” Neville gestured to a door decorated with doodles of dragonflies and flowers. “Don’t worry, though. Burbage is cool, she probably won’t mark you tardy if you tell her you got lost. It is your first day, after all.”</p><p>“Thanks for helping me find my class.”</p><p>“It’s the least I could do,” he opened the door for her. “And look, there’s still a spot open next to Luna.”</p><p>Neville waved at his friend.</p><p>Across the classroom, a girl grinned and waved back at them. She looked a little bit goofy: she was wearing polka-dotted pants, carried a book bag that was covered in many odd pins and appeared to have a few odd magazines in it, had corks and little rabbit charms dangling from her neck, and a very peculiar pair of sunglasses on her forehead. Her dirty blonde hair fell around her shoulders in silky curls. Her cheeks were rosy, and her pale eyes glittered as she smiled.</p><p><em> Fuck </em> , Ginny thought. <em> This is going to be a huge problem. </em></p>
