    <p>Draco was pissed. Despite his years of practice at the Malfoy Family's brand of composure, he was still livid. This was all because, of course, Harry Potter.</p>

        <div>
          <p>It always was so absolutely <em>frustrating</em>. No matter how much of a fuck-up he seemed to become, Harry was always the golden child of the wizarding world, and today was the last straw.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>---</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>When everyone came back for an eighth year, Harry thought it would be <em>easier</em>, but not like this. Every girl and even some guys were attached to his every waking move. It was hell.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>"Merlin, you'd think they'd get tired of you by now," Ron said, one day absentmindedly eating breakfast as a crowd of teenagers surrounded him, Harry, and Hermione at breakfast.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>"He did save the entire wizarding world Ron, and besides, people love a good boy that they can admire from afar," Hermione mumbled back, re-reading her potions essay and crossing something out.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>It had been a month and a half back at school and Harry was done.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>"Alright, you know what, I can't do this," Harry says, standing up and looking at the crowd surrounding them. "Anyone who wants an autograph, meet me at the astronomy tower after lunch, but you have to promise you will stop following me around!" he ends, a little more like a yell then he meant to, then, gathering his things, he turns to Ron and Hermione and whispers "See you guys in potions."</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>---</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>"Who does he think he is?" Draco grumbles, walking with Pansy back to the dungeons. "Holding a press conference for his little fans at school? Salazar knows he's just waiting for something to come by and ruin it." He says, grimacing at the thought of a whole bunch of teenage girls waiting to see The Chosen One</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>"Draco just give it a break." Pansy says, looking up at the doorway to the common room and whispering 'beetle wing'. "I know you hate him but what use is there complaining about it." She looks back at him, still standing in the doorway, "C'mon Draco, leave it be, and besides you promised to help me with my Charms homework." she says, sitting on a dusty armchair and setting her bag down. Draco sighs.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>"I'll help you later. I need to do something first." He walks out of the doorway into the hall, out of sight of Pansy.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>--</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>Harry stood, looking at all of the people who were waiting for him to sign just about everything, including chests, and watched as they slowly pushed forward towards him, calling his name and asking if he wants to marry them. He squints at a face in the back of the crowd.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>"Malfoy?" he says, apparently loud enough that the third year in front of him hears and turns to shout at the rest of her classmates that <em>Draco Malfoy</em> is here.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>"What is he doing here?"</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>"Malfoy wants an<em> </em>autograph from Potter?"</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>"Whats he up to?"</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>"It can't be!"</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>Whispers flood the room and everyone turns around to see that, in fact, Malfoy was there.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>"Nice to see you noticed Potter. Mother would love to have your autograph, I'm afraid she's a bit of a drama queen when it comes to celebrities like yourself." Malfoy says with a sneer. Everyone looks back at Harry with bated breath.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>"Oh, the apple must not fall far from the tree then, Malfoy, considering how much of a drama queen you are yourself," Harry says, walking forward, the crowd parts for him. Malfoy looks as though he tasted something particularly disgusting.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>---</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>How dare Potter, after having a bloody fan meeting to sign autographs, call Draco Malfoy a drama queen. He already ticked him off by just living, let alone being a few feet in front of him babbling about not being able to come up with a retort.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>"-and you think your mother is so high and mighty don't you Malfoy." Potter spits out at him, taking a step closer.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>"At least I have a mother," Draco says cooly. He knows he's pushed too far, especially when Potter lunges for him, grabbing him by his robes and whipping out his wand.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>"Don't you dare talk about my mother when your father is in Azkaban right now serving a life sentence." He jabs his wand into Draco's ribs and furrows his brows "Whats your game Malfoy?"</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>Draco laughs. Potter did just what he thought, get angry at even just his presence.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>"What's your game Potter? Seems you get all riled up from pinning me to a wall." Draco smirks, thinking he pushed another one of his buttons. the crowd gasps at this. "It doesn't surprise me, after seeing your behavior the past seven years."</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>Potter squints at Draco and turns his head.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>---</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>Does he really want to play <em>this </em>game? Harry won't back down, but Merlin he never thought Malfoy would sink so low.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>"My behavior? let's talk about you following me like a sad puppy, Malfoy." Harry sneers, feeling quite proud of himself. The man he's holding onto flushes red and pushes him away.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>"Mother can wait for her autograph, Potter, I would rather get it from you <em>alone</em> sometime." Malfoy winks, smirking, and saunters off.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>"All of you, I'll do this tomorrow, alright?" Harry shouts at the crowd, his voice felt off. "Otherwise I'm going to be bloody late for potions." He grabs his bag and quickly runs off, leaving a group of confused teenage girls to themselves.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>---</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>Draco turned the corner from the astronomy tower and found a cluster of students waiting in front of the charms classroom.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>"Flitwick had to go grab something from the Ravenclaw tower so now we have to wait here," Blaise says, flicking his wand so that his stack of books floating in front of him doesn't topple over. "Why are you so flushed Draco?" Blaise smirks, cocking his head teasingly.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>"Went to see if I could go start a fight with Potter, but I almost made a fool out of myself instead," Draco mumbled, leaning against the wall with his head in his hands.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>"So instead of helping me pass charms, you went to go flirt with Potter? I know you've obsessed Draco, but leaving your fellow housemates behind is a bit much." Pansy angrily crosses her arms and turns to Blaise, who just laughs.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>"I told you Pans, I do not have a crush on Potter, and I was hoping to avoid him by getting in the classroom before he storms down the hall on his way to potions." Draco's face flushes red again and Blaise elbows him, winking and gesturing to the staircase. He spins around and looks at Harry, who's walking very fast down the stairs and past the three of them, completely ignoring their presence.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>"Seems you didn't get to avoid him then," Blaise says, loving every minute he gets to tease Draco. "On a related note, how much of Potter's schedule do you know off the top of your head?" Draco's eyes widen and he sputters, trying to think of a response before Flitwick, with perfect timing, saved him from having to answer.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>---</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>"Harry my boy! Glad you're not too late." Professor Slughorn grins, gesturing to the clock. "We're brewing some Veritaserum today, so best to get working right away, there you go" He hands Harry some vials for the finished potion and turns back to his desk.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>"Oi, Harry come help me and 'Mione!" Ron shouts at him from across the room. Harry rushes to them, trying to avoid the stares of some of the girls in the classroom.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>"So how did it go?" Hermione says, dropping a spoonful of lizard scales into the potion, turning it from green to grey.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>"Bloody awful. Malfoy showed up." Harry says, making him want to slump down into his chair.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>"I bet you enjoyed that one mate," Ron says, snickering while trying to open up a snarguff pod. "How much do you snog? I reckon that's why you were so late to class" He laughs at his own joke before Hermione hits him with her potions book. "Ow! What was that for?" Ron says defensively.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>"Let Harry be, he obviously isn't pleased that Malfoy showed up, don't make his crush any harder than it is." She says, glaring at Ron before turning to Harry. "Are you alright?" She asks, concerned, in which Ron mouths a response to himself, asking why she didn't ask if he was alright since she was <em>his</em> girlfriend. Harry laughs at Ron's reaction but scowls at the mention of Malfoy.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>"I don't have a crush on him," Harry says, his head in his hands. "and besides, people thinking I fancy him is the whole problem."</p>
