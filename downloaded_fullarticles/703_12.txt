    <p>“Do you like it?” Ginny runs a hand through what’s left of her hair, little more than orange-red stubble on the sides of her head. On top, it’s long enough to run his fingers through. Harry’s mouth waters and his fingers twitch. He thought he’d be mourning something, but the only dead thing he sees is his past lack of taste. Is he sweating? He feels like he should be, if he isn't. “I showed the hairdresser a picture of you, actually.”</p><p>“Me?” Harry asks. He didn't know he looked like that. He didn't realize he looked <i>good</i>. Because Ginny looks beyond good, ravishing, in fact, and if this is what she sees in him, well, he must be something. “What picture?”</p><p>“The one with Teddy. You know the one. From my locker.” She fishes it out of her wallet, a threadbare thing he’d bought himself with his first paycheck from the Ministry. It had gone missing shortly after Ginny had bought him something better. For a birthday, or an anniversary, or some other special occasion. To tell the truth, he didn't remember. If she’d wanted it, she could’ve asked and he would've given it gladly. But she hadn’t asked about stealing his heart either, and Harry was adjusting to that just fine. </p><p>In the picture, Teddy, hair shifted black to match his, is standing up in Harry’s lap, hands on his shoulders, planting a kiss on the tip of Harry's nose. Harry is smiling, wavy hair falling into his eyes, teeth in full view. He doesn’t realize how much he’s grown used to the activity of wizarding photographs, the comforting loop of a single, sweeping motion on repeat, until he thinks that it all feels rather stationary. The admission that she kept the photograph in her locker was so casual, a light breeze just rattling the leaves of old hurts in his head, not enough to knock anything out of place but enough to make him remember that he’d never thought this life, this love would be his. </p><p>A partner that wanted to remember him while she was away, who took every surprise in stride, like she'd been expecting it all along. A godson that trusted Harry so boundlessly, that believed so earnestly in the fact that Harry would never hurt him that he gave his little whisper kisses freely. Pictures in which he was the focus, pictures in which he was at all. He remembered rooting through packets of photographs from Boots as a child, once the Dursleys had had them developed, and found nothing of himself -- not even a single thumb in the corner of a picture to point at and remind himself that he had been there. It had all felt like a tremendous illusion, some days, unbearably heavy and confusing, and with nothing to mark his place, he'd felt quite like a leaf blown about in a hurricane.</p><p>He would have never been able to dream up the life he had now, not at seventeen, and certainly not at eleven, when a letter had opened the door to a whole new world, <i>her</i> world. Nominally, it was his too -- he'd nearly given his life to save it -- but somewhere along the line, magic and Ginny had become synonymous, every swish and flick of a wand blending into his awe at how proudly she moved through the world.</p><p>“Yeah. I’ve seen it.” He says, which feels rather ridiculous, since he’s holding the genuine article in his hands. Is this a copy that he's holding? Is the original in her locker? He waves it around, like that's casual or cool. “So that’s what you like, huh? Me? My things?” He motions to his old wallet and she follows his gaze like she's been waiting for him to ask, chuckling. “That’s what you’re keeping me around for?”</p><p>“You’ve got me, Potter. I’m going to suck whatever style you’ve got out of you like a vampire.” Ginny laughs, tucking the wallet away in her pocket before throwing her arms around his waist, burying her face in his shoulder. They swing gently from side to side, like they're dancing to a tune no one can hear, and Harry feels at peace, whatever anxiety usually bubbled threateningly away in the background of his thoughts quieting to a muted hiss. “That’s the goal. Dressing like a grandfather while running errands at three in the morning.”</p><p>“Hey, I’m a sexy grandfather.” Harry says, before he quite thinks it through. “Or maybe I’ll be one someday, I don’t know.” His fingers flex against her lower back as he processed what he'd just implied about her involvement. "Oh, I mean, not if you don't--" They've never discussed children or a family, and how had he just assumed she might want that? She has plenty of siblings (though the number's always off, with Fred gone) and grew up in a crowded home. While Harry thinks that sounds splendid, does she? Would she want to open the door to living that experience a second time, as a parent? "Ginny, I'm sorry, I'm always doing these things wrong."</p><p>“I’ll be happy to find out. Someday in the far future though, please.” Ginny doesn’t miss a beat, to her credit. "I don't doubt you will be, though."</p><p>"This means I get two things of yours, then." Ginny's expression turns hungry. He quite likes it. "And I get to pick."</p>
