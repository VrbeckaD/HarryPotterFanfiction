    <p>Hermione Granger waited just inside the front entrance of Azkaban with a small amount of impatience. She was supposed to have been met by her escort ten minutes ago. She sighed, bloody Azkaban. She was here in her capacity with the Magical Entity Rights Commission to review the status of prisoner treatment. It had been a request from the Opposition, who had heard from a source that prisoners were being routinely tortured. The Minister had blocked attempts from the Opposition members to schedule a visit, but had arranged for a member of the Commission to attend. That member had woken up that morning with Spattergroit, So here Hermione was.</p><p>“Sorry! Sorry!” Shouted a voice. The guard jogged down the hall. “Sorry about being late, I’m not even supposed to be on shift today, but half the staff came down with Spattergroit. I was called in at the last minute.”</p><p>“No worries.” Said Hermione. “It’s a pretty routine check I think.”</p><p>The Auror guard introduced himself as Bastian and he looked very young, even to Hermione. She didn’t remember him from the lower years in Hogwarts, but he might have gone to one of the European schools. They began her review. Two hundred checks later Hermione was a little bored and her feet hurt. They were rounding the last corridor towards the exit when Hermione stopped.</p><p>“What about that one?” Hermione asked, stopping in front of it of a very inconspicuous door. Too purposely inconspicuous, thought Hermione. Bastian grimaced.</p><p>“Oh, he’s narky that one. Come in but get your wand out.” Hermione raised an eyebrow in unspoken question. She withdrew her wand and they entered the door to another corridor. She stopped immediately.</p><p>“Dementors were supposed to be completely removed from Azkaban years ago.” She said. That was right, yet two floated down a very dank looking hallway, large as.......life....she supposed.</p><p>“Oh were they?” Asked Bastian. “These have been here since I started working shifts in Azkaban.”</p><p>“Who’s in there?” Asked Hermione, pointing at the room.</p><p>“Prisoner 85. He’s a handful. They keep him stunned most of the time these days.”</p><p>Hermione looked in Bastian in confusion after checking her scroll.</p><p>“He isn’t on this list, I’ll have to observe him too.” Bastian nodded. They cast their patronus charm and two silvery animals cornered the dementors in a far section of the hall while Bastian moved to unlock the door.</p><p>“So why stunned? Surely he doesn’t have a wand?” Hermione asked, making some notes on her scroll.</p><p>“He fights. Physically.” Bastian explained. “Last time he broke the arms of two guards and concussed a third. He was halfway down the hall before the dementors took him down.”</p><p>“Riiiiiiiight.” Said Hermione. This was odd. Very odd. There was absolutely no record of this prisoner on the register she was given and he was being guarded by...never mind.... they were illegal now at any rate.</p><p>Bastian opened the door. “Well, there he is.”</p><p>“What. The. Fuck.” Said Hermione. The prisoner was bound to a bed, blindfolded and motionless but obviously Severus Snape.</p><p>——————————————</p><p>“Just calm down.” Said Harry. “Have a cup of tea or something. KREACHER!” He shouted. Kreacher appeared and very grudgingly placed a pot of tea with several cups on the kitchen table.</p><p>“Ok, start again.” Harry said calmly. It was a testament to how stressed Hermione was that she didn’t even scold Harry for not making the tea himself, but just took a shaking sip.</p><p>“He’s alive! In Azkaban.” Hermione said in disbelief leaning back in the chair.</p><p>“Who’s alive?” Asked Harry in confusion.</p><p>“Professor Snape!” Said Hermione. Harry shook his head.</p><p>“No way.” Harry said, but Hermione looked at him mutinously so he continued. “Ok, think about it Hermione. We were there when he died. We saw his body. We took his body back to Hogwarts. We buried his body. You got all shitty until the Ministry had a proper memorial. He. Is. Dead.”</p><p>“Well then I guess his identical twin is imprisoned in Azkaban.” Insisted Hermione. “I tell you I saw him!”</p><p>“You saw someone that looked like him.” Argued Harry. Hermione threw up her hands in frustration.</p><p>“You guys realise you are shouting right?” Said Ron sleepily as he entered the kitchen. He’d been rostered on night shifts so had been napping.</p><p>“Sorry Ron,” Apologised Harry, “Hermione’s just having a psychotic episode.” Hermione tossed a coaster at his head.</p><p>“I am not you arsehat! I know what I saw!”</p><p>Ron said down and poured himself a cup. “What’s going on?”</p><p>“Hermione here saw Snape locked up in Azkaban during her review this morning.” Harry said. Ron took a long, measured drag of his tea and looked at a Hermione, eyes narrowed.</p><p>“Alright.” He said. “What do you want to do about it?” He asked. Hermione beamed and Harry turned to Ron.</p><p>“What the hell? Ron! He’s dead.” Ron held up a hand.</p><p>“All I know is that Hermione has a proven track record in being right, and for once I want to be ahead of the game instead of ignoring her then apologising later when everything goes to shit.”</p><p>“Thank you Ron.” Hermione said smugly and raised an eyebrow at Harry, who ran his hand through his hair and laughed ruefully.</p><p>“Ok, so you have a point. A good point. Ok, maybe a great point. Should we tell the Ministry?” Harry asked. Hermione looked thoughtful.</p><p>“No. Not yet. I’ll turn in my report, but no mention of the Professor. And I’ll do a bit of digging.”</p><p>————————-</p><p>The next morning Hermione hadn’t even begun to get her head around how and what to dig when she was summoned by the Minister to present her report, a full six hours before it was due. Thankfully, Hermione was well-versed in Ministry dirty tricks and had written everything up the night before.</p><p>“Thank you for undertaking the review on such short notice.” Said Lincoln Carding, the Minister for Magic. “I was very surprised to hear you had been sent out on such a trifling matter. Very surprised.” He had dead looking eyes, thought Hermione, flat and bureaucratic.</p><p>“All part of the job.” Said Hermione, placing her report in from of him. It was only a few feet long.</p><p>“Any significant compliance breaches?” Asked Lincoln, pulling the scroll toward him. Hermione thought he sounded worried, but she couldn’t quite pinpoint what about.</p><p>“No Sir. Only minor issues relating to cleanliness and quality of food.” She said. The Minister seemed relieved. He sighed.</p><p>“Excellent. Excellent. Well, thank you again.” He waved her out, stowing the scroll in a drawer.</p><p>“Yes Sir.” Said Hermione, and left to return to her desk. That was her original intention in any case, and so what if the way back took her past all the Ministry records relating to Azkaban. There was such a thing as happy coincidence after all, Hermione thought to herself. Further to this, she accidentally took a turn through the section holding all the war records and unfortunately her robe caught on a stack of scrolls relating to the death of one Severus Snape. She managed to read every one as she returned them to their proper place.</p><p>Back at her desk Hermione pondered on what she had read. According to the Azkaban prison records, Prisoner 85 was Augustus Rookwood. He had been imprisoned after that truly awful Department of Mysteries crapshoot but escaped during the mass breakout. According to the notes, he was rounded up again after the final battle and thrown into Azkaban. Hermione was incredibly sceptical, Rookwood was tall with dark hair like Snape, but she’d remembered his pock-marked skin when his mask had fallen during the Ministry fight. The man tied to that bed, under the blindfold, well, you could see his skin was smooth. She was convinced it was Snape. His death records were complete, and with no living next of kin identified, his house and belongings were indentured to the Ministry. But it was Snape, she’d stake everything on it. Hermione frowned, but what to do about it?</p><p>She hadn’t told the Auror guard Bastian that she recognised Snape. She’d explained away her sudden explosion of profanity by suggesting that tying a prisoner to the bed and blindfolding them was in breach of the Magical Entity Rights. Bastian had looked concerned, but Hermione had added that given the circumstances of previous violence by the prisoner, she wasn’t going to make a record of it if she could be assured the practice would be abolished.</p><p>When she apparated back home to Grimmauld Place she was able to update Harry and Ron on what she had learnt, or not, as the case was.</p><p>“So, you think the Ministry grabbed Snape, bunged him in Azkaban for the last six years. Then they faked a body—that we buried mind you—and then covered the whole thing up?” Harry said skeptically.</p><p>“Um. Yes.”</p><p>“That’s a bit nefarious don’t you think?” Asked Harry.</p><p>“This is the same government that said you were lying about Voldy and employed Umbridge.” Hermione pointed out.</p><p>“Ok sure. But let’s say you are right, how do you break someone out of Azkaban?” Harry asked. Hermione rubbed her temples.</p><p>“We’ve broken into lots of places before.”</p><p>“And nearly got killed.” Harry reminded her.</p><p>Ron came down the stairs ready for his night shift.</p><p>“What are we talking about?” He asked.</p><p>“Breaking into Azkaban or breaking Snape out. Or both.” Said Harry. Ron laughed.</p><p>“Ok, well just let me know the plan when I get home.”</p><p>“You know who’d probably have an idea.” Suggested Hermione slowly.</p><p>“If you say Malfoy....” Threatened Harry.</p><p>“Well he would!” Insisted Hermione. “He’s at least had a connection to it.”</p><p>“Boo hiss.” Sulked Harry, but he didn’t stop Hermione from dashing off a quick request for advice on a ‘hypothetical scenario’ and sending it via owl to Draco. After the war Hermione had volunteered with a group that was overseeing the deradicalisation of younger Death Eaters who had been identified as candidates for rehabilitation. Draco had been assigned Hermione as a “recovery mentor” after the war and they’d managed to move from intense loathing, to grudging mutual respect, to tentative friendship over a six year period. Unsurprisingly, Draco had some trust issues. Harry was still trying to move on from passionate loathing, but then again, Hermione thought, he hadn’t spent as much time with Draco as she had. They’d spent a lot of time shouting at each other, insulting each other with a few hexes along the way and a lot of crying from both Hermione and Draco. Hermione respected anyone that made a genuine attempt at reconciliation, and Draco was trying. <em>Very</em> <em>trying</em>, as Harry would spitefully say. In any case, it only took the owl an hour to return. Hermione took the scroll and laughed when she read Draco’s response.</p><p>“What?” Harry asked.</p><p>“He says we should try Confounding an Auror guard named Dawlish. Apparently he is a bit susceptible to it now after the war. His next shift starts Friday.”</p><p>“I don’t even want to know how he knows all that.” Said Harry half-admiringly.</p><p>“He’s got fingers in pies that haven’t even been baked yet.” Said Hermione affectionately, already forming a plan.</p><p>————————</p><p>Hermione had a plan. A crappy one, but they didn’t have much time to figure it out before Dawlish’s shift. She’d made a completely illegal portkey from a muggle clothes peg. The plan was, Dawlish would be Confounded by Ron at the end of his shift and the start of Dawlish’s. Under the a Suggestability Charm, he’d hopefully put on a pair of gloves and Ron would slip the peg into his pocket. Following this, Dawlish would apparate to Azkaban, then once inside the wards and building, be drawn to go to Snape’s cell and clip the peg onto him. Harry, Ron and Hermione would wait in the spare bedroom for Snape to appear. Then....well that was as far as a Hermione had thought, and it would be a miracle if the plan even got that far successfully. The Suggestability Charm wasn’t strong, but they couldn’t use Imperius for this, not even to save Snape. They’d be caught for sure.</p><p>“It’ll be easier to try this again once we’re inside Azkaban ourselves.” Said Harry nervously. “What with the Confounding, illegal portkeys and breaking prisoners out. I hope we are in adjoining cells so I can shout at you about talking me into this.”</p><p>“Worst case scenario.” Said Hermione. “It’ll be fine.” She did not believe a single word she had just said.</p><p>They heard a crack as Ron apparated into the room.</p><p>“Well. It’s done.” Said Ron. “I guess now we wait.” The waiting patiently part took all of about ten minutes, until Harry and Ron got bored and started playing Exploding Snap. Hermione was reading the updated version of “Hogwarts: A History”. There was a really interesting section on Tom Riddle’s relationship with the school pre-Voldemort that she was only halfway through. She’d just decided to readjust her position on the armchair she’d transfigured when the bed appeared with a sucking pop.</p><p>“Shit!” Shouted Ron and fell backward. “Why the fuck did the bed come too?”</p><p>“Shut up Ron.” Said Harry, bending over the figure on the bed. He looked at Hermione and nodded slowly. Hermione came over and they both looked at the prostrate man.</p><p>It was, without a doubt, Severus Snape.</p>
