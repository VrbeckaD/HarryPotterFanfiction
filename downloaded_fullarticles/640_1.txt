    <p> </p><p>The screams rise up from below him and it reverberates through the floor, through his soul and out of the top of his skull to bounce around the cavernous manor ceiling. The cellar turned prison houses several Order members captured in a raid on one of their hideouts. Interrogation for the location of Harry Potter began the moments they were dragged through the wards of the house turned fortress. </p><p> </p><p>The walls, the grounds, all of it impenetrable. Nothing gets in. Nothing gets out. </p><p> </p><p>( Get out. Get out. <em> Get out!)  </em></p><p> </p><p> One of the screams is distinctly shrill, feminine. For weeks he won’t let himself see who it is in fear he knows exactly who it is from the distorted sound of her words and the way her “ O “ sounds are perfectly rounded like her penmanship. </p><p> </p><p>Eventually, he does. It gets to him, crawls under the skin and nests there, the nagging fear and loathsome curiosity. His heart beats so fast he’s sure it’s trying to exit it his body through the scars on his chest and leave him a bloody shredded mess on the floor. </p><p> </p><p>Even without the light of his wand, he knows her by the silhouette she casts on the dirty stone walls. Hair running rampant, framing her face like a mane, dried blood panting the side of her forehead and cheeks, diminutive stature only emphasized by recent malnutrition, arms so thin she could slip the shackles off her wrist if she wanted too.  Her eyes snap to him, burning dangerously, like the lioness in the tall savannah grass, stalking.</p><p> </p><p>( Coming in for the kill. <em> The kill </em>) </p><p> </p><p>Her clothes hang in rags covering nothing but only the most private of areas.  Dark freckles dot her chest, around her breast hidden only by a dirty white bra. If she let him close enough he could count her vertebrae, her ribs, study the flare of the hips that jut up from the denim pants she’s still wearing. The thin skin stretched over her ribs shutters with every angry breath. Her teeth are bared.</p><p> </p><p>She’d rip his throat out if she could.</p><p>He would let her. </p><p>A terrible clanging noise comes from the cell across the way from her. A familiar gangly redhead is spewing curses and animalistic shouts at him. Weasley reaches through the bars wildly gripping and swinging for anything his fingers might connect with. His clothes are all in one piece and he hasn’t lost nearly as much weight. </p><p>The stage was always titled in Potter and Weasley’s favor.</p><p>“What do you want Malfoy?” Granger spits at last. Her voice sounds like crunching gravel underfoot from shredded vocal cords.  Weasley is screaming utter nonsense and a headache threatens a riot from the noise, so with a flick of his wand, Malfoy silences him. </p><p>“What happened to your clothes?” Draco manages at last.</p><p>Something in her eyes changes on a dime. There’s a hole in her defenses and he’s aiming straight through it. The cornerstone to the whole wall that will crumble and leave her vulnerable.  Granger shakes her head and lowers his gaze from his, crossing her arms over herself. When she shifts he can see scratch marks crisscrossing along her back, deep, jagged, primal. </p><p>Inhuman.</p><p>It dawns on him with a single turn of his stomach who would be capable of such markings, having come up close with those jagged yellow claw-like nails himself but yet to be on the receiving end of there point. </p><p>(They tear away flesh like a peel on an apple. Rip. Shred. Mame. Blood on the snow. Blood on the pavement. ) </p><p>Greyback still has human urges too. He boasts about what he’s done to some of his more desirable victims frequently.</p><p>They must think he’s here to do the same. Bile rises to the back of his throat at the thought. </p><p>“Did he?”</p><p>“No. He tried to but got called away. “ she curls in smaller around herself.</p><p>Turning to leave, he thinks about restoring Weasley’s voice but then leaves him silenced. </p><p> </p><p>That night he sends a house-elf with one of his white undershirts and the tiniest vial of pain potion he can manage. </p><p> </p><p>A day later he is on guard duty for the door to the cellar. With all the wards and curses all over the place, it should be the only way in and out.  The house is filled to the rafters with shouts and screeches of the other Death Eaters, rejoicing in some victory he wasn’t privy to.</p><p>(Because he couldn’t kill the old man. Couldn’t kill. Snape could though. Snape’s voices cracks through his mind like a sheet of ice breaking from a tree to <em> pay attention .)  </em></p><p>He can barely hear it but the rumbles of a male voice carries up through stone stairs. The only male voice left down there should be muted. With silent movements, he slips back down to the cellar. </p><p>Potter is down there with that fucking cloak wrapped around his shoulders, making him vanished and reappear with movements.  He’s working at Granger’s shackles but she’s whispering. </p><p>“Just come back for me -"</p><p>“Hermione no-”</p><p>Weasley taps him on the shoulder and points to the low roof overhead. A signal for them to leave.</p><p>Coward. </p><p>“Listen to me. The snake. Use the sword to kill the snake. It has to be the sword and it has to be the kill.  Now, take Ron and go. I’m not strong enough to travel just yet. Come back for me. “</p><p>Potter nods and loops a chain around Weasley’s neck with his own and they disapparate without the crack.</p><p>“Come back for me. “ She says again to the empty room. </p><p>He stepped on the next step harder so it echoed and she turned, gasping.</p><p>Afraid. Caught. Helpless. </p><p>“What are you going to do to me?” its a challenge. Granger wants to fight, she wants a chance to break for it. To run from this place, screaming.</p><p>
  <em>(So much screaming.)</em>
</p><p>Saying nothing and stepping closer he can see that she’s losing color. Her lips are dry, cracked and bleeding. Dark circles ring her eyes and her hands are trembling as the grip the bars of the cell. Nail beds like her lips, worn down the quick. </p><p>The tearing on her back, the wound is probably sustained by dark magic. It will tear away at her magic and then her bit by bit until it consumed everything she has to offer. </p><p>“Why didn’t you stop them? Why didn’t you raise the alarm?” Her eyes narrow and her shoulders shift as the baggy shirt threatens to slip over one.</p><p>He can’t answer because he has no answer. No sarcastic remark, no caustic taunt not even a hurtful truth will come to the front of his mind. Hermione Granger is going to die in this shitty prison of a  house unless someone from the fucking Order comes for her and gets her out now.  </p><p>And still, she’s fighting.</p><p>Burning bright. Going for the throat. Going for the kill. </p><p> </p><p>The need to keep her, to have her at all times cements itself in his broken psyche. The fire lights and it is all-consuming.  </p><p> </p><p>“Why didn’t you go?” He finally asks back knowing she won’t answer. </p><p>Her lips press together in a thin hard line, almost vanishing in her colorless face.</p><p>“Potter won’t save you. “ </p><p>“Yes, he will. “</p><p>“Not in time. “  </p><p>Her eyes widen in shock for a moment before schooling themselves back into a mask. </p><p>“Yes, he will.  Or someone from the Order will. “ </p><p>He shakes his head and chuckles, low, dark, haunting the echoey room until Granger actually looks scared. </p><p>“Potter isn’t strong enough and his brains are currently standing in front of me in my shirt. Be good Granger and I just might keep you. “ Draco leaves without a second glance back to her. </p><p>When they ask what he was doing in there he says he thought he heard something but it was just Granger talking to herself.</p><p>No one checks to see that Weasley is gone for hours. They take their wrath out on Granger, who doesn’t crack, who hardly even screams. </p><p> </p><p>Until she does. Its blood curdling, wretched, filled with pain and filled with a promise of revenge. </p><p> </p><p>Draco goes to the cellar the next day and Granger doesn’t even rise from where shes slumped against the wall, just glares at him from the floor.</p><p>“I have an offer for you.” He says, crouching down to her eye level. </p><p>“I refuse.” She says outright, cutting through his words.</p><p>“Be mine. And I’ll give you everything you need and everything you want. “ </p><p>She snorts. “You wouldn’t like what I want. “</p><p>“Try me. “</p><p>She deadpans. “I want to go back to the Order so I can put you and your kind in Azkaban. I want to live even though I’m a muggle-born and I want to kill You-Know-Who. “ </p><p>He grins in spite of himself. “The only thing I don’t want off of that list is to go Azkaban.” </p><p>“Oh and here I thought we would come to an agreement.” she fakes a pout. </p><p>“Maybe tomorrow. “</p><p>“I’d rather die on this floor.”</p><p>“That’s a very real possibility.”</p><p> And he leaves her in the dark. </p><p> </p><p>The next day he goes to see her and she doesn’t crack again. Nor does she stand.  Her strength is slipping like water in her palm. </p><p>“Be mine.” it’s hardly more than a whisper and even less of a hope.</p><p>“Fuck off.” she spits back. </p><p>Days march on and Granger holds out for four more. Each day she still fights back, refusing to break. </p><p>On the dawning of the fifth day, Draco finds her laying flat on her back on the stone floors, tossing her head from side to side, mumbling incoherently, delusional with fever. </p><p>She turns her head to the noise of him but can’t seem to find his face, her eyes darting around the room wildly. </p><p>“Hallow. We need the Hallows.”</p><p>“Granger?”</p><p>"Stone. Cloak. Wand. Hallows. “</p><p>“That’s a children's story. You’re cracking up finally.”</p><p>She shakes her head violently.  “Dumbledore. Wand.”</p><p>(<em> Dumbledore falling off the Astronomy tower like a puppet whose strings had suddenly been cut. Twisting grotesque shapes).  </em></p><p>She begins to sob wildly as Draco leaves the cellar and heads to the family library. </p><p> </p><p>The next day she watches him. Her fever has turned to a cold chill that stains her lips blue. She’s covered in the same layer of grime that coats everything down here eventually.  Before the words can tumble out of his mouth, she speaks. </p><p>"They aren't coming for me. " </p><p>“Not in time.”</p><p>“No.” she agrees</p><p>"What do you want Granger? " </p><p>"I want to live. But I'm dying. I want to kill Greyback but I'll never get the chance. I want...revenge...for being abandoned but…" tears rolled down from the corners of her eyes, streaking through the dirt on her hollowed-out cheeks.  </p><p>"Say you'll be mine and you can have everything. " </p><p>"Everything?"</p><p>"Yes." </p><p>Her lips tremble for a moment. “I’m yours Malfoy.“ </p><p>He nods, face still a  mask etched from stone. “I can move you tonight while everyone else is gone. “</p><p> </p><p>She’s made it 19 days in the cellar. Most prisoners don’t make it 3 before cracking under the pressure, a few more hours won’t make a difference. </p><p>Her magic must be keeping her going. Raw. Powerful. Untapped.</p><p> </p><p>His father is waiting for him at the top of the stairs, leaning more heavily on the walking stick that he’s never actually needed before.  Eyes the color of day-old snow appraise him before finally speaking. </p><p> </p><p>“ I get this distinct feeling I’m either going to be extremely disappointed or extremely proud of what just happened down there between you and that...girl.” </p><p> </p><p>“She’s about to tell me all the things the others couldn’t get out of her. All without losing a brilliant tactical mind that’s been betrayed by the Order. Information that is given to us freely. Not to mention morale hit to the Order and its supporters. “ </p><p>He turns the silver snakes head in his palm again and again as the light reflects off of its pristine surface. </p><p>“And you intend to…”</p><p>“Keep her. She’s mine. I’ll heal her and bring her back to her fighting condition.“ It comes out in a snarl, more defensive than he means to show but his father doesn’t flinch. </p><p>Lucius starts to tap the stick in his palm in an unfamiliar rhythm. “What an honor it would be for the Malfoys to bring such a wealth of information to the Dark Lord. We could be forgiven for all previous...trespasses. What shame about blood status though.” </p><p>“What a shame she was adopted and raised by muggles. Probably too afraid of her magical heritage to tell her. “ Draco meets his father’s hard gaze. </p><p> </p><p>His father’s lips curl into a cat-like smile. Cold. Calculating. </p><p> </p><p>“Indeed. What a shame. Do make sure she’s comfortable and <em>secure </em> Draco, we wouldn’t want this to go astray hm? “ with that he turns on his heel and he’s off for towards the large main fireplace. </p><p>That night when Draco moves her into his quarters, the fever has a vice grip on her again and her eyes flutter, struggling to stay open.  She can’t stand and her head rolls from side to side, nonsensical words trip past her broken lips. Weighing nothing, shes molds herself against him as he carries her up the steps and straight up to his room. </p><p>She hardly stirs when he strips her of her filthy clothes and burns them in his own fireplace and only makes a noise of protest when he goes to catalog her wounds all over her body, using all her strength to try and stand in front of the fire. </p><p>Scars on her thighs mark just how close Greyback got to his goal. Anger rolls through him as he swears to kill the werewolf even if he has to do it with his own bare hands. </p><p>Turning her back to him he remembers the song- like incantation Snape taught him for wounds festering with Dark Magic. It comes off her waves with twisting dark edges. The scarring has already set in, dittany won’t do any good now.   </p><p> </p><p>“I’ve got you, you’re mine now.” He whispers soothingly against her temple helping her into a bath. </p><p>“Why?” she finally manages after a moment after the water has settled over her skin. </p><p>“I’ve already told you why. You are mine and I take care of what is mine.” </p><p>Her breathing steadies out as he concentrates on her hair, using his wand to make a clean stream of water. Her abused body makes him see red and raze all of England to rubble for it. </p><p>(<em>But I’ll leave that to her. Her revenge will be worth it. )  </em></p><p>Her eyes meet his and the fire he saw just days ago is dead. Gone. Dark eyes are bottomless with a depth of fresh pain. </p><p>“I’m a virgin. So you know. “ There's no fear only resolve to soldier on. To keep surviving no matter the consequences along the way. Disgust makes his nose crinkle as he scoffs.</p><p>“You’re mine forever. When you’re ready you’ll be begging me for it, Granger. “ </p><p>She hums a noise of disagreement and lowers her gaze turning away from him, not expending precious energy on bickering. </p><p>She doesn’t ask when he comes in with new clothes in her size. When she lays down in his bed she curls herself up tight into a ball. </p><p>Small. Diminutive. Less than</p><p>(He hates it. She should never be small. She should throw herself wide across the mattress demanding the bed to herself. ) </p><p>***</p><p>Papers appear the next morning. They document a half-blood witch born on Sept. 19th at St. Mungo’s and give up for adoption at an undisclosed location. </p><p>***</p><p>Hermione sleeps for days only waking for a bite of food kept warm for her under a charm.</p><p>While she sleeps he wards the room within an inch of its life and volunteers himself for some shit mission at Hogwarts. </p><p>When he slips away to the white marble tomb that miraculously lays undisturbed for this long, his lungs start to feel too small for his chest. He can feel the hum of magic radiating from it, calling him, urging him on. </p><p>The heavy lid squeaks and scrapes in the protest of being removed but before it is all the way off the wand flies to his fingers. It screams at him, begs him to do something, anything to bring its power to life. His lips are dry and his lungs are empty and he suddenly understands what has to happen in order to get everything he ever wanted.</p><p>He sets fire to the surrounding woods, just to watch them burn. </p>
