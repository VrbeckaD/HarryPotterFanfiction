          <div class="userstuff"><p>"Dear Merlin, tell me this isn't happening," said Ginny as the lift jolted to a stop midway through it's journey to the sixth floor of the Ministry.</p>
<p></p><div class="inner">
<p></p><div class="entry-content"><p>"This isn't happening," Luna said, a serene smile on her face. Normally the sight of Luna, with her relentless optimism, was enough to cool Ginny down, just a smidgen, but not now. Not when the lift had ceased working between two floors, not when England was experiencing the hottest summer on record, and especially not when she was <em>pregnant</em>.</p><p>"'It'll be good for you to get out,' Mum said," Ginny grumbled. <em>"Really, Mum?" </em>Ginny glared up at the ceiling as if her mother was there looking down on her. <em>"Does this look good for me?"</em></p><p>"It'll be alright, Ginny," Luna said comfortingly, rubbing Ginny's shoulders. Ginny immediately started to melt under her touch. "I've already sent Hermione a Patronus, she'll get us out as soon as she can."</p><p>"I know," Ginny groaned. "But I want to be out <em>now</em>. And I know that makes me sound like a brat but I don't <em>care</em>. I'm hot and I'm hungry and I have to pee and my back won't stop aching."</p><p>"I'm sorry, love," Luna said sympathetically but a slight smirk sat at the edge of her lips.</p><p>"What?" Ginny demanded.</p><p>"You did want this, you know," Luna reminded her. "You said it was your turn, that I'd already had my go our first time round."</p><p>"Past me was an <em>idiot</em>. You should never have listened to her."</p><p>Luna laughed and Ginny smiled despite how uncomfortable she was in her current circumstances.</p><p>Luna kissed her, wrapping her arms around Ginny's neck but Ginny pushed her off after just a few seconds, grimacing. "Sorry. It's just too bloody hot in here."</p><p>"That's alright," Luna smiled. "Do you want to sit down?" she asked, noting how Ginny leaned against the wall.</p><p>"No," Ginny grumbled.</p><p>Luna raised an eyebrow, encouraging her to give a reason why.</p><p>"I'm scared I won't be able to get back up," Ginny mumbled, not looking Luna in the eye.</p><p>Luna laughed once more and pressed a kiss to Ginny's cheek, drawing away quickly in order to give her space in the cramped quarters. "I love you."</p><p>Ginny sighed. "I love you too. But I'd love you more if you got us out of here."</p><p>The lift jolted once again and then the doors were opening to revealed a frazzled looking Hermione.</p><p>Ginny and Hermione spoke simultaneously.</p><p>"Finally!"</p><p>"There are you are! I fixed it as fast as I could!"</p><p>"Hey, Gin. Luna," a disembodied voice said and Ginny spotted Harry and Ron standing a few feet behind Hermione. Ron had a takeout container in hand and the sweet and spicy aroma of pad thai drifted up Ginny's nose.</p><p>"Are you going to eat that?" She asked, eyeing the food hungrily.</p><p>"Uh---" Before Ron could even get a proper word out, Luna and Hermione had turned eerily similar death glares his way.</p><p>"Here," he said, shoving the takeaway container into her hands. "Have Harry's too. It's on his desk."</p><p>"Hey!" Harry objected but after receiving his own set of death glares, he quickly shut up and led the way to his office.</p></div></div></div>
