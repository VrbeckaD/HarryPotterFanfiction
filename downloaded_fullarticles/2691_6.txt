</p><p class="p1">The street was dingy. It was dingy and it smelled a bit off, and most of the awnings were faded or torn from age. And that was fantastic.</p><p class="p1">“Okay, okay. How about,” James said. He bit his lip and looked up at the clouds. “How about R with M.”</p><p class="p1">“Meally?” Sirius asked. “Okay, I guess we’ll see how mare M is. Mame.”</p><p class="p1">“Too difficult, Simius?” Sirius couldn’t stop himself from laughing. “Om maybe you’re - YOU’M - just too distra— dist’macted.”</p><p class="p1">“No, I’m not dist’macted,” Sirius replied. “I’m pemfectly p’mepamed to handle this.”</p><p class="p1">“You’m what?” James asked.</p><p class="p1">“P’mepamed! What, am I not speaking <i>cleamly</i> enough?” Now they both were snickering. They were also getting a great deal of funny looks, and this was just the kind of day Sirius loved. It was summer, the sky was clear, and he was with James wandering around London. <i>Muggle</i> London. Scandalous.</p><p class="p1">“Is that the stome theme?” James asked, pointing to the far corner.</p><p class="p1">“Probably,” Sirius said.</p><p class="p1">“P’mobably,” James corrected.</p><p class="p1">“P’mobably,” Sirius repeated. “Let’s just c’moss the str— st’meet almeady.”</p><p class="p1">It wasn’t a very big store. Sirius ran directly into a table loaded with crates of records upon opening the door. He had to squeeze past a tall, precarious stack of boxes to get to the aisle. Once there, he had free range to peruse the exotic treasures. His fingers trailed over the tops of the records covers. There were so many to pick from. The music playing overhead was spot on as well. Sirius considered going up and asking if whoever was playing on the radio had a record he could buy somewhere in the store. That at least would give him a clue on where to even <i>start</i>. He wished Remus were here.</p><p class="p1">“Simius,” James said, turning a record towards Sirius. “What am I looking at?”</p><p class="p1">“It’s a naked woman, James,” came a voice from behind Sirius. Sirius nearly jumped out of his skin when a hand landed on his shoulder. “I understand that you are unfamiliar with the concept, and since you will probably never see one for real, I suggest buying the record.”</p><p class="p1">“Memus!” Sirius cried, throwing his arm around Remus’s shoulder and squeezing in a one-armed hug. The fates had answered him! Now he could find the best records. This was a great day.</p><p class="p1">“I can’t believe I’m saying this, but I actually prefer being called Moony,” Remus replied. He looked uncomfortable, so Sirius dropped his arm and leaned against the crates instead.</p><p class="p1">“What ame you doing heme?” James asked.</p><p class="p1">“Are my ears broken?” Remus asked, looking between them with concern. James rolled his eyes. “Because you are more nonsensical than usual.”</p><p class="p1">“You’m no fun, you know that?” James said with exasperation. “I <i>said</i> what are you doing here?”</p><p class="p1">“Oh. Aselthorp didn’t come back this morning, so I gave myself the day off,” Remus said. “Thought I’d join you, if only to keep you from complaining come September.”</p><p class="p1">“I wouldn’t complain,” Sirius said dismissively.</p><p class="p1">“Yes you would,” James said. He perched himself on a windowsill and slouched in mockery of Sirius’s own nonchalant demeanor. “You’d sit on that table in the common room and say, ‘why wouldn’t Remus just come to London. It’d be just a day, and he can spare a day to be with uuuuuuuus.’”</p><p class="p1">“I don’t sound like that,” Sirius mumbled, but it was probably inaudible under Remus’s laughter. Which was fine because at least they’d managed to get Remus to laugh. Sirius supposed he could sacrifice his pride for that. He was a martyr. A noble martyr for his dear, heartless friends.</p><p class="p1">“‘<i>Sirius</i>,’” he returned, affecting James’s tone to the best of his ability, which by this time was at a master’s level. “‘My mum sent the walnut cookies, and she <i>knows</i> I like the hazelnut ones the best! And my owl’s already out so I can’t ask her to fix it, can I borrow <i>yours?’”</i></p><p class="p1">“My god, do I get paid to babysit?” Remus asked. He was flipping through the records absently.</p><p class="p1">“No,” Sirius said frankly. “What’s that one?”</p><p class="p1">“The one with the crawling naked albinos?” Remus asked blankly. He pulled it out and handed it over. Sirius flipped it but there wasn’t much clue as to what he was holding. Well, except a back-to-back image of small pale children climbing a rust red mountain for no reason whatsoever. He carefully pulled out the record to read the title ‘Houses of the Holy’. What that had to do with pale naked children was a mystery.</p><p class="p1">Muggles were strange and funny creatures.</p><p class="p1">“Here we go,” Remus said. He held up a tan album: The Who by Numbers. “And it comes with an activity for the perpetually infantile!”</p><p class="p1">“Bagsies on the children’s activity,” James said, looking through records. He pulled out another — also featuring a naked woman. Sirius frowned at the pile of records featuring naked women James had pulled. Sirius was upset that he hadn’t thought of that first.</p><p class="p1">“So you know that one?” Sirius asked. Remus shrugged and tilted his head to read the list of songs on the back.</p><p class="p1">“I know Squeeze Box. That’s actually it off of this one. Squeeze Box is good, though.” Remus leaned forward to look around Sirius and frown disapprovingly at James.</p><p class="p1">“Well, I’ll take that one then,” Sirius said, taking the record from Remus. “James, give me one of yours.”</p><p class="p1">“Get your own pile of naked birds,” James said.</p><p class="p1">“You’re not going to buy all of them, are you?” Remus asked. “You don’t even have a record player.”</p><p class="p1">“I could hang ‘em up in my room,” James said.</p><p class="p1">“And if your <i>mum</i> came in…” James moved his hands away from the pile of records.</p><p class="p1">“Yeah, well, I guess if they’re meant to be <i>played</i>…”</p><p class="p1">Sirius shuffled through the collection. He was impressed with how quickly James had worked. Enterprising boy.</p><p class="p1">“Didn’t know you’d get James to come down. Might not have worked so hard coming to meet you myself if I’d’ve known,” Remus said.</p><p class="p1">“You had to come!” Sirius cried. “You’re the <i>expert</i>! That one,” Sirius jabbed a finger in James’s direction, “is the entemtainment.”</p><p class="p1">“Sirius is staying at mine,” James said blithely. “Not likely he could skive off without me. Hey, you should come up for dinner.”</p><p class="p1">“I’m really fine,” Remus said. “I can make do on my own.”</p><p class="p1">“I’m not going to take no for an answer,” James said. Remus eyed him warily.</p><p class="p1">“You’re going to hex me and drag me there, aren’t you?”</p><p class="p1">“Moony,” Sirius said, acting appalled. “Are you suggesting we would use magic? <i>Illegally?</i> It’s <i>summer</i>.”</p><p class="p1">“You two would do it anyway,” Remus replied. “Actually, I think the illegality would only increase your motivation.”</p><p class="p1">“So you’re coming?” James asked with a grin.</p><p class="p1">“As if I had a choice,” Remus sighed. Then his face lit up. He pulled a dark colored record from the bins.</p><p class="p1">“Whassat then?” Sirius asked, looking over Remus’s shoulder. He had already pulled a couple of records from James’s pile at random.</p><p class="p1">“Tommy,” Remus said quietly. “Always wanted to hear the whole album through. They play bits from it on the radio sometimes.”</p><p class="p1">“Alright,” Sirius said, snatching the album from Remus’s hands. “Winning endorsement for the Black collection.</p><p class="p1">“And what if I wanted it?” Remus asked, but Sirius knew he was bluffing. Remus never bought something he couldn’t use. And Remus had nothing to spin a record on.</p><p class="p1">“Now you just have to come by ours and listen to it all the time on my turntable. If you’ll excuse…”</p><p class="p1">Sirius maneuvered his way through the shop to a man at a counter in the back. Whoever he was, the bloke looked sickly. Vacant eyes, tattoos down his neck. Probably kept going under the shirt. There was an idea: tattoos. Sirius should consider tattoos. He wondered how muggles did it.</p><p class="p1">“Hallo hallo,” Sirius said cheerfully as he placed the records down.</p><p class="p1">“Hallo,” came the hollow reply. He began to pick through the albums and type into the large metal contraption on the desk. “Bit of a mix, yeah?” Sirius shrugged.</p><p class="p1">“Jay!” Remus called from another part of the tiny shop.</p><p class="p1">“Yeah… Oh, Rem. What are you doing in these parts?”</p><p class="p1">“Skiving off. Is this the Clash?”</p><p class="p1">“First album, yeah. Came out March. Hey, didn’t you hear them?” Remus nodded. He came over and held the album out to Sirius.</p><p class="p1">“Black Swan a year ago. They were the premier then. Sirius, add this on the pile.”</p><p class="p1">“Friend of yours?” asked Jay, gesturing at Sirius. He seemed to have woken up considerably for Remus.</p><p class="p1">“He’s very obedient. Whossa good boy?” Remus loosely scratched at Sirius’s head, and Sirius batted the hand away.</p><p class="p1">“Yeah, hilarious,” Sirius said.</p><p class="p1">“Just didn’t expect Remus to have such a clean mate around.”</p><p class="p1">“Clean?” Sirius asked.</p><p class="p1">“Shut it, Jay. I can make friends wherever I want,” Remus replied. He leaned over the counter lazily, poking at the pictures pasted below the counter. “Is that you and Sarah?”</p><p class="p1">“Anne,” Jay said. “Crazy night. Wish you didn’t come and go like random. But since you’re in town, there’s a thing next Wednesday…” Remus shook his head.</p><p class="p1">“One night only affair. But we’ll see what we can do when Aselthorp comes around hisself.” Jay nodded and handed the bag of records to Sirius.</p><p class="p1">“Well, happy to meet a friend of this nutcase,” Jay said to Sirius in a friendly manner. “Take care with those.” Remus led the way out, a puzzled Sirius in tow. There had never been any consideration of Remus with friends outside of Hogwarts. In Sirius’s mind, it was only horrible, grueling work under the harsh commands of Mr. Aselthorp, Pest-Control Tyrant, and then howling moons chained to who knew what anymore. There wasn’t really room for friends and birds and apparently <i>parties</i>. Is that why Remus had gone off with Eona and her crowd? Did Remus get spectacularly drunk every summer? Why didn’t he invite them? Sirius couldn’t really stand birds like Eona, but it’d be a laugh with James and Remus there.</p><p class="p1">James was outside, face to the sun like a lizard splayed out on a rock. The sound of the door closing caused him to turn.</p><p class="p1">“Success?”</p><p class="p1">“Success,” Sirius agreed, but the narrowing of James’s eyes was enough that Sirius recognized the understanding. Sirius was on the path to brooding, and James knew it. Which was probably what prompted James into his ever growing list of methods to stop Sirius from brooding at all times over anything whatsoever. James pulled a record from the bag.</p><p class="p1">“Anyone for frisbee?”</p><p class="p1">“WHAT?!” Sirius exploded even as James — and Remus the traitor — laughed.</p>
