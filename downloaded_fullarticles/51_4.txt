  <b>Part I</b>
</p><p>This can’t be happening.</p><p>I press the elevator button for the umpteenth time, even though the damn thing refuses to acknowledge my presence. I contemplate hexing it into oblivion, then force myself to take a calming breath. It’s not the first time a Ministry elevator has broken down. It won’t be the last time, either. It’s my fault, anyhow, for working way past quitting time. Not that I had much choice in the matter, but if I had left with everyone else, I would be halfway home to Crookshanks and a cup of tea already.</p><p>I let out a loud huff, then turn on my heel. My destination is the set of stairs located at the far end of the Research Sector. It’s largely unused day-to-day, but I suppose it’s nice to have on hand when the elevators stop working.</p><p>The Sector is eerily quiet as I trudge past empty desk after empty desk. It seems that most people didn’t even bother wrapping up their work before heading home. Lazy slugs. I would be driven mad if I left my desk in such a state.</p><p>I pass several labs with doors left ajar. I squint my eyes and slow my pace. Something isn’t right here. I squeak to a stop in my trainers and peer into the nearest lab. There are papers everywhere, and cauldrons that were hastily cooled down. I sniff the air - it appears that whoever was manning this project didn’t even bother with the cleanup protocols before rushing out. </p><p>That’s when the alarm bell goes off in my mind. Something clearly happened, something that made all these people clear out. I must’ve been deep in a brew-cycle and missed the hubbub.</p><p>Rather than panic, I set my mind to my original task: the stairs. My trainers squeak on the shiny floors along with the rhythm of my heart. I get to the door of the stairwell and give the door a hearty tug.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>I freeze, unsure if I’m somehow in a sleep-deprived fever dream. I tug again, and the door doesn’t budge.</p><p>Dammit. </p><p>My heart begins to pound in earnest. With this rising tide of Dragon Pox sweeping the wizarding world, it’s not too big a leap to imagine it being the cause of this rapture-esque emptiness.</p><p>A cold sweat takes over my body. I whip my wand out and try every variation of unlocking and opening spells that I can think of. Naturally, it’s a fruitless endeavor. If these are Ministry wards keeping the doors shut and the elevators inoperable, there’s no chance for me to break them.</p><p>With a huff, I spin in my heel and head back to my personal laboratory. I’m thankful for the long hours that I’ve spent holed up there, trying every available avenue to discover a Dragon Pox cure. I’ve got a cot and blankets, and a small stash of food in my desk drawers. I’ll experiment later with summoning food, but I’m fairly certain I will be able to find other food sources in the expansive Research Sector.</p><p>I pause at the door to my lab, silently taking stock of all of my provisions. My mental list, however, is interrupted by the creak of a door opening behind me.</p><p>I turn in a flash, wand at the ready. Old habits die hard, I guess. Even tucked away deep in the Ministry, I still find myself on guard for attacks.</p><p>The door across the hall is the culprit. It’s swinging open, and before I can process anything more than a jolt of shock, a head full of silvery blonde hair appears. </p><p>Lucius fucking Malfoy.</p><p>He gives me a cold, appraising stare, eyebrow arched, all cockiness and pretension.</p><p>His low drawl seems to slither its way into my brain.</p><p>“Must you point that thing at me?” </p><p>I look down at my wand and realize that I’ve slipped into a defensive position, wand ready with a hundred different hexes running through my mind.</p><p>I keep it leveled at him, nonetheless.</p><p>“Malfoy. What are you doing here?”</p><p>He sniffs, the very picture of indignation. Adjusting his grip on his ornate cane, he steps out of the doorway and gives a disappointed look at his surroundings. And me.</p><p>“Ministry business, Miss Granger.” </p><p>I hold back a snort. “You are persona non grata, Mister Malfoy. I cannot imagine what business you would have in the Ministry Research Sector.”</p><p>He twists the cane in his long, spindly fingers. “Quite the Gryffindor, as always. My business here at the Ministry is none of yours. Now, kindly lower your wand. We must be civilized, mustn’t we?”</p><p>I drop my wand about six inches, the furthest that I will allow it to go. Adrenaline is shooting through my veins, and I fear that at any moment, I’ll be fighting for my life. Lucius Malfoy was cleared of his charges after the war, but tales of his cowardice and self-servitude have tainted his precious reputation ever since. It is only because of the bravery of his late wife that he was given any wiggle room during the reparations after the war.</p><p>I trust this man about as far as I can throw him.</p><p>“Civilized,” I sneer, matching his disdain. “Fancy, you lecturing me on manners.”</p><p>“Enough.” He waves his hand, dismissing me entirely. “We have bigger pixies to bottle than squabbling like infants in the mud.”</p><p>“Fine.” I all but spit the word from my mouth. His condescension rankles me more than I care to admit. I allow my wand arm to fall to my side. “Keep your business to yourself, then. I’m assuming we’ve fallen into a Ministry Quarantine, and there’s no telling how long we’ll be here.”</p><p>He allows a stiff nod. “I heard the commotion of everyone leaving, but I was indisposed.” He seems uncomfortable with that word. “When I was finally able to investigate, all I found was Gryffindor’s Princess with her knickers in a twist.”</p><p>I tighten my grip on my wand. I’d give anything to hex this man into oblivion. “My knickers are in a twist for a very good reason, Malfoy. Frankly, I’m surprised that you seem so nonplussed by this quarantine.”</p><p>His voice darkens. “My entire existence has been quarantine, Miss Granger. This, at least, is proving to be better conditions than my previous confines in Azkaban, and my recent isolation of the Manor.”</p><p>“Fair enough, Mister Malfoy.” A blush colors my cheeks, unbidden and I fight the urge to squirm under his gaze. “I hadn’t taken that into consideration.”</p><p>“I imagine you wouldn’t.” He casts his eyes around the empty Sector. “I imagine the wards will prevent any type of travel, even that of house-elves. Pity, I’d gotten used to tea around this time at the Manor.”</p><p>I roll my eyes, torn between disdain for this cold man and my own desire for a hot cup of tea.</p><p>“Follow me.”</p><p>Damn my British sensibilities. I turn and head into my lab, not checking to see if he will follow. At my desk, I pull a pot and two teacups from my desk drawer. It’s short work to set water to heating.</p><p>I chance a glance over my shoulder and see Lucius Malfoy standing in the doorway to my lab. He seems uncertain, which is a look I’ve never seen on him before.</p><p>“Do come in, Mister Malfoy.” I gesture to my sitting area, my favorite place to swill tea and lose myself in my work. There are two overstuffed armchairs, both worn and well-loved. “No need to hover at the door, though this will no doubt be poorer fare than you are accustomed to.”</p><p>He hesitates for a nano-second, then strides across the room, robes billowing behind him. He moves with such confidence, I almost find myself entranced. It’s as if he’s a dancer, each move perfectly choreographed and executed.</p><p>The whistle of the teapot pulls my attention from the dangerous man in my laboratory, and I quickly make myself busy preparing tea for us.</p><p>Merlin, am I honestly making tea for Lucius Malfoy? The thought spins my brain, and for a moment I am frozen. It’s as if I’ve been dumped into a farce, and now I’m forced to see how this comedy of errors will play out.</p><p>Luckily, my muscle memory takes over, and I am able to complete my task and levitate the tea to the sitting area with little difficulty. I sink into the chair opposite him, and I do everything in my power not to gawk at the imposing figure in front of me.</p><p>Tea with Lucius Malfoy. Perhaps this is the end of the world, after all.</p><p>He takes a tentative sip of his tea, as if he’s expecting it to be poisonous. His eyebrows raise in what I hope is approval, though, and he sets the cup back down with a contented sigh.</p><p>“Shall we maintain this painful silence for the duration of our quarantine, Miss Granger? I would find it almost soothing, but for the palpable tension rolling off of you in waves.”</p><p>Is he making a joke? I almost choke on the tea in my mouth at the thought. </p><p>“By no means, Mister Malfoy. I am quite capable of civility since that is what the occasion calls for.”</p><p>“How kind of you. I almost feel bad for you, being caught in this situation with a loathsome Ex-Death Eater, but I imagine playing the martyr will suit your sensibilities just fine.”</p><p>I snipe back, voice as sharp as daggers. “I am no martyr, Mister Malfoy-”</p><p>“Lucius.” He cuts me off. “We may as well dispose of formalities.”</p><p>I blink at him, then offer a small nod. “Lucius, then.”</p><p>“Tell me.” He seems to relax in his chair, a sight I never thought I’d see. “What work keeps you holed up in the Ministry during a worldwide pandemic?”</p><p>I pull at the sleeves of my jumper. “The pandemic itself, actually. I am the lead researcher in the hunt for a cure.”</p><p>His eyebrows shoot up. “I see. And here, I thought you’d be gallivanting around the world with Potter and Weasley, saving kittens from trees and the like.”</p><p>A chuckle escapes me. “Saving kittens, as you put it, has been their way of feeling in control after the war. Harry especially lived a life of saving the innocent, and he’s found it impossible to change tack now. In my own way, I suppose I’m no better than he is. I’m endeavoring to save kittens, but far less tangible kittens dying of unseen threats. And doing so surrounded by books and holed up in my little lab.”</p><p>“A worthy endeavor.”</p><p>“More worthy than the ‘gallivanting’ that Harry and Ron do?”</p><p>He takes a long sip of his tea, seeming to weigh his words before he speaks. “It seems to me that while they are working toward saving the day, you are working toward saving the future.”</p><p>My cup finds its home in the saucer with a satisfying sound. I regard the man in front of me, unsure how to take this unexpected praise.</p><p>“I’ve never thought about it that way.”</p><p>He offers a shrug. “Take it as you will. My opinion has been largely disregarded of late.”</p><p>“Surely that chafes you?”</p><p>“Chafe is a terribly soft word.”</p><p>I chance another sip of tea, relishing the chance to verbally spar with someone other than Crookshanks. “Soft, yes, but is it not fitting?”</p><p>He smirks, eyes shining. “I’ll grant you that much, but I would say it falls short of my actual experience. Though, I’m certain you would not care to hear the grievances of a man who brought about his own dishonor.”</p><p>I run my finger along the rim of my cup. “I’ve found that dishonor is quite a fluid state. Once dishonored, I believe it is possible to regain one’s standing in society.”</p><p>“Is that so? And this is accomplished with what - good deeds?”</p><p>“Saving kittens is a good start, I would wager. Self-sacrifice, done selflessly, would be a better start.”</p><p>“Ah, but self-sacrifice to clear one’s name would hardly be a selfless deed.”</p><p>“So some philosophers say. But I hold to the idea that good is good if done for good.”</p><p>“That’s quite a revolving door. So, you say that my regaining honor in the Wizarding World would be for the good?”</p><p>“That depends on you. If you opted to use your status and power for good, then why shouldn’t you be given the opportunity to redeem yourself?”</p><p>He lifts his cup to me, eyes glittering in the low light of my lab. “Here’s hoping, then, that redemption is more than a fairytale that Gryffindor parents tell their children to help them go to sleep at night.”</p><p>We lapse into silence at that pronouncement, but it is almost comfortable. My mind is spinning with this turn of events. First it was tea with Lucius Malfoy, and now it has evolved to tea and philosophy with Lucius Malfoy. </p><p>I’m absolutely baffled. </p><p>A thought occurs to me, then.</p><p>“Your presence here in the Research Sector seems more than chance to me, Lucius. Is this part of your quest for redemption?”</p><p>His mouth flattens into half of a grimace. “As a matter of fact, I came here to meet with the head researcher in charge of finding a cure. It seems that I am immune to Dragon Pox.”</p><p>My body convulses of its own accord, sloshing piping hot tea into my lap.</p><p>“Dammit!”</p><p>I’m on my feet in a trice, the tea scalding my skin through my jeans. I mutter a string of curses and fumble for my wand. </p><p>Lucius beats me to the punch. He rises to his feet and whips his wand out of his cane in one smooth motion. He mutters a quiet ‘scourgify’ before I can even get to my wand. The relief is instant, though I can tell I’ll have a light burn on my legs from the tea.</p><p>“Th-thank you.”</p><p>He slides his wand home in his cane and regards me with his steel-grey eyes. “Of course. Do let’s try not to sling tea around in the future, though.”</p><p>I pierce him with a glare. “That wasn’t my intention, clearly. And pardon me for being caught off guard by this news. No one bothered to tell me that we had discovered anyone with immunity, despite this being directly my business.”</p><p>His knuckles go white on his cane. “Perhaps it was because, until this moment, I was undecided on whether I would let this news be known to anyone.”</p><p>I jerk my head back. “Undecided? Your blood may hold the cure for the deadliest scourge to sweep the planet and you were undecided?”</p><p>“For one who speaks so boldly about redemption and the powers of good, you seem to have quite a naive understanding of the world. I have been soundly rejected by the society that made me what I am. I owe the Wizarding World no more than what they owe me. Which is nothing.”</p><p>My hands go to my hips. “This isn’t about owing. This is about saving lives - and not kittens, as you so condescendingly referred to it just moments ago.”</p><p>“You seemed quite happy to discuss the philosophical ramifications of doing good in that same conversation, if I recall correctly.”</p><p>“Pondering philosophy is one thing - did you come here to gauge whether or not the Ministry would serve your intentions and restore your honor, Mister Malfoy, or did you simply want to dangle hope in front of our eyes and whisk it away to the Manor once you had your fun?”</p><p>“So we’re back to formalities, are we, Miss Granger?” He takes a step forward, and the light in the room suddenly feels dimmer. “I came here undecided. No one can fault me for my reticence to undergo weeks of tests and humiliation at the hands of people who revile me. And I will not be faulted by a witch who was ready to hex me on sight not ten minutes ago. That I am here at all was a gamble, and not one that I made lightly. That I chose to disclose my immunity to you was another gamble, and perhaps one that I made foolishly.”</p><p>“So now you are a martyr?” I let every ounce of disdain in my body permeate my words. “You have a duty to wizardkind to-”</p><p>“I have a duty to myself,” he roars. And just as quickly as his fury surfaced, he folds it back into himself. “I owe nothing to anyone, not anymore. But, I do owe this to myself. I had hoped when I realized that you were in charge of this research, that you would have empathy for a cast out fool such as myself, but I fear I have made a severe miscalculation.”</p><p>I clench my jaw. Everything in me screams for me to go somewhere else, get space, think through this impossible turn of events. But there’s nowhere for me to go. I open my mouth, then close it again.</p><p>Finally, I cross my arms over my chest. “You have not miscalculated.”</p><p>“That has yet to be seen.”</p><p>I bite back the anger that is seething under my skin. It’s no use for us to yell at each other until we are blue in the face.</p><p>“You haven’t miscalculated,” I repeat, and force myself to take a deep, calming breath. “I was caught off guard, and while I do not apologize for that, I do apologize for losing my composure.”</p><p>The beginning of a smirk colors his mouth. “That was quite a measured apology, and one that would make any Slytherin proud.”</p><p>We stare at each other, neither willing to give any more ground. We are standing several feet away, but it feels as if we are stuck together in a broom closet. It’s almost as if any wrong move could send us spiraling out of control again. </p><p>Slowly, as if he would spook me at any moment, he sets his cane down to rest against the chair. He then extends his hand to me, an offer of a handshake. </p><p>“Now you know why I am here. And, as there is no hope for me to - what was it - whisk myself back to the Manor, I put myself and my immunity in your hands. Do with it what you will.”</p><p>I squint my eyes as if I could see through any ruse that he might attempt. It is a futile attempt, and I see no other choice in front of me, so I take two steps forward and grip his hand in mine.</p><p>“You must do everything I say. I will do my very best to make this as comfortable as possible for you, but with so much at stake, I must be indelibly thorough. I will need your implicit cooperation at every turn.”</p><p>His hand tightens around mine, and a surge of warmth floods my body. “I will endeavor to be the picture of a perfect patient, Miss Granger.”</p><p>I let my hand linger a moment longer, then let it drop to my side. “Hermione, please.”</p><p>“Hermione.” My name rolls off his tongue as if he’s sampling a fine wine. “Where do we begin?”</p>
