    <p>It was not unknown that the teachers of Hogwarts were beginning to have a hard time. Severus knew that ever since the Slytherins had so subtly moved against the Gryffindors, something like this would probably happen. Dumbledore was up in fits about everything. With Slytherin finally being the house that was not being discriminated against, but his own lovely lions, the man was likely to go insane any time soon. While Severus may have seen something like this coming, that did not mean that he was too pleased at the lack of warning in which he was given by his lovely snakes. He would have much preferred to have been warned beforehand that they were planning something, and therefore had been better prepared for when Dumbledore dragged him, and all of the other professors, into his office to talk about what he deemed problematic. </p><p>“Dumbledore, I am certain that you know just as well as I that there is nothing that can be done. We have no evidence of the students doing anything, and nor do we have any evidence that those students were Slytherins in the first place. We cannot simply throw every Slytherin in the school out of school just over assumptions.” McGonagall attempted to reason. Severus smirked at the effort. He knew exactly who had crooked up this whole plan. Tom Riddle, and Draco Malfoy, the two were the brightest minds found in a millennium, to think that they would not obtain revenge for how the gryffindors had been treating them whilst at the Black household was simply ludicrous. Especially since it was Draco who had the rights and not Harry, to the Black name and household. Severus would not be entirely surprised if that mix up was cleared very soon. </p><p>“Well then, it is time to find that evidence do you not think?” Dumbledore asked curiously, peering over his spectacles. At this, Severus needed to intervene. While he had no problem with Dumbledore for the most part, the fact that there was no evidence and the man was already accusing his Snakes of doing something like his was preposterous. Even though the man was right in his suspicions, it did not change the fact that he still had nothing to go off of, no evidence to prove his assumptions. Such things always led to lapses in investigations, and while he was well aware that Draco and Tom had likely not left any evidence to go off of, he was most certainly not going to risk anything.</p><p>”Now, Dumbledore, there is no evidence that it was the Slytherins in the first place. It could have been, and it could have not. Do not go accusing before you have evidence to prove your accusations.” Dumbledore stared at Severus, slightly surprised that the other had dead to go against him. Usually, Severus did not really care much to speak up in the investigations, but this was something that he simply could not allow to continue. If it thwarted Dumbledore’s findings of who the exact culprits were, even better, in Severus’ mind.</p>
