          <div class="userstuff"><p>Harry stumbled to the ground. Clawing at his throat as he tried to breathe. It felt like someone had wrapped a band around his throat and he couldn’t get a sliver of air into his lungs, which felt like they might explode from the pressure. The pain grew and grew and Harry continued to desperately claw at his throat until he finally blacked out.</p><p>Harry’s head was pounding like someone had hit him with a rock when he woke up. He opened his eyes, then immediately closed them again when the bright light in the room made his head feel like it might split in two. </p><p>When the worst of the pain disappeared he tried again, this time just barely peering out at the room from under his eyelashes. He could only see the blurry outlines of furniture. </p><p>“Hello?” He croaked out, wincing at his raw throat.</p><p>“Hello! You’re awake!” A way too loud voice answered. “My name is Hannah Jackson. I’m your nurse. You seem to be in quite a bit of pain, do you want me to get you some painkillers?” </p><p>The vague outline of someone at the corner of his vision appeared and soon a cool hand touched his forehead.</p><p>“You don’t seem to have a fever so you should be able to sleep off the worse of the pain.” The nurse said kindly.</p><p>“Alright.” Harry wheezed out. “Where am I?” He tried to sit up, then immediately fell back down on the pillows, groaning in pain.</p><p>“You’re at the hospital. Just sit tight and I’ll go get those painkillers for you.”</p><p>With those words the nurse left and Harry closed his eyes in defeat.</p><p>That’s how Harry spent the first few days back in time. He’d awaken occasionally, take a painkiller or two and then fall back asleep. When he finally managed to get out of this tedious routine he had to face another problem: he wasn’t at a wizard hospital. There wasn’t anything wrong with the hospital, in fact, it was a rather nice one with clean rooms and kind nurses, but still a muggle one.</p><p>He left as soon as he could walk without feeling like he might fall over and wrote down a random address on the sheet of paper one of the nurses gave him. Silently apologizing to the person who’d get his bill.</p><p>Another nurse had taken pity on him and given him one of her husband's old suits when she saw his own ruined clothes. It was a bit too big, but it fit well enough and when he walked out he couldn’t help but note how fancy it looked compared to the clothes a lot of the people on the street wore.</p><p>He was still in London, thankfully, and decided to walk to the Diagon Alley instead of <em>apparating</em>. Still exhausted and weak from using the time turned Hermione had given him. Apparently, it wasn’t made to travel back fifty years.</p><p>The air was thick with smoke and the people on the streets were all too busy to look at him so he fiddled with his wand as he walked. Only glad he hadn’t lost that too. The time turner he’d used must’ve fallen out of his pocket when he wasn’t looking and was long gone by now. He wasn’t even sure where he’d arrived and he certainly couldn’t retrace his steps after he’d passed out.</p><p>After a few hours his stomach started to protest at the lack of food and his feet ached from the unfamiliar and large shoes he was wearing. When he finally arrived at Diagon Alley he felt like he might pass out if he had to take another step. So he hurried to check-in at a hotel, giving the lady in the reception a few of the coins he’d thought to bring with him.</p><p>The room he’d ordered was small but cozy and he fell asleep as soon as he lay down on the mattress.</p><p>The next few days were spent shopping for clothes and supplies. He even managed to take a small loan at Gringotts under the alias Harry Smith. The goblins had looked at him suspiciously but he’d shown them all the gold he’d brought and ensured them that he could pay them back. When he was finished the first day back at Hogwarts had already passed, so he gave himself two days to relax before he figured out what to do next.</p><p>The first day was rather nice. The weather was warm and the sky a striking blue and he spent almost the entire day on the broom he’d splurged on. He even decided to treat himself to a rather nice dinner in a quiet diner just a few houses from his hotel.</p><p>The second day didn’t seem to share the same sentiment, though. Harry woke up with a scream lodged in his throat in the middle of the night. His sleep shirt was soaked through and he smelled like sweat and fear. He hurried into the small bathroom, just barely managing to puke into the sink instead of on the floor. </p><p>He’d been waiting for this. These last days he’d been so busy and skittish that he’d somehow avoided thinking of anything other than his next step. Now he had all of the time in the world to despair on his last day in the future. </p><p>He remembered how he’d slipped on bloodstains in the great hall trying to escape Voldemort’s army. How Ginny had been too slow to follow and had been swallowed up by the masses of death eaters advancing on them. </p><p>He’d failed them all. The savior. The golden boy had run away with his tail tucked between his legs whilst his friends were being slaughtered. Without Hermione’s time turner he’d be dead too, he knew without a doubt. Voldemort had ceased Hogwarts and everyone who’d fought against him had been killed. So Harry had been sent away in the last possible second. Forced into a narrow corridor with Hermione’s time turner whilst his friends protected him for the last time. </p><p>A black churning hatred bubbled up inside Harry. So strong it felt like he might choke on it. All those years spent in fear and pain all because of one man. </p><p>Harry had always had a short fuse and easily became mad. He’d even admit to being prone to take rash decisions and going on hopeless missions. But he’d never felt quite like this. All of his hopes for a normal life were gone and he was stuck <em>here</em>. </p><p>Even his friends were all either dead or apart of Voldemort’s army. Harry’s fist struck the wall and he let out a frustrated scream at the pain raising through his fingers and arm. Why could things never go the way they were supposed to? Why was he constantly being punished? Even the time turner hadn’t worked like it was supposed to.</p><p>He’d only meant to travel back a few weeks, maybe a month at most. But somehow he’d ended up here, almost fifty years back in time with no way to get back.</p><p>The only thing he could do now was to return to Hogwarts and try to figure something out there. And if he didn’t remember incorrectly, Harry thought darkly, he should have at least one ally there. Even if it was scheming Professor.</p><p>Tom stroked Nagini’s soft skin, slowly tracing the slight ridges and groves on it. The snake laid curled up in his lap hissing every once in a while. Over him, only a few meters, was the entire castle. Most of the Slytherins were gathered in gropes waiting for class to start. He’d usually be with them, but he’d gotten an interesting note the day before and decided that skipping his first class was worth knowing who could slip notes into his pockets. Though he had a sneaking suspicion he already knew who it was. </p><p>Just a few months ago, soon after school started a new student hade come to Hogwarts. This wasn’t unusual per se and Tom wouldn’t have cared if it wasn’t for the fact that the boy wasn’t acting like he was supposed to. In fact, he seemed intent on doing the opposite of what people expected. </p><p>He came barging in during dinner, causing the student and teachers alike to stare dumbfounded at the spitfire of a boy. He marched without a doubt along the rows of tables until he was standing in front of the teachers' table. </p><p>Then he demanded to talk to Professor Dumbledore. The boy had refused to move until he got what he wanted and soon left with the professor and headmaster. Tom had only been able to witness the scene. Intrest and something almost akin to admiration filling him from inside. He’d never seen any of the teachers fold to a student like that. He was both a bit shocked and impressed that no one had done anything to stop the boy once he got inside the school.</p><p>What had eradicated that shock was when the day after the headmaster declared that this boy, “Harry” was to start at the school immediately and stay in the Gryffindor tower. The almost kin-ship he’d felt for the boy immediately draining away, instead replaced by a bitterness that seemed to fester in the coming months. Of course the boy was a brave <em>stupid</em> little Gryffindor.</p><p>But the boy wasn’t like the other Gryffindor’s. On the first day of his classes, he’d proudly marched up to a poor Ravenclaw and asked if he could sit with him. That’s how it started. The boy simply refused to abide by the unwritten laws in the school and now he had allies in all of the houses. Tom had been forced to watch as the boy lured people over to his side with every passing day. </p><p>This yet minor disruption was putting his stick in his earlier smooth wheel. He couldn’t have people sympathizing with each other or they might not be willing to do was necessary to win the coming war. And Tom hadn’t come this far to lose to anyone, especially not a boy from Gryffindor who was a year younger than himself.</p><p>And yet, almost three months later Tom had to admit to being reluctantly mystified. Harry hadn’t just been welcomed into the Gryffindor house, or the other more neutral ones, he’d even managed to nestle himself inside Slytherin! Some of Tom’s own servants had been so charmed by his act that they didn’t stop him from entering and leaving the Slytherin chambers as he pleased. Tom supposed might have left an opportunity to sneak into Tom’s room and place that note in his pocket. He’d have to make sure to ward his belongings better in the future.</p><p>He stoked Nagini skin again, the gesture almost comforting when the door to the common room opened and unsurprisingly Harry walked in. </p><p>“Are we alone?” He asked as he walked over to where Tom was sitting.</p><p>His big green eyes were staring unwaveringly at him. Only barely concealed by messy hair and ugly glasses. The boy certainly didn’t seem to lack the Gryffindor bravery he supposed. Even his friends tended to avoid looking directly at him. He remembered how one of the girls at one of the orphanages he’d stayed at had one day told him that they were unsettling, a frozen blue with small pupils.</p><p>“Yes.” Tom said.</p><p>Harry nodded and sat down in the plush green chair right in front of Tom. They both eyed each other for a few seconds and Tom spend that time noting that Harry didn’t seem to have his wand quite within reach.</p><p>“I need you to help me sneak out into the Forbidden Forest.” Harry said. Eyes finally leaving him and instead of moving on to flit over the furniture in the room. </p><p>“What do you want from the Forbidden Forest?” Tom asked. 

Leaning forward only just barely. Of all the things he’d imagined, this wasn’t it. </p><p>“I need to talk to a creature that lives there.” Harry replied, fingers fiddling with the hem of his robe.</p><p>“And what creature would that be?” 

He wouldn’t take Harry anywhere without knowing the details first.</p><p>“It’s a spider. A very, very big one that is hiding in there. And it has to be at night, no one can know that we went.” Harry said.</p><p>Tom let out a puff of air.</p><p>“Let me get this straight: you want me to help you sneak out - at night, into the Forbidden Forest, so that you can have a chat with the giant spider hiding somewhere out there?” Tom finally said. 

Barely comprehending that this was what the golden Gryffindor boy wanted from him.</p><p>“Pretty much?”</p><p>“And please do remind me as to why I would ever help you?” Tom asked. </p><p>He wouldn’t deny that he was curious about the boy, and sneaking out in the middle of the night and wandering into the Forbidden Forest was certainly a good way to get to know someone. But Tom wasn’t in the habit of giving out free favors.</p><p>“Because I think you’ll want to meet this spider too.” Harry replied without a moment’s doubt. Eyes once again finding Tom’s.</p><p>“Why would I ever want to meet a creature like that?” Tom leaned back, growing bored the boy’s excuses. </p><p>“Because it knows that you killed Moaning Myrtle.”</p><p>Tom froze in his seat for a sliver of a second. Then his wand was out and in a hairs breath Nagini hit the floor with a deep thump and an angry hiss, but Tom barely noticed. Already out of his chair and pressing Harry’s up against his.</p><p>“And how would you know anything about that?” Tom sneered, face inches from Harry’s. Tom’s wand pressed to Harry's throat, he watched the boy’s Adam’s apple moved as he swallowed.</p><p>“I know the guy who you got expelled for the crime you committed.” Harry managed to get out, voice trembling just enough for Tom to know that he was afraid.</p><p>“Hagrid?”</p><p>“Yeah. He’s a good guy. I knew there was something wrong the moment he got expelled.”</p><p>“So you came to Hogwarts to find me.” Tom mused, slightly amused and slightly impressed by his dedication. Tough not enough to shift his grip on the boy.</p><p>“But what will I do with you now? I can’t have people knowing I killed that poor <em>pathetic</em> girl.” Tom asked, pressing his wand just a bit closer to let Harry know of the threat.</p><p>“I won’t tell anyone. I didn’t tell anyone before and if you just take me to the spider no one will ever know.” Harry promised, a slight sheen of sweat coating his luminescent skin. It looked so soft, so breakable and with a quick move, Tom snatched back his wand. He couldn’t very well kill the boy now. It’d been dumb luck that the girl hadn’t seen anything. A murder in one of the common rooms was an entirely different thing. So he took a step back and looked over the boy.</p><p>He was short and his robes wrinkly, but there was a fire in him. Tom had watched him charm everyone he meets, one after one, with almost as much efficiency as himself. If he wanted to he could tell them all the truth and they’d believe it. </p><p>Tom righted his robes, looked around the empty common room and then said:</p><p>“It looks like you have a deal, Harry.”</p><p>Harry almost skipped out of the dungeons. High on adrenaline and victory. He almost couldn’t believe it, but he’d done it! At eleven o’clock, exactly one hour after curfew in two days he’d have the Slytherin heir right where he wanted him.</p><p>The months since he’d gone back in time had been filled with sorrow for all that he’d lost, despair that he was stuck here, but most of all a burning, consuming anger that almost seemed to choke him. He’d been burning with the desire to see Tom suffer the same way he’d seen the people Voldemort killed at the final battle suffer.</p><p>Today was the first step in his plan to make sure that Voldemort never got the chance to hurt people as he had in Harry’s timeline. Since his arrival at Hogwarts, he’d become better at hiding his true feelings but now, in the empty corridor he was walking through, he let it all go. Almost stumbling over his feet in his haste to get to back his room and fetch his broom.</p><p>Lately Quidditch had become his safe haven. The only place where he didn’t constantly have to consider what to do, who to talk to and how to act. It was just he and his broom and the adrenaline coursing through his veins. The fear from doing just a few too many spins until he was dizzy from it, or when he’d dive straight down, toes just barely gracing the ground as he turned in the last possible second were almost painfully familiar by now.</p><p>Harry ran out towards the field and open sky as soon as he’d located his broom. Hands practically shaking with excitement he sat on the broom and flew towards the sky. Shamelessly letting he harsh wind steal away any and all of his thoughts.</p><p>The coming days seemed to drag by and he couldn’t focus on anything. He almost blew his partner up in potion and spilled his drink all over himself at dinner when Tom caught his eyes. He even managed to mess up a spell so badly that he turned the girl’s hair next to him blue. </p><p>And yet, when the day arrived he carried a heavy feeling with him all day. And watch solemnly as the sun finally disappeared beneath the horizon and the clocks rang out the curfew. He laid in his bed, staring up a the ceiling. Occasionally he’d hear a rustle as one of his roommates shifted in their beds but other than that it was silent. How long had he longed for this day? Had wished for it so hard it seemed impossible, but now, it felt wrong. He’d lost so much, the pain still tearing at his insides every time he thought back to his old life. </p><p>A quote floated unbidden into his head: <em>kill the spiders to save the butterflies, but it, in the end, doesn’t that make you the spider</em>? Harry tried to shake it, but it stuck his mind like a wet rag, soaking his every thought with guilt. But Harry hadn’t come this far to back down. Honour and justice had only brought his friends, his <em>family</em> pain and despair. He’d serve his own pain and morals on a silver platter as long as it meant his friends would survive. </p><p>The great battle at Hogwarts hadn’t just been a failure, it had been a complete and utter defeat. Voldemort had taken over the school in just a few short hours and Harry had been forced to escape. His friends had stayed to fight and just as he left he’d heard Ron cry out in pain and Hermione’s answering one in despair. Even Professor McGonagall had died that night, hit with a spell in her back as she was dueling. </p><p>One hour after curfew he silently slipped from his bed, checking to make sure that the boys he shared the room with were asleep and then slipped out of the room. The lady in the portrait was sleeping too when he opened the door to the castle, but she muttered something under her breath and Harry’s heart almost leaped out of his chest. </p><p>Two corridors down, through one of the long halls on the right, down a few flights of stairs and few corridors and twists then he arrived. The dungeons. They were dark and gloomy at night. Only lit by the occasional torch on the wall that flickered in the slightly chilly breeze that seemed to come from further down, deep in the castle. The air itself wasn’t fresh and warm like in the rest of the castle either, it was just a bit too cold and there was a witness to it which stuck to Harry's skin and robes. Harry reluctantly leaned against one of the cold stone walls when he realized that he was almost ten minutes early. His previous haste quickly disappearing along with the cold air flowing through the corridors.</p><p>He crossed his arms over his chest hard enough that it felt more like an embrace rather than insecurity. He cursed himself for being early and tried not to think about what he’d soon be doing. That he’d soon truly be beyond redemption and that if his friends could see him now, they’d never forgive him. One minute, two, three... he snatched back his wand and forced himself not to cast any more <em>tempus</em> charms. </p><p>To distract himself he decided to think of the Dursley’s. He could still imagine the little room under the stairs they’d forced him to live in for so long. He remembered Dudley’s endless teasing and his host parents' cruel words. But as he thought he had a dreadful realization. He didn’t want them to die. He’d had never wanted them to. No matter how bad they’d treated him he still didn’t wish for them to be punished in such away. </p><p>But here he was, about to deliver that punishment to another human being. Another living, breathing human being. It would’ve been different if it was Voldemort, nothing about him could be taken for a human. With his noseless face and sickly pale skin, he looked like he a corpse risen from the grave. That was not a creature Harry would’ve hesitated to kill.</p><p>Tom was different, though. He was alive in a way that Voldemort never had been. Harry had seen him laugh with his friends, charm his teachers and flirt with the girls sitting next to him. How that Tom would grow up to become Voldemort Harry couldn’t understand.</p><p>Harry tried to force back that anger he’d been carrying since the battle of Hogwarts but it seemed to have gone up in smoke. Like it’d been a mask he’d pulled on. One that was now laying in broken shards on the floor. Instead, the only thing he felt was that same choking guilt and pain as before. </p><p>Perhaps he’d truly broken in these last months. He hated it, but Tom that lived and thrived at Hogwarts wasn’t the same man who’d killed his parents, family, and friends. How could he lead someone to their death when that someone could be redeemed?</p><p>From his right he heard the soft sound of a robe dragging along the floor and in a second Tom was there. His wand was lit in a Lumos spell which created an eerie light compared to the torches’ light. Harry swallowed down the feelings that felt like they might choke him and righted himself.</p><p>“Tom.” Harry nodded to him, uncrossing his arms and walked up beside him.</p><p>“Come on,” Tom looked down at him disdainfully. “I want to get this over with.” </p><p>With those words he strode down the corridor. Forcing Harry to a light jog to keep up with him. Harry had noticed this before about him. The air of confidence and arrogance he seemed to carry around him like a heavy cloud, weighing down everyone around him. But Harry refused to show any sign of weakness around him. If he did it might very well be his demise. Harry wasn’t stupid and he knew he wasn’t just risking Tom’s life tonight. It certainly wouldn’t surprise him if Tom tried something. He’d already killed someone after all. </p><p>But there was one thing Harry was certain about, and that was the no matter what happened tonight, one of them wouldn’t leave the woods ever again. He’d made up his mind, now he just had to act.</p><p>Tom wasn’t mad, he was furious. These last days had been torture. His previous rather innocent and purely logical obsession with the boy beside him had grown to its own being inside his mind. He spent all his time with thoughts of Harry flitting through his mind like a disgustingly ordinary teenage boy might obsess over his latest infatuation. It was humiliating and almost cruel seeing how unaffected Harry seemed to be. Every meal he’d stare at the boy, watch him socialize with the other members of his house and to his own dismay, feel the same small hurt that Harry wasn’t as intent on him as he seemed to be at them. </p><p>But these two days hadn’t just been spent in a weird state of pining and anger, instead he’d made sure he knew everything he could about the boy. </p><p>Unfortunately there wasn’t much to know. </p><p>On the outside he was as ordinary as anyone else, decent grades, only excelling in defense against dark arts. Quidditch seeker with a good, yet not extraordinary talent. But most infuriating of all, it almost seemed like he hadn’t existed before the start of school. No one had heard of him. He had no childhood friends that remembered him, even his parents were impossible to pin down. Harry was a too neatly packed packet to be true. In fact, Tom knew there was something, something that was hiding just out of reach and if could just <em>grab</em> it-</p><p>“You sure this is the best way to go?” Harry asked beside him. </p><p>The boy had a slight flush on his cheeks and his breath was just a bit harsher than before. He looked...good like that. Eyes glinting from the moonlight, cheeks red and soft and lips parted ever so slightly. If he just wanted he could lift his hand and touch those lips for himself, or even better, lean down-</p><p>Tom shock that thought away almost as violent as he’d throw a punch. An obsession was one thing. He refused to let it become an even more inconvenient one.</p><p>“Yes.” He said. Ignoring Harry’s doubtful look and marched on over the wet grass.</p><p>Soon though Tom slowed down a bit, just as they entered the forest. The Forbidden Forest was almost its own being, and it made it clear that it didn’t want them to be there. Tom had to suppress a shudder when the cold air sneaked inside his robes, chilling him to the bone. </p><p>“I’d forgotten it felt like this.” Harry whispered beside him, trembling in his even thinner clothes.</p><p>“You’ve been here before?” Tom frowned. “Why did you need my help then?”</p><p>“I- I’ve only been this far, I was too scared to go further in.” Harry said. </p><p>Something with that statement didn’t sit right with Tom. Harry didn’t seem like he’d run from danger, more like he’d run towards it with open arms. But he didn’t want to stay here longer than necessary and forced himself to let it go. </p><p>“Give me your hand.” Tom said.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Your hand, come on.” Tom took up his wand. </p><p>Slowly Harry lifted his hand, looking doubtful. </p><p>“Why- ow!”</p><p>A thin line of blood appeared on Harry’s hand. Tom quickly cast the same spell on himself and then clasped his hand with Harry’s bloody one. </p><p>“Promise you won’t tell anyone about anything you know of the murder of moaning Myrtle.”</p><p>Harry’s eyes darkened but he repeated what Tom said. </p><p>“Good. Now that that is over with, let’s go.”</p><p>Tom walked further into the dark forest, ignoring the eerie silence. He’d been here a few times now and the feel of the forest wasn’t as invasive as it had been before he’d created his first Horcrux, but he wasn’t stupid enough not to be varied. Many dark creatures roomed here and he wasn’t sure he could take them all.</p><p>He had a vague map in his mind of the forest and there were only certain places that could house a large spider. He decided to keep his pace slow and let Harry catch up with him. When he breathed a bit easier and didn’t glare at Tom constantly the boy finally said something.</p><p>“Why do you think you are so much better than everyone else?”</p><p>Tom might’ve been offended by the question had he not agreed. He did think he was better than every weak wizard and witch in this place. He was Slytherin’s heir after all. And he certainly didn’t lack the power that was expected from him. So he shrugged offhandedly.</p><p>“Because I am.”</p><p>“Even the teachers?” Harry pressed. </p><p>Tom was about to nod right before he thought of Professor Dumbledore. There was no doubt he was more powerful and clever than his colleagues. The rest of the teachers he got away with treated badly as long as he sometimes said a few kindhearted lies. Dumbledore had seen through his act immediately and ever since the first day had kept a too close eye on him, and it’d only gotten worse after Moaning Myrtle. </p><p>“Most of them, yes.”</p><p>“So not Dumbledore?”</p><p>Ahhhh, and there it was. That strangeness Harry brought with him. Tom knew that no one else suspected animosity between him and the Professor and yet Harry had figured it out. Gryffindor’s weren’t supposed to be this observant, especially not a new student who only just recently figured out that fraternizing with the other houses wasn’t considered appropriate in most cases.</p><p>“Perhaps.” Tom replied, letting the words hang in the air as they walked on.</p><p>When they reached the big boulder Tom been leading them to he had to suppress a shudder. What if this spider wasn’t as friendly as Harry seemed to think it was. It certainly wouldn’t surprise Tom if it tried to eat them. They walked around the big rock and Tom pointed at the big hole leading under the rock. </p><p>“You think this is the right place?”</p><p>Harry shook his head. “Hagrid said it lived in the middle of the forest, in some sort of clearing that can only be accessed under the trees.”</p><p>“And you couldn’t have told me this earlier?” Tom bit out, cursing himself for not thinking to ask.</p><p>“I could, but then I wouldn’t have seen the look on your face right now.” Harry said, smirking that perfect, teasing, Gryffindor smile.</p><p>Tom snarled and walked up to him. The boy was interesting, but if he tried to make fun of Tom again he wouldn’t like the result. He pressed his entire body up against Harry’s, forcing him to take a few steps back. </p><p>“I’m not kind, Harry. You don’t want to make me mad.” Tom said lowly in his ear. A deep rumble in his voice then turned around and stalked further into the woods.</p><p>“Come on then, we haven’t got all night.”</p><p>Harry hurried after him, only a bit frightened by Tom’s actions. This was more of what he’d expected from the infamous Slytherin heir: threats and anger. </p><p>What had caught him completely of guard and shamed him more than it should be how quickly he’d noticed how <em>good</em> Tom was a being angry. When Harry was upset he felt like a child, screaming cause its favorite toy broke. When Tom had loomed over him Harry could practically have tasted his anger in the air, and it was intoxicating. The power rush he got from making this dangerous person mad going straight to his head.</p><p>An even more traitorous part of him couldn’t help but note that Tom was even more attractive when he was angry. His eyes blazing and so <em>alive</em> it almost felt like it couldn’t be real. He was like a snake in that way, beautiful and graceful, yet unpredictable and dangerous.</p><p>They continued through the forest and eventually Tom slowed down enough to let Harry catch up with him again. This time though Harry didn’t get to ask the question, Tom did.</p><p>“Where are you from, Harry...<em>Smith.</em>”</p><p>Harry chuckled at Tom’s tone, though he was almost relieved by this question. Before he’d arrived at Hogwarts he’d made sure to have his cover story down to a T. </p><p>“I’m from a bit of everywhere. My parents didn’t want me and decided to hand me over to a muggle orphanage.” <em>(Hard to trace.)</em> “I got adopted a few times, but it never worked out.” <em>(Easy to sympathize with, yet no one ever asked more.)</em> “Eventually I got my letter from Hogwarts and I figured out that I was a wizard. Didn’t have any money though, so I stayed in the muggle word to earn some.” <em>(No one here knew anything about the muggle world and they never asked a question he couldn’t answer. All too willing to believe anyone would hire a homeless orphan in the muggle world.)</em> “Then I heard of a man whose name was Dumbledore and figured that as long as I knew of one person here I could figure the rest as I went.” Harry neatly finished up with a bow at the end.</p><p>“So you decided that arriving late, terrifying half the school and demanding an audience with the man was the right way to go about it?” </p><p>Was Harry hearing things or did Tom almost sound amused? </p><p>“Well, it seemed like a good decision at the time.”</p><p>Tom muttered something under his breath, but now Harry could almost hear the smile in his voice. </p><p>“Do you often visit the Forbidden Forest? You seem familiar with it.” Harry asked to fill the silence that once again settled over them.</p><p>And Tom did, he never stepped wrong, robes never getting caught in bushes trees and definitely never had to wipe spiderwebs from his face as Harry did. </p><p>“I go when I need to.” Tom answered, stepping over a dark puddle in the grass. </p><p>Harry tried to follow his example, but his legs weren’t as long and the heel of his shoe touched the thick, sticky liquid.</p><p>“Good job, that’ll be stuck forever.” Tom said without looking over his shoulder.</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>“You don’t want to know.” </p><p>They kept walking for what seemed like hours, but the sky didn’t get lighter som Harry hoped that they hadn’t been here for that long. Though he couldn’t actually see the sky, just the thick leaves covering them like a ceiling. But surely at least some light would shine through if the morning was coming?</p><p>They had to stop a few times when the silence wasn’t just eerie, but buzzing with excitement. Almost as it wished for blood to be spilled. Harry wasn’t that tense most of the time, though. He actually felt safe around this Tom. With his unwavering confidence and surety, he seemed like something the creatures in even the Forbidden Forest would want to avoid. Harry was only glad that it wasn’t a full moon tonight. He’d had enough of running away from faster creatures than him in the forest for a lifetime.</p><p>Harry had decided to put his true plans firmly at the back of his head and only think of them when necessary. So instead he kept up with a rather light and surprisingly nice conversation with Tom as they walked.</p><p>Tom was smart in an arrogant, somewhat charming way and he seemed rather interested in whatever Harry said. Not even Ron or Hermione could stand his constantly jumping mind a lot of the time. Instead, they rather enjoyed each other’s company in silence or made sure to keep the conversation on one topic, even when Harry’s mind threatened to spiral away.</p><p>The quick thought of his old friends sobered Harry up, though. Here he was, casually chatting with their murderer. The ache in his chest reared back and he had to swallow hard to keep his voice from breaking even just a bit.</p><p>They couldn’t be far away now. He only had to make it through this one night, then it’d be over. He could put all of this behind him. But first, there was just one more thing he had to ask.</p><p>“Tom... Are you going you kill again? I mean... Do you <em>want</em> to kill people?” Voldemort had undeniably liked seeing people cower at his feet and would laugh as he tortured his servants and prisoners alike. Tom didn’t seem to enjoy it the same way Voldemort had.</p><p>Tom stopped and looked at Harry. His eyes moving over his features and suddenly Harry felt very small, like nothing more than a fly under brief scrutiny before it was ruthlessly killed. </p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Harry’s heart sank.</p><p>“But... why?” Harry tried, voice just a little desperate. “Why not just... do something else? There are a million things you could do and achieve that don’t involve murder.”</p><p>Tom took a step towards him. Then another when Harry didn’t move out of the way. They were almost as close as they’d been before, only this time it felt more intimate, personal. Invasive. </p><p>“Because I’m a bad man, Harry. You’ll do good to remember that.” Tom said in a hushed voice, breath tickling the skin on Harry’s cheek and for a moment Harry could’ve sworn Tom was going to kiss him. Wanted him to. But in the next one, Tom was gone and Harry could only feel the cold air that rushed to chill his heated cheeks.</p><p>“Let’s go. We’re almost there and if we hurry we might have enough time to sleep for a bit when we get back to the castle.”</p><p>The rest of their track was spent intense silence. Filled with unspoken words and actions. Though Harry finally started to recognize where they were. He remembered a big tree that he and Ron passed with the car all those years ago. As they got closer he couldn’t help but notice the increase in spiders, and though he wasn’t scared of them like Ron was he caught himself looking to make sure none of them were on him.</p><p>There weren’t as many as there had been when he and Ron had been here though. Which made sense, considering Aragon was younger now then he’d been then.</p><p>“There!” Harry shouted when he finally spotted the entrance to the spiders' lair. He bent down, looking at the hole, almost confused by how small it seemed now. The dark made the tunnel appear longer than it was and Harry dreaded having to enter it.</p><p>“Tom?” Harry asked when the other boy didn’t say anything. There was no breeze but Harry could’ve sworn he heard the leaves rustle. The forest was alive again. That same awful buzzing electricity in the air.</p><p>Still no answer. </p><p>Harry slowly turned around. Tom was standing in front of him, wand raised and determination set on his face. </p><p>“Tom? What are you doing?” Harry said, already knowing the answer.</p><p>“It’s nothing personal Harry. I promise. But if you continue like before you might ruin all my plans. I can’t let you live.” </p><p>Tom even had the audacity to look sorry. Which Harry might have marveled at in any other situation. One where Tom wasn’t about to kill him.</p><p>Harry swallowed. He just needed to think. To come up with something. Anything! Why hadn’t he been holding his own wand? God, he was so stupid. He’d known Tom would try something and he’d practically walked into Tom’s trap of attentive silence and clever observations. </p><p>“Okay, I understand. Just!” Tom raised his wand just a bit higher until it was pointing straight at his heart. “Just, let me talk to the spider, okay? I’ll even give you my wand; here!” Harry tossed his wand Tom’s feet. “Just let me talk to it.” Harry pleaded. </p><p>Now he could only hope Aragon would sympathize with his cause and that he had a big enough army to take down Tom.</p><p>A moment passed. Then another. Nothing happened. </p><p>“Fine. I don’t wish to kill you Harry, but you’ve left me no choice.” Tom finally said bending down and picking up Harry’s wand. Harry wasn’t sure whether to be flattered or offended by Tom’s other words so he decided to ignore them.</p><p>” Promise me.” Harry pressed, praying he wasn’t pushing Tom too far.</p><p>“I promise to let you live until you’ve spoken with the spider.” Tom said. “Now-You first.” Tom made a swooping gesture at the hole in the ground and Harry stepped in.</p><p>The small passage was covered in spiders, crawling over all of the walls, ceiling, and floor. Harry walked as quickly as he could and tried not to think about them. </p><p>Finally, they were out and Harry stretched his back until it cracked satisfyingly. He walked a bit further into the clearing. The spiders were nowhere to be seen. Only a few suspiciously large ones in the tunnel had shown any sign of the flock of spiders that lived here. Even the ones in the tunnel seemed to have scattered of somewhere else now that they’d stepped out of it.</p><p>“Aragon?” Harry tried quietly at first. Checking around the clearing for a sign of the gigantic spider. He asked again, just a bit louder.</p><p>Nothing. </p><p>Tom cleared his throat and Harry couldn’t stop his heart from jumping at the sound. Why weren’t the spiders here? Perhaps they couldn’t hear him. Or maybe, this was the wrong place, a small traitorous part of Harry whispered at the back of his mind.</p><p>“Aragon!!” Harry finally roared. Panic truly gripping him for the first time in a long time. This was not how it ended. He hadn’t traveled back in time to die at the hands of Tom Riddle. </p><p>A deep creaking sound rumbled from beneath the ground and out of a hole on the other side of the clearing one big, hairy leg peaked out. Then another, and another, until Harry could see Aragon’s face. Could see the black wet eyes and large body.</p><p>“Who dare wake me?” The spider growled out into the night.</p><p>“I’m a friend of Hagrid. He told me to find you.” Harry answered, lifting his hands to show them empty.</p><p>“Hagrid? I have not seen Hagrid in years.” The spider rumbled.</p><p>” I know, he told me about you. What happened to you. He also told me that you and I might have a common enemy.”</p><p>Tom froze beside Harry. </p><p>“I recognise that-“</p><p>Harry didn’t let him finish. </p><p>“The boy who got Hagrid expelled. I brought him with me to you.”</p><p>”Harry-”</p><p>“Where is he?” Aragon hissed.</p><p>“Right here.” Harry directly pointed at Tom, saw the other boy’s eyes widen just a fraction. Then Harry turned around and ran.</p><p>Tom had had his wand in his hand, ready to cast a spell at any moment. But in the slightly better light in the clearing, the other wand had caught his notice. It was almost impossible similar to his own. It even felt right in his grip. He was so distracted by the eerily similar wands that he wasn’t listening to what Harry was saying. That was the only reason he was caught off guard when Harry turned around and sprinted off. The gigantic spider in front of him took a step closer but Tom ignored it. He was just about to <em>petrify</em> the stupid boy when he noticed the swarm of spiders around him. They seemed to have been conjured from thin air and they all had their eyes on him.</p><p>Tom cursed when he saw Harry leap into the hole in the ground and out of sight. He was just about to follow him when he noticed that the spider wasn’t just on the ground, they were all around him. Big ones, unnaturally so, slowly lowering themselves to the ground. Even the giant monster Harry had talked to, Aragon, seemed all too interested in eating him. </p><p>The name was oddly familiar and a realization struck Tom like lightning and he suddenly remembered the spider that Hagrid had kept with him at school. The one who’d run away before Tom could kill it. The earlier rather small creature had more than doubled in size and apparently found a home in the middle of the forest.</p><p>Why had he let his guard down? He’d practically let Harry lead him to his own death. He knew he should’ve killed the boy when he had the chance. Screw honor and his own curiosity for wanting to see what Harry had been so desperate for.</p><p>The large spider was now making an odd clicking sound which only seemed to further the other spiders' frenzy. He had to get out of here or he’d be these monsters dinner. </p><p>He cast every spell that came to mind as he ran towards the small entrance they’d come from. Blowing up monsters all around him until his robes, face, and shoes were covered in blood. He finally reached the entrance when an impossible big spider, almost as large as Aragon, leaped in front of him. Large snapping jaws managing to snip Tom’s wand in two when he raised it.</p><p>True fear finally filled Tom’s being and he had concentrate not to crack under the pressure of it. What was he going to do? Behind he could hear the other spiders closing in on him and he could swear he could feel one thin hairy leg touching the back of his neck as a spider slowly lowered itself to the ground behind him. The monster in front of him snapped its jaws again and Tom did the only thing he could think to do, and used Harry’s wand.</p><p>The spider blew up in a stream of blood and other fluids that all fell down on Tom. He didn’t think about that though, instead of jumping down into the hole, crawling through the passage and out into the forest. Killing Harry would have to wait. Now he just had to survive until he could get of the forest. </p><p>He stuffed his own broken wand into his pocket, gripped Harry’s tighter and thought; perhaps he shouldn’t kill the boy just yet. He was clever, he’d even fooled Tom! And, as Tom cast a quick glance down at the wand in his hand, still running as fast as he could. Their wand really did look a bit too similar.</p><p>The end.</p></div>
