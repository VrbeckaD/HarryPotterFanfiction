    <p>Harry had been hiding in the library in a dark corner reading a Muggle book he'd always loved. The Lord of the Rings. He loved the tale and had read every book written by the author. He just wanted to escape and get away and reading a grand adventure like this would help him do just that. He was soon so lost in the pages that he didn't notice anything around him. </p><p>Harry was shocked when he felt a pulse of powerful magic. He watched as his book began glowing. Suddenly, he was falling. </p><p>When he woke up he was laying in nice soft grass surrounded by trees. He laid there staring up at a startling blue sky and listening to birds sing happily. How had he gotten outside? He'd been in the library at school hadn't he? He was so comfortable. The weather was perfect maybe he would stay here for a while. He closed his eyes again and put his arms under his head. This was so relaxing. He was soon asleep again. </p><p>He woke to the sound of children laughing and giggling. He opened his eyes to see a girl leaning over him smiling. He blinked at her and she moved away so that he could sit up. She had long golden hair and blue eyes. He noted that she also had pointed ears. There were others around that had pointed ears too. They all looked young no older than ten. He wondered what he should say and if they would even understand him. </p><p>"Hello." the girl said, and Harry was relieved to find that he could understand her. "Are you injured?" </p><p>"No, I'm fine." He lied. He was hurt from his Uncle's "Going Away Beating" but he wasn't about to tell her that. "I was just relaxing." </p><p>"It is not wise to relax out here in the open." The girl said. "My brother has gone to fetch an adult, human. You are in a place that you are not meant to be but don't worry we are a kind people and will help you." </p><p>A man returned with a boy and Harry was captivated. He saw the name above the man's head. </p><p>
  <b>Legolas Greenleaf</b>
</p><p>This was Legolas? Harry blushed he looked just like he'd imagined he would look. </p><p>Harry somehow found himself following Legolas and the children into a very dead looking Rivendell. Harry felt a stab of pain in his heart as he looked around how had the valley gotten like this? He'd wanted to see it in all of its glory this was just horrible. So horrible he wanted to cry. He reached up and rubbed his eyes only to find that he wasn't wearing his glasses and could see perfectly. He liked that. </p><p>"Are you well?" Legolas wondered. </p><p>"Seeing this place like this makes me sad." Harry tried to explain. "I always heard that Rivendell was a grand and beautiful place full of magic and wonder. A true Elf paradise....but this......" </p><p>"Yes, it is very depressing." Legolas agreed. "The Darkness is strong and enveloping all the land as magic dies. Not even Rivendell has managed to resist the darkness. The shadow that has fallen here is strong." </p><p>"It breaks my heart." Harry sighed, following along behind Legolas. He blushed when Legolas looked back at him and smiled. "I'm sorry for intruding but I honestly have no idea how I got here. I was reading a book then I was suddenly at the spot where you found me. Oh, I'm Harry son James." </p><p>Harry had always wondered why people in the Lord of the Rings universe had always introduced themselves in that way but had never figured it out. He easily adjusted to the introduction. </p><p>"An odd name." Legolas hummed. "I am Legolas Greenleaf." </p><p>"Nice to meet you, Legolas." Harry said. </p><p>"and you, Harry." Legolas stopped them and kissed the back of Harry's hand making the children who were following them giggle. Harry blushed. "Come, Harry, we must go see Lord Elrond." </p><p>Harry looked at everything as he followed Legolas through Rivendell. He was soon standing in the thrown room looking at Elrond. He tried to remember the Lord of the Rings movie and how the elves had greeted each other with respect. He touched his fingers to his forehead and bowed. The elves in the throne room seemed impressed with his action.</p><p>"Greetings, Lord Elrond." Harry said, quietly into the silence. "I am Harry son of James and I am sorry for appearing in your land so suddenly but, I honestly have no idea how I got here. I was reading then I was where the children found me." </p><p>"Harry son of James." Elrond repeated. "That is an odd name." Harry was a little annoyed was he going to continue to hear that while he was here. Apparently his name was not common here as it was back in his own time. "Welcome to Rivendell, Harry son of James. Tell me where are you from?" </p><p>"Er......." Harry cursed himself. Now what? What was he going to say? He couldn't tell them the truth that he was from another world they wouldn't believe him but what could he say? "I......" he touched his head like it hurt. "I can't'........I'm sorry, Lord Elrond......" Harry said, trying his best to look confused. "I can't seem to remember......" He frowned hard in confusion and hurt. By the looks he was getting they were buying it. "I can't......remember........I'm sorry......" </p><p>
  <b>Lying-1</b>
</p><p>
  <b>Acting-1</b>
</p><p>Elrond frowned. He sensed no ill intent from the lad but could tell that he was hiding something. He could also sense the boy's confusion perhaps he really couldn't remember. He seemed to be struggling to remember. He surveyed the boy for a while before speaking again. </p><p>"Hmm.....that is rather disconcerting is it not?" Elrond spoke mostly to himself. "Well, we can't leave you out there on your own. Prepare a room for Harry." He ordered. </p><p>"Thank you, my Lord." Harry said, bowing. "You are very kind and gracious." </p><p>Harry was amazed by the room he was shown to. He looked around it in true wonder before he was drawn back to the world around him by giggling. He turned to see Legolas and an elven woman. </p><p>"You're cloth is rather odd." She told Harry as she moved into the room. "Is it from your Land?" </p><p>"Yes, I suppose it must be." Harry answered.</p><p>"I'm a clothier." she explained. "I like your cloth very much would you sell it to me?" </p><p>"You don't want these." Harry said, fidgeting with the hem of his shirt. "These are rags they aren't worth much if anything." </p><p>The woman wouldn't listen to him and insisted that he sell her the clothes she promised to make him a replacement outfit then left. </p><p>"This room is lovely." Harry breathed, as he looked around again. "Amazing. I don't think I've ever seen anything this grand. Do I really rate something this wonderful?" </p><p>"You are a very odd person, Harry." Legolas said, with a small smile. "Please rest. Someone will come to get you for dinner." </p><p>With that Legolas left and Harry stared at the blue screen floating in front of him.</p><p>
  <b>You have been given the Power of Gamer to help restore Middle-Earth to its once former glory. The Elves know of this Power and will be able to teach you how to use it if you tell them about it. </b>
</p><p>Harry's mind raced as he sat on the bed. </p><p>
  <b>Mission: I am Gamer! Tell Lord Elrond that you have the Power of Gamer and make him believe you. </b>
</p><p>Harry wondered how he was going to do that. Before he could read the rest of the screen he fell asleep.</p>
