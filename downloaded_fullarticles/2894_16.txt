    <p>Draco has of course been raised to appreciate power. So the moment Harry Potter, twenty-one years old and now the most powerful wizard of the age, walks into the underground club, he can’t help but notice.</p><p> </p><p>In truth, Draco has always noticed Harry. He just feels a little differently about it now. Now being when Harry’s gotten taller, broader in the shoulders, mop head hair its usual rat’s nest and signature round glasses firmly in place. He positively glows with power. It drips off him, thrums around him. He’s in sweeping robes of a green so dark it’s almost black. His eyes rake the club and its patrons with usual Auror precision; picking out exits, potential attackers, and suspect individuals alike.</p><p> </p><p>Draco sits back in his chair.</p><p> </p><p>The club is dark, smokey and exclusive. A regular haunt of his, it caters to only the most refined witches and wizards. There’s a slightly dangerous air about it, even as its patrons lounge in armchairs and over chaises, the aristocratic posture so gracefully lazy they mostly look bored.</p><p> </p><p>There’s a blues singer at the front. A pretty asian woman with a victory curl and a floor length silver gown. She had winked at Draco as she leant against the bar earlier. Pity he’s every bit as bent as Potter is.</p><p> </p><p>Harry, having spotted him, climbs the couple of steps raising Draco’s seating area from the rest of the club — a minor but important detail — and comes to stand in front of him without so much as an invitation. Draco’s lip curls. Though he wishes his fondness for Harry’s casual disregard of the way things are done here wasn’t quite so strong.</p><p> </p><p>“Malfoy,” Harry greets, nodding shortly.</p><p> </p><p>His tone’s not unfriendly, but it’s not quite friendly either. Carefully neutral is how Draco would describe it if he had to. He’s feeling Draco out.</p><p> </p><p>“Potter,” Draco returns, then gestures to a free seat. “Please, sit.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry looks a little surprised by the “please”, but Draco’s found that charm can be just as useful as scorn when applied right. And god does he want to apply it right for Potter.</p><p> </p><p>“Would you like a drink?” Draco asks, holding up a hand, wrist loose as though the bid to gain attention barely needs his effort.</p><p> </p><p>A waiter appears before he’s barely lifted a finger, his own hands clasped politely behind his back.</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, just a water would be fine,” Harry assures the man, who disappears again so smooth and quick it’s as though he disapparated, though there are wards up against that sort of thing in here.</p><p> </p><p>“So,” Draco starts, swirling his own brandy glass as he considers Harry, “to what do I owe the pleasure of our Saviour’s company?”</p><p> </p><p>Harry winces at the name, and Draco tries to feel guilty. But at this point his acerbic wit is his only defense against just how good Harry’s looking at the moment.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m in need of your… expertise,” Harry says delicately, and Draco feels a little proud that the man’s managed a small amount of the aristocratic way of dancing around the point. Harry usually gets straight to the point, not used to the pure-blood way of avoiding it.</p><p> </p><p>“Ah,” Draco says, feigning disinterest. “So the Ministry’s having trouble with a curse?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry goes to say more, but at that point the waiter returns with his water, presenting it to him on a little tray with a slight bow. Harry takes it with thanks, and places it on the table. He waits for the man’s swift departure before he continues.</p><p> </p><p>“There’s a house.”</p><p> </p><p>Draco raises an eyebrow.</p><p> </p><p>“Indeed?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes. It’s an old stately home in Bulgaria. It’s out in the middle of nowhere, so the Bulgarian Ministry didn’t bother with it for a while. But, ah, there’s a village nearby, and the curse seems to be… spreading.”</p><p> </p><p>Draco takes a sip of his brandy and places it on the armrest of his black leather chair.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, curses can do that,” he says, running a delicate finger around the rim of his glass.</p><p> </p><p>“And this one’s vicious,” Harry goes on. “Has already killed two of the townsfolk, and seeing as it’s a muggle settlement, there’s a risk to the statute of secrecy. It was used by some of Grindelwald's lot when he was in power, so it’s been festering for quite some time.”</p><p> </p><p>“I see,” Draco agrees thoughtfully. Then after a moment’s silence; “so what does this have to do with me?”</p><p> </p><p>Harry blinks at him for a moment, and Draco fights the urge to smile. Harry’s just as gormless as the eleven year old in too big robes. Not that he’s a simpleton by any means. But he’s got a certain innocence about him — despite all he’s been through — that Draco envies and despises in equal measure. Draco doesn’t think he was ever been allowed to be innocent. Not with his parents.</p><p> </p><p>“Well we’d need your help breaking the curse,” Harry says, as though this was obvious. Which of course it was, Draco just enjoys Harry asking for help too much to have said it himself.</p><p> </p><p>Harry, annoyingly, doesn’t seem too phased about having to ask. The git.</p><p> </p><p>“And I suppose you’re to accompany me to, what, keep an eye on me?”</p><p> </p><p>See, although Draco escaped a term in Azkaban — unlike his father, who served ten months before he got out and started doing serious damage control — the ministry does like to keep an eye on him. It’s alright when he’s quietly in the country, they mostly turn a blind eye to the fact some of his dealing are a little… shady. But when he feels like taking a trip abroad, suddenly they’re all interested. Heavens knows why. You’d think they’d be more concerned with the goings on inside their own borders.</p><p> </p><p>“That’s the idea, yes,” Harry says, with his usual bluntness.</p><p> </p><p>Draco rolls his eyes.</p><p> </p><p>“Well I suppose I don’t really have a choice in the matter,” Draco says blithely. “Not if the <em> Ministry </em> wants it.”</p><p> </p><p>He says the name of the institution with all his usual venom, but knows that Harry won’t be overly offended even if he does work for them. Potter’s always found the Ministry somewhat irksome. He just can’t resist being the hero enough to turn down a job as an Auror.</p><p> </p><p>“So you’ll come?” Harry double checks, not having touched his water. Probably wise.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, I’ll come.”</p><p> </p><p>Draco slips a card from his breast pocket and extends it to Harry between two fingers.</p><p> </p><p>“That’s the charm for floo calling me,” Draco explains as Harry takes it, brow a confused little mew that has no right being as adorable as it is. “Not just anyone can floo my house. You have to have the key, which this is. Just in case you want to call.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh,” Harry says, looking stunned. “Thanks, Malfoy.”</p><p> </p><p>He pockets the card, then takes out a scrap of paper to scribble down the details of their departure. He hands it to Draco, who looks it over with a raised brow.</p><p> </p><p>“So soon?” he drawls, referring to their leaving date in two days time. “I’ll barely have time to get my affairs in order.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry rolls his eyes as he stands, stuffing his hands in his robe pockets so the garment loses any credibility it had gained through its fine cut.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ll see you then, Malfoy,” he says, turning to go.</p><p> </p><p>“Good evening, Potter,” Draco returns, and watches Harry take his leave.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Two days later, despite his misgivings and slight annoyance at being assigned the case, Harry is staggering slightly as he and Draco arrive together on the front doorstep of the Draganov Manor. Draco’s a little more unsteady and falls against him, Harry dropping his bags to catch him.</p><p> </p><p>Draco shrugs him off, looking annoyed, and gazes up at the grand front doors they’ve arrived before. Harry looks up too.</p><p> </p><p>The doors, and what he can see of the manor, close enough to only see so much, are imposing. It has a sort of weight about it, much like the Malfoy Manor had, the one time Harry had been there.</p><p> </p><p>But the Draganov Manor feels somehow more… toxic. The dark magic is evident, even if it’s not actively attacking them, seeming to seep from the house like a weeping wound.</p><p> </p><p>The landscape is cold and barren at this time of year, it being October and the first snowfall of the year two months away, and the manor situated quite high up in the Bulgarian mountains. But Harry can see how it may be beautiful when it’s flushed green with summer or coated white with winter.</p><p> </p><p>Draco steps forward to open the door and Harry gets out his wand.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t be silly, Potter, you won’t be needing that,” Draco snaps in his usual waspish manner, waving a hand at his bags so they spring up into the air to float alongside him.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s leaking dark magic, Malfoy,” Harry points out. “What’s to say it won’t have a stab at whoever dares set foot inside?”</p><p> </p><p>Draco rolls his eyes for what must be the upteenth time since they met up this morning, and briefly takes out his own wand to tap the door handle, which admits them at the key charm Draco mutters.</p><p> </p><p>The door swings open.</p><p> </p><p>The foyer is dark beyond the door, a slight smell of must and disuse emanating out to where they’re standing. Harry charms up his own bags, but does not stow his wand as he follows Draco inside.</p><p> </p><p>The door swings shut behind them of its own accord, and Harry only just manages to stop himself from jumping.</p><p> </p><p>“Old houses,” Draco says fondly, snapping his fingers so his bags vanish, no doubt sent to the upper floors. “They’re practically sentient.”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s not creepy at all,” Harry huffs, sending his own bags away with a click of his own.</p><p> </p><p>“Not really,” Draco says with an elegant shrug. “Helpful in fact, if there’s no house elves about to light the lamps et cetera.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry tells himself that Hogwarts was in fact a very old building, which had felt <em> very </em> sentient at times, and he didn’t find it creepy. But the Draganov Manor is different. The place itches with something poisonous, and Harry tries not to let it show how it bothers him as they go to explore.</p><p> </p><p>Draco claims the largest bedroom, which suits Harry just fine as he finds that room creepy, what with all the snake motifs. He himself chooses a room a few doors down, so they’re not on top of each other, but close enough to be easily accessed if the other is at all troubled by the house.</p><p> </p><p>Harry’s room is grand, but a little cosier than Draco’s. It’s walls are a deep burgundy, a chandelier illuminating a stately four poster bed, a writing desk, a chaise, a large wardrobe, and a fireplace.</p><p> </p><p>It’s nice compared to the rest of the house, though still a little gloomy for Harry’s tastes. It reminds him quite a bit of Grimmauld Place, which he still owns but never uses, having bought himself a flat in London, which isn’t huge, but manages not to be small either. A perfect cosy little balance.</p><p> </p><p>Draco comes down for dinner in the most informal dress Harry’s seen him in thus far, and it’s still uptight, nothing like the knitted jumper and jeans Harry’s in. Draco’s crisp white shirt is perfectly tailored, tucked into a pair of slim fit black jeans which highlight the length of his slender legs. His long hair is lose, no parting visible exactly, more just pushed over to one side carelessly in a way that softens him, reveals one side of his sharp jaw, his high, angular cheekbones, his smooth, unblemished skin.</p><p> </p><p>Harry has to admit that he’s never found Draco anything less than stunningly beautiful, even when he was being a giant twat back at Hogwarts. But there’s something about him now, his maturity, the release of his usual rudeness, that makes him very attractive indeed. That’s not to say he’s <em> polite, </em> god no. Harry suspects Draco would rather die than be seen as anything other than icy, and that extends to his manners. But he actually says please and thank you now, and every now and then, if Harry tries really hard, he can get him to make something that’s almost a smile as they eat together.</p><p> </p><p>Harry’s cooked, the house having no elves to do it for them, and Harry being somewhat idle as Draco had started his inspection of the curse upon the manor. Draco considers the homely food — a chicken and mushroom pie — down his long nose, looking mildly displeased, but apparently having changed enough not to remark aloud what a far cry Harry’s cooking is from his usual diet. And when Draco actually takes a bite he looks a little surprised, which Harry interprets as unforeseen enjoyment.</p><p> </p><p>As the evening wears on and they drink more and more of the wine Draco selected from the very impressive wine cellar, it becomes less hard work for Harry to get Draco to give him that almost smile. His face seems to fight it at first, like it’s not used to the expression, but then his mouth softens, and yes, there’s the tilt at the corners.</p><p> </p><p>See Harry’s actually quite funny. Ron has always been the funniest of their trio, but Harry’s always had a somewhat sharp humour, dry and a little cutting, that Draco seems to appreciate. It’s not too far off Draco’s own acerbic humour after all, which is sharp enough to cut if he wants it to. But he stows his knife of a tongue for the evening, his remarks just cruel enough to make Harry laugh, but gentle enough that they don't tip over into rudeness.</p><p> </p><p>And isn’t this something? The easy company, how they seem to bounce off each other, the conversation easy but keeping them on their toes enough to be interesting.</p><p> </p><p>They finish the evening being, if not friends, then maybe acquaintances. Something they couldn’t even call themselves before now.</p><p> </p><p>Harry climbs into bed with a smile on his face, thinking of the slightly crooked tilt of Draco’s mouth as he smiled.</p><p> </p><p>Harry should’ve known then, that he never stood a chance.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>At first, Harry stays out of Draco’s way, busying himself with making the house livable, though Draco suspects it’ll never be welcoming to someone like him, so unused to such places. Harry so obviously doesn’t belong it’s laughable. His casual muggle clothes, untidy hair and general carefree nature don’t belong in a pure-blood manor. To Draco, the Draganov Manor is practically a mirror image of his ancestral home, which he has fond memories of from his mother at least, if not his father.</p><p> </p><p>Once the house seems to somewhat take over the work on its own, sensing perhaps that they’re here to stay and maybe wanting to help them do so — which isn’t ominous at all — there’s not much for Harry to do.</p><p> </p><p>It’s at this point that he takes an interest in Draco’s work, seeming to genuinely enjoy watching him at it. And then he’s constantly underfoot.</p><p> </p><p>“Potter,” Draco snaps, only just managing to reign in the venom that he would’ve unleashed back when they were teenagers.</p><p> </p><p>Harry steps quickly back from where he’s been hovering at Draco’s elbow as Draco draws counter curses and charms in the air.</p><p> </p><p>“Sorry,” Harry says, sounding genuinely apologetic and looking a little sheepish. Merlin, does the man have to be so downright desirable at all times?</p><p> </p><p>Draco feels his annoyance leak away, and sighs.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s alright,” he says, his voice softer than he ever would’ve used years back. “Just… give me some space to work.”</p><p> </p><p>“Of course.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry hurries to sit over on the sofa, back straight and folding his hands in his lap like a scolded little boy. Draco fights to suppress a smile.</p><p> </p><p>Harry watches him work in silence, until he can’t help but ask a question, the query bursting out of him after ten minutes. Draco doesn’t mind. Harry seems so genuinely interested that it’s flattering more than annoying.</p><p> </p><p>As their second week comes to an end, they form a somewhat unlikely camaraderie between them. It’s not as though they’re completely incompatible after all, and Draco has to admit it was probably largely his fault that they weren’t friends in school. Though Harry’s not completely without blame. The twerp.</p><p> </p><p>They toast the beginning of the third week over another of Harry’s dinners, which, Draco has to admit, although a little rustic, isn’t half bad.</p><p> </p><p>As they open another bottle and retire to the games room, Draco’s feeling pleasantly buzzed. Not tipsy or anything, just relaxed enough that he doesn’t try to stop his eyes from drinking in the sight of Harry’s pert backside as he goes ahead of him to take their usual after dinner seats by the fire.</p><p> </p><p>The conversation’s easy as ever, light but with interesting little dips in it. And as it wears on Draco finds his gaze wandering, admiring Harry’s long legs, more muscular than his own, thicker in the thigh and calf, sprawled in front of Harry as he sits slid down in his armchair. His knitted sweater has ridden up slightly to expose a strip of golden skin, and Draco lets himself look with the few glasses of wine muddling his judgement.</p><p> </p><p>When Draco finally manages to drag his eyes away from Harry’s admittedly very nice body to look at his face, he finds Harry’s watching him oggle him with a smirk. Draco can’t muster up the energy to be embarrassed. Not after the food and the wine and a full two weeks of being around the very attractive, very powerful and admittedly very good company that is the Boy Wonder.</p><p> </p><p>Draco wonders if he’d be feeling a little drunk even without the wine, just high on Harry’s presence.</p><p> </p><p>The moment passes however, and as they chat he revels in his ability to make Harry laugh. It’s a good laugh. Full and unrestrained, coming deep from Harry’s body and rising up in him to light his face up and throw his head back.</p><p> </p><p>“...then he pointed his wand at me,” Draco’s saying, “and says ‘stop or I’ll jinx your balls off, fucking faggot!’”</p><p> </p><p>Harry snorts, perhaps having experienced similar slurs as a famously queer wizard. Draco’s not actively out himself beyond his casual shags, but some people just seem to guess anyway.</p><p> </p><p>“And I say, ‘you seem to have a rather intense interest in my balls if you’re so against shagging men’.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry laughs that wonderful laugh of his and Draco grins before he continues.</p><p> </p><p>“And then I jumped.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry’s eyes go wide.</p><p> </p><p>“What, right over the edge of the dam?!”</p><p> </p><p>“Indeed,” Draco confirms, swirling his wine and holding it up to the firelight to consider the legs.</p><p> </p><p>“But it was a fifty foot drop!” Harry exclaims, looking satisfyingly awed. “Did you cast a cushioning charm?”</p><p> </p><p>“No,” Draco says, letting the statement rest for a beat before he says, “I summoned my broom. It caught me thirty foot down and I was able to avoid turning into pure-blood scrambled eggs.”</p><p> </p><p>“Impressive,” Harry allows, and Draco resists the urge to preen. It’s high praise from the man whose power he can practically taste.</p><p> </p><p>“Nothing to what you could do without raising a finger, I’m sure,” Draco returns, raising a perfect brow at Harry.</p><p> </p><p>Harry frowns and shakes his head.</p><p> </p><p>“I’d have to do a little more than raise a finger,” he says.</p><p> </p><p>“Hmm, not what I heard.”</p><p> </p><p>Draco stands. Harry looks up at him as he sweeps forward and comes to a halt in front of him. And isn’t it funny, how the most powerful wizard of the age is sitting there in a pair of ratty jeans and a hand knitted jumper no doubt courtesy of Molly Weasley?</p><p> </p><p>Harry’s skin is golden brown in the firelight, his mixed race painting him several shades darker than Draco, who’s so pale he’s practically transparent. They’re silver and gold, fresh snow and sunlight. The unusual combination of tanned skin and freckles is intoxicating, bright green eyes gazing up at Draco in question. Draco’s never seen eyes quite as green as Harry’s. Usually they’re more muddy, but Harry’s are a vibrant hue.</p><p> </p><p>“What would if feel like, I wonder,” Draco says, voice soft, like this is something intimate, and he sees how Harry’s eyes go a little wide with it, “if you let me feel it?”</p><p> </p><p>Harry swallows, his throat clicking audibly.</p><p> </p><p>“Feel it?” Harry asks, voice equally soft as he gazes up at Draco half curious, half something… else.</p><p> </p><p>“Your power,” Draco explains, and Harry’s eyes go fearful. “Would it tear me apart?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes.”</p><p> </p><p>The word is so final and sure that Draco shivers with it, arousal unspooling in his gut like a rope untied. His eyes slip closed momentarily, and when he opens them, he sees Harry’s own eyes have gone dark as they watch him. Draco smirks.</p><p> </p><p>“Interesting,” he says. “Goodnight, Potter.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry looks surprised by the abrupt dismissal, but Draco’s already turning to go.</p><p> </p><p>“Wait —“ Harry starts, half risen from his chair.</p><p> </p><p>Draco pauses.</p><p> </p><p>“I — nothing,” Harry sighs after a moment, collapsing back into the armchair.</p><p> </p><p>Draco allows himself a private smile once he’s properly turned away, and leaves.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>The house is being very reasonable. Which is unsettling. It’s been a month and there’s still been no threat against their lives. It’s like it’s lulling them into a false sense of security, crouched ready to pounce. Harry doesn’t like it, and from the little furrow of Draco’s brow as he studies the wards, he doesn’t either.</p><p> </p><p>“What do you think it’s waiting for?” Harry asks him, sprawled on the floor of the drawing room as Draco stands in the center of the room, looking up at the ceiling with his hands on his narrow hips.</p><p> </p><p>There’s frost on the mountains outside and creeping over the windows, and they have a fire roaring in the hearth. It’s very cosy.</p><p> </p><p>Harry saw the beginnings of Christmas lights in the village on one of his outings, which Draco sometimes accompanies him on, and decided they had to have a tree of their own. It stands in the corner now, a huge thing, sparkling with lights and pretty glass baubles Draco had taken a shine to.</p><p> </p><p>“For us to relax fully,” Draco replies. “Let our guard down so it can strike with the most damage… though maybe it’s just lonely. Sometimes houses can get tired of being empty if they’re very old. They get somewhat… wise. It may not want to do anything to us. Or get confused trying to make us stay and end up hurting us instead. Sometimes curses can be like that.”</p><p> </p><p>“You sound almost like you’re talking about an innocent child,” Harry says, considering the thoughtful lines of Draco’s face as they shift to surprise, registering what Harry said. “Like it doesn’t know any better. But this is dark magic, it was made to do damage.”</p><p> </p><p>“Perhaps,” Draco agrees, but Harry can tell he’s not convinced.</p><p> </p><p>Then he crumples gracefully to the floor with a sigh, sprawling out just like Harry’s doing. Harry’s never seen him look so casual. Draco’s always so poised.</p><p> </p><p>“What’re you doing?” Harry asks, leaning up on his elbows to look at Draco where he’s spread out on the rug. His hair is a pale pool of white blonde around his head.</p><p> </p><p>“Might as well observe from down here,” Draco replies. “You looked comfortable enough.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry considers him for a moment, then rolls over onto all fours and crawls over to him. He flops down above Draco so their heads are side by side, feet away from each other. He sees Draco’s head roll to look at him out of the corner of his eye upside down, but keeps his eyes on the ceiling.</p><p> </p><p>“Well hello,” Draco drawls, amusement tickling his voice.</p><p> </p><p>Harry grins, and rolls his own head to face him.</p><p> </p><p>“Thought I’d help,” he lies, knowing he doesn’t have the skill to spot the curse lines the way Draco does. He can feel the dark magic, get snatches of it, but Draco’s the one with the trained eye.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh yeah?” Draco says, corner of his mouth ticking up in a way that tells Harry he sees through the lie easily.</p><p> </p><p>“Mhmm.”</p><p> </p><p>Draco’s almost grinning, but his face is doing the thing where it fights it, and he turns back to look at the ceiling.</p><p> </p><p>“What do you see?” Harry asks softly, moments after Draco starts waving a hand above him, stirring up the curse lines with wandless magic.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s certainly tainted… but it doesn’t feel bad. I don’t know if that’s another attempt to make me relax my guard though. It does feel lonely though. Not that that’s a good thing. Could try and kill us so we have to stay forever as ghosts or something.”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s a cheery thought.”</p><p> </p><p>“Just telling it like it is.”</p><p> </p><p>They lapse back into silence, Draco’s hand still drawing shapes above them. It’s kind of wonderful watching him work.</p><p> </p><p>Harry’s head lulls back to look at Draco’s profile, the thin lips, delicate nose, sharp cheekbones. He knows Draco feels him looking. After a moment, Draco turns his head too.</p><p> </p><p>And Harry lets Draco see the desire in his eyes, the way Harry drinks in the sight of him.</p><p> </p><p>Draco swallows.</p><p> </p><p>“What?” he asks, voice gentle and with just a hint of something almost like nervousness. Not that Draco would ever admit to being nervous about anything.</p><p> </p><p>“Just… you,” Harry says, the confession soft, finally hanging between them, incomplete but weighty with meaning.</p><p> </p><p>“Me?”</p><p> </p><p>Draco’s voice is uncertain, none of his usual confidence present, though he seems to try valiantly for it.</p><p> </p><p>“Mmm… you,” Harry agrees.</p><p> </p><p>Then he rolls to the side, so their bodies are at right angles to each other, Harry on his front, propped up on his elbows over Draco, their faces close.</p><p> </p><p>Draco looks surprised and slightly apprehensive, but also like he doesn’t want Harry to stop. His breathing is short, pale cheeks a little flushed. Harry leans in, lets his lips hover over Draco’s for a moment before the plunge.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “MMMMMMNNNNNNNNNUUUUUUUUUAAAAAAAAAAAAA!” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>The screaming, agonised moan sounds like it’s being ripped out of some ancient, otherworldly beast buried in the centre of the universe and clawing its way out.</p><p> </p><p>Harry and Draco leap apart, Harry scrambling to his feet, already reaching for his power.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>The house sounds like it’s dying, and Draco, whose eyes had just started to slip close in anticipation for the kiss that never comes, jumps and scrambles into a sitting position.</p><p> </p><p>Harry’s already up, and his power slams out from him although his wand is not even in his hand. He’s positioned himself between Draco and the door, body tensed like a spring, stance protective as though he can shield Draco with his body. Which he probably can, no matter how bad the curse is. This man is strong. Draco feels it as his power crashes against the walls, batters the door to keep it closed and keep them safe. It’s a shield charm, the strongest Draco’s ever felt, encompassing the whole room.</p><p> </p><p>Then Draco feels something else. The shield is coalescing around <em> him </em>specifically, strongest around Draco’s body, like it’s the most important thing for Harry to protect.</p><p> </p><p>And Draco feels one last thing, though this one’s entirely inside him. It blooms up in his chest, like flowers is spring, a flood bursting a carefully built dam, a bird soaring free from a cage.</p><p> </p><p>He infatuated with this man. Christ he's obsessed and they’ve only been here a bloody month. That’s far too fast to fall like this. They’ve not even kissed yet. Circe, no, Draco can't feel like this. Infatuation. Heady lust for one so obviously thrumming with power. But not actually <em> love. </em> It can’t be. Malfoys are never so impulsive. That’s a Gryffindor trait, not a Slytherin one.</p><p> </p><p>No. It's Harry's power he likes. It must be. And an appreciation of good looks. That’s all this is. Draco won’t lie and say that it couldn’t be more given time. But he won’t let himself think it’s... it's so deep at this stage. He refuses to.</p><p> </p><p>“Harry,” he croaks, voice hoarse with how he feels.</p><p> </p><p>And he watches Harry turn his upper body towards him slightly to look over his shoulder, still poised towards the door as though to face down whatever threat is lurking on the other side. His stance is protective, the line of his shoulders, the clench of his stomach. And Draco sees surprise in Harry’s eyes, and realises it’s the first time he’s called Harry by his given name. It’s the most important insignificant detail.</p><p> </p><p>“Harry,” he says again, because he can and he thinks it might help Harry reign in that wild look in his eyes, like he’s about to lose his grasp on that almighty power of his. “It’s just the house, Harry, reacting to my curse breaking charms. It doesn’t like them, but I don’t think it’s a threat.”</p><p> </p><p>“You don’t <em> think?” </em> Harry says, disbelief in his tone. “Draco, I can’t let my guard down for <em> think. </em> You’ve got to <em> know.” </em></p><p> </p><p>It’s a fair point. The house has killed people after all.</p><p> </p><p>Draco nods, trying to push back down the warmth that wants to blossom again at the sound of his own given name in Harry’s mouth. So perfect. It fits just right and rolls off his tongue so smooth. Like their mouths were made for saying each other’s names… maybe doing other things together too. He gets slowly to his feet.</p><p> </p><p>“Come on,” Draco says, reaching out and placing a soothing hand on Harry’s arm. It’s the right choice. Harry stares down at the hand, so starkly white against his own skin, looking surprised, but seems grounded by the touch. “I won’t be able to know for sure unless you drop the barrier. There’s no way for me to tell what the threat level is when literally not even a hint can get through.”</p><p> </p><p>“A hint can sometimes be all it takes,” Harry growls, and Draco tries valiantly not to love the danger in his voice, not to bite his lip with it.</p><p> </p><p>“Just… you have to trust me with this, Harry.”</p><p> </p><p>And that makes Harry look up, find Draco’s gaze and meet it with his own. Draco knows he’s asking for a lot. Trust? With all they’ve done to each other? But things are different now, with this thing growing between them, and it doesn’t seem impossible. Stranger things have happened.</p><p> </p><p>Harry searches Draco’s eyes, looking for any hint of fear or doubt. He must find reassurance or something, because a moment later he nods, and the protective shield around Draco and the room drops away.</p><p> </p><p>Nothing happens when the shield drops, and Draco uses his wand because this is going to take proper concentration and an extra fine touch. He doesn’t want to botch this and have Harry go nuclear.</p><p> </p><p>There is something there. Draco frowns, feeling along the wriggly, sinuous thing he detects. But it doesn’t seem malevolent. Draco tries to reason that he knows curses well, and he doesn’t think this is the house fooling him into believing its safe this time. He has a taste for it, like a fine wine connoisseur but with dark magic.</p><p> </p><p>Draco walks across the room to the wall where he feels the thing most keenly, Harry close at his elbow. The hall is on the other side of the wall, the door just beside it. Draco lays a hand against it, feels whatever it is twitch in response to his touch.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> There. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Got it,” Draco says, smirking, pleased with himself. “We won’t be needing another shield.”</p><p> </p><p>“You sure?” Harry asks. Draco throws him a look.</p><p> </p><p>It’s a testament to the fact that he must trust Draco after all, because Harry doesn’t throw up another shield.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s adjusting,” Draco explains. “Reacting to our presence, and my start at trying to fix it. It’s not really damaged in any way, that’ll take far longer. It’s just stretching itself, molding itself anew to try and counter my attack.”</p><p> </p><p>“So it knows you’re attacking it?” Harry asks, sounding not at all pleased by this.</p><p> </p><p>“Hm not exactly,” Draco replies, looking back to the deep green satin of the wall. “It’s not actually <em> truly </em> sentient. At least not in any way we’d understand. So to say it understands things like attacks wouldn’t be right. It’s more… used to adjusting. I think it sort of sees it like a game. Or a new curiosity. It wants to feel us out. Maybe let us in a bit. Might help actually. By the time it realises our intention it may be too late for it.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry’s silent, and Draco turns back to him to see him frowning at the wall.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t like it,” he states, sounding somewhat childish.</p><p> </p><p>Draco rolls his eyes.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, well, that’s the point of a curse. You’re not supposed to enjoy it.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry’s eyes flick to his.</p><p> </p><p>“I —”</p><p> </p><p>He cuts himself off, looking uncertain and then frowning.</p><p> </p><p>“What?” Draco pushes, curious as to the little battle he sees raging in Harry’s mind.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t like it near you,” he says, sounding grumpy. “I think it likes you too much and I… I’d rather not lose you to it.”</p><p> </p><p>It’s the most honest thing he’s said, along with his earlier confession of <em> “Just… you.” </em></p><p> </p><p>Draco feels his cheeks heat a little, and knows his pale skin makes the blush stand out over the bridge of his nose and high on his cheekbones. Damn his complexion. Completely ruins his reputation for being icy and indifferent.</p><p> </p><p>Harry of course, looks delighted. He grins that most endearing lopsided smile as he watches the heat bloom in Draco’s cheeks, drinking in the sight of it.</p><p> </p><p>Then Harry’s grabbing him, hauling him in, and <em>kissing the life out of him.</em></p><p> </p><p>And holy Circe that old cliche of fireworks and stars and a hundred angels singing is really not even close to doing this justice, but it’s all Draco can think of as Harry’s mouth moves over his. Hot and slick and just a little filthy.</p><p> </p><p>Harry kisses like he does everything in life; full of passion and heedless of the consequence, diving in head first and just hoping he doesn’t shatter into a million pieces at the bottom.</p><p> </p><p>Oh but Draco feels like he’s shattering. He flew apart the moment they touched lips and then reformed around their point of contact, like a star imploding in on itself.</p><p> </p><p>He feels alive and so very good, a hundred percent certain of himself and comfortable in his own skin for perhaps the first time in his life.</p><p> </p><p>Draco kisses him back of course. Giving into it with a groan, his hands coming up to tangle in that rat’s nest hair, knocking Harry’s glasses askew, mouth parting open on a gasp so Harry’s tongue can slide against his. Harry pulls him flush and Draco lets him, presses himself close, his hips pushed forward so that they’re panting, aware of each other starting to get hard through their clothes.</p><p> </p><p>They break apart after several long moments, breathless and gasping, cheeks flushed and dazed.</p><p> </p><p>Draco is very pleased by the mess he’s reduced Harry to. His glasses are wonky, his hair’s even more of a mess than usual, and his eyes are hazy with desire. He looks wrecked and wanton, like Draco’s unleashed some sort of beast that’s been chained. And it needs blood. Draco shivers with it.</p><p> </p><p>From the look on Harry’s face, he too likes whatever Draco looks like, so Draco knows he can’t be faring much better.</p><p> </p><p>“Do you want to…?” Harry starts, but Draco shakes his head.</p><p> </p><p>“Just this for now,” he says, because though he can admit he’s mad for bloody Harry Potter of all people, he also wants to savour it a little. He’s not a Slytherin for nothing, and good things come to those who wait.</p><p> </p><p>Harry looks torn, biting his lip in a most distracting way, but he nods.</p><p> </p><p>“Just this,” he agrees easily.</p><p> </p><p>So they kiss again.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Draco is, predictably, annoyingly good at kissing. He does it with such passion, but also with a healthy dose of skill, losing himself but not enough so he’s heedless of the other person’s pleasure. He seems to enjoy turning Harry’s brain to mush, and takes the opportunity to do it often for the rest of the day after the first time.</p><p> </p><p>He seats himself on Harry’s lap when they retire to their usual post-dinner armchairs in the games room, sitting there like Harry’s his personal throne. Harry grins at him like a loon.</p><p> </p><p>“You look pleased with yourself,” Draco says, his tone haughty but a twinkle in his eye and a lift to his lips.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh I am,” Harry replies smoothly, running his hands greedily up Draco’s slender thighs. “See I can reduce the great Draco Malfoy, a pure-blood of the famous twenty-eight, to a panting, flushed mess, who makes the prettiest noises because of my mouth.”</p><p> </p><p>“Shut up,” Draco says, with no bite and a smile tucked in there as he gives Harry’s shoulder a shove.</p><p> </p><p>Harry has never wanted anything this badly in his life.</p><p> </p><p>They chat and make out. Harry even gets around to telling him that he was almost sorted into Slytherin, something he doesn’t share with just anyone.</p><p> </p><p>Draco laughs so hard he nearly falls off Harry lap, who catches him. Then he sobers, his smile slipping as his gaze goes far off. Then his cheeks pink just a little.</p><p> </p><p>“What?” Harry asks, unable to help his grin at the sight of the slight blush. Draco never fully goes red, just gets this pretty light dusting across his nose and cheeks. It’s wonderful and Harry has to resist the urge to press his lips to it, see if it feels as warm as it looks.</p><p> </p><p>“Just… you in Slytherin robes,” Draco explains, then quickly shuts himself up, looking just a tad flustered. It’s not a look Harry thought he’d ever get to see on the ever so composed Draco Malfoy.</p><p> </p><p>“Mm, do you like the idea?” Harry says, voice low with intent, giving Draco’s hip a squeeze.</p><p> </p><p>Draco huffs and glares at him, but Harry can’t help himself. He leans in, still grinning.</p><p> </p><p>“Maybe I’d have been in your dorm,” Harry murmurs in Draco’s ear. “Sometimes I have bad dreams, and maybe I’d need a little comfort in the night… slip into your bed… hot and needy… want to put my hands on you…”</p><p> </p><p>“Merlin, Potter, cut it out.”</p><p> </p><p>The returned hiss of his surname tells Harry Draco’s in danger of being actually annoyed, so he laughs and backs off, not wanting to tease enough for Draco to turn on him.</p><p> </p><p>They don’t say a word about their sleeping arrangements, but Draco comes and crawls into Harry’s bed that night as though it’s the most normal thing in the world. Which is both absurd and completely expected. Much like them.</p><p> </p><p>They whisper to each other for a while, though there’s really no reason to keep their voices down, other than it being nice. The only light is that from the fireplace and the only sound their low voices and the howl of the wind outside, the house creaking occasionally.</p><p> </p><p>“Goodnight, Draco,” Harry says when he feels the other man start to pool into him where he’s splayed across his chest.</p><p> </p><p>“Mmnnn… night,” Draco replies sleepily, and moments later he’s breathing deeply.</p><p> </p><p>Harry smiles, and soon after he slips off too.</p>
