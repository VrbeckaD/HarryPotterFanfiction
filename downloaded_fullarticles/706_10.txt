    <p>Snowflakes were drifting down in the yellow pool of light cast by the lamp at the entry. She could just see it from her current vantage, face pressed against the windowpane and going a little numb from the pressure or the cold. She supposed there was probably something she should be doing. Clothes to pick up, or sheets to straighten, or a tray to collect. It wasn’t fair to leave it all to Harry. Or Kreacher. Except it was <em>Kreacher</em>. And Harry. So maybe leaving it just one time was alright. One more time.<br/><br/>Because it wasn’t like this had been <em>her </em>idea.<br/><br/>The water in the en suite had stopped running a while ago. She prised her face off the window, straightened her shoulders, and wished she’d checked her watch. Five minutes was enough time to towel off and put on a robe. Ten was bordering on suspicious – either she’d walk in on another suicide attempt, or he’d be sitting on the toilet. <br/><br/>Or shaving?<br/><br/>This involved a razor blade rather close to jugular veins and carotid arteries, but it also implied some level of self-care, a slight regression of apathy. The state of his room, and the state she’d found him in upon arrival combined to suggest this was only temporary good behaviour. Still, as Harry hopefully — continuously — pointed out, the fact he was willing to try a little implied they were at least getting through to him. She pasted a firm smile on her face, and very carefully did not think about the many months they had been chanting this very refrain.<br/><br/>He made a weak effort to return her smile in the glass, and wiped the last of the foam from ‘round his ears. <br/><br/>“Fit for decent company now?” If she smiled any harder, her face was going to crack.<br/><br/>“I guess.”<br/><br/>“I mean, not that we’re necessarily decent company, but…” She trailed off, unable to think of how to end this; she wasn’t the one who was supposed to have made the joke in the first place. He should have issued this rejoinder, and then it would have been her part to return a riposte. Fencing against herself was far beyond any level of athleticism she’d ever aspired to, aside from being wholly outside of what she’d agreed to when Harry had slumped into her office this afternoon, begging her to come over to poke and cajole, to harass and persuade.<br/><br/><em>Ron’s a bit fragile lately</em>, she reminded herself, as she followed his slouching form down the hall stairs and into the Grimmauld Place library. <br/><br/>“Ron! You’re tall, come help me stick this branch back!” Ginny’s effusion was rather like her own, Hermione suspected: false, forced, facile.<br/><br/>The tree was starting to look nice, though, and could only further improve with Ron safely occupied in holding branches as Ginny applied strategic Sticking Charms. Hermione hovered (she was good at hovering) in their vicinity long enough to defuse any perceptive theories that she was desperate to duck and run. The third time she ‘helpfully’ pointed out a gap in the greenery, Ginny smiled tightly and suggested she check up on Harry in the kitchen.<br/><br/><em>Good-oh</em>, it was all the permission she needed.<br/><br/>Harry studiously ignored her, until she hooked her foot around one of the kitchen stools and dragged it across the tiling —<em>bumpity-scrape-bump— </em>whereupon he looked up from the eggnog he was assembling. “Yeah, hello. I take it he didn’t drown himself in the shower, then.”<br/><br/>“Not this time, at any rate. We can’t keep doing this.”<br/><br/>“Ron’s a little fragile just now. You know that.”<br/><br/>“We all know that. We’ve all known that for ages. Sometimes I think it’s all we do know, anymore. But Harry! Even George has picked himself up, and Mr. Weasley said… Well, it’s beside the point,” she hastened to switch gears in the face of his increasingly dark expression, “The point is, this is hard on all of us. What if we’re just enabling this, what if we’re doing more harm than good?” <em>What if we have other things we’d rather be doing, than cosseting poor fragile Ron, who’s so damaged all he can bring himself to do is lie in bed listening to the wireless and ‘reading’ filthy magazines, day in, day out? </em><br/><br/>“Look, I don’t know, Hermione. But he’s up out of bed tonight, and we’re going to trim the tree, and it’s just the four of us, right? So let’s just try being happy, and try to forget everything else, okay? Just for tonight?”<br/><br/>“I have plans. I told you that this afternoon.”<br/><br/>“But—”<br/><br/>“Harry, don’t. I told you I couldn’t stay. And I think it was a bit mean to use me to get him out of his room, when you <em>knew</em> I wasn’t staying.”<br/><br/>“He listens to you. You know he cares about you.”<br/><br/>“Please, Harry, you have to stop encouraging this. I’m not his girlfriend, and this. isn’t. my. job. Even if I <em>was</em>, it wouldn’t be my job. And I hope you have some eggnog that hasn’t been spiked, because alcohol is a depressant and we surely don’t need any more of that around here.”<br/><br/>“I’ve got Butterbeer, too. D’you want to bring the biscuits through, I don’t think I can carry everything at once.”<br/><br/>“Aren’t you a wizard? And I said: I’m not staying. In fact, I’m off for home right now, before you coerce me into any more misdeeds.”<br/><br/>“Hah! Caught you out, you admit it!”<br/><br/>“Admit what? I haven’t admitted anything.”<br/><br/>“You just said you’re off for home; that’s hardly “plans”. And reading a book doesn’t count. Come decorate with us, it’ll be fun,” he wheedled.<br/><br/>It would not be fun. It would be painful and awkward and she’d have to endure Ron’s increasingly friendly hands, because <em>Ron’s A Bit Fragile</em>, and apparently a bloke could expect to get away with nearly anything if he were A Bit Fragile. She sighed. “A friend is cooking dinner for me, and I need to change, and I’m already running late.”<br/><br/>“A friend.”<br/><br/>“Yes. I have those.”<br/><br/>“Yeah. Right here. And you’re leaving.”<br/><br/>“Goodnight, Harry.” She pulled her coat and gloves on, and hurried into the falling snow before he could expand on whatever line of thought was giving his face that mulish expression. “Have fun tonight; see you at the Ministry party on Thursday!”<br/><br/>It was fitting, somehow, that her Apparition missed her back step in favour of an icy puddle. She’d been having that kind of day. She clicked the deadbolt in place behind her, and sagged against the door for a heavy moment. Deep breaths. Things could only improve from here.<br/><br/>She relieved herself of her wet socks and even hung her coat in the closet, instead of throwing it haphazardly in the direction of the overloaded coat tree. It only took an extra moment.<br/><br/>And yet every extra moment was one she lost. <br/><br/>Moments mattered. She didn’t have many. Or at least, she didn’t have <em>enough</em>. <br/><br/>She bit hard at her lower lip, and made a valiant effort to school herself against the bubbling resentment: at Harry, at Ron, at the Ministry, at everyone who’d impinged upon this little slice of time she’d carved out away from them and their constant demands.<br/><br/>Deep breaths. <br/><br/>She strode resolutely into the kitchen and set about with mechanical precision. Glass of water. New phial of George’s potion, retrieved from the depths of her briefcase. Pasteur dropper. And the flask, its shimmering cut glass facets reflecting the light from the hall, little swirls of silver that blossomed out into the blue glass, emanating from wherever her fingers strayed across it. She tipped in the new phial of potion, and gave the flask a practised swirl so that the viscous liquid coated every surface. Maybe that bit was just superstition. Like the way she dripped four millilitres of the potion into the waiting water glass in precise quadrants. Cleaning her pipette in the glass wasn’t, on the other hand. It was just frugal, ensuring she didn’t waste the slightest bit of it. <br/><br/>She made herself put everything away into its proper cabinet, before she took her first swallow. This was not superstition, she didn’t think, so much as ritual.<br/><br/>“And we are hiding in the dark precisely why?” he drawled, from the rectangle of lit hallway that cast his spare form into silhouette.<br/><br/>“Rough day.”<br/><br/>“They’re all rough days.”<br/><br/>“Yeah.” She set the last half of the glass aside; she’d take it up to the bedroom later, to have on hand for the morning. “This one was a little worse.” She rubbed at her temples, as if she could dispel clinging thoughts with the motion.<br/><br/>“Migraine?”<br/><br/>“Start of a tension headache, I think.”<br/><br/>She felt the heat of his body behind her before his fingers flattened across her shoulders. His thumbs began working slow circles along the arc of her scapulae, slowly pressing toward her midline, kneading up to the base of her skull. “Mmm. I don’t pay you enough.”<br/><br/>“Going rate is two lingering kisses,” he murmured. If this was a foray into seduction, though, he ruined it quite adroitly: “What happened to your socks?”<br/><br/>“Oh. I guess I didn’t put a water repellant charm on my new boots. Apparated into that big puddle along the walk. Right there, that’s really good.” His fingers obliged her, even as he vented that little sigh of exasperation. Probably he rolled his eyes. She closed her own, and relaxed back into his touch. “I’d quit my job, you know, except I don’t think I’d get away with robbing Gringotts’ a second time, and damned if I know any other way to get galleons.”<br/><br/>His hands stilled, and he leaned his bony chin on her shoulder. “As much as I’d love to indulge you in fantasies of money-making criminal conspiracy, I do think you should put something on your feet. Go fetch your slippers while I rummage together some dinner. I think there’s still leftover stew.”<br/><br/>By the time she’d deposited her glass on the bedside table, and routed her slippers from beneath the bed, he’d reheated stew and poured them each a measure of red. “Praise be for leftovers,” she said, laying their places at the table. “How was your day? I’m sorry I didn’t ask straight off.”<br/><br/>“Oh, fine. If you quit your job you can stay home days and scrub cauldrons for me, y’know.”<br/><br/>“Sounds delightful.”<br/><br/>“You think I’m joking, but I swear I spent most of today cleaning glassware. How does it all get dirty, all at once? And who cleaned everything in the lab at school, because I’m sure it wasn’t me unless I had markedly more energy back then.”<br/><br/>“I don’t think you slept, personally.”<br/><br/>“Could be. Sterilizing distillation coils in a fugue state.”<br/><br/>“Sounds about right.”<br/><br/>“Well, the nice thing is that I don’t remember teaching half my classes, so at this far remove I’m able to feel a bit nostalgic about it all.”<br/><br/>“Ever think of going back?”<br/><br/>He gave her a horrified look over the top of his wine glass. “Not that nostalgic! If you ever hear me suggest such a profoundly stupid thing, I want you to hex me flat and call the Aurors to examine me for Imperius. Or else it’s someone pulling a polyjuice impersonation. And if not, you’d best check me into the Janus Thickey Ward.”<br/><br/>She laughed. “You could make friends with Gilderoy Lockhart, I suppose.”<br/><br/>“On second thought, just grant me a merciful death.”<br/><br/>“Oh no,” she said archly, “You can’t get away from me that easily.”<br/><br/>His smirk inexplicably softened, and his eyes too. “I assure you, Hermione, there would be nothing ‘easy’ about being away from you.”<br/><br/>She looked down at her plate and choked back a sob, hoping he hadn’t noticed. But of course he did. Even if he hadn’t spent twenty years a spy, he’d still spent two decades teaching, and so of course he noticed everything, and there was no point concealing that her eyes had begun leaking, but naturally she tried, hiding her face against his shoulder as he wrapped his arms around her.<br/><br/>“Are we just a bit overwrought tonight?” he asked, as he guided their bodies into the embrace of the sitting room sofa.<br/><br/>“Maybe just a bit,” she sniffled.<br/><br/>“Was it Rafferty again, or those berks in Patents?”<br/><br/>“Oh, work was about the same as always.”<br/><br/>“You’re allowed to leave at 5:00 pm, though. So what if Weasley keeps tabs on you, you’re hardly obligated to stay past dinner.”<br/><br/>“Today wasn’t Percy, it was Ron. Harry came by the office; he’d not been out of his room since last Wednesday, apparently. I keep telling him, if he just gave Kreacher orders not to take food up, this would never progress to the point of needing my intervention every fortnight or two!” She drew in a deep breath, and held it behind clenched teeth.<br/><br/>Severus, for his part, cocked his head to the side. Then, he solemnly reached across, gently pinched the tip of her nose and lightly twisted. <br/><br/>She blinked.<br/><br/>“I’m turning you down to a low simmer.” He nodded smartly.<br/><br/>Two rounds of a cathartic cushion fight, a crying jag, and a tickling match later, she collapsed against his chest with a proclamation worn soft with oft-usage: “You, Severus Snape, are a Class A git. And,” she said, rising slightly to press a kiss along his jaw, “I assure you, I would be completely and utterly wrecked without you.”<br/><br/>He stroked her hair, and didn’t comment for a long time. “I think you’d manage,” he eventually said. “You’d have some bad days, probably, but I think you’d be alright. In time.”<br/><br/>She closed her eyes, and turned her face into the soft wool of his jumper, as if this would prevent her hearing his words. “I guess I should be glad one of us thinks there’s hope for me.”<br/><br/>“There’s always hope,” he whispered. “Always.”<br/><br/>She didn’t think so, but it didn’t matter, because for now she had his heartbeat beneath her ear, his arm around her waist, and his gentle breathing guiding her own.</p>
