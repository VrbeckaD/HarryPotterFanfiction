    <p>Walking up to 12 Grimmauld Place, Hermione clutched the invitation tightly in her hand. The day was overcast and gloomy, the building dark and foreboding, and as if on cue, a raven began cawing nearby. The envelope felt heavy as if weighed down by her unease. It was printed on fine, smooth cardstock and read: </p><p>
  <i>Hermione Granger<br/>
This is the time for revenge, I hereby invite you to take part in a revenge game.</i>
</p><p>It was unsigned and yet, who could the host be, other than her best friend Harry Potter? He lived here with his uncle Sirius Black after the death of his parents, after all. But why the mysterious invitation delivered by post? Why not just hand it to her in person? And what exactly did he mean by a revenge game? </p><p>Too many questions swirled in Hermione’s mind and she was a slave to her own curiosity. Reaching for the front door, she found it unlocked. </p><p>“Harry? Harry, are you in here?” </p><p>Her calls were answered by silence, so she stepped inside and started walking down the dim hallway. Too late she realized that someone had been lying in wait for her arrival. She glimpsed the flash of a light behind her, as the stunning spell hit its target and her world turned black.</p><p>“Wakey, wakey Mudblood.” </p><p>Hermione rolled onto her back blinking her eyes, once, twice, and slowly sat up. Her head was pounding and she felt a bit disoriented, momentarily forgetting where she was. Looking around, she was startled to see Draco Malfoy stooped over her and sneering. </p><p>“Have a nice nap, princess? Did someone finally knock some sense into that know-it-all head of yours? While you were sleeping and being bloody useless, we were trying to figure out how to escape this room.” </p><p>“Trying to escape...Wait, what?” Hermione mumbled reaching for her wand only to grab empty air and finally noticing the other occupants around her. </p><p>Pansy Parkinson glared in her direction, Blaise Zabini leaned casually against a wall, and king Slytherin himself, Tom Riddle paced back and forth seemingly lost in thought. She couldn’t make sense of this group, they certainly weren’t friends of hers or Harry’s. Why would they be here of all people? Her mind clearing, she remembered being stunned in the first place. </p><p>“Did the rest of you receive invitations to the game as well?” Hermione asked standing up and adjusting her clothing and hair nervously.</p><p>“What invitation? What game?” Pansy barked, “I got an owl from Draco to meet so we could discuss our upcoming engagement.” </p><p>“Engagement? Bloody hell, Pansy, you really are gullible. I told you already that my parents signed a contract with the Greengrasses, get it through your thick skull, it’s over between us. I got an owl from mother, she’s on holiday with father in France, and wanted me to pick up something supposedly urgent from Sirius. When I arrived here, I was ambushed. What about you Blaise? How did you end up here?”</p><p>Blaise’s face flushed, but it was hard to see on his dark complexion. He recounted how he’d been shopping in Diagon Alley and rounded a corner through Knockturn. He was caught off guard and like the others woke up in this room. </p><p>Everyone turned to look at Tom pacing. Sensing four pairs of eyes upon him, Tom stopped mid step to focus his full attention on the bushy haired Gryffindor in a pit of snakes. “You said you received an invitation, is that correct Miss Granger? Or can I call you Hermione?” </p><p>“Granger is fine. I wouldn’t say we’re exactly on a first name basis Riddle.” She crossed her arms, defensively.</p><p>“Curious, that you should receive a summons while the rest of us appear to have been tricked or coerced into being here. And you mentioned a game? Is that what this is?”</p><p>“You tell me Riddle? I know as much as you do, I’m trapped in this room, same as you. All I know, is that I received an invitation to join a revenge game. It didn’t say anything more, it was unsigned and delivered by mail. I assumed Harry was too busy to drop it off in person, but when I came inside, I didn’t see him anywhere.” </p><p>At the mention of Harry Potter, everyone grew silent. Hermione felt a prickle along her spine, why did it feel as if the air had been sucked from the room? </p><p>“Granger...why are you referring to Potter in the present tense?” Draco carefully drawled. </p><p>“What do you mean, present tense?” Hermione trailed off, lurching forward and slipping into a forgotten memory. </p><p>

</p><p>It was just a flash of a scene. Watching Harry climb over the astronomy tower railing, Ron rushing over to grab him, tripping and them both tumbling over. Hermione was in shock. This can’t be a real memory, it must be a bad dream.  </p><p>“Wake up Hermione. Wake up Hermione!” She chanted over and over, louder and louder until her voice pitched into an hysterical sob. </p><p>Slap! Hermione’s head jerked to the side, cheek burning, she glared daggers at the smug face of Draco Malfoy. </p><p>“That’s for third year, you crazy bint. Now snap out of it!” he quipped, pleased at the opportunity for payback after all these years.</p><p>Tom stared at the display in cold calculation, taking a moment to assess her. Clearly the Mudblood had been obliviated, but how many of her memories were missing and why? They had been in this drawing room connected to a bathroom for about twenty minutes, windows magically sealed, doors locked, and wandless. The five of them were gathered for a purpose and from the sound of the girl’s ranting, it had something to do with a game of revenge. </p><p>Tom had similarly received an owl this morning, but his letter was most disturbing. It stated, <i>“I’ve got your diary, come to 12 Grimmauld Place post haste or I shall be lighting some fiendfyre for warmth in your absence.” </i></p><p>How dare someone touch and steal his things. This mystery host must know the true value of his diary if they were threatening fiendfyre. It couldn’t have been Harry Potter, as he had toppled to a most satisfactory death several days ago, along with that pathetic Weasley parasite. </p><p>Tom had killed two birds with one stone, which was quite an accomplishment, if he did say so himself. Remembering the golden boy made his blood boil, few knew the fact that Tom Riddle hated Harry Potter. Potter also an orphan had everything handed to him, while Riddle worked hard for every gain. He despised being compared to that privileged waste of space that coasted through life with ease. In fact, if Potter were here right now, Tom would gladly imperio him to his doom again and again. </p><p>So, if Potter wasn’t behind this sorry plot, the Mudblood in their midst, and given the location they stood, Sirius Black must be the host of this farce.</p><p>Speak of the devil and he doth appear.</p><p>The haggard figure of Sirius Black materialized in the worn and dusty mirror above the fireplace. </p><p>“Good afternoon children! From this moment on, you will be participating in my proposed game. The rules are simple, you just have to find the rat amongst you that has revealed all your secrets to me and kill them. Everything about you is being monitored and I will be watching at all times. Every hour, someone will be killed, until only one of you is left standing. You’ll never get out of here, unless you kill the rat.” </p><p>“What the actual fuck.” Draco scoffed, “Looks like Sirius went off the deep end just like dear aunt Bella.” </p><p>“Sirius! Sirius, it’s me, Hermione! Don’t do this, listen to reason. Please, you’re like an uncle to me, let us out! Let’s talk about this, I miss Harry too, but this isn’t the answer. This isn’t right.”</p><p> As Sirius’ figure faded from the mirror a countdown clock appeared, the flashing green numbers letting them know that time was ticking and the game had begun.</p><p>

</p><p>Something about Sirius was off, well, besides his insane Battle Royale proposal. More confused than ever, Hermione closed her eyes and pinched the bridge of her nose in frustration. Concentrating, she tried to pull up the memory of Harry’s death, but could recall no further details surrounding the event. The scene felt so faint and fleeting, she could hardly accept it had happened. </p><p>“I can’t believe Harry is gone! I feel like I’m in a parallel universe where everything is wrong and nothing is right. What happened to him? Why did all of you go silent at the mention of his name?” </p><p>“Well, it’s not proper to speak of teen suicide in polite company, Granger, show a little decorum.” Draco interjected in a mocking tone. </p><p>“Show a little, decorum?! You are unbelievable Malfoy! Are you incapable of showing Harry a little respect, even in death? You’re a disgusting excuse for a human being!” </p><p>“Wah, cry me a river Princess Priss. Saint Potter and the Weasel’s death are clearly a case of survival of the fittest, one was too weak and the other too stupid and clumsy to live.” </p><p>“You are the worst Malfoy! I don’t know how you sleep at night.” Hermione snapped.</p><p>“I sleep quite soundly, let me assure you Mudblood, especially now that there’s a little less filth polluting my world.” Hermione lunged at Draco, but Tom held her back from attacking. </p><p>“Now Miss Granger, I understand this is a trying time for you and you are upset, but let’s not stoop to Draco’s level, I believe you’re above such behavior.” </p><p>Taking a deep breath, Hermione swatted Tom’s hands off her person and stomped to the other side of the room.</p><p>“Well, this is just great. Like I have nothing better to do than stand around in this dingy room all day.” Pansy bristled, tossing her hair and stamping her foot like a petulant child. </p><p>“Way to make light of the situation Pans.” Blaise countered. “You did hear Black say that we’re meant to kill each other, right? Or were you distracted by something shiny?” </p><p>“Piss off Blaise, I heard that lunatic. He can’t possibly be serious, what am I supposed to do? Bludgeon you with the fireplace spade? And how is he planning to kill one of us when the times up? If he walks through the door with a wand, we can easily overpower him. It’s a ridiculous premise and he’s an idiot for thinking we’d participate. Besides, we’ve already searched the room and I didn’t see any weapons lying around. Pfft, but what can one really expect? He’s a Gryffindor and a man to boot, he doesn’t know his ass from his elbow.”</p><p> “Pans, you do realize that most of the occupants in this room are men?” </p><p>“My point exactly.” She sniped.</p><p>“Speaking of asses and elbows.” Draco trailed off, pulling the Italian aside. “I was in a tangle of them Friday night after the Hallow’s Eve party. You should have seen the girls fighting for my attention Blaise, they were practically gagging for it.” </p><p>Elbowing him, Draco waggled his eyebrows and smirked. “One was dressed as a cat and the other a bunny, it was like my own sexy menagerie!” </p><p>“Merlin Draco, you’re such a slut. Didn’t you have Astoria in your room last night?” Blaise shook his head chuckling.</p><p>“Well, I have to keep up appearances, my boy.” Draco grinned from ear to ear.</p><p>“Who are you, Slughorn? You know emulating the professor won’t get you an invite to slug club, right?” </p><p>“Fuck you, Blaise, that man can only dream of being a Malfoy.” Draco spat, bitterness coloring his tone.</p><p>“Well, I had fun with a hot healer myself, because unlike you, I’m not into beasteality.” All teasing at once forgotten, they burst out into laughter.</p><p>Time dragged on slowly as they milled about the room. Hermione sat in a corner, using breathing exercises to meditate. She tried to determine how far back her memories had been tampered with and hoped to recollect the missing information. </p><p>Pansy lounged with a hand across her forehead, sighing like a Victorian lady on her fainting couch. Draco and Blaise sat on the other sofa and continued talking and joking without a care in the world. </p><p>Tom closely reexamined all entry and exit points. They were sealed with something much more powerful than a simple locking spell and his wandless magic ability specialized in torturing enemies or followers, not breaking down ancient family wards. Tom also detected an anti-disapparition jinx in place, though he doubted anyone besides himself capable of wandless apparition. The rest could rot in this prison for all he cared.</p><p>As the numbers ticked down toward zero, unwittingly they all gathered underneath the mirror watching the clock avidly, and wondering what would happen next. The numbers changed from green to red, 10...9...8. </p><p>Draco nudged Blaise making an obscene hand gesture and snickering. 7...6. </p><p>Pansy looked over at them and rolled her eyes. 5...4. </p><p>Hermione chewed on her lip nervously crossing her arms. 3… </p><p>Tom rocked back and forth on his heels in anticipation with a glint in his eyes. 2...1. </p><p>A very loud and shrill alarm filled the room and a thick white smoke unfurled from the crack under the door.</p><p>Hermione walked over to check the doorknob, but it wasn’t hot. So it didn’t seem like there was a fire on the other side. Suddenly a blood curdling scream could be heard and turning sharply, Hermione’s eyes went wide, jaw slack at the horrific sight before her. </p><p>Blaise Zabini was convulsing on the floor, clawing his face and howling as he bled from his eyes, nose, ears, and mouth. A pool of blood formed beneath him and covered his body more and more as he shook and rolled in agony. An eternity was felt in the thirty seconds he suffered, as silence engulfed the room.</p><p>Once again, Sirius appeared in the mirror, his eyes a bit crazed as he ran a hand through his long dark locks. </p><p>“Children, what I failed to mention before, is that all of you have been injected with a different kind of poison. Each is unique in its side effects and activator. Should you find the rat and kill them, the survivors will be given an antidote. As you can see, I am deadly serious about this game, play or die. The choice is yours.”</p><p>His visage was replaced by the timer once more and the unwilling players were forced to see the game and each other with new eyes.</p>
