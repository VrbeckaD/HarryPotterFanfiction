<p>Harry groans in pain as Ares cauterizes the stump where his left arm used to be. He had barely made it back to the magical blind that Loki had set up for the resistance to live in. The situation has been assessed as final, the Earth will be lost as soon as the last 8 remaining gods and the last mortal are gone.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry's raw voice hisses through the pain. "Should have known that Ol' Moldynuts would have one last great 'fuck you' up his sleeve. I, I think we need to chance the ritual we were discussing. Send one of you back to train a true champion for our realm." </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ares shakes his head, looking down. "If any of us that currently live were to go back, we would not be trusted in that time, Harry! We were Villains! The bad guys..... If you had met any of us back then you would have fought against us. Face it, our realm is lost!" His head snaps back as Hela punched the god of war in the face. She rounds to the other gods, her eyes like black pits. "My fellow gods, Titans, and Eternals, listen to Harry. He sees things from a perspective of one who would have died in the next century or two, as such he sees the closer picture better than all of us." She turns to look at Harry, a boy she has started to think of as her brother. " Tell us, who should we send back? The god or goddess who goes will have to have some connection to you, as its obvious to me, that as you are the last one standing here, that you..... you should be our champion."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry's brow creases, as he thinks, 'who am I connected to?', and an image flashes before his eyes. An image of his birth certificate, and on the name lines (and why the hell do pureblood families give their kids so many names anyway?) <u>Harngrim James Loki Hector Potter</u>. He looks to Loki and smiles, whispering "We send back the Silver-tongued one of course. He should be able to convince at least a few people to help with the training, and, if he can stop his brother from starting a war with Jotunheim, they would make great warriors for our side."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The other gods nod and start to leave to gather the materials needed for the ritual. As they return, Hela hands Loki a helmet, looking upon it he realizes its Odin's war helm. He nods and carries it under his arm as the other gods spill their blood onto the stone rings, causing them to spin faster and faster around Loki, the chanting of the other gods and Harry reaches a fevered pitch, and Loki finds himself back on the Bifrost looking at Heimdal. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Heimdal's all-seeing eyes widen as he gazes upon Loki. His voice booms as he notices the war helm under Loki's arm. "Prince Loki, What happened and how did you damage your father's helm so badly?" He reaches out and rests a hand on Loki's shoulder and images of the war and deaths to come flash before his eyes. Loki is shocked to see tears start to fall as Heimdal gazes upon him again. " Go quickly, to your father King Odin will know what to do, and will help you." </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Loki turns to run off and looks back over his shoulder, calling out, "What year is it on Midgard right now? I need to know how long I have to prepare our realm's champion!" Heimdal smiles slightly, calling back, " My prince, It is currently 1994 C.E. The one that was chosen has 19 days until his 4th birthday."</p>
