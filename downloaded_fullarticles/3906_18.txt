    <p>Ethel stops just before the Floo. The fireplace is a little scuffed with ash and past Floo-exiting mishaps. The mantelpiece is filled with knickknacks; little trinkets from wandering the woods near the back of the house, old acorns and shiny river stones, a frame of pressed daisy chains she’d made for Mum’s birthday years back. There’s the family picture frame sitting in the middle of it all. Her dad has a proud grin on his face and mum’s face is lit up in a beatific smile, their arms linked. Her brother looks like he wants to do nothing more than go back to his pile of Christmas presents, sneaking glances at his pile by the tree and a suspiciously broom-like wrapped lump in it. Her toddler self is beaming gummily.</p><p>
  <span>“Ethel? You go on first, I’m just looking for my shoes!” Mum yells from somewhere upstairs.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Most of the family have left, her dad first and then her brother. Her trunk has gone through already with them, so really, there’s nothing stopping her from stepping through. She runs her hand over her tight braids, smooths down the hem of her sunny blue dress one last time. Her hands are a little clammy but no one’s around to judge.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Once she steps through the fire, there will be no going back. She’ll be on Platform Nine-and-three-quarters, boarding the eleven o’clock train to Hogsmeade Station for her first term as a Hogwarts student. Mum looked teary-eyed at breakfast this morning, and Dad hadn’t stopped called her Princess all day, even though she hadn’t like that nickname since she was eight. Even her brother chuckled at their antics with a roll of his eye, but ruffled her hair fondly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She grabs a pinch of green Floo powder, the fine dust clenched tightly in her hand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yes, of course, she’s nervous – terrified even. But there’s no choice. There never has been.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Platform Nine-and-three-quarters!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ethel Diggory takes a breath, steps forward and shuts her eyes.</span>
</p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>At first, she hadn’t known. It wasn’t like it was obvious.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As Amos Diggory tells it, their second child had been a surprise. Born in the height of the Second War, it wasn’t really the sort of auspicious start any parent wanted for their child. She was born on the kitchen floor of his mother-in-law’s cottage in the Welsh countryside, because they’d been visiting over Christmas and “out you came, like a belated Christmas present!”, as the tale goes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She hadn’t exactly been lucid for her birth, that would have been disgusting, but she did remember the traumatic moments – an awful, suffocating, squeezing sensation, the choking on the gasp of her first breath, terrified because she’d forgotten how to </span>
  <em>
    <span>breathe –</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>It wasn’t any sort of Christmas present she would have wanted.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There were snippets she could recall, of feeling trapped within a tiny body and unable to tell her body to move like she wanted to, of wanting to ask where she was - only for little gurgles to slip out of her mouth, her tongue heavy and clumsy. Of the constant panic and fear of those first six months where she couldn’t see much more than a blur of colour, and huge hands would move her dizzyingly without her control, and if she had forgotten how to breathe, what else was there that she had forgotten?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Later, she felt bad for putting her parents through that, struggling through the war with a two-year old and a baby that wouldn’t stop crying. It must have been exhausting. She had had no idea what was going on, only that she knew she shouldn’t feel like this, a clumsy drooling baby, but she didn’t know what she should be instead.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She did get used to it, after a while, and then she could see clearly, and breathe properly, and things felt a little less </span>
  <em>
    <span>wrong</span>
  </em>
  <span>, and finally understand the gibberish people spouted at her well enough to recognise her name.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ethel.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Ethel?</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>It was the name of old ladies knitting in the corner! Crazy cat ladies with fur sticking to their clothes! Wrinkles and grey hair!! Not the name parents should bestow on their Innocent Newborn Daughter!</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her name was Ethel and they’d been saying it to her for so long that she couldn’t help but respond to it now – was that brainwashing?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>(Actually, what was brainwashing?)</span>
</p><p>
  <span>After a while, she had accepted the name, accepted the weirdness of her parents and her older brother wriggling his hand in her face until she was tempted to chomp on it. But it wasn’t until she was nearly three, that she found out where she was.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It had been summer and lazily warm. Cedric, her parents shouldn’t be allowed to name children, liked to spend it at a few friends houses’ or flying around the house on his junior broom because even though it wasn’t allowed, the house was way cooler than the garden. Meanwhile, Ethel would spend the day rolling around on the cool slate floor until she was panting from giggling too hard and then she’d wheedle Cedric until he entertained her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Cedric was a fairly good kid. He loved to run around and fly and wrestle his friends into the mud tackling quaffles. He had Dad’s darker colouring, hair that tended towards a brown than Mum’s golden blonde, and Dad’s grey eyes, but his face tended more to Mum’s refined angles than Dad’s strong jawline and wider-set nose. He was a good big brother too, who let her be the dragon every time he got his figurines out and didn’t tattle on her when she made it eat one of Mum’s earrings.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He wasn’t perfect though. He liked to jump out from behind the cupboard door and scare Mum whilst she was baking, and he loved teasing her until her face was Howler red. Sometimes when his friends came over, he would shrug apologetically and then run around with them for hours until it felt like he’d forgotten he was Ethel’s friend too.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That day, she’d done her last bit of rolling, summer dust staining her skirt and had been looking for something to do. Cedric was puttering about in his room and the last time she’d gone to bother him for a game, it had been boring (“It’s called Sit-As-Quietly-As-You-Can, Ethel, it’s really fun I bet!”) so she was looking for something a little more interesting.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She had just decided to look for Mum or Dad to entertain her instead, when she spotted it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mum had left the backdoor open to let a breeze in, no doubt, and Cedric’s Junior Cleansweep was sitting innocently by the door. Instantly, she had her newest game.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ethel grabbed the handle with a giggle and darted out into the sun. The air was still hot as ever, but now she had a plan. The broom was cool in her hand as she laid it down on the long grass, she was going to fly!</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Let’s go!” She told the broom.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It didn’t move.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fly!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Not even a twitch.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She scowled, maybe brooms weren’t made for flying after all (but then what were they made for?). How did Cedric do it? He’d certainly never showed her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was something niggling in the back of her brain, like a wispy stray thought.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Stick your right hand over your broom -- and say UP!”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“UP!” She yelled.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The broomstick snapped into her hand, with a sharp sting. She giggled, “Ethel knows magic, Ethel knows magic!” She sing-songed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sometimes, it felt wrong, to act so childishly. Sometimes it felt so wrong she thought she’d throw up, like her body was all screwed up and her legs were too short and her voice too high. But, it sometimes made her happy. To skip and giggle and jabber to Mum about being a fairy queen.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She mounted the broom, uncaring of her skirt, with a grin.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ethel kicked off the ground as hard as she could and up, up she went! Air rushed through her hair, her skirt floofed up like a cloud. Slowly, carefully, she leaned forwards a little and the wobbly broomstick began to </span>
  <em>
    <span>move.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Oh, it was scary, it wobbled with every turn, but it was so </span>
  <em>
    <span>cool!</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ethel! Ethel!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She looked up. Cedric was at his window, eyes wide. Yes, she imagined him saying, I have the coolest little sister.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Get down! That’s my broom!” He hissed, looking around frantically.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nyeh!” She stuck her tongue out deliberately, lifting one hand off to wave. Only, she was a three year old, on a flying broomstick, four feet off the ground, she didn’t have any sort of coordination on the ground, let alone in the air, and it was right at that moment, that she saw Mum’s face in the kitchen window pale.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>WHAM-Ethel hit the ground hard.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Someone shrieked. Footsteps came running. But all she could focus on was her pudgy little ankle, lying at an awkward angle. Pain sparked suddenly, until her spots of white filled her vision.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ethel, oh my baby!” Mum was suddenly clutching her tight, “Oh, her foot, her foot!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We need to get to St Mungo’s,” Someone was saying.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But all she could focus on was the odd white-purpleness of her foot and Dad’s words loud and clear, ringing in her ears: “Cedric Diggory! Why did you leave your broom out, you stupid boy!”</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Cedric Diggory.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>A character from a series of movies, she had liked once upon a time, played by an actor who she couldn’t stand. The boy who fell to Peter Pettigrew’s hand at the Resurrection of Dark Lord Voldemort. The character who was simply in the wrong place, at the wrong time. Not the main character, not the comic relief, not the guide on a journey.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The spare.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He was her brother.</span>
</p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>The Platform is a chaotic mess of children and parents. She nearly steps on a toad as she leaves the Floo but someone knocks into her as they shuffle past and the it disappears between her feet. There are more kids than she’s ever seen in her life, more than even the Weasley’s have. And it’s loud. A lady somewhere out of sight yells for a hurtling child to slow down, there’s a man whose trolley wheel looks like it’s stuck in a dip in the floor, his face getting steadily redder and redder.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Cedric and Dad are a little ways off from the Floo entrance to the Platform. She weaves her way past the other witches and wizards until they spot her and Cedric plucks her from the moving crowd, with a laugh.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Took you ages!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She sticks her tongue out at him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dad shakes his head at them and pulls them closer away from the swell of the crowd. “Where’s your mother?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mum was looking for her shoe.” She supplies, after a moment.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her brother sighs, “I’m supposed to be meeting everyone in fifteen minutes.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s not like they won’t save you a seat.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I suppose.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mum turns up a few minutes later, lilac robes immaculate despite having travelled through a fireplace, hair in a neat bun. She ushers them out from the Floo waiting area towards the exit for the actual Platform, fussing with Ced’s shirt and hair with Ethel sniggering at his put-upon look all the way.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The first thing she sees, is in fact not the train, but the steam. It billows thick high up in the air, until it disappears somewhere near the high ceilings of the station. There is a dark smudge amongst the smog for a moment, and then it lifts and a shape emerges. The train is a bright, jolly red, like rubies or fresh tomatoes in summer, carriages stretching beyond her peripheral. And there are people everywhere, constantly moving.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The Hogwart’s Express.” Cedric say’s with a knowing, fond grin. “Pretty cool, huh?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It’s all Ethel can do to nod. It’s </span>
  <em>
    <span>amazing.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“Now,” She drags her eyes away as Mum begins to talk. “Don’t forget to owl us if you need anything, and I expect a letter soon, okay?” Mum fiddles with the cuff of her sleeve and then scoops her into a hug, tearily.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Look out for you sister, won’t you, Cedric?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Course, I will, Dad.” Her brother says with an affectionate huff.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mum releases her, and then it’s Dad’s turn to sweep her up. “Be good, Princess. You’ll be just fine.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And then he lets go, gives her a little push towards the train and Cedric grabs her hand. “C’mon,” He says softly, pushing their trolley towards one of the train doors. Ethel glances back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mum and Dad are linking arms and waving, proud smiles on their faces.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Before she knows it, Ethel is on the train – the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Hogwart’s Express</span>
  </em>
  <span> – in an empty carriage with her luggage stowed away under her seat and they are pulling out of the station in a cacophony of shrieking metal, piercing whistles and the accelerating beat of a steam engine.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Some people meet their best friends on their first ride to school,” Cedric had said, “but not everyone does, so don’t worry too much about it.” And then he’d patted her on the head, like an adult even though he was only </span>
  <em>
    <span>nearly </span>
  </em>
  <span>fourteen. “Give it a try anyways, I’ll come find you later, okay?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Honestly, does he want her to make friends or not?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The train threads through a long dark tunnel, only broken by the twinkle of tiny lights, floating by as the Express hurtles past.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She’s been counting down the days, the years, to this since the day she fell off Cedric’s old broomstick. She’s not sure why she exists, if she’s honest. Some cosmic mistake by the universe, a slip of an author’s pen on the page. She doesn’t remember dying, but she’s very sure she isn’t supposed to exist.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ethel Diggory was never mentioned in the Harry Potter movies. She’s pretty sure Ethel Diggory is never mentioned in the whole franchise.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She had never made the connection between Cedric – her brother – and Cedric – the </span>
  <em>
    <span>spare ­– </span>
  </em>
  <span>because she’d never heard their surname before, and he didn’t look a thing like the boy in the movie. The floating lights around her crib, the swish of Mum’s wand to iron out wrinkles in her blouse, the sight of Cedric flying on a broom, </span>
  <em>
    <span>magic </span>
  </em>
  <span>had seemed a perfectly, accepted ordinary thing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But she hadn’t even thought that she might have been born into JK Rowling’s fantasy universe until that moment.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>For a few months, she had considered telling someone, but she doubted “I think I’m stuck inside a book” would make her sound anything less than insane – unless she was Tom Riddle, of course. On the off-chance that someone did believe her and not ship her off to a long-term bed in St Mungo’s, who’s to say they wouldn’t just obliviate her and keep the information to themselves, or change the future so that Voldemort would win? Or worse, affect it enough that everybody died.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ethel isn’t smart enough either, to be some grand master manipulator like the Dark Lord or even Dumbledore. She can’t try and play such a grand game, trying to think so many moves ahead of her opponents, can’t even hope to.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Perhaps, if she’d been born earlier in the timeline of the Story, maybe attended Hogwarts with her parents, or Tom Riddle, she might have been able to change things.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The fact is, she soon realises, Ethel does not want to change the Story.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She doesn’t want to be responsible for the lives lost and feel the weight of every single life in Britain resting on her shoulders and her actions. Harry Potter was and is the hero of the Story, he fills that role quite nicely, and she has no desire to get in the way of that. She doesn’t have any sort of hero-complex or people-saving-thing to pander to, no urgent desire to save the children the trauma of what their years at the Castle will be.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She only wants one thing – to save Cedric.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>From a pragmatic point of view, Cedric’s death isn’t even necessary to the Story. It does not lead to any sort of dramatic rebellion in his name, nor does his death help hinder Voldemort’s plans. It is a meaningless death, a waste of life and potential and utterly pointless. It makes Harry Potter look like he is complicit in the murder of a boy, and the truth of Voldemort’s resurrection like the spun-tale of a panicked celebrity looking for a scapegoat.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And he is her big brother. The boy who showed her how to make snow angels and raced her down the stairs to rip open her presents. The boy who hugged her after her nightmares, and didn’t mind her cold feet under his sheets. Her best friend.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ethel isn’t going to let him ever be the Spare.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The train finally emerges from the long tunnel, light bursting through the windows across the carriage. In the tunnel’s place, are rolling green hills and stooping heather, bending like water rippling on a lake. Somehow, they’ve left London.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A hesitant knock on the compartment door jolts her out of her daydream, the faint shadow of a person behind the frosted glass.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Er…” Ethel clears her throat. “Come in?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The door slides open. There’s a blonde boy, face a little red, biting his lip stood at the threshold. a heavy looking black trunk in one hand and a wooden box under his armpit, the other hand gripping the door still.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Um,” His eyes flicker to the empty seats, “Can I s…s-sit with you?” His ears flushing to their tips.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Go for it,” Ethel attempts a smile – how do people make friends?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The boy drags his trunk in, the metal tipped corners scraping along the ground heavily, an awkward creaking sound echoing from the floor below it as he moves to push it under his seat.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“…Do you want some help?” She offers after watching him struggle for a moment.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He shakes his head rapidly, “’m fine.” He mumbles, gives the trunk one last shove, before deciding that is as far as it can go and then sits down opposite her, clutching the small wooden box from before.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ethel looks down at the book in her hand, about magical creatures, and then back up at the boy opposite her fiddling with the lid of his box, sneaking shy glances at her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Cedric had told her to try, after all.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She takes a deep breath, and then sticks her hand out. The boy jumps and stares at the hand a little cross-eyed, like it might bite.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m Ethel Diggory.” She squeaks. Her hand suddenly feels horribly clammy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He blinks at her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Oh dear, maybe that isn’t how you made friends after all, it’s not like she has much experience. Oh no. Oh no. She feels the blush begin to rise up her neck.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Then, his hand twitches up to meet hers. “I’m –“</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Instead of fingers, Ethel instead finds herself holding a black frog, slimy and cold. It’s bulbous yellow eyes stare up at her and then it blinks slowly, one eyelid after another. She tries not to gag, urgh, at the sound it’s eyelids make. It is really, really weird and oddly bumpy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Must. Not. Throw.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She wants to fling it out the window and far, far away.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Trevor!” The boy yelps and then snatches the thing off her. She gapes the viscous trail of slime it leaves in the air as it’s eased back into the box. “I mean! I’m not Trevor, I’m c…c… My name’s Neville Longbottom!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Oh. Her first instinct is to blurt out ‘</span>
  <em>
    <span>No, you’re not.’ </span>
  </em>
  <span>She doesn’t of course but she thinks it very loudly. Didn’t Neville have brown hair? Then again, in the Story Cedric had a sandy-blonde shade instead of the rich brown her brother had. Besides, why would someone lie about being Neville Longbottom, of all people? So it must be him then.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Isn’t that just great! Absolutely smashing!</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Not even at Hogwarts and the Story has already made its appearance. Discretely, she tries to wipe off the sheen of slime onto the seat cover beside her. “It’s nice to meet you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Neville looks like he might cry still. “I’m really sorry!” He just about whispers, face likely redder than the train they’re on.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s okay.” She tries to shrug, yeah it’s a little icky, but she doesn’t hate him over it. She might hold a grudge against Trevor, but Neville looks like he might cry if she held one against him. Suddenly, she remembers that in the books, he had lost Trevor on the Platform too. Trevor, the Truant Toad. She’s laughing out loud before she can help herself. “Does he try to escape often?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lots!” Neville blurts, but his lips twitch into an unsure smile.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She grins back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He was a b… he was a b-birthday p…p-present,” He tries to explain, “From my Uncle Algie.” He keeps his hand stiffly clamped around the lid this time.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lucky! I wish someone bought me a pet for my birthday!” Although preferably not a toad or frog, she thinks delicately.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know if he really likes me though,” Neville sighs, despondently. “He’s tried to escape so many times.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh.” Well, that was a bit sad. “Maybe…” Ethel hmm’s thoughtfully, eying the small box. “Maybe he doesn’t like his box?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They both stare at the box in his hands, large enough for a growing frog, but not much bigger than that.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, no!” Neville moans, slumping in his seat. “It’s so small! And dark! It’s like a p-prison!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There, there,” Ethel pats him on the shoulder, oh no, please don’t cry. Please don’t cry! “My brother’s on the train, he’s a third year so I’m sure he knows some spells to make it nicer!” She tried, a little desperately.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sorry, Trevor,” Neville whispers to the box. “I didn’t know.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Cedric better pop his head in soon, or she’s going to have to explain Mum and Dad in her letter home how she made a boy cry on her first train ride to school.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The toad is suspiciously silent.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Isn’t Hermione supposed to help Neville on the way to Hogwarts? Where is her bushy head now? Ethel sneaks a glance at the compartment door, but there’s nobody outside to interrupt.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’ll help you now.” He says to the box solemnly. “Just wait a little b…b-bit longer.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She feels a little bit like a fraud, or at least more than she already does for finding her way into the Story, when Neville Longbottom looks up gratefully like she’s just saved his life.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The rest of the train ride is quiet apart from an appearance of the trolley cart, heaving with confectionary on tiny little wheels. Ethel buys a sugar quill and some sour bonbons, Neville hesitantly copies her and gets a few shooting stars, which wizz out of their packet and zoom around his head, glowing softly before dropping back into the palm of his hand. Ethel eats her sweets first, leaving a few bonbons in the bag for later on, and then promptly decides that since she’s hungry she should eat lunch. Neville agrees too and they take it in turns to hold Trevor’s Box while the other eats – she holds it as far from her body as possible – as they watch fields full of cows and sheep flick past.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Later Cedric does poke his head in and looks mightily surprised that she’s not alone anymore (rude!). He doesn’t know the spell, it turns out, “Not a permanent one,” but he does know that Professor Flitwick cast something on Bonnie Goldstein’s Puffskein last year to keep it from running for the kitchens every time she left the room.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Alright, sis?” He asks, as his eyes flick between Neville and Ethel. And then he turns to the boy with a quirk of his lips. “Not giving you too much trouble, is she?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Neville just about squeaks a “No!” and then looks like he resolutely wishes the ground could swallow him whole.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m never any trouble!” Ethel says back quickly, because as much as she loves Cedric, he’s so embarrassing sometimes!</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hmm…” He slows, pretending to think. “What about that time…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There was no time!” She yelps and then promptly shoves him out the door, face burning so much she’s probably glowing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Neville is watching her with wide eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Um…” She stares at the floor instead. “…he’s really embarrassing.” She says weakly, sidling back to her seat.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Cedric should never meet any friends she makes, she decides right there. She doesn’t know if sharing a compartment with Neville makes them friends, but if this is how he acts with someone she’s only just met then maybe he should just watch from a distance. She nods to herself and pretends Neville isn’t sneaking glances at her, like a wary dog.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Instead she cracks open her book and starts the chapter on Inchnadamphs, it’s picture looks like a particularly fluffy looking sea urchin, hidden in the corner of a bookshelf.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Outsides the scenery gradually changes from the fields and winding lanes to wilder woods, and twisting rivers speeding by is silver flashes between dark green hills and over deep valleys. The sun hadn’t quite set, the next time Ethel looks up, but it is dipping lower and lower in the sky, casting a brilliant orange across their compartment.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sorry for earlier,” She winces when Neville’s head snaps up. He must think she was ignoring him – which she has been, it’s only that it was really embarrassing to turn round and realised she’d acted like a crazy person in front of perfectly nice, docile, Neville Longbottom. “You must think I’m really weird.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Neville blushes. Oh dear, he did think that, probably still does. “S’okay.” He says, ducking his head.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It isn’t that bad, she supposes, Story-wise that they share a compartment. He’s quiet and nice and really, he isn’t too involved in the plot until much later anyways. Right now, he’s only marginally more of a character than she is, regulated to unfortunate comic-relief. Someone completely off-screen, so to speak, would be better but Neville is a good choice. And besides, if Ethel gets too far away from the plot, will she be able to help Cedric? Probably not.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Anyways,” She says, standing, “It’s getting late so we’ll probably be at Hogwarts soon. I’ll go to the bathroom to change?” Her trunk is hefted from under the seat and she grabs the first set of uniform she sees before slamming the lid closed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll change here?” Neville offers, “If that’s okay?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sure.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She steps out into the corridor and the door shuts behind her, lock closing with a soft </span>
  <em>
    <span>snick.</span>
  </em>
  <span> There are a few people standing outside other compartments, probably waiting for their friends to change. Ethel wanders down the carriages with the vague idea of dodging any more high-profile people, but there are loads of kids on the train, and it isn’t like they look like the movies anyhow, so it’s probably going to be impossible to avoid them until they quite literally introduce themselves.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She passes a few boys about her age huddling over some chocolate frog cards.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But how does that even work?!” One is saying, throwing his hands in the air in frustration.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Dunno,” The other one shrugs, the chaser on his t-shirt scoring a goal and cheering for himself silently. “We’re only first years.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A few carriages further down, she spots one of her brother’s friends – Bonnie, apparently also the one with the crazy Puffskein – leaning against the window, her black hair ruffling in the wind behind her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“…hiya.” Ethel tries, because she’s been walking up and down the train for a while now and she still hasn’t seen a toilet to change in.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh,” Bonnie jumps, hand jolting to rest on her chest. “You gave me a fright!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sorry,” She blushes, it wasn’t like she meant to.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Bonnie is the only friend Cedric has that’s a girl, although her hair is cropped close to her head like a boy’s hair cut and she wears ribbons around her wrists like bracelets. “Are you looking for your brother, Ethel?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She shakes her head sheepishly. “The bathroom,” and lifts up her change of clothes in explanation.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh dear,” Bonnie chuckles, “You must have passed it a while back.” She glances at the door to a compartment, before shaking her head. “C’mon, I’ll show you where it is, the boys are going to take ruddy forever.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She’s right, it turns out. Ethel passed the bathrooms two carriages back and just hadn’t spotted it. Thanking her, she heads in as Bonnie turns back. The stall is surprisingly spacious, despite the fact that the door outside looks like a cupboard in the wall – extension charms maybe? There’s enough room for two people to spin around with their arms out to the side, so plenty enough to change in.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The Hogwarts uniform is mostly grey. A grey pleated skirt to her knees, and a grey knitted jumper over a white shirt and a black tie – which is the trickiest to put on. Mum has made her practice every day to make sure she could do it herself, and Ethel grins at her reflection in the mirror when it pulls tight to make a decent knot. Third time, lucky, of course. Lastly, there is a pair of grey socks and shiny black shoes. And to top it off, her black Hogwarts robe, the crest sewn in over where her heart is.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She straightens out a few stray hairs from her braid and then gives the mirror her best smile. It looks a little shaky at best, downright anxious at worst.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lovely, darling! Very smart, and studious looking!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you.” She pipes back, heart stuttering in her chest, twin pricks of red appearing on her reflection’s cheeks. It isn’t like being caught doing something stupid by a real person, but still she’d been admiring herself in the mirror and been caught by said Mirror, so it’s still a little embarrassing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She slips out into the hallway. It’s a lot noisier than earlier, people hurrying by and chatting loudly, so they were probably getting close to Hogsmeade. Everyone looked to be heading back to their trunks to change, or milling in the corridors waiting for other people to change. Ethel only just steps back it to their compartment again when a voice echoes through the train.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We will be reaching Hogwarts in five minutes’ time. Please leave your luggage on the train, it will be taken to school separately.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Neville pales immediately and Ethel feels as faint as he looks. Oh, Merlin, this is it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Should I take Trevor w…w-with me?” They both look at the box in his hands.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ethel vaguely remembers something about a toad and the lake and promptly decides that in order to keep herself from Neville’s tears, it’s probably best if the toad stays within his sights. “You could hide the box in your sleeve?” The robe sleeves are stupidly wide and definitely long enough to hide at least five toad boxes inside.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He nods nervously and pulls his wide sleeve over his hand and then they join the crowd in the corridor.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The train slows right down, brakes shrieking and hissing all the way, to a halt. People pushing their way towards the doors, bony elbows and jabbing figures. Ethel grabs onto Neville’s other sleeve, the Trevor-less one, there are so many bodies fitted in the train, pressing and shoving, like sardines in a can. Eventually they stumble out onto a tiny platform, into the evening air. It’s certainly cooler than this morning, and the sun is just setting, the orange of the sky bleeding into a deep blue.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Firs’ years! Firs’ years over here!” A loud voice booms over the crowd. They stumble towards it, dodging older kids, rushing past. “C’mon, follow me!” A giant of a man, so huge he towers over the crowd of slowly gathering first years. She has to crane her neck to see him – Hagrid, her brain supplies. His face is round and jolly, and his hair and beard dark and thick. He gives them all a cheerful grin. “Mind yer step, now! Firs’ years follow me!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hagrid leads them down a steep, narrow slope, slipping and stumbling. It’s lucky that Scotland is still light this time in the evening, imagine navigating the path in the dark! There are thick trees to either side of them blotting the sky to a thin strip up above, and loose rocks and all manner of things to trip on. She thinks she catches a glimpse of red hair up near the front at one point. Nobody speaks much, concentrating on putting the next foot down and avoiding loose tree roots.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The giant is saying something else, up at the front but as they turn the corner of the path, Ethel’s eyes snap away from the precarious path upwards with a gasp.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>In front, the narrow path has opened up suddenly to the shore of a great black lake, reflecting the bruising sky. And there, in the distance, perched high on the rock, is a vast castle it’s many turrets and towers standing proud at the high mountain summit, coloured flags dancing in the wind.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No more’n four to a boat!” Hagrid hollers and points towards a fleet of little boats sitting at the waters edge, lapping against the shore. Neville starts towards a boat quickly, biting his lip and Ethel follows behind him. He stops in front of a boat and shuffles a little to the side. Immediately, she sees his problem.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s okay, Neville,” She gives him a gentle nudge towards a boat with a ginger-haired boy, a girl with a dark explosion of frizzy curls and the smallest first year she’s seen yet, the frames of his glasses wrapped in sticky tape. “I’ll see you on the other side.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He swallows and nods and then darts off to the other boat.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ethel turns back to the boat in front of her with a sigh. They don’t look exactly like their movie counterparts, but it’s easy enough to guess who they are. An eye-searing bright head of perfectly coifed blonde hair and two slightly round, slack looking faces stare back at her. Even if she didn’t know the Story, she would have avoided them by atmosphere alone. Draco Malfoy, Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She steps onto the boat and sits down.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Malfoy eyes her for a moment and then turns his head away with a sniff.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Right then – “ Hagrid shouts, “FORWARD!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And the fleet of boats glide forwards at once, over the water, it’s surface smooth as glass. Everyone is quiet, looking up towards the great castle up ahead. It looms above them as they get closer and closer, nearer to the sheer cliff Hogwarts overlooks.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Heads down!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The boats slip under a curtain of ivy, tendrils brushing the tops of their heads, hiding a wide opening in the rock and a dark passage way under the mountain. Inside the tunnel, little floating lights like the train tunnel out of the Platform float overhead, like fireflies or distant stars. It’s colder down here too, without the last warmth of the sun to heat the cold rock.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Eventually, the water stops flowing and they reach what seemed to be some sort of underground dock, with lengths of rope wound around a metal hooked entrenched into the pebble beach of the shore. Ethel darts off to Neville’s side immediately, who looks just as relieved to see her as she is to see him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hi,” She says as she slips into pace with him. “You alright?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He nods, looking a little dazed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think I just met Harry P…P… Harry P-Potter.” His voice doesn’t go much higher than an awed whisper.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh.” She wonders which Harry Potter would prefer people to see him as – the character from a Story, or a legend made in flesh and blood.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They clamber up a path carved through the rock, this time lit by flaming torches, following Hagrid until they emerge in the damp grass right in the shadow of the Hogwarts castle itself. Stone steps lead up to the largest door Ethel has ever seen and a heavy brass knocker stares back at them, shaped as a dragon’s head.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Everyone alright?” Hagrid casts an eye over the group, lingering on a few panting faces and red cheeks.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And then he turns and knocks three times on the door.</span>
</p>
