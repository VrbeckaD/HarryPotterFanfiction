<hr/><p>There was one thing that Rose Weasley absolutely could not stand. Well, there were rather two things that drove Rose Weasley to unbounded mania, but mercifully, only one of these was her current cause for agitation.</p><p>"Shit," she muttered as she checked her watch again. "Shit, shit, shit."</p><p>She looked behind her, seeking out her parents in the crowd of commuters walking around Kings Cross Station.</p><p>"Mum! Dad!"</p><p>She looked at them in exasperation as Hermione Weasley refused to pass in front of the handicapped woman in front of her. Ron shrugged at his daughter weakly.</p><p>"And this is why Hugo arrives with the Potters," Rose complained as soon as they had caught up with her.</p><p>"Sorry, sweetheart," her mother apologised.</p><p>As soon as they made the familiar fall through the barrier, Rose exhaled. "Thank Merlin."</p><p>Ron checked his watch. "Hermione, we really should be going."</p><p>The brunette pursed her lips and looked at her daughter. "Our Rose, going into her last year of Hogwarts. Can you imagine, Ron?"</p><p>"No," he pointed out. "If you remember, Harry and I never did come back for our last year."</p><p>His wife tutted at him, and pulled Rose into a hug. "Write to us, dear."</p><p>"Don't I always?"</p><p>"And don't get another one of those...boyfriends," Ron said, shuddering. "We can't keep an eye on you when you're so far away."</p><p>"You and mum were technically together during seventh year," Rose reminded him, lifting her owl cage off her suitcase while Ron placed her trunk on the floor.</p><p>"<em>Technically</em>," Ron said, pointedly.</p><p>"You should go," Rose pressured, taking another look at the clock. "I can manage."</p><p>"Are you sure?"</p><p>She nodded, sighing deeply. Ron fastened his daughter into a hug. "No boys, Rosie. Promise."</p><p>She rolled her eyes and kissed his cheek.</p><p>After a final wave, her parents passed through the barrier and were gone.</p><p>Rose breathed in deeply, and looking down at her trunk realised perhaps she shouldn't've been so forthcoming in shooing away her parents. She looked quickly at her somewhat agitated tawny owl.</p><p>"Hang on there, Horus," she said, softly. "I'll let you out soon."</p><p>She sighed again, and braced herself to lift the huge chest to join the others. She'd gotten it to about shoulder height when she realised her efforts were futile, and her arms began to give way.</p><p>"Damn it," she cursed loudly as her body sagged under its weight.</p><p>Suddenly, the trunk was hoisted up above her head, and carried itself away into the baggage compartment.</p><p>Of course.</p><p>Her gaze followed it until it was secure, and she turned to thank her saviour.</p><p>"Thanks so much for your-Nate!"</p><p>Her ex-boyfriend of last year smiled warmly at her, and leaned in for a quick hug. "Still early, huh?"</p><p>She reddened, and nodded.</p><p>"How've you been, Rose? You look great, by the way."</p><p>She swiped some hair away from her face and smiled back. "You too. I've been pretty good, but I'm running late for the train."</p><p>Something appeared to have caught his attention. She followed his gaze down to her gleaming badge, emblazoned with the initials HG.</p><p>"You got Head Girl?" Nate beamed. "I knew it would be you, Rosie. Uh…Rose."</p><p>She blushed. "Thanks, Nate, it was a huge surprise when it arrived."</p><p>A lie; she wouldn't have worked her heart out everyday for the past six years, taken extra classes, joined the Slug Club (until it was disbanded upon the Professor's retirement), and taken meticulous notes during every single <em>excruciating</em> History of Magic lesson unless she knew that she would reap every bit of what she had sown.</p><p>"Don't be ridiculous, Rose," Nate chided her. "You knew you'd get it just as much as everyone else did."</p><p>She turned even redder, but shrugged. "Do you know who got Head Boy?"</p><p>She felt guilty the moment the words left her, noticing the lack of embellishments on his robes and remembering that Nate had probably been a strong contender for the title.</p><p>He, however, seemed unfazed by her faux pax. "I have no idea, sorry."</p><p>His gaze wandered to the monumental clock hanging behind Rose's shoulder. "We should probably get going. Which way are you headed?"</p><p>To accentuate his point, the whistle sounded, and all loiterers and fellow latecomers hurried to board.</p><p>Rose pointed to the back of the train where it had become customary for her, Al, and her best friend Genevieve to meet.</p><p>While Nate's face fell, it also betrayed slight relief. "I'm going up front."</p><p>She smiled at him. "It's alright. I'll see you at the Welcome Feast."</p><p>He nodded, waving. "Bye, Rose."</p><p>She watched him disappear, and then, shouldering her satchel and grabbing Horus' cage with the other hand, made her own way towards the back of the train.</p><p>She had just reached the door of the compartment when the Hogwarts Express began to chug forward.</p><p>"Merlin, Rose, and here you had us thinking you might not make it."</p><p>She grimaced at her cousin over the flash of brown hair that had accosted her the moment her foot had trespassed inside.</p><p>"Hi, Gen," she laughed, hugging her best friend tightly. "Missed you." She pulled back to scrutinise her. "You smell like Paris."</p><p>"It was amazing, Rose," Genevieve gushed, tugging her down onto the seat beside her. "The food, the weather, the <em>boys</em>." She fanned herself theatrically, and bent to feed Horus a treat. "Makes coming back here a bit underwhelming."</p><p>"Hey!" Al complained. "No need to be nasty."</p><p>Gen grinned widely, and propped her feet up beside him.</p><p>Rose, as promised, opened the door to Horus' cage and watched as he flew up to join Archimedes and Navajo on the baggage rack.</p><p>"Loving the badge," Gen added casually. "Do you know who got Head Boy?"</p><p>She shook her head. Now that Nate was out of the picture, she was really hoping it might be Luke Cresswell, a fellow Gryffindor, though she couldn't shake the uneasy feeling inside her stomach that it she wouldn't be so lucky.</p>
<hr/><p>At four o'clock, Rose hastily pushed herself up from her seat. She would make her way down to the Heads compartment while Al and Gen would stop two carriages short to join the other prefects. "We should go."</p><p>They left their things for when they would return and headed for compartments A and C, bringing only the wands that were stowed in their jacket pockets.</p><p>They didn't see many people as they travelled from the back of the train to the very front; most seemed to be keeping to their own compartments. As the three passed Compartment F, Rose caught sight of Olivia Roux, the prepossessing but trying seventh year Slytherin making her way back from wherever she was further up. Though Rose returned her shallow smile, her stomach sunk.</p><p>"See you later," she said somewhat sullenly to her friends as they reached the prefect's compartment. She waved at the people she recognised from inside.</p><p>"Good luck," Gen said, empathetically as the door shut behind her.</p><p>Rose pulled a face, and steeled herself.</p><p>
  <em>Please be Luke, please be Luke, please be Luke.</em>
</p><p>She passed Compartment B.</p><p>
  <em>It didn't even have to be Luke. It could be anybody, really. Just as long as it wasn't-</em>
</p><p>But there he was: the second thing that drove Rose Weasley into unbounded mania. Reading.</p><p>Figures.</p><p>Her lip curled with distaste at the sight of his feet propped up against the seat opposite him as he casually reclined, his mouth slightly pursed as his eyes skimmed the pages.</p><p>Abruptly, Rose realised there was nowhere she'd less rather be. Perhaps she could just go and join Al, Gen and the others in their compartment. <em>He must be late</em>, she would say, shrugging as she sat down. <em>I'm sure he'll come and find me in here, not to worry.</em></p><p>Maybe she could just back away before he'd even have time to-</p><p>"Well, well. Weasley."</p><p>Nevermind.</p><p>"I can see the summer didn't really do any good for you, then."</p><p>She smiled back wanly in response. "Malfoy, looking as albino as ever."</p><p>She opened the glass door, and stepped inside.</p><p>"Can't say I'm surprised, really," Scorpius drawled as she sat, avoiding his feet. "I suppose McGonagall had to pay you back somehow for your only friend being Madam Pince."</p><p>"Yes," Rose said, adopting a thoughtful expression. "I suppose she must be compensating for you being born a bloodless, lousy git."</p><p>"I'm breaking on the inside," Scorpius said, scornfully, and returned to his book.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Rose could tell that neither was enjoying their predicament, but she couldn't give him the satisfaction of her leaving. Since this was at least the tenth time Scorpius' eyes had flickered to the door, he evidently felt the same way.</p><p>"Did Olivia leave from here?"</p><p>He slowly raised his eyes to meet hers. "What's it to you?"</p><p>"Nothing," Rose said, shortly. "I was only wondering."</p><p>"Well, don't."</p><p>She inadvertently got to her feet, much to the Head Boy's surprise.</p><p>"I'm…uh, going," Rose said, bluntly, trying to make it seem as if she had consciously decided to leave. "Going to check on the prefects, and whatnot."</p><p>"Grand idea."</p><p>To her intense displeasure, he stood too, and pushed past her out of the compartment. She huffed and shoved him back, called him an oaf - to which he scoffed at - and followed behind.</p><p>"Afternoon," he said, pulling open the door. "Scorpius Malfoy, Head Boy."</p><p>"Rose Weasley," Rose interjected as he re-opened his mouth to undoubtedly undermine her. "Head Girl."</p><p>She scoped out Al and Gen, and sat in between them.</p><p>"Bad luck, sweetie," Gen whispered, subtly patting her on the leg.</p><p>Rose only shook her head exasperatedly at her, and turned to address the room.</p><p>"Hi, everyone. This is a pretty informal meeting, and you don't have to stay here after this talk if you don't want to, but we just wanted everyone to get acquainted - or reacquainted - before the official start of term."</p><p>Scorpius cleared his throat from where he was sitting by Tobias Nott, and leaned back. "We'll be hosting the first official meeting on Tuesday night at eight in the usual Transfiguration classroom where we'll sort out patrols and responsibilities and all that other mandatory stuff."</p><p>The two exchanged a cool glance.</p><p>"Right, that's it," Rose said, standing. "You can all go back to your compartments now, even if it is nicer in here."</p><p>There was a perfunctory round of laughter, though some people remained seated.</p><p>Rose gestured for her friends to leave with her, and they headed back to their compartment.</p><p>"That's rough, Rose," Al said, as they sat down. "But, I mean, he was the obvious choice, right? You can't say you were surprised."</p><p>Rose had neglected to outright mention her distress of Scorpius Malfoy being made Head Boy; she had juvenilely tabooed the subject, hoping that if she never voiced her unease aloud, she might avoid it.</p><p>Her approach evidently left something to be desired.</p><p>"I suppose."</p><p>"Cheer up," Gen consoled her. "You'll barely have to see him - so what's a few Heads meetings here and there?"</p><p>Her friends had a point. Scorpius Malfoy was not going to ruin her last year at Hogwarts, she would try her damnedest to make that true if it was the last thing she did.</p><p>She summoned a smile to her face. "Anyone up for a game of Exploding Snap?"</p>
<hr/><p>"Well handled," Tobias congratulated Scorpius as they returned to their compartment.</p><p>"What was?"</p><p>"You know, your first line of duty with Rose. No bloodshed - that's promising, right?"</p><p>Scorpius grunted in response. For the sake of his friend, Toby withheld his snigger. He waited patiently; it only took about thirty seconds before-</p><p>"I can't bloody believe that-"</p><p>Scorpius's impending rant was cut short as the compartment door was slid open.</p><p>"Oh, good," Olivia said, stepping in lightly and leaving the door open behind her. "Your meeting's over."</p><p>She planted herself in Scorpius' lap, pushing aside his book, and kissed him deeply. Scorpius stifled a smirk as Tobias mimed slitting his wrist behind her.</p><p>"Liv," he said, not unkindly. "What're you doing back here?"</p><p>She shrugged, and folded her hands across his chest. "Thought I might say hi. Again. Nice summer, Toby?"</p><p>"It was alright, Liv. Yours?"</p><p>Instead of addressing him, she turned back to Scorpius, playing with his loosened tie. "It would've been better if I'd've gotten to spend it with my boyfriend."</p><p>Both Scorpius and Tobias decided not to remind her that her "boyfriend" had ended the last year in Claudia Bouchard's bed. That aside, Scorpius dreaded to think how many beds Liv had dragged herself out of over the past two months.</p><p>She continued to mother him, running her hands through his hair and adjusting his badge. Opposite them, Toby slipped out, muttering something about grabbing some Pasties from the trolley.</p><p>"That reminds me," she said absentmindedly, still eyeing his breast pin. "Who got Head Girl?"</p><p>"Who do you think."</p><p>She sighed, and flopped onto the seat next to him. "Really, Scorpius, if you put as much effort into our relationship as you do hating her, we'd be married with children and a bloody puppy." She rolled her eyes as he glared at her. "It's time to get over this stupid family feud," she continued, adjusting her blouse. "I'm frankly getting sick of all the complaining. You know some people think you two are actually in some sort of torrid affair?"</p><p>"It's not a family feud, Liv. You know that's not it." He shuddered. "Do people actually think that?"</p><p>She made a face and nodded. "There's only so much you can despise someone for being your biggest competition, you know."</p><p>"It's not that, Liv," Scorpius repeated emphatically. "It's….mutually conflicting values."</p><p>"Whatever," she waved a hand in disinterest. "Let's talk about something else."</p>
<hr/><p><em>Three Pumpkin Pasties, four packets of Droobles</em>, Toby muttered to himself as he left the compartment for the Honeydukes Express. <em>Three Pasties, four Droobles</em>.</p><p>As he passed Compartment K, the sound of his friend's name caught his attention. He paused.</p><p>"…sounds like a recipe for disaster, if you ask me," came a vaguely familiar voice from inside. "Rose Weasley and Scorpius Malfoy as our two Heads?" She <em>psh</em>ed loudly.</p><p>"I thought they're both smart though, right?" came a far more subdued voice. "Isn't that the point?"</p><p>The first girl - by the name of Jessamine, Toby thought - continued to speak loftily. "You think they're going to get any work done with all that bickering?"</p><p>A third voice now joined the others. "Maybe they're over it?"</p><p>"You don't get over a six year feud just like that, Sarah. Hell, it probably goes back to their grandparents, too."</p><p>Toby rolled his eyes; family had very little to do with it. True, when they had first arrived at Hogwarts six years ago, in their minds, family had everything to do with it. The minute the flames from Scorpius' haywire <em>Incendio</em> spell had latched themselves upon Rose Weasley's person, he had ignited something far worse than her brand new shoes. She had responded with gusto, and with an unprecedented knack for Charms, Scorpius had wound up in the Hospital Wing during his first ever Hogwarts class.</p><p>Unfortunately, even after Rose had fully considered the fact that perhaps that First Year Incident might've been an accident, by then something else had taken over, something far stronger: complete and utter incompatibility.</p><p>Toby resumed walking and reached the trolley.</p><p>He supposed that when two people found new things to fight about almost daily for six years, their initial reason for disliking each other became more or less inconsequential. At least on Scorpius' side, realising that he was not top of the class in every single subject was not something he took to lightly, but try as he might, there was no one with as much of a natural flair for Charms as Rose Weasley. Worse, Professor Flitwick held the same view.</p><p>Tobias gave the friendly witch his order, and paid for his treats.</p><p>While she could probably beat out Scorpius Malfoy in a Charms contest blindfolded, Rose Weasley - nor anyone else - couldn't hold a candle to his friend once they entered the Potions lab, a fact that he imagined she never taken well either.</p><p>And so the endless game of one-upmanship began, so much so that it quickly escalated out of the classroom.</p><p>Toby raked a hand through his hair at the thought of the stress of the new year, and re-entered his compartment. He stifled a groan when he saw that Liv had not yet left.</p><p>"Pasty?" he asked, lobbing one to his friend. "What'd I miss?"</p>
<hr/><p>"<em>Al</em>."</p><p>Albus paused the drumming of his fists to look at his cousin. "What?"</p><p>"Stop."</p><p>He huffed. "Fine."</p><p>Ten seconds later, it began again.</p><p>"Honestly," Gen hissed violently, grabbing his arm. "I'll rip it off, Albus."</p><p>"<em>I need food</em>. I might faint."</p><p>Rose ignored Al's petulant whining and listened attentively as McGonagall introduced Philippa Mountbatten, the new Arithmancy professor. There was scattered applause when she briefly stood.</p><p>"<em>I want food, I need food</em>." Al continued his mantra despite Rose's elbow in his ribs.</p><p>McGonagall cast her gaze between the Gryffindor and Slytherin tables. "And finally-"</p><p>"<em>Yes</em>," Al hissed.</p><p>"-I should take a moment to introduce this year's Head Girl and Boy: Rose Weasley from Gryffindor-" Rose was pushed to her feet admist enthusiastic applause, along with some wolf whistling from Albus and Louis (and one male Gryffindor who bellowed "Whoo! Go Rose!" before being smacked by his girlfriend beside him), "-and Scorpius Malfoy from Slytherin." There was a second round of rather raucous applause as Scorpius surfaced.</p><p>McGonagall flicked her wrist, and there seemed to be a collective sigh heaved throughout the entire hall. "With that, let us enjoy this marvelous feast!"</p><p>Albus the Locust stood up, plate in hand, and swept down the entire length of the table, grabbing everything at arm's length.</p><p>Rose shook her head, and proceeded to pile her own plate.</p><p>"Last ever Start-of-Term Feast," Gen said, sadly, as she bit into a forkful of roast potatoes. "Last ever year of free food."</p><p>"Glad to know you have your priorities straight," Rose said, dryly. Gen was right, though, she thought rather sentimentally. It <em>was</em> their last ever Welcome Feast.</p><p>"What? Never underestimate the pleasure of free food, my friend, I say, ne—you can't expect to finish that, Albus."</p><p>"Watch me," the pile of food replied, setting down its plate with a thump. Al let out a dramatic moan as he inhaled his first mouthful. "Better than sex, I swear."</p><p>"Speaking of-"</p><p>The three friends turned to face Lydia Price - well, Albus attempted to locate the voice over the mountain on his plate - the fellow Gryffindor who had spoken.</p><p>"Did you and Nate have a good summer, Rose?"</p><p>Rose frowned at the crude transition. "We're not together anymore."</p><p>Lydia's eyes bugged out. "You—you two broke up?"</p><p>"Yep," Rose affirmed noncommittally, going back to her food.</p><p>"So." She sighed as Lydia's equally as taxing friend leaned over conspiratorially. "He's back on the market, then?"</p><p>"I suppose so."</p><p>Selene peered over at the Slytherin table. "But Scorpius and Liv are still together."</p><p>"What's Malfoy got to do with this?" Gen asked in annoyance.</p><p>The two girls shared a look.</p><p>"Well…" Both looked extremely uncomfortable. "We just um-" Lydia had decided to brave the waters. "We thought that since you and Nate are over, you would be free to be with Scorpius."</p><p>Rose shot the both of them a withering look. "And why," she said, waspishly. "Would that be the case?"</p><p>At Rose's deadly tone, the two girls remained tight lipped.</p><p>"Speak."</p><p>Selene pursed her lips. "Well, there's a rumour that you two are shagging in the Room of Requirement."</p><p>"Well," Rose said, loftily, going back to her meal. "I suggest you pay a little less attention to hearsay."</p><p>That abruptly ended the conversation.</p><p>"Ahh," Al said, patting his stomach contentedly. "Who doesn't love a good Welcome Feast, eh?"</p>
<hr/><p>"I swear," Al said, panting. "This trek gets longer and longer each year."</p><p>Rose and Gen exchanged an amused look.</p><p>"Perhaps if you hadn't eaten your entire body weight in Yorkshire puddings, you'd find this easier," Rose said, patting him on the shoulder.</p><p>"Really, Al," Gen said, with much less sympathy. "Pride of the Quidditch team, you are. I'll remember this the next time you force your team to run laps at seven in the morning."</p><p>"Your boyfriend still not over that?"</p><p>"My <em>ex-</em>boyfriend didn't appreciate the six-thirty wake up calls."</p><p>"Your ex-boyfriend was a lazy sod."</p><p>"He's half right," Rose admitted, pulling a face.</p><p>Al snorted in agreement and then shot Gen a dirty look. "And by the way, I am, <em>in fact</em>, pride of the Quidditch team, Genevieve, as you very well know from my-"</p><p>"Made it!" Rose announced, as they came face to face with the Fat Lady's portrait. "Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo."</p><p>"I still can't believe you overruled with that," Gen said, shaking her head as the door swung open.</p><p>"She's wanted to do that since first year," Al said, happily, throwing an arm around his cousin. "Oh, how far we've come."</p><p>Rose shook her head, laughing, and led the way inside.</p>
<hr/><p>"I do wonder how you're still upright," Scorpius commented as Toby marched purposefully towards the Slytherin Common Room. "Given that you ate nearly three times the amount I did."</p><p>"I live to amaze." Toby turned to inspect his friend critically and tutted. "You really ought to get some meat on that bony frame of yours. You look as if you could break into pieces at any moment."</p><p>Scorpius chortled at the pathetic jibe.</p><p>"Don't be jealous, Toby," Liv scolded, sidling up and pressing a hand to Scorpius' bicep. "I'm sure with enough Quidditch sessions, your muscle mass could overtake your fat easily."</p><p>Scorpius barked out a laugh as Tobias muttered rudely under his breath, and, feeling a renewed sense of unity between him and the girl latched onto him, took her hand and interweaved it with his own.</p><p>"So you're free tonight, Scorp? No Heads duties or anything?"</p><p>He shook his head. "Not yet. We have a meeting with McGonagall tomorrow before dinner. She'll probably debrief us then."</p><p>"That'll be a ball," Liv said in a bored voice, before she gave the password and a passageway appeared.</p><p>Scorpius scoffed; knowing Weasley, it'd be a bloodbath.</p>
<hr/><p>"Late."</p><p>Scorpius skidded to a stop and paused to run a hand through his hair. "Some of us have lives to live, Weasley."</p><p>"Couldn't drag yourself out of Olivia's bed, huh?"</p><p>"Well," Scorpius replied, smirking. "Given where her mouth was, dragging myself away wasn't really an option."</p><p>"Thanks for that stirring image," Rose said flatly.</p><p>"I thought living vicariously through me might help you survive through your depressingly mundane lifestyle."</p><p>"Why, you <em>do</em> care."</p><p>Scorpius glanced at his watch. 8:02. Ridiculous. "Why didn't you go up?"</p><p>Rose shrugged, keeping her eyes on the gargoyle. "Thought we should present a united front."</p><p>"How sweet."</p><p>"Sod off."</p><p>Apparently roused by Scorpius' arrival, the statue blinked sleepily and moved out of the way to let them pass.</p><p>The two proceeded in silence up the steps, both avoiding walking beside each other but each vying to gain the lead.</p><p>"Ah," McGonagall said, looking up as they entered. "My apologies for keeping you waiting; I had a rather urgent letter from the Board to attend to."</p><p>Scorpius shot an almost infinitesimal smirk in Rose's direction. She ignored him.</p><p>"Have a seat."</p><p>The two Heads both tried to hide their distaste at the close proximity of the chairs; Scorpius pursed his lips but resisted shuffling away.</p><p>"First off, I should offer you my felicitations in person for your appointments as Head Boy and Girl. A surprise, naturally." Her eyes crinkled slightly behind her spectacles.</p><p>The two cracked small smiles.</p><p>"As previously appointed prefects, I'm sure the both of you realise your crucial responsibilities as Heads; not only do you undertake new and elevated duties, you also serve as the highest role models for the rest of the school to emulate."</p><p>Rose coughed.</p><p>"Your Head title also puts you in an extremely favourable position as you decide and apply for careers following your graduation from Hogwarts." She studied them carefully. "As top students, I have no doubt you'll be aiming high. Remember, your position as Heads still does not guarantee you the best schools in your further education - you must work much harder this year than in years previous. Very importantly-" Her eyes settled on Rose's sidelong glance at Scorpius' arm resting dangerously close to hers. "<em>Limit your distractions."</em></p><p>Scorpius shifted his arm; Rose cleared her throat.</p><p>"Now, I trust you've both read the précis of your duties this year? Good." She tented her hands, interlacing her fingers. "Your first meeting is tomorrow, yes?"</p><p>"Eight o'clock," Rose affirmed.</p><p>McGonagall nodded in approval. "That is all I wished to cover. Biscuit?"</p><p>Both students politely declined.</p><p>"Well, then. Good night, Ms Weasley, Mr Malfoy."</p><p>"Goodnight, Professor," they replied in unison.</p><p>Scorpius waited for Rose to exit before following her down the stairs.</p><p>Given that continuing to walk behind her for the entirety of the corridor seemed awkward and mulish, Scorpius hastened to catch up to the redhead.</p><p>"Any plans with dear Nathaniel?" He flicked his eyes towards hers, and noticed that she looked incredibly deep in thought. "Weasley?"</p><p>She snapped to. "What?"</p><p>He sighed. "You and Braeden."</p><p>She glared at him, and didn't answer.</p><p>"Is it <em>that</em> scandalous? He the closet kinky type or something?"</p><p>She pressed her lips tightly together, and sped up.</p><p>"The fuck is up with you?"</p><p>She only issued him another scathing glare.</p><p>"Oh." Scorpius smacked a hand to his forehead, feigning a revelation. "<em>You're</em> the closet kinky type."</p><p>"Go bother Liv, Malfoy," she said acidly before she turned the corner and disappeared.</p><p>Scorpius only stared.</p>
<hr/><p>Rose continued to walk up the steps, still mulling over McGonagall's words. She knew her title as Head Girl was as much a responsibility as an imprimatur, but the Headmistress' words seemed to make it that much more concrete.</p><p>Her next thought almost stopped her in horror: how was she to live up to McGonagall's expectations of her when her co-head happened to be her - and she knew the word was juvenile, but it was the only one that sprang to mind - arch-nemesis?</p><p>She wondered if it was possible to strip one of the Head title, though she'd never heard of it happening before. Perhaps McGonagall would walk in on the two of them having their usual flare up in the corridor, notice the mortified looks of young students around them, and demote them both there and then.</p><p>She clutched her books tighter and promptly turned back the way she came.</p><p>Before she could further unhinge herself, she looked up, distracted, at the sound of approaching feet coming from behind her.</p><p>"Al!" she said in surprise, as her cousin turned the corner, his broom hefted over his shoulder.</p><p>He raised a hand in greeting. "How was the meeting with McGonagall?"</p><p>Rose sighed. "Eye opening."</p><p>Al chuckled. "Were you heading back to the Common Room?"</p><p>Rose shook her head and inclined it in the opposite direction. "I was heading that way, actually."</p><p>Al raised an eyebrow. "You're not heading to the library already, are you?"</p><p>Rose shrugged. "We have McGonagall's assignment to do. You really should be doing it as well."</p><p>"Oh, come on, Rosie. You've already got Head Girl; for the first time in six years, you can relax!"</p><p>She looked scandalised by the suggestion. "Head Girl is only the first step, Al. There's the rest of my life, remember?"</p><p>He shook his head in defeat. "You do you, Rose. You do you."</p><p>She pointed to his Velox 3000. "<em>You're</em> practicing for Quidditch already."</p><p>"Yeah." Al looked baffled. "Because Quidditch is <em>fun</em>."</p><p>"Well, I think studying can be fun." She winced at her obvious lie, and decided to backtrack by literally backtracking down the corridor. "Well, Al, this is been great, but I've got stuff to do."</p><p>Al snickered at his cousin's antics, and continued his walk down to the Quidditch pitch. "See you later, Rosie."</p><p>"Bye, Al."</p><p>Before Rose entered the library, she had a gratifying thought: perhaps McGonagall would be prudent enough to dispose of only one of her Heads, obviously the more inferior.</p><p><em>Limit your distractions</em>.</p><p>Her mind suddenly swung back to the train, and then the dinner a few hours earlier. A slow smile worked its way onto her face.</p><p>Olivia Roux made for a fascinating distraction.</p>
