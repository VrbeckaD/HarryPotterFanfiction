    <p align="center">Albus Dumbledore</p><p> </p><p>Dumbledore sat back in his seat, staring out of his office window as he absentmindedly stroked Fawkes’ firey plumage.  He had only recently returned to Hogwarts officially as Headmaster after being on the run from the Ministry, not to mention dealing with the potential disaster at the Department of Mysteries.  Being gone from Hogwarts for so long and having to leave that horrid woman in charge, Dumbledore found that he had a lot of fires that needed to be put out.</p><p>Temporarily running the Order from his office, Dumbledore had jumped in and started rebuilding everything that Umbridge set out to destroy.  Despite all the issues she brought with her to Hogwarts, Dumbledore felt a twinge of sympathy for the witch.  They had found her after the end of school term deep within the Forbidden Forest in a bad state; although the fact that she was still alive was a testament to the centaurs she attacked.  He’d made it a priority to check her status in St. Mungos if only to ensure he could fire her when she awoke.  Even though he desperately needed a full teaching staff for the upcoming year he didn’t want Umbridge anywhere near his school or students.</p><p>Fawkes suddenly trilled beautifully sending waves of comfort and energy through him and snapping him out of his meditative state. </p><p>“Sorry old friend.”  Dumbledore chuckled before returning to the massive amount of parchment stacked unceremoniously on his desk.  He had only just picked up a letter recently sent from Lady Bones when his fireplace roared to life, displaying a floating green head.</p><p>“Albus?”</p><p>Abandoning his work for the second time today, Albus walked over to his fireplace to see the magical outline of an old friend. </p><p>“Griselda?  I wasn’t expecting to see you for another fortnight.” </p><p>The floating head pursed her cracked lips in displeasure.  “This is not a personal call, Albus, but a related business matter.  Can I come through?”</p><p>Seeing her serious expression, Dumbledore gave his consent and headed back to his desk as his guest travelled through the Floo Network.  By the time he’d returned to his desk, a frail witch with long grey hair and sharp blue eyes stepped out of his fireplace, supporting herself on a gnarled cane with one hand and carrying a stack of parchment under the other.</p><p>“Greetings, Albus.”  She said stiffly moving forward and taking the only seat before his desk.  Watching Griselda sort out her mass of parchment, Albus had been reminded why he’d always admired the older woman.  Griselda Marchbanks always carried herself with an air of confidence and strength that contradicted her small size; from experience he knew it was a bad idea to anger Madam Marchbanks.  In fact, she was the one who had marked his N.E.W.T examinations when he was preparing to graduate and her strict demeanour hadn’t diminished with age.</p><p>“Greetings, Griselda.  So are you here as Madam Marchbanks for the Wizarding Examinations Authority or Governor Marchbanks of the School Board?”  Dumbledore inquired folding his hands innocently on top of his desk.</p><p>“Both actually.”  Griselda snorted catching Albus’ attention immediately.  He had a meeting with the School Board only days ago and he shouldn’t have any business with the Wizarding Examinations Authority so soon after the school year.  Something had clearly gone wrong in the last couple of days.</p><p>“I’m here to talk about why the Boy-Who-Lived has been teaching Defence against the Dark Arts this past year.”</p><p>Dumbledore nodded his understanding as his agile mind pieced together Griselda’s concern before she had properly even asked her question.</p><p>“As you are well aware, Albus, my office runs and marks students in O.W.L and N.E.W.T examinations.  After completing our grading of Hogwarts' O.W.L students, Professor Tofty and I discovered numerous exams that listed their Professor as one - Harry James Potter.  Considering all students complete their examinations with quills bewitched with powerful anti-cheating spells, this has certainly grabbed my attention for all the wrong reasons.”</p><p>“I’m certain it would have been a surprise.”  Albus agreed reaching over a taking a sherbet lemon from the bowl on his desk and popping it into his mouth.</p><p>After a moment of silence than hung in the air, Griselda's eyes grew sharp and her aged features morhed into a frown.  “Well, Albus?  I'd like a proper explanation for this.  As far as I was aware you only had one Defence Professor on staff and they certainly weren’t a student.  Seeing the trend developing I investigated a hunch and discovered that Mr Potter’s name has been tracked to over twenty students.”</p><p>Knowing that Griselda wouldn’t stop until she got the answers she wanted, Albus launched into an account of Umbridge refusing to teach anything but basic theory and Harry’s creation of Dumbledore’s Army.</p><p>“So this fifteen year old student started teaching his fellow students?  Without any teacher’s approval?  Aside from the fact he is the Boy-Who-Lived, and applauding his initiative for dealing with the Umbridge problem, how did he think he could successfully teach defensive magic to seventh year students?”</p><p>Albus chuckled at his friend’s question, only to earn himself a warning glare in response.  Not wanting to push her buttons, he swiftly gave in.  “Harry is not an arrogant teen, Griselda, he was encouraged by his friends to help them study and it evolved into what they called Dumbledore’s Army; he just wanted to help his fellow students because, as you must admit, Dolores was an horrid teacher.  But in regards to his skill, from the moment Harry has started at Hogwarts, he has shown tremendous skill in Defensive Magic.”  He knew that he had captured her attention when her scowl melted away and she rose a thin quizzical eyebrow.</p><p>“Indeed, Albus?  Pray tell what he has done.”</p><p>Regardless of her sarcastic tone he knew that she was interested.  “In his first year Harry stunned a mountain troll that had been roaming the school, in his second year he discovered the Chamber of Secrets after which he defeated a basilisk with a sword, and in his third year he mastered the Patronus Charm to later successfully fight off a swarm of Dementors that the Ministry had placed around the grounds.”</p><p>Unable to help himself Albus smirked as Griselda whipped out a quill and a spare piece of parchment from her plain black robes and began jotting down notes.  Obviously displeased that he had stopped talking, Griselda waved her non-writing hand for him to continue without bothering to look up.</p><p>“What of his forth year, Albus?  Discounting the Triwizard Tournament of course as I am already completely aware of what transpired there.”</p><p>“Well…I suppose the most interesting thing from his fourth year was that…Harry had proven that he could completely throw off the Imperius Curse.”  Albus revealed casually to a stunned governor whilst selecting a second sherbet lemon.  He could understand her reaction as nobody had been able to fight off the curse in recorded history, fight back was possible for strong willed wizards and witches but completely throwing it off was something else entirely.  Just as the Killing Curse had been thought to be unblockable, many in the Wizarding World thought of the Imperius Curse as unbeatable; that it leaves its victim completely powerless against their attackers will. </p><p>“H-he can throw it off completely?”  She gasped as the quill in her hand darted across her parchment.  </p><p>Albus just nodded as he savoured his muggle sweet.  Feeling that they had talked enough about Harry without the young man being present, Albus shifted the conversation away from being solely about the Gryffindor.</p><p>“I must admit that I am curious how Harry’s students did.”  Albus enquired leaning forward on his desk. </p><p>Griselda paused only briefly in her note-taking to let out a snort before continuing.  “From the students in O.W.L that Mr Potter taught all fifteen received an Outstanding for their practical work, helped along with all being able to produce corporeal patronus’, and for written they all received Exceeds Expectations except for Mr Potter, Miss Granger, Mr Weasley and Mr Goldstein who received Outstandings.”</p><p>While he had hoped that the students Harry had been tutoring would’ve been educationally strengthened thanks to him, as he knew they wouldn’t have learnt anything from Umbridge, to achieve what they did was a little surprising; especially Mr Weasley who’d never received an Outstanding for theory work.</p><p>“Do you have Mr Potter’s class roster with you, Albus?  I would like to investigate more into his role of Hogwarts’ Defence results.”  The elderly witch explained pocketing her writing implements and parchment, clearly done for the moment taking notes.</p><p>He repositioned his half-moon spectacles on his nose as he silently summoned the D.A roster from the massive pile on his desk with a flick of his wrist.  Without giving it much thought he handed it over to Griselda.  “I believe Harry taught Mr Dennis Creevy from third year, Mr Zacharias Smith, Mr Colin Creevy, Miss Ginny Weasley and Miss Luna Lovegood from fourth year.  Then he had fourteen O.W.L students and four N.E.W.T students as listed.  Although it is possible there are more students.”</p><p>Albus let Griselda inspect the D.A roster and continually check back and forth between some of her gathered notes, until he noticed that she seemed to be operating as though he wasn’t in the room anymore.</p><p>“Griselda, I wouldn’t suppose you have the Hogwarts Records for this year O.W.L and N.E.W.T examinations?”  Albus said clearing his throat hoping to get her attention.</p><p>“Hmmm…What?...Oh yes, Albus.”  Griselda replied distractingly as she gave him a scroll bound together by a purple ribbon.</p><p>Knowing Griselda would keep making notes that would make any Ravenclaw proud, Albus opened the scroll and reviewed the recent Hogwarts results.</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">

</p><p align="center"> </p><p><em><br/></em>Dumbledore groaned reading Severus’ results, knowing that it would put them both in a very bad place.  They had received an official warning from the Magical Educational Department last year about Severus’ teaching and Albus had to help smooth everything over; there were nearly a hundred complaints lodged from students, parents and even fellow faculty about his teaching style and attitude.  Unfortunately, it looked like everything was coming back around and it wasn’t good.</p><p>“Severus received another Acceptable?”  He asked looking up in time for a displeased Griselda to roll her eyes at him. </p><p>“Please…that was a pity Acceptable.  I told you years ago, Albus, that the teachers you are hiring are pathetic; you promoted that snivelling Quirrell from Muggle Studies to Defence, for Merlin knows what reason, then there was the egotistical idiot Lockhart, the fake Trelawney, the dull Binns – should I even continue?  Snape is just another example.  He maybe a brilliant potioneer but if he can’t teach what is the point of having him as a professor?  He does <em>not </em>belong in the classroom.  You need someone teaching <em>every </em>subject who are experts in their fields and can successfully teach.”</p><p>“But Severus assists by…”  Dumbledore started to weakly explain before Griselda intercepted. </p><p>“I know that he helps with your blasted Order but need I remind you that this is a school?  If you want your pet snake around that is your business, but the man isn’t a teacher and shouldn’t be employed as one.  Now, as we speak about this every year and my department is sick of cleaning up after certain teachers, I have a plan to help us both.”</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <em>*/*</em>
</p><p align="center"><em> <br/></em>Harry J Potter</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Throughout his life Harry Potter has been known as many things, the Boy-Who-Lived, the youngest seeker in Hogwarts’ history and even briefly as the Heir of Slytherin.  However, it was the role of butler and servant he was most used to.  From as early back as he can remember he’d been scrubbing his relative's floors, cooking, general cleaning, looking after the garden and whatever else his relatives could think up.  Today was no different.</p><p>Before his Aunt, Uncle and cousin had left for the day, they had given him a list of chores to complete.  Unfortunately as they were only expected to be gone for a couple of hours at most, Harry would need a team of cleaners to help if he wanted to have everything done in time.  Even though Harry was nearly a sixteen year old wizard and could do the lot with a flick of his wand, he couldn’t use magic outside of school until he turned seventeen. </p><p>Trying to keep his spirits up, Harry started gathering and cutting up the ingredients he would need to make the Dursleys requested dinner of roasted chicken and vegetables paired with steamed greens.  After he had put everything in the oven to cook, he would be able to race around the house and complete as much from his chore list as possible.  He had just finished dicing his first potato when a polite knock on the Dursleys’ front door made him freeze in panic.</p><p>The general rule he learnt from a very early age was that he was <em>never </em>to get the door himself, and if he ever did he wouldn’t be fed as punishment.  As the person standing on the Dursley’s stoop continued their persistent knocking, Harry swore under his breath and headed to the front door.  With the person knocking so loudly he knew that they’d probably annoy their fussy neighbour, who would end up getting him in a lot of trouble anyway; at least this way he stopped the incessant knocking so he could continue his work in peace.</p><p>Plastering a fake smile on his face Harry swung open the door to reveal an irritated Professor McGonagall wearing a plain dark green dress with a black cloak draped over her shoulders.  Harry wasn’t sure why her left eye was twitching, but it reminded him of the look she gave Ron when he blew up his desk last year instead of transfiguring his book into a swan.</p><p>“Good morning, Potter.  Could you quickly invite me inside so we can speak?  I can’t stand being gawked at for another second longer.”</p><p>Following his Professors orders, Harry swiftly invited the Transfiguration teacher inside.  After she passed him and headed into the lounge room, he stuck his head outside and grinned seeing Mr Matthews across the street staring completely gobsmacked at him.  While his Aunt maybe the queen of being nosey, she was far from the only one who thrived on it.</p><p>Unable to stop himself, and knowing that he would probably regret it later, Harry waved cheekily to the elderly muggle before closing the door and following McGonagall’s steps inside. </p><p>When Harry walked in he snorted seeing the disgusted expression on McGonagall’s face as her green eyes darted from the Dursleys’ extremely floral décor, to the vomit colored curtains before landing on the coffee table that had an assortment of puppies engraved into its wooden legs.</p><p>Deciding to break the ice first Harry jumped in.  “Not that I’m not glad to see you, Professor, but what can I do for you during the holiday break?  Is something wrong at the Order?”</p><p>“Calm yourself, Mr Potter, the Order is fine as far as I know.  I am here on Professor Dumbledore’s behalf and that of Hogwarts.”  Minerva said removing her wand with a flourish and conjuring a plush maroon seat for herself.</p><p>Harry frowned as McGonagall made herself comfortable.  ‘If McGonagall thought that would clear things up for me, she clearly overestimates my intelligence.’</p><p>“Mr Potter…Harry….as you know the Defence against the Dark Arts post at Hogwarts has been held by some poor choices in the past, with the only exception being Professor Lupin.  Finally Professor Dumbledore has made plans to fix this and appoint our first proper and permanent Defence Professor in nearly twenty years.”</p><p>While he was still a bit confused as to why this information constituted a visit, especially to him, he couldn’t deny that he liked what he was hearing; the only good Defence teacher he had ever known was Remus, but because of the small-minded idiots of the Wizarding world, he couldn’t teach as a werewolf.</p><p>“That’s great, Professor.”  Harry said with a smile taking a seat opposite her.  “It’ll be good to have a proper teacher with Voldemort being back.”</p><p>While many would flinch at the sound of the Dark Lord’s name, Harry was pleased that her only reaction was to nod in agreement. </p><p>“I completely agree with you, Harry, and please call me Minerva when you aren’t my student and we are outside of Hogwarts.”  She requested offering him a rare smile.</p><p>“Okay…M-Minerva.”  Harry replied feeling an odd mix between excitement for using a teacher’s name and being uncomfortable for the same reason.  “So did Professor Dumbledore hire an auror or perhaps someone from the Order to be the Defence against the Dark Arts professor?”</p><p>“Not exactly, Harry.  Professor Dumbledore wants to hire <em>you</em> as the Defence against the Dark Arts teacher.”</p><p>Despite being sent a proud look from the usually stoic Minerva, Harry was feeling a different emotion.</p><p>“W-what was that Pro-Minerva?”  He stuttered slowly standing up.</p><p>Seeing Harry’s reaction Minerva’s smile faded a bit and she sighed.  “I know it’s a lot to take in but there is logic behind the decision.  Besides, I believe you’ll make a truly great Defence professor.”</p><p>Harry snorted before collapsing back into his chair feeling like he’d been struck by the Whomping Willow.  “Professor, perhaps you can help me out here.  What is the logic behind getting a <em>student</em> to teach such an important subject?  I’ve only just finished my O.W.Ls and you want me to teach?  How will the parents feel about having me teach?  And isn’t there a Board of Governors or something?”</p><p>Minerva rose an eyebrow as Harry’s bombardment of questions ebbed and even waited for him to calm a bit before answering.</p><p>“There is no doubt that you have yet to graduate from Hogwarts, that should be exceptionally obvious, but I believe you shall do a great job.  For your question about the Board of Governors, yes there is one that has certain powers at the school, but they won’t fight your placement as it was largely their idea.  It seems that the students you’ve been unofficially teaching received exceptionally great results, even being able to perform the highly complicated patronus charm for their examiners.” </p><p>Harry blushed at the impressed tone in Minerva’s voice.  He knew it was considered a difficult spell and most wizards and witches couldn’t perform it, but he was just teaching a combination of what Lupin taught him and his own experience.  Nothing special.</p><p>“Aside from the fact that you’ve proven that you can teach…”  Minerva continued smirking at the blush that lit Harry's face aflame.  “…you have the practical experience as well; I know you’ve gone up against Voldemort more than once, you’ve fought acromantulas, a basilisk, multiple dementors and fought in the Triwizard Tournament.  Certainly more than what certain past professors, and even some aurors can claim.”</p><p>Feeling his face starting to get incredibly red, Harry ran his hands through his hair.  This unexpected conversation was starting to sound like the one he had with Hermione and Ron when they first suggested the D.A and him teaching them.  At first he was incredibly nervous having to teach his friends and fellow students but in the end he actually quite enjoyed it. With so many horrible things happening that year, the D.A was one of the things that got him through.</p><p>“They really did that well?”  He asked hoping that Minerva wasn't kidding and that his friends were able to get some good marks.</p><p>Minerva smiled obviously pleased with his question.  Rather than respond straight away she once again used her wand, but this time to conjure a teapot and a dainty china cup with a roaring lion emblazed upon it's side.  Harry squirmed as Minerva prepared herself some tea before slowly taking a few sips.  He would have preferred thinking that she was thinking her answer over but he had a feeling she was enjoying putting him on the spot.</p><p>“Of course they did, Harry.  Most of your students received Outstandings with only a couple getting Exceeds Expectations.  Although, I must say it is curious, that when I went over your student's marks I noted an improvement across the board - personally and academically.”</p><p>Ignoring her knowing look, that he swore she’d picked up from Dumbledore, Harry didn’t bother asking what she meant as he had a feeling he would’ve known the answer.</p><p>From being a classmate for so many years, Harry had noticed what areas that some of his friends needed improvement.  Neville for example had horrible self-esteem and continually doubted himself in everything but Herbology, so he personally worked with the quiet Gryffindor.  While he had noticed a definite improvement with his duelling, it was nice to know it helped in other areas. </p><p>Another example was Susan Bones who seemed determined to hold her wand tightly and use large flourishes that often weakened her spells.  It hadn’t taken long for him to help her realise the mistake and set it right; something he thought at the time a past professor should’ve helped her with before her fifth year.  Now he thought about it he could see how helping Susan with her wand movements would help her improve with other practical subjects.</p><p>“So…the Ministry, the Board and the rest of the teachers have no issue with me being the Defence teacher in over a month?”</p><p>“Not really.  Besides it is important to note that we are in a war, Harry.  The number of people qualified to teach, that we can trust one hundred percent, is limited and we do not want another Ministry stooge to fill vacancies.  Although if you decide to accept there are some small issues that need to be fixed before term starts.”  Minerva admitted hesitantly.</p><p>Rather than expand on the small issues he’d have to work on, Minerva pulled out a small scroll of parchment secured with a purple ribbon from her pocket and handed it to him.  Not sure what she would be giving him, Harry took it and unfurled it.</p><p> </p><p>

</p><p>‘Oh Merlin.’  Harry thought to himself.  After listening to Minerva speak Harry reviewed all his options, not wanting to make another screw up like at the Ministry.</p><p>It would definitely be a challenge and he would have to study a lot in a very short amount of time but he knew Minerva would help.  The D.A had been nerve wracking at first but he came to really enjoy preparing the classes and teaching the students.  This would be similar just on a much larger scale.  Besides he would do anything to avoid having to deal with another Umbridge. </p><p>“Alright.”  Harry answered with a small smile.  “I’ll do it.”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
