    <span>Prologue</span>
  </u>
</p><p>
  <span>The cold and gloomy classroom was full of 7th and 8th Gryffindors and Slytherins, the atmosphere was tense between the Houses. The war had ended, but the tension persisted. Only a handful of 8th graders had returned to finish their studies, and you could count with two hands how many were in Advanced Potions. The Gryffindors were Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. The Slytherins were Blaze Zabini, Draco Malfoy and Theodore Nott.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Today we are going to brew a very powerful potion, something different. I know all of you are nervous and stressed about your N.E.W.Ts so... I thought you would like something challenging and rewarding" proclaimed Slughorn, he paused for effect and continued "I'm going to give you the instructions to brew a potion, you can choose to brew it or not" that was a surprise, an optional potion? It was something new, for sure. Suddenly all students were paying attention.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"The potion is called Janus" said Slughorn with an air of fatality.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Two gasps were heard in the silent classroom.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Yes, it seems Miss Granger and Mister Malfoy know the potion I'm speaking of" the grin in Slughorn's face was more than a little disturbing. "Mister Malfoy, can you tell us what you know about this potion?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco Malfoy had returned to Hogwarts for several reasons.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>One: It was stipulated in his sentence, better school than Azkaban.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Two: He would have died of boredom on his house with Mother, and it had been very difficult to eat in the table where the Muggle Studies's teacher had been murder and then eaten by a giant snake. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Three: He actually wanted a job after Hogwarts, even if he didn't need it; he wasn't hiding behind his father’s name or money ever again.<br/> But to have this opportunity, to brew the Janus Potion with a teacher supervision... it was exciting and one in a million chance.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco's voice filled the classroom. "The Janus potion gives the one who ingest it a period of time, usually a day, in which he will see a glimpse of the near future. The earliest glimpse recorded was from 6 months and up until 8 months was the longest future recorded. The glimpse it's called a Moment, not any moment but an important moment in the future"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco paused, waiting for Slughorn to correct him, to tell him he had mistaken the potion and they were brewing something else. But the professor didn't say anything, so he continued "The effect of the potion depends on the quality of the potion. If it's perfectly brewed, the glimpse or Moment would last between 15 and 30 minutes. The glimpse would be in the environment or physical space you take the potion. That's why many people take it at work or at home, so they can see their future in relation with their family or job." Draco paused again to give his conclusion "I suppose that as we are at the beginning of the term, we are going to be at Hogwarts in that period of time, so all of us will see an important Moment between 6 to 8 months into the future, here in the castle"<br/> Draco stopped talking and the classroom filled with excited whispers.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Perfect Mister Malfoy! 10 points for Slytherin" said Slughorn beaming.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"This is very interesting" Blaise's voice was, as every student, excited even by Slytherin standards.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"This sounds dangerous" answered Theo with suspicion.</span>
</p><p><span>"It's both" interrupted Draco "It's also a very complicated potion, one that you need a Ministry's permit to brew it" his eyes were shining; the Ministry would never give him permission to make this potion. It was now or never.</span><br/> Draco's eyes went to the front row almost against his will.<br/> Potter, Granger and Weasley were deep in discussion. He couldn't blame them, seeing one's future or not was a tough call, no matter who you were, Death Eater or Savior.</p><p>
  <span>The glimpse wouldn't' show a normal moment, like breakfast in the Great Hall or showering in the Quidditch changing rooms, it was going to be a Moment in the Future, with a capital M and F. It wasn't a lightly decision.<br/> What if he saw something great, and then it changed just because he had seen it? What if he saw something terrible? Draco swallowed and noticed that his hands were trembling faintly, taking a deep breath he tried to control himself.</span>
</p><hr/><p>
  <span>Hermione was going to brew it, no matter what. Ron was indecisive. And Harry was reluctant.<br/> It was as if their roles were reversed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"This could be our only chance to brew this potion Harry!" whispered Hermione.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Yes, I know, but do you really what to see an important moment in your life? Wouldn't you want to be surprised?" Harry asked her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Mate, remember who you are talking to. She'll probably mark the Moment in her calendar" said Ron with a smile.</span>
</p><p><span>His relationship with Hermione had cool down after The Kiss, as his mind called it.</span><br/> After the battle, followed the funerals, and after the funerals Hermione went with Harry to look for her parents to Australia.<br/> Ron had stayed with his family, he didn't regret his decision, him mother and George had needed the whole family united. But now that time and space has come between Hermione and him, neither could take the first step, afraid that The Kiss had been a result of adrenaline and fear. He could still remember Hermione's taste and how her body felt perfect in his arms.</p><p>
  <span>He took a deep breath and look at her. Did he want to know his future? Yes, he did. He wanted to see if he was happy, if this woman was his future or if he had to move on, no matter how much it would hurt.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I'm doing it" Ron said, his gaze firmly connected with Hermione's "I want to see my future"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione smiled at him, her cheeks pink, thinking that maybe Ron was trying to say something by implying another.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry watched them and tried to hide a smirk.<br/> Maybe people would think that he was too invested in Ron's and Hermione's relationship... and they would be right… and he didn't care. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry had seen how Hermione gathered her courage to ask Ron to Slughorn's party, he had seen and comfort her when Ron was dating Lavander, he had been there when she cried to sleep in the tent because Ron wasn't there with them. Harry had seen Hermione's eyes lit up when she laugh at Ron’s jokes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione, his sister in everything but blood, deserved to be happy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>At the same time, Harry had heard every curse and insult Ron's mind could come up with about Victor Krum, and he had been laughing with him at McLaggen's toenails that mysteriously didn't stop growing. Harry was there when the horrocrux showed them Ron's fears, he saw Ron almost lose his mind banging his bloody hands to the dungeon's cell, hearing Hermione being tortured at Malfoy Manor, he had accompanied him while they waited for Hermione to wake up after in Shell Cottage... Ron hadn't move from her side, talking to her, holding her hand and sometimes silently crying.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His best friend loved Hermione, he couldn't think of a better man for his sister.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ironically, Harry didn't think about Ginny, after the battle, the funerals and Australia, their relationship was in shambles, and he realized that he didn't want to fix it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Harry" Hermione interrupted his thoughts "If you don't want to, you don't have to, the potion is optional and I understand that after the prophecy you wouldn't want to know your future...again" she had a teasing smile in her face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Can you imagine? It could be just your luck if your Moment showed you fighting with another Dark Lord, mate" Ron said laughing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Shut up, you git" answer Harry, but he was laughing as well "My name would be Harry Potter, the Boy who Live Thrice...or The Savior 2.0"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The Golden Trio couldn't contain their laughter anymore and started to attract attention, Hermione had tears in her eyes understanding his Muggle reference.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Well, it seems that you three have already decided" interrupted Slughorn.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione looked at Ron and when he nodded she turned to Harry, who nodded as well. He was a bloody Gryffindor, he didn't run from his future.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione beamed at him and answered Slughorn "Yes professor, we will be brewing it"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Excellent" their teacher seemed happy while returning to the front of the class, probably just thinking in all the fame and glory their future had in storage and how he could exploited it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"To the ones who are brewing the Janus Potion, the instructions are in front of you and you can ask me for help. The brewing will be in groups of two, no more, so pick your partner quickly. For those who don't want to know your future, you can start writing an essay about this potion. Seven to nine inches long, please."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry, Ron and Hermione shared a pout, they didn't want to be separated, but before any of them could say anything, Draco Malfoy appeared in front of them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Granger" his voice was tense but no disdain showed in his face "I want my Janus to be perfect and you are the second best at Potions, you want to partner up?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She looked at him in silence for a moment, realizing that Harry and Ron weren't saying anything and letting her decide on her own, without a fight, my my...how time and war changes people.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She smiled at Ron and Harry, then she turned to the blond and answered "Sure Malfoy, this potion is worth the effort"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was a hard pill to swallow the fact that he was better at Potions than she was, just a little better, mind, but still...</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Once everyone was in their seat with the ingredients in the table, Slughorn exclaimed with a big smile "Begin!"</span>
