          <div class="userstuff"><p>Apolline</p>
<p>When I was born, quoth the seer;<br/>
Fair of form, fair of hair,<br/>
Beauty and music will be her birthright,<br/>
Bright shining as the sun,<br/>
She will be the best of both,<br/>
Veela and witch, beauty and wisdom.</p>
<p>When I was a girl, it was said to me;<br/>
Freak of nature, unclean,<br/>
Not meant to be part of our world,<br/>
How do you come here?<br/>
What do you want?<br/>
Go back from where you come.</p>
<p>When I was a girl, my mother said;<br/>
Listen not to the rabble,<br/>
Listen to the music of your own heart,<br/>
Listen to the music that connects all,<br/>
And you will find your way,<br/>
Your way to where you are meant to be.</p>
<p>At school, I said to myself,<br/>
I will find my way,<br/>
I will listen to the music of my heart,<br/>
But instead I listened to the others,<br/>
The others who just tore me down,<br/>
I betrayed myself with their jealousy.</p>
<p>When I was a young woman,<br/>
My mother said to me;<br/>
Find a man, someone to spend your life with,<br/>
But, I wanted to do something first,<br/>
Be something on my own,<br/>
Stand and hear the music on my own.</p>
<p>When I was singer, it was said to me;<br/>
You should show more skin,<br/>
Sell yourself, and not your voice,<br/>
But I succeeded on my own,<br/>
Let my talent shine through,<br/>
And won them over with my choice.</p>
<p>When I gave up on being a star, it was asked of me:<br/>
What will you do now?<br/>
Now that you have it all.<br/>
But I had already chosen,<br/>
Chosen a man, and a family,<br/>
Chosen to raise my daughters.</p>
<p>When I was a mother, it was asked of me;<br/>
Do you regret your choice?<br/>
You gave it all up to have a family.<br/>
You gave it all up for a man.<br/>
But they didn't understand,<br/>
I gave it all up for love.</p>
<p>I could have had it all, maybe,<br/>
Could have held the sun in my hand,<br/>
And not been burned,<br/>
Family, career, children, and stardom,<br/>
But I didn't want to ask that of them.<br/>
The loss of freedom they would see.</p>
<p>When I was old, it was asked of me,<br/>
Was it worth it? Was it all worth it?<br/>
I look on my family, and I know,<br/>
That while I could look at the sun,<br/>
And even hold it for a while,<br/>
That the music I heard was for us alone.</p></div>
