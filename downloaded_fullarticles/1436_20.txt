    <p>Prologue- 1995 (4 years before the Second Wizarding War)</p>
<p>Dumbledore had always admired your ability to word your way out of anything and to manipulate those around you to your benefit no matter who it was. He approached you when you were a seventh year student and gave you a series of tasks that you didn’t quite understand. </p>
<p>The first few challenges were simple; manage to convince a Ravenclaw to write an essay for you without bribing them, transfigure one of Professor Flitwick’s choir toads into a goblet, things of that nature. At first you enjoyed this little game, you relished succeeding in your assignments and receiving praise from the headmaster. </p>
<p>Your favorite job that he gave you was to steal a vial of Felix Felicis from Professor Snape’s office without getting caught. Though you didn’t enjoy deceiving your favorite teacher, you loved the thrill of the challenge. </p>
<p>One night, Dumbledore sent an owl requesting you come see him in his office. When you arrived he looked at you in a way that let you know that this encounter was not going to be about some silly task. He sat behind his desk and motioned for you to take the seat across from him. You sat in the padded chair as he stared at you for a few seconds, the seriousness of his expression made you think that you were in trouble. </p>
<p>“What are your views on the uses of dark magic?” The question stunned you at first. Not knowing how to respond, you explain to Dumbledore your family history. Though you have never talked about it to anyone before, Dumbledore gave you a sense of safety and made you feel like you could open up to him without the fear of being judged. </p>
<p>You tell him about your pure-blood extremist father. He softened his tone, “Does your father know about the menial tasks that I have had you doing?” You assured him that your father had no idea nor would he even care enough to listen to what his daughter was doing while at Hogwarts. He always made it clear that he was far too busy to entertain the ideas of a little girl and would always be apparating away the second the mark on his arm began to burn and move.</p>
<p>“What is the one thing, in your opinion, that stops this world from being perfect?” You reflected on the question for a moment before realizing why Dumbledore had called you here. </p>
<p>“Professor, does this have anything to do with…” His name was thrown around willy-nilly in your home but when you were in public you knew that some had feared even hearing his name. “He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named?” There was silence for what seemed like an eternity. </p>
<p>“Yes, Ms. (L/N). I presume you have taken notice to the increased activity over the past few years.” You knew exactly what he was referring to. Ever since Harry Potter started at Hogwarts, every year had been riddled with some type of excitement. Last year was the only time your father had ever asked you about your time at Hogwarts, the year that Potter revealed that the Dark Lord had returned. </p>
<p>“I also presume that your family has been quite busy since the return of Lord Voldemort.” Hearing his name somewhere other than home was strange, it made everything seem much more real. The Ministry refused to admit that he had returned and the rumors had died down, but you heard the whispers shared between your parents and their colleagues. You knew that it was true, the Dark Lord had returned.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately they have been busier than ever. I think you know what my answer to your question would be, Professor.” You felt your face grow red and hot as an anger like no other boiled inside your belly. “He was supposed to be dead! He was never supposed to return to this world, to ruin my family more than he already has! He has destroyed so many lives! The lives of innocents, the lives of Muggles, even the lives of his loyal servants! He rips families apart and forces people into servitude!” You didn’t notice how loud your voice had become or the tears that were welling up in your eyes. You finally released all of the frustration that had built up in you since you were told that you had to join your family by his side. “My perfect world? In my perfect world, Voldemort is as he should be. Dead.” </p>
<p>Dumbledore stood and walked over to his balcony overlooking the Black Lake. You could tell that your answer was more than he had hoped for. </p>
<p>“Professor Snape should be proud to have you as a Slytherin, you have proven to be very resourceful and cunning over the past couple of months. These tasks that I have asked of you have not been random, Ms. (L/N). I have been studying you very closely to see if you have what it takes to become part of an organization that shares your hatred of Lord Voldemort. I have determined that you have everything it takes to become a member of the Order. If you accept my offer you will enter into a family, one that treasures your abilities and will protect you to the ends of the world. Would you like that?”</p>
<p>A lump began to form in your throat. All you have ever wanted was to be accepted and loved by your family and you didn’t want to become one of Voldemort’s slaves. You had no idea what you were about to agree to but you trusted Dumbledore with your life and wanted nothing more than to join a group who would actually care about you. </p>
<p>“I would love nothing more, Professor!”</p>
<p>“I must warn you, there is the chance that you will be harmed or even killed if you choose to join us. There are dangerous times ahead.”</p>
<p>“I understand, sir. I would be honored to join you in the fight against the Dark Lord.”</p>
<p>“Then I have one last question for you, Ms. (L/N). How skilled are you in the art of deception?”</p>
