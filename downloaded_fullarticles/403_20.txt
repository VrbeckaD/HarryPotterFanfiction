    <p>*H*O*G*W*A*R*T*S* *G*R*O*U*N*D*S* *2*0*0*9*</p><p>"Ron! Ron! RON! NO! You said we'd end this together!" yelled Harry.</p><p>"Harry, we have to go! There's nothing we can do! Let's Go!" screamed Hermione over all the blasts and booms of spells and curses. Both she and Ginny started to run towards Hogwarts.</p><p>"O... O... Okay. Okay let's go." cried Harry. He ran after Hermione and Ginny while dodging spells.</p><p>*G*R*E*A*T* *H*A*L*L*</p><p>"HARRY POTTER! ALL THOSE YOU USED TO LOVE ARE DEAD! SURRENDER YOURSELF AND I WILL SPARE YOUR PRECIOUS BLOOD TRAITOR AND MUDBLOOD. I WILL GRACIOUSLY ALLOW YOU TO WANDER THE GROUND TO FIND ANY WEAKLINGS THAT ARE ALIVE. YOU HAVE TWO HOURS UNTIL I COME TO FIND YOU, AND WHEN I DO THERE WILL BE NO SURVIVORS." Voldemort's voice boomed throughout the empty great hall.</p><p>"Harry you can't go." said Hermione, "It's suicidal!"</p><p>"Mione, if I don't go all those that died will have died in vain. You can't ask that of me. Remember I have a 'Saving-People-Thing'. And if Tom wins then so many other people will die. I have to end this." said Harry. With that, he turned and headed towards the forest.</p><p>Hermione and Ginny collapsed into each other's arms, knowing this would be the last time they saw their surrogate brother again.</p><p>*T*H*E* *F*O*R*E*S*T*</p><p>As Harry walked, he pulled out the snitch that Dumbledore gave to him. Hermione, R... his best mate, and he had already figured out that to open the snitch, he had to press it to his lips and do something else, but what - he didn't know. Harry read the words that always appeared 'I OPEN AT THE CLOSE'. As he walked through the forest, the meaning of those words hit him like a bludger. Harry pressed the snitch to his lips and whispered, "I am going, ready, and willing to die." The snitch opened and out fell a small, smooth, riverbed stone. 'The resurrection stone' thought Harry. Thrice the stone was turned over in his hand. Wisps of Ghostly Smoke rose out of it. Suddenly he realized that it wasn't smoke but figures. "Mom," the redhead smiled at Harry, "Dad," his look-alike he knew to be his Dad sadly nodded at him, "Sirius," Harry started to cry, " R... Ron. I'm So Sorry I didn't want any of you to die. I... I..."</p><p>"You didn't know, You couldn't have stopped our deaths, Prongslet." James said.</p><p>"Pup, Riddle sent an image to you that he KNEW you couldn't ignore. I would have done the same if it was your father or you." said Sirius.</p><p>"Yeah Har, and Rookwood cast the AK Curse at me and I was too slow." Ron told Harry.</p><p>"Harry, My Dear Son, go and finish off Riddle for us." Lily cried.</p><p>"Does dying hurt?" asked Harry like the little boy he never got to be.</p><p>"No, it's quicker than falling asleep," said Sirius.</p><p>"Stay with me?"</p><p>"Till the End." Harry let the stone fall, and with it, the Spirits disappeared. Harry walked to Tom Marvolo Riddle. To his Death.</p><p>*O*U*T*S*I*D*E* *T*H*E* *G*R*E*A*T* *H*A*L*L*</p><p>The doors to the Great Hall opened slowly. Ginny and Hermione looked up quickly, thinking there was a Death Eater. But they only saw a bloody man dragging himself through the doors clutching onto something small.</p><p>"REMUS!" screamed Ginny. Hermione and she ran towards him. Ignoring the blood, they grabbed him to haul him off the floor where he had fallen, weak from blood loss.</p><p>"Mi... Gin..." he gasped through the pain.</p><p>"Remy! What Happened?" Cried Ginny.</p><p>"Fi-nished... Grey-back... Silv-er... Knife..." gasped Remus. Ginny and Hermione looked down and saw a dagger handle protruding out of his chest. Hermione's and Ginny's faces were horror-stricken. Ginny grabbed her wand and conjured a towel and started to wipe the blood of Remus' face. Hermione had started to get up to get some medical supplies when Remus grabbed her arm to stop her.</p><p>"Don't. You Can't Help. It's Too Late." he said painfully. Ginny just continued to hold his other clenched fist and clean the blood off, while Hermione sat beside them." Take these time turners, go back and save them," he looked at Ginny with his pain-filled golden eyes. "Please." Hermione and Ginny looked at each other and nodded. They turned as one and accepted the time turners from Remus. Hermione got up to get some water for Remus. As she walked away, she started to examine the time turner. While she was gone, Ginny and Remus spoke.</p><p>Biting her lip, "Were we there before?"</p><p>"Yes" he replied shakily.</p><p>"Remy" "Gin" they said together. Ginny nodded for Remus to go first.</p><p>"Gin, if I tell you this, you can not let it affect the way your relationships with the others of that time form. I don't care if you act differently around me but don't let it affect the others or your mission to save them." Ginny nodded her consent. " I..." Remus gasped in pain and his eyes slowly shut but not before he whispered his final thought to Ginny, "I love you, always have, always will."</p><p>"Remus. REMUS! NO! No. Please, please." she screamed. "Please I love you, too," she whispered brokenly.</p><p>Hermione came up and wrapped her arm around Ginny's shoulders. "Gin we have to go, Harry lost, they're coming. We have to go now."</p><p>"But his body?"</p><p>"Step back and I'll move him to a safe place." Ginny stepped back and Hermione levitated him to a secret alcove. "Goodbye Remus, We'll make you proud."</p><p>"Bye Remy. See you soon."</p><p>"Gin. This type of magic... I've read about it. When we use these, our time will be erased. We CAN change the timeline as we know it... But we won't ever be able to come back. Do you still want to do this?" asked Hermione quickly.</p><p>"We were already there so Yes." A boom sounded through the hall as Voldemort and his Death Eaters gained entry.</p><p>"Well Looky here My Faithfuls. We have stumbled upon a Mudblood and a Blood Traitor. Must be our lucky night." said Voldemort laughing. Ginny and Hermione quickly activated the time turners. The last thing they saw was Voldemort roaring before everything went black.</p>
