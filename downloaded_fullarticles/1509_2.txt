    <p dir="ltr">Severus traced his finger along Draco's red lower lip, who was watching him intently, mouth open. He left the touch with a sigh and closed his eyes, gathering his foreheads. Draco laughed low, pleased.</p><p dir="ltr">This boy is <em>his everything</em>. </p><p dir="ltr">He went down to leave small chaste kisses on the creamy pale skin of his lover's neck, making him shudder slightly, still sensitive.</p><p dir="ltr">Draco takes his face and kisses him deeply and slow. Takes a portion of soft jet-black hair and the potions master briefly breaks the kiss with a gasp, reacting to the touch. The boy exerts pressure on his legs that lie open, hooked to the other's and moans light and sharp in the kiss, a sweet sound almost inaudible.</p><p dir="ltr">Tongues coil making noises of collision and detaching, while the delicate rythm turns them both red until they separate to breath.</p><p dir="ltr">The drak haired man watches him flushed and with his lips swollen, half-opened with a smirk. His blue-gray eyes with a relaxed expression, the sun shines on his hair. He caresses the silvery strands of silk.</p><p dir="ltr">"How beautiful you are." comments Snape, surrendered.</p><p dir="ltr">"Am I?"</p><p dir="ltr">"Mhmm."</p><p dir="ltr">Draco closes his eyes and smiles radiant, genuine.</p><p dir="ltr">Because this man is <em>his everything.</em></p><p dir="ltr">Snape smiles at him trying to control his altered heartbeat, kisses his cheek loudly and turns them around, leaving Draco on the top now.</p><p dir="ltr">"Don't tell me you didn't know...?"</p><p dir="ltr">"It's just nice to hear It from you"</p><p dir="ltr">Severus covers Draco's back with the messy white sheet.</p><p dir="ltr">"You don't know how blessed I feel to have you, Severus" Murmured the blond one on his neck.</p><p dir="ltr">"I still can not believe that you chose me" he pauses "and decided to stay, after all this time"</p><p dir="ltr">Draco smiled on a superficially kiss.</p><p dir="ltr">"Always."</p>
