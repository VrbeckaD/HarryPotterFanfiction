  <em>There is nothing I can do now. Nothing, but reminisce.</em>
</p><p>    <em>It was a blustery winter, seven years ago, when I was expelled.</em></p><p>    <em>I remember standing out on one of the second-floor balconies of my parents’ lavish manor, letting the icy snow ravage my face, watching ice escape its bindings and swallow up the school from far, far away.</em></p><p>    “Hey?”</p><p>    I turned around. A little five-year-old-girl was pulling at my sleeve, looking up at me with big dark eyes much like my own. </p><p>    “Did they really snap your wand?” She asked, tears pricking in her eyes. </p><p>    “Yeah,” I said, my own voice echoing in my head, “but it’s alright, Starbright. Everything’s going to be okay.”</p><p>    She sniffed. “It’s so unfair. You were just trying to do a good thing. You’re not a bad person.”</p><p>    Her tears redoubled. I knelt down and held her close, singing softly into her ear.</p><p>    “<em> Don’t you burn out baby,</em><br/>
<em>Don’t you start to worry,</em><br/>
<em>Don’t you stop glowing,</em><br/>
<em>And don’t you stop knowing,</em><br/>
<em>That I love you,</em><br/>
<em>I love you true,</em><br/>
<em>More than any star in the sky,</em><br/>
<em>Baby girl, this ain’t good-bye.</em> ”</p><p>    My little sister’s tears slowed, then stopped, curling up in my lap and resting her head on my chest. I pet her hair gently. Foggy visions of dark corridors tried to cloud my sight, but this time, this one time, I refused to give in. Leaving her was the hardest thing in the world, but I had to get back to Hogwarts before the curses destroyed everything, including her. In this one moment, however, I only let myself think about me and my sister, and how much I love her, and how much she means to me. She probably hates me now that I’m missing, but one day she’ll understand.</p><p>    She’d started to nod off, nuzzling my chest softly. I wondered if there was a spell that could make everything just stop. I carefully picked her up and carried her to her room. Tucking her into bed, I watched her open her eyes a sliver and take my hand. </p><p>    “Everything’s going to be okay,” she muttered groggily, “so don’t you worry.”</p><p>    “<em>Don’t you start to worry,</em><br/>
<em>And don’t you stop knowing,</em><br/>
<em>That I love you true,</em>” my singing was barely louder than the wind outside. I lay down next to her, cradling her tiny body against mine.</p><p>    “<em>Baby girl, this ain’t good-bye.</em>”</p><p>    Baby girl, this ain’t good-bye.</p>
