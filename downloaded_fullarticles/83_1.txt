    <p>Also on a side note, Bellatrix and Rodolphus never got caught with torturing Neville's parents, they got away with the crime regardless of what the rest of wizarding Britain knew, kinda like those crime scenes where the criminal gets away scott free even though everyone and their mother knows that they committed it, such is the case here. Not enough evidence could be found to convict them.</p><p>Year: 3rd year</p><p>Pairings: Hermione/Fleur, Harry/Ginny, some other couples still working them out in my head, perhaps you guys could give me some suggestions?</p><p>Chapter 1 : Let's Play a game</p><p>This is a tale of two lovers, torn by the obligation and duty, of fate and destiny, of light and dark. A son born to a couple fighting for the light, born as the seventh month died with the power to vanquish the dark lord. A daughter born to the dark, to followers of the Dark Lord, to those wishing to see an end of the light. However not lovers with each other, but rather friends, a wizard in love with a light witch and a dark witch in love with a light witch. Such is the tale of the two. Friends, although that is yet to be seen.</p><p>The boy orphaned at a young age, by the Dark Lord, the son of Lily and James Potter, and mistreated by relatives whom were supposed to be his only family left. Alone, abused, and mistreated he was left to believe that his mother and father had met their end due to an unfortunate motor vehicle accident. Until his 11th birthday did he learn the truth of their deaths and of the destiny to which he was meant for, learning of the wealth that his parents left him and of the love they both had for him prior to their deaths. Told of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and of his acceptance, the boy eagerly agreed to attend. On the train ride there he made a number of friends, one being Ron Weasley, a boy from a pureblood family that fought for the light. The other being Neville Longbottom, a boy whom had shared the qualifications to be the Boy Who Lived but was not chosen by the Dark Lord as his equal. The three became known as the Golden Trio not long after their first and second years respectively. It was at Hogwarts that the boy met the girl, whose parents had been accused of being followers of the Dark Lord. It was there that he also met Draco Malfoy, another such child born to parents that had been for the reign of the Dark Lord, he and Draco went on to become rivals at the start of their 1st year when the boy had refused the offer of friendship from the other boy. The first year of his schooling was met with the problem of the Sorcerer's Stone, and that of the professor of Defense Against The Dark Arts wanting to attain it for the sake of the resurrection of the Dark Lord, the boy and his friends Ron and Neville managed to thwart the professor's plans and prevented the Dark Lord from resurrecting. The second year of the boy's schooling was met with the obstacle of the Chamber of Secrets, and of the students accusing him of being the heir of slytherin, another attempt by a follower of the Dark Lord to resurrect The Dark Lord, this time by the Malfoy family patriarch Lucius Malfoy in the form of a little black diary. A diary containing a fraction of the soul of the Dark Lord, Harry and his friends once more where able to thwart the plans that the soul within the book had of releasing the basilisk upon the student population, and were also able to save the younger sister of Ron, whom had fallen victim to the spell of the book. The boy proving time and time again that no matter what the Dark threw at him, he would fight against it and immerse triumphant, would one day take down the Dark Lord and bring peace to all, such is the life of Harry Potter.</p><p>To a proud pure-blood family, was born a girl. The daughter of two of the cruelest Death Eaters, ardent followers of the Dark Lord Voldemort. Amongst chaos and destruction was born a child to them, to Rodolphus and Bellatrix Lestrange. A little girl with wit and beauty to match it. A kind and well-meaning child. Was raised to be proud of the blood status to which she had been born to, and to uphold the Dark Lord as a savior to their dying blood status. She had nothing to ever want for, or anything to be envious off, being raised by a surprisingly caring father and mother. She got on well with other children of pure-blooded families, and was especially close with her cousin Draco, the son of her aunt Narcissa whom was the younger sister to her mother. Both children were brought up in rather the same manner and were prime examples of pure-blooded breading according to their parents and other such pure-blooded families. Although taught that pure-blood supremacy was what the wizarding world needed. The young girl did not whole heartedly agree with the notion. Too young to really come to terms with her beliefs and afraid of what her mother and father might think, if they were to find out the thoughts going through her head, she kept them back in the farthest recesses of her mind and didn't dwell much on them. Her first year at Hogwarts, began with relative ease. Although she had been surprised when hearing several other students on the train ride there, speak in hushed whispers of Harry Potter coming to Hogwarts. She knew of what he had done to the Dark Lord, having heard it many a time from both her parents. She wondered what the boy was actually like, but dared not to approach him. Her cousin Draco and a few of their friends quickly finding a compartment and settling down for the ride. There it was that Draco proposed to try to bring Potter into the fold, to see where the boy's affiliations would lie, and to teach him how to associate himself with the right sort of people. Upon hearing her cousin's words she had been a bit curious of the proposition and ultimately decided to go along with it. To the astonishment of their group, the Potter boy had refused and rather rudely so she thought. Not much of a surprise was it when Harry Potter was sorted into Gryffindor such as his parents had been before him, Draco and herself having been sorted into Slytherin several minutes prior, their parents would be proud of them both. The rest of the year progressed with relative ease, between her cousin getting into a bit more than a few disagreements with the Potter boy and herself trying to dissuade him of even bothering with the Potter boy altogether. Receiving a sneer and a glare here and then from Neville Longbottom, Ron Weasley, and on occasion Harry Potter himself, the year went relatively smooth. The disappointment both she and her cousin Draco felt at having lost the house cup, no thanks to the heroic actions of the Gryffindor or Gryffindork trio as Draco liked to call them. Their second year was met with a bit more excitement than the first. Draco had made the quidditch team much to the approval of both her father and uncle Lucius, the donation from both their fathers having made the whole ordeal much sweeter. The horrific events of the chamber of secrets being opened had both appalled and terrified the students of Hogwarts, herself and Draco had reacted indifferent to the whole matter having not thought to worry about becoming victims of the snake's gaze. To the horror of her family she would fall victim to the basilisk's gaze by reflection of a mirror, and therefore became petrified. The antidote was not able to be made till the end of term, after Harry Potter and his friends managed to defeat the snake. The life that the girl had was wrought with an internal battle, not fully knowing what to truly believe and afraid to voice her internal thoughts to her family such was the life of Hermione Lestrange.</p><p>-/-</p><p>Year: 1993, August 15th</p><p>Southern Wales: Lestrange Manor</p><p>"I think that with a bit more encouraging we will be able to make other pureblood families see reason with our views, at least with regards to France," the tall intimidating presence of Lucius Malfoy spoke, his brother in law and himself standing by the fire on that particular cold and windy night.</p><p>"You think so?" the tall muscular form of Rodolphus Lestrange responded with an air of interest.</p><p>"Quite so, we just need to convince one or two of the more prominent families there and the rest will follow," the blond haired man responded.</p><p>"Which did you have in mind?" the taller man asked; gaze seemingly concentrated on the flames in front of them, but not really paying much attention to them.</p><p>"The Dampierres, Évreuxs, Bernadottes, Maizières, and Delacours," Lucius spoke with relative ease.</p><p>"Didn't Monsieur Delacour marry a half-breed veela?" Rodolphus shot back, a questioning gaze at his brother in law.</p><p>"He did, but the family's lineage is pure on his side, and their family holds a great influence over many of the pure-blood families there," Lucius casually responded.</p><p>"Would it be possible to meet with the other four families and avoid the Delacours?" Rodolphus inquired, he did not like the idea of having to associate himself with half-breeds of any sort.</p><p>"Regrettably not, but veela are very beautiful creatures, it would at least make the meeting more enjoyable," Lucius commented, he had already made contact with the Delacour Patriarch and had settled on a meeting day.</p><p>"Quite, Bellatrix will be a bit hard to convince," Rodolphus replied, his wife could be rather hard to handle at times.</p><p>"Yes, but Hermione could help smooth things over I should think," Lucius spoke; he knew that his sister in law would be harder to convince.</p><p>"Rightly so, she is of course a properly brought up pure-blooded young lady," Rodolphus agreed.</p><p>"Indeed she is, I've set the meeting for the 28th of this month," Lucius spoke the decision final.</p><p>"I assumed as such, you were always one for being one step ahead," Rodolphus replied with a chuckle, it was getting quite late his wife and daughter having had gone to bed an hour prior.</p><p>"All for the service to the Dark Lord," Lucius replied, with a final gaze at his brother in law he took his leave back to his home.</p><p>-/-</p><p>August 17th: Early Morning</p><p>"What is the meaning of this Rodolphus!?" the indignant loud outburst of Bellatrix Lestrange rang out as her husband, daughter and herself sat about the dining hall of their manor.</p><p>"It is as such Bellatrix," Rodolphus tried to reason, casting a glance at his daughter who returned his gaze back, already knowing what to do next so as to pacify the Lestrange family Matriarch, her father having had informed her of the upcoming meeting with the Delacour family the day prior.</p><p>"To associate ourselves with those half-breeds, it's unheard of Rodolphus; our parents would turn in their graves, to hear such an atrocity!" Bellatrix bit back.</p><p>"It would help to aid us in the cause of the Dark Lord," Rodolphus replied, taking a bite of his toast, he had rather expected this of his wife.</p><p>"Surely they must not hold that much of an influence that we would need to associate with their lot, any of the other families would do," the Lestrange family matriarch replied with disdain.</p><p>"Theirs hold to great of influence amongst the other families to simply overlook," Rodolphus simply stated, he hoped that his wife would see reason.</p><p>"Mother surely it would be but a small sacrifice to endure for the cause of the Dark Lord?" their daughter inquired taking a moment away from her breakfast.</p><p>"Hermione, you are much too young to fully understand an indiscretion, such as this one, it does not become a pureblood to associate with any other bellow them in status," Bellatrix instructed, she would not have her daughter thinking it alright to associate with half-breeds, mudbloods, or creatures of any sort.</p><p>"But mother, it would be but a small thing to endure, and the outcome would be more people to come to the right sense of things and see the justifiable means of the Dark Lord, wouldn't it appease him greatly to know that his loyal followers have increased their numbers in his cause, when he comes back," the young Lestrange spoke with an air of timid confidence.</p><p>"Cunning in that she sees how greatly this would aid the Dark Lord, we have but to gain" Rodolphus commented, a proud look on his features for the wit of his daughter.</p><p>"Hmm, of course she is part black after all, with the purest blood, very well if needs must then we will meet with these Half-breeds and get them to join the Dark Lord, it would please him so," Bellatrix finally agreed, sending a somewhat arrogant smirk towards her daughter, Hermione sending one back. A small mother daughter quirk they both shared with each other. A relieved Rodolphus watched the two and continued with is breakfast in relative ease.</p><p>-/-</p><p>August 17th : Late Afternoon</p><p>Location: Malfoy Manor</p><p>"How do you suppose a veela looks like, do you think they look like the pictures in the books?" Draco inquired as he chose a book from the nearby bookshelf and sat down with his cousin in the family's library.</p><p>"I'm not sure, perhaps, I'm a bit apprehensive about this meeting though," Hermione replied, she and Draco had been flipping through books the whole afternoon, researching on veela's, their culture, their habits and any other information they could find on the beings. The particular transformation that veela's go through when angered, having unsettled them both upon reading it.</p><p>"Father says that their beautiful women, and that they're distantly related to the sirens of old folklore," Draco replied trying to ease his cousin, he himself being a bit apprehensive about the meeting with the Delacour family.</p><p>"Let's hope so," Hermione replied reading a page from the current book she had in her possession with interest.</p><p>-/-</p><p>August 28th: Mid Afternoon</p><p>Location: Malfoy Manor – Main Living Room</p><p>"Now Hermione, I want you and Draco to keep out of trouble, remember your manners and be civil, we must show these French, that we are refined and dignified the proper example of fine pureblood breeding," Bellatrix instructed her nephew and daughter as she looked them both up and down to make sure that any imperfections to their attires were fixed. The Delacour family would be arriving via apparition any moment.</p><p>"Yes mother,"</p><p>"Yes aunt Bellatrix," the two young teens responded with a firm nod each.</p><p>A resounding pop was heard a few minutes later and the intimidating presence of Monsieur Delacour and his family made their presence at last. His wife a head taller than himself, a tall beauty with silvery blond hair and light blue eyes. Their two daughters a young lady with identical looks to that of her mother except for her deep blue eyes, and a younger smaller daughter with the same facial look of that of her mother and older sister.</p><p>"Mr. Delacour, a pleasure to have you in our home," Lucius Malfoy spoke with high regard as he stood in front of the French man and shook his hand, a firm handshake.</p><p>"Eet iz ou' pleezure, thank ou' 'our having uz," the French man responded with air of confidance.</p><p>"This must be your wife and daughters," Rodolphus spoke, bowing in front of the half-veela and kissing her hand.</p><p>"Oui, thiz iz mai wife Apolline an' daughteerz Fleur an' Garbrielle," the French man responded once more presenting his family.</p><p>"How lovely, it is a pleasure ladies," Lucius spoke bowing to the three ladies.</p><p>"This is my wife Bellatrix and my daughter Hermione," Rodolphus presented his wife and child, who both made a curtsy in front of the Delacour family. His daughter in particular looking a bit longer than necessary at the oldest daughter of the Delacour family. A small smile gracing the eldest daughter's face in return.</p><p>"And this is my wife Narcissa and my son Draco," Lucius presented, his wife and son respectfully bowing and curtsying in return.</p><p>"Shall we head into the parlor, to get better acquainted and allow the children to get to know each other better," Lucius suggested, so far the meeting with the Delacour family was going quite well.</p><p>"Oui," Monsieur Delacour agreed offering his arm to his wife and leaving his two daughters with the young children of the Lestranges and Malfoys.</p><p>Silence overtook the atmosphere around the youths as neither side knew what to say to start a conversation, Hermione and Draco both being rather a bit intimidated and Fleur and Gabrielle, one being only 7 years old and very shy and Fleur trying to find the right words to say in English.</p><p>"Hello, my name is Hermione, how do you do," the young daughter of the Lestranges finally spoke through the silence, smiling up at the older French witch and then down to the younger.</p><p>"I am Fleur," the older witch responded curtsying and taking the younger witches hand and kissing it, a small knowing smile on her features.</p><p>"Pleasure, this is my cousin Draco" the younger witch responded with a light blush, from whence it came she could not figure out but at present moment did not dwell on it.</p><p>"It iz a 'onor to meet ou' both," Fleur responded smiling at the boy as well, he seemed a bit nervous.</p><p>"Likewise," Draco responded with a small bow and a small smile to the shy younger French girl.</p><p>"So 'hat iz it dat ou' english o' for fun?" The older French witch asked with a mischievous look on her face. At that comment, the young english boy's face lit up a bit and he walked out only to return a minute later with a cheese set and another box.</p><p>"Wizards Chess, and Exploding Snap," Draco eagerly spoke setting down the chees board and setting up the pieces.</p><p>"You'll have to excuse my dear cousin; he loves Wizards Chess a bit of an expert I'd say," Hermione whispered into the ear of the older witch as they watched with relative amusement, the young boy set up the chess board.</p><p>"It iz not a problem, I am 'ow ou' english zay, a bit o' a exzpert myself," Fleur responded with a wink.</p><p>-/-</p><p>Late afternoon</p><p>"Check mate," the older French witch said with confidence as her chess piece destroyed Draco's king.</p><p>"Again? That's the fourth time in a row," Draco frustratedly spoke, he had not expected the French witch to be an avid player of the game.</p><p>"Oui" Fleur responded taking a glance at Hermione and Gabrielle, the two had taken to speaking amongst themselves after the second game.</p><p>"Children it is time to be seated for dinner, so freshen up if you must and come join us in the dining hall," Narcissa spoke walking into the main Living room and looking with amusement at the scene before her, Draco and Fleur were each engaging in another game of wizards chess and Hermione was talking rather animatedly with the younger Delacour, Gabrielle.</p><p>"Yes mother," Draco spoke getting up and started to put the chess game away, telling Fleur that they would continue another day. The older French witch nodding in agreement and getting up to take Gabrielle's hand.</p><p>"Yes Aunt Narcissa," Hermione responded at the same time as her cousin, herself getting up and fixing the small crumples that her dress had attained from sitting on the living room sofa for a long time.</p><p>"It 'as a pleezure spending zee time getting to know each 'ozer," Fleur spoke, a small smile to her little sister to acknowledge the same. The little girl in turn nodded in agreement and lightly curtsied and smiled at the two english teens.</p><p>"The pleasure was ours, we had fun too," Both Draco and Hermione responded a smile on each of their faces. With that being said the two French witches made their leave of the living room to freshen up.</p><p>"Well that went rather well," Draco spoke first, looking at his cousin with mirth in his eyes.</p><p>"Yes it went really well," Hermione responded playfully shoving her cousin in the shoulder as they both walked out of the living room to go join their parents.</p><p>-/-</p><p>Malfoy Manor – Restroom</p><p>The three Delacour ladies had decided before hand, to reconvene in the ladies restroom after their respective time with the english, to see what the other had gathered from these english wishing to have their favor.</p><p>"Maman j'ai trouvé mon compagnon," the French witch spoke with excitement in her native tongue. Her mother's face at hearing this lit up and pulled her eldest daughter to herself. Her younger daughter's face lighting up as well at having learned this new bit of information.</p><p>"Etes-vous sûr?" the French veela asked, making sure that her daughter was right about this bit of information.</p><p>"Tout à fait, j'ai eu ce sentiment dont tu m'as parlé, c'est elle, elle est un peu jeune mais," Fleur responded with excitement, Gabrielle in turn jumping up and down with excitement, and laughing a little at hearing the last bit.</p><p>"Ce n'est pas grave, nous devons dire à ton père à ce sujet, joyeuse nouvelles," the older veela responded with a smile as the three of them finished freshening up and walked back out to join the others for dinner.</p><p>-/-</p><p>Dialogue Translation -</p><p>1.
