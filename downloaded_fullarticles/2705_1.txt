<li>POA used to be my favourite book back when I was a child. I say used to because back then when I started reading the series only the first four books were released. I’m not sure if it is my favourite Potter book still (though it is definitely in the top), because I do love book 5-7 a lot as well. I might rank them once I finish my re-read. One of the reasons why I still love this book so much is because it is pretty dark. Many people would argue that book 4 made the transition from children’s book to a young adult novel, but I would say we already see this change in book 3. The general mood of book 3 is much darker than that in book 4, however GOF ends on a much more serious and sadder note.</li>

<li>I love those random facts about the wizard history, in this case witch burning (and why it was pointless). It does explain the deep mistrust wizards have towards most Muggles, and why they live in secret. I wonder though what they thought about the countless Muggles who did indeed die, because they were accused to be witches. There is no mention of them in Harry’s textbook, and it goes with what we learned so far, that the wizarding world does in no way intervene or care about the Muggle world.</li>

<li>Petition: Please give Errol some rest (seriously Percy, you have a perfectly healthy owl that you could have lent your brother).</li>

<li>Remember how the Weasleys in book 2 only had 1 Galleon in their vault? And later they had to pay a fine of 50 Galleons. Now however they had won 700 Galleons, spending most on a summer holiday in Egypt, but also getting Ron a new wand (thankfully). Anyway, according to the Internet (and according to J. K. Rowling) 1 Galleon equals 5 pounds (or 5€). Which doesn’t make a lot of sense, neither in the way of how poor the Weasleys are or how much things cost in the wizarding world.</li>
</ul>
  <ul>
<li>Hermione’s birthday present to Harry seems quite expensive (Broomstick Servicing Kit), and given that she has two dentists as parents it is fair to assume she and her family are high middle class or upper class.</li>
</ul>
  <ul>
<li>Both Ron and Hagrid refer in their letters to the Dursleys as “<em>the Muggles</em>” <em>(“Don’t let the Muggles get you down!” / “Hope the Muggles are treating you right.”</em>).  Not “<em>the Dursleys</em>” or “<em>your family</em>”. Only Hermione uses the words “<em>your uncle Vernon</em>”. Which I think is significant in the way that Ron and Hagrid see the Dursleys (and basically all Muggles) as other, something so different from themselves that they only think of them in the most basic way: as non magic people. Whereas Hermione uses the name of Harry’s uncle, because however horrible he treats Harry, she sees him as a person.</li>
