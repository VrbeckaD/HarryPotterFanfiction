  <b>1. Mornings</b>
</p><p>Padma’s usual day starts with a cup of her favorite strong coffee and some lightly-buttered toast. She sits across Hermione; they read different papers but keep each other up to date on the nuances of both. Hermione has been determined not to rely on a single news source since the numerous fiascos with the <i>Prophet</i>, and Padma has followed suite, never having been as political as her girlfriend but learning to be more so every day.</p><p>Hermione is more of a morning person than Padma is, so she clears up breakfast things while Padma skips past the sports section and to the magically animated comics that always seem to be reprints from childhood. She catches up on the adventures of Wimpy Warlock and the Boggart while the kitchen gets cleaned in an effortless bustle of dishes whizzing from sink to towel to cabinet.</p><p>When Hermione has to leave for work, Padma gets up and kisses her, enclosing herself in the scent of freshly laundered robes and a lingering sleepiness.</p><p>Padma’s job at the library starts at ten and she has an hour to spend engrossed in her studies. She reads half of a chapter of <i>Advanced Computational Charms</i> and lets herself get distracted by a challenging proof to the Orpington Theorem before hurriedly gathering her things and running out the door.</p><p>
  <b>2. Depth</b>
</p><p>With her energy of lightness and encouragement, Hermione has filled her life with an ease Padma never thought she could feel with another person. She had thought she would never be comfortable dating let alone sharing her space so intimately with someone.</p><p>Their love story is a simple one, but Padma was never a romantic. She wanted practical things and comfortable things. A mutually supportive partnership in which to chase after respective intellectual pursuits. Visits to old bookshops together. Walks in parks. Slow mornings in bed. Coffee.</p><p>Simplicity with depth.</p><p>Her life has all that and a number of things she couldn’t have factored in.</p><p>There’s running in various fundraisers that she dutifully goes to even though she doesn’t enjoy crowds. Hermione never minds that she spends the whole event huddled in a corner with a book or helping out behind the scenes.</p><p>There’s the job she would never had applied to if it wasn’t for Hermione’s encouragement, because she doesn’t like customer service. (Turns out, working with customers who also love books isn’t so bad.)</p><p>And there’s the way she’s been emboldened to let her carefully built walls come down and allowed her core to be shaken in a way that was completely outside the scope of her imagination.</p><p>Hermione can stir up a new thought in her that will make her shiver all over, like the feeling of heat from a crackling fire after stepping in from a biting cold. In moments of heated discussion Padma feels with pervasive clarity just how remarkable it is to have a connection with a mind like Hermione’s. With words they pierce deeper into the works of each other’s psyches than where their physical dimensions could take them. It is what sex must feel like for most people, except Padma thinks with shameless bias that what she and Hermione share must be more intimate.</p><p>
  <b>3. Moving In</b>
</p><p>They met during Arithmancy studies that Hermione soon gave up for her love for social justice. Study dates had extended into a passionate friendship, dates into invitations home, visits into sleepovers.</p><p>And with a linear predictability that Padma liked, Hermione had started moving in. Her books and papers had come first before many of the more practical items, gathering into respectful piles in places where they were unobtrusive.</p><p>Padma remembers the momentous feeling she had had when she had placed an extra glass in the bathroom cupboard and waited, heart-fluttering, for Hermione to notice. The next time Hermione had been over, a toothbrush had appeared.</p><p>The cat had come last, a part Padma had not looked forward to. The cat didn’t like her even though he was good at pretending he was indifferent in front of Hermione. Wolf was named after Virginia Woolf, but reminded Padma enough of the real animal to make her keep a safe distance whenever her girlfriend wasn’t around to shield her.</p><p>She had never been comfortable around animals, not that she was comfortable around most things. Maybe, in a way she resented the cat because there was something similar about them. They were both interpreted as prickly and cool by people who didn’t know them. They both disliked most people but liked Hermione very, very much.</p><p>
  <b>4. Nights</b>
</p><p>There’s still a thrill of new routines. Sometimes a misplaced book or hairbrush or the sight of Hermione’s clothes on the back of a chair will surprise her with a jolt of acute happiness, so foreign to her that it almost hurts.</p><p>There’s an excitement in figuring out their own ways of dealing with things. They like negotiation; Hermione has a repertoire of techniques she’s learned up her sleeve and when they quarrel, they come up with a plan for what to try next time if the same situation occurs. Padma likes that. Hermione never expects her to be perfect and to know the right way to respond.</p><p>She knows being with Hermione has made her more open. More caring.</p><p>At nights they used to read their separate books, but recently they’ve fallen into the habit of reading together. Hermione’s talent with enlargement charms has come in handy with their mountains of books and papers. If not for them, their home would be like a library with a bed, but now everything is tucked away neatly, categorized and alphabetized lovingly into shrunken shelves, from which Padma often picks out a well-worn book for the night.</p><p>Sometimes they read the <i>Quibbler</i> Luna sends all her friends for free and snicker at the articles, each more ludicrous than the last. More often, they read one of the many works of fiction Padma hauls home every day after work. She has found her love of fiction again – she’s slowly started to let go of the idea that every spare moment must be put to sensible use.</p><p>It’s more of a rule than an exception that Hermione dozes off; she works too hard at her numerous nonprofit organizations and her studies to which she would never bring less than her best self. A few pages in Padma begins to hear a small snoring against her shoulder, and she smiles to herself. She reads on for a few more pages, not minding that the words lose their meaning when she is distracted by swell of happiness in her stomach.</p><p> </p>
