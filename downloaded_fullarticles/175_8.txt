</p><p align="center"> </p><p>“Headmistress, conditions in the muggle world have gone from bad to worse. Our muggleborn students no longer have homes – or families – to return to.” Professor Hermione Granger was covered in sweat and dirt, the aftermath of her visit to muggle London. </p><p>“Can the muggles rebuild?” Professor McGonagall was looking over the school roaster, ticking off the names of all the muggleborn students currently in attendance at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.</p><p>“Not at the moment,” Professor Snape shook his head. “Until they stop the spread of the virus and clear the land of the reanimated they have no chance.”</p><p>“Right now the focus needs to be on collecting the survivors and providing them with refuge,” Professor Flitwick's tiny voice joined the conversation.  </p><p>“As much as it pains me to admit it, the muggles will die out if we don't intervene.” Snape sneered as he spoke. Spy for the light or not he would always have a distaste for the muggles thanks to his late father. “We know the Ministry won't be of much help. They're still rebuilding from the war.”</p><p>“I've heard rumors of a group of muggle survivors in America. They're tough but they don't seem to have lost their humanity like a lot of the others have. If we're going to be taking in survivors, we're going to need muggle leaders for them to look to.” Hermione slumped, exhausted, into the chair in front of Professor McGonagall's desk.</p><p>“Hermione, you locate this group,” Professor McGonagall ordered. “We'll figure out housing and Professor Snape can take over your classes in your absence.”</p><p>Hermione knew that Professor Snape wouldn't object. He never did when it came to anything relating to her. He owed her his life and whether he wanted to admit it or not, he also genuinely liked and respected her. </p><p>“Actually, Headmistress, given the current state of the muggle world I'd feel much safer if Professor Snape accompanied me.” Hermione would always feel safer with Professor Snape around. “I spoke to Harry via owl this morning and he's willing to take up the Defense Against the Dark Arts post in Professor Snape's absence. He said the Ministry wanted to station an auror here anyway until the end of this outbreak.”</p><p>“Better the devil you know,” Professor Snape smirked but Hermione let it slide. She knew from experience that Harry gave just as good as he got. There was no need to let him hide behind her metaphorical skirts. </p><p>“What about your classes, Hermione?” Professor McGonagall peered at her over the rim of her glasses. “Mr. Potter isn't qualified to teach Transfiguration. He barely passed it.”</p><p>“I know that she can be somewhat flighty but Luna Lovegood scored just as highly on the NEWT's as I did.” Hermione watched Professor Snape bite his lip and Professor Flitwick grimaced. “I also hear that Draco Malfoy is looking for a teaching position. Luna and Draco would balance each other out nicely and given the state of things, we're going to need all hands on deck anyway.”</p><p>“She's right, Minerva,” Professor Flitwick nodded. “If we're going to take in muggle survivors of the virus we're going to need all the help we can get.”</p><p>Professor McGonagall rubbed at her temples. “Alright, Hermione and Severus are to go to America to seek out this group of survivors. Filius, you are in charge of recruiting more staff. Start with Potter, Lovegood, and Malfoy. I'll speak with Hagrid and Mr. Filch about housing for all new arrivals.”</p><p>“You might also want to contact the Order to see about adding some extra security to the school and grounds. We're not sure if our current defenses will hold up against the reanimated,” Snape cautioned.</p>
