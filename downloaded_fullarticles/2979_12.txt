  <span>“Come on, Curse Breaker, you should really consider trying out for the team.  Hufflepuff could use someone with your flying skills,” Andre encouraged as the group of friends sat together at Gryffindor’s table in the Great Hall for lunch.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know, Andre.  Joining Quidditch would only take time away from solving the mystery of the next cursed vault,” Sapphire replied, hesitantly.  In all honesty, she would love to try out for Hufflepuff’s Quidditch team, but she knew she had to remain focused on finding her brother.  Between regular classes, tutoring with Professor Rakepick, and the occasional detention Sapphire Phillips just didn’t have time for any extracurricular activities.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ha, Phillips join the quidditch team?  Don’t you first need a </span>
  <em>
    <span>broom</span>
  </em>
  <span> first, Phillips?” Merula snidely commented as she passed by the table.  Sapphire glared in response while the Slytherin continued on to her table.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t let her get to you, Sapphire,” Charlie spoke up from his seat beside her, “I could always talk to Madam Hooch about borrowing a broom if you’re really interested.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thanks, Charlie,” Sapphire smiled up at the ginger, “but unfortunately, I can’t.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Can’t do what?” Bill Weasley inquired as he sat down in the empty spot on the bench next to Sapphire.  She quickly looked over to the newcomer, surprised by his sudden appearance. Bill had been absent quite often lately due to his studying for the N.E.W.T.S.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sapphire is refusing to try out for quidditch despite being one of the best flyers in our year,” Penny boasted proudly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Quidditch is so time consuming,” Bill nonchalantly began.  “You’d never have time to search for the rest of the vaults.  Besides, anyone can play quidditch but not everyone gets to break a curse at Hogwarts,” he finished with a smirk.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey!” Charlie and Andre cried in unison causing the rest of the group to laugh.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I need to get back to studying; was just taking a quick lunch break.  See you out on the grounds later?” Bill asked, lowering his voice as he leaned in a bit closer to Sapphire causing her cheeks to warm slightly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, I’ll be there.  Don’t study too hard,” she teased in reply.  Bill smiled softly, lifting his hand to gently brush her shoulder as he stood before making his way out of the hall.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sapphire watched as Bill left.  She then turned back to her friends to find them all silently staring at her with knowing smiles of their faces.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What?” she asked defensively.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You fancy Bill Weasley,” Penny noted, her smile growing in delight.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What?  No!” Sapphire quickly protested, her heart dropping in fear.  A light touch to her shoulder caused her to look beside her. The grin on Charlie’s face was much softer than the other’s.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s ok, Sapphire.  We won’t tell him,” Charlie promised.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Speak for yourself!” Andre excitedly exclaimed.  “You two would be perfect together. You’re a natural born curse breaker, and Bill is an adventure seeker-!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Andre,” Penny interrupted, “we are Sapphire’s friends.  If she wants to keep her crush on Bill a secret then we have to respect that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t have a crush!” Sapphire quickly retorted, despite it being an obvious lie.  Her three friends stared at her in silence for a few moments before Andre couldn’t take it anymore.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fine, but please remember to change out of your uniform before meeting him later.  Maybe something a little more-”</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Andre,”</span>
  </em>
  <span> Sapphire warned.  Andre held up his hands in surrender.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m just saying,” he mumbled, one side of his lips turned up in amusement.</span>
