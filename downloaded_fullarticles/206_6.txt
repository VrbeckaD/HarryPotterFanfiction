    <p>It was a bright June in London in contrary to its infamous gray weather. Everybody was in good spirits that day in June but especially Arthur Weasley and his sister-in-law Alice Prewett. Both have been working in Ministry of Magic for long years - Arthur almost ten years longer than Alice - and finally tonight, at the reception given by the ministry they were going to be rewarded for their hard work. Alice was a member of the Auror Office. She was considered as one of the best aurors of her age. On the other hand her brother-in-law was the Head of the Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office. Even though, this office was considered as unimportant and low class by many snobbish wizards and witches Arthur put a lot of effort in it and tonight he was going to be chosen as 'The Most Devoted Employee of the Year'. </p><p>Alice, on the other hand, was going to be awarded as 'The Most Valuable Employee of the Year' because of her immense contribution to stop crime in magical world. Thus, she and her son Damian were getting ready wearing their fanciest dresses and robes they have at their house in western London. </p><p>"Well, Miss Prewett, you deserve the best of everything obviously," said Damian "and as your only and <em>dearest</em> son, I thought I could get the best of gifts for you." he was holding a wrapped box in his hands and passed it to her mother.</p><p>"Damian..."</p><p>"C'mon mum, just open it. It'll look great on you tonight." </p><p>She unwrapped the box and opened it carefully. It was a ruby necklace in the shape of a lotus flower.</p><p>"It's beautiful, my darling." she was so touched by her son's gift and she was also proud of him, it wasn't easy nowadays to raise such a thoughtful young man. </p><p>"As I said, you deserve the best of everything."</p><p>"I already have the best son a mother can have, nothing more is required." she hugged her son. </p><p>She put the ruby necklace on, matching her silk scarlet dress. After hours of preparation, they were ready. She even had a speech prepared for the night. They were going to meet the Weasleys in the ballroom, they were seated together of course, along with their guests Harry Potter, Hermione Granger and Luna Lovegood. It was no question that Damian had feelings for Luna, so, he invited her for the night as his dame. </p><p>The room had an extremely high ceiling and it was decorated with candles, just like the Great Hall in Hogwarts. The walls were brown, there were many circular tables around the dance floor. An orchestra was playing classical music, people from ministry and members of aristocracy were greeting each other; some with fake smiles and some with non at all. Her sister and her family weren't there yet so Alice decided to head to their table with her son, greeting some of her colleagues on the way. </p><p>"Alice!" a familiar voice called to her. She followed it and turned around to answer the call. Her face went completely pale after seeing the owner of the voice. She was completely frozen and couldn't say anything, burying few seconds in silence. </p><p>"Lucius." she managed to say, as low as possible. "Didn't expect to see you here tonight." </p><p>The man looked in her eyes as if he wanted to read her soul through her dark brown eyes. "Well, I was personally invited by Mr. Fudge," he took a break "it'd be rude to reject his invitation.". Then his eyes slipped to the boy standing next to her. He had pale blonde hair with light blue eyes. He was quite tall and had smokey looks which charmed most of the girls around him. "And this young gentleman is?"</p><p>"My son..." she replied, scared of Lucius understanding that her son was actually <em>their </em>son. He didn't look like her at all; he got his eyes, hair, looks from his father. Something she both loved an hated because every time she looked at him, she remembered the man she loved; the father of her child. </p><p>Lucius' eyes opened widely as she replied. His suspicion was obvious. "I didn't know you were married." </p><p>"I wasn't." </p><p>"Who's the father?" </p><p>She could feel cold sweat running down her forehead. "You wouldn't know."</p><p>Then all that there was silence. Damian was aware that there was something weird but he didn't wish to interrupt. He wasn't even formally introduced to this man yet, even though he and her mum had been talking for some minutes. Then a young man and a woman approached.</p><p>"Prewett!" called the boy who had the same blonde hair.</p><p>"Malfoy." Damian replied.</p><p>They were Draco and Narcissa, son and wife of Lucius. One could tell the difference in Narcissa's looks the moment she saw Alice. </p><p>"Alice." she greeted her. </p><p>"Narcissa."</p><p>"Can't say it is a pleasure to be seen with you Prewett." Draco exclaimed "People might think that... that I am associating with blood traitors."</p><p>Damian giggled. "No wonder you looked uncomfortable mum. I didn't know we were having the honour to speak with Mr. Malfoy." Lucius didn't say anything. He was trying to comprehend. He knew that it was almost a hundred percent possible for this young man to be his son. Alice was his first and last love. Despite his father's protests they had long lasting relationship during their youth, until he became a Death Eater and Alice, an auror who was supposed to hunt them down. Especially after deaths of Alice's brothers Gideon and Fabian it was impossible for them to be together. Hence, she didn't mention Lucius anything about her pregnancy, neither before the war started nor afterwards. She couldn't find the courage to tell her son that his father was a Death Eater, even though her feelings for Lucius never faded. She instead told him that his father was a war hero, making up a name, and he died before they could get married so he had to take her surname. </p><p>"Mum?" Narcissa seemed to be disturbed. She also felt that there was something odd with the boy. She could see his similarity with her son and her husband. Plus, she had always been scared of Alice's existence. Many nights when her husband was drunk, he whispered her ear 'Alice' while they were in bed. And now this boy? If he actually was Lucius' son, he would be a problem. Draco would have to share Malfoy inheritance with him or worse she could have been thrown aside with Lucius' feelings for Alice were rekindled. She was even suspicious that if they needed to be rekindled.</p><p>"Yes, my son: Damien."</p><p>"Nice to meet you, <em>Damien</em>." Lucius offered his hand for him to shake. </p><p>"Nice to meet you, too, Mr. Malfoy."</p><p>Lucius looked deeper at the boy, he was dying to speak privately to Alice about it. He was trying to contact her for years. But every time he tried to visit her at her office, he was either told that she is busy or she wasn't there. She insisted on sending her gifts every Christmas, Easter, New Year and Valentine's Day; non of them replied, most of them returned. It was impossible to find her address because of high secrecy due to her being an auror yet here they were standing in a ballroom, with a boy next to her, he thought to be his own. And the woman he loved was as beautiful as the days they had been together.</p><p>Alice was trying to find a way to escape this conversation and awkward moment of silence. Then Weasleys made an entrance to the ballroom and her face was suddenly enlightened.</p><p>"Oh! My sister and her family are here! We better get going, love. Have a good evening." she grabbed Damien's arm and drove him towards the Weasleys. Luna, Harry and Hermione were also with them.</p><p>"What was that?"</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"The awkward conversation with Draco's father."</p><p>"Nothing baby. I just haven't seen him and his family for a long while."</p><p>"Whatever."</p><p>She hugged Molly tightly. She and her sister looked very different from each other. Unlike Molly's chubby and short structure, Alice was fit and rather tall. She was fancier compared to her sister. But they had an unbreakable bond and loved each other more than anything in the world. She considered her nephews and niece as her own children and care for them as much as she cared for Damien. She knew that Arthur was earning just enough to feed his family so she was always there to provide them with whatever they asked for. Her son was the same age as Fred and George and were closest with them. One would expect him to be more serious but whenever he was around the twins he'd also turn into a prankster and a trouble maker. </p><p>They made their way to their table. Alice could feel Lucius' eyes gazing at her and tried her best to not to respond to his looks. After all he was a married man now and she could never forget the things he had done in the past. Moreover, with Cedric Diggory dead this year during the tournament and the Dark Lord back as Harry claimed, she didn't have the luxury to associate with him. No matter how much she actually longed for it and how she wanted to tell him that Damien was their son. </p><p>The night passed quickly and awards were given. But she couldn't enjoy it as much as she expected because of her encounter with Lucius. One of the people who knew about the truth, Molly, was also aware of what was going on. "Why does he even make you stressful? He is just a memory of past. Don't let him ruin your present" she told her. But it wasn't that simple. She loved him, so much. How could she just ignore his existence? She managed to do it escaping from it for the last seventeen years but it was hard to handle it now after seeing him with her son and spending whole night in the same ballroom. </p><p>They were having a dinner almost as good as the feasts served in Hogwarts. Even while eating many wizards and witches were trying to show off with their manners which reminded Alice of her dinner with Lucius' parents at the Malfoy Manor. While they were still together, they agreed to meet her once for the sake of her blood line purity even though most pure-blood wizard families regarded Prewetts and Weasleys as blood traitors and her sister was married to Arthur Weasley for some years already. Both his parents were ice cold to her and all night they had spoken of their disapproval for Muggle-borns and those who associate with them. It was hard time for Alice since her best friend Lily Evans was a Muggle-born and her ideas on blood purity were completely different than theirs. However, she endured it that night for the sake of Lucius and did her best to avoid a scene with her beloved's parents. But no matter what she did, in the end they weren't able to have a happy end together. She could never forget Lucius for his loyalty for the dark side and for the fact that he made a 'proper' pure-blood marriage with Narcissa Black just to gain the approval of his family and community. Thinking of all these she felt dizzy for a moment and had an urge to go to bathroom to refreshen herself. It felt like she was sweating cold since her encounter with Lucius and his <em>family</em>.</p><p>She was happy to be out of the ballroom, at the silent corridor. But it didn't last long. Someone grabbed her wrist. She turned and saw the face she had been longing for years. </p><p>"Let me go." she tried to escape his grasp, even though she wasn't actually willing for it.</p><p>"Alice, wait!" he was breathing fast "We have to talk. I have tried to contact you for all these years. Now, I have a chance to speak with you. Don't just let it slip."</p><p>"Yes and there was a reason why you couldn't: because I didn't want to have anything to do with you," she was trembling "How dare you, Lucius? How dare you? After all that happened, after all we had been through and all crimes you committed, which you managed to get away with of course, how dare you speak to me?"</p><p>"You know very well that what happened had nothing to do with our relationship. I would never harm you or anybody close to you. I loved you Alice, and god knows I still do!"</p><p>She tried to ignore his confession of love but it broke her heart. "Nothing to do with us? Your <em>friends</em> killed my brothers Lucius. Your Lord killed my best friend and her husband. Their son, who is sitting at my table inside, was left an orphan; never having an opportunity to know them..." she wanted to tell him so much that their son had to grow up fatherless but she could never. "Then, you just settled back in your manor with your wife and son, as if nothing had happened!"</p><p>"I just fought for what I believed in, like you did." he was approaching her slowly "Is that what you blame me for? Then, do it. You are a talented pure-blood witch Alice! You could be with me, you could fight on our side instead of your mudblood friends and blood traitor family." </p><p>"Don't you dare call them those!" she pointed her index finger to his face. He grabbed her hand and then her waist, pulling her towards him. She was trying to fight but it was impossible, she could smell his amazing perfume and feel the heat of his body on hers. Their eyes were locked together and next his lips were melting on hers. It was as if they haven't been separate all those years, as if all was forgotten. Alice couldn't even find the will to not respond to his kiss. She was hugging him tighter as he was biting her lips, leading his tongue in her mouth; both were burning in desire. It felt like forever. Moans were escaping her throat with every touch of his, she could feel his hardness leaning on her body. Then they pulled back for a moment both panting. She pulled herself together and escaped his hold.</p><p>"This shouldn't have happened. Ever."</p><p>"Yes, but it did." he grabbed her arm again. "Now, please tell me, who is the father of your boy?"</p><p>"I told you already, you wouldn't know him."</p><p>"Truly? How old is he? He doesn't seem much younger than Draco."</p><p>"He's... he's a year older." she confessed.</p><p>Lucius took a deep breath. "He's <em>our</em> son isn't he?"</p><p>"He's <em>my </em>son!" she exclaimed.</p><p>"Really? No idea you could produce a child on your own. That's exactly the time we were last together Alice." she didn't respond. "I am not even going to mention how similar is his physical appearance to me." he was right in everything you said. </p><p>"Is this the place to talk about it?" </p><p>"I guess it is now. If you were kind enough to consider my efforts for us to meet and let me know about your pregnancy then it would be different." </p><p>It would be different. She thought of this for hours, days, weeks, months, years. She imagined her son growing up with his father, herself married to the man she loved. But it was too late even to think about this. </p><p>"How could I make my son know that his father is a Death Eater?"</p><p>"He would be thinking differently of many things if I could contribute to his upbringing."</p><p>"Maybe that's another reason why I have never told you."</p><p>"We have to meet." said Lucius "I really wish to talk to you and you should agree that I deserve this much at least."</p><p>Alice hesitated but she didn't think that she could say no. "Alright. Meet me at Rosa Lee Teabag in Diagon Alley, this Thursday."</p><p>"As you wish." he kissed her hand and head back to the ballroom. </p><p>When Alice went back to the ballroom, everybody was curious where she had been. Of course she couldn't tell anybody about how she and Lucius shared a passionate kiss like in the old days, how it was revealed that Damien was his son and their plans for meeting. So, the only thing she could tell was that it took a lot of time for her to find the bathroom despite Molly's suspicious looks. Her sister caught Lucius getting inside just few minutes before her and she was afraid that two of them were going to start an affair, unable to resist the attraction between them. She was sure that her sister would marry him if it weren't for him being a Death Eater, Voldemort's second in command. What happened to Lily Potter and their brothers made things even worse, without a doubt. </p><p>Alice could still feel Lucius' gaze on her and this time she wasn't able hold herself looking at him either. He was dashing in his first quality robes and his facial structure was flawless. She tasted his lips back in that hallway and now she was in need of them again. It wasn't enough to close the gap of all those long years. However, even though she has never liked Narcissa, she felt bad for her. She was married to a man who was never truly in love with her and always had to be in a relationship in which fear of Alice haunted her. Her son wasn't even her husband's first born and if the things were settled he would probably be the one to inherit the manor and most of the fortune. The boy looked like Lucius even more than Draco, despite Alice's darker looks. She could understand her and know she contributed to her pain by reappearing in her husband's life. But, what could she do? This wasn't something she asked for. For years she just stayed away from them and did whatever she could to hide her son's parentage. Though it was obvious that it'd be exposed one day and now that Lucius being aware of it, she very well knew that he'd want to see and talk with the boy. She had no clue how she was going to explain the situation to Damien; that Lucius was her father and Draco was his half brother -who he despised obviously-.</p><p> </p>
