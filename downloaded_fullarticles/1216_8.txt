    <p>Anger and loathing pulsed viscerally through Draco's veins as he stalked down the cobbled path of Diagon Alley. How dare Harry Fucking Potter, already the bane of his existence, talk to mother in that way! Like it wasn't enough that he had cost him his father and sullied the Malfoy name, but to outright disrespect his family in Madam Malkin's like that with the mudblood and blood traitor behind him! He'd show them! He'd show them all!</p><p> </p><p></p><div>
  <p>He noticed the stares and hushed voices that followed in his wake but feigned ignorance. It was annoying. Everywhere he went, he heard whispers of Lucius and the Dark Lord and Stupid. Fucking. Potter. The audacity that that decidedly mediocre plebeian would be mentioned in the same breath as someone as noble as his father or as great as the Dark Lord! It was laughable! Urgh, did no one else see Potter for what he really was: no more than a skilless but ridiculously lucky bastard with a questionable pedigree?</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
  <p>And, furthermore, why did people expect him to feel shame on behalf of his father or for their beliefs? Was it so bad to want to preserve pure blood status? No. Meanwhile, the light side would have everyone believe that the Dark Lord and his followers wanted to murder and pillage villages - which was ridiculous. Ok, so a few muggles might've gotten flown around in their knickers at the World Cup but, really, they were fine! And a message had to be sent. There's nothing like putting the fear of Merlin into people every once in a while to shift a movement, it's necessary! No one was getting killed or hurt unless they were stupid enough to get in the way of the Dark Lord. If they'd just lie down and get out the way, they'd be fine. And at that, he strengthened his resolve, lifted his chin up high and stalked off towards Knockturn Alley.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
  <p>As he turned towards Borgin and Burke's, he was briefly stirred from his thoughts when he thought he saw the air shimmer around him. He paused but, when he saw nothing, he simply pushed forward and his mind drifted back to the task at hand. He sighed. Why, oh why, couldn't Dumbledore be one of those people who just laid down and got out of the way? The weight of what the Dark Lord had asked him to do settled like lead in his stomach. He knew that Mother feared that he had been given the task with the expectation that he would fail and to punish father for his failures. Draco refused to think this. He was clever and cunning and he could figure this out and gain the favor of the Dark Lord in this new world order along the way. No, he didn't <em>want</em> to kill anyone, yet alone the old man, but he did understand why it needed to be done. If Dumbledore was the only thing standing in the way of progress, then he would just have to be a casualty of the war, he justified. Thus, Draco had given Narcissa the slip to put his plan into motion. He would claim redemption for father! For the Malfoy name and for their cause!</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><hr/><p>  </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><div>
  <p>Seeing Malfoy and Narcissa in Madam Malkin's relit a spark in Harry that he hadn't realized had gone out in the first place. Watching Sirius fall through that veil mere weeks before had left him feeling barely there. While being at the Burrow had helped, the constant news of disappearances on top of his grief could barely keep away the numbness that threatened to take over his mind and limbs. He was sure the dementor fog that seemed to constantly permeate the air these days didn't help but, as it were, it just felt too overwhelming to think about the heartbreaking sadness of losing his godfather, the soul crushing guilt that came with knowing that it was all his fault (no matter what anyone said to the contrary), or the monumental weight of knowing that it was all up to him to somehow end it all when time and time again he couldn't even save the people he cared about. Numbness was easier.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>  </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Now Malfoy -- Malfoy was someone safe for him to point his hurt and anger towards! After the incident in the robe shop and seeing Malfoy give Narcissa the slip, Harry was convinced that the pointy git was up to no good. While Ron and Hermoine agreed with him, they were firmly in the "whatever it is, he's not worth the mental energy" camp. Harry, on the other hand, couldn't think of a better way to spend his mental energy at the moment so when he saw Malfoy turn down Knockturn Alley, he couldn't resist throwing on his invisibility cloak and following. He felt a little guilty about dashing off before Ron and Hermoine could protest but he didn't want to lose him and he'd surely be right back before they or Hagrid could worry too much. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>  </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Harry watched as Malfoy threatened Borgin and he became more convinced than ever that the stupid git had actually joined the Death Eaters. Was he really that daft and elitist to do such a thing? Harry sighed as he mentally answered his own question. Harry had always had Malfoy pegged as woefully naive and ignorant when it came to Death Eater values but maybe he did get it and really was a truly evil bastard...  Harry didn't know, but he was determined to find out. It was probably a bad thing that this got him excited but the thrill of the mystery was at least tangible.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>It wasn't long before the shop bell rung with a dull ding and the door swung open again. Malfoy whistled as he walked along the cobbled path of Knockturn Alley and Harry followed quietly. He could've sworn that Malfoy had almost caught sight of him earlier and the last thing he needed was a confrontation in the shadiest fucking place in all of wizarding London. As if he had read Harry's mind, Draco stopped mid whistle and spun around abruptly, arm reaching out and spinning away with the invisibility cloak in hand, leaving Harry woefully exposed.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>  </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Ha! I thought that was you, Potter!" He snarled. "What is it, you perv? Thought you'd follow me home and catch me in a wank?"</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Harry glared back in response before rolling his eyes. Already caught, he figured he might as well go for the straight forward approach.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>  </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Why are you in Knockturn Alley, Malfoy?"</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Wouldn't you like to know? What I'm more curious about is what happens when the righteous, golden-chosen prat wanders into places that he doesn't belong because he feels entitled to other people's business?" He practically purred. "Huh. Looks like father's revenge might come much sooner than I'd ever hoped!"</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Harry's eyes narrowed and his fist tightened around his wand. He thought about Lucius and the ministry and Bellatrix and Narcissa taunting him about Sirius in Madam Malkin's. His magic pulsed through him, seething red hot and barely controllable. "Look, you miserable death eater spawn! I truly hope your dear father enjoys his slow decline into insanity in Azkaban until the rest of your putrid family joins him." He nearly growled.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>  </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Malfoy's eyes gleamed with something menacing and his pupils widened infinitesimally at his words. His wand hand twitched but then his mouth worked into a slow smirk. "I should be hexing you to Hades, Potter, but... it looks like I've got a new cloak and I think it'd be more fun to leave you to the wolves."</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Harry filled with rage as the cloak twirled through the air with a flourish and Malfoy disappeared with a chuckle. Just as he raised his wand to aim at the spot where Malfoy had last been, Harry heard a deep voice behind him shout: "Expeliarmus!"</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>The force of the unexpected spell knocked him forward on hands and knees as his wand flew from his hand and a second voice boomed "Petrificus totalus!"</p>
</div><div>
  <p>  </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Shit! You were right, Rowle!" The approaching footsteps stopped next to him and a bulking man with a brutal face appeared in front of him, eyes flying wide as he searched out the scar. "It really is Potter! Let's alert the Dark Lord! We shall be rewarded greatly for this!"</p>
</div><div>
  <p>  </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Shit.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>  </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Hold off, Yaxley! Don't press it yet!" Harry couldn't turn his head to look but he imagined Yaxley's hand hovering over the Dark Mark. He could almost hear the smirk in Rowle's voice as he continued. "Let's have a little fun first!"</p>
</div><div>
  <p>  </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Shit.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><div>
  <p>Draco watched from underneath the cloak as Yaxley and Rowle each grabbed Potter underneath an arm, still frozen in that stupid position with that shocked look on his face, and carried him off back into the building from which they'd come.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Well, that was quick." He huffed, reveling in the irony of his last words. He shifted from foot to foot uneasily for a moment. He turned to leave but then turned back to stare after the three. Why should he care? His father's friends were about to turn Potter over to the Dark Lord and he should be jumping for joy because that's what he deserved! ...It was, in fact, the natural order of things, right? He shifted uncomfortably again, his face screwed up in thought. Potter was another one of those stubborn idiots who seemed incapable of just lying down and getting out of the Dark Lord's way so who cared if he'd probably die? And so what if he was barely 16 and Draco had known him for 5 years and he was Draco's favorite person to hate? He deserved what he got, right?</p>
</div><div>
  <p>  </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Right." He nodded invisibly and then cursed himself as he walked off towards the apothecary that the 3 had vanished into.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Draco slid carefully through the door, biting back a curse as his foot caught and the shifty shop owner looked through him in confusion. He walked through rows of dubious potions ingredients with no sight or sound of Potter or his captors. Finally, he reached 2 doors near the back of the shop and paused when he heard the buzzing sound of a cast <em>muffliato</em> coming from one of them.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>  </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"<em>Alohamora</em>," he whispered and let out a hushed sigh of relief when the door actually clicked open and revealed a staircase leading to the basement below. As he eased down the stairs and past the barrier of the silencing charm, he could hear Yaxley and Rowle once more.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>  </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Looky looky. What a sight we have here!" came Yaxley's haughty voice. "You like cock don't you, Mr. Potter?"</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>......What?</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Draco froze on the stairs. Clearly he had to have misheard. Surely, a respected ministry official and beloved friend and colleague of his father was not propositioning his schoolmate for sex. That was absurd. But then he heard the unmistakable sound of a hand smacking hard against flesh and Rowle practically growl with excitement.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"The Chosen One, huh? <em>Crucio</em>!" Draco didn't hear any screams so assumed Harry must still be paralyzed. "How 'bout I rip that pretty little arse of yours apart? Give you a last hoorah before the Dark Lord rips your last breath from your lungs."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>  </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Draco couldn't resist and quietly rushed down the last of the steps, filling with panic at what he saw before him. There was no propositioning. Potter was, indeed, still frozen from the immobilization spell and he'd been bent across a plush looking armchair in the middle of the shopkeeper's potions room. His clothes had clearly been vanished as he was stark naked with his arse stuck in the air. Yaxley stood in front of him while Rowle braced himself behind, both men with their robes opened and trousers around their ankles. Draco felt a flush flame across cheeks and down his neck and chest.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Draco walked silently around the room. He didn't know why, but he needed to see Potter's face. It was still frozen in that shocked look, his black hair as disarrayed as always. Draco thought he could see horror in his bright green eyes as Yaxley used his fingers to widen his jaw. Draco winced when it resulted in an audible crack and a ghost of a scream came from Potter's throat. That meant that the spell was showing signs of wearing off if his vocal chords were starting to move. It didn't matter though because in that next moment, Yaxley had shoved his old, pulsing cock inside of Harry's mouth almost at the same time that Rowle rammed his own too huge cock roughly into his arse. Harry's eyes grew wider in pain and terror and his screams grew louder though they were now muffled around Yaxley.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Draco could not believe that this was happening. It felt like a surreal, out-of-body experience only heightened by the fact that he was invisible. He was just almost at the point of convincing himself that this was some weird, fucked up, twisted dream when Rowle started in on Harry with a punishing rhythm which, unlubricated, had resulted in a trickle of thick, red blood to roll down Potter's thigh. He had the sudden urge to reach out and place a calming hand on Potter's back to let him know that he wasn't alone and it would be ok. No, he couldn't dream this. He'd dreamed of Potter before but those dreams were pleasant, if not, disconcerting -- no, his mind could never make something like this up because he wouldn't wish this on his worst enemy, even if that <em>was</em> Harry Potter.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Could he stop this without revealing himself? He still had the trace on him for another year and couldn't risk his magical signature being traced back to this place if he was... What? If he was seriously thinking about acting against the Dark Lord and helping Harry Fucking Potter? Was that what he was doing? Technically he just wanted to stop 2 vile and disgusting human beings from doing something he was sure the Dark Lord himself would surely disapprove of... Who was he kidding? This was tantamount to suicide. </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Fuck my life," he thought.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>  </p>
</div><div>
  <p>He knew that under normal circumstances the ministry might not look into it too much since there were at least 3 other of-age wizards who could be the caster (including the shopkeep upstairs) but he highly doubted that Yaxley wouldn't go to the ends of the earth to figure out exactly who'd been here if he were foiled by the obvious use of magic from an invisible force. There was a fireplace in the far corner and a jar of what looked like floo powder on the mantle. It was the closest thing if he really had to drag Potter's arse out of there but that would be tricky and they could be easily tracked. He looked around for a distraction and just as he noticed the 3 wands atop a nearby bookshelf and started to come up with a plan, he heard something that first made him want to retch and then made his blood boil.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Too bad Lucius isn't here, he would've loved this!" Rowle got out between grunts, his thighs smacking against Harry's bare skin and not seeming to care that his cock was now covered in the boy's blood.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Yaxley had more control as he fucked Harry's mouth slowly, relishing the way the movement of his cock in Harry's slack jaw made drool dribble out the corner of his mouth and pool on the arm of the chair. He carded a hand through the messy black hair in a way that could've been mistaken for gentle and not mocking were the circumstances not so cruel. </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Yes. Lucius has always seemed to enjoy this particular form of torture with young muggle men, he no doubt would have found this to be the sweetest revenge for our dear Harry Potter." He almost purred, his voice hitching.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Draco cringed and felt his flush reach his ears. At first from embarrassment and then from rage. For the first time, he looked down at his left forearm in disgust and wondered what in the fuck had he gotten himself into? Were all the godawful things people said about death eaters true? And father?! His father was a part of this foul depravity?! Did he not care? Did he not care about mother?!</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Draco felt weak but when he looked back over at Potter, he noticed that his legs had started to twitch and his face had started to screw up in pain. He knew then that it was almost time to act. He walked over to the bookshelf and held his breath as he reached up on tip toes to grab the three wands, praying that the death eaters were too preoccupied to see either his shoes or the floating wands before he could secure them underneath the cloak.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Oh, yes! That's it!" Yaxley was gripping Potter's hair painfully as Harry pushed forcefully against his thighs with his forearms. "I like a good fight!" He hissed, slamming his hips against Harry's flushed and sweaty face as he finished in his mouth with a loud cry and a shudder. He pulled out gingerly, spraying the last of his load across Harry's now too red lips as he spluttered and spat. That seemed to be enough to tip Rowle over the edge as well, his head tipping back and a garbled moan escaping his throat as he buried himself deeper inside Harry before stilling.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Harry fell forward and started to push himself up. Draco walked around the back of the chair so that he'd hopefully be slightly out of earshot but still close enough to cover Potter quickly. He silently prayed that there'd be no way to trace him while using a different wand and pointed Rowle's wand from underneath the folds of the cloak and aimed it at the corner of the room furthest from their exit.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Incendio!" He whispered frantically.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>One of the bookshelves along the wall there instantly started to smoke.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"What in the?" Yaxley howled, letting go of Harry's hair, eyes searching for his wand. Rowle was a beat behind him but the fire was spreading quickly with so many flammable books, parchments, and ominous potions ingredients littered about the room. They gave up on the wand search to try to put it out manually, pants still around their ankles.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Draco swooped down upon Potter with the cloak, covering his mouth so he wouldn't scream in fright and pressing his wand into his hand. The look in Potter's eyes as they raked Draco's changed from fright to confusion to hope in a matter of seconds. And just like that, his Gryffindor instincts had kicked in and he was up on his feet, a tad wobbly, but Draco held onto his waist and Harry wrapped an arm around his shoulders and they were running towards the stairs.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Wait! Where'd he go?! Where's Potter?!" Rowle bellowed.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>But it was too late. Neither Draco nor Harry looked back as they ran up the steps or through the shop or down Knockturn Alley or even as they pushed carelessly through the crowds of Diagon Alley, covered by the cloak and stopping only when they were breathless behind the Leaky Cauldron.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>It was then that Draco finally let go of Harry's waist and the other boy removed his arm from his shoulder to wrap his bare chest in a hug with one arm and cover his privates with the other. Without a second thought, Draco removed his good robes (incredibly gratefully that he'd actually worn clothes underneath it today) and wrapped it around Potter, buttoning it with deft fingers as they stayed carefully concealed underneath the invisibility cloak. He looked into his eyes and realized that, ever the cavalier Gryffindor, he had never once seen Potter cry. Not even the time when all his bones were removed from his arm or that time he fell 100 feet off his broom. But right now, though his face was carefully blank, tears streamed unbidden from the boys eyes. It was just enough to make Draco's heart ache but then, voices from the Leaky Cauldron reminded Draco of the reality of the situation.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Shit! No one can know that I helped you or I'm dead!"</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Harry looked pained for a second but then his face went blank again.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Right." The tears stopped abruptly, taking Draco aback. "This didn't happen."</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"What?" Draco asked, dumbfounded.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"None of this happened." He repeated, straightening his back and his eyes going weirdly void. "You didn't help me, I didn't see you, and I'm fine because nothing happened. Let's never speak of this again."</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Something about this didn't seem right to Draco but he had to get away from this place and find mother quickly before anyone could become suspicious. Potter was giving him an easy out here so he searched his blank eyes one more time before saying: "Ok. Take care, Potter."</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><hr/><p>  </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><div>
  <p>Draco ducked out from underneath the invisibility cloak and immediately lost sight of Harry. He briefly wondered where the other boy would go right now but told himself that he would be alright and that it wasn't his problem before turning back towards the brick wall. He was startled, however, when moments later Potter reappeared, suddenly throwing the cloak off with a flourish.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Why in the <em>fuck</em> am I wearing a sheet over my head?" he said, tossing the cloak to the ground and making Draco's eyes widen in disbelief. He looked around in confusion and paused once he caught sight of Draco.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>  </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Excuse me, mate, where am I? Do you know how to get to South Kensington?"</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"What are you playing at Potter?" Draco spat.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Potter? Wait, do I know you? It's Pots -- Harold Pots." he said, holding out a hand towards Draco which he took out of pure bemusement. "Are you at university, too? I'm studying psychology there." </p>
</div><div>
  <p>  </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Draco was just concluding that the boy was taking the piss when Potter looked down at his robes and frowned.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Sorry -- why am I dressed like I'm in a bloody choir and holding a stick?" he asked, screwing his face up in confusion and tossing his wand near the rubbish bin. "You must think I'm a complete ponce."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>  </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Draco's jaw dropped as his eyes followed the wand.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>  </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Have you lost your bloody mind?!"</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Right you are!" Potter laughed in earnest before straightening up and grinning. "I think my mates must just be taking the Mickey. We were having drinks after a game of rugby and it's no secret I can't hold my whiskey. This isn't the first time I've wound up someplace strange and not known how." he said, patting his pockets searchingly. "Shit, I don't have any money on me. Is that Charring Cross Road? I've got to get back to uni! I'm sore as all hell from that match, maybe I'll just grab a hotel for the night until one of those shitheads can come grab me tomorrow. I may not have any cash on me but I do have some god awful bloke named Vernon Dursley's credit card memorized for times like this!"</p>
</div><div>
  <p>  </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Draco was finding it very hard to pick his jaw up off the ground. Something was wrong. Something was very, very wrong. No wizard with even a hint of self-preservation would throw their wand in with the rubbish, not even as a joke! And especially not in these times -- no. This was just great. Harry Potter had literally just lost his fucking mind and Draco Malfoy was the only witness.  </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>He looked at Harry who seemed confused but utterly oblivious to the fact that yet another outrageously fucked up thing had happened to him. This had to be some type of bizarre coping mechanism and Draco wondered what would happen when reality all came crashing back to him. Harry started to walk off towards the street, limping gingerly. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>  </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Wait!" He called out and Potter stopped. </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Draco wavered, conflicted. He had thought his deciding moment in the upcoming war would be whether or not he was actually able to kill Albus Dumbledore. Instead, it now all seemed to come down to whether or not he'd let an injured, addled brain Harry Potter wander off into muggle London alone.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>  </p>
</div><div>
  <p>He sighed.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><hr/><p>  </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><div>
  <p>"Potter." The blonde boy said again. </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Nah, mate, it's Pots. You're close though... You know, I suppose Potter could work as a nickname if you really wanted it to." He pondered, realizing that he'd probably never see this kid again in his life so what did it really matter what he called him?</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Blondie just tilted his head at him in contemplation, his light grey eyes searching. </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Harry?" He tried again, wistfully. </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Harold." He corrected anyways. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>  </p>
</div><div>
  <p>At that, the blonde boy walked up to him and grabbed him by the shoulders, grey eyes staring intently into his own. </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Harry." The boy stressed again. He didn't know why this was making him feel so uncomfortable but he had to look away. "No, look at me." He insisted, reaching out and tilting his chin upward.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"What are you... What is going..." he faltered as he stared back into the grey eyes. Then the boy was wiping at his tear stained cheek with his thumb while his fingers gently cupped his face. When had he been crying? He closed his eyes and leaned into the touch as something flickered painfully into consciousness. "Draco?"</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Harry... something bad happened to you and I think you are dissociating." Harry screwed up his face at that but kept his eyes shut. </p>

  <p>"No, I need you to look at me. Stay with me, now." He commanded. Harry obeyed, reluctantly finding peace in those grey eyes. He felt raw and vulnerable and Draco was standing way too close and it felt suffocating and safe all at the same time. Draco continued to search his eyes until he apparently found what he was looking for and his hand finally dropped to his side. </p>

  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"You can't fall apart right now, Potter. What kind of supposed savior are you? Don't you know you at least have to wait until after the war to crack up? Honestly!" He said, rolling his eyes. Now that sounded more like Draco Malfoy.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"I don't know what to.... How to...." He choked. "Just... Thanks, Draco. For everything."</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Draco rolled his eyes again before he ran his hand through his hair and began to pace slightly hysterically. "What has become of my life? Rescuing and giving pep talks to Harry Fucking Potter! I will surely be killed for this! I've probably just got my whole family murdered." He muttered. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>  </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Harry cocked his head to the side thoughtfully as he studied Malfoy. </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Hey, Malfoy? Why choose to be on the side of someone who would kill you?"</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Malfoy stopped his pacing and frowned in thought. </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"And why be on a side where people..." he swallowed hard, unable to finish the sentence. He couldn't acknowledge what they'd done to him. Not yet. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>  </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Malfoy's face softened and Harry saw what looked like sadness and defeat flicker there before he put on his best damnable Malfoy mask and smirked.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"What does it matter, Potter? It's too late." He shrugged, deftly walking backwards towards the brick wall. </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Harry frowned in confusion. "What do you mean it's too late?"</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"As you've so kindly pointed out, I have chosen the side that has no qualms about killing and I do so like to live." He turned to tap his wand to the bricks, looking back over his shoulder at Harry right before he touched the final brick. "Good luck, Potter. I do hope you survive. Or... at the very least, that I'm not the one that has to kill you." He smirked. </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"I hope you survive, too, Malfoy."</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>And at that, Malfoy disappeared into Diagon Alley. </p>
