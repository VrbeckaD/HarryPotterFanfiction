          <div class="userstuff"><p>“Dance with me!” Luna giggled, tugging Ginny out onto their back patio.</p>
<p>“Luna!” Ginny squeals. “Can’t we do this inside?”</p>
<p>Rain is pouring down fast and hard outside, but Luna doesn’t care. She loves the rain, always has since she was a kid. Splashing in puddles, finding worms and making mud pies were just a few of the things she loved to do. But something about dancing made everything better. She loved how the rain seemed to dance <em>with</em> her, the wind whipping the rain droplets around, splashing them everywhere.</p>
<p>“What’s the fun in that?” Luna asked.</p>
<p>“But we don’t even have any music!” Ginny protested as she was lead out, past the awning and out onto the wet grass. Immediately she was soaked head to toe and she squealed. “Luna!”</p>
<p>“Shh!” Luna hummed, grabbing Ginny by the hands and leading her to the center of their backyard. Luna didn’t have on any shoes, her feet covered in mud, but she was unfazed, as she began to twirl Ginny around in a circle. “We <em>do</em> have music,” Luna said, as she began to hum to the sound of the rain falling down.</p>
<p>Ginny laughed, allowing Luna to twirl her around a couple times, before turning and leading Luna into a kind of a waltz. The ground was soft and mushy under their feet, Ginny’s slippers ruined, but she couldn’t find the need to care anymore. Luna continued to hum, giggling every now and then when Ginny would dip her down low or place a kiss against her cheek.</p>
<p>“See?” Luna said in that dream like voice of hers. “Much better than dancing in the house,”</p>
<p>Ginny couldn’t argue with that. Maybe the rain isn’t so bad after all.</p></div>
