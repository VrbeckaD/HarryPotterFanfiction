    <p>The Boy Who Lived was a boy with very messy hair, Rose thought upon first seeing him. Of course, she had not realized it was him but just a very skinny boy, with messy black hair and sparkling green eyes. Yes, he seemed to be alone and very amazed by everything—probably a mudblood. She did not approach him because of this conclusion—she could only think of her father’s reaction. It was her brother who said something to him.<br/>
<br/>
"Hello," Draco had said, "Hogwarts, too?"<br/>
<br/>
Draco and Rose were left in the robes’ shop by their parents, whom had left to pick up their children’s books and they would all meet up to acquire wands. The twins took turns to have their robes altered, Rose’s needing to be very precisely made at her very small frame. She was a good inch or two shorter than the average witch, aged 11. She was now looking at headbands that matched the robes she had already been placed for, wondering if she would be able to cut her hair a slight bit to have no need for any headband but knew it was not plausible. Her mother adored her long, silvery blonde hair that matched hers. She had been looking on through the hairpieces when the skinny, black haired boy stepped into the shop.<br/>
<br/>
Her eyes moved swiftly from his guardian that moved along the street walk and back to the boy. He moved forward, seeming very nervous to be on his own in a shop. There wasn’t any crowd in the shop, most kids having gotten their uniforms earlier in the morning. "Hogwarts, dear?" the witch working asked. "Got the lot here—another young man being fitted up just now, in fact.”<br/>
<br/>
The boy moved along with her and stood on the stool next to Rose’s twin and Rose moved closer to her brother. “Hello,” Draco offered.
“Hogwarts, too?”<br/>
<br/>
"Yes," said he boy.<br/>
<br/>
"Our father’s next door buying our books and mother's up the street looking at wands," Draco said, nodding to Rose. The boy’s eyes glanced to her and she smiled lightly, concluding that, yes, he was definitely a mudblood not to recognized the two siblings. "Then we’re going to go look at the racing brooms. I don't see why first years can't have their own. My sister and I practice enough not to get ourselves killed enough that I think my father will buy us one and my sister will smuggled them in. She’s very good at finding ways to sneak things.” Rose rolled her eyes—it was true, but it sounded like he was boasting.<br/>
<br/>
"Have you got your own broom?" Rose asked him.<br/>
<br/>
"No," said Harry.<br/>
"Do you play Quidditch at all?" She was sure he was a mudblood if he answered no—most kids were all familiar with the rules and tactics.<br/>
"No," The boy said and confirmed her conclusion of him being mudbood.<br/>
<br/>
"Our mum taught us—she was captain in her days.” Rose said proudly.<br/>
<br/>
“Father says it's a crime if we’re not picked to play for our house, and I must say, I agree. Know what house you'll be in yet?"<br/>
<br/>
"No," said the boy again. Rose started feeling bad. Draco would not let him off if he did not reply.<br/>
<br/>
"Well, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know I'll be in Slytherin, all our family have been -- imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think I'd leave, wouldn't you?" Draco said with an amused laughed.<br/>
<br/>
“I wouldn’t mind being in either Ravenclaw or Gryffindor.” Rose said thoughtfully. All her tutors had told her she’d been good among the wise Ravenclaw, though apparently they were the worst at academics. She was aiming for prefect though, so she prioritized academics. She imagined her father’s smile and congratulations once she did become prefect. “I do like the Gryffindor colors.” She added. She had always enjoyed the bold colors and thought they suited their values well—brave and bold. She didn’t think herself to be described as so but oh well. She wouldn’t belong there either way. “They don’t suit my hair though,” She whispered sullenly.<br/>
<br/>
“You’re hair’s nice,” the boy said and she smiled once more at him. Mudblood or not, he was nice enough.<br/>
<br/>
"I say, look at that man!" Draco exclaimed suddenly, nodding toward the front window. The man that had left the boy was back, now holding two large cones of ice creams.<br/>
<br/>
“Ooh, Draco I’m gonna ask Mum for ice cream—would you like some?” Rose asked, smiling at the prospect. They didn’t usually have the creamy dessert at home and only had some on birthdays and holidays.<br/>
<br/>
"That’s not what I meant—look at him, Rose, he seems like an entire bloke to me.”<br/>
<br/>
“That's Hagrid," said the boy with a sense of pride. "He works at Hogwarts." At this, she glanced at the man again. He didn’t seem like any professor, not with his mountain hiker appearance, but didn’t think it impossible.<br/>
<br/>
“Isn’t he some sort of assistant?” Rose questioned, remembering what her father had said of the man—this man did not seem as if though he belonged in Hogwarts. She’d been taught that anyone respectable must look respectable. This man did not, with a long mane of shaggy black hair and a beard that covered most of his face and very ungroomed.<br/>
<br/>
"No," Draco said, "No, I hear he's a sort of servant, isn't he?"<br/>
<br/>
"He's the gamekeeper," The boy said, and there seemed to be a fine edge of irritation laced through his voice.<br/>
<br/>
“He seems rather—” Rose tried but Draco interrupted her.<br/>
<br/>
“Like a savage to me. I heard he is, anyway. He lives in a hut on the school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic, and ends up setting fire to his bed." He told the boy.<br/>
<br/>
"Surely he’s not a savage, Draco. Not if Professor Dumbledore has hired him.” Rose said with indifference—as long as she didn’t need to deal with any class he wouldn’t teach, she was fine with him only as gamekeeper.<br/>
<br/>
“I think he's brilliant," said the boy coldly. Rose watched him carefully, and then wondered why he was with the man named Hagrid. She had heard of his name highly associated with the headmaster, so why had he come with some random boy, a mudblood boy…unless she had judged too quickly. Was he mudblood? He was wearing a strange assortment of oversized muggle clothing and big glassed, half hidden under his hair and then something else hidden under his hair—her eyes widened. Was this…?<br/>
<br/>
"Do you?" Draco sneered. "Why is he with you? Where are your parents?"<br/>
<br/>
"They're dead," The boy said, confirming who he actually was.<br/>
<br/>
"I’m sorry," Rose said before Draco could say anything furtherly stupid. “Was your father a pureblood, by chance?” She asked, hopping she didn’t sound obvious.<br/>
<br/>
“I don’t know—I know both my parents were a witch and wizard, if that's what you mean." He said indifferently. She nodded, averting her eyes from his green ones.<br/>
<br/>
"I really don't think they should let the other sort in, do you? They're just not the same, they've never been brought up to know our ways.<br/>
Some of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, imagine. I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families.” She recognized their father speaking and looked down. “What's your surname, anyway?"<br/>
But before Harry (she knew his name was) could answer, Madam Malkin said, "That's done, my dear," and Draco hopped down from the footstool.<br/>
<br/>
"Well, I'll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose," he said, taking a step but stopping, waiting for his sister.<br/>
<br/>
“I’ll be right out,” She said, nodding to the hair pieces. “Tell Father I’ll be but a minute.” Draco nodded, threw one more glance at Harry, who was now rather quiet, and walked up and out the shop.<br/>
<br/>
For a moment, she stared at the headband. Then, as she heard Madam Malkin walk out to the back for something, she turned quickly. “I’m sorry if my brother was rude—and I’m sorry about your parents. James and Lily Potter was it?” She smiled lightly, brandishing her dimples. “I hear they were superb wizards. Very well liked—I hope we could friends in Hogwarts.” She offered her hand and he did not shake it, seeming very surprised. She dropped her hand. “My name is Rose, Rosemary. Your parents were Gryffindor, by the way. I wasn’t sure if you knew or not.”<br/>
<br/>
He stayed quiet. She nodded, still smiling.<br/>
<br/>
“You father won the Quidditch cup, my mother says she played against him more than once. She played too.”<br/>
<br/>
Again, silence. He stared at her with green eyes, and she stared back. Finally, she turned, put three headbands down with Draco’s robes and turned again. “I hope to see you on the train.”<br/>
<br/>
And she hoped she hadn’t turned too red when she left the shop. God, why did she talk so much? Why couldn’t she leave the poor boy alone? He probably thought she was a nutter—and if her father found out? Oh God.<br/>
<br/>
She found her mother before she found her brother or father. She brushed down her hair as they made their up one shop to the wand shop, where her brother was already in the midst of getting his picked. Her father turned at their appearance. “Robes chosen?” She nodded. “I should assume you picked out the green pieces?” She nodded once more. “I want to see you two wear them neatly. You will not be the two who will bring shame to our family name.” Rose, once more, nodded.<br/>
<br/>
To both the children’s joy, they did end up getting ice cream to their mother’s suggestion and talked over the Slytherin common room expectations. “It’s a tradition to learn sign language, as the house is right under the lake, and there is a wall that overlooks the lake. The mer-people sometimes come to the window and we can only communicate by using sign language. You’ll find it very useful, trust me, my flower.” Her mother said, stroking her hair.<br/>
<br/>
She was often told she was a perfect picture of her mother, with a long waterfall of white hair, porcelain skin and handsome blue eyes that shifted shades from grey to dark sapphire. She tied her hair like her mother did, and was taught every up do by her mother. She was rather good at it, and found it very fun. She also liked her hair up, it was so pretty. Being told she looked like her mother was one of the greatest compliments she could receive.<br/>
<br/>
The summer stretched out for Rose and Draco with tutors and Quidditch practice with their mum, putting on their robes and practice with small spells with their new wands. Rose was very good with potions, and very good with identifying most potions. She’s also very good with weather magic, and elemental magic. She often practiced her earth magic of the elemental magic in the garden, and after hours, as to not be caught by her father. He had inquired on more than one account how weak and useless earth magic was, especially floral. She didn’t think her magic was limited to just earth magic, but she didn’t dare try practicing any other element.<br/>
September first was quickly drawing closer and closer, with every morning came hotter and hotter until it was the last week of August. Rosemary, in the garden with floral prints both at her feet and on her dress, was wasting away her afternoon with her books. The study of flowers was something her brother teased her about being such a feminine practice that she kept it hidden. Though she and Draco promised to not tell on each other since the great incident of breaking their mum’s broom. Rose had made a good time of mending it and Draco had made good at distracting and evading.<br/>
<br/>
“Practicing, are we?” Narcissa Malfoy inquired, stepping into the garden and spotting her young daughter. Rosemary looked up as her mother approached and stood, clasping her hands together and nodding. Her mother laughed, stroking her hair lovingly, pushing back strands of silvery hair behind her ears, showcasing her new earrings. “Oh, my lovely girl, tell me of your worries.”<br/>
<br/>
Rosemary usually was very good in showing other people what she wanted, but her emotion barrier seemed to melt away around her mother and father—her mother had a more talent in reading it. “Your lips always pout,” was the explanation of how she knew she was in deep thought. Now, it was much too easy.<br/>
<br/>
“I was just…” Rosemary sighed. “Worrying about the—well, the Sorting Ceremony.”<br/>
<br/>
The Sorting Ceremony took place on the evening of arrival of all Hogwarts students, but only involved the first years. The Sorting Hat would be placed upon their heads and sort them by looking through their heads and deciding where amongst the four houses they belonged. “Ah,” Her mother nodded, trailing towards a stone bench amongst the red roses, “And what about the Sorting Ceremony?” She trailed her hands amongst the roses, touching it only with her fingertips.<br/>
<br/>
“Well,” Rosemary started, looking at her feet. This was her mother—the closest person she had, the one who always made her feel better about herself when she failed at reaching her father’s expectations, the person who got her her favorite chocolate on Sunday mornings and who taught her to plat Quidditch. But her mother was also Slytherin and was very proud of being one. “Well, I’m not sure I’ll be placed in Slytherin.”<br/>
<br/>
She awaited a wrath but found none. Looking up, she saw her mother smiling still. “Yes, I can understand that fear.” She picked her a rose, and held her other arm out for her. Rose went immediately to her side and let her place the white rose in her hair with enchantment. “I was too, when my own Sorting came. Nervous as a cat, I was. I knew my place as a Slytherin, my entire family were Slytherins. But for a moment, the Sorting Hat considered me in Hufflepuff.”<br/>
<br/>
Rose turned to her mother violently, “What?”<br/>
<br/>
Her mother continued smiling, “Now, don’t act so opposed. Don’t tell your father, but I was very loyal. Dangerously loyal, I talked my way into Slytherin.”<br/>
<br/>
“You can talk the Sorting Hat into your preferred house?” This idea scared Rose—and fascinated her. She was never a good person to have on your side during an argument. Her opinions were not strong and she was not usually allowed to speak during arguments—though there were hardly any to give her a chance.<br/>
<br/>
“Oh, I don’t suppose so but the fact that I tried must have made the hat conclude I belonged in Slytherin. It was my goal to be in Slytherin and my ambient ruled over my loyalty.” She spoke, and her eyes seemed very far away now. “But Hufflepuff, despite what your father thinks and says, is not all that bad.”<br/>
<br/>
Rose considered these words, added in with surprise. She had been taught that there had only been Slytherin for her—it was her one and only choice if she wanted to be apart of this family. And yet—here was her mother, telling her not to be afraid of other houses? “They are the kind ones, right? The ones who see equality over everyone.”<br/>
<br/>
“Another mistake—you do not need to be kind. You need to be hardworking, and fair, yes, but its above kindness. Its stubbornness and wanting to work hard to get somewhere. Slytherin is just getting somewhere no matter what, I believe. Ambience over hard work.” She said. “Ravenclaw are not those who inquire after intelligence and wisdom—they possess it by being themselves. Creativity and ambience end up seeming as if though they did something because it was smart. It’s the flow of how they are themselves. Gryffindors—hard to explain them. You must come up with one should you understand them.”<br/>
<br/>
She thought about this for a long time that night, and the rest of the week. She felt slightly better, until her father sat them down the night before they would head to the Hogwarts Express train. It was bottom line a normal, blood running speech, on how they must get tops grades and make an example of being a leader, and be the best they could be as Slytherins. Rose took to the speech until he said Slytherin. He expected both of his children in Slytherin. She was not sure it would happen.<br/>
<br/>
She came to her own conclusions of the different houses through the night. Slytherins were ambient, yes, but strongly loyal as long as it benefitted their goal. Gryffindor valued justice and believing you were on the right side and speaking justice as if it were a language they were fluent in. Ravenclaw were curiosity and an insatiable thirst for knowing, and understanding. This gave them a sense of creativity and individuality, because there was so much to know. Hufflepuff, however, she could not put her finger on. She didn’t quite understand past the equality amongst all, that perhaps they were just all the other houses but each value was equal. Bravery, intelligence and cunning but all the same priority slot. You wouldn’t be any of those things unless you found everyone equal and just and worked hard for anything you wanted. Its kindness.<br/>
<br/>
If given the choice, she would pick Hufflepuff. But as her father’s words of Slytherin filled her, she conclude that she had no choice. It didn’t matter what anyone valued—she would not be outcasted from her family if she wanted to be kind, or brave or intelligent. She wanted to be with her family. Even if she had to argue with a hat.</p>
