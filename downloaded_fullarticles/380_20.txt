    <p>Voldemort reigned down on them. Crushing. Suffocating. Undefeated. Hermione’s lungs filled with the bitter choke of guilt. Her head lay against the all too familiar cobblestones, heavy limbs like iron aching from the cold. She could feel the vibrations traveling to her through the earth from the collapsing castle. That terrible heartbeat. The sound of her only home crumbling. Dying. Ragged breaths mingled with the taste of blood spilled out of her lips. Those terrible flames of destruction flickered against the plumes of smoke rising out of Hogwarts. Students stood and fought against the Death Eaters who moved with the ease of shadows into the building. There was no stopping it all now. It was all useless. The months of searching. The years of fighting. The lifetime of anguish. Useless. The cries of joy and anguish alike mingled in the thick, dusty air. To identify each voice sickened her. Ron’s guttural scream coming from somewhere inside, she had lost sight of him hours ago. Hermione could hear the telltale screech of Bellatrix Lestrange somewhere too. The twisted call echoing off the broken stones of Hogwarts.<br/><br/>They had searched, Harry, Ron, and herself. They had searched every pit and every fetid dwelling of Death Eaters past. Hermione desperately followed any whisper of the locket in her books. She had classified and documented and investigated all pure blood family wills, dedications, everything. And all of it a dead end. There were times she wondered if the locket had ever existed at all, it made her doubt. She found herself wondering more often than she would ever have admitted  whether it was all an elaborate trap set up by Voldemort in years past. To lure them all to this exact moment. This terrible moment of destruction.<br/><br/>Flashes of red and green lit up the courtyard of Hogwarts with ruthless speed. The crack of magic echoed in her ears and made her skin prickle, as if all her nerve endings recalled her night spent with Bellatrix Lestrange. She remembered how those curses felt crawling through her like a hungry creature in desperate want of blood. Hermione saw the neon sprays of colour and light land all around her. Colliding with bodies - some cloaked in black, and some cloaked in the sickeningly familiar Hogwarts uniform. The students of Hogwarts were as essential and vital to her as every brick of that magnificent castle. Hermione felt like she had died with them. And as she watched every stone and brick, and every student, teacher, and friend fall she died, and died again.<br/><br/>The Death Eaters had descended on Hogwarts as a giant ashen wave. As if weathering some unseen and massive storm the castle quaked. Trembled. All of the brilliant gossamer windows broke in unison. It was the loudest thing she had ever heard. And then came the terrible howling of wind through the halls, and Voldemort in the courtyard - screaming for Harry. Before her eyes slipped closed like an iron gate to the world Hermione saw Harry’s limp body collapse to the ground. His blank eyes staring out at the darkening sky.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Hermione became slowly aware she had changed position. Lying on her back now, rather than her stomach. Her limbs nestled gently against some unseen comfort. Like some sickening tide it all came back to her. No chance at the luxury of amnesia. The screams. The fire. Hogwarts. Ron. Harry. Voldemort. Hermione was certain she had died, or was about to die, where she had laid. But she had moved, or had been moved, which is something the dead would not notice. She wondered who was left. And who had gone. Her heart sunk in her chest like all her veins were made of ice cold metal. Hermione could feel her eyelids closed firmly over her eyes and couldn’t bare to open them. It would all become real. And she couldn’t face it. She couldn’t look into Ron’s eyes knowing that Harry had died to Voldemort’s curses. And she couldn’t look into Molly’s eyes if Ron had perished too. The life she knew had perished. Been obliterated. Crushed under the falling stones of Hogwarts. She felt like a hollow shell. Much like how the castle must be now, she thought. No warmth of life within its walls. No, now they both knew only destruction and death. What a terrible curse it must have been for Harry to outlive his parents through such violence. Sorrow overcame her then. What a terrible curse it must be, to outlive all your friends. Hermione slung an arm over her closed eyes, nestling into the crook of her elbow. If she didn’t open her eyes then none of it would be real. A heart can be broken but go on beating just the same. She wished hers would stop.<br/><br/>The call came to her. To get up. To keep going. Someone who cared about her had brought her back here, laid her down and let her rest. They had cared enough to save her. If she had been captured by Voldemort and his forces she would know it by now. Awoken with curses, no doubt. Beaten, shunned, and ridiculed most definitely. But she hadn’t, and so she wasn’t and maybe there was a speck of hope after all. Hermione slung her arms by her sides and slowly opened her eyes. Brilliant white light poured into her eyes and made her squint. It felt like she hadn’t seen the sun in years. The gentle blur of colours across her vision slowly came into focus and made Hermione furrow her eyebrows. As if untouched on the day she left for Hogwarts her room, her old room, unpacked itself in front of her eyes. Every detail the same, every colour, every texture. She sat up and found herself sitting on her bed. The same bed she had slept in as a child - her feet dangling over the edge now. She had grown a lot since being here. Behind the curtains came floods of white light, illuminating every surface. It was almost too bright, Hermione wondered how long she had been out. Looking down over herself she noted that her clothes were the same as the ones she had worn at the battle, only without any damage. And thankfully without any blood. She studied her hands and saw the dirt and ash from under her nails was gone too. All traces of brutality washed away, and a healing, dreamless sleep. For that she was grateful.</p><p>Hermione stepped carefully across her bedroom floor, recalling all the spots that made the floorboards squeak under her carpet. She wanted to see, first. To know, first - who was left. Who made it out. Gently she padded on bare feet towards the landing of the stairs, marvelling at how her house hadn’t changed at all. Things she had forgotten stepped out at her now. A chip on the corner of a picture frame, a mark on the wall. All fresh now. All mundanely apparent. She had sworn to remember everything about her parents, about the complex map of wrinkles on their faces, to remember every detail of her home. But she had forgotten some. A jolt of guilt crept across her shoulders as she paused to take a breath. Hermione wasn’t sure who she was expecting to see sitting on her living room sofa, in just the same spot her parents had been when the Obliviate settled on them. It seemed an unnatural marriage of worlds to her. She always felt like two different Hermiones, divided into who she was before and after that fateful letter had fluttered through the mail slot. But here, now, they had been smashed together and it made her feel faint. As the sofa came into view Hermione’s mind took a moment to identify the two individuals in her living room. <br/><br/>Remus.<br/><br/>And Tonks.<br/><br/>Hermione’s heart stopped for a moment before hammering in her ears. Like the answer to a riddle she couldn’t forget it was now swimming around in her head, unstoppable. <em>Dead. Dead. Dead. </em>She hadn’t survived after all. And neither had Lupin, and neither had Tonks. She had seen their lifeless bodies slumped against each other while defending Hogwarts. The castle was lost. The final stand in the courtyard lost, too. This was the place that changed it all. Her home. The moment before her letter arrived. Irrevocable, but here it stood still, and silent, and blindingly bright.<br/><br/>“Remus, Tonks?” Hermione’s voice came as meerley a whisper, though she wished it had been more.<br/><br/>She watched as Remus’ head slowly turned to her, though he did not make eye contact he began to speak in a low, monotone voice she had never heard him use. “Hermione. I’m glad you’re awake.”<br/><br/>She walked gently around to the front of the sofa, and sat in the armchair opposite Remus and Tonks. Hermione noticed that Tonks hadn’t moved or looked at her. She simply sat with her hands clasped on her lap, looking at the floor with tears rolling down her cheeks. Remus held her gaze but made no expression. He watched her, interested, and maybe with a hint of concern. It was as if he had a great conflict internally, perhaps struggling to come to terms with his own death. <em>Death. </em>The word made her feel sick.<br/><br/>“Where are Harry, and Ron?” It was all she could think to ask. Hermione was sure they must be dead too. And if they were dead, why weren’t they here.<br/><br/>“They are both elsewhere. This moment is for you, and you alone.” Remus’ voice echoed around the small room, overlapping itself and becoming distorted. He continued, Hermione  was not sure if he could hear what was happening to his voice, or if it was in her head. “It is over. I’m sure you know. But you have a chance. You can go back. Fix it all. There is a prophecy - powerful magic. You have a choice. Like us all. Leave here. Fix it. Or return to sleep - rest eternal.”<br/><br/>Hermione listened through the echo to Remus’ conference. She watched his mouth move and articulate around the words. Her head spun and she gripped the arm of her chair tightly to remain focused. She heard her breath become ragged. “Prophecy?”<br/><br/>Hermione’s eyes flickered between Remus and Tonks as he spoke. Tonks was unnervingly still. Clasping her hands on her lap, still. Tears coming freely from her eyes, still. As if the trauma of her final moment at Hogwarts had carried on with her. Reliving it over and over in her head. Perhaps she was thinking of Teddy. Perhaps she was thinking of it all. “Yes. You can go back, or you can rest. Everyone will know who you are. Like you never left.”<br/><br/>“I can fix it all? Save everyone?” Hermione felt she misheard him. How could she save them all now? How could she go back from this place? From being dead? Her head swum in thick heat, trying to make sense of it all. Trying desperately to focus on Remus.<br/><br/>“Yes.”<br/><br/>Hermione knew immediately she had to try. She had to. Harry would do the same. Ron would, without question. They were Gryffindors and they were brave. It was up to her to save them. To bring them back. “Then I will.”<br/><br/>As soon as she uttered the words her vision began to swirl and flicker at the edges. She felt hot. Cold. Her ears began to ring and Hermione could feel herself slipping. She leaned back in her mother’s favourite armchair and took some deep breaths. Trying to ground herself. Trying not to spin off into unconsciousness. She heard Remus speaking again and strained her ears to hear.</p><p><em> “Hidden in Darkness as the light dies. </em> <em><br/></em> <em> Great warrior fallen, where fates collide. </em> <em><br/></em> <em> On the eve of the first hides the half-blood prize. </em> <br/><em>And in their union will death be denied.”</em></p><p>Hermione was aware vaguely of more being said, but couldn’t decipher it. Couldn’t manage to hear it over the roar of blood coursing through her ears. She slammed her eyes shut and felt a sickening twist. </p><p>Beneath her head she felt cool, hard stone. She felt her elbows and knees resting uncomfortably on the uneven surface. Hermione heard the sound of gentle, curious voices and opened her eyes to a small crowd of unfamiliar students clustered around her. Past their craning heads Hermione could see that behind them Hogwarts rose out of the ground strong, and reborn. Like a phoenix from the ashes both she and the castle were back from the dead. Risen to heal. And risen to overcome.</p><p>
