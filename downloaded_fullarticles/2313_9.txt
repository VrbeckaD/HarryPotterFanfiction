    <p>Before we start i'd like to let you know that I am completely terrible at making my own ideas, so if you happen to see that I've copied, please do inform me, and I will do my best to find and change it. I want to be original... (is using YourYeehawBuddy's Idea)</p><p>BTW this is written with labels on who is talking at the end of the text, so It's not like a roleplay...</p><p>The story starts here:</p><p>"Check over there, this place is filled with contraband." Dean says looking around Freddy's. "Shh.." Sam says back as the signals get louder.<br/>
"Hey, I didn't do anythin-" Dean says before "Shut up I say!" Sam cuts off. "H-h-he-hey there." a mysterious voice comes from somewhere behind them. They turn around to investigate, but not until they see an eight-ish foot tall silhouette standing right in front of them. "Sam, shoot it! Now!" Dean yells. A gunshot comes from somewhere near him, followed by an electric shocking noise, and a loud bang as the silhouette stands tall, laughing eerily at the two. It had turned out that he had shot at the wall, and the bullet ricocheted of the wall into a box. The box fell, and spare parts spilled out all over the room. "What was that?" Sam asks. "Sounds like metal parts you idiot! You missed, I can't believe you! Run now, or stay and die with that thing!" Dean says turning around and sprinting away at full speed towards what looks like an exit door. Although before he could make it he blindly ran right into the parts and service room. "Where the hell am I?" Dean yells looking around at all the spare, empty masks, and the non-operating endoskeleton. A voice comes from the dark, "Welcome home." the voice of a female whispers. "What do you mean by home?" Dean asks a little tense. Dean surely found that out the hard way, lots of bloodshed, bits of muscle, bone and organs strung throughout the room covered in blood. "You'll stay with us, forever."</p>
