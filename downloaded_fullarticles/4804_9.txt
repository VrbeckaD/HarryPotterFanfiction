    <p>Harry ran down the stairs at The Borrow, followed by Ron and the twins crashing down into the dining room where Mr. and Mr. Weasley, Hermione, Bill, Fleur, Percy, Charlie and Ginny were already sitting. Harry had spent a fantastic summer at the Weasley’s, the whole family staying home to celebrate the entire family’s survival. Lupin had visited and told them the amazing news that he would be taking over as defence against the dark arts teacher for half of the students, while Snape would be keeping the other half. They would be doubling the amount needed to finish, seeing as how everyone’s education had been completely messed up. Slughorn would keep potins, which Harry felt conflicted on, seeing as he’d been cheating the entire year he’d had the overweight man.</p><p>Ginny and Harry were flourishing, sneaking off to make love whenever they could while Harry still very consciously didn’t blow off Ron, and Hermione later in the summer when she came to the borrow. Honestly, this was the absolute happiest Harry had ever been. No impending war, no Dursleys, no recent deaths, he’d be going back to Hogwarts with his two best friends, his girlfriend, and the twins, who decided they should close shop just for a while so they could continue their education.  Harry couldn’t think of anything that could make him happier.</p><p>"Are you boys sure you don’t want to wait just a little while longer before you go back?” Mrs. Weasley had been fretting about them leaving ever since they’d received the letters asking them to return to school.</p><p>"Mum! We’ll be fine!” Ron told her, exasperated. </p><p>“Well… alright, we best go then.”</p><p>Ron, Hermione and Harry sat on one side of the compartment, Ginny and Neville on the other, chatting comfortably. Exchanging stories, but mostly just marveling over how extremely puberty had hit Neville. Harry hadn’t even realized who it was until he gave them his hundred watt smile and started chatting excitedly. </p><p>The compartment door opened, cutting off Harry's amazement, and replacing it with confusion, because it reveal none other than Draco Malfoy.</p><p>"Sorry, my friend needed some help, I told her Granger would be the best." Draco smiled weakly, nodding to a small girl with long black hair and pretty blue eyes. The five companions went into small states of shock.</p><p>"Sorry to bother you, but my kitten looks a bit ill, Draco said you were the best." Hermione seemed too shocked to do much more than nod, Draco beamed at the girl as she held up a small black, very fluffy kitten. </p><p>"Could you help him?" </p><p>"I'll do it, if you're okay with it." Harry offered, holding out his hands for the cat. The girl turned to look at Draco, he nodded, and she handed the cat over. Harry did a quick scan spell Remus had taught him, noted the cat had nothing wrong aside from motion sickness, and told the girl as much.</p><p>"Would you mind doing something so he'll sleep until we get to the school?" Harry nodded, muttering a swift spell and watching as the cat slowly drifted off. Draco reached out and took the little fluff."</p><p>"Thank you so much!" The girl gave Harry a quick kiss on the cheek, grabbed the cat from Draco, giving him a kiss on the cheek as well, and ran off.</p><p>"Thanks Potter, she's a sweet girl, and that little fluff ball means the world to her."</p><p>"Did you just tell me 'thank you'?" Harry demanded incredulously. </p><p>"And what's with referring your girlfriend to us?! You hate us!" Ron practically shouted.</p><p>"I've heard it's customary to thank people who help you, and she isn't my girlfriend. She was sitting in the only open compartment worrying over the thing, so I told her it was likely that Hermione would have returned to do her eight year, and that she's the best in our class." The five still seemed shocked, but nodded anyways. </p><p>Draco turned to leave when it occurred to Harry he didn't even know the girl's name.</p><p>"Who was she?" Harry shouted down the small hallway after the blonde.<br/>"Lily."</p>
