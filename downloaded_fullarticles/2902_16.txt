          <div class="userstuff"><p>I had been taking care of her since she was born.<br/>
Since she had opened those little eyes full of life and death.<br/>
We had been together since forever. It was obvious. It was natural.<br/>
She was my life. I was her home.<br/>
Dad was in Azkaban, mum was dead. Albus didn’t care about us.<br/>
But we tried anyway, despite the difficulties, to go on.<br/>
Hand in hand, always together, we walked through life.<br/>
I watched her grow up before me.<br/>
The long, silky hair, that she tortured.<br/>
The soft lips, that she bit.<br/>
The blue and intelligent eyes, that she moved restlessly, opened wide, terrified.<br/>
That thin, little body that was growing, but she hid it in the shadows.<br/>
We were alone, she and I. My love wasn’t enough. She needed help.<br/>
Ariana needed help.<br/>
But we were alone.</p><p>One night I woke up and she was there. Sitting on the edge of the bed, next to me, she was staring at me with her eyes wide open.<br/>
“Do you hear them?” Her voice was feeble, almost a whisper.<br/>
“What?”<br/>
“Do you hear the sparrows caw in the night?”<br/>
“Sparrows don’t caw, Ariana.”<br/>
“Yes, but do you hear them?”<br/>
I didn’t answer her. Instead, I lifted the cover inviting her to take shelter. She curled up against my chest, and I held on tight. I just wanted to protect her.<br/>
The trembling light of a candle was projecting onto the hallway. Albus was probably still awake, busy writing to that friend of his.<br/>
I had to talk to my brother.<br/>
The situation had gone too far.<br/>
I ran a hand through Ariana’s hair. Cuddling in the night, we listened.<br/>
I just wanted to protect her.<br/>
I couldn’t know that that night would have been the last one.</p><p>And now I’m here. On her grave.<br/>
My sister’s grave, damn it!<br/>
And it’s cold outside, it’s cold inside.<br/>
It’s dark inside, it’s dark outside.<br/>
A cold body above the ground. Me.<br/>
A warm body under the ground. Her.<br/>
A grave dirty with tears.<br/>
And the sparrow, the sparrows in the night…<br/>
I can hear them. Cawing.<br/>
Crying.</p></div>
