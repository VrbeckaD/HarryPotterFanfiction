    <p>Sherlock Holmes had never heard of wizards.</p><p>Well, of course Sherlock Holmes <em>had</em> heard of wizards. He had heard of the sort of old, wizened man who defeated evil in fairy tales. And then, Sherlock Holmes turned six, discovered science, and never gave wizards a second thought.</p><p>Mycroft Holmes knew this.</p><p>He also knew that it would take an awful lot to persuade Sherlock what his real job was. What his actual, official job title was, not whatever that nonsense they put out to the public (which includes everyone) was. And he knew he'd need help.</p><p>"Mycroft, what is it?" Sherlock asks loudly. Mycroft turns his chair around to face his little brother. "Why are we meeting here, why can't you come to the flat?"</p><p>"The flat is a little public for a matter of such a... delicate nature."</p><p>Sherlock frowned. "Sex scandal? Mycroft I'm not following the Prime Minister around for another month, we all know what he gets up to."</p><p>"No, not that. Kingsley?"</p><p>A tall, black, bald man enters in a rather elaborate robe, woven in bright colours.</p><p>"Sherlock, do you know who this man is?"</p><p>"Kingsley Shacklebolt, new addition to the government."</p><p>"No."</p><p>"No?"</p><p>"No," Kingsley affirms. "It is true that I am a new addition to the government, but that is not why I'm here." Kingsley's voice is low and deep and calming, and yet Mycroft seems nervous. Sherlock narrows his eyes.</p><p>"What's going on? Are you two dating or something?"</p><p>Mycroft smiles, indulging his brother in his little joke. "I assure you, brother, it's nowhere near that simple."</p><p>"Mr Holmes, you must have been aware of the recent events."</p><p>"I presume you are talking about the murders of Amelia Bones and Emmeline Vance."</p><p>"Not only that. The collapse of the Brockdale Bridge, the hurricane in the South-West, even the recent troubles of Herbert Chorley."</p><p>"I've been looking into the murders for some time, but I was under the impression that the Brockdale Bridge was a structural problem, and that hurricanes are not quite my area of expertise. I am unaware of this Herbert Chorley."</p><p>"Herbert Chorley," Mycroft interjects, "is a junior minister in the government. He is currently under the impression that he is a duck."</p><p>Sherlock smiles. "Put him in a pond, then. I don't know what this has to do with me."</p><p>"It is to do with everyone, Mr Holmes. There is a single group behind all of this, and Mycroft assures me that you could be vital in fighting it."</p><p>"Does he? How nice. Not interested."</p><p>Sherlock makes to leave, but feels Mycroft's hand on his arm. "Sherlock, this is a matter of national importance."</p><p>"Everything's a matter of national importance to you. I'm going home." He leaves, and Mycroft sits down at his desk with an apologetic gesture to Kingsley.</p><p>"We need his help."</p><p>"I'll do everything I can. But it's Sherlock Holmes, there's never any guarantees."</p>
