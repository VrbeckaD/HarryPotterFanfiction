    <p>When she looked up, her face was hard with the understanding of someone who sees no way out. She refolded the paper without looking at it, then touched her wand to her thumb with a muttered incantation before pressing the drop of blood that appeared on her thumb onto the folded letter beside her name. As soon as her blood touched the paper, the letter vanished, and Hermione turned in her chair to face Headmistress McGonagall.</p><p>“Does Professor Snape know?”</p><p>The headmistress drew a breath, then shook her head. “I do not believe that Severus is aware of his father’s decision. Nor am I sure,” she added with a straight face, “that Severus will not immediately burn the letter and hex his father into the next millennium.”</p><p>Hermione tilted her head. “Although that might do something for the wizarding world at large, I would have thought poison more his style. ‘No silly wand-waving,’ and all that.”</p><p>A corner of the headmistress' mouth twitched. “My dear, that is when he is being rational. The kind of fury that Sempronius Snape produces in his son is more likely to result in burning buildings and collapsed mountain ranges than in logical and calculated poisons.” She narrowed her eyes. “Severus is not always calm and lethally sarcastic, Miss Granger. His temper is decidedly dangerous, especially when paired with the skills he possesses.”</p><p>Hermione opened her mouth to speak, then thought better of her word choice. “I…take it that he and his father do not get along?”</p><p>McGonagall snorted. “More like enemies, those two. Sempronius probably heard of the law and thought it would be fitting punishment for Severus.”</p><p>“Punishment for what?” Hermione asked, scribbling on a sheet of parchment she had pulled from her bag as she listened.</p><p>“Ask Merlin,” McGonagall replied with a shrug. “They’ve been at each other’s throats since his mother died—Severus’, that is. Eileen Prince was a lovely witch: a bit scattered when she was focused on a project, but delightful and intelligent.” A twinkle of bells interrupted her reminisces and, startled, she looked at Dumbledore’s clock.</p><p>“Ah, dear,” she exclaimed with forced levity. “Seems it’s time for lunch already, then. Shall we be off, Miss Granger?”</p><p>Hermione smiled at the Headmistress, but Minerva could see that the girl’s thoughts were elsewhere. “I won’t be at lunch today,” Hermione informed her decisively, her attention coming back to the Headmistress. “I have things I need to do.”</p><p>“Of course, dear,” Minerva replied with a sympathetic twist of the lips. “I understand completely. See you at dinner, then.”</p><p>Hermione headed straight for the library, sure that Madam Pince would be at lunch, and if not, would surely help her find what she was looking for. Thankfully, the ever-watchful librarian was absent and Hermione found herself quickly at the shelves of books that held magical laws, statutes, and treaties. Finding the ones on domestic law, she pulled a few of them down and carried them to a nearby table, then went back for the rest, realizing mid-journey that she could have just levitated them all in the first place. She shrugged, set the second load on the table, and pulled a quill, parchment, and ink from her bag of schoolbooks and supplies, which she kept conveniently shrunk in the pocket of her robes.</p><p>Flipping the first book from the stack open in front of her, Hermione paused to brush her hair back over her shoulders before picking up her quill, dipping it in the ink, and beginning to copy down any relevant information. As she had a free period after lunch, courtesy of the Headmistress’ command that she not fill every waking moment with classes, she sat there for the next three hours, reading and copying. Although she quite enjoyed learning all that there was to know about marriage in Wizarding Britain, and arranged magical marriage in particular, she thought at one point that all of this would have been easier if all relevant information were in Hogwarts: A History. Apparently the Hogwarts library had books on domestic Wizarding affairs that even she had passed over when doing her research for S.P.E.W.</p><p>When she finally stopped for longer than it took to grab another roll of parchment from her bag, Hermione gently sent the books back to the shelves, in correct order, of course, and grabbed the first roll of parchment. Unrolling it, she began to reread what she had written, and the girl who had thought that she knew the reaches of power and ownership in the Wizarding world was shocked by what was spelled out on the parchment in her own handwriting.</p><p>The basics of Wizarding marriage were simple, and quite congruent with Muggle marriage, from what she knew of it. The Wizarding world gave a bit more authority to the wizard than Muggles did to the man, but it made perfect sense in her mind that that was so, since the Wizarding world was a hundred years or so behind the Muggle one. The laws for arranged marriages, however, especially those supported by the Ministry, made normal Wizarding marriages seem like beacons of equality.</p><p>Hermione reached into her bag once again and pulled out the notes that she had made in the Headmistress’ office. At the top of the parchment she had written “Level Four,” which the contract she had verified listed as the Importance Level of the marriage law. She began to flip through her notes, remembering a mention in one of the texts about levels, and was trying to remember which book the information had been in when a hand swooped in front of her and snatched her pile of notes off the table. She jerked, spilling ink across the table when her knee knocked against the table leg, and looked up in a mix of astonishment and irritation to see Professor Snape thumbing through her notes, his permanent sneer of disgust missing for the first time that she could recall, replaced by cold hatred and boiling resentment. She didn’t dare speak, for once silenced by his implacable expression.</p><p>Once he had glanced over every page, he dropped them on the table and looked at her for the first time. “In my office. Now.”</p><p>Hermione opened her mouth to speak, but he was already out the door, the breeze from his moving robes and her stuttering heart the only signs of his presence. Pulling herself together as she remembered his words, she quickly tossed everything into her bag, Evanesco’ed the mess from the ink, then hurried after him.</p><p>Reaching the door to the potions classroom, Hermione took a breath and reminded herself that she was not in danger. She had all of her essays back for Potions, and surely he wouldn’t take this out on any future essays. A voice in her head whispered that there might not be any future essays, but she shook her head to get rid of that voice and knocked on the door. She had almost given up on his answering when the door opened and she found herself facing what she could only describe as a very out-of-sorts Professor Snape.</p><p>He was dressed the same as always, in black robes and boots, and the customary sneer was back on his face, but it was one of extreme irritation, not the usual disgust that doubled whenever Harry or Neville were around, which was most always, she realized. He turned away from the door and strode to his desk to pick up a piece of paper before heading to a smaller door that Hermione realized wasn’t normally there. She followed him, reaching the door in time to see him touch it and hear the last few words of a spell in a language she didn’t recognize. The door opened, and she followed him again, into a small room with bookshelves reaching higher than she could see, all stacked with books, as were the chair, table, and, she noticed belatedly, the desk that he had immediately gone to.</p><p>Still marveling at the books and trying to catch their titles without being too obvious, she walked the few meters over to his desk, waiting for him to look up, as all his attention was focused on the paper he had taken from his classroom desk. Trying again to be subtle, she discovered that the paper he was leaning over was his copy of the marriage contract, with, she was horrified to notice, her signature on the line where she had pressed her thumb earlier. Her signature in blood.</p><p>“Miss Granger.” No matter how many times she heard her name said in the slow, clipped voice, it still made her shudder a little.</p><p>“Yes, Professor?” She resolved to be calm and rational, no matter what horrible things he said.</p><p>“Obviously you have no idea what you have done by signing…this.” He waved the contract in front of her with distaste, still not looking up.</p><p>“What grounds do you have on which to make that claim?” Hermione demanded primly, standing up straighter and reaching into her bag for her sheaf of notes.</p><p>“The grounds,” he told her, finally looking up, “that you would never have signed had you fully known what that contract entails and what you are magically bound to the moment I sign the contract as well.” He met her gaze sternly, then huffed out a breath as she pulled the parchments from her bag. “Give me those,” he ordered as he snatched them once again from her hand.</p><p>“Of all the imbeciles I have the displeasure of teaching, I would have thought that at least you, Miss Granger, would have had the absolute minimum of common sense required to know that one should research a magical contract before signing it, not afterward.” The level of his voice never changed, but the intensity rose so steadily and to such an extent that Hermione felt her eyes widen in surprise. She couldn’t remember Professor Snape being this intently serious about something since his encounter with Sirius in her third year.</p><p>“I didn’t have a chance beforehand,” she retorted. “If I didn’t sign upon reception of the contract, the Ministry has the ability to charge me with disloyalty and have me sent to Azkaban immediately. No choices or chances—the Ministry made sure of that,” she added hotly, arms folded in front of her chest and chin stuck out stubbornly.</p><p>Professor Snape began to flip through her notes again. “I assume you noticed the law’s Level of Importance?”</p><p>She nodded, glad to be back on the solid ground of answering questions. “Level four.”</p><p>“And do you know what the different levels mean, with this kind of law?”</p><p>She frowned at him. “I was getting ready to find out when you interrupted me in the library.”</p><p>He raised an eyebrow. “Surely, Miss Granger, after having read nearly every book in the entirety of Hogwarts, you have some idea what a Level of Importance is…?”</p><p>She snorted a little in indignation. “Of course.” She began to recite from <em>The Ministry: Its Laws and History</em>. “‘Levels of Importance are one of the many ways in which the Ministry differentiates between laws which require different amounts of control from the Ministry’s officials. Varying between one and four, these levels—’”</p><p>“Enough.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>His sneer widened. “You have no idea how they apply to marriage laws. Your lack of comprehension as to how these apply to your current situation would be amusing, were it not so pathetic.” Her outrage showed immediately on her face, and he took the top sheet of parchment from the stack in his hands and turned it around for her to read. “Middle of the page, Miss Granger.”</p><p>As she read, she could feel her cheeks grow hot, and when she finished and tried to speak, no words emerged. She looked up at him in horror, only to see him leaning back in his chair, arms folded and head nodding as he saw understanding grow in her eyes.</p><p>“I did tell you that you wouldn’t have signed it if you had known what it truly entailed,” he reminded her.</p><p>“But I—”</p><p>“You had no choice; so you’ve told me,” he interrupted. “The last law that the Ministry passed dealing with marriage in such a…dramatic way, was the Norman/Saxon Intermarriage Act of 1178, when the magical populations had become so split that they married Muggles instead of each other, causing rifts in the magical knowledge of each.” He took a breath as he glanced down at the sheet in front of her. “The Levels have not been changed since then in regards to marriage, since there was no immediate need, and the Ministry thinks that applying a Level Four to this law will achieve the results they desire.”</p><p>Hermione, unsure of whether her voice would hold if she chose to speak, read over the paragraph once again, then decided that it was worth trying her voice. “House elves have more rights.”</p><p>He said nothing for a moment, then there was a strange tone to his voice when he spoke. “You discover what you’ve gotten yourself into, and your first reaction is to think of the elves?”</p><p>“I beg your pardon.” Her voice held none of his apparent amusement, and the outrage was gone from her face, replaced by a coldness that had his smirk fading and his rare humor dying. “It is not I who got myself into this, Professor Snape, but your father, who apparently—and quite correctly, I gather—thinks that marrying you to me will be fit punishment or irritation for you,” she snapped. “I see exactly what it says on that page, and yes, I know what every chauvinistic, cruel, outdated word of it means. And no, Professor, my first thought was not comparing life married under this law to that of a house elf. That was my second thought.” She found herself breathing heavily and stopped to catch her breath, then added quietly, “My first thought was terror.”</p><p>She stalked over to the other chair in the room, dragged it to where she had been standing, and sat in it stone-faced, watching him.</p><p>Severus read over the contract once more. “You are absolutely sure that you would prefer this to Azkaban or exile.”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“And you are completely prepared to follow the rules set out by the contract’s Level Four status.”</p><p>“<em>Yes</em>, Professor,” she replied, beginning to be irritated once again.</p><p>“Tell me what it is that you will have committed to when I sign this paper,” he told her.</p><p>Her jaw dropped, and she glanced around uneasily. “But, Profes—”</p><p>“I want to hear it from you that you know what will result if I sign this paper, Miss Granger,” he informed her, leaning forward across the desk. “I will not have anyone say that I tricked you into this for revenge on Potter.”</p><p>She swallowed, blinked, then shook her hair back determinedly. “Level of Importance Four states that in regard to marriage arranged by the family and proposed by the Ministry, all power held by the Ministry relating to each marriage is handed over to the husband as head of the household when said marriage is made legal. From that point on, the husband holds all power over his wife and any children that she bears, including life, education, punishment, and finance. In addition, the husband has the power to facilitate the wife’s submission to him in all matters, by force if necessary or by preference.” Her voice trailed off as the meaning of the rule sank in once again, then she added more firmly, “Is that sufficient? Or would you prefer that I find a text that lists every possible form of submission and punishment you could require of or inflict upon me?”</p><p>She drew herself up straight in the chair, and he found himself shaking his head. “No, that will do, Miss Granger.” He took his own wand and pressed it to his thumb, then pressed it, as she had done, to the line requiring his signature. The contract disappeared, and they found themselves staring at each other in silence for a minute before Hermione asked,</p><p>“How does the ceremony work?”</p><p>Severus stared at her in shock, a fact which nearly brought Hermione to laughter, as she had never seen that expression on his face before. “What?” she asked. “Don’t Wizarding marriages have ceremonies as well?”</p><p>When he answered, she thought she saw pity in his eyes. “Miss Granger, this law does not require the usual marriage ceremony. In fact, if your parents were not Muggles, your signature would not have even been needed for this to be legal.”</p><p>“But how…?”</p><p>He sighed. “This is less of a marriage contract and more an exchange of goods, Miss Granger. A business deal, if that makes more sense. My agreement to protect and house you, in exchange for your—what would normally be your father’s—agreement to allow me to get children on you and to treat you as I please so long as I don’t kill you without good reason and fair warning.”</p><p>The solemnity of his tone, added to the feeling of his words reverberating in her head, made her feel sick. “Good reason and fair warning?” she echoed dizzily.</p><p>“Indeed, Miss Granger. Adultery, of course, but such things as treason and barrenness are also considered good reason.” She could hear the effort he made to keep his voice steady as he continued sardonically, “One wouldn’t want to allow the family to be dishonored by keeping a treasonous or unfaithful wife.”</p><p>“And your fidelity—or lack thereof—” she interjected, “would be a matter of no consequence, of course.”</p><p>The resulting silence made her blush in a combination of embarrassment at the topic—though why she was embarrassed, she didn’t know—and frustration with the laws.</p><p>Severus brought the full force of his power of intimidation into the look he gave her. “Obviously.” The intensity of his gaze softened a little. “It is not for a wife to say what her husband can and cannot do, Miss Granger.”</p><p>She held up her hand, brows drawing together. “Wait.”</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>“You said that no ceremony is necessary—that it’s done by signing the papers.”</p><p>He nodded. “It is.”</p><p>She looked him straight in the eyes, her lips quirked with a faint amusement that made him feel uneasy. “Then why are you continuing to call me ‘Miss Granger?’”</p><p>The look of shock settled onto his face again, where it sat for several moments as his ever-quick mind finally came to the conclusion that he had missed while thinking so hard about every other resulting catastrophe of the contract: he was actually married to that dratted, know-it-all Gryffindor.</p><p>“Damn the Ministry to hell.”</p><p>Then she did laugh, and as he put his head in his hands, he thought irritably that it was just like a bloody Gryffindor to find hilarity in his misfortune.</p>
