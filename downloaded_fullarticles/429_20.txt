  <span>Sunny weather had been forecast for the day, but it made little difference in the basement levels of the Ministry of Magic. As always, the lower levels were poorly lit, committed to a somber aesthetic. One particular hallway echoed lightly with the quiet conversation of two men. The words were quiet and indiscernible to wandering ears with the effects of a </span>
  <em>
    <span>muffliato</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Did you never wonder,” the wizengamot man gently asked, the corners of his eyes softly crinkled and his back hunched with age, “how exactly his father escaped a sentence to Azkaban after the first war?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Money,” Harry’s answer was quick and certain, “and lies. He lied about being under the imperius curse and bought off whoever didn’t believe him.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Crowles, the wizengamot man, frowned. “The thought that your generation is so quick to accuse mine of corruption does not bode well.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry didn’t say anything. He hadn’t survived a war by always believing in the best of every witch or wizard. The old man seemed to note the silence and understand its significance. “But perhaps that reputation has been earned,” Crowles sighed and looked up at the younger man with a sad smile. “After the first downfall of Voldemort, Lucius went to trial for heinous crimes, got pardoned, and the ministry received a rather large mystery donation. It must all look like bad politics to you.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>At Harry’s blank stare the man suddenly thought he felt very tired, though it was only half past lunch hour. “There was once a time that the name ‘Malfoy’ inspired respect and fear of the good kind in the wizarding world. Even awe, for some.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I didn’t think there was a good kind of fear,” muttered Harry. “Are you saying Malfoy got off on his charges so easy because of his last name? I didn’t think it still held any kind of power.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Now Mr. Crowles gave Harry a strange look. “You testified at his trial in his favor today. I recall you saying his role was crucial to your victory. Did you do so because you were hoping to see him punished severely?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry had the good sense to look chastised. “Well, no. I don’t think he deserves Azkaban, at least. But I don’t think mandatory sessions with a mind healer count as punishment, either. Not for his crimes.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“So you speak for him to soften his sentence, then feel frustrated when his sentence is soft? It is not a punishment. It is mandatory. Draco Malfoy’s needs counseling to help his recovery after playing his part in the war. I know you weren’t allowed in for most of the trial and so are not privy to the details, but I assure you the sentence is fair. The boy deserves some time off to readjust, and so do you. You’re both only sixteen.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Time off? Off to do what? Be evil? I don’t trust Draco Malfoy to do the right thing with ‘time off’.” Harry couldn’t keep the incredulous tone out of his voice and didn’t bother to try. Still, something nagged at the back of Harry’s mind. A scarred hand. A cloak that dripped darkness. A voice full of snark that Harry wished to forget. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Crowles gave Harry a leveling look that Harry briefly reminded him of McGonagall whenever she had caught him in the hallways after curfew. For a moment he was twelve again, under the scrutiny of a stern gaze and the world was a much simpler, if still dangerous, place. He was brought back as Crowles spoke. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I wager you could do with a mind healer yourself. You have the look. The haunted look.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry swallowed and stepped back. There were some things he was not ready to discuss. They were too raw and  not anyone’s business. “Will you tell me nothing about Malfoy then? Will you not answer my question about why he got off so easy? I can’t imagine what sort of lies he’s spun to have you convinced that a </span>
  <em>
    <span>former Death Eater</span>
  </em>
  <span> needs </span>
  <em>
    <span>time off</span>
  </em>
  <span>.” Harry scoffed.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Do not be so quick to judge one of your own peers, Mr. Potter. The wizarding world holds many secrets and the purebloods exist even separate from the rest of us. Do not become fixated on hate. Trust that the aurors did their job researching the case. Trust that the wizengamot is not made of soft, blind old fools. This was the second coming of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. Do you think anyone would hesitate to convict one of </span>
  <em>
    <span>his</span>
  </em>
  <span> followers? The war is still fresh on everyone’s minds. I assure you no one is feeling </span>
  <em>
    <span>lenient</span>
  </em>
  <span>.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry shook his head. “I didn’t mean to imply-”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Imply you did. And I cannot, under wizengamot oath, share the details of the case with you. No matter how persistently you ask or how well intentioned you believe yourself to be.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry nodded. If it was an oath holding the old man back there was nothing to be done about it. Magical oaths were unbreakable. But could Harry accept that Draco had walked into his trial a confirmed Death Eater and then walked out a free man? That would be harder to do.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span> “However,” Harry startled a bit, not expecting Crowles to go on after a long silence, “I can point you in the right direction.” Harry stared at the old man. “Might you, per chance, know French, Mr. Potter?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry frowned. French? “A bit, maybe,” he replied uneasily. It was related to Latin, right? Close enough?</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Crowles nodded, not bothered by Harry’s hesitation. “Tell me, what do the words ‘mal foi’ translate to?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry hesitated, guessing, “Bad faith?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Crowles smiled, the edges of his mouth crinkling. “Yes. ‘Bad Faith’. Tell me, Mr. Potter, what is the purpose of carrying a name like ‘Bad Faith’ in a country as historically Christian as England? The Malfoys came to England at the height of The Persecution.” The Persecution. The name given to the height of the witch trials in Europe. Or at least the height of when actual witches, and the occasional wizard, had been persecuted and burned at the stake. Before everyone learned the charms that made being burned at the stake a stage performance, and after paranoid muggles had started burning other muggles. Following The Persecution the Statue of Secrecy had gained popularity and had become heavily enforced. The divide between wizards and muggles had grown. Harry remembered the details hazily from professor Binns’ tutelage in third year. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry felt thoroughly puzzled. How had they gone from Malfoy’s sentence to wizarding history? He narrowed his eyes. “How is this related to Malfoy’s sentence, Mr. Crowles?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>But Crowles only smiled and patted Harry on the arm. “I suggest, Mr. Potter, that if you want answers about the circumstances surrounding Mr. Malfoy now, that you start with the original House of Mal Foi. History, you will come to find, is never as easily forgotten as we may think and tends to repeat itself.” And when Harry only stared Crowles patted his arm again and then moved off down the ministry hallway, muttering something about a late lunch.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry, perplexed, was left alone in the dim hallways with more questions than answers. Perhaps it was time to visit Hermione. He didn’t understand what Crowles was trying to hint at, but maybe the smartest witch of their generation would.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione set on the quest for information on the House of Mal Foi like a dog after his favorite treat. The one thing Hermione liked better than being well-informed was the original hunt for information itself. With only a month until the reopening of Hogwarts and the beginning of their sixth year, she wasted no time cracking open the genealogy books at the Weasleys, tracing their line back several generations until it crossed to the Malfoys. From there she cross referenced names in history books and continued tracing the line back using half-completed journals and whatever bits of wizarding history that seemed relevant. Nothing much came up until she, in a fit of frustration, tried checking </span>
  <em>
    <span>muggle</span>
  </em>
  <span> historical records. Then things got interesting.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“‘The House of Mal Foi was famous for being a smuggling facility. They smuggled everything from banned books to banned substances and even’, listen to this Harry, ‘persecuted peoples across England and nearby Europe. Persecuted peoples suspected to have gained the House of Mal Foi’s sympathies include, but may not be limited to, early heretics persecuted during religious hysteria.’” Hermione looked up from her place on the couch, history text cradled gently in her arms. At Harry’s blank look she rolled her eyes and translated.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Think about it. This means the Malfoys were hiding and saving witches and wizards from the Persecution. The Malfoys were the </span>
  <em>
    <span>heroes</span>
  </em>
  <span> back then. They took a risk to smuggle those persecuted. That must be where the respect for the Malfoy name comes from.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>This, however, was not enough for Harry. “Wasn’t that a long time ago? Why should they still get credit for something their ancestors did?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione frowned. “I’m not sure. Wizarding society is awfully traditional though. I wouldn’t be surprised if the respect just carried on over the generations.” Harry didn’t reply, lost in thoughts about a scarred hand and posh accent. Hermione noticed his distraction and cut across it with a question, “Harry? Not that I mind having something to do during the summer and not that this isn’t all fascinating to me- it is, really- but why are you so fixated on this? The war is over and we survived. Why does it matter what happens to Malfoy now?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry looked up, face pale. How to explain? </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It has to do with </span>
  <em>
    <span>him</span>
  </em>
  <span>, doesn’t it?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Unable to admit it out loud, Harry simply nodded.</span>
