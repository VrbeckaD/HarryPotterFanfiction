    <p>Tending to the small campfire, Harry was checking over his and Ron’s Auror equipment for their investigation.  </p><p>Once the war done, Harry and Ron had instantly jumped at the opportunity of becoming Aurors, offered to them by the head himself of the new government. Having climbed the ranks awfully quickly, the two were sent to work with the Russian team of dark wizard hunters to catch the remaining death eaters who had taken refuge in Eastern Europe. They’d easily found quite a few in Poland, Russia and Belarus, while a few decided to be smarter and take refuge in the smaller communities of Romania, Serbia, and some even went as far south as Greece and Turkey.  </p><p>Now, two years into their hunt, they had finally received the owl telling them they could finally return home to await their next mission. </p><p>“I wonder how much changed.” Harry wondered as he packed up his gear. He’d had found himself packing up his friend’s gear as well, Ron’s insistence on staying by the fire strong. </p><p>“I don’t see how it could. It was only two years.” Ron shrugged, poking the logs around and letting a burst of embers fly up. “Ginny’s probably waiting for you or seeing some new bloke, and Hermione’s waiting for me.” </p><p>Harry looked to Ron for a few minutes before shaking his head silently. “I don’t know, it’s been two years. That’s enough to get over someone.” He muttered, He didn’t want Ron’s hope to get too high, two years was plenty of time for things to change. </p><p>“What’s the most that can happen? They’re both married with children?” Ron let out a snort at the ludicrous idea. “Please, Harry, be realistic.” </p><p>“Oh ya, no one get’s married after only two years out of school right?” Harry added to the sarcasm. ‘<em> Except... My parents, the Weasleys, the Longbottoms, the- </em>” </p><p>“Exactly! At most, Hermione’s seeing someone and all I need to do is convince her the dude is no good.”  </p><p>‘This will not end well...’ Harry knew he should probably stop Ron, but he also knew they were both adults and needed to take responsibility for their actions. “You do that, Ron.” He said, finishing the packing. “but don’t come crying if it fails.” </p><p>“You should have more faith in me, Harry!” </p><p>“Yeah, okay Ron. I’m going to bed.”  </p>
<hr/><p>Walking down Diagon Alley as the sun set was an interesting experience for Ron and Harry. Many families who were doing their late shopping were staring and pointing to the two returning war-heroes.  </p><p>“It’s only been two years...” Ron muttered, his large bag over his shoulder as they walked by Ollivander’s. </p><p>“A lot can happen in two years Ron.” Harry responded back.  </p><p>“Harry? Ron? Is that you?” They heard a voice call out to them from behind.  They turned and saw their old Quidditch captain, Angelina Johnson standing there and waving at them. Though a few things must’ve happened since they left because she cradled a rather large belly and she had a glittering rock on her finger. “My goodness, it must’ve been what, a few years?” She walked/waddled over to them and hugged them tightly. “We were all so worried when you up and left like that!” </p><p>“We haven’t been gone that long...” Ron kept repeating, his face turning a bit red. “You seem to have been busy?” He motioned to her belly. Harry had to discreetly kick Ron so he didn’t point out to the pregnancy in the worst way.  </p><p>Angelina, thankfully, waved it off and smiled with a laugh. “Oh yes that! It’d definitely kept me busy, that and George won’t let me help in the shop.” </p><p>Ron seem to stop for a few seconds, his mind freezing as if a glitch had happened. “What — Wait — George? You married George?” </p><p>Angelina seemed confused at his question. “Umm, yes. We were already seeing each other when you left, don’t you remember? Oh dear, you’ve missed a lot.” Just then, as Angelina was going to continue, the door to WWW opened and a head popped out looking around where the empty box Angelina had been carrying was.</p><p>“Angie? You good, love?”  </p><p>“Over here!” She called him over and the moment his eyes laded on the two figures beside her, his eyes widened and he rushed over.  </p><p>“Where the hell have you two been?” He immediately shot.  </p><p>“Oh? No hello?” </p><p>“Never mind, just come inside. You two must be exhausted.” Angelina stopped George from retorting and sent a look to Ron to keep his trap shut.  </p><p>They quickly noted how much the shop had changed, the stock neatly arranged and many new products and improved candies.  There was much more room to move around and it even seemed as if the stock had increased as well. They both followed Angelina and George up the back stairs to the flat and welcomed them in, taking their coats and hanging them up. </p><p>“Welcome back.” She said happily. “You’re so lucky, we made a bigger dinner tonight and there should be enough for both of you as well!” While it seemed she was done talking, she caught George’s mouth about to open again and shot him a side glance, shutting him up.  </p><p>“Dining room is this way.” He mumbled and motioned them to follow. </p>
<hr/><p>Dinner had gone off well and the four had gone to the living room where Ron and Harry almost collapsed on the couch from the good food and lack of energy. </p><p>Now, Angelina was bringing them up-to-date on all the exciting moments that had happened most recently. </p><p>“And Percy, being the awkward brother of yours, asks Charlie to help him with his engagement!” She exclaimed. “SO obviously, he says yes and you won’t believe what he did! He brought this large Chinese Fireball from the reserve and had it blow in fire ‘<em> Will you marry me </em>’ in the sky!” </p><p>“And did she accept?” Harry asked, intrigued by the story. </p><p>“Of course. But get this, somehow, Charlie got the wrong time and made the message appear four hours later than planned.” Angelina was laughing so hard she could barely inhale properly and George was just sitting there patting her back and telling her to breathe. </p><p>“Breathe in love, don’t need you getting a head-start on junior there...” George mumbled, trying to get his wife to calm down from all the laughter before she forced her water to break due to the force of her laughter. She had quite the habit of ending up on the floor when she laughed too hard so he was trying to avoid just that.  And seeing that she was due any day now, it was getting rather difficult to help her from off the floor.  </p><p>“So, uh, talking about engagements, I’ve been planning something.” Ron mumbled, scratching the back of his head nervously and averting his gaze.  </p><p>“Oh did you find someone abroad?” Angelina seemed to have immediately recovered and was in his face with a grin, wanting every piece of information that she could suck up.  </p><p>“Not quite but I want to, uh, give this to Hermione.” He said, digging through his jacket pocket to pull out a small black box. While he searched, he missed George tense up, something Harry noticed though, and the older man raised a brow sceptically. </p><p>“Are you sure? You weren’t even seeing each other before hand.” George countered, looking at the ring that Ron passed to Angelina for inspection. “Don’t you think you’re jumping a bit far with this one?” He had also missed the side glance that Angelina and George shared when they passed the ring back. </p><p>“Not at all! I love her so much I just have to propose! I can’t wait too long, you know?”  </p><p>“Yea... We know...” George mumbled, unsure of if he should tell his brother or let it play out for entertainment’ sake. Nothing exciting had happened in the family, drama-wise, in the last five months and he was itching to start something small just for laughs.  </p><p>“So what’s her address?” Ron asked suddenly.  </p><p>“You-You’re going to do this now?!” Angelina jumped up rather quickly and doubled down in pain, groaning and taking a seat again.  </p><p>“Well of course! Why wait?” </p><p>And so George gave Ron and Harry the address, not another word about the matter was shared apart from a good luck and an awkwardly slow pat on the back. The two stayed for another half hour before leaving, Ron determined as ever. </p><p>The moment they left, George and Angelina pulled out a few galleons and placed them on the table. "10 galleons say they find them doing the tangled sheets tango."</p><p>"10 galleons on oral."</p><p>"Language Angie! Sweet Merlin, so crass!" The two spent the rest of the night better on ridiculous things that could have spent their time so much better.</p>
