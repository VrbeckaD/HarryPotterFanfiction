  <p>After the war, I decided that I had to return to Hogwarts regardless of what my peers thought of me and despite what my mother wanted.</p>
</div><div dir="ltr" align="justify">
  <p>I once had everything from my name to my fortune, even the bloody prestige that went along with the Malfoy name but all that was in cinders.</p>
</div><div dir="ltr" align="justify">
  <p>With my family name in tatters and my family fortune gladly used for reparations for those who were injured and the rebuilding of Hogwarts, I finally had the chance to make a name for myself without the ties of my father.</p>
</div><div dir="ltr" align="justify">
  <p>I was so used to knowing everything and how the wizarding world should be but...She,<em> Her</em>, The Insufferable Know It All, Brains of THE Golden Trio came and changed that ideology.</p>
  <p>Massive unruly curls sat upon her cocoa butter kissed skin in a shade of amber and deep russet, not only was she beautiful and smart, but she was warm and kind.</p>
  <p>My best friend Pansy experienced even though she set out to turn in her best mate, Potter, thank Merlin for him and his uncanniness for sheer dumb luck or this scar wouldn't be fading against my alabaster skin.</p>
  <p>Hermione came like a whirlwind, she's everything I want but can not have. We both ended up with scars, hers the aftermath of the hatred fueled by my dark mark. It itches now as I long for her reminding me that she and I can never be,</p>
  <p>I watch from afar as she walks the castle grounds with Weasley's arms around her shoulders, her curls fly madly in the autumn breeze and her laugh floats like feather all the way up to me on my perch. Along<em> with the birds, I'll Share this lonely view</em> and that will be enough.</p>
