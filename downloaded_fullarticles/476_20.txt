  <span>It was a dream, I knew it was. Everything was green, well almost everything. And if it wasn’t green, it was like looking at a photo with the green lens on. I couldn’t help the chuckle as I took in my green toned hue. “You don't want me to get angry,” I quoted in my deepest voice I could make. “You wouldn’t like me when I’m angry.” I rolled my eyes and continued walking.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was a forest, but not any forest I recognized. For one, I couldn’t make out details further than 20 feet ahead of me. Another sign that this was a dream. Every so often I could see a squirrel, or a bunny, go scurrying from one bush to another, but those were the only signs of life I was seeing. After what felt like hours, I came across a stream, and having already reached the thirsty stage a while back, I knelt and took a deep drink.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Suddenly the quiet forest became even quieter, and I didn't even know that was possible. Keeping still, I put to use the skills my father and uncle had taught me when I was younger. Barely lifting my eyes, I scanned the other side of the stream. I wasn’t seeing anything, but given the way this forest was, that wasn’t much of a surprise either. And while I knew it was a dream, and while I didn't believe the whole “if you die in a dream you die in real life” mumbo-jumbo, I figured why test fate?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The more I focused, the further I could see. Colors started to come in, but faded tones, again like a green filter. And then I saw them. A pack of wolves. Probably about eight of them. Rather large for any known wolf in the States. And all of them were focused on me. Snarls on their faces, slowly encroaching on my position.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You don't belong here,” a voice called out from somewhere behind the wolves. “You aren’t a part of this plane of existence.” The voice sounded droll and bored, as though he was speaking of a bug that just flew into his food. I was nothing but a pest to him. “You think I don't know that,” I couldn’t keep the contempt from my voice. “Its a dream, I’m well aware that I am dreaming.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If you are dreaming, then you wouldn’t fear this.” The voice scoffed, and as though on command, the wolves lunged for me. It was a habit, ingrained from all the bad horror films I had ever watched. My mind kept telling me I wouldn’t make it, but I still ran. I had a small head start, but I knew that they would run me down.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Just don't trip, just don't trip, just don't trip...” I kept repeating the words like a mantra. And then, of course it happened. I leaped over a log, foot hooking on a branch, and I tumbled down a small hill. The wolves cleared the downed tree no problem, and were quickly upon me. The largest brought its mouth down upon my neck, my fear causing me to black out before his jaw closed….</span>
</p><p>
  <span>BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! BEEP!</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What the...” I quickly rolled across my bed, slapping my alarm off. Falling back into my pillows with a huff, I took a few moments to catch my breath. “That’s it,” I spoke to my ceiling. “No more watching Game of Thrones, while playing Inquisition, before bed.” With a sigh, I climbed out of bed and got ready for my job.</span>
