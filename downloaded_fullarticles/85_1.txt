    <p>Ron, Harry and Hermione had gone to sleep after the roller coaster their night had been.</p><p>Ron had insisted to sleep on the floor and Harry had not tried to make him change his mind after he had seen the worried look his best friend was throwing Hermione.</p><p>And they were giving up so many things for him…</p><p>The least he could do was give them some time together.</p><p>-</p><p>And now, hours later Harry was asleep and Ron was left wondering if Hermione was, until he heard her exasperated huff, making him chuckle despite of himself.</p><p>“Ron?” she breathed, turning around and he looked up, trying to see something in the dark.</p><p>(Trying to see her.)</p><p>“You’re not sleeping?” was all that he said before rolling his eyes at himself.</p><p>How was it that he always seemed to make a fool of himself when she was concerned? </p><p>It didn’t make any sense.</p><p>(Yet it did.)</p><p>She chuckled softly.</p><p>“Obviously not.”</p><p>“Sorry, that was a stupid thing to say.”</p><p>She didn’t answer for a few seconds and Ron was wondering if she had gone back to sleep.</p><p>And he wanted to ask her so many things.</p><p>But now wasn't the time.</p><p>He was starting to wonder if that time would ever come.</p><p>“Ron?”</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>She took a deep breath and he hated how small her voice was when she talked again, so far from the confident woman he had feelings for.</p><p>(Because he had deep feelings for her, there was no denying that.)</p><p>“I’m scared.”</p><p>A silence. </p><p>And now that his eyes were used to the darkness, he could see her.</p><p>Well, he could glimpse her at least.</p><p>And she seemed so afraid.</p><p>He hated to see her like that.</p><p>Would take away her pain, if he knew how to.</p><p>“I’m scared, too.” he admitted because it was Hermione, and there was in this together.</p><p>Had always been.</p><p>(Would always be.)</p><p>“She wiped her eyes and he had not realized she was crying, but then she let her hand fall over the couch, almost on the floor beside him.</p><p>"I'm sorry. This night has just been too much."</p><p>Ron wasn't really listening.</p><p>He was looking at that hand, tentatively close to his.</p><p>So, <em>so</em> close.</p><p>And he suddenly felt this urge.</p><p>He couldn’t stop it.</p><p>So he took a deep breath and raised his own hand to take hers.</p><p>“But I’m here with you.” the young man breathed.</p><p>Hermione gasped and she felt how tense she was, until she softened and intertwined their fingers together.</p><p>“I know.” she said and stroked the skin of his hand, making his heart beat faster.</p><p>Another silence.</p><p>Nothing more needed to be said for now.</p><p>They kept on holding hands, lost in thoughts.</p><p>But both feeling better, somehow.</p><p>“Ron?” she said again. </p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>She seemed to hesitate and stroked the skin of his hand again.</p><p>“You won’t let me go, right?”</p><p>He smiled and squeezed her hand.</p><p>“Not a bloody chance in the world.”</p><p>He guessed more than saw the smile on her face.</p><p>And God if he loved that smile.</p><p><em>His</em> smile.</p><p>"Good." she breathed, closing her eyes again.</p><p>And she felt as if as long he had her hand in his, everything was possible.</p><p>
  <em>Everything.</em>
</p><p>-</p><p>The next morning, Harry woke up first and saw from where their respective hands were that they had fallen asleep holding hands and he was glad that they had finally found each other in this madness. </p><p> </p><p> </p>
