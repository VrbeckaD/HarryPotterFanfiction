  <span>Hey, would you mind meeting me at 4 instead of 3? A dog just threw up on me (no, really) and I have to make a detour.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>(2:35)</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>a) Who is this? and b) Why do we have a meeting? and c) How does that even happen? Mostly a) though.</span>
  </em>

</p><p>
  <span>Oh god, sorry! New phone, wrong number! Never mind.</span>

  <em>
    <span>I'm never gonna hear that story, am I?</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>(2:39)</span>
</p><p>
  <span>You're oddly interested for a stranger. It's not even that great a story.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>(2:40)</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>What can I say? I'm stuck in an exceptionally dull class. You could've been my saviour.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>(2:41)</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Pay attention, you might get something out of it! Gotta run! Sorry again.</span>

  <em>
    <span>So yesterday I saw a dog throw up on the streets. It reminded me of you.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>(2:35)</span>

  <span>(2:37)</span>

</p><p>
  <span>What's at 2:38pm on a Thursday?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>(2:43)</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>History of Magic lecture.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>(2:45)</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That doesn't sound as boring as "normal" history.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>(2:46)</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Believe me, it is, especially when you've known this stuff since you were 10. So yes, I've got nothing to do and your number popped up in my text history.</span>

  <em>
    <span>And yet you keep replying. What does that say about you?</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>(2:52)</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Should I change my phone number? Are you gonna come find me at night and cut me open while there's creepy opera music playing in the background?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>(2:55)</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Wow. Should I change *my* number?</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>(2:56)</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I dunno, you tell me. A puppy thought I was worth puking on. Maybe that makes me detestable.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>(2:56)</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Detestable in that puppy's eyes, sure, but full on serial killer? I'm not too worried.</span>
