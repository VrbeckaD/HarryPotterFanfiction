    <p>Eleven-year-old Harry Potter was worried, something felt wrong, he felt strange and his mind felt jumbled. He felt lost, two weeks into his first year of Hogwarts and he hated it, he hated the staring and the fact that he couldn’t understand his lessons, he hated the fact that his wand felt wrong in his hand and he absolutely hated the fact that his skin felt like it wasn’t his. He had felt like this to some degree since he could remember, felt like he didn’t belong in this body but since learning about the wizarding world the feeling grew worse. He didn’t know what to do, the only person he felt that he could turn to was someone that seemed to hate him. Professor Snape. He didn’t know what was going to happen but he was going to ask the man to help him. </p><p>Harry knew that was his only opportunity to get to Snape without Ron moaning about him going to see the ‘slimy bastard’. As soon as Ron had fallen asleep Harry was out of bed and through the common room, expertly avoiding the upper years and then running through the corridors and down stairs to the dungeons. He didn’t have a clue what he was going to say to the man but he had a feeling that the man would help. He had recently followed the man to find his private quarters so that he knew where to go when the time was right. Harry proceeded cautiously when he got to the dungeons knowing that any older Slytherins would love to put him in his place. Finally he reached the portrait which guarded the potion master’s quarters, Harry hesitated, why was he doing this? The man hated him. But something deep inside told Harry that the man could help him and so Harry gathered his courage and knocked twice. His heart pounded as he waited and he flinched when the Potion master eventually answered, “Ah Potter, what have I done for you to darken my doorstep?” the man sneered. Harry could’ve cried he just wanted help.</p><p>Severus Snape had been looking forward to a relaxing evening until there was a sharp knock on the portrait outside. He sighed and made his way over, when he opened the door he was surprised to see Potter, and he automatically sneered at the boy spitting out some vitriolic comment. But after that the boy seemed to crumble before his eyes, he caught the boy just before his knees hit the floor, picking him up and carrying him through to his sitting room. He lay the young boy on the bed and was about to cast enervate at him when suddenly the boy’s body was surrounded by a bright white light and his body raised off the sofa. Severus shielded his eyes as the light got brighter and brighter until suddenly the light went out and the boy landed back on the sofa. Severus blinked the spots out of his eyes quickly and looked towards his student. At this point he was brought up short because where Harry Potter had once been lay a much younger child with golden blonde hair. Severus surged forward and kneeled next to the child his heart racing as his magic flared out, it couldn’t be. They were told that there had been no hope to find him, how was he here in the body of Harry Potter? Severus’ brain was working a mile a minute and he forced his occlumency shields up to slow down, he didn’t know that this was his missing godson, he had to take this one step at a time. He took a deep breath before pulling out his wand and casting the heriditatem spell which would show the boys closest relations. As Severus performed the spell a piece of parchment appeared in front of him.</p><p>Orion Arcturus Malfoy    7 years     Pureblood<br/>
Parents: Lucius Abraxas Malfoy<br/>
Narcissa Lucilla Malfoy nee. Black<br/>
Siblings: Draco Lucius Malfoy<br/>
Paternal Grandparents: Abraxas Sanctur Malfoy<br/>
Elizabeth Rose Malfoy nee. Prince<br/>
Maternal Grandparents: Corvus Marius Black<br/>
Druella Marie Black nee. Rosier<br/>
Aunts/Uncles: Bellatrix Lestrange nee. Black<br/>
Godparents: Severus Tobias Snape-Prince<br/>
Tom Marvolo Riddle-Slytherin<br/>
Ophella Juliet Greengrass nee. Lestrange</p><p>Severus gaped at the piece of parchment, his breath catching, Oh God it was actually him, his Godson was alive and back where he belonged. Orion had been kidnapped when he was only a year, three and a half years after the Dark Lord’s supposed downfall. Orion had been in the nursery when suddenly the wards of Malfoy manor went off alerting Lucius to an intruder. All the inhabitants of the manor had rushed up to Orion’s room, but by the time they arrived Orion was gone. They all had tried to find him and using the body of the man he was processing Tom had managed to pick up a trace of Albus Dumbledore’s magic. They had of course reported it to the ministry but no one believed them and even though they searched extensively they had never found him. Severus’ mind started to spin again, if Dumbledore had stolen Orion and disguised him as Harry Potter, what had happened to the real Harry Potter, he had obviously survived the killing curse because Dumbledore had not stolen Orion until over three years later. Severus couldn’t concentrate on that now though because his godson was starting to wake. </p><p>Harry opened his eyes slowly, his body ached like he had just been beaten by Uncle Vernon, he groaned as he stretched his sore muscles. Then he started to panic, he couldn’t see properly it was terribly blurry. He lurched up forcing his body to respond. He was panicking and he could feel his chest tightening like when he used to be shut in the cupboard under the stairs.</p><p>Severus watched as his Godson panicked his eyes going wide behind those hideous wire frames. He watched as his Godsons chest started to heave as if struggling to breathe, but it was when his godson lurched upwards that Severus decided he needed to intervene. He placed a hand on his Godsons shoulder “Harry.” The name felt foreign on Severus’ tongue “I need you to take big deep breaths for me okay? In through your nose and out through your mouth. Good boy, your body is going into shock Harry because you’ve returned to your true body, just breathe deeply.” Eventually Severus got the boy to calm down but he could still see the panic in his eyes. “Harry does anywhere hurt?” </p><p>The young boy turned towards him fully and Severus got to see the sparkling sapphire eyes for the first time in years. “Everywhere, but I can’t see properly, why can’t I see?” The young boy was getting hysterical again and so Severus did what felt natural, he scooped the boy up into his arms and placed him on his hip, the young boy buried his face into Severus’ neck as Severus bounced gently around the room. Severus suddenly remembered what the boy had said and automatically Severus knew what the problem was. He nudged the boy until he looked up at him before he plucked the ugly glasses off of his nose. “Better?” he asked gently. The little boy nodded and Severus gently sat on the sofa with him in his lap.<br/>
Severus knew that there was a high possibility that Orion would remember who he was now that whatever charms on him had been broken because Malfoys were known for their eidetic memories “Do you remember who you are?” Orion nodded slowly. “I know this must be very difficult for you Orion, but I need to contact your parents they will be so happy to see you again” </p><p>Harry nodded, no he isn’t Harry he is Orion. His head was still spinning as Uncle Severus placed him gently on the sofa ‘Oh My God Uncle Severus really’ Orion thought wildly it felt natural to call Severus that now that he had regained his memories from his first year of life. It felt strange to have memories of Harry Potters first four years of life in his mind though and even stranger to remember Dumbledore kidnapping and obliviating him. He shuddered, he really wanted his mum and dad, now that he remembered them all he wanted was a hug from them. </p><p>Severus looked up from where he was knelt on the floor trying to floo call Narcissa and Lucius, for Merlin’s sake they weren’t answering he thought hysterically, he turned to look at his Godson who was now shaking on his sofa. He quickly sent of a patronus to Lucius before standing up and making his way over to Orion who had tears silently streaming down his face. Severus’ heart broke in that moment as he saw the too large Gryffindor hanging off Orion’s shoulders, from what he could see of Orion’s skin he was covered in bruises. He gently sat on the sofa but his Godson flinched away from him anyway. “Orion.” He said slowly and the boy’s eyes immediately flickered up to his “I can’t get a hold of your Mum and Dad but I’ve messaged them and I’m sure they will be here soon.” The little boy nodded but his bottom lip was trembling and Severus couldn’t take it anymore so he scooped him up and put him on his lap. The little boy was sobbing now his little body shuddering violently “Hush Orion, I’m here I won’t let anything happen to you.” The boy kept crying until ten minutes later when he fell into an exhausted sleep. Severus sighed as he finally felt the child’s body relax into his, this was not going to be easy, he was happy that Orion was back but from what he had seen, the child was hurt and he couldn’t help but wonder where all those bruises were from. It was not twenty minutes later when Lucius and Narcissa flooed into his living room with looks of shock plastered on their faces.</p>
