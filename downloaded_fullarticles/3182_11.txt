    <p>The owl came at twenty-seven minutes past four in the morning, when the usual bustle and hum of the New York streets were reduced to a faint murmur. It swooped over the rooftops, crashed through the apartment window (open, of course, on one of the hottest days of the year), dropped the envelope into the coal scuttle, and then glided immediately out into the paling dawn.</p>
<p>Newt woke immediately and rolled over with a slight yawn, his fluffy brown hair even more disheveled than usual. Once he had sufficiently woken himself up, he retrieved the envelope from the  scuttle, shook off its coating of soot and opened it.</p>
<p>The letter was written in a spiky, spindly hand, on mottled beige parchment. It read:</p>
<p>
  <em>Dear Mr <strike>Samand</strike> <strike>Scrama </strike> Scamander,</em>
</p>
<p><em>I have heard about you from my neighbor Biloxi, who heard about you from the landlady Mrs McQuiggle, who heard about you from Ophelia the milliner’s niece, who heard about you from her aunt’s customer Queenie Goldstein, and I wondered if I could trouble you with a little problem I have at the moment. I run a second-hand wand shop in Queens </em>(a second-hand wand shop! thought Newt. That was something he had never seen in England), <em>and several of my customers have been complaining about seeing Bowtruckles running round the place. I haven’t seen any myself, but several of the wands have gone missing from the shelves, and if I’ve got a Bowtruckle infestation then I’m afraid it will be bad for business. Could you possibly come and check it out? There are some pest control people in the area who deal with this sort of thing, but they charge far too much and I’m short of Dragots at the moment.</em></p>
<p>
  <em>Yours gratefully,</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Hadley J. Houtkooper</em>
</p>
<p>The address at the top of the letter was for an area of Queens which, although not usually frequented by witches and wizards, did have a small magical community and presumably a couple of magical shops. As Newt had never seen that part of New York before, he would have to walk instead of Apparating. Never mind - it was a lovely morning for walking, with the birds already singing in the warm skies, and the streets were still free of bustle. </p>
<p>Newt gently stroked the leaves on the head of the Bowtruckle who had just clambered into his pyjama pocket. “I think you might be getting some new friends for a while, Pickett,” he murmured. He was glad that Houtkooper hadn’t called the ‘pest control people’ - they probably wouldn’t have much respect for Bowtruckles, and would treat them like vermin. Newt wasn’t like that. He understood the creatures he dealt with, and treated them with the respect they deserved.</p>
<p>A while later, Newt was walking through the dusty streets of Queens with his suitcase in his hand. Dressed in a long Prussian-blue coat and yellow scarf, he stood out like a rare, colourful flower against the backdrop of grey houses and grey streets. The only shops he could see here were a little coffee-house and a dilapidated building which appeared to be an empty antiques store. However, the antiques store must have had an anti-Muggle charm placed on it (or, as the locals would say, an anti-No-Maj spell), because as he got closer, the air in front of it seemed to shimmer, and suddenly the store had transformed into a squat little wand-shop with a sign that read:</p>
<p>
  <em>HOUTKOOPER’S WANDS, second-hand. Bought, sold and traded.</em>
</p>
<p>In the window was a placard onto which someone had painted, firstly the word “CLOSED”, and above that, a pair of large, roving green eyes. The eyes rested upon Newt for a moment or two, then they widened as though with recognition and the whole placard gave a sort of trembling jump, so that now the side reading “OPEN” was facing the window. As Newt entered the shop, the eyes followed him for a few seconds before blinking and resuming their original position. </p>
<p>The interior of the shop was almost as dusty as the street outside. Slender wand-boxes were stacked in pyramids against the walls and on the windowsill. In one corner, there was a large, rather startled-looking Long-Eared Owl (the same owl that had woken Newt up that morning), perched on what looked like a brass hatstand.</p>
<p>In another corner was a doorway covered by a slightly shabby curtain, and it was from behind this curtain that the proprietor of the shop emerged.</p>
<p>Mr Houtkooper was one of those deflated-looking men who were once quite sturdily built, but then gradually lost weight over the years until they were like a balloon that had been let down. He was in his late forties, with greying hair and the same coloured eyes as the ones on the placard. His robes could have been almost any hue, they were so faded, but the little tasselled hat that he wore was caramel-coloured with a tawny trim. “You’re Mr Scamander, right?” he said, hand outstretched.</p>
<p>Newt took the proffered hand and shook it politely. “Please, call me Newt,” he replied. As Mr Houtkooper hadn’t offered him a chair, he perched against the edge of the counter as the shopkeeper explained the details of his “little problem”.</p>
<p>It seemed that Houtkooper didn’t know very much about Bowtruckles - which was was understandable, as they were not usually found in America - but he was aware that they could become quite vicious when they felt threatened. “Like I said,” he concluded , “I ain’t seen none here myself, but my customers been complainin’ an’ I got to do somethin’ about it before I got to shut the shop down. That’s what I called you heah for.”</p>
<p>Newt assured him that he would have the Bowtruckles out in no time. He searched in his pockets and pulled out a pouch of what looked like tiny, iridescent beads.</p>
<p>”What’re those for?” asked Houtkooper.</p>
<p>”These are fairy eggs,” Newt explained. “Bowtruckles are especially fond of them.” He started searching around the shop in every nook and cranny, having chosen his softest-soled shoes to wear that morning so that he didn’t frighten the creatures into deeper hiding. Yet after nearly two hours of searching, not a single leaf, stem or shoot of a Bowtruckle was to be seen.</p>
<p>”I don’t suppose you would mind if I took a look upstairs, would you?” he asked.</p>
<p>”Not at all, not at all,” Houtkooper assured him. So the search continued upstairs.</p>
<p>”Aha,” said Newt, pointing to the sloping wooden door of a small closet. “What’s in here?”</p>
<p>”Oh, just some cleanin’ stuff,” Houtkooper replied, “ ‘cept I don’t use most of it these days, seein’ as that closet’s fulla spiders an’ woodlice an’ the like.”</p>
<p>”That’s good. Excellent. Good.” Newt quickly spotted his client’s puzzled expression. “Another favourite Bowtruckle snack, woodlice. Pickett loves them... Pickett, my Bowtruckle. I left him some in here.” He patted his suitcase. “Now, let’s see if they’ve made themselves at home in your cupboard.”</p>
<p>The door was, unsurprisingly, unlocked. (Bowtruckles are excellent lock-pickers, with their long twiglike fingers). Newt held the pouch of fairy eggs open in front of the door, then slowly and carefully pulled it open.</p>
<p>There was indeed a small creature at the back of the closet, and it was indeed a rather twiggy-looking being with branchlike fingers and a leafy head. But it was not a Bowtruckle.</p>
<p>”That,” observed Newt with apparent fascination, “is not a Bowtruckle.” He drew his wand from his pocket and said, “Lumos!”</p>
<p>The little creature was illuminated by the light from Newt’s wand. Apparently it had started its own stash of wands, because there were seven or eight of them stacked on the shelf behind its head. It blinked its round, dark eyes in the wandlight and moved defensively in front of its new collection.</p>
<p>“Hello,” said Newt with a small grin, lowering his wand. “And who might you be?”</p>
<p>He hadn’t really expected a response, but he certainly got one. The creature raised its head defiantly and gave an indignant little shout.</p>
<p>“I...Am...GROOT!”</p>
