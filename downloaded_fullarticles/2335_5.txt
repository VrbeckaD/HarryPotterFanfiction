    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p>A cool breeze swirled with the scent of salt and provided some relief from the suns warm rays. Positioned behind an old wooden post, you carefully watched the movement of a figure above through the cracks of the dock. Your (insert color choice) tail maneuvered through the water as silently as you could as you continued to follow the footsteps and shadow from above. Several emotions jumbled around in your head. You were anxious, your heart was beating fast, but you were also curious and feeling inquisitive. However, this wasn’t an entirely new situation for you.</p><p>You remember when humans would come to this part of the cove during the summer months to swim and play along the beach, smiling and collecting shells as the sun fell down back behind the horizon. Though you remember those happy and fascinating times of watching the young humans play about, you also remembered the times when the humans caught sight of your pod members swimming about, and as a result, they populated the area.</p><p>They brought along their boats and their metal boxes. They brandished their sharp harpoons and tossed thin string that made your skin bleed when it wrapped around you. They tried to get their hands on all of you, no matter the cost. You watched them try to pluck the scales off your sisters and snip the colored hair off of your childhood friends. You had even lost sight of a young merman that you used to see helping his mother in her garden, and though everyone had their suspicions of what happened, you dared not speak of the nightmare.</p><p>As a result, the rest of you now stayed hidden deep beneath the waves, whether the humans were out there or not. There hadn’t been another human along the shores in ages. For protection, no one was allowed above water, but you still couldn’t help but occasionally sneak up to the surface to see the wonderful things you missed, like the stars, the moon, and the cool breeze that would send chills along your skin. This time was different though, there was a human. You felt alarmed, but at the same time, it still felt different. You couldn’t assume that he was here for other reasons besides harmful ones yet.</p><p>The wooden boards whined out and creaked as the bottom of the mysterious human’s boots dragged along the surface until the came to a stop just at the edge. Being careful not to cause too many ripples, you moved even closer, the curiosity of it all drawing you in. You swam gracefully beneath, sinking back ever so slightly into the water at the echo of the human’s voice.</p><p>“It’s more beautiful than the shopkeeper said it was, Pickett,” Newt smiled down at the Bowtruckle who was popping out of his pocket, “I…No Pickett don’t be silly. Nothing’s going to hurt us. I’m sure those stories of the merpeople were simply because they misunderstood them. You know, they even thought you were going to somehow snap their finger off.”</p><p>Pickett chirped back, still unconvinced as he snuggled back down into the pocket. The breeze swept through Newt’s curls as the sunlight highlighted their golden hue. “I’m just going to do some observations for right now, then we can head back to the room,” he said setting his case down on the dock.</p><p>Your heart began to hammer once more. This human was looking for Merpeople, and who was this Pickett, were they another human? Did they want to hurt you? He seemed, or at least sounded, non-threatening.</p><p>You didn’t want to get too close, but you also wanted to see what the intention of this human was. However, you knew that you had already been missing above water for a while, and it wouldn’t be long until someone got suspicious.<br/>
You slipped back under the waves, a little louder than you should have, only to miss seeing Newt hurriedly look around to see who had caused the mysterious splashing.</p><p>-----<br/>
The next day, you returned to the surface, but this time, at night. You had contemplated between going back up or staying below to avoid running into any possible trouble with the human, if he decided to come back, but you couldn’t resist the urge to marvel up at the stars. Besides, humans usually slept at night, right?</p><p>Breaking the surface of the waves, the night air sent a cool and refreshing sensation over your body. You smiled and looked up at the stars, bobbing along with the current; how beautiful it was to watch them flicker and glow for neverending miles. The moon’s light helped to illuminate the water, making every ripple stand out like lightning against the dark. It was unlike anything you had below the sea, and to you, everything was so enchantingly mesmerizing.</p><p>You were about to swim over to your usual stargazing spot, but you heart leapt when you looked over towards the dock. There he was, the human.<br/>
This time however, he was laid out on his stomach, his hand lazily hanging over the edge of the dock, just barely letting his fingertips sway in the water. His head was resting on his arm on top of his notebook, his hair falling over his eyes. Steady breaths moved his back up and down, and you came to the conclusion that the human was in fact, asleep.</p><p>With your curiosity grabbing hold of you, you quietly swam over to him to where you were nearly face to face. The water dripped off of you as you hosited yourself up closer. You weren’t supposed to be above the surface, let alone near a human, but something told you to go closer. Perhaps it really was your fascination and old memories of the kind humans of times long gone that drove you there, or maybe is was apprehension and fear in seeing if he was a threat or not. As you approached him, you looked over his features, taking in the details. His face was scattered with clusters of freckles while his hand had bits of black smudges, like the ones on his journal page. His lips moved only slightly was he slept, and his curly locks danced in the wind.</p><p>How long has he been out here like this, you wondered, has he been here in the same spot since yesterday?He seemed so peaceful and still, and from your observation yesterday, he didn’t seem so bad, just a quiet observer like yourself.</p><p>That’s what you thought, until your eyes fell upon the purple scales that sat next to his other hand. Your eyes widened at the sight. Those were merpeople scales, scales from your pod.</p><p>Why did he have them? He must have…</p><p>You gasped involuntarily. The shock was overtaking you as you backed away, but for some reason, it still froze you, paralyzed you, and made you unable to dive back under for safety. It was like your tail and fins were moving to take you away, but your body isn’t reacting the way it should have. You struggled in the water and in your mind. Everything was happening so fast, and before you knew it, you were met with two beaming blue eyes staring at you. You felt yourself getting more and more overwhelmed by the situation. You head was spinning and everything was coming into your brain at a hundred miles an hour. It was hectic for you to process, so you were there, frozen in the moonlight in front of your kid’s worst enemy. The man’s lips were moving but you couldn’t prices what he was saying, was he moving towards you, what was he trying to do?<br/>

“M-Merlin I’m sorry. I startled you I…” Newt’s eyes kept falling from you fearful face down to your tail which was still falling about, “I didn’t mean for…I mean you absolutely no harm. Not in the slightest.” He put his hands up as worry took over his features at the sight of you. He was supposed to care for magical creatures and beings, not harm them or make them feel like they’re in danger.</p><p>Your heart rate was still escalating, and you didn’t even notice the tears in your eyes until this moment. He was breathing heavy and now on his knees, hands still up and away in an attempt to show you he sincerely meant no harm.</p><p>“I am so sorry. I’m sorry. I really don’t mean to disturb you or cause you any harm. I only wanted to get to know more about your kind. I heard about the rumors and the legends and the stories. I just wanted to learn more and write about you. P-possibly as an addition to my book,” he spoke softly between heavy, nervous breaths.</p><p>You looked over him, eyes still wide and heart still, but slowing, beating hard within you. You summoned a small piece of courage, still wary of him before saying, “You have those scales. Those are a part of us. How did you get them?” you stared right at him, “Did you rip those off, steal them, hurt them like the others did?”</p><p>His eyes widened, both from your words and at the thought that someone would do such a thing. The shopkeeper told them about the merpeople being violent, but seemed to leave out the part about the violent acts that his people could have carried out.</p><p>“No, never. I-I actually found these towards the start of the dock. I only wanted to look at them for my research, and I had no idea that they were taken in such a way. I thought perhaps someone had shed them off and perhaps the tide carried them over,” he frowned as he spoke, his eyes diverting down to the scales, “I am so sorry for my invasion, ignorance, and disrespect.”</p><p>Your face softened. You could see it in his expression and you could feel it in your heart, he wasn’t here like the others. He wasn’t lying or planning to blindside you to get what wasn’t his. He was apologizing and being sincere.</p><p>He was a kind human?</p><p>Now treading at a calmer pace, you swam over to where the scales were and scooped them into your hands. Uttering a soft murmur of goodbyes and wishes to whoever they belonged to in hopes that they were in a better place, wherever they may be, you set your hands within the water and let the scales sink gently down to the bottom of the sea.</p><p>He watched in silence and awe, still rooted to his spot on the dock.You took a deep breath and then looked up at him and into his eyes, calmly asking, “You’re really not here to go after us or try to hurt us?”</p><p>“I promise, I’m not here to hurt you. If it would be better though I will gladly give you space and-” he began shuffling back to pick up his things.<br/>
You shook your head, murmuring with some hesitation,“No, its okay.”<br/>
-----<br/>
Over the next few weeks, you continued to sneak up above the surface, but instead of just going to see the sky and feel the wind on your face, it was also to visit Newt, as you now learned his name. After your frantic first meeting, you had talked a little more with Newt. You brushed aside your hesitancy and determined that he wasn’t trying to harm you, just like he promised.</p><p>Along with that, he was also entirely there for the opposite reason, to research for the protection of those like you. You would wander up from the depths, avoiding your family or anyone else who would certainly punish you for violating the way of life like you always did. You knew that if they had found out you went above and were in contact with a human, things would never be the same, ever.</p><p>You were still hesitant for a bit, but after watching and speaking with him for awhile, you had found yourself a wonderful friend. You’d watch him write and doodle pictures in his notes, and he’d listen to your stories in astonishment. After learning he was a wizard, you’d sometimes watch him show you little spells, which of course captivated you. He even introduced you to the mysterious Pickett, who was not another human, but was instead a little creature called a Bowtruckle that you got along with quite well.</p><p>The moment the two of you really bonded was when you invited him into the water with you. It was early in the morning and you brought him to one of you hidden “shallow spots” as you liked to call it as no one ventured there since it was so close to the surface. You knew if you were there, the risk of either you, or more importantly Newt, being caught was smaller. You thought he’d be confused at the situation but moments later, the two of you were splashing around like you had grown up as childhood best friends. You weren’t sure if it was the sparkle of excitement in his eyes, his boisterous laugh, or just him, but something in you heart felt different. You felt safe and at peace, and your heart would flutter at a rapid rate, but instead of it being out of apprehension, it was something much different and deeper.</p><p>You were falling for a human.<br/>
-----<br/>
You had met Newt that afternoon back at the edge of the old dock, but instead of him listening to you about what it was like being a mermaid, it was his turn to continue teaching you about stuff from his world.</p><p>He’d bring objects, pictures, and even sometimes a snack or two for you to experiment with, and in all honesty, he found it amazing how excited you got as curiosity consumed you.</p><p>“And this is a…” your voice said, trailing off in confusion at the new object in your hand.</p><p>Newt smiled softly, legs crossed and hand in his lap, “That’s a pocket watch, we use them to tell time.”</p><p>“So the little line just goes on and on forever?” You proposed, raising an eyebrow up slightly.</p><p>“Well, not exactly. Sometimes they break or stop working right or,” his fingers ran over the top, “You use this little bit to wind it and change the time, or to reset it…”</p><p>Newt trailed off on his words as he watched you with intriguing fascination, but not like he was studying one of his creatures. It was more along the lines of the adoration one would feel when acquainted with the feeling of innocent young love. He didn’t see you as another one of the many creatures he set off to observe, you were exceptionally different. You were a mystery, and you were a treasure. However, you were more than just another creature to be printed onto his journal pages.</p><p>He watched intently as your fingers traced over the sleek surface of the watch. Droplets of water fell from your hands back down to disrupt the surface of the sea. The ripples grew larger and larger, until suddenly they blended in with the incoming current. The past few weeks had shown him more than just what he came to research. You were unique, incredible, and on top of that absolutely beautiful. You were like no one he’d ever met before, and even if he tried to deny the pink blush or weightless feeling that came upon him whenever you laughed or played with his hand or were just being yourself, he’d be no match for his overpowering feelings. Even after he headed back to the room he was staying in, you’d still occupy his thoughts as he tried to fall back asleep.</p><p>Breaking out of his thoughts, he said, “Y/n, I um…I have another thing to show you but it has to be night or else it won’t really work all that well. In fact that’s the whole purpose of it otherwise it’s just there and not really doing anything so we uh…I have to get it later.”</p><p>You laughed at his rambling, your heart skipping a beat again. His adorable ways had certainly pulled you in too deep.</p><p>After a little more research, and a little splash fight (that you won courtesy of using your tail to your advantage), night had fallen upon you. Your upper body was on the dock, head resting on your crossed arms as you looked at the sky. Newt was next to you, rummaging through a little bag, his hair and shirt still damp from earlier. His presence was comforting to you, and the stars seemed so much brighter than they had on other nights prior to the fateful day you met him.</p><p>Newt cleared his throat, as he was slightly nervous, “Okay so about the surprise earlier,” he said as he scooted closer to you with an object wrapped in cloth. He bit his lip and ran his fingers through his hair, “This is what I wanted to show you.”</p><p>His hand moved to uncover the object and you heart was beating out of excitement. Setting the cloth down, he now held a goldish colored thing that looked like a larger and broken up version of his wand.</p><p>You pulled yourself more onto the dock and asked, “Newt, what is that?”</p><p>Newt smiled at you, giving you the object to hold, “This is a telescope, love,” he looked over to see your reaction and internally your heart went wild at his nickname for you. “It’s something we humans use to look through to see things for far away, or more importantly,” he carefully slipped his hands with yours to position it the right way so you could see through it, “to look up at the stars.”</p><p>Your mouth fell open slightly, your tail flicking the water out of excitement. Newt got closer to you, helping you adjust it and set it the right way again until you saw the sky like you’ve never seen.</p><p>The stars you’d grown to love and wander over were now bigger and closer than before. The moon was no longer a white spot, but now a larger magnificent orb. All the stars were so close it felt if you reached your hands out, surely you’d catch more than a few. You had never imagined the sky could be any more stunning, but tonight, Newt had proven you wrong in the greatest way.</p><p>“Newt I, Newt this is amazing!” you said, bringing up the telescope to your eyes once more, your smile getting even larger.</p><p>Newt blushed and said, “I-I know how you said much you love the stars and everything, and I j-just wanted you to have something that you could use so you could always experience them like this. Your curiosity is an amazing and beautiful thing, Y/n.”</p><p>“W-wait so this is…” you looked up into his eyes noticing how close you both really were to each other. Your heartbeat was mimicking the thundering waves as it got louder and louder in your chest.</p><p>Newt nodded, “It’s yours, all yours. Look here.” Newt’s hands connected with yours as he rolled the telescope around.</p><p>Tears began to well up in your eyes and you ran your fingers over the engraved surface. ‘For Y/n. Follow the stars, love’, it read.</p><p>“Thank you Newt, oh thank you!” Your arms flung around him, and he set the telescope down softly, pulling you even closer. Though you had been mostly out of the water, your arms and hair were still a little wet, further dampening his already wet shirt, not that he minded. You had hugged before, but this hug felt different. It was exhilarating yet calming at the same time.</p><p>His firm arms held you securely and you never felt more at home. You pulled away after a bit, but you were still situated within his arms. Inches apart, you looked into his beautiful blue eyes and him into your (eye color) ones, and it was like the sound of the crashing waves had died off into nothingness. It was tranquil and still. It was in balance, it was only you and Newt, nothing else mattered in this moment.</p><p>Newt’s lip quivered and his hair blew in the breeze that began to pick up. He tried to formulate words but he couldn’t think straight.</p><p>He was still holding you. Why was he still holding you isn’t that weird? Merlin what was he to say? Why can’t he move?</p><p>“Y/n, “ he started, “I um…I’ve felt that I…”</p><p>Why was this so difficult?</p><p>He started again, with you still in his arms, and at this point, close to being on his lap, “I’ve felt feelings. Um, I’ve… You’re incredible Y/n. You’re smart, curious, kind,” he paused at your fingers running over his arm, his goosebumps sending a shiver throughout his body, “You’re caring and absolutely and utterly beautiful. I came here to research your kind, but I found you along the way, and honestly, I-I think I’ve, no, Merlin, Yn, I have fallen for you.”</p><p>Your heart pounded in your chest and you wanted to just pull him into a kiss and never let go, but he looked like he had more to say, so you listened.</p><p>He continued, “Y/n I don’t want it to sound weird, or that it’s just because you’re a mermaid or any of that, I just can’t help these feelings for you. I’m sorry if I overstepped I’m sure I have I just, I’m sor-”</p><p>You cut off his rambling by leaning in to kiss him, your hand rested on his chin, pulling him in more. His eyes fluttered closed in absolute bliss. Your cool fingers brought a gentle touch to his blushing skin, and he wrapped his arms around you. You were fully in his lap as he held you now, his hands roaming along the curves of your hips and back. Water was everywhere now but neither of you cared. Newt’s heart felt like it could explode out of his chest and he could die a happy man with you right now. He deepened the kiss, a small moan of adoration and desire coming from within him as he he became more overcome with the kiss. You broke away only monetarily to catch your breath before kissing him again, your fingers running through his soft hair. He felt the same, he wanted you and cared for you as you did for him. He was beautiful, absolutely beautiful. A beautiful man with a beautiful heart that was worth more than any treasure of the deep.</p><p>You and Newt eventually broke the kiss again. Newt rested his forehead to your own, trying to even out his breathing.</p><p>You broke the silence and giggled, “I can’t help my feelings for you either.”</p><p>Newt laughed, his eyes crinkling slightly with his large smile. He held you still, his arm securely around your waist.</p><p>“But Newt,” you asked. “Doesn’t it bother that there’s, you know,” you gestured to your obvious tail in worry, for who would want to be with someone who was extremely different in a completely forbidden relationship? You could both be in deep and dangerous trouble if things were to go badly. Besides, you looked much different than him…could he really want you?</p><p>Newt answered your question by first kissing your cheek and tightening his hold, “Y/n, of course it doesn’t bother me. Is it different, of course, but love, that doesn’t matter to me. If you don’t want anything, that’s perfectly alright, but I care about you and don’t want to let you go, especially over something as beautiful and intriguing as who you are.”</p><p>You smiled, a tear rolling down your cheek again, “Of course I want you Newt, I’m just not normal. I don’t want things to be weird for you.</p><p>Shaking his head, Newt replied, “It’s not weird, you’re different. Besides, it’s not like I’m exactly normal either, love.”</p><p>You laughed, your fins flipping again. Once again, you pulled Newt into another loving kiss. Forbidden or not, Newt cared for you and you cared for him. With all current worries and the ocean still churning out waves behind you, you rested on the dock with Newt. Your heart was always yearning for the wonders of the surface, but you could have never predicted that your heart would stay up there in the gentle hands of a human.</p>
