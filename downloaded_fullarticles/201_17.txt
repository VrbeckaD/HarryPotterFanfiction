    <p>Draco loves his hair, alright? He takes care of it with the best shampoo ever <em>(which is also very, very expensive)</em> and uses the best hair gel ever to exist too and he takes good, good, <em>awesome</em> care of it-</p>
<p><br/>
he was born with great hair, like his father before him, and his father before him - it's a Malfoy family trait-<br/>
<em>great, pretty, blond hair-</em><br/>
and Draco is a <em>Malfoy</em> and Malfoys take care of their family heirlooms.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And Harry-<br/>
Harry fucking Potter, with his messier than messy, jet-black hair dares-<br/>
this bastard dares to touch <em>his</em> expensive hair shampoo during showers.</p>
<p><br/>
He dares to wash his greasy, untidy, messy, jet-black hair with Draco's expensive hair shampoo for blond hair specifically-<br/>
and Draco loses it.</p>
<p>"Dude, calm down. It's just a shampoo, relax, Malfoy " Harry fucking Potter says and Draco takes a step towards him, naked and wet from the shower-</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>For the record, they've known each other since 5th grade, since they were eleven and Harry moved to the city, and since the humiliation, they were sworn enemies through school years.</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco thought he'd finally be free of Harry Potter when he got a letter from a prestige university, but no, <em>no.</em><br/>
Harry Potter got into the same university too.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And now they play soccer together, in college, on the same team.<br/>
They go to the same frat and sorority parties and they have to watch each other's faces during classes.</p>
<p>It's torture.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Especially when Draco has to watch Harry fucking Potter <em>naked and wet and washing his hair with his expensive shampoo.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Deep breaths, Draco, deep, deep, calming breaths, <em>you don't want to make a scene while you're naked and-</em><br/>
<em>fuck, they're both naked-</em></p>
<p><br/>
"Don't ever touch my stuff, do you hear that, Potter?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, yeah. Get the stick out of your ass, will you, Malfoy?" Harry says and-</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>that's a great line to say when they're both naked, in the showers-</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>so they fake cough, since the silence got way too uncomfortable for when they're naked-</p><hr/>
<p>They end up fighting during Philosophy class, not because they don't agree on the given topic, but because they're them-</p>
<p>
  <em>Draco and Harry, Harry and Draco-</em>
</p>
<p>they've always been fighting and arguing and they're sworn enemies, so...</p>
<p> </p>
<p>and the professor and students are already used to their yelling matches, so they just groan and let them have it.</p>
<p>At least the class is interesting.</p><hr/>
<p>They're in the showers again, after the practice, and they end up fighting again, during the showers and they get too close to each other-</p>
<p><br/>
<em>and Draco finds himself mesmerized by his almond shaped, green eyes-</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>which isn't all, no-</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>no, Draco notices that Harry is handsome.</em> The bastard is handsome and he gets hard when he looks at Harry fucking Potter naked.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>Draco is straight, alright? He is straight! He dated Pansy for years, he dated Daphne's little sister Astoria last year, he is straight!</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>Straight, straight, straight.</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He just didn't get laid in a long time, that's all.</p>
<p>
  <em>That's all.</em>
</p><hr/>
<p>It's a sorority party, and Draco is invited, because Daphne is in a sorority and so is Pansy, and he's friends with them.</p>
<p>And Harry is there too, <em>somehow</em>, which doesn't make sense, since Hermione is in a different one, and it's not like a loser like him has any other friends, right?</p>
<p>But he's here, and he's in a group of friends, and he notices him. He scowls, and he scowls back.</p>
<p><br/>
<em>They, uh...</em> They end up <em>dancing</em>, together, and <em>uh</em>-</p>
<p> </p>
<p>they're wasted, both of them, so obviously, they go to get more drinks and he's not sure who speaks first-</p>
<p> </p>
<p>but they end up arguing, fighting, neither of them knowing about what, even-</p>
<p>"I hate your shiny, pretty, blond hair and your smirk and your abs-"</p>
<p>"And I hate <em>your </em>green eyes and messy hair and <em>your</em> smile-"</p>
<p>"Fuck you for making me question my sexuality, you and your pretty hair, Malfoy-"</p>
<p>"<em>Wait, what</em>?"</p>
<p>"What what?" Harry asks, and his eyes widen in realization.</p>
<p>"You got hard too?"</p>
<p>"I mean... <em>yeah</em>." Harry answers, uncertain.</p>
<p>"<em>Fuck</em>."</p>
<p>"<em>Fuck</em>. I still hate your shiny hair-"</p>
<p>"Say something about my hair, <em>again</em>, and I <em>swear</em>, Potter, I will fucking <em>end</em> you-"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>and then their lips are on each others's, biting, teeth and tongue and-</p>
<p>
  <em> well, shit.</em>
