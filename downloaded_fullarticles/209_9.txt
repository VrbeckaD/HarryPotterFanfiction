    <p>
  <span>“ Miss Parkinson, your two o'clock is here.” said the small, silvery long-eared dog as it bounced into Pansy's office five minutes later than she'd expected it. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It was a painfully cutesy patronus that perfectly matched the sweet-tempered girl she'd hired to run the front desk. She and Lavender hadn't gotten along particularly well in school but hiring her was one of the best business decisions that Pansy had ever made. The witch might grate on her nerves now and again, but clients were much more receptive to being greeted by a bouncy woman who always answered the floo with a smile on her face than they were to the beautiful but chilly debutantes that Pansy had been raised with.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Of course the front desk attendant served another purpose. The contrast of seeing Lavender surrounded by pristine white marble and bamboo green before coming through to the dark, glossy interior of Pansy's personal office made one thing very clear to clients. The woman they came to contract with was the opposite of the one in the waiting room.  </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>A bitch. With good taste. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Still, every time the cavalier king charles spaniel bounded into her office she had to fight the urge to send a scourgify at the spot where it landed, not quite sure that it couldn't leave behind a splash of drool. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Pansy stowed the witch weekly she'd been reading in her desk and made sure that her garnet silk blouse laid nicely across her chest, trusting in the charm she'd used to affix her matte lipstick firmly to her mouth. Everything accounted for, she thought hard about the night a mermaid had come to the Slytherin common room window and conjured her own patronus, an elegant serval that she absolutely loved, and asked Lavender to send in her two o'clock in. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The woman who strode through the door was not at all the Ginny Weasley she remembered from school. She recalled brown eyes in a pale face that looked even younger than she was, and legs so long that she'd have looked clumsy if she hadn't been constantly in motion, fidgeting and flirting with her rowdy group of Gryffindors in the great hall. Relying completely on her natural charisma for any attention she got and not seeming to think much of girls who didn't do the same. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Frankly Pansy rarely noticed the girl at all when she did bother to look in that direction, not with Draco one seat down muttering about how much he hated Potter or Granger or Ginny's older brother. What she remembered was just the leftovers from that inner voice that reduced every other woman around her down to a set of vitals that let Pansy rank their marriage prospects. She hated that voice; it sounded too much like her mother. And if being in the wedding business had taught her anything, it was that who ended up with whom was nearly impossible to predict. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Of course, she'd seen promotional material from the Holyhead Harpies featuring Ginny since the last time she'd seen her in person, but that Ginny was always in her quidditch gear, frequently dirty and always wind-mussed. It begged a different kind of rundown: goal differential, captaincy potential, injuries sustained; none of which Pansy was particularly interested in. The only other time Pansy had seen her was when Theo and Granger had tied the knot and it was hard to get a handle on someone's aesthetic when you were the one who'd picked out their clothes. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Though Ginny had looked absolutely divine in the emerald green floor-length velvet bridesmaid's gown, if you asked Pansy.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The Ginny Weasley standing in her office was something else. She was wearing muggle clothing, which Pansy infinitely approved of. It gave them a lot more options when it came to wedding dress styles if a witch could be open to muggle fashions. Her denims were narrow and cuffed at the ankle, revealing a tatty looking pair of red trainers. Her champange-coloured top was large and comfortable-looking, the wide collar nearly hanging off one of her shoulders, and ticked all over with tiny, hazy polkadots. She looked casually elegant, like she'd finally grown into her limbs and stopped trying to prove herself. At least her face was still an absolute riot of freckles, and the hair, that was the same, brassy red and pulled back into a messy ponytail. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She was gut-wrenchingly pretty but Pansy couldn't let herself dwell on it. The women who came for her services were absolutely off limits.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“ Nice digs, Pansy.” the other woman said with a wide smile, taking in the drastic change from the waiting room. “ This looks more like I would have imagined your office. To be honest, I was a bit worried when I came into that lobby and saw Lavender.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“ The lobby is a testament to what most of my clients want from me. Cheery, bright, mostly white. I need them to know I can give them what they are looking for, but if I'm choosing for myself,” she let her voice trail off as she gestured ambiguously at the office around them. The lacquered furniture blended into the glossy black walls, the effect broken only by several pieces of graphic artwork, mostly of Pansy's own creation. The artwork was imbued with magic so that the long-legged, faceless figures could walk in and out of their frames, their sketched outfits billowing around them. “ I look best in darker colors.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“ All the black does make your skin glow. I just have to avoid oranges because of the,” Ginny pointed at her coppery hair. “ You know.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Pansy liked women who weren't afraid to make fun of themselves. It was easier for her to be around people who wouldn't fuss if she made a self-deprecating joke about her nose or the dark circles under her eyes that she refused to glamour. Maybe working for a Weasley would be less miserable than she had imagined. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“ Well, since you're here to see me I'm guessing congratulations are in order for you and Mr. Potter?” She began, picking up her favorite glass quill and starting her notes. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“ Yes,” Ginny said, holding up her hand and wiggling her fingers so that the light from the large window behind the desk glinted off the sharp diamond on her finger. “ We've been shacked up for five years now. I think my mum would have had a conniption if we hadn't announced the engagement by Christmas.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Interfering mother of the bride</span>
  </em>
  <span>, Pansy scribbled in her notes. That could quickly become a problem. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“ When are you hoping to have the ceremony?” Pansy asked, gesturing at the open armchair across her desk. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“ I think Harry wants to have it near Halloween.” Ginny replied, tucking her feet up underneath her as she settled into the chair. “ That's at the end of the season so I should be able to manage some time off near then without missing games.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Work is a high priority</span>
  </em>
  <span>, Pansy added to the list. It wasn't a downside, in her opinion. Hopefully it meant that Ginny wouldn't be tempted to move things around and change the schedule on her a dozen times. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“ It's a good time of year to get married. Everyone wants a summer wedding because of the flowers, but we are magic; you can have an outdoor wedding in the fall no problem.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“ To be honest I don't even know what I want other than I don't want to have it at the Burrow like every other wedding I've been to, except Hermione's.” Ginny looked down at the frayed hem of her denims, suddenly not willing to meet Pansy's eyes. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Guilty about breaking with tradition???</span>
  </em>
  <span> Pansy scribbled, pausing after she underlined the question marks for clarity, pen still poised over the page. What was the other witch's sudden discomfort about, more pressure from her mother? Or could it be she was </span>
  <em>
    <span>Disinterested in planning?</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“ You'd be shocked by how many brides don't really know what they want,” Pansy offered, leaning back in her chair and sighing internally at the idea of doing another quidditch nut's wedding- generic and boring, complete with sports paraphernalia for a personal touch. Sporty girls seemed to get so uncomfortable with liking anything pretty that they couldn't enjoy their own weddings. It's what she'd been dreading when Ginny made the appointment. She'd hoped that the other woman's attire had been a sign that it wasn't the case. “That's what I'm here for: to figure out what you want and give it to you.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“ Thank god you have good taste then.” Ginny said with a chuckle, reaching into her bag and tossing a selection of muggle and wizarding wedding magazines onto the desk.  “ I looked through these wedding catalogs and it's all so overwhelming. Nothing in them looks real.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Pansy carefully put away the catalog selections she'd been about to pull forward, some of which the other woman had just put in front of her. It didn't seem disinterest in planning was the problem. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She thumbed through, stopping to review the pages Ginny had tabbed with special attention. The magazines in front of her were fairly comprehensive. There were simple weddings, over the top weddings, every theme under the sun. Usually when a bride brought in something like this she would have added some tabs to the things that really inspired her, but Ginny's tabs all read things like </span>
  <em>
    <span>this is obscene</span>
  </em>
  <span>, </span>
  <em>
    <span>nothing is this perfect</span>
  </em>
  <span>, or most conclusively </span>
  <em>
    <span>No top hats</span>
  </em>
  <span>. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“ A top hat can be nice in the right setting,” Pansy said with a grin, tapping that particular note before flipping back to a page with a fairly classic first kiss picture on it. The wizard had the witch bent back just a bit over his arm under an arbour dripping wisteria and ivy, one long sleeve of the witch's robes fluttering in the wind. “ You wrote 'boring' here. What exactly bores you about this.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“ The kiss looks fake.” Ginny replied, leaning forward to tap where the two faces joined. “ I don't know why, but nothing about it looks like these are two people in love. It looks like it's someone's idea of what a wedding should look like.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The little rant made Pansy think. Ginny wasn't wrong. The pictures in these catalogs were idealized, perfected versions of the moments they were meant to represent. Nothing was out of place. Nothing felt real. For most clients that was a plus. It let them imagine the most romanticized version of what their wedding could be, which gave Pansy something to work with. The wedding business was really the business of bringing fantasy to life, for a limited time only. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>But Ginny was a realist. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It was obvious looking at her, more obvious when Pansy thought about what she knew about the other woman: Grew up poor, the last of a large litter, Voldemort in her diary first year, first battle in the war when she was a fourth year, bounced from boy to boy before Harry, lead that little revolution during that awful last year at Hogwarts, on track to be captain of the Harpies in the next five years. Everything she knew about Ginny Weasley pointed towards a woman who would have learned a healthy skepticism for storybook endings a long time ago. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She needed to come up with something real to give her. Something that Ginny would be able to sink her teeth into. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“ Those photos don't do anything justice, Ginny.” Pansy finally said, setting the magazines to the side. “ Not even the moving ones. You said you'd only been to weddings at your parent's home and you don't want that; I think the best way to figure out what you want is to get you to a few different weddings.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“ Neville and Luna are getting married in a few weeks,” Ginny mused. “ Seems like everyone decided to start getting married at the same time.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“ I'm not doing that one,” Pansy said, relieved once again to have dodged that bullet when the couple decided at the last minute to make all the arrangements themselves. They were nice enough. Pansy actually liked Neville a great deal, but between his floral desires and Luna's strange ritual requirements, she'd felt truly out of her depth. It certainly promised not to be like any weddings that Ginny had attended at her parents home. “But I am invited. Neville and I are distantly related and his grandmother insisted on sending me an invite. We can meet up during and chat about what you are liking in the moment. That will give me something to work from.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“ All right then!” Ginny chirped, jumping up from her seat and handing Pansy a card with her floo information. It was password protected, of course, the savior of the wizarding world couldn't very well leave his fire open for whatever fringe blood supremacists might want to make an example of him. “ I'll just show myself out and let you have the rest of the appointment time to work on those notes you've got going without me looking over your shoulder. No point in me sitting here with nothing to talk about.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“ If you're sure? You've got another fifteen minutes?” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“ I'm sure. I scheduled a lunch with Hermione right after and if I'm a minute late she'll be in a mood. Better to just be early.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Merlin, didn't that sound just like Granger. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Pansy didn't even want to think about that witch's wedding. It had been one of the first she had done for anyone outside of her innermost circle of Slytherin friends, because Theo just had to marry in a Gryffindor bookworm who'd never so much as glanced at a bridal magazine. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It had been gorgeous in the end; the Nott library was cleared out of all the nasty anti-muggleborn hexes and everything done up in roses and velvet. Theo was decked out in vintage muggle finery, top hat and tails, the whole nine yards; Granger had worn her mother's dress. It was sentimental and vaguely exotic to Pansy at the time, with all the little touches from Hermione's muggle upbringing, but getting there had been taxing. Granger was awfully particular for someone who'd never bothered to make any plans herself.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Pansy thought that Ginny might be the opposite. This was shaping up to be the shortest first meeting that she had ever had.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“ I'll see you at the Longbottom wedding then.” Pansy reminded her, writing down the date herself and giving it the soft swirl and tap that would transfer it into her datebook. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“ I'll be the one with the hair.” Ginny replied, tossing Pansy a wide grin over her shoulder as she walked through the door.</span>
