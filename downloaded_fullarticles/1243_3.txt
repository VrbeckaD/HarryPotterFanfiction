    <p>Dominic Scarlatti’s hand trembled as he lifted his television remote to change the channel.  Once, he’d ignored the television, preferring to work hard and make sure his family was well-provided for.  One of many things the cancer had forced him to change his mind about, the television offered, even temporarily, an escape from the prison his body had become.  It had also proved to be a useful weapon in his ongoing conflict with his son.</p>
<p>In truth, he was as proud of his son as he had ever been; the son he’d seen grow from a young boy to a proud, confident man.  But his son was meant for so much <em>more</em> than to risk his life for strangers who would never know the difference!  He hadn’t slaved all those years so his son could go off and get himself blown up by some common criminal.  Or arrested for a crime he hadn’t committed.</p>
<p>The old man nearly swore as the memory of that night surfaced; it had <em>rapidly</em> outdistanced his previous most hated memory – the night his son had come home devastated over his friend’s near death.  His wife’s wails as the cold, uncaring men with magic sticks dragged his son and his son’s best friend away.  The brave face his son put forth, hiding his fear.  He’d cradled Michelina, holding her close as she wept for their son, but he couldn’t manage so much as a tear.</p>
<p>
  <strong>“Papá?”</strong>
</p>
<p>One finger shifted, pressing down on the remote, increasing the television’s volume.</p>
<p>His son sighed, but sat down next to him regardless.  <strong>“Evening, Papá.”</strong></p>
<p>Determinedly, Dominic fixed his eyes on the television, despite the bland and uninteresting commercials scrolling across the glass.</p>
<p><strong>“Today was a slow day,”</strong> Michelangelo announced, seemingly oblivious to Dominic’s refusal to even grant his son a flicker of attention.  <strong>“Lou and I snuck another movie poster into Wordy’s locker.”</strong>  A wry grin.  <strong>“Had to tack on Roy and Giles to get us to Nine Walkers, but at least we got a laugh.”</strong>  A mock-grimace.  <strong>“Then Wordy showed it to Ed and pointed out which role we’d given him.  We ended up doing sprints in full gear.”</strong></p>
<p>Dominic schooled his tongue sternly, refusing to ask his son any questions, though they burned in his mind.  Walkers?  Roles?  The nine part, at least, was easier to grasp…he <em>did</em> know his son was one of seven teammates.  Still, he had to admit his son’s latest strategy was proving to be more effective than he’d thought at first…</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p><em>The old man waited until the door had closed behind his son to sneer.  Stories?  Michelangelo believed </em>stories<em> were enough to overcome his objections?  True, there was a part of him that was curious…somewhat curious…mildly curious…infinitesimally curious…about his son’s job and teammates, but stories?  What did the boy think a few stories would accomplish?</em></p>
<p><em>And such outlandish ones at that!  Did Michelangelo </em>really<em> expect him to believe that his team had bested a group of experienced stick-wavers in a </em>game<em>?  Did his son truly expect him to believe that two </em>children<em> had transformed into </em>animals<em>, right near a ‘subject’, whatever that was, and gone </em>unnoticed<em>?  Pure poppycock!</em></p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>But the stories had continued.  Every night, his son came in with the news of the day, whether his job had been slow or so busy that Michelangelo had been left wondering which way was up.  And when he’d finished sharing his news, Michelangelo would launch into his storytelling, sharing tales of such outrageous feats and accomplishments that Dominic would have believed them to be pure fantasy except…  Except that Michelangelo’s voice never hinted at fakery or lies; Dominic knew his son well enough to know when he was lying.  Which left the elder Scarlatti with the inevitable conclusion that the stories <em>weren’t</em> fantasy.  Either they were real or his son was insane.  He <em>refused</em> to even entertain the latter notion, so he was left with the former.</p>
<p><strong>“…so this poor kid’s bright red as his dad yells at the clerk and Ed, and I swear the mother would’ve killed her husband if she could’ve…”</strong> Michelangelo chattered on.</p>
<p>Dominic kept his eyes forward as he sought to catch up with his son’s trail of words.  Oh, yes, some sort of party with lasers and contests and his son’s team completely showing up the other team.  He restrained his snort with an effort.  Who had been <em>fool</em> enough to participate in any sort of shooting contest against a group of cops?</p>
<p>When the flow of words stopped and Michelangelo departed, Dominic was left alone with his television and his thoughts, neither of which were anywhere near as good of company as they’d once been.  Almost against his will, the dying man let his eyes trail to the door and part of him wished that Michelangelo would come back so he could ask about the lasers and the movie poster and why his son’s team leader had objected to being portrayed as ‘Samwise Gamgee’, whoever that was.</p>
<p>In truth, he <em>missed</em> his son, missed him fiercely, but his pride refused to let him back down from the stance he’d taken.  He could not, <em>would</em> not, bend and admit that his son had been right to defy him.  No, the only solution was that Michelangelo would leave his job and find a new one, one that was <em>much</em> less dangerous than his current one.  So that Michelina would have someone to care for her once he was gone.  So that they would someday have grandchildren, fine, strong young ones to carry on the Scarlatti name and do their family proud.  Not a coffin and a folded flag, laid in his widow’s trembling arms.</p>
<p>And yet…his son had not backed down.  Almost as if his son regarded his job and teammates as more <em>important</em> than his family.  Than his parents.  It was shameful, but Dominic had no way to rein his son in.  No way save the method he’d been using for the past year, at least.  A punishment that wasn’t working and that his son was beginning to use against him.</p>
<p>Alone in his room, Dominic buried his head in his hands and silently begged for God to bring his son <em>back</em> to him.</p>

<p>Spike sighed, slumping down on his bed rather than doing anything with his computer or his games.  He was too sick at heart for that.  His father’s eyes had moved towards him tonight, just a bit, but he hadn’t asked any questions, despite Spike changing tactics and leaving little details out of his news and his story for the night.  He’d hoped that would finally prove to be the trick, the wedge to get his father to actually <em>talk</em> to him, even if it was just a question.  But his father had held firm, staring into his blaring TV and not giving Spike even so much as a twitch of encouragement.  The slight eye movement had probably been a fluke, to boot.</p>
<p>Resigned, Spike pulled his notebook up on the bed, writing a few lines in it to note down which stories he’d already told his father.  Then he stuck the end of his pen in his mouth as he debated…should he tell his father more about Wordy’s bracelet?  He’d already sketched out the basics and even told his father about the ongoing <em>Lord of the Rings</em> teasing.  He winced a little, remembering Ed’s revenge for the Samwise Gamgee comparison.  Though, come to think of it, Ed <em>might</em> have been angrier over the Roy as Boromir thing.  Spike hurriedly switched back to his plotting.  Should he share more?  Or should he move onto another pack of stories?  After thinking the issue over a bit more, Spike shrugged and wrote in a few new ideas for stories.  It was lighthearted enough – and stayed far, <em>far</em> away from the more intense tales he hadn’t been willing to share.  No need to make things <em>worse</em>, after all.</p>
<p>The bomb tech slid the notebook back in its hiding place.  He was running out of time…day by day, his father drew closer and closer to the end.  But giving in and walking away from his team wasn’t the answer.  After everything they’d gone through, it <em>couldn’t</em> be an answer.  Spike considered curling up and just going to sleep, but a clatter of wind against the outside of the house drew his head up.  Naturally, his eyes fell on the bookshelf sitting right next to the window.</p>
<p>After a moment of thought, Spike pushed himself off his bed and headed over to his bookshelf, pulling down <em>The Magician’s Nephew</em>.  If he couldn’t change his circumstances, then maybe he could escape them, at least for a little while.  Going back to his bed, Spike flopped down with his book and dove into its pages, trading modern day Toronto for turn-of-the century England.</p>
<p>But even as he read, in the back of his mind, Spike sent out a silent plea for Aslan to bring his father <em>back</em> to him.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Two souls, each desperate to reconcile, but kept apart by stubborn pride.  Two prayers, near identical, each with a secret addendum that nothing be required of <em>them</em> in the <em>answer</em> to their prayer.  Each expected the other to give way completely, but it wouldn’t, <em>couldn’t</em>, happen that way.  He would not interfere with their free will.  The Lion’s gaze was steady, His pawprints light as He moved through Time and Space.  They had called upon Him and He would answer, even if that answer came in…quite unexpected ways.</p>
<p>The Lion’s tail lashed, just once, as He padded through His enemy’s realm.  It was time they had a talk…</p>
