<p>Classic Union</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“Everything’s ready out there. It looks lovely. The candles are lit and the chapel’s all decorated… Severus! Stop fussing with your robes.” </p>
<p>“This cravat’s choking me.” </p>
<p>“It’s classic to wear one with formal wedding attire. Lucius wore a cravat for our wedding and it was—”</p>
<p>“You’ll forgive me if I don’t wish to discuss your husband just now, Narcissa.” </p>
<p>“No, I suppose you don’t. You’re rather discuss <i>your</i> soon-to-be-husband, wouldn’t you?” </p>
<p>“Is he here yet?” </p>
<p>“Harry?”</p>
<p>“No, Ronald Weasley. Of course Harry!” </p>
<p>“You <i>are</i> snippy. Relax, Severus. Harry clearly adores you. Now let’s go get you married.” </p>
<p>“Finally we agree.” </p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“Harry, leave it!” </p>
<p>“I can’t! Whatever you put in my hair’s making my scalp itch.” </p>
<p>“Fine. <i>Finite.</i> Better?”</p>
<p>“Yes! And sorry, but I’m not sure Severus would recognise me without messy hair.” </p>
<p>“It <i>is</i> your classic look, I suppose.” </p>
<p>“How many people are out there?” </p>
<p>“The chapel’s packed. Wait…did you invite Skeeter?” </p>
<p>“No! We need to get rid of her.”</p>
<p>“How? Oh, I have an idea. I’ll be right back.”</p>
<p>“What’d you do?” </p>
<p>“Tripped one of the boys lighting the candles. She ran off swearing about hot wax.” </p>
<p>“Hermione, you are brilliant.” </p>
<p>“You’re welcome. Now let’s get you married.” </p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“Can you believe we’re actually married!”</p>
<p>“We’d better be, this cravat’s choking me.” </p>
<p>“You look great in it, though. Sexy.” </p>
<p>“Indeed. <i>You</i> look edible.” </p>
<p>“Even with my messy hair?” </p>
<p>“Especially with your hair. You look the way you do after we’ve made love.” </p>
<p>“Damn, Severus. You can’t talk like that right now!”</p>
<p>“Why not? We’re dancing, no one can hear us.”  </p>
<p>“True, but it makes me want to shag you now.” </p>
<p>“Classically, sex is encouraged after weddings, but we could create a new tradition.” </p>
<p>“Severus!” </p>
<p>“Don’t tell me you’re shocked. You knew who you were marrying.” </p>
<p>“Yes, yes I did.” </p>
