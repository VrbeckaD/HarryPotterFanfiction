    <p>"Wanda!” Steve called.<br/>
His voice echoed around the kitchen, making Wanda glance up from her iphone. She dropped it on the kitchen counter and stood up, sighing in mock exasperation. She was quite content with her new life at Stark Tower. Minus Stark himself, Wanda had truly begun to feel like she belonged to a family. Ever since her brother had died, there was a hole in her heart that could never be healed, but the Avengers were doing an amazing job trying.<br/>
"Yes Steve?" She answered cheerfully.<br/>
"I- we- uh.." he suddenly choked. Anxiety laced his features, causing him to clasp his hands together nervously. Wanda tilted her head curiously and walked over to him. She felt the urge to read his thoughts, but he caught her,<br/>
"Please don't." He said sternly. Embarrassed, Wanda dipped her head.<br/>
"Sorry. What's wrong?" She asked. Steve sighed, glancing up as if in thought.<br/>
"I think it's better if Bruce and Tony explain it to you."<br/>
"Oh no.." Wanda chuckled, Steve smiled in response, relaxing slightly. They walked to the lab side by side.<br/>
"How are you handling your new phone?" He asked her along the way. She stepped over some broken glass, probably left there by one of Tony’s assistant robots. They were adorable, but ironically not very helpful.<br/>
"Horribly." She laughed. Steve chuckled, patting her on the back.<br/>
“I feel you.”<br/>
Soon they arrived at the lab, and Bruce ushered them in. He motioned for her to sit down,<br/>
"There is something we need to explain to you,” he paused, collecting his thoughts and clicking his pen a few times. “Tony and I have invented an actual time machine. I didn’t think it would be possible, but Tony convinced me to try. We have tested it so many times that I've lost count-"<br/>
"When HE loses count you know it's a lot." Tony interrupted, yelling from across the lab. Bruce sighed and continued, straightening his glasses.<br/>
"We need to send you back to the 1920s." Wanda froze, fear lacing over her mind.<br/>
"Wait, what? Why??” She barely processed what Bruce had told her.<br/>
“Steady.” Steve said, a worried look on his face. Bruce brought her closer to what apparently was a time machine. It was a large circle, maybe 20 feet in height, with a platform in the center of it. It omitted a faint glow, and terrified Wanda to the core.<br/>
"As we all know, there is a magical community of witches and wizards all over the world that had a war and split...” Bruce stated this as a fact, as if it was a common knowledge.<br/>
“Wait what-“ Wanda failed to interrupt him.<br/>
“...Well, we figured out why they disbanded. Something happened in the 20s with an Obscurus. Someone got killed, and the wizard world was never the same. Normally we wouldn't care, but their problems are starting to affect to us. They are not protecting the nonmagical people from magical threats anymore, so now we have too many jobs to do and not enough capable people.” He gave her a serious look, “We need you to go back and find this Obscurius. Find it, and protect it. Keep it from dying, and the world will be safer from magical threats. Please Wanda, we will give you a communicator, to fill us in on data.” Bruce practically begged. Wanda had almost learned how to fully control every aspect of her powers, so it was true that she was very powerful, but this idea scared her. What if she never came back? What if she ended up dying in the past? She must have visibly looked stressed, because Steve put his arm around her and hugged her to his side.<br/>
"I- ... are you serious?" She asked shakily. Bruce nodded his head.<br/>
“Unfortunately.”<br/>
“Why me? Why not you, Steve? Surely you would be better adapting to the 20s” She continued. Almost instantly she winced at her insensitivity, but it was too late to take it back. Steve gave her a hesitant look, distant memories flashing across his eyes.<br/>
“You’re the only one here with the capability to read minds and memories. With you out looking, the Obscurus will probably be found in a heart beat.” He stated, then gave her a pitiful glance, “Plus.. it would be too painful for me.” Wanda looked up at him, determination hardening in her eyes. She remembered Clint's words when Sokovia was being attacked. This was her job. She nodded slowly, her voice shaking as she said,<br/>
"I'll do it."</p>
