    <p>For the vast majority of his life, Draco could consider himself spoiled.</p>
<p>His bedroom was enormous and filled with everything he could need or want, his stables contained the fairest stallions for him to ride. He even had his own private bath house attached to his bedroom with lovely personal showers and soaking tubs filled with hot bubbly water. The Malfoy Manor was considered the peak of luxury. He’d spent his entire life there, never needing to beg or to steal to get what he desired.</p>
<p>And here he was, tears welled up in his eyes like the pathetic adolescent prince he was, because his parents had arranged for him to attend a ball with the sole purpose of finding him some frivolous little girl who wanted to be a princess.</p>
<p>When he first found out about their plans to marry him off, Draco sprinted up to the highest tower, flung open his bedroom door and threw himself into his cushions. He buried his nose in his blankets and curled in on himself. Panic welled up in his chest. He didn’t want to do this. He couldn’t do this. What did they expect from him, to find a girl he liked in one night? To marry her? To have <em>children</em> with her? The thought made him want to throw up. Draco hed no interest in girls, despite how much they tried. Since he first turned thirteen, he’d been surrounded by other noble and royal families who wanted nothing more than to insert their eldest daughters into his home to gain information and riches. Draco had seen his fair share of beautiful girls.</p>
<p>Draco had cared for none of them. He hadn’t wasted away his teenage years looking for hookups like the few other nobles he knew. He was as virginal as Mary herself of his own choice. Girls never seemed to interest him enough. Some part of him had shoved these thoughts into the back of his head during his teenage years. Perhaps if he avoided any discussion of sexuality for the entirety of his parents lives, they would never need to know.</p>
<p>Surely, if his parents thought him miserable they would change their mind, right?</p>
<p>
  <em>Right?</em>
</p>
<p>The thought had him rushing downstairs again. If he had half a brain, he would have sneered at himself. Princes don’t <em>rush.</em> Draco was neat and clean and remained in order because that was his <em>job.</em> He was reduced to a mess because of all of this. His clothes were wrinkled, there were red tear tracks on his face, and he had a pit of nerves in the center of his stomach. He was acting like some disappointed peasant.</p>
<p><em>Surely</em> his parents would see this. They loved him, right? Surely they didn’t want him to be miserable. Draco couldn’t remember a time in his life where he had been miserable.</p>
<p>Scratch that.</p>
<p>When he was twelve, his prize white stallion Salazar had died in a hunting accident. Sport hunting was a popular pastime for nobles and their influencers -- they’d all pack up with their guns and all their charms and fake smiles and run off on beautiful untrained horses to shoot blindly at some innocent deer in the forest.</p>
<p>Draco hated it. He would bite back tears and grit his teeth to look prim and proper and stoic, but he despised it all. Draco knew that he’d made the right decision to hate it when one day their group came close to actually killing a ten point buck. The leader of their group whooped with joy and the squad grew too excited. They lost control and began to rain bullets. His father and his horse were caught in the crossfire. Lucius Malfoy escaped with a brand new limp, but Salazar wasn’t as lucky.</p>
<p>Draco could remember that intense, cold pain of loss, the uncomfortable numbness of cotton filling his ribcage. He felt it now -- the loss of control over his own life.</p>
<p>The thought of marrying some girl who he didn’t care for, having children with her, it all made him feel just as disgusting and weak. He stole himself as he rushed down the spiral staircase. Draco grit his teeth and straightened his posture. He let the stiffness of his clothes guide his spine into a perfectly straight line, his hips in line, let the pace of his gait slow to a leisurely walk. He lifted his chin and smoothed out the high neckline.</p>
<p>The stiff jacket and pants were designed to encourage good posture. The clothes themselves were works of art -- dark grey and smooth with intricate silver laces that wound around his arms, calves, neck and collarbones. They were form fitting and covered every inch of skin from his wrists to his ankles to the slope of his neck. As a child he’d hated them for restricting movement, but now he was thankful for them. Even when he felt like falling apart the clothing was there to hold him in position and keep him from embarrassing himself.</p>
<p>Perhaps he should have remembered to put on his crown before he rushed off to find his parents. The delicate ring of silver that rested on his neatly trimmed hair always seemed to remind his parents of their stature. Draco though it looked quite beautiful on him as well, all silver and thin like himself with a single glittering emerald the size of a silver coin. The green brought out the sharp color in his eyes. He usually never wore the crown around the Manor unless he needed a confidence boost, or felt like feeling particularly powerful. He could use a little more confidence right now.</p>
<p>He traipsed through the maze of a castle, gritting his teeth and chewing at his bottom lip to keep himself grounded. The green and black carpet underfoot was soft and muffled any noise his heeled boots would make against the floor. The hall that led towards the throne room was lined with enchanted torches that gave off silvery blue light that reflected around the walls and floor. It reminded Draco of being underwater. He hadn’t swam in ages (it was improper for someone of royal blood to show so much skin outside) and he missed the feeling of cold water on his skin and the smell of clean outdoor air. This was the closest he could get.</p>
<p>It was gloomy, but perhaps that was his family’s aesthetic. It certainly felt that way.</p>
<p>When Draco finally arrived outside of the throne room, he took a moment to steal himself. He shifted from one foot to the other, took a few deep breaths, closed his eyes, and willed every ounce of emotion he had to disappear.</p>
<p>He threw open the large oak doors, strutted inside, and stopped dead in his tracks.</p>
<p>“Draco,” his father acknowledged him without really looking at him. He nodded towards the exit and peered back to his guest. “Please leave, your mother and I are having a very important meeting with Mister Nicholas.”</p>
<p>Draco sucked in another breath and willed his voice to stay even. “I need to talk to you immediately. It’s urgent.”</p>
<p>He cheered internally when his voice came out clear and calm. He almost managed to sound <em>bored.</em></p>
<p>Lucius Malfoy’s eyes narrowed. He swept his hair over one shoulder and stared Draco down, as if finally noticing that he was there.”</p>
<p>“Draco --”</p>
<p>He shifted onto the balls of his feet and rocked forward. “I’d like you to cancel the ball.”</p>
<p>One could have heard Draco’s wand drop to the plush carpet in the silence that ensued after that.</p>
<p>His father looked shocked, judging from the deep furrow that ran across his forehead and the sneer twisting his mouth. “You’d <em>what?</em>”</p>
<p>Draco found himself faltering. His hands shook visibly, so much so that he struggled to stuff them into his pockets. “I’d like to focus on studying right now. I’ll be a wizard of age in a few months, and I’d like to master magic before I take on a family.”</p>
<p>“Are you not already a master?”</p>
<p>Draco’s breath hitched. He bit down on the inside of his cheek.</p>
<p>Lucius stood up and shoved his chair back. The black robes he wore shrouded his form in a deadly shadow. He strutted forward until he was mere inches away from his son. Draco did all he could to keep his back from snapping like a bowstring under the pressure.</p>
<p>“Draco, will you listen to me?” Lucius asked -- it was not a request, but a command.</p>
<p>“Father.” He nodded, bowing his head just enough to appear polite, but stiff.</p>
<p>“It’s your duty to carry on our family legacy.” his father sneered at him. “Don’t embarrass us any further. You will attend the ball, you will stay there all night if we wish you to. You will find a girl you like or we will pick one for you. That is final.”</p>
<p>Draco felt his skin grow hot. His face was burning up with embarrassment and frustration, his hands shook at his sides as he balled them into fists. “But… I don’t wish to --”</p>
<p>“<em>Draco,</em> if you tell your mother and I that you do not wish to marry a beautiful women of power right now, we will be forced to think you a <em>queer </em>and banish you from the estate. Is that what you want?”</p>
<p>He let out a defeated breath. “No, father.” He sounded pathetic, even to his own ears.</p>
<p>His father gave him one last cruel smile, before he patted him on the cheek and turned on his heels. His robes fanned out behind him like a dementor’s cloak. Draco shivered at the thought. With his last remaining shred of dignity, Draco walked outside into the hallway and began to sprint up towards his bedroom.</p>
<p>When Draco arrived, out of breath and panting with panic and exhaustion, he couldn’t hold back the tears rushing down his face. He fell to his knees on his carpet and braced his forehead against the ground. <em>In, out, in,</em> he told himself. His breath was shaky and shallow. His chest felt like it was caving in, like someone was sitting on it as he punched at them and struggled to breathe.</p>
<p>He sat there for an indeterminable amount of time as he tried to catch his breath and return to his own head. His thoughts swam in and out of his consciousness. When he was finally aware enough to recognize them, another wave of icy cold panic ran through him.</p>
<p>
  <em>You’ll have to do it. They’ll force you too. Either you’ll marry a woman or you’ll be thrown out forever.</em>
</p>
<p>Draco choked back a sob. He was too busy being furious to scold himself for being pathetic.</p>
<p>He pulled himself off of the floor and brushed the dust off of his knees with trembling hands. His bedroom seemed cooler than usual -- the castle was enchanted and filled with fireplaces, but none of that heat seemed to be able to find its way to him. Draco toed off his boots and fell on his four-poster bed in his clothes, buried his face in his covers and nuzzled into the pillows. After what felt like an eternity, he found himself completely empty and numb.</p>
<p>He sat in bed for so long that the silver lacing of his jacket began to dig into his bicep and Adam’s apple. Draco sat up and ran both hands through his hair. In an absent haze, he began to undo each and every lacing in his clothes. It was a painstaking task that he usually requested a servant to help him with -- all of the lacing and unlacing, really the lacing shouldn’t have been made so intricately, it was impractical -- but there were moments like this where he prefered to be alone. The eerily quiet presence of a maid or servant in his bedroom at this hour, with his mood the numb terrified slump that it was, would just be uncomfortable. He allowed himself to get out of his head in the time it took to undo his jacket and pants.</p>
<p>In that time, he decided one thing. No matter what his father said, no matter what his supposed duty was supposed to be, he would not allow himself to be miserable for his entire life. He’d rather pitch himself out his own bedroom window. No, there was one thing for sure.</p>
<p>He had to figure out a plan.</p>
<p>~~~~~~</p>
<p>The Big Event was scheduled for Seven o’clock on Sunday night. That gave Draco approximately a week to prepare for his imminent future, his life with a wife and a bundle of appropriate heirs, and perhaps a lovely seaside cottage with lots of windows.</p>
<p>Needless to say, Draco was sulking.</p>
<p>The week before the ball was torture. Not only was he being forced to go through all of this, but the stress of not knowing how to get out of it was tearing him apart. Usually he could hide away. This wasn’t even close to the first ball or party he’d be forced to attend, in fact it wasn’t even the first where he was the intended main event. It was, however, the first where people would actually be paying attention to him. Birthday dances and family gatherings usually had the front of celebration, but growing up in politics Draco knew that the adults in the business cared much more about learning the secrets of his family's wealth and success. Sure, there were a few with daughters who had watched him with a careful eye to see if he was ready to lead their legacy as his father had, but most were more concerned with having fake and polite conversations with his parents. </p>
<p>This time, all eyes would be on him. They would be watching his every move. He couldn’t sneak out through the gardens and wait out the ball in the rafters of his horse’s stall with a good book and a bottle of wine. Every guest would be there with the intention of forcing a woman on him. </p>
<p>Draco spent his free time hiding out in his room with a pile of books, practicing spells and plotting. His frustrated scowl had etched itself into his face and felt like it would never leave. </p>
<p>After a few days of this, being ignored by his father and some pleading from his mother, she finally managed to convince him to come down to get fitted. </p>
<p>There was no <em>real</em> need for him to be fitted with another outfit just for the ball. He typically wore what was considered dress clothes around the house. He had plenty of sets in his family’s colors, even a few with their crest -- two intertwined emerald snakes in the shape of an “S” -- stitched into the back and breast pocket. Draco knew this, but he allowed his mother to coax him downstairs anyway. The fact that he hadn't eaten a full meal in two days also helped to convince him. </p>
<p>So that's how he spent his day, half a week before a suitor would be chosen -- standing on a pedestal with swatches of dark clothing pinned to his underclothes as his mother and their tailor squabbled about texture and color. </p>
<p>His mother called the tailor in from the city. She was an older woman who had a lot of experience in their family. A few of Draco’s favorite suits had come from her store, so she should have his sizes on record, but it became apparent as she dressed him in an older model that he’d grown a few inches taller in the past year.</p>
<p>Madam Hawkins arrived in the morning, a wad of folded cloth and tools strapped to her broad shoulders. She ordered Draco up onto a wooden stand and manhandled his arms and legs around until she could get at all of his angles. Draco did as he was told. Nobles were expected to never become frustrated or irritable, and although he was incredibly indignant about standing still and having an old bat flit around him and touch him, he would never show it. He breathed easy and pretended like nothing in the world could bother him.</p>
<p>About an hour passed before she was able to peel what would become his pants from his frame and pack them away. She ushered his mother away to discuss pricing and other meaningless things, like the type of stitch she should use where his ass would be, or if she should use a shade of silver that was indistinguishable from the others. Draco let his shoulders and arms drop to his sides. His biceps ached. At this point, his arms would be too thick to fit into the jacket when the ball came.</p>
<p>He slumped where he stood and turned around on the shaky wooden stand, when he heard a set of accented and unfamiliar voices growing closer.</p>
<p>Draco peered over his shoulder, his posture relaxed to appear casual, and made sure that the room was empty except for him. As soon as he was sure that no one was watching, Draco hopped down from the wooden stand and hightailed it into the corner near the draped tapestry that lined the wall. He scooted behind the thick cloth and pressed his body flat against the brick. He was skinny enough -- he hoped -- that he would be invisible under the cover of the tapestry.</p>
<p>He sucked in a deep breath and held it as a few sets of footsteps and an echoing voice led in from the outer hallway.</p>
<p>“... is one of the family rooms. As you can see we have a tapestry with the Malfoy family tree.” The guests hummed in agreement.</p>
<p>The leader of this impromptu tour was Sergio, one of their servants. Malfoy smiled. He thought Sergio was (dare he say)cool. He was tall as a beanstalk and just as thin, with a sharp boyish face and a quirky smile. He was one of the only servants who’d worked for them who still had a bit of wit left in him. Draco suspected his mother was too fond of him to fire him, even after the few stunts he’s pulled.</p>
<p>Sergio continued on with the tour as usual and them out into the courtyard. Draco slinked out from behind the tapestry to eye at their two guests.</p>
<p>Draco didn’t recognize them. Their robes were different from what he’d seen before, more similar to the old fashioned wizard clothes in the children’s books he had tucked away in the library. Their skin was darker, too. Perhaps where they lived it was warmer. Maybe that explained the thinner cloth.</p>
<p>Unless…</p>
<p>Draco dug his nails into his palms. Oh no.</p>
<p>Oh <em>no.</em></p>
<p>They were foreign. They were probably diplomats, foreign diplomats that his father had called in for a reason. His father wouldn’t just do that to show off, or to strengthen trade bonds, no -- he was too smug for that. He would jump at the chance to to show others just how rich and powerful he was, but those people were no threat to them. They were too busy leading their own areas and reservations.</p>
<p>They weren’t just marrying him off. They were <em>sending</em> him off.</p>
<p>Typically the new bride of a young man would live with her husband’s family, or in a new house attached to their family’s estate until her husband was ready to take control of the business. But if they were bringing in the powerhouses, foreign nobles and kings with princesses and contracts and agreements and money hungry hands… Draco was doomed. </p>
<p>He was humble (well, as humble as a prince could be) but he knew his own power. A foreign diplomat in the hands of another’s family would be an addition to their power and their business.</p>
<p>They were going to try to use him as a chess piece in their wizarding business game.<br/>
He was just a valuable pawn that they were ready to ship off to strengthen some bond that would guarantee both sides handfuls of galleons. And for <em>what?</em> Pride?</p>
<p>Draco’s heart started beating so fast he could feel it snapping against his ribcage. He pressed his palm flat against his chest. He was sure that if he looked in the mirror, his face would be as pale as a sheet of parchment.</p>
<p>It was in that moment that his mother and Madam Hawkins decided to step back into the tapestry room. “Draco? What’s wrong?” His mother asked upon seeing his expression.</p>
<p>“Nothing, mother.” he choked out. His voice sounded clipped and worn to its very edges. “I swallowed a sip of water and it went down the wrong part of my throat.”</p>
<p>Narcissa lifted her chin and huffed. “Well then, get back on the stand! We’re not finished yet.”</p>
<p>Draco did as he was told. He willed his heart to slow, and dissolved into numb terror.</p>
<p>No matter what decision he would make, he’d be forced to leave.</p>
<p>~~~~~~</p>
<p>After the past two days, Draco was really fucking tired of being numb.</p>
<p>So, naturally, he decided to spend that afternoon in the barn, hacking apart a straw dummy with his sword. </p>
<p>He was familiar with the blade -- it was about a meter long, made of thin tempered steel, engraved with the family crest and a hilt of emerald. The weight was familiar and steady in his palm. The tension that grew in his shoulders and forearms as he wielded the blade started to relieve the tension that built up in his head.</p>
<p>Draco spent about an hour in the stables by himself, slicing and rolling around in the hay as he panted and raged on and on until he couldn’t take it any more. When his head finally grew clear enough for him to think without panicking, he fell back on his ass and kicked away from the shredded dummy in front of him. He dropped his sword at his side, where it clattered to the ground. The straw was crisp and clean, so he fell back and flopped against the ground, his limbs spread out like a starfish. Draco peered up through the cracks in the rafters at the stars in the sky. Since when was it so late? How long had he been there?</p>
<p>Draco didn’t have the answers.</p>
<p>He didn’t have any answers. His thought were too preoccupied with fear and stress and the possibilities -- he hadn’t eaten dinner or lunch yet, and he wasn’t aware of his body enough to feel the hunger. Taking care of himself had taken a back seat to figuring out what the hell was going to happen to him.</p>
<p>A few things were certain. One: his parents didn’t care much for his personal happiness. They thought they knew what was best for him, and they believed that the best place for him was to be at the hand of some powerhouse who wanted to use him to make money.</p>
<p>Two: foreign diplomats, nobles, and royalty all had their eye on him. He would never be able to escape that. As soon as they discovered that he was available for the taking, he would never be able to find peace. They would stop at nothing to have him. That only meant that the upcoming ball was just the beginning of it all.</p>
<p>And, finally, three: he was incredibly queer, and the thought of being trapped in a loveless marriage with a woman who couldn’t truly care for him sent waves of pain and horror through his veins, made his fingers tingle with nerves, and his stomach turn in disgust.</p>
<p>He was sure of it. He had to run away. He had to escape, he had to leave and never come back --</p>
<p>Draco found himself in the doorway of the stables with one bare foot out in the grass, the other ready to spring outside. His sword was tucked into his belt and his hands were clenched in angry fists. He was ready to leave -- his whole body was wound up like a coil ready to explode outwards, his mind a whirlwind of turmoil, his lungs suffocating under the weight of his duty -- but part of him was struggling against his mind. A part of him kept him tethered there. It tied him to the Malfoy manor. </p>
<p>Draco fell to his knees and peered up at the stars over the treeline. The forest that surrounded</p>
<p>It was all so <em>stupid.</em> Why hadn’t he realized this sooner? He needed to have skills -- real, actual skills, not what he’d learned after years of growing up in a wealthy family as a prince of a large province -- to survive as a peasant. Nothing of what he knew was useful. He couldn’t craft anything besides a halfway decent drawing, couldn’t do any hard labour without complaining or growing ill, he couldn’t even take care of his own appetite.</p>
<p>He pounded his fist into the ground. His parents had raised him for having this one purpose in life. He was so dumb for not noticing it sooner. Perhaps if he’d known a year in advance that he was destined for this he would have been able to plan for it, to figure out how to tell his parents without them hating him, to<em> escape,</em> somehow, but no. No, his pathetically queer self had always imagined that he’d find a handsome young diplomat who’d sweep him off his feet and lead him into a life by the ocean.</p>
<p>That was so <em>stupid</em> of him. Draco grit his teeth and stole himself.</p>
<p>This was his duty. He had a responsibility to do what was best for his family, regardless of what he wanted. He was a prince, and that meant a life of luxury, but it also meant a life of unending duty and  commitment to his family. If they needed him for this, it was his only choice. His childhood was over. In a few months, he would be a legal man. He would be married soon after. Those were the facts. He was no longer a snot nosed kid with fantasies of growing old with some cute boy to call his own and a bushy dog to protect him. From now on out, he had to act as if his province rested on his shoulders. He had to act like a proper king.</p>
<p>It stung him, oh <em>god</em> did it sting, but he could bear it. He always had.</p>
<p>Even after he made this self resolution, Draco couldn’t shake the sensation of dread that lurked just over his shoulder.</p>
<p>~~~~~~</p>
<p>No matter how hard he dug his heels in, the dance snuck up behind him and arrived precisely at Seven on Sunday night.</p>
<p>Draco put off getting ready until he only had fifteen minutes left and his mother was pounding on his door.</p>
<p>He lifted his head from his mattress and peered across his room at his full-body mirror in the corner. He looked atrocious. Perfect.</p>
<p>Draco rolled out of bed and strutted over to his door to throw it open for his mother. Narcissa looked at him with an interesting combination of surprise and terror.</p>
<p>“Are you… have you gotten ready at all?!” she exclaimed, her voice betraying the stress that she usually kept completely under wraps.</p>
<p>Draco shrugged. “I’m well rested, aren’t I?”</p>
<p>Narcissa shook her head and stared at the ceiling. “Draco, I know you’re angry at us enacting control over you, but this is all for the best! Why are you being so stubborn? Do you wish to pick a peasant as your wife like in the children’s books?!”</p>
<p>He sat back against his bed and raked his hands through his hair. The blond strands piled on top of his head, wavy and unruly instead of neat, straight, and pulled back against his scalp as expected of him. Draco hoped that his musings would ruin any chance of styling it last minute. Perhaps if he was ugly enough, no one would want to marry him. “No, mother. I just do not wish to have a wife.”</p>
<p>Narcissa narrowed her eyes. “You <em>know</em> that it’s dangerous to talk like that. Why must you taunt your father and I with suggestions of that sort?”</p>
<p>Draco closed his eyes and tried to bite back a remark. Fuck his parents and their close-minded, holier-than-thou manner. He hated it all. So much for unconditional love.</p>
<p>He didn’t respond. Instead, he took the suit she had wrapped away in a protective leather cover, and ushered her out the door so he could change.</p>
<p>He pulled the clothes over his form. As much as he hated it, Madam hawkins had a lovely style. When Draco peered up at himself in the mirror he was pleasantly surprised.</p>
<p>He actually thought he looked… nice. The pants were slim fitting and hugged his ankles like he liked, and the suit jacket was tailored so it cinched at his waist and fell past the curve of his hips. Growing up he used to hate the slight feminine swell of his hips, but standing in the mirror with his jacket buttoned to his throat and the silver threading of his suit, he thought the femininity… dare he say, <em>hot.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>He frowned. This wasn’t really what he was going for.</p>
<p>Perhaps if he looked queer enough, no woman would go near him. Women typically refrained from trying to marry homosexual men.</p>
<p>Draco sighed and shook his head. He didn’t have control over others, their thoughts of him, or, apparently, what they decided to do with him. He would have to stick to his original plan; find someone intelligent and easy to talk to, develop a friendship, and ask to add the mutually beneficial title of “married” to their relationship. For all he knew, there would be a queer girl in the same position as him. That seemed to be the best case scenario, at this point.</p>
<p>Draco sat down at his desk, took one look at his hair, and decided to throw his crown on directly on top of it. There was no need to fix it. It looked good how it was, even if it was rumpled and messy. That just added to the look he was going for.</p>
<p>In a final moment of spitefulness, Draco threw open one of his drawers and pulled out a small bottle of gold paste. It would contrasted nicely with his family’s green and silver </p>
<p>With the makeup on his face, his perfect suit, and rumpled hair piled with his silver crown, he not only looked stunning and unapproachable, but delightfully queer.</p>
<p>Take <em>that.</em></p>
<p>Draco threw his door open and walked past his mother without acknowledging her. She stalked after him and yammered about etiquette and their plan for the evening, but Draco didn’t hear a word she said.</p>
<p>The trek down to the ballroom was a short one -- through the main, sunny halls of the castle until he reached the smaller, shallower rooms filled with enchanted torches. Draco took this time in the empty enclosed space to suck in a few more nervous breaths. He couldn’t reveal a single ounce of anxiety if he wanted his ‘plan’ to work.</p>
<p>
  <em>You can do this. You’ll end up okay. Be a fucking adult about it.</em>
</p>
<p>Draco shook his head. He wasn’t going to talk to himself tonight. He had enough pride for that. He walked down the wide set of stairs with his chin held high and his back as straight as his parents wished he was.</p>
<p>If there was one thing he took away from the sight of the ballroom with all of its glory, it was that the grandeur was unnecessary. The ballroom was already full of dancing people and servants bustling around in prim silver and black uniforms.</p>
<p>The windows were covered in ten-foot high white lace and gold netting, the glass frosted magically. The fires that were placed strategically    gave off a cool glow and little heat. Draco was thankful for that -- the formalities were to be stuffling enough, no need to add extra heat to the situation. Draco resisted the urge to pull at his collar at the thought.</p>
<p>Torches lined the ceiling, as well as enchanted floating candles that gave off silvery light and seemed to glitter when you looked too closely. Really, his father had gone all out. It was no surprise to Draco. Master Malfoy took every chance to show off the family colors. Draco, of course, thought it was preposterous. Why would they want to blend into the decorum?</p>
<p>Draco caught sight of a flash of olive and silver and immediately turned the other direction. His father was there, chatting it up like he usually did at these events. Draco’s stomach turned at the thought of wearing a suit that completely matched his father’s. No one else would dare to wear formal robes or dresses in silver and green at a Malfoy party, so, of course, they would be the only people who seemed to coordinate.</p>
<p>Draco took his last deep breath to steal himself, before he straightened his shoulders and walked over to greet his father.He hadn’t talked to the man in three days, despite living in the same castle as him. His excuse was the same, after all these years: <em>it is quite a large castle, father.</em></p>
<p>He walked up behind his father -- careful not to tread on his sweeping green cape -- and planted a hand on his shoulder. Lucius Malfoy turned around in an instant.</p>
<p>“Draco!” He exclaimed, a false smile staining his face. The man he was talking to turned to him and bowed so low that the tip of his small nose might have smudged against his shined brown boots.</p>
<p>“The man of the hour,” his father continued. “I’m so glad I caught you this early in the night. Any later and you would have been caught up in dancing with some beautiful girl, hm?”</p>
<p>Draco looked his father between the eyes and gave his best fake smile. “Of course, sir. You know me. Always dancing, especially with girls.”</p>
<p>His father’s grin faltered for a second. He grabbed Draco’s elbow -- the elbow dressed in fine cloth that should <em>not</em> be wrinkled, thank you very much -- and tugged him harshly backwards. “Excuse me Ludo, I have to have a word with my son.”</p>
<p>This was not a question, but an order formed in steel and laced with poison.</p>
<p>Draco said a number of unspeakable things inside his head as his father dragged him away.</p>
<p>As soon as they were far enough away from the watchful eye of Lord Bagman, Lucius towered over his son and placed both hands on Draco’s shoulder, as if pretending to smooth out any wrinkles he might have left there. His father planted his hand on his back and pulled him forward by his shoulder blade, his fingers digging into his skin even through his black gloves and the layers of Draco’s new jacket and undershirt.</p>
<p>“If you try anything tonight,” he muttered through gritted teeth, “You will never see the light of day. You will be gone from this castle and locked away and I will never see you again. This is your duty, son. Do not ruin this for our family”</p>
<p>Draco nodded. He swallowed, hard, and met his father’s eyes. “I would never,” he promised.</p>
<p>“Good. Just between us, we’ve just received a wonderful offer from a Bulgarian King about his daughter.”</p>
<p>He hated how his father said “we,” as if he should be involved with the arrangements of Draco’s marriage.</p>
<p>His father let him go with a fake smile and ushered him to walk down the stairs towards the main dance floor.</p>
<p>Draco closed his eyes just for a moment as he strutted down the stairs. <em>Don’t freak out, don’t freak out, don’t freak out…</em></p>
<p>~~~~~~</p>
<p>His (admittedly small) group of friends was there. Draco immediately stalked through the crowd to meet them. Gregory, the bumbling idiot himself, clapped him on the back. “Lookin’ good, mate!” he said. Pansy chattered in agreement. </p>
<p>Draco smiled up at his friend fondly. He wasn’t particularly smart, but he was good company, and would stick up for his friends no matter what. Draco appreciated his bluntness. Nobles who would tell you what they actually thought were hard to come by.</p>
<p>He stood with them until the stares of everyone in the ballroom became too hard to handle. Draco busied himself by the refreshments -- servants were at his elbow to hand him champagne every moment, but he tried not to drink what others offered him. He was a prince, after all. He poured himself a hearty helping of rosea, downed the whole of it with a flourish, and let himself be led into the circle of dancers.</p>
<p>The music would have been nice, if it wasn’t for the constant chatter in his left ear. It was hard to find a time where there wasn’t a girl on his arm, batting up at him with silly enhanced eyelashes and pink cheeks. After half an hour of dancing nonstop, being traded off like a particularly interesting ornament, and talking with a generous handful of girls, Draco’s head was swimming. He stepped away from the circle even as someone reached for his elbow, blinking furiously and digging his fingernails into his palms. Even after concentrating he couldn’t remember the name of a single girl he’d just danced with. And if he was correctly estimating the amount of people there, he wasn’t even halfway through. </p>
<p>The girls here were doing their best to sweep him off his feet. Quite frankly, it was exhausting.</p>
<p>He was standing by a round refreshments table, nibbling on a bit of bruschetta with a glass of wine held delicately in one hand, when he felt yet another hand tapping him on the shoulder. Draco groaned internally, took another swig, and turned on his heels.</p>
<p>“Look, I’d love to, but I’m dead on my feet from all of the dancing. Perhaps we could just…” Draco looked down into her eyes, and paused. “Talk?”</p>
<p>She was tall and slim, with very dark skin and a curly mane of hair that fanned out over her shoulders. Draco raised an eyebrow at her words. He knew exactly who she was -- with her complexion, hair, and the slight lilt of her accent, the girl must be the daughter of one of the diplomats.</p>
<p>That, and the taller, broader boy who stood behind her, who seemed to peering at Draco with a watchful eye from behind his glasses. Draco raked his eyes over the boys form. His robes were not unlike the ones he saw on the diplomats who had originally toured the castle with Sergio, but they fell against his frame in a way that was much more appealing. A pair of round glasses rested on the bridge of his nose. He also had softer, darker hair, a shorter nose, and a nice shade of olive skin that altogether was <em>incredibly</em> attractive. Fuck.</p>
<p>Draco tore his eyes away from the man and bowed, one hand outstretched to take her hand (and do what? Kiss it like a ninny?). Instead of placing her wrist in his grasp she gripped his hand back and gave him a firm shake.</p>
<p>“Hermione Granger,” she said, her shoulders square. Draco decided immediately that she was cool.</p>
<p>His lip quirked in a small grin. He returned her handshake. “Draco Malfoy. And you?” he nodded towards the man.</p>
<p>He narrowed his eyes. “I’m her adopted brother, her chaperone for the night.” He crossed his arms over his chest -- it was a <em>very nice</em> chest, mind you, especially with fine robes stretched across it -- and met Draco’s eyes with a steely green gaze. “I’m here to make sure you and your family don’t get into any...trouble.”</p>
<p>He said the word “trouble” as one might say “vicious felonies and crimes against humankind.”</p>
<p>“I can assure you, that won’t be a problem.” Draco reached out to shake his hand as well, but the man just looked away and sighed.</p>
<p>
  <em>Who pissed in his champagne?</em>
</p>
<p>Draco turned back to Hermione, who had her arms crossed in front of her as well and was regarding her adopted brother with a mixture of frustration and fondness. “Don’t mind Harry,” she told him, rolling her eyes. “He’s unnecessarily protective.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>Hermione gave him a wry grin and spoke shortly and sweetly. “Our guardians intend for us to marry.”</p>
<p>Draco stuffed his hands in his pockets and shrugged. <em>Fuck it.</em>“I assure you it will be quite difficult.”</p>
<p>Hermione snorted. (<em>Snorted. </em>What kind of royal witch snorted when she laughed? Then again, what kind of prince wizard was queer?) “They believe that with you, they will be able to gain money for both families. But…” she gestured wildly at the decorum of the ball around them. “I’m not sure they need it.”</p>
<p>With a shrug, Draco relaxed back against the refreshments table and nursed at his glass of rosea. “The grandeur of it all seemed unnecessarily, but I guess with selling off me, they’ll have enough money to reimburse themselves tenfold.”</p>
<p>The girl huffed and stuck her nose out, a scowl setting itself in the curve of her brow. “I don’t like the destiny my ‘parents’ set up for me either.”</p>
<p>“What makes you say <em>I</em> don’t like it?”</p>
<p>“Oh <em>please,</em>” Harry spoke up. He looked Draco up and down. “You reek of frustration. You hate it here, you hate all of the girls, and you hate your father. Anyone with half a brain can see from miles away. Hermione here has a bit more brain than the average witch or wizard.”</p>
<p>Most people would have been offended. Draco was forced to stifle a laugh. “Well, let’s be glad that most people here haven’t half a brain!”</p>
<p>That seemed to surprise Harry, but the man did his best not to show it. He rubbed at the back of his head with his palm and straightened his glasses on his face -- they had gone a bit askew during his outburst. From what little he’d said already, Draco though he seemed a bit like an annoying git. Still, Draco could appreciate anyone who was willing to talk to him without dancing, and without the intention of marrying him off.</p>
<p>He tipped his head back and swallowed the last of his drink. The fluid in his veins was growing hot, and he found more energy in the pit of his stomach. Draco didn’t usually drink. He hated the fuzzy feeling it gave his head, and the way it made his heart pound. Tonight was an exception. It was an exception to a lot of things.</p>
<p>In his fuzziness, Draco failed to notice a dancing couple as they drew closer. He sat down at the table just as they broke away from the circle of the others and waltzed closer, inch by inch. His head was tipped back to stare up at the ceiling.</p>
<p>The silver candles gave off this lovely, sparkly iridescence that made the ceiling look like the bottom of a swimming pool filled with grey glitter. Draco was mesmerized -- the sight looked especially beautiful to his swimming vision.</p>
<p>Draco experienced only muted alarm when he discovered that he could not move a muscle.</p>
<p>Someone was saying his name. Perhaps it was Hermione. Or was it Harry? He couldn’t tell. Everything sounded the same: too loud.</p>
<p>The dancing couple drew closer still. The man pulled a hood over his head and shoved away his dancing partner. A single moment passed before she let out a bloodcurdling scream, and a glint of tempered silver shined in their eyes.</p>
<p>Draco could not move from his seat. He struggled to keep his eyes open as the man made a dash for him, lifted his weapon high, he was going to die he was going to <em>die</em> --</p>
<p>A dark mass swooped in front of him like a shadow. Another yell pierced the air. Draco sucked in one breath after another, his swirling brain attempting to comprehend what was going on in front of him. Finally, after a what felt like ages of struggling, he managed to process the sight of a hooded figure lying on the ground in a pool of his own blood, and the stranger -- Harry -- standing in front of him.</p>
<p>The knife jutted out from his thigh. Harry stared down at it in shock as dark blood began to spread and make a wet black stain on his trousers.</p>
<p>Draco saw a swirling pattern of blood red. He watched with muted horror as Harry looked up from his wound and into his eyes. Harry’s face swam in his blurry vision. Draco blinked, hard, as he struggled to make a single sound.</p>
<p>In some miracle, Draco regained just enough range of motion to twist in his chair and throw up violently into a bowl of olives, before passing out on the floor.</p>
