    <p>“My magic’s not working today,” Sirius heard as soon as she walked into the dorm. He could see a curled up lump on Remus’ bed, the voice muffled from coming through the curve of the other boy’s body.</p>
<p>“Everyone has off days, Moony,” Sirius replied, thinking quickly.</p>
<p>“Okay, but we have that transfiguration test tomorrow and if I can’t cast this spell by then, I’m fucked.” Remus said, somehow managing to curl into an even tighter ball.</p>
<p>Remus had schizoaffective disorder, a mental disorder on the schizophrenia spectrum.</p>
<p>For him this resulted mostly in delusions, with the occasional auditory or visual hallucination. His delusions were believing in things like that they were all enrolled in a magic school, that Remus was a werewolf, that everyone wanted to hurt him, that he couldn’t sleep or he’d be abducted by aliens, that music held secret coded messages, or a variety of other colourful ones.</p>
<p>Remus had beaten the statistics, and developed schizoaffective disorder at age 13 (several years earlier than usual) and had managed to keep it a secret from his friends for over a year, though Sirius and James had been concerned that Remus had been doing drugs.</p>
<p>Eventually though, with help from Lily Evans of all people, Remus told them about it, and Sirius had immediately thrown himself into helping Remus. With many questions about how he could help, and hours of Googling, as well as a few years of experience under his belt, Sirius was a certified Remus wrangler and had a menagerie of tips and tricks to help his boyfriend.</p>
<p>Sirius walked over and sat down on Remus’ bed and rubbed his hand up and down Remus’ back, the other boy reluctantly leaning into the touch.</p>
<p>“Rem, look at me please?” Sirius said, and Remus uncurled a little, allowing Sirius to see his tear-streaked face. Sirius’ heart broke a little seeing his boyfriend so upset.</p>
<p>“There are those beautiful eyes of yours,” he said, lifting his hand to Remus’ cheek. “I’m sure if you explain to McGonagall she’ll understand, And if she’s a dick about it, I’ll kick her ass!"</p>
<p>As Remus’ head of house and the person in charge of his well-being while he was at Hogwarts boarding school, McGonagall was well informed of Remus’ schizoaffective and could be counted on to be understanding about it. If Remus went up to her saying his magic wasn’t working, could he please take the test another day, she’d definitely play along, knowing to argue with the delusion would just upset Remus.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to cause a fuss,” Remus said.</p>
<p>“You won’t, love. McGoo loves you anyway, you’re the teacher’s pet. Least she can do is give you an extension.” Sirius said.</p>
<p>Remus sniffled, so Sirius reached over to the table between their beds and grabbed a few tissues out of the box and offered them to Remus, who took them gratefully.</p>
<p>“Come on, love, worst she can say is no.” Sirius said.</p>
<p>Remus closed his eyes for a few moments, and seemed to think it over.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” He said. “Yeah, okay. Let me clean myself up a bit first though.”</p>
<p>“Take as long as you need.” Sirius said.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A few minutes later, Remus emerged from the bathroom. The tear tracks were gone, as was the snot, and while Remus’ face was looking a little better, his eyes were still puffed up and his face was a few shades redder than normal. Sirius could see some water shining from where Remus hadn’t dried his face properly, but Sirius thought his boyfriend looked as handsome as ever.</p>
<p>“Shall we be off then?” Sirius said, leaping to his feet.</p>
<p>“We shall,” Remus said, managing a small smile at his boyfriend’s antics.</p>
<p>As they walked down the stairs side-by-side, Sirius held Remus’ hand, which both of them knew was just as much for Remus’ balance as it was for romantic reasons. There had been multiple instances of Remus falling down the steep staircase, luckily only getting away with minor injuries each time.</p>
<p>“Do you want me to come into McGonagall’s office with you?” Sirius asked when they were nearby.</p>
<p>“Thank you love, but it’s okay.” Remus said, who had seemed to gather himself a bit on the walk so far.</p>
<p>“Sure thing. Just yell if you need me to come to your rescue.” Sirius said.</p>
<p>“Oh please Sirius, protect me from our terrifying 62 year old teacher,” Remus said, rolling his eyes slightly.</p>
<p>“I’ve said if before and I’ll say it again, old McGonagall’s got hidden strength underneath all those wrinkled. That time I was standing on the table in the Great Hall and she grabbed my arm and pulled me down, and I swear it left a bruise!” Sirius said, waving his free arm for emphasis.</p>
<p>“No, that’s just because you bruise easily,” Remus said, winking and smirking, causing Sirius to turn bright red.</p>
<p>Sirius thought that it must be a good sign if Remus was able to made sexual innuendos, even if they were at Sirius’ expense.</p>
<p>They reached McGonagall’s office and Sirius watched as Remus took a deep breath and knocked on the door.</p>
<p>“Yes?” McGonagall’s voice sad, before she appeared at the door before Remus could answer, opening it.</p>
<p>“Ah, Mr. Lupin, Mr. Black, I do hope you aren’t bringing any trouble to my door.” She said.<br/> McGonagall’s keen eyes looked them both over as she spoke, taking in Remus’ swollen eyes and the tense set of Sirius’ shoulders.</p>
<p>“I do solemnly swear we aren’t bringing any trouble with us,” Sirius said, after a few moments of silence from Remus. “Can’t guarantee it won’t just appear though.</p>
<p>McGonagall narrowed her eyes at Sirius but he could swear he saw one corner of her mouth uptick the slightest bit.</p>
<p>“I… uh, wanted to talk to you?” Remus said, his voice trailing off a bit at the end of his sentence.</p>
<p>“Of course, please come in Mr. Lupin, Mr. Black.” McGonagall opened the door wider and stepped to the side so they could get past her.</p>
<p>“I’ll be waiting out here, I think. And I will definitely not be setting any booby traps for when you’re done.” Sirius said.</p>
<p>He was aiming to get a laugh or even just a smile out of Remus and was rewarded with a smothered grin.</p>
<p>McGonagall looked at him as though she could see right through him. And she probably could, at that.</p>
<p>Remus entered her office, and the door shut behind him. Sirius waited a few second to make sure neither of them would come back out, and took his phone out, opening a group chat between him, James, and Peter.</p>
<p>‘Magic day today’ he messaged, using terms they'd come up with years ago when they'd found out about Remus' delusions.</p>
<p>In a matter of moments there were two thumbs up on his message, indicating they’d both seen it.</p>
<p>Sirius fiddled idly with his phone, waiting for Remus to come back out. Then he started thinking about what booby traps he could actually put down, but quickly concluded he didn’t have anything on him to pull it off. It was times like this where Sirius wished he was at a magic school, so he could whip up a quick prank.</p>
<p>After what seemed like an hour to Sirius’ bored mind, but was in reality only a few minutes, the door opened, and Remus stepped out.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Professor,” He said, turning back to face McGonagall.</p>
<p>“No worries at all, Mr. Lupin. Now, I’m afraid I have your essays from yesterday to mark, so I must get back to that. Pleasure to see you both.” She said, closing the door.</p>
<p>“All good?” Sirius said, taking Remus’ hand and swinging it as they walked.</p>
<p>“Yeah, she gave me an extension until my magic works again.” Remus said.</p>
<p>“Ah, so I was right!” Sirius said. “Dare I say, that I told you so?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, yeah, laugh it up. This just means you have the test tomorrow and I don’t.” Remus said.</p>
<p>“I’m not worried, I have my natural intelligence and a swotty boyfriend to cheat off. I’ll pass it with flying colours.” Sirius said.</p>
<p>“There will be no cheating in this family, thank you very much!” Remus said.</p>
<p>“Come on Moony, as if you don’t cheat off me in chemistry. Get off your high horse, Mr. Tall Pants.” Sirius said, craning his head to look at his really fucking tall boyfriend. What the fuck.</p>
<p>“You mean potions?” Remus said.</p>
<p>“Yeah, whoops, sorry!”</p>
<p>“It’s not cheating, it’s using my resources and always pairing with you when we’re brewing.” Remus said.</p>
<p>“Cheeeating!” Sirius sang.</p>
<p>Remus rolled his eyes but didn’t argue any further.</p>
<p>“You up for Netflix and chilling but like actual chilling?” Sirius asked.</p>
<p>“Ooh yeah, we’re behind on The Good Place.” Remus said.</p>
<p>“Shall we swing by the kitchen and make some popcorn, then?”</p>
<p>Laden with popcorn and chocolate, Sirius and Remus settled on Sirius’ bed, wrapping themselves in his fluffy blankets.</p>
<p>As the opening credits for The Good Place rolled, Remus looked down at Sirius who was pressed into his side and kissed him gently.</p>
<p>“Thanks, Sirius.”</p>
