          <div class="userstuff"><p>“Circe, Draco,” Pansy muttered, snapping her fingers to get her best-friends attention. “Could you possibly be any more obvious? You’ve been staring at Potter’s back for the last five minutes. I mean, I’m not judging. He’s got the rough hewn hero look <em>cut-and-dried</em>. I can see the appeal-”</p>
<p>“You wanted something, Pans?” Draco asked in a withering voice. Luckily, the magic hadn’t yet been discovered that enabled looks to kill. Otherwise Pansy would have been joining The Bloody Baron in haunting the Slytherin Dormitories.</p>
<p>“To borrow one of your posh quills. I know you always carry a spare.” Pansy busied herself <em>Scourgifying</em> spilt ink from her fingers before she continued. “Your crush is distressingly apparent, love. You look like somebody slipped a bloody Love Potion in your Pumpkin Juice.”</p>
<p>Draco pushed his Transfiguration textbook across the desk in annoyance. Pansy had a terrible habit of cutting through his bravado and bullshit, before informing him of the exact thing he needed to hear. Draco supposed that <em>was</em> what made Pans his best-friend but it didn’t help him feel less exasperated.  He cast a silencing charm around the pair of them before he spoke. </p>
<p>“There’s just something about him,” Draco replied, scraping at the wood of the desk with his fingernail. “Everything about him makes my fucking blood <em>boil</em>. That <em>smarmy</em> face. I can’t tell if I want to smash it or kiss it. Those repellent, distasteful clothes that he wears without a care in the bloody world. I’d like to tear them off his body. The way that everybody <em>fawns</em> over him-” </p>
<p>Pansy squeezed Draco fingers as his words ground to an abrupt halt. He frantically wiped the corners of hie eyes, horrified by the tears that threatened to fall. </p>
<p>Draco imagined what Pansy must be thinking. He was a pathetic lovesick fool, harbouring fantasies that couldn’t ever be realised. Harry was a shooting star; a hero. Draco was just the pathetic excuse that Lucius was mortified to have for a son. </p>
<p>“Oh Draco,” Pansy murmured, tucking a lock of Draco’s hair behind his ear. “You do have it bad for Potter. But it’s just a crush. It’s not like you’re destined to marry or anything.”</p></div>
