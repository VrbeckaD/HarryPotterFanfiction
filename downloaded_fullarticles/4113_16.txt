    <p>She was in agony. Her pale arms patterned ebony and sapphire in bruises. Her once pristine summer dress was now plastered to her front due to the thick blood that had been left pouring continuously from the deep gash that sliced across her body. The crimson trailed from just beneath her left breast to the top of her right thigh. Each step was agony as the men surrounding her continued to drag her forwards, towards what the girl did not know. Her supposed kidnappers held her arms at awkward angles in a vicelike grip, her earlier futile struggle leaving the flesh in their grasp rubbed red and sore. The pain in her head was unbelievable as the bump on the base of her skull throbbed, while her eyes felt heavy at the endeavour to stay conscious. She had enough sense to softly suck on her stinging bottom lip, the slash upon it was presumably gained when one of `the attackers had pointed a long and thin object at her which had suddenly emanated a blinding blue light, this had somehow managed to push her powerfully through the window of her home and into her family's living room mirror.</p>
<hr/><p>It was summer and Evelyn Winters had just finished her fifth year at Bloomsbury Forest Secondary School. She was walking home from her father's bookshop when she first heard them. As she turned down the narrow lane that connected Ivy Street with her own road, Evelyn noticed that the footsteps were keeping in sync with her own, their own pace quickening with hers. Her heart pounding, she turned to finally see what was behind her, the sight of the empty lane more startling than if there had indeed been someone there. Uncertain Evelyn strained her ears. Silence. This in itself was unnerving as a quick glance above her showed the trees swaying with their leaves rustling yet Evelyn could not hear a thing. Wariness gripped her and she pushed herself forwards towards her home, this time keeping her gaze locked on the bright wildflowers lining lane as her ears strained to hear anything. Finally approaching the end of the lane Evelyn allowed her thick blonde hair to curtain her face, uncovering her ears. Once again, she could hear the footsteps only this time they were shockingly closer. Fear exploded within her trailing icy claws through her veins and until it gripped her heart. Whoever was behind her was clever she could tell; their pace perfectly matched her own however their footfalls were not light enough to be missed by Evelyn. Finally, she broke out into a run. Her front gate was only a few of feet away. That was when the person â€“ no â€“ <em>people</em> behind her started to sprint and shout as they chased her to her garden. From behind her came flashes and bangs as what appeared to be red and green fireworks were launched at her by her pursuers, a green burst of sparks merely missing her by centimetres, on a normal occasion she would have been relieved by her temporary luck but her brain had gone into lockdown. As she reached out and grasped the handle of her front door the fear that had overtaken her every thought ebbed slightly however it was soon back with a vengeance as she glanced at reflection of the men in her window. Behind her were five tall Grim Reapers, cloaked in black as she turned one of them raising his arm and she found herself crashing through the window, smashing against a mirror before finally crumpling into unconsciousness against her living room floor.</p>
<hr/><p>She had awoke to a splitting headache only to find herself limp in the arms of one of cloaked men, who upon noticing she was awake promptly dropped her to the floor, cracking the back of her head against the baking concrete in the process. As multiple hands grabbed her to drag her up Evelyn experienced a sudden burst of adrenaline and attempted to wrestle and writhe her way out of their grip however this merely resulted in weakening her as even more of her flesh was rubbed raw and bruised.</p><p>After an hour of slipping in and out of consciousness while being dragged unceremoniously, her captors finally slowed their punishing pace and realised their hold on Evelyn causing her to fall back against something uneven and hard. Though her gave was still very hazy from the battle her body had seemingly endured Evelyn released that she was currently leaning against a black fence which boarded an overgrown park space while opposite stood a row of declining grey townhouses.</p><p>"If I was as much of a rich bastard as Orion Black I would be flaunting it like Abraxas and his bloody peacocks, instead of living in this shithole!" Evelyn was startled at the sudden rasp of the hooded figure to the left of her, none of the five had said a word around her since her capture. "I mean the Blacks have as much money as the Malfoys and yet they're living here surrounded by filthy muggles." <em>Muggles? </em>Even in her concussed state Evelyn knew that these people were talking gibberish. <em>What on earth were these people going on about?</em></p><p>"Shut it Goyle!" came a gravelly voice behind her, "The Blacks have more influence than either you or I, and for the record if I was living above the Leaky with a middle-aged whore I'd keep my mouth shut about others."</p><p>Gravelly chuckles emanated the standing group and the first speaker, <em>Goyle?</em>, clenched his fists around a thin object protruding from his cloak. "Keep it up Lestrange, and I'll make sure your Bella never wants to look at your pretty young face again." Evelyn shifted away from the man as his anger was clear in his voice, however this proved to be a mistake as Goyle's seething eyes flicked towards her. With remarkable speed he grasped her matted hair and yanked her painfully to her feet, tears bloomed in her eyes as he shook her roughly in front of the crowd. "Talking of whores, what does Black want this little bitch for anyway?" At thos Eve's heart constricted, from the way these people were talking it sounded as though these men were all part of some exclusive gang or cult which she was sure she did <em>not </em>want to be a part of.</p><p>"Dunno," responded a new voice, "I believe that she's supposed to be a gift to welcome in the newest Death Eater, he's sixteen so seems fair that his dear old dad wants to break himself in with a Muggle before starting on those blood traitors. That's why I thought we'd go for a girl, after all, Muggle or not a teenage boy's going to have more than one urge." He broke off with a sadistic smirk directed at her as Goyle's chuckle came from behind, his shaking hand in her hair jolting fresh waves of pain through her body. <em>Death Eaters? Blood Traitors? </em>These words made her blood curdle, <em>definitely a gang</em>, but before long the meaning behind what he said made her blood freeze in outright horror. <em>Gift?</em> She was going to be a <em>gift </em>as part of the initiation for one of their young sadistic gang members?</p><p>"You should have told me that plan before I <em>Flipendo</em>-ed her through a window, she would have been much more fun to play with if she was in better shape. Just as Bella says its much more entertaining to watch the fight drain from a strong-willed person than it is to slice at the pain of one who has already given up." Lestrange did almost sound sad at this and looked at her pityingly before tutting and raising an eyebrow up at the other men. "I still cannot believe that the Dark Lord is letting Orion's youngest join us after how the older one and Andromeda turned out." Eve could hear a snort behind her and Lestrange zoned in his gaze to Goyle's face. "Now don't get me wrong the Black's have produced some of the most outstanding and dignified of our kind, I mean take my sister-in-law, proudly married to a Malfoy and my dear Bella is one of the most loyal witches to pureblood supremacy that I have ever met, but still we're taking a risk trusting this one. Anyway," he straightened his back and moved forward grasping Eve's arm pulling her out of Goyle's torturous grip, "I will be happier for spending no longer than we need to standing in the middle of Grimmauld Place." And with that he marched her across the street towards the ebony door of Number Twelve.</p>
