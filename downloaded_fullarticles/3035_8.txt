    <p align="center">I</p><p>At four o’clock, it was getting dark. It had been a splendid day, Ginny thought, especially seeing as it was late December. The sun had been shining and the Weasley family had put on their coats and scarves and taken their lunch in the fields nearest their house. It was the late afternoon, a day before Christmas, and everyone was preparing the house for the arrival of Harry Potter and Hermione Granger. They were school friends, mainly of Ron’s, who had come for the holidays. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The sun was setting beautifully when they arrived, the sky a pale purple above the dew-darkened grass of the fields. They were together, Harry with his luggage and some of Hermione’s, lagging behind. Hermione looked different, older somewhat. This was strange, for Ginny had only not seen her for the month that they had been away from school. Ginny watched her as she ran in their direction, dropping her trunk. ‘Ron!’ She cried, flinging her arms around him. Startled, he staggered slightly and then hugged her back tightly. Ginny watched them with a vague jealousy. <em>Of course, </em>she thought to herself, <em>of course I would be jealous- Dean is away with his family this Christmas. </em>I don’t have anyone to embrace. Soon after, Hermione pulled away and hugged her. Her hair smelt of lavender. Ginny shivered.</p><p>Harry approached at a slower speed, still carrying his belongings. He looked equally enthusiastic about seeing his friends again, and when he reached the two siblings he also dropped his luggage and bounded towards them.</p><p>‘I say, old brick!’ Harry clapped a hand on his best friends shoulder good-naturedly. ‘You’re looking well! And you, Ginny,’ he looked at her, eyes shining. ‘You look fine too!’</p><p>‘I’m very well thank you, Harry!’ She replied, laughing as he drew her into a hug. ‘I hope you’re well.’</p><p>‘Great, thanks!’</p><p>‘C’mon, Harry, Hermione,’ Ron said, his arms now around Harry’s shoulder. ‘Let us get some of your bags, and we’ll help you to settle in.’</p><p>‘I must bathe before I can do anything else!’ Hermione announced, setting down her belongings on the table. ‘Gin, will you help me?’</p><p align="center">-</p><p>‘I must say, it’s ever so lucky that we can have hot baths now isn’t it?’ Hermione said cheerfully as she lathered herself in soap. ‘I remember during the war- when I was a little girl, of course- we barely even had enough <em>water </em>to go around. Don’t you remember those days, Ginny?’</p><p>Ginny giggled, dipping her fingers into the water. She was right- it was hot. ‘Barely. I was five when it broke out- you were six. It’s not like we have much to go on.’</p><p>Hermione shrugged indifferently, leaning back against the tub. ‘I remember.’</p><p>When stood up, and Ginny felt a stabbing sort of pain-pleasure in her lower region. Immediately she recognised this as a reaction to Hermione’s rather dramatic exposure of her body. She hadn’t even waited for the bath to drain- simply stood up stark naked and started towelling herself off.</p><p>Ginny had always been aware of how beautiful she was. She thought about it most days. But she hadn’t ever seen her <em>naked.</em> This was a completely new level of beauty.</p><p>It was all she could not do to stare. But it was so difficult, and her eyes kept on drifting back to the swell of Hermione’s breasts. There was a dampness in her knickers.</p><p>‘You can look,’ she said softly. There was a glimmer of amusement in her eyes as they caught Ginny’s. ‘I won’t tell.’</p><p>’N-no, it’s not- I wasn’t-’ Ginny stammered, her cheeks flooding with red. ‘Hermione-’</p><p>‘-Pass me my brown stockings, will you? They’re on the floor next to you.’</p><p>‘I-’</p><p>‘Gin, it’s fine.’ Hermione smiled, slightly impatiently. ‘I don’t care. We’ll talk about this later if you’d like. But right now may I have my stockings? I’m getting rather chilly.’</p><p>‘Sure.’ She mumbled and handed them to her. ‘I need to go.’</p><p align="center">-</p><p>When Fleur arrived during dinner she glided into the room, her white-blonde hair escaping in tendrils from under her scarf as she hung her long coat up on the rack by the door. ‘'Appy Christmas Eve! ‘Ow is everybody?’</p><p>A collective murmur of assent spread through the dining room. ‘Did anyone accompany you here, dear?’ Mrs Weasley asked politely, ladling a large spoonful of peas and potatoes onto a plate.</p><p>‘<em>Non,</em>’ Fleur dismissively. ‘I travel alone.’</p><p>‘I say!’ Percy put down his knife and fork, shaking his head disapprovingly. ‘That’s hardly proper! Did anyone comment?’</p><p>‘Eet was <em>fine, </em>thank you, Percy.’ She made a face at him, insinuating that she wished to end the conversation. He nodded stiffly. ‘<em>Où est Bill</em>?’</p><p>Ginny made eye contact with Harry, who was trying to stifle his laughter and failing miserably. She giggled. Fred and George managed to lighten the mood considerably with their jokey crackers to which everyone responded positively (aside from Percy, who continued to grumble about anything that he could think of). Soon enough, plates were cleared, stomachs were filled, and everyone sat back with a sleepy contentedness that often comes after a large meal.</p><p>‘All right!’ Mrs Weasley clapped her hands together and began to collect the dishes. ‘Time for bed, everybody.’</p><p align="center">-</p><p>‘So,’ Hermione was sitting up in her bed, a finger twirling in her hair. She was looking at Ginny, who was reading, intently. ‘Are you going to tell me what this afternoon was all about?’</p><p>‘It was nothing, really.’ Ginny said uncomfortably. ‘Please, can we forget about it?’</p><p>‘No.’ She grinned. ‘What’s been going on with you today? You’ve been weird around me, Gin. I jolly well hope I haven’t done anything wrong. Have I hurt you or something?’</p><p>‘<em>No!</em>’ She replied quickly. ‘No, of course not. I just… I just- I don’t know what’s going on.’</p><p>Hermione frowned. ‘Well, of course you do. You’re just not telling me. Come on- I won’t tell.’</p><p>‘You’ll laugh.’</p><p>‘Whatever it is, I promise I won’t laugh.’</p><p>‘Or get angry.’</p><p>‘-Or get angry.’</p><p>Ginny looked at the floor fiercely- she could feel her cheeks heating up. ‘I don’t like boys.’</p><p>There was a silence, and Ginny didn’t dare to look up. Finally, Hermione spoke again. ‘Well! You mean- not at all? You’ve been going steady with Dean Thomas for <em>months </em>now.’</p><p>Ginny shrugged. ‘It’s a distraction. I mean- he is.’</p><p>Hermione’s eyebrows furrowed and she moved closer to her. When she spoke again, her voice was gentler. Quieter. ‘From what, Gin?’</p><p>Ginny stuck her tongue in her cheek. They both knew what was coming next, but Ginny still couldn’t bear to say it. She felt it rather abnormal to feel attraction in such a way.</p><p>‘From- from girls.’</p><p>Ginny held her breath and waited for a response, but it never came. After half an hour, she turned around in bed to blow out the candle and looked at the other girl. Her eyes were closed- she was asleep.</p>
