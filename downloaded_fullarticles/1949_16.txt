    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p>Draco arrived home, finally. He was so tired he felt like sleeping for five years. He was in the field the whole day, watching over the game between the Appleby Arrows and the Caerphilly Catapults. They seemed like they wanted to kill each other that day, and he had to fix two legs, three shoulders, and send two to St Mungo's because he couldn't just fix them on a stretcher.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He wasn't living on the Manor, now. Not anymore. He and his mother moved to a smaller, cosier house. It was still big and beautiful, like all Malfoy states, but this one was his mother's only, and it looked pretty feminine and floral, with light pink walls and golden details. His father never liked it much, but being in Azkaban, he had no saying in it. Draco loved it. His bedroom had huge windows and he had an amazing view of his mother's garden.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He took off his robes as soon as he stepped in his bedroom, heading to his en suite and taking a shower. He was too tired to wait for a bath. He took off his hair from the braid it was in, letting it fall by his shoulders. He analysed its length, looking pleased to see it was almost reaching his bum. Sometimes he got tired of taking care of it, but he loved his hair long anyways.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After showered, clean and dry, he put on some shorts and a tee and sat down on his desk. He was about to grab a piece of parchment and a quill when he remembered the device his boyfriend had given him a few months before. He opened his drawer, grabbing the little muggle machine with the name NOKIA on top, and looked at the bars that said if it had energy or not. It still had two bars, so he guessed he didn't need to ask Harry to charge it just yet.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now, the button pressing. He took a while to learn how to do it, but after two months, it was almost natural. He counted on his head.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>444 6 28 44666 633</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>"Im at home already. Are you fine? Is your leg okay? Please don't dive like that again. I want you to be alive for our marriage."</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p>A whole day in the air never failed to net Harry a few injuries. As he took in his appearance in the mirror, he realised that age was catching him up a bit. The spells didn’t heal him as quick as they used to, and the bruises on his knuckles and torso looked angry.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He lived outside the city now, in a small village near the south coast. It was beautiful, stone walls and wards strong enough to keep the public and the press at bay.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He felt like he’d finally found the peace that he’d sought all his life. This was heavenly, and it missed only one thing. His boyfriend, who he’d been serious about for the best part of a year. Merlin! Draco had turned his head from the first moment he’d seen him at the side of the Quidditch pitch at the end of last season, working as a field Healer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry had been drawn almost unconsciously to the man, his lush long hair and his skilled, serious manner as he worked on his teammates. If he could improve only one thing, it would be have him embrace muggle technology a bit more! It’d taken weeks to get him using that phone.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As if he had summoned the item into use, Harry heard Draco’s ringtone. Laughing at his worries, Harry guaranteed he would be very much alive for their marriage. He was very excited about that particular event.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>“So do you want to come over Draco? We could have takeout or I could make something. I know your opinions over my cooking but I’m sure I can change your mind.... Tell you what, if you decide to wear those gorgeous shorts I’ll even stretch to some dessert...”</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p>Harry knew Draco was traditional, but he couldn’t resist the teasing. It felt like every part of his fiancé had been personally created to please him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco was looking to the mobile as if he could will Harry to answer faster.  He jumped a little when the thing made that chirpy sound that Harry assured him he could change, but he still didn't know how. He tried to hide his excitement, even though he was alone in his bedroom.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>"Didn't I do enough for you by fixing your damn leg? But I guess I can be persuaded. I'm actually craving some pizza, and you're the only one who knows how to order it. So maybe you can have me some mozzarella pizza while I change into appropriate attire. See you in 15?"</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He texted back. He knew he would end up in shorts anyway, he had started to fancy having free legs all the time, and if Harry got the hots for him because of it, he didn't mind.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco changed into newer shorts, one that hugged his arse just so, but he made sure to use a long enough tee shirt that hid it from view. It was Harry's, and it had some cartoon on the front. Draco didn't know what it was, but it was comfy and big enough to almost reach his thighs. Draco brushed his hair, making sure it was silky and perfectly straight, before he put on some sandals, because right now, the only thing he wanted was to be comfortable. He headed to the hearth, grabbing some flu and saying Harry's address.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He looked around the living room, searching Harry with his eyes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Harry?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Well, you’re a sight for sore eyes. You’re obviously using your Healer skills to heal those too, because I’m feeling better just looking at you...”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry was physically much bigger than Draco. While his fiancé was slight, Harry was wide and muscular, tall and very strong. All his years on the quidditch pitch had made him physically powerful. Pulling Draco to him, he kissed the top of his partner’s hair, sliding his arms around his shoulders. He was careful to respect his fiancés boundaries, never wishing to push him too far, yet with every meeting Harry found himself falling more strongly and more deeply for Draco. Harry couldn’t help but admire his slight, delicate body as he held him near him, the material of the shorts sliding invitingly across his leg...</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Not wanting to get carried on the feeling, Harry pulled away. Brushing his lips once more on Draco’s hair, he moved off to the door. The pizza had arrived and Draco liked his dinner promptly. It wouldn’t do to keep him waiting when he was so hungry.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco rolled his eyes, trying to avoid smiling, but it was obvious he was holding it back. He sighed happily when Harry hugged him, feeling warm all over. Harry was so big compared to him, that Draco felt his legs shake a little. He also had to control his own urges. It's been a little more than a year that they were dating, and every passing day, Draco felt more and more attached to Harry. He was beautiful, and sexy, and Draco often had naughty dreams starring Harry, but he couldn't give in.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If there was a thing that Draco loved more than Healing and Harry, it was tradition. He wasn't the most traditional person ever, it would've been his father, but he still valued a good tradition. And it meant that they weren't to have sex until after their marriage. When Harry asked for his hand - to his mum, as tradition said -, Draco felt over the moon. Now, he couldn't wait for it, because he wanted to give in.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He loved that Harry respect his boundaries and never pressed him to do anything he didn't want. That boundaries were born not only from tradition, but also because Draco had a few differences about his body. He was born intersexed, as it was somehow common for pureblood babies, specially nowadays with such small number of families. They had magical treatments to keep them fertile, and special babies like him, were treated as a rare diamond. Draco was taught to hide himself from view and remain pure and untouched until marriage. He was treated as a boy his whole life, although he knew, if he wished, being who he was, his family would’ve accepted him as a girl, or even both.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sometimes Draco wanted Harry to touch him more intimately, and once, when he was feeling bold and closer to his PMS and his tiny breasts were super sensitive, he let Harry touch them. He had come with that touch only, and he felt super guilty for not giving nothing back to Harry, so he let him peak under his shirt. From time to time, Draco felt super embarrassed knowing that Harry had seen his chest this one time. But most of the time, he forgot about it. Especially when there was pizza around.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Is it mozzarella?” Draco asked behind Harry's back, holding his waist and trying to look at the pizza box, as if he could see through it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As much as Harry was growing to love Draco, his hunger won out and within a few minutes both were enjoyed the pizza. As he ate, Harry thought how beautiful Draco looked when he was relaxed, happy and enjoying himself. His fiancé spent so much time on his appearance, and how he presented himself to the world, it was a simple pleasure to see him looking so carefree. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>But he was so gorgeous. His skin so flawless, soft as the hair that rolled down his back in a silver sheet. Every night Harry fantasised about their wedding night, about how he was going to use Draco in every position he’d ever been able to imagine. Harry knew that Draco had biological differences, and that thought was so utterly alluring to him. He wanted to kiss, caress and love Draco everywhere, worship his body in the way that he deserved. They had shared an incredibly erotic experience when Draco had shown him his beautiful breasts. Even the thought of them made Harry hard, and he knew that their wedding couldn’t come fast enough.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But one of the most attractive parts of Draco was his traditional nature that guided his actions. It was so exciting to Harry that Draco was pure, virginal and had waited for his love. He wanted to make everything incredibly special, and knew that their wedding would only be the first step in a full and wonderful life together.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>His eyes drifting over his beloved, taking in every part of him. He knew he was a lucky man. After they ate, perhaps Draco would tell him more of what he wanted their wedding to be like. After all, it couldn’t come fast enough.</p>
<p>Draco tried to stay prim and poised when eating, but pizza... It was hard to eat pizza like a gentleman, especially when he had an oaf of a boyfriend at his side. It was delicious, though, and he didn't care he was licking his fingers after.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“So... Our marriage is in three months. I think I have found the perfect place for our ceremony,” Draco started, turning a little to look directly to Harry. They were on the sofa, because they couldn't bother eating properly at the table.”Also... Do you know someone who could cast the bonding spell on us? It must be a very important person. And you know a lot of important people.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I certainly do know a few important people... but it still has to be somebody we love and care about. I won’t have anybody at our bonding that isn’t somebody we absolutely want there. Luckily, I happen to have been at school with our current Minister for Magic so hopefully that’s important enough for you?...”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry loved to please Draco. While his taste ran to the more simple things in life, nothing pleased him more that getting Draco smiling. Of course, he could imagine all the fancy clothes and flowers Draco would think absolutely necessary, but he’s put up with anything to make this man a permanent part of his life.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He knew that this was it for him, the very moment they had first spoken. Draco had never treated Harry the way others did. Harry had been with so many other lovers, nameless faces that blurred into one another as the last few years had passed. Draco was different. From the first time he’d said a clear <em>no</em>, and explained his principles, Harry had wanted him. For the first time, this Harry understood this was a man with perfect self-respect and understanding of what he wanted. God’s, he wanted him badly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Tell me then, sweetheart. Where is this place you’ve chosen for our ceremony. I’m intrigued....”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco smiled with his words, rolling his eyes and resting against Harry, thinking a little.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“It would be awesome to have the Minister to perform our bonding. I'm sure it will be out on the news even if there's no reporter there.” Draco grabbed one of Harry's arms and put around his own shoulder, tucking himself on Harry's side. He put his legs close to his body, and continued. “It is one of the old Black estates. We haven't done anything with it because it's only an empty land with some greenery. But I think that we can have it all trimmed and full of flowers by the time we marry, and a beautiful gazebo in the middle. It will have space for all of our guests <em>and</em> we wouldn't have to talk to anyone who might tell other people where our marriage is happening. What do you think?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He looked up at Harry, big, grey eyes waiting. He knew Harry has had other lovers before him, and it made him a little nervous. What if he wasn't good enough? What if Harry didn't like his body? What if he didn't like the way he was? Draco worried his bottom lip, trying not to listen to his worries.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Sweetheart, that all sounds so beautiful.  You’ve thought of everything. Kind, beautiful... I’m a lucky man... The Black Estate it is then. I’ll leave all the other preparations in your capable hands”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry felt absolutely superb sitting so close to Draco. So much smaller than he was, it was as if they’d been made to fit together. He was warm, his hair soft in his fingers and his breath against Harry’s neck smelt sweet and intoxicating. He wanted take Draco, mark him, love him forever. But he knew that it could wait. They would have forever.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry could see that Draco felt worried. He was biting his bottom lip, always a tell he was anxious. Stroking his face, as he met his eyes, Harry decided he needed to know.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Talk to me, lovely. What is it you’re thinking about? Somethings upsetting you, but you have to tell me...”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco smiled, happy that he could proceed with the planning. He knew Mrs. Weasley wanted to play caterer and have all the food preparation on her own hands, and he didn't want to fight that. He also knew his own mum would want to decorate everything, and so he would leave it to her. The only things he and Harry had to worry about were their clothes, the guest list, sending the invitations, and... Well, showing up. They already had their best man and maid of honour, so it wasn't something to worry about.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He was surprised by Harry's question. He blinked, trying to remember what he was thinking so he could answer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“It's... Stupid, really. Just... I worry that our first night is going to suck. Because... I mean, you have done it before. So I guess you're good at it. I have never... I have never had sex. The first time you touched me more intimately, I made a fool of myself. I worry that I won't be able to give you what you need.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco tried to say it like it was just a fact, nothing more, but it worried him still.</p>
<p>Harry never failed to be surprised by Draco. Here was a man, working at the top of his profession, a confident, sweet and enthusiastic person. Yet, here he was, worried about disappointing him. Surely, Draco knew that the only way he’d ever disappoint Harry was if he wasn’t true to himself. Harry needed to be careful about what he said next. He couldn’t take the risk of hurting his fiancé.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Well, yes, I’ve had sex before. And you know what? None of those people meant anything to me. All of those people wanted the saviour, the Harry Potter Quidditch star. They didn’t see the real person. You do, you always have and that’s why I want to marry you... In some ways, it’ll be my first time too, because I’ve never had sex with a person I loved before. And I love you, I truly do... And what do you mean, you made a fool of yourself? I promise you, touching you has stayed with me every waking moment, and haunted my dreams too. You have no idea what you do to me, how much I desire you... you’re everything I need, the completion of my dreams. I want you in every way, body, mind... And I want you to have my babies too, I want to see you big with our children, and love and support you...”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He faltered, unable to say more. Harry was a brave man, but he couldn’t look at Draco then. He was afraid of what he’d see in his big, grey eyes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco felt his heart jump in his ribcage, his body tingled with love and pleasure. He raised himself on his knees, so he could look Harry directly in his eyes, and balanced himself by holding onto Harry's square shoulders.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I was afraid of asking if you liked that... I've never felt comfortable with... Showing myself before. I've always used chest binders when growing up and... For many reasons, I've never told anyone what's inside my pants. When I decided to tell you, it was because I knew you were it for me. And that I wanted you to accept me as I am. I would dread to use spells to <em>fix</em> my appearance every day of my life,” Draco swallowed saliva, his heart beating even faster now. “And... you know, that according to my personal beliefs, I'm starting to get too old. I should've had babies like five years ago. So I'd... <em>love</em> to have your babies. The more, the better. All of them with beautiful black hair and green eyes, just like you..."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry looked at his loved one. This was more than Draco had ever said before. He was startled at the strength of his feelings at that moment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The idea that Draco had ever considered using spells to change his appearance was devastating. He thought the man in front of him was beautiful - a gift that had been created to fulfil his every dream - and he wanted to hex anyone who’d ever made him feel less than perfect. He wanted Draco to be proud of his body, and he’d stand by him every moment until he was.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And the idea that they could have a baby... babies... was amazing. A part of him didn’t want to wait, a feral, deep rooted need to rut his baby into his lover’s body washing over him. He knew that Draco was traditional, and Harry would never hurt him, so he could never act on it now... but once this body was offered to up to him after their marriage, he knew he’d not be able to stop.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He leaned in, pressing chaste kisses onto Draco’s forehead, stroking his fingers through the soft hair that framed his face. Rubbing his thumb along his lips, he asked if he could kiss him. Every boundary was precious, and he wanted Draco to feel as comfortable as he could be.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco closed his eyes, breathing in Harry's scent and sighing happily. If someone had told him three years ago that Harry Potter was going to be this gentle and caring as a boyfriend, Draco would've laughed on their faces. But now... Harry was treating him like a prince, and Draco loved it. He loved every second of it, because he felt loved, he felt like he was perfect, and it was a thing that he hadn't felt for a long time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He moved his own head, touching his lips to Harry's and holding on his tee shirt, opening his mouth, giving permission so Harry could explore it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry felt privileged to be able to touch Draco like he was doing. The kiss was warm, intimate and held all the promise of their future. Harry deepened the kiss, finding Draco’s mouth incredibly soft.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He tasted delicious, and Harry knew then that he’d never shared a more perfect kiss with anyone. Yes, Harry had been with many people, one night stands that had meant so little. But so often, kissing was just skipped over to get straight onto more sexy activities. Harry had never appreciated that with the right person, a kiss could be the most beautiful thing. He was exposing more of his soul in this kiss than through any of his previous sexual encounters.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry could feel his body reacting to the kiss, and he knew that it would take only one look from Draco for him to carry him into bed. But he’d never put his beloved into the position of feeling pressured.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Pulling away, panting and red-faced, Harry said they needed to take a break. Going into the kitchen for dessert, he couldn’t help but reflect that his fiancé was simply irresistible.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This was one of the times that Draco wished Harry would just touch him. He was getting carried away with the kiss, and his body tingled and warmed all over. He wanted more than just a kiss, even though he wouldn't give more than just touching. He knew Harry had to hold back much more than he had, and it was pretty obvious to see his erection under his clothes as he left to get them desserts.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco smiled, pleased and guilty. Pleased because he loved to know his kiss and his body caused that effect on Harry. And guilty because... Yes, he know that he couldn't give more to him. Or maybe he could. He worried his bottom lip once again, thinking. How could he ease this pressure on Harry but not open his legs before the marriage? </p>
<p> </p>
<p>He got up, going after Harry in the kitchen.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Harry... I was thinking...” Draco touched his back to the kitchen wall, looking up to his fiancé. “I feel like I'm putting too much pressure on you with all this waiting. And I know I can handle more than you, because I've never had sex and you... Well, what I am trying to say is that... Maybe I can help?  Giving you a little more? I'm not up to taking my pants off, but... Maybe I can use my hands? Even...” At this point his was beet red, and he swallowed saliva, feeling his pleasure pool in the middle of his legs with the mete thought. “Even my mouth?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry was incredibly shocked to hear these words come out of Draco’s mouth. He felt guilty, too because he’d been so hard just moments before. He didn’t want anything to compromise Draco’s principles, and he didn’t want to pressure him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But at the same time, he was fascinated by the idea that Draco wanted to take things further... Always so shy about his body, so lacking in confidence about sex when they spoke, would it prove to him that he was more than enough, that Harry was so erotically charged by Draco?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I don’t know, Draco... you’ve never suggested that kind of act before... of course I want to, I’m desperate for you. If you want to touch, really truly, then we can... but I think we should try that first....”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He held Draco’s hand at that point, to reassure and show love. If initiate touching was what the other man wanted, then he could also lead him to their bedroom.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco held his hand back, and squeezed it a little. He was trying to build confidence inside himself. He wouldn't just open his legs, he still had principles, but as long as he didn't lose his virginity, he would be doing what he needed to do. He didn't think Hermione would likely perform the virginity confirmation spell, being who she was she probably thought it was plain sexism. He didn't mind the spell, but he thought that maybe he was taking it too far.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Well, Draco wanted. He wanted something. Every time he felt that Harry was aroused because of him, he wanted to give in. Touching him in any way would ease that need.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I want to touch you. Harry, I know I'm traditional, but I'm not a prude,” Draco started, raising his chin as if to try to prove his point, even if Harry towered over him. “I have needs and I desire you just like you desire me. I just want my first time to be meaningful and respective of tradition. It doesn't take the want away. I... I'd like to see you naked. Ironically, you've seen my chest but I've never seen your...” He eyed meaningfully Harry's crotch before looking back to his eyes. “Believe me, I <em>want it</em>. Maybe... Maybe I'd like you to touch me above my navel too. It's only three months. We... I guess, we can play before it, can't we?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “You’re right”, Harry said, his voice hoarse. “It is only three months... And I do want you. Every time we’re close I’m hard for you. You’re playing on my desires like no man ever has before. If this is what you truly want, I suggest we move upstairs-”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Squeezing Draco’s hand once more, they moved slowly up the stairs. Every so often, Harry would pull his loved one to him, kissing his hair or finding his lips. <em>So rarely are you aware</em>, Harry marvelled, <em>that you are taking part in events that you’d remember for the rest of your life. </em></p>
