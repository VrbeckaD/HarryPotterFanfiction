    <p>Harry was tired. His entire life has been dictated by a prophecy made long before he was even born, under the assumption that it was inevitable. Was it, thought?  Although he trusted Dumbledore, he couldn’t help the bitter thoughts that filled his head at what-ifs or what-could have-beens. </p><p>Harry realized at once, that at this point, these kinds of thoughts were pointless.  He knew, for all his shortcomings, Dumbledore always had his best interest in heart and didn’t want this to happen.<br/>
Really, what reasons he had, to be angry anymore? Soon, he will be with his loved ones, no longer he will have to fight a war he didn’t want to. Harry knew he was being selfish, but doesn’t he, after all the things he has gone through, deserve a little bit of happiness?<br/>
He trusted his friends to finish Voldemort by themselves –  they had many capable wizards and witches fighting alongside them, who will watch their backs.</p><p>And Ginny… she will move on eventually, he believed. Because she is strong.</p><p>It is time to let himself go.</p><p>He let out a deep sigh and turned to Dumbledore, who, as if reading his thoughts, only smiled sadly at him, already knowing.</p><p>“Professor-“ Harry started, but Dumbledore stopped him with gesture, immediately replying.<br/>
“You don’t need to explain yourself to me, Harry. If anyone has a right to rest, It would be you. “ He smiled kindly at the boy who has gone through much. He offered his hand.<br/>
“Shall we go, then?”<br/>
For the first time in a long time Harry genuinely smiled in response and took the offered hand, boarding the Train in the not-quite King’s Cross.</p><p>In the world of Azeroth a strange being startled slightly in suprise, eyes narrowing as it felt the leylines of the world shifting, thrumming with power. A sign of something significant happening.<br/>
<i>Huh. Interesting. </i></p>
