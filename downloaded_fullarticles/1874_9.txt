    <p>Harry Potter really was the bane of Draco’s existence. He was a right twat even without the whole hero thing, and he had once again! publicly humiliated the Malfoys. He couldn’t just let Potter disrespect his father like that, whether the Dark Lord knew of it or not. This was becoming a recurring theme and Draco had to get back at Potter before things got worse.</p><p>He knew he wasn’t supposed to draw attention or do anything public himself – the stakes were now a lot higher and someone looking into the Malfoy Manor for whatever purposes could’ve cost Draco more than his own life. Or his family’s honor. This was beyond that.</p><p>Draco also didn’t know how much he could trust Crabbe or Goyle, so they were out of the question. Thankfully they were still quite dim, as other slytherins would’ve been a much bigger threat if someone was to find out. Better be careful. Better be alone. This plan didn't need much anyway. Just a simple in-and-out, cause havoc and laugh a little the next morning. Nobody had to know it was him.</p>
