    <p>Remus Lupin was an unequivocal, absolute buggering idiot.<br/>
That’s what he told himself as he stumbled up to the prestigious slate gateway that lead to the Black Palace, a structure whose name painted it to be a whole lot more gothic and cruel than the real life picture. His shabby briefcase weighed down one shoulder, and he couldn’t help but feel insecure about how unprofessional he probably looked against the jarring background of the royal families palace, Remus needed the money, however, and kept stomping along the carefully laid brick pathway that cut through to the palace’s front lawn, trying desperately to ignore the doubtful thoughts that swirled into his mind.<br/>
He needed this.<br/>
A proper gentleman dressed in an all-black suit (oh, the irony) had been arranged to let Remus into the property and he shot an appreciate smile toward the man, who tipped his head and was off toward the castle before Remus had finished his blink. He finally lifted his nervous eyes off of his own worn through shoes to look at the palace, the breath had been stolen from his windpipe the second he laid eyes on the building. The Black Family palace, his new home for the next twelve months. It looked straight out of a renaissance painting; tiny figures were etched into the grey stone of the pillars that stood dauntingly at the palace entrance and the structure itself looked ready to fight any intruder that stepped onto the lawns, including Remus.<br/>
Jesus Christ lupin, he told himself, you really think a building is going to beat you up? </p><p>It had been almost a week before Remus had finally gained the courage to leave his room, halfway through the settling in period his employers had given him at the very start of his moving in.<br/>
He knew more than he wished to admit about the famed royal Black family, from Narcissa’s recent engagement to Lucius, a man who made a living through being inherently wealthy, to the news of Bella’s recent reported mental break. Andromeda was the queen of London at this time, and she was the best leader the country had ever seen, her tight laws surrounding wealth distribution brought prosperity to the lower half and humbled the upper, she had also been with child throughout her coronation, a fact in which earnt her respect from the masses and later brought her the young Nymphadora Tonks-Black, her daughter who was widely-loved by the public for her mischievous and adorable ways.<br/>
Despite the sisters being of a much higher power, a great deal of attention had always been put on the family of Walburga Black, who had secured her place in the castle as the cousin of the Black sisters and had secured a fortune from her wealthy actor husband, Orion. Her sons, Sirius and Regulus (Remus would make a remark on their names, if only his wasn’t equally unfortunate.) were often photographed and it felt as though Remus had known them since childhood, due to the frequency of their daily activities being front-page news and how the girls at his small school had fawned over the boys, it seemed like Remus just could never escape the Black sons.<br/>
Hence, his idiocy at taking this job, a job in which he would have to live with the sons for at least one whole year. Jesus fucking Christ. </p><p>The hallway was littered with paintings of previous royals, each painted in rich jewel tones by what Remus could only imagine would have been the wealthiest artists of their generations. Before his arrival, he had prayed that the family would have left him his own uniform or at least change of clothes, yet they had been unsuccessful in this, so Remus was left to walk through the halls in a dirty maroon sweater and mustard corduroy pants.<br/>
A petite maid scurried past and Remus almost went to ask her for the bathroom but took far too long in his internal decision making and she was out of sight by the time he had opened his mouth.<br/>
So, he looked like an unequivocal, absolute buggering idiot when Black brother number two turned into this particular hallway and caught sight of him.<br/>
Remus Lupin, standing there in his well-worn clothes, mouth wide open and looking both petrified and mortified all at once.<br/>
“Hello...?” the younger and well-kempt black brother called out. “You must be the new au pair?”</p>
