    <p>The last thing Credence remembers before he wakes is being surrounded by witches. Bright lights had shot out of their wands to ravage the already frayed edges of him, and the assault hadn’t stopped until he became enfolded so tightly within his own darkness that there was no light left to hurt him.</p><p>Now – awake – he is cold and wet and still scared.</p><p>Credence is used to being cold, and he’s spent his whole life scared—those things don't bother him. It’s the wet that slides wrongly against his skin, that causes his lungs to fill with water when he tries to breathe, that makes his chest hurt. His eyes, he thinks, might be greying out along the edges, but it's impossible to tell when it’s not only water he’s being submerged in: the darkness he created and collapsed into has followed him here, wherever here is.</p><p>This is what drowning feels like, Credence realizes, thoughts slow and water-logged. Perhaps his limbs should be fighting to find air, to live, in the same way his lungs are, but surely Credence is already dead. He remembers Ma’s stories, the ones about how witches would be hung or burned or drowned as punishment for their devilry.</p><p>Drowning must be Credence’s punishment.</p><p>He’s almost willing to accept this as his fate, too. Part of him is even urging him to give in, that this is for the best, that he will face a far crueller suffering if he survives—except there are hands touching him, holding him down and dragging him deeper. They are strong, these hands. They lock around his wrists and forearms, his calves and ankles, his biceps and thighs and stomach.</p><p>It feels like worms are writhing under his skin, like he’s rubbing his palms against rough brick, or like the burning slap of Ma scoring lashes into him with his own belt. He seizes up in the clammy grip, then he thrashes, fear and desperation finally cutting through his muddied thoughts, but he’s being held too tightly to break free now.</p><p>The hands everywhere—</p><p>           —slither under his clothes</p><p>                     dig     bruises     into     his     skin—</p><p>      —sharp nails gouge red trails</p><p>                                     across his face</p><p>                                                     his    cheeks—</p><p>                 —fingers tangle in his hair and</p><p>                                                                     yank—</p><p>The panic chokes worse than the water, releases a tremor that breaks up the foundation Credence’s restraint is built on, until suddenly he can’t control it, can’t control himself, so he just . . . stops.</p><p>Falls apart.</p><p>Dissolves.</p><p>He becomes a storm of black sand and smoke. His sense of touch dulls mercifully, so he hardly feels it when the streams and particles of himself slip through the grasping fingers. He tears through the water, through those hands and their connecting bodies, and the dark waters churn with him.</p><p>He makes himself big, spreading thin until he takes up every inch of the space, and he rises. Higher and higher, past the cold, still torsos that used to be attached to the hands that restrained him, now torn limbless. They follow his rise, but slower. Floating towards a surface Credence is fighting to reach.</p><p>When he does reach the water’s surface, he doesn’t inhale so much as soak in the air. He has no eyes to see—and yet he does see. He sees the eerie green light, a beacon in what he now knows to be a dark, dank cavern. The light comes from a tall basin on an island in the middle of the cavern’s wide lake. He sees the rickety boat parked at the island, swaying back and forth, looking ready to sink. The bodies breach the lake’s surface, bloodless, bloated. Their hair is lank, stringy, and the green light casts a sickly glow upon their skin. The sight of them and their dismembered limbs bobbing in the water is a nightmare Credence didn’t know he had.</p><p>Credence finds the break in the cavern’s uneven rock walls and rushes blindly towards it, desperate to get away, though he doesn’t know where he wants to go. He bursts out of the cave as an undulating mass of darkness. What awaits him, thank the Lord, is a wide-open night sky.</p><p>The moon is a bright, smiling crescent. Its shine is caught and reflected by the ocean, and there is complete silence besides the crash of waves against the rough cliffside Credence emerged from.</p><p>Slowly, all the dust motes of Credence’s body congregate together. His flesh body is remade, bit by bit, until he is left on his hands and knees. His lungs stutter, then he’s coughing, spitting, hacking up all the water he breathed in. It comes out his nose and burns worse than his leaking eyes. He vomits food he doesn’t remember eating.</p><p>Finally, after it feels like he’s wrung all the liquid out of his body, Credence collapses completely. He takes in a shuddering breath, face pressed against stone, then lets it out. He breathes in and out until he regains a tenuous control of himself, until he stops coming apart at the seams, until he finds the strength to get his arms under him and push. Credence sits up, hugs his arms to his chest, and his legs rest, askew, in front of him. He tries to contain his shivering.</p><p>Now that Credence isn’t drowning or panicking, he’s clear-headed enough to wonder, <em>Where am I?</em></p><p>The answer comes to him swifter than the question had, as if he already knew but had forgotten: he’s in England.</p><p><em>Why am I here?</em> Credence wonders next.</p><p>The answer comes to him even quicker this time, accompanied with a surge of emotion too tangled for Credence to parse – it is triumph and disgust, it is terror and not a small amount of shame. He is here for a cursed object, one of significance, that is in the form of a locket. He had to retrieve it – retrieve it and then destroy it. But he didn’t destroy it . . . he couldn’t, not before the Inferi (<em>Inferi?</em> Oh, the reanimated dead) came and dragged him beneath the lake.</p><p>
  <em>Where is the locket now?</em>
</p><p>Credence isn’t sure what to make of his own feelings of agitation or the sagging relief that nearly overtakes him when he remembers a creature, small and wrinkly with large, bat-like ears and eyes like two yellow moons set into its face. A house-elf. Kreacher. Loyal to Credence above all, even Mother (<em>not Ma?</em> No . . . but similar enough), there is no one Credence trusts more than Kreacher.</p><p><em>How did I get here?</em> Well, that’s easy. Kreacher brought him here. But he was in New York—?</p><p>A sharp pain spikes through Credence’s head, making him wince. He’s confused. He knows all the answers to his questions, but they don’t make any sense. Now he’s stuck here, at the bottom of a cliff’s edge, sopping wet and more than half-drowned, with nowhere to go.</p><p>How is he supposed to—? Ah, of course.</p><p>“Kreacher,” Credence says.</p><p>A <em>CRACK</em> and there Kreacher is, just as Credence pictured, except for the fact that he is sobbing into the pillowcase he wears as clothing. “Master Regulus is not d-d-d-dead? Master Regulus c-c-called for poor Kreacher?”</p><p>“Yes,” Credence says without thinking. He thinks he should be unnerved to be referred to by another name, never mind being called ‘Master,’ but instead he feels revelation. He remembers now what he had forgotten at some point in the cave.</p><p>He is Regulus Arcturus Black, recently made the Lord of his House. He is a Death Eater, a follower of the Dark Lord Voldemort. And he is a traitor – to his father, who died a handful of months after Regulus’s graduation but is still present as a silent, stoic figure looming in the back of Regulus’s mind; to his mother, who only truly comes alive nowadays when she’s telling Regulus how proud she is of him for going into the Dark Lord’s service or, increasingly often, hissing vitriol about muggles, mudbloods, and squibs; but, most of all, Regulus is now a traitor to the Dark Lord himself.</p><p>And yet. . . .</p><p>He is also Credence Barebone. He feels like Credence in the way his flesh vibrates against his bones, trying to tear itself away in strips to escape; or in the way his shoulders are hunched over and aching, even though the only being close to him for kilometers is Kreacher, who would never hurt him; or in the way he can look at his hands and not recognise his ownership of them, but when he covers his ears and traces the thoughts in his head, his mind is comforting, familiar, and safe.</p><p>Pain shoots through his head again, lingering this time. He closes his eyes and digs the heels of his palms into them until all he can see is the eruption of stars.</p><p>“Master Regulus?”</p><p>“Yes,” he answers, forcing himself to drop his hands and look at Kreacher, though he can’t quite bring himself to meet Kreacher’s eyes.</p><p>“Would Master Regulus be wanting to go home now?” Kreacher asks, wringing his pillowcase anxiously.</p><p>The thought of seeing Ma makes his palms itch. The thought of seeing Mother makes him feel . . . ashamed, though he’s not sure if it’s her he’s ashamed of or himself.</p><p>Ma is dead though. Dead and gone because he killed her. Even if she was alive, she would be in America. He’s in England. He’s safe—from her. Mother, though . . . she never leaves the house. She haunts the halls now, a ghost clothed in flesh, screeching and weeping and mad. He’s had to soundproof his room to sleep through the night. He’s never done well with noise and, more than anything, it is the longing for silence, especially of his own making, that forms his answer.</p>
