    <p>Prologue Part 1</p><p>~~May 7th, 1984~~</p><p>It was a lovely day in Little Whinging, Surrey. The sun was out, birds singing and families were starting their day. Though the family at #4 private drive was different. Petunia was just finishing putting her son, Dudley's shoes on. Dudley was a young 4 year old boy, slightly pudgy, adorable to a degree but not the brightest. "Skoo, skoo," the boy chanted happily as his mother picked him up. Walking to the front door she called out to her husband. "Taking Didums to preschool dear, then shopping. Be back later,"she yelled before leaving the house with her son.</p><p>Now Vernon Dursley was a very large and stout fellow. He also had a very short temper, skewed reality and a twisted mind. As soon as his wife had left, he marched downstairs and threw open the cupboard door right under the stairs. Inside was a small child about as old as his son. "Get up boy," Vernon growled as he reached in and pulled the child out. The boy groggily opened his eyes but yelped as his uncle gripped his arm roughly. "Unca... Ows.. Hurs," he whimpered out. Vernon ignored him as his mind reeled with horrible visions. </p><p>The boy, though barely 4 yrs of age, was quite beautiful. His skin was white as snow with lips of lightest pink and soft as petals. His hair, though short and unkempt, was the silkiest and the darkest shade of black. Though what drew one in was his iridescent emerald eyes. Within moments the living room curtains were drawn and the boy was thrown on the couch. The boy was scared now and stared up at his uncle. Vernon approached him slowly with a strange and gleeful look as he eyed the boy. "Boy, Uncle's gonna teach you your place," he said in a dark tone.</p><p>That day, the boy's mind fractured from the unspeakable acts. His lesson: With beauty comes taint, the world is a dark place.</p>
