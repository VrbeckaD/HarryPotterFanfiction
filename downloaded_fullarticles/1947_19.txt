    <p>He was small when he noticed something odd. He could change the colors of things and make objects levitate by focusing on them. His mom seemed to jump for joy, babbling excitedly about him getting his quirk so early. The thing was...Izuku wasn’t so sure this was a quirk. When he asked people what their quirks felt like, he got answers that ranged from water and fire to a buzzing feeling or the like. This felt like multiple things at once and he couldn't really pinpoint what he was feeling. But, being the quiet child he was, he let his mother have this joy. The kind that brought a smile to her face. A smile that he hadn’t seen fully since his father disappeared a month after he was born. </p><p>It was just a couple months after his eleventh birthday that a knock was heard at their door. Inko went to it and opened it, carefully. Standing there was an elderly man, yet his posture told that he was quite able, despite his age. He had long, whitening, grey hair and twinkling blue eyes behind half moon glasses. His beard went to the end of his chest and he wore a set of ornate blue, silver, red, gold, bronze, black, and yellow robes. While seeming a tad gaudy, they looked nice on him. He gave a gentle smile, pinching the smile lines by his eyes. His voice was kind, patient, and understanding as he spoke.<br/>
“Pardon me, Ma’am, but is this the Midoriya household?” His speech held a heavy English and a tad Scottish accent.<br/>
“This is...May I ask who you are?” The man nodded.<br/>
“Ah...Here it is.” He reached into his sleeve and pulled out a roll of parchment, handing it to her, as he introduce himself.<br/>
“Dumbledore Albus. I’m headmaster of the school depicted in that letter. I assume your son has been exhibiting the ability to move things with his mind and change things, when, even, the quirks of now can’t seem to do that. All of those at once, I mean.” She read the top part of the scroll.<br/>
“Hogwarts...School of Witchcraft and...Wizardry?”<br/>
“Yes. Our mailing system for new first years wrote his name out and a date. This date. We weren’t able to come sooner, due to this time being far in the future from our own. I know this may sound like rubbish, but I assure you, it’s true.”<br/>
“The future?”<br/>
“Yes. This may sound cliche, but I’m from the year 1990.” Inko’s brows furrowed.<br/>
“That’s almost six hundred years ago…”</p><p>Albus nodded.<br/>
“As I said, I understand that it sounds like hogwash. I had a hard time believing the quill, when it said this year, but...The quill never lies.” She looked conflicted, but sighed.<br/>
“It can’t be too comfortable standing out in the hall. Come in. I’ll...I’ll make some tea.” He nodded and followed her inside, where he was directed to the sofa, while she slipped into the kitchen. As he waited, he took note that the home was a two bedroom one with eggshell walls. There were pictures of Inko and a little boy with her coloring, only with slightly darker hair and brighter eyes. There was no sign of a father. He noticed movement from the corner of his eyes and found said little boy peering from around the corner. He looked curious, his eyes seeming to gain a little touch of a glow to them, before it disappeared as fast as it came. He still didn’t come forwards, trepidation in his eyes. It was odd, seeing as the boy was no older than a first year. Inko came back and noticed him.<br/>
“Oh. Are you finished with your homework, Izuku?” Silently, he nodded and fidgeted with the hem of his shirt. Albus looked up at her again.<br/>
“I...apologize if I come of as rude, but...Your husband...Was his name Midoriya Hisashi?” She jolted a bit.<br/>
“Uh...Ah, yes...He went missing eleven years ago...I think he...I think he died…” The elder grimaced a little.<br/>
“Now I can see why your son exhibits such strong magical prowess...Midoriya-san, Hisashi could wield magic alongside his quirk. He worked as an Auror in my time...and was killed ten years ago in the name of justice.” Deep green eyes stared at him with a mix of emotions in them, before her son tugged at her apron.<br/>
“Hm?” In an extremely quiet voice, Izuku spoke.<br/>
“He’s telling the truth.” Her eyes flickered, before Albus tipped his head.<br/>
“How did you know?” Izuku seemed a little nervous about projecting his voice.<br/>
“I...I could see it in your mind…I’m sorry...It’s supposed to be private, but I couldn’t help it…”</p><p>Albus gave a grandfatherly smile.<br/>
“It’s quite alright. I just wish to know how you got past my barriers.” The boy looked surprised.<br/>
“Others can do it too?”<br/>
“Yes.”<br/>
“I...I was able to find an area where the edge could be pushed out and I could squeeze by the side of the maze…” There was awe in those blue eyes.<br/>
“Impressive. Not many people think about it like that.”<br/>
“Dumbledore-san?” He smiled again.<br/>
“Young Izuku, here, seems to be a natural Legilimens. Which is the ability to see into someone else’s mind. Izuku-san, may I see if you’re a natural occlumens, as well?” There was a flash in those supernatural green eyes, before he nodded. Albus waved his hand.<br/>
“Legilimens.” He was projected into the boy’s mind, but, instead of just hitting a wall, he was met with hedges. A maze. This wasn’t like most mental mazes, though. There were torches all around and there were sounds everywhere, instead of just at memories. They were meant to distract. He started, when he heard an explosion and a brand new voice swearing up a storm. It made him, even in his age, to go a little pink in the face. Who had such a vulgar nature and drive to use that kind of language in a child’s vicinity? He backed out of the boy’s mind, having briefly noticed that it was night and there were stars in the sky.</p><p>He nodded.<br/>
“While you aren't a natural Occlumens, you have a very sound structure to your barriers. Midoriya-san, this means that other Legilimens will have an extremely hard time rifling through his thoughts and memories.” Izuku scratched at his head.<br/>
“I could feel you walking around...it was weird…” Inko blinked and looked at the parchment she’d grabbed from the table on the way back.<br/>
“What would he do at this school?”<br/>
“He would be learned to use his magic and hone it. There are other subjects that he will be taking, along with electives he finds an interest in. Some of these include, Transfiguration, Potions, Runes, Defense Against The Dark Arts, Charms, and more. Each year has different difficulty levels and their own dorms.”<br/>
“Dorms?”<br/>
“That’s right, students stay at the school for their tutoring. There are many holidays and breaks in which they go home. But, for you, this would be less time. Since Hogwarts no longer stands, having been destroyed a little over fifty years ago, he would need to slip back in time to attend. The way we would do this, is to have an artifact on his person. Much like this one I have.” He reached into the front of his robes, pulling out a pendant made out of an opal, attached to a leather cord by a golden clasp and backing.<br/>
“This pendant lets me port between a certain time and my own, which has been charmed into it by a professional. There will be a bit of a delay on the return, though. The least offset would be six hours and the most would be a couple days. If he were to attend, he would age as normal for the, just short of a, year he attends, but, as he returns, he will revert back to the age he is in his own time, which is now. This will allow him to return to the school each year, as he will be given a new pendant each time he returns home, so that he can come back for his next year level.” </p><p>Inko nodded in understanding.<br/>
“How many years would his schooling be?”<br/>
“Seven. From age eleven to seventeen or eighteen.”<br/>
“So...It’s possible for him to have mentally aged seven years more by the time he enters high school?”<br/>
“If he decides to come back for another year at frequent intervals, yes. I would recommend at least a month of rest time between years. He could continue going to school here during his recovery time, if he so wishes.” Inko took a deep breath.<br/>
“Izuku?” The boy had been quiet, stuck in deep thought. At his mother’s questioning tone, he met her eyes.<br/>
“I...think I should go. I think it would be best to help me control my abilities and...I think it would be best for my social life, as well, since I don’t have friends here.” Albus thought that that was a crying shame. Everyone should be rushing to be friends with this boy. He was smart and mature for his age. Inko sighed.<br/>
“If you want to go, then I’ll let you. Since the longest you’d be gone in this time would be two days...I think things will be fine. Maybe you can teach me some of the non-magical things you learn.” Albus smiled softly at her joking tone near the end.<br/>
“I think that I can take him now to get him fitted for a pendant and one of the teachers can take him to get his supplies. We will bring him back and he can decide when to come for first year.” Both greenettes nodded and Albus stood, holding his hand out to the boy. When they touched, Albus’ fingers were slightly gnarled with age and the start of arthritis, but Izuku’s weren’t the smooth ones the wizard expected. They were riddled with calluses and scars. He said nothing about it at the moment and the gemstone began glowing. Then, they were gone.</p><p>They reappeared inside an office that was heavily decorated and seemed cozy. There was a bird made of fire sat inside a cage, napping. As soon as Dumbledore stepped to his desk, it awoke, flapping its wings a little, before settling down and leveling Izuku with a stare. It wasn’t one of irritation or mistrust, he could tell. It was sadness. Without really thinking about it, the boy stepped a little closer, cautious not to startle the bird. His voice was soft, as he addressed it.<br/>
“Why are you sad?” Dumbledore didn’t say a word, watching the interaction between bird and boy. The bird bowed its head, beckoning him closer. It touched its forehead to Izuku’s and the boy started, feeling the bird fly through his mind. It was over in a second and it shook its feathers for a moment, letting out a small trill and brushing its face against Izuku’s. Dumbledore gave a soft chuckle.<br/>
“It seems he likes you.”<br/>
“He?”<br/>
“That’s Fawkes, a phoenix. He doesn’t instantly like people, so this is surprising…” The phoenix gave a squawk, which the man seemed to have an idea what it meant.<br/>
“What?” Fawkes butted his head against Izuku’s chest and rose his wings, creating a heart of fire.<br/>
“A pure heart?” He nodded and nudged his head under the greenette’s palm. The boy looked confused, but, gently ran his fingers over the bird’s crest. The look of peace on his face made a smile come to Izuku’s face.</p><p>Albus seemed to remember something and reached into a drawer.<br/>
“I have something that will allow you to understand and speak in English, so you won’t need a translator. There’s a couple options, but it needs to be around your head area. There’s a necklace, earring, and a hairclip.”<br/>
“Um...I’d like the earring...Mom let me get a helix piercing.” The headmaster set a single, black, ring piercing, that was about a centimeter thick, in Izuku’s hand and nodded, letting him know he could put it on. The boy did so with practiced ease and, after a moment, Albus spoke in English.<br/>
“Can you understand me?” Green eyes went wide, as he nodded and opened his mouth. His words were changed, as they left it.<br/>
“Yes. I can…-!”<br/>
“It seems it’s working just fine, then. Another question, before you’re taken to get your supplies. For the time port key, would you like a necklace or another accessory?” The preteen took a moment to think, before putting a hand to his neck.<br/>
“May I ask for a choker?” The wizard tilted his head, before nodding with a smile.<br/>
“Of course. As for your school supplies...You may come in, now.” The door opened and a man, standing at six feet approximately, stepped in. He had straight ebony hair that came to his chin, ebony eyes with tired rings under them, pale and sallow skin, and a slightly crooked nose, as if it had been broken many times in his, apparently, short life.<br/>
“Izuku Midoriya, this is our Potions Master and teacher, Severus Snape.”</p>
