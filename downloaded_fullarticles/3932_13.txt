    <p>"Love?" Harry's mate called softly and placed a hand on Harry's shoulder. "We're here." The male said softly and gave his mate a loving smile. </p><p>   Jumping slightly, Harry opened his eyes and looked up into the baby blues of one of his mates. "Sorry Freddie, I didn't even realize that I fell asleep. Where's George? What about daddy and papa?" He asked and unbuckled his seat belt and slowly slid out of the Jeep that his papa bought.</p><p>   Fred took his mate's hand and helped him out of the SUV, grinning as Harry laced their fingers. "Went inside the house to help Remus and Sirius make sure that everything got here. I know that it did, the goblins helped us with this." </p><p>   Harry leaned against his tall mate and smiled happily. He never imagined that he would be the mate of the Weasley twins. The two boys changed so much since their inheritance. Both boys shot up to 6'6 and put on a massive amount of muscle. They also got much more possessive and protective. Also, a bit jealous when others even looked at Harry. Even before their came into their creature inheritance, both boys always kept an eye out for him. Besides his dads, they were the only ones he felt comfortable touching. Harry saw the twins the day after their birthday and it was as if he had finally come home. </p><p>   He glanced up at his gorgeous mate and thought back to that day when he came to the Burrow...</p><p> Harry stumbled out of the floo and flashed a grin at his papa. "Sorry. You'd think that I would get used to that by now." He teased and brushed off the soot and straightened his robes. </p><p>   Remus laughed and wrapped his arm around his son's shoulders. "I'll always be there to catch you, pup." He said and walked into the kitchen, greeting Molly. </p><p>   Harry chuckled and rolled his eyes at his fathers words. His parents were always there for him. He did not know what he would do without them. He also couldn't do without his twins.</p><p>    Wait... His twins? What the bloody fuck? Since when did he see those two as his? Well... Maybe it was when-</p><p>Suddenly, he was grabbed from behind and arms were wrapped around his chest and all he could hear was snarling. Then he felt something press against his chest, something very hard and warm. </p><p>   "Mine." The hard, solid, warm body growled against the back of his head said. </p><p>   "Mine."  Snarled the cozy body to his front. </p><p>   "Ours." Both of the very tall men said. </p><p>   Hold on, he knew these two. He's known both of the growling and snarling against his body. He looked up and let out a low moan. Holy shit, it was Fred and George Weasley. But they were both very tall. And very muscular. Also, drop dead gorgeous. Their red hair had grown down to their shoulders and looked a lot like their brother Bill's hair. Their features also changed, they sharpened and became more defined. </p><p>   "You're ours." Fred hissed and leaned down, his arms wrapped tightly around their little ones waist and he picked him up and made sure that their mate was firmly pressed against the both of them. </p><p>   "Yours." Harry mumbled and blushed deeply. He pressed his face against George's chest, hiding his embarrassment. "I promise. Always yours. The both of yours." He whispered, trying to calm down the two snarling twins. </p><p>   Harry finally felt as if pieces of himself had come together.</p><p> </p><p>*********************************</p><p> </p><p>  "Harrikins?" George called out from the porch. He could see how tired he was from the long journey. George walked down to where his mate and twin were and wrapped an arm around his shoulder. </p><p>   Harry looked up at his other mate and grinned wide. He nuzzled into him as they walked up into the house. He only saw pictures of the house, never seeing it in person. It was large and spacious, much larger than Draco Malfoy's manor. The house was a tan color and had brick around it, too. Their home was 5 stories tall and also had a basement for brewing and keeping potions in. In the foyer, there was a very wide staircase that led to the second floor, then another set of stairs after that, until the stairs went up into the fifth floor. It fit perfectly for all of them. The rooms were painted in soft neutral colors. Calming colors. They needed all the peace and quiet that they could get. </p><p>   "Come on, love, lets go and check out our wing of the house and go to our room.  I think Dobby and Winky put all of our things away. Remus and Sirius are in their room, making sure everything is all set." Fred said and took Harry's hand and led them to their room. </p><p>   Harry gasped when he looked around their wing. There was a long, wide stair case that led up to the second floor of their home inside of the family house.  </p><p>   The hallway led to a large living room that had dark brown leather furniture. There was also a huge flat screen tv that hung on the wall in front of the fireplace. As Harry looked around, he knew that there was a small library for him to relax in. They made sure that it was stocked with all of his favorite books. He knew that in one of these rooms, they had a room for Fred and George to come up with new ideas. Though, they also had a room in the basement to test their inventions. It was warded to make sure that if something did explode, it wouldn't take the house with it or damage any of the other rooms. </p><p>   "It's the last one, love." Fred called out, he knew that his sweet, adorable, sexy little mate was feeling very overwhelmed. He hated when Harry felt like it was too much for him, when he felt like he didn't deserve it. Harry had gotten a lot better, though. It didn't happen that often. The last time he knew that Harry felt like that was when they found out that they were mates. </p><p>   Harry went to the last door in the long hallway that was off towards the window in the living room. The hallway was open and had windows all along it, just so you can look outside. In the living room, it was a wide, open space and they could sit in on their couches and look outside. He couldn't wait until the winter so he could watch the snow fall.  Once he opened up the door to their bedroom, he gasped softly. They had stairs in their bedroom! Harry couldn't believe it. Their bedroom even had a sitting room. There was a long, brown leather couch and a matching love seat by the windows. The boy grinned when he saw a dark brown, clothed rocking chair for him. He even had one in their living room. He climbed the stairs up to an open bedroom with a bed that was the largest bed that he had ever seen. It could easily fit  7 to 8 people on it. The bed spread was light and dark grey colors and it had many, many, many pillows on it. Harry did love pillows. He loved burrowing himself in all of the blankets, sheets, and pillows when his mates went off to work at WWW. </p><p>   After he finished up exploring their quarters, he went back to his mates. He still couldn't believe that he was mated to magical twins. They were the sweetest people that he knew. Well, to him anyways. They always take care of him and make sure that he's doing okay. He was very lucky. He walked up to George and wrapped his arms around his love's waist. </p><p>   "Hi." He murmured and buried his face in the center of George's chest and inhaled deeply. He smelled like a rain forest. He could feel George chuckling as he purred a little. Harry grinned and looked up at his very tall mate and pouted. He wanted kisses. Lots and lots of kisses. </p><p>   George smiled and leaned down, capturing Harry's lips. He kissed his beautiful mate deeply, savoring his taste and smell, he loved how soft his little mate was. "How do you like it? Freddie and I love how when you go up the stairs, the bedroom is very open. I love living with your parents, love, but it's nice that we have our own apartment inside the house. Remus and Sirius do, too." He said and ran his fingers through Harry's short, styled hair. </p><p>   "I love it! I love that there is a rocking chair in there, just for me." Harry cooed and snuggled closer to his big, strong, tall, wonderful mate. </p><p>   Fred grinned and stepped behind their little one and pressed his chest into Harry's back, humming quietly. "We have rocking chairs in every sitting room here. We want you always to be comfortable." </p><p>   "Love you, Fred. Love you, George." Harry cooed and leaned into both his mates. </p><p>   "Love you, too, precious." Fred said and kissed the back of Harry's head, closing his eyes. </p><p>   "Love you also, sweetheart." George said and reached out, grabbing onto his brothers side, making sure that all three of them were touching. </p><p> </p><p>********************************************************************************</p><p>   The day had been long but it was a good day. Harry had been registered at Forks High School and he would be starting in a few day. He would also be finishing his magical education. He was so ready to be done and over with all the education. He wanted to talk to his dads, hopefully he would be able to finish up school early. At the muggle school, he was in his junior year, but he wanted to be put in the senior year. His parents didn't think that was a good idea because of how small Harry was. </p><p>   They spent the day getting used to the house and he even went exploring the surrounding area. His mates wanted him to go into town and look around but Harry wanted to wait and go with someone. He honestly didn't care what the townsfolk thought about his mates. They could keep their comments to themselves. That was honestly one of the things that Harry didn't like about muggles and muggleborn. They didn't understand soul mates and they didn't get magical twins. Not his problem anymore. </p><p>   "Pup, we're home." Sirius called out from the foyer. </p><p>   "In here, papa." Harry said from the small sitting room that was closest to the front door/foyer. </p><p>   "Whotcha doing in here by yourself?" Sirius asked and went over to the couch that Harry was laying on. He lifted up his son's feet and sat down, laying the boys feet on his lap.</p><p>   "George and Fred are checking out a spot to open another store. I didn't feel like going with them. School starts in a few days so I figured that I would just hangout here while everyone is out." Harry shrugged and slipped his feet off of his papa's lap and slipped his toes under Sirius' warm thigh. "Ahh, feels so nice." </p><p>   Sirius just rolled his eyes and let Harry keep his feet where they were. "Are you nervous? You know, if you change your mind, we can pull you from school.  You don't need to go to school. We just thought that this would help you make friends." </p><p>   Harry frowned and looked at his father the shrugged. "I don't need friends. I have you and daddy, I also have my mates. That's enough for me." </p><p>   Sirius was about to interrupt when Harry just sighed and sat up a little more. "Don't worry, I'll go and I'll test it out. I know that you all want me to make some friends. The twins don't want me working at their shop, they said that they wouldn't have their mate working." He rolled his eyes and laid his head back down. "I'm still trying to convince them that I'd be fine, that I'd have fun working there and that I don't even want them to pay me, which you know they would. And I know everything about their products. But like Fred said, he just doesn't want me working when I don't have to. Hopefully they will revisit this once I turn 18."</p><p>   "Pup, I understand what they're saying. I don't even want Remus to work but he wants to. He wants to work at a little book store." He turned more towards Harry and smiled at him. "You're only 16. Sure, you're one of the top 5 richest people in the world, wizarding and muggle worlds, plus you're married, but your mates and your dad and I want to keep you from being an adult right now. Let daddy and I, let George and Fred take care of being an adult. Let us take care of you." He grabbed his son's ankle and gave it a gentle, loving squeeze. </p><p>   "I know, I know. It's just hard. I also hate being so rich. I help a lot of people with the money, sure, but it makes people who aren't in our world know my name." </p><p>   "You sure don't hate that big arse engagement ring or the diamond filled wedding bands that the twins gave you, pup." Sirius teased and flashed a grin.</p><p>   Harry smiled to himself and looked at his wedding rings. The engagement ring that the twins bought was gorgeous. It was a 16 caret tear drop diamond ring and his wedding bands, two of them, had diamonds wrapping around the whole band, 2 carets for each diamond wrapping around his finger. The twins were very proud that they were able to get their husband such an extravagant engagement and wedding bands. It was the only jewelry that Harry really wore that cost a lot of money. "I love them. George is wanting to get an even bigger diamond for the tear drop. I think it's perfect as it is but if he wants to get bigger, I won't be telling him no. You know how I am. I don't like the attention." </p><p>   "I know, I know. And for a heads up, I think you'll be getting an even bigger ring. They made a killing in Diagon Alley and they're going to want to show off. I mean, they have the cars that they have always wanted, they have the newest broom, they have everything that they've always wanted and now they just want to spoil you." Sirius said softly.</p><p>   "I get it, I do. That's why I don't say anything when they get something for me, that's well, really expensive. I just wonder what people are going to say at school, about my rings, about my marriage and the fact that I'm married to identical twin boys. But I guess, it doesn't matter, people can bloody suck it." </p><p>   Sirius let out a loud laugh and leaned over to ruffle Harry's short hair. "That they can, pup, that they can." </p><p> </p><p>**************************************************************************</p><p> </p><p>   Harry walked out of their bathroom and climbed into bed with his boys, slipping between them. George reached out and wrapped his arm around Harry's shoulders and brought him down to lay against him. </p><p>   "Tired, love?" Fred asked from the other side of Harry and he scooted over, making sure that his husband as snug against both of them. </p><p>   "It was good. Papa and I talked a lot this afternoon then we went to the store so I could get stuff to make tomorrow for dinner. I'm going to make something in the crockpot. Pork, I think. I bought a few things to make for our lunches. I know how you two love taking food that I made for lunch to work." Harry laid his head against George's chest and closed his eyes before he reached back and grabbed</p>
