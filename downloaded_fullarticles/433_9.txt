  <em>1996. New York City. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>His face is on the news again. Unsmiling, a little wild-eyed in the flashbulb burst. Awkward bowl cut, split lip. A red bar beneath his chin reads: "106 MINORS SEIZED FROM STATEN ISLAND RELIGIOUS COMPOUND...."</p><p>Credence is not technically a minor. Technically, according to the documents folded in a manila envelope on Tina's kitchen counter, he was supposed to have turned twenty-four in November. A minor technicality. The news channels and "Breaking!" articles have begun tacking on new adjectives to explain it. Bylines like "Adult child of Staten Island religious compound...." and "106 children deemed at risk, including several adults" nestle themselves into rows of text beneath the startled flashbulb snapshot of Credence on the field outside Main Chapel.</p><p>None of it makes any sense, but then, Tina says there are machines that can generate cash money from inside brick walls and there is the woman on the news who also claims she is marrying a ghost, so he supposes nothing makes sense anymore.</p><p>As he watches, the photo of Credence slides back into a little rectangle over the shoulder of an unsmiling blond woman. Though she often frightens him, Seraphina Picquery is the only newscaster Credence can watch without feeling his stomach clench in guilt. There is the fact, after all, that she covers her hair as women should. Her sleek black hair wrap is not the same as the plain cloth kerchiefs and bonnets worn by Ma and his sister Chastity and all of the others at home, but a hair covering is a hair covering, and in this world of "ATMs" and ghost intercourse, he'll take what he can get.</p><p>"Thank you, Percival," Seraphina says, and Credence shivers. Percival Graves, the other reason he watches WNET (and for which he will definitely be damned to the Eternal Fire) instead of FOX, or cartoons, or nothing, nods and frowns at something off-camera.</p><p>His thick eyebrows look like horsehair brushes on his face, Credence thinks. He rubs his palm prophylactically, staring into the screen.</p><p>"As of now, twelve adults have been arraigned on charges of child abuse, abduction, contributing to the delinquency of a minor...."</p><p>The photo of Credence is replaced by another. In front of Main Chapel, one arm around his sister Chastity's thin shoulder, the other around a smaller body with a blurred face, her hair tightly bound in a roughcloth Puritan cap, scrubbed skin and blue eyes shining as she smiles serenely into the camera. Credence, who has only just begun to accustom himself to a world without that face watching him from every corner of every room, turns off the TV with a click of the remote, the way Queenie showed him.</p><p>A sick little corner of his soul enjoys turning the lights off on Ma. He flicks the screen back on experimentally. Seraphina Picquery drops the name "Barebone" from her tongue like a bad taste. The blurred face in the photo, Credence knows, is his other sister, Modesty. Ma had kept the same photo in a simple wooden frame on the wall outside their shared bathroom, Chastity in her cloth cap like their mother's, her frantic believer's grin and flashbulb eyes, Modesty sulking beneath the arm that had just given her brother a red stripe across the palm of his hand for dropping the camera. He turns the TV off again. <em>Good night, Ma. May the Lord keep you.</em></p><p>Down the hall, in the Goldsteins’ cramped kitchen, Queenie is humming along to something loud and clang-y on the radio that Credence could not have recognized if his life depended on it. He shuffles after the foreign sounds, cracking his neck, trailing his fingers absently along the uneven plaster walls.</p><p>"You're up late," she greets him without looking up from the mixing bowl in her hand. "You want a snack?"</p><p>Taking his noncommittal grunt for an answer, she rifles through the cabinets, lobs a diet bar at his head.</p><p>"Spidey senses," says Queenie brightly as he catches it. "You should play baseball or something. Get you out of the house, stop watching all that awful news."</p><p>"They're indicting my mother," he supplies quietly. A strip of plastic catches on the corner of the bar as he shrugs it from its wrapper. "Her and most of the rest of them."</p><p>"Aw, well, we knew they would, right? Tina's been running through all that stuff she had on them from before. Would you believe it - fired her for getting the story, and now they're offering her salaries and benefits and airtime for the hot take. Sit down, honey. You look pale. You want some cocoa?"</p><p>Whether or not he wants cocoa is probably irrelevant, Credence thinks. When Queenie offers, she wants to give. He nods, despite the dryness in his throat, and takes a tentative bite of the diet bar.</p><p>Everything is too sweet here.<br/>
Everything is covered in chocolate, doused in sugar, or frying fat, or butter. Piled onto plates too large to be sensible. Gluttonous. He wants to enjoy it, if only because everyone else seems to, and everyone else - Queenie, Tina, Queenie's boyfriend Jacob and Tina's odd friend Newt - have been kinder than Credence could have hoped anyone would be when he climbed into the back of the floodlit police van on the muddy field in front of Main Chapel on Christmas Eve.</p><p>He would have been satisfied with a cot in a shelter, a street corner and a cardboard box. He had been prepared to fall directly into dens of sin, as Ma had always warned and predicted, needles in his arms, sodomy in back alleys, civil war, venereal disease, mental breakdowns - the whole package. Life in Exile, Deluxe Edition.<br/>
He's probably been watching too many movies.</p><p>"Hey, sugar - ” Queenie is waving a cup in front of his nose, mouth scrunched into one of her big smiles. "I said, we're out of cocoa. You want some warm milk and honey, instead?"</p><p>"Okay."</p><p>He does not say that warm milk sounds disgusting, or that his stomach is already in knots from the dangerous combination of Percival Graves' thick eyebrows and soft frown and his mother's righteous grin packed onto the same twenty inch screen. Queenie offered, so he takes the cup from her in two hands and gives her his best approximation of a grateful smile.</p><p>"We gotta work on that one, honey," she says. "Make it reach your eyes. Anyway, you sure you're okay?"</p><p>A woman on the news is having sexual intercourse with ghosts and my mother might be going to federal prison, Credence thinks. There was a time, only weeks ago, when "okay" meant a full night's sleep on a full stomach and a quiet morning reading his favourite Psalms to Modesty while Ma ignored him. Even if it does taste like it came straight from the udders of a diabetic cow, warm milk and honey in the Goldsteins' kitchen is surely an improvement.</p><p>"I'm very, very well," he promises.</p><p>Queenie sighs but lets it drop as he raises the cup of milk to his lips.</p><p>"Your face looks better. You had a real shiner there for a while, but it's fading. I bet it'll be gone in another week, and no one'll know the difference."</p><p>"Mhm," Credence agrees.</p><p>They both know he has not looked at his cheek yet. Not since the back of the police van, the assault rifles in his face, the shot of him with his little kid's haircut plastered to his forehead, soaked and shivering in the December rain, clutching the Bible with the false back that held all of Ma's secret documents. Everything he'd tried and failed to get to Tina before.</p><p>The photo and the news headlines and the phone calls from excited journalists and the DA's office have given them no rest since. Still, Tina has her job back now, and Credence is free.</p><p>"Maybe we can go get some coffee tomorrow, me and you," Queenie tries. "We could visit Teenie at work. I think she'd like that."</p><p>Credence gets the feeling she's been sitting on this one all day, waiting for the right moment to spring it on him.</p><p>"Okay," he lies.</p><p>Sensing his reluctance, Queenie slides another energy bar across the counter and says gently, in the honey-bright way she has, "It's all up to you, Credence. I ain't gonna force you out the door before you're ready, but Teenie'd love to see you at work, and we can swing by Jacob's place after. It's real close."</p><p>"That sounds good."</p><p>"Great." She flashes him a smile like a sun flare, and Credence's heart sinks ever so slightly in his chest for the lie. About an inch. He closes his eyes, swallows, tugs it back into place. It's important that he leave the house. Everyone thinks so.</p><p>"I'm just tired," he lies again, dropping his hand from the counter, but Queenie is already bent back over the mixing bowl. With her back to him, she hums a sweet 'good night' and kicks the radio on.</p><p>His bed in the Goldstein's apartment is a fold-out sofa in the living room. Queenie had set it out for him already on the first night, fresh flannel sheets and a set of pyjamas with the price sticker peeled off the tag, apologetic and nervous despite Credence's many assurances that a sofa was more than fine. Worlds better than he had ever expected, a vast improvement on the bottom bunk in a room of forty that he had occupied in Community House on Staten Island, or the closet-sized room with the portable cot in the back of the little church in downtown Manhattan where Ma had had them doing weekend ministry for as long as he can remember.</p><p>Her eyes had widened in alarm, and then, before he could stop her, she had hugged him. A complete stranger, with uncovered hair. He's stopped making those kinds of assurances since.</p><p>He takes his pyjamas with him into the bathroom, blinking in the flood of yellow light. The bathroom mirror is an obvious inconvenience, irremovable. For the most part, he can avoid it by showering in the dark at night, when no one will walk by and flick on the switch.</p><p>Queenie wants to go out in the morning. To the newsroom. To the bakery. On public streets. In the newsroom, with Seraphina Picquery and Percival Graves. Unbidden, Graves' dark eyes and thick brows swim across the aerial fuzz of his mind, drawing blood to his<em> thing</em>.</p><p>He presses the heel of his palm into his crotch, steeling himself, and looks.</p><p>Ma has etched herself in a net of fine scars, silvery and purple threads, across Credence's cheek and jaw. He runs a finger over them the way he's seen Queenie poking her finger into a pot on the stove, gauging. Not so bad. They'll all fade eventually, itch in winter when the air is dry.</p><p>His fingers stop and pull away jerkily. The bruise across his cheek, the sole spectacular product of the two-by-four she had swung at him as he ran for the front door, is faded down to a sickly green stain the size of a fist, ringed like an iris in deeper purple. It could be worse. He's had worse. Tina and Queenie and Newt and Jacob saw it worse. The first pictures he had let Tina take in the summer, before she lost her job, when the idea of leaving New Salem had felt as distant and unlikely as a romance with Christ himself; those had been worse.</p><p>He wonders if Percival Graves has seen those pictures. Conditioned for panic, his body freezes, but Credence maintains his stance in front of the mirror. Did Tina show him, show the entire crew when she wanted to break her big story? His brain feels like it's been hurled through the bathroom window, down ten flights, a rush of wind over raw nerves, and it strikes Credence again, as it has so many times over the past two weeks, how quickly life is moving underfoot.</p><p>Rubbing the goose pimples from his arm, he peels himself from the mirror at last and climbs into the cold shower.</p><p> </p><p>Sleep is blessedly dreamless. A coma. He almost rolls over into his pillow as sunlight breaks in slowly through the cracked living room blinds, groaning and lost in the orange glow behind his eyelids, the sweetness of his own breath on his tongue. Sunlight like soft whispers over the little hairs of his arms, prickling in his bruised cheek, sticky between his legs -</p><p>Credence sits up with a jolt. Blinking sleep from his eyes, he glances across the empty room. His heart feels throttled by its own frantic pounding as he bolts for the bathroom to lock the door.</p><p>He strips quickly and stuffs his underwear deep into the bathroom trashcan. Turns on the sink, mumbling, "Holy Lord, I've sinned times without number, and been guilty of pride and unbelief, of failure to find Your Mind in Your Word, of neglect to seek You in my daily life...."</p><p>His <em>thing</em> twitches feebly in his palm as he scrubs.</p><p>"...I thank You that many of my prayers have been refused. I have asked amiss and do not have, have prayed from lusts and been rejected. I have asked for Egypt and been given a wilderness...."</p><p>A knock on the door sends him careening into the shower.</p><p>"Credence?" Queenie's sweet voice on the other side is soft. "You okay, honey? You want some breakfast? I'm makin' pancakes."</p><p>"Okay!" he calls back, his voice strangled by the knot in his throat. His fingers scramble for the shower faucet.</p><p>"Great!"</p><p>Please go, Credence thinks.</p><p>"You want coffee?"</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>What is it with people knocking on doors, always lingering? Ma never knocked, never lingered. Ma would have rolled the stone out from in front of his tomb if she thought he'd been wicked even in death, demanding the belt off his dried corpse.</p><p>Sometimes, Credence isn't sure he really wants eternity.</p><p>"Okay, honey!" Queenie's voice fades; she must be walking back down the hall.</p><p>"I thank You for Your wisdom and Your love..." Credence jerks the faucet down, hardly believing his own boldness as the water runs hot, as his fingers close around the width of himself. "I - I -"</p><p>Whatever wickedness had driven him to this runs short of letting him pray as he sins. With his free arm swung over his face, eyes obscured behind the crook of his elbow, hand braced against the shower wall, he tugs at himself roughly. Just enough, just until his muscles begin to pinch all over, body convulsing. Once his heart is racing and it feels as though the pleasure might be too much, he knocks the faucet back to cold and stands still as the water courses over him in rivulets. He grits his teeth against the throbbing ache between his legs, the pressure built up like water in the hose in summer, when he would put his hand over the top, feel it surging against his torn skin before turning it on a shrieking Modesty.</p><p>Modesty. Chastity. Ma.</p><p>"I thank You for Your wisdom and your love - " Toweling off his red face, his eyes, his arms, " - for all the acts of discipline to which I am subject, for sometimes putting me into the furnace to refine my gold and remove my dross."</p><p>His voice picks up in speed as he dries his legs, avoiding the tender space between them.</p><p>"If You should give me choice to live in pleasure and keep my sins, or to have them burnt away with trial, give me sanctified affliction. Deliver me from every evil habit, every accretion of former sins, everything that dims the brightness of Your grace in me, everything that prevents me taking delight in You. Then I shall bless You, God of Jeshurun, for helping me to be upright."</p><p>Down the hall, from the depths of the kitchen, he hears Queenie singing along to the radio. Credence hangs his towel from the towel hook that Jacob had hammered into the wall for him alongside the rest of theirs. He slides his feet through the leg holes of his pyjama bottoms, snaps the waistband hard enough to draw a flinch from his coiled muscles.</p><p>An awful little voice in the back of his head thinks, <em>upright</em> indeed.</p><p>"And thank You," he says loudly. "Thank You, Lord. Amen."</p><p> </p><p>If Queenie suspects anything about his uncharacteristic morning shower, she isn’t letting on. Her hand on Credence’s elbow, she walks him down the street like a mother with a small child, guides him over crosswalks and through crowds, pointing and naming all the things he’s never had words for. <em>Scaffolding. Honda. Gallery. Papaya dog. Boombox. Soda. Nodding out.</em></p><p>“Nodding out?”</p><p>“It’s what he’s doing over there on that stoop,” Queenie says, frowning. “It’s the drugs. Heroin. Heartbreaking, ain’t it? But you should know things. Tina worries about you going out on your own ‘cause you’re so - well - you’re a sweetheart, sweetheart.”</p><p>There is more to that hanging unsaid off the edge of her tongue. Rather than elaborate, she takes him, blushing and hunching into the collar of his new jacket, to buy coffee from a corner deli.</p><p>“<em>Deli</em>,” Credence repeats dutifully.</p><p>“Didn’t you have delis on Staten Island?”</p><p>“No,” says Credence, and she leaves it at that, coaxes him into giving her his arm, which he does only after he’s checked all sides of the street in trepidation. No one is there, of course. All of the chaperones in their beards and black suits are back on an island he’s never seen, in a jail called Riker’s, awaiting trial. Queenie holds him gingerly, as though she’s afraid it’ll hurt.</p><p>She’s special like that, Credence thinks. Some things she just seems to know without needing to be told.</p><p>“Well,” she says at length, “I’m gonna take you to the deli on our block this week. You oughta get used to Chelsea so we can go out-out. We gotta get you away from that TV set before your eyes go square.”</p><p>"At least no one would recognize me."</p><p>Because she laughs, he lets himself smile. It’s a tiny thing, but it makes Queenie’s eyes narrow from the force of her own grin, and her laughter carries them like a buoy up the stretch of ninth avenue between the Goldsteins’ apartment on twenty-fourth street and the WNET station in a place called Hell’s Kitchen, which Queenie assures him has nothing to with religion.</p><p>“It’s kinda far, so we should take the subway,” she admits in undertone, “but I wanna show you around a little, too. Don’t tell Teenie. She wanted me to waste money on a cab.”</p><p>“Oh.”</p><p>The idea that anyone would like to waste their money on him is utterly foreign to Credence. Something about it endears them both to him more. Queenie and Tina, even Newt and Jacob. He wants to repay in kind, to be endearing and entertaining, but the skill of it feels miles beyond him.</p><p>Instead, he finds himself tucking his hand firmly through the loop of her arm, his lips parted in thought.</p><p>“I never really walked around like this,” he hears himself say. “Just - like this. In the street. For fun.”</p><p>“Oh, honey,” Queenie sighs. “Oh, kiddo.”</p><p>It takes them over an hour to reach the building where WNET is housed. Much of this is Queenie's doing. She insists they stop on nearly every corner so that she can teach him something - <em>trash collector, street dancer, dealer, cop, ConEd.</em> Her arm tightens around his, but Queenie only smiles, soft touches, and his heart steadies itself. She gets them hot dogs across from Penn Station, pointing:<em> Madison Square Garden. Cigar. Hockey. Tourists.</em></p><p>When she buys him a knit hat off a street vendor, Credence bites back his protests. He lets her style it on his head, sweeping his hair back from his forehead, hiding the blunt cut he's had his entire life by Ma's loveless hand.</p><p>"You could be a model with that jaw," Queenie says, and Credence is surprised to find himself laughing along with her.</p><p>Only once does he flinch, when she reaches out unexpectedly to fix a flyaway hair, and for a moment he sees a two-by-four, a cup of hot coffee, a wall of black rifle barrels, and ducks, stumbles. All the air goes out of their little balloon then. Her arm loosens, letting him pull into himself. Their feet kick up puddles as they cross the final intersection.</p><p>Credence doesn't look at her or the way her mouth quirks on one side, the way her left hand still hangs back as though it's waiting for him to reclaim it.</p><p>"You know," she sighs, "Teenie always worried about you, Credence. Ever since the summer. She used to talk about wanting to rent a car and bust you out."</p><p>Embarrassed, he shoves his own hands into the pockets of his jacket and nods into his chest, shoulders around his ears. He wants to say, <em>good</em>. A word like a jutted chin, all childish bravado, the kind of attitude that would have had him bowing beneath his own belt in Ma's house. Until the end.</p><p>"I wouldn't want Tina to worry about me."</p><p>"Tough luck, Chuck," Queenie laughs again, but the sound rings tinny in his cold ears. She stops suddenly in front of the revolving door and bites down on the side of her bottom lip. "It's gonna be busy in there, honey, so I just wanna say that it's okay if you wanna hold my arm again, or my hand. I don't mind."</p><p>Credence imagines himself, all however many feet and twenty-four years of him, in his new puffy coat that Newt had called an <em>anorak</em> and Credence himself privately considers <em>overkill</em>, another of Queenie's new words. He sees the two of them walking into the building, his hand in Queenie's, trailing after her like an overgrown toddler while Percival Graves frowns at them from in front of the camera. The thought of it clenches his stomach.</p><p>"Okay."</p><p>"Well, try not to look so glum about it," Queenie jokes. It's too close to the truth and falls flat between them. She takes his hand again.</p><p>"Queenie,” Credence says earnestly, “I’m really sorry.”</p><p>A little squeeze.</p><p>“Really, there ain’t nothing for you to be sorry about, Credence. I was only kidding you, honey, I don’t mind. I know it’s all so new for you.”</p><p>“I don’t know - I don’t know how to do any of this,” he insists, and suddenly the words are on his tongue, urgent. The floodwater, fingers in the hose. “I don’t know how to talk to people like this. And your - you don’t cover your hair. You got me a <i>jacket</i>.... I can’t tell if everyone’s really happy to have to be - to be spending so much time on me, or if -”</p><p>“I ain’t gonna turn on you, okay?” There is a fierceness in Queenie’s face, a hardening of her pretty nose, around her eyes, that is almost alarming in its intensity. Like the TV clicking off from the remote, Credence ducks despite himself, pulls his shoulders in.</p><p>“We can take a second, Credence.” Sighing. All the hard edges shaved off her voice, Queenie squeezes his hand again in hers. “I’m sorry. I’m sorry, honey. That wasn’t for you. I don’t know what I’m doing either, you know? But we all gotta look out for each other. Hey - Credence, it’s okay. Look, before you, it was just me and Tina and Jacob and sometimes Newt in the whole world. That was it. I told you, Teenie’s been real worried about you. We all have. You’re like a cousin or something now, you know - one of the family.”</p><p>“Fine,” says Credence quietly, staring into the sidewalk. Shallow breaths, in through the nose, out through the mouth. The way they’d shown him in the police van, with the paper bag, as he’d pried his frozen fingers from the cover of Ma’s book and begged them to take it.</p><p>“Ready?”</p><p>“Not really.”</p><p>“Wanna go home?”</p><p><i>Yes. All the time. Forever.</i> He shakes his head.</p><p>“Wanna go see how they make the news?”</p><p>Credence nods, lip between his teeth, the slightest quirk of his mouth. Tentative. An offering.</p><p>“Well, I know how to make news.”</p><p>Queenie’s laugh, as they clack their way across the marble floors to the elevators, is like prayer, like relief.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>
