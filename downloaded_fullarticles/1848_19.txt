    <p>The owl tapped lightly at the kitchen window and raised its leg to show Draco that the mail it was delivering was indeed something he wanted. On several occasions disgruntled owls bearing what was clearly hate mail and parcels spelled to explode upon opening were left outside and completely ignored by the owner of the house. Draco figured that if the postal service wasn't going to do their job in screening dangerous artefacts he wasn't going to make their job any easier. He did start to leave water and dry treats out for the owls. It was not their fault, and Draco didn't exactly have many visitors outside of his mother and the feathered post workers. </p><p>He opened the window with a flick of his wand and dropped the required sum into the owl's pouch. Once he had detached the newspaper from its leg the owl hooted in farewell and flew off. </p><p>Draco closed the window and drew up his wards again before resuming his breakfast. He spread the newspaper flat on his counter as his tea service hovered near the door that led to the dining hall, a permanently locked door blocking its way. Ever since his father's funeral, and frankly ever since the Ministry released his family under caution into a safe house in Scotland, he hadn't set foot in the Mansion. Let alone open any of the doors that he came to dread passing at the time of the Second Wizarding War. </p><p>But over the past week his mother had been nagging him to prepare the mansion's contents for sale and clear all of its rooms of residual dark magic. She was still using the grieving widow excuse to stay away from Malfoy Manor, even though both she and Draco knew there was nothing and no one to mourn. Lucius hadn't been himself for years before his death and it was a relief more than anything to finally move past the darkness that took over what once was his father.</p><p>The tea tray impatiently nudged the locked door again, causing its contents to clang together. Draco shook off his thoughts and spelled it back onto the kitchen table next to the remains of his honey and toast. In the aftermath of the trials there was no question of having house elves around the family and he and his mother managed to perform most domestic tasks. Not too badly either. Draco was still not particularly skilled when it came to feeding himself with things that he had to make from scratch without the use of his wand. But the wand hadn't been working as well for him and it was just easier to make his own darn toast than to have jams spread all over the counter and kitchen walls in the process.</p><p>Leaning his hip against the counter he blew the steam from his cup of tea as he skimmed the front page of the newspaper. Quidditch news, the engagement of some war hero or another, a recipe for marigold madeleines at the bottom of the page. He flipped to the next section and was about to move onto the advancements in potions rubric when a photo caught his eye. It was a view from the back of a young man as he was hurriedly walking up the stairs of the Leaky Cauldron. His travel cloak was tossed carelessly over his shoulder and his boots were caked with what looked like swamp muck, but it was the hair that made Draco stop in his tracks. The mess of black unruly locks and tufts was hard to miss. As was the caption "Auror In Training And War Hero Potter: Missing Or Dead?" </p><p>"What the..."</p><p>The subtitle of the article elaborated that Potter had been missing for months and hadn't been seen or heard of since he got back from an Auror Bootcamp and was resting at the Leaky. Anyone with information was asked to come forward. What came after was a mix of friends' pleas and the Ministry's own comments about how promising "Young Potter" was. Draco skipped over that information completely. </p><p>Potter. Missing. Presumed dead. From what? Delayed <em>swamp creature</em> venom? He scoffed and pushed the newspaper away before pulling it back towards him. The article being relegated to second page only meant that the wizarding world was not as involved with this particular story anymore. So much for Potter's adoring fans. Draco took a sip of his now drinkable tea and frowned. Somehow with his father's funeral and the release of their estate back to the family he had missed the initial announcement of Potter's disappearance. But even before that, he didn't exactly keep up with Saint Potter and the media circus that revolved around him. Not that there seemed to be much media on the subject. Trials, Auror training, his split from the Weasley girl, a trek down to Australia for some reason. Not that Draco minded. He hadn't seen the man since the trial at which Potter had testified in his and his mother's favor. His father hadn't been so lucky, but with a probable insanity plea it ended up not mattering.</p><p>Draco firmly pushed the newspaper away for good this time and turned to face the dining hall door. Flashes of memories of what transpired in that room were threatening to turn into full flashbacks if he didn't keep himself in check. But he had to start somewhere, and there was hardly a room in the mansion where something <em>didn't</em> happen. He had apparated to the Mansion a few days ago and his mother had nagged him every evening about starting the long process of cleansing and doing the inventory of the several dozen rooms. No day like today. Draco's gloved hand was about to touch the door handle when he jerked back. The dining hall would not be an easy room to deal with, but if he had to sleep in the mansion for one more night there was a place that needed to be seen to more than that. Turning on his heel, Draco walked out of the kitchen and headed down the hallway to the door that he had opened more than once with dread in the pit in his stomach. This time was no different even though he had years of recovery under his belt, an arsenal of protective and purifying spells and, well, the lack of a Dark Lord in his bloody dining room. As Draco faced the cellar door he prepared himself for whatever awaited him behind it with a couple of wards and a mental kick in his own arse. </p><p>"Gods, I hate this place," he muttered before pointing his wand at the doorknob and casting <em>alohomora</em>.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>"For fuck's sake, <em>ALOHOMORA</em>!", Draco roared, again without any results. Angry both at himself and whoever sealed the bloody door he kicked at the wood with the heel of his shoe a few times. Draco was prepared to jiggle the doorknob in its socket with all of his strength, but as soon as he touched it turned smoothly as if oiled recently. Pausing only for a second to consider what sort of spell prevented an unlocking charm but allowed plain old doorknob turning, he let go of the door as it swung forward into the dungeon. Whatever Draco expected to feel upon facing the stairs descending into the Malfoy Manor he had underestimated tenfold. The feelings of fear, despair and darkness that hit him weren't his own but felt just as strong as if they were. It was as if the pleading voices of the victims held there by his aunt were still echoing in the stone rooms. He found himself scrambling for the doorknob and shutting the door before he even realized he was doing it. This was madness. His mother was insane if she thought he was in any way ready to deal with the horrors of what they used to call their home.</p><p>Draco turned away from the dungeons and headed for the one room that he'd already cleared of any trace of dark magic. The library's shelves were considerably less full after the day long book burning (and sealing of what didn't burn safely) he had undertaken when he first got to the manor. Because he hadn't dealt with the upper floors and bedrooms Draco had also been sleeping on a couch in the library, something he hadn't done since he was a child sneaking down to finish fairytales past his bedtime. <br/> When he opened the library door he barely managed to duck before the tea tray happily clattered over his head to come rest on the coffee table before Draco's favorite chair. He had clearly forgotten to lock the door of the kitchen after himself and the tray had taken advantage of its freedom to finally escape the room it had been confined to.</p><p>"Suit yourself," Draco sneered before returning to the kitchen to clear up after his breakfast. Once the crumbs were swept away and the leftover toast disposed of he locked the kitchen up and was about to head back to his safe haven when he heard the familiar slamming sound of a door coming from further down the hallway. Somehow the cellar door ended up ajar. Perhaps the tray decided to tour the cellar before deciding no one there was interested in tea. Having had enough of the feeling of dread that greeted him whenever he even looked at the bloody thing Draco aimed a locking and binding charm at it and firmly stalked towards the library. Just to be on the safe side (safe from what), he locked the library door as well and turned around to face the troublemaking tray.</p><p>And shrieked.</p>
