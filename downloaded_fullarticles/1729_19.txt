    <p align="center">Devilish Romance</p>
<p align="center">Part I</p>
<p>The bedroom was heavily decorated. The walls had an ornate wallpaper of red and black, the red wall decorated with black swirls and arches. Here and there were posters and pictures of both ghoulish sights, demons and wizards stuck in still frames, along side with singers and artists that the room’s occupant enjoys. The room itself was furnished with a large, antique looking dresser with a mirror attached to the back of it, sitting next to a big looking wardrobe that could easily fit three men in snuggly. On the top of the dresser was small bottles of make-up and unmatched socks. Opposite the dresser and wardrobe was a vast bookshelf that took the entire wall. It was filled with books of a variety of subjects from fiction to nonfiction; romance to mystery; humor to drama; plays and poetry; demonology to conjuring; and, the most important book of the collection, <em>The Unholy Words of The Dark One </em>transcribed by Brother Ignotus Peverell.</p>
<p>Ah yes, perhaps now would be a good time to mention that the owner of this room is a warlock, a person with magic in their blood and soul, however that can be discussed later down the chapter. As you see, along with the wardrobe, dresser, and the impressive book collection, the room also contained a wire-framed bed big enough for two, though only one person sleeps in it, scattered potion ingredients that really should be organized one day (he swears he will get to it), an old cauldron-turned-hamper, and a boy.</p>
<p>A beautiful boy.</p>
<p>A boy with green eyes as pure as emeralds hidden behind black round glasses. His nose was soft, button nose, his lips naturally pink and puffy, and his hair silky smooth and the color of raven feathers, drifting down like a smooth curtain passed his ears, both of which were pierced with small diamond studs. His body was lithe, stomach flat except for the occasional subtle bulge when he eats too much sweets, but his butt is forming nicely from nearly three years’ worth of exercises. His legs were lean, and his stature was small, standing only at five foot three. The teenage, just on the crux of his sixteenth birthday, was wearing a light purple shirt a little too short for his body, showing off his smooth navel and lower stomach, and a pair of black yoga pants that fitted him nicely. His skin was healthy-looking, yet on the pale side, looking as though the sun only kissed him through the open windows of the house. However, that did not stop him from dancing to himself as a song played throughout the room.</p>
<p>
  <em>“’Cause we are living in a material world, and I am a Material Girl!<br/>  You know we are living in a material world and I am a material girl!”</em>
</p>
<p>“Harry!”</p>
<p>The boy stopped immediately and with a flick of his wrist, the music stopped. He froze for a moment then asked out, “Yes Uncle?”</p>
<p>“Come down, it’s time for breakfast,” the man said through the door. Harry nodded, remember that his uncle couldn’t see him, and said, “Okay Uncle Sirius!”</p>
<p>He heard his uncle walk away and walked around his room, looking for a pair of shoes. Once found, he stood in front of his mirror, and made sure his make-up was still perfect. Around his eyes was a black eyeliner, subtle yet it drew attention to his emerald eyes. And a dark-pink lip liner just to give his lips an extra bit of detail. Simple, quick, but it worked for the boy.</p>
<p>With his look perfectly, and body fully clothed, Harry opened his door and left his room, going down the corridor, into the foyer, down the stairs, turned a left and walked into the kitchen where two men were already sitting at a table with three plates set up. “Morning Uncle Sirius, Uncle Remus,” Harry smiled, kissing their cheeks good-morning before sitting down in his table. Remus placed his paper down and sleepily slurred, “Mornin’ Harry.”</p>
<p>Uncle Remus was a handsome man with sandy blonde hair and moustache. His nose was longish, and there was always bags under his eyes, but he was relatively handsome, especially when standing next to his husband, Sirius Black. Sirius had long shaggy black hair, a devilish face, and a mischievous twinkle in his eyes. Both men were lean though showed some stock of muscles and were wearing pajamas.</p>
<p>“Good morning pup!” Sirius grinned, “So… just two more days, huh? Sixteenth birthday. A very important day.”</p>
<p>“I know,” Harry nodded. “To be honest… I’m a little nervous.”</p>
<p>“I would imagine,” Remus said, looking at his paper again. “The Dark Initiation is a very important event in every witch’s and warlock’s lives. I remember I was a stammering fool during mine. I swore that I said the words wrong multiple times but I guess the Dark One took pity on me.”</p>
<p>“Mine was the opposite,” Sirius smiled. “Second best day of my life.”</p>
<p>“Was the first marrying Uncle Remus?” Harry asked.</p>
<p>“No, it was taking my virginity,” Remus said slyly. Sirius just nodded proudly in agreement.</p>
<p>“Anyway, I remember my Dark Initiation very clearly. I wore my best suit that I had at the time, walked up to our High Priest, and recited the words clearly. And when I completed the contract with the Dark One, adding my name and blood to all the others before us… it’s orgasmic Harry!” Sirius grinned.</p>
<p>“Sirius! The boy’s fifteen, please keep that kind of talk to yourself,” Uncle Remus grumbled. Sirius just shrugged and picked up his fork. “Harry, when you’re done eating, if you can just feed Orion and Lycaon, it would be much helpful,” he said.</p>
<p>“Okay Uncle Sirius,” Harry nodded.</p>
<p>“So Harry, do you have any plans today?” Uncle Remus asked.</p>
<p>“Uhh… I was thinking of just walking the woods… maybe buy a book… I don’t know,” Harry said a little meekly. “I’m running out of scarlet eyeliner, might buy that…”</p>
<p>“Well whatever you do, make sure the wear a jacket,” Uncle Remus said. “It’s a surprisingly cold day for July.”</p>
<p>“Indeed,” Sirius agreed. “I walked outside for the paper and almost froze my ba—”</p>
<p>“Sirius!”</p>
<p>“I was going to say basil!”</p>
<p>“The two sound nothing alike the way you say it,” Uncle Remus ranted. “You always use a high ‘a’ for basil and a low ‘a’ for the other word so don’t you dare tell me you were going to say basil!”</p>
<p>Harry giggled as his two Uncles fell into an argument of pronunciations. He ate his breakfast in silence while the two continued to argue before stopping suddenly. When he was done, Harry placed his plate and utensil into the sink and snapped his hands, the facet turning on by itself and a soapy sponge beginning to clean them.</p>
<p>“Turn it off! We don’t waste water here,” Remus said lazily. Harry pouted and turned the water off manually.</p>
<p>“But Uncle!”</p>
<p>“I know you want to show off but please go feed Orion and Lycaon. They must be starving by now and the Diggorys already yelled at us for the one time they ate one of their foxes,” Uncle Sirius said.</p>
<p>“Yes Uncle Sirius,” Harry rolled his eyes. He went to the refrigerator and opened it up, squatting down to pull out two fat raw steaks that the dogs love. He placed them on two plates and carried the food out of the kitchen. Back into the foyer, he turned and took a door that opened to a corridor that led to the greenhouse and the dogs’ rooms.</p>
<p>Orion’s and Lycaon’s room smelled of wet dog and raw meat, but it was easily ignored or cleaned up by a simple spell. The two dogs each had their own doggy bed and toys, as well as a door with a flap so they could go to the backyard. Orion was a black shaggy dog that stood up to Harry’s waist, he was easy and lovable to the Blacks and Harry, but ferocious to anyone else; the same of which can be said about Lycaon, whose fur always reminded Harry of the Full Hunter’s Moon, which matches the dog’s wolfish personalities so much that Harry sometimes wondered he was really a wolf.</p>
<p>The boy gave a soft whistle and smiled, “Wake up boys, breakfast.” He placed the plates in front of the beds, they are lazy dogs in the morning, and sat down between the two to scratch their heads as they eat. “I can’t wait until I can get a familiar like you two,” Harry sighed. “My very own magical animal to help me out. A companion spirit… sounds romantic, doesn’t it?” He gave a soft chuckle, “It’s not that I’m scared of fully joining but… I have a lot of expectations to fill, don’t I boys? Uncle Remus and Uncle Sirius tried to raise me the best they can but… I’m a Potter, I have to fill in the shoes my father worn. I just… I just don’t want to fail.”</p>
<p>Sensing their masters’ ward’s insecurities, the two familiars moved closer to Harry and cuddled with him, nuzzling their heads against the boy, giving out soft, comforting growls as Harry looped his arms around them.</p>
<p>“I know, I’m being silly,” Harry sighed. “I mean, I’m a warlock! A Potter! I’m supposed to be strong! But sometimes I wish… I wish that what happened didn’t happen… and that I wasn’t called ‘The Coward’s Son.’” He shook his head and patted the two, “Come on, finish up and I’ll ask Uncle Remus and Sirius if I can take you two with me to the woods. Would you like that boys?”</p>
<p>The dogs’ tails wagged excitedly, and that lifted Harry’s mood a little, but not completely. For as his Uncle Sirius said, his Dark Initiation was only two days away. And his excitement to officially become a warlock was easily drowned in his apprehension and anxious fear of having to live in the footsteps of a man he never met.</p>
