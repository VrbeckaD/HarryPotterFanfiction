          <div class="userstuff"><p>They met in a magazine. </p><p>Or at least, that what readers would see. They <em>actually </em>met on set, from rival modelling incorporations. </p><p>Marcus Flint was the up and coming star in the modelling world, with delicate Asian features and an athletic build. He <em>had </em>been an athlete, a big basketball player, till he sustained an injury that ruined his athletic career forever.</p><p>Oliver Wood, coincidentally was in the same boat. He was well on his way to the NBA, until a tragic injury that too, ruined his athletic career. He was the classic American boy, with brown hair and brown eyes and a charming smile. He had the heart of the world with his first cover.</p><p>Percy Weasley had been in a family business of models. He had what some companies would call the "It" factor. What set him apart. What made him interesting to look at. What made cameras snap. He was a ginger, just like the rest of the Weasleys, with bright blue, hypnotic eyes. </p><p>They had made a beautiful magazine cover. But they had never expected to see each other very much from then on.</p>
<hr/><p>If Marcus was counting correctly, this was the eleventh time he would be working with Oliver Wood and Percy Weasley.</p><p>It had been so many times that he was almost comfortable with them. At the beginning, it was always a curt "Weasley" and "Wood" and "Flint". Now, they addressed each other the same, but with more warmth, less competition and more camaraderie. They had been on runways, photoshoots, commercials together. It was only right that they had become friends, somewhere along the way. </p><p>Marcus caught sight of Percy's ginger hair, and a whiff of Oliver's sandalwood cologne, and his cheeks started to flush. </p><p>Maybe, just <em>maybe, </em>Marcus didn't want to settle for just friends. </p><p>I mean, they were <em>models. </em>They were <em>gorgeous.</em></p><p>"Flint!" Percy clapped him on the back, with all the elegance of a baby giraffe, surprising for a celebrity of his calibre, but made Marcus feel a little better, like it always did. </p><p>Oliver smiled. "This is like, our what, fifth shoot together? Why?"</p><p>"Well, darling." Pansy Parkinson, the creative director and designer of the shoot, and also maybe <em>the </em>most prominent figure in fashion at that point in time, put a hand on their shoulders. "You have- hm, the <em>va-va-voom</em>! You three look so different, you each have something that makes you special. On the cover, you're a unit, a team, but at the same time, people pick favourites. Makes for a lovely cover, especially in my clothes, loves."</p><p>Marcus smiled.</p><p>Pansy was actually his cousin, and had known her theatrics since they were in diapers. She had made all that up on the spot.</p><p>"Now, go make yourselves pretty. My assistants have your clothes, and then go to the makeup tables. Chop chop! Cho Chang and Ginny are have a shoot tomorrow that I need to prepare for!"</p><p>"I think she's booked my entire family." Percy whispered as people began to prep them from the shoot. "I swear Fred and George were in her show last week."</p><p>Oliver chuckled a bit. "You know Parkinson, she's a woman of business. I think she was on the Forbes list."</p><p>"She was." Marcus groaned. "Didn't stop hearing about it for weeks. '<em>Marky! I'm on the Forbes List! Isn't it wonderful, Marky! Oh, Forbes!'</em>"</p><p>The way they both laughed made Marcus' stomach do flip-flops, just the way it did before his very first runway. </p><p>(Which had been, in fact, a complete <em>disaster</em>, but that was a story for another day)</p><p>Their set today was very simple. It was completely white, with large white boxes they would sit and pose on. There was a red rope they had to hold, that connected all three of them. It probably had some sort of meaning, but Marcus didn't bother asking what it was, because frankly, he didn't care.</p><p>"Directly at the camera first, boys!" Pansy yelled from behind the camera. "Smolder! More sexy, less angry, Marcus!"</p><p>Percy sniggered a bit at that, but Pansy made a distressed shriek immediately. </p><p>"Percy! It was perfect! Go back to the first face!"</p><p>This had all three of them laughing a bit, which Marcus knew was surely unprofessional, but come on, it was <em>funny.</em> Pansy's process was something to behold.</p><p>After running through different poses, different faces, different shoes, they were done, and Marcus could finally change back into his comfortable sweats and shirt. </p><p>"Can we go eat?" Oliver pleaded to them, tying his laces. "I'm hungry."</p><p>"You're always hungry." Percy grumbled. "Let's go. Flint, hurry the fuck up."</p><p>Marcus flipped him off. "Get the stick out of your ass. The restaurant isn't going to run off."</p><p>They erupted into bickering, and Pansy giggled from her spot across the room. </p><p>"They should get a room." She said to Luna, her makeup artist. "I think the paps are going to get suspicious soon."</p><p>"I think they already have." Luna said, smiling. "I saw something on the Daily Mail story about how they were seen walking out of the Grand Hyatt together."</p><p>Pansy snickered. "I don't even think they understand they have feelings."</p><p>"Says, you, Pans." Luna said, packing up her makeup and walking away. "I've noticed that you've designed for Ginny Weasley for the third time in two months."</p><p>Even after Luna left the room, Pansy spluttered quite unattractively for a minute.</p><p>Ginny Weasley?</p><p>Feelings?</p><p>Certainly <em>not</em>!</p>
<hr/><p>Falling out of bed in shock wasn't a good look for Marcus the first thing in the morning. </p><p>It had been a few days since the shoot.</p><p>He had been minding his own business, just having woken up, and was just going through Snapchat and-</p><p>"<strong><em>FLINT, WEASLEY AND WOOD- TRIPLE THREAT?"</em></strong></p><p>
  <em>Us at Daily Mail can't be the only ones who noticed the three sitting together at the popular bar The Hogs Head yesterday, after being seen together so often in the past year! They've been looking awfully cosy since their first photoshoot together, when they barely were on speaking terms! Is this a relationship reveal of possibly the most powerful romance in our generation? Stay tuned for more!</em>
</p><p>Attached were photos of them laughing inside a restaurant, them smiling backstage of a runway, them lounging at a club.</p><p>The fucking paps had been stalking them for a <em>year</em>.</p><p>Marcus had never dialled two men so quickly in his life, and as soon as they picked up, he screamed at his phone, "<em>Have you seen the Daily Mail Snapchat story!"</em></p><p>"What the fuck, Flint?" Oliver grumbled. "I was asleep."</p><p>"Not anymore!" Marcus yelled. "Both of you! Check, now!"</p><p>It was a delayed minute or two of silence, as Marcus waited for them to see, but when Percy yelled, "Fuck!" Marcus knew they'd found it.</p><p>"How did they come up with this!" Oliver screamed. </p><p>Percy groaned. "And the magazine is coming out today. Pansy has been vying for it to be released early."</p><p>"That is- not good." Oliver still sounded sleepy, the morning raspy audible even through the phone.</p><p>"I'm going to call Pansy. Text you guys what she says."</p><p>"Go get 'em, tiger." Oliver murmured sleepily, and hung up.</p><p>Marcus texted Pansy.</p><p>
  <em>marcus: have u seen the daily mail snap story</em>
</p><p>
  <em>marcus: they're spreading lies and slander</em>
</p><p>
  <em>pansy: they've been speculating for ages</em>
</p><p>
  <em>pansy: i told u guys u have like.. chemistry</em>
</p><p>
  <em>marcus: what the hell</em>
</p><p>
  <em>pansy: i mean you do like them yes?</em>
</p><p>
  <em>marcus: ....</em>
</p><p>He didn't know what to say to that. Had he really let it slip? Now the entire world knew.</p><p>That was, in short, not good.</p><p>
  <em>pansy: i think you guys should roll with it, it's good for publicity</em>
</p><p>
  <em>pansy: also, gay representation in media, you guys would be great spokespeople</em>
</p><p>
  <em>pansy: poc, lgbt, in a competitive industry. use it as an oppurtunity to do some good</em>
</p><p>
  <em>pansy: and it looks good with my mag :)</em>
</p><p>
  <em>marcus: selfish bitch</em>
</p><p>
  <em>marcus: im gay but not a nice gay</em>
</p><p>
  <em>pansy: don't be rude. i own your brand</em>
</p><p>
  <em>marcus: fuck uuuuu</em>
</p><p>Marcus created a new group chat for him, Percy and Oliver and sent them a quick text.</p><p>
  <em>marcus: so yeahhhh pansy is saying we accept that we're dating good for publicity and like</em>
</p><p>
  <em>marcus: we're like already gay</em>
</p><p>
  <em>marcus: so we can be spokepeople which is actually good and i would love to do that</em>
</p><p>Marcus couldn't say he was completely <em>against </em>it. He wasn't <em>for </em>it. He was... neutral.</p><p>Oh, who was he kidding, it was a sign straight from God. He was excited. </p><p>
  <em>percy: hmmm</em>
</p><p>
  <em>percy: its like nbd</em>
</p><p>
  <em>oliver: i want to fucking sleep</em>
</p><p>
  <em>oliver: i'll roll with it</em>
</p><p>
  <em>oliver: you guys are my favourite coworkers anyways</em>
</p><p>
  <em>percy: already in character??</em>
</p><p>
  <em>marcus: hes an actor</em>
</p><p>
  <em>percy: not a good one</em>
</p><p>
  <em>oliver: take that the fuck back</em>
</p><p>
  <em>percy: &lt;3</em>
</p><p>Marcus smiled. </p><p>This was his shot.</p>
<hr/><p>Their magazine wasn't what Marcus had expected. Out of all the photos they chose, Pansy picked this one on purpose.</p><p>It was a shot of them laughing, a <em>candid</em>. They were so rare. They were looking at each other and had bright smiles on their face.</p><p>It was so different to their first shoot together. Blank faces, blank stares, dark clothes, dark set.</p><p>Well of course, Draco Malfoy was directing the shoot, but <em>still. </em>It had been quite dark. </p><p>Marcus, Oliver and Percy had decided to make a public appearance together, going to see Pansy together. They made sure to look like they were trying to be subtle, but of course Oliver threw an arm around both their waists, and Marcus ruffled Percy's hair, and the cameras around them were <em>living </em>for it. </p><p>Percy posted a photo of their magazine shoot, with no caption, and fans went absolutely <em>insane.</em></p><p>Marcus hadn't realised till now, but people <em>wanted </em>to support them. They <em>wanted </em>openly gay representation. They wanted people of colour in the spotlight. </p><p>Marcus didn't feel quite right faking it. </p><p>Technically, <em>he </em>wasn't faking it. Oliver and Percy might have.</p><p>When they finally sat down with Pansy, she smiled wickedly.</p><p>"Good to see you, lover boys. Lets talk business."</p><p>
