  <strong> Professor Knight</strong>
</p><p align="justify"><em>Another</em> staff meeting Snape doesn’t want to attend, same old boring crap. He really didn’t know why they needed one anyway; they’d only just started the new term. Snape sat at the far end of the table, closest chair to the door, not really listening.</p><p align="justify">“Spattergroit?” gasped McGonagall</p><p align="justify">“Yes, Minerva, Pomona will be bed ridden for a few months, total isolation” Dumbledore replied “we have a supply teacher arriving on Monday.”</p><p align="justify">Well, that caught Snape’s attention. “<em>Monday</em>? I haven’t met them, they’ll be working close to me and I haven’t even met them Dumbledore!” sneered Snape.</p><p align="justify">“She’ll be more than adequate for you Severus - ”</p><p align="justify">
  <em>‘Adequate my arse.’</em>
</p><p align="justify">“Her name is Professor Erica Knight, she’s 33 ” replied Dumbledore.</p><p align="justify"><em>‘She’s a supply teacher, hardly qualifies her for the title of professor’</em> thought Snape</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="center">SSSSSSSSSSSSS</p><p align="justify">Dinner time on Monday.</p><p align="justify">Dumbledore strides up to the stand to talk to the students.</p><p align="justify">“Good evening, some of you might have heard that professor Sprout has been taken ill. – “ whispers and murmurs come from the students. “we have a supply teacher, everyone welcome Professor Knight.” With students clapping, Dumbledore turns around to face Professor Knight, she stands, nods and smiles to show her presence. She’s a pretty woman, with long brown hair, chocolate coloured eyes and curvy .</p><p align="justify">(<em>‘A nice bit of meat on her</em>’ Snape thought, when he looked up to see her) and about 5ft 4 / 5ft 5. She takes her seat, which was Professor Sprout's seat, on the opposite side of Dumbledore that Severus sat.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="center">SSSSSSSSSSSS </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Erica’s first day wasn’t that bad, considering how nervous she was, though at the end of the day the greenhouse was a tip for she was never the tidiest person. It was always better clearing up the Muggle way, than it was by magic, magic could cause problems with the plants. She spent ages clearing up.</p><p align="justify"> Snape stormed into her greenhouse, not looking happy “I take tardiness from no one, least of all my colleagues <em>Professor</em> Knight” he sounded annoyed.</p><p align="justify">"Huh?" Replied Erica. Then her face lit up "oh, Professor Snape! So glad you made it here, did you bring the list? Wait just a second, I'll be right with you, could you give me a hand, this heather is a real bitch and just don’t want to listen to reason!" She gives a small smile "I just can’t levitate her by magic if you want to use it for your potions. "</p><p align="justify">Without even thinking, Severus found himself helping her … ‘ <em>how for the love of Merlin’s wrinkled knees ???</em> ‘</p><p align="justify">“So, Snape, how did you survive the war? I heard you got bitten by a giant great snake?” she asked, after what seemed like forever</p><p align="justify">Before he can answer though, she continues on: “I don’t know many details of the war to be honest. I haven’t lived in England for a very long time. I moved to America when I were 14, just after year 3, the parents got jobs there. I moved back a few months ago. I was in Hufflepuff” she added with such pride in her voice and on her face.</p><p align="justify">Severus had time to arc a brow ‘<em>ahhh, a Hufflepuff</em>’ before she continued "I hated leaving Hogwarts, I resented my parents for months afterwards. I got put in Ilvermorny, Thunderbird house. It was alright, I suppose, but it wasn’t Hogwarts.” she said with a sad tone.</p><p align="justify">Severus didn’t deem to answer.</p><p align="justify">There was a very small break before she went on</p><p align="justify">“Head of Slytherin, are ya.”</p><p align="justify">That wasn’t a question</p><p align="justify">“A few of my good friends at Hogwarts were in Slytherin, I get on well them, don’t know why just always did, them and Hufflepuffs.”</p><p align="justify">Severus arches a curious eyebrow</p><p align="justify"> “But somehow I never did tend to get on well with Gryffindors,” said Erica, “I find them quite opinionated and sometimes a little too arrogant, funny isn’t it? “</p><p align="justify"> ‘<em>she talks ….. a lot.. .Kind of endearing..’ </em></p><p align="justify">With a sneer (he has a image to keep up, after all) he said:</p><p align="justify">“Indeed.... funny...” then he quickly followed with a snarky tone:</p><p align="justify">“I am the <em>potions</em> master. I carried some antidote with me at all times, during the war”</p><p align="justify">‘<em>nice balanc</em>e’ Severus thought: answering her original question and sounding uninterested in what else she had to say.</p><p align="justify">A loud he said: “I don’t desire to talk of the war, that was 7 years ago, over and done with.”</p><p align="justify">Erica looked at him over the heather and gave the slightest of nods, of understanding, before starting to clean the counter.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p dir="rtl" align="center">End of chapter 1</p><p align="justify"> </p>
