    <p> </p><p>Chapter 1: The mysterious instructions</p><p>Albus Dumbledore was disrupted by a sharp knock at his door, which surprised him as it was well past midnight and he presumed nobody would disturb him so late. Never the less, there was somebody there.</p><p>“Enter,” the Headmaster called, waiting for the door to swing open, but it didn’t. When another knock rang out he decided to go and see who it was.</p><p>Opening his door, he saw that nobody was there. Instead, at his feet lay an object wrapped in a thick blanket. Pulling away the blanket, Dumbledore saw a note lying within, which surprised him as he believed that something fragile would lay within the wrappings.</p><p>Reaching down, he grabbed hold of the note, and instantly felt the feeling of travelling without actually moving.</p><p>He had realised that the letter must have been a Portkey to have transported him, but had no idea who had sent it to him or where he was. Before he had time to think further however, the silence was broken by several thuds on the ground.</p><p>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^</p><p>Hermione Granger had been sat on her bed in the Head Girl dormitory when she heard a knock on the door. Knowing that only the Head Boy could access the common room, let alone her room, she went to the door.</p><p>“Malfoy, what do you-” she stopped when she saw that nobody was standing there. All she saw was a mysterious wrapped bundle, the contents of which appeared to be a letter.</p><p>She picked up the letter, only to find herself only moments later in a room she had never seen before.</p><p>Looking up, she saw Dumbledore before her, and the forms of her various friends and enemies alike appearing around her. Everyone had arrived within a few moments of each other, and they soon had a look at who exactly they were with.</p><p>Those that had been transported to the room were; Dumbledore, Hermione, Harry, Ron, Ginny, Malfoy, Lavender and Snape. They looked around, the expression of the observer shifting as their eyes shifted between their schoolmates and Professors.</p><p>“Okay, where the bloody hell am I and who woke me up for this?” Ron asked, breaking the silence. Suddenly, a voice filtered in from the front of the room, directing their attention that way.</p><p>“Hello people of the Potterverse!” The voice said. This confused the witches and wizards. What on earth was a Potterverse?</p><p>“Oh right, sorry, I need to watch what I say. Lemme try again. Hello people of Hogwarts! So I think I’m safe to assume that you would like to know where you are, who I am and why I’ve brought you here, yes?</p><p>Well firstly, my name, or my alias at least, is Bibz. I will disclose no more than that as I do fear the wrath of the Slytherins in the room.</p><p>As to where you are, you are still on Hogwarts grounds, in a room where no time passes. The doors have been enchanted to stay unopenable until I have finished giving you my message. After that you will have one minute to decide whether you wish to stay or leave before the doors are once again inaccessible.</p><p>Now, on to why I brought you here. The purpose is to show you three videos that I discovered a long time ago. When I worked out a way to show you, I just had to. The wall that you are all currently gawking at will become the screen, showing you the plays.</p><p>The plays are a parody based on some events that have happened to you, and some that are yet to play out. As foreknowledge of some of these events would be dangerous, your memories of this performance will be hidden until the last event has played out, approximately 3 years from now.</p><p>For those of you who don’t know, a parody is a funny version of a serious set of events, so I would like to advise that you keep that in mind when watching this. Whilst it is a funny twist on things, it is also the writer’s views on how some of the characters secretly feel. That’s all I’ll say for now.</p><p>If you want to speak at any time, feel free. The system is set to pause whenever it registers one of your voices, so say anything you feel necessary.</p><p>The choice is now up to you. You have one minute to decide whether or not you wish to see this performance. That minute starts now.”</p><p>When Bibz finished speaking, nobody else said anything for a moment, then Ginny spoke up.</p><p>“I’d like to see it,” she said in a quiet voice. She felt intrigued by what the girl had said, and thought it sounded like a lot of fun.</p><p>“Me too” said the Golden Trio almost at the same time, earning them incredulous looks from the Malfoy heir. </p><p>“Really? You want to sit in a room, in a situation orchestrated by some girl you’ve never met and watch some muggles make fun of your life?” Draco said with a sneer. “Well, I for one have no desire to sit here and bend to the whims of some child. I’m leaving. I’m surprised at you all. Rather Hufflepuff to put your faith in a total stranger is it not?”</p><p>The rest of the students had no response, so with that Draco started walking towards the door. However, no sooner had he turned around than the doors vanished.</p><p>“Okay, that’s your minute. I’m honestly rather surprised that all of you stayed, especially you Snape. Didn’t hear a single objection. Curiosity a bit much?”</p><p>Malfoy growled when he heard the girl’s voice start up again. He had forgotten about the time limit, so now he had to stay and watch this blasted performance.</p><p>“Now, any snacks or drinks you want, just ask for them, they’ll appear on the table in front of you. So, without further ado, please take a seat, and let ‘A Very Potter Musical’ begin!”</p>
