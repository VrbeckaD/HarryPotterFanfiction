    <p>Draco’s head hit the table with an audible thunk. He really hated it here.</p><p>Or at least, he really <em>wished </em>he hated it here. It would be more satisfying when he found himself in the middle of these creative blocks if he was also miserable in his surroundings.</p><p>Truthfully, he would be just as comfortable working in some trendy-but-still-a-chain cafe, where cheap prints were the only pieces of art, and the music was soothing mainstream indie-pop with songs that were just similar enough to be indistinguishable. The type of place where boys wore beanies in July with glasses they didn’t need, and writing screenplays on computers that mummy and daddy had bought them for Uni. The type of place where the coffee was always burnt, the baked goods were bland, and the staff all looked identically intimidating.</p><p>At least in a place like that, when he had no ideas and his sketchbook taunted him by sitting blank, he could blame his misery on his surroundings; Draco’s scowl could be because of other people and not his inability to do his fucking job.</p><p>Of course, this place wasn’t like that at all, and he hated that he didn’t hate it even slightly. The chairs were comfortable, but not at all trendy. The tables were the ideal height, and his little back corner was bright from the patio doors. The music was always an eclectic and bizarrely catchy mix; sometimes, it was old rock, sometimes it was a heart-wrenching, soul-blues. The pastries came from a bakery uptown that had always made a delicious blueberry scone. Draco’s Americano was always rich and dark, and the perfect temperature. Normally, he could happily spread out for hours on end, barely taking in his surroundings, drinking way too much caffeine because Deigo kept putting new cups in front of him while he was fully focused on his sketch.</p><p><em> Diego</em>.</p><p>Draco’s head snapped up. He supposed the fact that his boyfriend worked here should have made the list of pros about The Old Bean — he filed the fact it hadn't in the worrying list of things he kept forgetting to appreciate about the man. This list, however, was becoming increasingly long.</p><p>He let his head fall again with an audible—and possibly too dramatic—groan.</p><p>“Still stuck?” a voice above him said, setting a mug down on the table. It was late afternoon; Draco knew he shouldn’t really keep drinking coffee, and Diego knew he shouldn’t really keep bringing him coffee. And yet, here they were.</p><p>“Yes,” Draco whined, turning his face but not lifting his head. “How the fuck does one add a ‘ <em> fresh, whimsical spin </em> ’ to a unicorn? A unicorn is a fucking unicorn. White. Horn. Rainbow tail, which is utterly ridiculous, let me tell you. But children know what they like, and they like rainbow tails.”</p><p>“Mhmm,” Diego grinned. “Have I ever mentioned that it is a very good thing that you are never expected to go to the book release events for the stuff you draw? Actually, it is a very good thing that you are <em> never </em>where tiny humans are.”</p><p>“Yes, well, there is a reason I am an anonymous illustrator,” he said, muffled because his face was back on his sketchbook.</p><p>“Hang in there. I’m done in an hour and we can go out for dinner,” Diego said soothingly, running a hand through Draco’s hair. The act was still surprisingly comforting, never grating. Yet another pro. He picked his head up to watch him walk away.</p><p>Six foot, built, and with that nearly-too-long dirty blond hair. Draco knew intellectually that the man was gorgeous, simply from having spent two years existing in the world with him; it was hard to ignore the fact that everyone checked out your boyfriend, especially when he was in one of his ‘<em>I’m just gonna try not shaving </em>’ phases. Not Draco's type at all, really. But it was hard to correlate Diego's beauty with his personality, once you knew him. He was the ultimate softy, a caregiver; it didn't match with the chiselled, blasé exterior— and even that was part of his charm. He was oozing in contradiction; the ass of a man who could expect to be worshipped, and yet with the personality of a saint.</p><p>Draco loved him, and he had since Diego had picked Draco up off some random bar floor two years ago. Loved him since, in no uncertain terms, he had saved Draco's life. He had been such a mess at that point that’d he’d been pretty horrible at first. Still, with steady praise and stalwart love, the relationship had become a comfortable thing, steeping Draco's life in more cosy safety than he had ever known.</p><p>Did it matter that Diego did not actually know what he had saved him <em>from? </em> Or that he had no idea what Draco had done in his youth? Did it matter that he had no idea that Draco was a wizard?</p><p>He preferred not to think about it.</p><p>Draco groaned, picking up a pen and his mug at the same time, determined to get something done before the end of the day. He took a sip and immediately spat it onto the page in front of him. He called out at a quickly retreating form, “Diego! What the fuck is this?”</p><p>“Not my fault,” Diego laughed over his shoulder, “he said you’d had too much espresso today.”</p><p>Draco ground his teeth together. That one tiny pronoun was why this place sucked so much, despite not sucking at all.</p><p>It was owned by none other than Harry <em> Bloody </em> Potter.</p>
