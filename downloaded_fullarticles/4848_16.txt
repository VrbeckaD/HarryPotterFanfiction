  <strong>Chapter One: Scars That Can't Be Seen*</strong>
</p><p><em>*</em><em>Lazarus, </em>David Bowie</p><p>"How long has he been here?" the severe-looking man clad in black wondered aloud, gesturing to a young male patient sitting alone at a table in the hospital common room. He was building a tower with wooden blocks, a blank expression on his face.</p><p>"Who? You mean, him?" the orderly pointed at the young man, "A few weeks this time, but he's been here before. Why do you ask? Do you know him?"</p><p>"Yes," the older man said tentatively, "I know him...well."</p><p>"In what capacity do you know him, might I ask?" the orderly inquired delicately, "I apologize, but I really should not be releasing patient information to you until I have seen some sort of identification."</p><p>Frowning, the black-clad man withdrew what appeared to be a passport from his trenchcoat pocket and handed it to the orderly.</p><p>"I am a ... friend ... of the family," he offered uncertainly, wincing as if it pained him to say it, "I am not a blood relation."</p><p>"Severus Snape," the orderly read from this travel documents, "... friend of the family, you say? I was not aware that Mr. Potter had any surviving family members."</p><p>"Do I have to spell it out for you?" the surly man spat, "I knew his parents before they were deceased."</p><p>"Ah," the orderly nodded, "I apologize, Mr. Snape. Regardless, though, seeing as you are not a blood relation, I am not at liberty to disclose any of Mr. Potter's medical information to you without his consent. I am sure you understand."</p><p>"Naturally," Snape responded sardonically, "I would, however, like to speak to the boy - to Potter - if possible."</p><p>"Right, well, Mr. Potter would have to consent to such a visit," the orderly explained, "He would be within his rights to refuse to see you."</p><p>Snape narrowed his eyes, "Are you always this anal retentive?"</p><p>The orderly ignored this comment, "Here is a form to fill out to request visitation rights."</p><p>"Visitation rights?" Snape guffawed, "One would think I was the boy's deadbeat father. I am simply an acquaintance who wants to visit him while he's in hospital."</p><p>"Mr. Snape," the orderly began delicately, "I am sure you are aware, but, this is not a typical hospital. This is a psychiatric care facility. Any interactions our patients have with outside persons must be closely supervised and monitored."</p><p>"I am aware," Snape said quietly, "But I really must speak to him. How much longer must I wait to be granted authorization?"</p><p>"We will be in touch in the next forty-eight hours," the orderly assured him, "Visitation hours are from two to four PM on Friday. If Mr. Potter is amenable, you will be able to see him then."</p><p>"You are aware that Potter is a British citizen?" Snape narrowed his eyes at the man, "You cannot hold him here indefinitely."</p><p>"I am afraid you misunderstand, Mr. Snape. The patient in question has not been committed involuntarily. He came to us."</p><p>"He checked himself in?" Snape sputtered, disbelievingly.</p><p>"Yes," the orderly bit out, his patience wearing thin, "Now, Mr. Snape, I really must insist you come back only once we have contacted you."</p><p>"You'll... ring me?" Snape said, pulling a cell phone out of his pocket and looking at it as if it were an artifact from outer space. He looked up, seeking confirmation, but the orderly had left his side to help subdue an agitated patient in the common area. Snape looked back over at where Harry had been sitting, but the boy was gone.</p><p><em>Not a boy, anymore, </em>Snape thought to himself. He could scarcely believe it had been twelve years.</p>
