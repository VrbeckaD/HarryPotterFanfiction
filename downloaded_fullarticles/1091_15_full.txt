    <p>The bright green light bounces off its target.</p>
<p align="justify">Voldemort is so surprised he just only manages to move out of its way. That‘s impossible! Nothing can stop the killing curse from reaching the target. Not when the caster knows how to aim.</p>
<p align="justify">That‘s when he notices it. The blood on the child‘s forehead. The same blood that‘s on his brother‘s forehead as well. But while the brother is wailing as if he was killing him (which, admittedly, was the plan), the baby that Voldemort actually targeted just watches him with big eyes and somewhat curious expression.</p>
<p align="justify">Blood magic. A ritual, Voldemort muses when he looks around and notices the peculiar way the room is made. The two cribs are in the dead center. The furniture and the toys on the floor that Voldemort assumed were just thrown out of the cribs randomly make up a circle. He can see some blood on some of them, too.</p>
<p align="justify">Blood ritual in a home of the golden pair of the light side. And if he‘s not mistaken, the ritual is sacrificial. Which means that it needs a sacrifice to work properly.</p>
<p align="justify">That would explain why he had enough time to get out of the way of the curse before it hit him. If he actually killed Lily Potter, he wouldn‘t have such a luck.</p>
<p align="justify">He‘ll have to thank Severus for making him swear not to kill Lilly Potter. He was bitter about it before, but now he‘s glad.</p>
<p align="justify">The child smiles at him and outstretches his hand that‘s holding a big soft dog. Voldemort stares at the child. He was never good with children but ever since his… dabbling in the dark arts got serious and his appearance was alterned every child he met has been scared of him. Not this little guy. The one prophetised to kill him.</p>
<p align="justify">Sure, it could be the other twin or even the third child. But the last he heard the Longbottom child is a squib. Or at least his magic level isn‘t much higher than a squib‘s. And while the other twin is a proper wizard, he‘s got nothing on his brother. The magic around him is weirdly wild, as if trying to escape him while he holds on with all his might. Which is an impressive might for a baby.</p>
<p align="justify">Voldemort shakes himself. There‘s no time for all that. Obviously, the prophecy almost came to be tonight already.</p>
<p align="justify">The prophecy…</p>
<p align="justify">Suddenly, Voldemort can‘t remember why killing a baby is a reasonable response to a prophecy. There‘s always million ways to interpret them and they usually make sense only in hindsight.</p>
<p align="justify">But there‘s no time for that, either.</p>
<p align="justify">He needs more time. He was supposed to die here tonight. Being dead will give him plenty of time.</p>
<p align="justify">On a whim he summons a pile of ash and one of his old cloaks, leaving it in a pile in front of the cribs. Then he looks back at the children.</p>
<p align="justify">The crying one is still going at it. He does have a fresh scar on his forehead, right next to the blood mark, so it‘s understandable, Voldemort muses. He does remember the curse bouncing a few times before landing on a wall in an angle so part of the wall above the crib fell. Voldemort guesses that‘s how he got the scar.</p>
<p align="justify">The second child on the other hand is still offering his plush toy to Voldemort, but now he‘s pouting. It‘s like he wants him to have it. But he‘s not crying.</p>
<p align="justify">They‘re identical, yet their behaviour couldn‘t be more different.</p>
<p align="justify">Voldemort was never a children type, but the intense stare of the boy he came to kill (the first one, anyway) makes him question that decision.</p>
<p align="justify">There‘s a noise from downstairs, calling out for Lily Potter. Time to go.</p>
<p align="justify">On a whim, he takes the baby. With a swish of his wand he summons more ash, this time placing it in the crib, and takes the dog from the child just to drop it on top of the pile. The child glares at him, but thankfully doesn‘t make a sound.</p>
<p align="justify">„Lily! Harry, Chris!“</p>
<p align="justify">Voldemort carefully steps out of the cirlce before apparating. Just to be sure.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="center">***</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">The Riddle home looks abandoned. It‘s not like Voldemort ever really cared how it looks. He spent most of his time visitting his followers. He has few favorites who are always glad to see him. And an abandoned muggle home near a muggle town is perfect for his illegal activities. No one would ever look for him there.</p>
<p align="justify">But now, with the baby in the middle of the dusty rug in the dusty, half-destroyed living room, he starts having his doubts about how suited this house is for him now.</p>
<p align="justify">What‘s he even talking about – he just kidnapped a baby. Not that he cares about the morality of it or anything, but… a baby! What is he supposed to do with it?!</p>
<p align="justify">The baby (Henry or Christopher. He‘s sure the twins‘ names are Henry and Christopher, but which one this is he has no idea. They are identical, after all.) stares at him, surprisingly judgemental for someone who‘s not even fifteen months old yet.</p>
<p align="justify">„Doggy,“ he says suddenly, demandingly. With some blinks Voldemort realizes with surprise that he‘s also sitting down on the dirty rug, just few feet away from the child. Voldemort frowns.</p>
<p align="justify">„Taking it with us wouldn‘t work with the conclussion that you died along with me, that I hope Dumbledore will come to.“</p>
<p align="justify">The child frowns even harder.</p>
<p align="justify">„Doggy!“</p>
<p align="justify">Voldemort feels a headache coming.</p>
<p align="justify">Also, the clarity he felt right after the curse flew right next to him is… going away. It‘s getting harder and harder to think.</p>
<p align="justify">„No doggy.“</p>
<p align="justify">The child pouts and… part of Voldemort… it‘s weird. There‘s this warm emotion that he‘s not used to feeling… anymore.</p>
<p align="justify">He needs his Death Eaters.</p>
<p align="justify">No, that‘s not right. Not Death Eaters, he needs his… friends.</p>
<p align="justify">It takes him a moment to remember their names. Emory Nott. Corvinus Lestrange. Theodore Flint. Abraxas Malfoy.</p>
<p align="justify">No, not him, not Abraxas. He died of dragonpox a few years back. Voldemort was at the funeral. He spent the entirety of it planning an attack on the supply run coming to London from India.</p>
<p align="justify">Why did he do that? Abraxas was his closest friend. He was the one to show him around the wizarding world. He was the one to offer him his family home every summer when Tom was denied his request to stay at Hogwarts. It never happened, of course, because somehow Dumbledore managed to control his life even outside Hogwarts. But he offered and he wrote regularly, even when he was in France for most of the holidays. Tom was always grateful for that.</p>
<p align="justify">His head hurts and the baby in front of him makes a face, making his displeasure apparent. Soon he opens his mouth and starts crying loudly.</p>
<p align="justify">Voldemort feels his anger raise and he raises his wand.</p>
<p align="justify">„Bubbles!“</p>
<p align="justify">He blinks a few times, staring at the child. There are still tears on his red face, but now he‘s grinning in delight.</p>
<p align="justify">„Bubbles.“</p>
<p align="justify">Tom looks from the baby to his wand and back. The child saw him raise his wand and automatically assumed he‘d make something fun when he was ready to kill him.</p>
<p align="justify">By Merlin, he needs help.</p>
<p align="justify">He makes some bubbles while thinking hard. The house is not connected to the floo network, for obvious reasons. He never minded apparating everywhere. But he remembers Corvinus fretting over not apparating with his boys while they were still young. Apparently, it‘s not good for a child‘s magical core.</p>
<p align="justify">The child giggles and Tom stares at him. Carefully he feels for the child‘s magic, more closely than before.</p>
<p align="justify">It‘s strong and pulsing, doesn‘t seem weakened after the first apparation at all.</p>
<p align="justify">Well, that settles it. The child shouldn‘t die with another apparation.</p>
<p align="justify">He goes to the Lestrange manor. It‘s not only Corvinus there, he knows, and it could come in handy. He needs to let his Death Eaters know that they need to lay low for some time now. Regroup. While Volde-no, Tom. His name is Tom. No, that‘s not it. His name was Tom. Now he‘s… something else.</p>
<p align="justify">Fuck.</p>
<p align="justify">There‘s a small hand on the place his nose used to be. He flinches. The child seems to be curious about where his nose went. He stares at him.</p>
<p align="justify">His sixth horcrux. Nagini. He wasn‘t sure how it would work, making a horcrux out of a living thing, but it worked and he saw the loss of his nose as a small prize to pay for leaving a part of his soul with his pet.</p>
<p align="justify">The child‘s eyes widden when he realizes that it‘s just not there. Tom snorts and goes back to the task at hand.</p>
<p align="justify">He lets out a pulse of magic. The gate in front of them opens. The child presses himself closer to him. He assumes that the sight is frightening to a small child. It doesn‘t help that it‘s the middle of the night. Also, for some reason the Potters were staying in a small cottage. And when he apparated to his home he did so straight to the living room. The Lestrange manor is nothing like a cottage.</p>
<p align="justify">It takes him long minutes to reach the manor from the gate. The gardens are trully impressive behind the manor. This is just to scare the guests. Tom knows that and he accepts that, focusing on the walk instead of his annoyance.</p>
<p align="justify">When he makes it to the front door it‘s already open, an elf standing just behind it, out of the way, ready to take his coat if needed.</p>
<p align="justify">He doesn‘t have a coat. He‘s cold, when he thinks about it, but he didn‘t notice.</p>
<p align="justify">„Master Voldemort.“ The elf is shaking in front of him. He stares at it. He‘s never sure of the gender of an elf, but… he never disrespected them. Has he?</p>
<p align="justify">He doesn‘t know the name of this one, he realizes with horror. He doesn‘t know a personal elf of one of his best friends.</p>
<p align="justify">What happened to him?!</p>
<p align="justify">„Inform Corvinus of our arrival.“ He stops and makes himself look at the elf. „Please.“ The word tries to stay inside, but he forces it out. The elves are more than servants. „Is there a room where we can wait for him?“</p>
<p align="justify">The elf looks up in shock. Voldemort frowns.</p>
<p align="justify">„Yes, sir. This way, please, master Vol-Voldemort.“</p>
<p align="justify">His headache is getting worse.</p>
<p align="justify">The elf leads them to the waiting room that has a sofa, an armchair, and a small table with a handful of magazines and two books on it. He‘s very familiar with this room. Corvinus‘ father wasn‘t really happy with their friendship at the beginning and usually let him wait here, even if he came in with Corvinus. Tom‘s pretty sure that the reason was Tom‘s academic brilliance. Corvinus is very intelligent himself, but especially during his teenage years he had other interests and didn‘t really pursue better grades until his OWLs and NEWTs. Corvinus‘ father was not happy about it.</p>
<p align="justify">„Biiiiig!“</p>
<p align="justify">The child‘s voice full of wonder brings him back to present. For a moment he feels unbalanced.</p>
<p align="justify">Then the door on the other side of the room from where they came from bursts open and in runs Bellatrix.</p>
<p align="justify">„My Lord!“</p>
<p align="justify">He cringes at her voice and instinctively moves so his body is between her and the child. If he‘s not good with children, she‘s downright terrible.</p>
<p align="justify">„We heard terrible news, I was so worried.“</p>
<p align="justify">He rolls his upper lip up and sneers at her, but they‘re not the only ones in the room anymore. Corvinus is just two steps behind his two sons who stopped right in front of the door. The brothers drop to their knees, lowering their heads.</p>
<p align="justify">„My Lord,“ they chorus at once.</p>
<p align="justify">Corvinus steps around them and hurries towards him, putting his hand on Tom‘s shoulder.</p>
<p align="justify">„Tom! Are you okay?“</p>
<p align="justify">There‘s honest worry in his eyes and Tom‘s head clears just a bit. Then Corvinus notices the child and his eyes widen.</p>
<p align="justify">„Tom.“ His voice drops, gets lower. It doesn‘t betray it, but Tom has known him long and good enough to recognize the horror in his face. „Did you kidnap a child?“</p>
<p align="justify">Tom suddenly remembers all the ramblings Corvinus did about how children are precious, especially the magical kind. And how no one should ever touch them or take them away from their magical parents.</p>
<p align="justify">„It‘s the child from the prophecy.“</p>
<p align="justify">He has no idea why he says that. It‘s bullshit and he himself knows it. Corvinus‘ eyes darken. Voldemort‘s eyes flicker to his followers.</p>
<p align="justify">„Rodolpus, Bellatrix, Rabastan, out of the room. Now.“</p>
<p align="justify">„Dad-“</p>
<p align="justify">„But father-“</p>
<p align="justify">„You can‘t-“</p>
<p align="justify">„Now!“</p>
<p align="justify">His voice doesn‘t raise. It drops. They gulp, but still look towards Voldemort. He nods, not looking away from his old friend. The three younger people leave slowly.</p>
<p align="justify">„Explain yourself. Now.“</p>
<p align="justify">Tom sighs and sits down on the armchair. He shouldn‘t, he realizes sharply. He should wait for the master of the home to invite him to sit down. That‘s the custom. But he‘s exhausted and the child doesn‘t look like it but he‘s been carrying him around for some time now and he‘s surprisingly heavy.</p>
<p align="justify">„There‘s been a prophecy. Severus overheard it. Dumbledore had a job interview in the Three Broomsticks with a potential Divination teacher who gave a prophecy there.“ He looks up to find Corvinus looking sceptical. The child in his lap takes his hand and he looks quickly back down, but the child just examines it carefully before playing with his fingers. Tom just looks at it, deciding to let him.</p>
<p align="justify">„Tom?“ He looks up, blinking at Corvinus. „Severus overheard a potential divination teacher giving a prophecy in Three Broomsticks, right? And you didn‘t find that weird?“</p>
<p align="justify">Anger raises in him. The child in his lap giggles and squeezes his hand. It‘s not strong, but it‘s probably the strongest the child is able to do.</p>
<p align="justify">„I had one of mine check in with the Unspeakables. They did record a new prophecy that day.“</p>
<p align="justify">Corvinus doesn‘t look convinced, but simply nods at him to continue.</p>
<p align="justify">„Severus didn‘t hear all of it, but it spoke of a person who will be able to defeat me. They were supposed to arrive as the seventh moth dies.“ He sighs and continues before Corvinus gets the chance. „I know, I know. Does the seventh month mean July, as we came to understand it under the gregorian calendar, or does it mean something entirely different? And what does even the word arrive mean? Birth is one of the possible explanations, but maybe it‘s someone coming from abroad? Or it‘s just someone finishing their education, gaining the abilities to destroy me?“</p>
<p align="justify">The silence is deafening and suddenly Tom is reminded of the times Corvinus was angry at Tom‘s more impulsive decisions during their school years. The thing about Slytherin is, you never hear anyone yelling. Their anger runs cold. You anger someone, they won‘t speak a single word to you. For weeks, if you fuck up enough. Which, admittedly, he did in his fifth year, when he didn‘t check that the bathroom was empty before calling Annabeth to him. He did want to turn those muggleborns into stone. They refused to acclimate into their new world, all the turning into stone was supposed to make them behave more like purebloods – getting to know and accept the culture they were trying to become a part of. The death was not part of the plan.</p>
<p align="justify">Then suddenly the child in his lap starts crying. It‘s not the loud, obnoxious sound his brother made in the crib. It‘s low and pitiful and Tom has no idea what to do about it.</p>
<p align="justify">Corvinus sighs.</p>
<p align="justify">„He‘s tired. Actually, considering the hour, I think that he left tired behind a few hours back and now he‘s just miserable.“</p>
<p align="justify">Oh, right, babies aren‘t supposed to be up after midnight, are they?</p>
<p align="justify">That‘s when it dawns on him. He kidnapped a baby!</p>
<p align="justify">„A baby. Corvinus. What am I supposed to do with a baby?“</p>
<p align="justify">To his astonishment, Corvinus smiles.</p>
<p align="justify">„To start, let‘s get you both to bed. The rest of it we can figure out in the morning. Come on.“</p>
<p align="justify">He gestures for him to get up and starts guiding him to the family part of the manor. They make it to the stairs when an elf pops out next to them. It‘s the same elf that opened the door for Tom. It doesn‘t shake in front of Corvinus, he notices.</p>
<p align="justify">„Master Lestrange, young master Barty arrived. He seems distressed.“</p>
<p align="justify">Tom groans. Barty Crouch Jr. Very clever young man. Very troubled. Tom doesn‘t have the energy to deal with him right now.</p>
<p align="justify">Corvinus smiles a small smile.</p>
<p align="justify">„The news of your demise does seem to be exaggerated, but the light side is celebrating like there‘s no tomorrow. The distress in the younger ones about our loss is understandable. Babbey, please, show master Tom and… young master to the emerald room, please.“</p>
<p align="justify">Tom blinks a few times at the elf. This is Babbey? The last he saw her she was just a small, hyperactive thing. This is a grown elf.</p>
<p align="justify">But then again, he realizes, in the last few years he hardly paid attention to any elves.</p>
<p align="justify">The emerald room is his usual one at the Lestrange manor. The green on the walls and carpet and the silver details all around including the curtains always felt as home to him. There‘s the mahagony table where he came up with his first declaration for the Death Eaters.</p>
<p align="justify">He feels like he‘s home. Certainly more than he ever had in the Riddle house.</p>
<p align="justify">The child in his arms moves so suddenly that he stops him from falling down at the last second.</p>
<p align="justify">He needs to figure out the child‘s name.</p>
<p align="justify">„Will master require a crib for the young master?“</p>
<p align="justify">Tom looks at the child. The child sobs, not looking away from Tom‘s red eyes.</p>
<p align="justify">„Mummy,“ he sobs and suddenly, Tom remembers his own mother-less childhood.</p>
<p align="justify">Fuck, where are all those memories coming from?</p>
<p align="justify">„Yes. Thank you, Babbey.“</p>
<p align="justify">Babbey snaps her fingers and a crib in dark wood with white sheets appears. Tom notices the quick look Babbey gives him before disappearing, but doesn‘t comment on it. Yeah, he‘s been an asshole to her, she has the right to question his motives.</p>
<p align="justify">„Mummy!“</p>
<p align="justify">„Sorry, child, but your mother is not available right now.“ He feels uncomfortable saying that. It‘s not right, kidnapping a child. Why did he do it?</p>
<p align="justify">He doesn‘t even think about returning him, though. No, this child is his now. Even though he no longer believes so firmly in the prophecy, a small part of him is afraid of it. And he‘s sure that out of the three children, this one is the destined one. And there are more ways to stop the prophecy. Killing the child is one of them. Raising him as his own is another.</p>
<p align="justify">„Daddy!“</p>
<p align="justify">„No, sorry, not an option either.“</p>
<p align="justify">„Pads?“ This time it‘s a hopeful question.</p>
<p align="justify">„I don‘t know who that is so, no.“</p>
<p align="justify">„Moony.“</p>
<p align="justify">„I‘m sorry, child, but right now, it‘s just me.“</p>
<p align="justify">The child continues crying. Tom has no idea what to do about it.</p>
<p align="justify">The child is already in his night clothes, so Tom simply lies him down in the crib. He tries to ignore the cries as he goes along his night routine and then finally lies down in the big, comfortable bed.</p>
<p align="justify">The child still cries. Damn it. One of the reasons why he picked him up was because unlike his brother, he didn‘t cry!</p>
<p align="justify">Finally, he groans and gets up. He takes the child from the crib and sets him on his hip. The child stops wailing, just blinks at Tom with big, tearful eyes, breathing heavily.</p>
<p align="justify">„Now will you be quiet?“</p>
<p align="justify">The child sobs quietly and nuzzles into Tom‘s neck. Tom stands there like a statue for a moment. After a while he tries to put him back in his crib, but the child starts crying right away. And then stops when Tom pulls him close.</p>
<p align="justify">Tom sighs.</p>
<p align="justify">„If I roll into you and you end up dead before the morning it‘s your own fault.“</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="center">***</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">He wakes up with someone touching his face, ready to kill whoever dare touch him. Then he opens his eyes and sees the child that he kidnapped the night before.</p>
<p align="justify">„Yum,“ the child declares, as if it‘s a life changing information.</p>
<p align="justify">Tom stares at him for a moment. Then he sits up and silently casts Tempus. 8AM. Considering how late they went to bed, it‘s incredibly early. Tom stares at the child.</p>
<p align="justify">„We went to bed about six hours ago.“</p>
<p align="justify">The child just blinks at him. He probably doesn‘t understand his point anyway.</p>
<p align="justify">„Yum!“</p>
<p align="justify">He assumes that means the child is hungry. And yeah, Tom himself could eat.</p>
<p align="justify">There‘s clothes ready for both him and the child. It‘s a nice, semi-formal robe for him, the kind that you wear without any clothes under it. Just how he prefers it. It‘s in dark blue with silver lining and it fits him perfectly. With a surprise he realizes that it‘s been years since he wore such a nice, new robe. Ever since the war begin, he became… lost to it.</p>
<p align="justify">He starts undressing the child and with surprise realizes that he has a diaper. And it‘s the plastic kind. He didn‘t notice before because part of his night clothes were pants.</p>
<p align="justify">What the fuck is he supposed to do with it?</p>
<p align="justify">He hesitates for a moment. He remembers only one elf from this house. It was Corvinus‘ personal elf, Nakpey, and considering that Corvinus has a new personal elf it has to mean that Nakpey is no longer available. Which leaves just one name he can call.</p>
<p align="justify">„Babbey.“</p>
<p align="justify">„Yes, master Voldemort?“</p>
<p align="justify">Suddenly, the name doesn‘t sit right. He shakes that feeling. He has more pressing problems.</p>
<p align="justify">„Can you change the child and put on the robe you prepared for him?“</p>
<p align="justify">Babbey bows lightly before going to the counter Tom put the child on. As she nears it a pair of steps appear in front of it so she can reach the child. Tom notices the face she makes when she has to touch the plastic diaper and how it disappears right after it no longer touches the child. After that, it‘s a quick process. Quite magical, actually.</p>
<p align="justify">Babbey hands the child to him and Tom blinks a few times at him. The green of the children clothes brings out the bright green of his eyes. They‘re much brighter than Tom‘s own, they basically shine out of his face. But the green brings back something he forgot long ago. The sense of belonging that for Tom is closely interlinked with the Slytherin house.</p>
<p align="justify">„Thank you, Babbey.“</p>
<p align="justify">Babbey smiles at him.</p>
<p align="justify">„Breakfast is being served in the family room at the moment, master Tom. Master Corvinus asks you and little master to join him and his family.“</p>
<p align="justify">He knows the way to the family room well. There‘s a table that‘s not really considered big in a pureblood society. Around it sit all the Lestranges on the British Islands – Corvinus with his sons and daughter-in-law. Corvinus sits at one head of the table, his heir Rodolphus and then Rodolphus‘ wife Bellatrix by his right hand, his other son Rabastan on his left. The other side of the table, the head of it, is prepared for Tom, with a child seat by his right hand, next to Rabastan.</p>
<p align="justify">Tom puts the child in the baby seat and nods at Bella‘s breathless wish of good morning. He‘s never been comfortable with her attention towards him, but she‘s usefull. He watches as Rabastan smiles at the child and gives him a bowl of porridge, talking to him softly.</p>
<p align="justify">„Hey, little fella. What‘s your name?“</p>
<p align="justify">„‘Arry!“</p>
<p align="justify">„Nice to meet you, Harry, I‘m Rabastan.“</p>
<p align="justify">The child (Harry, apparently. Tom assumes that‘s how the Potters call Henry, their firstborn and heir. Fuck) makes a face at that.</p>
<p align="justify">„‘a‘stan. Stan!“</p>
<p align="justify">Rodolphus snickers at that and Rabastan glares. By the painful face Rodolphus makes Rabastan kicked him under the table.</p>
<p align="justify">„Calm down, children.“ But even Corvinus sounds amused. „Tom, do you have a plan?“</p>
<p align="justify">Not really. But hey, time to think and wing it. Not the first time he had to think on his feet.</p>
<p align="justify">„Right now, we lie low. Yesterday, I walked into a trap.“</p>
<p align="justify">„That rat!“</p>
<p align="justify">„Yes, Bellatrix, and Pettigrew will suffer for it. But right now, there‘s a bigger picture to pay attention to. Bella, your arm.“</p>
<p align="justify">She looks up at him with awe when she bares her left forearm to him. Tom stares at it for a moment, thinking about the wording, before waving his wand and hissing a Parselmagic glamour spell. The mark on her forearm seemingly disappears. Bella screams out.</p>
<p align="justify">„Calm yourself, woman,“ Corvinus barks at her. Tom raises his eyebrows at him in surprise. Corvinus‘ displeasure is clearly seen and that‘s not usual. „Tom, explain.“</p>
<p align="justify">„Once I have the time I will tweak the spell so it‘s visible to those with the mark and invisible for everyone else, but right now time is of essence. Like I said, I was supposed to die yesterday. And from your reaction, the light side believes that‘s exactly what happened. It gives me a chance to step back and think through everything that‘s been happening for years now. In the meantime, I need you, and all the other Death Eaters, to lay low and work on your standings in the wizarding society. When the aurors come, and they will, they will come to arrest you. Get rid of everything dark you don‘t need and carefully hide everything else. The fact that they won‘t be able to detect the Dark Mark will help you. We have a chance to take this back to the Wizengamot, to make some actual change. Let‘s not throw it away. Rodolphus.“</p>
<p align="justify">He gestures for the wizard to come to him and the heir doesn‘t hesitate to stand up and get to him, his left forearm already bare.</p>
<p align="justify">„Corvinus, would you be willing to open your manor to my Death Eaters for at least few days? Or we could do a meeting.“</p>
<p align="justify">Corvinus shakes his head, smiling lightly.</p>
<p align="justify">„You found some young, temperamental ones. Let them come as soon as they‘re able so they don‘t do anything harsh. We can still call a meeting once you have a plan, but right now, let‘s keep it an open door policy.“</p>
<p align="justify">„Thank you.“</p>
<p align="justify">„Of course. Well, Rodolphus, Belatrix, it seems like you have things to do. Rabastan, would you take young Harry to the kitchen and help him actually eat his food?“</p>
<p align="justify">Bellatrix seems ready to argue, but Rodolphus hisses something to her ear and they quickly leave. Tom ignores all that and instead looks at Harry, whose nice new clothes are filthy with the poridge he was supposed to eat. Rabastan just laughs and takes Harry from the seat.</p>
<p align="justify">„Come on, little man. I‘m sure Goobey will have something yummy for you by the time we make it to the kitchen.“</p>
<p align="justify">„Make sure he eats some proper food, Stan.“</p>
<p align="justify">Rabastan sticks his tongue out at his father and quickly leaves before Corvinus has the chance to reprimand him. Corvinus sighs, but he‘s still smiling.</p>
<p align="justify">„You leave him more freedom, considering that he‘s not the heir, and that‘s how he thanks you.“</p>
<p align="justify">„He seems good with children.“</p>
<p align="justify">„He always was. I think he wants a big family, but with the war and him being in the front lines he wouldn‘t risk it.“</p>
<p align="justify">Tom cringes.</p>
<p align="justify">„Don‘t. It was his decision and I‘m proud that he was ready to fight for us, that he‘s as loyal. Now, Tom, tell me – how are you doing?“</p>
<p align="justify">There‘s a cunning look in his eyes. Tom doesn‘t like it. There‘s pros and cons about having Slytherin friends. The pros are that he doesn‘t have to explain himself or that no one questions the morality of his actions. He always liked the debates that were held in the common room. The cons are mostly the fact that there are hardly any secrets that stay secrets in Slytherin. Everyone is too clever for their own good. You‘re safe as long as your secrets aren‘t interesting to others. But Tom‘s secrets were always interesting.</p>
<p align="justify">That‘s why he started the distance between himself and his friends, he remembers. He thinks they figured him out while in the school. They didn‘t mind. But even he knows that more than one horcrux is… risky. And he didn‘t want his friends to find out.</p>
<p align="justify">„We don‘t have the time for this, Corvinus. What are we gonna do about the child?“</p>
<p align="justify">„Oh, so it‘s we once again?“</p>
<p align="justify">Tom tenses when he hears the erudite voice of another one of his schoolyears friends. Emory Nott is not exactly a strong wizard, but he‘s always had a way with words, his deep, silky voice easily persuading people from all backrounds about his truth. And when Tom turns around, he‘s not the only one walking in the room. Next to the skinny, avarage height lord Nott, Theodore Flint looks almost like a giant. He‘s big, both in height and weight, and not exactly pleasant to look at. The two of them were best friends in school and stayed that close ever since then.</p>
<p align="justify">Tom stands up to greet them. To his surprise, Corvinus just smiles at them and waves at them to sit down. That‘s… more familiar than he was expecting. They all had to stay friends after their Hogwarts years.</p>
<p align="justify">„How was Albania, Riddle? Oh, right, that was ten years ago, wasn‘t it?“</p>
<p align="justify">Tom flinches, feeling ashamed. He hates that feeling. Anger raises to take over, but then Emory clasps his shoulder and smiles at him and the anger disappears.</p>
<p align="justify">„Heard you were dead. Good to see that‘s not true.“</p>
<p align="justify">That‘s Theodore. Not one for words and his face set into a stone mask, but warmth in his eyes. If you know what to look for.</p>
<p align="justify">„I… thanks.“ His voice breaks just a little and he blinks a few times, as if waking up for the first time in years.</p>
<p align="justify">„So, what shit are we dragging him out of this time?“</p>
<p align="justify">„Hey!“</p>
<p align="justify">„He kidnapped a child.“</p>
<p align="justify">Tom cringes at the glares the two men shoot him. Which, yeah, okay, that‘s fair. They‘re both parents after all. Emory‘s face soon morphs into one of deep thought.</p>
<p align="justify">„The Potter heir, I pressume.“</p>
<p align="justify">Tom blinks a few times, before sighing.</p>
<p align="justify">„Dumbledore‘s not resting, is he?“</p>
<p align="justify">Emory smirks and hands him the Daily Prophet. Merlin knows where he hides it on himself all the time, but he had this habit in school already, so Tom doesn‘t question it.</p>
<p align="justify">The title page has a big picture of Dumbledore and the title proclaiming the war over, won by the light. Tom sneers.</p>
<p align="justify">„My sources tell me that he wanted the surviving baby to be there, but Lilly Potter was against it. The light is already hailing the boy as The Boy Who Lived.“</p>
<p align="justify">Tom snorts.</p>
<p align="justify">„More like the boy whose mother has more sense than the rest of the light side combined.“</p>
<p align="justify">He skims the article. Voldemort coming to kill the poor light family (which, yeah, okay, that‘s exactly what he went to do there), luckily James being away on an Order business (bullshit, of course he knew James Potter wouldn‘t be there, Pettigrew informed him well), Lily succesfully managing to survive the attack (who even writes that? If he wanted her dead, she‘d be dead), and finally the heroic act Christopher Potter did by surviving a killing curse that managed to kill both Voldemort and Chris‘ older brother, Henry. So Dumbledore either doesn‘t know or is covering the fact that Lily Potter used an illegal ritual. Sure, the ritual was light, as light as you get with blood magic, but it‘s still very, very illegal.</p>
<p align="justify">Suddenly the Prophet is ripped from his hands.</p>
<p align="justify">„Hey!“</p>
<p align="justify">By Merlin, he feels like a schoolboy again.</p>
<p align="justify">„The comment about Lily Potter. Explain.“</p>
<p align="justify">Tom rolls his eyes and finally starts his breakfast. He pours himself a cup of tea.</p>
<p align="justify">„There was a blood ritual done before I arrived. A sacrificial one, so it wasn‘t at its full strenght. It‘s the only reason why I‘m still alive. If I killed Lily Potter, I‘d be gone right now.“</p>
<p align="justify">Emory and Corvinus exchange meaningful glances.</p>
<p align="justify">„She‘s too close to Dumbledore.“</p>
<p align="justify">„Right now. If Dumbledore insists on using her child...“</p>
<p align="justify">„I don‘t really have the capacity to approach lady Potter right now.“ Not that she or her husband ever claimed the title. „If the situation with Dumbledore changes, we‘ll talk about it, but right now, we have different Potter to discuss.“ He sips the tea, puts it back down and starts preparing his toast. „We have Henry Potter on our hands. He‘s a powerful wizard and there are indications that he could be the tipping scale in this war.“</p>
<p align="justify">„The prophecy,“ Theodore nods. Tom shoots a glare at Corvinus. Corvinus shrugs.</p>
<p align="justify">„We need all the information to help. And yes, we already went over how complicated prophecies are. But either way, the child is powerful and I believe Tom can raise him the right way.“</p>
<p align="justify">Tom just took a bite from the toast, so he chokes on it.</p>
<p align="justify">„I can raise him right?!“</p>
<p align="justify">„Certainly. After all, we have our years of raising children behind us. It‘s your turn now.“</p>
<p align="justify">The three assholes look smug about it. Tom doesn‘t splutter, because that‘s not becoming of a wizard, but he wants to.</p>
<p align="justify">„I don‘t know a first thing about raising a child!“</p>
<p align="justify">„No one ever does. Besides, we‘re here to help. Theodore has a boy just slightly older.“</p>
<p align="justify">„Marcus is six already,“ Theodore grumbles. „But my cousin has a girl about the Potter boy‘s age. And didn‘t Lucius just had a child?“</p>
<p align="justify">„Crabbe and Goyle are one of your Death Eaters too, right? They have sons around that age, don‘t they?“</p>
<p align="justify">Tom just stares at all of them. What is happening?</p>
<p align="justify">And then, as if some curtain lifted in his mind, he starts thinking.</p>
<p align="justify">He needs an heir. Even though he‘s lord just in the title of Dark Lord, there‘s always the risk of this war going for too long. Even with his horcruxes there‘s nothing certain. He‘s not sure how it would work if his body was killed. And if he suddenly disappeared his followers will need someone to lead them in his place.</p>
<p align="justify">Plus, he likes the idea of raising a child, when he thinks about it. He always liked the idea of teaching the next generation and raising a child just seems a bit… more. More influence, more... intense.</p>
<p align="justify">„Blood adoption, right?“ he thinks lazily. The debate goes silent. He might be the youngest at the table, but he always was the one they followed. Eventually. „I‘ll need a potion for both of us. It‘s not complicated, but considering that it‘s blood-based it‘s highly illegal. It should take care of his ties to the Potter family, too.“</p>
<p align="justify">„You‘ll need to visit the Gringotts. There are few more institutions that offer an inheritance test, but only few of them offer a full family tree with it and no one else than Gringotts can offer you the discretion.“</p>
<p align="justify">Tom frowns.</p>
<p align="justify">„That won‘t be cheap.“</p>
<p align="justify">The three men snort.</p>
<p align="justify">„Don‘t worry about money, Tom. We‘ll make sure all the services are the top class and no one will ever find out you even were at the Gringotts.“</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="center">***</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">They form a weird picture, Tom is aware. Three lords of pureblood houses old enough that they‘re starting to have grandchildren, Tom himself with his unusual face hidden behind a glamour, and a toddler happily resting in Tom‘s arms. For some reason any time Corvinus or Emory hold him Harry kept reaching for Tom. In Theodore‘s arms he outright cried.</p>
<p align="justify">Thankfully, they‘re in a private waiting room in the Gringotts bank. And they don‘t wait long.</p>
<p align="justify">„Head accountant Snaglok is waiting for you, lord Lestrange.“</p>
<p align="justify">He bows lightly to Corvinus and Corvinus nods right back at him, respect apparent in his posture.</p>
<p align="justify">The office of head accountant Snaglok is close by. Or maybe the rooms in the building move around so the gobblins can treat every single one of their customers as they please. In that case Tom is very glad that Corvinus has always been careful to treat goblins with respect.</p>
<p align="justify">Snaglok is small and well built, his dark hair covering most of his face, but in a neat fashion. Honestly, Tom is hardly able to recognize one goblin from another, but he tries. This one, for example, has a scar going from his left temple right down to his jaw. It‘s not necessarily obvious at first glance, thin and silver, but it‘s there and Tom is going to remember it, going to use it so he recognizes Snaglok if he ever meets with him again.</p>
<p align="justify">„Lord Lestrange.“</p>
<p align="justify">„Head accountant Snaglok. May your gold flow.“</p>
<p align="justify">„And your enemies suffer.“ Snaglok grins nastily at them. It unnerves Tom, but Corvinus relaxes. „What may I do for you and your… associates this fine day?“</p>
<p align="justify">„We need an Inheritance test, please. One that includes full family tree and the highest discretion. Twice, actually.“</p>
<p align="justify">Head accountant Snaglok raises his eyebrows at Corvinus before turning his sharp eyes to Tom and Harry on his lap.</p>
<p align="justify">„That will be twelve galleons a piece.“</p>
<p align="justify">„Take it from my personal vault.“</p>
<p align="justify">„Very well. Three drops of blood on this sheet.“ Snaglok pulls a sheet as big as his table out of nowhere. Tom is impressed. Goblin magic is obviously powerful. He tries to remember what the lessons in Hogwarts taught him about goblin magic, but the only thing he can remember is the history lessons about goblin wars. „Let‘s start with the child.“</p>
<p align="justify">Snaglok obviously doesn‘t like children. Tom can relate.</p>
<p align="justify">Corvinus takes the blade Snaglok offered him and tries to take Harry‘s hand. Harry flinches back.</p>
<p align="justify">„No!“</p>
<p align="justify">„Come on, little one, we need to do this.“</p>
<p align="justify">„No.“</p>
<p align="justify">Corvinus sighs and sits back down, handing the blade to Tom.</p>
<p align="justify">„He‘s your child. You deal with it.“</p>
<p align="justify">Tom glares and tries not to notice the way Emory and Theodore behind him snicker. What are they, sixteen?</p>
<p align="justify">„Come on, little snake. Just three drops of your blood, that‘s all we need.“</p>
<p align="justify">Harry raises his big, watery eyes at him and his lower lip wobbles.</p>
<p align="justify">„Booboo?“</p>
<p align="justify">This children speach is starting to give him a headache. Booboo. That‘s how toddlers talk when something hurts, right? And how is Tom supposed to answer to that? He‘s not going to lie to him, but if he just says that yes, it is going to hurt, Harry won‘t let him touch him again. So he sighs and turns towards Snaglok.</p>
<p align="justify">„Can we start with me instead? It should be quicker this way.“</p>
<p align="justify">The goblin sneers, but silently nods. Tom takes the blade and pricks his finger. No sense making a bigger mess of it for three drops.</p>
<p align="justify">The blood soaks into the paper. It takes a moment before the blood seems to start moving, painting a picture of… Tom. Young, good looking Tom.</p>
<p align="justify">
  <em>Tom Marvolo Riddle. Lord Slytherin.</em>
</p>
<p align="justify">Tom‘s eyes widen. That‘s a title?</p>
<p align="justify">„You‘re the Slytherin Lord?!“</p>
<p align="justify">„Slytherin still holds lordship?“</p>
<p align="justify">Emory slaps his head. Tom turns towards him and sneers.</p>
<p align="justify">„When I talk, do you ever listen or do you just nod so the annoying sound goes away? Merlin‘s sake, Tom, in my seventh year alone I ranted about the possibility of the Hogwarts founders seats in the wizengamot if only someone would claim them at least three times a week! We all knew it was you the year before that, so I was trying to make you claim your title. But you didn‘t, so I assumed that after taking the test it turned out that there are more conditions on the lord title than there was on the heir title.“</p>
<p align="justify">Tom blinks in surprise at Emory. He hardly ever saw him that angry.</p>
<p align="justify">„I… you did?“</p>
<p align="justify">„He did!“</p>
<p align="justify">„Got on everyone‘s nerve with it, too.“</p>
<p align="justify">„Oh.“</p>
<p align="justify">But that‘s when they notice the small note right under his name.</p>
<p align="justify">
  <em>Currently holding 1/64 of the soul</em>
</p>
<p align="justify">„Tom!“</p>
<p align="justify">„Six horcruxes? Six?!“</p>
<p align="justify">„What the… fudge were you thinking?!“</p>
<p align="justify">He hears them, but keeps staring at the paper.</p>
<p align="justify">1/64. That‘s how small the part of his soul still resting in his body is? He wanted seven horcruxes, because seven is a magical number. He assumed that in seven horcruxes there would be safety that lacks in just one.</p>
<p align="justify">But… 1/64. Such a tiny piece of soul, barely hanging to sanity.</p>
<p align="justify">Except… no, not really. He wasn‘t hanging to sanity. He lost it some years ago. And he doesn‘t really remember… well, most of the last decade.</p>
<p align="justify">„We need to deal with this, first.“</p>
<p align="justify">„But if the Potters come to take the inheritance test...“</p>
<p align="justify">„Why would they do that? They already declared their second as the only survivor.“</p>
<p align="justify">„That was Dumbledore, remember? And if lady Potter is as clever as she seems to be, she won‘t be fooled as easily.“</p>
<p align="justify">„Snaglok. How much would I have to give your bank to assure that if the Potters come for inharitance test, you will turn them away?“</p>
<p align="justify">„It‘s not the question of how much, lord Lestrange.“</p>
<p align="justify">„Is there something in one of our vaults that could do it instead, head accountant Snaglok?“</p>
<p align="justify">The goblin grins nastily.</p>
<p align="justify">„There is such an item in the Flint family vault. That will give you a week. Another one from Nott family vault will buy you another two weeks.“</p>
<p align="justify">Theodore and Emory look at each other.</p>
<p align="justify">„We need our accountants and a contract naming concretely what you want. Unless it‘s something personally important to us, it‘s yours.“</p>
<p align="justify">Tom is paying attention, but doesn‘t have the energy to participate. There‘s a small hand on his cheek. He turns to look at Harry.</p>
<p align="justify">„Tom sad?“</p>
<p align="justify">He just stares at him for a moment. He wishes his emotions were so simple a toddler could understand them. Dread. Fear. Exhaustion. Anger. (He‘s pretty sure that part is Voldemort. Yes, he can see it now. Voldemort is what he became thanks to the horcruxes. But now he wants to go back to Tom. No, not Tom. Lord Slytherin.)</p>
<p align="justify">But for a toddler, sad sums it up pretty well.</p>
<p align="justify">„Yeah, Harry. I‘m sad.“</p>
<p align="justify">Harry stands up on Tom‘s lap and kisses his cheek. Then he grins at him widely.</p>
<p align="justify">„Sad?“</p>
<p align="justify">He smiles, a strange, unfamiliar feeling stretching in his chest.</p>
<p align="justify">„No, Harry. I‘m all better now.“</p>
<p align="justify">The door bursts open and in rushes an old goblin. Once again, Tom is not really a good guess at what age the goblins are, but this one isn‘t as well built as the others, seems smaller, and his hair is as long as any other goblin‘s Tom‘s ever seen, but it‘s also stark white.</p>
<p align="justify">„Lord Slytherin!“ He doesn‘t bow or behaves in any way other goblins usually behave. And he looks very excited to see Tom. „I‘m so happy you finally decided to come claim your title. I‘ve been waiting for you since the forties, young man, where have you been?“</p>
<p align="justify">Fighting a pointless war, apparently. Because if he remembers the rants Emory used to have in the common room (and look a that, he did pay attention!), if only one descendant from the Hogwarts founders takes his seat on the wizengamot, all he needs to veto any and all new laws is a single family holding five votes. Or, as his friends all are, two families with three votes each. Sure, he needs more to pass new laws, but veto isn‘t that hard when you‘re a Slytherin descendant.</p>
<p align="justify">„Gornuk!“ Snaglok barks. „Behave.“</p>
<p align="justify">Gornuk snorts.</p>
<p align="justify">„Don‘t raise your voice at me, head accountant Snaglok. I‘ve been looking after the Slytherin vaults long before not you, but your father was born, young one. And considering that the head of the London branch of Gringotts is my grand-nephew I‘d be careful how you talk to me.“</p>
<p align="justify">Snaglok sneers at him before turning back to Tom.</p>
<p align="justify">„The child…?“</p>
<p align="justify">Tom takes the blade once again and numbly pricks Harry‘s finger. Harry doesn‘t move but there are tears in his eyes when it‘s done. Tom silently waves his fingers and the little wound heals itself. The tears are exchanged for a look full of wonder. Harry turns around and puts his fingers on Tom‘s mouth.</p>
<p align="justify">Emory behind him snorts. Tom rolls his eyes before gently taking Harry‘s hand so he can adress the goblin.</p>
<p align="justify">„Gornuk,“ he hesitates for a moment, „is there any title I should call you?“</p>
<p align="justify">Gornuk waves it away, goes to the table Snaglok is trying to look busy at and puts down two thick files and a small box. Tom looks at it with horror.</p>
<p align="justify">„Call me Gornuk. So did Corvinus.“</p>
<p align="justify">„I did not!“</p>
<p align="justify">Gornuk rolls his eyes.</p>
<p align="justify">„Not you. Corvinus Gaunt, the last to claim the Slytherin lordship. It was in the early eighteenth century. Good lad. Bit of a show off, if you ask me, but hey, it worked for him. Invested well enough to enjoy his lifestyle, but didn‘t really bring any more money. Now, are you ready to claim your title?“</p>
<p align="justify">No, he‘s not ready. But he likes the no-nonsense attitude the goblin has and doesn‘t want to offend him.</p>
<p align="justify">„I‘m sorry… Gornuk.“ Tom smiles a little at the uncomfortable way Corvinus adresses the goblin. „This has been rather… life changing morning for all of us. Would it be possible to set a date for Tom to claim his lordship and go over all his properties?“</p>
<p align="justify">Gornuk doesn‘t look happy, but he gives Tom one long, searching look before nodding.</p>
<p align="justify">„I expect your owl no later than the day after tomorrow, lord Slytherin.“ There‘s something threatening in the way he says it. Tom gulps and nods. Gornuk gathers all his things and goes away with the same hurry he came in.</p>
<p align="justify">„Damn old fool,“ mutters Snaglok under his breath before pushing paper with Harry‘s lineage towards them. „Here you go. Anything else I can do for you today, lord Lestrange?“</p>
<p align="justify">Corvinus, Emory, and Theodore look at each other before looking at Tom. Tom looks down to Harry. Harry doesn‘t pay attention to either of them. He‘s gnawing at his fist. Silently Tom sighs and shakes his head.</p>
<p align="justify">„No, thank you, head accountant Snaglok.“</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="center">***</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">When they step out of the fireplace Harry gets cranky. Tom is annoyed and trying to contain him when Corvinus sighs.</p>
<p align="justify">„He‘s just tired. Let‘s get him some lunch and put him down for a nap, that should take care of it. Then we can-“</p>
<p align="justify">„Master Corvinus!“ Babbey is all wide eyed and she appears without a single sound. Stressed, then. „Your guests are waiting in the waiting room, but I‘m afraid they no longer fit, my lord.“</p>
<p align="justify">They all just stare at her before Corvinus sighs.</p>
<p align="justify">„I believe those are your guests, Tom. Babbey, please, in this case, refer to master Tom, he‘s taking care of the guests. I‘m going to kitchen and get our newest little master some lunch before putting him down.“ Corvinus takes Harry and Harry starts outright crying. Tom makes a step forward but Theodore steps in front of him, amused smile playing on his face.</p>
<p align="justify">„Calm down now, fresh father, you‘ll get your fare share of trying to feed him and put him down for a nap. Now it‘s time to face your followers.“</p>
<p align="justify">Tom closes his eyes and tries to breathe and center himself. But all it does is that he can feel himself slipping into the dark madness he was lost in so recently. So he quickly opens them again and looks at Theodore and Emory.</p>
<p align="justify">„You about to desert me too?“</p>
<p align="justify">„Oh no. We‘re gonna watch from the background, enjoy you trying to have patience with that lot. It‘s your own fault, Tom. You let them run wild.“</p>
<p align="justify">That he had. And he needs to make that right.</p>
<p align="justify">It‘s exactly as bad as he expected. They‘re too afraid to come too close or to actually shout when he‘s around, but there‘s a bunch of questions he‘s not willing to answer to every single one of them. They don‘t really give him the space to answer any of the questions and quite frankly, the questions are getting ridiculous.</p>
<p align="justify">He lets them get it out of their system before his patience runs out. He casts silent Sonorus before hissing out: „SSSSilence!“</p>
<p align="justify">He purposely lets the s linger, reminding them what he‘s capable of. The room grows quiet in seconds.</p>
<p align="justify">„Let the light and the ministry believe that the war is over. In the meantime, prepare for the raids that are sure to follow. Malfoy, Bulstrode, Parkinson, you‘re gonna be in the first round so come here so I can conceal your Marks and go home, prepare for them. You have children now, and they come first.“ He waves his wand and hisses at Lucius‘ forearm. The mark disappears. There‘s a wave of unrest in the room and Tom rolls his eyes. „Calm down, all of you. Or have you forgotten everything you‘ve ever learned? There‘s no way to get rid of the Mark. This just masks it. Go home, Lucius, and give my best to Narcissa. Zinnia, Florence, come here.“</p>
<p align="justify">He does the same to both Parkinsons and then the Bulstrode patriarch. By then people seemingly understand that he‘s not in the mood for questions and they form a line. Most of them murmur their relief and delight that he‘s not really gone. The only thing that‘s stopping him from snapping at them is the sincerity in their voices and faces.</p>
<p align="justify">It‘s only when the room somewhat cleans that he notices that while most people hurry to see him and if possible touch him as soon as possible, there are two people falling behind, lingering in their own corner. Tom is actually relieved to see Severus is one of them. The other, on the other hand…</p>
<p align="justify">It was not Voldemort who took liking to young Barty. No, that was Tom himself, although he was hanging to his sanity by a single thread, right after his fourth horcrux. Barty was still in school, basically a child, back then and they didn‘t really keep in touch, but Tom kept an eye on him and Barty craved that kind of attention. Then of course Tom left for Albania and back came Voldemort. Voldemort, who used that craving to carve a younger, more handsome version of himself. (Tom saw himsefl in a mirror briefly that morning. He didn‘t mind the small alternation in the colour of his eyes or even his now outright sick paleness. But when the fuck did he lose his hair?!) Tom is not sure he‘s up to straightening what Voldemort twisted.</p>
<p align="justify">Not to talk about the war he constantly leads against Voldemort in his own body. It‘s hard work, hanging to one‘s sanity.</p>
<p align="justify">But he makes himself smile at Barty.</p>
<p align="justify">„I‘m sorry I scared you, Barty.“</p>
<p align="justify">„My lord.“</p>
<p align="justify">Barty gets down on one knee, exactly the same way the Lestrange brothers did last night. Tom still gets a kick out of it. The power he holds like this, it‘s overwhelming. But for the first time in years a weight settles on his shoulders along that triumphant feeling. Because along with power over them this gesture gives him responsibility for them.</p>
<p align="justify">„Give me your arm, Barty.“</p>
<p align="justify">Barty complies without standing or even looking up. With a sigh Tom hides his Mark.</p>
<p align="justify">„Raise, Barty.“ He‘s vaguely aware that he used to call him „my child“, but that‘s out of question now. „I know that what I‘m about to ask you is a lot, but I need you to trust me. Can you do that?“</p>
<p align="justify">„Of course, my lord.“ Barty looks almost scandalized that he has to ask. But in his eyes (and through them, admittedly, in his mind) Tom can see that he‘s as starved for approval as he was when Tom first met him. Good. It should make bringing him back from the edge of madness easier.</p>
<p align="justify">„I need you to get closer to your father, to play the perfect son.“ Barty looks so shocked he‘s speechless. Tom is glad for it, quickly but calmly continuing. „We‘re changing the battlefield, moving to politics. I want as many of my followers to get there as possible and if I remember correctly you dance better than most. Get into your father‘s good graces and he‘ll get you to the top society. And we need that.“ Tom hesitates when he realizes that the look of horror on Barty‘s face isn‘t fading. „Can you do that for me?“</p>
<p align="justify">Barty snaps out of whatever stupor he was in and nods solemnly.</p>
<p align="justify">„I won‘t fail you, my lord.“</p>
<p align="justify">Tom‘s smile slids off his face as he watches Barty leave. Troubled young man indeed.</p>
<p align="justify">Finally, he turns to the last man in the room. Severus Snape. Exactly the man he needs to prepare the blood adoption potions for him.</p>
<p align="justify">Severus is slow to approach him, his face a study of fearful wonder. He drops to one knee abruptly, as if just now remembering the proper decorum. His left arm is hidden behind his back.</p>
<p align="justify">There‘s something wrong with him.</p>
<p align="justify">„Raise and give me your arm, Severus.“</p>
<p align="justify">Severus raises, but leaves his hand and his forearm behind his back. Tom frowns.</p>
<p align="justify">„You… you spared her. My lord.“</p>
<p align="justify">Tom‘s frown intensifies.</p>
<p align="justify">„Of course I spared her, Severus. I promised.“ And apparently even mad he has some principles.</p>
<p align="justify">Severus‘ eyes sparkle. Tom brushes his occlumency shields, light enough that Severus shouldn‘t feel anything, and as usually doesn‘t get anything from that. Sure, Tom could bring the walls down with force, but that would leave Severus‘ mind in ruins and Tom doesn‘t want that. Severus is too brilliant, has too much potential for that to happen.</p>
<p align="justify">„I… I‘m sorry.“ Severus collapses, this time on both his knees. Suddenly and painfully Tom realizes how young he is. So early in his twenties he‘s practically a teenager. And he‘s been fighting in a war for years already. What have they done to this generation? „My lord, I‘m so, so sorry. I made a mistake.“ By that point he‘s sobbing.</p>
<p align="justify">Suddenly, Emory and Theodore are behind Severus. Tom doesn‘t think Severus noticed, but they both look angry. While Tom is… stumped, really.</p>
<p align="justify">„I went to Dumbledore.“</p>
<p align="justify">There‘s his anger. But he makes himself push that away. Because sure, he can get angry, punish Severus, and possibly lose valuable ally. Or… or he can make this into an opportunity.</p>
<p align="justify">„You went to Dumbledore,“ he says slowly, quietly, deliberty. Severus shudders, but Emory gives Tom a curious look. Theodore just keeps staring daggers at Severus. „Yet here you are, willingly confesssing.“ Once again he lets a light hiss get into his speech. Severus cringes and Tom smiles. „That could be a prove that you realize that, as you said, you made a mistake and you want to repel. However, it could as well, be you trying to prove your loyalty while you spy for Dumbledore.“</p>
<p align="justify">The tightness with which Severus holds his eyes and lips shut looks painful, but to his credit he doesn‘t try to talk himself out of it. He just kneels there, tears silently rolling down his cheeks, awaiting his judgement.</p>
<p align="justify">„Open your eyes, Severus, and let me in.“</p>
<p align="justify">There‘s a moment of hesitation before Severus does as he‘s told. Tom rushes into his mind, happy to see that Severus truly lowered his defenses. He sends concrete memories Tom‘s way but he doesn‘t fight back when Tom looks further, into older memories and Severus‘ emotions.</p>
<p align="justify">He sees Severus plead his case to Voldemort, who is dismissive and the promise out of him is hard won. And Severus didn‘t trust it. He allows the desperation Severus felt at the time roll over him as he watches him go to Dumbledore. He sees him show the Mark to Dumbledore and watches Dumbledore promise Severus to protect him. With interest he notices that Severus‘ own promise has a stipulation – Dumbledore has to protect Lily. Not that Lily has to be safe or even alive, as he pleaded with Voldemort. No. Dumbledore has to be the one to protect Lily.</p>
<p align="justify">Billiant young man, indeed.</p>
<p align="justify">He checks some of Severus‘ older memories, too. Just to make sure that his story checks out, that he truly sought out Dumbledore out of desperation just few days ago.</p>
<p align="justify">Everything checks out. Tom just lingers because he notices Severus‘ weird… obsession with Lily Evans. And yes, in his head he calls her Evans even now when she‘s technically lady Potter.</p>
<p align="justify">Tom doesn‘t claim to be a love expert. Far away from it actually – he‘s aware that growing up in muggle London right before and during the second world war fucked him up in ways almost no one understands. But he saw love. Felt it, acually – Emory, Theodore, Corvinus and even Abraxas shared their memories with him. In Hogwarts they used to share their memories regularly. It started as a brag from too cocky Emory about a girl he seduced. But as they grew older it evolved. Abraxas was older than them, a prefect they all looked up to. One night after they left Hogwarts he joined them in the review of their old memories and scoffer at the idea of their schoolboy crushes being loves. That was the night he shared with them some of his memories from his back then five years long marriage with Drussila.</p>
<p align="justify">And that‘s how Tom knows that Severus‘ feelings for Lily Potter are neither love nor a boyhood crush. Not really. Not anymore, Tom muses as he views some of Severus‘ memories from when he was thirteen. It might have started as such but by now it evolved into something… possessive. The circumstances of his teenage years didn‘t help and the war outright doomed him.</p>
<p align="justify">Tom has to blink a few times when he comes to his own body and mind. Deep legilimency is always disorientiering, no matter how often he does it. As soon as the light stops to be blinding he focuses on what‘s going on around him.</p>
<p align="justify">It doesn‘t look that a lot of time passed. Emory and Theodore still stand behind Severus on high alert, ready to stop him if he tried to flee. But Severus‘ face is resigned. He‘s ready to accept whatever Tom decides to do with him.</p>
<p align="justify">„Babbey.“ The elf instantly appears in front of him. „Please, summon your master at once. If the baby‘s still awake tell him I trust whichever elf you deem the best for the task to look after him.“</p>
<p align="justify">Babbey‘s eyes grow big before she bows to him.</p>
<p align="justify">„Yes, master Tom.“</p>
<p align="justify">He turns back to Severus as soon as Babbey disappears. He studies him for a long silent moment before speaking again.</p>
<p align="justify">„Do you feel your magic forcing you to tell Dumbledore any of the information you already have?“</p>
<p align="justify">„No.“ Severus‘ response is decisive and immediate. „I assumed that Lily found a way to save herself.“</p>
<p align="justify">Which gives Tom a double agent. Which he might need now that his usual spy didn‘t show up.</p>
<p align="justify">„And you‘re willing to spy on Dumbledore.“</p>
<p align="justify">Curiously, fury flashes in Severus‘s eyes.</p>
<p align="justify">„Lily lost her child and he doesn‘t seem to care. He proclaimed him dead and Potter happily jumped on that train, enjoying that his other child is famous. Lily refuses to believe that her other child is dead and Dumbledore is a condescending asshole to her about it.“</p>
<p align="justify">Good news all around, it seems. Dumbledore drew exactly the conclussion Tom wanted him to all the while alienating a strong, clever ally. This politics thing seems to come naturally to Tom.</p>
<p align="justify">„Hiding the Mark would do more damage than good in your case. Are you ready to lie to the Wizengamot for our case?“</p>
<p align="justify">„Yes.“ There‘s no hesitation and Tom is surprised to find Severus‘ mental defenses still down so he can see the truth of the statement. „But, my lord, if I lie about the involvement of every single one of us, especially those that are notosious in our society, I won‘t be trusted for long.“</p>
<p align="justify">And that‘s why he left his mind wide open – so that Tom could see that he means no disrespect but is genuienly worried.</p>
<p align="justify">The door opens silently and in walks Corvinus. He doesn‘t stop until he‘s next to Tom and his face is as politely blank as ever. Tom can still sense his surprise when he sees Severus, still on his knees.</p>
<p align="justify">„We‘ll make a list of people we can spare. Corvinus, do you think you could arrange a room for Severus here with us? Dumbledore isn‘t expecting you anytime soon, is he, Severus?“</p>
<p align="justify">Corvinus‘ eyebrows raise so high they almost disappear in his hair. (Tom is not jealous. He‘s going to get his hair back, god damn it.)</p>
<p align="justify">„No, he doesn‘t care what I do when he doesn‘t need me. If he needs me he‘ll send a patronus.“</p>
<p align="justify">Tom nods and turns to Corvinus.</p>
<p align="justify">„Babbey, prepare the east guestroom for Severus, please.“</p>
<p align="justify">The elf hardly even appears before bowing and disappearing again.</p>
<p align="justify">„You have a unique chance to regain my trust, Severus. I hope you realize how rare that is.“</p>
<p align="justify">„I‘m most grateful, my lord.“</p>
<p align="justify">„I need you to prepare blood adoption potions for me and a baby I desire to adopt.“</p>
<p align="justify">There‘s a small moment of hesitation. Severus isn‘t stupid, he probably already suspects who the baby is. That‘s alright with Tom. Part of the test even.</p>
<p align="justify">„I‘ll need blood sample from both of you. And information on if and how you‘re already related.“</p>
<p align="justify">Tom smiles. Severus passed the test.</p>
