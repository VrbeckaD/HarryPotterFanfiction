    <p>I swiped my oyster card on the reader and hopped on the escalator. The cameras hung from the ceiling like they always did on the underground. I smiled my cutest smile waved at the one in front of me as the stairs descended. This was a daily ritual of mine, I waved at the cameras on my way to/from school every morning and afternoon. I liked to think that someone was watching when I did, some security guard. I hope he’s cute.</p><p><br/> ‘DRACO STOP,’ I thought. To dismiss thoughts of hot boys, I plugged in my headphones and scrolled through my weird library of <span>Classic Rock, Movie Soundtracks, and- I’m not ashamed to say- Emo</span>. Deciding on the latter of three genres, I turned turned up some Panic! At The Disco… so much for my 'forgetting about hot boys' idea, now I’m thinking about Brendon Urie and the sweat on his giant forehead as he f- ‘DRACO NO.’</p><p><br/> The car was crowded and it was raining up on the streets, in typical Londony fashion! Most people complained about the rain, but I never did cause I genuinely love it. Rain washes away the city’s grime and reveals London’s perfect mix of very old and very new architecture. Rain drums softly on every roof, hushing unwanted voices, calming the city’s bustle. Rain blows after you as you dash into a warm, dry building- the content of security washing over you only because moments ago you were caught in a storm. Everything is more real under the misty coating of rain.</p><p><br/> Another good reason it that when it’s too hot, I can’t wear black jeans and a black button up and black sweatshirts (and a black raincoat since it's raining of course). Black everything! I also take pride in my collection of beautiful scarves, my favourite is a green and silver one that settles the harsh white of my hair and makes <span>the occasional curious onlooker</span> wonder if my eyes are blue, green, or just grey.</p><p><br/> “The next station is Oxford Circus,” the automated voice said. “Doors will open on the right hand side.” I switched lines to eventually get off at Baker Street, where I could walk several blocks to school. Whilst I had ridden the tube, the rain slowed to a mist, but the wind picked up a lot. Leaves were blowing all over, dancing in spirals on the ground like tiny tornadoes. I was grateful for my scarf protecting my neck from the bite of the wind, but my nose still felt pinched in the cold. Wrapping my hands around the thermos of tea I brought from home, I felt utterly content. This is the best kind of weather.</p><p><br/> Soon thereafter, I arrived in hell. *Cough* Er- I got to school. Masses of teenagers paved the hallway, sitting and standing in the worst possible places to be. Every day I could barely refrain from screaming ‘THE HALLWAY ISN’T <span>YOUR OWN DIRT-CAKED, LINOLEUM-TILED SOFA</span>, GET OUT MY DAMN WAY.’ But I don’t, cause I’m not <span>a bleeding arse… and speak of the devil- s</span>omeone tripped me. I stumbled, but didn’t fall. One of my headphones fell out.</p><p><br/> “Hey fag-” Ronald Weasley, the school’s biggest asshat, said. “Whose dick you gonna suck today? Probably a teacher so you don’t fail your classes, huh?” I’m not sure why everyone thought I was gay (no matter how accurate they were), cause I’d never told anyone (other than my best and only friend), and/or done anything that would directly drive people to the queerest of conclusions. Having been an outcast before Ronald started picking on me, no one had ever wanted to date me. Now that he targeted me, no one came close enough to get hit if he misfired.</p><p><br/> I tried to ignore Ronald and keep walking to my locker, but one of his minions grabbed my backpack. “Answer ‘im,” the giant teenager said.</p><p><br/> “Uu-uh what?”</p><p><br/> “I asked you a question, Snakey.” Ronald seemed really proud of his nickname for me, though I wasn’t sure why.</p><p><br/> “No one,” I said truthfully… sometimes I wished otherwise.</p><p><br/> “Right! Cause why the hell would anyone want you?”</p><p><br/> He’s right, but also being a dick. So I ignored the sting that a similar comment would have done if it had come from someone else.</p><p><br/> “Get out of my sight,” Ronald said. The other guy let go of me and I hurried onward.</p>
