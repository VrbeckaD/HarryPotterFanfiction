  <strong>XxXx Oh my Jashin-sama! xXxX</strong>
</p><p>As Harry Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived, walked among the wreckage of Hogwarts, he reflected back on his life. A life of pain, neglect, and almost endless violence.</p><p>He wandered, unseen, among his old friends and surrogate-family and the remaining students and staff of Hogwarts. They were all clustered around a body- his body- crying.</p><p>Oh yes, Voldemort, the Dark Lord was dead, but so was Harry.</p><p>Obviously.</p><p>The non-stop apparating, the abysmal hygiene, not eating for sometimes days on end, no sufficient rest, then fighting the Dark Lord all added up to heart failure. The constant stress from the three years before hand certainly didn’t help either, what, with being dragged back and forth from being the poster child of the ministry to some crazed, attention seeking psychopath, how could Harry expect anything different? Just when things seemed to have been going good, Life decides to fuck him right up the ass.</p><p>No lube, just dildo.</p><p>Or dick, Harry didn’t know what Life had between they’re legs, but he wasn’t about to ask, wasn’t his business.</p><p>A skeletal hand was put on Harry’s shoulder as he stared blankly down at his body- when did he get so thin, he was almost a skeleton himself- and he looked over at Death, who lead him away from his body and into the Realm of Death. Well, time for the ‘Next Great Adventure’, neh?</p><p>
  <strong>XxXxX Somewhere in the Hidden Countries XxXxX</strong>
</p><p>The pale, albino man finished up his prayers, opening his eyes and grinning maniacally. “Oh, Jashin-sama!” he calls to the heavens, his taller, masked partner glaring at the albino.</p><p>“What is it this time, Hidan?” the man asks in a gravely, deep voice, rolling his bi-colored eyes at his partner.</p><p>“Shut up, bastard!” Hidan shouts, glaring. “Jashin-sama has blessed me with a vision from Him!”</p><p>“Are you sure it wasn’t a delusion from blood-loss?” Growling, Hidan scowls at Kakuzu, purple eyes flashing, the blood on his face making him look criminally insane.</p><p>But that might just be because he was, in fact, criminally insane.</p><p>“I would never mistake a delusion for a gift from Jashin-sama, shit face!” the Jashinist un-impales himself and gets off the ground with a grunt.</p><p>His grin returns. “Jashin-sama is coming, asshole, and The Judgement will begin!~” Laughter echos over the empty plains, and even the battle-hardened athiest shivered and prayed that it <em>just wasn’t true</em>.</p><p>
  <strong>XxXxX One Year Later XxXxX</strong>
</p><p>This wasn’t an adventure.</p><p>Harry sighs, staring at nothing. The past year or so had been alright, if little more than one big hospital stay. He was no longer emaciated, but still rather thin, something he’d never be able to fix because of being starved from ages five to eleven, then every summer since Hogwarts started. Instead, he had filled out ever so slightly, enough that he couldn’t count his ribs. In addition, Harry was slightly muscled and had grown an inch or so, now reaching the height of five foot six. His skin was pale as porcelain, made paler by his wavy black hair that brushed his collar bone.His cheekbones were high and his vivid green eyes pupil-less and unfathomable in death. But, it wasn’t death, not really. Harry still breathed, still got hungry and tired and thirsty. So, he wasn’t dead, but his existence was empty, meaningless, expressionless. There had been no adventure, but…</p><p>There has been mystery.</p><p>Over the past year, several times a burst of… something had washed over him, at least once or twice a week. It was an emotion, for sure, but the Realm of Death muted feelings. Harry felt curiosity, and slight fear, as the only other time this happened was when Voldemort was feeling very intense emotions. Harry was sure Death knew, and felt… frustration? At least, he thought it was frustration. It was hard to tell. Either way, whenever he asked the trice-damned immortal, they would laugh at him, as there was no such thing as being a ‘Master’ of Death. You cannot control something so deviant and strange and true. Death can grant you immortality or release, but you are not it’s Master.</p><p>Eventually, Harry marched up to Death and said “I need to find out what, exactly, is going on. Will you help me, at least?”</p><p>Death smiled (a truly horrifying thing). “Of course, young master.” Death says mockingly. Harry grimaces, slightly annoyed. These emotions, especially negative ones, have been coming more and more frequently lately, which was disorienting after months of an emotionless void. It was… comforting in a way, if that makes sense. Better to feel something than nothing, right? “ I can transport you to the world these- emotions, wasn’t it?- are coming from, and give you knowledge of the language. Are you ready?”</p><p>“Now?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Alright.”</p><p>And, with that, the monochromatic background blurred and faded, giving way to a multitude of colors he had forgotten even existed. “Lovely…” Harry whispers, closing his eyes</p><p>
  <strong>XxXxX Konoha Eight years after the Kyuubi Attack XxXxX</strong>
</p><p>Naruto ran into yet another alleyway as the angry mob followed, howling for his blood. ‘Crap,’ He thinks, running into a dead end, blood running down his face and into his cerulean orbs. The villagers had already caught him once, and Naruto had barely escaped. The young child collapses against the wall, vision going hazy as the mob grew closer and closer. Then, a flash of light lit up the alleyway, revealing a young man in the finery of a noble man, with the black darker than night, darker than even death, and such stormy grays that Naruto could almost feel the winds and rain on his face.</p><p>The colors keep swirling, showing the tormented faces of the damned. However, the most noticeable thing about him was the aura of death that surrounded his slim form. The young man straightened up, emerald eyes empty and cold, black hair falling down to his shoulders in waves. As he surveyed the alleyway, the god (for what else could he be?) caught sight of Naruto and glared at the villagers, previously empty eyes becoming filled with a toxic fire.</p><p>
  <strong>XxXxX</strong>
</p><p>Catching sight of the beaten young blond cowering in the shadows, Harry is hit full force with an emotion for the first time in a long time. It was anger, with empathy as a faint undertone. The mob had stopped, as time had frozen the instant he had entered the alley, so Harry turned towards the young boy, reigning in his temper.</p><p>“What’s your name, young one?” Harry asks gently.</p><p>“U-Uzumaki N-Naruto, sir.” He stutters. Harry smiles without warmth, the boy was a mess, but at least he was making progress.</p><p>“My name is Harry,” the wizard responds.“Did they do this too you, Naruto-kun? Don’t be scared to tell the truth.”</p><p>“… Y-yes, sir.”</p><p>“Do you want me to hurt them for you, Naruto-kun?” Naruto freezes, uncertain. Did he want to hurt the villagers? ‘Well,’ the beaten boy thinks ‘, I’ve never done anything to them. Why do they hate me? They just do… Why do they hurt me? Theyhave no right to hurt me, I’ve done nothing to them.’</p><p>“Yes, Harry-san,” he responds without stuttering. Harry smiles again, this time more coldly, like a knife’s edge.</p><p>“Will do, Naruto-kun.” With that, time resumes, and the villagers continue to run before stopping, finally catching sight of the imposing figure Harry made.</p><p>“D-demon…” one says, backing away. Harry chuckles without humor, bloodlust rolling off of him in waves.</p><p>“Oh no,” he chuckles, remembering he enjoyed the feeling of laughter, “I’m much worse.” With that, Harry raises his hand and his fingers twitch, and all the villagers let out blood-curdling screams as their arms and legs twist in the wrong direction, bones breaking and bursting through the skin. In no time, the trash-strewn ground was soaked with blood, the air saturated with screams and the over-whelming sent of blood. As the screams dwindle into whimpers and moans, Harry turns to Naruto, who was frozen against the wall in fear and… awe?</p><p>“Wow, Harry-san, that was so cool! How did you do that! You just raised your arm and-“</p><p>“Ah, Naruto-kun, now’s not the time for questions, as people will start arriving very soon, and they’ll likely blame you.” Harry cuts in quickly, aware of the masked beings quickly approaching. “How would you like to come with me?” “What do you mean, mister?” Naruto cocks his head to the side, even as his mind begs him to close his eyes and sleep. Seeing this, the wizard kneels down and gently takes Narutos’ face into his marble-like hands, softly stroking his cheeks. “I mean live with me, Naruto-kun. I’ll teach you, train you, so you can so that you can defend yourself against people who would want to husrt you, like I did.”</p><p>“Really, Harry-san? Do you really mean it?” Chuckling, Harry nods and takes Naruto into his arms, dissolving into the shadows, his shark-like smile and eerie, glowing eyes, for the ANBU to see, finally arriving at the alleyway as the last of the villagers give their dying breath. New faces now adorn Harrys’ clothes.</p><p>His adventure was finally beginning.</p><p>
  <strong>XxXxX Akatsuki Hideout XxXxX</strong>
</p><p>Hidan feels a pulse, seductive and dark and powerful, stinking of blood and pain, and grins. “Jashin-sama,” he breathes, interrupting Kakuzu, who was giving a budget report to Pein during a meeting with the rest of the Akatsuki present.</p><p>“What was that, Hidan?” Pein asks, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>Hidans’ grin broadens to the point of insanity, and yells “Jashin-sama has risen, fuckers! The Judgement has begun!” The albino trails off into maniacal laughter, and they all shiver.</p><p>Kakuzu curses.</p><p>
  <em>“Fuck.”</em>
