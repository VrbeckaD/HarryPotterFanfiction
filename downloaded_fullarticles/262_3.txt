  <strong>Prologue </strong>
</p><p><span>The sound of silence filled her ears and smothered the gasp that threatened to leave her throat. It was the first reprieve from the sounds of bombs exploding against the ground, and wind screaming through the burning trees. But this was not a peaceful silence. The air lay heavy with pain and laced with death, leaking through their bunker door and whispering of the horrors that lay outside. Alice pulled her daughter closer to her. Her daughter, Lila, stared at her with wide eyes, her soft lips parted, and squirmed to find and hold her hand. “It’s alright, </span><em><span>mein schatz.</span></em><span>” she crooned softly, holding back the shakiness from entering her voice. “Our </span><span>Führer</span> <span>has told us we will be safe.” The woman desperately hoped it was true, but doubt leaked into her thoughts like static in the middle of a radio newscast. But she knew her faith should lie in the man who had raised Germany from its ashes and led them into a new age, full of light and promise, free from the pain they had endured after the first world war. Her heart filled with pride as she glanced at her own daughter, a girl with blue eyes like the sky and hair as blonde as the sun that shined on their new nation, the perfect Aryan that should have grown up in the world their </span><span>Führer had</span><span> envisioned for them. But her heart wept again as she remembered the bombs outside and the bodies of those that hadn’t been able to make it to their shelters. The bunker was locked and sealed tight, but she still thought she could smell the scent of human flesh burning and hear the phantom screams of her countrymen and she shuddered at the thought that that could have been her and her child. </span></p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The mother was jarred out of her thoughts by the sound of the hard knocks on the door. </span>
  <em>
    <span>THUMP THUMP THUMP.  </span>
  </em>
  <span>Terror grew within her and she silently prayed to God that it wasn’t the Russians coming to kill her and her child. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Or worse</span>
  </em>
  <span>, she thought.</span>
  <em>
    <span> I’ve heard what they do to German women and children</span>
  </em>
  <span>. In the dim light her eyes focused on the door that lay 5 feet in front of her, and she strained to listen to the garbled voices that seemed to bark at each other, as if deciding what to do. </span>
  <em>
    <span>English</span>
  </em>
  <span>, she thought. She knew some English from her days as a schoolgirl, struggling to learn the hard language that was filled with so many rules and contradictions. It hadn’t mattered until now, especially as they grew to pride the German language as being the superior one, but it served her well as she vaguely made out a few words that they seemed to be saying.</span>
  <em>
    <span> Locked, </span>
  </em>
  <span>one shouted. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Someone… in there, </span>
  </em>
  <span>another called back. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Find… opening!, </span>
  </em>
  <span>the one(that seemed to be in charge), responded, his voice cutting through the darkness and making her choke on the air. Lila reached up to rest her palm on her mother’s cheek, and as she withdrew it, her eyes shone with confusion and sorrow. “What’s happening, </span>
  <em>
    <span>Mama?</span>
  </em>
  <span>”, she whispered, conscious of the men outside and lowering her voice in panic. “Nothing, Lila. Everything will be alright”.  She thanked God that they had the forbearance to take the time to hide the opening of their hideout; it may be what saved them in the end. But still, they might have little time, so she had to be quick. The mother knew what she had to do. And she was determined to find the strength within herself to do it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Fumbling around frantically for the pouch that held her secret and her soon to be saviour, her hands soon closed around the small pack, brown with frayed edges and worn tassels. She drew up the top, and plunged her hand through to grasp the small plastic tabs that were held inside. Her fingertips grazed the tops before she plucked them out, and she winced as the hard edges of the material dug into her thumb. Holding them close to her chest, the mother silently sent up a third prayer, and closed her eyes momentarily before opening them to stare at the two violet “sleeping” pills that lay on her palm, encased in a thin plastic. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Such dangerous things for such little security</span>
  </em>
  <span>, she mused. She started to open the small packages, and began to silently motion for Lila to hold out her hand, when another noise rang out. </span>
  <em>
    <span>THUD. </span>
  </em>
  <span>Her terror came back tenfold and she felt her hands start to shake violently, but she was determined, determined to complete her last final act as a good mother, determined to not let her baby go to the enemy, that would rape, torture, and kill… </span>
  <em>
    <span>Nien!</span>
  </em>
  <span> She shrieked as the door burst open and English soldiers came flooding in. Two rushed to grab her, one holding a rifle in his hand and the other wearing the pin of a captain, both wearing shocked looks on their faces. She didn’t want to live long enough for their shock to turn into vengeance or malice, or feel the pain of her baby being taken away from her, but she had to take care of her child first. She tore her eyes from their faces and lunged to give the pill to Lila and watched as her daughter, her beautiful only daughter close her hand around the violent capsule and saw as her confusion turned into understanding, and then anguish, before finally settling onto acquisition. She silently thanked her baby for being so strong, and taking advantage of the soldiers confusion, urged her to take it and swallow. She watched as her daughter slowly- </span>
  <em>
    <span>not fast enough!</span>
  </em>
  <span> raised her palm to her mouth, and tipped her head back before she saw the butt of an English rifle slam into her hand and knock Lila to the ground. The mother screamed. Like a rabid dog, she leaped from where she was sitting and attacked the officer, scratching and hitting, trying to claw his eyes out before crawling away and trying to retrieve the pill that had been scattered 10 feet to the side. The officers, who had been shocked into stillness, were now moving towards her, and then they were upon her, all while Lila watched with mounting horror and disbelief. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“NIEN”! She shrieked again, “NIEN! NIEN”!</span>
  <em>
    <span> I won’t let you take us! </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span> She reached her arm back, struggling at her knees, to try and reach one of the men’s weak spots, and then… she vaguely heard a thud and heard a sound echo from someone’s mouth that she knew was hers but sounded distinctively wrong. The mother slid to the ground and closed her eyes. After that, there was nothing but darkness.  </span>
