    <p>It started with a rumor.<br/>A stupid little rumor.<br/>Not even one of those whispered ones <br/>that you'd hear in passing.<br/>Or one that's been around forever, that would be <br/>told around campfires.<br/>It was one of those rumors that start with the words 'get a load of this crap!'.<br/>Just a stupid rumor.<br/>Because if there is one thing that Hogwarts has more than enough of, it's rumors.<br/>Many of which were rooted at least to a certain degree in reality, as many, <br/>many years of students exploring the seemingly endless parts of the castle and it's grounds.<br/>Nothing should ever be discarded as 'too unbelievable' in this school.<br/>Because there might always be something to it.</p>
<p>That very thought was what made Ginny Weasley try her best not to get caught running through empty hallways, <br/>and out the gate into the night.<br/>She almost ran into people once or twice, but thanks to a few nifty little tricks she picked up over the years living with <br/>Fred and George, she successfully avoided all of them.<br/>The fact that she did the same thing for the last few days already might also have helped.</p>
<p>For almost two weeks now Ginny spent chunks of her nights by scaling Hogwarts´ vast grounds, looking for the rumored place.<br/>At first she only did it out of curiosity, but night after night of not finding it, her competitive nature came through. <br/>She couldn't stand having a goal in front of her and not reaching it.<br/>After a while her search was more to satisfy her own ego than her curiosity.</p>
<p>Over time she had gathered all the scraps of information she could find, and compared it all.<br/>As with any rumor out there, there were a lot of different versions, conflicting bits, and added parts over the time.<br/>She did her best to weed out what she thought was useless, and concentrated on parts that came up more often.<br/>She had narrowed it down to a few possible locations, and was now checking them one at a time. <br/>She had already crossed most of them off her list, and it bothered her to no end that she didn't find anything yet.<br/>She was sure that there was something to this rumor.<br/>It was way too persistent to be a fluke.</p>
<p>It took her a fairly long time, but she finally got to another one of her written down destinations.<br/>It was a small clearing at a far off corner of the forbidden forest, the only thing making it at least somehow stand out was an old <br/>tree that looked like someone took out their anger on it.<br/>Holes, tears, and a few torn off branches scattered around.<br/>Apart from this, the clearing looked like many others like it.<br/>Ginny took a few moments to rest, looking around her trying to find out where to go next.<br/>She decided to head farther away from the castle while keeping to the edge of the forest. Ginny was curious, not stupid.<br/>After probably ten more minutes of more or less aimlessly wandering around, she came to a sudden halt.<br/>A part of the rumor that she dismissed before, as she only heard it once, was that it was near to a boulder that was shaped like a rough pyramid.<br/>Right in front of her was a big rock that looked exactly like that.<br/>Ginny´s heart started pounding.<br/>Could it be? Could she really have found the place she was looking for all those nights?</p>
<p>Slowly she walked past the boulder, trying to calm herself, and to keep her hopes down.<br/>It was, after all, a rumor, and could very well be a coincidence.<br/>Or, for all she knew, it could be a stupid prank from someone who hoped to inherit her brothers´ place as the school´s jokester.<br/>All that doubt was swiftly gone when she rounded a huge mulberry bush, to find something that looked like a cave made out of trees.<br/>The treetops all bent to the side, forming something akin to a roof, while lots and lots of bushes between the trunks formed walls.<br/>Ginny could not decide if it looked purposefully created, or grown naturally.<br/>But she did not care to think about it anymore.</p>
<p>On the far end of this tree-cave she saw what she was looking for.<br/>She was about to cry out in triumph when she remembered where she was, and at what time.<br/>“Better not make too much noise”, she thought to herself.<br/>She did not think anyone would hear her out here, but better safe than sorry.<br/>In front of her was something that looked like a field of branches growing out of the ground.<br/>As the rumor said, they looked kind of like hands…<br/>It would have been pretty creepy if it weren't for the different colours of wood, making them look more like art projects.<br/>Ginny had no idea if those things were actually grown like this by someone, or if they were just naturally growing around these parts of the forest.<br/>And she did not care.<br/>She was way too fascinated with everything.<br/>Seeing that the rumor was true, or at least the part of the “hand-field” being here, made everything worth so far.<br/>Now the question was, if the rest was true as well...</p>
<p>She took a stick and held it up to one of the hands. When nothing happened she let the stick touch it´s “palm”<br/>Very slowly the fingers started to move, slightly clasping down on it.<br/>That was kind of what she heard, though it seemed like time had over exaggerated the story a bit.<br/>Ginny tried the same thing with a few of the other hands, all with the same sluggish reaction.<br/>That was kind of disappointing.<br/>She spent the next few minutes examining everything, having a bit of fun by placing random objects on the palms, watching the hands <br/>grab them slowly, and then pulling them back.<br/>But after a very short while that got pretty boring.</p>
<p>Ginny was about to get up and leave, when she brushed one of the hands with her own.<br/>A loud shriek escaped her mouth when it almost instantly clamped down on her wrist, holding her firmly.<br/>Surprised Ginny spun around and looked at it.<br/>That wasn't sluggish at all. And the grasp was way tighter than before, though it didn't hurt, thankfully.<br/>She tried to get the fingers to open with her other hand, but they wouldn't budge.<br/>Annoyed she went for her wand, but before she could reach it another hand stopped her, holding her other wrist.<br/>Ginny tried her best to remain calm, but struggling against wooden hands didn't really feel like a situation one could stay calm in.<br/>A second later she felt more hands. She looked down only to see two more grabbing her ankles, and another one near her knee.<br/>She wanted to scream for help, but a hand shot up to her mouth, keeping her from it.<br/>Ginny cursed herself. Why did she do this? Why did she enter Hogwarts´ most dangerous place on her own, looking to <br/>prove a stupid rumor true?<br/>A rumor about… wait!<br/>Ginny, although still unable to move much, and in the grasp of some strange plants, managed to calm her nerves a bit.<br/>If the rumor was true so far, maybe the rest was as well?<br/>Her heart pounded, but now rather than pure fear there was excitement mixed in.</p>
<p>The hands that held her didn't grab tighter, they just held her in place.<br/>Others seemed to move slowly towards her. They seemed to grow longer in order to get near.<br/>Now she would see if she was in terrible danger, or if the stories were true…<br/>A hand brushed over her thighs. Another seemed to caress her butt.<br/>Ginny exhaled sharply through her nose.<br/>It was true. The field of pervy hands was real!<br/>Her excitement grew.<br/>As if they noticed, the hands grew bolder.<br/>One ripped through her cloak, exposing how little Ginny was wearing underneath.<br/>If today would have been a bust again, at least she'd have masturbated under the stars, as always. But that didn't seem necessary today.<br/>Another hand wandered over her breasts. The surprisingly smooth wood felt really good.<br/>She made a surprised noise that was muffled by the hand that still covered her mouth, when the other one pinched her nipple.<br/>The way these wooden hands behaved didn't feel plant-like at all.<br/>One kneaded her buttcheeks, another one played with her nipples, while a few caressed her whole body.<br/>She felt them all over her pale skin. They played with her, gently, while holding her firmly down.<br/>Moments later one ripped off her panties, which were already soaked.<br/>Two of the hands massaged her inner thighs that glistened in the moonlight that shone through the leaf-roof.<br/>Forgotten was Ginny´s fear, the whole situation turned her on way too much.<br/>She often fantasized about being played with by someone, and now it seemed like that fantasy was coming true.<br/>Though instead of a hot headed hunk´s hands she was now in many, many hands that would have their way with her.<br/>Her head jolted upwards when she felt a stinging pain on her backside.<br/>She just got spanked…<br/>The other hands still caressed her, almost carefully, when she felt another slap.<br/>And another. And another.<br/>Ginny couldn't do anything but let it happen. But she also didn't particularly mind…<br/>By now it was completely impossible to tell how many hands were on her. It felt like every inch of her body below her <br/>neck was covered in them, yet they all had enough space to move, caress, pinch, and explore her.<br/>Then she finally felt it; One of the hands extended a finger, touching her wet outer lips.<br/>Ginny moaned, only then realising that the hand that had covered her mouth was gone.<br/>But she didn't scream. Didn't try to fight back.<br/>Ginny enjoyed.</p>
<p>One finger. All it was was one finger that played with her pussy. <br/>Not even that, it played around her pussy.<br/>But it made her almost go insane.<br/>Every other hand seemed to know exactly what to do, where to go, how to push her buttons.<br/>Ginny had never been so aroused in her life, and she tried quite a few things over the past months.<br/>Those hands did everything right, and more.<br/>But all she could focus at the moment was that one finger that refused to enter her.<br/>“Come on, come oooon nn…”, she moaned, hoping it would finally stop teasing her.<br/>And it did. But not the way she hoped.<br/>The hand pulled back.<br/>“You gotta be KIDDING me!”, Ginny hissed.<br/>The other hands kept going.<br/>Her breasts got much attention, getting kneaded, lightly slapped around, her nipples pinched, stretched, played with.<br/>The hands on her ass were equally busy, massaging, occasionally spanking.<br/>It felt amazing.<br/>Those hands played with her whole body.<br/>Tingling sensations all around, fingers gliding over her silky skin, caressing her, claiming her.<br/>But only on the outside.<br/>She needed more.<br/>Her excitement grew, but it could not overflow like she would have wanted.<br/>She needed something in her pussy.</p>
<p>The finger came back.<br/>“Oh, thank god…”, she sighed.<br/>Two fingers were on her pussy now. But instead of finally entering her, they only spread her lips.<br/>Annoyed Ginny looked down, and her eyes grew wide.<br/>Between the sea of hands there was something else.<br/>Something else grew out of the ground.<br/>It did not have the same handshape as the rest. <br/>It basically didn't have a shape at all.<br/>A long, smooth piece of wood with a rounded tip was right in front of her pussy.<br/>There it stopped, perfectly still.<br/>All the hands on her body stopped in their tracks as well.<br/>Nothing moved anymore.<br/>Ginny was confused. Then her body reminded her of her arousal.<br/>She tried moving, tried to get any kind of response, any sensation at all from the hands.<br/>She wanted them to grope her more.<br/>But they all were perfectly still.<br/>“No, no, nonono no…”, she quietly pleaded. “You can't stop now!”<br/>She tried shifting her weight, tried anything to at least rub on some of the hands, but to no avail.<br/>“Come on! Do something!”, she barked.<br/>No reaction.<br/>She felt a breeze over her mostly naked body, cold on her dripping wet pussy.<br/>Her dripping wet pussy with a wooden dildo, that was supposed to move, in front of.<br/>“Move, you piece of firewood!”, she shouted in desperation.<br/>“Come on and fuck me!”<br/>As if that was all they had waited for, everything suddenly started to move again.<br/>A surprised cry changed into a loud moan when the thing entered Ginny.<br/>It slid in without much resistance. It filled her completely.<br/>Then it pulled back, just to thrust in anew.<br/>“God yes, YES…”, Ginny moaned, not caring about keeping quiet anymore.<br/>There was no way she could keep quiet.<br/>Hands all over her body played with her, caressed her, letting her arousal grow, and now finally something gave her <br/>the sensation she needed to get over the top.<br/>After only a few thrusts she felt it rise in her.<br/>The warmth grew, the excitement rose, and her whole body shook at last, as she finally climaxed.<br/>If someone was nearby they´d definitely heard her.<br/>But she didn't care. Her moans just kept coming, just like her.<br/>Wave after wave of pleasure went through her, accented by the hands playing with her breasts, her ass, her whole body.<br/>The wooden member kept sliding in and out, slowly, in rhythm with her pleasure.<br/>After a while all of the hands slowly retreated from her body, only holding her enough to make her safely sink to the soft, <br/>moss covered forest floor.<br/>Exhaustedly panting she stayed there for a while.</p>
<p>That was worth it. Worth the time and effort.<br/>Worth finding ways to ask people about the rumor without seeming to interested.<br/>Worth the time spent comparing notes, trying to make anything out of it, and finding this place.</p>
<p>After what felt like an eternity, Ginny slowly rose to her knees.<br/>The hands were still again, a small distance away from her, just like when she found them.<br/>The wooden dildo nowhere to be seen.<br/>She had found the rumored place. She had uncovered the secret.<br/>But no one needed to know…<br/>Ginny grinned to herself. She wouldn't tell anyone about it.<br/>Hell, she´d deny having ever heard of it, if she were asked.<br/>But she'd come back. She would definitely come back…</p>
