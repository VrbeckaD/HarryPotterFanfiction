  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>I assume your participation on this site was also due to a bet?</span>

  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>I wouldn’t call it satisfaction</span>
</p><p class="p1">

  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise:</em> And you do? Having systematically forced a social experiment on the people looking for it?</span>

  <span class="s1"><em>prongs:</em> Love and science CAN go hand in hand, you know</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs:</em> But no, I don’t really either. It’s why (until now) I stayed far, far away from this lies perpetuated by this site</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise:</em> Then it’s a shame your abstinence was destroyed by Russian nesting dolls</span>

</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>I seem to have gained a grudging respect for you</span>

  <span class="s1"><em>prongs:</em> I’d tell you, but then I’d have to kill you</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs:</em> Suffice it to say it was bestowed upon me by the same friend whose ill-advised bet sealed my fate on this site</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs:</em> For reference, he dubbed himself “Padfoot”</span>

</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>THAT’S WHAT I SAID</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>No, because he’s “subtle AF” and would make “a fantastic spy”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>Note the sarcasm pouring from my orifices</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>Let’s put an unyielding ban on the word “orifices”, shall we?</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>It just seemed appropriate</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>This IS a dating site, after all</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise:</em> You’re not here to date, hon</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise:</em> Although, come to think of it, “Prongs” is a bit explicit, isn’t it?</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs:</em> My other two friends are “Moony” and “Wormtail”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise:</em> Good God</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>Poor Wormtail</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs:</em> Right? Prongs isn’t THAT explicit</span>

  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>What are you doing right now?</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise:</em> Like, right now? Or like, figuratively right now?</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>Are you being arbitrary because you’re on the toilet?</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise:</em> Yes, actually</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>How’d you know?</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>Uncanny sixth sense </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs:</em> Also the cameras I’ve installed in your bathroom</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>If you could pick five songs to describe you, what would they be?</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>Nothing by Khalid</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise:</em> Let’s just get that out of the way</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>Thank God</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>Nothing against the man. I just…</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise:</em> I know, I know. Overhyped. Stultifying</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>I love you</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>You should’ve messaged me with THAT</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>It wouldn’t have worked. You’re pre-biased against love</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs:</em> But can you please impose your anti-Khalid wisdom on Padfoot?</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise:</em> Not sure it would stick</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise:</em> Unlike the sanitary napkin</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs:</em> HA</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>Okay, I’ve narrowed it down for you. Five Joni songs to describe you</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>A Case of You. Gallery. All I Want. Wild Things Run Fast. Conversation</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs:</em> That’s the weirdest mix ever</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs:</em> I might actually like you</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise:</em> Can a social experiment lead to love? For this starstruck couple, it did (NOT CLICKBAIT)</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>Whoa there, cowperson</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise:</em> I know you shouldn’t give your gender out online, but “cowperson” is too disturbing a moniker for me not to correct you to “cowgirl”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs:</em> Why shouldn’t you give your gender out online??</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise:</em> Ah</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>You clearly use he/him and were never warned about gender-discriminatory internet predators by your parents as a result</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>Rightly or wrongly, that’s how it goes</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs:</em> Oh</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs:</em> You’re right</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise:</em> Well, it’s nice to meet you, Sir Prongs</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs:</em> Likewise, Madam…?</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>“Pavedparadise” is a bit of a mouthful</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>Let’s go with “Katya”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>While we’re on the subject of Russian nesting dolls</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs:</em> Katya the cowperson</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise:</em> CowGIRL</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs:</em> cowPERSON</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs:</em> I have to say, you really shook things up with Wild Things Run Fast</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs:</em> That was legendary</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise:</em> Well, I’m a legendary gal</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise:</em> And you? Five Joni songs?</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>Both Sides Now, Big Yellow Taxi, The Circle Game, Carey, This Flight Tonight</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise:</em> The Circle Game?!</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs:</em> You can’t see me as a wounded, cartwheeling little boy?</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise:</em> Um…</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>Yes to cartwheeling, no to wounded</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs:</em> I am very wounded, Katya. Tragically so. There is a wound in me so deep and anguished that only a gentle Russian cowgirl can soothe its seeping mouth</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise:</em> Moratorium on the phrase “seeping mouth”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise:</em> Also, I’m not gentle</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise:</em> Nor am I actually Russian. Is calling myself Katya cultural appropriation?</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs:</em> Everything is cultural appropriation nowadays. And I don’t mean that in a negative way. But I do think you’ve gotta accept that sooner or later you’re going to commit some good old-fashioned cultural appropriation and make your peace with that</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>Peace made</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs:</em> That was fast</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs:</em> Okay, so—eternity</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs:</em> Discuss</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>I thought you said that was a no-no on this site</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs:</em> I’ve changed my mind</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>Also I’m bored out of my skull</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise:</em> I said I was scared of it already</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>And did not elaborate</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise:</em> Because you didn’t LET me! You said I was going to mess up your experiment</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>Now my experiment is hopelessly compromised by extended conversation with a subject and you should feel free to elaborate thoroughly</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>Regardless, I’m feeling piqued</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>Katya, piqued, scowls into the middle distance</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise:</em> Prongs regretfully acknowledges the inadvisability of piquing Katya</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs:</em> There is no way “pique” can be used like that</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise:</em> *Prongs regretfully acknowledges the inadvisability of pissing Katya off</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs:</em> Actually, I don’t think you’re supposed to split up “pissing” and “off”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs:</em> Notice how I didn’t split up “split” and “up” :-)</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>ANYWAY</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs:</em> Right. Eternity</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>I’m not really scared of eternity because of preconceived notions about death. I’m just AWFUL when I’m bored, so I’m terrified for the effect my toxic boredom will have on the poor fuckers around me</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>The point of eternity is that there’s no one around you</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: …</em>No? The point of eternity is that it lasts forever</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>Touché</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise:</em> Also, I haven’t really done my religious duty. so I might get treated fairly badly</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs:</em> God would have to be a fool not to treat you well</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise:</em> Thanks?</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>I appreciate casual blasphemy if it’s done on my behalf</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>That’s what I’m here for</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>It’s story time</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>Ooh</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>So I’ve been working at a little bakery in my hometown for the past three or four years</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>Anyway, today I’d just opened the place up, and I was cleaning, and I looked up from the full-body process of wiping down one of our stupid tables—you have to kind of flop on your stomach to reach the end—and, lo and behold, there was an incredibly hot guy leaning against the counter. Watching me</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>Oh, it’s THIS kind of story</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>Just wait for it</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>Now, mind, I didn’t hear him come in. So my ass had been in the air for the last few minutes, waving around, and I was hoping desperately that he just happened to be gazing into the middle distance instead of at the massive target presented by my ass</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>Massive, you say?</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>Hush</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>He was definitely staring at my ass, though</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>But I’m a model employee, of course, so I was just like, “Can I help you?” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>And he smirked, eyeballed my unimpressive boobs (in my even more unimpressive XL work shirt!!!), and said, “Only if you need me to do a little more…RUBBING.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>What the fuck??!</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>That…</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>That doesn’t even make sense</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>It isn’t even the sort of come-on where you have to nod in admiration as you’re kicking his ass</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>(Speaking from the culturally appropriating and socially preferred standpoint of a guy, obviously)</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>So what did you do?</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>I kicked him out</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>Really? Do you own the place?</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>Nope. But the owner’s also a younger woman, so I figure she wouldn’t mind</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>He wasn’t even angry. I just told him to please take his business elsewhere, and he laughed all the way out the door</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>God. Damn</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>Sometimes I am flabbergasted by the pure stupidity of the human race</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>I’m particularly flabbergasted by how easily such stupidity can be concealed behind a pretty face</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>Can I get a better physical description of the guy? Like, was he Ryan Gosling level?</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>NO ONE is Ryan Gosling level, Prongs</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>But he really wasn’t bad</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>Six feet, skinny, dark messy curls, dark eyes, freckles</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>Ah, of course</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>A shame I wasn’t there to tell you: the freckles are always a giveaway</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>Freckles=small dick=big ego</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>I have freckles :-(</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>Girl edition: freckles=massive ass=unimpressive boobs</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>Hey!!!</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>But don’t worry</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>You’ve got a heart as wide as the open road ;-)</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>Do you get ALL your lines from bad country songs?</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>God; the more I think about that, the less sense it makes</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>The open road isn’t wide</span>

  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>What?</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>Where I’m from. Washington State</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>You’re not just supposed to admit that!</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>I understand that the gender thing is based on a faulty, sexist system of parental warnings, but surely SOMEONE told you not to give out your address online?!</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>The site does filter by location</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>So I already know you live in Washington, too</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>Western Washington</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>To be precise</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>Ugh</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>What’s the matter? Can’t handle my sleuthing capabilities?</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>Maybe you should be the one named Padfoot</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>Don’t tell Padfoot</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>I like Padfoot</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>A man worldly enough to name himself after a feminine product is always a friend of mine</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>I doubt Padfoot could identify a single feminine product if you put a gun to his head</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>…But surely? A tampon…?</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>Dubious</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>Can you see anything interesting from your window?</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>Why; are you out there?</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>Yeah, I’m the naked one</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>Which naked one?</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>Oh, you’d know ;-)</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>Quit it with the winky faces!!!</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>But yeah. I can. There’s this whole strand of beech trees, maybe twelve or thirteen of them, and they’re bending over almost to the ground. The wind just picked up</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>Anything else?</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>There’s a cloud that looks like a dick</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>With or without balls?</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>One ball</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>Ouch</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>What can you see?</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>Padfoot feeding the goats</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>You have goats?!</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>Are you one of those women who bypasses the physical and emotional qualities of a man in favor of his fondness for goats?</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>I don’t know how to answer that</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>Well, I hate goats</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>WHAT?</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>I’ll take yours!!!!</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>Padfoot loves them too much</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>Does he live with you, or does he just happen to be feeding your goats while you watch him from your window?</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>Lives with me</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>They’re his goats, really</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>He’s got a God-awful family. Old-money conservatives, which isn’t terrible in and of itself, I suppose, but they’re basically vampires on top of that</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>Physically abusive vampires</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>Set on extending the Trump administration for another fifty years through rigged lawsuits and ICE bribes</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>You’re going to give me nightmares</span>
</p><p class="p1">

  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>*Padfoot</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>That’s an odd name</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>I could probably figure your identity out from that, you know</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>*Figure out your identity</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>Keep your phrases together</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>Fuck you</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>I could, though. Search “Adopted brother of disowned Sirius”, or something like that</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>Yeah? Do you want to?</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>Not particularly</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>It IS a bit frustrating that your profile contains no information other than a Shutterstock silhouette and the praying hands emoji</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>What is that supposed to represent, anyway?</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>I’m your salvation, baby</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>That missed the mark so completely that I can’t find the energy to more accurately critique it</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>Where’s your lengthy bio, then? Where’s your profile picture?</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>You think I’d put my face up on a site like this?</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>I’m confused that your paranoia about Internet safety goes hand-in-hand with a presence on a dating site</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>We could just trade photos privately</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>We don’t need to. You already know I have freckles</span>

  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>Wow, because that’s definitely all I need to know</span>
</p><p class="p1">

  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>How many have you met?</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>Oh, I’ve encountered quite a few in my time</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>That sounds like false bravado to me. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>I bet you have freckles, because you’ve definitely got the small dick, big ego vibe going on</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>I don’t have any freckles, but I do have really obnoxious glasses that slide down the bridge of my nose</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>You do NOT</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs:</em> And I have a mole on my left earlobe</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>Like, on your earlobe?</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>Like, on my earlobe</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>Fascinating, I know</span>

  <span class="s1"><em>prongs: </em>Now you owe me two Katya Feature Facts</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>I have green eyes</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>Also, you’re right. I don’t have unimpressive boobs</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>pavedparadise: </em>They really don’t look good in the work shirt, though. I wasn’t lying about that</span>
