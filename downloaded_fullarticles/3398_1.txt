  <span>October 31, 1981</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James and Lily Potter were relaxing in the living room of their little cottage in Godric’s Hollow, comfortable and safe and sure that they would stay that way.  Lily held their sweet baby boy, rocking him back and forth as she sang lullabies into his ear. His dark skin, only a shade or two lighter than James’ own, contrasted sharply with her own, paler than ever after so many months inside.  Her green eyes looked down into his as they fluttered closed, his thumb in his mouth as he sucked on it sleepily. Crookshanks purred like a radiator against Lily’s calf, close to his favourite little human, whose tiny brown foot lightly brushed his fur as Lily rocked him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know we said we were going to go back to the manor when we came out of hiding, for the elves’ sake if nothing else, but what do you think about spending the summers here?” she asked her husband as Harry dropped off to sleep.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think that as long as I’m with you two, I’d be happy anywhere,” the Pakistani man responded, kissing his wife softly on the lips before leaning down to place a kiss on his son’s head, with hair so like his own.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Merlin, I love you so much,” Lily sighed, laughing at the idea of what her younger self would say to the idea of her being so sappy with James Potter, of all people.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My love for you could move mountains, my sweet Lily flower,” he responded, and she rolled her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re so dramatic,” she giggled softly, but before he could respond, the door was blasted off his hinges and they were looking into the narrowed red eyes of Lord Voldemort.  They looked at each other in a panic- their trust in Wormtail had been so complete that they’d left their wands upstairs, and now they had nothing with which to defend their son.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lily, take Harry and run!” James ordered, turning to his wife and ready to buy them as much time as he could for the price of his own life, wand or no wand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There will be no running tonight,” Voldemort hissed, stunning them both (and the cat) before they had a chance to move more than a few inches.  “No... there will be only death,” he sussurated, his voice nearly soft as he circled them, but with a quality that set their teeth on edge.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Excccccept,” he continued, his tongue drawing out the syllables in what James and Lily thought was an </span>
  <em>
    <span>affront </span>
  </em>
  <span>to parseltongue, to the way their sweet lad hissed to the snakes in the garden and offered them little bits of chicken from his own pudgy fingers.  “Except for you, little flower,” he finished, running a cold hand along Lily’s cheek in a mockery of tenderness. “I’ve been asked to spare you, and although the idea rankled upon me at first, I must admit the thought of keeping you alive after I’ve killed your husband and son in front of you brings me great joy after all the trouble you’ve caused me.  Death would be a gift in comparison, and Lord Voldemort does not give gifts.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’ll have to kill us both before you </span>
  <em>
    <span>ever </span>
  </em>
  <span>touch our son,” Lily spat, her mouth the only thing capable of moving.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m afraid, little flower, that you do not have a choice,” Voldemort laughed, his voice cold and high as he pointed his wand at Harry’s forehead, as the commotion finally caused the little boy to come awake.  “I think I will kill the child first, so that dear James’ final moments are the most painful of all.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They each struggled against the spells binding them in place, but to no avail- Lord Voldemort was at the height of his power, the loyalty of his many followers giving him great strength.  The young parents were terrified, not for themselves but for their child, but oddly enough the baby himself did not seem troubled. He was in mummy’s arms with daddy beside him, so the scary blue man did not seem quite a threat.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ba ba ba,” he gurgled, thumb still in his mouth. “Badadada!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, quit your begging,” Voldemort snapped, and Harry looked at him curiously- he </span>
  <em>
    <span>begged </span>
  </em>
  <span>mummy for biscuits and daddy for ‘up up!’ (when James picked him up and tossed him high in the air before catching him again and spinning him around), but he did not beg this blue man for anything, as the blue man had nothing he would want.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No beg,” Harry told him, seeming rather unimpressed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, I think you </span>
  <em>
    <span>will </span>
  </em>
  <span>be,” Voldemort sneered, moving to push away a lock of Lily’s red hair that was covering part of Harry’s face so that he had better access for the killing curse.  </span>
  <em>
    <span>That </span>
  </em>
  <span>was when Harry got mad- very, </span>
  <em>
    <span>very mad.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“MY MAMA!” </span>
  </em>
  <span>he cried- this man was not like Pa’foot or Unca Moony or his best friend Neville- this man wasn’t nice, so he </span>
  <em>
    <span>wasn’t </span>
  </em>
  <span>to be allowed to share Harry’s mummy like they were.  He reached out with one chubby fist to rip the wand out of the man’s hand, throwing it across the room with a clatter.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This made Voldemort so mad that he forgot himself- how </span>
  <em>
    <span>dare </span>
  </em>
  <span>the insolent brat try to stop his plans!  He tried to cast the killing curse wandlessly, and there </span>
  <em>
    <span>was </span>
  </em>
  <span>a great flash of green light, but it bounced off of Harry (who had had accidental magic before for things like summoning the biscuit tin or making the pretty orange lights that they’d set up for Halloween </span>
  <em>
    <span>zoom </span>
  </em>
  <span>around the house, but was now full of enough righteous toddler anger to make a little shield around him and mummy and daddy, not that he knew he was doing it) and back towards the scary blue man, who scattered into dust with a sort of </span>
  <em>
    <span>poof </span>
  </em>
  <span>as magic exploded around the living room, and Harry felt a sharp pain in his forehead as the unstable energies rattled the house.  Mummy and Daddy dropped to the ground, still breathing but deeply, deeply asleep, and Harry crawled out from mummy’s arms, putting his hands on both of them in turn as sections of the roof fell everywhere but in the circle around them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mama, dada,” he sang, poking them gently.  “Up! Up up </span>
  <em>
    <span>up!” </span>
  </em>
  <span>he prodded.  When they didn’t wake, his cries became more and more desperate, until suddenly Padfoot was there and he was holding Harry and he was crying.  They were about to leave to get help when Hagrid came, telling Padfoot to leave Harry with him, and although Padfoot didn’t want to, the big giant man promised Padfoot that he’d be okay and told him to go get the aurors while he went for Dumbledore.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Except Padfoot didn’t go to the aurors, and James and Lily still didn’t wake up, and that’s when everything </span>
  <em>
    <span>really </span>
  </em>
  <span>started going wrong.</span>
