          <div class="userstuff"><p>There was once a cozy cottage with a nice room, <br/>
Then during a bright full moon,<br/>
Ba-dump, ba-dump, ba-dump,<br/>
Something went bump, bump, bump.</p><p>Little Remus Lupin was sleeping that night,<br/>
When a monster broke in and took a bite.<br/>
Now every full moon, he turned into a wolf,<br/>
The Lupin family moved, unable to cope. </p><p>Years later, Remus Lupin moved back, <br/>
With his boyfriend, Sirius Black. <br/>
The cottage was small and quaint, <br/>
But Remus’ childhood room had a nightmare’s taint.<br/>
They closed and glamored the door<br/>
Of the room that Remus abhorred. </p><p>Their best friend was becoming a father <br/>
and the war was threatening the Potters. <br/>
The marauders agreed to protect those they loved.<br/>
Even if making the choice was rough. <br/>
They weren’t chumps, <br/>
Ba-dump, ba-dump, ba-dump,</p><p>As the Secret Keeper, Sirius had to hide, <br/>
But he would not sit quietly by<br/>
While his boyfriend was out persuading werewolves<br/>
Of people who are sympathetic to their woes.<br/>
Ba-dump, ba-dump, ba-dump,<br/>
Remus took a breath to show his heart’s thump. </p><p>Remus even faced his fear<br/>
And met with the monster that bit him, Fenrir.<br/>
“Lupin, Lupin, don’t you see? I can do so much worse to those you love.” <br/>
“I’m not a child anymore, Fenrir, I have nothing to be afraid of.” <br/>
Ba-dump, ba-dump, ba-dump,<br/>
He turned with his back straight and left with a “Hmph.”</p><p>Regardless, monsters on the full moon filled Remus’ nightmares<br/>
Of monsters on the full moon in the room there.<br/>
“Don’t worry, Moony,<br/>
Nothing is going to happen to me.”<br/>
Sirius reassured Remus every time,<br/>
Which developed from a chant into a paradigm. </p><p>Until one day a dog patronus <br/>
Appeared to Remus amid his business. <br/>
“Moony, we have to go. Wait. Fuck.”<br/>
His blood went cold, thinking this was the end of their luck.<br/>
Ba-dump, ba-dump, ba-dump.<br/>
There was no time left to slump.</p><p>Apparating to the cottage, <br/>
Remus feared his lover was taken hostage. <br/>
The place was in disarray, <br/>
Chairs were turned over, a smear of blood in the hallway. <br/>
His heart raced, the blood rushing in his ears, <br/>
His vision has narrowed to the path leading to the door he feared. </p><p>Ba-dump, ba-dump, ba-dump.<br/>
Something was beating heavily, making his blood pump.<br/>
The glamour was gone and the door was opened,<br/>
He leaned against the doorway and listened.</p><p>Ba-dump, ba-dump, ba-dump.<br/>
Maybe it was something that went bump.<br/>
Without looking in fear of finding his lover in a lump. <br/>
Ba-dump, ba-dump, ba-dump.<br/>
Remus charged in with a swing of his wand, “Stupify!” <br/>
And the room was empty with nothing for the spell to apply. </p><p>The walls were cream, <br/>
There was dust floating in sunbeam.<br/>
Instead of feeling cagey, <br/>
The room was quite ordinary.<br/>
Ba-dump, ba-dump, ba-dump, <br/>
Became thump, thump, thump,<br/>
From the trees beating against the cottage in the wind,<br/>
It was ridiculous enough to make Remus want to grin. </p><p>But until he can find Sirius, <br/>
He won’t let himself be careless. <br/>
Behind him was a loud CRACK!<br/>
And he turned ready to attack. <br/>
WHACK!<br/>
Remus’ fist connected with one Sirius Black.</p><p>“Dammit, Moony! THAT’S MY FACE!” <br/>
“I thought you were Fenrir, there was blood all over the place!” <br/>
“No, it was Prongs, he surprised me and I hurt myself getting to the Potters.” <br/>
“Is something wrong? Do we need to get the Order?” </p><p>Sirius smiled in sheer bliss. <br/>
He grabbed Remus’ face and pulled him in for a kiss. <br/>
“I’m a godfather!” <br/>
And Remus broke out in laughter. <br/>
“Why didn’t you start with that?!” <br/>
“Who cares, let’s get to where the party is at!”</p></div>
