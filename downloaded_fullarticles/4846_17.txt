    <p>It had started two weeks ago.<br/>
A sort of a shimmer. Something you wouldn't spot if you weren't observant of your surroundings enough.<br/>
It caught Draco's attention in glimpses, he'd only see the tail of it for a few vague seconds before it vanished completely, leaving Draco bewildered by the unknown sight dancing in the air. He didn't think much of it, it found it's way into his thoughts every now and then, but it was not much of a deal.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A few days later, Draco's curiosity grew, he found himself thinking about it more often and even questioning the strange sparkle in the air at random times. Curiosity getting the best of him, he started looking out for the shimmering-hovering-magical-phenomenon (quite the name he thought of) every where he went. He even started ditching Pansy in corridors, because he have sworn he saw a few particles glistening in the air a couple times. </p>
<p>Whoever was responsible for this strange, erm, <i>thing,</i> as he called it - was not very secretive, as he'd see it in the same part of the castle which contained numerous unused classrooms. On a gloomy Saturday, he'd walked through this very particular corridor (he wish he could say it was for his Prefect duties, though it was not.) when he spotted a bit of <i>’the thing's‘</i> tail again inside one of the abandoned, dusty classrooms.</p>
<p>Quickly thinking, Draco ducked behind a corner, getting a better view of whatever it was, inside the classroom. He watched it's tail dance around, until it came to a certain angle where he could see the whole thing and - oh my, it might have been the second most beautiful thing the blond had ever laid eyes on. (The first was himself, thank you very much.) His eyes widened at the sight, the realization of what this creature was dawning on him.<br/>
It was a <i>snake patronus.</i><br/>
Quickly thinking, Draco took it upon himself to make it a task to figure out <i>who in the bloody hell had a silver snake patronus, and befriend them instantly.</i><br/>
Snapping out of his own thoughts, he heard someone begin to do what sounded like packing up their belongings.<br/>
This was it.<br/>
This was Draco's chance to find out who was the right creator of this magnificent beast.</p>
<p>He hid behind the corner once more a bit better, not being too exposed.</p>
<p>
  <i>any second now....</i>
</p>
<p>A strangely familiar head of hair made it's way out of the classroom, not looking behind them - leaving Draco successfully hidden.. </p>
<p>
  <i>Wait..</i><br/>
<i>It's not..</i>
</p>
<p>Shocked and confused, the intrigued boy squinted to confirm his suspicions on who exactly was the person responsible for the snake.</p>
<p>Oh.<br/>
<i>Oh.</i><br/>
<i>It is.</i></p>
<p>Harry.<br/>
Fuckin'.<br/>
Potter.</p>
<p>
  <i>Splendid.</i>
</p>
<p>Still too baffled by the snake to process that this was Harry Potter, his rival since first year, Draco puts aside his enormous Slytherin pride and runs after the Gryffindor (who Draco learns is a surprisingly fast walker.)</p>
<p>"Potter."</p>
<p>Harry instantly turns around, wand lifted in hand, ready to defend himself from whatever he expected Draco to throw at him. </p>
<p>Draco raises his hands and surrenders.<br/>
“Oh <i>relax,</i> Potter. I don’t even have my wand on me - and I did not run after you to hex you with my bloody finger.” </p>
<p>Harry ponders this for a moment, and convinced by Draco’s words, he lowers his wand and asks, “So, what is it that you want, then?”</p>
<p>“Can you show me your patronus again? Er, this may sound weird, but I’ve seen it around the castle a few times over the past weeks and have been dying to know to find out who it belonged to.” He blurted out.</p>
<p>Harry, too baffled to speak (mostly because this was the longest conversation he and Malfoy had ever had that didn’t contain a single hex or insult), nodded and uttered the words “Expecto Patronum!” and with a flick of his wand, the silver snake had appeared in mid-air, filling up a once empty space, as gleaming and bright than ever.</p>
<p>Now it was Draco’s turn to be baffled. The snake was unlike any he’d ever seen before. It was very self aware, and elegant in it’s movements. Despite it being a mere patronus, it’s characteristics were quite remarkable for results of a spell.</p>
<p>“Potter has good taste.” He thought to himself, still staring at the snake, it's slithering motions mesmerizing him. “No wonder he can speak parseltongue.” </p>
<p>Draco, now acting like a little kid on Christmas, begins asking Harry a neverending amount of questions - some Harry can’t even answer.</p>
<p>
  <i>“Why is your patronus a snake?”</i><br/>
<i>”Do you have any fond memories with a snake“</i><br/>
<i>“Has it always looked this way?”</i><br/>
<i>“Can you speak to it?”</i><br/>
<i>“Does it have a name?”</i><br/>
<i>“Does it look like a snake you once saw in real life?”</i><br/>
<i>“Did you want your patronus to be a snake? I know I would.”</i>
</p>
<p>Harry is obviously overwhelmed, because:<br/>
A) He was being bombarded with meaningless questions<br/>
B) They were from Draco fuckin’ Malfoy<br/>
C) Draco. Fuckin. Malfoy.<br/>
<strike>Not that he was complaining, but he’d never admit that.</strike><br/>
At this point, Draco was still ranting - and Harry was on the verge of madness. </p>
<p>Eager to make the wide-eyed boy calm down, he asked, “OKAY, Malfoy - do you want to maybe sit down in the library for a bit? And we can talk all day about the depth and dimension of snake tails. I rather not do this in the corridor, considering I’ve been standing up for quite a few hours, practicing.“<br/>
Draco pondered this for a moment. <i>’He said ‘all day.’ Of course not! I WILL NOT WASTE my ENTIRE day with Harry Potter!‘</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Alas, his tongue seemed to disagree with what his mind had to say.</p>
<p>“Hmm, why not? Perhaps you could teach me some basic parseltongue.” </p>
<p>
  <i>Oops.</i>
