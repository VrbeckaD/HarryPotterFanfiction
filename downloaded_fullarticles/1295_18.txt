Lily said as she exited the changing room to show off her newest selection. The deep blue-green of the bikini brought out the green of her eyes, but what she really liked was how the cut showed off the majority of her soul mark, despite how the dragon was now so big that it took up most of her back. The deep green of the dragon's scales looked almost black against her pale skin. Her soulmate gave a low whistle of appreciation.</p><p>"That bikini is great, Evans," Sirius replied with a lewd grin, "but don't you think that's more my color?"</p><p>She frowned disapprovingly at him, even though she knew that he was teasing. This was a game they often played. If you really wanted to call it a game at all, because with both of them sharing a color palette and Sirius' genderfluidity, they did tend to share outfits. Thank god for magic and resizing charms or all her clothes would be stretched out by now!</p><p>"I don't think you have the chest to pull this off, sweetie," she replied. She twisted to examine her reflection from a different angle. "I just think my ass is too much in this."</p><p>"But it is such a nice ass!"</p><p>"That does not mean that I want everyone staring at it!" Lily turned to face him fully. The ivy of his own soulmark shifted along his neck and clavicle as if moving in a breeze. She stepped closer, making his breath hitch, and shifted the fabric of his shirt to reveal just a bit more. He settled his hands on the bare skin of her waist.</p><p>"I promise not to stand next to you, if that helps."</p><p>"How is that supposed to help?" she asked as she leaned in to kiss one of the leaves of his soulmark. Seeing it flourishing like it had now made her so happy. When they had first gotten together, it had been nothing more than a withered seedling. Most soulmarks started out as young versions of themselves, ready to grow with a relationship with a soulmate, but she had never heard of one looking so close to death. It had taken a lot of work to nurture the tiny seedling into the thriving vine it was now.</p><p>"People won't compare our asses that way," Sirius teased. In retaliation, she pulled back cast a wandless and nonverbal <em>aquamenti</em> at his shirt. He pouted at her and shook his finger at her in reproach. "You make me so mad sometimes."</p><p>"I do?" she asked innocently. She kissed his soulmark again, relishing in how he allowed it despite what he had just said. “Well, I know I’m, like, your least favorite person in the universe right now, but I love you.”</p><p>"That's because I'm so damn lovable."</p><p>"Damn straight," Lily agreed. Sirius grinned at her.</p><p>"Haven't you heard?" His grin was particularly toothy. "<em>Nothing</em> about me is <em>straight</em>."</p><p>"Really?" she asked in mock surprise. "Me, too!"</p></div>
