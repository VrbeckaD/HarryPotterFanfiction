    <p>On the second day of creation, God created the heavens and the Earth and upon this day the angels were created as helpers to God to serve with needs of creation, protect the mighty kingdom in heaven and also to protect the ones God would create on the sixth day who would be made in the image of the Almighty. They would be called humans. </p><p>But this is not a story about all the angels. We would run out of paper and there is not a computer screen big enough in the world to hold that tale. So we will stick to the one angel who has not been named yet. </p><p>Like all of creation, this angel was born pure and with a clean slate being whatever it was of his own choosing he wanted to be within limits of course. This angel was assigned to be a Principality based on his skill set, powers and body type. They have the patience to help guide those on the path of righteousness and all that is holy, loyalty to help protect those in need, inspiration to create and lay the groundwork for art and science, and of course great listening skills to carry out orders from angels above them. </p><p>He opened his blue eyes and felt the blonde curls upon his head. The feeling around him was one of warmth and protection. He knew no violence or evil. There was only bliss and purity. This would not last for long, however. But more on that later.</p>
