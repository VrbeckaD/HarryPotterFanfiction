  <em>What if, you and I were meant to part ways, only so that we could find each other again.</em>
</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p align="left">Emmie MacKenzie stared at herself in the full-length mirror in her room, scarcely believing that this day had finally come. It felt like it was ages in the making, almost. And a desperately needed win after everything that had happened the last few years, in her book.</p>
<p align="left">Her long strawberry blonde hair was pulled up into a ponytail and she was dressed casually - she’d change into her practice kit as soon as she arrived at the stadium anyway. But still, there was something different about the 22-year-old face that was staring back at her in the mirror. </p>
<p align="left">It was her eyes, she decided. There was a hint of something in them that hadn’t been there before. Granted, after the last couple of years, she figured everyone had a hint of something to them that wasn’t there before. She wasn’t any different from everyone else in that regard.</p>
<p align="left">Yes, she had taken Cedric’s death in the Triwizard Tournament particularly hard - even though they had broken up two years before that, they had stayed good friends. He had even written her a few times during the festivities and seemed sure that he would win or at least come in second behind Harry Potter. That was as good enough a win for him, he had said at the time. Though Emmie could tell he desperately wanted to win. But everyone had taken his unexpected death hard. Everyone in Hufflepuff, at least. Oliver hadn’t quite understood why she was upset for so long, though part of that was alleviated when everyone’s suspicions behind his death had been confirmed a year after when Voldemort revealed himself in the Ministry of Magic.</p>
<p align="left">She supposed Cedric’s death had been the beginning of the downward spiral for her and Oliver as well, though it was later exacerbated when the war started up in full swing. </p>
<p align="left">Emmie shook her head, pushing Oliver out of her mind. The last thing she wanted to think about today was her ex-boyfriend - they <em>had</em> been broken up almost two years now. Though it had proven hard after the Battle of Hogwarts. He had a way of sneaking into her thoughts more often than not since then, even though she had sworn to herself that she was officially over and done with him. That she wouldn’t give him another chance to hurt her.</p>
<p align="left">Sighing, she reached down and grabbed her team bag before walking out into the living room and kitchen where her best friend and roommate Kara was perched at the island, a mug of coffee in her hands. She was already impeccably dressed, ready to head off to her job in the International Magical Office of Law at the Ministry. While she had left during the brief reign death eaters had held over the Ministry, her former boss was now reinstated and had welcomed her back just after the battle with open arms. Helped that Kara had a knack for understanding and explaining complicated wizarding law.</p>
<p align="left">“How is the newest first-string chaser for the Arrows doing this morning?” Kara asked, a smile on her face.</p>
<p align="left">“Nervous,” Emmie said honestly, dropping her bag to the floor as she walked into the kitchen and made her way to the fridge.</p>
<p align="left">“Don’t be. You’ll be great,” Kara said.</p>
<p align="left">“I was beginning to wonder… spent enough time on reserves…” Emmie said, as she pulled out a container of fruit that she had cut up the night before. </p>
<p align="left">She had spent the last four years on the Arrows reserves team, wondering when or if she’d ever make first string. It had gotten frustrating, especially when the others on the Hufflepuff team had made first string rather quickly. Even Oliver had been put on Puddlemere’s first string his second season in. Emmie had started doubting her own abilities on the pitch there for a while. Still did to an extent.</p>
<p align="left">“Posh. We both know it was only because there were no open spots for forever,” Kara said, waving her hand in the air. “They gave you one of the better reserves contracts, after all. And it did keep you from transferring to the Pride when they offered a first-string spot a couple years ago. Trust me, Em. Arrows has wanted you on first string since they signed you and you wouldn’t be happy playing first string anywhere else.”</p>
<p align="left">“It took two chasers dying in the war for the spots to open up,” Emmie replied dryly, glancing at her.</p>
<p align="left">“Well… yes, that’s unfortunate, but today is about focusing on the future. You’re going to be the next greatest chaser in the League,” Kara said brightly. Emmie offered her a half smile. She appreciated Kara’s enthusiasm and attempts to cheer her up.</p>
<p align="left">In the months since the battle at Hogwarts, she seriously needed some good news and cheering up. They all did, really. They had gone back to fight. Seen things that no one should have to see. Emmie still had nightmares about the dead faces of her schoolmates. Death eaters gleefully killing at random. Her own brother jumping in front of a curse meant for her.</p>
<p align="left">But that was another thing that Emmie didn’t want to dwell on today of all days.</p>
<p align="left">“So… you’re finally playing first string on the Arrows. Life is returning to normal. Think you might be open to dating again?” Kara asked casually as she sipped her coffee. Emmie chuckled as she walked over to the island, her fruit and a fork in hand.</p>
<p align="left">“Seriously?” she asked.</p>
<p align="left">“I’m just saying… Karl asked how you were doing when I went home to visit this weekend,” Kara said, putting her mug down. Emmie rolled her eyes. Kara had been trying to set her up with her twin for the better part of a year now. </p>
<p align="left">“We’ve been over this. While I like Karl, I’m not interested in dating him,” Emmie said. </p>
<p align="left">“It’s not like he’s the worst bloke out there,” Kara said, defending him. “Sure he can be a bit dry, but he’s got a good heart. And he’s really opened up since we graduated. Not to mention, he’s loads better than Ol-” Kara shut her mouth quickly before she finished the name, knowing she had tread upon thin ice.</p>
<p align="left">Oliver’s name had been considered a curse in the flat since the battle - the man himself persona non grata. Emmie frowned as she stabbed at piece of fruit and then popped it into her mouth as she chewed angrily. </p>
<p align="left">Emmie still couldn’t quite figure out just when it was that things had changed. No, that wasn’t true. She knew why and how. She just didn’t understand it at all. They had two blissful years together before it all started to fall apart. She didn’t even recognize the man he had become.</p>
<p align="left">“I’d rather not get into that,” Emmie said after she had swallowed the fruit. </p>
<p align="left">“Right… sorry,” Kara said. Emmie looked down at her fruit, suddenly not so hungry anymore, but she knew that she needed to eat before practice so forced herself to eat as much of it as she could before returning it to the fridge.</p>
<p align="left">“Good luck today,” Kara said with a smile as Emmie walked over and picked up her bag again. </p>
<p align="left">“Thanks.”</p>
<p align="center">~~~</p>
<p align="left">Emmie stopped for a moment after she stepped into the locker room, taking it all in. A small smile came across her face as she looked over and saw a locker with “E. MacKenzie” on a small gold plate on it. Quickly making her way over, she opened in and relished the feel of her game robes before looking at her name and number on the back. On the shelf at the top, her practice uniform and workout clothes were carefully folded. She quickly dropped her bag and opened it, pulling out her pads that she carefully placed in her locker. They would do conditioning in the gym in the morning and move to working on the pitch that afternoon. For now, she just needed to put on her workout clothes.</p>
<p align="left">A bit of ruckus could be heard outside the room. Stopping for a moment she looked over her shoulder as a group of people made their way into the room.</p>
<p align="left">“There she is,” Thomas Fincher, her old quidditch captain from Hufflepuff, said as he walked over to her and pulled her into a crushing hug. Emmie couldn’t help but laugh. She was happy to have a familiar face on the team. He had been playing keeper for the Arrows for the last three seasons. He stepped back and looked over at the others. “Told you she’d be promoted soon enough.”</p>
<p align="left">“Yea, yea, we’ve heard it all before,” a tall blonde man said as he rolled his eyes slightly. He then held his hand out to Emmie, offering her a friendly smile. “Anthony Beauchamp. I’m center chase and captain.” Emmie smiled at him. It wasn’t as though she needed any introductions - she had known every Arrows line-up since the 80s. “Here we’ve got Niall Wickens and Roger Martins - beaters.” Two sturdy men smiled and nodded towards her. “And then that’s Taylor Bellweather - seeker.” </p>
<p align="left">“Hello,” Emmie said, waving. The slight woman with dark brown hair smiled warmly at her.</p>
<p align="left">“Nice to have another woman on the team,” she said, offering a wink.</p>
<p align="left">“Oi! I thought you loved us!” Wickens shouted, pretending to be hurt.</p>
<p align="left">“Gettin’ a bit on my nerves, actually,” Taylor said, still smiling. </p>
<p align="left">“And then here’s our other new chaser - Adrian Pucey,” Anthony continued. Emmie’s eyes widened as he glanced around the room slightly nervously before nodding.</p>
<p align="left">“Nice to meet you all,” he said before moving towards his locker which was conveniently next to Emmie’s.</p>
<p align="left">“If you need anything or anyone gives you rookies any trouble, you can always come to me,” Anthony finished. Taylor snorted as she looked over at him while pulling her hair back into a pony-tail.</p>
<p align="left">“Right… when have you ever helped anyone but yourself?” she scoffed. Anthony frowned.</p>
<p align="left">“Oh shut it, Bellweather,” he said, moving to his locker. Fincher chuckled from Emmie’s other side. “I expect everyone to be in the gym in 10 minutes!”</p>
<p align="left">Emmie nervously glanced at Adrian to her other side. She had heard rumors that the Arrows were trying to scout him from the Wasps, but hadn’t realized they had gone through with it. Must have offered him a good signing bonus as he had been playing first string with them for two years. She hadn’t really seen much of him since school, to be honest. And it wasn’t as though she was particularly friendly with him even then.</p>
<p align="left">“Doing alright, MacKenzie?” he asked after he pulled his shirt off, looking over at her. Emmie blushed slightly, not realizing that he had caught her looking at him.</p>
<p align="left">“Yea, I suppose,” she replied, quickly getting out of her own shirt and reaching for the soft tank top provided and slipping it over her head. “You?”</p>
<p align="left">“Yea, alright,” he said, pulling his own shirt on. Emmie couldn’t help but notice how fit he was. Professional quidditch had been very good to Adrian Pucey. </p>
<p align="left">Bloody hell, she needed to stop thinking that way. He was her teammate after all. And best friends with Marcus Flint. Though it was years ago, Flint still left a bad taste in her mouth. </p>
<p align="left">“Come on, Mac. Time to get started on your first day,” Fincher said, pulling her from her thoughts. Emmie nodded and quickly finished changing. </p>
<p align="left">This was it.</p>
<p align="center">~~~</p>
<p align="left">Emmie stretched a bit as the team sat on the benches in the locker room, waiting on the coach to come in for a final talk before they changed and headed home. A good sort of ache had settled into her muscles, one that told her she had gotten in a good workout. While she had been worried at the start of practice, she quickly found her groove and thought it went rather well. Coach Shackles had complimented her on her passing and even Beauchamp had looked impressed. Helped that both seemed keen on seeing what sort of tricks she could pull out for the season. She, Adrian, and Beauchamp would start working with the chaser coach tomorrow on more individualized training. </p>
<p align="left">Emmie, for one, was excited about that. </p>
<p align="left">“Alright team. Good practice, but we’ll need to take it up a few notches,” Shackles said as he walked in, a batch of parchments in his hand. He began handing them out. “We’re playing the opening match of the season against Puddlmere and that’s only a month away.” </p>
<p align="left">Emmie’s face blanched slightly as she looked down at the season schedule, seeing Puddlmere United written next to the Arrows at the top of the page. She hadn’t seen Oliver since the battle and wasn’t quite prepared to be playing against him so soon. Granted, if the reports were anything to go by from the summer training so far, she wouldn’t have much to worry about. </p>
<p align="left">“Now, Puddlemere is still ranked in the top 10, so we won’t go light on training. I want us to get off to a strong start, especially with our new players,” Shackles continued, settling his gaze on Emmie and Adrian. “That’s it. I’ll see you all bright and early tomorrow.” </p>
<p align="left">With that, the coach turned and left the locker room. The others stood and started to peel off their dirty practice robes and pads, while Emmie remained seated, going over the schedule. </p>
<p align="left">“Anything you can give us about Wood?” Wickens asked. Emmie looked up at him, seeing the dark-haired man grinning at her.</p>
<p align="left">“Not sure what good I could be,” she said, frowning slightly. She could see Fincher tense slightly out of the corner of her eye, already moving to stand behind her.</p>
<p align="left">“You were with him a fair amount of time. Sure there’s loads you know about Wood that we don’t,” Wickens said with a wink. Taylor punched him in the arm, glaring at him. Emmie smoothly stood, her cool gaze fixed on the beater.</p>
<p align="left">“Fairly sure there’s a lot of things that a lot of witches know about him now, if Witch Weekly is to be believed,” she replied dryly, turning to her locker and starting to get out of her robes. “Though from what I can tell, shouldn’t be that much of a threat.” </p>
<p align="left">The room was silent a bit before Wickens started laughing loudly. Emmie glanced over at him, slightly confused by his reaction.</p>
<p align="left">“Yea, I think you’ll fit in quite well with us, MacKenzie,” he said. Emmie noticed the twinkle in his eye and couldn’t help but smile back at him.</p>
<p align="left">“It’s Mac, by the way. Everyone calls me Mac,” she offered. The beater nodded and returned to changing. </p>
<p align="left">After she had stripped down to her sports bra and underwear, Emmie pulled on her shower robe and moved to the women’s shower room, following Taylor.</p>
<p align="left">“Wickens can get to be a bit much,” Taylor said to her, glancing over her shoulder as she finished undressing and turned on the hot water. “He means well, but… bit of a blockhead at times.”</p>
<p align="left">“It’s fine. Nothing I can’t handle,” Emmie said lightly. “Had some trouble with a bloke loads worse than that my sixth year and learned how to look out for myself.”</p>
<p align="left">“What’d you do?” Taylor asked.</p>
<p align="left">“Hexed him so badly he was in the hospital wing for two days,” Emmie replied with a grin. Taylor laughed loudly. </p>
<p align="left">“Oh, you will fit in nicely,” she replied. “But still felt I should apologize for him… bringing up your ex like that…” Emmie shrugged.</p>
<p align="left">“It’s been a long time now,” she replied. “Though I suppose I shouldn’t be surprised when it comes up… seeing his current notoriety…” Taylor gave her a sympathetic look.</p>
<p align="left">“I know how that can go. It’s why I vowed never to date in the League again,” she said with a sigh. “And I meant it. It’s nice to have another woman around. The lads are nice and all, but bring out a tampon or mention cramps and I might as well have the bloody plague.”</p>
<p align="left">“I was the only girl on Hufflepuff, so I guess I’m used to it. But yea, supposed it’s nice to have another woman around,” Emmie said, genuinely happy for a bit of female companionship in the locker room.</p>
<p align="left">“Yea, well, us girls have got to stick together,” Taylor stated matter-of-factly. </p>
<p align="left">“Too true,” Emmie replied. </p>
<p align="left">They continued on chatting about this and that, with Emmie deciding that she quite liked the seeker. Soon enough, she was finished showering and dressed, putting the last of her things in her bag. She had spent hours yesterday taking care of her broom, but thought it could use a bit of light maintenance when she got home. </p>
<p align="left">“Mac,” Fincher said, walking up to her. She straightened up, looking towards him as the rest of the team filed out of the room, the beaters loudly telling jokes as Beauchamp laughed. Adrian offered a silent half wave before he left. “Seems you had a good first practice.”</p>
<p align="left">“Yea, it’s a bit harder than reserves, but I’m up for the challenge,” Emmie said, smiling. </p>
<p align="left">“Course you are. Dare say you could be in the running for rookie of the year,” Fincher said. Emmie blushed slightly. “Good to see a bit of the old Mac is still there.” Emmie chuckled as she rolled her eyes. “If you need anything, don’t hesitate to ask.”</p>
<p align="left">“Thanks, Fincher,” she said. </p>
<p align="left">“How’s Alex?” he asked. The grin immediately fell from Emmie’s face at the mention of her older brother. Seemed today was the day of sore subjects, though she couldn’t blame him from asking. Alex had completely fallen out of public view since the battle and didn’t answer any of the owls sent to him, even her own. She still checked in with her mum every week, but it didn’t seem like he was coming out of his reclusiveness any time soon.</p>
<p align="left">“He’s, well… he’s got good days and bad days. Still more bad than good at the moment, but his healers think he’s making progress,” she said, looking away from him. “I don’t see him that much…”</p>
<p align="left">“Suppose it’s not been easy,” Fincher said, rubbing the back of his neck. Emmie shook her head, then reached down and picked up her bag.</p>
<p align="left">“Hasn’t been easy for anyone,” she said. </p>
<p align="left">“That’s true…”</p>
<p align="left">“Well… I should get going. Kara’s likely to want a complete rundown of everything as soon as I get home even though she still barely stands the sport,” Emmie said, pushing as much fake enthusiasm in her voice as she could.</p>
<p align="left">“See you tomorrow, Mac,” Fincher said.</p>
<p align="left">“Later…”</p>
