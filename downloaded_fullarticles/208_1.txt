    <p>It was the perfect plan, of that the Dark Lord was certain. Nothing could go wrong. By the end, he would have a perfect weapon at his disposal. A weapon that not even the Order of the Phoenix could control or thwart.</p>
<p> “Is it ready?” Voldemort asked Snape harshly, staring the Potions Master down.</p>
<p> Trying not to swallow in fear, Severus nodded, holding out a vial of a dark and swirling liquid. “Yes, My Lord. The potion is complete. If I may ask, My Lord, what is this potion to be used for? It’s rather unpredictable, and if used in the wrong circumstances it could have terrible consequences.” He barely resisted the temptation to flinch back as Voldemort turned, giving him a cold and bone-chilling look.</p>
<p> “No, you may not ask, Severus,” Voldemort hissed coldly, long fingers closing tightly around the potion vial and slipping it into the pocket of his robes. “It is none of your concern. You will know its purpose soon enough, as long as it works as you promised. If it does not…” he warned, tone deadly, “there will be consequences.”</p>
<p> Quickly Severus nodded, bowing low as he inched towards the door. “Of course, My Lord. I assure you, it will work as I promised.”</p>
<p> “Very good.” Voldemort nodded. “Go fetch Nagini.”</p>
<p> “Yes, My Lord.” Severus nodded and bowed again, hurrying out of the room.</p>
<p> Voldemort smiled, drawing the vial of potion from his pocket and studying it for a few moments before he called a house elf. “Bring me Potter.” The house elf nodded, disappearing with a crack.</p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>In the dungeons deep below Malfoy Manor, Harry groaned, opening his eyes as he heard a noise beside him, and immediately blinking in the dim light of his cell. Last he remembered he had been fighting with Draco Malfoy on the Quidditch Pitch, not another soul in sight, and now here he was. He sat up, blinking as the face of a smiling house elf came into focus next to him.</p>
<p>“Mr. Potter!” the house elf squeaked. “You must come with me.” It smiled and took Harry’s hand. There was the feeling of transport and then…nothing.</p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>In his room in Hogwarts Draco Malfoy lay curled up on his bed, a sickly guilt twisting through his stomach. His task was complete, yet he was still worried. It had been simple, really. All he had to do was get Harry alone, knock him out, and then slip him the Portkey to take him straight to the dungeons in Malfoy Manor. Everything had gone according to plan and Draco’s father had assured him that Potter would remember nothing of what happened. No one would know that Draco had a part to play in the scheme and no one would know that Potter was gone.</p>
<p>The Dark Lord had guaranteed that the entire ritual would take less than two hours and Harry would be returned to the school before anyone would notice that he was gone. Potter would think that he’d fallen asleep on the Quidditch Pitch and would have no idea what happened to him before it was too late. After this point the plan would no longer involve Draco. He wouldn’t be important.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To Draco, the Dark Lord’s newest plan to take down Potter seemed rather foolish. After all, if he had Potter in his clutches why on earth would he return him to Hogwarts? Draco, of course, had spoken to his father of these concerns, who then explained the Dark Lord’s reasoning. Killing Potter alone would not be enough to gain Voldemort the world. First he must destroy the Golden Boy’s image, eradicating all support for him. Otherwise Potter’s death would do nothing; the others would still fight against him. Voldemort would also gain something else that Potter’s death would never bring him: a weapon.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Potter as the Dark Lord’s weapon…Draco mused thoughtfully. But that would all depend on whether Potter would end up following the Dark Lord, something of which Voldemort was certain, but about which Draco wasn’t so sure. Even with the infection, Harry would still be Harry, right? Nonetheless, Draco couldn’t help feeling a little proud that he would have a hand in Harry Potter’s downfall.</p>
<p>           </p>
<p>Or that least, that’s what he kept telling himself, even as he jumped out of bed and rushed to the bathroom, vomiting in guilt.</p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry yawned as he awoke on the grass of the Quidditch Pitch, stretching out in the quickly setting sunlight. He felt sore all over, as though he’d been lying in one position for far too long, which, Harry supposed, must have been what happened. He distinctly remembered falling asleep in the early afternoon warmth on the pitch and he guessed he must have slept all afternoon. Harry got up, stretching his arms up, over his head, and groaned as his muscles popped pleasantly. In the dying daylight Harry made his way back up to the school, completely oblivious to the changes racing through his body.</p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>For a few days nothing happened and Draco began to grow worried. What if the plan didn’t work? Nothing like this had ever been attempted before and some of the Death Eaters were skeptical, but Voldemort was completely certain that the potion was sound. The only thing the Dark Lord was not certain of was exactly which creatures would appear in Potter and consume him. But they would be Dark, and that was all that mattered.</p>
<p>From what little Draco had been privy to pertaining to the Dark Lord’s plan, he knew that Harry had been infected with the blood of several Dark creatures. He only knew of the Vampire, Incubus, Werewolf, Banshee, and Undead, but Draco was certain that Potter had been infected with countless others. Which would dominate and take form inside of Harry, however, no one would know until the time came.</p>
<p>The first signs of Harry’s change started at breakfast a week and a day after he had been infected. The signs started…and they didn’t stop.</p>
<p>Draco was picking tiredly at his plate of eggs when commotion erupted across the hall by the Gryffindor table. Harry Potter had fallen out of the bench and fallen onto the floor; tremors wracked his body as he writhed and screamed in pain. Draco noticed how Potter seemed to be trying to crawl away from the morning sunlight spilling through the Great Hall windows and smirked. That was the sign of the Vampire infection taking ahold of Harry’s cells and mutating them.</p>
<p>When infecting Harry, Voldemort had assumed that using multiple creatures’ blood would give Harry the characteristics and dispositions of those different creatures. That was the first of many mistakes that the Dark Lord made.</p>
<p>Inside Harry, the power and strength of each creature were fighting those of the others (most of them natural born enemies) for dominance in Harry’s body. The blood of the Vampire quickly consumed the Undead virus, feeding off of Harry’s magical power. Although Vampires are born of blood, their power comes from that of the wizard. Therefore, the more powerful the wizard, the faster the infection would spread. That was the second mistake that Voldemort made.</p>
<p>Harry Potter was a powerful wizard, a very powerful wizard. The Vampire’s infection raged through his system, changing his body and consuming every other infection it encountered. Within moments the Banshee was devoured and the Werewolf soon after.</p>
<p>It took only moments for the professors to see something was going wrong, but by the time Dumbledore reached the Gryffindor table it was too late. “Don’t…don’t touch me!” Harry almost screamed as the Headmaster tried to pick him up. Where Dumbledore’s hand had touched him there was a searing pain, boring deep down into his soul. Still Harry struggled, inching painfully towards the doors. He had to leave, that was all he knew. He had to leave before the hunger consumed him and he acted upon it. From the corner of his eye he saw a blonde head look over at him, its owner rising to his feet. The hunger intensified, overwhelming him with need to consume what was his. Before Harry knew it, he was on all fours and leaping at Draco, not even hearing the five stunners that hit him before everything went black.</p>
<p>Draco was panicking. Nothing had happened, or at least that’s what Madam Pomfrey kept on telling him, and yet Draco was still panicking. He had been told to follow the professors to the hospital wing, lie down on a bed, and wait, though he wasn’t told why. Rumors had spread through the school like wildfire the moment Harry was whisked away to the hospital wing, most centered on the way that Harry had looked at Draco split seconds before he had gone down under the stunners. There had been complete and utter yearning and hunger on his face, as though he wanted to devour Draco.</p>
<p>But that wasn’t the only thing making Draco panic as he lay in a bed in the hospital wing, staring at a door set in the wall across from him, behind which he knew a newly created Vampire lay in wait. What was making Draco panic the most was how fast Harry had changed. From what Lucius had told him, whatever Voldemort did to Harry was supposed to change him slowly over the course of a week or two. The symptoms of each creature were supposed to show up little by little, not all at once.</p>
<p>The door of the hospital wing burst open and Draco jumped, sitting up to see his father striding through the doorway with Severus, Dumbledore, and McGonagall hot on his heels. “I’m sorry, Mr. Malfoy, but we cannot allow you to do this. Draco leaving the school at this time would be preposterous and uncalled for.” Dumbledore was saying calmly as Lucius stalked over to Draco’s side.</p>
<p>“Preposterous?!” the blonde man rounded on Dumbledore as his eyes flashed. “Uncalled for?! There’s a bloody vampire in the school and you dare to say it’s uncalled for for me to be concerned for my son’s safety?!”</p>
<p>The headmaster shook his head, expression still calm. “As of yet we do not know exactly what Harry is, Mr. Malfoy, but I can assure you that the situation is completely under control. We have Mr. Potter locked in a room warded for all the creatures that he may have been infected with.”</p>
<p>“Creatures?” Lucius asked, faking surprise. “What do you mean, Dumbledore?”</p>
<p>Dumbledore smiled slightly, eyes cold with restrained anger. “Well, Mr. Malfoy, Professor Snape has done some tests on a sample of Potter’s blood and has found traces of multiple Dark creature viruses in his system. The most prominent of these are currently the Vampire and Incubus, which Severus believes will in the end consume the other infections.”</p>
<p>For a few moments Lucius gaped at Dumbledore, the perfect picture of complete and utter surprise. “And how could he possibly have been infected by that many Dark creatures at one time?”</p>
<p>“Oh, I do believe that we both know his infection was deliberate, Lucius. What I want to know is how it happened and why, so the Ministry has been made aware of the situation at hand and I am going to do everything in my power to make sure that everyone involved in this is sent to Azkaban.” Dumbledore’s explanation was still calm, but there was a deadliness to his voice that sent shivers down Draco’s spine.</p>
<p>“Surely you aren’t implying that my son is somehow involved.” Lucius said, affronted. “He’s only sixteen!”</p>
<p>“No, I am not implying that Draco was involved.” Dumbledore shook his head, the twinkle that normally resided in his eyes gone. “I think that this was the work of Lord Voldemort.” He let the sentence hang in the air as he turned to Draco. “Mr. Malfoy, how are you feeling?” he asked gently, making Draco blink in surprise.</p>
<p>Swallowing, Draco found his mouth suddenly dry and it took him several moments to try and answer. “I…I’m ok-kay,” he murmured, biting his lip as he glanced across the room at the door again. “I’m actually not sure why I’m here, Headmaster.”</p>
<p>Dumbledore smiled, conjuring a chair next to Draco’s bed and sitting down, rather effectively ignoring Draco’s father. “Mr. Malfoy, what do you know about Vampires and Incubi?”</p>
<p>Draco blinked in surprise before thinking hard. “Well…I know that Vampires can’t stand sunlight, it burns their skin, and they have to drink blood in order to survive. As for Incubi…all I know is that they’re based off of desire and lust. I don’t know anything else.” </p>
<p>The Headmaster nodded. “Your knowledge is true, if incomplete. You see, Mr. Malfoy, a Vampire will have an…intended. I would use the word mate, except what a Vampire feels towards its intended will not be mutual, unlike the mating of Veelas. A Vampire’s bond with their intended is completely blood driven. They must drink their intended’s blood or they may die. Do you understand me, Mr. Malfoy?”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.” Draco nodded, chewing on his lower lip nervously. “But Headmaster, I still don’t see what this has to do with me.”</p>
<p>A shiver of horror ran through Draco as the Headmaster smiled at him, the irritatingly calm twinkle back in his eyes. “We have reason to believe that you may be Mr. Potter’s intended, Mr. Malfoy.”</p>
<p>“What?!” both Malfoys exclaimed in unison.</p>
<p>“When Harry turned in the Great Hall his eyes locked onto you, Mr. Malfoy. There is no doubt in any of the professors’ minds that had we not Stunned Mr. Potter when we did, he would have attacked you, Draco, and drank your blood.” Dumbledore explained simply.</p>
<p>Lucius looked utterly aghast, straightening up. “Well then, I do believe it would be in Draco’s better interest to be removed from this school while there is a Vampire craving his blood. I demand you allow him to return home at once, Headmaster.”</p>
<p>Dumbledore stood to look at Lucius, ice blue eyes boring into the blonde man’s very soul. “That would be unwise, Mr. Malfoy. If Draco is indeed Mr. Potter’s intended, then Mr. Potter might die without his blood. Now, Draco does have every right to deny Harry access to his blood, but that said, things may get out about this and…if Harry dies because of Draco’s refusal…People may start asking questions, Mr. Malfoy.” Dumbledore gave Lucius a hard, searching look. “You don’t want that, do you, Lucius?”</p>
<p>Lucius struggled for a few long moments, weighing the consequences of Potter dying to what would happen if word got out that it was his son’s fault that the Savior was dead. Eventually Lucius relented. “Very well, Headmaster, Draco will stay in the castle. I expect this situation to be handled quickly and quietly, and I want a daily report on Draco’s health so I know that Potter is not mistreating him.”</p>
<p>The Headmaster nodded with a pleased smile. “Of course, Mr. Malfoy,” he said, leading Lucius to the Hospital Wing doors. “Thank you for your cooperation, we’ll keep you updated.” Lucius nodded, sweeping out the door without even another glance at Draco. Dumbledore smiled and turned to look at Draco once again. “Now, my dear boy, I’m sure you have some questions for me.”</p>
<p>Slowly Draco nodded, settling back against the pillows of his bed. “Yes, Headmaster. Umm…what about the Incubus?” he asked, trying to mask his anger and hurt with curiosity. His father had written him off, just like that. The very idea of the family name being tarnished and his father had signed him off to be some Vampire’s plaything. Expected, yes, but it stung nonetheless. “You said P-Potter has Incubus in him as well. What effects will that have?”</p>
<p>Dumbledore sighed, looking behind him where Severus and McGonagall stood quietly, observing the altercation. “Severus, do you think you could explain this to Mr. Malfoy? I have contacts in the Order who I must inform about this incident. Minerva, if you could explain to Mr. Malfoy the arrangements that will be made that would be excellent. Good day.” He smiled and nodded to them before sweeping out.</p>
<p>Both professors stepped over, neither of them affording Draco a smile. Even Severus looked worried, something that Draco knew to fear. “Draco, a Incubus is a creature of pure lust and desire. They have attributes that allow them to capture and seduce their prey. To put it bluntly…they feed off orgasmic energy. That’s also why they’re so popular as sex slaves,” he muttered darkly. “Now. I’m not sure how much of the Incubus will show up in Potter; the last time I checked his blood the Vampire’s virus was consuming everything. I could actually see it converting Potter’s cells and the other infections.” He paused, taking a deep breath. “There may also be a trace of Siren left in him, though luckily that creature complements the Incubus. From what I can tell, Potter will be able to sprout wings at will, his voice will be able to placate his victims, he’ll drink blood, and he will have an insatiable craving for sex.” He recited these in the same voice he would use to list Potion ingredients.</p>
<p>Draco bit his lip, squirming a little. “But…but what Dumbledore said about me being Potter’s intended...why? Why would <em>I</em> be Potter’s intended?”</p>
<p>At that Severus stiffened, glancing at McGonagall before he answered. “It is my belief that the Dark Lord is the one who infected Potter. He had me make a potion that would have enabled him to infect Potter with the creatures’ blood, as long as he had them on hand.” He paused, giving Draco an almost sympathetic look. “I also believe that the Dark Lord may have put your blood in the potion, ensuring that you would be Potter’s intended. Your father may have been involved.”</p>
<p>For a few long moments of shocked silence Draco gaped at Snape. “Why?” he finally breathed. “Why would he do that?”</p>
<p>“Without its intended’s blood, a Vampire will get very ill and most likely die.” McGonagall spoke up. “It is possible that the Dark Lord meant for Lucius to pull you from the school, thus cutting off any chance of Harry gaining access to your blood. He may have thought that Harry would die and the other creatures would take over, effectively turning Harry completely Dark. He could then be used as a weapon.”</p>
<p>Draco swallowed hard and slowly nodded. “I don’t really have a choice in giving him my blood, do I?” he sighed in resignation.</p>
<p>“No, Mr. Malfoy, you do not.” McGonagall nodded. “Without your blood Harry could die and I’m afraid we cannot let that happen.”</p>
<p>Again Draco nodded slowly, glancing nervously towards the door to Harry’s room. “But it’s possible I’m not his intended, right? We don’t know for sure.”</p>
<p>The two Professors exchanged looks and Severus carefully nodded. “There is a slight possibility that you are not, however, that is unlikely. There’s a way to find out for sure, if you wish to.”</p>
<p>Draco nodded eagerly, hoping against hope that Severus could be proved wrong and then he really wouldn’t have to let the new vampire drink from him. “Yes.”</p>
<p>Severus nodded and flicked his wand at the door Draco had been eyeing, and it slowly swung open, showing nothing but darkness. Within the darkened room Harry looked up at the rectangle of light, squinting against the brightness. Something in the light called to him, a song of yearning and desire washing through his very soul. He wanted to call to it, sing to it and make it his own, but he remained quiet, the hunger pulling at him. Harry stood slowly, the motion oddly fluid and graceful, taking a few strides towards the door opening and the light. He paused, hiding back in the shadows a few feet from the doorway as he heard voices.</p>
<p>“Sh-should I go in there?” A voice—Draco’s—asked in fear. The sound was music to Harry’s ears and he could feel the hunger surge within him, wanting to break free.</p>
<p>Outside, Severus nodded. “Yes. We will be right behind you, just in case things get out of hand.” His promise, however, did nothing to calm Draco’s fear. If things got out of hand there was a good chance that Potter would drink him dry before the professors could reach him.</p>
<p>Taking a deep breath, Draco nodded and approached the darkness of the room, stepping just inside. A purring sound came from the blackness and Harry carefully approached Draco. “Harry?” the blonde asked, voice timid and scared.</p>
<p>“Mmm…yes?” Harry purred and Draco jumped as strong arms wrapped around him, seemingly out of nowhere. “I know you, don’t I?”</p>
<p>Draco shuddered as he felt Harry nuzzle his neck, light lips brushing against his throat. “Y-yeah. I’m Draco, Draco Malfoy.”</p>
<p>Harry shook his head, humming happily as he inhaled Draco’s scent deeply. “No, not that…” he murmured before he groaned. “You smell <em>so</em> good…”</p>
<p>Behind him Draco heard noise and Harry’s grip on the blonde tightened as he spun around to face McGonagall and Severus. “No!” he snarled, shielding Draco with his body as the wizards raised their wands. “He’s mine! Mine!” Then he fell under the wizard’s Stunners.</p>
<p>“That settles it.” McGonagall said dryly, staring down at Harry’s body. “You’re Potter’s intended.”</p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco was going to die. That, he was certain of. As he stood outside the thick, dark wood door behind which he knew a Vampire sat in wait for him, Draco could hear his blood rushing in his ears and his heart hammering in his chest. He didn’t want to do this. Every bone in his body yearned for him to turn around and run as far away as he could. But he couldn’t.</p>
<p>Hours before, Dumbledore had come to Draco’s room in the dungeons, informing him that his living space would be moved. According to the headmaster Harry had torn the room in the hospital wing apart, trying to get to his intended. They had to promise Harry close proximity to his mate in order to keep him from killing Snape when he had gone to take more blood samples. Next, to Draco’s great displeasure, the old coot had warned him of what would happen should he not cooperate. He would be sent straight to Azkaban, charged with murder, and his family’s fortune would be seized. Needless to say, Draco was not willing to let that happen. Now, however, he was regretting that decision.</p>
<p>His things were moved into a larger living space, complete with his own bathroom and lounge. The only part of this whole arrangement that he hated, apart from the fact that he’d been blackmailed into it, was the door set in the wall across from Draco’s bedroom. The door Draco now glared at, as if he could make it disappear with sheer willpower and anger.</p>
<p>There had been only one good bit of news that day, but it had left Draco uncertain. Harry could be cured, or at least, that’s what Severus had said. According to Draco’s godfather, whatever the Dark Lord had used to change Harry wasn’t stable. Although the Vampire was dominating now, the head of Slytherin house claimed that it could possibly be convinced to go dormant, leaving Harry once again human. This would, of course, depend on the Incubus and Siren bits cooperating, although Severus claimed that they already had morphed into the Vampire’s infection. Even if the cure <em>did</em> work, however, Harry would still have to take a potion for the rest of his life. And, above all, Harry’s recovery would depend on Draco’s blood. Which is exactly why Draco found himself shifting nervously in front of the thick wooden door, wishing that he could be anywhere besides that spot.</p>
<p>Finally, after almost five minutes of nervous pacing, Draco took a deep breath and knocked on the door gently. Moments later the door unlocked and Draco pushed it open, blinking into the darkness of Harry’s chamber. “H-Harry?” Draco mumbled quietly, slowly stepping into the dim light, his heart hammering in his chest.</p>
<p>Draco jumped as the door slowly creaked closed behind him and arms wrapped around his waist, a strong, muscular chest pressing up against his back. “Mmm, they told me you would come,” a dark, soft voice purred in his ear. “But I wasn’t sure…they could have lied.” A pair of gentle lips dragged across the base of Draco’s neck and he shuddered.</p>
<p>Immediately the Vampire pulled away and a light flared at the other end of the room as the fire rose up in the hearth. Surprisingly black eyes peered worriedly at Draco from a face of pale skin, adorned with startlingly red lips. “Are you scared, darling? I’ll never, ever hurt you, I promise,” Harry cooed and Draco tried to repress another shudder.</p>
<p>“Don’t call me darling.” Draco croaked, trembling slightly in fear and terror. “I-I’m not your d-darling. Just t-take my blood so I can go.”</p>
<p>A dark frown crossed the Vampire’s plump lips and he took hold of Draco’s wrist, tugging him over to a chair. “What are you afraid of?” he asked softly, almost breathlessly. “I will not hurt you, I must only take what is mine, what I need to survive.” He sat down in the chair next to Draco’s and squinted slightly in the soft light of the fire. “I am sorry for any inconvenience this will cause you, Draco. I really am.”</p>
<p>The blonde snorted, snatching his hand away from where Harry had been playing with his fingers. “Inconvenience? That’s what you’re calling this, Potter? This is so much more than just an inconvenience. You want to take my blood, the essence of my life!”</p>
<p>Harry winced and chewed on his lower lip with one rather sharp looking fang, almost immediately drawing blood. “I already said I was sorry,” he mumbled, looking down. “I can’t do much else, I need your blood to live. You’re my mate, Draco…you’re mine.”</p>
<p>“Yours?!” Draco nearly shrieked, trembling even more in fear. “Did you ever think that I didn’t want to be yours, that I never asked to be yours?!”</p>
<p>“I know you didn’t,” Harry said sharply, flashing his fangs. “You have no choice in being my mate just as I have no choice in having you as my mate. We’re destined, Draco. You were made for me, and I for you. That’s why your blood can sustain me.”</p>
<p>Draco snorted, shaking his head. “I don’t care, I don’t want you taking my blood.”</p>
<p>There was a long pause and finally Harry nodded, standing and stepping away from Draco. “Very well, then I won’t,” he said, voice barely above a silken whisper. “You should go. Tell <em>them</em> to put you back in your old rooms. I won’t harm anyone else.”</p>
<p>For a few moments Draco just blinked in surprise at the Vampire lurking in the shadows. “But you’ll die,” Draco finally said, swallowing hard. “You’ll die without my blood.”</p>
<p>“Then I shall die.” Harry shrugged his shoulders. “I will not take blood from you when you are unwilling. I would die anyways if I did that.” He sighed softly. “And I won’t force you to do anything that you don’t wish to do.”</p>
<p>At that statement Draco almost snorted scathingly, but something stopped him. There was something in the Vampire’s tone and mannerisms that made him hesitate. The Vampire was almost…caring. Yes, that was the closest word Draco could find for it. There was a cooing sound in the depths of Harry’s reverberating voice that calmed Draco, making his muscles and entire body relax.</p>
<p>“Oh dear,” Harry murmured, shying even more away from Draco. “You had better go.” But Draco’s eyes had slipped shut and he seemed to not have heard, instead feeling oddly and completely at peace. A low growl rumbled from Harry’s throat as hunger swept through him, making him tremble with desire. “Go!” Harry shouted, finally getting Draco’s attention.</p>
<p>“Hmmm, what?” Draco murmured sleepily, blinking up at Harry in surprise with rather glazed and clouded eyes. Slowly they cleared and Draco frowned. “What…what was that?”</p>
<p>“Siren,” Harry answered curtly, turning from Draco as he felt his fangs extend, the hunger getting worse. “And Incubus. You need to go.”</p>
<p>A frown flashed across Draco’s lips and he slowly stood, reaching out to place a hand tentatively on Harry’s shoulder. “Are you sure?” he asked quietly.</p>
<p>In a flash Harry spun around, teeth bared and showing fangs. “Unless you want me to feed on your blood and body!” he snarled, taking all of his strength not to leap at the vein pulsing in Draco’s throat, calling to him. “Now go!”</p>
<p>Quickly Draco nodded, the very sight of Harry’s fangs spurring him on to get away. In moments he was out the door, the solid wood thunking closed behind him.</p>
<p>Draco didn’t return to the Vampire’s lair until the next night, and even then he was practically dragged there by Dumbledore and Snape. Dumbledore had discovered Draco’s lack of cooperation when Draco had not gone to Madam Pomfrey for blood replenishing potion and when Snape had gone to take his daily sample of Harry’s blood. This time Dumbledore would personally ensure that such an incident would not happen again. The headmaster stopped outside of Harry’s room and turned to look at Draco. “Now Mr. Malfoy, I realize that you’re scared. However, you agreed to give Mr. Potter your blood and that is what you must do.”</p>
<p>The blonde teen glared up at Dumbledore. “You try letting a Vampire drink your blood and see how much you like it,” he growled.</p>
<p>To Draco’s surprise the Headmaster just laughed, easily brushing off Draco’s anger. “My dear boy I would, but alas it is not my blood that Harry needs, but yours. Now go on, and once you’re done you must go to Madam Pomfrey so that she can check you over. If you don’t, I will know.”</p>
<p>Gritting his teeth, Draco nodded reluctantly, biting back a snarky retort before opening the door and slipping inside.</p>
<p>Once the door closed behind him, Draco took a deep breath, trying to at least somewhat steady his nerves. He still jumped, however, as a voice slithered out from the darkness, wrapping itself around Draco. “Why have you come back?” Harry asked, voice low. Carefully Draco followed Harry’s voice and found the Vampire lying under the covers in the large bed. “You’re endangering yourself by coming here.”</p>
<p>Taking a deep breath, Draco nodded. “I know I am. But I promised that I would give you my blood and so that’s what I must do.” He sighed softly and sat on the edge of Harry’s bed. “I…I’m just afraid that it will hurt.”</p>
<p>Harry chuckled softly. “It won’t hurt, Draco. And even if it did, you would love the pain. You would yearn for it.” He sat up and the covers fell slightly, exposing his chest. It was only then that Draco realized that under the blankets Harry was completely naked.</p>
<p>For a moment Draco was stunned at the sight of Harry’s chest, wondering if it had always been that muscular and defined, or if that was just another effect of the Vampire infection. Eventually Draco remembered himself and blushed lightly, holding out his hand. “Dumbledore said that we should start with my wrist or palm.”</p>
<p>The Vampire nodded and shifted closer so he could reach Draco’s hand, not even noticing as the blankets slipped precariously low on his hips. He ran his lips lightly over Draco’s skin as his fangs descended. Moments later he sank his teeth into the tender flesh of Draco’s wrist.</p>
<p>For a moment Draco’s breath stopped before he let out a breathy moan, eyes falling closed. <em>It shouldn’t feel like this</em>, he thought vaguely. <em>It should hurt and burn, not…not like this.</em> Draco couldn’t even feel the place where Harry’s teeth pierced him, all he could feel was his blood racing hot and thick to that point, his heart beating faster and faster with every gulp of blood that Harry drank. The Vampire pulled away just as Draco started getting dizzy, gently lapping at the wound, red and bloody against Draco’s pale skin.</p>
<p>The Slytherin gasped softly as, before his very eyes, the wound at his wrist started to heal. In moments, all traces of what Harry had done were gone. The dizziness Draco had been feeling, however, didn’t disappear with the bite marks, and he collapsed next to Harry, closing his eyes. Next to him Harry shifted and in moments strong hands had flipped Draco over, cupping his slight arousal through his robes and trousers. Draco made a soft, breathy sound, opening his eyes to look up at Harry in confusion. “What are you doing?” he asked sharply, trying to squirm away as Harry started undoing his pants.</p>
<p>“Taking what’s mine,” Harry answered with a smirk, pressing his hard length against Draco’s thigh.</p>
<p>“No!” Draco squeaked, trying to push Harry off of himself. “I-I gave you my blood, you don’t get anything else.”</p>
<p>A cold laugh that made shivers run down Draco’s spine escaped from between Harry’s plump lips. “Don’t I? You’re mine, Draco. All of you. <em>He</em> may not want to hurt you, but I have no qualms about it, as long as I get what belongs to me.”</p>
<p>Draco looked up at Harry with wide eyes and he stiffened in fear. Harry’s eyes had turned a sickly shade of yellow that almost glowed in the darkness. “Incubus,” he breathed, starting to tremble in horror. Snape had told him about what Incubi really were, how they were demons that fed off of sexual energy, their body built for holding down their victim and eliciting pleasure. They didn’t care if they hurt their prey, as long as they took what they wanted. The creature’s body was built for sex and as Draco watched Harry he could see the Gryffindor’s body start to shift and change.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Harry hissed with a curling smirk, his fingernails lengthening so they could cut through Draco’s shirt with ease. “I’m afraid Harry’s gone now, Draco,” he cooed. “But he’ll come back after I’m finished. He’ll be so distraught once he sees what I’ve done. He really does adore you.”</p>
<p>Trembling, Draco squeaked and struggled, Harry’s muscular arms more than enough to hold the struggling blonde down. A soft hum came from Harry’s throat and, though he did his best to resist it, Draco soon found himself relaxing, and eventually he stopped fighting. With quick movements Draco’s pants were pulled off and tossed on the floor, but in his Siren Song filled mind the gesture barely registered.</p>
<p>The whole time Harry’s body was changing as the Incubus took over and the Vampire in him melted back to the shadows. His skin seemed to glow with an unearthly light and a set of translucent, dark-feathered wings sprouted from his back. The biggest difference in Harry, besides his newfound strength, was his cock. Draco whimpered as his eyes dropped to Harry’s manhood, trying to take in the horrible sight.</p>
<p>Harry’s cock had thickened and lengthened to such proportions that Draco was sure it would never in a hundred years fit inside him. What made Draco shudder the most, however, was the ridge of spines that descended from his pelvis down either side of Harry’s shaft to the tip. They looked incredibly painful and a glistening sheen seemed to cover Harry’s cock from root to tip.</p>
<p>The Incubus smirked as he saw Draco’s gaze, his sharp nails making quick work of Draco’s boxers. The humming had stopped and Draco whimpered under the creature’s hungry stare. “N-no!” Draco whimpered, shuddering as Harry flipped him over onto his back, finger sliding to pull his arse cheeks apart. “Please don’t!”</p>
<p>To Draco’s surprise Harry actually paused, a shudder running through him. Moments later Draco was flipped over onto his back and found himself staring into Harry’s eyes again. They were dark now, flecked with the sickly yellow of the Incubus. “Go!” Harry snarled, shuddering again as he tried to keep the demon at bay. “Go before he hurts you!”</p>
<p>Draco didn’t need telling twice and the moment he got out from under Harry he sprinted as best he could to the door, hurtling through it and closing it tight behind him. He leaned against it as dizziness from blood loss threatened to overwhelm him and black spots danced across his vision. Moments later there was a heavy thud and the sounds of snarling as Harry threw himself at the door, trying to get to Draco.</p>
<p>Panting hard, Draco couldn’t stop the shivers that ran down his spine, tremors shaking his body. He’s come so close to being raped by that…that thing. Squeezing his eyes shut, Draco let out a choked sob, sinking to the floor and pulling his knees into his chest. He never signed up for this when he decided to join the Dark Lord; he had never imagined anything like this.</p>
<p>Hours passed and Draco didn’t move from his spot, trying to get himself back under control. How could he go back there? Back to that monster that used to be known as Harry Potter? Draco knew how. He’d be forced back, forced to give his blood and eventually his body to the mighty savior of the Wizarding world.</p>
<p>He wondered foggily what Dumbledore would tell him to do if he knew about what the Incubus wanted from him. He’d probably tell him he had to give up his body to Harry or he’d go to Azkaban. Typical.</p>
<p>When Madam Pomfrey found him Draco hadn’t moved from his spot, still lost in thought and half asleep from the exhaustion of his ordeal. Instead of lecturing him about not coming to see her, the medi-witch had simply found him some clothes, helped him to his feet, and supported him as they went up to the hospital wing, and for that Draco would be eternally grateful. Only a few murmured words were exchanged between the two as Madam Pomfrey helped him settle on the bed and gave him his potion.</p>
<p>“Thank you.” Draco said softly as the room stopped spinning and his thoughts finally cleared.</p>
<p>“He shouldn’t take this much,” Madam Pomfrey admonished with a small frown, bustling over to take the goblet from Draco once he had downed the potion inside. “If he is not careful he could drink until even blood replenishing potion cannot save you. You should rest after, perhaps sleep if you need it. And eat; food will help with the dizziness.”</p>
<p>Draco slowly nodded, taking in her words and filing them away for when he was ready to think about the vampire ordeal again. “I’ll remember that, Madam Pomfrey. I’m fine now, can I go?” he asked, trying his hardest not to sound impatient. He had enough to worry about without adding a trip to the hospital wing to the list.</p>
<p>Giving Draco a stern, hard look, Madam Pomfrey checked his vitals again with her wand and reluctantly agreed. “Alright, Mr. Malfoy, you may leave. But no strenuous activity for the rest of the day, and you must promise to eat a decent dinner and rest.”</p>
<p>“I promise.” He nodded with a small smile, climbing out of bed and quickly leaving the hospital wing.</p>
<p>Once Draco reached his chambers he headed to the bathroom, planning on taking a nice long shower to wash away the feeling of Harry’s hands on him. Sighing, he rested his forehead on the cool tile as hot water pounded down on his back, closing his eyes.</p>
<p>Immediately the memory of Harry drinking his blood flashed through his mind, the thoughts spreading warmth through his body. After a few moments Draco shook his head with a frown, trying to rid himself of the thoughts. Yes, the blood sucking hadn’t been overly terrible, but that didn’t mean he wanted to do it again, right?</p>
<p>Draco looked down, his body betraying his state of arousal from the memory of the vampire pulling his life force from him. Cursing himself, Draco reached down, giving himself relief from the aching problem. <em>Maybe next time Harry will just drain me dry and I won’t have to deal with any of this crap anymore</em>, Draco thought to himself.</p>
<p>It wasn’t like he wanted Harry to suck his blood…right?</p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>The next day Draco could once again be found outside Harry’s door, after minimal prompting from the Headmaster and Snape, shaking slightly as he tried to calm his pounding heart. This time he would just go in, let Potter drink, and then get his arse out of there before the Incubus had time to make an appearance. Taking a deep breath, Draco knocked on the door before unlocking it and stepping inside. He had just heard is click locked behind him when his breathe hitched and he froze as strong arms wrapped around his waist, pulling him up against a muscular chest.</p>
<p>“Mmm, I didn’t think you’d come back.” Harry murmured, his voice reverberating and low. He nuzzled Draco’s neck and inhaled, moaning softly at the scent of Draco’s blood racing through his veins. “You smell so good.” He murmured, gently pulling Draco over to the armchairs by the fire.</p>
<p>“Do you want something to eat or drink?” he asked graciously as Draco sat down, his smile flashing fangs. “They told me this time I should offer you something, calm you down.” He looked at Draco expectantly.</p>
<p>For a few moments Draco just blinked at Harry in surprise before he slowly nodded. “Some…some hot chocolate would be nice, if possible. “ he said quietly, thinking that chocolate could possibly help to calm his nerves.</p>
<p>Harry quickly nodded, calling a house elf to bring Draco a hot chocolate with whipped cream and chocolate shavings. He handed Draco the mug before sitting down in the chair next to his, staring into the soft flames of the fire. “Thank you, Draco… for coming back.”</p>
<p>A soft snort escaped Draco’s lips as he heard Harry say that. “I don’t really have a choice in that matter, Potter.” He said before he paused, his voice softening a bit. “And it wasn’t all terrible yesterday.”</p>
<p>A small smile crossed Harry’s lips. “I am truly sorry for what…<em>he</em> almost did to you. I’ll be more careful to keep him at bay when you’re here with me, Draco. I will not harm you.”</p>
<p>Draco nodded a little, sipping at his hot chocolate before he held out his wrists for Harry. “We might as well get this over with, then. I can tell you’re dying to taste it again.”</p>
<p>Harry’s tongue flicked out in agreement, licking over his lips. “Well you’re not wrong about that.” He whispered, voice soft and dark and somehow sweet to Draco’s ears. “Do you wish to finish your drink first?”</p>
<p>After a moment of thought Draco shook his head. “I’ll just drink it while you’re, um, doing your thing.” He answered, fingers of his outstretched hand twitching to get Harry’s attention. “Now come on, we don’t have all day.”</p>
<p>Quickly Harry nodded, nuzzling Draco’s wrist gently and inhaling deeply before he finally sank his teeth into the soft heel of Draco’s hand. A soft moan slipped out from Harry as the taste of Draco’s blood splashed over his tongue. Normally it would have made Draco shudder, hearing that sound from between the plump red lips of his greatest enemy, if it weren’t for the utter bliss racing through his body at that moment in time. His heartbeat was racing, pumping hard and fast as though it meant to rip from his chest just so it could get to Harry’s lips faster. Draco almost forgot to drink his hot chocolate; so distracting was the feeling of Harry’s teeth sunk deep into his skin, sucking the liquid of Draco’s life. Then Harry stopped and Draco barely managed to keep a pitiful whimper form leaving him.</p>
<p>Draco opened his eyes (when had they closed?) and looked up into the dark eyes studying him. “Done already?”</p>
<p>Harry shook his head, tongue shooting out to lap away a couple of spilled drops of blood on his lips. It was then that Draco noticed Harry was trembling with repressed desire. He wanted, no needed, more of Draco’s blood. And yet he had stopped, holding back. But why? “Drink.” Harry commanded softly, still staring at Draco. “You need the sugar and energy, it will help.”</p>
<p>Quickly Draco nodded, sipping the warm, soothing drink again. “Sorry, I just…I forgot.” He murmured lamely.</p>
<p>The vampire cocked a curious eyebrow. “Does it really feel that good?” he asked, pure curiosity in his voice. He wasn’t mocking him, making fun of Draco. <em>He really doesn’t know…</em> Draco realized. Should he lie or should he let Potter know <em>just</em> how good it felt to have him drinking his blood?</p>
<p>But then Harry was talking again, pulling Draco from his thoughts. “It’s just…I’m drinking from your hand, so far from your heart.” The vampire tentatively nuzzled Draco’s neck before pulling away the moment he felt Draco stiffen in fright. “Severus, he said the closer to your heart the more potent the blood, and… the better it would feel for you.” He explained softly. “And…I would only have to feed once a day from your neck.”</p>
<p>“As opposed to what?” Draco asked with a frown, looking down at his hand, the wounds from Harry’s teeth once again gone.</p>
<p>He noticed Harry looked away, eyes diverted downward. “Nothing.” He muttered quickly.</p>
<p>“Potter…” Draco started, his voice almost a growl, low and threatening. “Are you supposed to be drinking from my hand more than once?” he demanded, his tone warning the vampire not to lie to him.</p>
<p>“Yes” Harry finally admitted after a long moment of silence, the word barely a breath. “I should feed twice a day, to get what I need.”</p>
<p>A low growl erupted from Draco’s throat and Harry’s eyes looked up to meet a heated glare. He almost flinched, as though it physically hurt. “Then why haven’t you been drinking from me twice a day?” Draco asked, voice low and dangerous. If Potter died because of his own stupidity there would be hell to pay.</p>
<p>“You were so afraid.” Harry mumbled, hiding his face. “And after what happened last time… I-I just couldn’t bring myself to tell you. You were unhappy enough about this whole ordeal without having to come here twice a day. I…I don’t want you to be upset, Draco.” There were tears in his eyes when he finished.</p>
<p>For a few moments Draco just stared at the vampire, his angry expression gradually softening. Then he smacked Harry’s arm. “You’re an idiot, you know that?” he grumbled. “What were you planning on doing, just drinking once a day until you passed out or died from malnutrition and starvation? Do you know what will happen to me if you die? Don’t you care about me, Potter?!” By the end of his rant Draco was almost shouting, his breath coming in pants and his heartbeat pounding in his ears.</p>
<p>“Of course I do.” Harry murmured and Draco was so taken aback by the admission that he missed the way the vampire’s eyes shone with hunger. “And I will do as you wish.” Harry whispered, voice feather soft.</p>
<p>Draco didn’t register the danger lurking in the vampire’s whispered words until it was too late. In one swift motion Harry was straddling Draco’s lap, his teeth sinking into the soft flesh of the blonde’s neck. As the fangs pierced Draco’s skin he let out a scream of pain and Harry let out a moan of contentment as the ruby liquid burst into his mouth. He swallowed it down noisily, hastily; until he could feel the ever-present hunger within him slowly fade away.</p>
<p>When the hunger disappeared Harry pulled back, licking gently over Draco’s skin to heal the vicious wound. He frowned as he noticed Draco had passed out, his mug of hot chocolate shattered on the floor. His frown deepened as he shifted slightly against the other young man and felt a hardness pressing against his leg. He sighed softly as he noticed the remarkable bulge in Draco’s trousers, restraining himself as he remembered what the potions professor had said about drinking closer to Draco’s heart. Harry would not hurt his mate, would not give into his repressed desire, until the other allowed it. Even if that time was never.</p>
<p>Carefully Harry picked Draco up, moving him to the bed once he’d made sure the blonde’s breathing and heart rate were close to normal. He carefully lay down next to Draco, holding his mate close in his arms as he waited for Draco to wake up.</p>
<p>Within Harry the Incubus slept, its battle with the vampire the previous night leaving it weak and tired. The vampire within Harry purred in contentment, pleased to finally sate himself with the blood he needed and to have his mate beside him.</p>
<p>For the vampire, all was well.</p>
