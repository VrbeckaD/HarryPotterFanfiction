          <div class="userstuff"><p>Victoire Weasley looked at the first years. “Welcome to Hufflepuff! We’ve got the best commons, since we’re right next to the kitchens.” She smiled brightly in that easy way that most Hufflepuffs seemed to possess. “We always have the smallest numbers, so we’re a pretty close-knit house. And feast night is always a time of games and fun! C'mon then.” And with that, the blond girl motioned them further into the common room.</p><p>“Introduce yourselves!” shouted a chorus of older students. “C'mon firsties, don’t be shy!”</p><p>“I… I’m Arabella MacMillan.” A small girl stuttered as she stepped forward. The crowd in the common room cheered for her and an older girl grabbed her to shove a glass of pumpkin juice into her hand.</p><p>“Welcome Arabella! Who’s next?” Victoire looked at the small group of first years remaining. “You! Blond boy in the back. Malfoy, right?”</p><p>Scorpius could feel himself turning pink at the scrutiny he was suddenly under. “Ah… yes. Hello.” Oh, his mother would be so cross with him for stumbling like that. “Scorpius.” He stepped forward uncertainly, unsure of whether they’d accept him or not.</p><p>“Welcome, Scorpius. No matter what you think, we’re not going to boot you, and within a month you’ll be like family.” A different seventh year grabbed his hand, pushing a glass of pumpkin juice into it with a smile. “Hufflepuffs give everyone a chance, and you seem like a fine kid.” A chorus of agreeing cheers nearly brought tears to Scorpius’ eyes, but he gave them all a small smile and moved out of the way for his next housemate to be introduced to the group.</p></div>
