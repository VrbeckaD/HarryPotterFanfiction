    <p>CHAPTER ONE: "THE LOCKED DOOR"</p><p>Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy have always gotten off on the wrong foot, from the embarrassing offer of friendship (which left the one boy quite embarrassed and upset, he had always heard his father talk about the 'great' Harry Potter and figured he'd try to make a new friend. Unfortunately that didn't go very well) to the teasing and quite frequent fights they shared through out many years. And even after the war with Voldemort and the fact that they were on opposite sides further pushed the two boys apart. So when Harry and Draco came back to school for an 8th year the rivalry continued.</p><p>Harry was exhausted, he spent the majority of his night doing homework he left till last minute to do. He currently sat uncomfortably in a small wooden chair in defense against the dark arts, a class he was already acing due to the whole 'killing the darkest wizard of his time in a war' thing, so when he began to nod asleep he couldn't help himself.</p><p>He wasn't sure how long he had been asleep but when he woke, class was still going. A paper bird sat on his desk, pecking at him. That must've been what woke him up. He looked around the room and met eyes with Draco Malfoy, who sneered at him. A small smirk also joining in.</p><p>Harry sighed, he was annoyed and already knew what the paper would be. So when he opened it, he glared back at Malfoy who just laughed with his friend Blaise Zabini.</p><p>On the paper was a drawing of Harry, who seemed to be falling off his broom and landing in Neville Longbottom's arms who then kissed him. The drawing was very good, though he'd never admit it to the other boy. Neville was one of his best mates and the drawing no matter how good, made him angry.</p><p>Neville had recently been outed as gay when a love letter he was sending to some boy was dropped from his bag and read out loud. He was embarrassed but when so many people were supportive he got more comfortable with everyone knowing. Though that didn't stop the occasional teasing. The drawing was obviously another example of that.</p><p>"What's that?" Ron asked when he noticed the paper in Harry's hand. </p><p>"Just Malfoy being a complete ass". He burned the paper with a flick of his wand and rolled his eyes.</p><p>"Very good Mr.Potter! That was a perfect example of the spell we've been learning today. Care to demonstrate for the rest of the class?" The professor questioned and clapped his hands excitedly.</p><p>Harry sighed and stood up, he got to demonstrate any time they were learning something new. It was quite annoying actually. He wanted to drop the class but he needed it to become an auror. So he just shut up and tried to get through it. </p><p>Malfoy snickered as Harry perfectly lit another fire and extinguished it. Damn git.</p><p>As the bell rang, signaling class was over, Draco picked up his books placing them in his bag over his shoulder and left, his walk a strut of confidence. He always kept a sketchbook and pencil on him to draw. Though he didn't let people know it was one of his favorite hobbies. That would be to embarrassing.</p><p>Harry followed the Slytherin, set on confronting him because of the rude drawing.</p><p>"I'll meet you in class, Ron" He told the ginger.</p><p>"Are you sure? Maybe you shouldn't pick a fight with Malfoy, and instead come to class.." Ron suggested. Ever since he and Hermione had started dating he had gotten more mature, though not completely. Sometimes it bugged Harry but mostly he appreciated the fact that Ronald had grown up a tad. </p><p>"I'm sure, if the teacher asks say I went to the infirmary because I had a migraine or something. Thanks mate!" And with that Harry continued to follow Draco.</p><p>He managed to follow him through the corridors and up many flights of stairs before Draco stopped to look at him. </p><p>"What do you want, Potter? And why are you following me? Did you like the drawing too much and hope to get some more for your wall?" He teased.</p><p>Harry stepped forward so he was on the same staircase as Draco. "Actually, quite the opposite. I get it that you're this huge jerk Malfoy but making fun of Neville for his sexuality is too far. Even for you".</p><p>He smirked in return, "Oh really? And how exactly do you know what's too far for me, Potter?" Draco stepped closer to the other boy.</p><p>"What I'm saying is you need to screw off with the homophobia, before I make you." Harry ground his teeth angrily and rested his hand on his wand inside his robe.</p><p>He laughed, "And what are you going to do about it?" His hand also connected to his wand. </p><p>"This! STUPEFY!" Harry's wand lit up but before it shot towards the blonde, the stair case began to move causing the two of them to stumble and grab onto the railing. The spell missing Draco and causing a loose stone from another staircase to go flying in a random direction.</p><p>Eventually the stair case came to a rough stop.</p><p>Draco was the first to stand and brushed himself off as he replaced the startled look on his face with a calm one. He looked down at Harry who was just beginning to stand up again.</p><p>"Now, if you'll excuse me from this stupid fight, I'm leaving before the stairs move again!" He strode up the stairs and stopped in front of the tall wooden door.</p><p>"This is not a stupid fight Malfoy!" Harry followed the other up the stairs and nearly bumped into him before he realized he had stopped. "What are you doing?"</p><p>"Have you ever seen this door before?" He questioned, and glanced around himself at the surrounding area. "I don't think I've ever been to this part of the castle before.."</p><p>"I don't know, probably?" Harry's voice was annoyed and confused.</p><p>A rumbling behind them caused them to turn quickly, the stair cases were changing again. And much to their dislike, no other stairs reappeared at the landing.</p><p>"Doesn't matter now, we have to go through. Now hurry up Malfoy, I have class and I'd rather not stay here with you." Harry groaned.</p><p>Draco just rolled his eyes and opened the door. The two of them walked in.</p><p>The room was relatively small with dark hardwood flooring, maroon painted walls, some furniture, and no windows, which was weird. Even if you were in a room at the center of Hogwarts there would be a conjured window, a fake one to make the room feel bigger and less cramped.</p><p>The two of them walked in farther.</p><p>"I've been to every part of this castle and never have I seen this room." Draco studied the room cautiously. There were some bookshelves that seemed to be dust free when he wiped his finger on the wood.</p><p>"Me neither... this is weird. I'm leaving. I'll just wait for another staircase to show up." Harry turned to leave and stopped as he faced the door. He turned the handle, well tried to but it didn't budge. He began to panic.</p><p>"Uhh... Malfoy?" Harry's words were of concern.</p><p>"What do you want Potter? Just leave already, your voice gives me a head ache." Draco turned to him.</p><p>"The uh.. the door won't open." He struggled with the nob but it still didn't budge. </p><p>Draco's eyes grew wide and he rushed to the door, pushing the other boy out of his way. He tried the handle himself but still nothing. "Alohamora!" A light hit the door from his wand but had no effect. He began banging on the door hoping someone would hear and help.</p><p>The two panicked as a realization set in,</p><p>They. Were. Trapped.</p>
