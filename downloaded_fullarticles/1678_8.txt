          <div class="userstuff"><p>'Your place or mine, Potter?' Draco wasn't exactly slurring his words but he was surely having problems staying on his own two feet.<br/>
Harry sighed and tried to steady the blond menace.<br/>
'O wait, since it's my birthday it should be my choice and I want to go to your place.'<br/>
Draco giggled and then put a hand over his mouth. 'Oops.'<br/>
Harry rolled his eyes but couldn't control a smile spreading over his face. That makes it easy, he thought, because going to my place had always been the plan.<br/>
'Right,' he said, 'my place it'll be. But if I'd known you couldn't hold your Firewhisky we would have gone a long time ago.' Harry's attempts to sound chastising failed miserably due to his knowledge that it wouldn't have been possible to go earlier.<br/>
'I'll have you know that I can pf – perv – perfectly hold my whirefisky,' Draco complained although he tightened his grip on Harry's shoulders.<br/>
'Right,' Harry said again, 'hold on!'<br/>
Even in the middle of Apparating them to his home, he felt Draco's hand starting to wander all over his body.<br/>
They arrived with a loud crack. Before Harry could step away, Draco pulled him even closer and kissed him like there was no tomorrow, the taste of Firewhisky sharp on his tongue. Harry moaned. One hand started roaming over Draco's back and the other one intertwined itself in silky blond hair. He was lost in time and place until suddenly someone right before them shouted 'Bloody hell!'<br/>
They both froze and Harry saw Draco becoming even paler than usual.<br/>
'Surprise!' It came from the group of redheads that surrounded them. Some looking uncomfortable but most of them laughing hysterical.<br/>
'O Salazar,' groaned Draco weakly, already looking slightly green in the face, before he leaned over and deposited the abundance of Firewhisky on Ron's shoes.<br/>
'O dear,' Molly said, just before Harry felt Draco grow heavy in his arms.</p></div>
