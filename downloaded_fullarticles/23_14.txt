  <em>We won. </em>
</p><p>The Great Hall was filled with survivors, shocked and celebratory over having just <em>won the War</em>.</p><p>I almost couldn't believe it, but looking around the Great Hall, even the <em>Malfoy's </em>were there, huddled next to another small group of Slytherins and their parents.</p><p>"We bloody did it. <em>You </em>bloody did it." said Ron, slapping Harry's back, a mix of sadness at the loss of his brother and <em>relief </em>at it <em>finally </em>being over.</p><p>Finally.</p><p>"There's no way I could've done it without you lot." said Harry without a second thought.</p><p>He pulled Ginny into a kiss, his hands threading through her hair.</p><p>I couldn't help the stupid smile that spread across my face.</p><p>I may have been bruised and dirty and tired, but their love actually had a chance now. They had the opportunity to make whatever future they wanted - we all did.</p><p>"Hey, Mione?"</p><p>I turned my attention to Ron, but he said nothing, instead taking a step forward, tucking a strand of hair behind my ear before leaning forward and kissing me.</p><p>The kiss was brief, a small smile on his face as he pulled back - and honestly I didn't know what to think. We'd kissed on the battlefield, but that moment had been so charged that it seemed like a lifetime ago.</p><p>Now, standing in the Great Hall surrounded by a sad sort of victory, it almost felt wrong.</p><p>But I smiled nonetheless and slid onto the bench next to him across from Harry and Ginny - just like old times.</p><hr/><p>

</p><p>I had no idea why we were even here. No one wanted us to be, that was for sure.</p><p>We had <em>eventually </em>sided with the Order, but everyone knew - or at least speculated - that I wore the Dark Mark.</p><p>Besides, I was well aware that the only reason my father had allowed us to change sides at all was because he knew Voldemort was going to lose - and Salazar forbid he end up in Azkaban.</p><p>He'd gotten off with a rather hefty fine that the Order imposed, but it was certainly better than the Kiss.</p><p>I let my eyes wander around the Great Hall, spotting Theo and Pansy almost immediately, though they weren't who I was looking for. They quickly made their way over, parents in tow.</p><p>Pansy pulled me into a fierce hug, whispering, "I'm so glad you're alive." against my ear.</p><p>I simply nodded, scooting over so they could both sit too while I continued looking around the room.</p><p>It seemed everyone was content to ignore the pile of dead bodies that would have to be identified and cleared from the grounds sooner or later.</p><p>My eyes found Potter and his Golden Duo, in the spotlight as always, and I couldn't help the sneer on my face as Potter pulled the Weaslette into a kiss.</p><p>At least I knew that the Golden Girl was alive and - for the most part - well. Ever since her torture at the Manor, and maybe even before then, there was something in me that seemed to need validation about her.</p><p>Because I felt guilty, <em>obviously.</em></p><p>I was about to look away when I noticed Weasley tuck a strand of the <em>nest </em>Granger called hair behind her ear.</p><p>I knew what was about to happen, and for some reason I couldn't look away. Didn't <em>want </em>to look away.</p><p>The ginger oaf <em>kissed her. </em></p><p>And she kissed him back.</p><hr/><p>

</p><p>"Oh my gods."</p><p>Lucius turned to look at me, eyebrow arched in a silent question, but all I could do was gesture to our son.</p><p>He was watching the muggleborn girl with a look in his eye that could only mean one thing.</p><p>He fancied her <em>quite</em> a bit.</p><p>"No. Absolutely not, Narcissa." snapped Lucius, turning his attention back to me. "I won't allow it."</p><p>I was inclined to agree, but an idea was already starting to form in my mind.</p><p>"Now, now, let'a not be so hasty. Think about the <em>opportunities </em>this would afford us." I murmured, "If they were together, the Malfoy name would be right as rain again. Our reputation would be better than ever - it's even a <em>plus </em>that she's muggleborn, if you think about it, dear."</p><p>"There's no way that girl is going to give him <em>or</em> our family the time of day." he said slowly, clearly intrigued by what I was saying.</p><p>"Everyone can be persuaded." I said, waving my hand as if to bat away the annoying thought, "With us on Draco's side there's no way this could go wrong."</p><p>"You honestly plan to make them fall in love with each other? I know that you're <em>good</em>, Cissa, but are you <em>that </em>good?"</p><p>"Our son is already halfway there, Lucius." I snapped, "And what my son wants, he gets."</p><p>"Especially when it's beneficial to us, yes?" he asked with a smirk.</p><p>I smiled back, nodding, "Exactly."</p><p>"You are quite the brilliant witch."</p>
