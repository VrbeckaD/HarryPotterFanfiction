    <p>NUMBER ONE: PUT A COPY OF GRIMMS FAIRY TALES IN THE HOGWARTS LIBRARY</p><p>Draco pulled a book out of the reference section.</p><p>"Grimm's fairy tales... I wonder what that it?" he sat down and started reading. He finally found a story he liked, and wrote out 3 feet of parchment on it. After turning it in, he was called to the headmaster's office.</p><p>"What is the meaning of this, Mr. Malfoy?" McGonagall handed him his essay.</p><p>"Whatever do you mean Ma'am?"</p><p>"this is not MAGICAL history young man, this is muggle nonsense! What book did you get this information from!"</p><p>"grimmsfairytales" he mumbled</p><p>"What Mr. Malfoy?"</p><p>"Grimms Fairy Tales ma'am."</p><p>"Do you still have this in your possesion?"</p><p>"Yes ma'am." he dug the book out of his bag, dropping it on the floor. As he picked it up, he noticed a name neatly printed on the inside of the back cover.</p><p>'Granger...' he growled as he handed the Headmistress the book.</p>
