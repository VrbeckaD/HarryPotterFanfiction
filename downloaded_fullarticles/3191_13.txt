    <p>Malia Bardsley couldn't say that she remembered the first time she met the Weasleys, since nobody could actually remember the day they were born. </p>
<p>As her mother told her, it went like this: it was during the early hours of December 10th, 1977 when Mrs. Bardsley's water broke and due to the fact that they were living in the dark times of the First Wizarding War, few people could be trusted. Therefore, they flooed their closest neighbours and loyal friends, Arthur and 5-month-pregnant-with-twins Molly Weasley, to ask for their assistance. They arrived shortly after accompanied by their three children Bill, Charlie and Percy (since they couldn't be left alone at home). Arthur told his kids to stay in the living room and followed his wife to the Bardsley's bedroom.</p>
<p>After many painful hours of pushing, Mrs. B gave birth to a baby girl. <br/>
When Malia was cleaned and clothed, Molly called for her children to meet their new little neighbour. Percy had fallen asleep and was snoring softly on the sofa. However, Bill and Charlie timidly walked into the room and stepped closer to Mr. B who was sitting on a chair holding his little girl. </p>
<p>7-year-old Bill stared at her in wonder and asked, 'What's her name?'</p>
<p>'Malia.’ answered the exhausted new mum.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, almost-5-year-old Charlie, standing quietly next to Mr. B, carefully placed one of his small fingers under Malia's tiny hand and raised his eyebrows in awe when she wrapped her fingers tightly around his. </p>
<p>'She's so small.’ Charlie whispered. </p>
<p>From then on, all people present in that room knew that that was the exact moment when Charlie Weasley's adoration and fascination for Malia Bardsley began.</p>
