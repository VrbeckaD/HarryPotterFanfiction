    <p>In a world filled of witches and wizards who are covered in the tattoos of those who love them- Tina’s body was bare.</p><p>When she was little it hadn’t bothered her, actually it almost pleased her. She was incredulous when Mama told her that a tattoo symbolising everyone and anyone who ever loved her though out her life, was going to be stuck on her skin forever. Queenie had clapped her hands together in delight, but Tina had screwed up her face in disgust. </p><p>“But Mama,” she said, “what if I don’t love that person back?”</p><p>“Don’t be silly Teenie, of course you’ll love them back,” Queenie hugged her sister round the neck, her blonde curls bouncing. </p><p>“But I might not!” Tina said worriedly, “and then I’d be stuck with that reminder forever!” she crossed her arms stubbornly, her already characteristic frown stamped on her face.</p><p>Papa entered the room holding a tray on which stood four cups of cocoa, and shared an amused look with his wife. </p><p>“Pumpkin, the tattoos are a symbol that someone has loved you,” Mama said, caressing her eldest daughter’s cheek, “and that is the most beautiful magic of all,” </p><p>Still sceptical, Tina cheered up at the warmth of her hot cocoa. Queenie meanwhile was vigorously checking herself for marks, looking studiously under her petticoats.</p><p>“Mama, can I look at yours?” she said, while inspecting each ankle behind her dainty socks. </p><p>Mama shot her husband a look filled of love and slowly pulled down her dress to reveal a sliver of collarbone. There a tiny otter swan on her skin, and waved an even smaller paw at the girls.</p><p>“You can touch if you want,” Mama said gently.</p><p>Queenie softly traced the otter’s snout; it sneezed and she giggled. Tina stuck out a tentative thumb and pressed it over the creature. It just felt like her mother’s skin, no lumps or bumps, or anything out of the ordinary. And yet the picture was so vibrant, the colours so lifelike and it’s movements so real, she half expected it to swim off Mama's shoulders and begin playing in their kitchen sink. Furrowing her tiny brow, Tina dug her thumb in deeper trying to rub it off.</p><p>“Porpentina!” her Mama scolded, brushing her hand away.</p><p>“I wanted to see if it would go away,” she sat back down sulkily, skirts pooling around her.</p><p>“It will never disappear, ever, little one,” her papa said, “not even if I left, not even if I stopped loving your mother. The love that was felt will always remain,” Then he kissed Mama full on the mouth, Queenie cooed and Tina hid her head in her hands.</p><p>After her parents had kissed her goodnight, and she was safely tucked into a cocoon of blankets, Tina never considered that they’d lied to her. But sometimes even mother’s and father’s conceal the truth. So when six months later she has to be torn away from her Mama’s limp hand by her much drier eyed little sister, she stared in disbelieve which soon gave way to disgust. The tiny otter had frozen mid jump and its shiny brown coat had faded into cream. It seemed that even love could not defeat death. </p><p>Later that night the sisters were wrapped up in each other. Together on the single bed they refused to hear the sounds of their stern Aunt, stalking downstairs. 'I'll never have a tattoo' Tina promised silently to herself. Queenie repeated her sister's thought out loud, then hugged her tighter. </p><p>“You might not have a choice, Teenie,” Tina had shrugged, but she’d already made up her mind. </p><p>Surely if she hadn’t loved her parents, their deaths wouldn’t have hurt so much. Queenie said nothing, but buried her face deeper into her sisters dressing gown. Tina stroked her hair, while adding another brick to the wall she’s slowly building up around her.  </p><p>------------</p><p>She’s in her second year at Ilvermony when the girl in the bed next to her screams. Tina watches alone from her bed as the rest of the dorm rushes over to comfort their friend, their plaits flying. </p><p>“Anna, Anna, what’s wrong?” they chatter around her, as the girl cries, pink in the face. </p><p>Tina hovers awkwardly, her feet dangling off her mattress. She’s spent almost two years living with these girls, and she’s not really made friends with any of them. She doesn’t want to stay up all night talking about Oliver, the Wampus beater with the handsome shoulders. (Although she does admit he’s gorgeous, the way his long fringe flops over his face, highlighting his high cheekbones). But Tina doesn’t want to talk about him the whole time. She wants to discuss that new spell they’ve been taught about in transfiguration, the one that conquers rope out of mid-air. But apparently that’s ‘boring’, and so she stays quiet and reads her textbooks alone, while the other girls swap gossip and do each other’s hair.</p><p>“Anna?” one of the other girls hugs the hysterical one round the shoulders. Crying louder and throwing up her hands in defeat, the Anna pulls up her night-dress higher to reveal her knee. There sits a humble crab, which scuttles back and forth, blinking its beady eyes up at the crowd.</p><p>The air is filled with girlish squeals. Tina pulls her legs up, and stuffs them under the covers, biting her lips anxiously, not wanting to get too close. </p><p>“Whose is it?” a girl asks, staring shamelessly, her button nose almost touching the Anna’s thigh. The crab’s claw takes a snap at her, and more screaming occurs. The girl cartoonishly stumbles back, and collapses on the floor in a heap.   </p><p>“Sebastian Buchan,” Anna admits, shaking her head, embarrassed tears on her cheeks. </p><p>Tina swallows hard, bottom lip wobbling, feeling her stress. Why would she admit to it? She would rather throw herself off the east tower. The gossip that Anna Abrams has the tattoo of Sebastian Buchan will be half way round the school by tomorrow. </p><p>“How?” “When?” “Where?” Little voices buzzed like bees, determined to get every single piece of information, from the first hand source. </p><p>“Oh it’s so romantic!” “What does it feel like?” “I just can’t wait until I have one,” they all gush one on top of another. </p><p>Tina curls her fingers tight against her sheets, anxiety clawing at her throat. </p><p>“I’m not sure,” Anna says complaintive, calming even preening a little at all the jealous stares she’s receiving from her peers, “I’ve been sitting next to him in charms and last week a- a stencil of a crab appeared,”</p><p>Appreciative ‘oohs’ appeared from all around. Encouraged by this reaction, Anna continues.</p><p>“And then yesterday,” she pauses for dramatic effect, “he kissed me,”</p><p> An explosion might’ve gone off in the dorm room, from how loud the girl’s examinations were. Tina resisted the urge to press her hands over her ears. Looking down at her watch, she finds it is two o’clock in the morning. ‘Isn’t anyone else bothered by the noise?’ She thinks peevishly. Looking over at the twittering birds she sighs. No, clearly not. The other girls are too busy either vividly creating, or describing, their own first kiss. She can’t even imagine it. The only kisses she ever receives are from Queenie, and those are light sisterly pecks on the cheek. All she has for reference for ‘those’ sort of kisses, is the faint memory of her parents embracing, which fills her with an intense sadness she immediately abhors and wants to be rid of. Filled with these conflicting feelings- sadness, anger, plus and a intense desire to escape, Tina breaks.</p><p>“For Mercy Lewis’s sake, can’t you all be quiet? Some people are trying to sleep!” she cries harshly. </p><p>Half a dozen little faces turn to her in surprise. And then disdain. </p><p>“What’s wrong Goldstein?” Anna asks, her voice full of concern, “it’s perfectly natural,”</p><p>Tina looks away, trying to hide the tears dripping down her cheeks.</p><p>“Porpentina, don’t be a spoilsport,” chimes in a brusque girl called Hannah, tossing her braid maturely, “even you’re going to get one sometime,” </p><p>“I won’t,” Tina says, determinedly staring at a notch on her bedpost. The other girls giggle nervously. </p><p>“Of course you will,” Anna says, calmly, “everyone does-“</p><p>“I WON’T!” Tina shouts, red in the face, hands trembling. She whips open her sheets and runs out of the room, slamming the door against shocked laughter and Anna’s hurt expression, searching for her favourite prefect. She eventually finds the upperclassman tiredly searching through some cue cards. Tina explains to her slippers about what happened, about the noise and how she just wanted to sleep. The prefect is kind, but not understanding.  </p><p>“Are you sure you don’t want to give them a few more minutes of excitement, Miss Goldstein?” she asks, rolling back her sleeves to glance fondly at a prancing pony on her wrist, not noticing Tina’s shocked grimace, “getting your first tattoo is a big moment in anyone’s life,”</p><p>Tina crutches her teeth together, imagining the golden pony turning from, gold, to yellow, to white.</p><p>“I’m sure,” she says spits, and the prefect gives her a strange look, but does as she bid. </p><p>She receives a cascade of dirty looks as she climbs back into bed, after the dorm has been quietened and the candles blown out. Hannah even goes as far to pinch her, whispering meanly in her ear. </p><p>“Maybe your dream will come true, Miss perfect,” she hisses spitefully, then speaks louder so the whole room can hear, “Miss plain, prickly, porcupine,” and there are murmurs of agreement and cruel mutterings. </p><p>Tina ignores them and burrows under her blanket, ‘your wrists are plain, stomach plain, thighs plain,’ she repeats to herself until her nerves finally calm down enough for her to sleep. </p><p>Tina doesn’t see how adorable (though admittedly short) the weeks of Anna and Sebastian’s relationship is. She doesn’t see the sweet notes passed to each other in between classes, the longing looks or the innocent promises of ‘forever’ that only thirteen year-old's can give. She does, however see, Anna’s red rimmed eyes in charms class two months later. And happens to over hear the gossip at breakfast- that Sebastian was seen French kissing Hannah in the owlery. Tina rolls her eyes and turns the page of her transfiguration textbook, stuffing a piece of toast into her mouth, satisfied. If you’re alone, no one can hurt you. </p><p>----------</p><p>In her seventh year though, people began to notice. Thankfully first- it was Queenie. Her sister had snuck into the head girl’s bathroom to do Tina’s hair for the last Christmas ball she’d ever attend. Her fingers were gentle as they braided milky mistletoe into her long dark locks, and her eyes had just fluttered shut in relaxation when-</p><p>“Hey Teenie,” her sister approached her casually, “where are your tattoos?” Tina pulled her hair abruptly from her sister’s grip, her nerves standing to attention.</p><p>“What do you mean?” she said vaguely, pretending to busy herself with the strap on her shoe so Queenie couldn’t see her face.</p><p>“Your tattoos,” Queenie said plaintively, and Tina feels her eyes crawl on her neck and back. The sheer white material of her dress lets her skin be shown, “I can hear you thinking about them all the time, but I’ve never actually seen one,” </p><p>She stays silent, willing her guards to stay in place. Queenie digs her in the ribs cheekily, enjoying the fact she has to work for the information.</p><p>“Come on!” she says playfully, “I’ll show you mine, if you show me yours,”</p><p>Tina’s mouth falls open and with it her defences come crumbling down. </p><p>“What? You?” she says croakily, spinning around to gape at her sister.</p><p>“Well yeah, of course,” Queenie says obliviously, before noticing she can now dive into her sister’s mind. Tina can feel her sifting through her thoughts, and she hangs her head in shame, as Queenies toothy grin morphs into a concerned frown. </p><p>“None at all?” Queenie asks her seriously, “but Tina, how is that even possible?”</p><p>It’s not that strange,” she says defensively, folding in on herself, “I’m only seventeen,”</p><p>This, of course, was not entirely true. She may be seventeen, but it’s still 1918. Anna’s luck had continued throughout the years, and Tina knew for a fact that Hannah now had at least four (she’d seen the various animals when they’d been getting changed after quidditch practice). Many girls in seventh and sixth years wore promise rings, or spoke of elaborate ‘coming out’ parties where older officers had whisked them off their feet. Some even wore engagement rings, pressed on them by wizards graduated, old enough to join the war in Europe. Those girls boasted happily of wedding dresses and flowers and how terrible the wait was between each of their beaus’ letters. Tina watched this alone, from the library, in which piles of books hid her from the outside world. ‘I don’t need all that nonsense’ she told herself plainly, ‘I’m going to be an auror, I can’t be an auror and a wife’. And yet something always seemed to be lodged in her throat these days. She didn’t want to poke it. She fears she might already know what it’ll say if she does. ‘Lonely’. </p><p>“But, but,” Queenie is almost confused now, “surely you’ve seen yours, you’ve loved someone... haven’t you?” her sister has almost gone cross eyed with the effort of wracking her own brains and shifting through Tina’s mind. </p><p>“Not really,” Tina admits, shaking her head, “I suppose I’ve liked people before, but I’ve just never got close enough,” she trails off at her sister’s sad look. Not wanting a depressing lecture, she interrupts whatever comforting words Queenie is planning to say. </p><p>“But how do you even know if a tattoo is yours anyway,” she says dismissively, attempting to hide how curious she actually is on the subject. Queenie sucks on her bottom lip in thought. </p><p>“It’s hard to explain,” she says slowly, looking out into the distance at the bathrooms stained glass windows, “It’s like a call, or a feeling, you see it and then suddenly- oh it’s me!” she smiles happy in remembrance, and Tina shuffles her feet together awkwardly.</p><p>“What animal?” she asks her softly.</p><p>“A butterfly,” her sister replies wistfully, “I was ‘hanging out’ with Edmund, and then suddenly ‘poof’ there it was,” she lifts up her sparkling green dress to reveal a spaniel sitting perfectly on her thigh, it’s tail waggling at Tina, “he’s the one taking me to ball tonight,”   </p><p>“Oh,” Tina says, sadly. When did her baby sister become so grown up? She’s going to a ball with a date, with who she shares a tattoo. Tina’s not even going with any friends (she doesn’t really have any). She was just going to stand by the punch bowel and enjoy the music. Queenie gives her a sympathetic glance.</p><p>“You look beautiful,” she says reassuringly, “Maybe someone will ask you to dance?” Queenie reaches for her hand and squeezes it, “then perhaps we’ll finally get to see what Tina Goldstein’s tattoo looks like,”</p><p>Tina gives her sister a small smile. Unfortunately, Queenie she was right. </p><p>The ball room was set up to be a proper winter in wonderland. Shining icicles glittered on the ceiling, a fifty foot Christmas tree towered over the waltzing students, while the band played a gentle melody. Everything seemed to be lit with what could only be tiny fairy’s, glowing in giant hovering baubles. Tina takes a tentative sip from her third cup of eggnog forlornly, watching Queenie spin gracefully under the lights, her date following her with avid devotion. </p><p>“No date tonight, Goldstein?” it’s Anna. Her childish canary hair,has sweetened to a mature strawberry blonde, and done in an elaborate twist on the top of her head. Her dress is one of delicate gold and Tina can’t help but notice it’s draped in such a way to hide her knee.       </p><p>“Ah no, not tonight,” she gives her a tight smile, and Anna nods back knowingly. </p><p>“Well, that makes two of us then,” she sighs, grabbing a herself a drink and leaning closer to her. She smells of lavender, Tina thinks absently, “Although may I say Goldstein, you do look beautiful tonight,” Anna smiles at her, and Tina flushes, her heart racing a little faster.</p><p>“Thank you,” she mumbles, agreeing but unable to reciprocate.  </p><p>They stand in silence, Tina twiddling her thumbs, not wanting to leave but not knowing what to say. Every now and again she flicks her eyes towards Anna, who is casually surveying the crowd and tapping her foot to the music’s beat. Tina notices she also has small swallow sat on her freckled neck. ‘What would it be like kiss it?’, Tina daydreams, ‘would she let me?’ </p><p>Anna sighs, and Tina prepares herself to see her walk away. </p><p>“So, you want to be an auror, is that right?” she asks, blue eyes twinkling, looking genuinely interested.  </p><p>Tina’s heart swells. She’s already beat this subject to death with her transfiguration and defence against the dark arts teachers. Queenie has heard her talk about her future career since she was eleven, and she knows her sister only has so much patience for it. She doesn’t have anyone else to talk to. So with a large smile on her face, Tina talks passionately about her hopes and dreams. Growing in confidence at Anna’s friendly questions, she even ventures to ask the girl what she herself wants to do (healer, mother, move back to California). </p><p>Tina’s nostrils burn with drink as she hits her with another well timed joke, and Anna laughs a carefree joyful sound. The band had just started up a brighter, jazzier tune. Many more couples, as well as groups of girls, were excitedly pulling their friends out onto the ballroom floor. </p><p>Anna sighs again and wipes a tear from one eye. The she holds out a delicate hand, perfectly manicured. </p><p>“Do you want to dance, Tina?” she asks smiling. </p><p>“Yes,” Tina blurts out, a bit too fast and too loud. But Anna doesn’t mind, grasping her hand and dragging her out into the crowd.</p><p>Smiling stupidly Tina bites her lip, looking down at their clasped hands. A shadow of something is fluttering at Anna’s wrist, hidden behind a large ornamental diamond bracelet. She raises their hands up to the light to get a closer look and the bracelet slides down her arm. This exposes a sight that makes Tina’s blood run cold. Queenie was wrong. It wasn’t a call. Instead it was like seeing half of herself. The majestic thunderbird flapped and swooped seemingly in greeting and she halts in shock. Anna too, stops in confusion, and turns to look at where Tina is currently blinking rapidly. Both pause for a second, Anna looking between the happy creature and Tina’s guilty face. Then she violently rips her hand out of her grip. </p><p>“What, what is this?” Anna says voice high pitched. She begins rubbing violently at her risk. </p><p>“I’m sorry,” Tina stutters, watching in sharp pain as the thunderbird becomes distressed at its new owner’s angry actions. </p><p>“Does this mean…you?” Anna looks like she’s going to be sick, her face red and blotchy. Tina can feel other couple’s curious gazes on them. Two students, one pale, one tomato, and very clearly not dancing. Tears fill her eyes, threatening to spill over. She’s unable to move, her feet seemingly frozen to the floor, forced to live out her worst nightmare. </p><p>“But,” Anna whispers, more confused now, looking at her new accessory with clear derision, “it’s not natural,” her eyebrows transform into mean question marks, a perfect pair to her sharp words. Sharp words that break Tina’s heart in two.</p><p>Stumbling away, she’s almost blinded by her tears. She clumsily makes her way out of the ball room, crashing into embracing couples, and ripping the hem of her dress on her heels. ‘Stupid, stupid, stupid,’. She couldn’t tell Queenie afterwards if she’d said it out loud or in her head. But anything was better than her hurried thoughts, where ‘unlovable’ and ‘abnormal’ floated in and out. She races up the stairs, not daring to hide in her dorm room, not where Anna could easily burst in. Instead she feels her way towards the head girl bathroom, where she collapses on the bathroom tiles. It turns out there are worse things than getting a tattoo and not loving the person who loves you back. It’s the another way round which really cuts you. And when that person is a girl… She buries her head in her arms and sobs.<br/>
And there, Queenie finds her in the morning, curled up in a ball shaking, tear tracks dried on her face.</p><p>“Oh Teenie,” her sister cries, feeling her pain and crawling to sit beside her, stroking her hair. </p><p>Tina moves a mattress into the head girl’s bathroom the next week. Although she can survive Anna’s cold looks, and the sneaky glares and giggles from her closest friends. She finds she can’t survive the nightmares she is plagued with when she sleeps in her dorm room- Where she is forced to relive her thunderbirds silent cry of distress before she ran away.  </p><p>----------</p><p>Tina Goldstein is twenty-five years old, and she still doesn’t have a tattoo. But she does have a nice apartment with her sister and her ideal job in the auror department. So things aren’t all bad. Really. In some ways her affliction can work to her advantage. Mrs Esposito was first a bit wary of Queenie’s bubbly personality and sweet nature, seemingly expecting men to be swimming in and out of their rooms. But when unveiling the lack of marks on her skin, the old-fashioned woman finally became satisfied with the sisters application. </p><p>“Oh, you are a proper sort then,” she said sounding pleased, nodding at Tina, “when I was your age you know girls, weren’t expected to have any but their betrothed,” Tina had to kick Queenie under the table before she said something untoward.</p><p>Finally, after a long and offensive (for Queenie who now has at least three tattoos marked on her skin) rant about how girls these days throw their hearts around too wildly, they’re finally given the lease. </p><p>Tina also finds it an advantage in her career. Despite their female president, men still rule the roost at MACUSA. And most find it easier to believe that a woman is ‘less likely to run off, and get married’, if they have clear evidence that the woman in question won’t. </p><p>And by now Tina’s sure she won’t. What wizard would take a prickly, law-abiding, awkward, bisexual, unlovable witch? None she knows. And she can’t get married to a woman, even if one wanted her. But it’s fine. It's fine. At least that’s what she tells Queenie. </p><p>“It’s fine,” she tells her sister over her morning coffee.</p><p>“It’s fine,” she tells a leery neighbour, shaking her arm out of his grip.</p><p>“It’s fine,” she tells the motherly witch with the knowing smile and sticky lipstick, in the toilets one afternoon.</p><p>“It’s fine,” she tells herself late at night, unable to sleep, feeling the cold air blow into the blankets of her rickety single bed. </p><p>“It’s fine,” the young man says, his hand curled protectively over the wound his ‘mother’ beat into him. Tina draws him close, murmuring words of comfort. At least she has her sister, who is able to lift her up, encourage, let her be loved, even if not in the way she sometimes craves. Tina doesn’t think Credence has ever had anyone like that in his entire life. She can tell by the way he hungrily presses into her, and memorizes her soft expression with disbelieving eyes. She so she hugs him tighter, and leaves him with a promise that she’ll fix this. She has to fix this.  </p><p>Tina doesn’t have a tattoo or her job anymore. But she does have her apartment. Even if the early December snow is creeping throw cracks and pooling in small puddles all over their floor. ‘But you can still watch over him,’ Tina tells herself, biting her chapped lips, huddling against her favourite hot dog stand. ‘You promised’.</p>
