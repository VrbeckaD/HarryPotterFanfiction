    <p>It was the first day of the newest school year. Tina Goldstein, trunk in one hand, walked up the stairs to her thunderbird dormitory after her miserable summer. She began to unpack when suddenly she felt arms wrap around her waist. She yelped a little in surprise before realising who It was and relaxing into the embrace. </p><p>"Hello." Said Jamie, Tina's boyfriend.<br/>
"Hi," Tina grinned at him. "I missed you."<br/>
"I missed you too." Jamie then began kissing down Tina's neck as Tina let out a little moan before pulling away.<br/>
"Can we do this later? I'm really tired."<br/>
"I thought you missed me?"<br/>
"I do. I just don't want this right now. Tomorrow, I promise."<br/>
"Fine. Be like that." Jamie leaves the room in a strop and Tina sighs and lays on the bed. </p><p>The couple had been together for eight months. Prior to this, Tina mostly kept to herself which had become quite lonely so the day Jamie asked her out had been a happy one for her. However, as the months went Jamie began to get rather angry at his girlfriend quite frequently but this was just due to the stress of OWL examinations and being quidditch captain (or so Tina told herself). </p><p>The dark haired girl fell into a deep sleep and awoke then next day excited to begin lessons. Unlike most students, Tina thoroughly enjoyed learning and this year was going to be extra special as the school was now offering a new subject: Care of Magical Creatures, and it was to be taught by none other than famous author Newt Scamander. Many of the girls in the school had a crush on Newt due to his fame but not Tina, she was just interested in his creatures and what he had to say. </p><p>~●~■~●~■~●~■~●~■~●~■~●~■~●~■~●~</p><p>Newt was in the area allocated to him at the edge of the forest helping his creatures to settle in to their new home. He was excited at beginning his new job but admittedly a little nervous. Though he loved talking about his creatures to anyone who would listen, he was worried that he'd find it difficult to control misbehaving students. </p><p>Newt checked his schedule. Monday, first lesson: sixth years. This class shouldn't be too bad, he thought, at least all these students were here out of choice. </p><p>Slowly the class began to filter in to the space, chattering happily among themselves until Newt coughed to catch their attention. </p><p>Tina smiled as she was excited to meet the magical creatures. She looked around in wonder as she saw many creatures she recognises from fantastic beasts and where to find them. There was a demiguise sat under a tree, a few moon calves, a hippogriff and a nest of occamies.</p><p>"Good morning." Newt began happily but with a nervous undertone and not making eye contact with anyone. "Welcome to care of magical creatures. I'm professor Scamander. Since its the first lesson today I'll just be introducing you to some of my creatures today. A warning though, if anyone mistreats any of my creatures you will be removed from the class permenantly." </p><p>There were a few murmers across the class before Newt began enthusiastically telling the class about his creatures. Tina listened eagerly with great interest right until professor Scamander informed the class that they were free to go around and meet the creatures (making sure to bow before the Hippogriff of course). </p><p>Tina went straight over to the Demiguise who Newt had informed the class was called Dougal. Dougal took Tina's hand and got a smile back from the thunderbird. </p><p>"Hello There." Said Tina. Dougal smiled up at Tina and began guiding her over to the occamies. The demiguise quickly became very attached to Tina and took her around all the creature. The dark haired girl was so interested that she didn't even realise when the lesson ended and the rest of the class left. By this time, Tina was sat with Dougal and the moon calves. </p><p>Newt was quite pleased with how his first class had gone. Everyone seemed interested in what he had to say and there had been no difficult students. It was then he noticed that there was still one student sat with Dougal and the moon calves. Dougal was holding her hand which made newt smile. </p><p>"He seems to like you." Said Newt to Tina.</p><p>Tina smiled and turns to look at her teacher. "I like him as well. I like all your creatures, they're amazing."</p><p>"Glad you think so." Newt grins. "And who are you?"</p><p>"Tina. Tina Goldstein." </p><p>"Pleasure to meet you Tina. Your interest will definitely help you to do well in this subject."</p><p>Tina blushes because she likes doing well at school. "Thank you Professor. Would it be okay if I came down and helped you with your creatures some evenings?" </p><p>"That would be greatly appreciated. You can come down whenever you want." </p><p>Tina grins. "Thank you pro-" </p><p>An angry shout interrupted her. </p><p>"Tina! You were meant to meet me by the common room!"</p><p>It was Jamie. </p><p>Tina looked down. "Sorry Jamie, I was just speaking to Professor Scamander." </p><p>Jamie glares at Newt before grabbing Tina's wrist. "Come on." And he begins dragging Tina away. </p><p>"Bye professor." Tina said quickly before letting herself get dragged away. </p><p>"Goodbye Tina." Newt replied and watched after them suspiciously. It's not like you and Leta- a voice in his head tells him - you don't know the full story between those two. Newt agreed that he shouldn't presume things about a couple he'd just met but he had a nervous feeling in his tummy.</p>
