    <p>Something changed after Harry was possessed at the Ministry of Magic by Lord Voldemort himself. Something inside Harry changed and Voldemort felt it, and so he stared at him until the ministry officials appeared.</p><p>Harry stayed, as it was planned, at Privet Drive, and he was different. He didn’t talk to anyone, nor even wrote to his friends. People said that it was because he was mourning Sirius.</p><p>But after the Dursley’s left for the Holiday leaving Harry there, something happened.</p><p>Nobody of the Order saw Harry leaving Privet Drive but that night he appeared at the street smiling and talking very much affectively with a girl, not much older than he himself, and so they went into the house.</p><p>"Well, it seems that Potter is going to lose the v card, right?" Moody laughed at another member of the Order.</p><p>But, things inside very completely different as there were outside.</p><p>Harry was not Harry anymore, but something else. Something inside broke and disappeared gaining a new presence in his body, the scar opened and something become more alive than ever. Nobody noticed it, but Harry was long gone.</p><p>"Are you really sure that your parents are gone, Tom?" The girl asked. He tricked her and paid her for having sex.</p><p>And so they did a couple of times that night. They also smoked and drunk until late. She was hangover but the other presence was completely alright.</p><p>"I guess I’ll see you…" She left and was quite troubled walking. That body overpowered her a few times but the money was before everything and when she closed the door almost tripped but remained still, and chuckled with the simple think of it.</p><p>Harry or the presence there had changed his look after it went to Privet Drive; some might say that it was because Potter became the Lord of Black, and so inherited their looks. The glasses were no longer necessary, some weight was put in and a lot of height was included on that body.</p><p>That didn’t look like Harry Potter, but almost like a replica of Tom Riddle himself. He now was responding to the name of Tom and was more powerful than Harry was.</p><p>The Dursley’s came and Tom secluded in his room studying his books, doing his homework and buying new books to read. Nobody interrupted him but something annoyed him, that owl. It howled at him and Tom though of killing her without doubt, but need it the owl to communicate and buy more books to him, but still annoyed him.</p><p>That night he shrunk his possessions wandlessly by Parseltongue magic and ordered the owl to leave. Tom left taking his invisibility cloak and took a few streets away the Knight Bus and went to The Leaky Cauldron where he paid a room, until he started Hogwarts, by the name of Tom.</p><p>He felt free.</p>
