    <p>Ron stared at Harry and Hermione in a slight sense of shock, but more than anything, he could feel his temper rising. Getting upset was nothing to do in such a crowded place, with shoppers and waiters bustling around. </p><p>“What happened to you two during eighth year?” Hermione and Harry shared an amused glance, which Ron chose to ignore. He sipped the almost empty Butterbeer in front of him and set it down on the table more forcefully than necessary. </p><p>“The eighth years that went back are very close now, Ron,” Hermione said gently, grabbing one of his hands to relax him.  “There weren’t very many of us, and we all agreed that the past is past and there’s nothing we could do except apologize and move on,” Harry nodded his agreement and Ron sighed. He rubbed his eyes tiredly. </p><p>“I accepted a teaching position for DADA, that’s why we wanted to meet you, so I could tell you in person,” Harry said quickly before more on the subject could be said. Ron’s jaw dropped comically, and he clapped him on the shoulder. </p><p>“That’s awesome, mate!” Ron nearly shouted while Hermione smiled warmly at the two friends sitting across from her. <br/>A speckled black and brown owl flew up to Harry, landing on his shoulder with a soft hoot. Harry smiled fondly and broke his fry in half to feed it to the bird. While the owl ate, Harry untied the letter and opened it. </p><p>“Who’s owl is that?” Ron asked as soon as it had flown off. Harry, still immersed in the letter, only replied with an offhand “Narcissa’s.” As soon as he realized what he said, he slapped his hand over his mouth and looked up to see Hermione and Ron staring at him. </p><p>“Narcissa… Malfoy?” Ron asked carefully. Hermione cringed at how quiet Ron’s voice had gotten. Harry swallowed, half expecting Ron to blow up at him. </p><p>“Yeah, I’ve exchanged a lot of letters with her over the course of the year,” </p><p>“It’s not like Draco knows Harry talks to his mum that much,” Ron’s face flushed at the fact that Hermione had used the ferret’s first name. </p><p>“Let’s not make this a big deal,” Harry said, folding the letter and tucking it into his coat pocket. Ron sighed again, and Hermione seemed relieved that Ron stayed quiet on the matter. </p><p>“So, how’s Auror work going for you, Ron?” Hermione asked after a silent moment passed over the table. For the first time, Ron’s flushed face disappeared completely and he dove into a tale about how they had finally rounded up the last of a particularly tough group of rogue Death Eaters. </p><p>While Ron talked, Harry’s mind drifted to the contents of the letter he had received from Narcissa. She had invited him over for tea, which was not uncommon. However, she said she had a gift for Harry, and Harry’s curiosity was piqued. He could bring her favorite type of biscuit in return for whatever she had for him. </p><p>Harry’s attention was snapped back to reality by Ron and Hermione standing and appearing as if they were getting ready to leave. “I know you mentioned you had some errands to run, so we’ll leave you be,” Hermione said, grasping Ron’s hand as Harry nodded silently and they walked out the door together. Harry unfolded the letter and reread the contents. She has yet to mention Draco, and Harry was curious if they were on good terms after the war. Harry had never seen Draco on the occasions he’d been to the manor. </p><p>Harry got up, leaving a few galleons on the table alongside the small pile left by Hermione and Ron, and headed off into the crowd. Several people turned as he passed, but he only flashed a small smile and continued on his way to the entrance to muggle London, which he found was much quieter and much less confining. </p><p>Harry entered a sweets shop on the corner closest to an apparation point and headed straight for the large selection of biscuits on display. He picked up a few packages of Narcissa’s favorite type, florentine. The girl at the checkout seemed to take much longer than she needed to and was, in Harry’s opinion, way too excited to give him back his change. </p><p>When Harry apparated in front of the Malfoy Manor, he could feel in his gut that something was different this time. Not necessarily bad, but something seemed just out of place. He knocked three times and stepped back when a house-elf swung open the door for him. He followed the house-elf into the personal dining room, where Narcissa stood with a pleasant smile on her face. </p><p>“Harry, dear, it’s so good to see you,” she hugged him tightly, the smell of vanilla lingering even after she let him go. Harry always thought she was an exceptional hugger. </p><p>“I’m glad to see you-” Harry saw her notice the bag in his hand. “Oh, I brought biscuits,” He couldn’t help but chuckle when her face lit up, even though she tried to conceal it. </p><p>“You shouldn’t have,” Narcissa said, but she opened a package that Harry handed her and bit into one delicately. They fell into an easy conversation after that, both relaxed and laughing constantly. Neither of them noticed footsteps until there was a soft knock on the doorframe. Narcissa glanced over the top of Harry’s head and stood to welcome the visitor. Harry finally turned, eyes resting on Draco’s pale face. </p><p>“I was wondering if you were still going to that dinner tonight,” Draco said, confusion evident on why Harry was sitting having tea with his mother.  “The one that the Parkinson’s are hosting,” Narcissa considered for a moment. </p><p>“I suppose that starts rather soon doesn’t it?” Draco nodded, finally tearing his eyes away from Harry’s.</p><p>“Two hours,” Draco said. Narcissa’s brow furrowed, then she shrugged, which surprised Harry because it was such a casual movement. </p><p>“I’ll get out of your way,” Harry stood, feeling slightly awkward. Draco watched impassively, but Narcissa made a noise of protest, earning both of the boys’ attention back to her. </p><p>“I haven’t given you your gift,” Harry saw Draco glance between the two of them quizzically. Narcissa grabbed a book that Harry had failed to notice from the bookshelf and presented it to him. <br/>It was a simple black book with gold lettering reading ‘The Dark Arts &amp; Their Effects: Teacher’s Edition’. Harry grinned at a beaming Narcissa and accepted her hug. </p><p>“Thank you,” he said quietly and Narcissa stepped back slightly, keeping her hands on Harry’s shoulders. He flushed as she studied him with a faint smile on her face. </p><p>“I’ll see you again soon. Draco, would you please show him out so I can get ready for the dinner?” Draco nodded, walking out of the room and Harry followed. Neither of them spoke until they got to the ornate front door. </p><p>“Back off my mother, Potter. She’s married,” Harry choked, much to Draco’s amusement. </p><p>“She’s the one who reached out to me,” Harry said in defense, though it was half-hearted. Draco chuckled and opened the door for Harry, who found himself strangely satisfied with how the time at the manor had gone.</p>
