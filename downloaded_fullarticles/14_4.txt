  <b>Chapter 1: An Unwanted Warning</b>
</p><p>. . .</p><p><em> Pshhhh.  Pshhhh. </em>  A few seconds later the sound of a paper towel being ripped off of its roll.</p><p>Harry put down the spray bottle full of cleaner and wiped away at the picture frame he was holding.  It was only the beginning of a whole wall of Dudley that adorned the front hallway of the Dursley household.  The frame was painted bronze with carved edges that Harry was now scraping the dust out of. He held back a wince as a sharp pain flared up his bruised wrist as he cleaned.</p><p>Behind him was a cupboard under the stairs which the Dursleys forced him to sleep in for the first 11 years of his life.  Often, they would lock him in there for days, and Harry learned at a young age how to handle an empty stomach and no access to a bathroom.  Although currently, the only thing that was collecting dust in his cupboard was all of his school supplies.</p><p><em> Well, I did try to ask Vernon if I could have my school supplies back, and that ended poorly.  </em>Harry held his hand to his ribs, tenderly feeling the bruises that speckled his abdomen.  They had almost finished healing. He rubbed at the bruised wrist that he had used to shield himself from Vernon a few weeks ago, and then used his good hand to pick up the picture frame.</p><p>There was a scraping noise, but then Harry found the right spot for the nail and hung the frame back in its spot.  He didn’t bother to tilt it back to a perfect 90 degrees, he preferred a mildly sideways Dudley.</p><p>Anything related to magic was currently forbidden by the Durselys, they were terrified of Harry, and he was using that to his advantage.  Vernon allowed Harry to move out of his cupboard and into the room upstairs. Harry was grateful for the increased amount of space but still felt that he would start his second year at Hogwarts already behind compared to his classmates who had the whole summer to look at their new books.</p><p><em> Pshhhhhhhhhh. </em> Harry sprayed a bunch of frames at the same time, unconcerned at the extra cleaning solution that now dripped down the wall in between frames.</p><p>Harry had also wanted to show some of his spell books to his sister Calla.</p><p>Calla Lily Potter, the unborn child that nobody knew about when the Potters went into hiding, was a year younger than Harry.  She had been eager to learn anything and everything about the wizarding world. Harry hesitantly told her about his numerous near-death experiences as he, Ron and Hermione looked for the Sorcerer’s Stone last year: finding Voldemort in the Forbidden Forest, fluffy the three-headed dog, a giant game of chess, fighting off a troll, and coming face to face with Quirrell.  Calla was rightfully unimpressed at how frequently Harry seemed to find himself in danger, but none of her brother’s tales could lessen her excitement to attend Hogwarts herself.  </p><p>Harry realized he had been drying off the same perfectly poised photo of the Dursley family for a while now.  He grabbed the spray bottle and moved to the next row of Dudley portraits.</p><p>At that moment, Dudley opened his bedroom door and came thudding down the stairs.  He had a tough look on his face, one that seemed like it took the overweight boy a lot of concentrated effort.  Noise from the tv in his room told Harry he had just finished watching a boxing match. Harry picked up a delicate looking frame that hung next to him and slowly wiped at it with his paper towel.</p><p>“Hey, you know you’re almost skinny enough to be a punching bag,” Dudley barked, reaching the bottom of the stairs.</p><p>Harry sidestepped his cousin as he came barreling towards him and continued cleaning.  “That doesn’t make any sense. And your mom would be pretty upset if anything happened to these.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“You don’t want to fight me right now, Dudley, because you’ll probably break one of these frames,” Harry explained slowly. </p><p>Dudley had a dazed look but groaned once he realized he couldn’t hit Harry just for the fun of it. “But I want to fight people when I’m older, and… well, who else am I going to practice on?  Where’s your freak sister?”</p><p>“Hey, your, uh your dad--he said he wants you to look nice for his work friends coming over tonight, so maybe not a great time to fight someone,” Harry replied quickly.</p><p>“I don’t care, I need to practice my right punch,” Dudley swung his left arm through the air, “and Daddy won’t buy me a punching bag.”</p><p>Dudley’s hands were in fists as he walked out of the front hallway and into the kitchen.</p><p>Harry immediately worried for his sister, but he didn’t know exactly where she was.  He closed his eyes and allowed emotions to flood his thoughts. He forced himself to imagine <em> Dudley as a boxer, fists flying, hitting Harry, and he simulated the fear and surprise that comes from an unprovoked attack. </em></p><p>His breathing quickened, and he let the emotions spread deeper throughout his consciousness, and <em> he sat down against the wall, hands bracing the ground, defensive, unnerved, </em> to be sure that this would have the right effect.</p><p><em> Be careful Calla, stay away from Dudley, </em> he thought to himself. <em> Watch out for Dudley. </em></p><p>Harry paused and waited, hoping she had felt it.</p><p>. . .</p><p>Calla had been just putting away the trimmers in the shed when she noticed it.</p><p>Harry’s mind had always been familiar, even when they weren’t in the same room, it was always so easy for her to remember what the mist of his emotions felt like.  It was as if from his mind there was a little tendril of smoke, ebbing and flowing in her direction that Calla could at any moment pinpoint and describe. She could always reach out and feel her brother’s presence, she could always listen to how he felt. </p><p>Something had shifted though, Harry felt <em> afraid, and surprised, small, cowering, defensive, nervous, on-edge.. </em> . but things were cloudy and grey, so he was manufacturing those emotions.  In reality, he felt <em> worried, panicked, and anxious. </em></p><p>He was sending her a message. Calla continued to listen, waiting for words to form out of the mist.</p><p><em> Defensive, fists flying, he’s afraid, it’s unexpected, what is it? </em> Calla didn’t know for certain, but she walked out of the shed and towards the side of the house.</p><p>
  <em> Be careful Calla... stay away...Dudley. </em>
</p><p>The intensity of Harry’s somewhat forced emotions allowed his message to be much clearer.</p><p>The sound of Dudley opening the backdoor met her ears, and she quickly went around the house to the front door, opening it silently.  As she walked in, she met the green eyes of her brother. He looked up at her from the ground, and he smiled, relieved.</p><p>“Why are you on the ground?” Calla asked quietly.</p><p>“I wanted to make sure you heard me.  Stay out of range of Dudley’s fists.”</p><p>Calla said quietly, “Yep, I got it.  He’s been watching boxing again, yeah?” </p><p>Harry rolled his eyes.  Calla went halfway up the stairs and then leaned casually over the railing, listening for Dudley.  “Don’t upset Dudley either, okay Harry?” She said.</p><p>“Yeah, yeah.”  Harry stood back up and began wiping away at the frames he hadn’t touched yet.</p><p>Calla continued onto her and Harry’s bedroom.  The last year had been difficult with Harry so far away.  She had spent the first 10 years of her life figuring out how to read Harry’s thoughts, and Harry had learned how to mentally send messages to her.  The distance, however, made it impossible for her to read into Harry’s emotions.</p><p>Growing up, Dudley and Vernon would both take their anger out on Harry, and Harry did his best to protect Calla and used her skills at reading thoughts to do so.  There were a few times when Harry sent her images of a park near their house, and mentally sent her the words “Get out.” Calla knew when that happened that she just needed to get out of the house because Vernon was on a rampage, and Harry didn’t want to see her get hurt.  Unfortunately, that meant Harry would take the brunt of Vernon’s rage, but Harry made her swear to always get out of the house if he sent her that message.</p><p>Calla didn’t exactly know what she was doing at first, it took her a few years to realize she was hearing other people’s thoughts and not voices in her head.  Reading into other people’s minds felt so natural for her. Harry helped her figure out how to read into people’s minds, and Calla honed her skill with her brother.  What someone was thinking, they discovered, was closely linked with how they were feeling. Harry’s mind, when he was feeling very emotional, was an overwhelming symphony of colorful emotions and images.  People are easier to read when they’re emotional. So when Harry needed to send her an urgent message, he would force himself to feel emotions more dramatically. Calla would notice the change in Harry’s mind and the heightened emotional state that he put himself in usually helped Calla understand his thoughts, and Calla could translate the images into words much easier.</p><p>At least that’s what the two of them have figured out thus far, again, they had no idea what it was they were doing.</p><p>Trying to interpret thoughts wasn’t like opening a book and perusing through bullet point ideas as you would casually scan black-and-white phrases on a page.  In reality, Calla often sees images or ideas or memories or concepts which she later puts into words. Everyone’s mind had a unique flow to it, and she had learned the fingerprint of Harry’s mind quite well over the years.  </p><p>Calla enjoyed comparing her skill to watching smoke.  You can see it, and you know what shape the smoke might look like in one moment, but the smoke can swirl and shift into another image seconds later.  Anytime Calla tried to verbally describe what she was doing when she read into someone’s mind, it was like she was grabbing at the smoke and pinning it down...but smoke isn’t something that is meant to be held in your hands.</p><p>. . .</p><p>Harry and Calla had spent the rest of the day cleaning the windows, washing the car, mowing the lawn, trimming the flowerbeds, pruning and watering the roses, and repainting the garden bench.  It was half-past seven in the evening when at last, exhausted, he heard Aunt Petunia calling him in. </p><p>"Get in here! And walk on the newspaper!" </p><p>Harry was more than happy to move inside and out of the heat. On top of the fridge stood tonight's pudding: a huge mound of whipped cream and sugared violets. A loin of roast pork was sizzling in the oven.</p><p>"Eat quickly! The Masons will be here soon!" snapped Aunt Petunia, pointing to two slices of bread and a lump of cheese on the kitchen table.  Calla had already started eating her portion and she glanced at her brother with a frown. Harry washed his hands and bolted down his pitiful supper. </p><p>The moment he had finished, Aunt Petunia whisked away his plate. "Get upstairs now, and be quiet the rest of the night! Hurry!” Aunt Petunia shooed Calla and Harry out of the kitchen.</p><p>As they passed the door to the living room, Harry caught a glimpse of Uncle Vernon and Dudley in bow ties and dinner jackets. He had only just reached the upstairs landing when the doorbell rang and Uncle Vernon's furious face appeared at the foot of the stairs. </p><p>"Remember - one sound -" </p><p>Harry and Calla exchanged glances and crossed to their bedroom on tiptoe, slipped inside, closed the door softly.  Harry turned around, expecting to only be greeted by his snowy owl. </p><p>Instead, he found himself staring at a creature that was bouncing gleefully on his bed.  The little creature had large, bat-like ears and bulging green eyes the size of tennis balls.  Calla gasped and grabbed Harry’s arm, standing behind him.</p><p>“Er- hello,” said Harry anxiously.</p><p>“Harry Potter!  What an honor it is to meet you, sir!  And who is Harry Potter’s friend?” The creature’s voice was high-pitched, almost a screech, and Harry worried that it would carry all the way downstairs.</p><p>“This is my sister, Calla.” Harry stepped to the side a little as Calla let go of his arm.</p><p>“Allow me to take your coat, Mr. and Mrs. Mason,” Dudley said politely at the front door.</p><p>Dobby’s bulging eyes seemed to bulge even more when a look of surprise passed over his face.  “Dobby is humbled to be in the presence of you both.”</p><p>“Who are you?” Call said accusingly.</p><p>“I am Dobby, Dobby the house-elf sir,” the creature replied.</p><p>Aunt Petunia let out a laugh and invited the Masons into the living room.</p><p>Harry had a feeling that Dobby didn’t mean any harm, so he took a step towards him.  “Look, I don’t mean to be rude or anything, but this isn’t a great time for me to have a house-elf in my bedroom.”</p><p>“Dobby understands, sir, Dobby is only here to tell Harry Potter something… and I suppose to also tell Calla Potter the same thing, uh… it is- it is- difficult sir, Dobby doesn’t know quite where to-” Dobby continued to grab at his clothes with his hands, looking down at the ground, embarrassed.</p><p>Harry offered, “Well, why don’t you sit down?”</p><p>“S- Sit… sit, d- down? Sit down?” Dobby burst into tears, wailing loud enough that the voices downstairs faltered.</p><p>“Shhh, I’m sorry-” Harry was at a loss for what he had done to offend Dobby, and he looked at his sister, hoping she could maybe glimpse Dobby’s thoughts.</p><p>Calla moved quickly and knelt to look at Dobby at the same height.  “Hey, yeah Harry asked you to sit down because he is so kind, and uh he needs you to be kind to him in return and quiet down.  Please stop crying Dobby.”</p><p>Dobby covered his sniffles with his ragged clothes but was still breathing quickly.  He locked eyes with Calla and nodded in understanding.</p><p>“Dobby has heard of your greatness sir, but never, never, has Dobby been asked to sit down by a wizard, like… like an equal.”</p><p>Harry narrowed his gaze, not fully making sense of where this creature came from.</p><p>Dobby turned towards Calla and said “and Dobby has never met a legilimens with skills developed so young.  What an honor to have met you, how great are Harry Potter and Calla Potter!” Dobby bowed again.</p><p>“Well, er, thanks Dobby,” Calla said before asking, “What did you say about me?”</p><p>Dobby seemed delighted with himself to explain to Calla what she could do.  “Calla Potter is a legilimens. House-elves do not have the same magic as witches and wizards, but I can still feel when another is searching through my mind… your skills are impressive young Calla.”</p><p>Calla stuttered, “Uh okay...”</p><p>“So that’s what it’s called?  Calla is a legilimens?” Harry asked.</p><p>Dobby nodded and shifted his eyes to Harry.  Calla blinked, feeling lost from her attempt to look into Dobby’s mind. “That’s good to know, I guess.  And he doesn’t mean us harm, I could feel that everything he says is true, but reading him...felt different.”</p><p>Harry looked at Dobby.  “Well, he’s not human.” </p><p>“Yeah, it’s as if there were significantly fewer thoughts and they were simpler, but altogether it was a different kind of…” Calla made some motions with her hands and Harry had a look of comprehension.</p><p>“Right.  Well, I’m glad you don’t mean us harm, but why are you here Dobby?”</p><p>Dobby paced a little around the room as he spoke.  “Dobby had to come. Dobby has to protect Harry Potter and his sister.  To warn them. Harry Potter and Calla Potter must not go back to Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry!”</p><p>Calla looked baffled. “What?”</p><p>“There is a plot.  A plot to make the most terrible things happen.”  Dobby added in an urgent whisper, “If Harry goes back to Hogwarts, he will be in grave danger!” Calla tried to gather something from Dobby’s mind, but she had never seen images fly so quickly, everything was a blur.</p><p>“What terrible things? Who’s plotting them?” Harry asked.  </p><p>Dobby panicked and looked around his room and began banging his head against Harry’s desk.  The noise was definitely carrying downstairs.</p><p>Calla “Stop it, Dobby, punish yourself later! Please!”</p><p>Dobby stopped suddenly and tilted his head at Calla.</p><p>“He’s punishing himself?” Harry asked.</p><p>Calla furrowed her brow, still trying to interpret the frenzy of thoughts that were going on inside Dobby’s head.  Her head was beginning to ache, and she put a hand to the side of her head.</p><p>“I think, I don’t- it’s hard to tell-”</p><p>“Hey, that’s okay.”  Harry put a hand on Calla’s shoulder as she sat down and crossed her legs, looking Dobby in the eye.</p><p>“Dobby didn't mean to cause Calla Potter harm, Dobby never wanted to-” tears began to well up in Dobby’s eyes.</p><p>Calla squinted a little bit as she said, “Don’t punish yourself now, okay Dobby?  You make too much noise, and our aunt and uncle need us to be quiet, and if we don’t do what they say they won’t let us go back-”</p><p>“-they won’t let us eat meals, they’ll starve us if we make too much noise tonight, okay?  So we need you to be quiet,” Harry interrupted quickly.</p><p>Dobby nods again.  His eyes wandered around the room, and he opened and then closed his mouth.  He opened it again, “Dobby understands, ma’am. Dobby would not want to cause Harry Potter to be starved.  Dobby will wait to punish himself.”</p><p>Harry sat down on the ground next to his sister, relieved to hear the sounds of the dinner party downstairs continuing like normal.  “What’s going to happen at Hogwarts, you need to tell me Dobby,” Harry said in a stern tone.</p><p>Dobby shook his head and both of his tiny hands grabbed at his ears and pulled.  He gritted his teeth and let out a little squeal.</p><p>Calla sighed, “You can’t tell us what it is, okay, fine.  But we have to go back to Hogwarts, we don’t belong here.”</p><p>Harry agreed, “We belong in your world, at Hogwarts.  It’s the only place we’ve got friends.”</p><p>Dobby let go of his ears.  “Friends that don’t even write to Harry Potter, sir?”</p><p>“Well, I expect they’ve been… hang on-”</p><p>“You’ve been stealing Harry’s letters!” Calla deduced, seeing clearly into the mind of the house-elf now as he sheepishly reached into his clothes.</p><p>Dobby cowered and pulled out a stack of letters.  Harry could make out Hermione's neat writing, Ron's untidy scrawl, and even a scribble that looked as though it was from the Hogwarts gamekeeper, Hagrid.</p><p>“Dobby has them here, ma’am.” He looked upset as he stammered, “Dobby thought that Harry would not want to return to Hogwarts if he thought his friends had forgotten about him.  You mustn't be angry with Dobby.”</p><p>Harry held out his hand.  “Dobby, give those back, now!”</p><p>Dobby clutched the letters and let out sort of a scared squeal, evading Harry’s hand which tried to grab him.  He opened the door and in a few bounds was at the top of the stairs. Like a ping pong ball, Dobby rebounded down the stairs and raced towards the kitchen before skidding to a halt.</p><p>“Dobby get back here!” Harry whispered aggressively racing after the house-elf.</p><p>Calla followed behind her brother, trying to make as little noise as possible.  She leaned over the stairwell, not sure how to help. Harry was trying to get Dobby to get out of the kitchen doorway.</p><p>Dobby raised his arm and snapped.  The pudding that Petunia had worked on for hours now hovered above its plate.</p><p>“Dobby, please, no,” Harry begged.</p><p>“Harry Potter must say he won’t go back to school!”</p><p>“I can’t, Hogwarts is my home!”</p><p>Dobby looked pained.  “Then Dobby must do it, sir, for Harry Potter’s own good.”  He snapped again and the pudding moved silently towards the couch in the living room.  Harry pushed past Dobby and raised his hands trying to maybe catch it before it fell.</p><p>Calla put her hand in front of her mouth and looked at Dobby.  He had a funny look on his face, and while they were making eye contact, Calla tried to push through the racing thoughts to understand what Dobby was trying to warn them from.</p><p>
  <em> Blonde haired man, Dobby was being kicked aside, wizards showing up at a manor, it was an incredibly nice house, they were exchanging words, “raids by the ministry”, she saw a disgusted expression, Calla was looking up at the men from a low angle, as if from Dobby’s perspective... </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Dobby was talking to another house elf that was cowering in the corner and shaking his head, Dobby was trying to say something, it seemed urgent... </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Dobby was polishing a set of armor, ‘who keeps a set of armor in their house these days?’, Calla mused, suddenly the man with the long blonde hair burst into the room and went straight for the desk and looked furiously through the drawers, cursing to himself, Dobby looked back at the armor and watched in the reflection as the man seemed to find what he was looking for, something small and black that he clutched in his hand, Dobby wiped again at the armor, he was using a maroon cloth... </em>
</p><p>The sound of pudding falling ungracefully onto Mrs. Mason’s head interrupted Calla’s focus.  What followed was a few seconds of stunned silence in the Dursley household. Dobby looked back at Harry and then disappeared with a CRACK!</p><p>Vernon said, “I’m so sorry.  It’s my nephew, he’s very disturbed.  Meeting strangers upsets him.” </p><p> At first, it looked as though Uncle Vernon would manage to gloss the whole thing over.  He shooed the shocked Masons back into the dining room, promised Harry he would flay him to within an inch of his life when the Masons had left, and handed him a mop.  Aunt Petunia dug some ice cream out of the freezer and Harry, still shaking, started scrubbing the kitchen clean. Calla walked down silently and began helping him clean up.</p><p>As they were dumping the icing into the trash, Harry avoided Calla’s gaze.</p><p>Calla sensed Harry thinking something along the lines of, <em> what will Vernon do? </em></p><p>“Harry-”</p><p>“-it’ll be fine.”</p><p>Calla nodded, hands shaking as she wiped the floor clean.</p><p>“I uh, tried to look into Dobby’s mind, but it didn’t make any sense, I couldn’t figure anything out, I’m sorry…” Calla was not sure what else to say.</p><p>Harry didn’t reply but moved on to the section of the couch that had been most covered in pudding.  He listened to his uncle and hoped that if the rest of the night went well, the beating he would get later wouldn’t be as bad.</p><p>Uncle Vernon might still have been able to make his deal - if it hadn't been for the owl. Aunt Petunia was just passing around a box of after-dinner mints when a huge barn owl swooped through the dining room window, dropped a letter on Mrs. Mason's head, and swooped out again. Mrs. Mason screamed like a banshee and ran from the house shouting about lunatics. Mr. Mason stayed just long enough to tell the Dursleys that his wife was mortally afraid of birds of all shapes and sizes, and to ask whether this was their idea of a joke</p><p>Vernon had a demonic glint in his eyes.  He advanced on Harry, brandishing the letter and hissed, “Well go on, read it, boy!”</p><p> </p><p>

</p><p> </p><p>Harry looked up from the letter and gulped.</p><p>Vernon waved his finger at Calla.  “You’ve been lying to us this whole time?  Both of you aren’t allowed to use any of your freakishness while you’re here?”  Harry moved and stood between Calla and his uncle.</p><p>“Don’t touch her.  She did nothing wrong.”</p><p>“She’s a freak just the same as you are, BOY!”  There was a mad gleam in Vernon’s eye and he started to raise his arms.</p><p>Harry wrapped his arm behind him and held onto Calla.  Thinking fast he said, “and she needs to continue cleaning before the pudding stains the carpet.”</p><p>“FINE.  The freak can stay and clean up.  Boy, upstairs, NOW,” Vernon spat.</p><p>Harry climbed the stairs two at a time to stay ahead of his uncle who was barreling through the house behind him.  Vernon slammed the door to Harry’s room and was standing over him in a second.</p><p>He shook his head and waved his arm flippantly and spat, “You ruined this evening, you cost me what could’ve been the biggest sale of my CAREER!”  He swung his arm into Harry’s chest, where the bruises from a few weeks ago hadn’t fully healed.</p><p>Harry exhaled and fell on his knees, reeling from the pain.  Vernon kicked him in the side a few times, and Harry curled up into a ball so that his knees protected his chest.</p><p>“Stand up, boy!” Vernon yelled.</p><p>Harry didn’t move fast enough, and Vernon kept kicking at his legs.  Vernon finally grabbed Harry’s shirt and hoisted him up and slammed into his closet door.  Harry’s knees started to buckle so Vernon hooked his elbow into Harry’s neck and held him upright.</p><p>His fist swung at Harry again and, a few times at his head which smacked roughly against the closet door.  Black spots danced in his vision. Vernon let Harry fall to the ground and kicked at him again, making his head collide with the edge of his closet door.  Blood trickled down his face. Vernon took a step back and paused, breathing heavily.</p><p>“Now I’ll have to explain this to my boss!  You’ve cursed this whole household, you and your freakishness-”</p><p>Harry groaned and sat up, hoping that meant this was over for now.  He coughed. His entire chest ached.</p><p>Vernon heaved, “As if I haven’t already taught you how I FEEL ABOUT YOUR LITTLE TRICKS!”</p><p>Vernon grabbed Harry’s arm and forced him to his feet.</p><p>“Uncle, it won’t happen again, I swear-” but Harry was interrupted when Vernon slapped him across the cheek.</p><p>“Nothing should’ve happened tonight at all!  You went out of your way to screw things up for me!” Vernon tightened his grip on Harry’s arm, practically cutting off circulation and making Harry grimace.</p><p>“And do you know what else?  Now I know that you’re not allowed to use magic when you’re not at school!  And you’ve been taunting my Dudley with that for the last two months!” Vernon threw Harry onto the ground.</p><p>Calla heard a thud from the second floor as she sprayed more carpet stain remover.  She shuddered, fearing the worst for Harry. For the next ten minutes, she heard the sound of Vernon’s fist coming into contact with Harry only interrupted by Vernon screaming insults at her brother.  Calla cleared her throat and choked back a few tears. If it wasn’t already torturing enough to have to listen to this happen every time Vernon was angry at them, Calla could feel her brother’s pain through his mind.  She felt his hurt and his desperation.</p><p>A few years ago, Harry made Calla swear that she would never do anything to try and stop Vernon because that typically only ended up making the beating worse.  Harry would always take the blame, and anytime Vernon threatened Calla, Harry would step in, and Vernon usually didn’t go through the effort of trying to get past Harry to beat Calla.  Calla wanted so badly to try and protect Harry, but every time she did that, it made everything worse, and both of them ended up too hurt to take care of the other.</p><p>Finally, she heard the sound of Vernon’s footsteps going down the stairs and into the dining room.  Calla retreated into the kitchen and finished rinsing off the dishes as fast as she could. She grabbed a cloth and moistened it with cold water then moved towards her and Harry’s bedroom.</p><p>When she opened the door into Harry’s room, he had already pushed himself onto their bed and laid facing the wall, curled up on his side.</p><p>“Hey, you alright?  Oh, Harry…” Calla said sadly as she reached her brother.  She gently touched his shoulder and allowed Harry to roll over onto his back as he made a quiet whine of pain.  He opened his eyes and met his sister’s concerned expression but grimaced, and moved his arm so that it was clutching his side.  He tried to focus his eyes on his sister but his vision swam in front of him, and vertigo made his stomach lurch. He squeezed his eyes shut and took shallow breaths, trying to calm nausea.</p><p>Calla used the cloth to wipe at the blood on Harry’s face.</p><p>Harry swallowed and said, “Calla, I need you to try to-”</p><p>“Shh, it’s okay, just think it, and I’ll do my best to read them.”  Calla put the cloth on Harry’s forehead, allowing the coolness to soothe his aching head and she rested her other hand on Harry’s arm.</p><p><em> I need you to try and pick the lock on the cupboard again, </em> Harry thought.</p><p>“You want me to try to get to the cupboard?  I couldn’t do it last time.”</p><p><em> You can do it, while the Dursley’s are asleep, you’ll have as long as you need. </em>  Harry let out a breath and brought to mind his school trunk and the pocket that contained the medical supplies that he had snagged from Madame Pomfrey last year.</p><p>“You said to look in the pocket of your trunk instead of sleeping.  Oh, while the Dursley’s are sleeping. Okay, I hope I can pick the lock, Harry, I’ll try really hard.”</p><p>Harry made an “Mhmm” sound from his throat.  He lay very still, not wanting to move his arms or his legs because each of his limbs had received more than a few blows from his uncle.</p><p>Calla looked at Harry’s chest, fearing the sheer number of bruises that were forming under his shirt.</p><p>
  <em> It’s okay, Calla. </em>
</p><p>Calla’s face was set in almost a scowl, and she wiped at her face and the tears that hung in the corner of her eyes. “I’m sorry, Harry, I thought we would be able to get through the rest of the summer without stupid ugly Vernon just-”</p><p>Calla shook her head, trying not to become angry.</p><p>She grabbed the pillow and gently lifted Harry’s head so it was resting on the pillow.  Harry’s mouth twitched as the movement agitated his head. She watched as Harry forced his expression into something more neutral.</p><p>“Try to rest, Harry.” Calla put her hand softly on her brother's hand as reassurance.  She allowed herself to look into the smokey textures of Harry’s mind and saw the peace that he felt because she was here.  She saw his anxiety about whether or not he would be able to hide these injuries from his friends. She felt his sadness and guilt over tonight’s event, his confusion regarding Dobby, the lingering fear because of how aggressive Vernon was earlier. </p><p>She reached over him and grabbed the other pillow and pulled out the sleeping pad that the Dursley’s had given them for a second bed.  She set up her bed, but sat down and listened as the Dursley’s fell asleep.</p><p>She watched the unsteady rise and fall of Harry’s chest.  His expression didn’t show the amount of pain he was feeling throughout his body.  A bruise on his face started to gain more color as the hours passed. I’m going to figure out how to pick the lock on the cupboard one way or another.</p><p>. . .</p><p>
  <em> Thanks for reading!  If you’ve never read hurt comfort, and aren’t used to some of the violence, just know, that’s part of the genre! Let me know what you think about Calla, or what you want to see from the brother/sister relationship, as she is a non-canon character. </em>
