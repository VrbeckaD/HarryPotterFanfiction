    <p align="center">Chapter 1: Back to the Beginning</p>
<p align="center">By AllyBabyPebbles</p>
<p>Hogwarts loomed over the black lake still looking much like she’d always imagined muggles saw it, worn down and tattered at the edges, slightly overgrown with ivy and moss, but still a beautiful sight to behold, pulsing with potential and positive energy. The past few months working to rebuild had strenuous, and time-consuming, but it was ultimately very rewarding. At times, it even seemed as if the castle had aided the workers, how else could they be nearly finished a mere 3 ½ months after the final battle. Hogwarts would be ready for the students to return in 2 weeks’ time, and Hermione couldn’t wait to see it restored to its previous glory. She couldn’t wait to see the students return to fill the hall with the raucous noises of laughter and joy again. Of course, Hermione had already decided that as soon as the school reopened she would return to finish her lost seventh year, she knew that she could obtain practically any job in wizarding Britain without it, but she had never been one for quitting. At the tender age of eleven she had chosen to go to Hogwarts, and she would complete her wizarding education even if she did have to help save the world first. Her hope was that others would return too, to prove to their world that Hogwarts was once again a safe haven, and that the children, the very future, could grow and be nurtured here like the enumerable generations that had come before. It didn’t hurt that Professor McGonagall had decided that she and another returning student would be made advisers to the Professors, to further house unity and help the staff keep track of the student body’s mental and emotional well-being. Hermione secretly felt that McGonagall just wanted to give her an opportunity to have the responsibility of Head Girl, without usurping the current seventh years of their chance at the same title.</p>

<p>Draco Malfoy, once a scared little boy branded, by his father’s mania, with a mark that would never fade, a mark that changed the course of history (and not for the better of anyone), stood on the bluff looking over the lake onto what was once his safe place from the maniac living in his own home. He was engaged in an internal debate as to whether he would return to school or not (not that he truly had a choice), he had already spent the better half of four months in Azkaban, he had been cleared of all charges, but he told the Wizengamot that he wasn’t just a blind child, that he had known what the mark meant, and that he had willingly let Death Eaters into the school. He did amend that he had only done these things willingly because he saw it would be futile and deadly for him to fight this path, and as such he felt that he too should be punished alongside his father.</p>
<p>Harry Potter and Hermione Granger had stood for both him and his mother. Their testimony saved his mother from serious prison time, and she could return to magical society intact, as the interim head of the Malfoy house. Narcissa had chosen to fund many rebuilding projects and start a charity for the orphans of war. She had even invested in starting a school for young witches and wizards not yet old enough for Hogwarts. All in all, she was doing a bang-up job of putting the names Malfoy and Black back in the wizarding world’s good graces. Draco had been granted his freedom as well, but he had demanded that he spend some time in jail, even if it was just the few months until school began again. Draco ran his fingers through his shaggy, silver hair with a sigh, knowing that he would return to Hogwarts and complete his education. It had been a condition of his punishment, the Wizengamot had demanded that if they capitulate to his terms that he would not waste his magical ability and the great potential everyone knew was within him (even if they only grudgingly admitted it because Hermione mentioned that he was second only to her every year), they decreed that he would spend roughly three months in Azkaban, then return to Hogwarts to help the final steps of rebuilding, and then on September 1<sup>st</sup> 1998 he would return to the hallowed halls of Hogwarts as an eighth year student. He was supposed to meet McGonagall at the gates in a few minutes’ time, but he had needed the brisk air to help ease his fears and trepidation.</p>

<p>“Mr. Malfoy, so glad you could make it today.” The new Headmistress stated grimly, looking at the young man with something akin to worry.</p>
<p>“Hello Professor, or should I call you Headmistress now?”</p>
<p>“Either will work, or you could just call me Minerva,” she smiled in what she hoped was a friendly manner, “as you are of legal age, and we have all been through so much, it seems ridiculous to stand on such formality. However, when there are younger students around I will request our conversations to hold a more formal tone.”</p>
<p>“Yes, that sounds okay to me Pr-Minerva. But if that is the case I would hope you could use my name as well. I have recently been trying to separate myself from the image of my father in people’s minds.” Draco spoke in a quiet and reserved manner, that was more relaxed and vastly different from the arrogant, pompous child he had been. Minerva smiled sadly to herself as the reasons why he had changed flitted through her mind’s eye. Draco could practically read her mind, though he was not a very skilled legilimens. “Minerva, please, let’s not go there. Harry Potter won, Voldemort is dead, and I would very much like to begin moving on. Changing my future.”</p>
<p>“Yes, of course Draco. It’s just that you have been through so much for one so young, and then to practically send yourself to Azkaban…it’s just so asinine that Tom Riddle ruined so much of our world. Destroyed so many children’s lives…” Minerva spoke softly, as if raising her voice even an octave higher would shatter their newfound peace, “But, we should not dwell in the past. I will escort you to your rooms- “</p>
<p>“I thought I would just be staying in the dungeons…with the rest of the Slytherins…” Draco interrupted her, anxious to be in his home away from home again.</p>
<p>“Now Draco, you of all people know that the common rooms are only designed for seven years’ worth of students. You would have no place.”</p>
<p>“I’ll stay with the current seventh years.”</p>
<p>“That is not possible. The castle is a fickle beast, even more so now than ever before, I’m honestly not sure she will let you in…” Minerva warned gently, “If she does not, you must be re-sentenced, but we shall try this first. Now as I was saying, you will be staying in a new dorm will the other returning students of your year, what few of you there are.” Minerva lead Draco up the winding path towards the castle in silence, allowing him to process the potential outcomes of this new development.</p>
<p>They reached the steps of Hogwarts, and Draco looked up expectantly at the massive oak door. He slowly took the steps to the door, preparing himself for the inevitable rejection, with Minerva by his side. She pushed on one of the behemoth doors, and it gently swept inward with nary a groan, the reconstruction crews did very well. Minerva nodded to Draco, signaling him to attempt to cross the threshold, and he took one step with as much confidence as he could muster. There was a loud creak as the door swayed back towards them, almost shutting him out.</p>
<p>“Please, don’t close! Please…I need to be here, I am not ready to face the world outside just yet, and I so greatly desire to finish what I started here seven years ago,…I need to try and make amends and see this place for its beauty without the stain of my family’s blood purist crap…just please don’t shut me out.” Draco whispered fervently, almost as if praying. The door stopped moving, the castle was considering the boy before her doors, then the door swung fully open again, and both people on the steps heaved sighs of relief.</p>
<p>“Thank Merlin.” They said together as they strode through the entrance hall.</p>
<p>“Draco, I also want to inform you that, if this was your regular seventh year you would have been made Head Boy, as you are the second-best student, and were a prefect. However, I cannot alter the current seventh years’ titles, so I have made you and the would-have-been head girl a sort of liaison between the staff and students. You are to observe the younger students, and inform the staff of how to best help them with their post-war traumas, and to hopefully ensure that Hogwarts is once again a place that these children can feel safe, a place that they are excited to attend.”</p>
<p>“Hmmm…do you truly think it wise to have myself, the former Death Eater in that role?”</p>
<p>“Yes.” She did not elaborate, and he got the feeling she didn’t plan to.</p>
<p>“O-kay then. Will you inform me of who I will be sharing this honor?”</p>
<p>“Hermione Granger of course. She does not however know you are returning, so it may be quite the shock for her. I’m not honestly sure who all will return, they were all sent letters offering, but we will just have to wait and see. Thankfully the dorm room is set to alter itself as needed once the term begins.” They approached were quickly approaching a portrait of the final battle, and Draco knew that would be the door to their dorms, veterans of war, some heroes, others not so much…but all touched by darkness. They reached the portrait, dark washed with bright lights of spells arching across the castle, thankfully there were no people in this portrait, just the castle and representation of spells, and Minerva whispered, “Virtuti Viribus Victoria.”</p>
<p>“Valor Strength Victory…I do not fit here Professor, only the heroes should reside within this room…”</p>
<p>“Oh, young Mr. Malfoy, you have shown all those traits and more. Now go, get settled. I shall see you in the great hall for dinner. Your room will have your name on the door.” With that she glided away from the boy, and left him stunned and tired. He did not know if he was truly making the right choice, but he certainly hoped to live up to the man Minerva McGonagall thought he could be.</p>
