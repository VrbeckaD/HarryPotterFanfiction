<p> </p>
<p>“I swear what I’m doing is fine, I don’t need help,” Remus said, his voice filled with annoyance as he curled his hands into fists. His mouth twisted into a scowl. “Stop pacing around like a fucking loony,”</p>
<p> “Please,” Sirius murmured biting his tongue to stop himself from saying something stupid, “I hate seeing you get hurt, especially during a full moon,”</p>
<p> “I’m your-”  Remus hesitated as the handcuffs rattled against the radiator,  “Friend,” He added after a moment’s hesitation - as if he meant to say something else.</p>
<p> Sirius felt his heart jump in his chest, it was pathetic, Remus knew exactly how Sirius felt, the sort of love pulls you in so deep there’s no escaping, forever stuck in a loop of bitterness and pining. Neither of then addressed it, both of them too cowardly to face the music, perhaps destined to skirt around each other and never do anything about the weird sexual tension that seemed to constantly hover between them. </p>
<p> Sirius had realised his feelings for Remus a couple of years ago, at the beginning of his fourth year in Hogwarts. Amidst the endless whirlwind of studying and pranks there was always this nagging feeling in Sirius that he did, in fact like Remus. He had told James first, panicked and extremely confused. James took the news surprisingly well, unlike Peter who just wrinkled his nose and said “But you don’t like me - right?” </p>
<p> “Please get help,” Sirius asked again, looking down at Remus’s now slumped figure, sitting on the ground. “For me,”</p>
<p> “Fuck. Off.” Remus said through gritted teeth, his voice sounding tired, “I’m not going to Snivellus for help, go to bed,”</p>
<p> "And what?” Sirius wanted the tight angry feeling in his chest to go away, he wanted to lash out and smash any creepy Black family heirloom in arm’s reach. Many priceless heirlooms had been the subject to Sirius’s wrath over the years, much to Kreacher’s dismay. “Cry myself to sleep while you tear yourself to pieces?”</p>
<p> Remus scrunched up his face, his mouth  no longer scowling. “I love you, Sirius, you’re my best friend, and even though we’re stuck here in your childhood home while our friends are getting killed by Voldemort just because I’m broken and dangerous - you make everything seem a little bit better, but for the love of God just leave me alone!”</p>
<p> Sirius could feel the heat crowding his face as he stared in dismay at Remus.Remus casually throwing around the word ‘love’ was a common thing yet every time he said it, the tiny glimmer of hope that Remus felt the same way still burned inside Sirius as if someone had cast a Lumos spell inside him.</p>
<p> “I love you too,”  Sirius coughed out, forcing himself to look into Remus’s eyes - the green of his eyes barely visible compared to the golden colour that surrounded his pupils. “But you better get help,” </p>
<p> “Can you please leave now?,” Remus said, this time without any malice in his voice. Sirius wanted to kiss him, not an unusual thought, but for some reason he leant down and before he realised what he was doing, he kissed the hinge of Remus’ jaw. </p>
<p> Remus froze before letting out a soft throaty noise. The noise shocked them both and Sirius stumbled back, tripping over a cardboard box in his hasty attempt to regain his composure. </p>
<p> “I assume that wasn’t a platonic form of affection,” Remus said, somewhat smugly. </p>
<p> “Jesus,” Sirius groaned as he dug his fingernails into the palm of his hands, “I should not have done that,” </p>
<p> Remus shifted slightly, his hands pale against the navy blue of the radiator and the golden handcuffs.The last time they used silver handcuffs they had burned Remus’ hands so badly they bled for days afterwards. “Why?” </p>
<p> “Because,” Sirius began, multiple excuses instantaneously forming in his head, ode to the times in Hogwarts when he had to worm his way out of detention. “I didn’t - I don’t think you feel the same way,” </p>
<p> Remus opened his mouth as if to speak but instead of words there was a low growl. Remus was transforming at possibly the worst time, which was probably expected seeing as Sirius did decide to have a heart to heart with him minutes before the full moon reached full height.</p>
<p> “I swear, I’m fucking cursed,” Sirius said under his breath before slowly backing away, watching as Remus rolled his shoulder slowly, his transformation ready to rip through him like wildfire. </p>
<p> Sirius climbed up the wooden stairs, turning around to look at the man that he was completely and utterly in love with before shutting the basement door and locking it.</p>
<p> “Definitely and absolutely cursed,”</p>
<p> </p>
