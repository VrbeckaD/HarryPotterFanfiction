    <p>Ch1</p><p>(Forests outside of Konoha)</p><p>She couldn't believe that she didn't see it coming. She should've known that something was up when those old bags of bones have been silent for the past few years; she just figured that they had given up on trying to destroy her career and life as a shinobi. Of course, nothing they say could do anything since she was backed by the hokage and all her friends are the heirs of the famous clans of Konoha and their parents like her.</p><p>Safaia couldn't help but feel that they were planning this for the past four years as she was rising up in the ranks and becoming more and more popular with the other shinobi. It also didn't help that her closest friends are heirs to their respectable clans and would back her up no matter what shit the council threw at her. This was probably why they waited until they managed to get all her friends and their parents to leave on missions, Tsuande and Shizune to leave for Suna for a meeting, and Jiraiya on an information gathering mission, to throw her out.</p><p>Safaia was just a few months shy of her seventeenth birthday, not that it mattered since the Kyuubi had already fused his chakra and knowledge with her when she turned sixteen. Don't get her wrong, Kyuubi is still alive and well inside his seal in her, he's just no longer a threat to her or to anyone else. Well anyone else who is a friend of hers, her enemies are just a group of people who he would love nothing more than to devour their souls. Nobody knew that this had occurred, but it still made the civilian council members worried that she wasn't on a tight leash and at their beck and call. Safaia is loyal, that part is true, but she's only loyal to the hokage and the village, not to them.</p><p>Standing at only 5feet 5inches, Safaia was popular with many male shinobis and civilians. She was a combination of being a tomboy, not afraid to get down and dirty, and a sophiscated woman, perfect at seduction. Despite constantly training her body and being on many missions, she has a slender hourglass build and her breasts weren't large, but they weren't small either. Her eyes were a blue color, the same blue as the gems she is named after. Her golden blond hair once cut into a short chopped style when she was a child now fell down to her waist in a high ponytail tied with a single long black ribbon that trailed through her locks. She wore a pale orange camisole under a fishnet tank top. Tight black pants tucked into boots of the same color. Tied around her waist was a dark blue pouch containing only a few money which the council was so "generous" to give her.</p><p>As the two ANBU guards escorted her through the forest, Safaia couldn't help but find it hysterical that while the councils would love nothing more than to kill her, they didn't in fear that the shinobi part of the village would rise up and revolt. So the only thing they can do is to seal off her chakra, in hopes that she would die from not being able to protect herself, and banish her. Pity that they didn't look closer to make sure that they had indeed cut off her chakra level, oh well it's their mistake for not being careful around her. Haven't anyone told them, she's a lot her parents when it comes to personality and tricking people.</p><p>"Sorry about this, Uzumaki-san," the ANBU wearing a cat mask said.</p><p>"The hokage's gonna flip," the other ANBU wearing a lizard mask said.</p><p>Safaia shrugged her shoulders and continued walking. "It matters not," she said, "I'll just figure out something else to do with my life." She waved her hand goodbye without looking back.</p><p>Her sharp hearing listened as the two leaped into the trees and disappeared back to the village. She turned her head with her blue eyes glistening mischievously. Safaia knew that the councils were aware of her heritage and she couldn't help but laugh at the events she knew will happen the minute she's gone from the village.</p><p>                                                            /-/</p><p>(Konoha)</p><p>The minute the ANBU had escorted Uzumaki Safaia, no Namikaze Safaia, out of the village, the members of the council immediately headed back into the Hokage Tower. As they hurried down into the basement, you could feel the air tense with excitement and greed. Now that she's gone, they can finally take what they've been after ever since the Yondaime Hokage died. Located in the basement was where the Sandaime Hokage had placed Safaia's inheritance from both her mother and her father.</p><p>They had campaigned for many years to take the money, property, and scrolls from her, claiming that she was no longer Namikaze Safaia, but a demon incarnate masquerading as her. The Sandaime Hokage refused to hear about it and even threatened to throw them all in prison for treason if they continued, so they waited until he died and began to bring it up again when Tsuande became the new hokage. They immediately learned it was a big mistake. Tsunade didn't have the tolerance to hear them repeat several times like Hiruzen Sarutobi; the first few minutes they began to talk about Safaia not deserving her inheritance and that it would be better suited to be given to the people, aka them, she threw them all out of the room and had ANBU surveillance them to make sure they won't do anything. But now that the hokage is out of the village and the demon is gone, nothing can stand in their way.</p><p>Standing in the basement was a circle of candles held up by silver stands. Attached to each stand was an oil slicked rope that stretched out into the center where their prize was sitting. Tied up in the rope was a large scroll that contained everything the Namikaze and Uzumaki had owned and left for their daughter. To get the scroll, one must place a drop of their blood into the flame to neutralize it, and if the blood does not belong to someone of Namikaze or Uzumaki blood, the flames would travel on the rope and destroy the scroll. Before they were never given enough time to properly get to the scroll, but now they have all the time in the world.</p><p>"Quickly turn off the trap," one person said, his voice laced with greed and anticipation.</p><p>"Calm down, there's no need to rush," Danzo told him. He signaled for one of shinobi from Ne to appear.</p><p>The Ne shinobi took out a weapon that was in a shape of a boomerang with the inside curve armed with a sharp blade. In one quick swoop, they threw the weapon, eliminating the ropes in a single turn.</p><p>All was going according to plan and soon Danzo couldn't wait until his hands were on the scrolls that were filled with techniques and strategies Minato Namikaze and Kushina Uzumaki had created and formed. He could care less for the money, the others could have it for all he cared, but the jutsus, the things that made the two feared and powerful, is all he wants.</p><p>It was a pity that they had forgotten that Hiruzen Sarutobi was known as the "Professor" for a reason. Because the minute the boomerang had returned to the Ne shinobi's hand, the large scroll immediately disintegrated, leaving no trace or evidence.</p><p>"What happened," Koharu shouted, "Where did that scroll go?"</p><p>Nobody knew the answer and became quite disappointed that they weren't able to get what they had wanted. Danzo, on the other hand, was cursing out his old rival and began to make plans for his Ne to go out and retrieve Safaia, where he's pretty sure is where the scroll vanished off to.</p><p>/-/</p><p>Safaia had managed to reach the only port, which would take her to outside of Hidden World. She reached into her pouch and fingered the hitai-ate Iruka-sensei had given her after the mess with Mizuki when she was twelve. The councils had wanted to take her hitai-ate away and destroy in front of her, knowing full well how much she cherished the item. Because they were able to look past any genjustsu, she did the next best thing, she transfigured an empty can into a hitai-ate and just watched as they triumphantly destroyed it.</p><p>How she managed to transfigure it, no one, but Sarutobi-jiji, Baa-chan, and Ero-Sennin, knew. This was a good thing, since if the council has gotten word that she wasn't just a shinobi, but also a witch, they would most likely force her as a breeding tool. Her father was a native from the Hidden World, her mother, on the other hand was from an island located just outside of the Hidden World known as Uzu no Kuni. While Uzu no Kuni is located on the outside, they do also have a shinobi village and what many outsiders don't know is that the village isn't just made up of shinobis but also witches and wizards.</p><p>A large scroll appeared by her side, still wrapped up in ropes. Safaia looked at it with a knowing glint in her blue eyes. "They really didn't waste any time trying to get my inheritance," she said, "Good thing it's been programmed to come to me if anyone were to try and steal it," she said. Waving her hand over the scroll, she shrunk it and placed it in her pouch.</p><p>"Now, where should I go? Should I head over to England where Emerald is? Or over to Japan where Haruhi is?" she thought to herself. Safaia crossed her legs and leaned back on the bench, sighing as she started to weigh her pros and cons on heading over to England. "Let's see, the pros would be that I could continue my study on magic and I get to see Emerald again. The cons would be that chances of Dumbledore wanting me to help him fightin the war is about ninty-nine to a hundred percent possible. It would also suck big time if Dumbledore decides to go and hire shinobi from Konoha and the council gets word of seeing me there and decides to drag me back and use me as a breeding stock."</p><p>Safaia shuddered from the idea of being treated like an animal whose offspring would be sold to the highest bidder. "I guess the only place to go would be Japan where Haruhi," she said. The last time she had seen her cousin was a year before the death of her aunt.</p><p>Sarutobi-jiji had been looking for any hints of her having relatives left, hoping for a chance that someone would finally accept her as a human being and after six long years of searching, he finally discovered that Kushina had a brother, who was also the only other survivor from Uzu no Kuni's destruction, that was living in the outside world in Japan. Her uncle, was a wizard, but didn't follow a shinobi's path like her mother had done, had fell in love with another witch. The two of them had gotten married and now have a daughter named Haruhi.</p><p>Safaia reached into her pouch and pulled out an object that she had kept hidden for the past ten years. She looked at the cellphone and muttered to herself, "First thing I've got to do is to update this old thing." She started punching in numbers and held the object to her ear, listening to it ring several times.</p><p>"Moshi-moshi," the familiar cheerful voice of her uncle said.</p><p>"Ryo-ojisan? It's Safaia. I have a…slight problem…" She explained her current situation. When she was finished, she listened to him wail and curse the council for treating his niece so unfairly. After waiting for her uncle to finally stop after ten minutes, he immediately ordered her to come 'home.'</p><p>Safaia closed the phone after he hung up. "Already on it," she said, getting onto the boat that had finally arrived.</p><p>                                                           /-/</p><p>(England)</p><p>On the other side of the world, Emerald Potter had returned home for the summer from her fifth year in Hogwarts. Emerald sat on in the backyard, doing her usual chores given to her by her aunt. As she was pulling out the weeds, she began muttering, "What the hell is wrong with those idiots? I told them that Voldemort had returned and killed Cedric and did they believe me last year? Nooo…" She sat straight up. "And I know he knows about the Deatheaters attacking the Department of Mysteries so that would mean they're up to something. Why the hell isn't he broadcasting it out so they can prepare themselves?" she complained, throwing the weeds to the ground.</p><p>Emerald Potter, known as the Girl-Who-Lived, stood at 5feet and was short for her age. Her shoulder-length wavy hair was pulled into a low ponytail to keep the strands out of her eyes. A pair of thin black framed glasses sat up on her nose shielding her vivid green eyes which resembled the gems which her parents named her after. Nothing about her screamed out of the ordinary except a small lightning shaped scar hidden behind her long bangs with were swept to the side. While her face would give people an impression that she spends hours in front of a mirror, the items of clothing gives a different approach. She wore loose baggy faded blue jeans and hung around her waist with a green T-shirt that she was able to shrink down to her size.</p><p>Thinking about that battle wasn't really helping since she was reminded again of her godfather's death. First Cedric and now Sirius, it's like she's a walking magnet for people dying.</p><p>As she stared at the flowers, she could remember the cold stares and the whispers behind her back as she was entering the train, she now understood what her cousin went through as a child. Technically, Safaia isn't her cousin, but rather the two of them are related to the same cousin, but still Emerald couldn't help but understand just how she was able to keep sane and still want to protect that village she called home. This isn't the first time that people had doubted her and called her a liar or a secret Death Eater and she knew that they would never stop. Emerald is nothing like Safaia. She can't continue to protect a place that refuses to listen and just hide away from their fear with words of coldness and hatred.</p><p>If they refuse to listen and ends up dying because they didn't prepare for Voldemort's return, then that's their problem. Because there is just no way she is returning back to Hogwarts, a place where everyone, but a few friends, distrusted her and would rather listen to rumors. She stood up and immediately knew what to do.</p><p>She entered into the kitchen area, where her aunt was reading a magazine. "Aunt Petunia, there's something I need to tell you," she said.</p><p>While Petunia hated her niece since she was a constant reminder of just how perfect Lily had been, she looked up and gave Emerald her attention.</p><p>"I'm not returning to Hogwarts in September," she told her, "In fact, I'm not staying in England. I'm gonna head over to Japan where Uncle Ryouji is, since I'm pretty sure that Uncle Vernon will try to chase me out of the house."</p><p>She called him Uncle Ryouji when in fact Emerald is related through his wife. His wife was a witch from England who had disowned herself when her parents refused to allow her to marry a man from Japan, while they were happy that she had chosen a wizard, they were horrified to learn that the man she had chosen was a penniless foreigner. When they began to arrange a marriage, Karen Potter had disowned herself at the age of eighteen and changed her name to Kotoko Fujioka after marrying the man she love. She ended up studying law and became one of the best lawyers around until her accident which lead to her death.</p><p>While Kotoko severed all ties with her parents, her cousin, James Potter, never lost touch with her and would always send letters along with pictures of his own daughter and wife up until the day him and his wife died. Since then, Kotoko grew frantic on what had happened to her small niece and asked some wizards and witches who were her friends in Europe to find out what had happened to Emerald. When they had managed to track down Emerald, Ryouji stayed behind to watch Haruhi as Kotoko went to England to see her niece. In the beginning, the Dursleys refused to allow her to have contact, saying that she's one of those freaks, but with a little help of magic, she managed to convince them that she was a distant relative of the Evans that was transferred to work in Japan.</p><p>They had even able arranged for Emerald to stay in Japan for the summer, which the Dursleys allowed since that meant she would be out of their hair for a few months. Those few months in Japan was the best, especially when she had met Uncle Ryouji's niece, Safaia. It was there that Emerald had learned the truth about her parents' demise and her heritage. Emerald, Haruhi, and Safaia ended up becoming close friends and the revelation that the three are able to connect with magic made their bond even closer. They had ever saw each other after that summer, but were still able to keep in touch via owl.</p><p>"Call him, make sure he accepts before you do anything," Petunia ordered, thrusting the phone into her hands.</p><p>Emerald dialed the familiar numbers and held her phone to her ear. Her heart began to beat faster as she grew nervous. What if he decides that he doesn't want to see her? What if he refuses to allow her to even come visit?</p><p>"Moshi-moshi?" an energetic voice came through. Emerald was immediately reminded of all the times her uncle would start trying to get her to wear pretty dresses or put ribbons in her hair.</p><p>"Ryouji-ojisan? This is Emerald. I was…"</p><p>"Emerald-chan! How are you doing? It's been so long," Ryouji squealed in excitement.</p><p>Emerald began to tell him what had occurred, which caused him to scream and curse the same way when he heard something happened to Safaia.</p><p>"It's ok, Emerald-chan, you can come and live with me. In fact, Safaia is also coming to stay so it'll be just like old times," Ryouji told her, "Just tell that aunt of yours that I'm letting you stay and she'll book the first flight to Japan for you just to get rid of you."</p><p>Emerald looked over at Petunia. "Ryouji-ojisan said that I can stay with him," she told her aunt.</p><p>Petunia grabbed the phone. "I'll make the arrangements and you get packed," she told her.</p><p>Emerald knew that the hidden meaning in that sentence was to hurry up and leave the house for good. She quickly rushed to her room and began to pack her trunk.</p><p>                                                           /-/</p><p>(Japan)</p><p>Haruhi was done with another crazy day at school and was already heading up the stairs. She blew the bangs of her short brown hair out of her brown eyes and sighed. Haruhi looked over at the uniform the Host Club had given to her and noticed how she needs to iron out the wrinkles. She opened the door and there was her father putting dinner on the table.</p><p>"Haruhi, papa has some great news," Ryouji said happily. Since it was his day off, he wasn't wearing a dress, just some loose gray sweatpants and a white T-shirt. His long red hair was pulled into a low ponytail with a white bandana tied around his head. "Do you remember Emerald-chan and Safaia-chan?"</p><p>"Otou-san, we send letters to each other every month," Haruhi said, rolling her eyes. She placed her bag down by her desk and sat down to the table. "Why do you ask?"</p><p>"Well, the two of them will be staying with us from now on," Ryouji said. He explained in full detail about what had happened while insulting and threatening to kill the ones who hurt his dear nieces.</p><p>As Haruhi listened with one ear, she couldn't help but wonder, "How are we going to fit so many people in this small apartment?"</p><p>"Haruhi, dear, we do have magic, don't you remember?" Ryouji said, shaking his head. His daughter may be intelligent, but sometimes she doesn't think outside of the box.</p>
