    <p>Chapter 1<br/>
Everything was perfect in Remus<br/>
Lupin’s life. He had a good paying job and a  beautiful partner. He was loved by many, but one day his perfect life came crashing down around him. It was storming out and he was late for work, the last thing he remembered was running to his car when he was hit.</p><p>Years later he had moved home and had closed himself off from so many. The man was miserable and living a life where someone else had to take care of you and do everything for you. </p><p> Nymphadora Tonks a talented young<br/>
woman who tried her best to bring a smile to anyone's face. Currently was working at a local shop. Everything was well, the regulars liked her, she did amazing at her job. That is what she thought until it was the end of her shift and her boss had to tell her heartbreaking news that her had lost the job. Spending the next weeks applying and getting rejected. </p><p>Finally she saw it. An add in the paper saying they needed a caretaker as soon as possible. To her surprise she got a call asking her to go for an interview right away. Getting ready she quickly made her way to the large home. The smile never leaving her face, until the interview actually started.<br/>
“So Miss.Tonks do you have any experience in this field of work?”<br/>
“Well no..” The smile fades slightly<br/>
“Then why did you apply?”<br/>
“I just really needed the job.” She admits looking at the woman across from her. The woman got up and walked to the other room. Leaving Dora to sit and wait. After a few minutes she returns and looks at her.<br/>
“How soon can you start?”<br/>
“Now” the young woman said happily. The smile returning to her features.<br/>
“Alright. I guess we should introduce you to Remus then.”<br/>
Dora nodded and stood up. Following the woman to a second house looking around she smiles.<br/>
“Remus dear. Please come out”<br/>
A door slides open and a man came out. He looked over Dora and gave her an odd look.<br/>
“Who is she?”<br/>
“Your new caretaker”<br/>
“She knows how to do that?” He said with a hint of judgement. Dora smiles at him.<br/>
“Hello I'm Nymphadora Tonks” she says brightly. “But please call me Dora”<br/>
“Alright Tonks. I'm Remus” he said with a nod.</p>
