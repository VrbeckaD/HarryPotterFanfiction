    <p>When the War had ended, Harry had guessed he would finally escape the press. Which he did, for the record, after the excitement caused by Voldemort’s death had settled.</p>
<p></p><div>
  <p>Well, for the most part.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>A couple of years had passed since the Boy Who Lived had saved the world, and most people hadn’t mentioned him at all in a long time. Children were growing up without hearing his name. Papers avoided talking about the War. Which is why he was so surprised by Hermione’s request.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"You want me to <em>what</em>?" he asked, bewildered.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"As a favour!" she argued. "Please?"</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Harry sighed, taking a sip of his tea. He guessed lending his face and story for an interview wasn’t really that bad... And Hermione knew how much he hated attention from the press, so he reckoned she wouldn’t ask if it wasn’t important.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Hermione was sitting in front of him in her and Ron’s kitchen, her own cup of tea in her hands. “It would help so much,” she said, confirming his suppositions. She squared her shoulders, adopting her Ministry Official posture and voice. "As much as people have been trying to avoid the situation, Wizards’ mental stability and well-being have reached a record low because of the recent War." She breathed in a bit shakily, and Harry guessed the same gruesome images of the War were flashing before her eyes.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>She was right, of course she was.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"So, what, you need me to go on record saying that it’s okay not to be okay?"</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Pretty much!" She took a sip of tea, before adding: "We need a mental health awareness campaign, with photos and interviews. The Ministry did train and provide funds for a good amount of therapists and counsellors to be available, but no one visits them! It’s...not part of your culture, or something like that."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Hey," Harry protested, "I was raised a Muggle."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"I know, right, and that’s why you’re okay with going to therapy!"</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Um-umm," he said, quickly, taking a big gulp of tea.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Harry."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Yeah?"</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"You <em>are</em> going to therapy, ain’t you?"</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Harry sighed, and Hermione just glared at him, waiting. If she’d been a cartoon character she’d be tapping her foot impatiently. The image amused Harry, for just a second, before he remembered it really wasn’t a good idea to piss Hermione off, ever.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"I did go! I just....stopped, that’s all!" He was going to add some kind of excuse, but Hermione was still glaring, and he knew she was right. "I’ll go back," he promised, "and I’ll do the interview."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Hermione’s shoulders relaxed, and she got up to wash her now-empty cup. Harry watched her walk to the sink, thinking the conversation she wanted to have hadn’t gone so bad after all.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>That is, until she turned her head around slightly, not looking at him, just enough for her voice to carry, and added nonchalantly: "Oh, by the way, the photos? They’ll be done by Draco Malfoy."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Harry was willing to render many things public, but he would never, ever, reveal that he choked on his Jaffa Cake upon hearing that name– and that he might have simply coughed to death were it not for Hermione’s quick reflexes and precise magic skills.</p>
