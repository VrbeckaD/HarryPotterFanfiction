    <p>His heart raced as he ran carelessly through the thick forest. Limbs of trees and terribly thick foliage tearing into his skin, tearing at the thin kimono, the only clothing on his back as he desperately tried to escape his pursuer.</p><p>“Damn it!” Harry hissed, partly fear, partly anger as he slipped, his momentum significantly slowed for his mistake. He should have kept focused! Not panic like some first-year Hufflepuff on their first trip to Hogwarts. That, he knew wasn’t fear, Hufflepuffs were one of the few genuinely brave people he had known. They weren’t brave for glory, or even prestige. They were brave because for them loyalty was everything and helping others above themselves was the only instinct that truly mattered.</p><p>“Just leave me alone!” Harry screamed in fury, heart beating wildly. A thunderous echo that was far more painful than it ought to in the confines of his chest. His skin was slick with sweat, and the heat was unimaginable, his round glasses fogging over as he swiftly took another turn, loose dirt falling away for such a sudden movement. Damn, he sounded pitiful, even with his wand held tightly in his hand the wood, feeling much too odd in his hand like it didn’t belong.</p><p>It didn’t.</p><p>The wand belonged to Draco Malfoy. He snatched it from him in the struggle, surrounded by Death Eater’s, Voldemort a menacing image at their backs.  He remembered it as clear as day, or maybe midnight would have been a better word. There had been the terrible chime of a clock, loud and echoing in the ministry of magic. The ceiling of glass painting a beautiful picture as moonlight peered through to touch his pale skin. Hermione had been kidnapped. Both she and Ron, and they the Order, ran like fools without a plan to rescue her.</p><p>It was, of course, a trap, just like that year in the Department of Mysteries.Just like that year, he had seen his godfather plummet to his death, for what else could possibly lay behind the Veil. Why hadn’t they learnt, why hadn’t <em>he </em>learnt. For their foolishness, they ran right into an attack. Before they knew magic reigned, wild and furious as they attacked. The burn of fire and something like lightning stifling for every spell that was let loose and never much caught its target. </p><p>He had taken down Death Eater after Death Eater, for once trying to get away from Voldemort instead of facing him head-on. It hadn’t been the time, he was much too unprepared to truly duel the man. He hadn’t been a fool then and he wasn’t a fool now. He knew trouble when he saw it, knew when he would be outmatched!</p><p>Ahead, Harry could hear the roar of a river, maybe a falls even. It was suicidal but it could be his chance. He didn’t think as he changed his path once more. The man that was pursuing him without pause, almost taunting as his concealed power licked at his own magic, tried to pull him, would he really go further if he flung himself over a falls. It sounded stupid, but the pause would be enough for him to apparate. Apparate to where he didn’t know. Once he could jump and vanish, the man would think him dead and stop his pursuit, none the wiser about his magic.</p><p>After all, this wasn’t wizarding Britain or even muggle Britain anymore. This was a place wholly undiscovered. How he got here was the next question, well it all had to do with that same night. Despite his attempts to escape from Voldemort, regroup and actually <em>plan </em>for once in their life he had been captured. He might have been skilled, but one wizard against a horde of psychotic fanatics who didn’t care a lick if they lived, once they killed you, was too much.</p><p>His wand had been broken. He felt like something had ripped at the delicate tissues of his heart, a pain much too terrible that for a moment he had doubled over in pain gasping desperately for breath.</p><p> It was all they needed. Before he knew it, Voldemort had him under the curciatus curse. It honestly wasn’t needed if he was being honest, the severing of his bond with his wand for that split second was crippling enough, at least the shock of it. He had a pretty good inkling that Voldemort, the no nose limp dick bastard knew it, and just put him under the damnable cruciatus curse for kicks.</p><p>Bloody, snake-faced bastard!</p><p> He didn’t have the time to think much of it then, but he was hauled to his feet, Voldemort and his maniacal laughter in the background. To be honest, through the pain, it was like he was underwater. He could hear order members screaming desperately, the hiss of spells over his head, feel the tight piercing grip of whoever was hauling him to his feet.</p><p>He glanced up briefly through blurred vision. He saw blonde hair.</p><p>Malfoy.</p><p>“The Veil,” he had heard, a whispery breath. Voldemort much too amused, much too smug for that to be anything good. It accorded to him then, they were going to throw him through the bloody Veil. Bloody hell, he was really going to die this time! He had fought with almost all he had, almost. He had to admit that for a second the idea of death was a pleasant one. A beautiful dream where he would see his parents again. His mother’s red hair that he had only ever heard about, his father’s smirk that often times could be considered cruel depending on whose perspective it was. He wasn’t so sure he could trust Snape’s memories, or maybe he didn’t want to believe the image that had been painted and shattered his world that one night.</p><p>Bully came to the forefront of his mind, just boys being boys another voice would whisper almost convincingly.</p><p>Through the struggle he had grabbed at Malfoy’s wand, Draco, he realised and blasted off the first spell that had come to mind. Avada kedavra, his green eyes widened in shock at the words that left his lips, no the words hadn’t escaped his lips. A non-verbal cast of the spell, Malfoy senior, the victim of the spell crumpling to a lifeless heap, Draco Malfoy screaming in pain and denial.</p><p>The man out of anger had flung him through the Veil without mercy then, blue eyes that sometimes looked grey in the right light wide unquenchable rage. Voldemort with his wicked grin, red eyes alight with lust for such violence. a looming presence behind him.</p><p><em>“The boy who lived, only to die”</em> Voldemort mocked, the only image and sound he would process before he plummeted into never-ending darkness, the cold kiss of what should be death at his lips.</p><p>“No matter how far you run, I will still catch you.” The voice slammed into him, tearing at his memories like a train that had derailed and was sent spiralling into a building. Explosions, casualties and all! He almost tripped again, heart hammering, threating to just bloody well burst out of his chest and leave him for dead as the ghost of fingertips touched his neck. He didn’t even think as the falls came into sight, he flung himself over willing one of his plans to actually work for a change!</p><p>He shut his eyes, willing away the initial fear. If this didn’t work he would have leapt to his own death quite foolishly! He waited for the feel of wind cutting into his skin, for his ears to become clogged and his mind blank as he fell. It didn’t come! Instead, a strong hand grabbed him, fingers digging painfully into his skin as he was left suspended, no dangling over the cliff. He didn’t want to open his eyes and see the truth!</p><p>No! It should have worked damn it! It should have—</p><p>Harry opened his eyes, fierce glare set in place as he was met with the emotionless visage of his relentless pursuer. His dark eyes spelt nothing and almost seemed bored with his regard.</p><p>“Going somewhere?” The man muttered, not even hesitating as he hauled Harry from over the cliff and none too gently released him at his feet.</p><p>“Why yes, yes I was! It’s not every bloody day that I find myself in ownership of an express ticket to kill myself over the cliff!” Harry hissed, even as the man hauled him to his feet, without a care wrapping painful binding wires around his wrist. He fought, of course, almost got away once, only for every attempt to prove futile.</p><p>“What the hell do you want from me?!” Harry shouted, resisting as the man pulled along, rope secured around the binding wire. He didn’t get an answer, didn’t expect one either. If there was one thing he figured out, it was this man that had hunted him, was a man of very few words.</p><p>Few words, or was it that he had failed at the language after all?</p><p>When he had been flung through the veil, he had expected death. He didn’t know what it would feel like, what to expect, but death he thought was a sure thing. He had been terribly ignorant to believe anything could have been so easy for him!</p><p>One moment he had been falling to his death, the next he had awoken in terrible pain, not a stitch of clothing on his body and Draco Malfoy’s wand grasped tightly in his hand. There was this young girl that had been at his bedside, startled by his abrupt entrance to the world of consciousness. He had shouted at her, asked her where the hell he was, and where was Voldemort. The woman hadn’t understood a thing, and when she opened her mouth, he realised that Potter luck might have just struck again.</p><p>He had cursed Voldemort, and that pointy faced prat Malfoy for landing him in the strange situation, once he realised that, bloody hell! He was in some alternate dimension! Or something. Then it hit him, he had killed someone, he had used the very same curse that had taken his mother’s life to take another’s, even if they were trying to kill him first.</p><p>It proved too much, he broke down, and that poor woman, with her strange language, was the only comfort he had.</p><p>He learned that he was in some place called Kusagakure, some country in the Elemental lands. It was a mixture of modern and outdated, almost like the Wizarding world, but better maybe. He learned of the Asian like culture, or maybe it was Asian and the art of the Shinobi and the life of a civilian.</p><p>He wanted nothing to do with it!</p><p>That’s what he had said till he realised the state of the village he lived. The people were poor, they were suffering. Their crops did not grow and they had nothing to trade. Their people died from illness, and as much as their local medicine women and men tried, they themselves could not carry the burden. Then there were the rogue ninja and bandits, and the threat of the military force called the Sound.</p><p>Harry’s golden heart bled.</p><p>He couldn’t do much, but he knew something of how useful runes were. Harry had beat it into his skull not to dismiss things because they were difficult. He wasn’t awfully good, passable maybe. Passable was all these people would need.</p><p>His magic, thankfully still worked, even if something felt strange about it. He chalked it up to the broken connection with his wand. A wand he was slowly working on repairing.</p><p>He used runes to help the village crops grow, help set up shields that at made those with ill intent ignore the village within reason. If the person was close enough they would of course still see the village. It was as he said, he wasn’t all that good with runes. The villagers had been thankful, clothed him and housed him, slowly but surely taught him their language.</p><p>For months he could barely string two words together, but after some time it got better. He still couldn’t write the language, but that was ok, he hadn’t planned on staying, he wanted to get back home. Find Ron and Hermione, kill Voldemort.</p><p>Every action had a reaction though.</p><p>His runes had gained the interest of some man called the Snake Sanin. Before he knew it he had to abandon the village. His presence would only bring them danger. With tearful goodbyes he was left to run, the man’s dark-haired lackey hot on his heels.</p><p>At that Harry jerked himself out of his muse, watching that broad back that pulled him to only Merlin knew where.</p><p>“Your name is, Sasuke Uchiha, isn’t it?” Harry glared, he was just striking up a conversation. He wanted to see what he could get out of the man, maybe he could escape again. Run further this time, disguise himself because now this man knew what he looked like.</p><p>Sasuke didn’t even acknowledge him, pulling harder at the ropes as Harry lagged behind.</p><p>“They say you killed an entire village just because you felt like it.” Harry continued. It was Gryffindor move, stupidly antagonising his capture, but when had Harry Potter ever known to quit. Maybe if he got this Sasuke angry enough, he would lose focus, give him the opening to use his magic, take the man off guard and apparate blind.  The man would know about his magic, and he would be put in more danger, but he was sure he could manage.</p><p>Sasuke, of course, didn’t rise to the bait, he simply glanced over his shoulders with those cold eyes before continuing on his way, and rope purposely pulled tighter.</p><p>“You talk too much.” Was Harry’s only answer and it made him terribly angry, but for once he kept his mouth shut. For a moment he stopped walking, green eyes turned to the sky that had clouded over, thunder rumbling in the distance. A crow took flight, squawks loud only to be consumed by the roaring wind. Harry felt cold, the thin kimono he wore no true help against the elements of nature.</p><p>For a moment as he continued walking, realising that he had lost Draco’s wand and that his still unprepared one was sealed away in a rune at his ankle. He wondered how the hell he was going to get out of this one.</p><p>And when dark eyes pinned him in place again, so cold and emotionless, he resolved himself to escape as soon as he could, lest he be caught in this lackey's web.</p>
