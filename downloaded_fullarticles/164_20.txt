    <p>
  <span>Ava hesitated before the door of the shop and glanced up at the wooden sign dangling over her head. On the chestnut surface, a hooded witch stirred a deep red cauldron, which was curiously engraved was the smoky, horse-like figure of a thestral. The morning sun threw the sign’s shadow against the shop window, drawing her eyes to neat red letters painted on the glass: The Scarlett Cauldron. This was the right place then. There was no mistaking it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She tried not to think about why a symbol of death would be on the sign of an apothecary; it seemed like a bad omen. If things went wrong, she would be driven out of town at best. At worst, she would be arrested. But she was out of options, and it was better she try her luck in the isolated countryside instead of a big city like London. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taking a deep breath, she pushed through the door into the shop, which was pleasantly cool and dim compared to the warm, blinding day outside. A little bell jingled happily in greeting as she entered, and an amiable female voice called from out of sight in the back, “I’ll be right with you!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ava hovered just inside the door, blinking repeatedly in adjustment to the abrupt light change, and the longer she stood there, the more she saw. It would have appeared that if an item had anything to do with a potion, this place had it. There were numerous tables and shelves that displayed everything from cauldrons, to recipes, to readymade vials, to jars of more ingredients than she could count or name. The shop clearly lived up to its reputation of being one of the best-stocked in Britain, which would have been odd due to its isolation if not for its close proximity to Hogwarts. To Ava, it was an extraordinarily lucky find, and hopefully one that would work to her benefit. The less people around, the less likely anyone was going to get hurt. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>A young woman entered from another room. She looked about Ava’s age—in her early twenties—and her appearance for the most part was simple and practical. She wore a plain white blouse and a black skirt and stockings, and around her waist was a belt full of pouches and multicolored vials. Braids were looped through her long blond hair, and she had strikingly beautiful sapphire eyes that were as wide and friendly as the smile on her cherry lips. “How can I help you?” she asked cheerfully. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you Penny Haywood?” Ava asked, painfully aware of her nonnative accent. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The witch’s expression stayed pleasant, albeit curious. “Please, call me Penny. And you are?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Avalon Br—” She broke off before saying her last name and corrected herself. “Er, you can just call me Avalon. I was told you’re the best potioneer this side of Britain.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Penny laughed. “I may try, but that’s an exaggeration. You’ll find that Professor Snape over at Hogwarts is leagues more skilled than I am.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maybe.” Ava said slowly. “But I was told you’re a person who can be trusted.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh?” Penny’s demeanor instantly became wary. A black and white cat suddenly hopped onto the counter next to her, and she looked at it for a moment before returning her gaze to Ava. “Who told you that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ava shrugged and answered honestly, “Anyone you ask really.” She realized she was off to a bad start. “I’m sorry, that sounds suspicious. I would never ask you to brew anything illegal, believe me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Penny raised her eyebrows. “So you really do want me to brew a potion? You’re not here to—” She broke off. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Here to what?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She shook her head. “Never mind. It’s not important. What’s your request?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And here is where it got complicated. “Well, you see...” Ava hesitated, uncertain how to phrase her words in a way that would elicit an agreeable response. “I was wondering if, uh...if you knew how to brew a Wolfsbane Potion?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>All the color drained from Penny’s face. The cat’s ears pricked up, and its tail twitched agitatedly. “Why would you need a Wolfsbane Potion?” she breathed. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, I mean, it’s not for me,” Ava stumbled. “Not exactly. I’m a Magizoologist, and you know, I work with creatures. And it can be dangerous going into the wild, so I’d thought it’d be good to have some on me. And...” She trailed off with a sigh. She was only talking about one of the most expensive potions in existence. “I know that’s not how it works. I don’t know how to make a good excuse when there’s really only one use for it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Werewolves, you mean,” Penny said, her voice an octave higher. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Er...yes. As I said, it’s not for me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sorry, but I can’t have anything to do with werewolves.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Oh, no, this was most definitely going poorly. Ava had hoped she could avoid prejudice here, and from the people she had talked to, it had sounded like Penny Haywood was the most kindhearted and openminded witch she would ever find. But apparently werewolves didn’t count when it came to giving chances, and her stomach sank with the realization. “Please,” she insisted. “I would’ve done it myself if I knew how. You don’t have to actually brew the potion if you would teach me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I can’t. I’m sorry.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then the supplies! Just sell me the ingredients and I’ll figure it out.” Although that was far easier said than done. Her Potions skills were passable, but they were nowhere near proficient enough to tackle something as complicated as Wolfsbane without messing up catastrophically in the first few attempts. In this situation, that was something she didn’t have the time or money to afford, and Darius wasn’t much better than her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think you should leave my shop,” Penny said flatly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m begging you. You know it will be so much worse if she doesn’t drink it. The full moon is in two weeks. I can try to control her, but if I fail, people could die.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Penny stared at her silently, her expression blank and pale. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you think I’m some kind of criminal?” Ava asked. “Well, I’m not, so you can tell your Animagus friend to stop hiding!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was a beat. Then the cat shifted, leaving another young witch sitting on the counter in its place. She was of similar height and age to Penny, although her face was rounder, and her build was broader than Penny’s dainty form. Ava was tempted to say she looked like a warrior, even if it didn’t quite fit. She was dressed all in black by way of a tunic with a blue gem set in the chest, and she wore a long-sleeved shirt and long skirt underneath it, with silver swirls accenting the fabric. She also adorned leather boots, fingerless gloves, and a similar potion belt to her companion’s. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The witch brushed her wavy brown hair back from her light blue eyes, the latter of which were wide with surprise. “How’d you know?” she asked. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ava attempted a smile. “It’s always in the eyes,” she said. “That’s where the humanity lies.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The other woman nodded, clearly impressed. She then put a hand on Penny’s shoulder and leaned close to her with a gentle murmur, “Pen, you’re not thinking clearly right now. We help anyone that needs it, remember? It sounds like someone needs it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Penny closed her eyes. “I know. It’s just—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know. Why don’t you go upstairs? I can take care of it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, it will go faster if I do it.” She addressed the witch directly, not looking at Ava. “I’ve never made a Wolfsbane Potion before. It’s highly difficult, and the ingredients are rare and expensive. I’ll have to do an evaluation.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do what you have to,” Ava said. “I’m prepared to pay any price.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Penny nodded and disappeared through a back door. Ava let out a breath in relief. That had been a near disaster. She wasn’t out of the woods yet, but it was more progress than she had made in weeks. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sorry,” the other witch said sincerely. “She doesn’t normally act like that. Werewolves are a bit of a touchy subject.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Bad experience?” Ava asked. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You could say. It’s not my story to tell, but there’s so much irony in your presence here that it’s not even funny.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ava cringed. Of all the places she could have picked, she had gone with the one that had a bad history with werewolves. Just her luck. “I know there are some really bad werewolves,” she said, “especially with current politics, but I promise you my friend’s not like that. She’s a victim of a terrible situation that wants a normal life. That’s it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The witch gave her a reassuring smile. “I believe you. You wouldn’t ask for the potion otherwise.” She hopped off the counter and held out a hand. “Lilianna Flores, but I go by Lily. I used to work in the creature trade. Customs and Transport.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ava shook her hand with a grin. “Nice to meet a kindred spirit.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Likewise. Why don’t we head upstairs for some tea, and we can talk things over up there.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lily led Ava through a door in the back of the shop, which opened into a short hallway, and then took her up a flight of stairs. They pushed through another door into the main room of a cheery little apartment. In contrast to the dim stone room downstairs, this area was all honey-colored wood and bright bumblebee hues of black and yellow. There were plants everywhere too—sitting on shelves, hanging on the wall, and dangling from the ceiling. The room had a warm and homey feel, and Ava relaxed a fraction in the new environment. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lily indicated for Ava to take a seat on the sofa while she moved into the kitchenette to prepare a pot of tea. “Do you mind if ask where you’re from?” she said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ava chuckled involuntarily. She always laughed when someone asked her that question because it never had a simple answer. “I was born in the southeastern US, but I’ve always moved around too much to really call any place home.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Because of your job?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yep. My mom was a Magizoologist too, so my family never sat still, even when I was a kid. The longest I was in one place was when I was at Ilvermorny.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I can understand that. I had my other job for my first five years out of Hogwarts, and it felt like I was traveling every other week.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is that why you stopped?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, I loved it, but I was needed here.” Lily passed her a steaming teacup and sat down with her own in hand. “The real question is,” she said seriously, “what brings you here?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ava hesitated. That was also complicated. And sort of illegal. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lily looked her in the eyes, her expression kind yet solemn. “If you want our help, then you have to tell me. I’m not walking into anything blind.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ava looked into her cup but didn’t drink. A tea leaf floated up from the bottom and drifted back down. “You say that,” she said quietly, “but you ask me to blindly trust you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fair point. Tell me what you like then.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A tawny cat strutted into the room and butted its head against Lily’s legs. She set her cup down on the table and pulled the cat into her arms, scratching the purring feline behind the ears. This one was just a cat. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You have experience with werewolves?” Ava asked. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lily nodded. “All kinds. I work with one on occasion.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then you know the laws around them are horrible and backwards. It’s even worse in the States than it is here. Things were getting bad, so I had to get her out of there. At least for a bit.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lily raised her eyebrows. “You brought her here? Illegally?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I brought her here perfectly legally as a human. But...there is a slight chance she may be unregistered, yeah.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t blame you,” Lily said slowly. “Or her, but this may not be the best place to be right now. I don’t know if you’ve heard, but You-Know-Who is back, and he’s been swaying the werewolves to his side. Britain is not a safe place, especially for your friend.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m well aware,” Ava replied. “Believe me, I don’t want to be here long either. The original plan had been to apply for Dragonologist positions in Romania and then head straight there when we got the jobs. But Wolfsbane Potion has become impossible to get in the States, and when we ran out, we had to make our trip to Europe a lot sooner than planned. I had hoped to find some here, but it’s been more than a little difficult.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lily gave her another reassuring smile. “Well, Penny and I can help you with that part at least.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ava matched her smile with a grateful one. “Thank you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is your friend safe?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, for now. She’s in an isolated location, just in case.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good. If you or she need anything else, just let me know.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The door opened, and the cat squirmed out of Lily’s arms and bounded over to Penny with happy meows. The young potioneer scooped it up and carried it with her as she joined them, absentmindedly stroking its fur. Ava caught Lily rolling her eyes. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is everything alright?” Penny asked. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think so,” Lily said. “What about with you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, I should be able to brew the potion...”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ava’s breath caught. There was a “but” coming.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“...but I checked the stores. We don’t have all the ingredients, and the ones we’re missing are extremely hard to find. Tracking them down in a week may be impossible.” She paused and looked directly at Ava. “I also told you I’ve never made a potion like this before. If I mess up, your friend could die.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ava already knew that, but hearing it said aloud dragged claws over her heart. “We’ve talked it over plenty of times,” she said as calmly as possible. “She’s fully aware of the risks.” In the end, it came down to protecting Diana or protecting the lives of those she might kill, and Diana’s choice had always been clear. Ava had tried arguing with her in the past, but now she knew it was a fight she would never win. She had the scars to prove it. “Not to put pressure on you or anything,” she continued with half-hearted humor, “but you’re our last resort.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Penny was silent for a moment, her face impassive. Then she nodded slowly, a spark flickering behind her eyes. “Okay. I’ll do what I can. Lily, if I give you a list of what we need, can you get it to Jae?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lily grinned. “Definitely. It’ll cost more than a few favors, but he’ll make it happen.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If you want, I can pay upfront,” Ava offered. That was policy in most apothecaries and potion shops. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lily opened her mouth to respond, but Penny cut her off. “No, not in this case,” she said seriously. “You will only pay when you have a properly brewed potion in your hand. Not before.” The potioneer’s sudden intensity took Ava by surprise. It was like someone had flipped a switch and replaced her with a different person, one that was more certain and determined. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’ll send you an owl when we have the ingredients,” Lily said. “I assume you’re staying at the Three Broomsticks?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Uh, yes,” Ava replied with more uncertainty than she would have liked. She made a mental note to get a room at the inn before she seemed any more suspicious than she already was. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s a plan then,” Lily declared. “We have a week to brew the potion and two weeks to come up with a backup plan if we fail. Either way, we’ll figure something out.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m going to make sure everything else is prepared,” Penny said, handing the cat back to Lily. “You know where to find me.” She hurried back out the door. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lily’s grin widened after she left the apartment. “You gave her a challenge and a time limit,” she told Ava. “This is great.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It is?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Pen does her best work under pressure. If anyone can make your potion, she can.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Let’s hope so.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ava found her optimism encouraging, but as much as she wanted to believe everything would be okay, her past experiences with reality kept her in check. She would only relax when the moon was waning, preferably with Diana healthy and safe. In the meantime, she would do her best to prepare for every outcome possible, but if something went wrong, she doubted that it would be enough. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>As quickly as she could without obviously rushing, she finished her tea with Lily and left the shop with the assurance that she would be waiting nearby. The bell jingled once again as she pushed through the door into the hot summer day, and she had to pause to shield her eyes from the blinding sun. Something moved in the corner of her eye, and she turned to see a large dog climb to its feet from where it had been lounging against the building. It had the appearance of a shaggy greyhound with a long reddish-brown coat, and it looked at her expectantly with its blue-green eyes. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Come on,” she told him. In other words, </span>
  <em>
    <span>Not here.</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She strolled casually down the street, as if simply taking in the sight of the quaint shops and houses of Hogsmeade, while the borzoi trotted by her heels. What she was really doing, however, was scanning for a gap in passersby, and she found one about a block before she reached the inn. She took the opportunity to duck into a narrow alley between buildings, and the borzoi followed her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>In the scarce cover of the shadows, he shifted, and within seconds Darius towered over her, all legs and lean muscle just like his Animagus form. He leaned back against the brick wall and crossed his arms over his chest, giving her a serious look. “You really need to work on being discrete,” he said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She rolled her eyes. “Like you could’ve done any better. How much did you hear?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nothing after you went upstairs. So?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“They’ll do it, but they have to get more ingredients. It’ll be close.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Can they be trusted?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I like to think so,” she said, “but I don’t know. I’m going to wait at one of the local inns, but you and Di should stay out of sight, just in case.” If Aurors came after them, it would be easier for them to get away if Ava was the only one being chased. She also had the best chance of slipping away unnoticed, which was the whole reason she had been tasked with getting the potion in the first place, but even though Darius knew that, he clearly wasn’t happy about it.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not going to sit completely still,” he informed her grumpily. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fine,” she said, knowing she couldn’t control him. “But you still need to keep a close eye on Di. This is going to be a tough one for her.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You don’t need to tell me,” he sighed. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She shoved his shoulder, just hard enough to make him shift his feet. “Then stop wasting time talking to me. Get back to her!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His lips pulled back in a remarkably canine snarl, but he shook his head when she flashed him a playful smile. “You’re a pain,” he said, but his shell was cracking. Something in his face changed, and before she could identify it, he briefly and awkwardly hugged her. “Be careful,” he murmured in her ear.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You too,” she said, embracing him back. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He gave her one last serious look before he Disapparated, leaving her alone in the alley, and she struggled to focus her thoughts on the task at hand. She had to rent a room at the Three Broomsticks so she could get the potion when it was ready. That was the next step, and there was no point in worrying about anything else until it was over with. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But as she continued down the street, her boots clunking softly on the cobblestone beneath them, a thought surfaced that she had been trying to avoid. Darius didn’t hug her often, and when he did, it was usually for one of two reasons: she was mad at him...or he thought he wasn’t going to see her again for a long time. </span>
