    <p>It was three years since the victory of the Battle of Hogwarts.</p><p>Hermione Granger began working at the largest department of the Ministry of Magic; the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. She was starting her first week at the division of the Improper Use of Magic Office. She would be taking on cases that included the maintenance of the necessary concealment of magic. This sometimes involved travelling to different countries within Europe and investigating certain cases that required the direct involvement of Muggles.</p><p>Today she was working in Liverpool. Following her day of investigating a Muggle's pub downtown, she decides to unwind over a drink.</p><p>A twinkling chandelier hangs over a large piano where a pianist plays a soothing riff. Mirrored walls hang from behind the bar which holds a large selection of fine alcohol. Decorative string lights drape across the mirrors. The rest of the lighting solely relied on the variety of candles that line the walls. The bar is mostly empty aside from a few groups of Muggles who sit in booths in the corners of the room.</p><p>Hermione takes a seat at the dimly lit bar closest to the window and retrieves her favorite book. She unwraps her scarf with one arm while setting down her purse with the other. Promptly burying her nose in her book, she holds up a finger to get the bartenders attention.</p><p>She moves an elbow out of the way as someone works a towel against the surface beneath her. The movement of the person's hand slows down and stalls temporarily. She blinks a few times while keeping her eyes on the book.</p><p>"I'll take a glass of Chardonnay, please." She glimpses over the book while watching the person's hand accelerate in movement. They throw the rag to the side and retrieve an empty glass from behind the bar.</p><p>The cling of the wineglass hits the bar surface. The bartender's fingers weave around the bottom post of the glass while pouring it three-quarters of the way full.</p><p>Hermione does a grateful nod while pressing the glass against her lower lip. Her eyes casually flutter upward and latch onto the person standing across from her. She goes slack-jawed once her brain registers the familiar person she was currently observing.</p><p>He's a young man with sleek beach blonde hair that sweeps across his forehead. He's wearing a black apron over a black dress shirt with the top button unbuttoned. He has a defined jaw line that appears to be clenched with his mouth in a thin line. His stormy grey eyes ignite against the candlelight that flares beneath them.</p><p>Hermione's hand clutches her chest as she accidentally inhales her sip of wine. She relentlessly coughs out while pressing a napkin up against her lips. "Draco?" she coughs. "Is that really you?"</p><p>The blonde swallows while gripping the bar top in front of him. "Granger. Long time no see."</p><p>Before she can say anything back, his eyes irritably dart to the side while tossing the rag over his shoulder. He leans his forearms against the bar while tending to the Muggle on her right. He keeps shifty eye contact with Hermione while taking the person's drink order.</p><p>Hermione watches on as the blonde calmly pours a pint of blonde ale and slides it to the Muggle. After using the cash register machine to print the tab, Draco tears the receipt from the device and shoves it in a black slip. He hands the check to the Muggle before bending over and picking up a rack of freshly cleaned glassware.</p><p>To her surprise, he walks behind a curtain separating the bar to the kitchen without a word. Her mind is full of untidy thoughts. It simply didn't add up. She hadn't heard of Draco or the Malfoy family, aside from Lucius who was currently doing time in Azkaban, since the end of the Battle.</p><p>On top of that, she certainly never imagined to find Draco in the Muggle world.. <em>working </em>like a Muggle, nonetheless.</p><p>Finding that she simply can't keep focus, she snaps the book shut before folding her hands over the text. After draining her glass, she patiently waits for his return.</p><p>An attractive young woman with brunette hair emerges from behind the curtain with big green eyes. She notices Hermione's empty glass and tilts her chin toward her. "Another glass, hon?"</p><p>"Please." Hermione nods her head. "However, I was hoping.. I was hoping to speak with my bartender."</p><p>The brunette nods her head before peeping her head through the curtain. "Draco," she calls. "A customer is asking for you."</p><p>Hermione tucks a piece of hair behind her ear while using a charm to magnify the voices of those around her.</p><p>"Can't you help them?" She hears Draco. "I'm off the clock."</p><p>The female bartender turns on her heels causing Hermione to nervously readjust in her seat.</p><p>"He'll be right out, hon."</p><p>"Thank you."</p><p>Draco walks back into the bar area with a dark grey baseball cap fit snugly over his icy blonde locks. His arms are folded and he looks displeased. "You called?"</p><p>"You're.. <em>here</em>." Hermione's eyes widen. "You completely disappeared.. I thought you were <em>dead</em>.."</p><p>"Yes; I'm here," he replies with a cocked eyebrow and folded arms. "Wasn't aware that I was supposed to keep in touch." He takes the empty glass from Hermione's hand and tosses it in the sink while running the water.</p><p>"Your shift's over, isn't it?" She invitingly pats the vacant barstool on her left.</p><p>Draco's eyebrows suspiciously lower. "Listening in on me, were you?"</p><p>Hermione chooses to forego his statement. "Come; sit. I'll buy you a pint."</p><p>"And why would you wish to do that?" Draco ridicules. "You and I weren't particularly the best of mates in school.."</p><p>"You'd be right." She casually looks around them while flipping her hair over her shoulder. "However, it doesn't appear as though we're in school, does it?"</p><p>The same brunette from earlier emerges from the kitchen and joins Draco side. She traces an arm down his; slowly tracing her fingertips down to his hand.</p><p>"Madison," he greets stiffly. "This is.."</p><p>"Hermione," she says extending an arm. "Draco and I used to go to school together."</p><p>"Oh." The brunettes eyes contemplatively drag between them. "At the University of Manchester?"</p><p>Hermione's eyebrows pinch together. The look on Draco's face tells her that he didn't want her to speak a single word of Hogwarts. And, considering they were surrounded by Muggles, she plays it safe. ".. Right."</p><p>"You go on home, love," Draco dismisses the brunette. "I'll meet you there."</p><p>The woman walks to the coat rack and throws on her jacket. After centering herself once more in front of Draco he grabs onto either side of her arms and plants a quick kiss on the Muggle's cheek. Hermione's eyes momentarily widen, looking down and away while stroking the nape of her neck.</p><p>After pouring himself a pint, Draco walks from behind the bar and takes the seat that was offered prior. Hermione observes his humble backpack and dirtied sneakers. "You look.. different."</p><p>Draco smacks his lips together after taking a cold long sip from his beer glass. "Care to tell me what you're doing here, Granger?"</p><p>"I'm simply treating myself to a glass of wine after work." Hermione straightens in her seat. "And I could ask you the same. Never thought I'd see the day where Draco Malfoy was willingly performing.. manual labor." Her voice lowers as she leans closer. "For <em>Muggles</em>." She can't withhold a snicker as she adds, "<em>Snogging </em>a muggle, nonetheless."</p><p>Draco rolls his eyes while forcefully exhaling. "And just what <em>work </em>are you partaking in, being on this side of town?"</p><p>She shuffles through her purse before handing over a small business card. He observes the ID with her picture; it moves a boomerang affect as Hermione proudly smiles for the camera. The ID reads: <em>Hermione Granger - Improper Use of Magic Officer, Ministry of Magic</em></p><p>Draco wrinkles his chin into a considerate frown. "Very impressive, Granger. But you still haven't answered my question as to why you're <em>here</em>, exactly."</p><p>"It's my first week on the case," Hermione states with pride. "There appears to be the use of underaged magic in a nonmagical territory. At this <em>very</em> bar; Willowcreek. <em>Please </em>tell me you aren't so thick as to use magic openly in the Muggle world.."</p><p>"That's impossible," Draco replies, visibly baffled. "Haven't used magic in years. And besides, do I appear to be <em>underaged</em>, Granger?"</p><p>Hermione's lower lip hangs while leaning in closer. "No magic at all?"</p><p>He shakes his head lazily.</p><p>"Appears we have much to catch up on." She hands back a copy of her ID which has her cellphone number attached to it. "Besides, we'll need a time to set up and discuss; considering you <em>are</em> an employee at the place in question. Let alone a magical witness."</p><p>He glances at her sideways. "As much as it's been lovely seeing your pretty face after all of this time, love.. I'm not interested." He pushes her ID against the bar top and slides it in front of her. "That <em>world</em> no longer concerns me."</p><p>Hermione slowly looks him up and down with contemplative eyes. "It's getting late." Standing to her feet, she scoots back the barstool and puts on her scarf. After grabbing her purse she tilts her upper body toward him with a self-assured smirk on her face. "Same time tomorrow, then?"</p><p>Draco strokes his chin while watching her closely. "I suppose it wouldn't hurt to help out an old comrade."</p><p>"Brilliant." She gives him a wink that transfers the same shameless smile onto his face. "It's a date, then."</p>
