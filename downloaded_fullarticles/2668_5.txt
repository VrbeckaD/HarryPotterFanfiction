    <p>Remus was watching the scene in front of him unfold with a smile on his face. The Order hadn't come together to fight Voldemort in over ten years, and Remus had missed many of the familiar faces. Minerva McGonagall was back, whom he had last seen during his time spent teaching at Hogwarts. And then there was his best friend, Sirius, whom he had believed to be a traitor to his closest friends until he had knocked on his apartment door two nights ago and blown Remus' mistrust away with his charming grin and an incredible yet unbelievable story of what had happened to Harry Potter that night all that time ago.</p><p>Currently, Remus was sitting across from Sirius in the dusty kitchen of 12 Grimmauld Place, his hands wrapped around a hot mug of firewhisky, awaiting for Dumbledore to start this first Order meeting he had called for so urgently. Sirius kept rocking his chair back and forth, throwing him nervous smiles ever to often. In the corner of the kitchen, Molly and Arthur were gesturing fiercely, Molly had put her arms on her hips, seemingly unhappy.</p><p>Dumbledore cleared his throat audibly and the kitchen fell quiet. "I am so happy for you all to be here tonight, and thank you for following my invitation so quickly, I know you must all be terribly busy." His eyes were twinkling above the rim of his glasses. "We have some urgent matters of great significance to discuss this evening but first I would like to express my gratitude to Sirius for offering us his house to set up headquarters here."</p><p>Sirius smiled weakly, and Dumbledore continued: "I know you must all be eager to get started but I believe we are still missing two members, Alastor you already know, and his protégée Nymphadora Tonks why you will all soon have the pleasure to meet." A low murmer spread across the room- new Order members were rare as they were usually hand-picked by Dumbledore himself. Remus was curious to find out who this new witch might be. </p><p>"And I believe Molly has agreed to make us some dinner while we wait for their arrival", Dumbledore said happily, and Molly immediately hurried to fire the stove. Soon the kitchen was filled with fine smells of gravy and roasted vegetables. Remus could feel his stomach grumble. He hadn't had a full meal in Merlin-knew how long. Molly had just began to set the table with some of the dusty goblets taken from the even dustier cupboards of the kitchen, when a loud <em>bang </em>penetrated the kitchen walls from the hallway, and a startled female voice called out "Oh bloody hell, not again." </p><p>Dumbledore and Minerva shared an amused smile across the wooden kitchen table and Remus got up to see what had caused the commotion outside. The moment he stepped out into the hallway, he was almost run over by flash of pink hair, and quickly wrapped his long fingers around the upper arms of a young witch that would have otherwise completely bellyflopped. He helped her straighten herself and was met with a wide grin and a heart-shaped face framed by flamboyant pink curls. </p><p>"Sorry about that", the witch beamed, "it happens a lot, unfortunately. I'm Tonks by the way." She had offered him her right hand but Remus was too perplexed he could only stare at her, taken aback a little by her sudden cheerfulness and her curly pink hair. "Oh, alright-", she said as the smile was wiped from her face. She threw him a slightly disappointed glance before entering the kitchen. </p><p>Moody patted him on the shoulder and grunted: "It does happen a lot, actually." He shook his head in put-on annoyance. "Sometimes I don't even kno' why I took her in at all. Thanks for helpin' her up, Remus." Remus grinned: "It's good to see you too, Alastor." "Hmph", Moody said, "shall we proceed to the kitchen then?"</p><p>The two men returned to take their seats at the long table. Remus noticed that the pink-haired witch was now sitting across from him, involved in an eager conversation with Sirius. Dumbledore cleared his throat a second time and the room fell silent again. "I see that we are now complete. May I introduce you all to our newest Order member, Nymphadora Tonk-" He could barely finish his sentence when she had already interrupted him: "Please don't call me Nymphadora, it's just Tonks." After a beat of silence, she added dryly: "Sorry, professor." Dumbledore only smiled and Remus could hardly suppress a smile of his own. He liked her already. She was so ... <em>bright</em>, and full of colours. </p><p>"Alright, Tonks. As I was saying earlier, we have a lot of important information to discuss. Voldemort has made an unfortunate although not too surprising comeback and I fear that we might currently be the only force standing in his path of destruction. After all", he sighed, "the Ministry still refuses to accept that he is, indeed, back ... in the flesh, so to speak. Right now our priority needs to be protecting Harry so I ask you all to participate in rotating guard duties while I work on a plan that's a little more ... tangible."</p><p>There were a few nods from people at different parts of the table as Sirius looked on, seriously unhappy. The rest of the meeting went smoothly, or as smooth as wartime plans ever could be. While Dumbledore explained the logistics of his plans, Remus found himself frequently glancing over at the witch that had introduced herself as Tonks. She was listening attentively but he could not fail to notice the small looks she was giving Sirius ever so often.</p><p>After Dumbledore had wrapped up the meeting, Molly distributed her pleasantly smelling food, letting small dumplings buzz through the kitchen with her wand, gently dropping them on plates around the table. Chatter broke out up and down the table as Order members caught up on years of life stories. During the entire duration of the dinner, Tonks was involved in a deep conversation with Sirius, only interrupted by the occasional burst of laughter.</p><p>Their looks only crossed once and Remus offered her a quick smile in retribution for his dumbfounded reaction in the corridor, but she merely crinkled her nose and continued her conversation with Sirius. Remus smile fell. Apparently she had taken his staring personally. He would have to remember to apologise to her later.</p><p>After the meal was completed, Order members started excusing themselves to return home to their families or complete pieces of work. Remus stayed behind, hoping to catch Tonks at a more quiet moment to offer his apologies. Finally there were only Tonks, Sirius, and himself left standing in front of the fireplace that Sirius continuously fed with small parchments of paper he was ripping out of an old book. "My family history", he declared, grinning. "It deserves to be fired up."</p><p>"Am I in there too?", Tonks asked curiously.</p><p>"Why would you?" Remus hadn't meant to be rude but somehow the words had come out of his mouth all wrong. She looked at him, clearly taken aback.</p><p>"Oh, Moony", Sirius laughed, "did nobody tell you? Nymphadora and I are distant cousins." Remus had indeed not know that.</p><p>"Hey!", she exclaimed, her hair suddenly shifting from the bright pink to a vibrant dark red, "don't call me Nymphadora, Sirius!"</p><p> Remus couldn't help but stare again. "How-?"</p><p>"Oh", Tonks smiled brightly, "I am a metamorphmagus." Remus was intrigued, to say the least. He had never met a metamorphmagus in person before.</p><p>"I believe Dumbledore mentioned that you are an auror", Remus said carefully, attempting to compensate for his rather unwelcoming attitude earlier.</p><p>"Yeah, I am." She shook her head and her hair transformed back to its original pink colour. Remus watched transfixed.</p><p>"That must be very helpful for your job", Sirius said, and then tapped him on the back. "You can stop staring now, Moony." Remus could feel embarrassment brightening his cheeks. <em>She must be thinking I am a total lunatic because I can't stop staring at her. So much for compensation</em>. </p><p>"It is", she said excitedly, "I never have to use potions or spells to change my appearance, it's saved my ass more than a few times to be honest."</p><p>Remus coughed slightly. "I better be going", he said. "Already?" Sirius seemed stunned. "But you've just arrived and there's so much we need to talk about." </p><p>"Yes, but I believe we will now be seeing a lot of each other, Padfoot. Please excuse me, Sirius, Tonks." Tonks was looking at him narrow-eyed, clearly not impressed.</p><p>As Remus fled the kitchen rather unceremoniously he could only think about why it seemed to matter so much anyway what Tonks thought about him. </p>
