<p>Hermione Granger always checked her work. She knew, from her parents introducing her to chemical interactions at a young age, that volatile components could make for dangerous reactions. So when she decided to devote a month to brewing Polyjuice Potion, a highly regulated potion, she also decided to devote a month to study the potential side effects of the potion itself. This included magical interactions and ingredient interactions. Fortunately, Newt-level courses required the deep thought she devoted to this potion and there were applicable books readily available. The effects of utilizing animal hair, in place of a human hair, was well known. It would result in a complete, if painful, change to the target animal. This use of Polyjuice potion usually resulted in the person changing to collapse from pain, rendering them useless until the effects wore off an hour later. Pain relief potions would be useless, as would pepper-up potions, due to the magical interference created with Polyjuice Potion working beyond its measured scope.</p>
<p>Therefore, when Hermione Granger hid in the second-floor bathroom, covered in fur from head to toe, complete with accessories such as ears and a tail, she knew it wasn't a cat hair that she'd snagged. She'd checked. Three times. There was no way to know if any of the Slytherins had a cat and she wasn't about to make either of her boys pass out in pain. So a simple Identification spell would work, and it did. Three times. No. It was something else that caused her to change in such a manner. And she was at a loss as to what. Her confusion was compounded when, after the boys returned an eternity later, she remained a cat person. They, of course, freaked out. Though that might have been because she was also freaking out. Fortunately, Madam Pomfrey shooed them to bed after she was delivered safely to the hospital wing, with a reassurance that she'd be okay.</p>
<p>Telling Madam Pomfrey that she had successfully brewed a class 1 restricted potion to disastrous consequences was not a problem for her. She'd had the idea to lie and say that they were all switching bodies to experiment early on in the process. They'd hardly be the first students to do such a thing, albeit they were a bit young. No, the medi-witch would need to know all potential potions and magical interactions in order to figure out what was wrong with her. Unfortunately, Madam Pomfrey had no clue, which meant she'd need to consult to figure out how to fix her. Which meant that Hermione was very grateful that it was Holiday Break. A couple of weeks and several diagnostic tests later, they finally figured out what had gone wrong. It wasn't a cat hair, as Hermione had lied to the boys to hide her error in a panic. Her shame of being wrong overwhelmed her decision-making process. No, it wasn't something so simple. Instead, it was her. She was the cat. Or more specifically, a were-cat.</p><hr/>

  <strong>2 September 1996</strong>
</p>
<p>Hermione Granger glanced at the four potions that they would be studying in the first term of NEWT level Potions: Veritiserem, Amortentia, Felix Felicis, and, of all things, Polyjuice Potion. The in-depth studies that they were to write on each of the potions over the next four weeks would include research she had completed in her 2nd year. Yet she was hopeful. Maybe Harry, entranced as he was with the cheat sheet he'd been handed, would miss the implications. Ron, as forgetful and insensitive as he could be, has most likely forgotten about the incident that was burned on her psyche. Her boys, as sweet and thoughtful as they could be, were oftentimes just as dense. Not that she was much better at times. She might learn quickly, but learning to disobey an authority figure and find ways to spend time with Harry so he wasn't so alone during the summer before his birthday had done them both well. In reality, it had done all three of them well. She felt closer to them than ever. She only hoped that her mistake in lying to them four years ago wasn't about to come back to bite her in the ass.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for Hermione, Harry also took something from this summer spending significantly more time with his closest friends. For one, Hermione was much shyer and closed off than he could have thought. When it came to her emotions, she was, at least until this summer, fairly closed off to him and Ron. For two, he'd better get his ass in gear and pay attention to his classes. Five years of scraping by with Hermione as their guide meant that he and Ron would be ill-prepared if something happened to her in this war. And anything could happen. An emotional letter exchange between the three of them where they wrote down their fears for the war they were at the center of had made it painfully obvious that Hermione was scared of anything happening to her for their sake more than her own. She'd even stated that NEWTs weren't even a main concern, something so in contrast with his and Ron's expectations that they'd both been dumbfounded. It was clear that Hermione showed how much she cared not just by sharing her knowledge and breaking the rules for them, but by expecting them to follow the rules that made them safe. Such as not accepting brooms from strangers. Even Ron had apologized for being such a git to her over the years, vowing to do better. Hermione's joking reply of "Don't make promises you can't keep" only made him double down. Harry joked that he wasn't going to promise not to take risks because at least those risks were his choice. Hermione merely wrapped her arms over both of their shoulders and squeezed them close. They'd returned the favor.</p>
<p>Ron's passable potion spoke well to his vow. Normally his first one of the year was his worst as he warmed back into a school environment. Harry's success in winning the Felix Felicis, on the other hand, was a risk he was willing to take. He would decode the whys and hows of the instruction changes later, with Hermione's help he didn't doubt. But wanting to know if the instructions were as reliable as he hoped was worth the risk. As they left the classroom, Hermione looked prepared to tear into him. He knew she knew he'd done something. He'd simply never been much good at Potions, though that certainly could have something to do with his previous teacher. So rather than her blowing up in the hall, he shook his head and grabbed both her and Ron's hand to drag them into a secret hall.</p>
<p>"Yes, Hermione, I took a risk, but I needed to know if this person's instructions would work before we wasted time figuring out the whys of it all. Turns out that whoever took notes in this book was bloody brilliant at Potions."</p>
<p>She crossed her arms. "I don't like the idea of you cheating. What if you get caught?"</p>
<p>"Well, he just won't get caught. Plus, if he does, we'll have done the research to figure out why these modifications work. There would be no way to prove he didn't do the work himself. It would be brilliant! And it'd be good practice for us learning how potions creation works, which could help us fighting V-Voldemort."</p>
<p>Her jaw dropped. "You're both seriously going to put the work into this? To figure out why the modifications work?"</p>
<p>Harry chuckled at her disbelief, pulling her in for a hug and kissing the top of her head. "We told you. We're not going to just rely on you. We want you to live for yourself. Not just for us."</p>
<p>Ron nodded in agreement. "You're far more important to us than just being our precious know-it-all."</p>
<p>She smacked Ron's chest but smiled at him fondly. "<em>Precious</em> know-it-all?"</p>
<p>"I wasn't lying when I said I'd do better. I might as well start by telling you how you're far more precious to me than you are a bloody know-it-all."</p>
<p>Harry rolled his eyes as Hermione snorted back a laugh. "Mate, you're not helping your case here."</p>
<p>Ron's ears started to turn red. "Yes well, I'm bad at this. Spectacularly bad. The point is you're both bloody important to me, okay!"</p>
<p>Hermione glanced between the boys and sighed. "In that case, I might as well come clean. Otherwise, you'll both find out this week regardless. You both remember the Polyjuice Potion incident from Second Year?"</p>
<p>Harry nodded while Ron tried desperately not to snort out a laugh. "Yes. Cat ears and all." She glared as Ron finally burst out laughing.</p>
<p>"Yes well... It wasn't because of cat hair. I... You see the research that we have to do for the Polyjuice potion assignment this week? I did that all in Second Year. Took me a month, but I did it. I knew what the results would be if any of us took hair from an animal. I specifically scanned all of our hairs because animal hair clings to anything and I didn't know if anyone had a cat. Anyways, animal hair in Polyjuice causes severe pain, transformation into the animal but the pain will keep you passed out until you're ready to transform back and by that point, you're going through the pain again to transform back. It takes two hours to recover from an attempt at utilizing animal hair in a Polyjuice potion."</p>
<p>Ron frowned deeply. "But you were in the hospital wing for weeks."</p>
<p>She nodded. "Polyjuice Potion had also been experimented with to reduce lycanthropy before the Wolfsbane potion was invented. In coordination with those experiments, the effects on other shapeshifters such as metamorphmagi or Veela and their part-descendants. Or, less commonly known of, Were-cats." She looked between the boys. "I'm a were-cat."</p>
