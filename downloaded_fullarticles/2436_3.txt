          <div class="userstuff"><p>Hermione was walking down the halls of Hogwarts on her way to Potions, when she a heard male voice holler behind her, "OI, Granger!"</p><p>Hermione refused to look behind her and continued walking, trying to ignore yet another bully.</p><p>"If you put on some makeup once in a while, maybe you'd be a good shag! How about you meet me in my dorm room tonight and I could show you a thing or two?" the boy said.</p><p>In a flash, Hermione was on the other said of the hall, pressing this puny excuse of a man against the wall, the tip of her wand under his chin. She assumed his face was smug earlier, but now it was drenched in sweat and fear.</p><p>With her face barely an inch away from his, she growled in a low voice, "If you say something like that to me again, I'll chop off your bollocks and feed them to my cat." As if the exchange didn't happen at all, she parted away from him, brushed off her robes, and walked down the hall with a pleased smile.</p></div>
