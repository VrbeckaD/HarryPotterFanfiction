    <p>Draco sipped his pumpkin juice. He wondered what the Malfoy Manor would be empty. Probably not much different. It was already too big for the family. ‘Family’. Draco had never found comfort is the endless space. For once, it might be nice to cram into a tiny apartment and actually have human contact with his parents. Then again, there was a reason Draco had a room all the way across the Manor from his father. His father wasn’t a problem anymore. </p><p>	The blonde was just about to reach for another pumpkin juice when a figure bumped into him.</p><p>	“Watch where you’re going,” Draco mumbled half-heartedly. </p><p>	“Sorry.” Draco froze. </p><p>	“Potter?” he asked, but the raven haired boy was already exiting the great hall. Where was he going so early? Draco shook the thought. He was turning back to the juice when a pack of wizards emerged from the doorway, wands out. Shit.</p><p>	Draco was already on his feet running. One of them called out at him. He kept going. Spells bounced past the Slytherine as he dove into an empty corridor. He dashed around the corner. Potter looked up at him with curious eyes. Draco didn’t have time to avoid him. He shrunk and transformed  into his cat animagus, having prepared for them to convict him guilty all year. He bound past Potter.</p><p>	“Dra-Malfoy, wait!” WTF was Potter doing?! The Auras cut him off, throwing spells. Draco closed his eyes and braced. Nothing happened. He peaked his eyes open slowly. Harry fucking Potter was standing in front of him, a sheilding charm cast around the both of them. “Stop!” </p><p> </p><p>	The Auras were going to cut Draco off any minute. Harry shouted at him to wait, but the cat paid no attention. That git. Harry jumped to protect him. Instinct cast a wandless shield over them. </p><p>	“Stop!” The spells cease. </p><p>	“Mr. Potter!” the Aura called.</p><p>	“Please leave my cat alone. I don’t know what grounds you have trying to kill my pets, but I’d like it to stop,” Harry told them. </p><p>        “That cat in Draco Malfoy,” the front Aura informed Harry, voice wavering. Harry raised an eyebrow. He kneeled in front of the cat.</p><p>        “You’re a good Fluffy aren’t you,” he cooed, scratching behind Draco’s ears. He could see the cat restraining a growl. Harry could almost feel the scowl. “Draco Malfoy would never allow himself to be my cat,” he said with a laugh. “I suggest you check the quidditch post. Knowing Malfoy, he’d hide something there over the Slytherine dorms.”</p><p>         The front Aura stuttered an apology and hurried away in search of Draco.</p><p> </p><p>	Harry sat next to Ginny on the train, Ron and Hermione across from them. Draco couldn’t seem to decide who he hated most: muggle loving Ron and Ginny, muggle born Hermione, or his enemies, Harry Potter. He ended up jumping on the luggage rack, hissing at them non stop. </p><p>	“Bloody hell, Harry! Are you sure you should keep that cat?” Ron asked. Draco shot him a terrifying glare. </p><p>	“Yeah, I just got him. I-I’m sure he’ll warm up to everyone.”</p><p>	“Why did you get a cat right before leaving Hogwarts?” Hermione asked suspiciously. Harry gave her an ernest look.</p><p>	“It’s a therapy cat McGonagall recommended,” he told her. </p><p>	“Mmhmm,” Hermione responded, clearly not convinced.</p><p>	“I wish you’d told me we were getting a cat,” Ginny said. She linked hands with him. Harry looked over at her, surprised. Oh right, he hadn’t told her yet.</p><p>	“Oh, Ginny, erm, I don’t think I’ll be going back to the Burrow yet.” </p><p>	“Why not?” </p><p>	“It’s been awhile since it burned down. I guess I’m just nervous to see it rebuild. I had a lot of good memories there.” Ginny nodded sympathetically.</p><p>	“You’ll owl, won’t you?” she asked.<br/>	“Yes, of course,” Harry told her with a forced smile. Hermione hadn’t stopped studying his expression. </p><p>	“I think I’ll come with you, Harry.” Shoot. That girl would question him senseless. Harry knew the witch wanted Draco in Azkaban. He feared what she would do to the cat above them.</p><p>	“To see your parents?” he asked. Hermione’s expression fell. A distraction. Good.</p><p>	“I don’t know yet. Maybe. Ron? Are you awake?” Harry grinned at the sleeping ginger.</p><p>	“I’m not sure what you see in him,” Ginny said with a disapproving shake of her head. Hermione smiled.</p><p>	“Me either,” she replied, ruffling Ron’s hair thoughtfully. Harry heard Draco hiss faintly above them. He shot Draco an annoyed look. That was the first time Harry had seen a cat roll it’s eyes. </p><p>	After a silent thirty minutes, Hermione feel asleep with Ron and Ginny was sucked into a book. Harry delicately removed his hand from hers. She glanced up at him. Sweat broke out on Harry’s forehead.</p><p>	“Grabbing luggage,” he whispered feverishly. The excuse returned Ginny to her content state. Harry stood and fumbled through his trunk, pretending to be looking for something. Draco backed away from him with a low growl. </p><p>	Harry snatched up a book Hermione had been pestering him to read for several months now and began reading, sitting several inches from Ginny. He could tell she noticed. Harry put a reassuring hand on her shoulder, before resigning to the book. </p><p>	After another half hour, a certain white cat jumped down and began clawing at the door. Harry leapt up quickly. </p><p>	“I bet he needs some fresh air. I’ll be back soon.” Ginny nodded. </p><p>	Harry opened the sliding door with a wave of his wand. He followed the cat down a few isles to the bathroom. Harry opened the door. Inside, he waited for Draco to transform.</p><p>	“Aren’t you going to go into human form?” he asked impatiently. The cat meowed at him. “What?” It came forward and swiped his pants leg. Clothes. Right. “Oh, sorry, erm do you want me to turn around?” The cat growled. “Fine. I’ll be back in a minute.” </p><p>	Harry locked the door and went back to his booth. Ginny was rather confused when he pulled a set of robes out of his trunk and left before she could ask.</p><p>	“Here,” Harry said, turning around to let the blonde change. A minute or so later a familiar voice spoke.</p><p>	“How thick are you?!”</p><p>	“Thick enough to save your arse,” Harry replied. He turned. Draco looked surprisingly good in Gryffindor robes.</p><p>	“I need to get out of here,” Draco murmured.</p><p>	“Good luck with that. The first place anyone would look is your parents manor and friend’s houses.”</p><p>	“You think I don’t know that?!”</p><p>	“You could go into a muggle family as a cat, but erm, they kind of cut a male cat’s balls off.”</p><p>	“WHAT?! IS THAT SOME CULT SACRIFICE?!” </p><p>	“No, just a general thing.”</p><p>	“I don’t believe you.” Harry laughed.</p><p>	“I’d like to watch you find out who’s right. Anyway, I would recommend you to a witch or wizard, but I can’t imagine any of them are safe. They’d turn you in.” Draco stopped, hunched over the sink.</p><p>	“Why didn’t you?”</p><p>	“I was deprived of a pet as a child after I talked to a snake at the zoo,” Harry said humorously. The sentence reminded him of his first year at Hogwarts. Dumbledore had told him he saw himself holding wool socks in the mirror. Harry had thought Dumbledore hadn’t been completely honest. It was a personal question, though.</p><p>	“Very funny.”</p><p>	“Draco, I’m going to regret this,” Harry started. He groaned.</p><p>	“What?”</p><p>	“Nevermind. I’m sure you’ll find something, if not, you can go to Azkaban.” Harry turned to leave.</p><p>	“Potter, wait.” Draco grasped Harry’s wrist. “What were you going to offer?”</p><p>	“Living with me wouldn’t be appealing to you,” Harry said with a slight smile.</p><p>	“It’s better than going to Azkaban.” The rawness in Draco’s voice startled Harry. He faced the blonde, reaching over and gripping Draco’s lean shoulders.</p><p>	“Draco, you don’t have a lot of options here, but if you need to, you can stay with me.” Draco nodded faintly. “Now give me my robes before Ginny gets on my back.” Harry turned to let Draco change.</p><p>	“You don’t seem too fond of her,” he commented.</p><p>	“Shut up, Malfoy.”</p><p>	“Now, that’s no way to treat your roomie.”</p><p>	“Merlin, what have I gotten us into?” Harry asked.</p><p> </p><p>	Draco jumped down from the luggage rack after Potter. Harry gave Ginny a quick kiss and Ron a hug before exiting the compartment. Draco followed. Bodies trampled around him. The cat found himself jumping over what seemed to be hundreds of feet coming from every direction. He rammed into one. Draco looked up to see who he hit. Harry was looking down at him with an amused expression.</p><p>	“Want a ride?” Draco looked around. It appeared he had little choice. Harry leaned down to scoop the white cat up. Draco jumped away. “It’s that or go on my shoulder.” Draco meowed. It was humiliating.</p><p>	“Hurry up, Harry!” Hermione’s voice called. </p><p>	“One minute!” Harry turned to Draco, “C’mon!” Harry kneeled down and Draco leaped on his shoulder, sinking his claws into the fabric and probably Harry’s skin as well. Judging by the sound that came out of Potter’s mouth, they did. As soon as they left the train station, Harry tried to shake Draco off, but he only gripped him tighter.</p><p>	“Are you sure that’s a therapy cat?” Hermione asked.</p><p>	“Yeah, he’s just a little on edge at first,” Harry said through gritted teeth.</p><p>	“Okay. Harry, I need to talk to you about something.”</p><p>	“Yeah?” Harry asked. Draco looked closer at the girl. </p><p>	“Well, I couldn’t help but wonder, when you were with Cedric fourth year, did you two do anything?” </p><p>	“Erm, we won the Triwizard Tournament.”</p><p>	“Not that. I mean, were you two in any kind of relationship?” Draco nearly jumped in surprise. Harry tensed hard enough to force Draco’s claws out. He fell to the ground, twisting just in time to land on his feet. Hermione barely glanced his way. Harry stopped and turned to her.</p><p>	“No we weren’t. I don’t know why you would ask that.” Draco had never seen Harry so closed off. Granger wasn’t picking up on it.</p><p>	“It’s just, you two seemed close and exchanged a few glances, and Cedric was gay. From what I know, you never really liked a girl.”</p><p>	“I’m dating Ginny Weasley.” </p><p>	“Barely. You avoid her any time you aren’t pretending you don’t love-” Panic spread across Potter’s face and faster than Draco could register, he cast a muffling spell over him and Granger.</p><p>	Shit. Was Potter gay? Draco stood simply staring at the raven haired boy. There was a muffled argument in the bubble, but the cat had more to think about. Potter was more interesting than he had given him credit.</p><p>	After a few minutes, Ganger stormed off and around the corner, face red.</p><p>	“Hermione,” Harry started, but he never finished. Granger leaned back around the bend.</p><p>	“Yes?” She asked, voice shrill with sobs threatening her tone.</p><p>	“I am,” Harry said quietly. </p><p>	“Oh, Harry.” Granger was crying now. She ran over and hugged him. “There’s nothing wrong with being gay, Harry, but you can’t lead Ginny on.”</p><p>	“I’m pretty sure she already knows,” Harry said.</p><p>	“Yes, but she needs to hear it from you.”</p><p>	“Okay,” Harry said softly. He sounded so vulnerable. It struck Draco. All those times he had fought the raven haired boy, he never imagined Harry to be… delicate. Or even all that human. </p><p>	“I have to go now. I love you, don’t get hurt.” Granger gave Harry a peck on the cheek before whirling around and leaving Draco with the Gryffindor.</p><p>	Harry turned to Draco. His green eyes were glossy.</p><p>	“We don’t ever speak of this. I am not gay.” Draco couldn’t help but notice Harry’s voice crack. Was that entirely true? Still, Draco nodded.</p><p> </p><p>	Harry twisted the key and a bright white door swung open. Draco rushed past him inside the apartment. Harry laughed to himself at the Slytherin’s curiosity.  Light streamed through many windows in the modern space. The entryway held a coat rack. Beyond it was a kitchen and sitting room. Stairs levitated attached to the wall leading upstairs where a bedroom, bathroom, and office lay. </p><p>     Harry tossed robes on Draco. He waited for the blonde to change on a bar stool.</p><p>     “This place is nice,” Draco commented. Harry smiled at the compliment.</p><p>     “It’s not as big as the Manor.”</p><p>     “That’s what makes it nice. You can breathe in here.” Draco’s eyes groomed the space. Harry noticed the blonde’s skin glow milky in the light. “So, what needs to be unpacked?” Harry gestured to his trunk in the entryway. “That’s it?!”</p><p>     “I don’t own much,” Harry replied with a shrug.</p><p>      “What’s even in there?”</p><p>      “Clothes, spell books, a few possessions. The apartment comes with furniture.”</p><p>      “Merlin, I expected at least twenty boxes. I’ll go get food,” Draco said, heading for the door. Harry jumped is his way.</p><p>       “You can’t go out there wanted, Draco,” he told the blonde.</p><p>       “God fine. Kneel down.” </p><p>       “Erm, what?”</p><p>       “I need to get on your shoulder, Chosen One.”</p><p>       Harry rolled his eyes and bent down for Draco. The blonde transformed into a cat with little difficulty and hopped onto the Gryffindor’s shoulder. Harry could tell Draco was trying not to claw him to hard, nevertheless, it was still painful. He pulled out his wand and forged a pass for a therapy animal before walking out of the house to his bike. He could feel Draco tense on his shoulder. There was a meow in his ear.</p><p>        “It’s a bike. Don’t worry, I was taught to ride one before I turned five.” This didn’t seem to reassure the creamy cat. Harry straddled the bike. The cat nearly fell off his shoulder. “Sorry,” Harry murmured.</p><p>	The two biked down to a small grocery store a few blocks down. Draco had wrapped himself around Harry as far as he could go. Harry laughed at him.</p><p>	“Scaredy cat,” he said. Draco swiped at him.</p>
