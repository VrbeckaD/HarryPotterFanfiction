    <p>A young man dragged a hand through his hair, enjoying the burn of the sun. His earlier white, now light yellow shirt snapped in the wind, and he popped open another button.</p><p>"We're wait'n for yer orders Cap'n!", one of the older members of the crew shouted, turning towards the man with a wicked look in his eyes.</p><p>"Aye, I know.", he answered resting his hand on the hilt of his sword. He heard the shouting from the pirates behind him and a pleased smirk spread across his lips. With his raven black hair whipping in the wind, he swirled around.</p><p>"Prepare the cannons, get ready to board." The captain grabbed the wheel, and grinned to his first mate. "And hoist them colors!"</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p><strong>A few days earlier</strong>:</p><p>A young woman stood on the balcony of her fathers house. She sighed heavily. With her hair flowing in the wind, she looked towards the stables. What she had not given for a ride now.</p><p>"Miss Lily? M- miss?" She turned her head towards her maid. The young girl looked concerned as she fidgeted with the sleeve of her pink dress.</p><p>"Yes Winky?" Lily looked curiously at her maid as she turned away from the setting sun. Winky glanced up at Lily, then back down to the floor.</p><p>"Your father and grandfather wants to talk to you," she muttered quietly.</p><p>One of Lily's eyebrows lifted and she squared her shoulders. "And why is that?"</p><p>"They did not tell me, I'm afraid." Winky looked at the ground, but Lily only shook her head.</p><p>"That's alright, Winky." Lily took in the large house in front of her and wondered what horrifying surprise her parents possibly could have waiting for her on the other side.</p><p>Winky lifted her large brown eyes to look at her Lady and said carefully, "Miss, if it is not my place to say; do tell, but I saw a man with them. He looked quite rich."</p><p>Lily frowned and found herself straightening without thinking about it. <em>A man she said</em>? Then, she turned her head towards Winky and smiled.</p><p>"Thank you. Where do they await me?"</p><p>"In the dining room miss, it's down the hall a- " Lily nodded to stop her sentence.</p><p>"I know my way around the house, Winky. You're dismissed." The maid curtsied and walked away.</p><p>Lily drew a large breath before walking down the hall, towards the three men. She knew this could bear nothing but bad news for her, but she forced herself to swallow the fear. An Evans never showed her emotions.</p><p>The dining room was large and white, the columns on each side decorated with gold, but Lily did not stop for a second to admire the beautifully done handwork. Three men were arguing in front of her. Before Lily could listen in on the conversation, the shouting promptly stopped, and her father gave her a warning look.</p><p>"Mr. Malfoy." He said to a man with long, white-washed blonde hair.</p><p>"I want you to meet my daughter; Lily Evans." The man took a few steps towards Lily and kissed her hand slowly.</p><p>"You're more beautiful than I could have imagined." Lily nodded politely, and carefully pulled her hand from his grip. She didn't know him, but he was clearly a man with connections. Like many of the men in her life, she had to be careful when she was around him. Her father cleaned his throat loudly, and Malfoy turned, slightly miffed, to look at him.</p><p>"Lily, your mother and I have decided that this man will become your..." he trailed off, hesitating before he uttered the word, but Lily knew what was coming. "...husband.", her father said, sounding defeated.</p><p>Lily tried to hide her rage, but a look crossed her face before she could catch it. How could they? How could they bind her to a man she had never spoken to? She didn't know if he was kind or cruel, at least if they chose the commodore, she would know he was an honest man.</p><p>Lily took a deep breath and nodded. Her parents would not have done this if they did not have to. Lily knew very well that if she uttered a word about her opposition in front of this man, her -now- fiancé; she would be punished hard. She did not say a word. She would say a lot after Malfoy was gone, but for now; she let him push the ring on her finger and talk shamelessly to her. As he said his goodbyes, he kissed her cheek, and Lily had to keep herself from retching in disgust.</p><p>"Someday soon, love; you are going to end up in my bed." He whispered to her. Lily closed her eyes to hide the tears of frustration. "I am looking forward to our next meeting, Miss Evans. You will not have any qualms of this marriage when I am done with you." His whispers were louder now, and Lily tried not to snap at him. </p><p>She failed.</p><p>Lily slapped him as hard as she could, and felt his sideburns scratch against her palm.</p><p>Without any remorse Lily ran to the stables. She shouted at the stable boy who quickly fastened the seat on Moonlight. As Lily galloped away from the estate, she could hear her mother screeching after her. But the young Lady had to get away. Away from her life. She knew that she would have to return, but for now; she would like to forget.</p>
<hr/><p>"Do you even know what troubles you could have made?!"</p><p>Vivida Colarenta Evans talked fast and the air was filled with tension. She was mad. Mad at her daughter; with her father's red hair and therefore also his read-hair temper.</p><p>"Of course I know mother!" Lily's green eyes struck lightning. Those eyes could scare even the bravest of men, but Vivida Colarenta was not a man. </p><p>"His words were shameful and I don't regret a single action." Vivida fumed in front of her daughter, but calmed herself so her words were low and completely in control.</p><p>"You shall thank the Lord that Mister Malfoy is a humble man, and forgave you." Lily laughed loud at her mothers words.</p><p>"Humble? My arse!" She scoffed and missed Vivida's eyes widening.</p><p>"Language!" She shrieked at her daughter, face reddening, but Lily ignored her. She turned her back to her mother and stabbed her dagger into her bedside table. It already had many marks from the same knife.</p><p>"The man probably said something like; <em>Oh she's just a wench! I'll get her to bed, you mark my words</em>!" Vivida did not answer Lily's statement, and so the redhead knew she was right. She stood up and pointed at her mother with the glinting knife in her hand.</p><p>"How could you bind me to such a cruel man?!" Vivida had no mercy left now, she stared at her daughter with no love in her eyes.</p><p>"You shall trust your parent's decisions!"</p><p>Lily was about to interrupt again, but Vivida silenced her with a harsh slap in the face. Lily clapped her hands to her cheek and looked at her mother with wide eyes. Vivida clenched her jaw.</p><p>"Why can you not be more like Petunia?! She was married willingly to Dursley and is now bearing his child!"</p><p>"I am <em>not</em> Petunia!" The dagger hit the door with a thud and Vivida rolled her eyes.</p><p>"Yes I can see that.", she said, loathing lazing every word, "When she was playing with dolls; you went talking to that stable boy! You have <em>never</em> been one of us."</p><p>Lily smiled bitterly. "And thank God for that."</p><p>Vivida blinked, ignored the comment and finished what she had come to say.</p><p>"Tomorrow, you will board Malfoy's ship, and sail to his land. The maids have already packed your bags."</p><p>Vivida walked out of the room, closed the door and flinched as she heard another dagger hit the wood behind her.</p><p>She had never understood Lily, the girl had always stayed with ether the horses or begged her father to teach her everything on his ships. It was almost as if she were a boy! Now that she got a husband who could buy her everything she wanted; was she not pleased? Vivida herself, had never disobeyed her parents orders, so why should Lily?</p>
