    <p>Chapter 1</p>
<p>Polaris. England's best and brightest private security firm. A daunting and awe-inspiring sight. With black marble flooring in the lobby, stainless steel and just the right tint to the glass, the whole building was a tribute to the power and hard work of its founder. A bear-sized black dog was carved out of onyx in the middle of the lobby, the symbol of the company. A cheerful ding broke the almost reverent silence of the atrium, bronze elevator doors sliding open. Chatter busily filled the room as a breathtaking, aristocratically handsome man in a impeccably tailored black three-piece Burberry suit and platinum Rolex stepped out, black hair short but impeccable, grey eyes sharp as he scanned the lobby. Respectful nods greeted his progress through the lobby, the man not stopping as he strode to the doors. "Sir!" A pretty brunette woman held up her hand from reception. "Your three o'clock for tomorrow cancelled, so we moved the American HS meeting to then, and we cleared your schedule for tonight."<br/>"Thank you, Ms MacDonald" he replied, turning and giving her a slight smile - and making half the women in the room swoon. He walked over, hands finding his overcoat pockets. "Take the evening off, Mary. You've worked hard enough for one day."<br/>"Thank you, Sir" Mary murmured, looking down quickly. "There's been a reporter around asking questions, nobody said anything, and be careful driving out there, it's getting a little crisp."<br/>"I drove a Humvee in Helmand Province, Mary, I can handle a little ice" he said calmly, his eyes showing his understanding. You couldn't work in private security without a few secret codes. The woman he assumed was the journalist (a blonde in a charcoal skirt suit) stepped in front of him as he walked towards the doors.<br/>"Major Black?" His handsome face turned impassive at the slight Welsh accent.<br/>"Not anymore" he said bluntly, mentally counting how many security guards he was going to have to fire. "And you are?"<br/>"Raven Lovegood, investigative journalist for the Quibbler blog."<br/>"Good for you" Black smirked, the expression very useful in irritating anyone he didn't want to be stuck with. "Now, if you will excuse me, I'm late for dinner with an insanely beautiful woman, and I've already used up my apology quota for the month."<br/>"It's about Afghanistan" the blonde journalist interrupted, blue eyes glittering with triumph.<br/>"In that case, I really don't have time" Black glared, a chink in his composure that he would later regret. "Good day." He stepped around her, making it less than a foot from the doors before she pulled out her Ace.<br/>"So, the names James Potter, Remus Lupin, and Peter Pettigrew mean nothing to you?" The names echoed around the pin-drop silent lobby with the reverberation of a hundred IEDs. He paused in his stride just long enough that the journalist could see her words had hit their mark, then hurried to the waiting black Aston Martin in front of his building. Five years; it had been five years since he'd last heard those names together. Five years and not a day went by that he didn't miss them and live with the regret. If only things had been different. If only he had seen. They were supposed to be the best of the best, Special Projects and Mobility, they were trained to do and see and know what nobody else could, but he never saw that coming. And it was his fault.</p>
<p>Camp Bastion, Helmand Province, Afghanistan, 2009</p>
<p>Sand flew up from the wheels of a Humvee transport, creating a massive cloud as the tan vehicle slammed to a sudden stop, Dire Straits' Brothers In Arms playing from their field radio. The only occupants of the transport were four men in desert combat fatigues bearing the carefully hidden insignia of the Special Air Service. The driver grinned widely, removing his helmet to reveal a head full of messy jet black hair. He wore the rank of Captain, and the bold name of Potter was printed on his fatigues. His front seat passenger jumped out agilely, breathtakingly handsome even under the dust and grime of war. He bore lieutenants pips and the seemingly innocuous name of Black. His carefree smile could have rivalled the desert sun for brilliance, mischief glimmering in his grey eyes. "You two are lunatics!" The amusedly annoyed yet professorial voice belonged to a sandy haired second lieutenant with exasperated pale green eyes. His name was Lupin, and there was something of the wolf about the way he grinned. The handsome lieutenant, Black, waved Lupin away with a smirk, the expression turning to a bark of laughter as the final member of the elite team fell out of the Humvee with a splat.<br/>"Excellent balance, Sergeant Pettigrew" Captain Potter rolled his hazel eyes. "You do remember that, as our resident demolitions expert, you actually are carrying explosives upon your person?"<br/>"Don't make Peter piss himself, James" Black drawled in a voice as elegant and aristocratically handsome as he was. "We don't want to have to explain another requisition to Colonel McGonagall." Lupin staggered back, clutching his chest dramatically.<br/>"Can my ears be deceiving me?" he mocked, eyes alive with glee. "Lieutenant Sirius Black, our resident daredevil laughing cavalier Casanova, displaying a self-preservation instinct?"<br/>"No." Sirius scoffed and looked at Lupin as if he were mental. "I would just rather not have Minnie change her mind about our well-deserved leave." The handsome man winked at a female NCO as she walked past. "You ladies might not understand this, but I miss girls. Girls, Remus, the species you turn into a mute fool around." He cast a mock distressed glance at James. "It's bad enough that our intrepid leader is betraying us all by planning to enter the ranks of halfwits in the state of unhappy matrimony."<br/>"Marriage is a wonderful institution" Remus informed the ladies man seriously, Peter gagging to approval from Sirius. They playfully bickered as they crossed the compound to their private barracks, an unspoken tension easing from them as Remus completed a clean bug sweep. James kicked back on his bunk, smirking as Sirius chucked gear in his locker at Remus' continued harping about the joys of marriage.<br/>"You know, Pads" James said to his best mate, Sirius grudgingly looking over at him. "Somewhere out there is the poor woman who is destined to tame your caddish Casanova heart and make you fall wildly in love with her." Peter cackled with laughter, Sirius giving James a look that spoke volumes on his disbelief.<br/>"And on that cold day in hell, Prongs, I'll probably just elope and save myself the teasing from you bastards." James tilted his head in the way that meant 'you will see', and grinned at the sight of their bags packed neatly by the door; they were shipping off home for a glorious month in the morning.</p>
<p>Later that evening, Sirius flipped idly through his latest motorcycle magazine (he had a Triumph back home), and kept a weather eye on the door. James had been summoned to a meeting with Colonel McGonagall and Brigadier Dumbledore some time earlier, and Sirius couldn't shake the unrest he felt. Peter was fixing an explosive device for one of the other units on base, muttering about monkeys as he sorted through wires. Remus, on the other hand, was keeping up with his role as their information analyst, folders of paper (Remus was old-school) open on his bed. Sirius glanced at his clunky army-issue watch, groaned to himself, and tossed his magazine on his bedside cabinet. James never took this long for a standard mission debrief. He slumped back onto his bed, arm thrown over his eyes, a little voice in his head screaming 'Danger, Will Robinson, danger'. A clunk sounded in the room, Sirius immediately identifying the sound as Peter setting his device aside. "Should we get some sleep?" Peter asked eventually, breaking the tense yet comfortable silence.<br/>"Without Prongs?" Sirius levered himself up onto one elbow. "Are you insane, Wormtail?" Peter shrugged sheepishly.<br/>"We have to wake up early to meet the transport home, it makes sense to get an early night." Remus' green eyes met Sirius' grey, the same thought passing through them.<br/>"I don't think we'll be meeting that transport, Pete" Remus said slowly. "James has been gone for three hours. This smells like another mission." The demolitions expert nodded sagely.<br/>"Overt or covert?"<br/>"They only brought James in" Sirius reminded them, running his hand through his impeccable black hair. "They don't want everyone to know. Ergo, they want the Marauders. Covert not overt."<br/>"When did the mutt get so wise?" James asked, smirking in the doorway. Sirius' grey eyes flicked up to James.<br/>"Around about the time I saved your scrawny arse for the ninth time." James threw his arms up into the air.<br/>"You're still going to blame me for Belgrade?"<br/>"Let me think about this" Sirius mocked the famous Thinker statue. "Yes!" James growled in frustration, dropping to the foot of his own bed.<br/>"How was I supposed to know that there was gonna be a ninja with a flamethrower?"<br/>"I don't know, Prongs" Sirius replied smugly. "It's your job to plan for every eventuality." Peter chuckled.<br/>"You did look pretty funny running about with your hair on fire, Padfoot."<br/>"That's Lieutenant Black, Sir, to you, Sergeant Pettigrew" Sirius glared, Peter wilting back into his seat.<br/>"Yes sir, Lieutenant Black, Sir" James gave an awful salute, and ate a mouthful of pillow. "That's assault on a senior officer!"<br/>"No" Sirius corrected with a shit-eating smirk. "That's hitting a berk."<br/>"Ah, I miss Berlin" James sighed nostalgically, messing up his hair in the unconscious way he had. It was his tell, and in this case Sirius knew it meant he was worried about something.<br/>"We're back on active duty?" Sirius' words might have been phrased as a question, but it was a statement through and through. James ruffled his hair further, his other hand adjusting his glasses.<br/>"Only if we want to be" James replied, his Captain tone colouring his words. James was a leader, and he only wanted what was best for his team, his childhood friends. "It's a Joint Strike Op. One more mission, upgraded to two months of leave." Conflict shone in James's hazel eyes. "Two months" he breathed out a laugh. "I could help Lily plan a proper wedding, tack on a honeymoon at the end of our next leave."<br/>"I could finally finish my literature course" Remus added, his love for books legendary.<br/>"We'd be home for Christmas" Peter smiled, obviously thinking of a rare Christmas with his mum - the only family he had left. Only Sirius didn't look thrilled about the extended leave.<br/>"Standard Marauder op?"<br/>"Afraid so" James agreed guiltily. "Pads, say the word and I'll say no. I know how long you've been-" Sirius cut him off with a tired smile.<br/>"So I'll miss this chance and stay in the army a little longer. No big deal." His forced smile said it was anything but. "I'm a bastard, but I'm not that kind of a bastard. Take the mission, I'm stubborn enough to make another chance." A proud if somewhat sad smile blossomed on James's face.<br/>"McGonagall wants us in her office at 0630. Mission parameters and relevant details will be disclosed then. Let's get some sleep. Tomorrow we're back in business."</p>
<p>London, 2017</p>
<p>Sirius shook himself out of his memories, his right hand punching the steering wheel of his ridiculously expensive car. A glimmer of gold caught his eye, reminding him he was late for dinner. He sent a text message (the cowards way out, but he wasn't feeling particularly brave at the moment) to cancel - he wasn't in any fit state to be company tonight. Not anymore. He couldn't go home, and he couldn't go back to work (the parasite could still be there), so there was only one place to go. Sirius drew a deep breath in through his nose, turning in the opposite direction from his mansion on Billionaires Row (sue him, it had the best security in London - and his firm ensured it), and away to a boxing club in Whitechapel.</p>
<p>Identical twins Fabian and Gideon Prewitt had been two of the best field medics and drill sergeants on base back in Afghanistan, but devoted their lives to helping returned vets and messed up kids find their place in the world. Gideon was marginally buffer and a little rougher than his twin brother, usually wearing rock band t-shirts and torn jeans (they'd bonded back in the 'Stan over their mutual hatred of Celestina Warbeck, and their rebellious teen phase of punk). Fabian, on the other hand, was gentle and kind, dressing suitably but professionally. It was Gideon, in a worn leather jacket, that saw him first. "You know that leaving a £200,000 sports car outside is pretty much begging for it to be knicked?" Gideon pushed off the wall, grinning at the younger man. "And, just FYI, walking in here looking like that," he gestured up and down with a hand. "Really doesn't help your image any, mate." His green eyes scanned Sirius quickly. "Also, you look like crap. What brings you to the Order looking like you've just walked out of a photoshoot?" Sirius heaved a sigh, starting to regret coming.<br/>"I don't really want to talk about it, Gid" Sirius said quietly. "I just came here to beat the crap out of something." Fabian slipped around the corner, smiling slightly at the sight of him.<br/>"Sirius!" Fabian shook his hand warmly. "What brings the Polaris magnate to our humble establishment?"<br/>"An Aston Martin DB11, Fab" Sirius drawled, mostly because it was expected of him.<br/>"He says he wants to beat the crap out of something and not talk about what's eating him" Gideon smirked, Sirius mentally putting Gideon at the top of his Beat The Crap Out Of list.<br/>"You have access to any gym and boxing club in the city, Sirius" Fabian said flatly. "If you didn't want to talk, you would've gone to one of them. So" he folded his arms. "What's wrong?" Sirius ignored him, tossed his overcoat, suit jacket and tie away, and rolled up the sleeves of his dress shirt. He didn't even bother wrapping his hands, just started laying into the nearest punching bag.</p>
<p>When the pain reached a familiar discomfort level, he eased back, finding a rhythm that compensated for boxing in a tailored suit and handmade loafers. Gideon moved behind the bag, bracing it and watching Sirius with the same patient eyes as his brother. "I was leaving the office" Sirius began, landing a punch with each word. "Got ambushed by a parasite in my own lobby. Raven Lovegood, from the Quibbler blog. Never heard of her, but I'm running background as we speak."<br/>"What did she want?" Gideon growled, Fabian quietly watching it play out.<br/>"To talk about Afghanistan" Sirius snarled, releasing a vicious combo - he'd been the best at close quarter combat back in the day. That and infiltration.<br/>"What about Afghanistan?" Fabian's quiet voice pierced the anger in Sirius' head.<br/>"Didn't stay to find out. Bitch mentioned Them, asked if their names meant nothing to me." He laughed bitterly. "I was supposed to be having dinner tonight, now I'm not sure if I can even face going home."<br/>"Billionaires Row?" Gideon checked, earning a punch in the face when he didn't move fast enough. "Jesus Christ, Black! Give a bloke some warning."<br/>"You're just getting slow in your old age, Gid."<br/>"Piss off, Fabian" Gideon glared, rubbing his cheek. "I can definitely say that you're not getting soft, Major."<br/>"One tries, Sergeant Major" Sirius doffed an invisible cap, face quickly falling back into inscrutability. The twins shared a look, Gideon clapping Sirius on the shoulder and steering him to the door.<br/>"Follow us back to ours" the younger twin said. "We've still got that whiskey you sent us from your trip to Scotland."<br/>"We'll have a drink and remember the good old days" Fabian continued, the two a comedy double act just like their twin nephews Fred and George Weasley. Sirius didn't have a choice in the matter, especially not after Fabian wrangled the keys to his Aston Martin away from him.<br/>"I don't know why I even bother coming to see you two" Sirius grumbled, ignoring the vibrating of his phone. Fabian glanced at him and smirked.<br/>"Because we're brothers-in-arms. And because you don't want anybody else to know how much of an arsehole you really are."<br/>"Great pep-talk, thanks Fab" Sirius drawled sarcastically. Fabian shrugged unapologetically, pulling up outside an unobtrusive flat.<br/>"Do you want me to say that it's because you still can't work out how Gid and I figured out about your squad's little secret?"<br/>"James would call it our Furry Little Problem" Sirius smiled nostalgically. Gideon let out a roar of laughter.<br/>"God, I'd forgotten that" he shook his brown fringe out of his face. "Half the base was under the impression that your team mascot was a badly behaved rabbit."<br/>"I know" Sirius smirked mischievously. "James and I used to set Remus up with people who tried to give him advice. For an intelligence analyst, he was clueless."<br/>"What do you think Lovegood was after?" Fabian asked suddenly, Sirius giving him a look.<br/>"I was SAS, Fab, trained to resist every interrogation technique in the book - including your wildly transparent attempt." He ran a hand through his hair, feeling a headache coming on. Why could life never be simple? The answer came at him from out of the past; because life would never be fun that way, Pads. Merlin, he missed James. "Honestly" Sirius sighed, feeling older than his years. "I think she was doing research for the planned MoD/Homeland Security training Polaris is expanding into, and stumbled across a couple of redacted files." Fabian paled, horror filling his eyes.<br/>"You piece enough words together on those things-"<br/>"And you get Afghanistan, my team, the Order, and not entirely sanctioned but necessary missions." Sirius pinched the bridge of his nose. "There was a reason our names were never known officially; they were never supposed to be traced back to us."<br/>"And it all started when you should've gone on leave back in '09?" The still unbearably handsome man raised his whiskey glass in a bitter salute.<br/>"You're a perceptive man, Gideon Prewitt."</p>
