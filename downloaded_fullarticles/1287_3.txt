    <p>Lucius was seated on one of the cushy sofas in his home. His wife was seated next to him, resting her head against his chest. His master had given him an order to undermine the Order of Phoenix from within. That usually meant placing a double agent in their midst. But Lucius was smarter than that. Any new members showing up out of the blue was sure to cause undue suspicion. But if he were to turn one of the current members, then.....</p>
<p>Lucius' mouth curled up into a smile as the plan began to form in his head. He nodded towards other members that Master had generously assigned to help him.</p>
<p>"Let's go." was all he said</p>
<p>"Where are we going?" Lestrange asked</p>
<p>"To meet up with an old....acquaintance." Lucius said with a small smirk</p>
<p>They didn't have to travel very long, before they stopped in front of a small household. It was modestly furnished, yet it had an air of cleanliness around it.</p>
<p>Lucius knocked three times, as was his custom. A small boy, who was seventeen years old in spite of his size, opened the door. His eyes widened as he saw Lucius, and he stepped back.</p>
<p>"What are you doing here?" the boy asked, trying to hide his trembling</p>
<p>"We just came by for a chat." Lucius said casually, as if it were every day that he conversed with one of Order's core members</p>
<p>"Get on with it Lucius." Lestrange seemed impatient "We don't have all day."</p>
<p>"Don't mind him." Lucius smiled at the trembling boy "I would like some tea, if you don't mind?"</p>
<p>"Sure." the boy turned and went about preparing the requested beverage</p>
<p>Lucius observed how his hands were trembling, and smirked to himself. He would use this unique opportunity to the fullest.</p>
<p>Once the tea was done, Lucius took a sip, before focusing his attention on his host.</p>
<p>"This tea was delicious." Lucius praised "Thank you."</p>
<p>"What is it you wanted to talk about?" the boy asked</p>
<p>"Oh, that. Well, Wormtail......do you mind if I call you that?" Lucius looked at his young host</p>
<p>"Only my friends call me that." he replied defensively "And my name is Peter Pettigrew."</p>
<p>"Peter it is, then." Lucius said smoothly "And we came to talk about you. You fear us......you've shown that during the short time we've been here. You fear what we would do to you if you stayed. But what if you don't have to?"</p>
<p>"What do you mean?" Peter asked, and Lucius could see something flicker in his eyes</p>
<p>"I am saying that if you become one of us.....become our friend.....you would have nothing to fear from us."</p>
<p>"I...I would....." Peter stammered </p>
<p>"But you're loyal to your friends. An admirable trait indeed." Lucius praised "But do they feel the same way about you? Or are they merely keeping you around to make themselves feel better?"</p>
<p>Peter hesitated, and Lucius was pleased to see that the seeds of doubt he had planted have began to take root.</p>
<p>"We could be your real friends, and we would never abandon you." Lucius continued "We could give you protection you've always wanted. All you need to do in turn is to become our double-agent."</p>
<p>Peter still hesitated.</p>
<p>"We don't expect you to answer us right away." Lucius stood up "Take your time and think about it. If you decide to accept our offer, come to this address."</p>
<p>He quickly wrote an address on a piece of parchment and passed it over to Peter, who took it with trembling hand.</p>
<p>"It's getting late." Lucius observed "We'd best get going."</p>
<p>One by one they stepped out of the house, and were gone, leaving Peter with his own thoughts.</p>
