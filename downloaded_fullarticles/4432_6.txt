    <p>Newt let out a shuddering breath as he stepped out of the café and waited for the cab driver to pick him up.</p><p>Like each time he came to visit New York City, he was greeted by the constant cacophony of honking automobiles, clattering carriages and chattering passers-by. Especially at night the streets seemed to be animated by a burst of sparking energy, as if the city only waited for sundown to remind everyone of its timeless splendor. </p><p>Newt had always been impressed by the sheer diversity this city displayed. There seemed to reign a certain disorder that still managed to be contained by something Newt couldn’t put his finger on; an invisible force that formed a paradoxal symbiosis among its inhabitants, which only added more to the fascination the young man felt towards the city of lights. </p><p>Despite the countless times Newt had visited overpopulated places like New York, he still wasn’t used to being surrounded by myriads of people, and it made him dizzy each time he had to make his way through the moving crowd. Given the fact that he would be staying in the city for quite some time, he knew he had to get acclimated to it, whether he liked it or not. </p><p>At least now there was a great reason for his staying, which he hoped was worthy enough to all his efforts.</p><p>Another sigh escaped the redhead’s lips as he tried to rub his clammy hands dry against the rough wool of his coat. It was in the middle of august, however, the nights were cold and humid and a soft but chilly wind blew between the skyscrapers, leaving a smell of smog, seawater and burned leaves in its wake.</p><p>When the cab finally arrived, Newt stepped in relieved to sit on a warm seat and before he realized, the cab came to a halt at the given address; a small house in a quiet street framed by an alee of yellow birches. As he stepped out and paid the driver, Newt could already hear from the open windows the contagious and booming laughter of Jacob Kowalski, mingling with Queenie’s and Tina’s giggling, longtime friends Newt was more than excited to meet after so many years of separation.</p><p>With a hammering heart, Newt took the stone steps leading him to the door and after a brief hesitation he knocked against the wooden surface. The sound of approaching footsteps followed by a “Coming!” resonated through the hallway, and the face of an incredulous looking Tina appeared before Newt’s eyes as the door was opened and their eyes met. Newt couldn’t help but laugh at her baffled expression and he smiled sheepishly, looking at her from under the frame of his tousled hair.</p><p>“Glad to see you too, Teen,” he said, scratching the back of his head awkwardly.</p><p>“Newt!”</p><p>Tina came out of her stupor and she beamed at him, a big grin spreading over her soft features. Newt had barely time to drop his suitcase when a pair of arms flew around him and squeezed him into a crushing embrace. Newt let out a squeak as he was dragged through the entrance and Tina swayed him from side to side as if they were in the middle of some crazy dance. </p><p>“Newt, oh my God, Newt, I can’t believe you’re here!” Tina sobbed and stepped back, maintaining her grip on his scrawny arms, and her gleaming eyes trailed over his features, studying him intently. “I thought you said you would visit us next year!”</p><p>Newt could feel his ears turning red and he looked at her shoulder, squirming under her scrutiny. </p><p>“Well-- as you can see, there is a change of program, and… I was thinking maybe I should make you a surprise? But perhaps I should have written you a letter, at least--”</p><p>“Newt, this is the best thing that could ever happen to us. You know how much we’ve missed you,” Tina interrupted him and ducked her head to meet his unsteady gaze. “You should tell us what brings you here this early. I can already see Queenie jump on those famous Egyptian bracelets you always use to bring her, she wouldn’t stop asking when you’d come.”</p><p>As if on cue, Jacob and Queenie appeared at the other end of the hallway and both screamed in unison as they recognized the redhead.</p><p>“Newt, my little bird!” Queenie squealed and Newt could literally feel Tina’s eye roll at the uttered nickname. </p><p>He let himself be pulled into her arms and was soon after joined by Jacob whose build was big enough to hug both of them. </p><p>“It has been a while, pal,” Jacob laughed to which Newt responded by tapping a hand on his friend’s back.</p><p>“I’m so glad to meet you all,” he wheezed under the pressure of their embrace and Tina couldn’t help but shake her head in amusement at the sight. </p><p>“Would you both let him breathe already? At least take his suitcase into our guestroom.”</p><p>“Oh!” Queenie clapped her hands and gave Newt one of her dashing smiles. “How about we prepare you a nice dinner? Like a welcome party. Sweetie, you have to show Newt your new creations!”</p><p>Jacob scratched the tip of his moustache self-consciously and huffed when Newt’s curious gaze landed on him. “Ah, well, if you insist, I won’t say no.”</p><p>He smirked which gave Queenie the signal to grab Newt by the hand and lead him through the dimly lit corridor until they stepped into the kitchen. </p><p>“Make yourself comfortable, darling,” she said, going for the dishes while Tina and Jacob took a seat at the round table standing at the center of the room and encouraged him to settle down on a free chair between them. </p><p>“Your favorite chair, remember, pal?” Jacob asked jokingly and Newt had trouble hiding his grin. </p><p>“Of course. It was the broken chair I’ve found in the trash during my last visit.”</p><p>“Newt, always the one finding a practical thing at random places,” Tina stated to which Jacob added, “Surprisingly, it still smells like cinnamon, as if it was standing in my bakery the whole time.”</p><p>“Well, it <em>was</em> in the trash you normally use for the outdated baking products you get rid of,” Newt deadpanned, feeling more at home and relaxed the more the seconds ticked by in the presence of his friends. As they went on going back to old memories and telling stories about what had occurred during the period they had been living apart, Newt felt a pleasant warmness spreading in his chest, something he hadn’t felt in a long time. In the secluded life he used to lead, he nearly had forgotten how good it felt to be with the persons he cared about.</p><p>Newt was startled out of his reverie when Queenie came back, balancing a plate full of assorted pastries on one hand and depositing it ceremonially on the table’s draped surface.</p><p>“For our cinnamon roll,” she sang and Tina sighed. Newt gaped at the plate before him and threw Jacob an incredulous look. </p><p>“You made all of it?”</p><p>“Yes,” Jacob said, puffing his chest proudly under his wife’s fond gaze. “This time I took the chance with Baklava, a Turkish pastry. It’s delicious! And here you have some Apple Strudel. I added a personal touch of course…”</p><p>“His bakery is literally flooded with thousand of clients every day, it’s scary,” Tina murmured in a conspiratorial tone as Jacob kept on rambling, completely oblivious to their amusement.</p><p>Newt gingerly swiped a finger over a pastry covered with chocolate icing and licked it clean, closing his eyes with a hum. He blushed as Tina chuckled and gave him a shove against his shoulder.</p><p>“I’m happy his business runs smoothly,” he whispered back and they smiled at each other, a moment of companionable silence passing between them. It was always like that. A single glance and they immediately understood each other. </p><p>“So…” Newt observed Queenie working by the stove with Jacob who had decided to join her, and then glanced back at Tina, hesitating. “How is it going with Seraphina?” </p><p>Newt regretted saying that the moment Tina’s expression darkened and she started biting on her bottom lip, looking down at her folded hands. </p><p>“Well, uh, we kind of broke up.” She laughed in a high-pitched tone and waved her hand dismissively, blinking rapidly as a traitorous wetness gathered at the corners of her eyes. Newt suddenly noticed how thin she had become since the last time they had met, the healthy rosiness her cheeks used to adorn now replaced by a dreary paleness. </p><p>“It’s nothing new,” she choked. “It was obvious that our relationship wouldn’t last long at this rate.”</p><p>“I-I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to--” Newt stammered, but the brunette shook her head and gave him a trembling smile.</p><p>“It’s okay, Newt. I guess it’s even better that way. I’m not made for this kind of lifestyle anyway.”</p><p>Not knowing how to deal with the admission, he lifted a tentative hand and rubbed her back. He remembered that Tina’s relationship with Seraphina Picquery wasn’t exactly something that someone would call ‘<em>a long, quiet river</em>’. Seraphina was a stubborn woman with an explosive temperament who wasn’t capable of remaining in place for one second, always jumping from one activity to another. By day she worked as a journalist for an independent fashion magazine and by night as a singer and entertainer at a famous pansy club.</p><p>While Tina was more politically engaged and involved in the fight for women’s rights, it was positively surprising that they had managed to maintain their relationship for so long despite their busy life and the judgments they often got from certain people. But soon it became more complicated the moment Seraphina got the opportunity to perform in Chicago with the implication that she wouldn’t come back to New York.</p><p>Tina had mentioned in one of Newt’s letters that she had been tempted to move out with her; however, this decision would mean that Tina would be in the obligation to abandon her work and live a life of an itinerant, constantly moving from city to city. Newt knew that Tina loved her work too much to sacrifice it.</p><p>“She gave me an ultimatum. Typical,” Tina muttered and crossed her arms, leaning back on her seat with a heavy sigh. “She said that if I don’t come with her, it will be over for real… that I should feel ashamed for putting her in such a difficult situation.”</p><p>Newt couldn’t help but frown at what he just heard. “Um, Tina… I’m sorry, but I find it isn’t fair of her for saying that. She’s guilt tripping you.”</p><p>“I don’t know… I’m just confused and tired right now.”</p><p>Before Newt could respond, Tina suddenly leaned forward and took his hands, grinning at him, though he could still recognize the poorly concealed hurt in her eyes, and his heart clenched.</p><p>“But let’s talk about something more cheerful. I want to know what you’ve been up to these days. How’s your art project going?”</p><p>“I’m also curious,” Queenie chimed in, depositing a steaming pot on the table from which emanated a delicious smell that made Newt’s mouth water. </p><p>The redhead cleared his throat, suddenly feeling self-conscious again. “Yes… speaking of—that’s actually one of the reasons why I came here this early. One of my fidèle clients wants to sponsor me by giving me the honor to present an art exhibition at his hotel.” He felt himself blush and stared at his feet when Jacob let out an impressed whistle. “It… it will be my first vernissage. People will see my paintings… Honestly, I don’t know if I should cry or not.”</p><p>“Newt, that’s… that’s awesome!” Jacob beamed, joined by Queenie’s and Tina’s vigorous nods.</p><p>“My little Newt is an adult now,” Queenie teased, earning an exasperated look from her sister. Later, Tina’s eyes focused again on Newt and she squeezed his hands, and it only occurred to him now that they had started to tremble. He didn’t know why it made him so nervous, but the thought of him giving a speech and presenting his work before a mass of people coming from the higher class made him feel giddy and sick to the stomach. He was supposed to be happy, goddamn it.</p><p>He mumbled, “I can’t believe my luck, and I feel really honored. But I’m not sure if I can make it. It all feels so surreal.”</p><p>“You can do this. <em>I’m</em> sure of that. It’s a great opportunity for you to show off your talent. And honestly, it would be a waste if it’d go ignored.”</p><p>“Yes… Maybe you’re right,” Newt conceded and Tina chuckled.</p><p>“I’m always right.”</p><p>“Where will be the exhibition?” Jacob asked.</p><p>“At the <em>hotel Aubépine</em> on Midland Beach.”</p><p>“Whoa, that’s some rich hotel.” Jacob looked impressed and Newt raised his eyebrows.</p><p>“You know about it?”</p><p>The baker snorted, “Of course, everyone knows the <em>hotel Aubépine</em>. Only people with a massive purse go there.”</p><p>“Don’t worry, Newt. It’s just a hotel,” Queenie winked as she saw the younger male’s troubled expression, and added in a playful tone, “I hope though, that you have some invitation cards left for us.”</p><p>Newt sputtered, “As if I’d forget you. I’ll actually feel more at ease knowing that you’ll be with me as soon as it starts.”</p><p>“We’ll encourage you. It’s going to be alright.” Tina ruffled Newt’s unkept hair, making him smile and look up at her gratefully, before staring back down at his hands still engulfed in his friend’s warm grip.</p><p>“Thank you. It means a lot to me…” He chewed on his underlip, then flashed them an apologetic look. “As much as I love staying at your place, I’m sorry to say that my client insists I should reside at the hotel ‘til the day of the exhibition.”</p><p>“No problem, we understand. It’s a nice place, you should take advantage of it and let yourself be pampered,” Queenie laughed while ushering her husband to bring the plates for the dinner. “At least you can stay with us for the night, right, Tina?”</p><p>Her sister nodded, giving Newt a last comforting squeeze before taking his plate to serve him a bit from the prepared meal. </p><p>“Welcome home, Newt.” </p><p>She smiled at him, and for the rest of the night, Newt didn’t waste a thought about the upcoming event that would probably be the beginning of a new turn in his line of work…</p><p>…Or at least he tried to.</p><p>---</p><p>“Mister Scamander! We finally meet!”</p><p>Newt jumped and looked up from his suitcase as a booming voice resonated through the reception hall, belonging to a corpulent man with walrus-moustache who walked straight to him with energetic steps. A soon as the redhead recognized who it was, his hand was suddenly crushed by the grip of a massive hand and the man shook it with so much enthusiasm, he was afraid his arm would dislocate at any moment.</p><p>“Welcome to my humble hotel, Mister Scamander. I’m glad you have finally accepted my invitation. How is your brother Theseus doing? My my, you both look so alike!”</p><p>“I-It’s a pleasure to meet you, Monsieur Binet,” Newt stuttered, completely taken off guard by the owner’s boisterous demeanor. It was one thing to imagine someone with the aid of pictures and letters, and another to meet said person in person. M. Binet was built like a giant wardrobe and his face was as red as a lobster. Though, his imposing appearance was softened by a pair of lively eyes and a smile that somehow put Newt’s skittish state a little bit more at ease. Newt tried to fight the compulsive need to avert his eyes and politely smiled back. </p><p>“It’s a beautiful place,” he added and couldn’t keep the awe from his voice as he looked around and took in the décors of the main entrance. “It reminds me a bit of the Swiss chalets.”</p><p>“Oh, you flatter me so. Indeed, I wanted to add a cozy atmosphere to the interior design. As you can see, I am very fond of mahogany wood, but not in excess mind you,” M. Binet let out a barking laugh that made his moustache tremble comically. “But where are my good manners? Come with me, I’ll show you the room I’ve personally chosen for you. Your brother used to reside there from time to time. Afterwards, if you want, I can show you around. There are many things this hotel has to offer.”</p><p>M. Binet’s chatter went on as he led a bewildered Newt towards the elevator, followed by the baggage handler who had picked up his suitcase and other belongings. Newt’s awe kept growing as they passed many corridors and more details of the impressive décors were revealed. He let his eyes trail over golden moldings adorning the walls, giant windows framed by burgundy colored curtains, revealing a breathtaking view on the sun kissed beach, exotic plants and furniture that must have cost a big fortune, and crystal chandeliers reflecting rainbow patterns on the polished wooden floor.</p><p>Newt’s contemplating was interrupted when M. Binet came to a halt and opened a door on which was engraved with golden, sinuous letters: <em>Room 26</em>. </p><p>“I hope this room is of your liking, Mister Scamander,” he said and encouraged Newt to come in with a theatrical wave of his hand. With a mix of curiosity and apprehension, Newt stepped through the threshold and his heart skipped a beat. </p><p>The room was majestic. He was sure it was twice as big as his whole apartment in London. It was a spacious, yet comfortable looking room with a fire place and an enfilade of windows giving access to a little balcony. A massive bed, that could easily contain at least four persons, stood at the far end of the room, flanked by two nightstands with legs in the form of lion’s paws. The walls were entirely made out of wood with warm shades of brown, which gave Newt the nostalgic impression of the cottage he used to retire to when he needed an isolated place for his painting.</p><p>Like a magnet, his eyes were suddenly drawn to a drawing table standing at the centre of the room. It was high and large with the obvious intention to give the painter free range for his movements and drawing utensils. There it was. Shiny and ready to be used.</p><p>Given by the stunned face Newt made, M. Binet chuckled and clapped a hand on his shoulder.</p><p>“A gift from the house,” he said as if it was nothing, and Newt turned around to shake his hand, ears turning red like tomatoes.</p><p>“Monsieur Binet, I don’t know what to say… You’ve done so much-- how can I ever pay you back?”</p><p>“Now now, please stop. It’s with great pleasure I do this, and God forbid I treat Theseus’ precious brother incorrectly!” </p><p>Newt couldn’t help but flush with embarrassment at the thought of Theseus writing menace letters to his client with the threat to burn the building down if something ever happened to his little brother.</p><p>Before Newt could hide his face in his hands with the wish to disappear, M. Binet waltzed through the room and opened one of the windows, letting the fresh sea-air in. </p><p>“You can do anything you wish. The vernissage will start in ten days and the exposition hall is ready to be inaugurated, so you have plenty of time to relax. And besides…” The owner went back to the door and nodded at Newt with the indication to follow him into the corridor. “This section of the beach is private of course. Only the hotel’s clients are allowed to go there, which means less people. You’ll have the calm environment you artists love so much.”</p><p>With those words, M. Binet shot him a perky smile and led the redhead down the stairs.</p><p>“Now first, let me introduce you to our restaurant. We have some special menus for today.”</p><p>---</p><p>Newt groaned tiredly and fell with a heavy thump on the meticulously made bed.  </p><p>He didn’t expect that a tour around the hotel would be so exhausting. Well, knowing M. Binet’s eagerness to boast about his luxurious property, this shouldn’t surprise him.</p><p>With a pleased sigh Newt couldn’t suppress, he stretched his limbs and buried his face into the soft mattress. He still had trouble to believe this was happening. For the first time in his life his art gained more recognition. And perhaps… this would mean that he’d get more clients who would be eager to take commissions. </p><p>It was not that he wasn’t happy with the nomad life he led, on the contrary. He had enough money to live on his own, surrounded by his paintings. He never had the intention to make a big career and to appeal to as many people as possible, especially to those from the upper, noble class. He liked to live alone, instantly feeling anxious and uncomfortable as soon as he was the centre of attention. </p><p>But there were times where another part of him - a tiny voice that he had learned to ignore over the years - that managed to shyly crawl out of its cocoon whenever he let his guard down. A part that wanted to be heard, to show to everyone the things he had witnessed and put on a canvas, to show how the world was through <em>his</em> eyes. The inner turmoil in the deepest part of his soul that never seemed to calm down, sometimes screaming so loudly, that there were moments Newt was persuaded he was on the verge of insanity.</p><p>“<em>Don’t pull some bloody Van Gogh on me,</em>” his father used to say in an accusing tone during one of Newt’s bad days, when he trembled like a leaf, not knowing why in the living hell he felt so awful and tormented, where even Theseus couldn’t comfort him with his calming presence.</p><p>Newt clenched his hands into fists and pressed his face further against the mattress, feeling the crudely bitten fingernails digging into his skin. Now was not the time to dwell on past wounds. He was supposed to focus on the present moment and enjoy his stay in M. Binet’s hotel. Maybe some fresh air would do him good. He could take a stroll at the beach.</p><p><em>Yes. I should definitely do that</em>, Newt thought to himself in a semblance of self-boost and rolled on his side, blinking slowly through the messy curtain of his fringe. He laid there for a while, taking in the warm breeze coming through the open window, a lazy, soothing atmosphere settling over the room. </p><p>When Newt felt his eyes drooping, sleep threatening to overcome him, he quickly shook his head with a groan and dragged himself out of the bed. Maybe he could first discover the rest of the room and put on something less shabby before going out. With that set in mind, the redhead went to the first door next to him, which he mused surely gave access to the bathroom, and sneaked a peek through the opening. His eyes widened when he saw the sheer size of the bathtub standing proudly in the middle of the bathroom, entirely made of marble and something else which’s price Newt didn’t want to know. </p><p>“Okay,” he whispered in a voice way too high for his liking and closed the door. Next.</p><p>The more Newt discovered his entourage, the more he was convinced M. Binet was just plainly said; completely mad.</p><p>Newt could only sigh when he headed to the dresser and opened it, revealing a wide range of various very expensive looking shirts, jackets, coats, manchettes and shoes. And-- was <em>that</em> a tuxedo? </p><p>He closed the dresser with a decisive shove and grabbed for his suitcase. His clothes would do.</p><p><em>At least I hope…?</em> Newt looked at himself in the two-meter high mirror next to the nightstand and turned on his soles, scrutinizing the shape of his body in the new pair of beige pants with dark-brown suspenders and white, supple linen shirt he had bought at his favorite tailor. He frowned. He found the pants made his legs seem too long, and the shirt was maybe a bit too big for his lanky body. </p><p>He trailed his fingers through the messy fringe falling over his eyes and let out a frustrated sound. Perhaps he needed a new haircut too… The artist let his eyes trail one last time over his reflection and bit his lip subconsciously, shoulders dropping in defeat. He wondered again why Theseus always used to envy him for his freckles. He had way too many of them. They nearly covered his entire face and spread like a net over his shoulders, growing in number every year the more time he spent under the sun.</p><p>He was like a walking paradox. His wrists and collarbones were delicately shaped and his arms long and wiry. But his tanned skin covered with scattered scars, calloused fingers and untamable hair gave away the vagabond and disordered life he led. Something most people wouldn’t call ‘appealing’ in his opinion.</p><p>Newt shook his head at his self-deprecating musings and turned his back to the mirror.</p><p>---</p><p>With an A3 sketchbook and a bunch of charcoal pencils stacked in a bag, Newt walked out of the reception hall and took a few measured steps towards the sunlit beach. It was already six o’clock in the evening but the sun still shed a vivid light on the white sand Newt’s feet stepped on.</p><p>The walkway was animated with elegantly clad men and women strolling past him, laughing and conversing in a carefree manner, while the children ran around with colorful kites drawing loopings in the soft, blowing wind. Screeching seagulls flew their rounds above the heads of the hotel’s guests relaxing on deckchairs that were surrounded by giant parasols casting their shadows on the heated sand. Newt had to admit, it was a beautiful sight despite the general décor that seemed a bit too onerous and tidy for his taste.</p><p>The redhead drew in a deep breath, savoring the salty air and warmth on his exposed forearms, then headed towards one of the free deckchairs standing a bit far apart from the others. He was so engrossed in the pleasant feeling of having a calm spot where he could draw without being disturbed, that he didn’t hear at first the sound of approaching footsteps coming in his direction, followed by a careful “Excuse me?”.</p><p>Still oblivious to what was happening, Newt had barely put his utensils on the table next to the deckchair when he registered someone loudly clearing their throat, and with a tiny yelp he swirled around. His eyes settled on a tall man, dressed in a dark three-piece suit, who looked at him with a stern expression. </p><p>Newt straightened himself with a hammering heart, mumbling an uncertain “Yes?” when the stranger just gazed at him for a few silent seconds.</p><p>“You’ve lost this,” the man finally said, and pulled out a long string to which was attached a little key from his suit-pocket. At first Newt looked puzzled, but then his eyes widened as he recognized the object dangling from the man’s extended hand. </p><p>“Oh-- my key,” he exclaimed, internally berating himself for losing his suitcase’s key again for the countless time. </p><p>“I saw it falling from your bag when you left the reception,” the stranger specified and dropped the key into Newt’s open palm, its fingers closing immediately around the tiny object.</p><p>Newt averted his eyes and gave a nervous laugh while shoving the key inside his pocket, and said, “Thank you... Um, I didn’t mean to take up your time. My apologies.”</p><p>“It’s nothing, really.” </p><p>A warm glint appeared in the stranger’s eyes, giving Newt the courage to look up and let his gaze trail over the man’s sharp features. </p><p>The stranger had black, smooth hair that was slicked back in an elegant fashion, the salt and pepper colored strands on his temples neatly trimmed. He had a handsome, yet serious looking face, a permanent scowl intensifying the hawk-like look in those charcoal eyes. Given his naturally mature and confident appearance, Newt could guess that the man was surely nearing his forties. The way he held himself in his strict three-piece suit - a smooth ebony cane cradled in one loose hand - added an aristocratic touch to the stranger’s overall intimidating aura. </p><p>Newt swallowed and quickly looked back at his feet when he sensed he was staring way too intently at the older man. He heard a low chuckle, a smooth timbre that instantly made goose bumps run along Newt’s arms, startling him, and his eyes snapped back up, meeting the stranger’s curious gaze.</p><p>“Be more careful next time,” the older man drawled, amusement lacing his tone, and he inclined his head slightly. </p><p>Before Newt could say something in response, the stranger turned swiftly on his heel and walked away, clearing his passage between the clutter of occupied deckchairs with slow yet confident steps, his broad back straight like a rod.</p><p>Newt couldn’t help but stare after him as if in trance, his heart still fluttering frantically against his ribcage.</p><p>When he caught himself wondering if that man also happened to be a resident at the <em>hotel Aubépine</em>, he mentally shook himself and turned back to his sketchbook, a sigh escaping his lips. If it only took the appearance of one random - although very good looking - man to put him in this flustered state, then his hermit life truly hadn’t done him any good. </p><p>Scowling at himself, the redhead grabbed one of the charcoal pencils and started to make the first sweeps with a practiced flick of his wrist, his mind purposefully trying to forget a certain pair of dark glinting eyes. With great difficulty, that is.</p><p>---</p><p>During the next day, the weather remained warm and cloudless - the beach attracting much more enthusiasts for a lazy sunbath - and before Newt knew what he was doing, he found himself going back to the same spot like the last evening.</p><p>It was early in the morning, the sound of the waves a steady, calm song for the passerby’s ears. The wind had gained in intensity and whipped Newt’s tousled hair against his eyes, making him blink several times against the stubborn strands.</p><p>He smiled in relief when he found his chair still untouched, and quickly proceeded to settle down on the soft cushions, laying his bag securely next to him on the sand. With a soothed and content feeling warming is chest, Newt leaned back and let his gaze wander over the illuminated sky, catching a few seagulls flying with keen looking eyes above his head.</p><p>His thoughts drifted to the first night he had spent in his hotel room, and he found that he might actually get used to his stay at M. Binet’s property. Queenie was right. He had the luck to enjoy the rich fabric of a king size bed, a room that was twice his apartment’s size and a bathtub made out of marble; so he’d better savor this luxury before it came to an end. </p><p>Newt was slowly starting to doze off under the drowsing heat, when he heard a “Good morning, sir.”, and he came back to himself with a slight jump. Feeling a bit irritated by the disturbance, he blinked up blearily through the curtain of his messy hair and saw a man wearing a crisp apron and holding a folded white napkin around his forearm, looking at him with a polite smile and an expectant look.</p><p>“Pardon me sir, would you like something to drink or to eat?” he asked to which Newt raised his eyebrows, still a bit confused by the whole display. </p><p>“Uh-- I don’t know… Do you have black tea?” </p><p>Newt rubbed the back of his neck. The tea was the first thing that came to his mind, and he couldn’t think of anything better in his tired state. Given the way the waiter nodded affirmatively, it must have been an acceptable choice.</p><p>“Of course, sir. Would you like a fresh pastry to accompany your tea? Today’s menu is ‘<em>raspberry pearl</em>’. It’s chocolate macaroon layered with light chocolate mousse, raspberry crème and sago pearl.”  </p><p>“Alright, I’ll take that,” Newt mumbled, gradually feeling awkward and out of place in this overly polite and artificial-alike setting. Luckily, the waiter seemed to take the cue that Newt hadn’t the intention to add anything else, and he glided away with the painter’s order. </p><p>Now that the prospect to take a nap was blown out of the window, Newt decided to pull the sketchbook out of his bag and flipped a few pages that were already filled with random warm-up doodles.</p><p>With a pencil in one hand he looked up and watched the constant back and forth movement of the sea’s waves. Like many times, he let his mind wander off into imaginary places, his thoughts jumping and mingling together without any restraint. It was only when the waiter returned with the promised tea and pastry, that Newt started to refocus on the present world and frowned at his untouched paper, worrying his lip with a frown.</p><p>Today was once again one of those frustrating days where he hadn’t the fortune to be struck by a spark of inspiration. He knew that this was perfectly normal. It would be a lie to say that there was no artist who hadn’t at least once any clue of what to draw. But still… </p><p>Newt chastised himself internally for his annoyance and turned his attention to the steaming cup of tea that was settled on the table next to him. </p><p>He should just savor the meal, and then maybe draw the waves or something else that caught his eyes without transforming it systematically into a masterpiece. His stay at the hotel was supposed to be an opportunity to relax and just enjoy himself, for god’s sake.</p><p>While he munched on his pastry, Newt absentmindedly reached for the little key tucked inside his pocket and trailed his fingers over the smooth surface, suddenly wondering if a certain dark eyed stranger might show up again at the beach.</p><p>He lingered at his drawing spot for at least three more hours before he stood up with a huff and slowly walked back to the reception hall, barely able to suppress a fleeting sense of disappointment.</p><p>---</p><p>Newt slept for at least eleven hours. </p><p>As soon as he opened his eyes, blaring sunlight greeted him and he quickly pressed his face back into the pillow with a painful grunt. Given by the light’s intensity, there was the high probability that it was midday. Newt briefly wondered since when he was such a heavy sleeper.</p><p><em>Must be the sea air</em>, he thought and groaned.</p><p>It was with much difficulty that he dragged himself into the bathroom for a quick shower, but as soon as the hot stream came into contact with his skin, he immediately felt more invigorated. With a fluffy bathrobe clinging snugly to his body, Newt stepped out and went to open the balcony door. Once outside, he rested his elbows on the railing and watched a few residents strolling on the walkway, some of them heading towards the sea that glittered like a mass of diamonds under the sunrays.</p><p>The redhead crossed his arms and leaned further against the balustrade, taking in the whole scenery. Still feeling quite lazy and tired, he started to play with the idea to order a room service and then snooze for while on the balcony, when his eyes suddenly caught sight of a tall familiar figure walking by the ornate wood-pillars bordering the walkway.<br/>
He was a bit far away, but the artist immediately recognized the slicked back hair and dark attire. Newt’s heart skipped a beat and without noticing he gripped the railing tighter, his breath hitching. </p><p>Like the first time they’d met, the older man strode as if he owned the place even though there was a slight limp to his walk, part of his weight supported by the ebony cane. Newt watched with rapt attention as the stranger moved towards the stone stairs leading to the sea, and descended them, disappearing out of his sight.</p><p>The redhead stood frozen on spot for a few minutes, feeling torn between following the other man and staying in his room left alone with a strange sense of yearning.</p><p>“Oh, for Christ’s sake…”</p><p>Under a sudden impulse, Newt skidded back into the room and hastily put on his pants and the nearest shirt that laid in a disheveled pile on the floor. He automatically grabbed for his sketchbook and shoved it into the bag before coming to a halt before the mirror for a quick hair-check.</p><p>Feeling more or less satisfied with his appearance, he strode out of the room and slammed the door behind him, hurrying with impatient steps to the elevator. As soon as he was outside, he forced his steps to slow down with the silent order to control his frantic heartbeat. The shorter the distance became between him and the sea, the more nervous he became and in a sudden moment of giddiness he asked himself why in the hell he was doing this. He didn’t even know the man. They had seen each other only once, and now he was behaving like an overly enthusiastic admirer.</p><p>A nauseous sense of shame crept up his chest as he arrived at his unoccupied spot and hesitantly settled down on the seat. A lump formed in his throat and his hands began to shake. He quickly clenched them into fists and focused on the seeping pain coming from the nails pressing into his skin. <em>Not again</em>.</p><p>He took deep breaths and closed his eyes, trying to calm his trembling body. Everything was fine. There was nothing to be this agitated about. If he wanted he could just go back.</p><p>When he felt that he had his breathing more under control, he opened his eyes and looked around, anticipation making his stomach flip. He tried not to feel disappointed when all he saw was the waves splashing vigorously against the shore and the other residents relaxing on their deckchairs.</p><p>He was just considering to pick up his things and trail back to the hotel with the feel of disgust towards himself, when a tall silhouette holding a cane appeared at the far end of M. Binet’s property and walked alongside the sea, slowly coming nearer to where Newt was sitting.</p><p>The artist perked up as he recognized the figure, and waited for the older man to stroll past him. As the stranger came to a halt ten meter apart from him and contemplated the waves’ back and forth with an absent look adorning his serious face, Newt couldn’t help but let his gaze wander over the man’s elegant features. Now that he was sure that the stranger hadn’t seen him yet, the redhead gave himself the leisure to observe him freely from his drawing spot.</p><p>He noticed that this time he was wearing something more casual. Instead of the three-piece suit, he was wearing a simple black shirt and a vest that clung at the right places, giving a subtle image of the strong muscles flexing under the soft fabric. The shirt was matched with an equally black pair of pants and pretty expensive looking shoes that were now spoiled by the wet sand. A navy blue scarf was hanging in a relaxed fashion around his neck, a striking detail among the dark clothes. </p><p>His profile reminded Newt of one of the marble statues he had seen at one of his travels around the world. A straight nose, sharp cheekbones and thick eyebrows hovering over cunning eyes, a deep frown making him look as if the waves had just offended him with their presence. Newt felt the urge to walk up to him and softly brush the scowl away with his fingers, wondering how he would look like with a smile spreading over his stern features.</p><p>All of a sudden, Newt became aware of the general atmosphere and décor around that man: A lonely figure standing with a slightly crooked leg but with a proud stance at the shore, foamy waves extending their fingers along the sand, touching the stranger’s shoes with tentative flows. The pink colored sky casting a soft light on the slicked back hair... </p><p>There was something melancholic, yet beautiful and serene about the scene occurring before the artist’s eyes.</p><p>A feeling that Newt couldn’t quite describe unfurled in his chest, making his heart stutter and his cheeks burn in a passionate heat.</p><p>Before he could stop himself, Newt grabbed for his pencil and flipped the sketchbook open, catching a loose page that nearly flipped out into the wind. He pressed it against the book and began to draw the first lines of the stranger’s face, excitement spiking like a kindled fire. He drew in a frenzy he didn’t knew he was capable of having. Internally, the redhead was afraid that from one second to another the magic would scatter like fragile porcelain. </p><p>At least thirty minutes passed by without both men moving from their spot, as if they knew something unexplainable and unearthly was going on. The stranger still standing like a statue at the shore, and the artist sitting discreetly on a secluded deckchair, drawing soft lines that slowly morphed into a beautiful scenery.</p><p>By the time Newt was nearly finished, his wrist started to hurt, signaling him that he had gone a bit overboard with his eagerness. </p><p>After that, everything occurred too fast. As soon as the older man whipped his head around with a suspicious look, suddenly aware that he was watched, a strong wind blew across the beach and tore the paper from Newt’s hands with a sharp pull, blowing it with violent sweeps into the sky. </p><p>Newt’s eyes widened in horror. </p><p>“No, no, no..!” He jumped from his seat and ran after the paper, trying to catch it with flailing hands. Utter mortification crashed over him as he saw with trembling lips how the paper practically flew into the stranger’s hand. </p><p>The older man’s eyes followed attentively the paper making its loopings above his head, and with a sharp gesture he caught it in a tight grip, the wind still blowing violently but incapable of pulling it out of his grasp.</p><p>The man held the drawing in both hands and looked at it, his frown deepening.</p><p>Newt was sure he was on the verge of having a heart attack.</p><p>“Oh, no.”</p><p>---</p>
