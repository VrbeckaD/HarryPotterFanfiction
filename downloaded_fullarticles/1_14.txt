    <p>Percy Weasley knew when to break the rules.</p>
<p>He didn’t like to, because most rules were put in place for a bloody good reason, and also he didn’t like to get in trouble. It was an uncomfortable feeling.</p>
<p>But he was a Weasley. And that meant that if it came down to it, a little rule wasn’t going to slow him for long.</p>
<p>He knew that politics was his future. There were so many things that made him angry, that made him ache to fix them.</p>
<p>He knew how to play the long game. He was a pureblood, which gave him a large advantage, but he was also a Weasley, which meant if he wasn’t careful he would never go far. A lot of his classmates, especially the Slytherins, would become his coworkers and superiors (at first, that is; he had <em>ambitions</em>), so he had to start early. And that meant no mistakes.</p>
<p>“You are an asshole,” Oliver muttered as they made their way back to the Tower. “I can’t decide if I love it or hate it.”</p>
<p>One of the Ravenclaw upper years had called Oliver a derogatory name that made Percy’s clenched fists whiten just to remember it. They had tracked him down and made him eat his words. Literally.</p>
<p>McGonagall had shown up just in time to see Percy round the corner, see the unconscious ‘Claw and smug Oliver, and launch straight into a blistering lecture. When Oliver argued that the sixth year deserved it, Percy had a brilliant rebuttal of violence not being the answer and to let the system <em>do its job</em>. Gryffindor lost ten points and gained fifteen in the next five minutes, and the Ravenclaw was docked thirty and gained two weeks of detention. And Percy got off scot-free.</p>
<p>“You only just realized?” Percy asked, amused. Oliver was a good friend. And an excellent decoy. “You make it very easy.”</p>
<p>“Okay, I definitely hate it. Merlin, I can’t believe we got away with it. How’d you know she was there, anyway?”</p>
<p>“Undetectable proximity charms,” Percy waved away the question. “And I’m her favorite.” It was a privilege he happily abused when the occasion called for it.</p>
<p>“For some reason,” Oliver shook his head. “But hey, teach me that hex you used? It was bloody wicked.”</p>
<p>“You mean the one <em>you </em>used?” Percy raised his eyebrow superciliously. “I’m afraid I don’t understand what you’re implying. <em>I </em>never raised a wand against the fellow.” Oliver sputtered, and he relented. “I’ll show you tonight, after dinner.”</p>
<p>Percy knew when to break the rules: when someone else was there to take the fall. He was a Weasley. He was also a little bit of an asshole.</p>
