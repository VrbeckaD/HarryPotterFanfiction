    <i>Dear Journal,</i>
  </b>
</p><p>
  <b>
    <i>I've been having these weird dreams lately. Well, I suppose that they're more like nightmares. They are always of people from different eras, enjoying their lives until ending in tragedy. But why...why do I keep having them?</i>
  </b>
</p><p>
  <b>
    <i>Wait...what was that?</i>
  </b>
</p><p>-.-.-.-</p><p>I don't believe it.</p><p>This battered child cannot be the same one who has defied our Lord for so long. He's so small and weak now. What was Albus thinking when he left the boy with such filth?</p><p>-.-.-.-</p><p>
  <b>Boy-Who-Lived: MISSING!</b>
</p><p>
  <b>That's right, readers. Harry Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived; is indeed missing. A week ago, there had been an attack on a muggle neighborhood. So, imagine my surprise when I discovered that the neighborhood in question, was where Harry Potter lived. Why did Potter live with muggles, and not a magical relative? Surely there must have been a will, why was it not acted out? I don't know about you, my dear readers, but I smell a rat.</b>
</p><p>
  <b>Stay tuned for more.</b>
</p><p>-.-.-.-</p><p>
  <b>
    <i>I'm dead now, I just know it.</i>
  </b>
</p><p>-.-.-.-</p><p>
  <i>Harry Potter.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>I simply do not understand that boy. He is different from what I remember. Where had that brash child had gone? All I see is a pitiful, timid soul. I wonder what you're up to, Albus?</i>
</p><p>-.-.-.-</p><p>Our Lord has made his intentions clear.</p><p>We are to turn Potter's loyalty to his cause. Perhaps there is something in the boy's history that we can use? I believe there is but one thing that I can say to the brat: Welcome to Hell.</p><p>-.-.-.-</p><p>
  <b>
    <i>Why?</i>
  </b>
</p><p>
  <b>
    <i>After being captured, I thought that I would have been tortured; if not outright killed. However, neither has happened. So far, I've been staying in an empty, if dark, room. I suppose that I should consider myself lucky.</i>
  </b>
</p><p>
  <b>
    <i>But, why am I still alive?</i>
  </b>
</p><p>-.-.-.-</p><p>Interesting.</p><p>It would appear that the Potter's aren't as light as they appear. My Lord will be most pleased with this. Now, the question is, how do we bring it out?</p><p>-.-.-.-</p><p>Lily...<br/>
I'm sorry.</p><p>-.-.-.-</p><p>I have to admit it.</p><p>Despite being such filth, muggles have interesting ideas when it comes to torture methods. Even now, I can hear the boy's sweet screams. Such a delicious sound, his cries...</p><p>-.-.-.-</p><p><b><i>Pain.</i></b><br/>
<b><i>That's all I know now.</i></b></p><p>-.-.-.-</p><p>The Abeo Potion.</p><p>This may be the only way to convert the boy. Unfortunately, some of the ingredients are a little hard to come by. And the brewing process takes even longer.</p><p>-.-.-.-</p><p><b>What's this?</b><br/>
<b>A child...how curious...</b></p><p>-.-.-.-</p><p><b><i>I think...</i></b><br/>
<b><i>I think I understand now why I'm still alive.</i></b></p><p>
  <b>
    <i>Why hasn't anyone come for me?</i>
  </b>
</p><p>-.-.-.-</p><p>At last!</p><p>The Abeo Potion is ready. I'm not even going to ask where our Lord had gotten not only the venom of a Basilisk, but the blood as well. Let's see how Potter reacts to this.</p><p>-.-.-.-</p><p>I don't believe it.</p><p>Potter has taken to the potion rather wonderfully. It is curious that he showed no reaction to the venom.</p><p>I wonder why...?</p><p>-.-.-.-</p><p><b><i>Hot...why am I so hot?</i></b><br/>
<b><i>God, it feels like I'm on fire.</i></b></p><p>
  <b>
    <i>What's happening to me?</i>
  </b>
</p><p>-.-.-.-</p><p>It appears that there is a side effect to the potion, but my Lord is pleased with this, nonetheless. After taking note of Potter's progress, I found what looked like an imprint of scales beginning to form.</p><p>Most interesting.</p><p>-.-.-.-</p><p><b>Soon child...</b><br/>
<b>You will be mine.</b></p><p>-.-.-.-</p><p>I have been given now instructions.</p><p>Potter's memory is to be changed. From what I can assume, a simple memory charm will not suffice. I believe that there is a potion that acts as something similar.</p><p>-.-.-.-</p><p>Damn you, Potter.</p><p>You just had to get sick.</p><p>-.-.-.-</p><p>
  <b>
    <i>How long has it been?</i>
  </b>
</p><p>
  <b>
    <i>Since being trapped, I have lost all sense of time. I fear that I will never be able to escape from this nightmare. Why hasn't anyone come for me? Don't they care...?</i>
  </b>
</p><p>-.-.-.-</p><p>Ah, shit.</p><p>Three of my men just died. My Lord has instructed me to collect several samples, for what reason, I do not know. All I know is that this is a suicide mission. But I must keep this to myself, unless I wish to be killed.</p><p>-.-.-.-</p><p><b>Too bad.</b><br/>
<b>So sad.</b></p><p>-.-.-.-</p><p>
  <b>
    <i>Something's not right.</i>
  </b>
</p><p><b><i>My memory...</i></b><br/>
<b><i>It feels different, somehow</i></b></p><p><b><i>It must be my imagination.</i></b><br/>
<b><i>...right?</i></b></p><p>
  <i></i>
</p><p>-.-.-.-</p><p>I must admit, I'm impressed.</p><p>I didn't think that anyone could survive the process. And yet, Potter has once again proven that the impossible was possible.</p><p>How <i>did</i> he survive?</p><p>-.-.-.-</p><p><i>Harry...</i><br/>
<i>Where are you?</i></p><p>-.-.-.-</p><p>-Insane laughter-</p><p><b><i>Help me...</i></b><br/>
<i>"Who...who are you?"</i></p><p>-.-.-.-</p><p><b>It's almost time.</b><br/>
<b>Will you be ready?</b></p><p>-.-.-.-</p><p>
  <i>Potter is coming along nicely. His transformation and training is nearly complete, and the last of the mind wipe has been finished.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>Your move, Albus.</i>
