    <p>56.</p><p>56 faces that he would never see again.</p><p>While he did not know most of them personally, they were those who had filled the background of his years at Hogwarts. </p><p>A young muggle born girl from Hufflepuff, a year younger than him who had once gone around school back from holidays handing out gingerbread cookies she’d brought back with her. He was pretty sure her name was Robin. He had never met her parents but the first thought that came to mind as he passed by where she lay amongst the others was that he would have to send along a letter, something nice, perhaps he could find a picture of her with the gingerbread, surely someone had to have one. She wasn’t even supposed to be there, but like other members of the D.A. she had snuck back in to fight.</p><p>He passed a young boy, no older than 13 crying with his brother’s boyfriend over a still body. Charlie? Charles? Harry wished he could name each one, wished that the mourning he felt in his heart was alleviated by fond memories, but all he could remember was being jealous of the two boys curled up together in the common room of Gryffindor tower.</p><p>He stopped and hugged both of those mourning, he could not just walk past and not give any recognition.</p><p>This was what made getting to those he knew a long process, though perhaps that was a form of blessing in disguise, no amount of mental preparation could have braced him though.</p><p>The first face he knew for certain was Colin.</p><p>He had watched them carry the boy’s body in from the courtyard, like Robin, Colin had snuck back in, Harry wondered if in the last few moments the boy had regretted that decision, if any of them had. A thought that would haunt Harry for a long time.</p><p>They had chosen to come and fight, but had they been old enough to really register the consequences that could go along with that? Had they understood really the possibility of death?</p><p>Lavender Brown was next.</p><p>They had pulled a blanket over her so as to preserve the memory of her, she had been killed by Fenrir Greyback, who had been rather ruthless to her. Harry paused there to think of something to say for her, she had been Ron’s crazy ex, but she had also been valiant in the battle. </p><p>When nothing came to mind, Harry conjured sprigs of lavender from the greenhouse and placed them on the white sheet.</p><p>Fred, Remus and Tonks were close together, this is where the majority of his friends had come to gather. Numbly Harry hugged each one before he went to sit next to the only other man in his life who had ever felt like a father figure to harry; his other godfather.</p><p>What if things had been different? What if the marauders had known that Pettigrew would betray them? Would he have known Remus and Sirius to be his odd uncles? Would they have been happy instead?</p><p> “You can’t think about what if’s all the time Harry.” The voice of reason spoke from behind him, and he turned to look at the girl with a sigh. </p><p>“’Mione, how is it you always know what is going on in everyone’s heads?” His voice sounded rough even to his own ears and he winced at it a little.</p><p>She considered this as she sat down beside him, the warmth of her arm snaking around his waist was enough to crack him in half. “It’s a lot easier to understand other people’s thoughts than my own sometimes…” </p><p>She held him as he cried for a while, tears streaming down her own face. Eventually, when Harry cleared his eyes and looked around again he noticed Ron had joined them but could not remember when.</p><p>It felt like hours had passed, when in reality it had only been half an hour of sitting there, the tension in the room was heavy and dulled the sounds of mourning. </p><p>Eventually Harry would have to go home, though he wasn’t sure where that even was anymore? </p><p>Harry knew that Privet drive would never be home to him again, if it ever was in the first place, he held no longing to ever return.</p><p>Of course the Weasley’s had offered him a place with them, but he was pretty sure that he wanted to give them space to mourn the death of their son. </p><p>In the end it was 12 Grimmauld Place that called to him, the only place that he had ever felt at home, and perhaps a place where he would have ended up if Sirius had not passed. </p><p>It was there in the house that had once held the Order of the Phoenix that Harry had received an unexpected visitor. On his doorstep stood a woman with light brown hair and a face so like her sister that Harry could only assume she was Andromeda.</p><p>With her was a small baby boy with turquoise hair.</p><p>“Teddy….” His voice broke when he said the babies name.</p><p>“Potter.” The woman’s voice was similar to Narcissa’s but there was a softness in it, a care that he had never heard from her sister.</p><p>She let him take the baby as they retreated into his house, he held Teddy and cooed at him, rocking him back and forth like it was the most natural thing. “So I suppose you’re here to tell me that you’ll be raising him now?” His voice was quiet, nervous, but he needed to know that Teddy would be safe, that his godson would be well looked after.</p><p>“Well… That is sort of what I have come here for…” She started to say as the entered the large kitchen.</p><p>Harry moved to sit with Teddy before hesitating. “Would you like some tea? If you want to take Teddy I could brew us a pot-“</p><p>The woman waved her hand dismissing him immediately. “I can put the pot on myself, you take your time with him, it appears as though you need it.” She moved like she knew what exactly she was doing and it was only then that he remembered that this had once been her home as well. “As you know my sister and nephew turned against the dark lord in the fight.” She stated this as a matter of fact, not pausing long enough for him to confirm or even acknowledge it. “My brother-in-law is going to prison and the ministry is trying to decide just what they wish to do with his son and wife.” She pulled tea bags down from the cupboard and set out two mugs, waiting patiently for the water to boil. “They have asked me to watch over them while they figure it out…. The only problem being that I do not think it is appropriate for them to be around Teddy just yet.” </p><p>Harry’s face twisted a little, Narcissa had saved his life, and he had saved Draco’s, but he wasn’t really sure yet how he felt about either of them. He was certain though that he didn’t want them around his godson until he knew just where they stood. “So you came here to ask me to….?”</p><p>The woman poured the boiling water into the two cups with the bags, taking her time to come up with just the right way to say it. “I think the safest place for Teddy right now is in the care of his godfather.”</p>
