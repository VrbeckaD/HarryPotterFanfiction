    <p>Chapter 1: Patient 394</p>
<p>St. Brutus Asylum was a dreary place, even for a person like him Severus Snape concluded as he looked up at it.</p>
<p>A concrete building that was around four floors high, tall wrought iron gates that stretched around the property, and the tiled roof, a dismal slate color, looked to be falling apart. Overall the building had seen better days.</p>
<p>Snape scowled as he thought back on why he was in front of a muggle asylum in the first place: to find Harry Potter, who has been missing for 12 years.</p>
<p>Walking through the wooden doors, he came upon an elderly lady sitting behind the receptionist desk. Walking up to the startled woman, he scowled at her terrified expression. "My name is Severus Snape, I'm here to see Harry Potter."</p>
<p>As he observed the way the woman's eyes furrowed in confusion, he clarified. "I'm looking for a young child at about thirteen years old with dark brown hair and green eyes."</p>
<p>"Oh, um I have a patient, number 394, that's similar to that, although the name on his file isn't Harry Potter."</p>
<p>"Why is that?"</p>
<p>"Well, this child was brought in when he was around ten, horribly emaciated, we have to keep him hooked up to a machine. He was brought in by a police officer that found him in an alleyway near central London. The young boy doesn't speak so we couldn't find out his name, the nurses just named him Hadrian and for the last name they placed Evans, the police man's name."</p>
<p>Severus Snape was stunned, although he didn't show it clearly bitterness was starting to build up inside of him, alongside trepidation.</p>
<p>"May I see, Hadrian Evans?" He strangled out, the irony that the young boy would end up with a similar, but still a vastly different name.</p>
<p>"Of course, but first what would your relationship to the boy be?" The woman asked as she studied the other, no longer frightened now that the other looked as if he aged in front of her. She could see that there were no similarities to be found between the young man and the patient, plus he provided a different name.</p>
<p> "I was a friend of his mother, Lily Evans. I've been trying to locate him…may I see him for myself just to confirm?"</p>
<p>The woman bit her lower lip, it was against policy to let anyone who has no relation to the patient into the ward, but the pain in the obsidian eyes was enough to convince her. After all, not many visitors came up to her with that much sorrow and determination to see one of these patients.</p>
<p>Getting up she made her way to the gated door and unlocked it allowing the young man in. "Please follow me, Mr. Snape."</p>
<p>The two stopped in front of a door with the number 97 on it. The woman placed in one of the keys and unlocked it for him.</p>
<p>"Hadrian dear, you have a guest." She stated as she let the man into the room before giving them some privacy and closing the door.</p>
<p>Severus Snape could not believe his eyes, as he stared in sadness at the young boy, no child in front of him.</p>
<p>Hooked up to a number of machines, Hadrian Evans just stared at his visitor with one dull emerald eye, the other hidden behind a medical patch. Black, not dark brown as James Potter's hair was, fell in lank locks, pulled into a ponytail at the name of his neck. He was covered by the thin sheets of the bed that did nothing to hide the outline of his body, with bones jutting out. His face was thin and gaunt; deep bruises under his eyes showing a lack of sleep, and his famous lightning bolt scar, which he noted extended down to the edge of his jaw. A complete opposite to the spoiled vision of the boy he imagined.</p>
<p>"Oh, Hadrian." Severus was able to get out as he kneeled by the bed. Lily would have murdered anyone who had caused her child to become like this. Staring into the one eye, he knew then that he couldn't take this information back to the Headmaster, he would do nothing but raise the child like a pig for slaughter.</p>
<p>Taking a deep breath he tried to regain his composure. "My name is Severus Snape, I was a friend of your mother."</p>
<p>Hadrian remained unresponsive, the only sound coming from the methodical beeping of the heart machine and the small breaths he was taking. Severus carefully raised a hand, and slowly threaded it through the others unruly strands. The heart monitor picked up a bit of speed as the child tensed up tightly.</p>
<p>"I'm not going to hurt you, I swear." He whispered soothingly, trying to remain as calm as possible. "I'm here to help you, Hadrian."</p>
<p>Again, the boy didn't show any indication that he heard him. This time his eye lost focus and was just staring down at his bed, turning his head completely away. Severus pressed his lips into a thin line at the behavior he was exhibiting. He stood up at the continued silence, knowing that he wouldn't be getting a response anything soon. Gazing down, his obsidian orbs softened to a degree as he made a silent vow, he would help his friend's son, and help him learn how to live.</p>
<p>"I'll be back Hadrian." He stated with an absolute tone, before turning to the door. He stopped just shy of opening the door as he pulled something he always kept on him out of his pocket. A picture Lily sent when Hadrian had been born, the new mother holding onto her newborn baby with a tired, but exuberant expression. The picture was a muggle one, so it wasn't moving, he didn't want to explain his heritage just yet. Turning back to the young child, who hadn't moved from his position at all, he placed the lone photo into his lap. No response physically, but the heart monitor was beginning to beat faster.  "See you soon Hadrian."</p>
<p>Severus swept out of the room with a determined light in his eyes; he had some people he needed to talk with.</p>
