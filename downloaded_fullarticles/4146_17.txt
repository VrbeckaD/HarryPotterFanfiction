          <div class="userstuff"><p>Lily walked into her kitchen, baby on her hip, wearing her husband's best friend's leather jacket. Unbeknownst to her though, that guy was sitting at her table. She ignored him the best she could and decided to make some tea. </p><p>"LILY POTTER!" she jumped slightly to look at him. Sirius continued. "STOP STEALING MY LEATHER JACKET!"</p><p>She rolled her eyes and settled Harry more comfortably in her arms to nurse him. And she did this without breaking eye contact with him otherwise. </p><p>"Sirius," Lily deadpanned. "You steal my hairbrush, husband, sofa, and son on a regular basis. I think I have joint custody of this jacket."</p><p>"..." Sirius wrinkled his nose. "Just give it back before I leave, yeah?"</p><p>She nodded. That was fine. </p><p>Because after all it wasn't like she was wrong.</p></div>
