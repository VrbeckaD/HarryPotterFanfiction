I'd love to stick my axe in her face" he then says to Peeta Mellark not facing him of course "so, what do you think ? now that the whole world wants to sleep with you ?"</p><p>Katniss scoffs and says "I don't think the whole world..."</p><p>"I wasn't talking to you" he says turning to face Katniss.</p><p>"OK" mutters Katniss</p><p>He then asks Peeta "will you unzip ?" he moves his hair and turns his back to Peeta who replies "yeah" getting a look from Katniss and he unzips the outfit. He sighs and starts to strip out of the outfit, he gets his arms out of the outfit with his chest is revealed before he pulls it down completely, as he does this Katniss has the same look she did when Peeta unzipped the outfit, Peeta is looking right at him as is Haymitch but Peeta is having a hard time controlling his body. He stands in the elevator naked, he winks at Peeta and Haymitch before the elevator doors open and he leaves saying "thanks, let's do it again sometime"</p><p>"thank you" says Haymitch before he says "Harry Potter, District 7" Peeta leaves the elevator as the door close making Haymitch chuckle and Katniss gets an even more annoyed look.</p>
