    <p>Harry POV</p><p>Pain! Harry was in pain and didn’t know where he was. Dudley had chased him out of the Dursley’s yard. While Harry had lost him and his bully friends, he had gotten lost himself. It didn’t help that he couldn’t see. Harry’s first memory was already through blurry eyes and in the last six months, his vision was down to just telling light from dark. As his vision had started to go, his other senses had become far more acute. Harry was having an easier time sensing things around him and could even avoid Dudley and the bullies trying to swing at him or grab him. That didn’t mean he could tell how far he had run or how much time had passed.</p><p>Eventually, Harry could tell he had found the edge of a park. There was a strong smell of flowers and mulch. Harry remembered those from Aunt Petunia’s garden. He could hear the chains holding up swings and the creak of plastic on wood. He found a bench and sat down, pulling his knees up to his chest and tucking his head as tears began to fall.</p><p>Last night Uncle Vernon had used his belt after Harry accidently knocked over a vase. The TV had been so loud that Harry couldn’t quite “see” where he was going. Not that that mattered to his “family”. It was like they didn’t even realise he was blind and to be honest that was likely true. They never paid any attention to the small boy except when he messed up on chores or they needed someone to blame. Harry was starving, having missed the only time he really ate, which was the free lunch at school. He wondered if he was going to die out here. Harry knew the Dursleys were not wasting time searching for him and it was getting darker. </p><p>Severus POV</p><p>Snape’s typical scowl sat on his face as he went walking through the muggle areas near his house. This newest potion he was working to create was providing an aggravating challenge. Severus found himself in the unique situation of needing some fresh air to clear his head and think. The park nearby had a beautiful garden with a walking path through it. It was most likely the only place Severus found comfort outside of Hogwarts and his own flat. He rented a little flat as his old family home was full of bad memories.</p><p>Deep in thought, Severus found himself on an end of the park he normally did not visit. Startled at the amount of time that had passed, he realised it was getting late. Looking around to get his bearings, his eyes fell on a young child curled up on a park bench. He could hear loud sobs coming from the child and wondered where their parents were. This child could barely be more than 4 or 5 with how small they were. Severus couldn’t tell at this distance if they were a boy or girl.</p><p>Against his better judgement, Severus began moving toward the bench. When he was a few feet away, he cleared his throat so as not to scare the child. The child’s head popped up and swung toward him. However, Severus noticed that it stopped short of the eyes looking at him and the one ear was turned more in his direction.</p><p>“H..Hello...is...is someone there. P..please, I can’t see you. P..please don’t hurt me.” Severus gasped as he took a few more steps towards the boy. The child was blind. How could they be out here alone, no cane or guide dog. </p><p>Stepping closer, “child are you alone? I will not hurt you. I am about 5 feet to your right.” Now this close, Severus could tell the boy? Yes boy, was wearing threadbare clothes much to big for his frame. He was barefoot, and Severus could see dark rust colored stains on the boy’s clothes. Severus had enough experience to recognise dried blood. The boys head had turned to face him. Severus nearly went into shock as familiar emerald eyes searched for him without seeing him.</p><p>“Lily,” he muttered under his breath. He scanned the boy further. Other than the eyes and the pouty full lips, this young boy looked just like his old tormentor. There was no mistaking once he saw the scar, this was Harry Potter. The son of his hated enemy and his beloved Lily. Severus almost turned and fled right then. However, something else pulled him to the child’s side. When Harry flinched as he reached out to touch him, Severus knew this boy needed help.</p><p>Harry POV</p><p>Harry had no idea how long he had been sitting there. Suddenly, he heard someone clearing their throat. Turning his ear more toward the sound, Harry tried to pick up anymore sounds. “H..Hello...is...is someone there. P..please, I can’t see you. P..please don’t hurt me.” Harry heard a gasp and a rustle as the person moved closer. </p><p>“Child are you alone. I will not hurt you. I am about 5 feet to your right.” This man already realised he was blind. He must be smart. After turning to face the man more face on, he heard the man mutter Lily under his breath. </p><p>Harry flinched as the man was suddenly at his side. “It’s ok Harry, it’s ok. I won’t hurt you, I promise.”</p><p>“H..Harry? Who is Harry?” Harry’s head tilted in confusion. His name was Freak, and he told the man so.</p><p>“Those filthy Muggles, and bloody hell Albus, how could you let this happen.” Severus took a deep breath to calm himself. “No one is named freak. You are Harry. I knew your mum and dad, in fact, your mom was my friend. Their names were Lily and James. They were a witch and a wizard, and you, Harry, are also a wizard.”</p><p>“NO..no..parents bad drunks. Die in car crash.” Harry was in shock trying to understand.</p><p>“Harry, Harry calm down. Your parents were never drunks. They were brave and died defending you from a evil, bad man.” Severus swore under his breath, holding back from rushing off to kill those muggles and maybe Dumbledore as well. “Ok Harry. If you agree to it, I am going to take you home with me. You can have some food, clean up and sleep in a bed. How does that sound?”</p><p>Harry’s eyes widened. Food, a bed, this man was a total stranger, but he did seem to know Harry. He much prefered thinking his parents were not bad people and actually loved him. “I..I can come with you sir, you won’t hurt me? Or make me do ‘that’ with you?”</p><p>Severus POV</p><p>At this point, Severus was seething. If that question meant what he thought...well he was holding on by a thread. He needed to get home and make some floo calls and drink large quantities of Firewhiskey. “No Harry, I will never hurt you or do anything else bad to you. I promise I won’t. Will you come with me?” Severus was taken by surprise as the little boy leapt into his arms, hugging him tight. Severus’s heart melted slightly and he just held on tight as he stood up. “Hold on tight, this is going to feel weird.” Then with a crack, they were gone from sight.</p><p>Instantly, they were standing in Severus’s living room. He set Harry on the couch before making him a peanut butter sandwich and slicing up an apple for him. “Stay and eat, Harry. I need to get in touch with some people, ok. There is a sandwich and eight apple slices 2 inches beside your left hand on a plate.” As Harry began eating slowly, Severus went over to the floo. He started with Poppy, then called Lucius and Minerva. Within minutes of calling, each of them was standing in his small flat. </p><p>“Harry, would it be ok if Miss Poppy examines you with her magic? She is a healer and can help with any pain or cuts, ok.”</p><p>Poppy’s POV</p><p>When Harry nodded shyly, he sat still as Poppy ran her wand over him. Severus had already informed her that Harry was blind and told her to check for everything, even ‘that’. Poppy had turned pale at that, but stood resolute, afraid of what she was going to find. After she was finished, she had a small stack of diagnostic parchments. She told Harry that he could take a nap on the couch as she went and talked with the other adults. Harry laid down and was instantly asleep on the warm, comfy couch.</p><p>Poppy joined the rest of the adults at the kitchen table with a grim look on her face. None of the others were speaking and all three had tumblers of Firewhiskey in front of them. Severus slid a tumbler over to her as well and she took a small sip in order to calm down.</p><p>“This is appalling. He is only six and already all of this. First, off he is blind. He can tell when it’s light or dark around him but that is it and even that might fade. Severus, I think it is to late for any sort of potion to do any good. If we had caught it when it first started going bad, maybe, but it's to late.” Taking a deep breath to calm herself. “He has multiple improperly healed fractures and two breaks. There is scarring all over his back, chest, thighs, and arms. Some are burns and cuts. Many more look like he was whipped with something that had a metal end like a belt. He has been starved and is extremely malnourished. There is evidence of sexual assault as well.” At this, Poppy broke down in tears.</p><p>She watched as Severus got up and went to a cupboard and pulled out four vials. He handed one to each of them and kept one for himself. She trusted Severus, as he did brew all of the potions she used at the school, and downed hers. Poppy sighed as the Calming Draught immediately took effect. Her shoulders slumped in relief as did everyone else’s. Nobody lost the serious expression on their faces.</p><p>Severus POV</p><p>“Lucius, I need to know what legal actions I need to take to make sure those muggle monsters are dealt with to the full extent of the law. Also, if Albus is Harry’s guardian as I believe, he needs to be removed and if we can take action against him we shall do that as well. Not sure how much we can touch the old goat. Poppy, I need to know which potions Harry is going to need to improve. Minerva, I need you to run interference against Albus. Make sure he does not know what we are trying to do, and do not let him interfere. That bastard has failed Harry, probably in an attempt to manipulate Harry for his ‘Greater Good’ campaign.” Severus took a quick breath.</p><p>“I will not let Harry go back to those monsters or be manipulated. This goes against everything I felt towards Potter, but I will see to it the rest of his childhood is safe and happy.”</p><p>“Who knows Sev, maybe this little one can finally melt the ice block you trapped your heart in.” Minerva gave a rough laugh at the face Severus made. She could see, however, the softness that had already come to his eyes since she got here. She knew he had also had a rough childhood and hoped this would help both Sev and Harry heal.</p><p>“Ok, we know what needs to happen. Let’s meet back here in two days to see where we are at.”</p><p>All the adults nodded and made their way to the fireplace. They each went to their respective homes. Poppy took a moment first to go over the potion regimen Harry needed. She also stressed his need to eat properly but that it would take time for Harry to be able to eat bigger portion meals. Harry would also need support. She wasn’t sure how much his young mind might remember or retain. However, he had certainly had plenty of trauma. Poppy reminded Severus to look into Mind Healers  or even muggle therapists if he felt Harry needed the extra help.</p><p>With everyone gone, Severus walked back over to the couch. Looking down at this small child that he had now claimed responsibility for, Severus hoped he didn’t screw up. He couldn’t screw up. He had promised Lily, and he would be damned if he failed now. He picked up the little bundle. Harry gave a little snuffle and clutched at his robes. Despite everything Severus gave a small smile while tucking Harry in to the guest bed. He was going to need to get a bigger space after this, but that could come later. The next few days were going to be hectic, but Harry, Harry would be worth it.</p>
