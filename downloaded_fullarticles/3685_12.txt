  <i>ON Friday, the Wizarding world was finally rewarded for its patience regarding The Golden Man and his private life. He was seen at the Brew and Light, a gay pub at 2200 Friday evening with none other than a Potions Master, Norgden of Sweden. “They appeared to be completely smitten with one another and very much unable to take their hands from one another while dancing and drinking.” (SOURCES close to the Golden Man shared.) Sharing a bit of food later in the evening outside a Turkish kebab shop. </i>
