    <p>“Morning, class,” greeted Harry as he walked into the classroom on a Wednesday morning, already a few minutes late. </p><p>Ron had taken him out drinking last night. “Listen, mate,” he’d said. “You need to loosen up a little. I know things have been hard since Ginny left. But it’s been 2 years. I’m taking you out.” </p><p>What had started out as a pint of beer at a local pub in London had blown up into a massive drinking competition between Ron and Dean, whom they ran into, later into the night. Harry regretted it this morning. He threw up once in the shower and picked up his usual morning coffee with extra shots of expresso on his way to the school.</p><p>As the class shuffled about, settling themselves into their seats, Harry rubbed his forehead and decided that he was going to let Sally lead a discussion on of the books they had read in class. </p><p>20 minutes later, when still a decision hadn’t been made regarding the book to be discussed about, the vice principal, Luna Lovegood knocked on the door and motioned to him to step outside. </p><p>“I’ll be back in 5 minutes. We either have a discussion, or we have a pop quiz. It’s your call, people,” and said. </p><p>Outside, in the hallway, Luna was standing, leaning on the wall, looking at him in a disapproving manner. “You don’t look so good, Harry. What happened?”</p><p>Harry and Luna went to school together. Luna was a grade below him, but they were very good friends. </p><p>“Ugh, Ron and I went drinking last night. And we ran into Dean,” he groaned, leaning face-first into the wall.<br/>
“Can’t have been a good morning, then, I assume?” said Luna.<br/>
“Mhm hmm,” he said. He could hear her smile in her voice. Harry had always liked Luna. Though she had been Ginny’s best friend, they hadn’t lost touch or stopped talking to each other after the divorce. She had actually helped him through some tough times. Eccentric as she might be, Luna was a friend Harry could always count on, to be there for him. </p><p>“I hear Ron and Hermione are trying again?” she sounded happy for them. “Yeah,” he said, turning around and leaning back onto the wall. “He was saying something about it last night. I don’t really remember.”</p><p>“I’m not surprised. Anyway, I called you out to tell you that the yearbook pictures are gonna be taken today. And we need volunteers.”</p><p>“Is it that same person who did it last year? Because if it is, I’m out. He’s got a rod up his arse.”</p><p>“Harry,” Luna sounded tired, all of a sudden. “Yes, Mr. Malfoy’s very professional when it comes to his job, but he’s a nice person. One of my classmates went out with him a few years ago and he was the one who gave me his number. And according to him, Draco Malfoy’s a pretty cool person. You don’t have to talk to him. You can just stand in a corner, like you did last year and maybe just make sure that all the students get their pictures taken.”</p><p>“What did Parvati say about all this?”</p><p>“Well, as the principal, she has to meet with him personally. So she’s gonna be there, at least for half hour. And then, you’re on your own.”</p><p>Letting out a heavy breath, Harry said, “Alright, I’ll do it.”</p><p>“Thanks Harry,” said Luna, breaking into a smile. </p><p>“I’m doing this for you. Not for Parvati.”</p><p>“I know. But she’ll be happy you agreed to it.” Harry smiled at Luna and walked back into the class. Parvati was nice. She was his classmate, just like Ron and Hermione. But he had asked her to go with him to prom, and that night had been a complete disaster. But they’d gotten over it and worked together now. </p><p>“So,” Harry raised his voice so that the whole class could hear. “Have we come to a decision yet?”</p>
