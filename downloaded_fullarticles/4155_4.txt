    <p>I woke up, to my surprise, in my bed. The night before I was slurping ejaculatory shots from a three breasted woman's spinal crevice. The salty aftertaste was present upon my tongue, my nipples stiffened as I recovered feeling in my groin. I'll need to shower after this recall. I FEEL VIOLATED. I sit up and take in my surroundings, which seem so unfamiliar to me. The room is completely wrecked, cum, piss, blood, and chunks of my hair litter the floor and surrounding furniture. It had been such a night.</p>
<p>"BOOYAH!", said Douglas, or as he preferred to be known, Big D, as he climaxed in MY ASS. I wriggled away. But just as I was squirming across the bed, he collapsed atop me in post-orgasmic bliss. Consuming me in his size, enveloping me underneath him. The breath was knocked out of me, and I was flattened onto the bed (like a pancake). Big D had fallen asleep, it seemed. Years of training had prepared me for situations just like this. I steeled myself, and began chewing at the mattress underneath me. At first the material was hard and unrelenting, but once it gave way there was only cotton to prevent my escape from this squishy prison. My nipples stood on end in anticipation.</p>
<p>I was running out of air, and energy, I had to think fast, I was highly dehydrated from the nights constant shenanigans, I contemplated for a moment my options, and just when I was losing hope, my flesh muffled prayers were answered, and I felt a warm moisture pooling on my lower back. I didn't have to think twice, I arched my back as best I could and directed the stream of liquid towards my shoulders and let it dribble down my neck and onto the mattress I had been knawing. My attention was now focused on the task at hand. I suckled away with grim determination at the pungent urine from the mattress innards betwixt my lips. I felt my thirst had been quenched and the mission could continue. Finally I had chewed away enough mattress to reveal the frame of the bed, and fresh air filtered in to my flubbery tomb. Goose flesh was evident on my titties by the sudden cold.</p>
<p>It was several hours before I was finally free of that man. Not in the legal sense, of course, we were still married, or so he thought, and I was now thoroughly showered and on my way to the city centre to speak with my commanding officer to discuss my work environment. I approached his desk, bare bottom periodically visible as I strode confidently towards Mr. Clark-Sam, he looks up from his work, a decidedly horny glint in his eye. I resign myself, and easily slip off my billowing sarong...</p>
