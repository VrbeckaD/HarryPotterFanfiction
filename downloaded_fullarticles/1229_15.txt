    <em>“When you’ve both been drinking too much Firewhiskey/ It leaves the pair of you feeling quite frisky!” </em>
  </strong>
</p><h3>Chance meeting at the Leaky Cauldron! Climb up six places!</h3>
<p>Too much alcohol has loosened Harry’s tongue in the direction of Draco Malfoy. Loosened it enough to find him snogging the pointy git inside a scruffy toilet cubical. “I can’t tell you how long I’ve wanted this,” Draco whispers as they side-apperate to his bedroom. </p>

  <strong>
    <em>“Forgetting Draco’s birthday is a mighty great shame/ This Slytherin won’t stint with his blame”</em>
  </strong>
</p><h3>Draco ignores you for a week! Slide down six places!</h3>
<p>Harry can’t remember Draco ever being this furious before. </p>
<p>“I thought we had something special,” he hisses. “I’m going to Mothers.” Harry sends ten, fifteen, twenty owls before Draco comes home and slides into their bed. </p>

    <em>““Your first public kiss feels so splendid/ But the next day’s Prophet feels so offended”</em>
  </strong>
</p><h3>Your friend rally round when the newspapers print vile headlines! Climb up four places!</h3>
<p>“Potter Malfoy Snog Shocker” reads Hermione. “That’s a dreadful headline. Let me fix that” </p>
<p>With a twirl of her wand, the title rearranges itself. <em>“Rita Skeeter is a Pestilent Creature”</em> becomes the newspaper headline of the day. </p>

    <em>““So much in love, but six months apart?/ Draco tells you it’s breaking his heart”</em>
  </strong>
</p><h3>You leave for a short secondment with MACUSA! Slide down seven places!</h3>
<p>“Of course I don’t want to go,” Harry says, his voice full of anguish. “But I’m not sure what else I can do. MACUSA has requested out help breaking down an illegal Potions ring. It won’t be any longer than six months. I’ll be home every other weekend-”</p>
<p>“But it won’t be the same,” Draco says, his eyes red with unspent tears. “You <em>arse</em>. You do realise I’ve fallen in love with you?”</p>

  <strong>
    <em>““Back in London, you go down on one knee/ ‘Draco Malfoy,’ you ask ‘will you marry me?’”</em>
  </strong>
</p><h3>He accepts! Climb up ten places!</h3>
<p>“Of course, I’ll marry you.” Draco’s eyes are wild, full of joy. The last six months had been difficult, fraught and hard, but they’d proved to Harry that the two men were soulmates. </p>
<p>“I’m never leaving you again, love,” Harry says as he slips on the emerald engagement ring. “Be mine. Always.”</p>

    <em>““The day arrives, and Draco looks breathtaking/ He is your true love, of that there is no mistaking”</em>
