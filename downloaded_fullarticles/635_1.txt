  <span>„Where have we put the Fever Fudge,“ George called, wiping the cobwebs stuck to his fingers off on his pants. He peaked over the stacks of boxes surrounding him which was hard as his foot was jammed under a barrel of Belladonna and his eyes were bleary with dust. They had enchanted a dozen lanterns to hover near the ceiling of the basement, but somehow the space seemed to swallow up light like Dobby collected clothing. With fervor. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Fred, buried somewhere across the room, in another valley of cardboard and inventory, did not reply. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>„Merlin,“ George cursed and fiddled for his wand. „Lumos.“ With his hand raised over his head, George climbed out of his prison of boxes and back onto the main corridor they had created down the basement to gain some semblance of control. He cast around for his brother, a foot, a tuft of red hair, but to no avail. Either Fred had left the room without telling George or he was being an annoying little shit. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>„Look.“ George stopped in the middle of the room and rubbed his forehead where a headache had nagged away at his sanity ever since the morning. „I cannot deal with you right now, just tell me where you‘ve put it.“ </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>They were supposed to open their shop in two days and to say things were in disarray was an understatement. The basement was filled to the brim with stuff and the shop was in chaos. Shelves half-installed, bowls of special Bertie Bott‘s overturned, empty tea mugs all over the place. They had had things under control until Fred had just grabbed George by the front of the shirt in the middle of setting up the register, and had kissed him as if he‘d been suffocating and George‘s lips were the oxygen he needed. Full of tongue and incoherent murmurs and hands everywhere. And of course, George had let him. Nothing triumphed Fred kissing him, not even opening a joke shop. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>So what if they had wasted an afternoon fooling around? So what if they had made a mess of things in the process? At the time, George had thought it had been worth it. Now, he wasn‘t so sure. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>„Fred, stop being a cock.“ Silence. And then, a small whimper coming from his right. George rounded a stack of chessboards which had been slightly modified to punish the players for losing pieces. Truth be told, they still hadn‘t found out all the punishments, but some were hilarious. George still picked bits of blue paint out of his ears to date. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Behind the stack, his torso wedged between extra shelves, lay Fred. On his back, staring up at George with wide eyes. Rainbow-colored ropes had wrapped around his body, rendering him immobile. An equally rainbow-colored piece of tape covered his mouth. He whimpered again. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>George snorted, trying to bite back his laughter. „Oh this is grand,“ he said. „You should see yourself.“ And then it burst out of him and he doubled over, clutching his stomach. Howling. This was just too much. A week of alternately unpacking and fucking, apparating to the Burrow because they couldn‘t be bothered to cook, and now Fred had gotten himself tied up. Between fits of hysteria, George seriously considered leaving him there and carrying on on his own. He turned around, but Fred thrashed and squealed. The spell would wear off, of course. But neither of them knew how long it would take. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>George put his hands on his hips in his best impression of their mother and pitched his voice up. „Fred Weasley, I told you to get right of that stuff last week. Am I surprised? Of course not. You never do the responsible thing. Merlin, what am I going to do with you.“ Fred stopped thrashing but his eyes were still wild. They loved each other, but that didn‘t mean they trusted each other. Not when they were born with hearts full of mischief and lips quick to curl in mockery. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Oh, but this was an opportunity George couldn’t pass up. Give Fred a taste of panic and why not. He grinned and knelt down, Fred‘s thighs between his. He leaned forward, one hand splayed on Fred’s chest, and tapped the tape with his wand. It dissolved. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>„Oh bloody hell,“ Fred gasped, glaring at George. „Do you even realize how long I have been like this?“ </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>„Nope.“ </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>„An eternity. C‘mon, dispel the ropes and I‘ll show you where I‘ve put the Fever Fudge.“ Fred batted his eyelashes. His hair was deliciously messed up from his accident and his cheeks flushed red as George, instead of freeing his brother, lowered himself until their faces were barely an inch apart. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>„I‘d rather not,“ George said and eased into the fire burning under his skin, the turmoil in his chest. A distant voice told him he should stop with the shenanigans and get working. He‘d be upset with himself again. But that voice was easily drowned out by the thundering of his heartbeat. Or was it Fred‘s. It was hard to tell sometimes. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>„Georgie,“ Fred pleaded and looked as though he had no idea for what exactly. There was a tremor in his voice. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>„I can‘t imagine how uncomfortable it must be, tied up on the cold floor.“ </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>„You really can‘t,“ Fred said though he really meant: It’s not so bad now you’re with me. George could read that in his twin’s lingering blush. It was always like this with them, a dangerous dance on the line between pranks and passion. They made themselves unpredictable even with each other and in George’s opinion that was what made it fun. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>I could kiss you, he thought and his throat constricted with the urge. Or I could hex your face green for the next week. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Please go for kissing, Fred thought, his hand wriggling under the ropes, under George’s hip to reach something, anything. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>George closed his eyes and dipped lower, pressing his lips to the corner of Fred’s mouth, barely more than an echo of a promise. Fred hadn’t the time to react before George was on his feet and had dispelled the trap. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh,” Fred said and let himself be pulled upward, right into George’s arms. “Thank you, good sir.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What, did you think I was going to leave you there,” George chuckled and hummed in pleasure as Fred awkwardly wrapped his arms around his neck. They were still stiff from the pressure. Their foreheads fell together. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You were going to leave me there. Git.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Hey!” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You called me a cock earlier so I think we’re even,” Fred murmured. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Well, there was this one time -“ Fred kissed him silent. And then again. And then they were crashing into each other, full of desperation and want and if they tumbled into the chess sets and put themselves behind schedule (again) no one was any the wiser for it later. They made opening day just fine, wearing matching scarves to cover the aftermath. </span>
