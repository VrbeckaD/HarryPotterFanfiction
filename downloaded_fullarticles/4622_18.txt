  <strong>~CHAPTER 1~</strong>

  <em>He was being chased by a wizard with his eyes gouged out, and blood gushed from the empty sockets. The rest of the landscape was barely recognizable. The sky was black, stained with dark, sulfurous smoke. The trees were all burnt and stark, some of them still flaming with angry red tendrils of heat. All of the ground was buried in corpses, rotting and covered in blood.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>There were several volcanoes exploding out of the ground, pouring orange lava into the sky.  A throne of pure white human skulls, each grinning and displaying sharp teeth, towered over the landscape. Lounging on the top of the pile of bones was a wizard in a tattered, bloody black hood, laughing insanely at the war beneath.</em>

  <em>Lazarus felt fingers on his back. He turned around to see the same wizard from before, but now there was blood coming from his mouth and nose, too. He opened his mouth, displaying rotten gums, devoid of teeth, crawling with insects.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Lazarus screamed.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“B-EWAAARE THE PHAAAAANTOOOOM!” His voice hissed in a rasp, like wind blowing through ancient trees and creaking like wood. “THE MAAASKED… THE MAAASKED…. THE MAAASKED PHAAAAANTOOOOM!!!!”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Then his face began to melt. First, the skin, sliding off like water, next the muscles dripping like blood, leaving nothing but a gray skull. Then it, too, dissolved into dust.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>He had a blistering feeling of agony like there was hot wax pouring into his ears and scorching his brain, and then an image flashed across his vision. It was an eye. A humongous reptilian eye, with a bloody slash across it and two fiery wings. The pain was so unbearable, but the image stayed burned in his mind, clear as daylight. Then it dissipated, and the pain was gone.</em>

        And then he woke up.</p>
