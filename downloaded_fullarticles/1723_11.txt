    <p>Queenie stared at the ever-so-polished Rosier, standing before her. Her lips were highlighted in outstanding purple lipstick, hair pinned back into neat curls, and she was eyeing her spotless black nails. Rosier’s mind was nothing, with the Occlumency she always used. </p><p>“Y-you wanted to talk to me?” Queenie said, resisting the urge to bite at her pink upper lip, shiny with lipstick. She settled for fingering her dress’s wide lace collar. Being unable to Rosier’s mind always made her nervous. At least Grindelwald thought in German, even if she couldn’t understand it. Not having thoughts to hear made Queenie think of a corpse.</p><p>“Oh I did.” Rosier’s smile was sickeningly sweet. Ever so cunning, as though she had a secret plan behind it Queenie couldn’t see. She probably did anyway, Rosier always seemed to be two steps ahead, to assume the lead, for everything. Rosier smoothed out her green silk dress, steeling herself for something. “Goldstein, you’ve been here long enough. You… You realize this is war, yes?”</p><p>“Um--yes.” Queenie couldn't see where she was going.</p><p>Standing next to Credence, she looked at him out of the corner of her green eyes. Pride ruffled its feathers like a proud bird. Rather than waifish as he’d looked when they’d first arrived here five years ago, he now wore a black suit in a self-stripe pattern, his hair longer, slicked back. Standing with the confidence of someone who knew his place now, he gave her a concerned frown. </p><p>
  <em> Do you know what she wants? She never sees you off. She barely speaks to you.  </em>
</p><p>Queenie gave him a brief jerk of the head--no. </p><p>“Do you?” Rosier said. She looked up and down at Queenie, frowning at everything from her white heels, to her pink dress with the tiny white flowers, to the white hat wore to match. She finally met the latter’s eyes, head tilted to the side, acting confused. </p><p>“I--uh--yes--” Queenie said. </p><p>It had its uses, though. She thought of the children, downstairs, and listened. Only a trickle of MacDuff’s thoughts slipped through his intermediate Occlumency. </p><p><em> Qualified for more--stuck watching the kids--waste </em>. </p><p> She remembered the bored and frustrated expression on MacDuff’s face when Grindelwald had asked him to keep an eye on Credence, the children, until Queenie came back from her next mission. The explanation that he’d given to MacDuff, topped with an impatient glare, <em> “MacDuff, the children need a fully qualified wizard to ensure their safety for now. You are a fully qualified wizard, are you not?” </em></p><p>“Well, I know you’re tailing the head of no-maj affairs at MACUSA,” Rosier said, raising an elegantly trimmed eyebrow at her. “When push comes to shove, don’t ruin everything because you won’t… What is that English saying? Get your hands dirty, Ms. Goldstein.” </p><p>Queenie stared blankly. She didn’t get it. She’d never been close with Rosier and was not certain if she understood what Rosier was trying to imply. She suspected, but hoped she was mistaken. </p><p>“I’m sorry, but I don’t know what you mean.” Queenie gave a confused glance at Credence, who had a concerned frown on his face. </p><p>
  <em> She means-- </em>
</p><p>Her eyes reminded Queenie of a serpent's and she looked just as venomous. Maybe it was the effect of the green she wore? “Don’t create problems on the field just because you are not willing to kill, Goldstein.”</p><p>“But of course I wouldn’t kill, why would I--”</p><p>“Aurors!” Rosier barked out, losing her temper. Credence took step to Queenie, face ashen and knuckles white. “Oh, I’m not going to hurt anyone.” Rosier snapped at Credence. She looked back at Queenie. “I know you, you’re too soft to even think about taking lives. This is no longer about you and your wants, this is for the greater good. Thanks to your talent, you know too much information from both sides. When it comes down to it, are you able to kill the Aurors? Even when one of them is your sister? You have much to lose, don’t forget that.” </p><p>With that she walked off and Queenie looked at Credence. She swallowed. Queenie had no desire to discuss what she had just heard. Credence, however, did. </p><p>
  <em> Aurors all want me dead--but your sister is an Auror and she saved me! </em>
</p><p>Queenie hadn’t felt this queasy since the morning sickness she’d had during her pregnancy with the twins. She did not want to discuss killing. She hadn’t joined Grindelwald to do harm, simply to free wizards and witches from a stuffy old law. </p><p>“Let’s… I want to go and say goodbye to the kids. Coming, honey?” She knew what the answer would be. Credence adored her children. </p><p>Credence nodded and they headed downstairs, where MacDuff stood grumpily with the twins. Tony had a bored expression and thought longingly of soaring around Nurmengard’s towers on his broomstick and Audrey glumly thought <em> Mr. MacDuff won’t like a tea party. </em> She stared dejected at the floor. <em> Could play with dolls or convince Tony to play. Or Credence! Credence will, I’ll ask Credence! </em></p><p>“Credence!” Audrey said. “Will you have a tea party with me? With actual tea from the kitchens?”</p><p>“Yeah, sure,” Credence said, hugging her. </p><p>Queenie knelt down and kissed each of the Kowalski twins goodbye, planting an identical kiss on both of their foreheads. </p><p>“Now, you both now I love you very much,” Queenie said, a hand coming to rest on each of their shoulders. They may be twins, but physique-wise Tony had broader shoulders while Audrey’s was narrower, reminding Queenie of a bird’s delicate bone structure. </p><p><em> Hehe, you’re funny, Mommy! I’m not a bird. </em> </p><p>Queenie smiled at Audrey, amused, and continued on, “I love you, and so does Daddy. Mommy has to go out for a few days to work, so that we and daddy can be together, all four of us.” </p><p>Tony frowned, wrinkling his brows until it resembled the wrinkles on his grey and black plaid suit Queenie had picked out for him that morning. “How do you know? You said daddy was very far away.” Credence scowled at the mention of Tony and Audrey’s father. “How do you know he loves us?”</p><p>“I just know,” Queenie said, placing her hands on Tony’s cheeks. “He’d be with us, if he could.” Queenie swallowed a bit as she spoke. </p><p><em>There she goes again, defending the twins’ father.</em> <em>I don’t understand it. Why does she care for someone who hurt her so badly? Someone who didn’t</em>--</p><p>“Credence.” She kept her voice firm, but gentle. Queenie glanced at Credence and there was a crease in her usually lineness forehead, she walked over to him. </p><p>“We’ve had this argument before,” Queenie said to Credence, swallowing him up in a hug. She whispered the next bit. “I’m not having it with you again in front of the twins.” She broke away, a big grin on her face. “Now, I know you’ll take the best care of them while I’m gone. Keep workin’ on <em> Silencio </em>, you’ll get there.” </p><p>Tony perked up and he hurried over to Credence, Audrey following. “Yeah! We can help!” </p><p>“Yeah, make Tony quiet!” Audrey said, her eyes twinkling with the mischievous gleam of a sibling. Queenie knew the look well. Why, sometimes with Teenie she had used to--but no, she wouldn’t think about that. </p><p>Tony, meanwhile, was displeased with his sister picking on him. </p><p>
  <em> Why me? Mommy, Audrey’s the noisy one, not me!  </em>
</p><p>“Mommy, Tony says I’m noisy, but I’m not!” Audrey straightened, like how Grindelwald make them all stand in attention in the Great Hall in the mornings. “I’m a good girl!”</p><p>“Didn’t say it,” Tony mumbled, looking at the ground, hands in his pockets. </p><p>Audrey stuck out her tongue. “It was in your head.”</p><p>Queenie looked forlorn, her face somber. “Both of you, stop this. You might not always get along, but you should enjoy having each other here in the same place.” Queenie thought back to her sister when they were both younger. An ambitious and determined image of Tina appeared in her mind, hands around Queenie hugging her tightly.</p><p>“Auntie Teenie!” Audrey exclaimed. “Oh! She hugged mommy. I like hugs!” Audrey turned and considered her brother for a moment, before wrapping Tony in a hug. Tony gasped a little from the out of nowhere affection from his sister. “Stay right here, okay? We stick together!”</p><p>Queenie beamed, but the smile didn’t reach her eyes. “Yes, please do. You… You never really know how much you miss your sibling until--well.” Did Tina miss her as much as Queenie did? Probably not. She’d mostly been an annoyance to Tina and now, was a disgrace. </p><p>Queenie straightened and cleared her throat. “Well, I’ll be going now.” Everyone queued in front of Queenie for one last hug, save for MacDuff, who still stood sulking with his arms crossed. He looked like Tony when Queenie wouldn’t let him stay up late listening to Quidditch on the radio. Queenie tried not to sigh as she shook as his hand. She had wished for someone who loved children to watch the twins the next two days, but no one else was free. </p><p>“I know this is a huge favor to ask, thank you so much.” Almost anyone else would have gotten a hug, but MacDuff was as unpleasant as Rosier, who had just asked her to consider murder. She offered MacDuff her hand instead, which he shook stiffly.</p><p>
  <em> Snot-nosed brats-- </em>
</p><p>“Yeah, I know you aren’t the best with kids, which is why I admire you so much for agreeing anyway,” Queenie said, wishing she had more to say. An awkwardly long moment dragged by.</p><p> She grabbed her case, flung Floo Powder into the flames, stated her destination and was gone. </p><p>There was a long silence after Queenie left, the twins silent after seeing their mother off on another mission. MacDuff looked bored. Both children glanced around the room, obviously drawing a blank as to what was next. </p><p>“I miss Mommy,” Audrey said quietly, lip wobbling. </p><p>“Me too,” Tony said. His head whipped over to Credence. “Credence, can I fly?” Hope etched itself into every line of his face. </p><p>Credence sighed. “Go and get your broom. But don’t break anything! Mr. Grindelwald doesn’t like that!” </p><p>Tony had stopped paying attention at the mention of  “go.” “YES!” Tony hurried upstairs as fast as his little legs could carry him. </p><p>“Can you summon me a book?” Audrey asked. “I wanna read it and show Mommy when she’s home! It’ll make her happy!” She beamed, tea party clearly forgotten.</p><p>Credenced pulled out the wand Grindelwald had given him and summoned one of Audrey’s children's books. </p><p>“Thanks, Credence!” She skipped over to a big plush velvet sofa covered with at least five matching pillows and hauled herself up. Credence smiled as she settled in and began reading aloud, speaking the words she didn’t understand slower. He loved those children. He would do anything so they wouldn’t have a childhood like his, unwanted and unloved. It was a pity they had started that way, no thanks to their father. Good thing he was here with the twins. </p><p>“Do you need help with the book, Audrey? We can sound out the hard words together.” </p><p>She shook her head, eyes still glued to her book. “Nope!” </p><p>Tony came running back downstairs, broom in hand. Credence grinned. MacDuff frowned. </p><p>It was a tradition every year, that on the twins’ birthday, he would give Tony Kowalski a toy broomstick. This was broom number four. </p><p>Tony eagerly mounted the broom and flew in a few circles above the ground, a big grin on his face. It couldn’t go more than a few feet, partly because it was a training broom that was meant for toddlers, and also because it had been charmed by Queenie, who was worried about him “falling and breaking his neck.” Not that Credence minded her fussing. He secretly wished that he’d had a mother like her. </p><p>MacDuff sighed. “Watch them, I’m bringing down some paperwork to finish before dinner.” He walked up the stairs slowly and was gone for at least five minutes (Credence counted on the silver pocket watch with a phoenix engraved on the lid that Grindelwald gifted him four years ago, to honor Credence’s first year with at Nurmengard.)</p><p>Tony zoomed around the large foyer, grinning loudly. Credence noticed MacDuff’s reappearance out of the corner of his eye and Audrey must have “heard” him with her Legilimency, for she looked up in time to say with Credence “Tony, look out!”</p><p>Tony nearly flew into MacDuff’s legs and had to swerve to avoid him. MacDuff jumped out of the way, pale with a vein throbbing in his neck. He gestured angrily at Tony. </p><p>“Aurelius! Why is Anthony not being careful? I told you to watch him while I was upstairs, did I not?” MacDuff glanced at Tony. “Boy! Get off that broom, I have something to say to you!”</p><p>Tony’s eyes widened and he slid off the broom, and approached warily, sticking close to Credence. Audrey flung down her book and skipped over. She crooked her head at MacDuff.</p><p>“You feel mad. Is Tony in trouble?”</p><p>MacDuff nodded at Audrey. “A pleasure as always, Miss. Audrey. Tony, why don’t you follow more in your sister’s example?” Audrey put a hand on her brother’s shoulder, to comfort him. “Learning and reading, instead of filling up on sweets and Quidditch! What do you think you’ll become when you’re older, boy?”</p><p>Tony thought about it. He lit up. “A Quidditch player!”</p><p>“You, play Quidddich? You’ve never even left this castle.” He sniggered. “And you’ll probably never will. Anyway, there are far better uses for one’s time than flying around on a broom and chasing flying balls.”</p><p>“I thought our goal here was the freedom for wizards to be themselves?” Credence questioned fiercely, his hand bringing Tony, closer. “If Tony wants to play Quidditch, I don’t see why he can’t.” </p><p>“I--” MacDuff frowned, still scowling. “Yes, that is--”</p><p>“Right <em> of course </em>!” Grindelwald called as he came downstairs, skull in one hand, a book on divination stuffed with papers in the other. He surveyed the scene before him, as though examining a move he was about to make in a game of chess. “We fight for freedom for wizards to be themselves.” He stopped at the bottom of the stairs, ruffing each of the children’s hairs in turn. “If Tony wants to play, I don’t see why he shouldn’t. What team do you want to play for, boy?”</p><p>“America, sir!” Tony piped up eagerly. “They have Dorian Smackhammer and that’s where Mommy’s from.” </p><p>“And Daddy,” Audrey added. </p><p>MacDuff’s lip curled. Grindelwald frowned at the acolyte. </p><p>“I think our Tony will amount to plenty,” Grindelwald said. “Try to be kinder to the children, MacDuff. They are members of our little family, after all.” He gave Audrey a little pet on the head, before he strode past them. </p><p align="center">#</p><p>The next day, Credence found himself in the kitchens with the children. He was supposed to be up in his room practicing magic, but MacDuff had agreed to meet them in the kitchens after lunch, yet, he was absent again. Credence was frustrated, his anger boiling like the bubbling water in the pot he had been trying to silence with all his might. He would tell Queenie about this, as soon as she returned. MacDuff was assigned for the children’s protection, and he was failing. The twins did not deserve to be neglected. </p><p>Audrey sat next to the bin where they kept wood to stoke the kitchen’s fire. She had another children’s book propped open and was staring determinedly at the pages. Sometimes, Credence wished that Audrey would allow herself to relax and have more fun. Many of the acolytes praised her for her advanced reading skills, how nicely she kept her room, and her growing Legilimency skills. He worried for her because he knew the adults placed ]too much pressure on her to be the perfect girl, when she was still very young. </p><p>“I’m okay, Credence!” Audrey said brightly, not looking up at him. Tony stood with Credence at the pot, his brow wrinkled as he glanced from Credence to Audrey. Credence suspected that Tony disapproved of Audrey’s attention to books. The boy did like playing with his sister, as much as flying on the broom.</p><p>Credence wasn’t going to give up that easily, though. He gave Tony an <em> I’ve-got-this </em> look. Tony nodded. </p><p>“You can come and play with us, join us in making this pot quiet,” Credence kept his voice gentle. He missed Modesty. “No one will be mad if you have a bit of fun.”</p><p>“Mr. MacDuff was,” Audrey squared her shoulders a little, the corners of her eyes turning up to meeting Credence. “I want to be a good girl.”</p><p>Credence’s heart broke a little. Damn that man!</p><p>Audrey giggled. “Mommy doesn’t like it when you use bad words, Credence.” </p><p>Credence’s eyes lit up with mischief. Maybe he could still work this out. Audrey deserved to have a childhood, unlike him. How many times had he passed out leaflets, instead of playing with Chastity? </p><p>“Well, Mommy isn’t here right now,” Credence said, giving her a challenging and mischievous glance he hoped Tony would be proud of. He held out a hand to her. “Come on, A, let’s go!” He would put aside his studies for a bit, if it meant Audrey could have a fun and carefree afternoon. He would <em> even </em>sit through the tea party she had wanted. </p><p>Audrey’s face was a confusing mess of emotions. Something in her eyes looked happy and hopeful that Credence would sit through a tea party with her, even if he didn’t enjoy them very much. She leaned forward, as though eager, her hands already closing the book. </p><p>
  <em> “Why don’t you follow more in your sister’s example? Learning and reading.” </em>
</p><p>Her face blazed red and her eyes seemed to narrow. </p><p>“I-I wanna read and you’re being noisy!” She flipped open the book again and brought it close to her face.</p><p>Credence knew this well. He had seen it often, with Modesty when she’d been a few years younger. Pretending to like doing something, when in fact it was not what she wanted at all. This was not fine at all, it was unfair for the acolytes to make Audrey feel like she had to be a good girl all the time. </p><p><em> “I’m fine!” </em> Audrey snapped. The brown eyes of the Goldstein sister who had saved him from a beating so many years ago--Credence had never forgotten those eyes--were beginning to take on a glassy shine. “I’m a good girl! I am! I AM!” A house elf scurried over, hoping to please the young girl. </p><p>“Would Miss Audrey like some popcorn to feel better?”</p><p>Audrey sniffed and bit her lip. She nodded. Credence sighed in relief as Audrey followed the house-elf. At least the young girl agreed to have a sweet snack.</p><p>Groups of house-elves bustled around preparing dinner to feed the many people in Nurmengard. Several were standing by the multiple ovens watching the geese cook in the heat. A few supervised the cleaning of over forty potatoes in the large metallic sinks. A dough for a lemon bread flattened itself with a rolling pin on a cutting board directed by a house elf on a long counter in the middle of the room coated with flour and egg goo. </p><p>Credence turned away from the scene to focus on Tony, who still remained next to Credence by the pot. Although the little boy could not read minds, Credence knew from the sweat on Tony’s brow that he also worried. The older man mused, what would Tony be worried about? The fact that their babysitter had not shown up? Whether or not Credence would be in trouble for being down in the kitchens with them when he shouldn’t? Or Audrey reacting negatively to playing with them? </p><p>“Well… Let’s see if I can do this, huh, Tony?” Credence sighed. Tony nodded. Credence straightened his back. He just had to do the best he could with what he had. Right now he had to make sure he watched the twins and did his work.  </p><p>He aimed his wand.</p><p>“<em> Silencio </em>!” </p><p>The pot continued to boil <em> loudly </em>. Tony’s features slumped. He tugged on Credence’s sleeve, gave him a smile of encouragement.  </p><p>“Don’t give up!”</p><p>Credence tried again. Did he hold his wand wrong? Why was he so bad at being a wizard? While he mulled over this, Tony ventured over to a jar where wizard candy was kept, a rare import that only came a few times a year. He pulled out a Chocolate Frog. Credence noted Tony picking out the candy, but refrained from stopping the boy. It was only one chocolate after all. He turned back to his attention back to the spell. </p><p>The door burst open. MacDuff entered. Finally. His eyes were already narrowed. He was cross. Audrey froze, before she ducked under the counter,  a house-elf still flattening dough. What did the young Legilimens see in his mind, if anything? MacDuff shoved past Tony, to get to the tins of tea they kept up in the cabinets. </p><p>“Out of my way, boy,” MacDuff said. “I don’t care what Grindelwald says,” he lowered his voice but Credence could still hear him. Audrey watched from under the table, biting her lip. “Between us boys, you’re just a stupid little child who favors brawn over brains--”</p><p>In that moment, all Credence thought of was his Ma, how he once used to hide his dreams and interests, just to survive in the Second Salem church. His fear of admitting, even to himself, he was a wizard had been the reason why he had been mutilated, forever separate and unlike other wizards. He aimed his wand at MacDuff. </p><p>“<em> Silencio </em>!”</p><p>MacDuff continued to move his mouth, but no words came out. Both of the twins erupted in giggles, which were followed by cheers. MacDuff slammed the tin of tea leaves on the counter top, flashed a rude gesture at Credence and stomped out in an embarrassed huff. Belatedly, Credence realized that he had given MacDuff an opportunity to shirk his child minding duties, and now the younger man had to continue handling both his studies and watching the children (and what if something went wrong and he needed a real wizard?). Not that he cared right now. It felt like they’d won. Credence reached down and ruffled Tony’s hair. </p><p>“Thank you, Credence!” Tony said. He flung his arms around Credence for a grateful hug, squeezing tightly. “You’re the bestest!”</p><p>“Ever!” Audrey added, coming out from beneath the table to join in the hug. “Thank you for protecting my brother.” </p><p>Credenced beamed at them both. “I always will.”</p><p align="center">#</p><p>MacDuff was cross and annoyed by the end of the dinner that Audrey voiced his every insecurity and worry. When Tony giggled at this, MacDuff glared at him. Credence glared at MacDuff in turn. After dinner, when Credence had went up to his room to study privately.</p><p>Tony gave MacDuff the slip as MacDuff worried about trying to improve his Occlumency around Audrey. Pausing only to get a book on drawing and some art supplies from his bedroom, he hurried up the stairs to the library. The friendly would be quiet after the bad day. </p><p>The library was a large room. It had a large chandelier that was about three times as big as Tony. There were lots of old artifacts whose purpose Tony didn’t understand and, of course, lots of books, some pristine and unopened. A suit of armor stood by the door, and next to it, a chest that Audrey liked to hide in when they played hide-and-seek sometimes. In the center, were three circular wood tables, which each seated three people. Tony sat at the table nearest the window, which had a view of the mountains. It made him think of how he would rather be zooming around the mountains, than stuck in a castle. </p><p>MacDuff was right, he did like sports over reading. But he didn’t care. Right now… Right now, after what had happened before dinner, he just wanted to be alone. </p><p>Tony pulled out the empty parchment and a blunt pencil, as well as a book Mommy had got him for his birthday, <em> Drawing Quidditch Players for Kids </em>, which he had brought from his room, and began drawing. He drew his favorite Quidditch player, Dorian Smackhammer. Or what he thought Smackhammer must look like, he had never seen him in person after all, only listened to his matches on the wizarding wireless network. </p><p>Tony gave Smackhammer curls, because he had curls, and made him small and thin, like a Seeker was supposed to be. He, too, wanted to be a Seeker, flying at fast speeds to catch a shiny golden ball. However some of the acolytes had laughed at him before, saying that he was not small and thin enough. </p><p>Footsteps thudded outside and Tony ignored them, tongue between his teeth. He gave his all focusing on his drawing. </p><p>Tony was just shading in the robes when a large bulky hand snatched the picture away.Tony’s eyes snapped up, only to see MacDuff ripping it up.. </p><p>“Another talent that will get you nowhere in life, boy.” he snarled. Tony stared tearfully at the pieces of his drawing. His heart felt like it was breaking into tiny pieces. He blinked at MacDuff with anger and fear. Where was Audrey? His sister supposed to be with him! </p><p>MacDuff grabbed Tony by the arm, hauling him of his chair. Tony’s foot twisted around the chair, and he whimpered. He tried to stand up straight, snatching his arm from MacDuff, giving him a defiant glare. “What will you do now without Aurelius here to protect you?” He barred his teeth like a scary dog.  No one loves you enough to be here to protect you.”</p><p>He wasn’t just mean, he was a liar. Tony tried to reach down and rub his sore ankle, his body bending sideways. “That’s not true! Mommy loves me, so does Daddy!”</p><p>“If that is true,” MacDuff said, grabbing Tony’s lowered arm and yanking it back upwards, not letting go. The boy’s eyes watered with pain, and he tried hard not to blink, refusing to let them spill out. He wouldn’t let MacDuff see him cry. “Then where is your Daddy now? He had the chance to choose glory and stay by your mother’s side you know, but did not. You’re a fool, much like your father, you stupid Mudblood.” MacDuff spat out the words, taking pride in showing his disgust.</p><p>Tony did not know what that meant, but the way the man said it probably meant something bad. Tony looked away from MacDuff. He shook worse than when he would come in from playing with Audrey in the snow. If he was a grown wizard, he could defend himself, but he was just a kid. What could he do?— That was when the answer hit him—</p><p><em> Audrey! </em> Mommy was too far to hear him, but Audrey was close enough. She’d come. <em> Audrey, help! </em></p><p>“H-he’s far away. Mommy says we’ll be together, when all this is over!”</p><p>“A bold assumption, little boy. Whatever it is, he’s certainly not here to protect you.” Shifting his grip, the acolyte took Tony’s finger in his own and pressed the top knuckle inwards. Hard. An audible crack could be heard in the empty room. Tony yelped in pain. “No one is protecting you at all, <em> failure </em>. You know why I think Daddy isn’t here? He didn’t want you.”</p><p>“Y-you’re lying!” But was it really a lie? Tony didn’t know.</p><p>“Am I?” His eyes glinted. He bent another finger inwards, almost crushing the little digit. Tony whimpered in pain. “Daddies love and protect, but where is your Daddy now? Your mommy says you’ll be together someday but that is a lie, she’s off promoting the greater good and does our master’s work. For that matter, does she <em> really </em> love you, boy? Maybe she loves working more than her children.”</p><p>The door burst open with a loud bang, Credence stomping in followed by Audrey. Credence stared horrified for a moment at the scene in front of him, and in less than half a second, he pulled out his wand and aimed at MacDuff, who fell to the ground, stiff as a board. </p><p>Finally freed from MacDuff’s clutch, Tony began to cry, cradling his hand against his body. Credence and Audrey rushed over, both pulling him into hugs. </p><p>“It’s okay, it’s okay,” Credence said. “I’ve got you, you’re safe now.” </p><p>“Yeah!” Audrey said as she broke away from her brother. “Mr. MacDuff told me to stay where I was while he went to look for you. I went to find Credence. Then I heard you. We ran here.” </p><p>“H-he said no one wants me or loves me,” Tony hugged himself and Credence squeezed him tighter, causing the younger boy to yelp in pain from the contact. Credence broke away from Tony, gently coaxing the boy to show him the affected fingers. Delicately examining the small hand, Credence aimed his wand at the now-swollen fingers and healed the inflamed knuckles, hoping that it wasn’t fractured.. </p><p>“That’s not true. I’m here and so is your sister. Mommy would be here if she wasn’t working.” </p><p>Tony paused. “And Daddy?”</p><p>“Him too!” Audrey said confidently. “If he could.” </p><p>Tony wasn’t sure if he could believe that. Daddy hadn’t been here, had never been here. </p><p>Audrey pouted angrily, unsure why her brother was thinking of that. Mommy had always told them that Daddy loved them, Mommy’s thoughts were always about him and them. “Don’t think that! He <em> does </em> love us. He loved Mommy lots.”</p><p>Tony looked at Credence. The man he looked up to like an older brother would be honest with him, right?</p><p>“I don’t know where he is or why he’s not here. I didn’t know your Mommy before she lived here,” Credence said, hugging both children. “But I know your Mommy loves you a lot and she wouldn’t lie!”</p><p>There wasn’t a moment where Credence had a strained expression on his face. He must have been thinking something not-nice, because—</p><p>“How can you think something like that?” You’d think Credence had called her something really mean, like freaky or crazy. Audrey couldn’t stand it when someone called her that. Audrey turned to Tony, as though expecting his support. “He thinks Mommy only thinks nice things about Daddy because she misses him.”</p><p>Tony wasn’t sure what to say back. Audrey had no doubts at all about Daddy, maybe because she could read Mommy’s mind. But it wasn’t that easy for Tony to believe.
