    <p>Thirty years into his twenty-fourth time loop, Lord Voldemort walked into a Muggle nightclub.</p><p>It had never been high on his list of priorities to visit a Muggle nightclub. In fact, on a list that ranged from achieving true immortality, in first place, to developing a counter curse for the runny nose jinx, in last place, visiting a Muggle nightclub wasn’t even a scrawl in the margins.     </p><p>But twenty-four lifetimes was a long time, twenty-three deaths at the hands of Harry Potter had taken the spark out of subjugating muggleborns or overthrowing governments, and there were only so many Saturday nights one could spend at home researching arcane magic before a little variety was in order.</p><p>And so, on June 26<sup>th</sup>, 2010, Lord Voldemort found himself pushing open the swinging glass door of a peeling brick, industrial-chic building named <em>MIRROR Lounge and Dance Club</em> in a hip district of London.</p><p>Inside, the club was dim and packed with bare-armed sweating bodies. Dance music pounded, conversation buzzed, and the feeble breeze of the air conditioner did little to penetrate the wafts of sticky heat. With a grimace, Lord Voldemort applied a cooling charm, an air freshening charm, and a muffling charm. Then he pushed through the tangle of limbs, claimed an empty metal stool at the bar, and waited for something to happen.</p><p>Surely something had to happen. Why else would the Muggles spend so much time here?</p><p>The pair of inebriated, tank-top-clad men to his right paid him no attention, proving Voldemort’s youthful disguise effective. He surveyed the room, noting that many men in the club appeared to be groping or kissing one another. He knew wizards occasionally engaged in such behavior, but so many in one place? It had to be some kind of new Muggle custom.</p><p>His thoughts were interrupted as a tall man in a button down shirt slid onto the unoccupied bar stool to his left. Lord Voldemort flicked his eyes over, sparing no more than a glance. Then an odd feeling of unease seized him, and he turned his head back to examine the man once more. Black hair. Green eyes. A bubble of laughter threatened to escape his lips.</p><p>What a perverse universe.</p><p>He turned his attention to the liquor bottles on display behind the bar, and waited to see how Harry Potter would kill him this time.</p><p>Potter tapped him lightly on the shoulder.</p><p>“Excuse me,” said Potter, but the sound was drowned out by the pounding bass of a Swedish dance hit. “Excuse me,” he tried again, this time shouting.</p><p>Lord Voldemort slowly turned his head to face Potter. Potter’s appearance matched his age – thirty-one – not that it mattered when Voldemort knew Potter was practically immortal. His countless ill-fated attempts on Potter’s life during previous time loops had proven that much.</p><p>“Yes?” replied Voldemort, unblinking.</p><p>Potter gave him a hesitant smile. “Are you waiting for someone?” Then, when the man thought Voldemort hadn’t heard him, he shouted, “Are you waiting for someone?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Potter smiled, appearing relieved. “Uh, in that case, can I buy you a drink?”</p><p>It had to be some kind of joke. Some kind of extremely sick and twisted joke. He considered apparating away, but in his experience, it wouldn’t make any difference. His first encounter with Potter in any time loop always marked the beginning of the end.</p><p>“Are you here to kill me?” he asked, voice devoid of emotion.</p><p>Potter’s smile was forced. “Uh… no?”</p><p>“Very well then. Buy me a drink, I don’t care.”</p><p>“Great.” Potter gave an awkward laugh. “That was a… a good joke.”</p><p>Voldemort blinked at him.</p><p>“So what kind of drink would you like?” asked Potter. When Voldemort didn’t respond, Potter passed him a menu. “I haven’t tried any of the house recommendations, but they do make a pretty good gin and tonic.”</p><p>“That one then.”</p><p>Potter smiled, again relieved, and caught the attention of the bartender. He ordered two gin and tonics.</p><p>“So…” said Potter, trailing off.</p><p>Voldemort stared at him.</p><p>“So,” said Potter. “Do you go to, ah, this kind of place, often?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Potter laughed. “Me neither.”</p><p>Voldemort wished the man would either kill him or leave.</p><p>Potter drummed his fingers on the polished bar top. With a distant look in his eyes, he spoke again. “This is actually my first time in a gay club.”</p><p>Voldemort blinked at that. Gay club? As in a club specifically for gay men? That explained a lot.</p><p>Potter glanced at him and sighed. “I’m completely botching this, aren’t I?”</p><p>A ghost of a smile played across Voldemort’s lips. “Well I’m still alive, so I’m not going to complain.”</p><p>Potter’s laugh this time was genuine.</p><p>“You’re nuts,” he said.</p><p>Voldemort ignored him, privately returning the sentiment. The bartender brought them their gin and tonics. Potter squeezed a wedge of lime over his drink, juice and pulp dribbling onto the ice, and stirred it with the straw, ice clinking.</p><p>“How did you find me?” asked Voldemort.</p><p>Potter stopped stirring and furrowed his brow. “Find you?”</p><p>Voldemort’s flicked his eyes to Potter. “Yes. Find me. Unless you want to claim you happened to visit this exact club, happened to see me here, and happened to approach me on a whim.”</p><p>Potter frowned. “Well, yeah, that’s pretty much exactly what happened.”</p><p>Voldemort’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>“Mate, I don’t even know who you are,” said Potter.</p><p>Voldemort snapped. Seized by irritation, he pierced Potter’s mind with a probe of legilimency. And encountered absolutely no resistance. The fool was thirty-one years old and hadn’t even learned occlumency. He supposed it made sense, considering there was no vengeful Dark Lord threatening him, but still. This had to be the most incompetent Potter yet.</p><p>What he did learn, however, was that Potter was telling the truth.</p><p>Potter blinked back stupidly, oblivious idiot that he was.</p><p>“Alright. I believe you,” said Voldemort. “How about we make an Unbreakable Vow in which you agree to never seek my death?”</p><p>At his words, Potter nearly fell out of his chair.</p><p>“What’s wrong with you?” asked Voldemort.</p><p>“Sorry,” said Potter, rebalancing himself. “Just. Something about your phrasing. Reminded me of something.”</p><p>“Do you have a problem with Unbreakable Vows?”</p><p>“No,” said Potter, laughing nervously. “Just forget about it.”</p><p>“They’re a fundamental part of the heritage of the Wizarding World.”</p><p>This time, Potter actually fell out of his chair.</p><p>When Potter finally picked himself up, he scanned the room and then leaned over to Voldemort, expression intense. “You’re a wizard?” he hissed.</p><p>“Obviously.”</p><p>Potter seemed to dissociate, staring at the wall behind the bar, before taking a deep breath and letting it out. “Wow, I just, well, what are the odds?”</p><p>“Higher than they should be, apparently.” Far, far higher. Potter had no idea.</p><p>“Maybe it’s fate,” said Potter.</p><p>Of course it was bloody fate.</p><p>“I mean, really,” continued Potter. “I called it quits on the gay wizard dating scene after only two weeks. That’s how long it took me to be introduced to every other uncoupled gay or bi wizard around my age. All nine of them. Come to think of it, I wonder why I didn’t meet you.” He cocked his head at Voldemort. “Unless you’re not, you know, open about it.”</p><p>Voldemort almost didn’t know how to respond to that. He wasn’t gay, he wasn’t seeking a relationship, he abhorred the very concepts of love and attachment, he’d spent the past thirty years avoiding Potter, and he most certainly wasn’t in Potter’s target age range.</p><p>“I don’t get out much.”</p><p>Potter smiled at that. “Me neither, to be honest. Work keeps me pretty busy.”</p><p>Voldemort wondered whether he was supposed to know what exactly Potter’s work entailed. He didn’t, but then again, he wasn’t lying about not getting out much. Legilimency provided the answer. This particular Potter was an international Quidditch star. They often were, when they grew up with two happy parents and no looming Dark Lord. How utterly tedious.</p><p>“Yes, I suppose it would,” said Voldemort.</p><p>“Not much of a Quidditch fan?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Potter smiled. “That’s probably for the best. Fans can be… intense.”</p><p>Ah yes. The Potter fan club, another delightful mainstay of his many time loops. It had a tendency to crop up even when Potter wasn’t hailed as the infant defeater of Voldemort. Which he hadn’t been for a long time: Voldemort had given up on trying to murder the infant Potter after the third loop, and given up on antagonizing Potter altogether after the sixth. The sixth Potter had been… different.</p><p>“Are you going to try your drink?” asked Potter. “You might like it, even if it doesn’t hold a candle to firewhiskey.” He grinned as if he’d just made the cleverest inside joke.</p><p>Voldemort grimaced. He abhorred drinking for much the same reason he abhorred love. It made barely tolerable people even worse.</p><p>Bearing in mind that the night was already a disaster, he took a sip. The taste was tangy, and it burned on the way down. He cast a sobering charm on himself.</p><p>“What the hell!” cried Potter.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“That was barely a sip!”</p><p>“And?”</p><p>“Have you ever had fun in your life?”</p><p>Voldemort frowned. He had, a few hundred mental years ago. Multiple times, even.</p><p>“That settles it. I’m not leaving you alone until you finish that. And no sobering charms either.”</p><p>Voldemort stared at him. “I believe you misunderstand the nature of our relationship.”</p><p>“Um?”</p><p>“We don’t have a relationship.”</p><p>“Ok?”</p><p>“That means you don’t tell me what to do.”</p><p>Potter blinked at him and sighed. “Just drink, mate.”</p><p>Half an hour later, Potter was piss drunk, and Voldemort was almost regretting his decision to remain sober.</p><p>“When Ginny left me… I was just… Fuck.” Potter was slumped over the bar, stirring the ice in an empty glass.</p><p>Voldemort nodded along. In twenty-four time loops, he’d never resorted to suicide. But that could change.</p><p>“Just… Fuck. Fucked up.”</p><p>“Go on. This is scintillating.”</p><p>“Ten years of marriage. Just. Fuck, mate. I don’t know.”</p><p>With what appeared to be herculean effort, Potter pulled his head off the bar top and swayed for a moment, only to slump against Voldemort’s shoulder. Voldemort seized the man by the face and pushed him back onto his stool. “Don’t do that again. Ever.”</p><p>He wondered whether casting a sobering charm on Potter could be construed as an act of aggression. By any sensible logic, it couldn’t. But one never knew when it came to Potter.</p><p>The man offered him a daft smile. “You know… I’m glad… We met.”</p><p>Suicide, then. The only question was how.</p><p>“I wasn’t sure if I wanted to come here tonight…” Potter continued. “Muggle club… Gay club… All that.”</p><p>Voldemort nodded. Could one cast the Killing Curse on oneself?</p><p>“But then I just… Thought of my life. Ginny… One year… She’s already moved on.”</p><p>But perhaps a self-directed Killing Curse would interfere with the ritual he’d used to keep sending his memories back in time.</p><p>“And I… I’m just. Day by day. Same shit. Never changes.”</p><p>It wasn’t as if he wanted to die completely. Just enough to return to a time when Potter hadn’t yet learned to vocalize.</p><p>“I’m stuck… Not happy… Not sad. Not enough to fix anything… The months just... Disappear.” Potter laughed.</p><p>Voldemort slid his eyes over to Potter. It would have to be Potter in the end. It was the only safe way to die.</p><p>“So I thought… Fuck… I have to… Something. Do something. Or I’ll wake up… Fifty years later. Look back… There won’t be anything. Nothing. Just the same shit. One long day. And this club. Meeting you… It’s something. It’s bloody something.” Potter’s eyes found his own, startling in their intensity. And very green.</p><p>Voldemort blinked.</p><p>With a flick of his wand, he cast a sobering charm on the other man. Potter snapped to attention and stared at Voldemort, comprehension dawning on his face.</p><p>“Fuck. Sorry,” said Potter.</p><p>Voldemort said nothing.</p><p>“I… I’ll be heading home now.”</p><p>Potter pushed his drink away and left a crumpled wad of Muggle money on the bar. Picked his coat off the barstool and slipped it on. Patted the wallet in his pocket. Then glanced back up at Voldemort.</p><p>“Yes?” said Voldemort quietly.</p><p>Potter closed his eyes. Opened them. Inhaled. Exhaled. “What’s your name?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“So I can owl you. Not that you ever want to hear from me again. But, you know, just in case.”</p><p>Voldemort paused. “Alexander Smith.”</p><p>Potter smiled. “Nice to meet you, Alexander. I’m Harry. But, er, you already knew that.”</p><p>And then he left.</p><p>Voldemort watched him go.</p>
