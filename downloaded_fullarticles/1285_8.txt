    <p align="justify">It had been over two months since the death of his godfather when Harry was finally allowed to visit 12 Grimmauld Place. Sirius had passed it on to Harry, this house, along with its memories – good and bad.</p><p align="justify">It felt off, not feeling Sirius’ presence there. At least not in corporal form. There would always be a part of Sirius within these walls, but not in the way Harry would ever be happy with. He would never see his face again, hear his honest advice or tell him his worst fears, earning him that sympathetic smile that told him ‘you’re right…’. Nothing would ever be the same.</p><p align="justify">Harry walked up the stairs to what used to be his godfather’s bedroom. He didn’t know if he was ready for it or not, but he knew he had to go there anyway.</p><p align="justify">As he opened the door, disappointment washed over him. Had he been expecting to see the man casually reading a book by his bed? At times he was reminded he was still a kid, and he had every right to be one. It didn’t make it any easier.</p><p align="justify">If he ever were to brew up Amortentia, this would be what it smelled like to him. Sirius’ scent. A hint of his favourite brand of firewhiskey, a hint of dog that had been happily revelling in the grass, and a hint of something musky that had stained various parts of Harry’s body several times (not enough times, he would tell you).</p><p align="justify">He walked towards the large bed, it was unmade – a legacy to Sirius’ slackness around this damned house. Kreacher would never bother with it unless specifically being told to, and you had to expect a nasty remark about blood-traitors. Harry touched the sheets, felt the lack of warmth. There had been months since the last time a body touched them. Slept on them. Writhed on them. He lay on the bed heavily, fighting the urge to cry. He had cried too much already. He had told himself he would be strong this time around, he wouldn’t taint Sirius’ smell with his tears.</p><p align="justify">He spread across the bed, grabbing hold of Sirius’ pillow. He closed his eyes and inhaled it. It was so faint. He couldn’t even tell if the scent he felt was real or just a pity gift from his imagination. He didn’t care to know the answer either. He opened his eyes and spotted a single hair lying on the pillow he was holding. It was long, dark and curly. Sirius’. Harry caught it between his fingers like it could run away. He twirled it around, staring at it. Perhaps the last piece of his godfather’s body he would ever set eyes on. He narrowed his eyes as an idea formed in his head.</p>
