    <p>With batted breath everybody present in the graveyard find themselves either looking at the cauldron in horror, expectation or hidden awe. Wormtail was near the cauldron while Harry was trap by the statue and the dead body of Cedric Diggory lies feat away from the scene. When the unexpected happened the liquid which were a diamond blue ravenously began to bubbled and the potion turning a deep red and then completely dark black but in the middle their were still a thin circle of dark red.</p><p>Wormtail cried out fearing that the potion failed and his master perished though there were an underlying sentiment of relief also. And out of the blues the middle where the red stain was, bursted and with a thundering clang the cauldron fell down spilling the dark liquid on the callous grey ground. In thick layer of liquid and the red that used to be in meridian of it whirlwind around the thick mass of potion and shortly after ripples of water appear at the centre and a mop of dark brown was seen.</p><p>The scene was like the potion was rejecting something... mostly someone.</p><p>Slowly a face was seen, then the shoulder, the chest and feet and as the dark substance threw the body out it stickied on the alabaster skin covering the slender but tall body like long second skin robe. But the robe was long enough to form a circle on the ground around the body.</p><p>Then a pair of beady eyes open, one of a vivid blood red more intense than the expelliarmus spell that Harry like to use frequently.</p><p>And soon Harryâ€™s heart leapt from his cage ribs and began to quicken fast enough that he thought that it would stopped anytime. The person was looking around confused only to frown and freezed when their eyes met again. And if Harry didn't knew better who was before him then undeniably he would have been sure that the quickening of his heart would be something else, something more intense and wonderful that is blooming at the only sight of the enchanting being before him but he know better that what he felt was fear and horror.</p><p>Oh how much was he wrong about it and too bad Harry Potter was currently too young to comprehend and put a name on the powerful feeling that is coursing through his body and mistook for adrenaline mixed with fear.</p>
