    <p>Remus hated working at the café, but it was really his only option. After all, who could afford college? Well, what queer kid with no family could afford college?</p><p>Not him, anyway. Didn’t matter, Remus thought to himself, and brought his attention back to the milk he was steaming. He switched off the steamer and poured the milk into the espresso he’d made just before. Moving more based on muscle memory than purpose, he slapped a lid on the cup and called out, “Latte for Emmaline.”</p><p>He set the drink on the pick-up counter and moved back to the register, where more empty cups labeled with people’s livelihoods awaited him. Taking the nearest one, he began brewing the three-shot cappuccino. <em>Someone needs the boost,</em> he thought with a slight smirk. Milk was under the steamer, and he had another going to make the foam. Once he’d gotten the foam settled, he turned off the steamer. Dump the espresso, add the milk, top with the foam…done. He checked the name again, did a double take to take in the name. He shrugged, added a lid, and called out: “Triple-shot cappuccino for Sirius!”</p><p>A lithe, ethereal man seemed to glide up to the counter. He grinned, and Remus could see the gray eyes shine silver with pleasure. He couldn’t breathe until after the man said, “Cheers, mate.”</p><p><em>Of course he had to have a British accent. Of fucking course. </em> And, of course, Remus couldn’t breathe until he’d walked away and out the door. His co-worker Lily had to call him back to do his job. Even then, his movements were zombie-like and he couldn’t shake it. <em>Fucking hell. </em></p><p>Remus’ workday was a blur of coffee, spills, and demands from old white people. After that, he found himself hoping he’d never see Sirius again and hoping he’d show up tomorrow at the same time.</p><p><em>Bastard…how the hell were you supposed to react when the man of your dreams stepped out of them and into the café? </em> Remus decided he was pissed as hell, considering he had no chance and no way of seeing him ever again. He was British—it was a fluke at best. He was even more annoyed when that broke his heart instead of making him feel better.<br/>
Alone at his tiny apartment, he was set in a state of melancholy. The melancholy wasn’t new, but it was due to a new reason. Somehow, it was worse than usual. Restlessness joined melancholy in a way he’d never felt before—something tugged at his soul to move, do something, anything. For the life of him, he couldn’t find anything to do. So he wandered between the two rooms of the apartment, trying to assure himself he wasn’t going insane. Finally, his phone went off.</p><p>“Hello? Hi. How are you? Um…who is this?”</p><p>“Remus, you okay?” Lily’s voice was a bit startled.</p><p>“What? Yeah, fine, why?”</p><p>“You just…you never talk that fast…” her voice trailed off.</p><p>“Don’t worry about it, just hyper for some reason. I don’t know what to do with all the energy,” he admitted.</p><p>“Oh,” the word was drawn out in understanding, “then you’ll actually hang out then! Get out of the apartment?”</p><p>“Well…” Remus hesitated; leaving the apartment seemed quite drastic.</p><p>“Come on!” Lily pleaded, “James is going to be there and he’s an ass. I need you to keep me from resorting to violence.”</p><p>“James? Really?” Remus frowned—the black-haired boy was a bit rambunctious for his tastes.</p><p>“Yeah, Marlene insists that we’d make a great couple—and she told him that too,” Lily sounded aggravated.</p><p>“Well, if you’re sure you need someone to keep you out of jail…” Remus felt himself give in for the first time.</p><p>“Thank you, Remus! Maybe if I tell him you’re my boyfriend, he’d back the fuck off!” Excitement filled her voice.</p><p>“Marlene knows we’re not dating, though,” Remus pointed out, grabbing his jacket.</p><p>“Shit,” she said, “then my best plan is having you get here ASAP.”</p><p>“Leaving now,” he told her, “I’m only three stops away.”</p><p>“Thank God for New York’s subway system! See you soon!”</p><p>“See you,” he hung up, locked the door, and managed to get to the Subway stop without panicking. Crowds were never pleasant but being in his apartment all night suddenly felt too closed in, too completely empty and unbearable. For once, Remus actively decided to be around people instead of alone with his thoughts, his books he’d saved for each month. Poe, Shakespeare, and Shelley couldn’t soothe him tonight. The soft words from old writers would be repulsive tonight—he needed noise, needed people he could see instead of dream. Maybe once he had the alcohol Lily invariably stocked, he’d be able to admit that he’d spent far too much time alone, even though he preferred it most of the time. Maybe he’d be able to admit that the energy came from wanting to seek out Sirius, to chase him to the ends of the earth and—</p><p><em>And what, exactly? Ride off into the sunset on a white stallion together? </em> Luckily, he’d dreamed long enough to get off the subway, and out into the streets again during the lively, early evening of the Big Apple. Navigating easily, he got up the steps, found Lily’s apartment number, and pressed the appropriate buzzer—he hoped.</p><p>“Yeah?” When he heard the vaguely familiar female voice, Remus breathed out with relief.</p><p>“Hey, Marlene, it’s Remus.”</p><p>“Oh, hey! Come on up, honey! Glad you made it,” the click accentuated her welcome, and Remus pushed inside and took the steps two and a time. Walking quickly, he rapped on number 354.</p><p>Within three seconds, James opened the door with a joyful <em>hello, how are you?</em> Remus gave a quick greeting and slipped inside, where Lily and Marlene’s weekly Friday Game Night was in full swing.</p><p>“We need a sixth for Resistance,” James said, passing him a beer.</p><p>“Sounds good,” Remus decided, then turned towards the table.</p><p>He saw the same black hair, place skin, and sharp jawbones; Sirius was laughing at something Dorcas said. He sat next to Lily, leaving an open seat beside him and one next to that. James snagged the seat next to him, and Remus resented it immediately.<br/>
He glugged some beer to calm himself, and nearly steadied his breathing. <em>Who needs air anyway?</em></p><p>“Hey,” he said, sliding into the seat.</p><p>“Hey, Remus!” Lily leaned over and kissed his cheek in greeting.</p><p>“You came!” Dorcas clapped.</p><p>“He did,” Marlene grinned at her girlfriend.</p><p>“Your name is Remus?” the classic, clipped British accent filled his ears and head. Jesus, he didn’t need the beer to get drunk. He just needed to hear that voice again.</p><p>After a long pause, he nodded, “Long time no see.” When Sirius laughed, he felt he’d accomplished everything possible in his life.</p><p>“We saw each other this afternoon,” Sirius explained, “he gave me my beloved coffee. Therefore, I owe him the world.” Remus’ heart stopped. <em>I’m in so much trouble.</em></p><p>“I’d settle for a grand in cash,” he managed to quip. And his heart stopped again when Sirius threw his head back and barked out another laugh.</p><p>“Well, that’s that—I’m broke for the rest of my days,” the Brit’s silver eyes gleamed appreciatively.</p><p>“That’ll teach you not to owe people the world,” James pointed at Sirius playfully.</p><p>“Okay, how do you two know each other?” Marlene sipped her drink and smirked, which Remus thought shouldn’t be possible.</p><p>“I’ve got family in London,” James said.</p><p>“You’re Indian,” Lily said, frowning.</p><p>“Half Indian, half imperialist,” James corrected with a grin, “went to elementary school in England before my parents moved here for work. We manage to go to either India or England in the summers, and that’s how I managed to stay brothers with Sirius.”</p><p>“Brothers?” Remus couldn’t help asking.</p><p>“This chap has known me since we were in nappies,” Sirius said, “we were neighbors until he abandoned me.”</p><p>“Abandoned you,” James rolled his eyes.</p><p>“You <em>did</em>, left me alone to die in primary school, no less.” Sirius took another drink while James shook his head.</p><p>“It wasn’t my fault!” he said defensively, “And this is the first and only time you’ve visited me, so I think we’re even.”</p><p>“There you have a point, mate.”</p><p>“I didn’t realize you weren’t born in America,” Lily said slowly.</p><p>“Doesn’t really come up, and I’ve lost the accent for the most part. Comes out a bit when this ass is around.” James threw an arm around Sirius’ shoulders.</p><p>“It’s for the best, really,” Sirius claimed, “it’s the only way a Yank, or any girl would have you.”</p><p>James laughed as his arm tightened around Sirius’ neck playfully. Remus looked to Lily, curious. She seemed pensive, hands wrapped around her cup, and head tilted slightly. Remus surmised she was rethinking James. She’d determined that he was an ass, but he seemed…different with Sirius. Maybe he brought out a better side to the James she complained was too flirty, all surface-level with no substance to hold it up. Maybe, Remus considered as he sipped, Sirius showed Lily who James was when he wasn’t being a flirty jackass—that he was more than that. What would Sirius bring out in him when he was around.</p><p>“Remus,” Dorcas sang, “Earth to Remus.”</p><p>“What?” He jerked back to reality.</p><p>“Pick a damn card, dreamer.”</p><p>“Oh,” he reached forward and plucked one from the remaining four. Cupping his hand around it, he took a quick glance. He wasn’t a spy, thank God, and would have to search one out this game. He felt the relief—he didn’t have the brains to bluff as a spy in the midst of the missions. He watched as Sirius was chosen for the first two missions along with James, and then James and Lily accompanied him. The second mission failed—and thus began the accusations.</p><p>“It’s not me,” Lily snapped fiercely.</p><p>“I’m just saying,” James said, “the first mission was fine with Sirius!”</p><p>“I think it’s Sirius,” Remus took a sip of beer as silence coated the table.</p><p>“What?” James looked at him like he’d lost his mind.</p><p>“Sirius has been on both, and anyone who’s played this game knows that as a spy, you let the first mission succeed. Then you sabotage, and let people argue over which one of the three it is while defending your own ‘honor’.”</p><p>“Is that so? We must play it differently in England,” Remus watched a slow smile slide across Sirius’ face.</p><p>“I doubt that,” Lily said, raising her eyebrows.</p><p>“I don’t,” James crossed his arms.</p><p>“Then it’s either you or Lily,” Remus pointed out.</p><p>“It’s not me,” Lily stated, “must be you, then, Potter.”</p><p>“No! It’s got to be you, <em>Evans</em>.” Remus let the accusations flow around him once more, and noted, to his dismay, he would be picking the next team.</p><p>“Ultimately, it’s Remus you have to convince,” Marlene finally cut in.</p><p>“Is it?” Sirius looked back at him, and Remus’ heart stuttered again. He cursed it inwardly.</p><p>“As I’m picking the next team, yeah,” he confirmed.</p><p>“Then it’ll be your job to assign me immediately,” the silver eyes were solemn, but…</p><p>“No,” he heard his voice and wondered if he’d ever sounded so damned foolish.</p><p>“What,” Sirius’ smile dropped.</p><p>“I’m picking myself, Lily, and Marlene.”</p><p>“Lily?” James exclaimed it.</p><p>“Yes,” Remus met James’ gaze steadily, “Lily. I trust her much more than I trust you.”</p><p>“You’ve known me longer!”</p><p>“Exactly,” Remus tossed the appropriate tokens in the center while the table erupted with laughter.</p><p>After protests from James, Sirius, and surprisingly Dorcas (“I want to go on a mission! Why can’t <em>I</em> go?”) the mission was voted through and succeeded. Marlene gave Remus a considering look, paused for a silent moment, and dramatically announced that the same three do the next mission as well. Remus shut down Sirius’ outbursts with a quick: “Are you so sure that James isn’t the spy?”</p><p>“I—” Sirius looked taken aback, “I’m not talking about James, am I?”</p><p>“No, but if we were to trust you, we’d have to trust James. Both of you would play the same strategy.”</p><p>“Based on what?” Sirius’ insult carried over James’ sputtering that he wasn’t from the Empire.</p><p>“Based on the two of you being brothers in all but blood,” Remus sipped his beer calmly, though he felt no aspect of that calm inside. Sirius seemed to have no repartee to that, and neither did James. Dorcas looked frustrated with her lips pursed and brow furrowed but said nothing.</p><p>“So, votes in,” Marlene broke the silence.</p><p>When the spies failed in the end, it came to be time to weed out the spies.</p><p>“Obviously,” James began, “I, Sirius, Lily, Remus, and Marlene are not spies—”</p><p>“We don’t know about Sirius,” Remus interrupted, “he didn’t go on missions after the second. You passed because it was either you or Dorcas, and we felt sorry for you.”</p><p>“I’m quite trustworthy, thank you,” Sirius set his cup on the table sharply.</p><p>“Why wasn’t I included, James?” Dorcas glared.</p><p>“You didn’t go on any missions.”</p><p>“That wasn’t my fault!”</p><p>“I think the two spies are Dorcas and Sirius,” Remus’ quiet tone managed to stop the bickering for a moment.</p><p>“What,” Dorcas gritted her teeth, “the <em>hell</em>.”</p><p>“You never went, and the missions succeeded,” Remus raised his voice, “and after Sirius was exiled, no failures occurred. That’s what we have to go on.” Silence fell as Remus spoke.</p><p>“You’re right,” Lily said, “it’s Dorcas and Sirius.”</p><p>“Fuck, mate,” James looked at Sirius.</p><p>“Agreed,” Marlene said reluctantly.</p><p>“DAMMIT!” Sirius threw his red card on the table, disgusted.</p><p>“Fuck you, Remus,” Dorcas sulked immediately.</p><p>“WE WON!” James leapt up and did what Remus could only term a jig.</p><p>“Settle down, idiot, <em>Remus</em> won the game,” Lily leaned back with a grin.</p><p>“It’s true,” Marlene laughed, “we did shit.”</p><p>“Team effort,” James insisted.</p><p>“I don’t want the credit,” Remus couldn’t help grinning, “let’s just play something else now.”</p><p>“Truth or Drink,” Marlene jabbed a finger in the air. “We’re playing Truth or Drink.”</p><p>There was really nothing to do but go along with it.</p>
