    <p>"What are you up to, pretty little jewel?" came a question behind Rita that made her jump. Bellatrix never seemed to make any noise when she came up behind people. Rita tried to ignore Bellatrix peering over her shoulder.</p><p>"None of your business until it's published," she snapped.</p><p>"Oh, now I don't think that's the right answer," Bellatrix cooed. She swiped Rita's notes, shoving her back into her chair as she tried to decipher the code Rita was using. Rita sprung out of her chair again, wrenching her notes out of Bellatrix's hand. She laid them on the table, sticking her finger in Bellatrix's face.</p><p>"Hands off my work," Rita demanded. </p><p>"Or what?" Bellatrix dared. There were few students left in the common room that late, but they were starting to file out of the room, more than acquainted with Bellatrix's temper. Even Andromeda, who had been studying as Bellatrix boredly asked her questions, started to make her way upstairs, shooting the pair a wary glance.</p><p>"Or I'll ruin you," Rita threatened. Bellatrix scoffed.</p><p>"Ruin me? You think you can ruin the eldest Black heir? And how would you do that?" Bellatrix asked amusedly. Rita Summoned copies of some statements and pictures she had, shoving them into Bellatrix's hands.</p><p>"Do you think Rodolphus will still be eager to marry you when he finds out you've slept through half the class?" Rita asked, smug as she watched Bellatrix look over what she had. "I Charmed the parchment and the people who told me what they knew might have drunk some Veritaserum, so they couldn't have lied." She was delighted by the growing rage on Bellatrix's face, the thin line of her pursed lips.</p><p>"You think I care about Roddy?" Bellatrix bit out.</p><p>"I think you care about his money, and I think Cygnus and Druella have exceedingly high expectations concerning their daughters not being sluts," Rits replied. Bellatrix was nearly shaking from anger. She tore apart the copies, setting the pieces on fire before shoving the tip of her wand into Rita's neck.</p><p>"You won't dare share that information. What happens within the halls of Hogwarts doesn't leave them," Bellatrix managed slowly through gritted teeth.</p><p>"Doesn't it?" Rita replied.</p><p>"You share those, your Animagus status gets outed," Bellatrix threatened. Rita had known it would come to this.</p><p>"Then I suppose we're at an impasse," Rita said coolly.</p><p>"I don't think so. You face a fine for your deed, and I face Banishment for mine," Bellatrix snarled, still boiling with anger.</p><p>"For your many many deeds," Rita replied, taking a step forward. She was flirting with death and it was exhilarating.</p><p>"I won't let you ruin me," Bellatrix told her. She replaced her wand with her hand gripping tight around Rita's neck. Immediately, Rita's hands came up, trying to dislodge the hand strangling her and push away Bellatrix. But it was useless. Bellatrix squeezed until Rita nearly passed out, letting up so that Rita could drop to her knees, coughing and sputtering and gasping for air as she massaged her throat. Bellatrix looked at her, an eyebrow raised as she waited for Rita to beg for her forgiveness. Rita finally looked up at her, still coughing.</p><p>"I'm keeping what I found," she managed hoarsely, glaring up at Bellatrix. It was not what Bellatrix had expected from someone she had come so close to killing, but despite herself, she was impressed that Rita was so determined. She was elevating herself to a worthy adversary rather than a simple nuisance.</p><p>"Keep it to yourself," Bellatrix snapped before spinning on her heel, heading for the dormitory.</p><p>"You know, they said you were violent in bed too," Rita called after her, a last show of bravado. The statement made Bellatrix half turn toward her.</p><p>"They asked me to be. Begged me. Much like you are now, on your knees. Are you just trying to nose out the competition and shame them out of the game, little jewel? I can smell you from here," Bellatrix spat before she left, leaving Rita embarrassed on the floor of the common room until she had caught her breath.</p>
