    <p>Spring 1994 - May 2, 1998</p><p>The thing Hermione hated about the strings was that they were paradoxically both invisible and red. If one cast the spell to reveal one’s string, it would reveal that string to be simultaneously both red and invisible. Wizard scholars did not seem to think this was a paradox to be explored, but most wizard scholars are not Hermione Granger.</p><p>When she read ahead in Divination in early spring, she was convinced that she must be missing something. How could the threads of fate showing the soulmate connection be both a color and not visible? She brought it up the next morning at breakfast.</p><p>“But, Ron, how can it be both a color in the visible spectrum and outside the visible spectrum? It can’t be both!”</p><p>Ron was shoving scrambled eggs into his mouth. “Gor, Huhhmmmuu dofv iii mahhuhh?”</p><p>Ginny smacked Ron in the arm. “Stop trying to talk while you eat, git.”</p><p>After a long swallow, Ron repeated himself. “Hermione, does it really matter? I mean, it’s magic. It doesn’t make sense all the time.”</p><p>Harry shrugged. “I get it, Hermione, but it is for Divination. Nothing in that class really makes any sense, does it?”</p><p>Hermione rolled her eyes. “You are the one who took the Grim so seriously.”</p><p> </p><p>When they finally covered the subject in class, Hermione of course became incensed (no pun intended) by Professor Trelawney’s ethereal explanation.</p><p>“My dear, I’m sure that if you ever manage to see your string, you will understand how it can be both red and invisible…”</p><p>Hermione shook and screamed in her head briefly before collecting herself and trying the incantation and complex wandwork for herself.</p><p>“<em>Ostende Filum</em>.” She twirled her wand in the conical spiral and stabbed forward.</p><p>Nothing happened. Nothing happened for anyone in the room for the rest of class, either. It left Hermione further convinced that Divination was all garbage.</p><p>Professor Trelawney explained that if one did see their string, they might not be able to do anything about it. Anything obstructing the string would have to be resolved before one could continue on to find their soulmate. Knots or loops around something meant that there was something preventing one or the other soulmate from being together. If the string went through something solid, the soulmates might never be together. It would take the literal destruction of that solid object for the two to be together.</p><p> </p><p>For the next several weeks, Hermione practiced <em>Ostende Filum</em> continually, to no effect. She found herself muttering it to herself under her breath as she could not master it. She heard that other classes had only one or two students who could get it to work. There must be additional requirements that were unstated, like maybe it only worked once you started to have feelings for your soulmate? Or maybe they were all too young to get the spell to work? Or maybe it was just a garbage spell that would never work, except for the people who like Prof Trelawney, were “gifted” with the ability to see bullshit.</p><p>She stopped bringing up the paradoxical nature of the “red” “invisible” strings when Ron pointed out that she also had a bit of a paradox going where she was scheduled for two classes at once half a day every day.</p><p>She dropped the subject completely on the day she slapped Draco Malfoy in the face and quit Divination forever.</p><p>As she was storming out of Divination, angrily climbing down the rope ladder, she cursed softly to herself. “Bloody awful nonsense. Who even wants to know about something like a soulmate or predicting the future? I know the future. It’s a lot of bloody hard work.”</p><p>She clutched her wand and stomped off down the hall to find Prof McGonagall to update her schedule and explain that she had missed a class. She repeated that mantra she had kept in her head for weeks, out of habit and anger. <em>Ostende Filum… Ostende Filum… Ostende Filum… “Ostende Filum…”</em></p><p>And suddenly she could see her string. It bloody well was red, and fucking invisible.</p><p>This was, of course, much more interesting than going to see McGonagall. It retracted slowly as she followed it up and down the stairs and around the halls.</p><p>She followed it up to the fourth floor where it was knotted in a huge ball around the handle of the door to the library.</p><p>Hermione thought that if she could not be with her soulmate because of the library, that was a good tradeoff. She turned away and finally went to find McGonagall.</p><p> </p><p>She rarely thought of the invisible red string, although it did come up occasionally.</p><p>Fourth year when Viktor mooned around her while she studied, she wondered if this was what it would be like when she found her soulmate. She cast <em>Ostende Filum</em> again. It was still tangled up with the library. If someone like Viktor, who valued her intelligence was not the right person for her, who could be? She enjoyed his company and vowed to keep in touch with him. If she never found her soulmate, she would be lucky to have Viktor.</p><p>Sixth year when Ron and Lavender snogged all over the castle without trying to keep anything private, she finally admitted to herself that she did want that. She wanted to be not just the girl who spent all her time in the library. She wanted to be just a girl. She wanted to be seen by a boy. She wanted to lose herself snogging all over the castle. One day in early May after Ron and Lavender broke up and she was feeling especially hopeful, she cast <em>Ostende Filum</em> in the library. It was no longer tangled there! </p><p>Hermione followed the string out into the hall and around the castle until it went through a wall on the seventh floor. It felt oddly final to her. She would simply not get to have that soulmate relationship. She would either be alone or settle for something besides the wizarding ideal of a relationship. She supposed she would get used to it.</p><p>For the next year, Hermione felt closer and closer to Ron. Her heart broke when he left them in the middle of horcrux hunting. Her heart felt full when he came back. When they destroyed Hufflepuff’s Cup, Hermione clutched him for dear life and kissed him like his lips would keep away the darkness that had surrounded her for so long. This was real, and those paradoxical strings were misleading. She had Ron, and she had worked to get him, right? That was what a partnership really was.</p><p>As they ran back up to the Room of Requirement, Hermione noticed at last that her string’s dead-end was one of the walls that made up the Room of Requirement. She had the sudden mad thought that whatever happened next, that wall would not survive. That thought was followed by the fear that her kiss with Ron would be their first and last kiss.</p><p>After the battle, after Harry was the Boy-Who-Lived-Again, after Voldemort finally really truly died, Hermione found herself wandering the castle in a daze. She had to know before everything was rebuilt, before everything changed, before she changed. She had to know if her string was free now. She had to know if she had a chance to meet her soulmate.</p>
