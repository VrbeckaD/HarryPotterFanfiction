    <p>Harry’s feet felt like lead as he crept down the hallway from his “bedroom” on the second floor to the stairs. He was careful as he walked down the stairs avoiding the third to the bottom, knowing from experience, that it would creak loud enough for the high heavens to hear him moving around. He had snuck down the last few nights, slowly moving his stuff up to his room and back into his trunk where he could easily escape with it. Tonight, his goal was his Advanced Potionmaking book, the last book in his collection that he would need for the coming year. Following the end of the war, McGonagall had decided to offer all of the seventh years a chance to do their whole year over again since much of their education was disrupted by the battle.</p><p>In addition to this being his last year at Hogwarts, it was the year of Harry’s seventeenth birthday making him an adult in the magical community. He could finally be rid of his horrid relatives and be free to live. He had also thought what he was going to do after school, the war had left him with a lot of scars that he wasn’t sure he’d want to have to relive everyday as an Auror. But, since he had never known the wizarding community when it wasn’t at war, he wasn’t really sure what other jobs there would be out there for him to hold. He wanted a chance to help the wizarding world rebuild especially after being the main cause of much of the devastation. He had to pull his mind away from the rabbit hole of despair that surely awaited him if he tried to think of all the damage that he had caused.</p><p>He winced as he almost missed a step being deep in thought and had to tense up his muscles at the last second. He stopped for a second to lean on the wall as he could feel the wounds on his back reopen from the tearing, the shirt he was wearing absorbing as much as it could. He knew he had to move quickly before any of the blood dripped on the floor. His uncle had torn apart his back earlier in the day when he had found a spot of mud on the shoes he had demanded Harry clean. Harry winced again, remembering the sting of the metal of the belt buckle as it collided with his spine, the bones sticking out from being severely underfed. </p><p>Finally reaching the small cupboard, he took out his wand that he had taken on his first escapade down the stairs, he unlocked the multitude of locks is uncle had put on the door, reaching inside for his book before closing the door and putting the locks back on. He crept back up the stairs, peering down the long hallway to his uncle’s room before going over to his door, a sigh of relief on his lips. That sigh disappeared as he entered his room to see his uncle sitting on his bed. </p><p>Harry tried to back out of the room, tried shutting the door before his uncle could get to him, but before he could, a foot was placed in the door to stop it from closing and the door was yanked open, pulling Harry into the room with it. He yelped as he collided with the bed frame, hitting his head. He quickly turned around to come face to face with a very angry Uncle Vernon. He clutched his book and his wand close to his chest as his uncle towered over him.</p><p>“I bet you thought you were so clever, didn’t you? Sneaking out of your room every night when you thought we were asleep, trying to get back all your freak shit.” Vernon was almost vibrating with how angry he was, his face red and his hands in tightly clenched fists. Harry knew that if he answered now, his punishment would increase ten-fold so he stayed silent, shaking as he tried to press himself as deep into the mattress as he could. “But, I knew. Knew all along what you were up to, I thought I might humor you until you started to get a nice collection, it’s really too bad.” The grin on Uncle Vernon’s face couldn’t be anything but evil as he looked over Harry’s shoulder. Harry turned to see what his uncle was so happy about, and felt despair wash through him as he saw that all his rescued objects had been burned. All that was left was a bag of ashes that sat on his bed where his trunk had been. Harry cried out, all his stuff was gone, the only link to any kind of love he had ever had, any kind of family was gone, burned.</p><p>Uncle Vernon took advantage of the boy’s despair to grab him by the shoulders and turn him around to face him. He reached down, grabbing Harry’s potions book out of his arms. He opened the book, and right before the eyes of the sobbing savior, tore every page out of its binding, crumpling them up into small paper balls and dropping them at his feet. Once he was satisfied with the state of the book, he reached down for Harry’s wand.</p><p>On instinct, Harry pulled away from the older man’s grubby hands. He immediately realized his mistake when a second later his uncles face twisted into a vicious sneer.</p><p> “You think you can get away from me? Think you can save your precious stick from me? Ha!” Vernon grabbed the piece of wood from the trembling boy’s hands, waving it in front of his face tauntingly before snapping the wand in half and throwing the pieces onto the pile forming at his feet. Harry felt the pulse of magic from the breaking wand, felt it hit him full force as all the magic in that wand was thrown out. He cried out in pain, from the pulse of magic and from losing his wand. Without his wand, he couldn’t be a wizard, he was truly nothing now. Uncle Vernon continued cackling above him, roughly pulling Harry to his feet before pushing him back onto the bed. “You have no power left you little freak, nothing to defend yourself with and no way to get revenge. Any leverage you held over us has just been destroyed, any fear we had of you is gone now.” Vernon leaned over Harry, bending over to whisper in his ear. “If you thought it was bad before, you are about to enter a whole new world of pain, now we know you won’t hurt us.” Vernon cackled again as he felt the smaller boy start to tremble underneath him. Harry heard the sound of belt being unbuckled as he was turned onto his stomach. He heard the air whistle and the metal belt buckle was brought down on his back. He bit his lip, trying to resist crying out, until he tasted blood on his tongue.</p><p>This torture went on for what felt like hours, and it was finished with Harry laying bleeding on his bed and Vernon yelling at him to clean up this whole mess or else. He never needed to finish his threats for Harry to understand how serious the consequences would be if it wasn’t done. He crawled across the blood and ash covered mattress to reach his alarm clock, seeing it was almost midnight. It was almost his seventeenth birthday. Before he had looked forward to his birthday, when he could finally be free, but now he saw that was just a pipe dream. He would never be free of this place, or of these people, it was his fate to suffer forever it seemed. Finally, the clock struck midnight and his thoughts seemed only confirmed when as soon as the day had changed, immense pain shook his body, changing him as he passed out, hoping for the relief of sleep.</p><p>While the boy savior was sleeping through his transformation, in a manor in the hills, fated match, had no such luck.</p><p> Draco Malfoy had been having a decent enough summer. The Dark Lord was finally gone, and his father had miraculously stayed out of Azkaban as had his mother. It was nice to have a family again, to feel safe in one’s home again. Early on in the summer his parents had told him about the heritage he would be receiving, passed down from his father to him, a veela. Draco was very excited to become a veela but also very nervous. His father had told him about having a mate, one person gifted to you by Lady Fate to be your perfect match, unless one of the pair couldn’t accept the bond. Then, rejection would eat away at the body of the rejected while the other mate was free to live their life as planned, but they would be unable to have any meaningful relationship with anyone else, ever.</p><p>This scared Draco since he was sure, whoever his mate was, was going to reject him. He had spent the rest of the summer until his birthday reading as much as he could about the transformation into a veela and what rejection was like, just so he might be prepared for the inevitable. It was deeply saddening to his father when he told Lucius why he had been asking for more books. He told Draco,</p><p> “Your mate is destined for you, perfect for you in every way, no matter whether you can see it or not. Only a fool would reject their mate, and no one is going to reject you simply because of your past mistakes.” Draco had not been satisfied with his father’s logic.</p><p>“But father, what if its someone from school. Or someone from the war, what if they remember all the evil things I’ve done, all the destruction I brought, all the deaths I caused. Oh god, what if I killed someone my mate loved, they would surely reject me for that.” Draco had taken to pacing around the room, a nervous habit that he had never grown out of. His father sighed and rose from his place behind the large desk that took up most of the office that they had been talking in. He walked around and embraced his anxious son in a tight hug, something he didn’t do often. Lucius could smell how distressed his child was becoming and it was filling the room with a putrid smell like sulfur. They stood there for a while, Draco wrapped in his father’s arms, until the horrid smell died away and he felt much calmer. He extracted himself from his father’s arms, smiling up at the older man.</p><p>“Thank you, father.” Draco left the room quickly, in a hurry to get back to his reading, leaving his father smiling in the middle of his office before sitting back down behind the desk, the room finally clearing of the distressed smell. Draco made quick work of the maze-like hallways in the manor, back up to the library where he had an extensive collection of books sprawled out across three tables he had pushed together to make a gigantic research table. There was one chair at the head of the table that had a notebook placed in front of it with a small collection of multi-colored pens that he had been using to take notes as he came across new information, each page in the notebook filled with Draco’s small, intricate, script.</p><p>He had been trying to take as many notes as possible, he wanted to be as knowledgeable about what he was going to go through as he could be. He also wanted to be able to explain what he was, just in case his mate turned out to be not a veela or didn’t know that much about them he wanted to play it safe. However, as the days folded into one another the reality of what was coming upon him seemed to set in within Draco. And as the days got closer and closer Draco seemed to more and more on edge, he even growled at his father when he had tried to tell him to clean up his nest of books. His father just sighed, shaking his head with a small smile gracing his usually stoic face.</p><p>Draco’s birthday finally arrived and it brought with it, a night of excruciating pain, his bones shifting, reforming, changing as his back split open to reveal glorious dark green wings with silver feathers that spread out to reach a span of 18 feet, a clear sign of a dominant veela. Draco cried out as the pain shot through him in waves, completely overwhelming him as he thrashed around trying to contain his emerging beast. After several hours of pain, Draco finally fell victim to the lull of sleep.</p><p>The next morning Harry woke up in more pain than he had ever felt before. The blood had dried from the night before and when he tried to sit up, he felt as though there was a huge weight attached to his back making it difficult to sit up. He finally reached for his glasses pulling them up his nose before pulling himself out of the bed, feeling the weight drag across the floor as he moved out to the bathroom. As he flicked on the small light, he gasped as he looked at what had happened to him. His face had changed, softened into a more circular form, more closely resembling a women’s features. He had small silver wings with dark green feathers that looked to span about 8 feet. He panicked, he needed to put his wings away before any of the Dursley’s woke up.</p><p><em>Fold, fold or collapse or something please!</em> He pleaded with whoever might be listening to help him. His prayers, for once, seemed to be answer as the wings disappeared into his back. He cleaned up his room as quickly as he could, tears streaming down his face as he threw away his book pages, his broken wand pieces, and the ashes of what used to be all his magical items. He quickly took out the bag with the garbage, throwing it outside, bidding his belongings a final goodbye before heading back inside to make breakfast.</p><p>Harry was almost done with the pancakes when he heard his uncle coming down the stairs, tensing his shoulders and his uncle entered the kitchen. He flipped the last pancake, putting it on Dudley’s plate before taking Uncle Vernon’s plate over to him. Vernon gave no acknowledgement of Harry’s presence, taking his fork and stabbing the first pancake. Harry turned back around, going to grab Petunia and Dudley’s plates when Vernon barked at him from the table.</p><p>“Boy, come over here and <strong><em>bring me some coffee right now</em></strong>.” Harry wasn’t sure what happened but he felt immediately compelled to do it. He dropped the plates he had been holding and felt his body move without his violation to grab the coffee pot and pour his dumbfounded uncle. “What the hell was that?” His uncle growled at him, making Harry bow his head in submission.</p><p>“I’m sorry sir, I don’t know what came over me.” Harry’s not sure where the sir came from or why it felt like it just belonged in his speech pattern, but it did. Vernon hit harry over the head with his rolled newspaper.</p><p>“You better <strong><em>pick up those plates</em></strong> –.” Before Uncle Vernon could give any more directions Harry immediately turned to doing what his uncle commanded him. His uncle passed, giving Harry a curious look. “<strong><em>Face me.</em></strong>” Uncle Vernon barked out another command, making Harry turn around glass shards in his hands, head bowed once again, in complete submission. Understanding seemed to dawn on Uncle Vernon’s face as he almost realized what had happened to his nephew. “Your freak nature must have done this.” Vernon mused aloud. “Looks like they finally did something useful with all that stupid ‘magic’ junk. This is going to be very fun.” Vernon’s face contoured into a cruel smirk as he rose out his chair, towering over the shrunken boy, filling Harry with a sense that last night, might just be the first of many oncoming nights that ended with him, passed out in pain.</p>
