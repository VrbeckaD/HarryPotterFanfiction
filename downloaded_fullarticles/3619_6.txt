    <p>Gray's POV<br/>Celestial world</p>
<p>For the first time in his life he stood before the Spirit King. He heard about the King before from Loke. The king was the one who all the spirits obeyed. He was neutral to the wars of man. To be summoned usually meant trouble. With what had happened recently he knew that this was true for him.</p>
<p>The King was pacing in front of him and if he was honest with himself. It was making him nervous. Finally as if making his decision the King turned. An angry look in his eyes.</p>
<p>He growled," Celestrial Spirit Lupus the 13th Zodiac."</p>
<p>He bowed his head and said calmly," Spirit King you summoned me."</p>
<p>"I did. It seems you have followed in Leo's footsteps. Unlike him though i cannot banish you from this realm. It was never your home to begin with."</p>
<p>Gray flinched. The cruel words were true. Unlike other Celestrial spirits he was not from the Celestrial World. He came from Earth and had been chosen by the Celestrial Spirit Lupus when he almost died. He was the darkness while Loke was the light.</p>
<p>His thoughts were interrupted by the Spirit King's next words," I cannot allow you to roam any longer in Fiore. You are a danger to Celestrial wizards and you never belonged to that Earth."</p>
<p>Wait what?! He never belonged to his home?</p>
<p>He asked feeling hysterics bubbling in his chest," What do you mean? Why do I not belong in Fiore?"</p>
<p>A strange look appeared on the Spirit King's face. It was not one he was familiar with. Almost as if he knew something Grey didn't.</p>
<p>"You were not born in that Earth you called home. You were sent there though a rare form of magic. On the mountains not far from the Fullbuster home is where you appeared. I shall send you back to where you came from. Where you can no longer harm the wizards gifted with Celestrial Magic."</p>
<p>He wanted to argue but the Spirit King's magic envelopes him. A white blinding light and he knew no more.</p>
<p>Regulus' POV</p>
<p>There were some days he hated his job as an Unspeakable. Today was one of those days. It had been 14 years since his Lord's victory to the day. Normally they would be celebrating. Instead he had to go to Gordric's Hollow for strange magical readings. It was bloody cold for October 31st.</p>
<p>He made his way closer to the Potter's old house. Everyone knew the story. Their Lord had gone to kill the Potter's the last members of the resistance led by Dumbledore. When he killed them a blinding light had taken their only child. A boy by the name of Harry Potter. No one had seen hide or tail of the child since. The prophecy had long since been ruled a fake. The main reason the Lord had gone to kill them.</p>
<p>If most wizards were honest with themselves they would say their world had been improved. Old laws had been changed. Muggle born children were realized that they were from squib children. This led to improvements of lives of squibs. Allowing them to stay in the world and making jobs for them.</p>
<p>His attention was drawn to a figure laying in the leaves. Likely the cause for the magical disturbance. The figure looked no older than fifteen. Hair jet black almost the same color as the night sky. Pulling his wand free he cautiously approached.</p>
<p>The boy groaned sitting up rubbing at his head. He looked around confused as he asked," Where am I? Damn it."</p>
<p>He stood unsteady glancing around until his eyes fell on Regulus. Green killing curse eyes met grey. Regulus felt his eyes widen in shock. There had only been one person he saw with such eyes. Lilly Evans. Also known as Lily Potter. That wasn't possible though. No child could live that long on their own.</p>
<p>He pointed his wand at the boy and asked," Who are you?"</p>
<p>The ebony haired boy said dusting himself off," Gray Fullbuster of Fairy Tail. Who are you?"</p>
<p>Fairy Tail? What in the bloody he'll was he talking about? Now the boy was back to ignoring him. Instead checking over his body for wounds. A brisk wind passed through them causing him to shiver. To his surprise their was not even a shudder from the boy. He was wearing a black t-shirt and jeans. He by all right should have been freezing.</p>
<p>Remembering the question he thought it was only polite to reply," Regulus Black. I was sent to check out a strange magical presence. Know anything about that?"</p>
<p>If he had not been watching the boy so closely he would have missed the small flinch. It was so subtle it could have been mistaken for a movement. If their eyes had not met at that exact moment again.</p>
<p>The boy called Gray said," That would likely have been me. Strange things always happen around me. It's like I'm a bad luck charm."</p>
<p>So the Gray didn't know about magic. As old as he was it surprised Regulus. The ministry was much better about catching uses of magic now. Gathering children that lived in unacceptable homes. Seems like he found another one.</p>
<p>Slowly so not scare the boy off he moved closer. Now the boy's eyes were fixed on him watching his every move. His knees bent and his clenching and unclenching as if preparing for a fight. Regulus wasn't proficient at muggle fighting but he could hold his own.</p>
<p>In a calm smooth tone he said," I know some people that can explain to you what's going on. How about you follow me back to my office so I can bring them?"</p>
<p>It was a gamble since he had no id. If the boy truly was from the muggle world he would want to see some. Then again he could always stun him. That would bring anger and mistrust upon him later though.</p>
<p>The boy's reply surprised him," Show me your guild mark. Proof you are not from a dark guild."</p>
<p>Guild? Was that some kind of new muggle thing? Silence was not his best option it seemed as the boy's eyes narrowed in suspicion.</p>
<p>He said calmly trying to diffuse this strange situation," I do not understand what you mean by guilds. I work at the Ministry of Magic. We regulate everything that happens in Britian. Where are you from?"</p>
<p>The boy grunted in frustration," Lovely. The equivalent of a magic council. Am i in trouble?"</p>
<p>Whoever this magic council was it was obvious the boy didn't like them. Shaking his head he replied," No. As i said i was only coming to check on the disturbance. Usually someone your age is in a magical school."</p>
<p>A look of pure confusion crossed the boy's face. He asked," What in the hell is a magical school? I learned from a master. As did most people I know."</p>
<p>This boy was getting more interesting by the minute. Never been to a magical school. Trained by a master of magic. Was this boy even from this time?</p>
<p>Masters of magic had been more well known back in the time of the founders. That had also been the time of the elementals. It was said that a set of elementals had bonded with Salazar Slytherin giving him immense power. These stories could never be confirmed though. It did make the young Black wonder.</p>
<p>If this Fullbuster was not from this time that would explain the magical disturbance. It would have taken a great amount of magic to send this boy forward in time.</p>
<p>As he was thinking this though things started not adding up. Fullbuster was wearing clothes that would be from their time. With having no possible way to change. Things were definitely strange. It was definitely time to bring the boy in. They could work it out the Ministry.</p>
<p>Gray's POV</p>
<p>As he finished checking himself over he kept a wary eye on the man. For some reason he was holding out a stick like a weapon. Weirdo... he's an adult he should be using magic circles now. Only kids used wands when they were first learning of magic.</p>
<p>When the man drew closer than Grey was comfortable he shifted to the balls of his feet ready to dodge. He would let the man attack first. Then he could claim self defense.</p>
<p>Black said," You need to come with me now. I'm going to take you to the Ministry. We can sort out what to do with you there."</p>
<p>Gray sighed as he asked," Do you really think I will go anywhere with you? Or that you can force me to? Especially with such a basic form of magic?"</p>
<p>The man's face grew cloudy at his words. He had hit a sore spot with the other. Good it would make things easier for him.</p>
<p>Years of fighting with Natsu taught him a lot. Such as the angrier your opponent the more likely they are to make a mistake. Not that you ever wanted to make a Dragon Slayer mad. Unless you were their opposite like he was.</p>
<p>The man waved the wand and said," Stupify."</p>
<p>He dodged out of the way as a red light came at him. It was much smaller than usual magic. There wasn't any magic circles either. Wherever he was it had strange uses of magic.</p>
<p>He brought his hands up. His right palm was laid out flat while he left was balled into a fist. He called upon his magic just as his master had taught him. The force from the magical pressure he was excluding pushed his hair out of his eyes. A magic circle appeared in front of him blue in color.</p>
<p>He said calmly his tone colder than the magic he wielded," Ice make Lance!"</p>
<p>Lance made out of pure sharpened ice came out of the magic circle. Black was too stunned to react and the lances hit him square in the chest. Knowing he couldn't stay there he used the distraction to make his escape.</p>
<p>He didn't know where he would go but he couldn't stay there. No doubt the man had friends and they would come after him.</p>
