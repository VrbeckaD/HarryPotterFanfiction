          <div class="userstuff"><p>“So, I’ve finally found the nightingale’s nest, haven’t I?” Jack’s voice sparkles up the stairwell to her.</p>
<p>“Hello, Harkness.” She smiles in spite of her earlier mood at the Gryffindor’s approach. “Come to have a laugh at my expense?”</p>
<p>“Come to commiserate, more like. I brought firewhiskey,” he adds, overcoming her remaining resistance to his presence. </p>
<p>“What’s got you down?” Martha stretches on the battered sofa in the isolated lounge.</p>
<p>“Same as you, I expect: shot down by the Smith brothers for dates for the Yule Ball.” He pours them each a generous measure.</p>
<p>The Ravenclaw girl’s nose wrinkles. “I would have thought you’d have loads of choices, the way you flirt.”</p>
<p>Jack hands her a glass. “Nobody likes to be second choice. A lesson I experienced first hand, the hard way.”</p>
<p>“Ouch. Do I want to know?”</p>
<p>“Asked John Smith. Turned out I was his second choice after Rose Tyler.”</p>
<p>“Sounds oddly familiar;” Martha braces herself with a sip of the firewhisky. “I was James Smith’s third choice after Rose Tyler and Harry Saxon.”</p>
<p>“He’s going with Harry over you?” Jack asks. “He does know Harry beat his last girlfriend, right?”</p>
<p>“Don’t. Remind. Me.” Martha grits out, burning away the disappointment with another pull from her glass.</p>
<p>“Sorry, I--” Jack Harkness flustered, she thinks: now that’s new. “I just meant that you’re quite a catch.” He clears his throat, takes a sip. “Still, could be worse.” He sits next to her. “You could have been Benjamin Smith’s fourth choice after Amy Pond, Rory Williams, and Melody Pond.”</p>
<p>“Wait, he asked Amy out, then her kid sister?” </p>
<p>“Yup. And she said yes.” Martha shakes her head--there was no telling with the Ponds, but Jack still deserved better than that.</p>
<p>“That sounds almost as humiliating as being Basil Smith’s fifth choice, behind Melody Pond, Bill Potts, Missy Saxon, and Clara Oswald. Guess he has a thing for crazy Slytherins and black Ravenclaws,” she snorts.</p>
<p>“Yikes. I’m sorry.” She slumps into his inviting shoulder. “Wait, isn’t Bill Potts gay?”</p>
<p>“Very gay, and very taken,” Martha sighs. “Don’t think I didn’t consider it. Basil wanted to know if she would go as his friend.”</p>
<p>Three silent beats pass between them. “We could go as friends,” Jack offers.</p>
<p>Martha considers this, not for the first time. Jack is sweet, and funny, and surprisingly kind, even if he does flirt with anything with a pulse. “...or we could go as more than friends.”</p>
<p>“Are you serious?”</p>
<p>“You scared, Harkness? You, me, next Hogsmeade weekend.” She turns to face him. </p>
<p>“It’s a date, my dear Martha,” he breathes, and seals the bargain with a kiss, spicy with liquor.</p></div>
