    <p>On the day after requesting a transfer out of the SRU, Kevin Wordsworth found a photocopy of his request in his locker with the word “Denied” stamped on it and a Post-It note telling him to come to the briefing room once he changed.  Confused and surprised that Sarge was going <em>this</em> far to get him to stay, Wordy scrambled through getting his uniform on and fairly bolted out of the locker room, almost running into Ed in the process.</p>
<p>Wordy tossed a, “Sorry,” over his shoulder and hurried up the ramp.</p>
<p>Sarge was waiting just inside the briefing room door, a peculiar gleam in his eyes.  He waved Wordy inside, then looked across at Winnie.  “Winnie, tell everyone else to hit the workout room unless we get a call out.”</p>
<p>“Copy that,” the dispatcher agreed, her expression curious.</p>
<p>Wordy stood next to the table, trying not to fidget as Sarge tapped the controls to close the barrier.  “Wordy, have a seat,” Sarge instructed with a smile.  “You’re not in trouble.”</p>
<p>“Sarge, why’d you deny my request?”</p>
<p>The gleam grew deeper as Sarge flipped the manila folder on the table open, revealing the original transfer request.  Wordy’s eyebrows shot up when he realized “Denied” was <em>not</em> stamped on the original.  The Sergeant settled himself in a chair, pointedly waiting until his constable sat down to speak.  He tapped the form.  “This is still active, Wordy.  That’s why I made a copy.”</p>
<p>“You wanted to get my attention, but why?”  Wordy spread his hands.  “I’m not going to get better, Sarge, and I’ve stayed as long as I can.”</p>
<p>“Until Ed violated your privacy,” Sarge corrected gently.  Watching Wordy deflate a bit, the older man shook his head.  “Wordy, if Ed had gone digging around in <em>my</em> locker, I’d’ve written him up.  I <em>still</em> can, if you want.”</p>
<p>Wordy shook his head.  “No, Sarge, it’s okay.”  Drawing in a deep breath, the brunet looked up at his boss.  “What did you want to talk about, Sarge?”</p>
<p>For the first time, a slightly sheepish look crossed the Sergeant’s face.  “Well, it’s not so much <em>me</em> that wants to talk to you before you leave…”</p>
<p>“We wanted to,” Alanna piped up as the two teens dropped their Disillusionment Charms.</p>
<p>Wordy jumped at their sudden appearance, then cocked his head to the side.  “And you needed to talk <em>before</em> I transferred out <em>because</em>?”</p>
<p>Lance offered something to Alanna, but she shook her head and propelled her brother towards Wordy.  “Your idea, big brother mine,” she chided, but there was a wry grin on her face.</p>
<p>The teen shook off his sister’s pushing and walked right up to Wordy, offering a small box to the constable.  “What’s this?” Wordy asked, taking it and opening it up to blink at a silver bracelet, gleaming and shiny in its resting place.</p>
<p>“Um, well, if it works like we hope…it’s…acureforParkinson’sDisease.”</p>
<p>Wordy blinked at the blurted, mashed up sentence, then he froze in shock, staring between Lance and the box.  “A cure?” he breathed.  “For Parkinson’s?”  Denial surged; he’d <em>gone</em> to a Healer and he’d <em>tried</em> to find a magical cure.  “But, there isn’t one,” he protested.</p>
<p>“We know,” Alanna agreed quietly.  “This isn’t a cure in the sense of you won’t have Parkinson’s any more.  You’ll still have it, but it won’t matter anymore.”</p>
<p>The big man was still puzzled.  “So…you came up with something to, what, control my symptoms?”</p>
<p>The siblings traded glances, then looked back at him and nodded.  “That about sums it up,” Alanna drawled.  “It’s still a work-in-progress, but we think it’s ready for action.”</p>
<p>“Because I’m about to transfer,” Wordy guessed.</p>
<p>“No.”  Lance straightened.  “We were going to give it to you anyway.  We finished it yesterday, then Uncle Greg came home and told us about your transfer request.”</p>
<p>Gray eyes shifted to Sarge.  “Sarge, you knew about this?”</p>
<p>A rueful chuckle.  “No,” Sarge replied.  “They surprised me with it when I came home.”</p>
<p>Realization dawned.  “So <em>that’s</em> why you ‘denied’ my transfer request,” Wordy teased, earning a nod from his boss.  The constable pulled the gleaming metal bracelet from the box.  “Okay, you two brats, what do I do with this thing?”</p>
<p>Lance snagged it, opening up the clasp and tugging on each side; one eyebrow hiked as the bracelet opened up, almost like a cuff.  “Which arm?”</p>
<p>“Left,” Wordy decided, watching as the teen slipped it on and pushed the sides back together.  Two fingers moved to the clasp; there was a breath, then the clasp closed and the bracelet lit green.  No, not the bracelet…runes he hadn’t noticed before lit green, creating a glow around the bracelet that seemed to shimmer a moment before settling back and looking more like the engraving had been painted green or maybe like he was wearing a fancier bracelet version of a mood ring.</p>
<p>“Nice.”</p>
<p>Lance didn’t respond, he was focusing on the bracelet as it kept glowing green.  The teen frowned, tilting his head to the side; his frown grew deeper the longer the green glow continued.  After a moment, he sighed to himself and reached forward to press his finger against three colored discs Wordy hadn’t even noticed until then.  As Lance touched the blue circle, the runes shifted color to blue and a yellow ring surrounded the circle.  Next, Lance pressed the black circle, heralding another change of color as the runes turned black and the yellow ring moved to the black disc.</p>
<p>“Okay, overrides are working,” Lance murmured, pressing the black disc again.  The yellow ring vanished and the runes returned to their original green hue.</p>
<p>“Why is it still green, then?” Alanna asked before Wordy could.</p>
<p>“Well,” Lance replied, shifting back on his heels.  “It could be because Uncle Wordy’s only had the bracelet on maybe a minute.  Or it could be a problem with the programming.”</p>
<p>A low whistle escaped at the mention of programming and Wordy turned his wrist to inspect the bracelet better.  Two rows of small runes marched along the outside of the bracelet in flowing script that looked a bit…familiar, but he couldn’t quite place it.</p>
<p>“How will you know?” Sarge asked curiously, leaning forward to examine the bracelet himself.</p>
<p>Lance hiked his shoulders in a shrug.  “I suppose we’ll know if the emergency part works in about…” he checked his watch, “…forty minutes or so.  That’s when the power level should dip below the emergency threshold I programmed in <em>if</em> the bracelet stays on high.”</p>
<p>Wordy arched a pointed brow.  “High?”</p>
<p>Alanna moved around the table.  “The outside is all the programming runes,” she explained.  “The healing runes are on the inside and I came up with seven sequences.”  Wordy’s eyebrows shot up at that.  “Anyway, they take a lot of magic…that’s why Lance had to come up with the programming in the first place…so if the bracelet runs all of them at once, it only has power for about an hour.”</p>
<p>Lance cut in before Wordy could ask the next question.  “I set it up so it shifts to emergency mode if the power dips below twenty-five percent.  That’s why we can’t get the full hour right now.”</p>
<p>“Copy,” Wordy agreed, inspecting the bracelet with fresh eyes.  “So, when does it shift off of high?”</p>
<p>“It should do it automatically once you’re within human normal parameters.  That part depends on the magic, though.”  Lance fidgeted.  “Like I said, it’s kinda still a work in progress.”</p>
<p>“And <em>I’m</em> the guinea pig,” Wordy teased, grinning as the pair flushed scarlet.</p>
<p>He was starting to figure out what they’d meant, that they would have given him the bracelet even <em>without</em> his transfer request; they’d clearly gone as far as they could without field-testing their creation.  Ironically, if he’d held out <em>just</em> a little longer, maybe he wouldn’t have had to put in a transfer request at all.  Even though his meds were starting to have less and less effect, if he’d <em>known</em> the kids were up to <em>this</em>, he would’ve held out.</p>
<p>Curious, he looked between the teens and his Sergeant.  “Why keep this quiet?”</p>
<p>The adolescents flinched.  Alanna drew in a deep breath and answered first.  “We weren’t sure we could make it work,” she admitted, resting her chin on her arms.  “Seven runic sequences is really only the tip of the iceberg and we had a <em>lot</em> of help getting the prototype done.”</p>
<p>“How long <em>have</em> you two been working on this?” Sarge questioned.</p>
<p>“Since the day you told us about Uncle Wordy’s diagnosis,” Lance returned flatly.</p>
<p>Comprehension shone in Sarge’s eyes.  “So <em>this</em> is why you two didn’t want to go anywhere this summer and tried to skate on your schoolwork.”</p>
<p>The nods were sheepish and Wordy frowned.  “Hey, it’s not like Parkinson’s is a death sentence,” he scolded.  “Don’t put your lives on hold like this again.”</p>
<p>Lance’s expression was decidedly unimpressed with the scolding, though he said nothing.  For another few minutes, the clock ticked away, then Sarge cleared his throat.  “Well, I don’t think those runes are going to change color in the next five minutes, so, Wordy, you can head to the workout room.  I’ll hang onto your transfer request, but I won’t sign off on it until you tell me to.  Fair enough?”</p>
<p>“That works, Sarge,” Wordy agreed at once.  “Come back when the runes turn color?”</p>
<p>“Blue or black,” Lance confirmed.</p>
<p>Sarge turned towards his <em>nipotes</em> and pointed at them.  “You two had better have your homework with you.”</p>
<p>“We do,” Alanna replied at once.  “Um…mine is in the car, though.”</p>
<p>“Me too.”</p>
<p>Wordy choked on a laugh and Sarge’s expression turned amused; it was clear the pair hadn’t wanted to take away from the big reveal.  “All right,” the Sergeant acknowledged, “Go on, go get it.”</p>
<p>The two vanished almost before he was done talking and Wordy chuckled.  “I’ll be back in half an hour, Sarge.”</p>
<p>“Copy.  I’m going to tell Winnie to make Team Four the active team for this shift.  If Ed asks, it’s my punishment for him going through your locker.”</p>
<p>Wordy snickered and strolled out of the briefing room, much more cheerful than when he’d arrived.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>If Wordy had been watching the clock, he would have known that the runes shifted color, from green to black, just over forty minutes after Lance had fastened the clasp.  The constable immediately finished up on the weight machine he’d been using and headed back to the briefing room.  As he walked, he fingered the metal, feeling the grooves he’d missed the first time he’d picked the bracelet up.</p>
<p>Lance and Alanna looked up from their schoolwork; to Wordy’s bemusement, it was Alanna who abandoned her books and hurried over.  He reached for the clasp, but the redhead shook her head and simply touched the bracelet.  The bracelet turned violet as the girl charged it; idly, Wordy checked his watch and mentally whistled when it took her only three minutes to charge the bracelet.</p>
<p>“Has that got a timer?” Alanna asked, following his gaze to his watch.</p>
<p>Wordy shrugged.  “Sure.”  He shifted the watch to timer mode.  “Tell me when.”</p>
<p>The bracelet lit violet again for a second or two, then, “Now.”</p>
<p>The constable pressed down the start button as Alanna stepped back.  “Stop it when the runes change color?” Wordy questioned, though he was pretty sure he knew the answer already.</p>
<p>Alanna nodded, her smile rather impish.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>The alarm went off half an hour later and Ed, as expected, was indignant when Team Four got the call instead of Team One.  Wordy gleefully passed on Sarge’s cover story, smirking at the expression on Ed’s face.  Ed did not take his ‘punishment’ lying down and headed out of the workout room to complain to Sarge directly.  He was still gone when the runes turned black.  Wordy stopped the timer, inspecting it curiously.  Forty-one minutes, not too shabby, especially considering the kids were probably still working with theoretical estimates.</p>
<p>He left the workout room, trading a tease with Spike on his way out, then jogged up towards the briefing room.  Lance was lurking outside, a wry grin on his face.  Wordy headed straight for the teen, who recharged the bracelet without a word, though Lance nodded thoughtfully when Wordy showed him the watch timer.</p>
<p>Softly, Lance asked, “How are you feeling?”</p>
<p>Just as quietly, Wordy replied, “I know I have Parkinson’s ‘cause the doctors told me, but I’ve never <em>felt</em> different.”  One shoulder hiked.  “I could try the test Toth had me do, but I took my meds this morning.”</p>
<p>Lance nodded in understanding.  “When do they wear off, do you know?”</p>
<p>“Well, have to take ‘em twice daily,” Wordy mused.  “But I’d probably have to go off them a couple weeks to have them out of my system.  Sorry.”</p>
<p>“No, it’s okay,” Lance replied.  “I guess I knew it was gonna be messy, just didn’t really think about it.”  He glanced at the runes and made a face.  “Still green, huh?”</p>
<p>Wordy glanced down at the glowing runes.  “How long are you going to leave it?  Sarge sure isn’t going to like you and your sister skipping school for more than one day.”</p>
<p>“I know,” Lance admitted.  “I have a backup plan if we need it, but let’s see how the rest of today goes, all right?”</p>
<p>The constable shrugged.  “Works for me, kiddo.”  He darted a look at the briefing room.  “I’d better disappear before Ed catches on.”</p>
<p>“Copy that,” the teenager chuckled.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Ed’s foul temper over being sidelined soon translated to the team, outside, doing sprints in full gear.  Not even Sarge was spared, but the Sergeant was a better sport about it than the rest of his team, save one.  Wordy deliberately adjusted his pace to run with Sarge, the two trading glances that were a combination of amusement and resignation.  The pair was just finishing up the sixth of ten laps when Wordy had a sense of something being…<em>right</em>.  As if the world had been <em>just</em> a touch off-kilter and now it was back on track.  His breathing was also a touch easier and his thinking was clearer than it had been, even that morning.  The difference was small, but noticeable.  The constable stole a brief look down at his wrist, but he was running too fast to really examine the runic bracelet.</p>
<p>Though tempted to pick up his pace, Wordy forced himself to stay steady beside Sarge.  Four laps later, Wordy slid to a stop and immediately pushed back his sleeve enough to see the bracelet.  Blue runes glittered back at him.</p>
<p>“It works, it really works,” Wordy whispered, shifting his arm to show Sarge.</p>
<p>Sarge clapped him on the back.  “Let’s see what <em>mio nipotes</em> want to do next.”</p>
<p>“Copy <em>that</em>.”</p>
