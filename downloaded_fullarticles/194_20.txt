    <p>He stared at the child, this helpless and weak child, and could not help but wonder, how it was supposed to vanquish him. How could this boy defeat him, one of the most powerful wizards in history? It didn't matter, not in the end. He would kill him and eliminate the last thing in his way to power. </p><p>The boy's green eyes were wide and staring at him in an almost haunting manner, accusing him of everything he had done, of the death of the couple lying on the floor of their once safe home. As if he knew they were dead. In his mind, the red haired woman would soon stand up and hug him with a smile, a warm and kind smile. It was the jealousy of that thought that helped Voldemort overlook the child's eyes and the tinge of guilt he might have felt, had he followed the train of thoughts. Power came with a price, a price he was willing to pay. He had never killed a child before, but his own life was worth more to him than that of a stupid boy, whose eyes were so warm. So warm. </p><p>When he lifted his wand, the curse was fueled not by rage, but by the fear of death. "Avada Kedavra", words he had said so many times, whispered out in the quiet room. He saw the child laughing at the bright light, reaching towards it with chubby, uncoordinated hands. A small price to pay for his life and power. And yet.. And yet.</p><p>The curse did not kill the child. It bounced back, knocking the boy backwards in his crib, tears streaming down his face, caused by the sudden impact. The green light was blinding when it shot towards Voldemort. For the first time in years he felt scared, felt like the little boy in the orphanage, being beaten by the other children until he couldn't move anymore. He tried to move, tried to escape his own curse, but it was futile. Surprisingly, his death did not hurt. Voldemort had always imagined the killing curse to be worse than the cruciatus, but when the light washed over him, there was no pain. There was... nothing. Nothing. No light at the end of a tunnel, no brightness, not even a biblical hell. The quiet and darkness was almost peaceful, that was until the eternity of torture began. </p><p>It felt as if he was being ripped apart. He could feel his soul, scattered across the country, pulling him towards every Horcrux, the main piece of his soul was being pulled apart bit by bit. It felt worse than anything he could ever had imagined and it cost him all the strength he had to avert his consciousness from the pain towards his surroundings. Voldemort found himself in the the same spot in which he stood only moments ago, looking down at his own body, pale, and still clutching the wand, holding onto magic even in death. The child, still crying in his crib, was surrounded by a bright light, golden and beautiful. Something in him wanted to dive into this pool of gold and loose himself in it. </p><p>He reached out, hesitantly, fearing the brightness might burn him, much like the sun. But when he touched the light, emotions overcame him that would have brought tears to his eyes, had he owned a body. Happiness, true happiness something he had rarely felt in his life and another emotion, one he did not recognize. His soul shuddered at the feelings bubbling in the child, the oh so pure child. Was it love that he felt? Was this how it felt like? He wondered why he never felt like that little boy was feeling. Perhaps it was the innocence of the child that allowed it to love so unconditionally, perhaps Voldemort was just too evil to feel happiness on his own. </p><p>For the first time in years, there was regret in him. Regret of what he had done to cling to life itself, to the power magic brought. Maybe he could have been happy like this child, had he not done the things he did. Perhaps... Perhaps.</p><p>The pure bliss ended when the pull at his soul got too strong to bear, along with the pain. His splintered soul was yearning to heal itself, but he knew he would not be able to be whole again. He wanted to stay with this happiness, this golden child, did not want to go into the cold world, filled with darkness. Most of all, he did not want to be left alone with his own thoughts, slowly drifting into madness. Voldemort clung to the child, the warmth, the happiness, the love, with all he could, fighting the pain. </p><p>The desperate pull of his soul against the boys weak one caused something to happen, that would be deeply regretted and cherished by both Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. The dark and tainted soul of the Dark Lord squeezed it's way into the boys body, forcing part of his pure and light soul out of it's own body. While Voldemort clung to the love inside the boy, Harry's soul clung to the only familiarity nearby, Voldemort, no matter how brief the encounter might have been. He unbeknownst to him, saved the sanity of a man, who otherwise would have lost it in the long 10 years of being caught with only his own mind as company. </p><p>They created a bond should never have been created between such contrasts. Light and Dark. Life and Death. Yin and Yang. Their souls would forever battle each other and forever complete each other. Neither could live without the other.</p><p>When Hagrid came to bring the child to it's closest relatives, he did not notice the faint hint of darkness surrounding the boy, neither did anyone apart from Dumbledore. The old wizard stared at the child in his arms, wondering what had been created in the darkness of halloween 1981.</p>
