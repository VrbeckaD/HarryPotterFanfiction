<p class="bria-western">May 2001</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">Pansy walked into the run-down pub, looking around at the evening crowd, shaking her head. These people were like cattle, following the herd. She had never understood that mentality. She was always the type to follow her own lead, do things her own way -- not that she didn't have her own followers when she was in Hogwarts. But that was just how those girls’ brains worked -- she couldn't help that.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">She supposed that the people in here did have a reason to celebrate, though. It was the third anniversary of Potter and gang defeating old snake face. It was Pansy’s own damn fault for coming into The Leaky Cauldron anyway. But she needed to get into Diagon Alley and go to Twilfitt and Tattings. There was a stupid damn Ministry Gala tonight honoring the Golden Trio for winning, and naturally the families of the Sacred Twenty-eight were expected to be in attendance. Or at least the ones who had been cleared of their crimes.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">Pansy worked her way through the crowd, grumbling again about stupid cattle. Her foot got caught around someone else’s and she stumbled into someone. “Woah there! You alright?”</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">Hazel eyes met brilliant green and Pansy had to stop herself from rolling them. She pushed herself into a standing position, straightening her clothes. “I'm fine, Potter.” She flipped a strand of hair over her shoulder and lifted her nose into the air. “These idiots can't keep their feet where they belong. On the floor. Later, Potter.”</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">Pansy continued her previous course through the crowd, now more carefully. She could feel those green eyes watching her as she left, but she didn't give the Boy Who Lived Twice a second glance. The same couldn't be said for her thoughts, though.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">She finally made it into the small clearing behind the pub, pulling her wand from her purse and tapping the red bricks in front of her, their fronts worn from the years and years of use. Pansy couldn't help but recall the way those green eyes had bore into hers. Like they were seeing past her haughty and proud exterior, past her carefully constructed walls. It was a little unnerving. The only other person who had ever been able to do that was that evil monster, Voldemort, the first and only time she had met him.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">Pansy shuddered in the May heat as a rush of goosebumps lifted her flesh, causing her hair to raise from her scalp. She tried to shake it off as she stepped through the archway into Diagon Alley en route to her destination. She really hoped that Twilfitt and Tattings had what she needed. Muggle London had had many options, but nothing like what she had been looking for.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">As she walked by the shops, most of them already closed for the evening, she slid her hands into the pockets of the Muggle jeans she was wearing. Pansy had taken to buying most of her clothes from the Muggle world -- they just fit her style better than anything she could find in wizarding fashion.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">Again those damn vibrant green eyes floated through her mind and she cursed under her breath, stopping under a lamp. Her fingers closed around a pack of cigarettes and a lighter, slipping them from her pocket. Pansy pulled one of the white cigarettes from the plastic package and placed it between her lips, slipping the pack back into her pocket before bringing the lighter to the tip and flicking the flint wheel. She cupped her hand around it to block any slight breeze that may be blowing and watched as the small flame flared to life.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">Sure, it would be easier and more efficient to use her wand. But she liked the little Muggle lighter. As she took the first drag on the cigarette, she held the breath in for as long as she could. Pansy had laced the cigarettes with a wizarding relaxant and she was letting that absorb into her lungs.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">Slowly, the tension left Pansy’s shoulders and she released the breath, the smoke leaving her lips in a white stream. “Pull yourself together, Parkinson.”</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">She hated being on edge, truly she did. But it was a leftover side effect from the war she supposed. While she knew that Potter was not a malicious person, nor was he a skilled Legilimens, it had still felt that way when their eyes had connected. That had made her reach for her cigarettes, which she only used in times of stress.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">Pansy pushed off from the street lamp and began walking down the pavement once again, the cigarette never leaving her lips for long. By the time she got to the dress shop, she was down to the butt of the white stick and she put it out on the pavement. The mistress of the shop opened the door for her with a wide smile, “Welcome, Miss Parkinson.”</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">XxX</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">Ron had asked Harry to meet him at the Leaky after work. Normally Harry would have declined, but today was different. Today was a day they always needed a drink and company. Three years had passed. Three incredibly long, yet short years since he had defeated Voldemort. In those years, Hogwarts had been rebuilt, renovated and reimagined. Kingsley Shacklebolt had been elected Minister and had taken the reigns, flipping the Ministry on its head. It had been completely overhauled, the old regime and way of doing things had been thrown out. Creating a new pathway for equality among wizardkind, no matter blood status.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">Harry was dreading yet another Ministry Gala in his and his best friends’ honor. He was actually planning out the conversation he was going to have with Kingsley tonight.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">He had been standing at one of the tall tables so that he could see when Ron came in when a body slammed into him. All he saw was black hair in carefully constructed barrel curls. “Woah there! You alright?” he asked.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">When those hazel eyes met his, he was taken aback. He was staring down at Pansy Parkinson. The last time he'd seen her was at Hogwarts, before everything went to shite. Well, no, that wasn't quite right. Harry had seen her at the first two of the Ministry’s events, but just glimpses of her.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">Harry was so lost in taking in her appearance that he didn't hear a word she said. Then she was moving away, back through the crowd, heading for the entrance to Diagon Alley. He was watching her intently when a hand landed on his shoulder, “Hey mate, sorry I'm late.”</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">“Ron!” Harry nearly shouted as he turned around. His eyes blinked rapidly, his heart beating the same. “Don't sneak up on me like that.”</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">Ron held up his hands in surrender. “Sorry, but in my defense, I did call your name first. What were you looking at anyway?”</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">“Just had a run in with a blast from our past,” Harry said, knocking back the remainder of the firewhiskey he’d been nursing.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">Ron’s eyes followed where Harry had been looking. “Malfoy?”</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">Harry shook his head, his eyes on the empty tumbler in front of him. “Pansy Parkinson.”</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">Wide and shocked blue eyes turned to greet Harry. “No way. She’s been kind of reclusive since her family’s trial.” A waitress interrupted them, asking for Ron’s drink order and Harry ordered another Firewhiskey for himself.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">“I know, but hell, both her parents were sent to Azkaban for a very long time. I’d want to stay out of the public eye, too. I just don’t understand why her mother’s sentence was so long, Mrs. Parkinson wasn’t a Death Eater.” Harry wondered out loud, his mind already back at the office, thinking about just where the Parkinson’s file was located. He’d have to look into that, something didn’t seem right about that. Surely Pansy’s mother was less involved than Narcissa Malfoy had been.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">The waitress returned, placing their drinks in front of them. She lingered, her eyes trailing over both Harry and Ron, assessing them. Most people did. Most women fawned over them. They were the guys of the “Golden Trio” as they had been dubbed. Ron adored the attention, soaked it in, took numerous chits back to his room all the time. But Harry hated it. The interest in him had become even more intense since the news of his and Ginny’s break up had hit the <em>Prophet</em> last week.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">He and Ginny had tried to make their relationship work, they truly had, but in the end, the war had just changed them both too much. They both still loved each other, but more in a friendly, platonic way than the romantic kind that they had before the war. She even still lived at Grimmauld Place with Harry, Ron and Hermione, and they talked every day.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">Suddenly those deep hazel eyes floated by in his thoughts again and he remembered what she she had been wearing. A worn and faded black shirt with an AC/DC logo on the front, tight black Muggle jeans with rips all along the legs and fishnet stockings underneath. If their encounter had been longer, he’d probably have gotten over his surprised shock and asked her about her choice in clothing, but she had been gone before he could recover from his momentary speechlessness.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">“You ready for tonight, mate?” Ron asked him, bringing Harry back to the present.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">Harry grimaced, taking a sip of his drink and shaking his head. “No, not at all. I hate these damn galas. I’m going to talk to Kingsley tonight about doing them maybe every five years. Give the world time to heal without poking at a fresh wound every damn year.” He glanced at his watch and sighed, “Come on, we’d better go and get ready.”</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">XxX</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">Pansy was looking between two mirrors that were replaying the image of her in two different dresses. Both were a deep maroon, but not that horrid color that Gryffindors wore -- instead they were a gorgeous deep color that reminded her of her favorite knit blanket on long winter nights. Nights she loved to spend curled up next to the fire with a steaming mug of coffee and a nice long novel.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">Both were crop top dresses. The one on the left was all lace short sleeves with the chest, shoulders, and sleeves all made of lace. The skirt was see through from mid-thigh down, the lace providing just enough mystery. It was stunning, actually. Her eyes turned to the mirror on the left hand side -- another beautiful choice. The skirt was nothing spectacular like the first choice, but the top more than made up for it. A sweetheart neckline with a deep plunge, and where the straps came up over the shoulders, they split in two. The back was twisted and looped in intricate patterns.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">It was going to be so hard to choose. Pansy flicked her wand to change her hairstyles on the images. She tilted her head and tapped her wand tip against her lips. “What to choose, what to choose?”</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">“Well, Miss Parkinson, they both looked divine on you. You could buy both since you’re having such a hard time deciding. I’m sure you’re going to need them both for more than one occasion.” The shop owner smiled sweetly at Pansy and Pansy rolled her eyes at the wrinkled old witch.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">“You just want my Galleons, Madam Tattings. But I do believe you’re right. Though I do need to make a decision now. I only have a couple of hours until the gala. I know somewhere, in this genius mind of mine, that I have made a decision. My wand will know me better.” Pansy closed her eyes and used the spell that she used regularly to help pick out her outfits. Her wand began spinning in her hand before stopping.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">When her eyes opened, the yew wand in her hand was pointing to the mirror on her left. Pansy tilted her head as she looked at the lace dress. This was going to be perfect for tonight. “I will take them both, Madam Tattings. While you have them packed up, I’ll go and pay old Twilfitt.”</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">The other witch gave her a nod, a beaming smile on her face at the idea of such a large sale. Pansy watched as a receipt zoomed its way toward the front of the store and followed it. The old wizard at the front desk was sitting on a stool, looking winded. He was still in the same spot he’d been in when she had walked in a couple of hours ago and hadn’t moved, “Ah, Miss Parkinson, how lovely to see you in here once again. We’re glad to have you back.” His fat and grubby hand lifted to snatch the paper flying around his head. “Is this all you’ll be purchasing today? No shoes for these gorgeous dresses?”</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">“I have plenty of shoes at home, Mister Twilfitt, but thank you for your suggestion. This will be all.” He gave her the total of her purchases and she easily summoned the money she needed from her purse, too lazy to physically count it out. She stacked the money in neat piles and her hazel eyes watched as Twilfitt levitated the money into his drawer.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">Madam Tattings brought up the carefully wrapped package with Pansy’s dresses and handed them over with a smile. “Thank you for your business, Miss Parkinson. We hope to see you again soon.”</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">Pansy gave the woman a rare, genuine smile, “You’re welcome, Madam Tattings. I may be back soon, we’ll see. Have a nice evening.” She left quickly, opting for the nearest Apparition point. She didn’t want to chance running into Potter again in the Leaky.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">XxX</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">Harry and Ron arrived at the Gala on time, checking in with the witch at the visitor's desk of the Ministry. Why Kingsley insisted on holding these things here, Harry didn't understand, but that was the Minister's prerogative.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">“C’mon mate, let's go and grab a drink. My buzz is already starting to fade.” When they had gotten back home, they’d each taken a bottle of Firewhiskey to their respective rooms to get dressed. In an out-of-character act of defiance, Harry chose to wear a Muggle suit tonight instead of wizard robes. He honestly hated the damn things. They were hot and bulky and just got in the way. And besides, most of the women didn't wear robes to these functions, with the exception of witches like Narcissa Malfoy.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">Harry followed Ron over to the bar, asking for a Firewhiskey and waiting for the drink. His eyes scanned the crowd. The few years he’d been an Auror had sharpened his senses considerably. When a cold glass hit his palm, he thanked the bartender and left to walk around the room with Ron. The girls of number twelve Grimmauld Place would be arriving “fashionably late,” or so Ginny had told Ron.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">“Where is your head?” Ron asked from beside him.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">A slightly shaking hand came up to run through Harry’s always unruly black hair. “I dunno, mate. It’s just been a long day.” But Harry did know. He couldn’t get that run-in with Pansy out of his mind. It was as if the moment had been branded onto his conscious. She was going to be here. The Parkinsons were part of the Sacred Twenty-eight. Since most of those families had been aligned with Voldemort, the Ministry had decreed that the cleared members were required to attend the galas.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">Harry took a long drink of the alcohol that was sweating in his hand, his eyes scanning the crowds. Pansy was now on his list of names to talk to tonight. His eyes landed on one of Kingsley’s unique hats and he glanced over at Ron. “There’s Kingsley. I’ll be back.”</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">He began weaving his way through the sea of people that had already gathered. Merlin, how he hated these gatherings. “Kingsley!”</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">The tall, dark-skinned man turned to look at Harry. “Harry! There you are, my boy. Not that many here. But it's still early yet. I saw young Mr. Weasley, but where is our dear Hermione?”</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">“She and Ginny were still getting ready when we left, they should be arriving soon. I actually came over here to talk to you about the galas. I think we should skip next year.” Harry said, taking a small sip of his drink, gauging the MInister’s reaction.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">As expected, Kingsley balked at the idea, his dark eyes widening in surprise, “But Harry, the end of the war is a cause for celebration! Why would we not rejoice at the defeat of Lord Voldemort?”</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">Harry sighed, pushing his glasses up the bridge of his nose, pinching it with his fingers. “I didn’t say that we should stop them completely, Minister. I simply said we should skip next year. Have one the year following and then every five years hence. Continuing to have these parties annually will only keep the wound open. Hermione, Ron, Ginny and I have been talking about this. If we have them every half decade, it will allow the pain to fade, the gaping wounds to begin to close and the community to heal as a whole.”</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">Kingsley listened patiently, his hands on his hips, head angled down and eyes on the floor. When Harry had finished talking, Kingsley ran his tongue along his teeth, making a sucking noise. “I suppose you’re right, Harry. I guess I didn’t see it that way. I will set it up with the events department on Monday.”</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">Harry was only half listening to Kingsley agreeing to his suggestion, he caught sight of dark hair and a flash of a maroon dress. “Thanks, Kingsley, truly. I think it will be for the best. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I see someone else I need to speak with.” He didn’t give the Minister a chance to reply, just started to weave his way through the people, moving his head to look for the dark hair in the lazy, but elegant updo. “Pansy?”</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">The woman he was tailing either didn’t hear him, or did, but chose to ignore him. Harry didn’t care what it would look like to others, he lengthened his stride, quickening his pace to catch up with her. When he got close enough he touched her shoulder gently, “Hey.”</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">XxX</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">Pansy had arrived, intending to check in, spend an hour and leave. That was what she usually did. An hour was the minimum amount of time required by the Ministry for her to be there. But that was before she heard her name. Pansy knew that voice, it had been on a near constant loop in her head for hours. Instead, she increased her pace, not even wobbling in the sky high heels.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">She couldn’t help the sharp intake of breath at his warm touch on her shoulder and his soft, “Hey.” Pansy closed her eyes for a moment before she plastered a smirk on her face and turned around to meet those disarming emerald eyes.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">“Hey yourself, Potter. I told you I’d be seeing you later.” A smile pulled at his lips, and Pansy’s stomach did a flip. Why had she never really noticed how handsome he was before?</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">“That you did.” Pansy watched as Harry’s eyes traveled down her body and she saw him inhale, the action stuttered as if he were having trouble breathing smoothly, and his eyes flared as if he liked what he saw. Pansy’s smirk widened. “Like what you see, Potter?”</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">Harry’s eyes snapped back up to her face, a slight flush crossing his cheeks. “Please, call me Harry. I do, as a matter of fact. You look beautiful tonight, Pansy,” he said, guileless and without remorse. The truth in his words was reflected in his eyes. Eyes that Pansy was once again having trouble meeting, even if she towered over him slightly in her heels.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">They seemed to peer into her soul. If she was honest with herself, it terrified her. Anything that terrified her as much as what she was feeling now was something she needed to steer away from. “Well, don’t stare too much, Harry. I wouldn’t want the little miss to get too jealous. Oh look, there’s Draco.”</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">She had never been so grateful to see that head of platinum blond in her entire life. Pansy left Harry where he stood and made a trail straight for Draco, attaching herself to his side. “Thank Merlin you’re here.”</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">Draco looked down at her, one pale brow arching questioningly. “What has your knickers in a knot?”</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">“I’ve just escaped,” Pansy said, by way of explanation.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">“Escaped from whom?” Draco rolled his eyes, knowing Pansy’s loathing for social interaction.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">“Ha-Potter.” Pansy caught herself, almost calling him Harry to Draco. That damn black haired git was already under her skin and they’d only talked for five minutes. She leaned her head against Draco’s arm, sighing softly, alerting Draco to her conflicting emotions.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">Pansy felt Draco’s finger hook under her chin and she fought the pull of his hand pulling her face up. One look into those grey eyes and she’d spill everything. Or he’d decipher that something had happened and hound it out of her. Probably a little bit of both. But in the end Draco won.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">Those grey eyes found hers and locked on. Years of being best friends, living in the Slytherin dorms, late night talks and their travels around Europe after graduation had attuned them to each other. “What happened with Potter to make you so unraveled?”</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">A spoiled and childish whine left her lips before she recounted what happened in The Leaky Cauldron. All the while, Draco’s brows couldn’t decide if they wanted to rise into his hairline or drop toward his nose. “Pans, I know you don’t want to hear this, but I think it’s high time you live a little. You clearly like Potter or something. And from what you’ve said, it sounds like he fancies you. If you don’t know what your feelings are, just shag him and then see where that leaves you.”</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">“Draco Malfoy! I do not want to shag Harry Potter!” Pansy froze as she realized she had been louder than she’d meant to be. But she had also come to the conclusion that it was exactly what she wanted to do. Dammit Draco. “While we’re on the subject of a member of the Golden Trio and who should shag who, why don’t you go and shag Granger then? Instead of just pining after her? Don’t tell me you’ve forgotten where your balls are. In case you have, they’re right here.”</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">Pansy reached down and gave his crotch a playful squeeze and laughed at his grunt. Draco glared at her, leaning down to whisper in her ear, “Fuck you, Pansy. And I just may go find Granger, because I do have the balls. Unlike you, who has the pussy.”</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">Draco stalked away from her, his shoulders tight underneath the tailored suit jacket. Great, Pansy had just pissed off her only means of distraction. She shouldn’t have brought Granger into it.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">“Ginny and I aren’t together anymore.”</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">Pansy screamed, jumping on the spot and turning around to find Harry standing behind her, two fresh glasses of amber Firewhiskey in his hand. “Potter! Don’t do that!”</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">Harry held out a glass to her and she took it, taking a large gulp. Pansy’s heart was still racing and she hadn’t yet processed what Harry had said. Her hands were shaking as she took another sip. “Did you hear what I said?” he asked.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">“What?” She asked, wiping her hand over her top lip, careful to avoid her lipstick.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">“I said that Ginny and I are no longer dating. Did you not see the <em>Prophet</em> article last week? It was front page.” Harry took a sip of his own drink and she noticed, just under the tip of his long hair, that tips of his ears were red, showing just how much he’d already had to drink. Though he was far from drunk.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">Pansy took a slow breath in, rolling the glass back and forth between her palms. “No, I actually haven’t seen that article. I was out of the country last week. I also don’t subscribe to that trash.”</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">Harry nodded once and fell silent for a moment. When he spoke again, his voice was quiet, “I haven’t stopped thinking about this afternoon all day.” Those green eyes glanced up at her and there was a timidity in his gaze. One that brought goosebumps along her skin.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">Pansy bit back the snarky comment she would have made had she been talking to anyone else. But she'd decided to take Draco’s advice. “It was a rather unsettling occurrence for me, as well. It's set me on edge all evening. Though the alcohol is admittedly helping calm my nerves.” Pansy said, taking another sip. The alcohol was indeed taking its effect already. She had grown accustomed to the muted effects of Muggle alcohol, having been spending most of her time around Muggles.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">It was making her rather loose-lipped and she wasn't sure where it would lead her. Pansy let her eyes wander around the room and caught Draco indeed talking to the object of his fancy.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">Harry must have followed her gaze because his voice was right next to her ear, causing her to shiver. “I think it's about time those two had a chat. They've been dancing around each other for months at work.” She felt his breath ruffling her loosely hanging hair and she could swear she felt his lips brush along her exposed neck. Pansy swallowed thickly and found herself leaning back just slightly into Harry. She felt him step in closer, his chest pressed gently against her back. His deep voice rumbled against her. “You want to get out of here?”</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">“Don't you have a speech to give?” Pansy said breathlessly. She could hear it and so could Harry.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">She watched as Harry lifted his wand in front of him, conjuring his stag Patronus and speaking directly to it. “Please inform the Minister of Magic that I have fallen ill and have gone home.”</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">The stag galloped off in search of the Minister and Harry grabbed her hand, leading her away from the crowd. “We can use the Floo in my office.”</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">Harry led her expertly through the darkened halls of the Ministry, taking the lifts when necessary. When they arrived in his office, he shut and warded the door behind them, smiling at her. “Where would you like to go? This Floo has access to just about anywhere.”</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">“How about we just go to my place? There's no one there to disturb us.” Pansy gave him a seductive grin and grabbed a handful of Floo powder. When she stepped into the grate, she called out her direct address and winked at Harry before throwing the powder down and disappearing.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">Pansy stepped out of the grate, moved to the chaise lounge and sat down, summoning the Firewhiskey from the shelf, along with two glasses, She already had them poured when Harry arrived.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">XxX</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">Harry stumbled free of the fireplace and dusted the ashes from his robes. His eyes rose to see Pansy draped across a velvet chaise lounge, looking seductive without even truly trying. She was holding a glass of Firewhiskey up toward him and he stepped forward to take it. Her eyes were hooded. The hazel color had darkened considerably from when they’d left the gala. “So we have no one here to disturb us, huh?”</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">Pansy took a sip of her drink and shook her head. The yew wand she pulled from just under the top of her cropped dress flared at the tip and Harry heard the Floo shutting off. Another flick of the wand likely had the wards shutting out any admittance. “Just you and I, Harry,” she purred quietly.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">He made a low sound deep in his throat at the thought of being completely alone with Pansy. There was something about that meeting earlier that had him pulled toward her. Harry leaned in now, his arm draping across the back of the lounge, fingers dusting her shoulder. “What kind of trouble am I getting myself into, hmm?”</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">Pansy looked at him through her lashes as she leaned in, taking a big drink of her Firewhiskey, the heat from the drink had her chest red. “I'm sure you're about to find out.” She licked her lips and Harry’s eyes dropped to the action. He swallowed thickly, his mouth suddenly dry.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">Of its own volition his hand darted out and slid around the back of her neck, pulling her closer to him. “You're damn right I am.” Harry brought his lips down on hers roughly, the drink in his free hand completely forgotten. Pansy whimpered into his mouth as her free hand squeezed his thigh.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">She pulled back first, taking a deep, unsteady breath and giving him a feral smile. “That was certainly trouble, Potter.” Pansy brought the glass to her lips, downed the rest of the firewhiskey and Harry did the same. When both the tumblers were empty, she grabbed them and stood, putting them on a table and walked to the door. “You coming or not?” she asked and stepped into the dark hallway.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">Harry scrambled to his feet to follow after her. When he turned right out of the doorway, he stepped on something soft. He bent down to pick it up and looked at the fabric in his hand. He held it up, the light from the parlor showed that it was the top to her dress. Harry glanced away into the darkness, he could see her silhouette and could see her dropping something else. He hurried after her, shedding his coat and working on unbuttoning his shirt.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">Harry stepped over her bra where she had dropped it and rounded the corner, finding her gone. There was an open door at the end of the hallway, light spilling out. He stopped in the doorway and looked at Pansy. She was standing with her back with to him, her skirt still on, her head turned and she looked back at him. Harry dropped his shirt to the ground, leaving him in his trousers. “That's a great view.” She drawled, turning to face him as she drew down a zip on the side of the skirt and let it fall.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">Harry gulped at the sight before him. Pansy was a gorgeous witch. Her breasts were full and perky, perfect. She didn't need a bra at all. His eyes trailed lower, following the curves of her body to her hips where the low slung cheeky boyshorts fell on her hips. They were lacy and white, standing out against her tanned skin.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">The front of his trousers was getting tight and the smirk from Pansy showed that she knew the effect she had on him. “You're fucking beautiful, Pansy.”</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">“I know. I can tell.” She gave a nod in the direction of his crotch and stepped free of the fabric pooled at her feet. She was still in those tall heels and Harry loved the way they made her feet look. Ginny never wore anything so daring.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">They were the same color as her dress, a deeper maroon than the traditional Gryffindor colors and lacy, just like the dress. The tips of her toes peeked out of the top and the height of the heel made her foot arch in an erotic way. Harry had never been attracted to feet before, but if more women wore heels like that, he may just end up with a foot fetish.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">Pansy stopped before him in the doorway and her hands ran down his chest and abdomen. “Never thought Aurors would be in such good shape.” Her fingers found the button on the black Muggle jeans he had chosen to wear and unbuttoned them. Next to go was the zipper, the sound loud in the room.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">“I still play Quidditch with Ron and the Weasleys on the weekends.” Harry’s hands had lifted, running along Pansy’s bare sides, his thumbs brushing under the curve of her breasts.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">Pansy started to tug his jeans down his hips, crouching to the floor, her heels slipping out of the shoes as she balanced on her toes. She looked back up at him, a twinkle in her eyes as she took in his proud erection. She had taken his pants down along with his jeans. “Quidditch players always did have the best bodies.” Pansy licked her lips as her fingers wrapped around his cock and Harry smirked at her.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">“Like what you see?” he asked, his voice turning gravelly. In lieu of answering, she leaned in and ran her tongue around his tip and Harry let out an involuntary groan. His hands lifted to grip the door frame as his head dropped, his eyes locked on what Pansy was doing. Her eyes locked onto his as she ran her tongue around his blunt head once more before folding his erection up against his stomach and flattening her tongue to trail it along the thick vein on the bottom of his shaft. “Fucking hell. I’d say you more than like what you see.”</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">A smirk was thrown his way before she took him into her mouth, her thumb and forefinger wrapped around his base, her lips slowly sliding down to meet them. Harry watched in amazement and awe. This was not something Ginny had enjoyed doing, so she would only oblige him when he asked. To have Pansy willingly suck his cock had him ready to blow, and that was before she began sucking her way back up his thick shaft.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">At that sensation, Harry’s hands dropped from the wood he’d been gripping into Pansy’s hair. He felt the pins that were holding the tresses up and pulled them free carefully, tossing them to the floor. He wound his fingers into her hair and wrapped the strands around them, creating a firm grip as he began to thrust into her mouth.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">Pansy moaned around his length and Harry’s eyes fell shut, a groan leaving his own lips as the sound she made vibrated down his cock, sparking a shock of pleasure in his balls. Her free hand had drifted up from her thigh to fondle his balls and he knew he’d have to pull away soon, or else this would all be over too soon.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">When Pansy tightened her grip on his balls, Harry had to pull out of her mouth, a sheen of sweat covering his whole body as he bent over to kiss her. His hands wrapped around her upper arms and he pulled her to a standing position. Pansy went to free her feet of the heels and Harry shook his head with a devious smirk, “Leave them on.”</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">“Someone is being a kinky bastard.” Pansy grinned back at him, he kicked off his shoes, stepping free of the pile of his clothes and began walking her backward toward the large bed.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">When they got close enough, he spun her around and drew his hand back, swinging it forward with a soft smack to her pert arse. “You have any idea how fucking sexy those things make your legs look?” Harry ran his hand up her spine, pressing between her shoulders, causing her to bend over and brace her hands on the mattress.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">Pansy looked over her shoulder at Harry, a smirk on her face, hips swaying in the air. Harry’s eyes immediately went to her arse, his handprint a visible red mark on her flesh. “That’s the point, Harry. Admiring your handiwork? How about you make the other side match?”</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">Her voice was all challenge and Harry took it, standing to the side of her, rubbing his hand over her bum before pulling back and placing a smack across her unmarked cheek. He glanced up at her, she was still looking over her shoulder, but she was now biting her bottom lip and a low moan had left her throat.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">Harry smoothed his hands over the reddened flesh, leaning in to kiss the marks he had left, his fingers hooking into the white lace, pulling it down over the plump flesh. He couldn’t help but lick his lips as his mouth began to water as her cunt was revealed. From this angle, she looked to be completely bare and it caused a shudder to run through his body.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">He dropped to his knees and helped her step free of the fabric. Harry trailed his fingers up the back of her legs, his lips following. When he got to the juncture of her thighs, he stopped to inhale the scent of her arousal before placing a kiss on her lower lips. Harry dipped his tongue between her slit, immediately finding her swollen clit.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">Pansy let out a moan, her back arching above him, pushing her hips closer to his face. Harry’s hands gripped her arse and pulled her cheeks apart, swirling his tongue around her entrance before trailing back to that sensitive bundle of nerves.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">Harry could feel the muscles of her legs quaking as she reveled in the pleasure, her heels popping out of the shoes once again as she lifted up onto her toes. He pulled back and quickly flipped her over onto her back with a smirk. Harry dove up and kissed Pansy hungrily, his tongue darting into her mouth, allowing her to taste herself on him.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">His lips left hers, trailing down her jaw and then her body. Harry paused briefly at her chest to swirl his tongue around her nipples, then continued on his way back to where he had been. From this angle, he could see that Pansy was indeed completely bare. Godric, that was so fucking hot.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">XxX</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">Harry was kissing along her hip bones on his way back down her body and Pansy was on the verge of losing her mind. She rested her legs on his shoulders as he finally dipped his tongue back between her folds where she desperately wanted him. “Yes, Harry!”</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">Pansy’s hands shot down and carded through his black hair, fisting the unruly strands and holding on tight. She watched as he flicked his tongue off of her clit and free of her folds. When Harry slipped two fingers inside of her slick cunt, she couldn’t hold her eyes open. Her head fell back onto the mattress and she moaned so loud that it echoed in the hallway through the still open door.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">She was quickly nearing the edge, her hands holding tight to Harry’s hair, nails digging into his scalp as his fingers worked in and out of her core, curling at just the right spot to hit that sensitive bundle of nerves. When his teeth tugged her clit away from her body, her torso arched from the bed and she screamed to the ceiling. “Harry!”</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">Pansy felt her pussy clench around his fingers as he continued to work her, his tongue moving down below his fingers, lapping up her release. She tried opening her eyes to watch him, but all she saw were stars.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">When her body finally relaxed and she lay in the bed like a pile of jelly, Harry moved up her body, grinning down at her with a pompous smirk. She rolled her eyes at him and flopped her arms around his neck, pulling him down for a kiss. Pansy could taste herself on him and that, mixed with his natural taste, was almost as intoxicating as Firewhiskey.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">“I think I rather like you screaming my name.” Harry smirked when he pulled back, moving to hover over her.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">Pansy lifted her legs to wrap them around his waist, raising her hips to brush her hot core along his ready and waiting cock. “And I think I’d rather like your cock buried inside my pussy now.” She slid a hand between them and gripped the base of his erection, teasing the tip through her slick folds. His sharp intake of breath had her smirking as she aligned him with her entrance. “Any time now, Potter. You’re not getting any younger, you know.”</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">Harry laughed out loud and dipped his hips, thrusting forward in a swift motion, burying himself to the hilt. That shut Pansy and her sharp remarks up, her nails digging into his back. “Fuck.” She heard him murmur and she let out a breathy laugh. It was quickly cut off by Harry’s lips on hers as his hips began to move in earnest. “So tight, Pansy. Shit.”</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">“Fuck, yes. Right there, Harry.” Pansy tightened her legs around his waist and tilted her hips higher. Harry met her lips with his and her tongue darted out to circle around his as she met his thrusts. Their skin slid together, slick with sweat.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">She pulled back and Harry sat up, one hand coming up to push his glasses up before sliding his arms behind her knees and pushing them toward her chest. The angle changed once again and with every forward thrust, the tip of Harry’s cock hit her g-spot. “Oh, fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck. Yes! Harder.” Pansy cried as her body began to climb once again.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">Harry obliged her request and slammed into her core harder. Her hands gripped his biceps, painted nails leaving marks in the skin. She felt her walls fluttering and her head was thrashing on the mattress. Incoherent words had begun leaving her lips and as her orgasm washed over her, they continued, ending in Harry’s name being shouted once again.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">Pansy held on tightly as Harry brought his body flush against hers, his thrusts becoming erratic. She ran her lips along his neck, sucking at the skin there. Her arms draped around his shoulders again, keeping him close. With a final thrust, he buried himself deep and she felt him shudder, a grunt buried in her neck as she felt his cock jerk inside her core as his seed spilled into her.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">They lay that way for a few minutes, bodies still connected as he softened inside of her. Once their bodies calmed, he rolled to the side, collapsing on the bed next to Pansy and turned his head to grin at her. “I definitely like you screaming my name.”</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">“You better get ready then, you’ll likely hear it all night.” Pansy smirked as she rolled over and draped her torso across his chest, resting her chin on her hands. He had a satisfied smile on his face and a flush still on his skin. She had never just had the chance to admire him before and she was surprised by the attractive man he had grown into. He’d updated his glasses and the style fit him much better.</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">His eyes were closed at the moment, but his smile turned into a smirk as he replied, “Oh, I’ll be glad to, but first, we should nap. It’s been a long day.”</p>
<p class="bria-western"> </p>
<p class="bria-western">Pansy was on board with that plan. She normally wasn’t the cuddling type -- being wrapped in someone’s arms made her feel suffocated and trapped -- but with Harry, she found she didn’t mind being that close. It didn’t take her long to drift off to sleep, a grin on her face as she started dreaming about what would transpire when she woke. Too bad those dreams wouldn’t come true. Her life was about to change forever, all because of this little tryst and a mistake on both her and Harry’s parts.</p>
