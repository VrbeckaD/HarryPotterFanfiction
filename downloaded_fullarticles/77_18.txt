  <u> Monday, July 30th, 1990 </u>
</p><p>Harry wasn’t sure when it first started.</p><p>Had it started when Aunt Diana died? Had it been triggered by her (admittedly small) reaction to her death? (She had been much more concerned about Archie, and still was in many ways).</p><p>Had it started when she stopped having the accidental magic that Archie did?</p><p><b> <em>You’re forgetting something.</em> </b> A harsh voice hissed in her ear.</p><p><em> ‘Oh? And what’s that?’ </em> Harry asked. She knew she shouldn’t talk to it but–</p><p><b> <em>Maybe there’s just something wrong with you.</em> </b> </p><p>The monster inside her roared to life, the dark mass of energy twisting and writhing in her gut, snaking and coiling through her veins and leaving trails of ice that burned in their wake. <em> No! </em></p><p>Harry pushed down on it with all her might, her whole body shaking with effort as she broke out into a cold sweat. The beast finally quietened, leaving Harry feeling sick and nauseated. And then she decided that however it had started, the cause and effect was the same.</p><p>A monster like her shouldn't exist. That was an immutable fact seared into her brain, filled with restless nights where her magic was at once <em> there </em> and <em> not there</em>. Raging inside her like a demon locked in a cage.</p><p>Shaking her head, Harry wiped sweat from her brow. She really didn’t feel like going down to breakfast this morning. Mum and Dad might ask what was wrong, and Archie would be concerned, too.</p><p>With that decided, nine-year-old Harry Potter got out of bed, remaking it in that haphazard way of hers before getting dressed in some brewing robes. Ever since Harry was small and her Uncle Remus had gotten her a Junior Potions kit she had been obsessed with Potions. Her parents had thought it just a hobby at first, but they had soon learned how serious she was when Harry had proclaimed, at the age of seven, that she was going to become the best Potions Mistress in the world. Now that she was ten – or nearly so – she was a bit more realistic, and that realism came with goals.</p><p>That was why she knew that in order to become the greatest Potions Mistress in the world she'd need to train under the greatest Potions Master in the world.</p><p>Master Snape.</p><p><br/>

</p><p>Harry was just setting aside her last batch of Calming Draughts when her mum poked her head into the room. "Harry? How long have you been down here?" She asked, eyes full of concern.</p><p>Harry blinked, trying to divine the time by the length of the candles in the candelabras. "Not that long." She said. By her count, it really hadn't been.</p><p>Mum shook her head ruefully. "Come on then, a little late lunch won't hurt you." When Harry looked reluctant, she said, amused, "It'll all be there when you get back."</p><p>Harry let out a long bereaved sigh and quickly put her Potions things away with an ease and efficiency that came from long practice. Her mum no longer watched carefully as she cleaned and then stowed the knives away; she had been under constant supervision in her lab until last year when mum had decided she was responsible enough to be on her own before warding the place to hell and back. Harry found the alone time to be a blessed relief on her frayed nerves.</p><p>With a last longing look at her Potions lab, Harry slipped a couple Calming Droughts into her robes and clomped up the stairs after her mum, her fire retardant and acid retardant boots clunky yet serviceable. She reached the head of the stairs which opened into a large sitting room with dark stained wooden walls and floors with white accents, the sitting room holding Gryffindor red couches and armchairs in a semi circle around a coffee table covered in Quidditch magazines and some of father’s paperwork, a quill and inkpot beside it. Moving pictures hung on the wall as well as perched on the mantle above the fireplace on the far wall. There was a sliding glass door on one wall that led to the patio, which was cracked from a hex Uncle Sirius had thrown at dad yesterday. On Harry’s left were the stairs which led up to the bedrooms, and in a corner behind a partition was the kitchen.</p><p>Harry followed her mum into the kitchen to find Uncle Sirius, Uncle Remus, dad and Archie already there. She seated herself next to Archie and smiled at him, peering into his bowl of… was that mint chocolate ice cream and bacon? Archie grimaced. “It doesn’t taste that bad really.” He defended.</p><p>“And that’s the reason you’re playing with it instead of eating it?” Harry pointed out reasonably, and Archie put down his spoon from where he’d been idly stirring his ice cream with a sigh.</p><p>“It gives him something to do, at least.” Archie said in an undertone. “Other than the jokeline and visiting the children’s ward at St. Mugno’s, he doesn’t have much to busy himself with.” To distract himself from the gaping hole left by his wife’s death, he meant. Everyone in the family knew that Sirius struggled with depression on a daily basis. Aunt Diana’s passing was still fresh in their minds, and Archie and Sirius had been hit the worse with the loss. Both of them were having weekly visits with Mind Healers, but Harry knew in that way of hers that Aunt Diana’s death would always hang over them, now.</p><p>“Have you read the newest article of <em> The Prophet </em>?” Dad asked.</p><p>Sirius nodded, his face grim. “Bad news, that. Even if the poor girl’s family were a bunch of Death Eater scum.”</p><p>Harry blinked, and then looked down at the newspaper that was beside her.</p><p align="center">
  <em> HEIR GREENGRASS BRUTALLY MURDERED! </em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em> Ten-year-old Daphne Greengrass, Heir to the Ancient and Noble House of Greengrass, was found brutally murdered in her bedroom at 9 o’clock this morning. She was…  </em>
</p><p>Harry could read no more, for a memory suddenly swam to the forefront of her mind. She and her family had been invited to a party held by the Rosiers. Despite their Dark leanings, Harry was very good friends with their Heir, Aldon Rosier. She thought his parents mostly approved because they were looking for potentially suitable matches for Aldon in the future. Which Harry found distasteful on principal, not that she’d ever say that to them face to face. </p><p>She remembered. Daphne Greengrass had been at the party.</p><p><em> “Everyone knows that that mudblood whore you call a mother only married your father because of his money.” </em> </p><p>
  <em> “Perhaps he’s even playing around with the werewolf too. Everyone knows that James Potter and Sirius Black aren’t picky about who they spend their time with.”  </em>
</p><p><em>“What? Are you gonna cry, now that I’m not treating you like the </em><b><em>precious</em></b> <b><em>Girl-Who-Lived</em></b><em>?”</em></p><p>She remembered with blinding clarity when her magic had been <em> there </em> but <em> not there </em>, and then after that there had been reported destruction in some area in either the Muggle or Wizarding World, all unexplained.</p><p>She remembered how <em> angry </em> she had been at Daphne.</p><p>And how her magic had left, shortly thereafter.</p><p>She… she couldn’t ignore it anymore.</p><p>Harry held her head in her hands, her whole body shaking. She felt a warm hand touch her back where she was cold, cold, cold. The coldness wrapped around her like a vice, and she accepted it, taking it in and letting it consume her. Dark and infernal power was rising like a tide inside her, the dark mass surging to press up against the confines of her body, swelling before intensifying and then bursting outwards in an explosion of black swirling mist and glowing coils of green fire. </p><p>Terrified screams resounded throughout the room, and Harry coiled herself in her new form, looking at all the shocked and terrified faces in the room. And then she was gone, gone, <em> gone </em>.</p><p><br/>

</p><p>Remus Lupin and the rest of the family sat, quite shocked, in the wake of Harry’s abrupt departure. Their eyes were all turned toward the patio door. Or rather, where the patio door <em> had been </em>.</p><p>“What the <em> bloody hell </em> was that?!” Sirius asked, his eyes wild with fear and desperation. He turned to his son and looked him over, a sudden fear crossing his face as he put a hand on Archie’s shoulder and said, “Arch, are you-?”</p><p>“I’m fine, dad.” Archie said, gifting him a shaky smile. The smile dropped not a moment later. “But Harry–”</p><p>“What’s happened to my baby girl? Who did this to her? When I find out who did this I’m going to hex their balls off and replace them with their eyes!”</p><p>“James.” Lily said sternly, and James quieted.</p><p>“W-what do we do, Lily?” He asked. Sirius shook his head sadly at Remus and mouthed <em> “whipped.” </em> James elbowed him in the side, making him double over with a wince.</p><p>“First we gather information. As much as I’d like to go find Harry as quickly as possible, we can’t go off half-cocked in a situation like this one. We need to be absolutely sure of what we’re dealing with first.” Lily said, and though she said it with confidence, Remus could smell her anxiety.</p><p>That, coupled with her caution, intelligence and Ravenclaw tendencies much like Remus’s own made him come to the conclusion that she either already knew what Harry was, or wanted definitive proof before bringing it to James’s attention. Remus closed his eyes as he recalled a passage from a book he had read years ago.</p><p>
  <em> Obscurials are quite dangerous creatures, though tragic as well. They are born from a child that has been suppressing their magic from a young age, where their magic, for lack of a better term, goes quite wild. The child in most cases does not live past ten years of age.  </em>
</p><p>
  <em> (See Credence Barebones, Pg 98) </em>
</p><p>Remus looked into Lily’s eyes. There was a sadness there, a lingering fear that oozed from her pores like liquid poison. Lily met his gaze and her green eyes flashed with defiance. They held each other’s gaze, a deadly secret laying between them. </p><p>They looked away, and Remus’s mouth quirked up slightly. He knew that look. It was the same look she used to give them when they were being mean to–or quite honestly <em> bullying </em> Severus. The look that said she would defend him no matter what, that she wouldn’t give up on him just because being friends with a Slytherin made her life at Hogwarts harder than it needed to be.</p><p>She wasn’t going to give up on Harry. </p><p>The least Remus could do was do the same.</p>
