    <p>Graves didn’t want this. He did not want this. He’d never imagined that this would be something anyone could do to him.</p><p>Grindelwald had him. His fingernails dug into the skin of his jaw as he examined Percival, turning his head left and right as if he was a prized horse the wizard wanted to buy. His hands were bound together, cold metal looped around his wrists and preventing his magic from rising. He sat on the edge of the bathtub, legs outstretched in front of him while Grindelwald stood in the space between them.</p><p>“Are you quite done?” He asked, unable to take more of this probing and staring. He felt humiliated enough - humiliated by what he’d agreed to - and Grindelwald’s gestures made it worse. If this was the price he had to pay to live another day and see his rescue, then he would take it. But it didn't mean he had to like it.</p><p>Being so close to Grindelwald - the man who'd stolen his face and memories, the man who wore Graves’ face like a <em> coat </em> while no one noticed, the man who tortured him with a putout, almost bored expression when he refused to cooperate - being so close to that man made his stomach lurch, the foul taste of bile heavy on his tongue. Graves fought it. He didn't want to give Grindelwald the satisfaction of seeing him like this, not when he already felt so vulnerable.</p><p>Grindelwald frowned, but released him. Graves rubbed his jaw with the back of his hands, cursing Grindelwald for gripping him so tightly. Not that he expected him to be gentle, but still - his body ached enough all over not to add more to his pain.</p><p>Graves hated himself. Hated himself for becoming so weak, so delicate, so mellow. Yet agreeing to what Grindelwald wanted was the only thing he had to temporarily get out of his prison. The dark wizard probably got off on how much he could humiliate Graves before the latter snapped.</p><p>Grindelwald turned around and Graves glared at his back, wishing that he could maim with a look. If he had his way then Grindelwald would be a pile of ashes at his feet right now, and Graves would be overjoyed to pick his remains up and flush them down the toilets.</p><p>“You’re being ridiculous, Percival,” Grindelwald said, amusement in his voice - obviously reading his thoughts. “Relax, will you? It’s just lipstick.”</p><p>“Just lipstick?” Percival repeated incredulously. “Lipstick, in exchange for a meal so I don’t die in that hole you tossed me in!”</p><p>“Yes,” Grindelwald said calmly. “And there will be further rewards if you behave well. Now hold still.”</p><p>Graves was seething, but he did as he was told. He watched as Grindelwald twirled his wand in the air and made something appear in the palm of his hand. Small and round and gleaming silver. A lipstick.</p><p>He couldn’t even fathom how Grindelwald knew a spell to materialize lipstick out of thin air.</p><p>He stared as Grindelwald uncapped it before twisting the base of the lipstick, extending it in a practiced move. It was pink, almost glittering, and Graves felt himself pale. Grindelwald approached him again, holding the uncovered lipstick in front of Graves’ face, and nodded. “Yes, that color is the right one. Stay still, darling - you’re going to be perfect.”</p><p>Graves swallowed, his throat clicking. Grindelwald's words stirred something in his gut he wasn’t ready to examine. He did not say anything about the pet name.</p><p>He held still as Grindelwald tipped his chin up with two fingers. He placed his hand over Graves’ cheek, holding him steady, and with the other he started applying the lipstick, drawing it over Graves’ lower lip in one even stroke. It felt strange. Grindelwald told him to pursue his lips and he obeyed, feeling foolish. Grindelwald then used his fingers to carefully wipe the excess of lipstick, before making sure it was spread evenly over Graves’ lips, down to the corners of his mouth.</p><p>He repeated the gesture on his upper lip, and pulled back to look at him critically. Graves felt himself flush under his gaze, suddenly self conscious in a way he’d never been before. He knew he must look ridiculous - a forty year old man wearing pink, like a baby doll.</p><p>“You’re almost perfect,” Grindelwald praised quietly. “But…hmm.”</p><p>He took a handkerchief from his pocket and held it in front of Graves’ mouth. “Open up.”</p><p>Graves did. Grindelwald pressed the handkerchief inside, the material heavy on his tongue, then told Graves to close his mouth before opening it again. He withdrew the wet handkerchief, smudged with pink where Graves’ mouth had touched it, and hummed in satisfaction. “There you go. All clean and pretty.”</p><p>A few final touches and Grindelwald finally seemed done with him. Graves let out a shaky breath he didn't know he'd been holding, and his stomach growled loudly. Grindelwald smiled. “Eager for your reward, are you, doll?”</p><p>“I haven’t eaten in three days,” Graves retorted, licking his lips - eyes widening when he tasted the lipstick on his tongue. It was like cotton candy, sweet and sugary.</p><p>“I know, darling. But don’t you want to see how pretty you look first?”</p><p>Graves’ eyes darkened. No, he didn’t fucking want to see how fucking <em> pretty </em> he was because he wanted to <em> eat</em>, god damn it all. Grindelwald’s laugh told him the other man was reading his thoughts again, plain as day, which only made Graves hate him even more. But he slowly nodded, and Grindelwald waved his wand again, making a small mirror Graves owned fly from the cupboard under the sink to his own hands.</p><p>Graves stared at his reflection. His lips were now a light, shining pink, but it didn’t look ridiculous - in fact, it was almost appealing. It drew attention to them, making them look more plush and inviting, ripe for a kiss. He made a face.</p><p>His appearance was in total disarray, but the lipstick was pretty.</p><p>“If I want a bath, will you ask me to wear heels?” He mocked, giving the mirror back to Grindelwald.</p><p>“Would you want to wear heels?”</p><p>Percival made a disbelieving sound, turning his head away. “Of course not! What kind of man would want this?”</p><p>Grindelwald hummed. “You will, in time. We’ll sort you.”</p><p>“<em>I don’t fucking need </em> --”</p><p>“Dinner.”</p><p>Graves clasped his mouth shut.</p><p>By Merlin, how he <em>hated </em> that man. But he needed to survive. He swallowed and closed his eyes, trying to reign in the burning anger coursing through him. He’d been reduced to this - begging for scraps of food inside his own flat.</p><p>“Good girl,” Grindelwald murmured, snapping his fingers so the chain holding Graves’ handcuffs together broke. As tempting as it was, Graves didn’t try to attack. He knew it was hopeless to think he stood a chance, and Grindelwald knew it too. “Now. What do you want to eat?”</p><p>“Do I have a choice?”</p><p>“You will always have a choice. You just need to make the right one. Now, you behaved well. Anything you want, I’ll give it to you.”</p><p>Graves took time to think, past the ache in his gut. He suddenly felt dizzy with the endless possibilities offered to him. He pictured roasted meat, fruits, vegetables, even <em> chocolate </em> - anything, anything at all that was different from the piece of bread and the stale water Grindelwald had been giving him so far. His hands were trembling. He whimpered when a particularly bad stomach cramp made him double over, and immediately Grindelwald was at his side, petting his hair and soothing him as if he wasn’t the reason why Graves felt so fucking bad. “There, there. You poor darling, you need to eat.”</p><p>Percival’s eyes stung with unshed tears. He did not want to lean into Grindelwald’s touches, but he found himself doing it all the same. He was pathetic. Pathetic and starving. He took a deep, steadying breath and rose up, away from Grindelwald. His legs barely supported him, but he could still stand.</p><p>“Soup,” he finally croaked out. “Soup, bread, and a fresh carafe of water.”</p><p>Grindelwald mockingly bowed his head. “It will be done exactly as you wish, doll. Do you need help getting to the living-room?”</p><p>Graves shook his head, defiant even as he swayed. “I’m fine.”</p><p>Grindelwald smiled. “Join me at dinner, then. Don’t do anything reckless, Percival.”</p><p>Then he left, whistling and heading towards the kitchen, and only when Percival was sure he would not come back did he allow his knees to give out under him. He grunted as his head made contact with the floor - he’d managed to control his fall somewhat, but still he ended up on his back, upturned like a beetle and sprawled on the white tiles to catch his breath.</p><p>God, but he hurt. He hurt so bad. The strokes of Grindelwald’s magic had yet to fade from his skin, painting his body a beautiful canvas of reds and purples and greens. Cuts and bruises, marks of his defiance. His ribs showed when he sucked in a breath, his hair felt dirty and matted, his breath was foul. This wasn’t the first time he’d been held and tortured, but it was the first time it went on for so long. Percival knew he wasn’t the closest to his colleagues, and he’d had a fallout with Seraphina the day before Grindelwald took him, but <em> still</em>.</p><p>They were Aurors. It was their job to notice the unnoticeable. What did it say, about him, that a dark wizard could steal his identity so easily? He’d failed them, all of them.</p><p>But it had been weeks, and still Grindelwald came home everyday and ate in Graves’ kitchen and wore his clothes and slept in his bed, and every morning he got up and went to work and signed his papers and took <em> his </em> Aurors on missions and partook in meetings, and <em> no one noticed</em>.</p><p>“Sweetheart?” Grindelwald’s voice came from the living-room, sounding faintly annoyed. It pulled Graves out of his thoughts, and he straightened as quickly as he could, before using the sink as leverage to help himself up. “Dinner’s ready.”</p><p>How long had he been lying there? How long had Grindelwald been waiting for him? His hands were shaking. Graves balled them into fists and stepped out of the bathroom.</p><p>The walk to the living-room was short, but Graves could have moaned at how good it was to feel plush, soft carpets beneath his bare feet, to hear the bustle of the city outside, to see for himself what Grindelwald had done to his flat.</p><p>Nothing, as it turned out. His eyes searched the room for anything seeming out of place, anything that could indicate that Graves himself had not so much as stepped foot in it in the space of two months. But Grindelwald, it seemed, had taken great precautions not to disturb any of Graves’ quarters. It all was painfully familiar, down to the way the cushions were arranged on the couch.</p><p>Grindelwald was waiting for him, lazily leaning against the back of the sofa. “Finally. I feared you were going to mope in that bathroom until your hair turned white.”</p><p>Percival didn’t reply. He let Grindelwald take in the sight of him - half naked, bruised and dirty - and shivered at the glimmer of satisfaction he saw in the other man’s eyes.</p><p>“Captivity looks good on you, Percival Graves,” Grindelwald purred. “Come. Let us eat.”  </p><p>-</p><p>Grindelwald was a man of his words.</p><p>Everything was exactly as Percival had ordered it. The table was set in the kitchen with Graves’ finest cutlery - perhaps to mock him even further - and his plate was filled with a steaming, golden broth, sprinkled with parsley. He took a seat and Grindelwald handed him a large, warm piece of bread. It smelt so <em> good</em>.</p><p>“Nothing in there is poisoned,” Grindelwald assured him softly when Graves eyed his soup warily. “I have no interest in killing you, Mr. Graves.”</p><p>“I guess not,” Graves said, picking up his spoon. The first mouthful he swallowed felt like salvation on his tongue, warming him from the inside and filling him. He groaned at the taste, completely ignoring Grindelwald in front of him.</p><p>“Percival,” Grindelwald chided him with a smirk. “Manners.”</p><p><em> Fuck </em>manners.</p><p>Graves made sure to slurp his soup as loudly as possible, which only earned him a sigh from his captor. A part of him hoped that maybe, just maybe, if he made enough of a mess, Grindelwald would find him disgusting and allow him a shower without Graves having to agree to anything in return.</p><p>His plate was empty sooner than he would have liked, and he leaned against the back of his chair with a sigh, hands resting over his stomach. He felt much, much better. Like he could actually hold a conversation with Grindelwald, instead of just drifting through it.</p><p>He grabbed the piece of bread on the table and started eating it bit by bit, chewing forcefully as he stared at Grindelwald who finished his dinner. The man set his cutlery down when he was done, pressing a delicate napkin embroidered with Graves’ initials to his lips, before sending both of their plates towards the sink with a wave of his hand.</p><p>Grindelwald steepled his fingers under his chin, and Percival crossed his arms.</p><p>“Stand up and turn around,” Grindelwald ordered out of the blue. “Now,” he added when Graves looked at him incredulously and opened his mouth to protest. “If you do so, I’ll let you take a blanket with you in the cellar.”</p><p>Graves froze. A blanket.</p><p>His cellar was a cold, damp place in which he stayed, alone, nursing his wounds while Grindelwald strolled in the city living his life. As much as the war had gotten him acquainted with survival in shitty conditions, in all the years since he came back he’d gotten quite used to his little comfort. Being a Graves and holding a position such as Director of Magical Security meant he could indulge in a few guilty pleasures. Tailored clothes, collector’s books and the finest aged whiskey he could buy were such indulgences.</p><p>When Grindelwald came, Graves had not been defeated in years, and such pride was his downfall. To find himself imprisoned in his own cellar, bruised and starved, his clothes turning into rags as weeks went by, was a lesson. To realize that no one noticed Grindelwald’s little masquerade was a noose, wrapped tight around his throat - choking him until he was but a hollow, silent husk of his former self.</p><p>He had no cot in the cellar. Graves did not sleep : he fainted, out of sheer exhaustion, lying down on the floor, curled up on himself like a child in a desperate attempt to feel warm. Grindelwald visited him every fortnight to gain information, and when Graves refused to cooperate he made his pain worse.</p><p>Having Grindelwald invite him to dinner had been a beacon of light, a piece of heaven in hell’s despair. It did not matter if he had to slap some colors over his bitten, raw lips. Lipstick was better than starving to death inside his house as a result of his own failures.</p><p>And now Grindelwald - having held his promise to let Graves eat - offered him a blanket.</p><p>Such a simple gesture shouldn’t have mattered as much as it did.</p><p>Slowly, Graves stood up and stepped away from the table, turning around to show Grindelwald his back. His dirtied shirt hung low on his frame, worn thin, ripped in most places. It offered no protection against the cold, no protection against the blows Grindelwald rained down on him, no protection against Grindelwald’s disapproving <em> tsk </em> as he took him in. Percival kept his head down, only darting his eyes to the side to gauge Grindelwald’s next move.</p><p>As silent as a wraith, the dark wizard stood up as well, circling the table to stand at Graves’ back. A warm, possessive hand came to rest low on his hips, and Percival swallowed audibly.</p><p>He felt fingers trail up his back, until a hand clamped down on the nape of Percival’s neck, making him tense all over. He felt like prey under that grip, heart racing, body weakening. Grindelwald murmured something in his ear, in a language Graves did not understand, but he felt calm wash over him, as if he were settling in front of a fire on a cold night. He relaxed minutely, a small sound escaping his throat as Grindelwald gently stroked the sensitive skin of his neck.</p><p>No one spoke. Graves did not know how long it lasted, this strong, warm presence at his back which against all odds made him feel safe instead of terrified. He knew it was a spell being used, but he welcomed the feeling all the same, at least for a little while. He could, if he closed his eyes, imagine that Theseus was there instead  - his friend, once his lover, lost to the other side of the sea. He could imagine that he himself wasn’t lost, that his hands weren’t chained, that his ribs didn’t show.</p><p>Grindelwald tugged at the collar of Graves’ shirt to kiss his shoulder, and Graves shuddered, his daydream broken. This was<em> not </em> Theseus. This was a wanted man, who’d beaten, humiliated him, and locked him up in order to make him sing. He bit the inside of his cheek in an effort to clear his head, feeling uncomfortably warm and drowsy, and turned around.</p><p>“Steady, doll,” Grindelwald murmured, taking Graves’ face between his hands, fingernails just short of digging into the skin. “We’re going to make a deal. Are you with me?”</p><p>Percival blinked, then stifled a yawn with difficulty. Grindelwald sighed and murmured something else, and Graves felt more awake, more alert.</p><p>It was terrifying how quickly this man could reduce him to nothing but a body, responding to whatever spell Grindelwald threw his way.</p><p>“A deal?” He finally managed to say.</p><p>“Yes. Do you know what happened today? Tell me.”</p><p>“I ate,” Percival said numbly.</p><p>“That’s right. You ate. And why did I let you eat?”</p><p>“Because I…” Percival worried his bottom lip between his teeth, trying to think, his cheeks reddening. “I let you put lipstick on me?”</p><p>Grindelwald hummed in approval, eyes dropping to Percival’s lips. “You did. Is that all?”</p><p>“Y - you told me I’d have a blanket if I stood up and turned around.”</p><p>“Very good,” Grindelwald praised quietly. He snapped his fingers, and Graves stared in disbelief as the biggest, warmest blanket he owned flew from the armoire inside his living room only to land in Grindelwald’s arms. The man unfolded it, almost reverently, before draping it across Percival’s shoulders, satisfied when Graves’ shivering subsided. “Do you understand, then, how this is going to work?”</p><p>Graves shook his head negatively.</p><p>“You can ask me for anything. From now on, I want to make your stay here as my prisoner more agreeable. But in exchange, you will have to agree to the price to pay. It will always be fair, equivalent to your demands. What sacrifices are you willing to make to avoid pain, Percival Graves ?” Grindelwald let that sink in, lips curling up in front of Graves’ obvious distress. “So tell me. Is there anything you desire?”</p><p>Percival wrapped the blanket tighter around himself.</p><p>He did not know what he wanted. Or well, he did - but he doubted Grindelwald would agree if he said, “Surrender yourself to MACUSA and give me my life back, you utter dickhead.”  </p><p>So he thought - what did he want? What did he need? Up until a couple of hours, it had been to be healed, to be given water and food. But Grindelwald had come, had taken Graves upstairs, supporting his weight, and he’d made him feel better.</p><p>“<em>You’re so weak," he’d murmured in Graves’ ear, almost amazed by that fact. Graves coughed, legs shaking. He knew that if Grindelwald dropped him he’d fall. “Have I been treating you that badly?” </em></p><p>
  <em> “Fuck’ off,” Graves mumbled out of habit, but the words were barely audible. The truth was, he was as weak as a newborn foal, barely able to stand much less fight back. He could only follow Grindelwald’s guidance and try to make as little distressed noises as he could, even though Grindelwald’s smile told him he knew. He always did. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Slowly, the both of them marched to the bathroom, but Graves couldn’t understand why. He avoided his own reflection in the mirror when Grindelwald sat him down on the edge of the tube, then kneeled before him. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> His hands settled on Graves’ thighs, rubbing soothing circles onto his skin through what remained of his pants. As he worked Graves felt warmth spread through him, sending tingles up his spine, and he shivered helplessly. The aches in his body subsided, little by little, until all he had left was exhaustion and burning eyes. He wanted to weep. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> “There you are,” Grindelwald said, and there he was. </em>
</p><p>He did not know why Grindelwald had wanted him to wear lipstick, nor had he cared. Not when he would be able to eat.</p><p>Of course, there’d been the possibility that Grindelwald was mocking him. That he’d paint Percival’s lips only to send him back to his prison, made to feel further humiliated and helpless. But if there was one thing Graves had learned as Grindelwald’s captive, it was that the wizard was a man of his words.</p><p>If Grindelwald promised to hurt you, then he would make sure you the pain was tenfold what you feared. If he promised to come back a couple of days later at a specific time because he was away on business, then he would come back to you exactly when he’d said he would. If he promised you a meal, then you would eat. If he promised you a blanket, then you’d get it.</p><p>If he offered you a deal, then you had better accept it.</p><p>“I want a shower,” he finally said, defeated, exhausted.</p><p>In front of him, Grindelwald grinned, victorious. “And you shall have it. The bathroom is yours. Go there, shave, wash your hair, brush your teeth and come back to me.”</p><p>“For what price?” Graves asked, mouth dry.</p><p>Grindelwald leaned in close, hand on Percival’s arm, lips brushing against the shell of his ear. “You have to give me a kiss.”</p><p>Graves’ eyes widened, his pulse quickening, a stab of fear lancing through him. He'd hoped to God Grindelwald wouldn't be interested in him in that fashion, and he hadn't been. He <em> hadn't</em>. What changed? Was he bored? “No.”</p><p>“Then I’m afraid this is the end of your stay here, my dear. Shame. You really <em> are </em> quite dirty. For a man of your status, being reduced to less than a human must be terrible.”</p><p>“Shut the fuck up,” Graves seethed, backing away. “Don’t pity me when you’re the reason I’m in that fucking state.”</p><p>“Am I?” Grindelwald said. “At least I am offering to take care of you. Tell me, Percival - how long has it been since I replaced you?”</p><p>Graves reeled, as if physically struck. He didn’t want to reply, he didn’t, but the answer was burned into his brain, carved onto his tongue, day after day that passed where <em> no one noticed. </em>“Two months, a week and five days.”</p><p>“That’s right,” Grindelwald acquiesced, inclining his head. “And I, just like you, am tired of it. You’re an interesting man, Mr. Graves. I refuse to lock you up any longer. Accept my terms. You will only feel better for it.”</p><p>“I’d belong to you. How’s that an improvement?”</p><p>“Percival, please. You will be fed, clothed, you will sleep in a bed at night, you will be allowed everything you want save for freedom. And, my dear - I never said where you should kiss me,” Grindelwald retorted lightly. “You're the one who jumps to conclusions, but as pretty as you are, even I have standards. You're not exactly a sight to behold right now.”</p><p>Graves opened his mouth, then closed it. Grindelwald was right - he’d never said whether the kiss was a friendly one or an amorous one. He was the one who was frightened of its implications.</p><p>“A kiss on the cheek,” he said firmly. “Nothing more.”</p><p>“Nothing more,” Grindelwald echoed, smiling. “You know the way to the bathroom, doll. Make it quick.”</p><p>-</p>
