    <p align="left">“Are you done chewing on that?”</p><p>Happily wagging her tail, Princess discards the ragged hat on the floor and turns to her water bowl.</p><p>Harry shakes his head at her and then leans back in his chair, resting a foot on the counter. He drops his head back onto the backrest, watches as the raindrops drum against the charmed ceiling. The rain is getting heavier—the day darker, the smell of a thunderstorm clinging to the air even in the warmth of the shop. Harry sighs, following the trails of the drops as they glide down the ceiling and disappear behind the edge of his charm. It’s soothing, the sound of the rainfall, the way the drops merge and push at each other on their way down. He’s missed it.</p><p>The rain picks up, thick and loud, and Harry slumps against the chair, closes his eyes for a moment—smiles.</p><p>He’s home.</p><p>And then there’s the sudden noise of the door being roughly opened and shut, a gust of wind on his face. A wet, “<em>Fuck</em>.”</p><p>He sits up, heartbeat quickening, and then stands up altogether as the cloaked, drenched figure turns around to reveal none other than Draco Malfoy, cursing under his breath, pulling back the hood of his robes as he slumps against the door, threading his fingers through soaked strands of white-blond hair.</p><p>Their eyes meet, and Malfoy’s fingers still. His gaze flies from Harry to the shelves of the shop, to the ceiling, to Princess, who’s walking up to him to sniff his shoes and ask for pats as she does with every customer: standing on her hind legs, scratching a paw to the person’s thigh. Then it falls back on Harry, flying from his hair, messily tied into a bun, to his clothes, his face, his hand, gripping the edge of the wooden counter.</p><p>Harry’s too busy having a moment of awkward self-awareness—a moment of unexpected nervousness—to read the expressions that cross Malfoy’s face. Then Malfoy turns and, with a shake of his head, grips the handle of the door.</p><p>The shop flickers with light as a fresh bolt of lightning illuminates the sky outside, thunder roaring almost immediately after. Malfoy hesitates.</p><p>“I’d cast a sheltering charm around myself before going out there,” Harry says, heart in his throat. He’s not quite sure why he’s so breathless. So...full of <em>feelings. </em>It’s been years since he’s seen Malfoy. Years, since he’s heard from him.</p><p>It hasn’t been so long since he’s last wondered about Malfoy, though. Since he’s last daydreamed about seeing him again.</p><p>“Yes, well,” Malfoy drawls, turning around slowly, a bitter, almost pained smile taking over his sharp features. Harry’s fingertips tingle from the sound of that voice. “That’s not exactly an option, so.”</p><p>“So…”</p><p>“So, Potter, you should probably stop gaping at me and offer me a hot drink and a comfortable seat in front of your hearth so that I don’t die from hypothermia in this—this—” He gestures around. “Cacophonous assault of the senses.”</p><p>“Y-Yeah. Yeah, sure,” Harry stutters, mind staggering. “Or you could just—you know, use a basic drying—”</p><p>“Turn that thing away from me!” Malfoy stumbles back, eyes fixed on the tip of Harry’s wand. Harry raises his hands, taken aback, and then points his wand to the floor before the fireplace and conjures a cushion. He watches as Malfoy pauses, regards him carefully, and then elegantly folds his soaked figure in front of the fire, extending his robes over his legs before lifting his palms toward the flames.</p><p>The wood crackles, the rain patters against the ceiling and runs down the street, and Harry’s thoughts seem to follow the uneven rhythm of it all as he wonders what to say now, what to do. Sitting down on his chair again feels out of place, but it’s not like he can just stand there until...until what? How long is Malfoy even planning to stay? Talking seems absurd, but the silence stretching between them is making his mind reel, and soon he feels like he hasn’t felt in years. Itchy, desirous. On edge. He can feel the need to know, to find out more, crawling under his skin; the <em>pull </em>in his chest at not knowing what’s going on in Malfoy’s mind. It’s like it’s never left him—like that unrestrained craving to decipher Draco Malfoy has simply been lying dormant all these years, merely waiting for Malfoy to show up and turn his world upside down.</p><p>He’s distracted from his thoughts when Malfoy says, “Do you have a hot drink or not?”</p><p>“A—? Oh.” Harry silently curses himself for forgetting. “Yeah. Coffee or tea?”</p><p>“Tea, please. With one and a half spoonfuls of sugar.”</p><p>As Harry boils the water on his travel kettle, waving his wand slowly to heat its bottom at the right speed, Malfoy’s head moves up almost timidly. He takes a peek at the Venetian masks stocked on one of the tallest shelves. His back is almost completely to Harry, but he must sense Harry looking at him, because he quickly shifts his gaze to the flames.</p><p>But then Princess lies down beside him, stomach up and ready to be scratched, and soon his gaze is shifting again. It’s reluctant, as if he’s too proud to admit, even to himself, that he’s curious. He first eyes her suspiciously, and then, as he brings his fingers to the fur of her chest, he rakes his gaze over the rows of doobries that fill the shop from floor to ceiling. Harry watches, amused, as Malfoy’s expression shifts when he reaches the side of the room opposite the hearth, contorting further and further the more he takes in.</p><p>When he spots the Bavarian Wolpertinger that sits near the shop entrance he seems unable to hold it in anymore.</p><p>“Potter, what—what in the world is all this?”</p><p>Harry pours the water in a mug—the blue one, Bratislava, spring of 2001—and sinks the infuser in it, leaving the herbs to slowly tint the water.</p><p>“This happens to be my life now.” He grabs a spoon and the sugar bowl from under the counter and hands them to Malfoy. “I’m not pouring you one and a <em>half </em>spoonfuls of sugar. Do it yourself,” he says when Malfoy scowls at him. He hands Malfoy the mug, too, and then sits on the floor beside him before he can think better of it. “What about yours?”</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>“Your life,” Harry says. “This is what I do now: I travel, meet people, visit new places, and then I come back home in winter and I sell the things I’ve collected through the years, alongside their stories, to people I feel I can trust them with.” His eagerness is pouring out of him as plain as day and he knows it; he can't bring himself to care. “What about you? I haven’t heard from you in years.”</p><p>Malfoy side-eyes him as he brings the mug to his lips to blow at the slow tufts of steam rising from it. There’s an answer to Harry’s question, he can see it in Malfoy’s eyes, but Malfoy isn’t going to give it to him that easily.</p><p>It’s weirdly exhilarating, knowing he’ll have to earn it.</p><p>“You’ve been travelling the world for years,” Malfoy huffs, “and you still haven’t learnt how to dress properly?”</p><p>Harry laughs. It’s just a little giggle, just a silly snicker, but it awakens something inside him. A smile he can’t hold back; a warmth he can’t pinpoint.</p><p>“What’s wrong with my clothes? They’re comfortable, which is kind of crucial when you’re travelling.”</p><p>“And I guess that’s also why your hair looks so…?” Malfoy’s lips quirk, his gaze travelling to Harry’s bun. “<em>Unsightly</em>? For travelling purposes.”</p><p>“Can’t have the ladies and gents falling for me when I know I’m going to leave, now can I?”</p><p>“Oh of course, of course. So charitable of you to spare their feeble souls from falling for your effervescent charm and blinding beauty.”</p><p>“And my vault full of Galleons,” Harry adds.</p><p>“<em>And </em>your vault full of Galleons.”</p><p>As Malfoy takes a tentative sip of his tea and Harry tries to make sense of the fact that he’s having an actual civil conversation with Draco sodding Malfoy, another bolt of lightning flashes into existence, the sound of thunder that follows closely not quite as loud as that of the ceaseless rain. It makes Harry feel enveloped. Makes life feel slow, small—simple, in a soothing kind of way.</p><p>Malfoy’s expression reflects quite the opposite feeling.</p><p>“I gather you’re not going to tell me why casting a protection charm around yourself so you could walk out wasn’t an option, either?” Harry waits a few seconds, but no reply comes. “I’m going to find out eventually, you know.”</p><p>“Oh, are you now?” Malfoy tries to sound offended, but Harry doesn’t miss the way his lips quirk prettily before he takes another sip. “Have much interest in my personal life, do you?”</p><p>“Always,” Harry jokes, and it’s only after a second that he considers that perhaps meeting an old enemy shouldn’t feel so much like meeting an old…friend. <em>Friends</em> bicker, enemies fight. But hatred, pain, fear, disdain…they’re feelings he mostly reserves for what he thinks is unfair in the world now. Feelings he once sought out, but now usually avoids.</p><p>Freedom is what he seeks now. Adventures. <em>Life</em>, and the thrill that comes with it. Stories, people, moments. Things that he can bring back with him when winter comes and he returns home. Home to the Weasleys, to his best friends. Home to his little shop, to the language, and the food, and all the things he never knew he loved about London when he was a kid—all the things he never had a chance to appreciate, to miss before.</p><p>It takes him a moment to realise that Malfoy has fallen silent. He’s looking down at his tea, side on to Harry, and the last, barely visible clouds of his tea are rising to his fair eyelashes, gliding in between his fringe, all wavy and unkempt from the rain despite his earlier efforts.</p><p>He looks cosy, Harry thinks.</p><p>“Well, for what it’s worth,” Harry says, heart warming at the way Malfoy side-eyes him without lifting his head, “I don’t mind you asking me about my life if you want.”</p><p>Malfoy’s eyes crinkle at the sides when he smiles, when he huffs at Harry’s suggestion, as though it’s preposterous to think he’d care.</p><p>“I do have one question,” he admits a moment later, his eyes darting around again. “What the hell, Potter?”</p><p>“What!” Harry laughs. “It’s not so weird!”</p><p>“Your glasses are curled golden wires. Your teacups are wavy. You’re wearing a—a patchwork—purple and yellow—<em>poncho</em>.” He sounds dismayed. “When I imagined your career, I thought that you’d, I don’t know, sign up for Auror Training, give up within a year, and turn into a professional Quidditch Seeker, constant winner of Witch Weekly’s Most-Charming-Smile Award. Just because you’re, well, <em>you</em>.” He says the last bit a heartbeat too late for it to be anything but an afterthought.</p><p>“So you thought about my future when we were at Hogwarts.” Princess curls up by his side, and Harry pets her. “Interesting.”</p><p>“As if you didn’t do the same!”</p><p>“I did,” Harry admits. “I thought you’d turn into an evil Ministry worker like your father.”</p><p>Malfoy grimaces.</p><p>“Yeah, that’s what he expected of me. Not that it turned out well for him.” He takes another sip of his tea. “What I wanted, though, was to play Quidditch professionally. I guess I thought being famous would bring me happiness.”</p><p>“So you wanted to play Quidditch, and you also imagined <em>me</em> being a Quidditch player? Did you think of us as teammates, or were we the Seekers of opposing teams?”</p><p>“I didn’t think of <em>that</em>,” Malfoy snaps, blushing slightly.</p><p>“Wee little Draco, fantasising about competing against his nemesis for the rest of his life,” Harry teases.</p><p>“That’s it.” Malfoy puts down his empty mug. “I’m out of here.”</p><p>As if reminding him why he’s still there in the first place, thunder roars outside again, the rain crashing into the window with a gush of wind. Malfoy grimaces; his shoulders slouch, and he brings his hand to the fur of the small dog curled between them.</p><p>“I hate you, I hope you know that.”</p><p>Harry snickers. “You too, Malfoy,” he says. “You too.”</p><p align="center">***</p><p>By the time the storm starts to fade away, he’s telling Malfoy the story of how he did, indeed, quit the Aurors—<em>after eight weeks, actually, not a year!—</em>as he caresses Princess.</p><p>When he got her from the rescue centre, he never knew how much he’d rely on smoothing her fluffy brown coat—how much her fur, just long enough that he can run his fingers through easily, would help ground him. It’s just so soft, especially after he’s brushed it...stroking it is almost as soothing as it is to play with her perky black ears, which she loves even in her sleep.</p><p>He’s glad she’s decided to curl herself by his knee for a nap. He can feel the nervousness pooling in his chest, his fingers twitching as he speaks.</p><p>He concludes his story with a sigh and a bite to his lip as he waits for Malfoy to ask something else, to tell him something else. But then Malfoy leans forward, stretches his robes a bit. By the time he pulls himself to his feet, Harry’s standing too, palms sweaty.</p><p>“I guess it’s time for me to—” Malfoy starts at the same time as Harry says,</p><p>“There’s still a few hours until I close, if you want to—”</p><p>They both fall silent. The way they’re occupying the space feels off, feels forced, and Harry regrets ever deciding that owning a small shop would be cosy and familiar. He swallows as Malfoy busies himself with his robes, and then, when Malfoy takes a step toward the door, Harry blurts out a messy, “Will I—Will I see you around?”</p><p>Malfoy snorts.</p><p>“Careful, Potter,” he murmurs, almost to himself, as his fingers linger on the doorknob. “One might think you actually enjoy my presence.”</p><p>“I still have to find out about your life these days, remember?” Harry says with a shrug, hoping Malfoy will believe his nonchalant display.</p><p>Casting one last glance to Princess, Malfoy sighs.</p><p>“Good luck with that,” he says. His eyes find Harry’s one last time as he opens the door, and then he’s gone.</p>
