  <b>An Acceptable Risk.</b>
</p>
<p>The -sadly- already familiar reek of Pot-no-<em>Harry’s </em>inability to cook greets Severus as he steps out of the Floo. He stills beside the hearth, shudders instinctively, and contemplates scarpering. <em>‘There’s shepherd’s pie at Hogwarts.’</em></p>
<p>Then the sound of Po-no-<em>Harry’</em><em>s</em> happy humming and enthusiastic pan-rattling reaches his ears, and he smiles despite the smell. <em>‘I’m doomed’</em>  he sighs, and heads towards the kitchen.</p>
<p>P-no-<em>Harry</em> welcomes him via cheeky blown kiss and, as his heart swells with the simple joy of being here, Severus realizes that, terrible cooking aside, Harry is an acceptable risk. He is safety, hope, delight. He is— happiness.<br/> </p></div>
