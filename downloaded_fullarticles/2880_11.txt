    <p>It was a drizzly, mundane Thursday morning in October and Archie McMorran was stirred by a quiet sound in his ear. He rolled over to see the source of the sound, only to discover Sylvester, his Bowtruckle, who was stood precariously on his pillow, trying not to fall over. </p>
<p>"Hi Sylvester," Archie said in a tired voice as he stretched his arms. He threw his duvet off and his feet found his fleece-lined slippers on the cold, morning floor. The other Hufflepuff boys were still asleep under their quilts and Sylvester tugged at Archie's pyjama sleeve. </p>
<p>"Yes, alright Syl, give me a second!" Archie laughed, as the Bowtruckle climbed up onto his shoulder and up into the boy's tousled, brown locks.</p>
<p>"Well, I hope you're enjoying yourself Syl," said Archie, "but Bumble will be back soon and if he sees you there, then you're in trouble." Bumble was Archie's owl, (short for Owlbus Bumbledore.) He was a gorgeous tawny owl with feathers in every shade of brown and magnificent wings, although he wasn't very fond of Sylvester the Bowtruckle. </p>
<p>Archie looked out of the high, circular windows in the Hufflepuff Dormitory, to see the dew glazed grass, which rippled in the early morning wind, with sunlight bouncing off the spiderwebs. He turned back to the task at hand; wrestling Sylvester off his head and getting into his clothes. Having succeeded with the former, Archie put on his robes, picked up his wand from his bedside table, put it in his inside pocket and made his way up to the Great Hall for breakfast.</p>
<p> As he sat down at the table and grabbed a piece of buttered toast from the rack, his favourite teacher, Professor Edwardson, came bumbling down the Great Hall towards where Archie was sat.</p>
<p>"Archie, my lad! How are you today?" he asked, with his tea stained napkin still tucked into his shirt collar. </p>
<p>"Not bad sir. I've got Potions first but Care of Magical Creatures later, so that'll be a godsend!" Archie replied with a grin. Sylvester popped out of his inner pocket to wave at Professor Edwardson.</p>
<p>"Morning Sylvester!" He said as he caught sight of the Bowtruckle. "Now Archie, I wanted to ask you if you've learnt that Rimsky Karkaroff piano piece yet, Eleanor needs it for the concert on Monday."</p>
<p>"It's all done Professor, don't worry!" Archie said, as he polished off his toast. </p>
<p>"Super. You're a gent Arch. I'll see you at lunchtime. Don't be late!" </p>
<p>"I'll try sir!" Archie chuckled. He drank the remainder of his Pumpkin Juice before getting up to go and get his bag, ready for Potions with Professor  </p>
<p>                                  *</p>
<p> Archie was stood outside the door to the Potions Classroom along with the other Hufflepuffs and Gryffindors in his year. A patter of footsteps was heard from along the corridor, as a blonde, flustered girl came hurling around the corner, with her books slipping from her arms, reminiscent of trying to catch a lost bar of soap in a bathtub. </p>
<p>"Hi Mais," Archie said as he grabbed the girl's books as they inevitably fell from her hands. Maisie Smyth, a Gryffindor, was Archie's best friend, due to a shared interest in magical creatures and both feeling slightly out of place in the school. </p>
<p>"Hey Archie," gasped Maisie, trying to catch her breath. "I'm not late, am I? Hagrid wanted to talk to me about his new Bowtruckle." </p>
<p>"No, you're alright. I'd better go and see Hagrid later, I can't wait to see wh-" Archie faltered, as a voice bellowed through the corridor. Slughorn had arrived and had told them to enter. </p>
<p>                                *</p>
<p> "Now class, today we're going to be brewing the Wit-Sharpening Potion. Now, find a partner, get to your workbenches and we'll crack on, shall we?”</p>
<p> Archie and Maisie gave each other a glance, followed by a small smirk as they walked towards a bench near the back of the room together. They grabbed the instructions on their desk, and began organising their ingredients. </p>
<p>“Hey, how's Sylvester today?" Maisie asked, as the Bowtruckle climbed out of Archie's pocket at the mention of his name.</p>
<p>"He's alright. A bit clingy as per usual," he replied, as Sylvester scuttled across the table to Maisie's arm. "Did you hear about the visitor next week?" Archie said, struggling to contain himself on the matter. </p>
<p>"Yeah I did. I'm so excited!" Maisie squealed, causing a few heads to turn in her direction. </p>
<p>"You two at the back, settle down now," Slughorn said. </p>
<p>"Sorry Professor," Archie replied, as he added the Armadillo bile to the cauldron and gave it a stir. </p>
<p>The two carried on talking and before they knew it, Slughorn proclaimed "Right class, that's the end of the lesson. Come up to the front and present your Wit-Sharpening Potions!" Archie and Maisie walked up to the front with their cauldron and placed it down in front of Slughorn. </p>
<p>"Right you two, let's see if this Potion works!" he chortled as he drew a mouse from underneath his desk. Archie began to worry now if he'd added the right amount of ginger roots, as it was being tested on an animal. Slughorn poured a spoonful of the Potion down the mouse's throat and it began to writhe about. Beginning to think he'd done something wrong, Archie started panicking a little, but shortly after, the mouse returned to normal, only something had changed. Archie heard a voice he didn't recognise to be one of his classmates or Slughorn's for that matter. </p>
<p>"Merlin's beard McMorran! What have you done?!" Slughorn exclaimed in a mixture of shock and delight. "It's talking!" Archie was utterly taken aback by this. He knew that Potioneers and spell makers had been trying for decades to make a concoction or an incantation that could make an animal talk, and he'd done it by accident in his Potions Class. </p>
<p>"I have to tell Professor McGonagall about this, not to mention write to the Ministry!" Slughorn gleefully said, surreptitiously looking for his parchment and quill, whilst trying to maintain concentration in this conversation. "Well done lad. How on earth did you do it?" He followed up, looking bewildered.</p>
<p>"No idea Professor. I think I might've been a bit heavy handed with the ginger roots but that can't have been it." Archie replied, beginning to recount what he put into the Potion. As the three of them pondered over what had happened, Sylvester snuck back into Archie's robe pocket with a sprig of something in his twig hands. </p>
<p>"Very well. Smyth and McMorran, 20 points to each of you, although I'm sure you'll receive more in the near future as word spreads around the Wizarding World of this incredible discovery. Class dismissed." </p>
<p>Archie and Maisie left the Potions Classroom with a slight sense of pride and befuddlement. As the door slammed shut behind them, Archie said "What in the name of Merlin just happened?!" as a grin of pure joy and excitement spread across his face. </p>
<p>"No idea Arch. I just wish we could have got some of that Potion to test on some of your creatures, but Slughorn kept it," Maisie replied in slight disappointment. </p>
<p>"Do you think me that dim?" said Archie as his grin widened with a wink of his eye. He pulled a small vial out of his pocket with a bit of the Potion in it. He and Maisie beamed at each other and took off, running down the corridor, robes billowing out behind them, still smiling as their brains started whirring with ideas. Oh, what an interesting few days they had ahead of them...</p>
