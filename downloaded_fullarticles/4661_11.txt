    <p>The day the letter arrives is one of the happiest of Faith Lehane’s life. It shoots through the mail slot of her mom’s apartment and lands on the grimy hardwood floor, clinging to a puddle of sticky, dried beer that Faith’s mom had forgotten to clean up and Faith had made a point to <i>not</i>. She used to love helping her mom, cleaning up after her and taking care of her when she felt bad, but she’s not that innocent girl anymore. </p>
<p>Her mom’s passed out on the couch (as usual) so Faith doesn’t have to grab it up and run into her room to read it in the corner of her tiny closet, but she does anyway. The letter is addressed to Miss Faith Lehane on stiff, white parchment paper. It’s the first time Faith’s ever gotten mail. </p>
<p>The letter says crazy things; that Faith is a witch, and is expected to start the year at a school for witches and warlocks in Scotland called <i>Hogwarts</i>. What the hell kind of name is that?</p>
<p>At first Faith doesn’t believe it. It’s insane. Witches don’t exist, they’re fantasy creatures made up for little kids to day dream about, ones who still have the ability to believe. But still, Faith catches herself reading and rereading the crumpled pieces of paper she’s stuck in her secret hiding place under the removable floor board in her room. Could something this wild possibly be true?</p>
<p>But no, Faith doesn’t just not believe it, she <i>refuses</i> to believe it. Even <i>if</i> supernatural beings existed, it’s still impossible. Because something like this would mean Faith is <i>special</i>, would mean Faith is chosen for something more than her own miserable existence, and that would just never happen. </p>
<p>It’s not until an owl flies into her bedroom window, carrying a second letter, that she believes. </p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Faith was really stressing about how she was going to get herself to fucking <i>England</i> where she’s supposed to catch a train, but right before she’s about to walk to the bus station and catch a ride to the airport, hoping that the money she stole out of her mom’s wallet will be enough for a ticket, a car screeches around the corner of the building and pulls to a stop right in front of her. It’s a funny looking car, bright blue and...squished looking somehow. The driver pops out, a tall, thin guy with a wispy mustache and a British accent. </p>
<p>“’Ello, there! I heard you were going ta be needin’ a ride! We’ve got a lot of Americans this year.”</p>
<p>Faith just nods, not sure what the hell’s going on.</p>
<p>“Well then, hop in! Wait! Er—ya got your parents’ permission, didn’t ya?”</p>
<p>Faith nods again, not stupid enough to admit she forged the signature on the permission sheets which had arrived in her bedroom about a week after the letters. She left a note for her mom on the kitchen counter telling her she was leaving. If she ever realizes that Faith is missing and looks for her, she’ll find it. Probably won’t shed any tears about it either.</p>
<p>“Good, good. We’ve had some problems with that before. Well, up and at ‘em!”</p>
<p>Finally Faith opens her mouth. “Are you from Hogwarts?” she demands, her tone verging on rude. Good, the trembling fear she feels in her throat can’t be heard and won’t give her away.  </p>
<p>The man looks astonished. “Why of course! What else do ya think I’d be here for?”</p>
<p>Faith just shrugs and steps up the bright blue stairs (stairs on a car? and ones that seems to be moving slightly as she stands on them no less) despite still feeling unsure because really, why the hell not? What does she have to lose? Yeah, this guy could be some kind of serial killer but she highly doubts it. He looks like he weighs ninety pounds at most, and he knows about Hogwarts. She’ll take her chances. </p>
<p>The car (which is huge inside) zooms around at lightning speeds, stopping every so often to pick up other kids. Faith assumes they’re still in Boston until she sees a sign reading Austin, Texas zoom by her window. Her first encounter with magic and she’s taking it pretty calmly, she thinks, despite the jolt of shock she feels. After all, she’s seen a fuck-ton more than most eleven year olds. Faith sits in a corner seat and doesn’t talk to any of the other boarders. A slim brunette girl wearing glasses gets on in Texas. She sits down across from Faith and waves, but Faith looks pointedly away. The other riders include a shy looking raven-haired girl who’s trembling, three African American boys who appear to be triplets and are playing some sort of game that involves slapping each other on the head, the brunette girl, and a blonde boy who’s reading. Faith shrinks into herself, trying to disappear into her donated too-large gray hoodie, hoping she hasn’t made a mistake. </p>
<p>When the bus is finally filled to capacity (it takes a total of an hour, and Faith thinks they’ve probably been all over the country by now) the car unexpectedly lifts into the air, almost leaving Faith’s stomach on the ground. Soon the car has sprouted wings and they’re soaring through the clouds, towards Hogwarts and a better future, Faith’s sure. It just has to be. </p>
<p>*</p>
<p>The driver escorts the whole group, one by one, through the <i>freaking wall</i> of the train station, and then they’re left there alone as he waves once and disappears into thin air. The other kids chatter quietly together, seemingly unconcerned. They probably have heard tales of the train station from older family members, or something. Faith just stands still, clutching her small backpack to her chest, hoping her eyes don’t look too buggy. Her mom always told her that her big doe eyes made her look like her “sweet lil’ baby” even now that she’s grown. Faith scowls to counteract any effects her eyes could be having. </p>
<p>Once they’re hustled onto the train by the conductor, Faith settles herself into an empty cabin, hoping it will remain empty so she can be alone. Faith doesn’t have lots of heavy luggage that she needs help with shoving into the upper compartments like the other kids. Faith doesn’t have the books that she hears the other kids talking about. She sinks into the plushy booth and faces yet another window, scowling harder. </p>
<p>By noon Faith’s stomach is growling. She has all of the cash she stole because she didn’t have to buy a plane ticket, but she’s having a hard time breaking herself out of the trance that staring out of the window has put her in. Boston certainly doesn’t have countryside like this. Almost against her will, Faith feels herself relaxing slightly. She got out of her mom’s shitty apartment, at least for now. Nothing can be as bad as that place. </p>
<p>Finally she snaps out of it and digs through her backpack for her Batman wallet. She cautiously slides the glass compartment door open and steps out into the walkway, deciding she’ll have to hunt for a source of food.</p>
