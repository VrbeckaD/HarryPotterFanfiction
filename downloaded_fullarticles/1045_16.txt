          <div class="userstuff"><p>Like this, Primrose Potter was the sight to see, head tilted back, neck pink with kisses and a rising blush, shirt wrinkled, top buttons undone, bralette gashing through, bright hair tumbling out of her bun, mouth plush, red, open in a sigh.</p><p>Ginny always loved her perfect, her tidy, her Prim, but she loved her the most when she was two fingers deep into her cunt, and Prim's back arched, skirt splayed, when Prim tries, and fails to bite back a moan.</p><p>When Prim leans up, with wide, dewy glassy green eyes, and draws the bottom of her lip into a kiss.</p><p>Then Ginny fucks her deeper and kisses her back and revels in the fingers that tentatively grasp her head and trace her hair, in the convulsions of Prim's delicate form, in the gasp that sheâ€™s caught between her lips, and in the way when she draws back, Prim says her name like a prayer.</p><p>She loves the look of her Girl who Lived on a little death.</p></div>
