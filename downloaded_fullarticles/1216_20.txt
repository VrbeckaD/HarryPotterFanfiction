    <p>Sparrow Cottage was heaving with people, laughter and chatter crammed into the kitchen, living room and dining room, spilling out into the back garden, clinks of glasses and the sounds of people spotting old friends and the smell of the canapes rising up into the inky sky above. </p><p>Minerva had been surprised, but delighted, to receive the postcard. On the front, in black and white against a dramatic, rugged background, Harry Potter and Ginny Weasley laughing at one another, the train of her long, slender wedding dress rippling out behind her, her bouquet of lilies dropping slightly as the photo Harry clutched her close and kissed her. On the back, it had simply read, ‘We got married! It was a secret, sorry you couldn’t be there - please join us on the 31st of July from 6pm onwards so we can make it up to you. Address below - please let us know if you are bringing a plus one.’  </p><p>Minerva had arrived at half past six to find the part in full swing already, but tight security to get through. She gave her name, though realised it was unnecessary as she recognised the aurors on the gate as old students of hers. She greeted them warmly as they apologetically ran their dark magic detectors over her. </p><p>‘I hope you will get to enjoy some of the party,’ she said to them, wincing as she sipped the polyjuice potion antidote they gave her. </p><p>‘We’re in shifts,’ Williamson assured her. ‘I’m sure we’ll bump into each other later, Professor. Enjoy your evening - just go right in.’ </p><p>So she proceeded to the stone cottage, spotting busy, joyful crowds through the window already, including Hagrid’s massive frame. She left her gift on the table that seemed to have been hastily conjured up in the hall and pushed her way through the crowd, seizing a gillywater off a tray that floated past as she did, briefly pausing to congratulate Molly Weasley, who she had spotted refilling a tray of canapes. </p><p>‘I am SO sorry you couldn’t be there, Minerva,’ said Molly fiercely, her lips pursing. ‘I hope you’re not too offended-’</p><p>‘Not at all, I’m delighted they thought to invite me to thi-’</p><p>‘You know what the pair of them are like, once they get an idea in their head. No convincing them.’ </p><p>‘Indeed,’ smiled Minerva, thinking back with affection. </p><p>‘I mean, you’d have wanted to be there, wouldn’t you?’ Molly demanded. ‘To see the actual ceremony - a wedding is more than a big party, isn’t it?’ </p><p>Minerva sipped on her gillywater, and then asked, delicately, ‘where are the happy couple?’ </p><p>‘Oh, er… ‘ Molly squinted as she gazed around the crowded kitchen. ‘I’m sure I saw Harry in the living room… I have no idea where my daughter got to. Excuse me, I’ll just-’</p><p>And she was off, carrying the tray of smoked salmon blinis with her. Minerva continued through the crowd, giving a merry wave to Hagrid who was talking so enthusiastically with Charlie Weasley that his gesturing arm swept Demelza Robbins off her perch against the table. The clatter of glasses she brought down with her caused light jeers, and Gwenog Jones hurried forwards to help pick her up.</p><p>The dining room, on one side of the kitchen, seemed to be given way to dancing; Minerva had never been good at knowing who sang the latest songs on the wireless, but everybody in there seemed to be enjoying themselves - as she glanced through, she saw Hermione Granger’s bushy hair fly past as Ronald Weasley swung her enthusiastically around. Quite frankly, it looked dangerous, and not at all where she wanted to be. </p><p>She continued on to the living room, equally busy but filled with the rhythmic hum of more civilised conversation and snatches of laughter. She saw Kingsley Shacklebolt talking to Andromeda Tonks, and was about to go and greet them when she heard a cheerful voice. </p><p>‘Professor!’ </p><p>She turned to see Harry Potter beaming at her - she beamed back and kissed him on each cheek as she greeted him. She had seen him since his school days, of course, but perhaps there was something different now or perhaps she had simply never noticed him grow from a teenager into a confident, handsome young man, looking more like his father than ever. </p><p>‘Thank you for coming,’ he said, looking delighted. </p><p>‘Congratulations, Harry,’ she told him. ‘And happy birthday.’ </p><p>He laughed. ‘How on earth did you remember that?’</p><p>‘What?’ exclaimed the young woman standing beside him. Minerva recognised her - she’d been in Ravenclaw a few years ago - Higgles? No, Miss Higglesworth. ‘Harry, you didn’t tell me that!’ </p><p>‘Thought I’d handle two bludgers with one swing,’ he said with a shrug. ‘Professor, how are you?’ </p><p>‘You know, you are no longer at school,’ she said, amused. ‘You’re perfectly free to call me Minerva.’ </p><p>He chuckled. ‘Absolutely not. Never. I’m too scared you’ll take points off me.’ </p><p>‘It never seemed to bother you at school,’ she said with a sly smirk. His refusal to use her name did not upset or offend her - everyone said that at first. Within a few years they usually got used to the idea.</p><p>‘It certainly did, no one made me feel guiltier than you. Except perhaps Dumbledore.’ </p><p>‘Perhaps you might have behaved yourself more, then,’ suggested Minerva, which made Higglesworth snort with laughter and Harry chuckle. ‘Or at least come to a teacher now and then, rather than running off and solving adult problems yourself.’</p><p>‘I can only apologise for the absolute nightmare I must have been,’ he said, grinning sheepishly. </p><p>‘Do you know, I don’t usually get that sort of apology until my old students have children themselves,’ she said. ‘I vividly remember your father saying something similar with you perched on his knee. And now look at you. Married.’ </p><p>He tilted his head at her, grinning more broadly than ever. ‘My finest achievement,’ he said, and she could see that he meant it. ‘I-’</p><p>But he was interrupted by something colliding, hard, into his leg - it made Minerva start with surprise and take a step back, but he simply grinned and with a melodramatic groan, picked up the small boy who was squealing against him. </p><p>‘Hello, mate,’ he said proudly, hoisting the boy onto his hip with a slight bounce so that his blue hair flopped. ‘Have you been dancing?’ </p><p>‘Excuse me,’ mumbled Higglesworth, who had gone scarlet as the little boy giggled. She slipped away without a backwards glance - Minerva thought she saw Harry’s eyes follow her for a moment, but then he was grinning back at the boy. </p><p>‘This is Professor McGonagall,’ he told him. ‘She’s the Headmistress of Hogwarts. Professor, this is Teddy.’</p><p>‘Lupin?’ she asked quietly, and Harry nodded. ‘Hello, Teddy,’ she said, and the little boy smiled at her. She never knew what to say to really small children. Teenagers were easier. She always found herself, around small children, saying the sort of things she had hated as a child. Things like… ‘When I last saw you, you were just a baby,’ she said. </p><p>‘Oh,’ said Teddy, which was reasonable, as what were you supposed to say to that? </p><p>‘Professor McGonagall helped me out a lot at school,’ Harry told him. ‘You remember that story about the nasty lady that hurt my hand?’ Teddy nodded, and Harry nodded at Minerva with raised eyebrows. ‘Professor McGonagall shouted at her for me when she said I couldn’t be an auror.’ </p><p>The little boy smiled in such a way that it seemed to crumple Minerva’s heart - it was Nymphadora’s smile. Completely. ‘I did,’ she said, keeping her face pleasant. ‘I thought it was very important that your godfather become an auror. I’m informed I was right, and that he’s very good at it.’ </p><p>‘I don’t know about that,’ said Harry lightly. ‘You might want to go and speak to the man singing Jerusalem on the patio.’ </p><p>But a slightly pink tinge had appeared on his cheekbones, and he smiled at the floor before looking back at Teddy. </p><p>‘They want you to come and dance,’ Teddy told him. </p><p>‘Who does?’ Harry asked warily. </p><p>‘Ginny and Ron and Hermione and George-’</p><p>‘All right, all right, I get it,’ said Harry, shaking his head and grinning. He glanced apologetically at Minerva. ‘I’ve been summoned.’ </p><p>‘Quite all right,’ she assured him. She peered back into the kitchen to see Lee Jordan, in a circle of cheering onlookers, balancing a galleon on it’s rim on his nose. ‘I think it would be entertaining to go and give Mr Jordan a shock.’ </p><p>Minerva greatly enjoyed the rest of the evening - there were many old friends to catch up with, and many double-takes from old students who seem to panic as though they were doing something wrong. </p><p>But it was not until the very end of the evening, when it all started getting a little rowdier and she thought it was best she made her farewells, that she spoke personally to Harry again. He was in the front garden, apparently bidding Neville Longbottom and Hannah Abbott goodbye, when he caught sight of her. </p><p>‘Professor!’ His voice was so loud and exuberant that she immediately had to put her teacher face on to resist laughing. ‘Are you going?’ </p><p>‘I’m afraid I am, Potter,’ she said, noting with amusement his flushed face and slight sway. </p><p>‘Oh no,’ he said darkly, turning to Longbottom who was laughing, ‘she’s using my surname again.’ He looked back at her, grinning. ‘What have I done, Professor?’ </p><p>She might have been back in the old headquarters, looking over at James Potter. The only thing missing was Sirius Black at his side, ready to chip in with an extra witty comment. </p><p>She simply smiled at him, and said, ‘it’s been a wonderful evening, thank you so much for inviting me. My very best congratulations to you and your new wife.’ </p><p>‘Professor,’ he said seriously, ‘thank you for coming. Really, I owe you so much - not just the Umbridge thing, but the whole, you know, putting me on the Quidditch team and just, you know, putting up with-’</p><p>‘Nothing to put up with!’ she said hastily, exchanging an amused glance with Longbottom. ‘You know full well you were the favourite for both myself and Albus-’</p><p>Longbottom gave a melodramatic gasp and grinned at a tittering Hannah Abbott. ‘She admits it!’ </p><p>‘Professor!’ he exclaimed again, and to her surprise (but secret pleasure) he hugged her, causing her to stumble slightly under his weight. ‘You’re the best - I had to be an auror after that, couldn’t let you down-’</p><p>‘HARRY! JESUS CHRIST, HARRY!’ </p><p>Minerva was too busy laughing and patting Harry on the back to pay much attention to Ronald Weasley’s frantic shouts or Neville Longbottom’s hysterical laughter. </p><p>‘And my broomstick!’ Harry was shouting over her shoulder. ‘My first broomstick, that was an amazing broomstick, I miss my old Nimbus-’</p><p>‘HARRY!’</p><p>She felt Weasley pull him off, and saw his horrified, freckled face. ‘Professor, I am so sorry, he always gets like this-’</p><p>He was holding Harry by his collar, but Harry shoved his hand over Weasley’s mouth and continued. ‘And! And thank you for saying I wasn’t going to die when Trelawney made that prediction, that was a big weight off my chest-’</p><p>‘You’ve drank too much,’ Weasley said sternly, jerking his head out of the way of Harry’s fumbling hand. ‘Stop going round hugging everyone.’ </p><p>‘He’s all right,’ said Minerva wryly. ‘He’s not my student anymore.’ She smiled at Harry. ‘I’m very touched - I have to thank you, too, for defending me in Ravenclaw tower.’ </p><p>Harry scowled, and looked at Weasley. ‘Oh, he was a DICKHEAD-’</p><p>‘Yes, all right-’ said Weasley, exasperated. ‘Sorry again, Professor.’ </p><p>‘Good evening, gentlemen,’ she said warmly. </p><p>Harry looked back at her as though to say something, but did a double take over to his right, his face lighting up in joy. ‘HAGRID!’ </p><p>He wrestled past Ron and hurried away, leaving Minerva unable to hold her giggles back any longer. ‘Well,’ she said, ‘I’m very pleased to see him so happy.’ </p><p>Weasley sighed. ‘I reckon he’s safe talking to Hagrid for a bit before I have to babysit him again. Thanks for coming, Professor.’ </p><p>‘Make sure you tease him about this,’ she advised him, returning her expression to one of utmost sternness. They laughed, and she wished them goodnight, walking back out through the gate and down the dark lane to the apparation point. </p><p>There had been a moment, a horrifying, devastating moment, some years ago, when she had looked upon Harry Potter and believed that he was dead. The instant, powerful grief that had gripped her heart had forced images of him nervously walking towards her and sitting on the little three-legged stool, of her looking back at the little bundle on a doorstep during a cold November night, of a man, who looked just like him, holding up a gurgling baby and proudly saying, ‘you’ll have him to deal with in a few years, Professor M!’ </p><p>Yet now here he was, joyfully celebrating his marriage, very much alive. She was glad it was dark, as a few others were walking along the lane to the apparation point too, and she would hate for them to see the tears on her face.</p>
