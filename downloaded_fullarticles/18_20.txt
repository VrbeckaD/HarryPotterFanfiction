    <p>May 2nd, 1998. 2.13am.</p><p>“Salve amor.”</p><p>Hermione made the tiny crossed heart wand movement while shielding her arm with her robes, so that no-one else would see. As she did, she breathed the spell; quietly and quickly, but with feeling, just as Professor McGonagall had told them they would need to. If ever they used this rare and revered charm. “But tread warily,” her beloved teacher had warned, “for a witch or wizard can only use this spell once in their lifetime, and it comes at a price.” </p><p>Even those who usually paid only a tenth as much attention as Hermione did in class had focused on the professor’s warning when this spell was discussed. Every fifth year knew that the charm, once uttered, would serve to share their life force. It could save the life of the person to whom they promised their heart. But it would also mean that they would never love another. Could never marry another. Whether or not their feelings were requited by the recipient. For those in a happy marriage, it was a simple choice. For those in a relationship, it was a question of trust. And for those who, like Hermione, loved another from afar, it was a potential sacrifice. A partial soul bond which may or may not ever be completed by the person to whom it was given.</p><p>Hermione didn’t mind. If the feeling in her own heart wasn’t enough reason to cast it, even a fleeting thought of the pain that George would experience if Fred didn't make it was enough. Percy and Ron’s relieved sighs were further confirmation that she had made the right decision. And the look on Molly Weasley’s face, when she saw that her middle son was still breathing as his body was pulled from the rubble? </p><p>Hermione would breathe that look of joy and relief into her chest and use it to seal the space that had been left when she had given a piece of her own heart to save the life of Fred Weasley.</p>
