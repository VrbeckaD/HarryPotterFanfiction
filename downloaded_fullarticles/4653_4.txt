    <p>They couldn’t understand.</p>
<p>One moment, they were happily sitting in the back seats of the family car, squeezed close together to read the same exciting story, their parents holding hands in the front as they drove down a mostly-empty highway. </p>
<p>The next moment, a huge semi driving the opposite direction swerved sharply towards them, crashing down the barrier and straight into their car.</p>
<p>They had virtually no chance of survival. </p>
<p>As the two in the back seat clutched each other instinctively, the side their father had been driving from completely smashed in, there seemed to be complete silence. Even when pointless screams, arriving much too late, should have been piercing the air, a strange shimmering haze seemed to block out the horror for the two in the back. </p>
<p>Honestly, no one expected the twisted scrap of metal that was bent to the front of the huge truck to hold any survivors. One wouldn’t even have been able to recognize it as a car if it hadn’t been for the license plate barely holding onto it. The first responders were not shocked at all to find the horribly mangled bodies of a man and a woman in the driver’s and passenger’s seats. </p>
<p>They where shocked, however, when they looked in the back seats, only to find two teenagers, their dark eyes hazed with grief and shock. </p>
<p>A boy and a girl, who looked to be twins.</p>
<p>And neither of them carried even a scratch on their pale skin.</p>
