    <p class="zw-paragraph">Sharing a dorm with four other people probably sucks for every teenage boy, Scorpius thinks. Maybe it sucks a bit more for someone who is deeply uncomfortable with inconveniencing others but frequently wakes up in the middle of the night coughing his lungs out, though.</p><p class="zw-paragraph">
  <span class="EOP"> </span>
</p><p class="zw-paragraph">The curtains are still drawn around the other beds as he gets up, so maybe he hasn't disturbed anyone after all. It's only the start of October, but it's already freezing, so he grabs his coat as he passes the rack of hooks on the wall. What kind of lunatic opens a boarding school in an ancient Scottish castle and then refuses to shell out for heating, anyway? </p><p class="zw-paragraph">
  <span class="EOP"> </span>
</p><p class="zw-paragraph">The door creaks in protest as he pulls it open, and again as he tugs it closed. It's a louder noise than he's happy making in the dorm at this time of night, but leaving it open last week prompted Will Lockwood to give them and the rest of Slytherin house a thorough lecture on 'dorm safety'. At the time, it had seemed entirely unnecessary; less <em>useful advice</em> and more <em>newly appointed prefect trying to demonstrate responsibility</em>, but as Scorpius comes up the stairs, the lights in the common room are still on, which is against house rules. He's never encountered another student on any of his middle-of-the-night asthma attack walks - and apparently he won't tonight either, because the common room is empty. Most likely, a first year just forgot to turn the lights out on their way to bed. As he pulls his coat on, Scorpius reaches into the pocket for his inhaler and takes a few puffs. It hasn't been helping much, lately - he knows by now that the cold air is his biggest trigger, but autumn has never been this bad for him before. He flips the common room light off as he takes the stairs up to the ground floor, trying to ignore the rising fear and the growing tightness in his chest. </p><p class="zw-paragraph">
  <span class="EOP"> </span>
</p><p class="zw-paragraph">The thing about Slytherin house is that, for some unknown reason, it really is a dungeon. Scorpius never notices how stale the air is down there until he reaches the surface, and each breath tastes almost sweet in comparison. As he heads for the castle courtyard, the moment of sweet relief fades, replaced by the now-familiar sense that his lungs are collapsing. <em>Trying to breathe</em> won't make it any better, he knows, but he focuses on the movement of his chest anyway. He thinks it's pretty ironic that the asthmatic was assigned to the one house that's entirely underground, rather than any of the others that exist up here in the open air. Apparently air is pretty hard to come by these days. </p><p class="zw-paragraph">
  <span class="EOP"> </span>
</p><p class="zw-paragraph">The door to the courtyard is ajar - which, again, is weird, but Scorpius is exhausted because he can't sleep and shaky because he can't breathe and his heart is racing from his medication so he doesn't waste breath worrying about it. That is, until he steps outside and sees the reason the door was open and the common room light was on in the first place. There's a boy - a Slytherin, judging by the green of his school jumper - sitting on the edge of the fountain, his back to the door, a cigarette glowing in his hand. It's a little surprising, because this is <em>his</em> favourite can't-sleep-and-it's-4am spot and there's never been anyone there before, but still, Scorpius doesn't want to bother him. He's about to step back inside and find somewhere else to go, but something constricts in his throat and then he's coughing again. He rests a shaky palm against the wall to steady himself, but it passes quickly this time, and when he looks up the boy by the fountain is watching him. </p><p class="zw-paragraph">
  <span class="EOP"> </span>
</p><p class="zw-paragraph">Scorpius has to take a few steps towards the fountain before he recognises the boy as Albus Potter: one of his roommates, who probably hates him. Not that that's uncommon. Albus has obviously seen him, though, so it's not like he can hide away like he usually hides from his roommates.</p><p class="zw-paragraph">
  <span class="EOP"> </span>
</p><p class="zw-paragraph">"What are you doing here?" Albus asks as Scorpius approaches the fountain. </p><p class="zw-paragraph">
  <span class="EOP"> </span>
</p><p class="zw-paragraph">"Oh, well, I- I was awake because I was coughing, and I didn't want to disturb anyone, so I thought I'd come outside because I <em>really</em> can't breathe underground. Not that I can breathe up here either, to be perfectly honest." His tendency to ramble and the shortage of air reaching his lungs isn't a good combination. He doesn't want to, but he finds himself all but collapsing onto the ledge of the fountain next to Albus, and shoves a hand into his coat pocket for his inhaler again.</p><p class="zw-paragraph">
  <span class="EOP"> </span>
</p><p class="zw-paragraph">Albus doesn't say anything, just taps the end of his cigarette on the side of the fountain. The moon is almost full, and in its blue-white light Scorpius watches the ash float to the ground to join the two cigarette butts there. The smoke is acrid and harsh in his airways.</p><p class="zw-paragraph">
  <span class="EOP"> </span>
</p><p class="zw-paragraph">"Why are you here, then?" Scorpius asks once he feels his throat open up a little again, and Albus waves his cigarette in Scorpius's face in response. </p><p class="zw-paragraph">
  <span class="EOP"> </span>
</p><p class="zw-paragraph">"Why do you think?" Albus's tone is snappy, but Scorpius thinks he probably deserves it for asking a stupid question.</p><p class="zw-paragraph">
  <span class="EOP"> </span>
</p><p class="zw-paragraph">"Are you out here smoking a lot? Only, I've never seen anyone else out and about at night before."</p><p class="zw-paragraph">
  <span class="EOP"> </span>
</p><p class="zw-paragraph">"No," Albus says, voice still hard, maybe just a little softer than last time. "I'm a social smoker."</p><p class="zw-paragraph">
  <span class="EOP"> </span>
</p><p class="zw-paragraph">"Oh," Scorpius says, face creasing a little between his eyebrows. "Only, well... you're here by yourself."</p><p class="zw-paragraph">
  <span class="EOP"> </span>
</p><p class="zw-paragraph">"I'm not. You're here, aren't you?"</p><p class="zw-paragraph">
  <span class="EOP"> </span>
</p><p class="zw-paragraph">"I suppose I am," Scorpius muses. He can't think of anything else to say that Albus wouldn't roll his eyes at, so he sits silently on the edge of the fountain for a few minutes until his asthma attack finally subsides. Now that he can breathe again, he's able to fully appreciate just how tired he is. His watch says that it's 4:37am, so he has to be awake again in less than three hours to make it to classes tomorrow. Albus is still smoking the same cigarette as Scorpius stands up to go, his legs shaking a little. </p><p class="zw-paragraph">
  <span class="EOP"> </span>
</p><p class="zw-paragraph">"Well, I'm going back to bed now," he says, a little uncertain, not sure whether he should wait with Albus until he's finished. Albus's eyes trace down Scorpius's body.</p><p class="zw-paragraph">
  <span class="EOP"> </span>
</p><p class="zw-paragraph">"You sure you're not going to collapse on the way?"</p><p class="zw-paragraph">
  <span class="EOP"> </span>
</p><p class="zw-paragraph">"What?"</p><p class="zw-paragraph">
  <span class="EOP"> </span>
</p><p class="zw-paragraph">"You look a bit... wobbly," Albus says, and his eyes dart back to the pile of ash he's created on the flagstones.</p><p class="zw-paragraph">
  <span class="EOP"> </span>
</p><p class="zw-paragraph">"I think I'll be okay," Scorpius smiles. "I've managed it before."</p><p class="zw-paragraph">
  <span class="EOP"> </span>
</p><p>He looks back towards the fountain before he pulls the courtyard door closed behind him. Albus is looking down at his hands, watching intently as the last bit of his cigarette burns away. </p>
