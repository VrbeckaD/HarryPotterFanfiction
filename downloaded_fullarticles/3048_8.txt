          <div class="userstuff"><p>It's 1994 and Hedwig and Pigwidgeon are getting to know each other better, but things aren't going too well...</p><p>Pigwidgeon bounced and said, "I really like your owner, Harry The Boy Who Lived P-P-Potter."</p><p>Hedwig corrected him, "It's just Potter and his middle name isn't The Boy Who Lived." </p><p>Pigwidgeon replied, "Sorry, I get a bit hyper when I'm excited."</p><p>Hedwig smirked. "Really? I hadn't noticed."</p><p>Pigwidgeon not getting the sarcasm smiled. "I'm glad you don't mind me being hyper, Hed."</p><p>Hedwig sneered. "I do mind and it's Hedwig to you."</p><p>Pigwidgeon stopped bouncing and frowned. "Oh, do you not like me enough for me to use a nickname yet?"</p><p>Hedwig stated, "For once in your miserable little life you're correct. I do not like you one teeny tiny bit Pigwidgeon and I only allow close friends to call me by cute little nicknames."</p><p>Pigwidgeon muttered, "I guess that explains why Harry Potter calls you his snowy miracle then, because he's your close friend and I'm not."</p><p>Hedwig sheepishly responded, "Look, I'm sorry for getting snippy with you. It's just I find it hard to trust new people or in your case animals, especially after Scabbers turned out to be Peter Pettigrew."</p><p>Pigwidgeon started bouncing again and gasped. "Who who who's Peter Pettigrew?"</p><p>Hedwig asked, "You don't know?"</p><p>Pigwidgeon shook his head.</p><p>Hedwig told him, "He was Ron's old pet, everyone thought he was a regular rat but he was really a bad wizard who betrayed my owner's parents to You Know Who."</p><p>Pigwidgeon grinned. "Th-Th-Thank you for telling me, Hedwig."</p><p>Hedwig smiled. "You can call me Wig if you like."</p><p>Pigwidgeon inquired, "Does that mean you consider me a close friend now?"</p><p>Hedwig explained, "It will take time for me to trust you fully, but for now I consider you the closest friend I've ever had."</p><p>Pigwidgeon blushed and sighed. "Awww I'm touched, you're the closest friend I've ever had too."</p><p>Hedwig held his wing out towards him and asked, "Truce?"</p><p>Pigwidgeon shook the wing with his own and said, "Truce."</p></div>
