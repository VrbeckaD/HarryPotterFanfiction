          <div class="userstuff"><p>Our story begins in an empty Chamber of Secrets where Nagini, Lord Voldemort's pet snake and Salazar Slytherin, one of Hogwarts 4 founders are having a date. (The dialogue is all in parseltongue).</p><p>Salazar smiled. "I see you're enjoying the dormouse I captured and killed for you, Gini."</p><p>Nagini hissed. "You know it's my favourite type of rodent, my dear Sal."</p><p>Salazar replied, "That I do, that's why I searched everywhere for one."</p><p>Nagini beamed, "As thoughtful as always."</p><p>Salazar grinned. "To think that a basilisk used to live in this very chamber, I can almost smell her."</p><p>Nagini demanded to know, "How do you know it was a girl?"</p><p>Salazar smirked. "Jealous, are you? No need to be jealous, she's dead and you're not."</p><p>Nagini stated, "Very good point, but I wasn't jealous of a dead basilisk."</p><p>Salazar smiled. "Sure you weren't."</p></div>
