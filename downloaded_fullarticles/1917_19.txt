    <p>"What the hell do you want ?" A petite teenage boy asked harshly, the scowl growing on his beautiful face.</p><p>Tom shrugged his shoulders, trying his best not to let the smile that threatened his face reach it. He knew how much it pissed the petite man off when somebody didn't respond to him verbally, so that's what Tom did.</p><p>"Then leave," Harry—the so called teenage boy barked, catching the attention of workers and customers around them. Feeling eyes on him, Harry looked up and his own widened, causing him to blush and look away. Tom couldn't help but chuckle at his actions.</p><p>"Careful now, don't want to be reported for inappropriate behavior, do we?" Tom teased, causing Harry to look back at him and glare.</p><p>"Get the hell out of this shop, Riddle," he spoke Tom’s name like it was a disease. Tom was no fool to ignore the way it fluently rolled off his tongue, and his mate downstairs couldn't either. <em>Fuck, I shouldn't be turned on by this.</em></p><p>Tom looked down at his watch and cursed under his breath. It was time for him to go to work.</p><p><em>No more teasing</em>, he sighed.</p><p>"Get me a medium caramel frappe, please," Tom demanded, smiling sweetly at him. Those emerald eyes glared at him once more and Tom raised an eyebrow at him, daring him to say something smart. Harry was probably sick of the taller man’s attitude, but when he needed something, he needed it then.</p><p>"That'll be £2.85 sir," Harry informed him. Tom pulled out his wallet and took out his card, swiping it in the machine. After putting in his pin and signature he put it back inside of his wallet, placing the fabric back inside his pocket. When he looked back up at Harry, he had his drink ready. <em>Damn</em>.</p><p>Tom took it out of Harry’s hands and smiled deviously, resulting in those emerald eyes to narrow.</p><p>"Until next time, <em>Harry</em>," Tom told him, letting him know that he'll be back. Harry probably already knew that, though. The younger man was no fool to not notice that the constant reason Tom came to his shop was to tease him.</p><p>"Burn in hell," he responded, causing Tom to laugh. Tom saluted him goodbye, walking to the exit of the shop. He opened the door and walked outside, taking a sip of his drink.</p><p>Tom knew he shouldn't have found that funny, but he did.</p><p>It was funny to him the way the petite boy usually relaxed and smiling facial expression transitioned to a tense, scowling one because of <em>him</em>. His usual happy, chill mood dissipated into annoyed and irritation, because of <em>him</em>. Tom had that effect on the teenage boy, and he loved it.</p><p>Who knew this would happen ? Tom Marvolo Riddle, a twenty five-year-old businessman, taking interest in teasing a seventeen-year-old male barista with the mood swings of a pregnant woman.</p><p>And it all started with the glasses of his.</p>
