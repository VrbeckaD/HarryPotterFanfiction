    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p>Draco and Hermione stood in front of Headmaster McGonagall, their combined anger, frustration and humiliation dropping the temperature in the room by at least ten degrees. They’d both been on staff at Hogwarts for three years: Hermione as Muggle Studies Professor and Draco as Potions Master for first through third year students.</p>
<p>And in that time there had been not a single moment of peace.</p>
<p>“It isn’t often that I have to break up fights between professors,” McGonagall said, raising an eyebrow, amazed at how both of them looked exactly as they had first year, standing in front of her being scolded for sneaking out after dark. The same pouting frowns, same hunched shoulders of embarrassment. “Twelve year olds, yes,” she said, shuffling through a stack of parchment. “The occasional Quidditch brawl of course, but this is…well…” She finished with a sigh.</p>
<p>Hermione glanced in Draco’s direction, biting the inside of her cheek to keep from laughing at his “hundred galleon shirt” dripping with congealing gravy, his usually flawlessly styled hair stained and soaked with pumpkin juice. He caught her staring and snarled audibly, narrowing his eyes. She couldn’t help but notice a drop of the golden liquid glistening on one of his long lashes.</p>
<p>But anyone would notice that.</p>
<p>“Minerva…if I may,” he began, adopting his usual purring voice of persuasion. Hermione had watched him use it successfully on half drunk witches at the Leaky, not to mention a few “very mature” seventh year students who always found themselves staying after class with “questions about homework” that they just couldn’t bring themselves to ask about during class.</p>
<p>“You may not, Mr. Malfoy,” the headmistress cut him off with a single finger raised. She hadn’t been taken in by the Malfoy’s bullshit for fifty years…why start now?</p>
<p>Hermione snorted in laughter and Draco shot her a look of disdain as McGonagall went on and on with her standard speech about how they were supposed to be role models to a new generation of wizards. While she wandered off on a tangent about how the two of them were a perfect example of how the wizard world had unified after the war Draco watched the chocolate ice cream that was melting into Hermione’s hair drip down onto her shoulder, his eye drawn to the juice that soaked her shirt enough that he could see it clinging to her skin, the strap of her white bra clearly visible. Not that he cared. Not that he was looking at her breasts.</p>
<p>“I would like to think that two fully grown adult wizards could refrain from reducing themselves to a food fight in the middle of lunch!”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry,”</p>
<p>“Sorry,”</p>
<p>They both muttered, hanging their heads in shame, Hermione dragging the toe of her boot across the stone floor. It really had been ridiculous.</p>
<p>“Of course you are. You’re always sorry. Every time we meet like this. But I’ve had enough. I dare say the whole school has had enough. Although your battles are obviously entertaining to the younger students, it’s becoming something of a distraction to everyone else, wondering when another hex is going to fly by their face a they walk down the hall to lunch!” Hermione cringed remembering back to the beginning of the school year. A particularly feisty argument between the two of them had resulted in a misdirected Opugno and a first year being stabbed in the arm with a quill. “Whatever it is that is keeping the two of you from working together peacefully will be settled today. In The Reconciliation Chamber.”</p>
<p>Both of them snapped to attention jumping to speak at the same time.</p>
<p>“I hardly think –“</p>
<p>“It’s not necessary-“</p>
<p>“We can work this out-”</p>
<p>They both pleaded their cases frantically but it fell on deaf ears.</p>
<p>“Enough. You’re both expected at the chamber entrance by four p.m. And you will stay until you meet some sort of resolution. A PEACEFUL resolution.” With a flick of her wand, the door to the office opened signaling the end of the meeting.  “Perhaps you could clean yourself up before then.”</p>
<p>As soon as McGonagall left, Draco stormed for the door.</p>
<p>“Where are you going?” Hermione asked, a little too sharply. What did it matter?</p>
<p>Draco stalked back towards her, his eyes burning with humiliation and anger, getting close enough that she stumbled back against the wall.</p>
<p>“I’m going to steal something from the kitchen. I have a feeling we’re going to miss dinner.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>****</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco was at the chamber first, pacing in front of the door in his usual black pants and tight black sweater, the tips of his platinum hair still damp from a shower. Hermione wandered up moments later and leaned against the wall, doing her best to not watch him walk, the muscles of his shoulders moving under the cashmere, the way his fingers curled around his wand, clenching and releasing, something he did when he was tense. She only picked up on these habits because they’d worked together for so long.</p>
<p>They were details anyone would notice.</p>
<p>“For God’s sake, will you stand still for a minute?” she asked through gritted teeth.</p>
<p>He glanced over at her, his upper lip curled into the usual bitter sneer that he reserved especially for her; particularly when she tried to order him around. <em>Sit down. Be quiet. Stand still, don’t slurp, quit fidgeting,</em> like he was a five year old. And now, instead of stopping he paced faster, nearly stomping his feet, keeping his eyes locked on hers; her big brown eyes, fiery with energy, her hair freshly washed (with some…berry scented shampoo that he could smell from ten feet away) pulled back into a messy knot at the back of her head, thick curly tendrils of it brushing against her cheeks. Her stupid hair.</p>
<p>“Ah, professors! Glad you’re on time,” McGonagall called out, gliding up the last steps of the staircase, four Prefects with her, giggling behind their hands. “As you know, the rules of the Reconciliation Chamber are that your meeting must be verified by prefects NOT of your House. They will not be in the room with you, they cannot hear your discussion but they will be able to see you through the charmed mirror on the wall just there.” She pointed across the hallway to a fairly unobtrusive mirror about two feet square made of what looked like cloudy, mottled glass.</p>
<p>“But they’re children!” Draco spat, nearly causing one of the Hufflepuff prefects to pass out. He wasn’t known as the friendliest professor in school and thy were sure that this was somehow going to result in a detention. “This is ridiculous, Headmistress. I’m not going to…”</p>
<p>“When you act like children Mr. Malfoy, you are, unfortunately, subject to children’s rules. Oh, and one more thing…your wands,” McGonagall said, holding out her hand. “Please.”</p>
<p> </p>

</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Upon relinquishing their wands they entered the room, the door disappearing behind them, sealing them into the small chamber. They could not use magic, no hexes, no curses, no apparition. It was as if they were reduced to fighting like…muggles. The room itself was sparse; plain stone, windowless walls, a few lit candle sconces, a table and two chairs and a couch. Draco immediately flopped down on it, laying back with his feet on the armrest, hands clasped behind his head.</p>
<p>“This is fucking ridiculous, babysat by sixteen year olds,” he said. “Taking my wand. And for what? We used to have murderers running around the school who suffered less punishment. THIS IS BULLSHIT!”</p>
<p>“Draco! They’re right outside! Watch your language!”</p>
<p>“Are you deaf Granger? The old crone said they can’t hear us. FUCKING TWATS,” he yelled, to make his point. “SUCK MY DICK, MY PRECIOUS PREFECTS!”</p>
<p>“You’re disgusting,” Hermione said, but she turned away from him so he wouldn’t see her trying not to laugh.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <strong>4:30</strong>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“So you’re just going to lay there and sleep?” She asked, standing over him. “You have no desire to get out of here? To work through this? You want to spend the night with me in here?”</p>
<p>Draco’s eyes flew open, the corner of his mouth curling into a smile as he prepared a joke.</p>
<p>“Don’t,” she said. “You know what I mean, you pervert.”</p>
<p>His smile faded in a blink and he stood up.</p>
<p>“That,” he said, pointing one long finger at her. “That right there is what makes my blood boil.” He was standing far too close to her. Close enough that she could smell his soap, see the pulse pounding in his neck. “You don’t know the first thing about me but you assume I’m a pervert. You assume I’m a liar, a bigot, a…a…fucking scoundrel. Everything you think about me is the worst possible thing. It’s no different from how I treated you back then.”</p>
<p>“Oh please. It’s very different.”</p>
<p>“How? What’s different? Making assumptions? Not listening to the other side? Not bothering to find out the truth? How is it different? Tell me, Granger,” he said, leaning in so close that if there were a sudden earthquake, if the earth were to tip an inch on its axis, their lips would be touching. “Please, I’m begging you.”</p>
<p>He must have realized how…precarious their position was because he backed off almost immediately, his cheeks red, eyes darting towards the mirror on the wall. Her neck was feeling far too warm, her senses bombarded by the heat coming off his skin, his scent, his eyes flashing a dark, mesmerizing silver that she’d never been able to resist, even when they were kids. She turned to walk away and he grabbed her elbow.</p>
<p>“Don’t you dare walk away from me,” he said, still holding her arm, his eyes unable to move from the rosy pink of her lips, even if they were frowning. “You wanted to get this over with, let’s get it over with. Lay it all out on the table so I’m not wearing next Tuesday’s tea when you get a bug up your ass about my punctuality.”</p>
<p>“It’s not about punctuality!” She said, wrenching her arm free. “It’s about you saying we would get together to discuss the Muggle vs Wizard Medicine seminar and you never showed. I was standing around for half an hour while you flirted with Eleanor Braithewaite!”</p>
<p>“Flirting!? She’s my student! She had a question about homework!”</p>
<p>Hermione snorted and rolled her eyes. “It’s amazing she’s made it to sixth year with all the questions about homework she has. Isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“What does it matter to you?” He asked, laughing. “Besides, the seminar isn’t for six fucking months, Granger. Lighten up! We’re both smart enough to put something together that will impress the Ministry.”</p>
<p>“Well well well,” Hermione said, crossing her arms. “Malfoy finally admits I’m smart. Somebody conjure the confetti.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <strong>5:45</strong>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“All you do is pick. Pick pick pick. Everything I do you have some asinine commentary about,” he said, sitting at the table, tracing the wood grain with his fingertip. “Why must you walk so loudly, <em>Malfoy</em>. Why don’t you ever sit at the staff table, <em>Malfoy</em>. Why were you late for the points meeting, <em>Malfoy</em>. Why can’t you just throw yourself off the astronomy tower <em>Malfoy</em>.”</p>
<p>“Don’t say that,” she said quietly. “Don’t you ever say that. I would never say something that cruel. Not even then.”</p>
<p>They stared each other down for a moment and Draco finally nodded, his lips in a tight line.</p>
<p>“You’re right. Maybe that’s just my conscience.”</p>
<p>“Oh poor you. Poor Malfoy isn’t as popular as he once was. A childhood filled with regret. Well we all did things we didn’t want to do! We’re all fucked from the war. We all have things we can’t shake.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I know.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <strong>6:15</strong>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Maybe one day you could apologize. Or is that too much to ask? You could just say sorry for calling you a Mudblood. Sorry for implying you were dirty, a magic thief, worthy of extinction. Sorry for making you feel worthless, bringing you to tears every time we met, making your life at school miserable.”</p>
<p>He stood up from the table, his hands deep in his pockets. He’d always meant to apologize to her but it never felt right. The words didn’t seem like enough. He could do what his father always did to make amends: buy her an expensive gift, but he knew her well enough to know it wouldn’t work. <em>“Sorry I tried to extinguish your race…here’s a few daisies”</em> </p>
<p>“Do you think I don’t regret that?” He asked, standing in front of her, looking down at her tear filled eyes. There was a tone of desperation in his question that made her heart ache. He searched her face for the answer, shaking his head. “You think I don’t want to go back and change all that? The asinine things I said as a kid, the things I believed? You don’t think I still look at you that way do you? Hermione?”</p>
<p>She looked up at him and shook her head. “I know you don’t. Still, it’s nice to hear the words.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <strong>7:30</strong>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Look, the two of us are too volatile to ever…live peaceably. We both get under each other’s skin,” Hermione said, looking at her feet. “For some reason.” If she looked at his face when she made her suggestion the words would never come out. “We should just agree to do our jobs and stay out of each other’s way. I won’t talk to you…” she said, swallowing loudly. “…and you can ignore me.”</p>
<p>For a long time Draco didn’t answer and she felt her stomach roiling with acid, her throat tight with tears. This wasn’t the reconciliation she wanted. Not really.</p>
<p>“That’s what you want?” He asked quietly. “To pretend I’m not here?”</p>
<p>“It’s obvious that’s what you want. If you think that all I do is pick at you, nagging and complaining. You don’t like talking to me…”</p>
<p>“There you go again, assuming the worst, thinking I’m still the jerk I was ten years ago! I asked you if that’s what you want,” he said, walking closer to her. A few more steps and she’d be trapped. Her heart was pounding in her chest. “Do you really want me to pretend you’re not here?”</p>
<p>“Why not?” She said, finally looking up at him. “It would give you more time to chase underage witches.”</p>
<p>“Why does that bother you so much?” He said throwing his hands in the air. “And there you go again assuming I’m some sort of letch. I’m not <em>chasing</em> underage witches. I’m not chasing anybody. I can’t help it if they have a crush on me, but I’m not interested in them!”</p>
<p>“Oh right! A flock of girls falling all over themselves to lean over your desk,” she said, mimicking the act, bending forward and squeezing her breasts together with her arms. He had to look away.</p>
<p>“Hermione I don’t…”</p>
<p>“Not to mention Professor Oatstraw who always seems to need a private meeting with you…”</p>
<p>“I don’t give a shit about what Oatstraw wants! I’m not interested in her!” He took another step closer and she was backed up to the wall, her fingers digging into the rough edges of the stone.</p>
<p>“I’m not interested! I’m not interested!” She said in a sing songy voice. “A young single wizard and he’s not interested in all this female attention. Please! So who is it then? There has to be someone. Tell me Malfoy, who are you interest-“</p>
<p>Before she could get the word out he grabbed her shoulders and kissed her, hard. Harder than he’d intended for their first kiss, but she’d made him so crazy, mocking him, poking, poking, poking at him. Was she really that dense?</p>
<p>Hermione melted against the wall, her lips opening under his, their tongues slipping together as she wrapped her arms around his neck. He pulled away, his forehead pressed against hers, doing his best to catch his breath, his hands running up and down her sides.</p>
<p>“You, you dumb witch. I’m interested in you!”</p>
<p>She smiled and he leaned in to kiss her again, covering her face and throat with nibbling pecks, pulling her earlobe between his teeth while his hips, his chest, his everything was pressing the breath from her lungs. He pulled away, running his fingers through her thick, still damp hair, tucking it behind her ear.</p>
<p>“Oh,” she said, speechless for the first time in her life, giving him that lopsided smile that he’d loved ever since fourth year. “I’m…Well, I’m interested in you, too.”</p>
<p>But before he could kiss her again he heard another voice, a voice from outside the room, a tight, throat-clearing sort of sound to get their attention.</p>
<p>“Ah…Mr. Malfoy, Ms. Granger. I might…remind you that your…your…progress…is being monitored by the Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw prefects,” McGonagall said.</p>
<p>Both Hermione and Draco smiled as they heard muffled giggles coming through the heavy wooden door. The door that would only appear when a reconciliation was achieved.</p>
