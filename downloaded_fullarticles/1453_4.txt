  <b>Update!! </b>
</p><p>Just to get it out of the way I'm going to tell you who the professors are. I've done as much research as possible and looked at anything I could find, I will explain why each professor has this position on each one as well.</p><p>Head of Hufflepuff- Neville Longbottom</p><p>Head of Ravenclaw- Filius Flitwick</p><p>Head of Gryffindor- Rowan Khanna</p><p>Head of Slytherin- Unnamed Potions Master</p><p> </p><p>Classes:</p><p>Care of Magical Creatures- Rubeus Hagrid (giants have longer lifespans and being he is half-giant, I want to believe he is still alive and teaching at Hogwarts)</p><p>Herbology- Neville Longbottom (J.K Rowling stated he became the Herbology professor after Madam Sprout)</p><p>Potions- Older lady described the have smoky eyes. (was mentioned in the cursed child and I wager she's still the professor)</p><p>Transfiguration- Rowan Khanna (Yes, from Hogwarts Mystery. His dream was to be a professor and since the transfiguration professor after McGonagall was unknown, I decided to place him here as he would only be 57 and it would be highly likely.)</p><p>Charms- Filius Flitwick (goblins have a longer life span and Flitwick is half goblin, once again I hope that he is going strong and still teaching at Hogwarts)</p><p>Divination- Sybill Trelawny (she was relatively young and I'm pretty sure she must still be alive. Anyways, I can't leave her out, I loved her character)</p><p>Astronomy- Aurora Sinistra (She was young in the series and could very well still be alive)</p><p>Defense Against the Dark Arts- Tulip Karasu (yes, from Hogwarts Mystery. I can't help it. The D.A.D.A teachers have all had a habit of disregarding the rules and Tulip does nothing but that plus she's very talented and I believe she would have made a fantastic professor. Just let me dream. She would also only be about 57 now)</p><p>Flying- Andre Egwu (yes, once more from Hogwarts Mystery. It was known he was a gifted flyer and I believe that after Madam Hooch he would have made a great flying instructor. Just let me dream)</p><p> </p><p>Other Positions:</p><p>Headmistress- Penny Haywood (I promise, this is the last one from Hogwarts Mystery. The Headmaster after McGonagall was unknown and after looking into Penny's backstory and personality, I think she would be great in this position. Once more, just let me dream. She would also be about 57)</p><p>Caretaker- Argus Filch (he could very well be in about his 80s by now but I'm sure he would still be caretaker... right?)</p><p>Matron- Madam Pomfrey and Hannah Abott (Madam Pomfrey, I believe, would never leave this post and it's know that Hannah applied for the job so! Why not two matrons?)</p>
