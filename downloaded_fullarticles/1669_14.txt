  <strong>The Weasleys never intended to spend the Christmas holidays at 12 Grimmauld Place and here’s why…</strong>
</p>
<p align="center"><br/>Stolen cauldrons, doxies in the curtains, a screaming portrait and a muttering house elf were just the tip of the iceberg</p>
<p align="center"><br/>Every time the tone during the meetings grew harsher, Molly begged that the door was still imperturbed</p>
<p align="center"><br/>Every morning when Molly comes down the stairs to make breakfast, she finds Sirius fast asleep next to the remains of his last supper still in his day clothes </p>
<p align="center"><br/>Every time she gets bitten by a jinxed artifact during cleaning</p>
<p align="center"><br/>Shortly before every full moon when Lupin curls up in his room, Molly prays that the Wolfbane potion is working</p>
<p align="center"><br/>Some nights when Sirius screams in his sleep and she climbs up the stairs in her nightgown to put a silencing charm on his door, hoping he doesn’t wake up the children</p>
<p align="center"><br/>Every time she finds a huge, black dog lying on the cold kitchen floor and she covers him with a blanket</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p align="center">Every time Sirius gets mad at her for caring for Harry because he’s his godfather and how dare she and then she hears Sirius call Harry James.</p>
<p align="center"><br/>Every time Molly and Sirius have an argument in the kitchen and Arthur smiles at the children while turning up the radio to drown out the sound</p>
<p align="center"><br/>Listening to each Order meeting, but still fearing for her family’s safety</p>
<p align="center"><br/>Accidentally leaving a bunch bed sheets on the floor in the hallway and sending Sirius into a flashback. Then feeling instant regret and at the same time hoping no one saw it.</p>
<p align="center"> <br/>Every time she returns to 12 Grimmauld Place and the house just gets dirtier. Because how hard can it be to do the dishes (it’s just a wand wave, right)?</p>
<p align="center"><br/>Every time Molly goes to check on Remus and Sirius and she finds them sitting in the kitchen smoking and drinking</p>
<p align="center"><br/>Every time she smiles through gritted teeth</p>
