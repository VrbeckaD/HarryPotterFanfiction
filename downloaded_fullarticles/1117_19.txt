    <p>
  <span>"My, my. So this is the demon the King is causing such a fuss about."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Glowing green eyes turned to stare into swirling crimson red. A chin was tilted in curiosity.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Fuss? I had no idea I had caused such a stir in Hell," the other stated simply, his gloved fingers tapping softly against the stone well he was sitting upon.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A smirk formed, slitted eyes crinkling as his sharp fang poked out.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Oh yes. Quite the stir down there. Anyone that brings you to the King will be rewarded handsomely you know."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Emerald eyes narrowed in absolute loathing for a moment before his expression settled into grimace. Brushing a black lock from his forehead, he exposed a queer lightning shaped scar.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I see. So that's why I've been hunted." A gleam entered the smaller male's eyes. "But you… Why are you not attacking me then, hm?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Should I be?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A chuckle erupted from his petal pink lips. "Well, you are different, aren't you? Haha! May we meet again!"</span>
</p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Fancy meeting you here! You must be happy to have received a ticket out of Hell so quickly after last time. I'd almost think you delight in being exorcised with how often it occurs."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wine colored eyes blinked in surprise and the taller male turned his head to regard the smaller form next to him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Oh? How interesting. This is the first time you've approached me. What are you doing in the coliseum?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Why, watching a death match of course. I was bored. What else would I be doing?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Creating a contract."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A thin eyebrow rose on the smaller man's pale face. Then he snorted derisively. "True. But contracts are annoying then I get bored. Again. Now where is the fun in that? But I guess men on death row would make for a lovely meal," the younger grumbled to himself.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Hmmm. Oh look the tiger has won."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Emerald eyes practically shone in delight.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Lovely," he exclaimed.</span>
</p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>"How are you lacking this knowledge?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Don't patronize me," he glared, eyes flaring an acidic green in irritation.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"It is genuine curiosity."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I might believe you if I didn't know you. Now drop the innocent act. Tell me about hellspawn."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wine colored eyes closed in resignation as the interrogation continued.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Hm. It's you again. What name are you going by this time, then?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Michaelis. One of the better I have worn."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The small male blinked lazily at the other from his spot on the soft grassy hill. The sun was at just the perfect spot that warmth and light fell over the two of them without being blinding or overly disgusting. His pink lips quirked up just slightly and he closed his eyes to bask more.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Not going to ask for my Name?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Eh. I'll figure it out one day. Besides there are only so many presidents around." The taller ravenette bared his teeth in malicious amusement. "Stop that. I can feel the shift in your energy. I'm not giving up, just going about it a different way."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His eyes rolled in their sockets at the mulishness and sloth of the younger shining through once again.</span>
</p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Seriously do you have a tracker on me or something?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The ravenette raised an amused perfectly shaped brow. "Of course not."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Sure," he scoffed running a hand through his messy locks. His claws came down to itch at the irritation along his cheek. He ran a black nail along it, collecting a few droplets of blood to lick away while his companion surveyed the damage.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Quite the chaos you've created."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"They pissed me off. It's really getting annoying having to deal with 'em."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Crimson eyes turned to observe the younger as he addressed his looks and attended his wounds. After a few moments, finding everything satisfactory, the small demon turned on his heel and started walking away.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Curious, Michaelis asked, "Where are you off to?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Green eyes locked with muddled red and it felt as the smaller male was searching for something in his black non existent soul. Finally the younger demon turned to fully face him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Not as if you won't magically find me later anyway." There was amusement mixed with irritation in his tone. "But you haven't even tried to capture me and I enjoy your presence sometimes so I guess I can tell you. I plan on going to India for a couple hundred years. Maybe I'll travel to England after that. I might see you around sometime, ne?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wine eyes twinkled in mirth.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Been to Japan lately, have you? I do believe you will be seeing me again soon."</span>
</p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah, I've found you."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The fringe of black hair shadowed the man's emerald eyes as he slowly looked up from his meal. The smaller demon adjusted the dead body in his arms when he saw who was standing in front of him. The ravenette watched as the afterglow of a truly delicious meal faded from his younger acquaintance's eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Michaelis? What are you doing here? I thought you'd been exorcised a few centuries ago."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The demon smiled his eyes crinkling closed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"It is Sebastian now."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I see. So you've formed another contract then," he stated.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Yes. I would like your… assistance if you would be willing to give it, Hadrian."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The demon hissed at the sound of his name.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"How many times have I told you to call me Harry? I swear you do that just to piss me off," Harry snapped. Then he blinked in surprise when the gravity of what Sebastian had asked finally hit him. Harry couldn't help it. He laughed. Hard.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"The great and mighty demon President asking for help! I do believe I've been a horrible influence on you," he crowed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sebastian's smile was becoming faker by the second and a twitch was building in his temple. "I will concede your point. So will you... assist or not?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry laughed even harder at his associate's darkening mood but he responded quickly because he didn't exactly enjoy being chased around by an unhappy murder of demonic crows.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"It depends on the aid you require. You know I hate long term contracts."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sebastian sighed. Yes, he did know. Actually the emerald eyed demon hated to commit to anything really which could be rather annoying. Contracts were the only things he actually put effort into and even then he kept them as short as possible. He was never able to pry why out of him though.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Still it would be much easier if he wasn't the only servant at Phantomhive manor. And his young master was craving for company at the manor even though he wouldn't admit it. There was also the small problem of Sebastian cooking. He wasn't used to human food or cooking in general and so kept messing up the dishes for Ciel, and the little brat threw a tantrum about it every time. Sebastian had never figured out where Harry had learned to cook but the younger demon did know and he needed that knowledge at this moment. He looked back up at Harry who had just disposed of his latest meal in a cloud of green vapor and was staring at him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"This contract will last maybe a year. I wanted to try a different way of getting souls as you know and I came to find that the longer the contract the tastier the soul. I strive to find longer contracts now."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry made a face leaning his elbows on his knees. Sebastian tsked. He hated bribing but the situation called for it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I will give you anything you ask for for the duration of the contract."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry looked terribly surprised. His eyes opened wide and his lips parted slightly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Anything? That's an awful large obligation Sebastian," Harry paused and cocked his head as he fluidly pulled himself from the partially cobbled ground. "Once we make this deal there is no going back. You know that right?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was a very long pause as Sebastian thought of the repercussions this deal could have. Perhaps he had been a bit too hasty with his wording. How unlike him. He was getting a bit desperate, though. Ciel was… annoying. "Anything within reason. Nothing that will kill me or impede my current contract in any way."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Ha! That's more like it. Because we're such old </span>
  <em>
    <span>friends </span>
  </em>
  <span>I'll let you think a bit more. Any other stipulations?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sebastian scrutinized the unassuming demon grinning at him. He had already carefully weighed his options beforehand. He was not the type of demon to request assistance. Ever. This latest contract was proving challenging against his skillset and while he could learn his patience and stretched so far especially considering he was dealing with a child. He'd not exactly expected it and the little thing had turned out to be a mite more clever than he'd assumed, stretching for time in a way most adults couldn't achieve. It was amusing something he'd never seen so he went along with it and was now stuck.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>So to mitigate any damages he might possibly cause in the future -on accident of course- he needed to collaborate. If there was ever a being he would trust with this job it would be Hadrian. He was the only demon that wouldn't actively go out of his way to backstab him. He was a very straightforward in his cruelty and enjoyment more often than not.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But wasn't that why Sebastian continued to visit him even though he had no obligation too? Hadrian was like a breath of fresh air in the cloying scents of Hell. Some would think him easily exploitable but that was definitely not so. He had witnessed quite the tragic bloodbath the last time a hellspawn tried it. Sebastian was certain he wouldn't regret this.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He nodded in acceptance.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Very well. In rebuttal I have my own conditions before I will help you with this contract. Be warned. I am doing this for you and not your contractee. I will not tolerate them ordering me around. If your master gets on my nerves I will rectify the situation. I am not a collared demon Sebastian. Also 'help' is quite vague. I will do no more than an actual servant of a noble manor is obligated to do. Do you understand?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Deal."</span>
