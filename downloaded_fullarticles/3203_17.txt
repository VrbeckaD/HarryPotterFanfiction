          <div class="userstuff"><p>Have you spent a day alone with a bully?<br/>When there's no one to see,<br/>Something lifts from his shoulders<br/>It is wondrous to behold,<br/>Like an eyelid fluttering open and like lighting flashing<br/>Across darkness, and be warned<br/>It is often as temporary.</p>
<p>Permanence is overrated anyway.<br/>I have never slept very well;<br/>They always came for me in the night.<br/>In the night, I remember<br/>Long after they snored<br/>I laid awake, terrified of closing my eyes<br/>Lest the monster break through.</p>
<p>There was always this tussle<br/>Between will and fatigue, sharpened by my fear<br/>The stakes stacked against me, my body always won and<br/>When my mind rested its vigil<br/>He came. him and his, and me and mine<br/>Everyone haunted me in my terrors<br/>They killed and died and blamed me<br/>I was strangled and tied and made to suffer<br/>Incessantly I thrashed and mewled<br/>And occasionally, someone would wake me<br/>And lay back in their bed, unknowing<br/>Of the blessing that is sound sleep.</p>
<p>I didn't fix you; there was nothing broken inside<br/>That I could reset and make you alright<br/>When you chose to lift me from my woe<br/>I had no say in where you were carrying us<br/>It was all you. When you woke me from my hell<br/>And didn't lay back on your bed<br/>I spent the night alone with a bully<br/>When we walked the quiet castle together,<br/>When your sleep-heavy steps rid you of your barriers<br/>They freed me from my filial fate, too.</p>
<p>If I swim the skies and fish for you<br/>The dragon of the constellation<br/>I still wouldn't thank you enough;<br/>For the dream in which I exist<br/>Is your charity.</p></div>
