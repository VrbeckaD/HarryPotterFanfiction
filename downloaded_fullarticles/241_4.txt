    <p>A cool ocean’s breeze washed over the deck of the Aircraft Carrier. A lone man stood at one end of the flight deck, hands clasped behind his back, tired blue eyes watching the ocean’s waves. Around him, planes stood ready to launch, his gut telling him that they would be needed before the sunset over the horizon. Suddenly, a voice came from behind him, “Commander, is everything alright?”</p>
<p>Turning around to face the voice, the Commander was face-to-face with a woman with long silver hair and striking blue eyes, this was Enterprise, the best warrior of the Eagle Union, “I’m quite alright Enterprise, just… reflecting.”</p>
<p>Enterprise frowned and let her displeasure be known, “I know you still blame yourself for the breaking of the Azur Lane and the frosty relations with the Ironblood and Sakura Empire, but while you were a Commander and had operational control, it was down to the diplomats and politicians to keep it together. They failed.”</p>
<p>The Commander smirked, “When did I become so readable?” he asked.</p>
<p>Enterprise joined him at the edge of the flight deck, “You didn’t,” she stated, “I became aware of your mannerisms not long before you informed me that you were getting a second secretary assigned to you,” she remarked before looking at him, “Have you found out who she is?”</p>
<p>The Commander sighed, “No, Command has been very tight-lipped on the matter. All I know is that she’s from the Royal Navy,” he replied before looking at her carefully, “I trust there will be no issues?”</p>
<p>Enterprise shook her head, “Of course not,” she stated before grimacing, “As long as it isn’t Ark Royal, she’s a bit… er…”</p>
<p>The Commander gave a smile to her, “Destroyer obsessed?” he filled in before growing serious, “Agreed, hopefully, they’ve reined her in a bit.”</p>
<p>Enterprise gave a slight nod before shutting her eyes. He suspected that she was thinking about her sister Yorktown but before he could say anything, the repair ship Vestal approached them, “Commander, Enterprise, there are reports coming from the new HeadQuarters saying that they have contacts on long-range radar, and it’s not us.”</p>
<p>Enterprise’s head snapped up and the Commander’s brow furrowed, “Sakura!” he muttered before turning to Enterprise, “I’m transferring to Vestal, I need you to make best possible speed to the base.”</p>
<p>Enterprise nodded and soon the transfer was complete. Vestal and the Commander watched as Enterprise picked up speed and rushed off to the base. A soft sigh came from Vestal, “Do you think she’ll be alright until we get there?” she asked.</p>
<p>The Commander looked down slightly, “I don’t know.”</p><hr/>
<p>
  <em>A Few Hours Earlier</em>
</p><hr/>
<p>Prince of Wales took in the sight of the new base of the remade Azur Lane. It’s white architecture typical of the Azur Lane, as was it’s been built around the natural beauty of the island, she knew some of the brass was very eco-centric and they made that very apparent in their buildings, including one officer she had observed from afar. Before she could reminisce any further, her guide spoke up, “Is everything alright Prince?”</p>
<p>Prince of Wales smiled at the girl, “Yes Cleveland, just reminiscing on the old days.”</p>
<p>Thankfully for her, Cleveland didn’t push for answers as she was embarrassed to admit that she was drawn to that Commander, the same one that was coming to take over this base. But she knew that nothing would come of it as he, like all men, would soon be distracted by his new secretary’s <em>assets</em>.</p>
<p>Soon Cleveland spoke up, “Come on, Illustrious is just coming in to dock! Let’s go greet her!”</p>
<p>Prince grew a small smile, “Don’t rush me, I’m coming.”</p>
<p>Soon they reached the dock and greeted both Illustrious and Unicorn, while Cleveland went off to do her own thing, “<em>Probably to find out how Helena’s group is doing</em>” Prince thought, and Unicorn went off to explore the base, she took Illustrious to the Royal Navy’s common area, “I wasn’t lying on the dock, it is good to see you old friend,” Illustrious said.</p>
<p>It took Prince a moment to realise that Illustrious had spoken, “Pardon? I didn’t hear what you said.”</p>
<p>Illustrious pursed her lips, “You’re still thinking about him, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>Prince let some of her frustration show, “Of course I am!” she retorted, “That one act of kindness has affected me far more than that one day!”</p>
<p>Illustrious just smiled as Prince realised what she had just done, “I’m sorry Illustrious, I didn’t mean to snap at you.”</p>
<p>Illustrious nodded, “It’s quite alright my friend, I understand,” she remarked before standing before the window.</p>
<p>Prince blinked, surprised at Illustrious’ words, “What do you mean Illustrious?”</p>
<p>Illustrious giggled, “Did you honestly think that you were the first shipgirl to develop such feelings? Or that you were the first in the Royal Navy to do so?” she asked. When Prince nodded, she sighed, “Dear, many of us have developed such feelings, sometimes it’s between us and our commanders, sometimes it’s for complete outsiders, sometimes it’s between ourselves, you’ve seen how close Cleveland and Helena are?” she asked and again, Prince nodded, “That’s not that uncommon, from what I hear, Akagi and Kaga of the Sakura Empire are the same way and there are others who fall into that category.”</p>
<p>Prince joined her at the window, “But what about you Illustrious? You said that you understood what I felt, how?”</p>
<p>Illustrious gave a small smile, “It would never work out, not least of which because she doesn’t want for relationships, it’s just who she is. I’ve accepted that, but she’ll always hold my heart.”</p>
<p>Prince was just about to ask who this person was when Javelin ran in, “Prince of Wales! Illustrious! There are contacts on long-range radar, and the Commander’s flotilla has confirmed it’s not them.”</p>
<p>Turning back to the window, Prince’s lips curled, anger clear on her face, “Sound the General Alarm, get as many people in the water as possible!” she ordered before turning to Illustrious, “Coming?”</p>
<p>Illustrious nodded, “I’ll be a few minutes, but I’ll be there,” she replied.</p>
<p>Not questioning it, Prince of Wales rushed out of the room with Javelin hot on her heels. Illustrious waited a moment before picking up the phone in the room, “Hello, Your Majesty? Yes, this is Illustrious, Unicorn and I have arrived but a hostile force is coming to us, the Commander’s flotilla is nearer, but if you could hurry, please. Yes actually, there was one more thing, is it still possible to switch the Commander’s new secretary? Perfect, here’s my plan…”</p><hr/>
<p>Soon, most of the base was in defensive mode, shipgirls were in defensive positions, manjuus were reporting to damage control and rescue positions, and both Illustrious and Unicorn had planes in the air. It didn’t take long before the enemy made their presence known, several air attacks came in quick succession, Cleveland and Javelin were doing their best but they knew that unless something changed soon, one would get past and strike Unicorn as they were focusing on her. The other destroyers were trying their best, but their armament was too small to be successful against the cruisers and Prince of Wales had her hands full trying to deter other, larger ships from coming too close.</p>
<p>Finally, it happened, a swarm of red planes came at Unicorn and try as they might, several got past Cleveland and Javelin and battered Unicorn, causing her to fall over. It was then that a giant wolf-like creature came over her and looked to be about to give the killing blow when suddenly, a plane braved the hail of gunfire and struck the wolf, causing it to fade away in a blue flame.</p>
<p>This caused a lull in the battle as everyone looked to see who had saved Unicorn. Their first indication was when the woman in a blue dress cried out, “No! Not her!”</p>
<p>Less than two kilometres from the base, a solitary carrier approached the enemy fleet, the woman on board curled her lips, “This ends now!” she states.</p>
<p>Allowing her ship to merge with her, the Azur Lane Fleet recognised her at once, “It’s Enterprise!” was the cry that went up and everyone doubled their efforts to give Enterprise enough time to drive off the hostile forces.</p>
<p>The battle that ensued was short but fierce. By using her own planes to get her closer, Enterprise threw everything she could at the woman in the blue dress while keeping the one in a red dress occupied. Finally, she landed a hit unto the blue dress, causing her to scream in pain. When Enterprise landed on the water, she looked ready to continue the fight herself. But the one in the red dress floated down to the other one and picked her up, “It is time to leave,” she whispered to the woman that she now carried in her arms before turning to the Azur Lane Fleet, “Know this Azur Lane, we, the Sakura Empire, have thrown our lot in with the Ironblood in a Crimson Axis, and I, Akagi and my sister Kaga will repay you for this injury you have inflicted upon her.”</p>
<p>With that, she turned and left; Enterprise made to pursue, but Illustrious calling out to her stopped her, “Enterprise! We cannot give chase, no matter how much we wish to!”</p>
<p>Enterprise spun around, “But we must!” she retorted.</p>
<p>Prince of Wales came up beside them, “I want to chase after them too, but we can’t, with the majority of the fleet heavily damaged, you are our only combat-capable ship and even you could use a few days in drydock. Even if you didn’t, if you gave chase, we would be defenceless for a few days!” she implored before grabbing Enterprise’s shoulder, “Please, stay back, if only to make sure that they won’t try a follow-up attack.”</p>
<p>Enterprise didn’t say a word as she went to help the manjuus rescue badly hurt people. Fires were blazing all over the warehouses and a few of the civilians were trying to help, but Sakura had even targeted them and many laid dead or badly injured. Prince looked over the base, grime and blood from a small cut on her forehead covered her, “I guess the old saying is still true,” she muttered.</p>
<p>“War never changes.”</p>
