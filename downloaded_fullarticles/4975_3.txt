They were objects to each other; a way to release some steam between trials and funerals, a person to share the silence with, a warm body in a cold bed.  It was a comfort for Harry, to have someone who didn’t push him, someone who didn’t tread carefully around him.

He’d tried, but he hadn’t been able to stop thinking of the memory; of the warm gut feeling it’d prompted, of the burning sensation he’d felt long after Charlie’s hand had returned to his lap, of the desire, the surprised realisation that <em>maybe</em> he did want more than no strings attached.</p><p>Luckily for him, Charlie had felt the same way.</p></div>
