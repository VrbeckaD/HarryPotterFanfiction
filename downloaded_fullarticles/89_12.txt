    <p>You Are My Salvation</p><p>Summary: Percy decides he needs a change when he broke up with Annabeth, Poseidon says London would be a good place to go, there Percy meets a blonde young adult and there his life changes as the Light is fading away…</p><p>Quote: “We are shining like a billion stars”</p><p>Chapter 1</p><p>“I’m breaking up with you Annabeth,” Percy spoke, he stretched his legs out and sighed, the chair tipped back and stayed on two legs.<br/>“But why?” Annabeth had cried, her grey eyes wide and tears were falling, she was a big mess, her little amount of makeup was running down her face and Percy felt his emotions crack a tiny bit.</p><p>“My feelings have changed Annabeth; I know we have been through so much together… but I no longer love you like I used too.” Percy said and kissed the daughter of Athena on her forehead and vapor travelled to his father’s palace.</p><p>“You did what was right, son,” Poseidon said and held his son as he broke down.  </p><p>Its true, what they say that when you are looking for a lover, he/she should be the same as themselves, or like their parents. Annabeth would always have a special place in his heart, and later he hoped they could be friends again, but he wasn’t sure. <br/>He had also started a small battle with Athena and Poseidon, the goddess was upset that Percy had broken Annabeth’s heart, but the god had pointed out points that couldn’t be denied. Annabeth and he argued a lot, they no longer had sex, and they hardly had time for each other. Percy was a Praetor in Rome alongside Reyna and Frank, so he spent a lot of time in San Fran, while Annabeth had her job as an Architect and her job at camp. Plus, she was in school/ Uni, she had gathered a lot of attention in the Mortal world and was thriving. Sure, she had lots of nightmares, but Morpheus had blessed her with nightmare free dreams, every demigods dream, but a blessing for Percy and Annabeth. Tartarus was hell and she had survived, they both had. They would always have memories, but Percy was ready to move on. Forget most of his past and build his future. That had also been one of the reasons why he had accepted Reyna’s offer to stay in Rome.<br/>He was also on a mission for the gods, some evil was happening in London and he needed to keep it secret. Aphrodite had smirked and said he would have an enjoyable time where he was going to be staying.</p><p>That was for sure, yup, you heard it: 19-year-old Percy Jackson it was true as Hades was the god of the Underworld, Percy was in London. Zeus had even let him fly in an airplane, “though that was going to be the only damned plane Jackson was allowed on” Zeus had snarled and left.</p><p>Hermes had come up with the rest of his “Travelling” bags, the gods had already had a house set up for him, a car, glasses, school, and a bunch of reading books, great.<br/>So, the briefing had been short, Zeus had intel that there was dangerous Monster activity, and Civil War, it was going to bring Chaos and War. Something that Great Britain didn’t need, hence why they were going to send him. Didn’t they know he somehow always ends up blowing up the school at the end of each year?<br/>Anyways back on track, they were killing and leaving a weird Snake/Skull like symbols in the sky. He needed to kill the person in charge of that cult. <br/> So, after he got off the plane and through all the unnecessary security, a man named Carl stood with his name on it, the man was polite and had said: “Milord Jupiter told me to take you to the door to the city you need to go to.” </p><p>Percy now stood staring at the building of bricks, a man named Tom had told him that he was expected and honoured that Harry could see him, what with him being an Auror and all, Frowning Percy allowed the name slip and walked forwards after telling Tom he had to leave his wand at home. The man muttered something about stupid laws and allowed him through. Percy did his best to stifle his awe at the crowded little street. He had seen some weird things throughout his demigod life, and this was close to the top 10 now. </p><p>Percy was in a daze walking around, ignoring as everyone whispered, talking about Harry Potter and how that he was their savoir. He was so busy he failed to notice the blonde running to him, he was looking at his wrist and scowling.<br/>They collided and Percy froze, those cold grey eyed had him captive, they were so beautiful. A chuckle soft as a melody was heard, looking around Percy was scared as time slowed down, and a goddess stood with a blinding light, it faded and Percy saw who stood their: She had a light blue flowy dress; she had a stick in her hand and her smile was breath taking. Her breasts were half showing, but her brown hair was what caught his attention, it was flowing everywhere, and her voice was soft and musical. <br/>“Perseus Jackson, son of Neptune, enter the Domain of Magic and let’s see what the Fates have planned for you.” She proclaimed, clapped her hands and a red blast hit him in the chest, time resumed, and the tall blondie rushed to his side and helped him up. <br/>“I’m sor- wait?” the teen looked angrily. “Potter?!” he sneered, raising, his wand? <br/>How did he know what that was called?<br/>“No, I’m Perseus Jackson,” Percy said to the blonde wizard.<br/>Somehow Hecate had planted memories of this world that he didn’t know about and he was now knowledgeable about what had transpired here. The battles, the wizards, the ministry, everything. <br/>“Well, my name is Draconis Lucius Malfoy, Lord of the Noble and Ancient house of Malfoy, Potions Master, and it’s a pleasure to meet you,” the blonde stood up taller, his face was emotionless, and Percy frowned.<br/>The teen looked thin and unhealthy, but he was strong he had lost something majorly and Percy wanted to know if he could help. <br/>His flaw: Loyalty, and always to help others in need.</p><p>ΩΩΩ /*/*/*</p><p>Draco Malfoy had been on his way to the Healer’s Hospital when the Boy-Who-Lived had bumped into him, at first he had been angry and was ready to draw his wand, but had froze when he saw that the one who looked like Harry wasn’t him at all. <br/>This teen was close alike, but he had different stance to himself: he stood with his legs apart, arms crossed, his black hair was even messier then Harry’s, he also had curls, , his eyes were also a different green, more sea like and that was what had him captive. They were like the ocean; his eyes were battle hardened. Haunted.<br/>“Perseus” had been his undoing, a few days ago Luna Lovegood had told him that a man named Perseus would come into his life and would make it better. Would help him.   <br/>Save him. Draco hadn’t believed, but here was his proof. <br/> </p>
