  <i>“Hogwarts, Hogwarts,<br/>
Hoggy warty Hogwarts,<br/>
Teach us something please!”</i>
</p><p>Rey gazed out at the hundreds of caroling students before her and felt a swelling pride in her chest. It felt like only yesterday that she was in that crowd, pointed hat, wide smile, striped tie. The view from the faculty table was strange and foreign to her. From here, the Great Hall appeared rather smaller than it had when she was a student.</p><p>Nevertheless she found herself grinning just as wide as she used to and singing along loudly. Next to her, Poe Dameron, the Quidditch coach, was standing up and wildly conducting the students, bright orange robes billowing around him.  Poe pointed to his right at the caretaker, a man the students lovingly referred to as Mr. Finn, and the students whooped and cheered as he executed a complicated yet silly dance, which Rey could tell he was making up on the spot.</p><p>Finn was the main reason Rey had taken the job here. Sure, she’d had fun at Hogwarts as a student, but who actually wants to go back to their school once they’ve graduated? She had voiced this sentiment to Finn over the summer when he had urged her to apply for the open Transfiguration position, but, as with most arguments she’d had with Finn, it had stretched on and on until she was simply tired of disagreeing, and she gave in with a sigh. After that, he wouldn’t leave her flat until she sent her CV by owl to Headmaster McGonagall. Finally, when he was convinced that she would try her hardest to get the job, they went back to their usual activity of white wine and Muggle soap operas.</p><p>Rey looked at the timid Gryffindor first years and remembered her terrifying first meal in this castle, when she still wasn’t convinced it was real and half-expected her foster father to come bursting through the Entrance Hall. She remembered watching Poe that night so long ago, a fourth year then and the same gregarious individual he was now, and wondering how anyone could be so confident… and, sitting down next to him, tall and lanky, black hair shielding his eyes, was…<br/>
She searched down the faculty table and spotted him. Unlike everyone else in the Great Hall, he wasn’t singing or laughing. In fact, he looked rather bored. Like Poe, not much had changed since school. Rey wondered if she herself had changed in the eight years since she graduated—she certainly hoped she had.</p><p>As the laughing and singing died down, the gleaming dishes were magically filled with food, prompting Poe and Finn to plop down and dig in. Rey hadn’t had food as good as Hogwarts since… well, since Hogwarts.</p><p>“So, Rey,” Professor Longbottom said on her other side as he filled his plate with mashed potatoes and roast chicken. “What have you been up to since I saw you last?”</p><p>“Um,” She said through a mouth filled with buttered toast. She held up her finger as she swallowed. “I did some work for the Ministry for about a year out of school, then I took up wandmaking. I’ve been selling my own for about three years.” She watched the impressed look cross her former professor’s face and felt the familiar rush of approval she had come to crave when she was a student. “How’s your family, Professor Longbottom?”</p><p>“Oh, God, call me Neville,” he replied with a dismissive wave. “I’m not your professor anymore!” He took in a spoonful of mashed potatoes. “My family’s great! The wife’s happy and Gran’s still going strong—she’ll probably outlive Nicolas Flamel at this point. I think her Elixir of Life is hidden in her vulture hat.”</p><p>Rey laughed and felt a nudge in her side from Poe. She excused herself from Professor Longbottom—Neville—and turned away, only to come face to face with Finn.</p><p>“I switched places,” he explained with a grin. “So, how do you feel? Are you excited?”</p><p>“Nervous,” Rey replied. “Nervous and excited. And nervous.”</p><p>“You’re gonna be amazing, Plutt,” Poe interjected on Finn’s other side, reaching across Finn’s shoulders and patting Rey solidly on the back. She cringed.</p><p>“Poe, please don’t call me that, we’re not on the Quidditch team anymore,” she begged, and Poe chuckled as he turned back to his food.</p><p>“Speak for yourself,” he grinned.</p><p>The main course was soon replaced by dessert and Rey helped herself to some pudding as Poe flicked a wad of frosting in Finn’s face. The caretaker wiped it off with his thumb and ate it, shaking his head and smiling at the coach softly. Rey eyed the end of the table as Ben Solo ate a biscuit and delicately sipped some tea. This was so far from the image she had of him that she couldn’t help but stare, only to quickly turn away when he made eye contact with her. She felt a blush on her cheeks and busied herself with watching the students and shoveling pudding into her mouth. When she glanced back at Ben Solo, he was no longer looking at her.</p><p>Conversation was dying down and finally, Headmistress McGonagall stood up. The students immediately fell silent and Rey herself felt the need to sit completely still as the Headmistress spoke.</p><p>“Welcome back, everyone,” she said curtly. “Please welcome our new Transfiguration teacher, Professor Plutt,” Rey cringed again at the name as she received a light smattering of polite applause. Once it quickly died down, the Headmaster continued speaking. “Once again, I’d like to announce that the Forbidden Forest is forbidden for a reason. Any student caught entering it without permission will be given an immediate detention, pending expulsion. Furthermore, students are reminded that anyone caught wandering the halls after hours will also be given an immediate detention, pending expulsion. ”</p><p>The students stared. You could hear a pin drop.</p><p>Poe leaned over to Finn and murmured, “The key word is <i>caught.</i>”</p><p>The Headmistress cleared her throat. “You all may go.”</p><p>***</p><p>Finn led Rey to a nondescript painting of a green, rocky island surrounded by crashing blue waves, not far from the Ravenclaw common room. He turned to her. “The default password is ‘Jedi.’”</p><p>“What the hell is that?”</p><p>“No idea. Nonsense.”</p><p>“I should change that.” Finn shrugged as the painting swung open to reveal a doorway. Rey saw her luggage had already been brought up for her, just like it had when she was a student. Her quarters was a small, airy room with a squashy bed and a faint scent of old books. As she looked at the blank stone walls, she made a silent plan to head down to Hogsmeade and pick out some decorations. </p><p>Finn lingered by the door. “You’re gonna be great, you know.”</p><p>Rey turned to him, pulled from her musings. “What?”</p><p>“I said you’re going to be an amazing teacher. You’re brilliant, and the students are going to love you. I know you’re nervous, but you shouldn’t be. Just don’t lecture them to sleep like Binns does, and you’ll be fine.”</p><p>Rey smiled. She hugged him tightly. “Thank you, Finn.”</p><p>Finn hugged her back and rested his chin on her shoulder comfortably. They pulled away and he was about to leave when he paused. “And, just… stay away from Ben Solo. I don’t know if I trust him.”</p>
