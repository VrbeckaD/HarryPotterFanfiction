    <p>
  <span>Dumbledore was a Prince of the Old Kingdom when Riddle, the best Knight, call sign Pitch, was given the position of guardian over the nightmare door</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Prince, he may have been, Dumbledore was given that sector of Stars to govern. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Riddle asked for assistance - Proud though he was, he knew he’d need help.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dumbledore was reluctant at first - Riddle was the best, he’d be able to resist the nightmares. But others? Would they be as strong? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Eventually, Dumbledore gives in and gives Riddle his Knights, Malfoy, Nott, LeStrange, Black, and Croaker. They were Riddle’s men at arms before this new assignment. They named their unit the Knights of Walpurgis </span>
</p><p>
  <span>All goes well for a while - but then - Riddle hears his daughter, Nagini behind the nightmare door. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The other knights try to stop him, but Riddle is the best of them - he’s been there for too long. The nightmares know. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He opens the door. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Riddle becomes Pitch, the Dark Lord and his knights, his generals astride tarry black night mares. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They ravage the world - these dark knights. The first strike is called Walpurgisnacht. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dumbledore’s royal family was cut down while he was away from the royal city. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dumbledore fights a grand battle, it’s huge and he takes out a couple of the generals. But, it’s not enough. He runs away. Fades. Takes up residence on the moon of earth. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Pitch and his remaining generals have taken the galaxy. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But one royal navy ship, Godric’s Hollow,  is left. It’s captained by Col. James Potter. His wife and young son are aboard. They all know, it’s fight and die now or run and die later. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They fight. Lily Potter, knowing that they will die, sends her son in a tiny comet ship away. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>With a great explosion, in that later no one knows the exact thing, Pitch is severely weakened, sent flying thru space (eventually landing on earth) his generals are either dead or scattered </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The Godric’s Hollow is lost. All souls aboard are gone. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Except for little Harry. Who’s in a stasis comet pod</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Riddle, the Dark Lord Pitch, has landed on earth. He is severely weakened, the nightmares have eaten his mind, he remembers someone named Nagini being important to him, but he can’t remember why or who - so he has found a snake, corrupted it with nightmare sand, and named it Nagini</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Pitch now lives on fear. Riddle is a name forgotten. He becomes the humans’ boogeyman. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>With what little influence Dumbledore still has, living on the moon in exile, he has appointed Guardians, of Memory, of Hope, of Wonder, of Dreams</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Fate brings Harry to Earth </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dumbledore cannot believe that the boy survived  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>but the stasis has been damaged somehow - Harry will die if he goes to earth as he is </span>
</p><p>
  <span>So dumbledore does the only thing he can, and it takes much of his remaining power - he moves Harry’s soul to a recently deceased boy in a pond </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The boy was selfless, a protector, a good force - everything he wants Harry to be. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>For, he knows that Fate has Marked Harry and assumes that Fate Mark is defeating Pitch once and for all </span>
</p><p>
  <span>After all, Harry's parents wounded him, it would be poetic justice for harry to strike the killing blow</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry is merged with Jack Overland</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The stasis pod in conjunction with the soul merge has suppressed and erased memories. The boy is raised from the pond, given the lion’s share of Dumbledore's remaining power and will</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When the boy wakes up - he does not know anything about either of his pasts, his name, or anything. Only that he knows the moon raised him from the pond. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Now begins 300 years of neglect from Dumbledore/Moon - as he has no more remaining powers. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Frost, as he goes by now, cannot be seen by normal people - a precaution built into him from the Moon </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But other supernatural beings can, but they seemingly avoid him - another precaution, Dumbledore wanted to protect Harry </span>
</p><p>
  <span>So, Frost spends the next 300 years alone, with only the wind as a friend, playing with the snow. His shepherd's crook has lightning, zigzag bend to it before the curved end </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Pitch knows of Frost, but does not, cannot know who he is </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Pitch attempts another power play to create fear and drown out all the lights </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Frost hangs on the periphery of this - helping children when and where he can - he’s extremely powerful as a spirit, but he has a neutral stance - most of the supernatural set respects and knows that (Pitch among them) </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The Guardians get the last desperate message from Dumbledore, the man in the moon, he names Frost the last guardian - Dumbledore dies </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The current Guardians are confused - they know of Frost - it’s been 300 years, and they know he’s a neutral spirit - why would the Man in the Moon choose him? Especially now when Pitch is making waves? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The Guardians, which the exception of Aster, have no idea the history behind MiM or Pitch </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Aster reveals what he knows - which is current up to the last stand of the Godric’s Hollow </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The Guardians wonder is Frost is somehow related to all this</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Meanwhile, even Pitch knows you don’t cross Frost or really hurt/hunt children - Frost allows nightmares and fear because fear keeps you alive  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>There’s a story in the supernatural community of a vicious redcap named Umbridge who was torturing kids for fun - The blizzard that Frost brought to bear (the blizzard that Bunny moans about) is legendary. (Bunny only cares about how it ruined his holiday, he doesn’t know about Umbridge) the community knows how deadly the cold can be</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Pitch goes too far, too drunk on his growing power and goes after the town of Hogwarts - Frost is there. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>This is the first time both of them see each other face to face </span>
</p><p>
  <span>At first, Pitch tries to tempt Frost, what goes better together than the cold and the dark - brings up the Umbridge incident, the neglect and the ignoring that the Man in the Moon (how Pitch knows this, eh.) just made him and then ignored - made it so he was ignored </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Frost has angst, but there are children - they are his self-driven mission </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Frost’s face, a picture of determination, bravery, anger knocks lose a Riddle memory </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Pitch sees Frost’s face and remembers Col Potter - remembers the debilitating pain, remembers the exile he’s suffering now - Pitch and Frost have a huge dust-up </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Frost keeping to the defensive as he doesn’t want to hurt the children nearby </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Pitch’s yelling about Potter and the Godric’s Hollow </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The other Guardians show up finally - they take over fighting Pitch (their weapons not being dangerous elemental powers) and Frost herds the kids back to safety </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The other Guardians heard the nonsense yelling about Potter and Godric’s Hollow - this makes sense to them as Aster told them some history </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The dust-up is over - and the guardians invite Frost to the Workshop for a debrief </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Frost is mostly ambivalent with them, as Pitch was right about them ignoring and avoiding him </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The Guardians explain how MiM had chosen him for the last guardian </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Both Frost and Bunny are against this appointment - Bunny because he still holds a grudge over the blizzard, but also because he doesn’t understand why Dumbledore chose the most neutral spirit ever. Frost because the guardians actively ignored or outright attacked (in bunny’s case) him in the past </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They try to explain what the Guardianship means - Frost already knows. He still refuses. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He will only ally with them against Pitch, but after that, he works alone. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Toothania offers his baby teeth for memories, as it’s brought to light that Frost doesn’t remember anything prior to being a spirit </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They go to the tooth palace, here Pitch has made his first official act of war against the guardians </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They lose Sandy - but not before it’s revealed just how powerful Frost is </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Pitch has found and gathered his three remaining generals, Malfoy, Nott, and Lestrange and Frost defeats them all soundly - sending only two back to limp back to their master </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Bunny is even more distrustful - he knows EXACTLY how strong those generals are - he fought against them before </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Frost gives them the idea of how to keep up the belief in Tooth but doesn’t participate </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He keeps watch </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Then they need to make sure Aster’s holiday goes off - But one of the Generals has grabbed one of the small children from Hogwarts and uses it to distract Frost while the other general and the nightmares destroy the warren </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The guardians return just as Frost has returned, he fought and killed the other general, and returned the child home - but he looks beat up and scruffy, fresh from a fight </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Bunny accuses him of leading the Nightmare General to the warren and helping </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Frost gets right up in Bunny’s face “If you believe that, truly believe that, then I cannot dissuade you. But, remember this Bunny, even though nothing goes together better than the Dark and the Cold -  I. Am. Still. Here.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Frost leaves the Warren, the 3 guardians are reeling at what they just learned - that Pitch tried to court Frost to his side and Frost had said no. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Bunny then makes the same connection that Pitch did - the face of a righteous Potter - Aster had known the Potters. And the dots connect, why Dumbledore was invested, why Pitch was yelling about Col Potter, why Frost is so powerful </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Pitch attempts to tempt Frost one more time, now that he’s down to only 1 general - he has Frost’s toothbox. Despite that Frost is the reason for Pitch being exiled - Frost files this away but doesn’t ask or rise to the bait</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He offers it for Frost to just stand aside </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Frost quotes, “The only thing for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing.”  “You crossed a line, Pitch. You know I don’t interfere, but you went after kids. You know what happens to those that do.” Here there are vignettes of humans and spirits alike who have hurt kids and Frost found out. They’ve died in the cold, lost limbs to frostbite, they’ve been eaten by wild animals. “You asked me once. I gave you an answer. That answer holds.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They have another dust-up. Pitch breaks the staff in an advantage which allows him to slip into Frost’s defence and delivers a killing blow</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A Babytooth is a witness </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Pitch leaves </span>
</p><p>
  <span>BabyTooth goes back to the other Guardians, retells the whole thing - North is spectacularly impressed - Frost is a warrior like North hasn’t seen for aeons. Tooth is impressed that Frost didn’t give into temptation. Bunny is ashamed for his accusations and even more convinced that Frost is a Potter - the last potter - the last star now has gone out</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Meanwhile - Inside Frost’s mind, the long covered but ancient starpeople’s inherent power rears up - and Frost lives. He fixes his staff, now that his full power is unlocked</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Frost knows who he is now. Both of them. He knows what Dumbledore did. He figures why he did. But now, he has to stop Pitch. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>There is a pitched battle going on near Hogwarts now - it looks like Pitch and his last General are winning. There is so much fear. The three remaining guardians are fighting the grief caused by the death of Frost. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Suddenly, a cold wind blows. No one really takes notice. But the temperature drops. The kids hurry inside, watching from windows. The one girl Pitch’s general had kidnapped is the first to notice. “It’s cold,” says one. “Look at the frost on the window,” said another. “Frost?” asks the girl, the others point to the glass, with fractal patterns growing on them. “FROST!” She shouts! She tells all the other kids. They believe her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Snow starts falling, the tiny granular kind that says it’s freezing. The ground locks up. The guardians begin to notice. The hail and snow are working in their favour. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Finally, there is a great blast of icy wind and a yell. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Pitch!” It’s Frost, riding the wind, staff fixed, and the man is glowing. He’s a star. He’s the winter. He is ice and rage and burning cold. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The last general, Nott, flees. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Pitch is flabbergasted. He killed the boy. He broke the staff. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Memories and flash - Riddle is pulled to the front - he knows this face, he knows those eyes - They destroyed him last time </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The guardians are aghast - Frost is back from the dead - he’s not what they thought </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Only Bunny really knows what Frost is </span>
</p><p>
  <span>In several very impressive moves, calling up ice and snow, riding the wind and snow drifts, Frost and Pitch fight </span>
</p><p>
  <span>With a final blast, Pitch realizes that Frost has been creating a cage of ice and snow while they’ve been fighting. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You have a choice, Riddle,” says Frost, “You give up this campaign, you go back to being the boogeyman and you live.” </span>
</p><p>“Never! I am the DARK LORD.”</p><p>“So be it.” And the icy cage collapses in on itself, crushing and burying Pitch until there is a muffled explosion of dark light and ice. </p><p>
  <span>With a gesture, Frost uses the wind to bring the last general to him. “Knight Nott,” Frost addresses him with the proper name and title, a lot of the shadows fall away from the knight. “You also have a choice. The world needs fear to survive. Fear is important. Will you be the boogeyman or will you choose death?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I will happily take the position.” Frost uses his starpeople power to bind Nott in his role and promise </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Frost sends Knight Nott away. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>With another, grander gesture, Frost instructs the winds to bring together all the nightmare sand that’s around. He creates a ball. And sends a bright white light at the ball of darkness from his staff. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The dark sand begins to slowly turn gold </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And if a few moments, Sandy has reemerged, alive and unharmed </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sandy recognizes a fellow Star, one of higher rank and bows to Frost </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Frost raises him up. “None of that. I am not he.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The other guardians approach, “We thought you were dead!” </span>
</p><p>“I was.”</p><p>“But…?”</p><p>“And then I wasn’t.” </p><p>
  <span>Frost makes another gesture and the field they’d been fighting on, which had turned into an arctic landscape, melts and returns to its former spring state. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Will you be a guardian now?” </span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“No.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why?” </span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“Because I am not a Guardian. I was Fate Touched and Dumbledore misread what that meant. I am to protect the balance. He thought balance meant the darkness was to be eradicated.” </span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“Balance?” </span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“Fear is necessary for survival, Bunny. The darkness and the light are to be equal. Just as there is day and night.” </span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“I will continue my impartial stance.” </span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span>“But you could do…”</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“Do what? Knight Nott will not rise up. He cannot. He will be what is needed. Just as I will.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>After that spring, a new belief rose up among humans. Of an impartial god, cold of manner, but warm of heart. Whose image was carved on merchant’s scales - for balance. </span>
