    <p>I myself had always had friends of all sorts. Of course they were all pure bloods like me, I mean my sort doesn't go hanging around with mudbloods and halfbloods. But after the Battle of Hogwarts I returned to finish school for my mum. I was beaten and mistreated by everyone. Especially Blaise and Pansy. I was ready to end it all, make it stop, take myself out of the picture. Until she showed up.</p><p>One early spring morning I woke up, miserable just because I actually woke up in the morning. The bruises on my face and body stung and pained me. A major Migraine filled my head and my busted lip was as swollen as ever. I let out a sigh mixed with a sob as I sat up. Hugging my knees to my chest I wondered what it would be like if I hadn't returned, if the war didn't happen, if I hadn't become a son of the Dark Lord. It hurt to think about.</p><p>Sadness washing over me as I stood up to get dressed for the day. I rubbed my arm painfully from the deep cuts a Gryffindor had made upon my skin. Throwing on my saggy dark green hoodie and some jeans I made my way to the library to clear my mind. Read a book or two and MAYBE do my homework for once. Not like it would make a difference. I was already failing all my subjects. Even my electives. </p><p>"Wand please" I heard from behind the counter. I sigh knowing what she meant. All of the teachers wouldn't le thg me have my wand on me, even in charms class. "Draco Malfoy, wand please" the librarian said again holding her hand out as if saying Hand it over now or there'll consequences. I turn and nod taking it out of my pocket and placing it in the hand of the old witch. "When you find a book go sit there..." she said pointing to the corner with my usual table. I nod againg and wander toward the bookshelf.</p><p>I pulled out a magical creatures book and slowly walked to the table I normally sit at. At least it sat at a window with the view of the black lake. When I look out I see a blonde girl, spinning with the breeze. I smile slightly seeing she hadn't changed a bit. It was good to see her happy again. Unlike the rest of the school. That loony girl, the one who saved my life.</p>
