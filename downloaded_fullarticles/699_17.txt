    <p align="center"> </p><p>There it was. The moment Scorpius Malfoy had been waiting for since… well, since a few years, really. Rose was straddling his lap and snogging him with the perfection that she put into everything she did. While stroking him right behind his ear with her left hand, her other one clawed into the front of his robes. Their bodies had gotten closer and closer so that now they were almost pressed together from top to bottom with Scorpius sliding back in his seat every time she tried to close that last distance left between them. However, now Scorpius had nowhere left to slide, with his back pressed firmly against the wooden head of the bed, so that finally, with a slight moan escaping her lips, Rose leaped forward until she was all snug against him. A shudder that definitely wasn’t caused by pleasure went through Scorpius and his tongue stopped moving against hers.</p><p>Rose must have noticed his hesitance because she stopped as well and separated their lips. Gasping for air she asked, “What is it?”</p><p><em>What is it</em>, <em>indeed</em>, Scorpius thought before he shook his head, trying to ignore the inner voice that was telling him <em>wrong, wrong, wrong!</em> and he pressed their lips together again. They quickly got back into it, or at least Scorpius was trying very hard to, when after a few more minutes, he felt her hand sneak from his chest down to his-</p><p>“Stop!” he shouted and startled Rose as well as himself. He didn’t really know what was wrong but something was off and he was not about to have his first time feeling so… uncomfortable.</p><p>“Oopsie! Sorry,“ he forced out in a laugh but went quiet quickly when he saw the look on Rose’s face. Her lips were pressed together in a thin line. She looked a mix of embarrassed and furious, which frightened him because he had often seen those expressions separately but never mixed into that very terrifying mask of horror. Scorpius kept silent as Rose scrambled to her feet, adjusted her robes with her nose held high, and then stormed out of the room without another word.</p><p>A breath of relief escaped his lips and Scorpius finally allowed himself to fall back into the bed and cover his eyes with a trembling hand.</p><p><em>Relief, really?</em> That wasn’t how ruining their plans to sleep together for the first time should have felt. But undoubtedly, that was exactly what he was feeling at that moment. Incredibly glad that he did not have to go through with it.</p><p>He didn’t move from his spot for at least another half an hour, all the while trying to figure out what the hell was wrong with him.</p><p> </p><p align="center">◊ ◊ ◊</p><p> </p><p>“So, tell me again,” Albus pondered, his voice quiet in an effort to keep his siblings, who were lying in their beds on the other side of the room from hearing, “why did you stop your girlfriend from shagging you when that’s all you’ve been talking about for the past six weeks?”</p><p>“Good question.” Scorpius turned to look at his friend next to him on the queen-sized bed and tried to imagine what Albus’s expression would be if the room weren’t pitch black. The Burrow had only so many rooms and during the summer holidays it got extremely crowded with all of the Weasleys coming for a visit. They were sharing a room with both Lily and James, who were already asleep in their separate beds. It was the middle of the night and James always insisted on drawing the blinds completely shut, so Scorpius could barely see his own hand in front of his face.</p><p>“I told you, you and Rose wouldn’t work out,” his best friend whispered. Scorpius wanted to tell him that that wasn’t the problem, but what did Scorpius really know. If he couldn’t even figure out why he had felt utter horror the moment the girlfriend he should be in love with had tried to touch his cock, then Scorpius just couldn’t be trusted to be consulted on his own relationship.</p><p>“I just don’t understand why she got that angry,” Scorpius whined, thinking back to how Rose had sought him out hours after the incident and told him that it was over because she wasn’t interested in playing childish games and wanted a normal adult relationship that included sex. <em>I am tired of waiting around for you,</em> she had said with an annoyed tone, like they’d been dating for years instead of six weeks. And then she had just walked out on him.</p><p>“Scorpius, you’re a sappy romantic, and Rose is all,” he felt Albus move his hand about, probably trying to make a precise gesture to tell him what he couldn’t put into words before he seemed to realise that Scorpius couldn’t possibly see him and concluded, “business!” He let his hand drop. “You know she has her whole life planned out. Be Quidditch captain by year six. Join the Holyhead Harpies after graduation.” Scorpius knew that was true. “She probably has a checklist that says <em>July 22<sup>nd</sup>: Shag Scorpius Malfoy</em> and you just messed that up for her.”</p><p>All of that was likely, but it still didn’t make this outcome any less frustrating. Scorpius had been so excited when she had asked him out, right before the end of their fifth year. He had thought she was finally returning his feelings and their beautiful love story could start, but instead, here he was, not two months later, dumped because he hadn’t wanted to shag her on Percy Weasley’s old wiry mattress.</p><p>“It just didn’t feel right. What was I supposed to do? Just let her have her way with me and take my flower?” Scorpius was starting to feel angry rather than frustrated now. His friend was supposed to be on his side, why was he excusing Rose’s behaviour?</p><p>“No, you did the right thing not <em>giving her your flower</em>,” Albus quickly replied, the mocking in his voice impossible to miss. But then he sighed because he had probably picked up on the change in Scorpius’ mood. “You don’t owe her anything. I’m just saying that I warned you about her.” And Scorpius could feel Albus shrug in front of him.</p><p>He said nothing to that.</p><p>Not in a million years had he thought his first romantic relationship would turn out like this.</p><p>After a few minutes of quiet, Scorpius noticed Albus’ breathing had turned slower and more even. Turning on his back, he glanced at the ceiling that had those shiny muggle star-shaped stickers stuck to it that Arthur had been obsessed with and put up into all of his children’s bedrooms many decades ago.</p><p>Thinking about the chance for a great romance that had just slipped past him, Scorpius felt a few tears roll down the side of his face. It didn’t take him long to realise that his sadness had nothing to do with losing Rose, though, but everything to do with the fear that there was something else lurking in the dark of Scorpius’ mind that would change his life forever.</p><p>Feeling scared and guilty, Scorpius fell into a dreamless sleep.</p><p> </p><p align="center">◊ ◊ ◊</p><p> </p><p>He spent the following week with the Potters and Weasleys at the Burrow trying to come to terms with the fact that he was yet again single and that something was wrong with him for being the only teenage boy his age who had not jumped at the idea of shagging his girlfriend. Thankfully, it didn’t take Scorpius long to figure out what exactly that was.</p><p>On July 31<sup>st</sup> 2022, Harry Potter celebrated his 42<sup>nd</sup> birthday. It was a sunny day in Devon so Molly had conjured an enormous table that accommodated the whole clan and sat it outside of the Burrow. They were singing <em>Happy Birthday</em> to Harry when Teddy suddenly apparated out of nowhere and smacked a blue cream pie into Harry’s face, running off towards the house hysterically. Everybody was laughing and screaming, food was being thrown and Scorpius could already hear his dad scold him for ruining his expensive clothes, but at that moment all he wanted was to feel the joy of a huge happy family who all loved each other, who loved <em>him, </em>and feel like one of their own. He just wanted to forget all the confusing and scary thoughts that had been haunting him.</p><p>Seizing a handful of chocolate ice cream from the bowl in front of him, he made for his first target and then felt the cold mush connect with the face of James Potter who turned to him, an insane look on his face. “Oh no, you didn’t!”</p><p>Moments later, he found himself in a neck lock, James shoving a big portion of ice cream down his shirt, making Scorpius scream in shock and bliss at the sudden refreshing coldness that was running down his back. “Take that, Malfoy!”.</p><p>He had just escaped the grasp of Albus’ brother when he looked up and saw Harry at the other end of the table, pulling off his cake-smeared t-shirt and revealing a huge stag tattoo peeking out from underneath his chest hair. Scorpius heart skipped a beat as he watched Harry throw the piece of fabric to the side before he launched himself at Teddy, picking the grown man up like he weighed nothing and throwing him over his shoulder. Harry looked so free and happy, his face pulled into a wide grin and his eyes twinkling with life.</p><p>With Harry in such a clear view, the sunlight dancing on his bronze skin and Scorpius’ heart beating faster than usual, the realisation hit him like a Bludger in the face. He finally understood why he and Rose hadn’t worked out and what hidden desires had been keeping Scorpius’ on the edge for the past days.</p><p>There was nothing wrong with <em>him </em>per se. <em>Rose</em> had just been the wrong choice as a romantic partner for him. Because what Scorpius wanted was someone like Harry. Someone who could make him feel safe and protected. Someone who was tall and broad. Someone who was strong enough to pick him up and carry him around.</p><p>“A bloke,” Scorpius whispered to himself and barely registered that Albus had come to a halt next to him and was looking at him in question at his sudden silence. “Albus?” Scorpius said, still starring at Harry who had now, somehow, summoned a huge pool and was making quite the show out of running towards it and dumping Teddy, who was screaming bloody murder, right into it.</p><p>“Scorpius?”</p><p>He turned to his friend and admitted in a whisper, “I think I might be into blokes.”</p><p>The moment those words had left his lips, he knew that they were true. For one, they felt more right than anything he had ever felt with Rose, and second, Scorpius couldn’t ignore the feeling of his cock reacting to the display of Harry Potter half-naked, more fit than most Quidditch players.</p><p>For a second, Albus looked a little taken aback and it scared Scorpius. Maybe Albus wouldn’t be as accepting as he had thought, or as he would have thought if Scorpius had even had enough time to think about it before he had confessed this to his best mate. But it only took his friend a split second before he was smiling back at Scorpius.</p><p>And then he shoved a piece of pie in Scorpius’ face.</p><p> </p><p align="center">◊ ◊ ◊</p><p> </p><p>“Are you sure?” Albus asked him, rubbing his chin between his forefinger and thumb while looking down at the rising and falling chest of his sleeping dad.</p><p>It was the day after Scorpius’ huge gay revelation and Albus had woken him up at 7 AM in the morning, having the urge to take a swim. Scorpius and him had put on their swimming trunks and gone down to make use of the giant pool Harry had conjured the day before only to discover that someone had already vanished it.</p><p>So now, according to Albus, the only logical step to take was to wake his sleeping father and demand he conjures another one. But on their way back up into the room that Harry and Ginny were currently sharing, they had discovered Albus’ dad sleeping on the sofa in the living room, a thin layer of blankets wrapped around his thighs and knees, barely covering his crotch, for which Scorpius was unthinkably thankful for. As much as he would have liked to get a peak at Harry’s nether regions, he was not ready to admit the sexual attraction he felt towards Harry to Albus yet.</p><p>Albus was still staring at his dad when suddenly the hand that had been fondling his own chin shot down to slightly pull at his dad’s chest hair. “Men are so hairy and sweaty. You sure you’re into this?”</p><p>For some reason, Scorpius couldn’t take his eyes off of the display in front of him. Albus’s fingers tugged at the dark locks of his father’s chest hair, right between his pecs. It was an intoxicating sight even if slightly disturbing.</p><p>“Yea,” he nodded and swallowed hard, “Definitely. No doubt at all. Clear as glass. Hard as stone. Slimy as Gillyweed. This is it. Flat chest. Sweat. Hair. I want all of it. Preferably in my mouth,“ he stopped himself as he noticed that he’d started babblings and that Albus was just staring at him in silence, “but not in a gross way!” He tried to ease the blow. “In a very appropriate and romantic way!”</p><p>His friend’s hand stilled and Scorpius looked up at his face. Albus had furrowed his eyebrows in a very Albus-y way that usually meant that he thought someone had said or done something stupid. And then, as if in slow motion, it turned into disgust. Scorpius’ heart stopped beating for a second.</p><p>“I just realised something horrific,” Albus whispered and looked down at his dad again. “I’ll be just as disgustingly hairy as him once I’m all grown up, won’t I?”</p><p>A bark of laughter left Scorpius’ lips, relief washing over him once more and he sacked into his knees a little. “Don’t worry, Albus, I bet a lot of women are into it.”</p><p>A small smile played on Albus’ lips but his eyebrows were still pulled together as his fingers continued their ministration on his dad’s chest hair. “I don’t care. I’m gonna shave it all off anyway.”</p><p>Grinning, Scorpius tried very hard not to look at Harry Potter’s chest when Albus went on, “I bet he’s got hair in his arse crack as well.” And as he looked down at his dad, for a second there Scorpius feared that Albus might want to check - with Scorpius standing right there! - but before anything more inappropriate could happen, a glint of something mischievous blinked in Albus’ eyes. And then the fingers curled into his dad’s chest hair gripped and pulled and Harry Potter awoke with a loud yell.</p><p>“Fucking bullocks, this hurts like shit, fuck-.“ Harry moaned in pain and when he realised what was happening, that his son and his best friend were standing next to him and Albus had woken him up in maybe the worst way possible with a smug little smile on his face, Harry just growled, “Albus.”</p><p>“We wanna go swim, old man! Pool! Now!” Albus shouted at his face and then ran off in a flair of maniac laughter, probably thinking Harry would chase him.</p><p>Scorpius looked at Harry Potter and Harry Potter looked back at him and there was a tired sort of smile on his face as he blinked up at Scorpius and said, “Remember when he used to be really depressed and didn’t want to have anything to do with me?” Scorpius nodded and Harry’s face broke into a sarcastic grin when he said, “Never thought I would miss those times.” And then he broke off into a run and Scorpius watched as the two chased each other through the Burrow and woke up the whole Weasley clan in a matter of seconds with Scorpius heart pounding hard at the sight of their happiness.</p><p> </p><p align="center">◊ ◊ ◊</p><p> </p><p>Life as a gay boy at boarding school was… different. Unlike his straight roommates, who had to resort to smuggling muggle porno magazines into their beds, Scorpius had infinite opportunities to get himself all riled up for a hot wank by ogling naked boys in the showers or their room while changing their clothes. Or so he had thought.</p><p>Unfortunately for Scorpius, he quickly found that he liked his men broad, strong and… well, more manly than what Hogwarts had to offer. It was almost no wonder he had never noticed his sexuality before. It was not like kids his age usually looked like the type that made Scorpius’ loins tingle, with their unproportionate lanky bodies and their soft babyfaces. There were, however, a few sevenths-year boys in the Slytherin Quidditch team that came at least close to that image. Yet, weirdly enough, nobody affected him as Harry Potter had back at the Burrow.</p><p>After his birthday, Scorpius had only stayed with the Potter-Weasleys for a few more days in which he had tried to spend as much time with Harry as possible, hoping to get another look at that tattoo. Not a single opportunity having made itself clear by the morning he was to leave for the Manor, Scorpius had blurted out, “Please Harry, can I see your tattoo again?” Ginny had laughed so hard she had almost knocked over her glass of orange juice.</p><p>Harry hadn’t looked embarrassed at all, only asking, “Which one?” with a wink and then proceeded to eat his pancakes.</p><p>Needless to say, his request had been ignored and Scorpius had not seen his—apparently multiple!— tattoos again.</p><p>“Do you think there are any other gay boys at Hogwarts?” Scorpius asked Albus on a Saturday night after they had came back from Hogsmeade and were squeezed into one armchair in the Slytherin common room together.</p><p>Albus swallowed the head of his chocolate frog before he shrugged his shoulders, “I bet. The question is, how are you gonna find them? None of them are out.”</p><p>That was the problem.</p><p>“I’ve been thinking,” Scorpius said and then looked around, “of coming out myself.” At that Albus stopped chewing and looked at his friend with wide eyes. “I don’t think anybody will think twice about it and I know it would make me feel better. Not having to hide, you know?”</p><p>Nodding, Albus leaned against Scorpius’ shoulder and popped the last piece of his snack in his mouth, “Have you told your dad yet?”</p><p>“No,” Scorpius sighed. He had been thinking about how to break the news to his dad. Surely, his dad would accept it and still love him the same. After all, he knew that he was the most precious person in his father’s life but… it still filled him with dread, the possibility of disappointing his father. “I was thinking of writing him a letter.”</p><p>“Well,” Albus was looking at him now. “As long as he hears it from you. I think my dad would flip out if he heard such important information about his kids from someone else or worse-,“ Albus paused for dramatic effect—something he had been doing more often recently, probably due to Scorpius’ influence,—“from the Prophet!”</p><p>A laugh escaped his lips at the image of Harry reading news about his kid’s sexuality in the morning Prophet and going bat shit crazy before flying over himself and confronting them about it. “I highly doubt the Prophet would care about <em>my</em> sexuality.”</p><p>Albus shrugged his shoulders again, “Who knows? You <em>are</em> a Malfoy and homosexuality is still a huge deal in our backward society, so I wouldn’t put it past them.”</p><p><em>Right</em>, Scorpius thought but felt he was much more interested in something else.</p><p>“Do you think Harry would mind?” Scorpius asked quietly, not really knowing why his thoughts had taken him in that direction and seeing a similar wonder in Albus’ eyes. “I mean if one of his kids turned out to be gay. Do you think he would be disappointed?”</p><p>Albus was opening his second chocolate frog when he looked up with a snort, “Seeing that my dad is bisexual, that would be quite hypocritical of him, don’t you think?”</p><p>Scorpius almost choked on a bit of spit right then.</p><p>“Wait,” he stammered and was searching for a sign in Albus’ face that told him he had made that up but he looked completely serious. “Are you for real? Harry is bisexual?”</p><p>“Oh,” Albus reacted as if he had made a mistake. “You didn’t know? I thought,” he stopped and looked around before he continued more quietly. “I thought everybody knew? There were articles about him dating a guy in the Prophet before he got together with my mum.”</p><p>Dumbfounded, Scorpius let his mouth drop open and continued in a voice that came out more like a shrill than expected. “And after all this talk about me wondering about other homosexuals, you didn’t think it would have been appropriate to bring up that your dad - that Harry Potter, the saviour of the wizarding world! - liked cock?”</p><p>“Ew.” A disgusted noise sounded from Albus’ lips and his face scrunched up in a painful expression. “Don’t talk about my dad liking any kind of genitalia please,” he started before he added, “and I really thought you knew! Everybody knows!”</p><p>Scorpius spluttered as he was sure that that couldn’t be true. After all he had read many books about Harry in his early childhood and none had mentioned that in the slightest. But then two first-year girls on a nearby sofa turned to him and said, “Yea, it's common knowledge.” “My uncle says he snogged Harry Potter at a bar once!” They turned away again, giggling.</p><p>“See?” Albus said, pointing at the girls with a disturbed smile on his face. “Everybody!”</p><p>“Well, drown me in a pool of troll snot!” Scorpius gasped, feeling as dumbstruck as he had felt when he had first found out that Santa had just been a crazy wizard with a time-turner.</p><p>Harry Potter liked cock and Scorpius felt like he didn’t know the world anymore.</p><p> </p><p align="center">◊ ◊ ◊</p><p> </p><p>A few days later, after pondering and pondering how to break the news to his dad—the news about his own sexuality, not Harry’s! Though Scorpius couldn’t help but wonder whether his dad knew and if he did, why in Merlin’s beard he had never mentioned it—Scorpius sent an owl to his dad. Short and sweet he wrote:</p><p>
  <em>Dear father,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>It seems I like my ladies like I like my fish. Not at all. But sausages, yes, I do like me some sausages. And of course, I am referring both to the literal and the metaphorical sausage here. I have no doubt that you can identify the meaning behind that metaphor. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Albus says hi.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Love,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Scorpius</em>
</p><p>Scorpius was a shaking mess until the next morning. He dreaded his father’s reply more than he had expected and not even Albus could distract him from the horror scenarios that he was picturing in his head. His dad writing how disappointed he was in Scorpius. His dad disowning him. Obviously, Scorpius was aware that it was very unlikely that his father would react that way but unfortunately that didn’t stop him from thinking about it any less.</p><p>Finally, at breakfast in the Great Hall his owl dropped off the dreaded reply from his father.</p><p>
  <em>Dear Scorpius,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I am surprised to hear that. I was of the impression that you were still dating Rose Granger-Weasley and rather smitten with her. Anyway, I’m sorry for just assuming on my own accord and thank you for telling me. Know that I am proud of you. This must have taken a lot of courage to tell me.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>On another note, I’m about to send another owl with your favourite sweets. Please enclose a list of items that you would like me to include in your next parcel. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Whatever your reply, please know that I don’t mind your preference in… sausages. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>I love you always.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Say Hi back to Albus.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Dad</em>
</p><p>Scorpius clutched the letter to his chest and thanked Merlin for having the most incredible dad in the world before he shared the wonderful news with his friend.</p><p> </p><p align="center">◊ ◊ ◊<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>That Christmas was the first time everybody noticed that something wasn’t right in the Potter household. The atmosphere was everything but festive despite Ginny having gone out of her way to make the usually dull Grimmauld Place look as bright and warm as the Burrow, with magically summoned fairy lights, mistletoe, and all kinds of Christmassy crap plastered all over the place, almost to a disturbing extent. Harry and Ginny were barely talking to each other and Scorpius once overheard Teddy and James talking about <em>something something divorce! something something</em>. Looking back, it had been a bad sign that Ginny had made Harry sleep on the sofa on his own birthday in the summer.</p><p>It was the second day of Christmas and Albus was busy playing a round of exploding snap with his siblings when Scorpius came back into the room with a mug of hot chocolate just to notice that Harry was sitting outside on the terrace, alone.</p><p>Looking over his shoulder and making sure that Albus was preoccupied one more time, Scorpius turned towards the door and walked out into the cold crisp air where Harry was staring out into the dark garden.</p><p>“What are you doing here alone, Harry?” Scorpius asked and held out his mug of steaming liquid towards the man. Harry seemed surprised to see him before he smiled.</p><p>“Just thinking,” Harry said and took the chocolate from Scorpius. It was obvious that he was troubled. He took a long sip of cocoa before handing the mug back, “Why are you not playing with the other kids?”</p><p>“Oh, I was but then I lost,” Scorpius shrugged in nervous laughter, “Exploding Snap. One of the many things I do not excel in.”</p><p>That made a smile appear on Harry’s lips before he chuckled, “Same here.”</p><p>They sat in silence for a while with Harry starring at the leaves moving in the wind and Scorpius staring at Harry. Occasionally, they passed the mug back and forth until it was almost empty and Scorpius finally scrapped up all the courage to ask, “Are you alright?”</p><p>Harry stared at him for a long moment before he smiled a little and breathed, “I honestly don’t know.” He didn’t look away immediately and Scorpius wondered what he was thinking precisely at that moment while looking into Scorpius’ eyes like he was really looking at him for the first time, which Scorpius realised that… maybe he was. Maybe up until now Scorpius had only ever been Draco’s weird cheerful son that Albus seemed to like. But now suddenly, by asking Harry a personal question, he had turned into… something else. Maybe something more.</p><p>“Albus loves you. And so do Lily and James. They won’t love you less for,” Scorpius had wanted to continue with <em>leaving Ginny and moving out </em>but he realised that while he’d been speaking Harry’s eyes had gone really wide and his face really pale. It didn’t seem like Harry had been aware that everybody knew that there was trouble in paradise especially not that weird blond kid. So to not shock him any more than he apparently already had, he concluded, “anything. They won’t stop loving you for anything. Because you are their dad. A great dad.”</p><p>For a moment it looked like Harry was going to just keep looking at Scorpius with that dumfounded expression on his face. Scorpius feared he had overstepped a line, already practicing an apology for being too nosy in his head when the man’s lips finally turned into a wide smile and he whispered, “Thanks, Scorp.”</p><p>At that smile, and that tone, and that nickname, Scorpius’ heart started beating hard in his chest. He shook his head as if to say <em>Don’t mention it</em> and Harry finally looked away again, taking a long sip from the mug of cocoa before he pulled back his hand and looked into it with a frown. “Sorry, I finished it.” He stood up, pushing off the blanket that had been wrapped around his shoulders on the small bench and Scorpius quickly followed suit. “Let me make you a new one.”</p><p>Harry walked past Scorpius to get to the door but Scorpius had formed the same plan of getting another drink for them at the exact same time and grasped for the mug, so that now the two of them were squeezed together in the entrance to the house, hands touching over the still-warm mug and looking at each other.</p><p>Until that day, Scorpius had always thought Albus’ eyes were just as green as his dad’s but being so close to Harry for the first time in his life, he noticed that that was not, in fact, true. The green of Harry’s eyes was much more intense and made Scorpius feel like he was staring into the depth of the ocean.</p><p>“Close the door, it’s getting cold,” James called from the living room and Scorpius suddenly noticed that he was staring open-mouthed at Harry while holding his hands. He snapped them back so fast, he would have tripped back if it wasn’t for the fact that he was already leaning against one side of the doorway.</p><p>“Are you ok?” It was Harry who mouthed the question this time. He gazed down at him in wonder before he put the back of his hand against Scorpius’ forehead. “You are really red.” A gasp escaped Scorpius’ lips, and he felt every place Harry had touched burn like fire—his hands, his forehead.</p><p>“I’m splendid. Never better,” he spluttered out, hoping that it sounded convincing before he forced a smile on his lips that probably made him look like he was constipated, because that was exactly what Scorpius felt like at that moment. There was something there in his head that wanted to come out, that wanted to be put into words or at least into thoughts, but it just wouldn’t and it made Scorpius squirm.</p><p>Looking unsure at first, Harry finally nodded slowly. And then he just had to glance up following which his face broke into a grin. “You know what this means?” he asked, pointing at the twig over his head. Right at the moment that Scorpius saw the mistletoe dangling right above their heads, Harry had already leaned forward and said, “Come here, kiddo,” before pressing a wet smack on his still burning forehead, right where his fingers had been only moments ago.</p><p>The touch was short, hard, and way too wet and if anybody but Harry had done it, Scorpius would have grunted in disgust and pulled away immediately. Instead, he heard Lily and Albus, who must have witnessed the attack on Scorpius, make similarly grossed-out sounds from somewhere in the living room.</p><p>Harry laughed and finally left for the kitchen, probably to make the promised mug of cocoa, but Scorpius was dumbstruck, breathing unevenly as he made the second huge discovery about himself that year.</p><p>“Scorpius Malfoy,” he mumbled to himself, a hand clutching at the shirt above his heart like he was a character from a tragic romance movie, “you’ve got a crush on your best mate’s dad!”</p><p>And with that, finally, that feeling of mental constipation was gone.</p>
