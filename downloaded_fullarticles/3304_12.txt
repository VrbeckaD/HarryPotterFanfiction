    <p>Harry dropped his bag, letting it sprawl out messily on the ground beside Ron and Hermione. He fell back and landed on the couch, draping his arm over his eyes dramatically.</p><p>“Harry, honestly.” Hermione rolled her eyes as she quickly shoved an array of parchment and quills back into it.</p><p>“What’s with the theatrics, Mate?” Ron asked through a full mouth. He seemed to have brought a to-go plate with him from the feast.</p><p>“I can’t do this.”</p><p>“Do what?”</p><p>“I made a bet.”</p><p>Ron’s eyes widened. He scooted closer, looking eager. “About what?”</p><p>“It's…” Harry hesitated.</p><p>Hermione sighed and turned back to her homework. “Just tell him, Harry.”</p><p>“You know?” Ron asked, sounding slightly offended. “Well, gee, thanks for letting me in on it.”</p><p>“I just heard it as a rumor. Don’t get mad.”</p><p>“I’m not mad…” Ron said, although he was pouting a bit.</p><p>“Wait, it's spreading about the school?” Harry sat up straighter.</p><p>“Apparently,” Hermione said nonchalantly, still scribbling on her parchment.</p><p>“What is?” Ron said exasperatedly.</p><p>“Dean bet that I… That I couldn’t get Malfoy to go on a date with me by the end of the week.”</p><p>Ron blinked, at a loss for words. “… You-”</p><p>“Here it comes,” Hermione said under her breath.</p><p>“You’re trying to ask out Malfoy?” Ron exclaimed a bit too loudly. A few students turned their heads, but otherwise, the common room was relatively empty.</p><p>“Ron!” Said Harry.</p><p>“Sorry, sorry.” Ron looked around, slightly ashamed. “But I thought you were dating that other bloke I set you up with. Also,” His face contorted in disgust, “Malfoy?”</p><p>“I know, I know.” Harry mirrored his expression. “But Seamus said that I could get any guy I wanted, which made Dean mad, so he said I couldn’t get anyone. Then Seamus said, ‘Name one bloke he couldn’t get,’ so Dean bet him I couldn’t get a date with Malfoy.</p><p>“And, I’m sorry, Ron, but I never ended up going on the date you set up.”</p><p>Ron looked hurt, “Why not?”</p><p>“I just-”</p><p>“Wait, wait,” Hermione intervened, the conversation finally piquing her interest. “This isn’t even your own bet?”</p><p>“Er….”</p><p>“Oh, Harry.”</p><p>“They forced me into it!”</p><p>“You could have gotten out of it, mate.” Ron shook his head.</p><p>“Maybe he didn’t want to,” Hermione ventured.</p><p>“Wha-?”</p><p>Ron wrinkled his nose, “Harry, tell me it’s not true.”</p><p>“It’s not!”</p><p>Hermione smirked, “Of course.”</p><p>“I do not want to go on a date with-”</p><p>Suddenly, Hermione squeezed his knee tightly, making him yelp.</p><p>“Merlin, Hermione, that hurts!”</p><p>“Shush!” She whispered, glancing towards the common room entrance.</p><p>Harry turned to see Malfoy ducking in, a few school books in hand. He caught sight of the group, but quickly stuck his nose in the air, walking towards the dorm rooms.</p><p>Harry heard Ron whisper behind him, “Think he knows about the bet?” and watched as the pink in Malfoy cheeks brightened to a deep red. He quickened his pace, disappearing around the corner.</p><p>“… Yeah.” Harry murmured.</p><p>There was a pause as Harry continued to stare at the spot where Malfoy vanished. Hermione cleared her throat.</p><p>“So… What now, mate?” Ron asked.</p><p>Harry turned back to them, a slight pink creeping up his neck.</p><p>“I think I need to help Seamus win that bet.”</p>
