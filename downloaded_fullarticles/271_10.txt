    <p>If I had to pinpoint exactly when things went from the faintly ridiculous to the downright bizarre, it was probably around the day seven mark, although they had been steadily leading up to that from day one. <em>Hurtling </em>towards bizarredom, you might say. And you wouldn’t be far wrong.</p><p>Potter would disagree of course. But then the plight of the bull-headed is that they never fail to miss what’s staring them in the face. And I suppose anything will seem run-of-the-mill when compared with finding out at eleven that you can do magic and then having to defeat a three-headed dog, a two-faced teacher inhabited by the darkest wizard there's ever been, and a one-eyed polyjuiced Order member.</p><p>In any event, we were where we were, in some sort of Mexican Wizarding stand-off the likes of which haven’t been seen or at least documented since my great great great aunt Ursa sent a fruit basket as a thank you gift to Wendemere and Gallston Burke and sparked a two-year gift-giving loop, which Mother still talks about to this day given half an opportunity and glass of Pedro Ximénez. </p><p>The first I knew about the whole debacle, of course, was when the owl arrived at my window at the unseemly hour of 1.30am on the morning of December the 3rd. </p><p>I reluctantly hauled myself out from under the eiderdown and opened the window to let the brown owl in, and a flurry of wet snowflakes along with it. </p><p><em>Malfoy!!! </em>the parchment read. With not one, but <em>three </em>vulgar exclamation marks. The handwriting was unmistakable, and my eyes forcibly rolled themselves in my head.</p><p>
  <em>Need your help! Come through tomorrow anytime after eleven. Floo address attached. Will explain all then.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>You’re a pal! </em>
</p><p><em>Harry, </em>and then he'd added in brackets,<em> (Potter). </em></p><p>My eyes were now aching from rolling. Honestly, what <em>other</em> Harry did I know that would be boorish enough to send owls at such an ungodly hour?</p><p>I could scarcely believe it. ‘You’re a pal’? A <em>pal</em>? Draco Malfoy is nobody’s <em>pal</em>. The fact that I was helplessly in love with him was entirely irrelevant. If Potter thought that my sharing a drink with him and the rest of the Auror trainees every couple of weeks made us all <em>pals… </em>well. </p><p>Well, in all honesty, I hadn’t thought about it quite like that. And frankly I didn’t care to at that time of the morning. Which is why I cast aside the ridiculous summons, drew the curtains, snuggled under my duvet and went back to sleep.</p>
<hr/><p>It bloody pained me, but there was no other way. </p><p>I was in over my head. I needed Malfoy’s help. Even <em>Ron </em>agreed. </p><p>And Neville. </p><p>Yep, that’s right, I consulted Neville as well. Well, he’s pureblood too. But even he said this was beyond his knowledge or experience. Life with his gran didn’t cover such things. </p><p>And I know what you’re going to say, but this was one thing that Hermione’s vast knowledge couldn't help me with. Didn’t stop her trawling the library for me anyway though, good egg that she is.</p><p>So, it had to be Malfoy. Ugh. Not that I disliked the bloke anymore, I just— I don’t know, hate asking him for help. I could just imagine his smuggery reaching epic proportions. </p><p>I dithered so long over it that it was 1am before I summoned the balls to write to him. For some reason it was important to get the tone just right, not too familiar, I knew Malfoy hated that. His eyes went all squinty when I was too familiar, and he fidgeted with his collar.</p><p>I reckon I did alright though, because there he was at eleven on the dot the following morning, sharp in pressed navy-blue robes, hair shiny and neatly combed, pursing his pale pink lips as only a Malfoy can. </p><p>I don’t know why I felt nervous, I saw him every bloody day at training school. Saw him raise slim fingers in class when he knew the answer to a question, watched his adam’s apple bob as he cleared his throat before answering. Heard his grunts as he dodged hexes in duelling training, the soft slurp he made as he took a first sip of ale, and the sigh of satisfaction as it went down. He was familiar to me now, in a multitude of benign ways, and I felt nothing of the wariness and distrust towards him like I had done at Hogwarts. So I really don’t know why there was a tightness coiling in the pit of my stomach. He’d never been in my house before, I suppose that was it. He was a pretty judgy git at the best of times.</p><p>Thankfully I’d read up on pureblood etiquette—well I had to, didn't I?—and Kreacher laid out elevenses in the Morning Room. Malfoy seemed to relax when I showed him through. I know<em> I</em> did on seeing the two furrows bisecting his eyebrows disappear. </p><p>“What exactly is it you require of me, Potter?" he snapped. Pretty ungraciously I thought, seeing as he’d been served the French Earl Grey I know he likes. Still, I had dragged him out here with no explanation, so I was lucky my balls were still between my legs and hadn’t been hexed to my forehead. </p><p>“Er... well,” I began, and he rolled his eyes at me. He had a habit of doing that.</p>
<hr/><p>It was curious seeing Potter in his native habitat. He clearly doesn’t feel the need to shave at weekends, the shadow of stubble that eclipsed his face that morning giving him a rough veneer and leaving me a little on the nonplussed side. A feeling that wasn’t helped any by the tight orange t-shirt he was wearing and the Muggle sporting trousers that appeared to be an unsuitable size, if the way they were slung immodestly low on his hipbones was any indication. </p><p>His aging house-elf showed me through to a well-appointed room where tea was poured from dainty teapot into matching china cups. Things were looking up. There were even saucers.</p><p>After several minutes, it became apparent Potter was having trouble getting to his point, and I was beginning to suspect there was in fact no point, and that he’d simply invited me around for over-steeped tea, own-brand custard creams, and the most awkward chat known to Wizarding kind. However, a few well-placed glares and barbed remarks on my part soon had him warbling like a dying jobberknoll. </p><p>“Just spit it out, Potter, I haven’t got all day, and I’m in no mood for guessing games, having had an unexpected interruption to my sleep last night.”</p><p>“I need your help,” he gritted out in what looked to be a rather uncomfortable fashion. “I’ve been sent gifts.”</p><p>“Bully for you. I don’t see how—”</p><p>“Pureblood gifts. A custom of some sort, I need you to—”</p><p>“Oh no,” I held my hand up. “If you think I’m getting involved in some courting ritual you’ve got yourself entangled in, you can think again. You’re on your own with this, Potter. I can’t believe you—” <em>of all people</em>, I thought but didn’t voice, “would expect me to help—”</p><p>“It’s your father,” Potter blurted.</p><p>“I beg your pardon? What about my father?”</p><p>“<em>Well</em>, he’s been sending me gifts. And I—”</p><p>“He’s been <em>what</em>? You’re trying to tell me <em>my father</em> is wooing <em>you</em>? My father, who was released from Azkaban a mere eight days ago <em>and </em>has been happily married for twenty-four years. Of all the outlandish—” </p><p>“No Malfoy, you’ve got it wrong. But I can’t tell you if you keep on bloody interrupting.”</p><p>So I kept quiet. But it was a monumental struggle, I can tell you. </p><p>“It started three days ago,” he explained, “when I received a random gift of a partridge, with a—”</p><p>“Wait, did you say a partridge? A partridge, as in the bird?” This was another interruption, granted, but, <em>be fair</em>, he did just say ‘partridge’.</p><p>“Yeah. An actual bird in a cage, clucking like a bloody chicken and shitting everywhere, and there was a note saying,”—and here Potter produced a small embossed card from the pocket of his faded leisurewear—“<em>‘To Mr Harry Potter, Please accept this token of my gratitude for your testimony on behalf of my wife and son. Further, it has come to my attention that my son owes you a life debt following events at the battle at Hogwarts. I seek your kinship on behalf of my obeisant son and heir, that we may ally our ancient families just as we were of old, before wars forced us to choose sides, and in doing so satisfy the covenant. Your humble confederate, Mr Lucius Malfoy.’</em> … Well.” He took off his glasses and rubbed his eyes. “You can probably imagine how gobsmacked I was. Three years after the trials, to be sent a bizarre gift by someone who’d been in Azkaban up until a week ago?”</p><p>I felt the blood drain out of my face. “Quite. And you say this was sent on the first of December?”</p><p>“Er...yeah. <em>Yes</em>. Hermione wondered if it was related to that song, the Twelve Days of Christmas, y’know, with the partridge in the pear tree and all the gifts.”</p><p>“Yes, I'm familiar.” I did <em>not</em> like where this was headed.</p><p>“Except minus the pear tree... but according to ‘Mione the lyrics are just a corruption of the French <em>une perdrix </em>and apparently partridges are ground-nesting fowl anyway—”</p><p>“Potter, can I ask—”  </p><p>“—and Ron said he reckoned it could be part of some old pureblood tradition.”</p><p>“Yes, he might just be weaselling up the right tree there. Sorry, can you remind me what it said? It’s seeking <em>your </em>kinship on <em>my </em>behalf and is signed off ‘Your confederate’?” </p><p>“Yes! Your <em>humble confederate</em>.” Potter declared in what he clearly thought was a posh accent. “And Ron told me that sounded important. It sounded like a load of twaddle to me, to be honest, and I was all for ignoring it and giving it a good old <em>Incendio</em>, but Ron said we’d likely need to respond in the proper way. The proper pureblood way. Only... Ron wasn’t sure what the proper pureblood way was. Just... just that it was important.”</p><p>Oh Merlin, this was <em>not good</em>. I couldn’t believe Father was out of prison a wet week and scheming and machinating already.</p><p>“It <em>is </em>very important, the last thing you need is to be locked into some sort of allegiance with my family.”</p><p>“<em>Allegiance</em>? What?”</p><p>“Yes, if you don’t tread carefully here, we could be shackled together in a sort of partnership arrangement for life. And I don’t imagine that idea will be palatable to you.”</p><p>“We? What, you mean you and I? What sort of partners?”</p><p>“Precisely what I need to figure out. Most probably something akin to what's written in the note.”</p><p>“But it just sounds like bullshit pureblood waffle to me.”</p><p>“That bullshit pureblood waffle, as you call it, is—if I’m right—an archaic custom imbued with magical intricacies and ritualistic expectations and—if I remember correctly—is bloody difficult to get out of. My father appears to want to bind our families in some way. Worst case scenario, if we don’t follow the rules, you and I could end up betrothed.”</p><p>“What!” Potter jumped up. “Betrothed? Like engaged? To be married? What the fuck? No way!” His green eyes blazed in alarm. After a moment he stopped waving his arms about and placed his hands on the table. “Shit. I mean no disrespect, Malfoy, I mean... I mean, I think we’ve got used to each other during Eighth year and Auror training, we’ve had the odd drunken heart-to-heart, right? I’d even say we’re <em>pals </em>now.” I blanched at that awful term, but he carried on earnestly. “But I’m afraid I really do not want to be allied to the Malfoys, never mind <em>betrothed </em>to you, and <em>especially </em>not simply because your dad insists on it. He’s— I know he's served his sentence but he’s a total dick. He’s been a dick to me, and to the Weasleys, and to loads of others. Partridges and hens and whatever else aren’t going to change that."</p><p>Potter was quite right. Although he’s my father, the man's been rather a dick to me as well—his own flesh and blood. And, despite the fact that the idea of being shackled forever to Potter was doing funny and wonderful things to my insides, I knew it would be a hollow union and most assuredly <em>not</em> a situation I could stomach for long. Salazar, I sighed inwardly, it appeared I cared about the man. <em>Quelle surprise</em>. But I was hardly going to say all that out loud.</p><p>"Yes, I agree. My father's... <em>proposal</em> is less than ideal. I suppose it’s too much to assume you sent back the appropriate gift, with a letter using the appropriate language to indicate your acceptance of his gift but declining his obeisant and humble confederacy, in the appropriate manner, and suggesting an alternative compensation for the life-debt... using the appropriate wording.”</p><p>Potter looked at me agape. I held his stare.</p><p>“Er. You said ‘appropriate’ a lot.”</p><p>I sighed. “What did you send him, Potter?”</p><p>“Well, see, Ron and I thought a nice thank you note and a posh pen might do the trick."</p><p>“A nice thank you note? And a sodding pen?”</p><p>“Not a sodding pen. It was a nice one, silver, with an engraving of turtle doves, like in the song. Ron said it’d fit, cause that’s the second day of Christmas. Turtle doves. Cost me fifteen bloody Galleons.” He raked his fingers through his hair. “From the look on your face, it was not the right thing.”</p><p>“No. Not... not quite. If it’s what I think it is, you’ve pretty much accepted you’ll go along with his terms. Still, if I’m right, we should have time to fix this.” I pinched the bridge of my nose to stem the headache that was threatening. “Has he responded?”</p><p>“Er, yes,” he said, standing and walking to the mahogany sideboard. He crouched down to retrieve something and his sporting trousers slid down a good inch. Incredibly, he appeared not to be wearing any underwear and, judging by the glimpse I got, his arse isn’t quite as tanned as his back is and it was all I could do not to spit my tea everywhere at the sight. I instead settled for choking on a large inhale, an inhale which was ninety percent hot earl grey. </p><p>Potter turned and stood, saying, “So, he sent me this—” and then stopped in alarm.</p>
<hr/><p>Malfoy’s reaction to Lucius’s second gift was about on par with what I expected, and I immediately cast a Back-slapping Charm to help; Hermione’d been reading up on pureblood etiquette and delighted in telling a bewildered Ron and I that there were all sorts of spells that were deemed courteous to use to help a fellow wizard, particularly if they were a guest in your house: <em>Tergo Ledo </em>for choking on dry biscuits, <em>Refrigo</em> for too-hot tea (or, if you were too late, for scalded tongues), and<em> Kleenexium</em> for those allergic to crups or flowers. They really are quite useful.</p><p>But back to the gift. I mean, who sends a twenty-year-old bloke a glass hen? Unbelievable. It was after I’d unwrapped that gift that Ron and I had pronounced the whole thing as bloody weird and fire-called Neville. He’d come through the Floo and we spent hours researching and got through two six-packs of Warlock’s Brew before giving it up for a bad job and realising Malfoy was the only option.   </p><p>“Thank you, Potter," he rasped. "Just some tea that went down the wrong way. <em>Finite Incantatum</em>.” The back slaps ceased. “Goodness, is that a Hen on Nest dish?” He paused to examine it, a secret smile stealing onto his face. “I love these. It’s antique and quite exquisitely made.” He turned and fixed cloudy grey eyes on me. “Show me the note.”</p><p>His eyes scanned over it and he tutted and hummed before sighing exaggeratedly. </p><p>“As I suspected. By sending you the first gift, the partridge,”—here, his lips quirked up annoyingly—“my father has invoked the ancient pureblood custom of ‘Twelve Days of Equivocal Reciprocity’.”</p><p>I couldn’t hold back a snort at that. “Ooh, that’s got a nice ring to it,” I said, and began to sing, “<em>On the first day of Equivocal Reciprocity, my true love gave to me..</em>.<em>a partridge in a black cage</em>.”</p><p>“Be serious, Potter,” he frowned, although the corners of his mouth curled up further. "It’s pretty archaic but still gets used from time to time. The wording used in the accompanying note determines the nature of the contract you may or may not be getting yourself into, in this case a family alliance or betrothal." Oddly, Malfoy's voice seemed to pitch a little higher on the word 'betrothal'. “Then <em>your</em> counter-gift determines what happens next. Basically, it’s a test, one which he expects you to fail. And so far, you are meeting his expectations quite beautifully. You’ve managed to do one thing right, however.”</p><p>“Oh? What’s that?” </p><p>He somehow managed to smirk using just one eyebrow. “You’ve come to me.” And I have no idea why my cheeks chose to heat up at that moment, but they did, and the one pale eyebrow that was mocking me rose even further. </p><p>Anyway, that was that, and Malfoy was all business from then on, fair fucks to him. He rolled up his robe sleeves and got down to strategising straight away. And I poured more tea.</p><p>He explained as he went, filling in the gaps in my, let’s be fair, highly sketchy knowledge of archaic pureblood customs. </p><p>"Apparently," he said, as he munched on a Borneo—Aldi's answer to Oreos—“if the gift is refused, or if any gift fails to be received by midnight, then the original request of the first gift is magically fulfilled and any treaty contained within becomes binding, in this case making us ‘kin’. For life." Malfoy visibly quivered. Ugh, yeah, it properly gave me the creeps too. </p><p>After I’d slurped some tea, and just about got my head around all that, I asked the question that had been bugging me the whole time.</p><p>“Can’t you just ask your dad to stop?”</p><p>Not long after Malfoy stopped laughing, Kreacher brought lunch through. </p>
<hr/><p>I am stupidly fond of Potter, as you know, but he hasn’t, as the young witches and wizards say, got a Scooby.</p><p>“The whole reason for having twelve days of gifting is the <em>negotiation.</em> Once entered into, one cannot simply just <em>stop, </em>no matter how much one’s beloved son might wish it. You need to either accept the terms or make a counteroffer. The magic won’t allow any other resolution.”</p><p>“Surely I could just say the stupid life debt is cancelled and be done with it?” he whined.</p><p>“Unfortunately not.” I put my soup spoon down and dabbed at my mouth with a napkin. “Although I appreciate that you’d offer.”</p><p>“Of course I’d offer. We’ve put all that rubbish behind us. It was three years ago, for fuck’s sake.” His voice became impassioned and he knit his brow. “We're friends now, right? We’re good.” </p><p>I’ll admit flushing a little at that. Whatever distaste I had at him referring to me as a pal seemed not to exist when he called me his friend. It was quite baffling. I cleared my throat. Twice. And realised I’d completely forgotten what I was going to say. </p><p>Potter was still ardently staring at me.</p><p>“Um, indeed. Friends now," was all I could manage, and I just bloody knew my ears were turning pink. </p><p>Thankfully I composed myself enough to answer his next question, which was why on earth my father would wish us to be married. </p><p>Potter had a point, my father has never been a supporter of The Boy Who Lived, as I learned to my chagrin soon after starting at Hogwarts. He seemed to anger at the very mention of his name, and I soon learned to keep my frustrations about Potter’s broomstick and scar to myself. Anyone who knows anything about Lucius Malfoy, however, knows that he will never ever stop trying to bring glory and power to the Malfoy name, and to extend his tentacles of influence wherever and whenever possible. And of course, what better way to do that than to ally himself with the Saviour, the goldenest of golden boys? And to trap him into it in the guise of repaying a debt? The man was a recidivous schemer and would never change. </p><p>Once finished my leek and potato soup it was time to decide on the next gift: Calling birds. I knew enough to know this was a bastardisation of ‘colley birds’, or blackbirds to give them their modern nomenclature. After making a couple of fire-call enquiries, I sent Potter off to Diagon Alley with strict instructions regarding what to buy. I then set about composing a note to go with it and spent a full three minutes deciding on the appropriate parchment and quill. </p><p>Truthfully, I was finding it hard to focus on anything but the way Potter had been hanging on my every word since I arrived, his face open as a puppydog and twice as fucking adorable. It was embarrassing how much I still craved his attention, and maddening that it was still as addictive as it had always been.</p><p>I’d been trying to tamp down my infatuation with all things Potter ever since Eighth Year. After a shaky start to the year, in which, mortifyingly, McGonagall had to get involved, I vowed to keep my head down and get my NEWTs, and then find a little niche in the Wizarding world for myself where the public wouldn’t need to deal with me any more than they needed to. I knew how the wizarding world saw me and my family, and I had no interest in fanning the embers of their distaste and rancor. Some backroom or back office job would do, where I could design and patent charms, or potions, or some such. </p><p>But that all changed when the Careers Witch informed me I’d make an excellent Auror… in front of none other than Finnigan, Weasley and, of course, Potter. Well, there was no way I could back down from <em>that </em>challenge. Especially considering the way they looked at me after that, the way they treated me; with a sort of bemused respect. As an equal. It felt peculiar. Foreign. And, to my shame, I was flattered, and I didn’t want it to stop. No matter how much my brain told me I should stay as far away from the Golden Boy as possible; particularly given the fact that I had an impossible urge on a daily basis to tarnish his shine good and proper. That’s a euphemism for ‘fuck him silly’, in case you hadn’t cottoned on. </p><p>Against all odds, their respect carried over to Auror Training and, unmercifully, so did my desire for Potter. A desire that I soon realised, to my consternation, had a much deeper source than physical attraction. Hidden beneath my yen to get my hands under his robes was a disturbingly solid bedrock of fondness, admiration, and sickeningly, what appeared to be none other than deep and devoted love. It was most tiresome. </p><p>And now my carefully regulated efforts to keep my professional and proper distance were under threat. From my own father.</p><p>Fuck.</p>
