    <p>          The first time that Harry can remember talking to the voice inside his head was when he had been five years old. He had accidently spilled some orange juice when he was cleaning the dishes and his uncle had gotten angry. He grabbed Harry’s arm hard enough to bruise and threw him in his cupboard.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>          “If you can’t be useful around people, then the least you can do is stay out my goddamn sight,” Vernon snarled as he locked the door on the outside.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>          “Please, Uncle Vernon, I didn’t mean to. I’ll be better,” Harry begged, though he knew better than to hit the door. Last time he had tried that, Uncle Vernon had gotten very angry and hit him across the face for ruining the space that they so graciously let him sleep in. It made Harry upset and confused and he just wanted to know why he was treated this way when his cousin wasn’t. Why did they hate him so much? It wasn’t fair, and he wanted to be loved. And cared for. He wanted someone to care about <em>him</em>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>          Harry brought his knees to his chest and cried, struggling to keep the noises from coming out. The result was wet sniffing and half choked back tears echoing inside the small cupboard he was in. The only light he had was from? the line underneath the door but it wasn’t enough, and Harry was scared.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>          <em>Why are you scared?</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>          Harry jumped and pressed himself closer to the wall, eyes blindly searching for someone in the darkness.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>          “W..where are you, sir?” the young boy whispered timidly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>          <em>I’m inside of you. </em></p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p><em>          </em>“Are you me?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>          <em>No, I don’t think so.</em></p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p><em>          </em>Harry paused, biting his lower lip thinking. Maybe…. maybe it was because he had wished really hard for a friend.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>          “Will you be my friend, sir?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>          <em>Why do you need friends? Can’t you go and make real friends?</em></p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p>          “No,” Harry said sadly, picking at one of the scabs that had been left over from Vernon’s last punishment, “my uncle and aunt say that I’m not allowed to go outside ever because I’m a Freak.” Harry felt a burst of pain come from his scar and he whimpered.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>          <em>Don’t say that word. You are not a freak, and they shouldn’t treat you like that.</em> The voice had a seething undertone to it and even if it scared Harry, there was also something in Harry that felt overwhelmed that someone would want to be on his side. Even if this person wasn’t really real, Harry still felt warmed by the fact that he had a friend. A friend all of his own.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>          “What’s your name, sir?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>          <em>I don’t know. I don’t remember anything.</em></p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p><em>          </em>“You don’t know your name?” Harry giggled.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>          <em>I don’t remember anything before a few moments ago, so pardon me if I don’t exactly have the best recollection.</em></p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p><em>          </em>“What does recollection mean?”  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>          <em>It means remembering things. </em></p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p><em>          </em>“But you don’t remember your name? Everyone has a name, sir.” Harry said,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>          <em>Until I can remember mine, call me… Marvolo.</em></p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p><em>          </em>“I’ve never heard of anyone called Marvolo.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>          <em>You’ve also never really met anyone though, have you?</em></p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p><em>          </em>Harry shook his head.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>          <em>Don’t worry. I’ll be here for you. I’ll make sure you aren’t lonely. </em>And then Harry could’ve sworn that he felt a caress on his cheek, and something in him lit up. The coldness of the cupboard melted away from his face when he felt the warmth this invisible hand offered. That his new friend offered.</p>
