          <div class="userstuff"><p>After a bloody <em>brilliant</em> first sorting, 11-year-old Sirius Orion Black’s first act as a Gryffindor was to fall face first into a warm, solid (and frankly, quite nice) chest of some poor boy who was kind enough to steady the two parties quickly enough that they didn’t go tumbling to the floor.</p>
<p>Sirius struggled to his feet, ears and cheeks a <em>fantastic</em> shade of Gryffindor red as he stole a quick look at the boy currently gripping his elbow.</p>
<p>Said boy was only an inch of two shorter than Sirius, wayward, tawny curls falling into the emerald green eyes of the <em>loveliest</em> boy Sirius Orion Black had ever seen in his 11 long years of existence.</p>
<p>Apparently the other boy had an equally low blushing point as Sirius, because the raven-haired boy could see the blood rushing up to his smooth, russet brown cheeks, all the way up through those bloody fucking <em>beautiful</em> curls.</p>
<p>“Er, I’m Remus.” Stuttered the poor boy, blushing easily under Sirius’ curious eye.</p>
<p>And bloody <em>hell</em>, even his voice was lovely- low and soft, if a bit crackly in places (which, in Sirius’ opinion, only made it lovelier).</p>
<p>“Oh! my- my apologies. Hello! I’m Sirius!” the boy laughed off his awkwardness and vigorously shook Remus’ hand, eyes crinkling up in the corners as he beamed down at the other boy.</p>
<p>“Bloody hell Black! What’d you do to the poor boy?” Sirius’ new acquaintance (friend?) James Potter laughed, coming up behind the unaware couple- shoving the raven-haired boy aside good-naturedly to get a good look at the new boy hiding behind Sirius.</p>
<p>“James, James Potter. Pleasure! You’re in Gryffindor too! Remus Lupin, no?”</p>
<p>As James continued chattering on with the new boy, Sirius attempted to scour Remus’ person for any information about this lovely, tawny-haired boy, still loosely clinging to his hand (which was doing something quite pleasant to Sirius’ stomach).</p>
<p>And if it wasn’t already clear to Sirius that James had essentially adopted this curious boy into their brand new band of misfits, Sirius was determined to do just that.</p>
<p>(“Only 11, and I’d already fallen in love!” Sirius would later murmur against the skin of his husband, the very same Remus Lupin, 19 years later. “Bloody hell, was I one of the lucky ones.”)</p></div>
