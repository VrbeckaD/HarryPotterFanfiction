    <p>James peeked cautiously over the covers tucked up over his cheek. The room was dark and quiet, save for his owl snoring peacefully in the corner. He slipped carefully off of the bed, snatching his glasses before speeding to the door as quietly as he could. He waited a minute to make sure it was safe, his ear pressed hard against the cold wooden surface, before opening it slowly. The hall was just as quiet as his room, but a faint light carried from the far end. With each step, he counted a second, his eyes stuck forward.</p><p>When he reached the top of the staircase, he could see the light came from a candle lit on a table in the foyer. Despite it, there was no one around. It struck him as strange; his mother always made sure to sweep the house at least twice to make sure they were all out before heading to bed (he was a tad to blame for the habit). But he didn't dwell on it too long, instead settling himself on the very top step, just as he did every night for the past two weeks. </p><p>He sat there for hours; eventually so long he even forgot why he was there for a while. But still, he stayed glued to the spot, even when his back began to ache and his eyelids grew so heavy he came close to laying right where he was and falling asleep. He could have if this night went anything like the past thirteen days, but before he could even rest his head against the railing the sound of the fireplace roared to life.</p><p>He jumped from his spot, and nearly halfway down the stairs, racing his way to the living room. The fire was still emerald when he got to it, another boy tumbled out of it. James caught him before he hit the carpet; he was cold as ice and shaking so violently James was afraid he was having a fit.</p><p>His arms wrapped immediately around the other boy. “It’s okay Sirius,” He whispered. “You’re okay now.”</p><p>Sirius nestled his face into the crook of James’ neck. He began to cry, stammering words James couldn’t understand. But James didn’t let go or speak, simply cradling him in his arms and rocking just slightly, in the same manner his mother always did when he was upset. After a minute Sirius stilled and his breathing evened.</p><p>“Sirius?” James whispered. Sirius made a simple noise in response. “Do you wanna go upstairs? You can sleep in my bed if you want.”</p><p>Sirius lifted his head slowly, his eyes were barely open. “I can sleep on the floor, you don’t have to give up your bed for me.” He spoke hardly above a whisper.</p><p>“We could just share it,” James shrugged.</p><p>“You wouldn’t mind?”</p><p>“Not if you don’t.” James stood up slowly, carefully slipping from under Sirius and grabbing his arm to help him up as well. Sirius was shaky on his feet; the whole way to the bedroom James had to keep an arm hooked under his to keep him from falling.</p><p>When they reached the room, James settled Sirius into bed first, fluffing the pillows beneath his head and tucking the covers neatly under his chin. As soon as Sirius was nice and cozy, James slipped in to lay just behind him. He draped a single arm across his shoulder, keeping a small bit of distance. Just enough space for Sirius to turn over, laying face to face with James.</p><p>“You’re sure you don’t mind me staying here?” Sirius whispered.</p><p>James couldn’t see his face in the dark, but he could hear the tears in his tone. “If I did, would I really be letting you sleep in my bed?”</p><p>Sirius didn’t respond for a minute, sniffing every now and again. James heard him sigh before he shuffled just a bit closer. “Won’t your parents mind?” </p><p>James shrugged. “Maybe, but we can worry about that tomorrow.”</p><p>Sirius began to shake again, his breath heaving. “I-I'm sorry,” </p><p>“For what?” James scooted just the smallest bit closer and wrapped his arm tighter around Sirius. </p><p>“I’ll get you in trouble, won’t I?”</p><p>He probably would be in trouble, James knew, but he didn’t care. Right now, Sirius was the most important thing. “So what if I do? Dad’ll probably take my broom, but it’s not like I can’t live without it.”</p><p>Sirius simply sniffed again in response. James could tell he was still crying, but it was softer now, and his body relaxed into the bed. After a while, his breath evened once more and James could tell he was asleep. His own exhaustion had worn off the moment he had caught Sirius; his mind was too busy racing with thoughts to settle down enough for him to sleep. He thought of everything from what he would tell his parents in the morning, to what had happened to shake Sirius so badly.</p><p> He tried focusing on Sirius’ breathing, it sounded more strained than it might have sounded peaceful. It made James worry more, the last thing he needed was for Sirius to stop breathing altogether. Wouldn’t that be a lovely thing to tell his parents? </p><p> He still couldn’t see Sirius, but didn’t take his eyes off his silhouette for a second. Not even when sunlight slowly made its way through the window. </p><p>After what could have only been a few hours, Sirius stirred, opening his eyes slowly. He slurred a few words unintelligibly together. </p><p>“What?” James asked.</p><p>Sirius shook his head. “What time?"</p><p>James sat up to look at the clock on the wall. The numbers were faint and blurry, but he had spent so much time staring at it during the summer holidays, he could -perhaps just barely- tell where the hands laid. “Six thirty-two,” he said, only doubting himself slightly. </p><p>Sirius sat up next to him, his head dropping onto James’ shoulder. “S’too early.”</p><p>“Go back to sleep then.” James flicked his arm. Sirius attempted to punch him, though it was weak, just barely grazing his arm. James flopped on top of Sirius, forcing him to fall back on the bed, and laid oddly across his chest. Sirius laced a hand in James’ messy hair, playing with the curls coiled around his fingers. It was enough to make James relax enough to begin to feel the effects of not having slept; he started to doze into a comfortable rest against Sirius.</p><p>“I should probably go now,” Sirius said, sitting up. James slid off him to lay on his back, looking up at him. He was slightly less blurry than the clock, though James could still hardly make out his features without his glasses.</p><p>“You don’t have to,”</p><p>“But I should,” Sirius swung his legs off the bed and stood, though his knees buckled near immediately. James wasn’t quick enough to catch him from falling this time, but jumped from the bed to land next to him on the floor as Sirius hit it.</p><p>“Are you okay?” James asked, snatching his glasses from the nightstand beside him. He almost regretted putting them on as soon as the dark black splotch taking up half of Sirius’ face came into focus. “<em>Merlin’s</em> <em>tits</em>, Sirius,” He grabbed Sirius’s chin to look at him fully. Along with the bruise, there was a cut spanning from the bottom of his left eye to his top lip. He wondered how he could have missed something like that before. “What happened?”</p><p>Sirius pulled away from James’ grip, hiding his face under a curtain of his hair. “It’s nothing. I was just screwing around.”</p><p>“That’s not screwing around,” James pulled his face back towards him again, tightening his grip on Sirius’ chin. “Did someone do this?” </p><p>Sirius didn’t answer, staring at him instead.</p><p>James' chest began to burn as a strong feeling of rage rose. The worst part wasn't knowing someone <em>had</em> laid their hands on Sirius, but the sinking feeling of realizing who it might have been. “Did <em> she </em> do this?” He could barely muster a whisper through his anger.</p><p>Sirius continued to stare, then nodded slowly. James let his head fall back down then. But before another word could be spoken, a sharp knock came at the door.</p><p>“James? Breakfast is ready, darling.” His father’s voice called from the other side.</p><p>“I’ll be down in a minute!” James called back, not looking away from Sirius. “You know, my mum could probably fix you up in just a minute. Why don’t you stay for breakfast?” He stood up and held a hand out for Sirius.</p><p>Sirius didn’t move. James nudged him lightly with his foot. “C’mon, you have to at least say hello to my folks. It’s only polite.”</p><p>Sirius looked at him with a sad-looking smile. James couldn’t help but grimace at his poor state but hid it behind his own smile.</p><p>“I am feeling a bit peckish,” He spoke quietly, taking James still outstretched hand. He was still weak, leaning against James just like the night before.</p><p>As they reached the door, Sirius stopped, pulling off just enough to look him in the face. “I-,” His voice shook. “I know I should have asked before showing up, I just didn’t know where else to go and-.”</p><p>James shook his head quickly. “You never have to ask before coming here. I told you, whenever you need a place to stay, my door is open.”</p><p>Sirius blushed lightly and looked away. “I bet your folks would disagree.”</p><p>“Nah. It might take a bit of getting used to on their end, but who could say no to someone as cute as you?” He squeezed Sirius’ unbruised cheek, pulling his face towards him as he made kissing motions towards him. Sirius tried to swat him away, but James took advantage of his useless legs and hooked an arm around his waist, pulling him even closer.</p><p>“Piss off, you wanker!” Sirius laughed, not making any progress in getting away from him.</p><p>“You know you <em> looove </em> me,” James sang, giving him a bit of slack.</p><p>“I tolerate you. A little.” Sirius raised his chin in a pretentious manner. Despite the implication, he relaxed back against James.</p><p>James wiped a fake tear from his eye. “That hurt. It really did.”</p><p>Sirius snorted and looked back down at his feet. “Really, though. Thank you.”</p><p>“Always,” James said on instinct. Sirius didn’t look back up, nodding slightly. “And I mean that Sirius, no matter what. Whatever you need, whenever, I’m <em>always</em> going to be there for you.” He knew Sirius might not believe him, but that was alright with James. He knew he meant it, and that was all that mattered.</p>
