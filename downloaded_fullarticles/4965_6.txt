<p>Coffeehouse Confessions</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“It’s sticky.” </p>
<p>Draco, sipping his coffee as he reads the newspaper, doesn’t even look up. “Of course it is. It’s all sugar.”</p>
<p>“Not <i>all</i> sugar,” says Harry. “It’s coffee and chocolate. The chocolate makes it high in antioxidants.” </p>
<p>“That’s dark chocolate.” </p>
<p>Harry peers into his cup. “Looks dark to me.” </p>
<p>Huffing, Draco folds down the top of his paper with an audible snap. “How you can drink that stuff is beyond me. It’s a wonder you’re not diabetic, given your sweet tooth.” </p>
<p>“What’s that saying? Oh yes, sweets for the sweet.” Harry smirks, lifting the cup and taking a sip. “Mmm. Perfect. Just like me.” </p>
<p>Draco snorts. “Oh yes, and modest, too,” he mutters, rolling his eyes. </p>
<p>“You’re just jealous that it didn’t occur to you to order a mocha instead of that…whatever that monstrosity is,” Harry says, gesturing at Draco’s cup. </p>
<p>“It’s an espresso, and it’s perfect.” Draco takes a delicate sip and sighs. “Coffee is at its best when strong and unadulterated with sweet syrups or dodgy flavours.” </p>
<p>“There’s nothing dodgy about chocolate!” </p>
<p>“There is when it’s contaminating coffee!” </p>
<p>“I can’t believe you two are arguing again,” says Hermione, slipping into the chair beside Harry’s. “Doesn’t it get tiring fighting all the time?” </p>
<p>“We don’t fight <i>all</i> the time,” counters Draco with a smirk. “Plus, making up is fun.” </p>
<p>“And that’s all we need to hear about that,” says Ron, handing Hermione a cup of tea before sitting. “Right, why are we here?”</p>
<p>“That’s a bit of an existential question, don’t you think, Weasley?” Draco smirks. “A bit deep for a Sunday morning in a random coffee shop.” </p>
<p>“He means why did we ask them to meet us here this morning,” Harry says. </p>
<p>“Oh, I know,” Draco replies airily. “It’s just fun winding him up.” </p>
<p>Hermione sighs, reaching for a sugar packet. “It’s too early for that, Draco. Can we please just get to the point?” </p>
<p>Harry and Draco smile at each other, and, after a moment of silent communication, Harry nods. “We’re going to have a baby,” he says. </p>
<p>Hermione drops her spoon with a clatter. “Oh my goodness!” she exclaims. “That’s wonderful!” She looks Harry over. “You don’t look pregnant. Oh! Is Draco carrying?” </p>
<p>Draco cocks his eyebrow at her. “Carrying? Are you mad? Men can’t get pregnant.” </p>
<p>“But…magic,” Hermione says weakly. </p>
<p>Draco snorts. “There is not enough magic in the world to convince me to carry an infant inside me.” He shudders. “Merlin. No, we’re adopting, of course.” </p>
<p>“Oh.” Hermione’s eyes narrow and she turns to Ron. “You told me wizards can get pregnant!” </p>
<p>Ron coughs. “Er, yeah, about that…” </p>
<p>Hermione crosses her arms. “What about it?” </p>
<p>“I sort of made that up.” Ron clears his throat. “But it wasn’t my fault! You’re always going on about how marriage is about equality, and I was afraid you wouldn’t agree to marry me unless I said magic could let men carry babies, so—”</p>
<p>Draco clears his throat. “Can we get back to our announcement?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” says Ron. “Definitely.”</p>
<p>“Ronald, Weasley, you are impossible, and we <i>will</i> be discussing this later!” Hermione snaps. Huffing, she turns toward Draco. “Congratulations. When do you get the baby?”</p>
<p>“This week,” Draco says. He hums. “Harry thought we should tell you, so you won’t be completely surprised when we ask you to babysit.”</p>
<p>Harry laughs. “And because we’d like you to be the baby’s godparents.” </p>
<p>“That, too,” Draco murmurs. </p>
<p>“Oh!” Hermione claps her hands, a smile breaking out across her face. “Of course! We’d be honoured, right, Ron?” </p>
<p>“Definitely.” Ron beams, clapping Harry on the back. “That’s brilliant, mate.” </p>
<p>“Yeah, we think so, too.” Harry exhales. “It’s a big step, but we think we’re ready.” </p>
<p>“I think you are, too,” Hermione says. “And I have several books on child rearing you’ll want to read—”</p>
<p>By the time she’s done lecturing, Hermione’s in a good mood again, and when Ron offers to get her more tea, she actually smiles at him as she refuses. </p>
<p>“I think we may have just saved Weasley’s bacon back there,” Draco murmurs as they exit the coffee shop thirty minutes later. </p>
<p>Harry grins. “You could be right. I’d say he owes us.” </p>
<p>“As would I.” Draco clasps Harry’s hand. “So, now that we’ve told your friends, we need to tell my friends and my parents.” </p>
<p>“Right now?” Harry asks. </p>
<p>Draco raises an eyebrow. “It doesn’t have to be this very second,” he says. “Why?” </p>
<p>“Are you sure wizards can’t get pregnant?” </p>
<p>“Fairly sure, yes,” Draco says slowly. “Why?” </p>
<p>“I thought we give it a shot.” Harry licks his lips. “You know, just in case it is possible and you just have to try <i>really</i> hard.” </p>
<p>Draco laughs. “And because we won’t be able to practise as much when we get the baby?” </p>
<p>“That, too.” </p>
<p>“I like the way you think.” </p>
