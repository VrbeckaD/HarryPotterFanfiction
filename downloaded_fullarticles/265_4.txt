          <div class="userstuff"><p>            Susan had been the first to settle in for the emergency staff meeting that morning.</p>
<p>            In fact, she was the one that had called the meeting.</p>
<p>            The professors of Hogwarts had to discuss the current virus sweeping through the Muggle world. There were no cases in the wizarding world, yet, but as the Matron of Hogwarts, Susan wanted the staff to be prepared.</p>
<p>            McGonagall had been very supportive when Susan brought up the idea and suggested they did it before breakfast in the Dining Hall the next morning. The doors opened at 7:30AM, which meant that their emergency staff meeting that morning would start at 6:30AM.</p>
<p>            Susan had never heard Charlie Weasley swear in front of the older professors before. And Pansy Parkinson threw a textbook at Susan once the news had been released. Viktor Krum grunted in Bulgarian. Harry Potter sighed in such a high pitch one that his students had lost control in a giggle fit. Hermione Granger was worked up because her daily morning review of her lesson plans would be thrown array. Even Dean Thomas refused to acknowledge Susan at dinner that night.</p>
<p>            The only professor that seemed unfazed by the change of events was Draco Malfoy.</p>
<p>            It was as if he didn’t even know that there was a meeting.</p>
<p>            When Draco swept past the Hospital Wing during his final rounds of the evening, Susan had caught him and cheerily reminded him. She was finalizing her presentation for the morning and even asked for his opinion on the font colour.</p>
<p>            Draco had strong thoughts on keeping it traditional with onyx.</p>
<p>            “See you in the morning, dear.” Susan bid Draco goodnight and he continued on his merrily way.</p>
<p>            Now, bright and early with the teachers finding their seats at the long table in the teacher’s lounge, Susan nervously waited for Draco to make his appearance.</p>
<p>            Flitwick, McGonagall, Binns, and Sinistra were all present when Hermione wandered in. A cup of tea floated behind her as papers that needed to be grades were in her hands. Hermione gave a welcoming smile and sat near the far end where she could keep busy by herself until the meeting started.</p>
<p>            Eventually Vector, Trelawney, and Sprout found their way inside as well, along with Dean, Viktor, and Harry.</p>
<p>            They were still waiting on Charlie, Pansy, and –</p>
<p>            Draco looked like he wasn’t totally awake as he walked into the room.</p>
<p>            Light blue plaid pjs bottoms were quite the fashion statement as he paired them with brown slippers and the button down shirt he had worn the day before which was now wrinkled. His hair resembled Harry’s, on a bad day. And if Susan’s suspicions were correct, chances were Draco hadn’t brushed his teeth either.</p>
<p>            Instead, he held a large mug of coffee that was only half full, and with his eyes still slitted with sleep, gave a wave to his peers.  </p>
<p>            The idiot sat next to Hermione.</p>
<p>            “’m late?”</p>
<p>            Susan watched the scene at the back of the teachers’ lounge unfold.</p>
<p>            “No, you…you’re…” Hermione was at a loss for words. The unprofessionalism was incomprehensible to her. “Malfoy, did you just wake up?”</p>
<p>            “Wouldn’t really consider my state to be ‘awake’ right now, Granger.” Draco’s hunch was prominent and made his body mass seem double in size compared to Hermione. “Barely would consider myself human right now neither.”</p>
<p>            The thought hit Hermione as she recoiled in disgust. “Are you hungover?”</p>
<p>            Susan was the only one listening in to their conversation. The rest of the teachers were busy chattering away to each other and completely ignoring the reckless pair of friends.</p>
<p>            Draco’s head swung low and lifted up by his shoulder to look at Hermione directly.</p>
<p>            He paused.</p>
<p>            Then, out of no where, pulled out an energy drink can.</p>
<p>            As he clicked it open, he smiled, and said “I wish.”</p>
<p>            “Are you looking to get reprimanded?” Hermione started to rattle, ignoring the appearance of the drink. “How foolish are you? It was a school night. Did you do it in your quarters? You know we’re not allowed to drink while on duty. Are you going through something and not telling us? We’re your friends and are here to help you but…”</p>
<p>            Hermione watched in horror as Draco gently poured the energy drink into his coffee mug. The can, added to the coffee that had already been in the mug, brought it to the brim.</p>
<p>            Susan could smell the atrocious concoction form the front of the room.  </p>
<p>            “But you can bet on Merlin that we won’t be helping you when you start seizing after drinking that mess.” Hermione slid to a halt in her words. “I wouldn’t drink that if I were you, Malfoy.”</p>
<p>            “Good thing you’re not me then, right, Granger?” Malfoy pretended to cheers the air with his mug and took a big gulp.</p>
<p>            Charlie and Pansy decided to arrive just then, prompting McGonagall to gather everyone’s attention. Didn’t she understand that Susan was eavesdropping a very important conversation at the moment?</p>
<p>            “Before Susan begins, I wanted to revisit some of our past risk management schemes.”</p>
<p>            Susan felt like she had just taken a swig of some Felix Felicis and sat across from Hermione and Draco, who were still whispering.</p>
<p>            “What is going on, Malfoy?” Hermione asked under her breath. “Why didn’t you sleep well last night?”</p>
<p>            Draco looked resistant to answering, and even glanced up to make eye contact with Susan to see if she was listening. And as far as Draco could tell, she wasn’t.</p>
<p>            “It was Amaryllis Bulstrode.”</p>
<p>            Hermione paused. Then her lips curved downwards subtly. “Again?”</p>
<p>            “She left a trail of blood in the common room from her bedroom to the girls’ lav, by accident.” Draco continued, doing his best to appear to be listening to McGongall. “Hardly could see it except one drop had been splashed on the  stone instead of the carpet.”</p>
<p>            “Wrists?” Hermione murmured.</p>
<p>            “Thighs this time.” Draco replied, sipping his mixture of a drink again. “I fixed her up and we talked.”</p>
<p>            “Why didn’t you tell Susan? Or Sinistra? She’s head of house.” Hermione was now clearly worried about Draco’s sanity since he missed out on quite a bit of sleep. “They would have helped.”</p>
<p>            “I handled it, Granger. Besides, Sue had her presentation this morning and Sinistra doesn’t do well at the sight of blood.” Draco nodded along to whatever McGonagall was going on about, which Susan realized she was now out of the loop for. “Sinista received a letter when she woke up this morning as an update and Bulstrode will be visiting the Hospital Wing after breakfast this morning.”</p>
<p>            Both Draco and Hermione remained silent for the rest of the McGonagall’s introduction, and as Susan stood up to start her presentation, she could overhear them one last time.</p>
<p>            “I’m covering your fourth period sixth year potions so that you can check in on her and get some rest.”</p>
<p>            “I’m fine, Granger, I don’t need your help.”</p>
<p>            “I said I’m doing it, Draco.”</p>
<p>            Oof, Susan thought, she had pulled out his first name.</p>
<p>            “Thank you, Hermione.”</p>
<p>            “Okay, my dears,” Susan jumped into the beginning of her research with a smile bigger than thought possible this early in the morning.</p>
