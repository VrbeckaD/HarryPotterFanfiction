    <p>At night, L sometimes sat up abruptly and swung his legs over the side of bed. Then he would stare rigidly forward for fifteen minutes before lying down again.</p><p>“Everything okay?” asked Harry, the first time it happened.</p><p>“Fine,” said L. Harry curled around L’s body in a u-shape. L put a cool hand on his head and stroked his hair. “Go back to sleep,” he said, so Harry did. </p><p>L noticed that Harry was bad at the basic administration needed to keep an adult life afloat. Harry came back to his solitary dorm one evening to find L sitting at his desk, surrounded by neatly stacked piles of paper.</p><p>“Sign here, and I’ll send it off tomorrow when I’m moonlighting,” said L. </p><p>“You could read these?” asked Harry, surprised, because the insurance policy L had filled out included personal information. The Mysteries charm generally blanked out things like that, just as it prevented Harry from actually knowing what L looked like. Harry could see bits of him at times, when he was looking straight at him. He knew he had seen L’s eyes before, although he couldn’t remember them. They stared at each other enough, and sometimes, as Harry’s gaze flickered across L’s face, he felt as if he was on the verge of understanding something. But he never did. L’s features vanished like a dream the moment Harry looked away. </p><p>“Only parts,” said L. “I’ve put stars next to the bits you need to fill out.”</p><p>“You have no idea how stressed I was about this.”</p><p>L smiled. Harry caught it in a glimpse, but a moment later it was gone, and Harry couldn’t recall it. </p><p>“Of course I know how stressed you were about this, K,” said L. “That’s why I did it for you.”</p><p>K was Harry’s assigned letter name. It was why he and L had become friends so quickly; their rooms were across from each other.</p><p>In class, Harry watched L cast spells, quicker and surer the rest of their cohort. There were only fourteen left of the original twenty-six, and their two-year training period was coming to an end. Then they would be full Unspeakables, and the Mysteries charm would be removed. Harry tried not to freak out when he remembered. He knew L was worried too. </p><p>It was hard to talk about it, when the spell caught their tongues up so often. </p><p>When they first started sleeping together, they quickly discovered the impossibility of a normal relationship under such circumstances. Harry was having a Bad Day, the kind of Bad Day that had pushed him to sign up to the Department of Mysteries at the age of twenty-five, seven years after the traditional enlisting age. They had to bend the rules to allow him entry, but Harry was used to that.</p><p>It bothered him, knowing that L was so much younger. Not that L <em>seemed</em> any younger, of course; and it wasn’t the age thing that got Harry, actually, so much as the not-understanding-about-the-war thing. </p><p>On that first Bad Day he had when he was with L—because once they started sleeping together, there had never really been any question that they were exclusive—Harry felt more than usually aware of the mark the war had left on him. </p><p>He was sullen and blank all day. L followed him back to his dorm like a shadow. </p><p>“Something’s wrong,” said L. </p><p>“It’s—” —<em>the war, I was sort of involved in it, I remember it in flashes, I tasted blood on my fork this morning, it was only metal, but sometimes metal tastes like blood, do you know what I mean?</em></p><p>L said nothing for a moment. He made Harry’s bed and laughed a little when he found Harry’s toothbrush under the pillow.</p><p>“I don’t know how that got there,” said Harry.</p><p>“You’re a mess,” said L.</p><p>Harry went to the window and leant his head against the glass.</p><p>“It’s—” —<em>frustrating, infuriating, all those Death Eaters that got off, they’re probably all back to normal again, while I’m still—I just want to be <u>normal</u>. I just want to be like everyone else. I don’t want to drag you down with this.</em></p><p>“You could try…” said L, hesitantly, “…saying what you feel.”</p><p>Harry turned around with an incredulous expression. L shrugged.</p><p>“The spell usually doesn’t stop feelings,” said L. “They don’t give too much away.”</p><p>Harry frowned at that. Of <em>course</em> feelings gave things away. Although maybe not about Harry’s identity, which was all the Mysteries charm concerned itself with.</p><p>“Okay,” said Harry. “I feel…” He stopped, picking at the tiny, hair-like rags of skin around his fingernails. </p><p>“Upset,” said L.</p><p>“Yes,” said Harry.</p><p>“About…” L looked down. “Is it about us? Me?”</p><p>“No,” said Harry, although that wasn’t quite right. “A bit.”</p><p>When L spoke, his voice was cold.</p><p>“Right,” he said. “Well, let’s not drag it out. I’ll ask Chief if we can switch duelling partners. I’m sure we can be civil to each other in class.”</p><p>“No, L, it’s, I’m, I’m embarrassed, that’s all.”</p><p>L laughed grimly.</p><p>“What about? You don’t even know who I am yet.”</p><p>Harry suddenly understood.</p><p>“L. You idiot. I’m not embarrassed of <em>you</em>. I’m embarrassed to be like this. All this fucking… <em>moping</em> I’m doing. It’s…” Harry struggled for a word. It was harder to think, because L had approached and slotted his nose next to Harry’s, had put his hands on Harry’s hips.  “It’s <em>disgraceful</em>,” said Harry.</p><p>“You’re being a bit hard on yourself, don’t you think?”</p><p>Harry shook his head, and then, because he could feel L’s breath in his ear, allowed himself a fragment of honesty.</p><p>“I don’t want you to know how fucked up I am,” he said. </p><p>L laughed.</p><p>“You dear thing,” he said. “You have no idea how much I relate to that.” </p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>“I <em>sincerely</em> doubt you’re more fucked up than I am,” said L. “Not that it’s a competition.”</p><p>“I’m a mess,” said Harry. “I can’t—”—<em>do anything, I was given a million opportunities and squandered them all, I think my life isn’t very useful to anyone anymore, I used to be so useful, do you know what it’s like to achieve everything and look down the barrel at an endless decline…</em></p><p>“I love you,” said L.</p><p>Something new opened up in Harry, as if L had ripped his way through him.</p><p>They kissed, and Harry smiled, but he didn’t say it back. </p><p><br/>They had been<em> whatever this was</em> for six months when L came into Harry’s bedroom in tears. As Harry looked at L’s fierce, red-rimmed eyes, he had a fleeting impression of their colour, but it was gone in an instant. </p><p>L held out a letter.</p><p>“Can you,” he said, and Harry tried to read it, but the charm made him dizzy, and the words blurred. He made out a few: <em>“regret to inform you”</em> and <em>“died this morning at 10 a.m”. </em></p><p>“Someone died,” said Harry. “That’s all I can see.”</p><p>L nodded, the tears falling fast and thick down his vague, twisted face.</p><p>“What if you—” L stopped, frustrated. Harry tried to hold him. L peeled away. He opened his mouth to say something, but was clearly prevented by the spell. “Fuck,” he said, finally. “Honestly, fuck this!”</p><p>“You’ll be able to tell me, soon,” said Harry. L covered his face with his hands, as if Harry’s words had brought a fresh wave of grief upon him. “You’re scared about the Reveal,” said Harry.</p><p>“Ha,” said L. “Unspeakables are never frightened.”</p><p>“I’m scared too,” said Harry.</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“Because—”—<em>I’m Harry Potter. I’ve only been able to be with you because you didn’t know who I am. Because all I can think about is the stupid fucking war and you were probably a preteen when it happened. </em></p><p>L laughed to himself and reread his letter. </p><p>“Are you okay?” asked Harry.</p><p>L shook his head.</p><p>“Who died?” asked Harry. L paused before answering.</p><p>“Someone important to me,” he said, and then looked surprised that the spell had let him say so much. </p><p>“I’m sorry,” said Harry. L frowned at the floor. </p><p>“I’m scared no one will ever love me again,” he said. </p><p>Harry took a tentative step forward. When L didn’t back away, Harry wrapped his arms around him and held him as tightly as he possibly could. </p><p>He knew what L wanted him to say, but Harry couldn’t say it. How could they know if they loved each other, when they didn’t know who they were? Harry <em>suspected</em> he loved L. He loved the way L moved in bed. He loved L’s quiet grace, and the way L took care of him as no one had ever thought to before. But he didn’t even know who L had just lost, and L didn’t know that Harry had spent his whole life fighting Voldemort and chasing after Death Eaters. </p><p>“Lots of people will love you,” said Harry. L stiffened in his arms and gave a choking sort of laugh.</p><p>“It’s like you know already,” he said.</p><p>“Know what? That you’ll be loved?” asked Harry. L shook his head against Harry’s chest. “Know what?” asked Harry again.</p><p>“Who I—” but the spell cut L off, and Harry gave it up. </p><p>They had sex, as they did every night, slow and hard and dreamy. It was impossibly strange, to know each section of a person’s body in brief, hand-sized moments. The instant Harry stopped touching L, he forgot everything from the texture of his skin to the colour of his hair. He remembered only the feelings L had evoked; vague sensations of exquisite languor, and a sort of horrible beauty that twisted in Harry’s chest without him knowing why. </p><p>“You don’t love me, then,” said L, afterwards.</p><p>“We don’t know each other,” said Harry. </p><p>“I know you,” said L.</p><p>Harry thought of the war, how it felt as if he was made up of it. How not a day went by that he didn’t think about it.</p><p>“You don’t know me,” he told L. </p><p>“I don’t know what happened to you,” said L, “but I know who you are now. And I love you.”</p><p>“You can’t know someone, if you don’t understand what made them,” said Harry. </p><p>L was silent, stroking his fingers listlessly up and down Harry’s arm.</p><p>“Maybe you don’t love me <em>because</em> you know me,” he said. </p><p>Harry pressed his lips to the top of L’s head. When he lay back, he was left with a faint impression that the experience had been pleasant. He wondered what L’s hair felt like. He wished he could remember.</p><p> </p><p>The Department of Mysteries worked like this: promising young witches and wizards were recruited straight out of Hogwarts and put into anonymous training. At the same time, they began their other careers: they moonlighted. Harry didn’t know anything about the careers of the other recruits. For himself, three days out of any given week, he slept at Grimmauld Place, saw his friends, and worked at the auror office. No one knew what he did the rest of the time. The idea was that Unspeakables occupied positions in a variety of fields, watching, reporting, investigating. </p><p>He tried to ask L about his moonlight career, once. L was always quiet and distracted when he returned from his days away from the department. </p><p>“Do you like it? Where you go?”</p><p>Harry figured that was all right— feelings. Feelings were usually fine to talk about. But when L opened his mouth to answer, the spell caught at his words, and he leant his head into the pillow.</p><p>“I guess I can’t say,” he said.</p><p>“I don’t like mine,” said Harry. “I wonder why I can say that, and you can’t?”</p><p>“I don’t know, K,” said L. He sounded weary. </p><p>“Are you all right?”</p><p>L only laughed, so Harry pulled him close, and they had sex, the way they did every night. Slow, and hard, and dreamy.</p><p>Harry didn’t like his job at the auror office, but he did like seeing Ron and Hermione, even if he sometimes wondered whether their friendship wasn’t in a bit of a state. </p><p>They were all in a bit of a state. </p><p>The week before the Reveal, Harry had a long boozy dinner at Ron and Hermione’s. Hermione drank sparkling water, her lips growing tighter and more disapproving with every glass of wine Ron put away. Harry kept up with him, drink for drink.</p><p>“And the thing is,” said Ron, at around 10 p.m., “the thing is, the fucking…. <em>Malfoys</em> didn’t even get any time!”</p><p>“Lucius died in Azkaban,” said Hermione. Ron made an impatient gesture.</p><p>“So fucking what? Narcissa Malfoy didn’t get so much as a slap on the wrist, and Malfoy only got what, three months?”</p><p>“Six,” said Hermione, “we’ve been over this. And Narcissa’s dead.”</p><p>“Six months!” Ron lurched for the wine bottle. “Fred’s dead—Bill’s face— Teddy an orphan— and the bastard gets<em> six months!”</em></p><p>Hermione looked at Harry. He sighed.</p><p>“He wasn’t, you know, <em>evil</em>, in the end,” said Harry. “Like, at the manor, right? He could have turned me in.”</p><p>“Six months! Fred is <em>dead</em> and the fucking Ferret is prancing around London, living it up!”</p><p>“Malfoy didn’t cause the war, Ron,” said Hermione. “He was just as caught up in it as the rest of us.”</p><p>Ron made a disdainful sound. </p><p>“Please. He loved it. He boasted about his connection to Voldemort in sixth year, remember? On the train? Harry?”</p><p>“Yeah,” said Harry, “he did.”</p><p>Hermione glared at him.</p><p>“You’re drunk. You both are.”</p><p>“It’s Friday, ‘Mione!” complained Ron. </p><p>“And I have work tomorrow,” said Hermione. “As you know.”</p><p>“I know,” said Ron, sorrowfully. He nuzzled her hair. “‘m sorry. I love you. I love you.”</p><p>“I love you too,” said Hermione, and Harry realised it was late, and he should get home. </p><p>Back in Grimmauld Place, he missed L with an ache in his chest. If L were there, Harry could have explained— something. He could have said…<em> I’m angry. I’m frustrated.</em> And L would have put his cool hands into Harry’s hair.<em> Thank you for telling me,</em> he would have said, and then they would have had sex, slow, and hard, and dreamy. </p><p>Harry hated being away from the Department of Mysteries. He hated moonlighting. </p><p>Back at the Department of Mysteries, he told L he had missed him. L smiled, lightning bright. </p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>“You have no idea,” said Harry. “You have no idea how much I need you.”</p><p>L’s smile tightened, and Harry knew what he was thinking. <em>Then why won’t you say you love me?</em> But Harry was sure of only one thing, and that was his own uncertainty. So he didn’t say it back, no matter how often L told him. Even though he knew, each time L said it, that Harry was breaking his heart with his silence.</p><p>The night before the Reveal, they lay awake in each other’s arms. </p><p>“I’m nervous,” said Harry.</p><p>“What are you scared of?”</p><p>“I like this,” said Harry.</p><p>“Me too,” said L, in a low, solemn voice. </p><p>“Are you nervous?” asked Harry.</p><p>“Yes,” said L.</p><p>“What are you scared of?”</p><p>“I already told you.” L turned away. “That no one will love me again.”</p><p>Harry stroked L’s shoulder blades with one finger and stopped himself from saying it. Of course he wanted to say “I love you”. He wanted to reassure L, to tell him to have faith. But Harry didn’t have faith himself. </p><p>“Goodnight,” said L, stiffly, the way he spoke when he was trying not to bother anyone. Harry kissed his shoulder.</p><p>“Goodnight, L,” said Harry.</p><p>“I love you,” said L. </p><p>Harry couldn’t answer. Eventually, he heard L’s breathing even out, and knew he had fallen asleep.  </p><p><br/>They wore their formal Unspeakable robes for the Reveal, and stood in alphabetical order. L was radiating discomfort. His shoulders were so straight they looked brittle. Harry reached out and hooked his pinky through L’s.</p><p>L cast him a swift, fleeting smile, and they squeezed each other’s fingers. </p><p>The Chief stood with his various, code-named attendants. He gave a speech about modern espionage, about the importance of information in a post-war age, about crafting peace through knowledge. Harry wasn’t really listening. He focused on the feel of L’s warm finger against his, and hoped with all his heart that L wouldn’t see him differently when he knew who Harry really was. </p><p>It was a vain hope. Harry knew that. </p><p>“Congratulations, recruits,” said the Chief. “You are now… Unspeakables.”</p><p>There was a warm whoosh of air, like walking into a posh shopping centre in winter. </p><p>The first thing Harry noticed was that Hermione stood next to the Chief: she was code name Badger. He suddenly could remember seeing her around, recognising her for a milli-second at a time, and then losing the memory.</p><p> She was smiling uncertainly at Harry. Her eyes flicked to his right, where L stood. </p><p>L had dropped Harry’s finger. Harry turned to face him, and saw the pale, stricken face of Draco Malfoy. </p>
