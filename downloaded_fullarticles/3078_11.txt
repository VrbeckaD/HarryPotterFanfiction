    <p>
  <em>I see you, Sirius Black.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Not just the handsome boy who can charm his way into any girl’s heart, but the sweet boy who never lets any of those girls come close to his own heart because he’s afraid of rejection.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Not just the prankster  who takes too many chances, but the boy who pranks the bullies who pick on firsties.<br/></em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Not just the smart aleck who tends to mouth off in class when he’s bored, but the smart boy who helps other people with homework when they get stuck.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Not just the party boy who throws the best quidditch celebrations (or memorials, as appropriate,) but also as the one who watches to make sure that younger kids don’t get into the booze or that anyone who has had a bit too much doesn’t get into trouble.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Not just the clown who tells jokes to cheer a mate when they’re having a bad day, but the boy underneath who never lets anyone see when he’s having a bad day himself.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Your smile lights up the room more than a thousand candles.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Your eyes shine brighter than the stars at night.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>When you laugh, I automatically smile. I could be having the worst day ever and still smile when I hear it.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Your loyalty to your friends warms my heart.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>I see you, Sirius Black, and I think you’re wonderful.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Happy Christmas.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Warmest of regards, always.</em>

<p> </p>
<p>“What have you got there, Padfoot?” James asked.</p>
<p>“Hmm?” Sirius said, quickly folding the parchment and sticking it in his pocket.</p>
<p>“What were you reading?” he asked again.</p>
<p>“Oh just,” Sirius muttered.</p>
<p>Peter piped in and said, “Another love letter, Pads? Toss the extras my way, will ya?”</p>
<p>Remus didn’t comment, but Sirius knew that he would be the one to see his distraction, and so put it out of his head for the moment.</p>
<p>But who had written it?</p>
<p>It must be someone from his House. Must be the same year to have seen him in class.</p>
<p>“Pads!” James said, snapping his fingers in front of Sirius’ face.</p>
<p>“Sorry, sorry. Bit distracted,” he said with a wide smile to convince James that he was back with him and paying attention.</p>
<p>“Anyway, Mum said in her letter that we can go to that concert if there are still tickets available.”</p>
<p>“Cool,” Sirius answered, his fingers drifting to his pocket to hold the note he had found under his pillow last night when he went to sleep. Definitely someone in his House, then.</p>
<p>“She also said that the orgy afterwards is fine as long as we’re home by curfew.”</p>
<p>“Groovy,” Sirius answered. It seemed like a girl’s handwriting. Had he seen it before?</p>
<p>“She said she was poisoning one of the Christmas crackers, so you’ll want to be careful of that,” James added with a smirk.</p>
<p>“Course,” Sirius answered. Had he ever seen anyone pay so much attention to him? Not to pat his own back, but he did have a lot of girls who noticed him. He just never noticed anyone truly seeing him before. Honestly, the only people who saw him this clearly should be one of his three best mates. Or Minnie. But that’s not who it was. Probably. She’d be more direct.</p>
<p>“Did the camel for Christmas dinner arrive yet?” Remus joined in.</p>
<p>“Not yet, and Mum is a little worried because apparently camel needs to marinate for several hours or the meat is too tough to chew. Right, Sirius? Nothing worse than tough camel, eh?” James responded.</p>
<p>“Bloody awful,” he agreed. Could it be Mary? Not Marlene. Definitely not Lily. Alice seemed to really love Frank. Y/N? No, you’d never looked at him twice and barely spoken to him in five and a half years of school together, no matter how many times he had tried. His crush on you seemed to be completely unrequited. It could be someone from another House, he supposed.</p>
<p>“Who’s the note from, Padfoot?” Remus asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t know, it’s not signed and it’s driving me mental!” he exclaimed without thinking.</p>
<p>All three boys started laughing and Sirius sorted through the half-heard conversation and realized the things they had been saying. “You lot are hilarious,” he said with a scowl.</p>
<p>“Let us see the note, mate,” James said.</p>
<p>“No!” he snapped, then took a deep breath. “No, it’s…personal. It’s meant for me.”</p>
<p>“All right, all right,” James grumbled. “I want to go see if Evans liked her gift. Anybody coming with me?”</p>
<p>“I will,” Peter squeaked.</p>
<p>Sirius and Remus sat in silence for a moment. Then Remus said, “I know it’s personal, but you seem almost shaken by what it says. Are you all right?”</p>
<p>“It’s actually a little disturbing,” he began, looking up at Remus and seeing you sitting across the room and meeting your eyes. Did you blush a bit before you looked down at your book?</p>
<p>“What is?” Remus asked. “Sirius?”</p>
<p>“Merlin,” he breathed. “Y/N.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Remus said slowly as if to a dull-witted child, “that is indeed Y/N.”</p>
<p>“She blushed.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Just then you flicked your eyes up from your book and saw that he was still looking at you. Merlin, he knew. How did he know? You nonchalantly stood and went up the steps in a composed manner, escaping to your dorm. When you entered the room you leaned against the door, book clutched in your shaking hands and pressed against your racing heart.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a declaration of love. It was just an expression of admiration. It would be silly to say you loved him when you had barely had a conversation in all the years you had known each other. You were simply unable to speak in his presence. Whenever he was near you, your shoes became inordinately interesting, so he probably thought you were a halfwit.</p>
<p>But Godric, the way he had looked at you just now! His eyes were smoldering with curiosity, and he was almost able to work a confession out of you from across the room. You had to leave before you blurted out your… admiration, right.</p>
<p>Alice looked up from her packing in surprise. “What’s happened?” she asked, assuming something was wrong from your out-of-character behavior.</p>
<p>“Nothing!” you squeaked. “Nothing’s happened. Why would something have happened?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, all right,” she said, clearly skeptical.</p>
<p>“You all packed?” you asked, trying to change the subject.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” she said, going along with it. “You sure you don’t want to come home with me? I hate to think of you all alone at Christmas.”</p>
<p>You looked at your dearest friend and smiled. All of your roommates were close after five and a half years together, but Alice was just the sweetest soul. “I’ll be fine. I don’t want to intrude on your family.”</p>
<p>“My family all love you, ya dunce. But suit yourself. I wish you’d change your mind though.”</p>
<p>“I’ll be fine. Looking forward to some sleep without Marlene’s snoring, truth to be told,” you said with a grin.</p>
<p>“Too bad Prince Charming isn’t staying behind, eh?” Alice asked in a teasing manner.</p>
<p>“Hush!”</p>
<p>“Merlin, Y/N, we’re all alone! Nobody else will hear of your undying love for Sirius Black.”</p>
<p>“I don’t love him! I…admire him. He’s a fine fellow.”</p>
<p>Alice snorted trying to hold in a laugh, then gave up and guffawed. “A fine fellow? Are you 16 or 116? Is he also a splendid chap?”</p>
<p>“Ugh,” you said, realizing you were still leaning against the door and walking over to drop dramatically onto your bed. “You enjoy taking the piss out of me, don’t you?”</p>
<p>“Well, yeah, that’s what best mates are for. Silly goose.”</p>
<p>“Right, I s’pose so,” you said with a chuckle.</p>
<p>“I need to go find Frank. I have a gift for him,” she said with a sly smile.</p>
<p>“Ick. I do not need details.”</p>
<p>“You’ll stop hearing about my love life when you find your spine and go get one of your own!” she said jauntily as she sailed out of the room to find her boyfriend.</p>
<hr/>
<p>“Alice!” Sirius called when your roommate came into the common room in search of Frank.</p>
<p>“Hullo, Sirius. Have you seen Frank about?”</p>
<p>“No, actually, but I was wondering if Y/N was coming back down tonight?”</p>
<p>Alice was slightly taken off guard, and wondered now if something had happened between the two of you to have Sirius asking after you. “Dunno, actually. Usually not once she comes up for the night. Gets wrapped up in a book or some such.”</p>
<p>“Ah, yeah all right. I reckon I can see her on the train tomorrow,” he answered, slightly disappointed.</p>
<p>“Well…no, actually, she’s staying back for holiday. Her parents are on the other side of the world.”</p>
<p>“What?” Sirius exclaimed.</p>
<p>Alice looked at Sirius as if he had taken leave of his senses. Perhaps he had. “She’s staying here,” she repeated.</p>
<p>“Right. Thanks,” Sirius said with a polite smile, trying to cover for his lost composure.</p>
<p>As soon as Alice left the common room, Sirius raced to his room to find the map and hunt down James. Seemed his holiday plans were changing.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Sirius tracked James down in the Great Hall attempting to talk to Lily. Pulling him aside, he said, “Look, I’m gonna stay back here for Christmas.”</p>
<p>“What?” James practically yelled. “Mum will go spare, Padfoot. Why would you want to stay back?”</p>
<p>Sirius looked around to see if people we’re staring, then jerked his head to get James to follow him out of the Great Hall. Taking the already worn parchment from his pocket, Sirius reluctantly handed it to James to read.</p>
<p>“Wow,” James said after he read it. “That’s something, mate. But what’s it got to do with you staying here?”</p>
<p>“Y/N is staying back,” he answered, a little embarrassed.</p>
<p>“You think she wrote this?” James asked, eyebrows shooting up in surprise.</p>
<p>“I kinda think…yeah, she blushed when I looked at her earlier. I think she might’ve.”</p>
<p>“And either way, you have a few weeks to try and charm the girl of your dreams,” James stated matter-of-factly. “Want me to stay back, too?”</p>
<p>“Nah, Mum really would go spare then. Go get spoiled and eat for both of us, yeah?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, will do.”</p>
<hr/>
<p>You had stayed in your room while everyone had thrown their last minute items into their bags and hugged you goodbye. You had exchanged gifts the night before so you had two new books, a pile of candy and a cozy new blanket to keep you for the holiday. Your parents had sent you presents but you were under strictest orders not to open them until Christmas.</p>
<p>You had taken a nap and then grabbed one of your new books and your blanket to head down and read by the fire in the common room. When you made your way down the stairs in your slippers, you were surprised to see the back of a very familiar head on the couch. You stopped dead in your tracks and turned to run back to your room.</p>
<p>What in Merlin’s saggy underdrawers was Sirius doing here? He had been spending holidays with James since before he ran away from home, why would he stay back now? What were you going to do, stay in your room for the entire holiday? You had books, candy, some random biscuits and access to the loo…you supposed you could survive.</p>
<p>Why had he stayed back?</p>
<hr/>
<p>Had Alice been mistaken, or had she deliberately lied? Was Y/N really still at Hogwarts? Sirius had been sitting in the common room since everyone else had gone down to the coaches, and he had seen neither hide nor hair of you.</p>
<p>He wished he had grabbed the map when he had gone up to use the loo. Perhaps he had missed you in the crush of people anxious to be away for the break? Maybe you had been roaming the school all day while he had been here trying very very hard not to turn and stare at the stairway, waiting to see you come down.</p>
<p>Worst case scenario you would have to come down to eat eventually…right?</p>
<hr/>
<p>You stayed in your room until after 1 am. Then you sneaked down the stairs intending to go on a food raid to the kitchens. When you got to the turn of the steps, you peeked around to see if anyone was about, but it appeared that the coast was clear. You came the rest of the way down and headed to the portrait hole.</p>
<p>“Hi,” said a voice softly.</p>
<p>You shrieked. You jumped. You pulled your wand and looked around for a murderer or death eater. Then you realized that the sleep-husky voice was that of Sirius, who had apparently been dozing on the sofa that faced away from the stairs.</p>
<p>“Sorry, sorry, I didn’t mean to scare you!” he said, hands up placatingly. “I’ve been waiting for you.”</p>
<p>You stared dumbly at Sirius for a moment, completely at a loss for words or actions. When you finally opened your mouth to speak, all that came out was, “Eep. Ah. Oh!” And then you ran for the stairs and safety.</p>
<p>“Y/N, wait, please!” he said, wanting to follow you but not wanting to terrify you any more than he had already. “I see you!”</p>
<p>You stopped dead, turning around to look at him, tears welling in your eyes.</p>
<p>“I see you, Y/N Y/L/N.</p>
<p>“I see how you are kind to everyone, every day, no matter what.</p>
<p>“I see how you wait to raise your hand when you know the answer so that someone else can get points for our House, so they can have that feeling of pride and accomplishment.”</p>
<p>Sirius took a step toward you and continued, “I see how you’ve known about Remus for almost as long as I have, yet you’ve always been kind to him. How you’ve taken notes for him and helped him catch up in potions.</p>
<p>“I see how you help younger students find their way around the library, setting your own studies back.”</p>
<p>He took a few more steps, slowly making  his way over to you. “I see how you’re kind to Hagrid, and how he shares his menagerie with you.</p>
<p>“I see how your eyes light up when you smile, and how dreamy your eyes get when you’re reading The Hobbit, which you must have read at least a dozen times by now.”</p>
<p>He was standing in front of you now. “I see how you’re definitely not a morning person, and how you take your tea with milk and sugar, not honey.</p>
<p>“I see that you have a temper.</p>
<p>“I see how beautiful your smile is.</p>
<p>“I see how kind you are to everyone.</p>
<p>“I see you, Y/N, and I think you are magnificent, and even if you didn’t write me the letter, I do not regret telling you this at all. Seeing you every day is a gift, and even if you actually hate me as I’ve suspected for years, I still want you to know that I think you’re marvelous.”</p>
<p>You were utterly speechless. This was actually a dream come true, and you could not come up with a single word. You could see Sirius’ determination faltering; the toll that waiting for a response was taking on him. And you found words, because more than anything, you would never want to hurt him.</p>
<p>“I adore you, Sirius, and have for years. How could I hate you? You are the very best part of my day.”</p>
<p>Sirius looked relieved, releasing the breath he didn’t even realize he had been holding. He held out his hand, hoping you would join him by the fire.</p>
<p>You took his hand, but pulled him to the portrait hole. “Come with me to the kitchen? I’ve been starving myself hiding from you all day,” you said with a laugh.</p>
<p>“Knew I could wait you out,” he said smugly. “Oldest siege trick in the book.”</p>
<p>“Oh, you were laying siege to my dorm, eh?”</p>
<p>“Nay, my Lady,” he said dramatically, dropping to one knee and dropping a kiss to the back of your hand in a very Sirius show of courtly love. “I was laying siege to thine heart.”</p>
<p>“Get up, you berk,” you laughed. “You’ve had m’heart for years.”</p>
<p>“Then never shall I let you go, my queen, for I have waited years to be able to say that thine heart is mine, as mine is thine.”</p>
<p>“If I kiss you, will you stop talking like that?” you asked with a laugh.</p>
<p>Sirius hopped to his feet. “That sounds like a very fair deal, my queen,” he said with his patented smirk before he leaned forward and touched his lips against yours.</p>
<p>It was merely a brush, but you felt sparks fly between you. A bit of a shiver ran through you and you felt like you were about to ride a broom made entirely of lightning.</p>
<p>“Snacks and stay up talking? Perhaps the odd cuddle?” you suggested.</p>
<p>“Perfect,” Sirius said with a wide, happy smile.</p>
<p>You left the common room and headed quietly down the hall before Sirius spun you into a small alcove to avoid Filch. You hid quietly for a moment, snugly held against Sirius’ chest, then when the danger was past, Sirius said with a naughty smirk, “Filch is gone, but we should probably stay here a while longer just in case.”</p>
<p>You stood on tiptoes to peck his lips. “We don’t have to hide from Filch to cuddle, Sirius.”</p>
<p>“I know you said your heart is mine, but does that mean you’re my girlfriend?” he asked, adorably uncertain.</p>
<p>“That depends,” you answered, giving him a squeeze.</p>
<p>“On what?” he asked with a smile.</p>
<p>“Does that mean I can kiss you any time I want?”</p>
<p>“Absolutely. In fact, it is extremely encouraged,” he said with his smug smirk back in place.</p>
<p>“In that case, I am absolutely your girlfriend.”</p>
<p>“I am absolutely your boyfriend. And absolutely crazy about you,” he answered, leaning down for a deeper kiss.</p>
<p>After a kiss that made you both a bit lightheaded, you smiled in pure joy and said, “I think this is going to be a wonderful Christmas.”</p>
<p>“I already got the best gift ever,” he said with a smile, pulling you close for another kiss.</p>
