    <p>Harry Potter was the oldest child of Lily and James Potter, he was a bright child and his parents were proud of their little boy. A year and a few months later Lily was pregnant again. After what seemed only a short time she gave birth to a little girl. Noone besides her husband witnessed the moment a new life breathed for the first time. The litle girl was born with small black curls on her head and with the brightest shade of green you could imagine in her eyes. Her eyes reminded her parents of the color of one of the unforgivables, but you can't go around and name a child after a killing curse, so they named her Ava, Ava Lyra Potter.  Ava was intelligent, even more than Harry, but she rarely showed it to her parents. Only her godfather knew it, he knew she would be a powerful witch one day. </p><p>As Harry was the heir of the Potter line he was to be the brightest wizard in line, but that was only what the Potter thought. Because her godfather wanted Ava to be a heir too, he talked with her parents more than once about the ways he could make it possible. On her first birthday Sirius Black finally blood-adopted her and so she became the heir of the Black line. </p><p>After one and a half years, in the middle of the war of light wizards against dark wizards, the Dark Lord came to visit the little family. It was a cold an dark night in October. He cam in the middle of the night and both parents had no time to react before they were stuned with a curse of the dark wizards wand. The Dark Lord went upstairs, straight into the nursery. The steps creaked beneath him and he could hear a child crying. When he walked through the doorframe, he saw the two children. The older boy hid behind his little sister and was crying. The girl just watched him with curiosity in her sparkling green eyes. Both children were born on the last day of July, only two years apart, that was all je knew. He knew a part of the prophecy and he knew he needed to kill both children, just to be sure. He inhaled deeply and threw the killing curse with a scream of "Avada Kedavra" at the girl. But instead of dying, the girl reflected the curse and in seconds the Dark Lord was gone. Only his wand and some of his clothes were left behind and a pile of ashes. The girl watched a small black cloud leave the house and with a loud crack the ceiling came crashing down.</p><p>When Lily and James woke up again,  both were terrified. They ran upstairs and found both children alive. While Harry was still crying and had a nasty gash on his cheek, his sister was silent and watched her parents with big green eyes. </p><p>This was the last day for Ava with her family. Many years will come and go before the wizarding world will see her again, despite all the effort from a certain Lord Black to find her.</p>
