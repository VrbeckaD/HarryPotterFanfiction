    <p>Disclaimer: I Do not own Harry potter or its characters. I just used my imagination for this plot.</p>
<p>Rated M for slightly sexual content and later lemon Chapters! You have been warned! :)</p>
<p>Summary: Story starts in the graveyard at the end of the tri-wizard tournament in Goblet of Fire and disregards books after GOF. Harry doesn't appreciate Dumbledore using him in a war and refusing to train him. He is also upset that Dumbledore made him compete. There will be Dumbledore bashing but no Ron or Hermione bashing. This will be Tom/Voldemort &amp; Harry Slash pairing. Slight Daphne Greengrass/Harry pairing on the side. Harry basically realizes he is a pawn and he takes action. This story will be very AU and might even have a good cunning respectable Draco representation, not the bigot…</p>
<p>Let me know what you think of the new chapter! Happy Reading!</p>

The Crimson Siren by Everyone Needs An Alpha</p>
<p>Chapter 1: The Awakening</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He could only hear the erratic thump of his heart pounding in his ears. His heart felt as though it would beat out of his chest strangling his breath in short wheezes. His thoughts flew past him in a frenzy…..the cup was a portkey….. Cedric is dead… his scar felt as though it would burst open… Voldemort was here….. there was no way to wiggle out of the statue that was holding him to the gravestone…. He could only watch in horror….</p>
<p>Wormtail dropped a bundle of some sort of disgusting creature that his nightmares wouldn't even be able to conjure, into the large blazing caldron. Blue flames hissed angrily from the surface. Wormtail scurried towards him with a large blade, Harry tried to press his body into the statue as if to disappear.</p>
<p>The blade was white hot as it split open his skin…"Blood of the Enemy Forcibly taken, you will resurrect your foe…." A few drops from the blade spewed angrily into the caldron…. "Flesh of the servant willingly sacrificed, you will revive your master" he screamed and sliced his hand in the cauldron…</p>
<p>Shock was his first emotion watching the scene … was he going to die tonight at the hand of his parents trader… he watched him levitate a large bone lying next to him and set it a blaze in the flames…"Bone of the father, unknowingly given, you will renew your son!"….Wormtail paused and looked him in the eye with a evil smirk and dark glinting eyes…</p>
<p>He reached inside his robes and produced a very old looking locket and dropped it in the cauldron…BLAST!…. The cauldron was smoking the heat from it made beads of sweat roll down Harry's face.</p>
<p>The smoke surrounded his legs, it was suffocating but at the same time it cracked and sparked and his scar no longer hurt…. It was almost as if it was magic caressing his body and mind wrapping him in a dripping power.</p>
<p>The ball of smoke where the cauldron once was swirling and starting to clear…. He could see a blurry shape….no…a...a person.</p>
<p>Harry froze astonished and his breathe ceased in the moment, he couldn't breathe not believing what he was seeing. Before him stood someone he had met before… in the diary, Tom Riddle … but different? … a few years older.</p>
<p>His eyes were still closed his shape still forming small details. He could see dark thick hair, and and strong chiseled elegant clenched jaw line. Porcelain skin not a sickly translucent or grey, but healthy unmarred complexion. Harry could tell he was skinny clocked in the black robes. All his features there he tilted his head towards Harry and opened his eyes.</p>
<p>Harry was pinned to his gaze….. his eyes were like a blazing fire… pure crimson red and locked onto Harry's own emerald one. Both silent and appraising one another. He shifted towards him and Harry could tell he was tall over 6 foot …. He was puzzled there was only a slight burning in his scar. He walked gracefully towards him with purpose.</p>
<p>"Harry Potter, there you stand on the grave of my father" he smirked his voice was strong and smooth "Thirteen years it's been" his smirk disappeared and appraised him as he was now close enough to touch him.</p>
<p> Harry was frozen not of fear but anticipation with a burning curiosity. This was very different from the Chamber, his magic was swirling around intoxicatingly choking him. He stared deep in his eyes….</p>
<p>Harry snapped his head back in unimaginable pain as he felt all his thoughts being shuffled in his mind whirling a mile a minute against his will, but he could not look away from his gaze. He felt like his head would split open what felt like a lifetime stopped in a moments time leaving harry wheezing. Shutting his eyes closely he slumped against the statue.</p>
<p>"Your Memories are most intriguing…" Harry trying to get his breathe under control looked at him in question "Dumbledore's little pawn ….. Abused at the hands of muggles" he said with a sneer.</p>
<p>"I will restore the world order but tell me, Savior of the Wizarding World…" he said arching his brow "Where are they now? Letting a child play warfare." He asked eyes blazing into his.</p>
<p>"Dumbledore's a great man! There will always be resistance to your terrorism!" Harry shouting finding his resolve and courage. Tom Laughed eyes just as intense, cocking his head to the side..</p>
<p>"Where are they now boy, you are just a pawn. Expecting a child to spearhead a war, he has molded you hasn't he …..hmm?" he murmured. Harry thought a moment and shook his head he was the only one that could stop him … right?...</p>
<p>"He let his front man be abused at the hand of muggles, you played in the tournament as a minor child….. how much could you really mean to them..?" he said his voice laced with a serious humor.. it was a ridiculous motion to believe he was capable to fight of the greatest Dark Lord the world had seen at 14…</p>
<p>Suddenly he was released from his restraints and fell to a heap on the floor. Quickly springing up as much as possible and wand in had .. he training his eyes on the other who was intently watching him.</p>
<p>"Why do you fight for those who would not fight for you or themselves?" He asked. "They do fight for me AND what's right!" the young Dark Lord Smiled a smile showing his perfectly white straight teeth. Harry was again suffocated by the feeling of magic surrounding him. In that moment he could understand just how he gained so many followers in the last war… it was enthralling to be around him.</p>
<p>"What's right".. he murmured walking quickly towards him expelling the wand from Harry's hand. suddenly the Dark Lord pinned him to the statue with one hand wrapped around his neck chocking him slightly. "Do tell me what 'Right' is, Potter?" He said through a clenched jaw.</p>
<p>Harry held his resolve not looking away he choked out "What's right is to not kill and torture everyone that doesn't agree with you, and mass murdering muggles because of blood purity!" the dark lords smile slipped from his face into a slight sneer. Harry wrapped his arms around the hand pinning him in place.</p>
<p>"There is no place for muggles" he said with animosity and disgust "You should know that more than anyone else, shouldn't you" Harry narrowed his eyes and clenched his jar glaring at the man.</p>
<p>"I wouldn't expect you to be able to think for yourself under Dumbledore's influence, it's a shame that someone so powerful from one of the oldest families is so… weak" he said with such distaste it made Harry feel Strange. He didn't want the Dark Lord to be disappointed in him… expelling the thought from his mind.</p>
<p>His thoughts were jumbled, the glare ceased as he mulled over the Dark Lords words. Was he under Dumbledore's influence?….staring into the Dark Lords eyes…. He started questioning his entire situation and decisions.</p>
<p>The dark lord moved closer pinning Harry to the stone with his body. He was so close that their noses were almost touching and harry could smell his sweet breath on his face. His body was pressed to hard against him he could feel every movement of the other body and could not move… but he didn't want to move…. Time stood still.</p>
<p>"It's a shame that you have this perception of me and you know nothing of what I believe. You have made others opinions your own instead of thinking for yourself. Think about it Potter you're a child from one of the oldest wizard families and the supposed Savior yet he left you with muggles who abused you, do you honestly think he doesn't know what they do to you?" he said in a deep whisper "They are the only family I had left"</p>
<p>Harry's mind was whirling as he was frozen listening to everything he was saying "Can you imagine all of the families that would have given the Boy Who Lived a magical home and not to muggles that beat you…hmmm?….or even why your Godfather Black never got a trial? Dumbledore was grooming you Potter to need him and his love and he fed you these lies that love could concur all right? The man is a great manipulator and used your ignorance of our world to his advantage in the political scheme of the world ,and he will use you when he needs you…." – </p>
<p>"YOUR WRONG, HE WOULDN'T DO THAT!" Harry was trying to shake his head but the hand still gripped him in place his breathing was erratic, Dumbledore wouldn't do that…..</p>
<p>A small chuckle brought him back into the Dark Lord's eyes as he murmured against his ear "wouldn't he?, he will rid you after you have no more use for him or you will die trying, you are disposable" his whisper caressed his ear giving his body chills.</p>
<p>Harry was suddenly released leaning heavily against the stone starring at him already 10 feet from him. "Come find me when you see that I am right, or let the power you have waste we could do great things together Harry Potter. I will destroy you if you become my foe and I will crush anyone near you, I have learned my lesson from our very first encounter and I will not underestimate out connection. I will give you anything you desire and we can have power and influence over the strongest magical Britain that will be the best in the world." He said with such determination and power that Harry could only believe that nothing would stop him from his goal.</p>
<p>In a way harry admired him for it, he emitted such power. Before he could think further he felt the familiar pull of the portkey, the last thing he saw before was swirling red eyes blazing at him. It was burned into his memory and etched into his mind.</p>
<p>He slammed into the hard ground his senses coming back him. The smell of crisp grass waking up his senses. He fisted his hand into it and heard as the cheering turned into screams of horror as Cedric's body stared unblinking towards to stars. He saw Dumbledore's serious face running towards him before he was enclosed in blackness…</p>
