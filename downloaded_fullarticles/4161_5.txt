    <p>“We’re going to be late meeting the boys, Lav.”</p>
<p>“Sorry, Lily, I just don’t k-k-know what to wear t-t-tonight,” the dirty-blond girl looked at herself in the full length mirror. She was shorter than average, a little on the scrawny side, her hair hung limp, and her eyes were a dull brown. Nothing she did seemed to improve on any of it. Not without the use of magical aid that would have to be repeated in order to keep the appearance up. She paled in comparison to her two friends Lily and Mary. It was a common joke by some people that she was the Peter of the girls group, “Not that it m-matters, I guess…”</p>
<p>“You look fine,” and she had no trouble believing that Lily meant it. Lily Evans was too nice for her own good, “We’ll go meet the boys, have a drink, go to the party, and tomorrow we graduate Hogwarts and start our new lives.”</p>
<p>That was a little exciting. Lavender wanted to think that a new life is what she needed. It wasn’t as if her life was really all that bad. She had friends, average marks, and a decent family. Things could have been much worse. She wished she could have experienced something in the way of a school romance the way Lily had with James and Mary with Remus. But she supposed part of that was her own fault. She never put herself out there. Mostly because she knew the guy she had feelings for wouldn’t return them.</p>
<p>No. He had eyes for Lily. Which wasn’t surprising. She was smart, talented, and beautiful.</p>
<p>She brushed out the skirt of her dress before sighing a little, “Okay. Let’s go,” she wished she could wear something like Lily. Jeans and a nice shirt. Her family might have been open minded, but her mother would never let her wear anything so muggle. If not her school uniform, then a conservative knee length, black dress instead. Sleeve length no shorter than elbow length. Black, opaque tights, and black shoes similar to their school ones. No makeup, not that she really had an idea of how to use it properly anyway. No jewelry, not because she wasn’t allowed to wear it, but she never saw a point in it. She was a horribly average girl and expected her life would follow as such.</p>
<p>They were nearly out of the common room when a second year girl came up to Lily crying. They were graduating tomorrow and so Lily was still Head Girl for tonight, “Go on ahead. I’ll catch up.”</p>
<p>Lavender nodded before going off on her own. It was a warm night. No clouds and the moon glowed softly. It was a perfect night for a end of the year party. She didn’t drink much and she didn’t mingle very much, but it was nice to be invited. She’d probably spend the evening sitting off to the side making awkward small talk with Peter. That’s how it usually went. One time, Lily had suggested that Peter might like her, but she found that highly unlikely. Even if he did, she’d never be able to go out with him. She didn’t like him that way and didn’t like the idea of putting someone through being in a one sided relationship. It was a bit hypocritical, because she knew if the man she did have feelings for decided to ask her out, she’d say yes in a heartbeat even knowing he had eyes for someone else.</p>
<p>“Ackerly.”</p>
<p>The sound of her own name made her jump a little. She grabbed for her wand and spun on her heels. Her hand relaxed a little as she saw Severus Snape. She had no reason to be scared of him. Well, a little nervous, but not scared. She’d never spoken an ill will against him, much less tormented him the way some others did. Lavender knew how it felt to be a little different and left out, she wouldn’t pick on someone else who was obviously in a similar situation.</p>
<p>“S-Snape,” she stammered a little as he got closer. He was dressed nice. Black slacks, a black button up shirt, and a black vest. He always looked like that these days. His curtain of black hair framed his face and his dark brown eyes were piercing, “C-can I help you?”</p>
<p>“Where’s Lily?” a question she was used to hearing. No one ever needed to know where she was, but they always knew she could be expected to know where Lily was.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure. S-s-she said she’d be along later. Something came up w-w-with a younger girl. She’ll be at the pub though. We w-were all going to meet up there,” not that Snape was part of this ‘all’. He wasn’t one of them. Nor was he invited to the party. Not that Lavender would keep the location from him should he ask for it. It was their last night at school, she could deal with the scrutiny of inviting Snape in the name of end of the school year festivities. Lily said it was time to start their new lives. Why couldn’t those lives involve making friends and amends to people like Snape? “I was going to a-a-apparate there. You can come with, if you’d like,” how would James and Sirius feel if she walked in with him? She only knew them through Lily and was sure they only tolerated her for Lily. </p>
<p>He didn’t answer her though. He didn’t even look at her as he started walking and moved past her quickly. She watched him walk past the school gates and apparate away. She’d planned on doing the same till he stopped her. It didn’t surprise her that he didn’t answer. He had no reason to. She wasn’t the person he wanted to speak with. It was normal for people to brush her off once they realized that she wouldn’t lead them directly to Lily or Mary.</p>
<p>The blond witch sighed softly. A new life. She just had to keep telling herself that things would change once they were all out in the world. </p>
<p>Lavender apparated as soon as she got off school property and headed into the warm, loud pub. She didn’t see Severus anywhere, but she saw the table of four boys and headed for it. They were talking about the party tonight and who they were taking. They were teasing Peter a little about his yellow and red striped shirt as she settled into a seat at the end of the table. Remus nodded slightly to acknowledge her. They all knew she was really only there because they were all waiting on Lily. She wasn’t really one of them. </p>
<p>“I like my shirt,” Peter defended himself.</p>
<p>“Maybe you could take, Lavvy,” Sirius teased a little and winked at the blond witch. Her cheeks warmed up a bright red.</p>
<p>“I...I...I’m not s-s-sure if I’m g-g-going,” her stammer always got worse when she was nervous. James reached over and pat her on the shoulder a bit and she wondered if her face was as red as a cherry yet. </p>
<p>“Be nice, Sirius. Lavvy here is going to save herself for a better lot of men than us four,” there were times when she wondered what it was Lily saw in James Potter. He was arrogant and rude, but then there were the small glimpses of kindness that he showed that made her realize what Lily saw. She supposed it helped that he was attractive, “Have you seen Lily?”</p>
<p>And again, it always went back to Lily Evans. Pretty Lily. Smart Lily. Talented Lily. Trustworthy Lily. </p>
<p>“S-she had to h-h-help a second year. S-she was c-crying. I think she got a b-b-bad test s-score.”</p>
<p>With that, the conversation moved on. Lily would be here soon with Mary and they would all head off and she would spend the night sitting in a corner somewhere till her friends were ready to go back to school. She hoped it wouldn’t be too late. She had a hard enough time getting going in the mornings without having been out till after midnight. </p>
<p>The conversation started turning dark with Remus going on about choosing sides and how they might have to face friends in fights. Lavender planned on not being involved in any fighting if she could help it. Her family was pure-blood, but they weren’t purist. They also weren’t fighters. They would keep their heads low and do their best to just get by. She didn’t want to fight anyone. Friend or enemy. She saw nothing wrong with wanting a quiet life. </p>
<p>Nervous that the conversation might start to get directed on her and she have to lie about anything to save a debate, she excused herself to the bathroom and prayed Lily showed up soon.</p>
<p>Lavender wasn’t gone long, but by the time she stepped back out into the main area of the pub, it seemed like a fight was about to start. Severus had shown up. She didn’t know what lead to the five boys all standing in front of the bar with their wands out, but it made her worried. </p>
<p>“Four against one. How very brave,” Snape sneered.</p>
<p>“I don’t need them to take you down, Snivellus. I can take care of you myself,” James snapped back, “You all better watch your backs, this is Severus Snape, talented Dark Magics wizard,” he said rather loudly, letting everyone in the bar hear him as if they weren’t already listening. It made her bite her bottom lip as she heard him starting to get more and more cruel in his words, “Lily will never forgive you. Not after what you called her. A mudblood. Is that what you came here for? To talk to her? She will never forgive you,” he made sure to repeat it.</p>
<p>“It’s none of your business why I’m here, Potter. Just stay out of my way,” the black haired boy growled, “If you want to fight, then fine. But not here. We finish this somewhere else.”</p>
<p>“I know just the place,” she watched as James put out one of his hands. Remus, Sirius, and Peter put their hands on James’ shoulder. They were going to apparate. She saw Snape move his wand into his other hand and start to reach out.</p>
<p>“James!” it was Lily. She was in the door of the pub. Lavender saw the redhead started to run across the bar to get to her. Maybe Lily could put a stop to this. There was no reason for them to fight tonight. </p>
<p>Her arm brushed Remus as the boy step forward a bit and she felt the breath slam out of her chest. She hadn’t meant to bump into them. Pain shot up her leg and spine as she collapsed to the ground. She could smell dirt and grass and now blood, “Lavender!” it was Remus’ voice. She could hear him and even feel him as he came up on her and started trying to get her to uncurl herself, “She’s splinched her leg,” she cracked her eyes open and saw Remus and Peter hovering over her. James, Sirius, and Severus were several feet away facing each other for a fight, “You two stop,” he snapped at James and Snape, “She needs help! Look what you two did!” Remus was always kind, even to people that James and Sirius weren’t. He had nothing against anyone, “Can you feel your leg, Lavender?”</p>
<p>“Y-y-yeah…” she got out weakly, “It hurts…”</p>
<p>“It’s just a cut,” though she had a feeling that it was worse than he was telling her. Attempting to keep her calm. Especially when he covered her lower half with his jacket. He didn’t want her to see the extent of what had happened. Lavender had splinched herself before, but only just a small cut or two. Nothing that felt like this.</p>
<p>“Just take care of her, Remus, we’ll get her to the infirmary in just a few minutes.”</p>
<p>“James! This isn’t something that can wait!” Lavender started shivering. It felt cold. Part of her wanted to tell Remus to just get her out of here. To leave his friends and get her help, but her mouth didn’t want to move. She doubted he would even if she could say it. He was a smart guy. He knew he could leave. He was choosing not to. Choosing to stay and make sure his friends stayed safe instead of getting the injured girl to help. Remus was never fully himself when it came to decision making when it came to his friends.</p>
<p>James didn’t respond to his friend this time. He was focused on Snape, “I’ll make you a deal, Snape, you beat me and I’ll leave Lily alone. If I win, then you leave Lily alone. For the rest of our lives.”</p>
<p>“She’s not a prize to be won!” Snape shot back before raising his wand.</p>
<p>Lavender didn’t see much more beyond some flashes of light before blacking out.</p>
