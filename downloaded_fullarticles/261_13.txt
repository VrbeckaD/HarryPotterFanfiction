          <div class="userstuff"><p>Minerva had her eyes closed and a cigarette in her mouth. She exhaled the smoke with a sigh. April fools was always the worst. She had been the target of pranks all day. She could not blame her students for wanting to have fun though.</p>
<p>     She heard footsteps approaching her and she prepared for another jinx or frog to be thrown at her. Instead she felt a warm hand rest on her shoulder. She opened her eyes to see Dumbledore looking at her with a sympathetic smile.</p>
<p>     "They're kids. Don't take it personally." Dumbledore speaks.</p>
<p>   "I know. It's just rather annoying." Minerva takes another puff of her cigarette.</p>
<p>     "We should get you a calming drought."</p>
<p>     "That's not a bad idea." Minerva trails off and starts to get lost in her thoughts.</p>
<p>     She absent mindedly goes to put her cigarette to her lips again, only to realize she was holding a rose instead. She looks at Dumbledore with surprise.</p>
<p>     "April Fools." The man says with a smile before retreating to the school.</p>
<p>     Minerva spins the flower in her hand and finds herself enjoying this particular prank.</p></div>
