    <p>Hermione sat on the front stoop of her now-empty childhood home, frowning down at the letter in her hand. It was creased crisply, almost militarily, and as she looked at it she realized she was absentmindedly running her fingers along the creases yet again, sharpening them, tightening them. She bit her lip, remembering.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>***</p>
</center>She was fifteen and kissing Viktor Krum in the rose gardens during the Yule Ball, but his hands were clumsy and he pressed slightly too hard, and used his tongue too aggressively, and he didn’t seem to enjoy it at all when she ran her nails along his scalp, but it didn’t matter anyway because his hair was much too short.<p>She was fifteen and watching in horror as Harry stumbled out of the maze, dragging Cedric’s body and as soon as she saw it she remembered a husky voice, almost broken, the scent of roses and cedar and the taste of mulled wine as he told her that there was something coming, dark times, and she knew that this was the Something. Later, talking to Harry and learning that the Dark Lord was back, she’d thought of silver eyes and silver hair in the moonlight. When Harry told her and Ron that Lucius Malfoy was among the named Death Eaters, she’d said nothing but thought of her hand on his left forearm and the gentle thank you kiss she’d pressed to soft lips. A few weeks later, she’d been running errands with her mother before she had to leave for Grimmauld Place and suddenly, for no discernible reason at all, had felt tears running down her cheeks as she examined the salad dressings.</p><p>She was sixteen and Harry had finally agreed to teach the other students defensive magic, after that <em>toad</em> of a woman had kept them writing essays. The first time she’d protested about the inefficacy of no practical component to learning as a pedagogical strategy, she’d thought of a skeptical face and flustered hissing and the feel of cashmere under her hands. Sitting in the Common Room late at night, planning the first meeting, she’d thought back to that same angry conversation, a murmured magical promise, heard that stupidly aristocratic voice challenging her at every turn - <em>so what’s to stop me from going straight to Umbridge after I get all this instruction, hm</em>? - and decided to think like a Slytherin. </p><p>She was sixteen but so much older than sixteen and she was standing in the Department of Mysteries with her wand drawn on a crowd of Death Eaters and she’d just lured a woman to what was likely her death, but he still smelled like cedar and smoke and she hated him just a little bit more for it, for making her wonder why he’d warned her, why he’d helped her, for making her hesitate and wonder just how much he wanted to be caught up in this nightmare.</p><p>She was almost seventeen, sitting in Grimmauld Place and staring at the picture of a once-familiar man with eyes that were now the dull grey of a scuffed Sickle, limp blonde hair, and face sunken in shadows and hollows, thinking of the crushing darkness of the Dementors she’d felt her third year, the cold leeching at her very soul, and was torn between regretting horribly and being unspeakably grateful that she hadn’t ever asked Sirius what it was like to be in Azkaban.</p><p>She was seventeen and hadn’t thought about that gaunt face in ages, when she leaned down to sniff at her perfectly pink batch of Amortentia, excited as she noted the smells - <em>freshly-mown grass, new parchment, and</em> - her mind stopping her brain just in time as she smelled the unmistakeable boyscent of Ron’s hair, and, beneath that, just the faintest whisper of cedar, roses and mulled wine.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>***</p>
</center>A few days later, she was sitting again, this time on the warm, dew-wet earth of an empty field a few kilometers past the last stop on the northern end of the Piccadilly line of the Tube. She’d spent the long walk wondering if she had gone utterly round the bend, but it was too late to change things if she had. She checked her watch, swearing under her breath, before she stood up, wiping the palms of her hands on her jeans. Only a few moments now, if everything went as she expected, and she fought the urge to fidget, fingers tapping out an erratic rhythm against her thigh--<p>and then she heard the sound of twigs snapping at the edge of the field, a curse and a muffled thump, and then a tall man in dark robes emerged from the brush, silvery-blonde hair slowly coming into focus in the rising early morning sun. She took in a deep breath, taking a few steps forward to meet him. “You came,” she said slowly, almost a question. </p><p>He returned her greeting with a subtle sneer. “And miss out on learning whatever favor Potter’s Mudblood bitch has come to beg of me, and what she’s offering in return? I wouldn’t dream of it.” </p><p>She didn’t even wince at the slur--it had been expected, of course--just gave him a tight smile, and, taking the final step to close the distance between them, murmured “Good”, just before she reached out and grasped his arm tightly, eyes screwing shut as she turned in on herself, mind utterly focused on her destination even as she heard his startled curse. The first jump was the easiest, but they’d barely landed on the rocky shore, she could only just smell the crisp salt of the ocean, before she was exhaling heavily, turning again, both hands on his arm now and nails digging in as much for her own concentration as to keep him from moving, then a whoosh of forested undergrowth, the sound of people in the far distance, and she barely took a moment to acknowledge her own fatigue and weakening concentration before they turned again, one last jump, and when they finally spun into existence she let out a heavy groan as she sank to the carpeted floor, eyes flickering across herself and Malfoy to check that she hadn’t splinched either of them.</p><p>She felt fine, and Malfoy looked fine too. If he had any injuries, they didn’t seem to be bothering him much, because the look on his face showed no pain, only sheer unbridled rage as looked down at her. She noticed, as if from a distance, that he still looked rather thin and drawn, hair not as lustrous as she remembered it, more like in the photos she’d seen from Azkaban - though he hadn’t been out long, she supposed, and then he was bearing down on her, fury etched in every line of his thin face. </p><p>“You will regret that,” he threatened, reaching out to grab her closest forearm roughly, hauling her half to her feet. <em>How convenient</em>, she thought dimly, tilting her head to see the time on the watch face just above where his long fingers were wrapped around her forearm, before she reached out with her other hand to grab a newspaper off of the coffee table next to where she’d been slumped on the living room floor of her parents’ empty home, and she almost felt bad at the flash of shock and fear she saw across his face when he, too, felt the unmistakeable hook and drag sensation in his navel of the Portkey activating.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>***</p>
</center>It felt like he was hurtling through a vast void for ages, long enough that he began to worry that there was a problem in the Portkey and that he would be stuck forever, barreling through time and space with his hand around the Granger girl’s arm for eternity, when he felt the thud of solid ground beneath his feet. He let go of the girl’s arm as if it were burning him, just managing to stumble a few steps away before he turned and vomited. Long-distance Portkey then. He tried to deny the icy tendrils of fear creeping through his veins, that he’d walked into a trap because he was foolish enough to believe in the honor of a bloody Gryffindor Mudblood he’d had the misfortune to be kind to once three years ago and now he would wind up dead, or worse, if the Dark Lord got word of his capture and got his hands on Lucius again, and his family would wind up dead, all because he’d misjudged Hermione bloody Granger in a fit of sentimentality, when he heard the sound of her retching as well. Well, at least they were both somewhat incapacitated.<p>He opened his eyes, palms pushing against his knees to help him straighten up as he took in his surroundings, hoping to gain some knowledge to even the scales between himself and the Gryffindor, who’d managed to thoroughly tilt the playing field in her favor (a feat he would only grudgingly admit to admiring). The walls and floor were some sort of stone, a smooth, solid slab of it all around, with pillars of the same stone supporting the cavernous space. There were no windows or natural light that he could see, only dim, flickering Muggle lighting dangling from the ceiling every few yards, and the air had the close, heavy feeling of being underground. The air itself was hot, too, much warmer than it had been in Britain, and he found the feeling of his heavy black robes suddenly oppressive, fighting the urge to gulp in air or rip them off of his body. As his eyes swept around, he saw that Granger had finally managed to stop dry heaving, and felt the tingle of a breath-freshening charm she must’ve cast on the two of them. She was leaning against the stone wall behind them. Her hands were still trembling slightly, and the tendrils of her outrageously bushy hair closest to her face were plastered to her forehead with sweat. She looked terrible, but better than to be expected for someone who’d just Apparated the two of them through three jumps and then taken a long-distance Portkey. Why did the dirty brat have to be so bloody good at magic, his brain supplied petulantly, as he watched her take in deep breaths. </p><p>“Where are we?” he finally asked, hoping that his voice was less shaky than it had sounded to him. </p><p>She exhaled slowly again before turning to face him, eyeing him warily. “America. On the western coast.” </p><p>The world suddenly began to spin and the floor tilted beneath him, and he felt for the wall, fighting another rising tide of nausea. He felt the icy grip of fear again but pushed it down and forced a sneer onto his face, hoping it hid the terror. “You know, if you wanted to bring me to a dungeon and torture me, there are plenty in Britain.” </p><p>He watched carefully as her eyes widened in surprise. “Torture? A... You think we’re in a dungeon?” </p><p>He couldn’t help but frown at her response. <em>That</em> was what she wanted to harp on? Whether or not they were in a dungeon? “Call it what you want, but we’re in a large, empty stone chamber that’s clearly underground. In my book, Granger, that’s a dungeon.” </p><p>He watched helplessly as she stared at him, dumbfounded, before she doubled over in peals of girlish laughter that he remembered well from the Yule Ball. Merlin, he was dead, so dead, and he wanted to kill the girl where she stood with his bare hands but he needed to figure out where they were and how to get back to Great Britain before his entire family was killed by the Dark Lord for his failure in getting captured or his apparent desertion. </p><p>“A... A dungeon! Oh, bloody Merlin, I’d forgotten how utterly <em>stupid</em> wizards can be,” she finally gasped out, amusement lacing her voice, and he turned to her with a glower, but she was shaking her head and straightening up. “We’re in a parking garage.” </p><p>“A what,” he asked flatly, lips pressed thinly together.</p><p>“You know, a structure where Muggles can park their cars. Surely you must know what cars are, the Ministry has a fleet of them even.” </p><p>He paused, looking at her. “There are no cars here.” </p><p>“Yes, because it’s closed. It’s nearly midnight here, give or take a bit for the long-distance Portkey. It’d be a bloody terrible place to use as a Portkey destination if it were full of Muggles dropping off or picking up their cars, wouldn’t it?” </p><p>He exhaled through clenched teeth at her suddenly pedantic tone, as if <em>of course</em> he should have realized she’d Portkeyed him to a closed parking garage in the middle of the night on another bloody continent. “Well, if not torture, <em>why</em>, pray tell, have you taken me halfway across the world?”</p><p>“Precaution,” she said, quickly elaborating at his furious glare, “I couldn’t be certain you wouldn’t try to turn and capture me, with others waiting as soon as you signaled I was actually alone,” --he frowned, realizing that would have been a bloody delightful plan, much preferable to winding up in a parking garage -- “which I why I needed to Apparate us immediately, and the three jumps should’ve been plenty to throw anyone trying to track us off our tracks, but then, even though I’m of age and so shouldn’t have the Trace on me any longer, I don’t trust the Ministry any further than I can throw them, hence the Portkey. Even if the Trace is still on my magic, it shouldn’t extend this far without someone looking for me here.”</p><p>He exhaled heavily, head thumping against the wall behind him as he took in her words. She was bloody calculating, he had to give her that. There was no chance they’d be found by anyone unless she wanted them found. “Where did you jump us, when you Apparated?” he asked, stalling for time as he tried to figure out how he’d grown so stupid rotting away in Azkaban. </p><p>“Well, I chose places I knew very well, to make the casting easier on myself,” she began, the clever show-off student as always, “so first was a place on the coast I used to go often with my parents, and not too far from where we were, and then the Bois de Boulogne in Paris, figuring that the international travel would shake off the most dogged pursuers, and then back to my parents’ home. It was the easiest to envision, and I knew I could leave the Portkey there without it being disturbed.” </p><p>He was no closer to figuring out how he’d gotten so idiotic as to get himself caught in a trap laid by a Mudblood, and instead was forced into rising estimation of said Mudblood for her stupidly impressive Apparition. “Well done,” he said, unable to force his flat affect into even his usual sardonic tones. “Well, ask me your favor and make me your offer, and get it over with so we can get back to Britain,” he said, waving a hand limply.</p><p>“Oh, er,” she stammered, flushing wildly, and he turned on her, nostrils flaring in annoyance as he took in sudden squirming, “you’ll understand, given the nature of the favor, once I ask of it, of course, but, ah, it would take some time, and it was too dangerous, even Confunded, for two people to book Portkeys out here too close together, so I’d planned on returning tomorrow, ah, tomorrow morning.”</p><p>“Tomorrow... surely you mean this morning, in a few hours?” Lucius asked, voice low as he fought to contain the urge to simply strangle the girl and be done with it. </p><p>“Erm, no. More like... eighteen hours?” </p><p>Lucius felt his temper flare. “Eighteen bloody hours?!” He clenched his hands into fists and fought the urge to punch the stone wall behind him. </p><p>“My letter said to make sure you had cover to be gone without suspicion for two days!” </p><p>“I know what your bloody letter said, you bitch, but that doesn’t mean I wanted to be stuck in America with a Mudblood for two days. Merlin’s balls, Mudblood, your arrogance astounds me! What were you going to do if I refused your favor, though maybe I’m giving you too much credit, assuming you thought of a plan at all, I don’t know if it’s worse that you didn’t think of it or that you were just going to leave me here, stuck halfway across the world with no wand and only a teenage girl to depend on -- <em>fuck!</em>”</p><p>“Of course not! There’s a backup Portkey, it won’t take us all the way back but-- wait... you don’t have a wand?”</p><p>He cursed himself for admitting that, but he’d been so bloody angry, and, well, if he was being honest, bloody terrified, to be stuck here with the Granger girl in Merlin knows where, wandless, helpless, as bad as a Muggle, even worse because at least a Muggle would know what a parking garage was and how to drive a car and how to get to London without a magic. He forced his face into a sneer. </p><p>“The Order’s intelligence must be worse than even we suspected, if your sources don’t know that I’ve fallen from the Dark Lord’s favor. He’s taken a fancy to my wand, you see,” he said, and realized belatedly that he must have been doing a worse job than he’d thought at hiding the bitterness and fear from his face and voice, if the pity in Granger’s wide brown eyes was anything to judge by. </p><p>The parking garage was silent for a few moments, and then she took a hesitant step closer to him. “The backup Portkey is in a few hours, and would take you to Dublin. From there I thought Apparition would be doable, or it’d be easy to find a Floo.”</p><p>He sat, stonily silent, mind racing as he tried to think through his contacts in Ireland. </p><p>“C’mon,” she murmured, reaching out to grasp tentatively at his hand and tug, “I still need to ask my favor, and we don’t need to sit in this parking garage for hours.” </p><p>He let himself be led out of the labyrinth that was the parking garage, and he’d have blamed the girl for making it impossibly complex so that he couldn’t escape or return without her, but apparently this maze-like structure was where Muggles left (and subsequently found) their cars every day, so he was robbed of the satisfaction. The heat increased as they ascended through several levels, until he was cursing his heavy black robes. He could finally see daylight at the other end of the structure when Granger stopped, suddenly seeming to notice the drops of sweat rolling down his neck. </p><p>“Oh, right. Other clothes, hold on,” she said, dropping his hand to reach into a small purse at her side (though her entire arm seemed to fit inside, he noticed), and pull out a pair of trousers and a loose linen button-up shirt, both in Muggle style. “I had to guess at the size, I’m sorry, but I know a few tailoring charms to fix them,” she said, holding out the clothes. </p><p>His eyes dropped closed as he fought the urge to roll them. “Turn,” he ordered, taking no small satisfaction in the fact that, for once, she just obeyed, turning around to face the concrete wall demurely. He stripped unselfconciously and then pulled on the strange Muggle clothes; they fit surprisingly well, even if he felt simultaneously constrained and exposed compared to the coverage of his customary robes. He cleared his throat and she turned slightly, peeking through the fingers that she’d brought up to cover her eyes, and he fought the urge to laugh at the unexpectedly childish behavior.  The thought vanished as quickly as it had come, though, because after she’d satisfied herself that he was dressed, she turned and gave him a nakedly appraising glance before her eyes quickly flitted back to the entrance, a faint blush staining her cheeks the most delightful shade of pink, and he fought to suppress the memory of her small teeth against his neck, the flash of sharp pain overpowered by pleasure. </p><p>He shook his head to clear his thoughts and strode off towards the entrance. He heard the the quick rustle of Granger’s feet against the pavement behind him and fought the urge to turn around, though he slowed as they approached the exit, which was somewhat blocked by a lowered barrier, which seemed too easy for them to slide under or to the side of. He shot her a questioning glance, noticing with a double take that she had taken off the flannel shirt she’d been wearing and wrapped it around her waist, leaving her in denim jeans and a thin scrap of fabric that clung tightly to her chest, which he supposed passed for a shirt in the Muggle world. She noticed his hesitation and plowed forward, sliding off to the side of the barrier. </p><p>“It’s not really meant to keep out people, they only care about the cars,” she said over her shoulder as he followed, first out of the parking garage onto a street lined with tall buildings, then down the block, around a corner, another corner, all along nearly identical looking streets lined with oppressively tall buildings in an unfamiliar myriad of architectural styles, loud with the sounds of passerby chattering and cars honking, even at this late hour, and Lucius was certain that he would be hopelessly lost, incapable of finding his way back to the bloody garage in this maze of a city. </p><p>“Where even are we?” he snapped at her, and she slowed her pace slightly to walk at his side, giving him a small smile. “This place looks miserable.”</p><p>“Just a bit further,” she said, cutting through an alley and leading him to the end of one last block, and as soon as they cleared the buildings he stopped in his tracks. Spilling out in front of him was a wide boulevard, filled with cars and flashing lights, lined with palm trees swaying in a salty breeze that was coming off of the expanse of dark ocean spilling out ahead of him, white-capped waves rushing to the shore illuminated in the light of a full moon and the electric lights of an array of Muggle structures at the end of a pier, reaching up to the sky and flashing brightly. Endlessly in either direction stretched the coastline, illuminated by thousands of sparkling electric lights. </p><p>He could hear the smug smile in her voice as she said, “We’re in Los Angeles,” but Merlin he would not let her ruin this for him. He blinked back the heat of unexpected tears. He’d spent a year in Azkaban, robbed of the memory of any good moment in his life, forced to relive his failures and fears endlessly, and when he’d finally been set free it had only been to emerge into one of those nightmares, his son’s life ruined, his home overrun, his wife desolate and cold, his world restricted to boundaries of his property. He’d never thought he’d see anything beautiful again -- not even the sun rising over London, much less the full moon reflecting off an endless expanse of ocean and palm trees swaying in a summer ocean breeze. To her credit, Granger let him stand in silence, breathing in the salt air, until he turned to her. </p><p>She was giving him a strange smile, and he noticed that the way the moonlight struck her eyes could make even the usually dull and uninteresting brown become sparkling chestnut, illuminating hints of mossy green and glittering amber he was certain didn’t exist before. </p><p>“Let’s go sit,” she said, leading him through the perilous journey of crossing the busy street, to a park that lined the other side, looking out over the ocean. She seemed to have intuited his draw to the ocean, because she led them to the far side of the park, where he could lean on a low wall before a drop to the beach on the other side. For her part, Granger clambered up to sit on it, her legs dangling over the edge, and he huffed. </p><p>“If you fall, break your leg, and get taken to a Muggle Healer, leaving me stranded here, I will find you and strangle you with my bare hands personally.” </p><p>She just laughed though, giving him an odd look. “I’ll be careful, I promise.” </p><p>With that, she leaned back against her palms, head tilted up to look at the massive moon. He waited for her to begin, but she just stayed like that, smile fading and face growing thoughtful, for long moment after long moment. Just when he began to shift impatiently, wondering if she would ever speak, he heard her inhale deeply next to him, and then begin speaking.</p><p>“It surely won’t surprise you that I’m not returning to Hogwarts this year.” She didn’t wait for his response to continue. “I doubt I’d be welcome, and even if I were, there are... other things to do. I’ve been getting ready, and” - just the faintest flicker of hesitation crept into her voice, and he turned to study her intently, though she kept her eyes trained upwards - “and I believe there is a statistically significant chance that I will not survive this war.” </p><p>He jerked slightly in shock, watching the young woman in front of him admit she believed she would die. He remembered the girl she’d been what felt like so short but so long a time ago, and what he’d predicted. </p><p>“Don’t worry, I’ve accepted it. I’m not afraid. It’s just a fact. But,” she said, pausing to draw in another breath, “there are certain things I’ve needed to take care of, things I’ve wanted to complete, in the event that I do die. My parents, for example. I needed to make sure they were safe and happy. When I owled you, I’d just returned from moving my parents somewhere far away, and completely wiping myself from their memories.” She swallowed heavily, and Lucius felt his world narrow to the sound of her voice and the smell of salt and sand and the movement of her throat; Merlin, she was... he tried to imagine cutting himself off from Draco and Narcissa in that way to protect them. Maybe he should have. But maybe the Mudblood was braver and stronger than he’d ever been, coward, because even imagining it felt like cutting off a limb. </p><p>“Which is just to say that the favor I wanted to ask you relates to the things I want to get accomplished in the event I die.” Finally, she turned to look at him, though her eyes were still somewhere far away. “I’ve never had sex, and I’d like to do so in case I die.” </p><p>He sat still for a long moment, waiting for her to continue off of this tangent, before his brain caught up and he started. “Me? You want... Why in Merlin’s bloody name me?”</p><p>She gave him a tight smile that didn’t reach her eyes. “I thought you’d ask that. You were my first kiss, you remember, and... you made it a pleasant experience. I didn’t want it to be with someone else who doesn’t know what they’re doing, because I wanted it to be actually enjoyable, which my research indicates it wouldn’t likely be if I was with someone else in my... position. And, besides all that... I thought you’d understand.” Her eyes seem to actually focus on his now, and he had to look away from the intensity of her stare. “Even if I did want to pick someone my age, or someone in the Order, that would be admitting that I didn’t think I’d make it, and Merlin knows after Dumbledore’s death we need as much optimism as we can get. Harry understands, he also doesn’t think he’ll make it out, but he needs me to be supportive, focused, not dwelling on mortality. Ron... it would break him to admit that we might not make it, I think. It couldn’t be him. But you... I kept thinking back on what you said that night in the rose garden, and, I don’t know, I just thought... maybe you’d understand.” </p><p>His heart was a dull roar in his chest, awakening as if from a long slumber at this girl baring her soul before him, and he dropped his head to hide his eyes. “I would have let them kill you in the Department of Mysteries. I told them as much, and you heard me.” </p><p>He heard a shifting rustle beside him that he assumed was a shrug. “I’d just lured a professor to what I assumed was her death, so it seems a bit inappropriate to be pointing fingers.” </p><p>He looked up at her in confusion, and her small smile was real this time. “Oh, did that not make it to Azkaban then? Umbridge caught us and was trying to stop us from going to Department of Mysteries, so I told her that Dumbledore was having us build a weapon that was hidden in the Forbidden Forest and we’d take her to it. I figured we had a fifty-fifty shot of running into Acromantulas or the centaur herd, either of which would work. It was centaurs - she insulted them, and, well.” She shrugged slightly. “She didn’t die, but I think she’s still in St. Mungo’s. She has a total breakdown if you even just...” She made a faint clip-clopping sound with her tongue, and Lucius blinked in confusion. Granger had really...? Ruthless. But that still didn’t...</p><p>“I have done worse things than you can imagine, Granger. I am dangerous. I am not one of your schoolboy friends. And you think it’s wise to write me, haul me halfway across the world, so that I can... what? <em>Make love</em> to you for the first time?” he said with a half-hearted sneer.</p><p>She met his eyes with that intense gaze again. “I know that you’re not a schoolboy, or one of my friends. I don’t want them -- I want you.” And, Merlin help him if, even in the midst of everything, that didn’t shoot straight to his cock with dizzying intensity. He exhaled heavily, grip on the wall in front of him tightening as she continued, with a hint of smugness in her voice. “And I know you’ll think that this is just a nakedly transparent attempt at flattery, but it wouldn’t be a lie to say that I’ve thought about that kiss anytime I’ve done anything remotely sexual in the past three years.” </p><p>As if sensing his weakening nerve, she played her final card. “Besides, like I said in my letter, I know that I owe you a favor already, and will owe you another. So I have something to offer.” She reached into her pocket and pulled out a nondescript carved wooden chess piece. A bishop. He frowned at it, but she smiled. “It’s a Portkey that will take you to an Order safehouse. It works anytime after tomorrow midnight, and activates if you say the name of the person whose statute you found me kissing at the Yule Ball.”</p><p>Lucius felt certain his heart had stopped, and his eyes were noticeably, transparently wide, even in the darkness. An Order of the Phoenix safehouse? His reward from the Dark Lord would be significant; he could possibly earn back his favor, maybe even enough to have his wand returned to him. On the other hand, if he didn’t give it to the Dark Lord, an escape route for Draco and Narcissa should things turn ugly, should the Dark Lord’s wrath escalate. She knew the value of what she was giving. </p><p>“And what if I don’t remember the name?” he said flatly, lips tight, trying to school his features back into an expression that gave nothing away. <em>Vindictus Veridian</em>, his mind supplied, the image of her kissing that stupid statute seared in his memory.</p><p>She looked at him knowingly. “Then I’ll have misjudged you. And you won’t be able to activate the Portkey.” </p><p>He gave her a furious glare. “Why on earth would you give this to me? You must know that I could turn around and take it to the Dark Lord and hurt your precious Order. You can’t possibly trust me not to. It’s a risky move. Surely intolerably risky.”</p><p>She gave him a small shrug. “Well, I may research and study like a Ravenclaw, or plan like a Slytherin, but I am, after all, an impulsive Gryffindor. I can’t resist taking a risk on people.”</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>***</p>
</center>She knew he’d take her offer.<p>She knew what she was giving him was too valuable for him to say no, regardless of what she was asking. She’d thought for a while about what she could possibly offer him, both because she was afraid he’d say no and because she did understand and appreciate the risk that he was taking, especially now that she knew that he was out of Voldemort’s favor. Disappearing for two days, wandless... the chances that he’d need her Portkey as an escape, not even as a bargaining chip, weren’t insignificant. </p><p>After Dumbledore had died, after Harry had told them about the Horcruxes, what it all meant, she’d immediately known what was coming, what they would have to do, and how dangerous it would be. She’d known then that her chances weren’t exactly great. So she’d done what she did best - she’d planned. She’d made a list of everything she’d need to take care of, in the event that she didn’t return, from her parents, to a long conversation with Ginny to make sure the younger girl would care for Crookshanks, all the way down to cancelling her Muggle library card. But there’d been one item she’d been stumped at, though she knew it was necessary. It felt somewhat silly, since she was adult in all other ways, and in more ways than most actual adults were, but... call it selfish, call it silly, call it stupid. If there was a time to be any of those things, it was right before she was about to march off to her likely death fighting an evil wizard. Once she’d decided it, she had to decide <em>who</em>. Ron and Harry weren’t right, for all of the reasons she’d told Malfoy and a few more besides. She wanted this to be as separate from the rest of her life as she could get it; she didn’t want whoever it was coming to her should she survive, expecting more, or for the dynamic between her, Ron and Harry to be thrown off-kilter even before they had to start their task. And she wanted someone older. She’d have considered one of Ron’s older brothers, maybe Charlie or one of the twins, but there was the problem that they were <em>Ron’s brothers</em>, and that if Ron had ever found it he would have been devastated. If he’d still been alive, she’d have asked Sirius in a heartbeat, but that ship had sailed. She’d considered owling Viktor Krum, but her memories of their lackluster kisses at the Yule Ball had stopped her - and that train of thought had led her to the man currently standing in front of her. </p><p>A man who, after long, careful consideration, finally closed his eyes and snatched the bishop out of her hand. “Fine.” </p><p>She smiled to herself, watching him roll the piece between his fingers and slip it carefully into the pocket of his trousers. “Good, then. We can go ahead and get going, I know it’s late and I’m sure you’re also tired--” she said, swinging her legs back over the wall and starting to hop down, when she felt his hand on her arm. </p><p>“Wait,” he said, and the look he was giving her was measured, but with a hint of something dark in his grey eyes that made her breath catch in her throat. “If I’m doing this, I should get a hint of what I’m in for. Maybe I should get to see how good of a student you are... how well you remember your lessons.” He was leaning over her now, closer but still waiting, eyes flickering between her eyes and her lips as he waited for her. </p><p>She swallowed heavily, his innuendo and the memories of their last kiss igniting a heat that was uncoiling itself slowly within her, and she knew her voice was a little too breathy to go unnoticed when she said “I suppose that sounds reasonable”, but she didn’t think she really minded, because she reached up and smoothed a hand across his cheek, rough with stubble, feeling his heavy exhale at her gentle touch, and then she brought her lips to his, straining upward to melt into the taste of his lips against hers, at once familiar and foreign. She felt one of his hands creeping around to the back of her neck to pull her closer to him, and let her own hands drift into his hair, gasping softly as she felt his other hand at her waist, heat seeming to radiate from wherever he touched her. She drew back slightly, pressing featherlight kisses against his bottom lip even as her nails traced delicate patterns on his scalp, feeling him smile briefly against her mouth at her remembrance before she heard him <em>growl</em> slightly as he hauled her closer to him, biting at her lip to get her to open her mouth, and then they were a tangle of desperate tongue and teeth and nails, his hand tightening on her ribcage and drifting slightly upward until the tips of his fingers were just barely brushing the underside of her breast, and <em>God</em>, had she needed this, the ability to stop thinking for thirty seconds, to not have to worry about what he thought of her or what she’d have to do or say after this was all over, to just live inside of her body in the moment, she’d needed some outlet for the constant tension that had crept to live inside of her, and every just slightly too hard nip of her teeth or not quite gentle tug on his hair seemed to do nothing but heighten his pleasure. </p><p>Suddenly she heard a catcall from a passerby and, remembering that they were in public, jolted back so suddenly she almost fell back over the wall, except for the long strong arm that locked around her waist, catching her. “You promised you’d be careful,” he said with a self-satisfied smirk, the effect only marred slightly by lips swollen from her rough treatment of them. “But I’ll let you off with a warning, since you clearly remembered your lessons.” </p><p>Legs weak, she stood up and started for the road on the other side of the park. “We... we should... I have a house for us. I figured a hotel wasn’t--well, that we’d need more privacy than a hotel would afford.” She flushed at his feral grin, stammering. “Not for that! I meant because of the <em>magic</em>,” she hissed. </p><p>“Are we going to an Apparition point, then?” he said, easily falling into step with her. </p><p>“Erm, no, I’ve never been there before, just booked it through the travel agent, so we’ll need to take a cab,” she said absentmindedly, reaching out a hand as she squinted into the bright lights of the traffic bustling by.</p><p>“A cab?” </p><p>“Ah, yes, they’re like the Knight Bus, but for Muggles. And there are loads of them. Usually they only take one group at a time.” </p><p>“Why isn’t one here yet then?” he said, and she noticed him eyeing her waving arm.</p><p>“Because they’re not summoned by magic. Someone on duty who doesn’t already have passengers has to see us.” </p><p>“Oh,” he said, seeming quite put out by this experience with Muggle transportation, and she shot him a look over her shoulder.</p><p>“But at least we don’t have to share the ride with other people,” she said, giving him a significant look, and his smirk was back. </p><p>A cab pulled over and the two clambered in, Hermione showing Malfoy how to buckle his seatbelt surreptitiously and leaning forward to give the driver the address and take down the number of the cab company, and then they were on their way through the city, windows rolled down so that Hermione could lean slightly out of the window and watch the variety of the city streaming by. </p><p>What felt like moments later, she felt someone shaking her slightly and jolted upright, hand going immediately to her purse with her wand in it. </p><p>“Granger, we’re here.” The voice was familiar and she shook her head slightly, coming out of sleep to remember herself, where she was, <em>who</em> she was with.</p><p>“Er, right... right,” she said, leaning forward to press the American bills into the driver’s hand before she climbed out, walking up a stone walkway and scrabbling for the keys underneath the flowerpot. </p><p>“This seems... quaint,” Malfoy said beside her, hardly managing to hide the disdain from his tone as he took in the tidy, long and low one-story front facade of the home. Hermione rolled her eyes. </p><p>“Yes, I’m sure the <em>Manor</em> is much superior. But give it a chance,” she said, opening the door, “Or at least wait a few hours to complain. I’m exhausted and want to go to bed.”</p><p>She could feel Malfoy’s scowl as she led him through the interior hallways of the house to find the master bedroom, but realized she was honest to Merlin smirking as she stepped into the large room, seeing that the travel agent hadn’t been underselling this place, and slid to the side so that he could follow her and see what she saw. She held in a chuckle at the sight of Malfoy stopping in his tracks, one hand going up to steady himself against the doorframe as he looked out to see that the back wall of the bedroom was made entirely of glass panels, looking out onto a deck running the length of the home, and, further, the city sprawled beneath them from their spot in the hills, electric lights twinkling in the haze. </p><p>“It’s passable,” he said after a few long moments, but there was a strain in his voice that reminded her of those first moments when he’d looked out at the ocean, and she reminded herself that Malfoy had been - was basically still - imprisoned, and she decided to accept passable as a compliment.</p><p>“I, uh, figured we’d share this bedroom. You can make yourself comfortable, I’ll go into the bathroom to get changed,” she said, grabbing at her bag and hurrying into the attached bathroom to put on her pajamas. As she changed, she took a few deep breaths to steady herself. He’d said yes, and they were here, and about to share a bed together. She didn’t think anything would happen <em>yet</em>, not when they were so tired and had so much time to spare, but... She pulled on her comfortable pajama pants and a thin sleeping shirt, when the thought suddenly floated into her head that she wondered what Narcissa Malfoy wore to bed, and wished she’d thought to bring something... silkier. Shaking that thought from her head, because he was doing this in exchange for something, because she’d asked, not because he found her particularly attractive, or that she wanted him to find her particularly attractive, she stepped back out into the bedroom. </p><p>“Oh!” Hermione started, coming out of the bathroom to find the sliding glass doors open, Malfoy standing outside on the balcony dressed in only his undergarments, leaning against the railing and looking thoughtfully down at the city sprawling out in front of them. He turned back to her, his pensive expression turning to a predatory smirk at her obvious blush.</p><p>“Problem, Granger?” She shook her head furiously, but his grin just grew as he stretched languidly, “One would think you’d never seen a man in his underclothes before.” </p><p>“Of course - of course I’ve seen - of course I have!” she spluttered, crossing her arms furiously and keeping her gaze fixed determinedly on his face, even as she felt her own grow warmer with shame. As if the man was a bloody Legilimens, his gaze grew suddenly sharp at her stuttered denial, and he advanced towards her.</p><p>“You have, haven’t you...?” His voice was quiet and low, and Hermione shivered slightly at a breeze that picked up. She felt her nipples stiffen, and his gaze drop suddenly to where they were showing through her sleep shirt, and crossed her arms more tightly. </p><p>He paused, looking at her in hesitation, one hand coming up to rub across his face. “Merlin, Granger... Are you sure about this, then?”</p><p>She averted her eyes from his, felt her face growing hot with shame. “Of course I’m sure about this! I’ve given you the bloody Portkey, haven’t I?” </p><p>She knew she was inexperienced, which was why she was <em>here</em>, and not with some other bloody boy who could give her this moment, but that didn’t mean she needed to be reminded of it at every turn. She stepped outside to close the distance between them, leaning up to loop her arms around his neck and pull him into another kiss, which was at least <em>something</em> she was apparently good at, teeth scraping against his bottom lip with a little more force than she’d really intended, frustration spilling over. She felt him jerk slightly and, eyes opening wide, started to pull away, wondering how she could be so bloody stupid as to have already messed this up, when she felt him pull her flush against his body, meeting her lips again with as much force as she’d given. He nipped at her bottom lip sharply, and she gasped, delicious sparks beginning low in her core, zipping through her veins, even better than before because she hadn’t been anticipating the pleasure of the heat of his bare body against her, and this time one of his hands had drifted down to grip at her ass, pressing her lower belly against his erection, which felt impossibly hot and hard, separated from her skin by just a few thin layers of fabric, and his other hand had skated up her torso to palm her breast, gently massaging it in a way that set Hermione’s skin on fire. Suddenly, his fingers brushed against her nipple through the fabric of her shirt, and Hermione whined low in her throat, breaking their kiss to look down at his hand on her, her hips pressing against him of their own accord. </p><p>“Just what have you done, Granger?” Malfoy rasped out, voice low and just slightly unsteady as he continued his ministrations. “There’s more to sex than just the act itself, you know... and I’d hate to shortchange either of us.” She could feel herself growing flushed, at the heat that lingered in the air, even at nighttime, at his hand on her breast, at the feel of his interest against her. </p><p>“I... Um...” She flushed, trying to think of a way to admit that her experience had been limited to a few snog sessions and one clumsy groping session with Cormac McLaggen last year when she’d been jealous over Ron, which had been decidedly inferior to whatever magic Malfoy was working on her breast. “Should we... go inside?” </p><p>“No,” he said simply, with a predatory grin. “Tell me, Granger, have you kissed other men since our kiss in the gardens?” </p><p>The hand that had been on her arse had moved to slide inside of her pajama pants, his long fingers stroking against her, smoothly slipping lower, closer to her core, and so her answer came out in a whimper. “Yes, I... I’ve snogged a few boys.” He tweaked at her nipple slightly and she whined in the back of her throat. “Three. Other than you.” </p><p>“Mmm,” he said, “and did you let any of these <em>boys</em> touch your breasts?” He’d leaned down to whisper in her ear, warm breath puffing against the sensitive skin of her ear, and followed it up with the barest scrape of his teeth and a flick of his fingers against her nipple, and, <em>Merlin</em>, if he hadn’t admitted that he didn’t have a wand she’d have accused him of using magic, because she felt like she was going to burst into flames if the heat that was building inside of her body didn’t find some outlet. When she’d asked this of Malfoy, she had no idea that it would be like this. She’d thought she’d certainly overromanticized that first kiss, mistaken natural hormonal reactions in their first flush for the intense heat he’d built in her with a kiss, so when her few snog sessions had left her content, slightly tingly, she’d not even stopped to consider that sex with Malfoy would be anything other than a slightly better extension of that. This... this spiraling, needy, desperate feeling, before he’d ever done anything that MacLaggen hadn’t done, before he’d even taken her top off, was not expected. She was struck by the sudden wonder whether it was just that Malfoy actually knew what he was doing, or if she’d ever respond to another man the way her body was singing at Lucius Malfoy’s barest touch.</p><p>“Granger?” he asked smoothly, the slightest hint of concern lacing his otherwise husky voice as he brought her back to earth with a gentle squeeze of her ass. </p><p>“I- Yes, just one,” she murmured, remembering his question, and she felt a slight bristling - <em>jealousy?</em> Surely not. But... “But it was... it wasn’t anything like <em>this</em>,” she continued. “I didn’t...” she stumbled over her words, trying to figure out how to admit the truth of the matter without embarrassing herself completely, considering whether she cared about embarrassing herself when his fingers had resumed their slow caresses, slipping steadily lower, closer to her core. Finally his hand slipped low enough to just brush against her opening through her knickers, which he must be able to feel were embarrassingly wet, absolutely sopping, and she gasped, jerking forwards as the words tumbled out of her, “No one’s ever made me feel like this,” she gasped, and she heard him grunt, his head falling against her shoulder as she felt his cock twitch against her. </p><p>“Has anyone ever touched your cunt?” he said, voice harsh and broken against her neck, even as his hand continued stroking her there. </p><p>“No, just me, and now you, no one else,” she whined, torn between the need to arch her back and grind her hips backward against his hand or press them forward against the heat of his cock between them. “Please,” she muttered, not even sure what she was pleading for, and he suddenly let go of her, taking a step back as he gulped in the nighttime air. </p><p>“Much as I’d like to, I’m not going to fuck you tonight, Granger, not when we have eighteen hours of this, and you have so much to learn. Tell me what you want to do, what you want to learn,” he said, arms reaching back for the steadying support of the patio railing. </p><p>She took the moment to steady herself as well, to drink in the night air and let the desperate urge to come recede slightly. He was giving her an option, and she didn’t want to waste it, not the chance to learn, or to experience more of him. Once she’d reined in her first instinct, which was just to demand he make her come the fastest way he knew how, she took a long look at his almost naked body, leaning against the railing, not looking away in shame as she had earlier that night. He was still too thin for his broad and powerful frame, no doubt from his time spent in Azkaban, but she could see the wiry, corded strength in his arms, his legs, the solidness of his chest and abs. When she let her eyes rest on his cock, barely covered by a layer of thin black cotton but clearly hard and straining, she felt a clench low in her gut, and for a moment her eyes fluttered closed as she imagined what it would be like to have inside of her, before her eyes snapped back open and the answer came to her. </p><p>“I... I want to give you a bl-blow job,” she said, stumbling only slightly over the unfamiliar words, only ever read or overheard, never spoken, and she watched with intense interest as she saw his erection twitch under his underwear. </p><p>“Are you certain you’re not trying to kill me, brat?” Malfoy groaned, eyes closed as a vein in his neck throbbed, hands gripping the railing tightly. “We should go inside, now.”</p><p>Hermione started to take a step to turn back inside but paused, admiring for a moment the silhouette of his body against the city sprawled beneath them, lights twinkling, and took a breath, trying to regain some of the control that had slipped from her under his skilled hands. “No. I... Out here is... good.” </p><p>He raised an eyebrow, and she pushed down the residual shame that had stilled her tongue and made her stumble. Wasn’t that what the point of this was, anyway? To pick a person she didn’t have to feel shame with, who couldn’t tell anyone else about this, who she wouldn’t have to interact with after this was all over and remember that he’d maybe judged her? To be able to just let go. She took another deep breath and then met his gaze. </p><p>“I like the night breeze. I like the way you look with the city behind you. I like thinking about how we’ll look with the city behind us, and me on my knees in front of you.” She felt certain that her face was bright pink now, trying to push down the shame of vocalizing her request so clearly, but his chest was heaving, and she noticed that there was a spot of moisture on his underwear near the tip, his cock straining and leaking. </p><p>“Your knees will hurt on the wood, but by all means, don’t let me get in the way of a pretty picture,” he said, voice low and gravelly even as he clearly fought to keep it steady. She smiled at him, grin spreading as she took a step toward him. As if sensing her uncertainty, he took a deep breath and then focused on her. “Take your clothes off first. It’s not necessary, but I-- a man will want to feel your skin against his... and look at your tits.” </p><p>She grinned at his slip, but acquiesced, first sliding her pajama pants down, leaving her at least somewhat covered, and then, hesitantly pulling her sleep shirt off. She slid her underwear off before she ever met his gaze, before she could lose her nerve, and then looked up at him. His hands were gripping the railing behind him so tightly that his knuckles had gone white, and she felt a surge of adrenaline and arousal at the open lust in his gaze, pupils so dilated his eyes almost looked black in the low light. </p><p>“Now finish undressing me,” he said tightly, eyes snapping shut as she took a few steps closer and gripped the waistband of his shorts, hearing his sharp intake of breath as her hands brushed against the bare skin of his hips, and then she tugged them down to the ground, lowering herself to kneel in front of him. He kicked them to the side, but she was preoccupied with the sight of his naked cock. It looked, to her, impossibly large, only slightly longer than average but thick, flushed bright red and leaking from the tip. She licked her lips and saw it jerk slightly, chancing a glance upward to see Malfoy staring down at her with something wildly desperate in his eyes, and, keeping their eye contact, she reached up to trace the length of his cock with the barest brush of her fingers, feeling it twitch beneath her fingers and his eyes widen slightly, breath coming faster now. </p><p>“Now what?” she said, with just the slightest hint of a smirk, and she watched the movement of his throat as he gulped, eyes screwing shut. </p><p>“Explore it. Study it. You’re good at that, Granger. I’ll tell you what’s good and what’s not.” His voice was strained, and she grinned, feeling that same flush of power she’d felt as a fifteen year old who’d made him groan with a kiss. </p><p>Without preamble, she leaned forward and licked at the smear of moisture that was leaking from his cock now, heat blossoming in her core at his guttural groan. “Was that good?” she asked smugly, replacing her tongue with her fingers, spreading the moisture down his length as she tried to wrap her mind around its length and girth, familiarize herself with the veins, the flare of the head. </p><p>“Yes, and you know it, you insufferable brat,” he muttered through gritted teeth, muscles straining as he clearly tried to hold himself still, hips rocking just slightly. </p><p>“Acceptable, exceeds expectations, or outstanding?” she said with a slight chuckle, leaning down to give his length another lick, this time from the base up to the tip, feeling a rush of heat and wetness as she imagined taking it in her mouth. </p><p>“Outstanding. Now stop gloating and start sucking my cock before I give up on the notion of teaching you anything altogether and just fuck that pretty little mouth of yours until I come down your throat,” he growled, one hand going down to tangle in her hair and pull her closer, and Hermione gasped, eyes fluttering at the wave of arousal that shot through her at his words, at the picture they’d painted. Merlin but she <em>wanted</em> that, wanted to see him break, wanted to know it was all because of her. Sitting back on her heels, she brought one hand to his thigh and the other wrapped around the base of his cock to steady it. She looked up to meet his heated gaze, and then, eyes never leaving his, wrapped her mouth around his length and took as much of it into her mouth as she could, moaning slightly at the weight of it in her mouth and the musky taste of him.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>***</p>
</center><p>He dug his nails into the wooden railing of the patio so hard he felt certain he’d leave permanent scratches, breathing through his nose and counting backwards from 100 as the Granger girl sank her mouth more than halfway down his cock. </p><p>Merlin but she was trying to kill him. He’d been holding off an orgasm since she’d been rutting against him, he’d felt her sopping wet knickers, and she’d admitted that no one had ever touched her like this before, and he’d needed her mouth on his cock before he embarrassingly came at the ghost of her fingers against him and a broad lick of her tongue. And, bloody hell, but the way she’d looked at him when he’d snapped at her that he’d fuck her mouth -- he’d been able to <em>smell</em> the arousal on her, the heat in her gaze -- she wanted it, but he’d be damned if he was going to cut this time short. </p><p>She was continuing now, bobbing up and down, and he finally contained himself enough to mutter in a strangled voice, “If you can’t take it all, use your hand. Up and down.” </p><p>She complied immediately, her hand beginning to pump the lower half of his shaft in the same rhythm as she was moving her mouth, and he began reciting potions recipes in his head as all of the blood in his body poured straight to his cock, his entire being focused on the feel of her mouth on him. He’d almost had himself under control again, helped by her slightly too tight grip, when he noticed that she was working herself further down, taking more of him into mouth, slowly but steadily, and as she pushed just slightly further, his cock hit the back of her throat, she made a choked little moan, and he groaned, hips snapping forward to push himself further into her mouth. She made another choked sound, and he felt her throat tighten around him. Suddenly, intensely, as if putting it off had only made it all more powerful, he felt the heavy pressure at the base of his spine, felt his balls grow heavy, and he jerked her off of him by the hair, thinking hard about naming the past thirteen generations of the Malfoy family tree and imagining exactly their facial expressions if they could see him now as he fought down his orgasm.</p><p>“Fuck, Granger, I’m sorry,” he said, looking down to see her hair wild from his grip in it, her eyes wide and slightly red, watery at the corners from where she’d choked, lips shiny with saliva and pre-cum. </p><p>“More,” she said, voice raspy and hoarse, and his eyes fluttered closed as he focused intently on his great-great-uncle Ulysses Malfoy’s five offspring, anything but her utterly debauched look and the way she was asking him for <em>more</em>, because if he focused on that he wouldn’t be able to give her any more. “Please, more,” she said, whining this time.</p><p>“Okay, okay, yes. Fuck. Relax your throat. If it’s too much, tap my thigh, okay? I can’t-- oh, fuck,” he said, he knew he was babbling, but <em>Merlin’s bloody teeth</em> she was licking her lips and opening her mouth again, eyes meeting his with a dazed, hungry gleam, and then he was holding her head steady, his hands wrapped in those long curls as he fucked into her mouth, watching as she focused on relaxing her throat, on taking as much of him into her as possible, eyes watering even as she strained forward to meet him, and when he saw one of her hands slip down to brush tentatively over her clit it was all too much. He felt the rhythm of his hips grow erratic, felt a twist in his gut, and he tried to pull her off of him, “fuck, Granger, I’m going to-”, but she shook her head slightly and pushed back against him, keeping his cock in her mouth as he came with a helpless groan. When she finally pulled back, some of his cum had spilled out of one side of her mouth, but she screwed her eyes shut and he watched intently at the movement of her throat as she swallowed. </p><p>He briefly considered murdering every other man on the planet, so that no one else could have the exquisite pleasure of seeing Hermione Granger on her knees, their cum leaking out of her swollen, swotty little mouth, but chalked that up to post-orgasmic delusion. He was trying to <em>teach</em> her, in the event that she made it out of this godforsaken war with her life. </p><p>Once the haze of his orgasm cleared, he was left with the overwhelming need to make her come, to break her down as completely as she’d broken him. He didn’t even pause, just reached down and hauled her up to her feet, and then into his arms, one arm under her shoulders and the other under her knees as he carried her back into the bedroom and tossed her onto the bed. </p><p>“Wh-what are we doing now?” she asked, eyes darting between him and the open door, as she scrambled back on the bed slightly. </p><p>“Now, I’m going to demonstrate how to make you scream,” he said, voice low and guttural, as he joined her on the bed, pressing a searing kiss to her lips as his hand finally made his way down body and slipped against her cunt. Merlin but she was soaked, gasping against his mouth as he ran a finger through her folds, her body bucking slightly against him. If he hadn’t just had an earth-shattering orgasm, or if he were twenty years younger, he’d be hard again just from the sight and feel of her. Her hair still smelled like earl grey and honeysuckle, and now, just the hint of salty sea breeze, he realized as he trailed open-mouthed kisses down her neck, a scrape of teeth down her collarbone, hearing her moan beneath him, writhing as he slid one finger inside of her, and bloody fucking hell she was tight, even this wet. She was gasping for breath beneath him, whining almost constantly now, her nails scrabbling against his bare back. He leaned down to take one of her nipples in his mouth, flicking his tongue across it as he brought his thumb to rub tiny circles against her clit, and she absolutely keened, her cunt clenching around his finger as he focused singlemindedly on her pleasure. She was moaning now, words spilling out between her moans, most of them curses and absolute nonsense, but then he caught, between an “oh Merlin” and a “bloody fuck, yes”, his name, spilling from her lips, “yes, Malfoy, yes, oh, Lucius, please,” and he growled against her as he increased his speed against her clit, shifting his other hand to continue his ministrations on her breasts so he could look up at her and whisper, voice hoarse and shaky, “That’s right, Granger, come on, come for me, scream my name when you come for me Hermione.” </p><p>That seemed to snap something inside of her, as her eyes flew open to meet his briefly before she moaned, her back arching, her cunt fluttering tight against his fingers, his name spilling from her lips -- “oh, oh, yes, Malfoy, I’m, yes, oh fuck, <em>Lucius</em>.” </p><p>She slumped beneath him, breath unsteady as he rolled to her side, panting heavily, and drew the covers over them. He leaned over to place a gentle kiss against her damp hairline, murmuring his praises against her skin. “Outstanding, Granger.” </p><p>She looked over at him with a slightly dazed smile, rolling onto her side to press herself against him, one arm slung over his chest. “Erm, is this... alright?” </p><p>He looked down at her, considering, before he decided he was too tired and pleasantly flushed with orgasm to care about whether or not he should want to cuddle with the Mudblood after she’d come all over his hand. He leaned up slightly to wrap one arm around her shoulders, tugging her closer and running his hands through her curls. “Now it’s alright,” he said, sleepily, eyes beginning to flutter closed, but she’d already sunk into slumber, based on the sound of her steady breathing.</p>
