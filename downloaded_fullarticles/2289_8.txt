    <p>Harry sat looking out the window of 12 Grimmauld Place at the passing muggles while trying to decide where to go from here. The battles were finished, the war won, the madman was dead. Now what? Since joining the magical world he’d faced one trial after the other with seemingly no end and never thought he’d survive to have to worry about a future. Hermione thought he should go back to Hogwarts and sit his N.E.W.T.s with her and the rest of the returning students. Ron was starting auror training in the fall instead much to her dismay. Harry didn’t feel right with either suggestion and didn’t want to make a choice while feeling so frozen in confusion to regret it later.</p><p>A soft cry came from the floor above him and he smiled. Teddy was awake. He stood to go get the infant when he heard Sirius shuffling his feet overhead. “I’ll get him changed if you’ll start breakfast and put on the kettle.” Sirius barked down the stairs. He’d never really been a morning person and having a wailing alarm clock that went off every few hours had been an adjustment for them both. Harry shouted his agreement back and set off to see what they had for breakfast.</p><p>“Good morning. Hope bacon and eggs are fine with you again. Neither of us has been to the store in a few days.” Harry remarked as Sirius entered the kitchen.</p><p>“As long as I’m not cooking it’s perfect.” Sirius replied. “I guess it’s about time to replace Kreacher now that things have settled down. Maybe get a few to whip this gloomy place in to shape since we’ve got little Teddy here now.” When Sirius walked in the house after the battle at the Department of Mysteries Kreacher had dropped dead in what was assumed fear and anger after his failed collaboration with Bellatrix to kill him. With Molly around cooking constantly for the Order there seemed no need to replace him since no one really actually lived there except Sirius and he didn’t really mind picking up after himself.</p><p>“Couldn’t hurt. I’m sure it will make things easier on us both and this place could use more than just well-aimed scourgify can fix.”</p><p>“I’ll look into it the next time I head into Diagon Alley. Onto real issues, have you thought any more about what you want to do now? You know you are welcome here as long as you want but you’re young and I think you need to finally take advantage of the fact that you can leave the house without being afraid someone is around the corner waiting to kill you. It doesn’t have to be Hogwarts and it doesn’t have to be the Ministry but you need some kind of plan.”</p><p>“Yes….and no. I just don’t really know what to do. I’m extremely honored that Kingsley is willing to waive N.E.W.T.s for us to join this fall but I’m also so tired of fighting. Hogwarts sounds great. A year to relax without Voldemort as a constant threat. But I’m worried that as bad as it was to be ‘The Boy Who Lived’ being ‘The Boy Who Lived Again’ will be even worse. I don’t really know what to do, Siri.” Harry replied.</p><p>“Harry, people are going to gawk, gossip, point, and whisper be it at Hogwarts or the Ministry. Unfortunately, you will never be able to walk down Diagon Alley without someone noticing and making a production out of what kind of underwear you picked out or why you chose fish and chips this week when you had shepherd’s pie last week and what that might mean for the rest of us. However, you cannot let that keep you from going out and living life. Hell, go out and get a brainless job in muggle London, find a club and get a little rowdy, organize the library, or plant a garden. I don’t care what you do as long as you actually do something other than stare out the window watching other people walk by living their lives. When is the last time you actually spoke to Ron or Hermione?” Sirius asked.</p><p>Before Harry replied he realized it had been a while. He saw them after the final battle and then they attempted to go out to celebrate a week later which had ended when they were mobbed when walking into the Leaky. They exchanged owls discussing trying again but Harry felt too much pressure from Ginny to rekindle their relationship to go to the Burrow and plans just became vague and drifted away. The last owl he remembered sending off was well over 3 weeks ago. He was both shocked and ashamed. How had he not realized he had ceased communication with his two best friends? Why was it so easy to let it slip away? Shame faced he looked Sirius in the eye and admitted he couldn’t even recall when it was or what they had spoken of. He had no idea where they were or what they were doing.</p><p>“Harry, it’s fine. They will understand. You don’t have to have all of the answers now for what you want to do in the future, you just have to realize you now have a future and it’s fine to live it.” Sirius stated. “Now, I’ll deal with the clean-up. You should spend the day thinking about what you want to do, long term or short term, and I want some kind of idea tonight.”</p><p>Harry thanked Sirius for the wakeup call and hugged him as he left the room. He had a lot of thinking to do.</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~HPDM~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>Draco walked the hallways of the manor that felt drenched with the horrors and atrocities that recently came to pass in his childhood home. Home. Funny word that is. The manor never really felt like home but more like a holding cell with his father as the cruel heartless jailer. Hogwarts had always been his escape, his true home. The only place he ever really felt safe, the place he felt he actually grew up in even if he was forced to wear a mask after realizing his mistakes to protect others. He could not care less what anyone thought of him if it saved the lives of those he loved. Yet because of that mask his return to Hogwarts was something he did not see as feasible. There was too much pain and hurt and too many people needing someone to blame. Repeating his 7th year did not appear to be in the cards for him. He could study independently at home and take his tests at the Ministry like the others who chose not to return this September at the end of the school year.</p><p>There was a small pop and a house elf was standing before him. “Master Draco, Mistress Narcissa requests you join her in the conservatory.”</p><p>“Thank you, Nippy. Please tell her I will be there shortly.” Draco wondered how long it would take for his mother to bring up her desire for him to return to Hogwarts this time. She had been after him at least once a day since McGonagall announced the castle would reopen as normal in September and welcome back all students just as they always had. Draco walked towards the conservatory stopping off along the way in his potions lab to check on a particularly troublesome potion he was working on.</p><p>When he entered the conservatory, he was greeted by his mother and his best friend Blaise. “Good afternoon Mother. Nippy failed to inform me that you had called in the reinforcements to attempt to convince me to return to Hogwarts.” Blaise had been on the neutral side of the war refusing to declare an allegiance or even entertain a conversation with anyone who brought Voldemort or the need to pick a side up. Because of this he had no reason not to head back in September and was trying to guilt Draco into joining him in any way he could. Now that Mother and Blaise had joined forces he didn’t know how much longer he could hold out on his refusal. They were both forces to be reckoned with alone so together he had no chance.</p><p>“Darling, don’t be that way. Blaise just stopped by to talk to you as I called Nippy to summon you so he decided to wait here for you instead of tracking you down in the manor.” Narcissa beamed back at him. Draco highly doubted this as all Blaise had to do was call for an elf and ask where Draco was but he decided he’d not explicitly call his mother out over it.</p><p>“How are you Blaise? What brings you here today?” Draco asked unbelievingly. He had just seen Blaise last night so he knew there was nothing he could need to talk about so soon after parting. It hadn’t even been twelve hours since they last parted and knowing Blaise he slept the majority of those hours away.</p><p>“Oh, just in the neighborhood and thought I’d swing by and see what you were up to. It’s been so long since I’ve seen you so I figured I’d check in.” Blaise smirked and winked at Draco.</p><p>“I’m still doing the same thing today that I was doing last night when you came by. Working on streamlining and simplifying potions. But if you are that interested in my work that if I recall correctly you called boring and needless last night, I would be happy to send you updates every hour by house elf or owl.”</p><p>Blaise laughed and admitted defeat, “Ok, you caught me. We’ve teamed up to try to show you how refusing to go back to Hogwarts is a terrible idea. You can’t plan on wasting your days away in this place. You’ll never know how the public is going to treat you if you don’t leave. Potter spoke for you and your mother and essentially pardoned all your actions. If the Chosen One is on your side do you really think you’re going to be lynched in the streets?”</p><p>Narcissa paled. While she agreed she would not have phrased it quite like that. “Draco dear, please consider if not Hogwarts, just leaving the house. Blaise was telling me Pansy’s birthday is approaching and they are having a party for her. Go. See your friends and test the waters. If it goes bad I promise to not mention Hogwarts again. I just want you happy.”</p><p>Draco sighed. It was a very tempting offer. He was feeling a bit stifled after nearly 3 months without leaving the grounds. He did miss a few of his friends and it would be interesting to see how his reentry into the group would go. Plus, if it did all go tits up he had his mother’s word she’d stop the incessant pleading. “Very well. I’ll go to Pansy’s party. I will hold you to your promise though, Mother.”</p><p>Draco was not sure who was more surprised at his easy acceptance. His mother called for tea service and the three of them talked for the next hour before Blaise left after telling Draco he’d owl him with all the details of the party later. He nodded his acceptance and kissed his mother’s cheek as he left the room. He had a potion to check on.</p>
