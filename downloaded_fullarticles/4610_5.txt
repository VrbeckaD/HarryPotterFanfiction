    <p>France, February 1927</p><p>The beauty of the sparkling crystal chandeliers are muted by the dark and somber mood that blanketed the witches and wizards that were shifting underneath.   The multitude of languages spoken in urgent tones laced with panic surrounded the majestic hall.   Porpentina Goldstein took a deep breath and tried to focus on other things than hushed clipped mutterings about '<em>Grindelwald</em>'.</p><p>"MACUSA Aurors, this way please!"  The booming voice of Percival Graves shifted her attention to follow a small group of men and women in long leather black coats with faces obscured by equally dark hats to a fireplace that was big enough to fit the group.   There was a golden rod struck right at the middle of the hearth with an unmarked tin can with its lid sticking out.</p><p>The MACUSA delegation began to file in the fireplace but before Tina managed to set foot inside, a familiar voice rang from behind.  "A word, Mr. Graves."  From the corner of her eye,  Theseus Scamander with his dark curls and immaculately tailored suit, met Graves halfway.  The two men exchange brief words before Graves' face settles into a deeper scowl.  </p><p>"Please give me a minute",  Graves' grumbles to the MACUSA Aurors before stalking back to the crowds and getting lost in the swirl of wizards and witches.    Tina hears the curious murmurings of her colleagues before they disperse to their own little circles moving away from the marked fireplace that held their portkey back to New York.</p><p>Tina looked down at her scruffy boots and shifted uncomfortably wondering if she should mingle with the Senior Aurors she barely knew or approach the elder Scamander brother.   When she raised her head again, she caught Mr. Scamander walking toward her with smile.</p><p>"Ms. Goldstein,"  Theseus started with pleasantries.  "I hope you are well."</p><p>A fleeting moment of uncertainly crossed her eyes but Tina swatted the feeling away and curved her lips into what she hoped was a reassuring smile, "I am just fine, Mr. Scamander."</p><p>Theseus gave a humorless laugh, "Well, that's certainly better than the lot over there."  He gestured at the crowd milling around then.  "Most of them are just spooked."</p><p>"I can't blame them."  Given events of the past few days, Tina doubted anyone would be brimming with certainty and confidence. </p><p>"Have you considered the offer?"  Theseus lowered his voice making sure that no one else but her could hear.  "After all that has happened recently, I don't think there will be that many takers."</p><p>Tina bit her lip feeling put on a spot.  "I'm certain that there will be more qualified candidates who will gladly volunteer."</p><p>"But not you?   You certainly showed enough prowess after running into Grindelwald twice now."</p><p>"It was luck",  Tina shrugged feeling unlucky enough to stumble upon the said dark wizard.  Perhaps Grindelwald was right after all, she really did have a penchant for showing up where she wasn't wanted.</p><p>"There is no luck in our profession, Ms. Goldstein",   Theseus countered his smile growing wider as he fished a sealed letter from his coat and presented it to her.   "Perhaps there are accidents but certainly not luck."</p><p>"I have family, Mr Scamander."  Tina glanced nervously back at the MACUSA delegation who seemed to be taking an interest  on the fresh out-of-probation American Auror and the high ranking Auror of the British Ministry she was talking to.  "I don't think I can afford to leave in times like these...",  Tina trails off.</p><p>"Just in case you change your mind",  Theseus nods at the parchment in his hands. </p><p>Tina relented, took the parchment and slipped it in her pockets.   Taking a steadying breath, Tina uttered what had been in her mind the moment she saw Theseus Scamander,  "How is your brother doing?"</p><p>"Much better.  The doctors in St. Mungo's are keeping him sedated but they expect him to be up and about soon."   </p><p>"I never got around to thanking you for coming to my brother's aid, Ms. Goldstein", Theseus shoved his hands in his coat pockets and gave her a grateful smile.  "And for helping me with his creatures.  Merlin knows I would have buggered it all up considering how badly I handled that niffler!" The two shared a small laugh until they heard someone pointedly clear their throat.</p><p>They turn to see Percival Graves headed towards them with an annoyed expression.  "Mr. Scamander, I would appreciate if you could not try to steal my Aurors while I am gone."  </p><p>Theseus threw his head back and laughed.  "Of course not, Percival."  He says candidly with a smidge of mischief.   "I'm simply bidding Ms. Goldstein farewell on behalf of my brother."    </p><p>"Please do give my regards to your brother, Mr. Scamander, as soon as he is well."  Tina said with formality.</p><p>"Most certainly."  Theseus gives a rather extravagant bow, causing Graves mumble something incoherent under his breath,  before sauntering back to the crowds.</p><p>With a huff, Graves shepherds the rest of his MACUSA Aurors back to the fireplace and their ticket back to New York.   Taking a deep breath, Tina reaches for the portkey and lets herself be hurled back home.</p><p>-----------</p><p>New York, February 1927</p><p>It's the second time she has used a portkey and both trips were equally unpleasant, leaving Tina grappling with blossoming headache.   Still, it was highly effective considering she got back to New York while there was still enough daylight to walk back home.  </p><p>And Tina was grateful for a chance to clear her head before Queenie pokes at it.</p><p>Growing up with a legilimens for a sister meant that Tina had no choice but to learn to harness the opposite.   Occlumency is not a skill that is readily taught but circumstances presented in their childhood gave her ample opportunities to learn without knowing what it exactly was.   So while Queenie was a natural legilimens, Tina became an occlumens by necessity in order to protect her sister from herself.  For how could she effectively raise her sister, if the brave facade can easily be broken by traitorous dark thoughts that occasionally bubbled up the surface.</p><p>However, there was an art in closing her mind and avoid Queenie's prying questions if she didn't see enough.   Tina cannot close her mind completely but she can dampen things that Queenie might find more interesting than the latest exploits of Gellert Grindelwald, things that pertain to her personal life.  Particularly a failed date with a British wizard they were both acquainted with.</p><p>Tina couldn't find it in herself to spite Newt for the less than ideal circumstances they had faced.   Her concern for his injuries outweighed her disappointment.   But still, she didn't want Queenie to ask too many prying questions that she didn't want to ask herself.  Tina took a steadying breath, letting the memories and emotion fade a little.   </p><p>It must have took quite a while since by the time she was done rearranging her mind, she found herself at the foot of her brownstone.   She reached out and twisted the handle to let herself in feeling more at ease in the drab hallway compared to the posh room she was assigned in Paris.  </p><p>"Is that you, Tina?"  The disembodied voice of Mrs. Esposito traveled downstairs.</p><p>"Yes, Mrs. Esposito."  Tina called back and began her ascent to the small apartment she shared with her sister.   To her surprise once she got to the second floor landing, the aforementioned woman approached her limping slowly with the aid of a walking stick.</p><p>"How are you dear?"  Mrs. Esposito readjusted the dark rimmed glasses that was sliding down her plump nose and squinted at her.  "My, you seem to be looking much worse for wear Tina."</p><p>"Nothing to worry about ma'am."  Tina sighed desiring nothing more than to collapse on her bed.  "The travel just left me a little tired."</p><p>"Oh I'm so sorry to keep you dear."  Mrs. Esposito reached into the pocket of her apron and produced a small note.  "You sister left this for you.  She seemed to be in awful lot of hurry."</p><p>"Thank you very much ma'am."  Tina took the note and bade the old woman farewell, watching her retreat back to her own unit.   </p><p>Finally, Tina unlocked the door to their apartment. It was dark but Tina paid no attention thinking that Queenie was probably out.</p><p>She let herself in and when her eyes adjusted to the darkness, felt the air in her lungs being sucked away.</p><p>Furniture were upended.  The meager books and magazines in their shelf now lie in a messy pile.  Various kitchenware and dishes lay broken on the floor.   But that wasn't really what caught her attention.   Someone saw it fit to even vandalize their wall.</p><p>
  <em>Traitors.</em>
</p><p>Slipping her wand from her coat, Tina gripped it until her knuckles turned white.   She quietly moved through the apartment swallowing the rising panic that something unsavory may have happened to her sister.   After checking each room and determining there was no one inside,  Tina finally read the note Mrs. Eposito had given her.  It was a nothing more but a name, a number and an address written in her sister's elegant script.</p><p>Without another thought, Tina apparated away.</p><p>-----------</p><p>"Excuse me but you are not allowed in there!"</p><p>An indignant nurse followed Tina as she purposely strode through the ward eyes darting back and forth reading the numbers plastered on the doors.</p><p>"I'm calling security to have you escorted out",   The nurse threatened, jabbing a finger at her direction with her sharp heels angrily clicking against the tiles as she began to retreat but Tina paid no heed and continued to look for a specific door.</p><p>"I'm sorry but there is no need for that ma'am."   The soft voice of her sister called out and relief flooded through Tina's veins seeing that Queenie is alive and well.  "That's my sister."</p><p>The nurse stopped and crossed her arms over her chest.   "I hope you understand, Mrs. Kowalski that visiting hours are over."</p><p><em>Mrs. Kowalski?</em>  Tina looked intently at her sister knowing that she must have read that comment loud and clear.</p><p>Queenie choked on a sob and diverted her eyes back at the nurse.  "I'm so sorry, ma'am.  My sister just got back from her trip and she has been so worried.   If you would please look past this, just this once..."  The nurse threw Tina another disapproving look but walked away without another word.</p><p>"Teenie, I'm so sorry."  Tears began to fall in earnest from Queenie's eyes.   "I didn't know what to do!   Jacob is...  We.... I should have told you...", she stammered as Tina grabbed her sister into a fierce hug.   One of the advantages of having a legillimen's sister was how Tina never bothered to say the words, instead she just emphasizes the emotions she couldn't convey.</p><p>
  <em>"It's okay".</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"I'm so glad you're okay".</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"I'm here."</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Please don't worry."</em>
</p><p>For a long while the Goldstein sisters just stood in the hallway just holding on to each other.   Tina let her exhausted sister cry on her shoulders pushing warm and loving thoughts hoping that somehow there was something she could do to ease her pain.  When Queenie finally stepped away from her, she regarded her sister carefully while wiping her eyes with the back of her hand.</p><p>"Since when did you know?"</p><p>
  <em>"About Jacob?"</em>
</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"Since the moment you were practically floating home carrying an erumpet shaped bread."  Tina chuckled and wiped her eyes also a little damp with emotion.   "And now I see you have a ring on your finger",  Tina nodded at the simple gold band making her sister blush.</p><p>Queenie wore her heart on her sleeve and Tina rationalized that was her sister's way of balancing the scales, considering she is capable of knowing everything that went inside another person's head.  </p><p>At first, Tina thought that Jacob would be just a passing fancy for her sister.  Between the two of them Queenie got most of the attention from the opposite gender, loved it but was never really serious about pursuing anyone. There must be something so special that Queenie would risk everything for a man she had met a mere two months ago.  </p><p>"But since when did you not invite your own sister to your wedding?!"  Tina pouted and crossed her arms over her chest but unable to keep the mischievous twinkle in her eyes.</p><p>Queenie laughed and threw her arms around her sister once again, "You know that's not true."  </p><p>"I'm happy for you, Queenie."  Tina said with complete honesty as held her sister tighter.</p><p>After a moment, Tina broke apart and looked at the door plastered with the numbers etched on Queenie's note.   She looked at her sister and visualized a question in her mind,  <em>"What happened?"</em></p><p>Without another word, Queenie ushered her sister into the room.   Tina crept quietly inside the darkened room looking at the heavyset figure lying down a rickety looking hospital bed.   Upon closer look, Tina could see reddish dark splotches marring Jacob's face and head wrapped in a bandage.   His left arm was held in a cast, resting on his chest. </p><p>Tina looked at her sister in alarm after seeing the state Jacob is in but  Queenie said nothing and sank into the chair beside the bed.  "Queenie?"  Tina asked softly, imploring with words and thoughts for her sister to tell her what was going on.</p><p>"Two days ago, some people attempted to rob the bakery"  Queenie said in a quiet voice.  "They wanted money and Jacob was willing to comply.   There were customers and Jacob didn't want anyone to get hurt.  But then one of the robbers said something that made Jacob really angry and he fought back."</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"I don't know",  Queenie shook her head.  "He was outnumbered.  He didn't stand a chance..."</p><p>
  <em>"How did you find out?"</em>
</p><p>"I was supposed to meet Jacob for dinner.  He didn't show up, so I went to the bakery."  Queenie looked up and her eyes were spilling with tears.  "He was just there...bleeding on the floor.  Some of Jacob's workers told me what happened.   But when I asked for help... No one. There were so many people gawking around us..."</p><p> "Then what?"  She asked her sister to continue even as TIna grit her teeth feeling a familiar kind indignation pulse through her head.</p><p>"I dragged Jacob to the back alley, away from everyone else.  Then I apparated outside the no-maj hospital",  Queenie sniffed.    "His wounds were pretty bad.  I don't think simple healing charms can help."</p><p>Silence descended in the room as each sister was consumed by their own thoughts.   Queenie reached out and held Jacob's hand as if to reassure herself that he is still there.  While Tina's mind raced to keep with her nagging intuition telling her that there was something else happening, especially now that she has heard of the attack on Jacob and her sister seemingly has no knowledge on how their own apartment was vandalized.   She wanted to believe that it was just typical New York violence but after everything that happened in the past months, a part of her was scared that this is something much bigger than isolated events.</p><p>Queenie studied her sister, standing quietly in the darkness with her eyes fixed on something beyond the drawn curtains.   She was both surprised and worried at the lack of response from Tina.  She wanted to give her sister privacy to think but the silence unnerved her.   Finally she prodded Tina's mind and she gasped when she saw flashes of events just a few days ago.</p><p>Feeling the intrusion, Tina glanced toward her sister with her lips set in a grim line.</p><p>
  <em>"Yes, Queenie.  Grindelwald is back."</em>
</p><p>--------------</p><p>It was past midnight by time Tina apparated back to the apartment she shared with Queenie.  She was exhausted but knew she couldn't get any rest without attempting to return their apartment back to something that looked a habitable.   With a casual flick of her wand, the apartment began to arrange itself based on her memory.   As everything, righted itself she sank down and leaned against the wall, trying to drain some of the tension that weighed down on her shoulders.</p><p>So many thoughts swirled in her mind but she knew that there wouldn't be any answers coming to her tonight.  She stared as at the message on the wall wondering who it was for.  Did someone find out about Queenie and Jacob's relationship?  What if it was a message for her?  Who did she betray? </p><p>It doesn't make any sense.  Sure there were probably some individuals who were not too happy being arrested but something the message didn't sit right with her.   Queenie was breaking the law by reuniting with Jacob and technically so was Tina, for keeping quiet and not reporting anything as a law enforcer.   But if it was just that, why couldn't they just be exposed and expelled from wizarding world.  Why was there a need for threats?  Why was there a need to assault a no-maj?</p><p>
  <em>"We have to stop meeting like this."</em>
</p><p>A chill runs through her frame with the unbidden memory of the smooth voice that accompanied those words.   She never thought she would encounter Gellert Grindelwald again considering he was supposed to be an ocean away from her.  Not only that, she spent months taking orders under him, masquerading as her senior officer.   A question that has plagued her and several others was how could they have not known?  The fact that it took a British wizard to unmask Grindelwald right before MACUSA was a blow to the organization.</p><p>Of course there was the subsequent escape, a mere three months after, further marked MACUSA as an embarrassment to the wizarding world.   No one really expected MACUSA to hold Grindelwald for so long, the speed and efficiency of his escape left everyone baffled.</p><p>Being a newly reinstated Auror in probation, Tina hadn't been allowed to interrogate Grindelwald or guard his cell.  But the few moments she went down the cell together with some other Aurors left her feeling disconcerted.  Grindelwald never spoke to her directly but for some reason she could feel those mismatched eyes track her every move.  </p><p>Queenie was thankful that Tina was nowhere near MACUSA when Grindelwald escaped; hoping that was the last time they will ever encounter the dark wizard.  </p><p>Then Tina had the misfortune of running into him again in France.</p><p>It was certainly different from before.  Tina had people to protect and she didn't hold back like she did when she thought she was dueling Graves.   All the while he regarded her with familiarity.  How she managed to get away unscathed, twice, made wonder if he was playing a game with her.</p><p>With apartment beginning to quiet down as the last of the furniture placed themselves back in order; Tina looked up at the message on the wall and muttered, "Scourgify", and watched it disintegrate to dust.</p><p>Finally, she dragged herself to bed for much needed rest and hoped for a dreamless sleep.</p><p>--------------</p><p>Being an Auror made Tina realize a that criminals are creatures of habit.    Whether or not to stake their claim in the darkness that reside in that space they inhabited or just curious, criminals often return to the scene of the crime or inexplicably leave something behind.</p><p>So there she was a few blocks away from the shattered windows of Kawolski's Bakery, after handing a flimsy excuse on how tired she was from her return trip back to New York.  Luckily for her, she wasn't the only Auror in her group who wasn't up for a day in the office.  In fact, she was the only one who showed up to personally deliver a poor excuse to go home early to the ever grim looking Percival Graves and his towering stack of paperwork.   Luckily for her, Graves merely scowled before waving her off.  </p><p>She agonized on whether or not she should report to MACUSA that their apartment was invaded.   Eventually she decided against it, even if she ought to considering MACUSA has been on constant high alert for the last six months due to surge in cases involving no-maj violence and rogue wizards.</p><p>So for remainder of the day, Tina wandered near the bakery storefront, watching people pass by.  With the exception of a few gawkers, no one really bothered to enter the store.   These desperate times ensured that there was probably nothing of value left in the bakery, hours after its owner left.  </p><p>The rapidly dimming sky, prompted Tina to deftly move closer to the bakery.  Despite not sensing a shred of magic, Tina felt a little wary for she did not know the layout of the bakery.  After a casual glance over her shoulder,  she stepped through the door that was barely hanging on its hinges.  </p><p>Regret flashed through Tina, who had never set foot inside the Kawolski's Bakery.  The broken wood and glass beneath her doesn't paint a picture of what she imagined was a warm and welcoming establishment.  Tina felt like there was nothing noteworthy in the room she was in right now so she moved past the entryway to go behind the counter that led to the kitchen.   The light from the street lamp didn't reach this part of the bakery and it was generally obstructed from the view of any passerby.     </p><p>While the shop area was littered with debris, the kitchen looked like it cleaned out of anything of value.   A little bit to the side there was another door which Tina assumed led to the back alley.  </p><p>Then she heard a rattling noise coming from beyond the door. </p><p>Squaring her shoulders, Tina slipped her wand from her pocket and slowly turned the doorknob to push the door open.  However the door roughly jerked back, surprising and propelling her forward to hit the ground hard.</p><p>"Whadya know... he was right",  a harsh voice sniggered.</p><p>Tina felt something hard make contact with her wand hand and the cool wood was kicked into the darkness.   She bit back a cry as she collapsed back to the ground losing the support from her hand. </p><p>"They're useless without those sticks",  another voice laughed.</p><p>She could hear footsteps coming closer and the stench of alcohol wafted through her nose.   Next thing she knew,  someone roughly hoisted her up, only to throw her back against the wall.   As her head collided on the harsh wall, she felt like she could taste something metallic at the back of her throat and Tina fought to regain her composure amid the jeers and laughter.</p><p>She closed her eyes and tried to visualizing her wand flying back to her good hand.  She was broken out of her focus when she heard someone chortle, "If it was this easy, we shoulda just taken the blonde",  then another round of laughter, "Coulda had a lot of fun with that one!"</p><p>And just like that magic sprung forth and slammed one man harshly to the wall and the other two thrown far into the alley where they fell like ragdolls, unconscious from the invisible force that struck them.   Tina balled her bare hands into a fist and walked towards her nearest attacker; her eyesight suddenly clear enough to see all the details of his ugly mug.</p><p>The man groaned and as he saw her advance he tried to flatten himself against the wall.  "Get away from me, you witch!" </p><p>"Who sent you?"  Tina asked through gritted teeth.   She could feel that this man had no magical capability at all, a no-maj.   Without a shadow of a doubt, regardless of how built this man was, she could take him on - wand or no wand.</p><p>"No one!  It was just a random job!" The man pleaded with blood and sweat dripping down his brow.</p><p>"You know what I am."</p><p>"Some guy just paid us to mess things up here!", the man stammered.  "I swear it's just that!"  </p><p>Tina didn't need to hear anymore.   The situation was similar to the growing trend of wizards hiring non magical people to do their dirty work without risking direct exposure and knowing fully well that actions against no-maj are frowned upon.</p><p>Again she thought of whether or not to report the incident to MACUSA but that would lead to questions as to why Jacob was targeted in the first place and that would inevitably lead to Queenie and herself being punished for breaking Rappaport's Law.   Once again she felt her anger rising at the unfairness of it all.  There are far worst crimes than falling in love.</p><p>
  <em>"Who does the law protect?  Us or them?"</em>
</p><p>The answer was clear.  Tina raised her hand and the man curled into a ball, whimpering in fear.</p><p>"Obliviate."</p>
