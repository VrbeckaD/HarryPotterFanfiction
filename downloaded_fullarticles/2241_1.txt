  <em>July 12th</em>
</p><p>The door flew open and into the dark kitchen an old man with impossibly long flowing silver hair, a beard to match, loose purple robes, and bright blue eyes marched in, putting a stop to all conversation. The old man pulled a chair out from the long table and slumped into it. He looked tired, the kind of tired you feel in your bones after too long worrying and too many sleepless nights.</p><p>There was quite a large group of people at the table, and all of them shared uneasy glances when the man slumped into the chair at the head of the table. The man sitting closest to the silver-haired one slumped in a chair, a young man with ragged black hair and aristocratic features, slightly dull, as if he'd been sick recently, placed a comforting had on the old man's shoulder.</p><p>"What is it, Dumbledore?" he asked eagerly. "What have you found?"</p><p>Dumbledore sighed deeply and looked up at the aristocratic man. His eyes were sad, dull, lacking their usual twinkle, and completely un-Dumbledore-like. He didn't look like the headmaster of Hogwarts. For one, he looked like what he really was; an incredibly old and tired man. One who'd seen far too much over the years. It was an unsettling thing for everyone to see.</p><p>"I fear that Voldemort-" everyone flinched at the name of the evil wizard. "-has found a weapon that can be used against us. One that will most certainly affect the outcome of the war," Dumbledore said tiredly.</p><p>"What is it, Dumbledore?" Arthur Weasley asked, leaning forward. His eyes were wide and curious like he was trying to figure out what could cause enough trouble for even Dumbledore to be worried.</p><p>Dumbledore looked down at his hands. This, more than anything else, shocked the gathered group. Dumbledore was many, many things, but nervous was never one of them.</p><p>"In the months leading up to Halloween nearly fourteen years ago, Lily and James Potter had another secret they kept hidden from everyone, not just their location," Dumbledore said, looking at everyone quite strangely. "I myself only learned of it today after a chat with Mrs. Petunia Dursley, Lily's sister. I am sure that the weapon Voldemort plans to use against us has something to do with what Mrs. Dursley informed me about."</p><p>"What is it that dreadful muggle told you, Albus?" Professor Minerva McGonagall asked, voice shaking tremulously.</p><p>Dumbledore looked around the table, meeting everyone's eyes for a few moments with his own hard gaze. "What I am about to tell you cannot leave this room under any circumstances."</p><p>He waited. Slowly everyone realized the headmaster was waiting for a full confirmation of nods or raised hands. Once a teacher, always a teacher. Heads slowly began to nod around the table, accompanied by low murmurs of agreement. Dumbledore himself nodded, seemingly appeased.</p><p>"On the 17th of October, 1996, the Potters had a second son."</p><p>The room was silent. Everyone was looking at Dumbledore, torn between disbelief and horror. Disbelief that no one had ever known about the Potters' second son. Horror, because if Dumbledore hadn't ever known, then that meant the Potters' second son was probably dead.</p><p>"Is it true?" Sirius choked out. He sounded like he was on the verge of tears, for more reasons than one. "What was his name? What happened to him? What does he have to do with a weapon for You-Know-Who?"</p><p>Dumbledore lowered his head again. "I am afraid I do not know much more than what I've told you. I believe Voldemort plans to use the boy. After all, what better weapon to use against Harry than his own brother, bitter about being kept in the dark and left behind?" Dumbledore shook his head sadly. "Mrs. Dursley was kind enough to tell me that Lily came to her house in the middle of the night the day before Halloween with a baby named Sirius Potter. Lily asked her sister to protect him for a few days. The moment Lily was gone, Mrs. Dursley left the boy on the steps of an orphanage. After that, I do not know what happened to him."</p><p>"Oh, lord," Molly Weasley breathed. "That <em>vile</em> woman just left a baby only a few days old on some steps! Her own nephew! When Lily said she would come back!"</p><p>"Voldemort hasn't found him yet though, has he?" Nymphadora Tonks asked, voice filled with hope that only the young can find so easily. "We can find him first."</p><p>"For that matter, how did we not find him, Dumbledore? He should have been on the Hogwarts registry," Professor McGonagall said. She was frowning deeply.</p><p>"I suspect that he may not be in Britain or any of the surrounding countries anymore," Dumbledore admitted. "Given the age he was at the time of his abandonment, it is more than likely that he was adopted and given a different name, so he could be at Hogwarts, but I believe we would know if another child of Lily and James was at the school. He could also be a squib, but I doubt it."</p><p>"We have to find him then!" Sirius said zealously. "We can't just give up. He could be in danger. And Harry deserves a chance to know his brother."</p><p>Sirius glared at everyone as if daring them to contradict him. No one argued or said anything.</p><p>"Yes, Sirius, we must find him, if only to warn him about the danger he's in," Dumbledore agreed. "And to meet Harry as well. It will do the boy good to know he still has some family left."</p><p>"How are you planning to look for him, Dumbledore?" Kingsley Shacklebolt asked in his slow, deep voice.</p><p>"I learned which orphanage she left him on to 'protect him from her sister's freakishness'," Dumbledore said. "It will be a simple matter to have someone look into the records it keeps and find the boy's name."</p><p>"So what?" Sirius demanded. "We just wait until then and hope You-Know-Who hasn't found him yet?"</p><p>Dumbledore fixed Sirius with a grave stare. "Yes. We hope."</p><p>"And what if 'hope' isn't enough? What if Voldemort's already turned the boy?" Alastor Moody demanded. "What then, Dumbledore?"</p><p>"Then we prepare to lose a little hope. And if Voldemort has turned him, we take care of the problem, without Harry ever finding out."</p>
