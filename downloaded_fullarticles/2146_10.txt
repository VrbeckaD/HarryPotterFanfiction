      <p>"No, Harry's sharing with Ginny," said Hermione firmly, "I'll bunk in with you."</p>
      <p>Ron blinked. <em>What? Why? Argh, I'm too tired for this. Uh, what does it matter anyway…</em></p>
      <p>"Ok. Sure. Whatever."</p>
      <p>A flash of annoyance darted across Hermione's face, almost instantly replaced with exhaustion. It seemed she was too tired to argue too.</p>
      <p>"Do they know?" He said.</p>
      <p>"Yes."</p>
      <p>"Oh." Ron paused. Bed time. Really, that was the next thing.</p>
      <p>He looked down at Hermione. She looked… deflated. Ordinarily, her personality filled space, but tonight… she looked tired. And little. And… so vulnerable.</p>
      <p>Hideous flashes of Malfoy Manor screamed in his mind. He took a sharp breath and pressed his fingers to his eyes.</p>
      <p>"I don't know if it would be more tiring to apparate or walk up the stairs," he said, by way of distracting himself.</p>
      <p>She gazed up at him.</p>
      <p>"Better walk. Too dangerous to splinch. I mean- you know what I mean. I'm tired."</p>
      <p>"Yes,"</p>
      <p>God she was so small. With such <em>big</em> hair. He almost smiled. It was all clean and fluffy now- though there was a big chunk missing where Ginny had cut out a burnt section. He knew an impulse to touch it.</p>
      <p>"Stairs then,"</p>
      <p>"Yes,"</p>
      <p>They started climbing. Stairs creaking. Joints creaking. There was definitely something wrong with his left knee. The stabbing pain dulled the ache from his overworked muscles.</p>
      <p>He pushed open the door.</p>
      <p>
        <em>Oh great.</em>
      </p>
      <p>The camp bed sat, folded haphazardly, in a tangle of bedding in the corner.</p>
      <p>Ron sighed.</p>
      <p>He felt Hermione's small hand on his back.</p>
      <p>"Don't," she said</p>
      <p>
        <em>What?</em>
      </p>
      <p>He turned to look at her.</p>
      <p>She gave a slight shrug and glanced over to his bed, and then back to him.</p>
      <p>Silence seemed to stretch out forever.</p>
      <p>She gazed steadily up at him.</p>
      <p>"Malfoy Manor," she said.</p>
      <p>He flinched.</p>
      <p>She frowned.</p>
      <p>"What's wrong?"</p>
      <p>
        <em>Don't think about it. She's ok.</em>
      </p>
      <p>"Nothing. Everything. I should have done something." He let out a lungful of air. "I am <em>so sorry.</em>"</p>
      <p>Amusement flickered into life on Hermione's face.</p>
      <p>"You have to stop apologising. You saved my life. Besides, it wasn't that bad,"</p>
      <p>
        <em>Hippogriff poop! You nearly DIED, you nearly… you're trying to piss me off. Merlin's saggy- why now? I am FAR too tired to argue. And my knee hurts. And also- don't think about it.</em>
      </p>
      <p>He squashed his outrage and raised an eyebrow.</p>
      <p>She was actually smiling now.</p>
      <p>"Well… yes, it was pretty awful. But we <em>did</em> get out of there, and, you know…"</p>
      <p>She gave him a look he was sure was supposed to be significant.</p>
      <p>"You're going to have to spell it out for me."</p>
      <p>She sighed and went over to the bed, pulling back the covers and slowly climbing in. Gently.</p>
      <p>Ron found he was mentally cataloguing all the injuries he couldn't see.</p>
      <p>She lay on her side, her head on his pillow. Brown eyes surrounded by dark shadows.</p>
      <p>"You said a lot of very nice things when you thought I was unconscious,"</p>
      <p>Ron blinked.</p>
      <p>She was- smirking?</p>
      <p>
        <em>What on earth- oh. Right. THOSE things. Urgh, now I'm blushing. Um- wait a second.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>She's….</em>
      </p>
      <p>He let out a short laugh of disbelief.</p>
      <p>Hermione yawned, and shifted slightly. Ron was suddenly very, very conscious of curves.</p>
      <p>"Think you can say them again now that you know I'm awake?" she was pulling back the covers again, and looking up at him expectantly.</p>
      <p>
        <em>Odd timing. But… really? That's… wow.</em>
      </p>
      <p>He found himself nodding, and blushing and kind of half grinning like a fool. She didn't seem to mind. Just cuddled up to him as he climbed in next to her.</p>
      <p>So small. So comfortable. So… Hermione.</p>
      <p>She was still looking at him.</p>
      <p>
        <em>She really wants you to say it again. She really WANTS you to say it. Huh. Well, then…</em>
      </p>
      <p>"So… things I said, hey?"</p>
      <p>She nodded, a hand stroking up his shirt front. He reached for his wand, and turned out the light to buy himself a moment.</p>
      <p>"You're too skinny," he said. He felt her glance up at him in surprise, "If you ate more lasagne this might not have happened. Why on earth did I let you come on this wild goose chase? If you weren't such a pig-headed, insufferable, know-it-all, we could never have tried this- and if I wasn't such a coward…."</p>
      <p>She slipped her arm under his and gave him a gentle squeeze.</p>
      <p>"You'd skip to the good bit already?"</p>
      <p>He grinned in the dark.</p>
      <p>"I love you so much. Please don't die."</p>
      <p>Her face was somehow very close. Breath, and eyes, and lips.</p>
      <p>"And the things you said at Shell Cottage?"</p>
      <p>He frowned.</p>
      <p>"When?"</p>
      <p>"In the middle of the night- the first night."</p>
      <p>"Oh," Surprising. He would have bet any money she'd been asleep then. Still…</p>
      <p>"Everything is going to be ok. I'm not leaving ever ever again. You can't make me. And a bunch of other things to that effect."</p>
      <p>She was smiling, centimetres away, maybe less.</p>
      <p>"And?"</p>
      <p>"And what?"</p>
      <p>It was a bit distracting- she was all boobs and ribs and curves and he had his hand in her hair- <em>finally</em>- and what was she- <em>oh. That.</em></p>
      <p>She had sort of nudged him with- well, her body.</p>
      <p>He let out an exasperated breath.</p>
      <p>"How is it I still find you sexy when you've just been tortured half to death? I must be the most depraved-"</p>
      <p>He found he was grinning like a goon. She'd giggled.</p>
      <p>"-degenerate moron in the-"</p>
      <p>And she was <em>actually kissing him.</em></p>
      <p>And then-</p>
      <p>"I love you too, you daft git,"</p>
      <p>
        <em>I'm way too tired to know if I'm dreaming or not.</em>
      </p>
      <p>"And if you ever think about leaving, ever, ever again, I want you to remember I just spent a year studying the blackest of the blackest of the most awful magic ever invented. And I'm the most brilliant witch Hogwarts has seen in a century,"</p>
      <p>
        <em>Not dreaming!</em>
      </p>
      <p>Ron snorted.</p>
      <p>"Dark arts, huh? And you think<em> I </em>have a jealous, possessive streak-"</p>
      <p>And she was kissing him again.</p>
      <p>
        <em>Best ever ending to the worst ever day…</em>
