  <strong>
    <em>Harry's POV</em>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>" Watch It Potter". I hear Malfoy say as I'm falling onto the cold hard floor near the library, which seems to be oddly deserted. "You know, Potter" I hear Malfoy ask me with a hint of sarcasm. You've been very clumsy lately, If you keep it up you might just have a little accident and ruin that perfect little face of yours." I get myself off of the floor and tell him "I'm not the only one who's going to have an accident, Malfoy, you'll have one too if you don't keep your mouth shut" Malfoy seethes with anger and spins on his heels "This isn't over Potter." he spat back.</p>
<p> I skip going to the library like I was originally going to do and head to the Gryffindor common room. When I get to the portrait of the fat lady she asks me the password,Caput Draconis, and I head inside. "The common room has a roaring fire, stuffed armchairs, and a great view of the windows. The dormitories are reached by climbing the winding mahogany staircase, decorated with crimson and gold. The four-posters are covered with thick scarlet blankets because we have windy nights up in the towers, and are embroidered with gold. Gold chandeliers cast warm glows all around."<strong>(from Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone)</strong></p>
<p> In the common room I find that there is only two people, Neville and Dean Thomas, which means that Hermione and Ron are probably out visiting Hagrid, without me, as usual. "Hey Harry" says Neville. "Hey Neville what're you and Dean doing?" I ask. "Oh we're just playing exploding snap you want to join?" Dean chimes in. "No thanks" I say "Im-im just gonna go and grab my broom and fly around the field for a bit and uh Neville" -Yes?" He asks looking away from his game. "Um.. are you able to meet up around 12, in the usual spot?" I ask hopefully. "Of course Harry any time" he says with a big smile. "What's that supposed to mean" I hear Dean ask with clear jealousy. "Nothing love" I hear Neville say to Dean.</p>
<p> I smile and turn to walk up the stairs to the boy's dorms. I open my trunk which is filled with broken quills, parchment, what little clothing I own, and my most prized possessions. Which consist of my picture album of my parents, my broom, my invisibility cloak, my glasses, my wand, and my Marauders map. I grab my broom and head out to the field.</p>
<p> When I get to the field I mount on my broom and kick off. I fly close to the clouds and look down at the ground. I love how everything looks smaller when your up high, how things seem calmer, quieter even. You know how everything gets too be too much? Too loud? It's almost as if this never existed when you are up in the sky. It is almost addicting. I fly down to a tree near the lake and sit down on the ground. My mind starts to spin and soon I find myself starting to think about Malfoy and our argument earlier. That's when I noticed this one word.</p>
<p> "Wait" I said aloud "he called my face perfect!" Why would he say that? Does that mean he could like me in the same way? Could he love me? I quickly pulled myself out of those thoughts. No point in getting my hopes up. I Quickly realized that it was dark so I quickly head back to the castle. When I get inside I rush up the steps to the fat lady portrait and say the password. "Caput Draconis". I rush into our dormitories. When I get there I throw my broom into my trunk and look at the clock, 11:48, "Great" I mutter under my breath. I could've gotten caught by Filch or worse Snape. I realize Neville is probably waiting for me down in the Room of Requirements. I grab my invisibility cloak and start on my way.</p>
