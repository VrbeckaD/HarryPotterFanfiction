    <p>George felt empty. As if he weren't really alive. Just an empty shell of what <em> used </em> to be George Fabian Weasley. He lay in bed, staring at the ceiling. He didn't know how long he had been there. He didn't care. He had heard that it wasn't healthy to base your entire existence around one person. People were unpredictable. <em> Temporary</em>. You're supposed to live for yourself. That way you're not hanging onto someone who could leave at any time—who could <em> die </em> at any time... But when you have an identical twin you don't really ever contemplate the idea of them leaving, do you? His whole life had been pinned to Fred—his identical twin brother, his partner in crime, his <em> best friend</em>—and he hadn't even realized until Fred was <em> gone </em>and it resulted in him not being able to bring himself to function. </p>
<p>He forced himself to sit up. Their flat—no, it was just <em> his </em> flat now, wasn't it?—was dark, despite the rays of sunlight threatening to penetrate the curtained windows. He slept in Fred's old room. It didn't make him feel better, exactly. It just helped him when he woke up due to nightmares—meaning every night. George used to only wear his boxers to bed, but now he wore one of Fred's old jumpers too. It helped him cry less at night. Or maybe it did the opposite. He didn't know anymore.</p>
<p>“George?”</p>
<p>George strained to put a name to the voice. He thought he knew—but no, it <em> couldn't </em> be her. This voice was so nervous and meek, not commanding and confident like the Hermione he knew. </p>
<p>“George, if you're here, say something, please!”</p>
<p>George's bloodshot eyes widened. That was <em> definitely </em>Hermione Granger. </p>
<p>“Herm—” His voice has been so unused that he could barely speak above a whisper. He tried again. “Hermione? Why do you sound so...”</p>
<p>“Scared?” Hermione supplied, as she opened the door hesitantly. Looking around the room, her expression showed clear disgust. “George, this room is absolutely filthy! Did you even bother—?! Never mind.”</p>
<p>Hermione waved her wand. The layers of dust disappeared and the curtains opened. George shielded his eyes from the sudden light. </p>
<p>“As for being scared,” Hermione continued, “it's normal these days, isn't it?” George gave a blank expression, causing Hermione to let out an exasperated sigh. “Honestly, George, didn't you bother opening your eyes long enough to read the Daily Prophet? Death Eater attacks are becoming a far-too-frequent occurrence!”</p>
<p>George blinked. Hermione plowed on, “In fact, I think I recognised a Death Eater just outside the shop. Do you understand why I'm here now, George? You haven't been in contact with <em> anyone </em> for <em> months</em>! Your mum sent me to make sure you weren't <em> dead</em>! She said she wouldn't be able to live with herself if two of her sons died!”</p>
<p>George said nothing. But he did bury his face in Fred's jumper. Hermione thought she could hear a muffled sob. Hesitantly, Hermione sat next to George on the bed, the mattress squeaking a bit under the added weight. </p>
<p>“Oh, George,” she whispered, putting her arms around his shaking body, “I am <em> so </em> sorry. I shouldn't have brought it up, that was so terrible of me. I'm sorry. I—I miss him too...” A stray tear slipped down her cheek and she quickly wiped it away. "I am <em> so </em> sorry."</p>
<p>After George had finished crying, there was a few moments of silence, before Hermione broke it. “George, do you feel up to coming to the Burrow? Your family misses you terribly...”</p>
<p>George let out a quiet sigh. “They don't understand how I feel,” he said, in hardly more than a whisper, his voice cracking slightly. </p>
<p>“But you can't honestly expect them to either, can you?” Hermione asked. George gave her a strange look and she continued, “While it's true Fred was their son and brother, they didn't have the same relationship with him that you had. He was your twin. You hadn't left his side since birth. It's natural that you had a different relationship with him. In fact, if they did know how you felt, <em> then </em> I would be confused.</p>
<p>“Now,” Hermione went on, “you can't blame them for not understanding, but they loved Fred too. Maybe not as much as you, but they do. Did you know that Percy blamed himself for the longest time?”</p>
<p>George hadn't known that. He bit his lip and said, “Hermione—”</p>
<p>But Hermione continued, obviously trying her hardest to convince him to go to the Burrow and see his family. “They don't just miss Fred though, they miss <em> you</em>, George. You've been holed up in here for months—have you even gone outside <em> once</em>?”</p>
<p>“Hermione—”</p>
<p>“I hope you haven't been hurting yourself! That includes starvation, drunkenness, cutting—”</p>
<p>“<em>Hermione</em>!”</p>
<p>“What?” Hermione finally stopped her spiel and looked over at George. The redhead was smiling, a very good sign—albeit a very small smile, but smiling all the same. </p>
<p>“I'll go to the Burrow.”</p>
<p>“You—you will?” Hermione obviously hadn't expected to win this easily.</p>
<p>“Yes, I will. But I probably need a shower,” George muttered, scrunching his nose up in disgust. He hadn't freshened up for a long time; he didn't remember exactly when the last time he even stepped foot in another room. </p>
<p>“Oh! Right. Of course. I'll just go back to the Burrow then,” Hermione said, standing up quickly, but George grabbed her hand. </p>
<p>“Please...” George hesitated, a blush rising in his cheeks, but he quickly went on, not giving himself room for embarrassment. “Will you wait for me?”</p>
<p>Hermione was surprised at his request, but said, “Oh! Yes, of course, George. I'll just go wait in the living room, then.”</p>
<p>George nodded, watching the bushy haired girl's retreating figure. He sighed as she closed the door with a soft click. What was wrong with him? Was he honestly going to face his family after months of absolutely zero contact? George tilted his head towards the ceiling, closing his eyes and allowing a few stray tears to escape.</p>
<p>“Oh Fred... What should I do?” he asked quietly with a sigh. </p>
<p>After a few moments, George resigned to the decision of first showering and then assessing how he felt. He opened the door, walking the short distance to the bathroom without checking to see if Hermione was still in the flat. He trusted that she would wait. </p>
<p>George tried not to look in the mirror as he stripped off his clothes. When he looked in the mirror, all he could see was Fred. Not himself. Just Fred. Who even <em> was </em> George Weasley without Fred? It had always been <em> Fred and George</em>. Never <em> George and Fred</em>, or <em> just George</em>, or <em> just Fred</em>. He was... incomplete. </p>
<p>He let out a sigh and stepped under the flow of warm water. </p>
<hr/>
<p>Hermione paced around the living room of George’s flat. She didn’t like being here—the entire apartment felt lifeless and reminded her too much of the one Weasley no longer present. She had never been particularly close to either of the twins, but her closeness to the family as a whole gave her a similar sense of loss. As she tried to keep herself positive, she noticed a picture frame laying underneath the coffee table. Assuming that it had fallen over by mistaken, she gingerly picked it up. </p>
<p>“Oh,” she murmured, covering her mouth sorrowfully. </p>
<p>The glass was shattered and the frame was broken; through the cracks, she could see that it was a photograph of the twins, arms looped around each other’s shoulders, laughing without a care in the world. They were younger here, maybe ten or eleven, with no idea what would come only a few years later. That thought alone brought tears to her eyes again. </p>
<p>“Oh. So you found that, huh?” </p>
<p>George was behind her, drying his hair haphazardly. He tossed the towel aside and crouched next to her, sighing dejectedly. His proximity made her cheeks heat up—she chose to ignore it. He ran his hand over the glass, wistful.</p>
<p>“I threw this across the room after he—” George swallowed, unable to finish his thought. “After the battle,” he supplied instead. “I regret that a bit now. I just—I was so fucking <em> angry</em>.” His hands pushed roughly at his face. “I don’t even know <em> why</em>. It was all just... <em> so much</em>.” </p>
<p>“That’s natural,” Hermione said quietly, still looking at the photograph. “It’s one of the five stages of grief.” When he looked over at her in confusion, she elucidated, “I suppose it was discovered by Muggles. When anyone goes through a substantial loss, they experience five different stages through their grief. It starts with denial and—” She thought back to when they first found out about Fred’s fate; her heart broke again just remembering how George was trying to convince himself it was all a prank. “I think we all experienced that.”</p>
<p>George nodded, harshly wiping his eyes as he shared the same memory. He hadn’t been able to accept that his brother was gone—it had to be some sick joke, it couldn’t be real, <em> it couldn’t be real</em>—and it had taken hours for the harsh reality to set in. </p>
<p>“The next stage is anger,” Hermione continued, “and I think it’s safe to say you’ve experienced that stage as well.” She had reached for his hand, to give him some form of reassurance as he crouched beside her with tears rolling down his face, when she realized his hands were bleeding. “George, what happened?”</p>
<p>He looked down at his fingers. He hadn’t even realized—there were tiny glass shards left in his hand from touching the broken glass frame. Hermione tutted and stood to get some bandages. He watched as she rounded the wall and he could see her rifling through drawers in the kitchen. She finally found some bandages, grinning at him through the Kitchen Pass-Through. </p>
<p>“Here, let’s get you patched up,” she said, whispering a spell to clean his wound. </p>
<p>“What are the rest?” George asked. </p>
<p>“Hmm?” Hermione looked up at him. “The rest?”</p>
<p>“Of the stages,” George said. “Of grief.”</p>
<p>“Oh! Yes,” Hermione said, continuing to tenderly wrap bandages around his hands. “The next stage is bargaining. It’s not always literal bargaining with other people—it’s often bargaining with yourself, thinking of what could have been done differently. It’s a lot of ‘if onlys’ and focusing on what could have been done to prevent the loss.</p>
<p>“Then comes depression.” She looked up at George, with his dark shadows beneath his eyes and the anguish embedded in the pools of blue. “Self-explanatory, I expect.”</p>
<p>“I suppose I’m at that stage now,” he mumbled, moving his gaze down to his wrapped hand. For some reason, the fact that Hermione had been the one to help him was making his stomach churn. Except... a good churn? “What’s the final stage?” he asked, to get his mind off of his nausea. </p>
<p>“Acceptance.”</p>
<p>George blinked. He couldn’t imagine ever being able to <em> accept </em> this. How <em> could </em> he? Fred was <em> gone</em>. Acceptance was the last thing that was ever going to happen. Yet, apparently, it was the next stage of emotion he would be going through. He shook his head; Hermione had to be wrong. Muggles didn’t know <em> shite </em>about how he was feeling. </p>
<p>“Shall we go?” Hermione asked, cautiously putting a hand on George’s shoulder. He was startled out of his thoughts and she quieted her voice delicately. “If you’ve changed your mind, that’s all right.”</p>
<p>“No, this is something I should do,” he said, heaving himself to his feet with a sigh of resignation. He looked at the door apprehensively, feet unwilling to move. “I—I—” He swallowed, feeling himself begin to shake and sweat. “<em>I should</em>...”</p>
<p>“George.” </p>
<p>Hermione stretched out her hand towards him. There was no trace of mockery or exasperation in her face—she was simply there, supporting him. After a beat of silence, which felt like an eternity, he tentatively grasped her hand. </p>
<p>Hermione squeezed it soothingly, giving him a consoling smile. “Let’s go.”</p>
