    <p>The Taste of Blood and Magic: Chapter 1</p>
<p>Regulus Black grinned in his bright boyish manner as he entered the secluded compartment where Severus Snape was leaning his head against the window, gazing out at the passing terrain as the train neared Hogwarts.</p>
<p>He cleared his throat to make the older boy aware of him. Severus snapped his attention to Reg, then with a slight curve of his lips, he relaxed once more.</p>
<p>"Sev, did you hear the news?"</p>
<p>Reg's eyes gleamed with excitement. Severus raised a brow.</p>
<p>"You have a girlfriend now?"</p>
<p>Reg groaned, "Now you sound like Lucius."</p>
<p>Severus smirked,</p>
<p>"Forgive me, what is it you want to tell me Reg?"</p>
<p>The younger boy leaned in towards Severus, keeping his voice to a whisper.</p>
<p>"Hogwarts is getting a transfer student from Beauxbatons!"</p>
<p>"Strange, we've never had a transfer student before... as far as I know."</p>
<p>Reg's grin widened.</p>
<p>"That's not all...she's a vampire! An actual bloodsucking vampire Sev!"</p>
<p>Severus ran a long finger across his lips.</p>
<p>"Well there's already a werewolf on the grounds, why not invite a vampire? If we're lucky she'll kill us all before the end of term."</p>
<p>Reg snorted.</p>
<p>"Come on man, this is insane! Why are they bringing her here?"</p>
<p>"How did you find out about this?"</p>
<p>"I listen. The whole train is talking about it, if you would come out of hiding and come join your housemates you would know. Anyway, her name is Ligeia LeFay -as in a direct relation to Morgan LeFay! You remember the stories right?"</p>
<p>"I may not be a pureblood but have no doubt I've done my reading and know the history of our world."</p>
<p>"Relax Sev, I was just making sure."</p>
<p>"Hmm. Well, who's her father?"</p>
<p>"That's the thing, no one has heard who her father is since she carries her mother's last name. All that's been said is that he's a vampire and she's half. Heard she got kicked out of Beauxbatons for drinking a student's blood!"</p>
<p>"I highly doubt that, or Dumbledore wouldn't bring her here...although he is careless with the werewolf so you may be right."</p>
<p>Reg shrugged.</p>
<p>Just then there was a knock on the side of the compartment. They looked up to see Lily Evans standing there.</p>
<p>"Hey Sev, I wanted to talk to you but if you're busy it can wait."</p>
<p>Severus slightly paled, which was quite a feat for him.</p>
<p>"Um no, not at all...come in."</p>
<p>Reg's sweet smile died away, replaced by cool indifference. He glanced back at Severus, "I've got to go check on Bella and make sure she hasn't hexed any first years, I'll see you later."</p>
<p>He made eye contact with Lily, his gaze weary but he gave a polite nod. She was Sev's friend for some reason, even if Reg didn't think she deserved to be, not with her association with his vile brother... then there was also the matter of her blood status but Reg kept that to himself. He moved past her and left them in the lonely compartment.</p>
<p>Lily sat down next to Severus.</p>
<p>"Sev I just wanted to say I'm sorry we didn't get to spend time together over break like we normally do; I didn't think I'd end up staying so long with Mary and by the time I came back home Mum really wanted some time with me."</p>
<p>Severus' gaze locked on those emerald eyes, glittering with unquestionable kindness. His stomach twisted into knots.</p>
<p>"I understand, I'm glad you enjoyed your break."</p>
<p>"What about you Sev? Were things at home...better this time? I was worried about you. I meant to write while I was at Mary's but it just got away from me. Oh, I feel awful about it."</p>
<p>Severus' blood ran cold. He was not about to get into the gory details of his "break."</p>
<p>"It was fine."</p>
<p>Lily paused for a moment, looking at him carefully.</p>
<p>"I know things have been...well pretty strained between us but I'm still here for you Sev. You know that right? If you want to talk or anything..."</p>
<p>He squirmed uncomfortably.</p>
<p>"Thanks Lily, really though I'm fine."</p>
<p>He didn't want her pity and at the same time he hated the distance that had grown between them. It was a balancing act, open up to her just enough to maintain their friendship but hide enough to keep her from knowing just how dark this world could be. Her spirits were bright and he'd do anything to keep it that way.</p>
<p>There were times he wished he could talk to her about all of it, for once not hold back and repeat his overly rehearsed lines:</p>
<p>that he was fine, that it didn't matter -then change the subject...Perhaps now was as good a time as any, he did trust her completely...but she was busy with her life, radiating in happiness and Severus couldn't be the one to take that away from her, even if that meant she was slipping away.</p>
<p>The Slytherin couldn't bear that thought, he needed to find a way to keep her close to him, but he had no idea how.</p>
<p>"Lily, look the thing is-"</p>
<p>"Lily- there you are, Remus and I have been looking everywhere for you! Prefect meeting, let's go!" Mary waved her hands about frantically, motioning for Lily to get going.</p>
<p>"What? We have a meeting NOW?"</p>
<p>"Yeah and you're late, doesn't look too good on your part."</p>
<p>Lily sighed, "Alright I'll be there in a sec, ok?"</p>
<p>Mary stole a glance at Severus, who met her eyes with a cold stare. She slightly shuddered and walked off with Remus towards the front of the train.</p>
<p>"Sev...I-"</p>
<p>"- have to go."</p>
<p>He finished for her, his flat voice.</p>
<p>"We'll talk more at school, I promise."</p>
<p>She gazed at him imploringly, and he wanted nothing more than to believe her. She moved, as if to hug him but hesitated and dropped her hands into her lap.</p>
<p>"Goodbye for now Sev."</p>
<p>"Goodbye Lily."</p>
<p>For some reason when those words left his mouth he was filled with a dull ache. She got up, smiled at him and then she was gone, just as quickly as she'd come. He missed her. Their friendship which was nearing a decade, held the best moments of his life, right up there with leaving home to go to Hogwarts...even if things hadn't turned out the way he'd hoped.</p>
<p>Severus turned his attention back to the window and pressed his forehead to the glass. Hopefully the vampire would kill all the Gryffindors, besides Lily. Then she could come back to him and not feel ashamed about being around him.</p>
<p>He scoffed at the ridiculous fantasy.</p>
<p>…..</p>
<p>The Great Hall was buzzing with excitement. Reg waved and walked over to him, accompanied by Narcissa and Bellatrix.</p>
<p>"Sev! So good to see you!" Narcissa greeted warmly. He peered at the blonde from behind his curtains of dark hair and couldn't hide the smirk that cracked his mask of solemnity. It still came as a shock to him that the seemingly cold Black sister had a sweet disposition, to her own housemates anyway.</p>
<p>"Hey Narcissa."</p>
<p>She rolled her eyes playfully, "How many time do I have to tell you to call me Cissy, like everyone else?"</p>
<p>"I don't do nicknames."</p>
<p>"Well we do!"</p>
<p>"I've noticed."</p>
<p>She huffed in false offense.</p>
<p>Bellatrix sighed,</p>
<p>"C'mon Cissy, you know he only wants the mudblood to use pet names." She laughed nastily.</p>
<p>Narcissa shot Severus an apologetic look.</p>
<p>He opened his mouth to tell Bellatrix exactly what he thought when Narcissa cut him off.</p>
<p>"Bella don't use that word, it's trashy."</p>
<p>She growled at the blonde before shrugging it off.</p>
<p>"Fine…"</p>
<p>Severus didn't look away from her but spoke to Reg from the corner of his mouth,</p>
<p>"How you deal with her, is simply mind-boggling."</p>
<p>Bellatrix stuck out her tongue at him.</p>
<p>He sneered.</p>
<p>Reg sat down next to him.</p>
<p>"One word. Firewhisky."</p>
<p>Bellatrix reached over and scruffed Reg's hair.</p>
<p>"You're just an ittle baby, so don't talk like that or I'll have to ground you."</p>
<p>Reg just laughed.</p>
<p>"You really are such a-"</p>
<p>"Guys hush! Lucius is right over there…"</p>
<p>Narcissa positively beamed at the prefect with the silver-white hair. Severus observed the way her demeanor changed as she looked at him with longing, it was so painfully obvious that she was infatuated with the guy. He hoped he wasn't so apparent when he was staring at Lily, but according to Bellatrix he couldn't be far off. He silently cursed himself.</p>
<p>Bellatrix licked her lips seductively, "Well Cissy, let's go sit with him!"</p>
<p>"No, Bella I couldn't!"</p>
<p>"I could though! So you better come stop meee."</p>
<p>Her voice rang out in that irritating singsongy way of hers and she spun around before strutting off towards Lucius.</p>
<p>Narcissa sighed and made her way delicately after her sister.</p>
<p>Reg shook his head.</p>
<p>"You are so lucky Sev."</p>
<p>Severus snorted, "In what way?"</p>
<p>"You don't have family here to bother you- yeah it's great on the outside but you're much better off on your own than being related to that."</p>
<p>"I don't know, Narcissa seems pleasant enough."</p>
<p>"You know who I'm talking about."</p>
<p>"Clearly."</p>
<p>Reg smirked.</p>
<p>A group of Slytherin girls looked over at them and giggled. One of the girls waved at him in greeting. Reg ran his hand through his thick, dark waves nervously.</p>
<p>Severus gave him a stern look.</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Go join your friends before they faint."</p>
<p>"You're my friend Sev."</p>
<p>"...unlike them, I assure you I won't faint in your absence."</p>
<p>Reg cracked his knuckles. "Nah."</p>
<p>Severus regarded him for a moment.</p>
<p>"Is a member of the Black household...feeling, dare I say, shy?"</p>
<p>Reg dropped his gaze.</p>
<p>"Of course not...well maybe somewhat, I'm not like Sirius you know."</p>
<p>"Thank Merlin for that."</p>
<p>The girls looked over at him again and then quickly away once more.</p>
<p>"Go on Reg."</p>
<p>Reg flashed a brilliant smile at the girls, blushing slightly. He was so young and unlike Sirius he didn't have the arrogance his older brother sauntered around with. He was excited but unaccustomed to getting this sort of attention. This year he'd finally started looking older, he had grown tall over the summer and had put on some muscle breaking past his lanky stage at last, something Severus seemed eternally unable to do.</p>
<p>Regulus' bright eyes gleamed with innocence as he hesitated to approach the girls.</p>
<p>Severus wondered what it was like, having that youthful energy, so filled with ideals you were ready to burst. He was certain he had never experienced anything close to that.</p>
<p>"Alright Sev, I'll catch you in the common room later.</p>
<p>Severus gave a curt nod, retrieved his copy of "Advanced Potions" and began reading, it was never too early to get a head start in the semester.</p>
<p>It only took a moment to immerse himself in the material they would be learning this week. Severus was thankful for the moment of peace as his eyes ran greedily over the text.</p>
<p>He was so engrossed in his reading that he slightly jumped when Dumbledore's booming voice called for the students' attention.</p>
<p>He gazed up and his eyes fell on the girl standing by the Headmaster's side. She had a slight frame and skin as pale as the ghosts floating around the Great Hall, Raven tresses tumbled down her back almost as if she were wearing a cape. There was an eerie quiet as the school listened intently to Dumbledore.</p>
<p>"We have a very special new student who is joining our home here in Hogwarts from Beauxbatons! Let's give a warm welcome to Ligeia Lefay."</p>
<p>Reluctant clapping rang through the Great Hall as the faces of the students were filled with apprehension. If the new student had wanted to keep her vampire bloodline a secret she wouldn't get the chance. For a moment Severus almost felt bad for the girl, who appeared to be around his age, standing there, staring daggers at her own shoes. The first years standing behind her trembled, pushed up against the back wall as far away from her as possible while they awaited their housing ceremony.</p>
<p>"Professor McGonagall, please bring the sorting hat forward."</p>
<p>McGonagall smiled at Ligeia with compassion as she spoke quietly to her, no doubt explaining what was about to happen.</p>
<p>The girl tensed.</p>
<p>Ligeia closed her eyes, she just wished for this to be over. She didn't want to be there, halfway across the world from her mother after what had happened. She despised the thought of her mom being alone while Ligeia was trapped here. Swallowing back her sudden urge to cry, she vowed someday she would make them pay. For now she was stuck at this school she'd fought fang and nail not to come to.</p>
<p>She flinched when Professor McGonagall placed the hat on her head, hating nothing more than the sort of magic that peers into your private thoughts. The sooner this was over, the sooner she could crawl into whatever bed they gave her and hide in the shadows until she could plan an escape.</p>
<p>Well aren't you...something extraordinary?</p>
<p>She stilled as the hat's voice rang through her mind. She could feel it slipping into her thoughts, tanging into her subconscious.</p>
<p>You have a passion for learning and creating, Ravenclaw would suit you well...ah but there's something else too...an unquenchable thirst for power...interesting…</p>
<p>I don't care where you put me, just please pick somewhere so I can leave.</p>
<p>The hat...or whatever strange magic this was, ran its tendrils through the waves of her mind, raking through each thought.</p>
<p>She let out a quiet hiss.</p>
<p>Severus watched the girl intently along with the rest of the school, her face twisted as if being sorted was causing her physical pain.</p>
<p>The Hat bellowed at last,</p>
<p>"Slytherin!"</p>
<p>No one clapped this time, not even the Slytherin table who had become living statues as they watched this half-blooded monster approach their table. Ligeia could smell their fear, thick and heavy in the air. It was a scent she was used to, the mix of terror and sometimes desire that she elicited in those who were near.</p>
<p>Weak, disgusting beings.</p>
<p>Her eyes scanned the table before she made her way to the furthest most secluded end, which happened to be where Severus was seated.</p>
<p>She sat down silently beside him and raising her head to meet the countless eyes of her housemates, she peeled back her lips and flashed her fangs. The students quickly looked away and resumed talking amongst each other while the first years were sorted.</p>
<p>Severus felt the smirk on his lips.</p>
<p>"What's so amusing?"</p>
<p>His brow knitted, her attention was now on him.</p>
<p>He peered through the curtains of his hair to meet her eyes and narrowed his gaze as he took in the sight of her up close.</p>
<p>Ligeia's eyes were as dark as his, only there was a scarlet tint to hers. Her full lips were shockingly red, which was no trick of makeup, her lips were bloodstained ...but in her strange inhuman way, she was striking.</p>
<p>"You."</p>
<p>"Excuse me?"</p>
<p>"You were amusing.</p>
<p>Ligeia glared, "How so?"</p>
<p>"The way you purposely play on people's fears."</p>
<p>"I wasn't playing."</p>
<p>Her voice held a quiet threat.</p>
<p>He gazed at her a moment longer, then returned his attention to his book once more. She was so silent that he almost managed to forget about her existence until she murmured,</p>
<p>"What are you reading?"</p>
<p>Severus Snape pushed the book towards her.</p>
<p>"This is what we'll be learning this year in Potions."</p>
<p>She took the book he offered and skimmed through it. It was strange having this unusual girl handle his books as if she were just any witch and he, any wizard.</p>
<p>"I hate Potions."</p>
<p>Severus snatched the book from her hands and snapped at her,</p>
<p>"Well not everyone can appreciate the subtle science and exact art of potion-making. I don't expect everyone to really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses…"</p>
<p>His voice trailed off as the vampire licked her teeth and for a moment he wished he had just remained in his usual unresponsive state and ignored her. These new events were throwing him off guard. The existence of vampires was known, but they were so rare that you could go through life never meeting one.</p>
<p>Her threatening glare faded,</p>
<p>"You misunderstand me, I never meant that I didn't appreciate potions, only that it's the subject I struggle with...I'm far more skilled in the dark arts- my mistake, defense against the dark arts, of course."</p>
<p>Severus was certain that she'd meant the Dark Arts but he didn't press. He understood the allure of dark magic and held to the belief that you needed to master dark with light, to obtain ultimate power and knowledge.</p>
<p>He found himself asking,</p>
<p>"What is it you struggle with?"</p>
<p>Ligeia seemed shaken up as if their suddenly casual conversation was completely foreign to her. Severus' thoughts echoed her own. He never bothered to speak with strangers, sticking to his handful of friends-if not preferring his solitude.</p>
<p>"Um...well it's my measurements usually, I'm so terrified I might go overboard that my potions end up lacking necessary quantities yet when I follow the instructions to a T, they're too powerful and end in disaster."</p>
<p>"I would assume that's because your magic differs from that of standard spellbooks, so you're bound to create something stronger than intended. It's an easy fix though, you just have to experiment and practice. Eventually you'll learn by eye and you won't even have to measure."</p>
<p>"You're lying!"</p>
<p>She was smiling at him now, fangs glistening in the light of the floating candles. She must have realized this, for she quickly retracted them and closed her mouth.</p>
<p>Severus was intrigued. He was quiet for a moment.</p>
<p>"I could show you the tricks to mastering a potion."</p>
<p>"How do you know so much about this?"</p>
<p>"Unlike most of the student population, I read. At the same time you might be following the directions too closely, there's always a better way to achieve optimal results than what's given in the text."</p>
<p>She laughed, once again her fangs extended.</p>
<p>Severus eyed her curiously and continued, "Vampires have a greater natural gift with the magic they possess but when unrefined it can cause havoc. It's about learning control when you tap into yourself. I'm sure I could figure out what amendments you'd require."</p>
<p>The pale creature was smiling at him,</p>
<p>"I would like that very much. You know my name, what is yours?"</p>
<p>"Severus Snape."</p>
<p>She held out her deathly pale hand to him and Severus gazed at the almost too long fingers. Then reaching out, he shook her hand.</p>
<p>"You're a fascinating person Severus Snape. Most people wouldn't dare take my hand, I'm sure you've heard the stories flying about this place. The reason they say I was brought here."</p>
<p>"I have, but I don't entertain stories that aren't published."</p>
<p>Ligeia watched him for a moment, as if she was uncertain. She picked up her fork and poked at the peas on her plate, moving them around noncommittally. At last she took a single pea unto her fork and popped it into her mouth. After a few moments she took up another pea. She repeated this process of eating a single pea at a time.</p>
<p>Who eats like that?</p>
<p>Severus didn't know how much longer he could stand it. Something about the singular pea was grating on his last nerve.</p>
<p>"Not Hungry?"</p>
<p>Ligeia glanced at him,</p>
<p>"Not really."</p>
<p>"Well you could at least try our famous pumpkin juice."</p>
<p>She reached for the goblet in front of her and eyed its contents skeptically. She took a sip and immediately grimmanced in disgust.</p>
<p>Severus quietly laughed.</p>
<p>Pushing it away, she reached around her neck for the vial disguised as a decorative amulet and twisted the top off. Raising it to her mouth she kept her gaze locked on his as she sipped from it, darkening her perpetually stained lips with blood.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>A/N Name pronunciations: Ligeia (Li-jee-uh) short i sound as in, "lit" And Regulus' nickname is Reg with a "j" sound, like (Rej).</p>
<p>I've had this idea for years, what would it be like if a Vampire attended Hogwarts? If we got to have an inside to the future Deatheaters and Slytherins of the Muradures area. If you enjoyed chapter one please leave any thoughts or comments. I'm excited to see where this goes.</p>
