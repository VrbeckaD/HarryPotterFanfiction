    <p>Petunia Evans was a girl with a hard heart.</p><p>This didn’t mean that she was mean or malicious, it just meant that she has a difficult time letting people into her Circle. There’s mommy and daddy, who make up her family, then there’s Bruno, their old basset hound who sits at the side, and then her various friends at school, although they don’t come near where her parents rest in her heart.</p><p>But Lily, oh Lily, is at the very center of her chest. Her perfect little sister, (not yet resentful, might not never happen in this life) lives right under her breastbone. Petunia feels the love she shares for her sister in every breath she takes.</p><p>Petunia is not good at sharing her love. Her love comes in the form of what her sister calls ‘nagging’ in the <em>have you brushed your teeth</em> and the <em>get a coat on its too cold outside</em>’s that Petunia gives. She does not give her love freely and you must give her time if you wish to become part of her Circle but once you are, you never leave.</p><p>Another thing Petunia is: possessive. Should anything occur to you or ill will come on winds, she would drown the world to save a friend. Hell hath no fury like Petunia scorned. Once you are in her heart, few leave.</p><p>When Petunia was six years old and Lily four, their mother lost sight of them while they played at a park. It was by no means due to negligence, their mother loved them far too much, but this was a safe neighborhood and her mother naively assumed that as she turned to talk to a friend that her children would not stray far from her sight.</p><p>She was wrong.</p><p>Petunia was following Lily- who although younger had a surprisingly good bit of strength behind her to pull Petunia along- down to a stream she had glimpsed at the top of the playground. Lily wanted to go hunting for frogs to show mommy (Petunia wasn’t going to touch those things but she’ll go to the river to make Lily happy) and was splashing around in the creek, shoes and socks off and sundress hiked around her knees, when a man came walking out of the foliage downstream. He had on a long coat and was wearing a hat that cast his head in shadows and was walking right up to them.</p><p>Petunia felt the hair on the back of her head raise.</p><p>“Hello girls!” The man called out as if he had known them their entire life. “What are two little princesses doing in the river?” His grin, able to be seen underneath his hat was wide, splitting his face in half.</p><p>“We’re looking for frogs!” Exclaims Lily, holding up her prize which is a fat toad with a flower on his head. Petunia eyes the stranger warily and takes a step between the man and Lily. A growling creature twists in her gut and whispers in her ear <em>He is not here to do good, child.</em></p><p>“Ooh, very nice, are you going to show them to mommy?” He asks, looking around the riverbank as if to check for any adults or passerby. Petunia knows that he won’t find any, the river is over a hill and the bank is steep. Mommy cannot see them here.</p><p>“Oh yeah!” Lily replies, oblivious to Petunia’s sharp look as she steps towards the man in the coat. “She’s in the park right now but we’re gonna show her when we get back! And I’m gonna show Daddy when we go home!”</p><p>Immediately Petunia feels a shift in the air. What was before a predator sizing up it’s prey has gotten the confirmation that there are no protectors around to help them. The stranger’s eyes shift to Petunia and when their eyes meet, she is met with the whispers she usually only feels by herself.</p><p>
  <em>The man comes to the park every day looking for girls under the age of seven. He looks for ones alone, without parents, and when he finds them he takes them away to do terrible things. Petunia is reminded of the conversation she wasn’t supposed to be overhearing when her mother talked on the phone about ‘kidnappings’ and ‘pedophiles’. When mommy saw her standing in the doorway, she sent her outside to play with Lily, saying “Little girls shouldn’t have to worry about these sorts of things.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Little girls shouldn’t. But the things that Petunia saw in his mind are the things her mother was worried about. The things the man was going to do to them.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Redheads were always his favorite.</em>
</p><p>The man breaks eye contact, unaware that he has shown Petunia all she needs to know. She needs to get Lily away now. “Yeah,” she begins, thanking God her voice didn’t crack, “My mom’s waiting for us so we have to go now, c’mon Lily.” Grabbing her sister’s hand, Petunia pushes Lily behind her to start walking. She doesn’t want to put her back to this man.</p><p>“Aww, girls don’t leave so quick,” the man cajoles, taking another few steps toward them. If he comes any closer he’ll be in arms reach. “I’m sure you don’t have to leave just yet, why not stay a while?”</p><p>But Petunia knows that if they stay they won’t leave. Lily, brows creased in confusion, seems to<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>have caught on to the atmosphere and isn’t so friendly when she says “I don’t know, if Pet says we have to leave I think we do.” Petunia is still walking backwards, eyes trained on the man as she shoves Lily up the bank.</p><p>“No, no,” the man says, shaking his head. “No you won’t!” And he <em>lunges.</em></p><p>“LILY RUN!” Petunia screams as she gives her sister a hard shove to send her running. To her credit, Lily is able to get up the steep bank but a four year old cannot run fast. The man grabs Petunia, hand around her mouth and she knows <em>If he can’t have the redhead, he’ll settle for the blond.</em></p><p>Petunia takes one moment to wrench herself out of his mind, and <em>bites.</em></p><p>Hot blood spurts into her mouth as the man howls and drops her. Landing harshly on the rocky riverbank, Petunia scrambles to run, uncaring of her ripped and dirtied stockings as she finally gets to her feet. She can feel the blood running down her chin as she is yanked back down by a hand around her ankle. A bruise is already going to form, she knows, as the man furiously tries to pull her towards him. Petunia makes eye contact again, and this time <em>squeezes.</em></p><p>She sees into the man’s mind, how he’s done this to other girls (bad<em> bad</em> things, things she’s not supposed to know about) and how he’ll keep doing it until he dies. Petunia’s scared and hurt and in her fury for her sister and terror for herself, she rips and tears until the man is no more.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Opening her eyes, she sees the man writhing on the ground speaking nonsense. His hand is no longer around her ankle, and her mother screams as she makes her way back to the park. Later, on the news, a story is covered about a pedophile who was arrested but who had seemed to have gone mad. Police could not tell what was wrong with him.</p><p>And Petunia, safe in bed with her sister curled in her embrace, swears that nobody, <em>nobody, </em>would hurt her sister, gods or monsters be damned.</p>
