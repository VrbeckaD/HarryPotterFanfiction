    <p>Hermione couldn’t believe it. It was her last year at Hogwarts. After the war had put her magical education on halt she hadn’t been sure if she’d be allowed to return. But here she was with Headmistress Mcgonagall’s letter in her hands and a smile on her face. Hermione Granger was going back to Hogwarts.However, before she could summon her quill and parchment to write to Harry and Ron, another owl dropped a letter in her hands also addressed to be from the Headmistress. Opening the letter it read…</p>
<p>Miss Hermione Granger,</p>
<p>Due to damages caused to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry there is unfortunately no room to house both our rather substantial first year class and our returning eighth year class. Therefore, all eighth year students must provide their own housing. Thankfully, I have taken the measures to secure the appropriate amount of flats needed at Tyranvof’s Housing. All that is required of you and your fellow classmates is you decide whom you’d like to bunk with as well as a slight monthly fee. A personal request of mine is that everyone should bunk with someone from a different house but I understand if that request is unable to be provided. After the first month of August you and your flatmate will have to start splitting rent which will be 3 Galleons a month from each of you. If you require monetary assistance please owl me and I will provide relief funding. </p>
<p>Sincerely, <br/>Headmistress Minerva Mcgonagall <br/>Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Placing the letter on the desk nearby her, Hermione tried to remember the establishment her favorite professor had mentioned. After racking her brain for several minutes, she decided that it must have been one of the new additions intended to bring life back into Hogsmeade. Wanting to see the new location for herself, she shoved a few essentials into her bag and apparated to Hogsmede. She found the building she was looking for almost immediately but it was already swarmed by her fellow eighth years. Although she could tell everyone was on high alert they all seemed to be enjoying themselves and standing around in a circle. Curious as to what was happening, she walked up to the circle and wiggled her way to the center where she found a list. A flatmate list. Her eyes scanned the list as quickly as possible and she took a deep breath. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Flatmates:</p>
<p>Davis &amp; Bullstrode</p>
<p>Parvati &amp; Bones</p>
<p>Weasel &amp; Potter</p>
<p>Nott &amp; Brown<br/>Parkison &amp; Zabini</p>
<p>Finnegan &amp; Thomas</p>
<p>Fletchley &amp; Boot</p>
<p>Greengrass &amp; Padma</p>
<p>Macmillan &amp; Malfoy</p>
<p>Abbot &amp;</p>
<p>Longbottom &amp; </p>
<p> </p>
<p>     Hermione realised that she was going to have to room with either Hannah or Neville and she hated the idea of any two people of the opposite gender sharing a flat. It simply shouldn’t be permissible at a school or maybe it wasn’t and they’d just ignored the rules. <br/>    She shoved the paper back into the hands of the same person she’d snattched it from before inquiring, “Who put Co-Ed flatmates on here? I don’t think Headmistress Mcgonagall would approve of that.”</p>
<p>       She looked up waiting for an answer from anyone in the group but as soon as her gaze left the ground her eyes wandered up into Silver ones and her blood ran cold. <br/>        Glancing down at the paper in his hands she groaned, “This was all your idea wasn’t it.” </p>
<p>   Malfoy looked as if he were going to sneer at her but it quickly turned into a smirk, “Something the matter Granger? I assure you we’re breaking no rules. Ask Mcgonagall. It’s already been cleared. So it looks like you have a choice to make. Either you can snuggle up with Snake Slayer over here or you can braid hair. So, which one will it be?”</p>
<p>     Hermione felt her face heat up as the eighth years around her focused on their conversation. There was almost no way she could get out of this situation without making a fool of herself. She took a second to calm down and regain her posture before answering.</p>
<p>      “Well, considering Headmistress Mcgonagall insisted on house integration in the flats I sup<br/>pose I’ll room with Hannah. I would hate to let the headmistress down. I’d also be interested in seeing the letter saying that Co-Ed flats are approved. I’d hate to have to let Mcgonagall know of any indiscretions. And if there’s any problem with any of that information I’d like you to relay any comments, questions, or concerns through owl but as I am a very busy woman it may take me two to ten business days to respond so I wouldn’t worry your walnut brain over it,” Hermione quipped with a smug smile on her face before walking out of the crowd and into Tyranvof’s establishment.</p>
<p>          Hermione strolled inside and quickly found the front desk so she could get the key to her flat. Behind the desk was a short stocky man with Black rugged hair, dark blue eyes, and a frown so downturned it looked as if the man had a snout. Hermione looked him once over before deciding to introduce herself. </p>
<p>    “Hello sir, you must be Tyranvof,” she said holding out her hand so he could shake it, “My name’s Hermione Granger.”</p>
<p>     When the man heard her name he recoiled and started snarling at her as if she had threatened him with her wand. His teeth were bared and his wand was out, “Voldemort may not have won the war but I still refuse to house your kind in my establishment. I would advise a mudblood such as yourself leave now. You’ve already sullied my carpets with your disgraceful presence as it is. Filthy mudblood thinking you can walk into my place of business and do as you please.” </p>
<p>     Hermione took a few steps back quite confused by the whole interaction. Firstly, she wasn’t sure that he really was a wizard. And secondly, why would Mcgonagall send her eighth year students to room in a prejudice environment? However, before she had a chance to draw her wand and talk some nonsense into the odd man she heard a voice behind her.</p>
<p>    “Tyranvof, I suggest you keep your disgraceful values to yourself. You already agreed to house her here and being the brightest witch of her age she’s more than capable of hexing you but I would do so much worse to you and you know I’m as good as my word. So this is the only time I will ask that you stop harassing Granger and give her the room key she requires.” The voice sounded unstable and angry but Hermione wasn’t unsure why considering whom she knew it belonged to. </p>
<p>     “Yes, Mr.Malfoy. I apologise for my behavior. Miss Granger if you require anything I would be happy to assist,” Tyranvof squeaked cautiously sliding Hermione her key card before making up a quick excuse and disappearing behind a locked door.</p>
<p>     Now it was Hermione’s turn to leave. She snagged the keycard from her desk before lowering her head and muttering a quick thank you as she passed Malfoy and then vanished into the stairwell.</p>
