    <p>The boy who lived. I've heard a lot about him. In the papers, on posters, from gossiping witches and wizards... But I had never seen him before this day. I honestly thought he was a big joke. But then there was a day, I would actually meet him in person. He may have been famous for his story, but this, was mine. This was The day... I went to Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry.</p>
<p>The day I received my Hogwarts letter, was a shocking one. My uncle was so enthusiastic about it and couldn't wait for the day I went. He said he met his best mates there. I've only seen them in photos in his old albums. he talked about them a lot and his adventures with them... But Uncle said they went away and never could see them again, he never said why... Anywho, uncle gladly helped me pick out the things I needed in Diagon alley. I wasn't ever allowed to leave the house without protection from My uncle, so I was just excited to get out of the house. He never said why, mind you. He only said "it's for your protection. dangerous people are out there." He always acted like I was wanted for a murder spree or something!</p>
<p>We were in one of the crowded shops of Diagon alley and half-way through shopping as uncle was checking off the list of school supplies that came with my Hogwarts letter. Curious, I spotted two young boys admiring the new nimbus 2001 broomstick through the window of quality broomstick supplies across the street. They were roughly a year older than me. one had wild soot-black hair that looked like he didn't care to brush it this morning. His clothes were loose, heavy and twice the size of his thin frame, obvious hand-me-downs from someone the size of a troll-- or at the least, Santa Claus. The other boy had vibrant red hair as if his whole head was on fire. He had sort of patchwork clothes, as if they were passed down from generations, almost too poor to acquire new ones. The boys interested me. They seemed different. Strange. But sort of.. Friendly. Maybe they could be my first friends?...</p>
<p>"-Alright, we got the robes, the books.. Next should be the cauldrons- ah ah ah!" My Uncle snapped at me when I accidentally pulled my hood back to see more of the curious boys. I jumped, startled by the sudden sound of his voice and quickly pulled my velvet violet hood back down to cover my face. "What did I tell you about putting the hood down??"</p>
<p>"S-sorry uncle, I was just-.." I bowed my head guiltily, looking to the floor. "I'm sorry</p>
<p>Uncle took a deep sigh and smiled kindly as he usually did. He knelt down to my eye level and rested his rough, scarred hands on my shoulders comfortingly. "Amy. Look at me. " I did as told, my eyes watering with tears when I saw his apologetic face. He spoke softly, a kind fatherly voice that always comforted me when i needed it. "I'm sorry for being so difficult on you. I know you are just curious about the things around you..." He wiped off a rogue tear on my cheek with a smile of longing, but his tired eyes showed sadness and regret. "Like your mother. She was a wild one too. Full of life." My eyes widened in surprise as I sniffled and wiped my nose on the back of my arm. He never talked about my parents! This was one of the extremely rare times he mentioned it. But Why now? "But you know why you have to be hidden, remember?"</p>
<p>I nodded, "for my own protection." I repeated the same old mantra in a boring monotone for the millionth time.</p>
<p>Uncle just chuckled a deep, hearty laugh as he squeezed my arms tenderly and gave a quick, affectionate peck on my forehead, "good girl!" my eyes followed the very tall, scarred man's movements as he shot up confidently, spry and energetic like the young man he was, but his eyes always looked so old and wise in comparison. "How about we finish this list, then get some ice cream, hm?"</p>
<p>My smile brightened, "that sounds wonderful, Uncle!" I exclaimed with a sudden little spring in my step, holding onto uncle's hand and picking up the bag filled with my robes and school books with the other as we walked down the bustling wizarding street.</p>
<p><br/>
After we finished the list of school items and finished our desserts, we were just about to leave the alley when we passed a massive crowd of chattering exciteable people (mostly middle-aged witches) flooded through flourish and Blotts to nearly bursting at the seams. Curious, we squeezed our way through the crowd to see what was going on. A big poster hovered in the air, it read:</p>
<p>GILDEROY LOCKHART will be signing copies of his autobiography MAGICAL ME today 12:30 P.m. to 4:30 P.m.</p>
<p>A distressed-looking wizard stood at the door, saying, "Calmly, please, ladies .... Don't push, there ... mind the books, now . . . . "</p>
<p>A long line wound right to the back of the shop, where this Gilderoy Lockhart was signing his books. We managed to sneak to the front of the line to get a better view. I noticed that black haired boy and redhead boy I saw earlier was with his entire flaming red haired family standing a few feet across from me.</p>
<p>Gilderoy Lockhart slowly stepped into view, seated at a table surrounded by large pictures of his own face, all winking and flashing dazzlingly white teeth at the crowd. The real Lockhart was wearing robes of forget-me-not blue that exactly matched his eyes; his pointed wizard's hat was set at a jaunty stylish angle on his wavy hair.</p>
<p>A short, irritable-looking man was dancing around taking photographs with a large black camera that emitted puffs of purple smoke with every blinding flash.</p>
<p>ã€€"Out of the way, there," he snarled at The young redhead boy, stomping on his foot as he moved back to get a better shot. "This is for the Daily Prophet -"</p>
<p>The boy mumbled something under his breath as he rubbed his foot where the photographer had stepped on it. Gilderoy Lockhart obviously heard him. He looked up. He saw The young redhead, and then he saw The black haired boy. He stared, Then he leapt to his feet and positively shouted, "It can't be Harry Potter!?"</p>
<p>The crowd parted suddenly, whispering excitedly; Lockhart jumped forward, then seized this boy- er, -Harry's arm, and pulled him to the front. The crowd burst into applause. Harry's face turned a nice shade of tomato red as Lockhart shook his hand for the photographer, who was clicking away madly, wafting the thick smoke over the Vibrant redheads' family, and our direction. I coughed in my fist from the thick smoke.</p>
<p>Once the smoke cleared enough to see, The black haired, glasses wearing boy tried to sidle back over to the family, but Lockhart threw an arm around his shoulders and clamped him tightly to his side.</p>
<p>"Ladies and gentlemen," he said loudly, waving for quiet. "What an extraordinary moment this is! The perfect moment for me to make a little announcement I've been sitting on for some time!</p>
<p>"When young Harry here stepped into Flourish and Blotts today, he only wanted to buy my autobiography -which I shall be happy to present him now, free of charge-" The crowd applauded again. "He had no idea," Lockhart continued, giving Harry a little shake that made his glasses slip to the end of his nose, "that he would shortly be getting much, much more than my book, Magical Me. He and his schoolmates will, in fact, be getting the real magical me. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, I have great pleasure and pride in announcing that this September, I will be taking up the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry!"</p>
<p>I giggled under my breath. I felt so bad for Harry right now, as he seemed to be very uncomfortable in the spotlight. And I pitied him. I wouldn't think defeating the dark lord as a baby would feel too great either. Especially since he didn't have any say in being 'special'. I also felt a little bad for myself, since THIS arrogant, vain oaf was going to be my dark arts teacher.</p>
<p>"Come on Amelia," uncle said hurriedly as he tensed his jaw, grabbing my hand as we practically ran for the door. He acted like he saw something that scared him. I opened my mouth to say something but I thought better not to. "We have to go. Now." I caught a glimpse of this tall, hook-nosed, long haired blond man dressed in black with a smug boy standing close by who looked like a short haired miniature of the blond. He must've been the reason why my uncle was so frantic.</p>
<p>~~~</p>
<p>We managed to get back to the leaky cauldron with no trouble. But I was still so confused to why my uncle would act so strangely like that. We stood at the giant fireplace. He was the first to go through with floo powder. Not one of my favorite methods of travel, since one wrong word could take you to somewhere far different than where you wanted to go, but it gets by.</p>
<p>With a flash of green fire, uncle disappeared. I scooped up a handful of the dusty powder and got into the fireplace. I saw those strange families again walking by just as I entered. I shrugged disinterredly, then I said where I wanted to go and threw down the dust. In a flash I was transported back to my home. I shook my head lightly to get rid of the brief dizziness I always feel after traveling by floo powder. Once again, not my favorite method of travel.</p>
<p><br/>
Uncle and I dropped the bags and books and things off into my bedroom in the little corner underneath the dusty window of the small, practically empty bedroom. . I didn't have much, but we got by, and that was enough for me. Auntie was out tonight, so it was just me and my uncle for dinner. Luckily our house elf was good at cooking, cuz Uncle was- let's just say he was cooking challenged.</p>
<p>I took a small bite of my dinner as I sat next to uncle on the wide wooden table. I stirred my plate of food and stared at it dreamily. He seemed to notice. He was pretty good at noticing things out of place.</p>
<p>"It's nothing..." I responded to his inquiry on what was wrong. "It's just.. Why were you so jumpy back in at flourish and Blotts?" I blurted out quickly, my head bowing a bit from snapping impolitely.</p>
<p>He smiled sadly at me, his eyes glittering with that wise compassion and patience he has that could make even the grumpiest animal feel understood and cared for. "Amy, you know there are a lot of bad people in this world," I nodded. "A lot of them don't like... Certain people. You are one of the very special ones, Amelia. And some very untrustworthy people would like to see you, or your family get seriously hurt. Do you understand?"</p>
<p>I nodded slowly, "yes sir.." I replied in a soft tone like the whisper of a mouse.</p>
<p>"Good." He suddenly froze in thought, his face dropping in a frown, "Amelia?" I hummed in response as I took a sip of my pumpkin juice. "What if... What if You didn't go to hogwarts?" He suggested slowly as if he was walking on thin ice.</p>
<p>"Wh-what?!" I nearly spit out my drink. My entire face drained of color. He knew I'd get upset about this..</p>
<p>"Maybe you're not ready. Like I said, it is a dangerous world out there, I think you should take some time here and don't go to hogwarts." My heart dropped like throwing boulders in water.</p>
<p>I jumped out of my seat, "WHAT?! but-but you promised! I've been looking forward to this all year! You can't do this!" I exclaimed loudly, disappointment cracking in my voice as my throat suddenly became dry.</p>
<p>"I know, I know, but what happens if you get hurt, or worse? I won't be there to save you." Uncle spoke in a calm, assuring, soft-spoken voice, trying to calm me down.</p>
<p>"I'm not a baby anymore, uncle! I don't want to be locked in here and barred away like-like... -a princess trapped in a tower! I want to see whats out there! I want to learn about my world, about my 'gift'!" The silverware on the table began to rattle as my anger increased. the lights shuddered once and awhile. "And I want to do it without hiding who I am!" I smacked the table with my palms hard, pushing my chair back at the same time as I ran upstairs with tears leaking from my eyes just as auntie opened the front door and stepped in, looking quite confused to what happened while I continued running into my room and slamming the door loudly behind me.</p>
<p>Uncle sighed deeply as he pinched the bridge of his nose in frustration. He let out a faint chuckle once he saw my aunt step in and set her jacket on the dark wooden table, "she's as passionate as her mother." He stated with a subtle proud smirk.</p>
<p>The woman laughed and kissed uncle's forehead, "--and as stubborn and as brave as her father~" she remarked playfully.</p>
<p>Uncle tugged her down onto his lap and held her close with a longing sigh on his breath, "what am I going to do with her? I don't think hogwarts is safe, since you-know-who is back from the dead.." He shook his head regretfully, "if one of his followers find out--"</p>
<p>"-they won't. They don't even know she exists." She wrapped her Arms around his neck, "I say send her to hogwarts. Dumbledore will be able to watch her and make sure she is safe. She'll be fine. She's brave and smart, and she knows what to do if trouble arises. She's stronger than you think she is~" auntie smiled smugly with a knowing look at him. He nodded in defeat, knowing exactly what she meant.</p>
<p>"I know.. She probably gets it from you." He hummed with a hollow chuckle.</p>
<p>Auntie punched his arm playfully with narrow eyes, "she gets it from all of us, ya bloody idiot~!" she giggled along with him. "She'll be fine. I believe In her." She nodded, sureness in her dark eyes.</p>
<p>Uncle took another exasperated sigh of regret and smiled at the woman's eyes, "I should go tell her she can go then." He eased auntie onto the bench next to him and stood with a slight stretch. "Wish me luck, love. if you hear screams, it's probably her. Or me when she gives me one of her death-grip hugs." He joked as he headed upstairs...</p>
