    <p>Fall weather welcomed a nostalgic day, the leaves glinting with hues of honey and gold and the air crisp with the steadily approaching winter. The wind whistled softly through the trees, providing a melodic undertone to the harmonious birdsongs.<br/>

Harry sat staring absentmindedly out of the window of the Gryffindor common room. Everything around him faded as he eventually drifted off to sleep. His head slid down in his palm and he slumped to the side of the sill. However, a sharp rap startled him awake.</p><p>...<br/>

"Huh?"</p><p>The dark haired boy's eyes flew open and he hurriedly wiped them of the remnants of sleep.</p><p>Again, he heard the rap.</p><p>This time, he spun around and came face to face with Ron.</p><p>"Are you okay, mate? It's been a solid 30 minutes of you staring off and then you just sort of fell to the side."</p><p>Harry sleepily smiled. "I—I was just dozing."<br/>
Ron stared at him for a moment, searching his face for any signs of a fib.</p><p>"Okay, I'll believe you. But please don't fall asleep here, you snore like bloody Fluffy."</p><p>Harry's eyes widened in mock offense, and he spluttered, "H-How dare you? Turn to page three hundred and—" He broke off in a fit of laughter and fell off the sill. Ron turned red as he let out a hearty laugh.</p><p>Between fits of coughing afterwards:<br/>
"Oh my—<br/>
gosh Harry if Snape—<br/>
had—<br/>
heard you—"</p><p>
  <em>"If Snape had heard what?"</em>
</p><p>"—Who said that?"<br/>
Ron whirled around, only to discover Hermione.</p><p>"Ah, it's just you 'Mione."</p><p>He shifted his weight and turned to face her.<br/>
"Why hello to you too Ronald... hello, Harry"<br/>
Harry smiled at her and got off the floor. Sensing the sudden tension that had enveloped the room upon those two standing right next to each other, he decided that it was time for him to leave.</p><p>-</p><p>"I think I shall be taking my leave now. I have a nice long evening planned with my duvet."</p><p>"Well, been a good 5 minutes, yeah? See you tomorrow Harry." Ron smiled and waved him away. Hermione did the same.</p><p>"He's probably going to sneak around again, without us-as usual."</p><p>...</p><p>
  <em>"I heard that."</em>

When Harry arrived back in his room, he immediately flopped onto his bed and allowed himself to be enveloped in the embrace of his mattress.</p><p>However, the part about sleeping was only half accurate. He spent the time thinking about his plan of action.</p><p>
  <b>Operation Malfoy.</b>
</p><p>He had no idea how this would pan out.<br/>
Being sworn enemies had a sort of unspoken rule: don't fall for each other, at any point in time.</p><p>By this point, that rule was beyond irrelevant and could not be unbroken.</p><p>Harry had fallen—hard—for the Slytherin Prince.<br/>
It all started from Year One when the arrogant bastard had forced his hand in friendship.</p><p>It had been years since then, and this forced play of hatred was starting to wear thin, and he could see that the other boy, at least—did not hate him.</p><p>However, Harry's feelings had been growing for quite some time, and he felt as though now was the time to finally get it off his chest.</p><p>He sighed heavily, and flipped over onto his stomach.<br/>
Possible plans for speaking to Draco overtook his every thought.</p><p>Every possible outcome and response on Draco's part bombarded him, to the point of a headache.</p><p>...<br/>

</p><p>-<br/>
After 45 minutes of deliberations, the dark haired boy finally came to the conclusion that he would approach Malfoy when he was alone, and hopefully less cold.</p><p>When that would be? During a meal.<br/>
How it would go? Merlin only knows.</p><p> </p>
