    <p>Bright July sunlight shone down on a wide street lined with houses. It was a decidedly Muggle place, in a rather well-off suburb of London, running alongside Regent’s Park. It was in this place unbeknown to any, including the inhabitants, that an event that would change the fates’, not of a world or of anyone of importance, but instead of a group of children was being conceived.</p><p>15 Hanover Terrace, the Atarescu family home looked very much like any one of the rows of large terraced houses that ran along Park Road. The family itself, however, was rather dissimilar from the rest of the people who lived in the fancy estate.</p><p>They were wizards, wizards from a very old Pureblood line, no less. Unlike some British Purebloods, the Atarescu’s where not extraordinarily wealthy, though neither were they extremely poor, nor did they believe in purity of blood, and as such had not fought in the war that had shaken the Wizarding World in the 1970s. Indeed, the Atarescu’s along with several other families, including the closely related Grecueanu’s, had fled from Europe in the 1930s to escape another Dark Lord intent on ruling over Muggles in the name of Wizarding superiority: Gellert Grindelwald.</p><p>Anastase Atarescu looked up from his book with a jerk from where he was sitting on his bed reading. A dark shape had flitted across his window entering his vision in the corner of his eye. </p><p>He was a slender boy, tall for his eleven years, with shaggy black hair that often fell across his face as he peered at whatever strange object or interesting book had caught his eye. Anastase along with his little brothers, Kronid and Liniște, were frequently compared to their mother, Irinel Atarescu, a pale Romanian beauty. While Anastase certainly would have agreed with the comparison, he would have pointed out that it was not quite as ideal as many would think, Irinel may have given her sons her own good looks, but all three often felt that she would rather have had a reminder of her much loved and unfortunately deceased husband, Radoslav, than constantly see male versions of herself.</p><p>The pair of owls that had taken his attention away from the book, each clutched a letter in its talons as it swooped above the London skyline across Regent’s Park. Anastase smiled, he knew what one of the owls was carrying: his Hogwarts letter! He sprang to his feet and raced out of his room.</p><p>‘Mamă, can I see my letter please?’, Anastase called as he ran down the stairs, excitement bubbling through him.</p><p>He came to an abrupt halt in the doorway to the kitchen. Something was wrong, he could tell. A prickling in the air and across his skin, as if his very magic could feel it and was trying to warn him.</p><p>Two letters lay on the table in front of his mother, one was perfectly innocent, the Hogwarts letter as Anastase had rightly guessed, well anticipated and long awaited by its eager recipient. The other, however, was rather less wanted and Irinel stared at the sharp, precise handwriting as if in a trance.</p><p>‘Mămică, what is it? What's happened? Who is that letter from?’ the questions spilt out of Anastase frantically. He could vaguely recognise the writing on the front of the second letter, though where from he couldn’t say.</p><p>Irinel snatched the letter from the table and shook her head.</p><p>‘It is nothing Anastase, just some news from Unchiule Camil’, Irinel sounded breathless. She was frantic and attempting to hide it.</p><p>‘Okay...’, doubt-filled him as he watched her.</p><p>‘Here, puiul meu, your Hogwarts letter’, she held it out for him.</p><p>Anastase frowned as he took it, unconvinced that his mother was telling the truth. But why would she lie? It wasn't as if Unchiule Camil was involved in anything bad, and even if he was Mamă wouldn't be.</p><p align="center">***</p><p>Irinel bit her lip as she watched her son’s retreating back. She looked at the letter in her hand. What to do, what to do? Well, what would keep her children safe, the way she hadn’t been able to keep-? She cut off the thought before it fully formed. It was better not to go there. First, Floo Lăcrămioara and ask if she had also received a letter, after that, go and see…<em>her</em>, see if Camil had been telling the truth. If he was…what could he have done to <em>her</em> after all this time? Irinel had sent <em>her</em> away to keep <em>her</em> safe from Camil, had refused to see <em>her</em> out of fear that it might stir his interest in <em>her</em>, but now it seemed it had done the opposite, leaving <em>her</em> open and vulnerable to Camil’s manipulation. Afterall with the staff unaware that he had been responsible for putting <em>her</em> there, why would they keep <em>her</em> “beloved” Uncle out? Irinel bit her lip and tried not to scream. Fear pounding through her heart as she listened to her son make his way up the stairs. She had to keep him and his brothers safe, it was her duty as a mother. A duty that she had failed at with her firstborn. Even if she had to break a thousand laws to do it, she swore to herself, even if I have to cosset and hide them from the world until they wish to kill me themselves, I will not let them be harmed. Not again, not another child of mine.</p><p align="center">***</p><p>Back in his room, Anastase inspected the letter. As expected it was written on heavy, yellowish parchment paper, Anastase had always wondered how Muggle’s wrote things on their thin paper without puncturing it or having the ink run everywhere.</p><p>His address: Mr V. Atarescu</p><p>                    Second Largest Bedroom on the Second Floor</p><p>                    15 Hanover Terrace</p><p>                    Marylebone</p><p>                    London</p><p>Had been written in emerald green ink. On the back was the Hogwarts crest, stamped in purple wax.</p><p>He carefully opened the envelope and pulled the letter out to read it.</p><p align="center">HOGWARTS SCHOOL <em>of</em> WITCHCRAFT <em>and</em> WIZARDRY</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">Headmaster: Albus Dumbledore</p><p align="center"><em>(Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sorc., Chf.

We await your owl by no later than 31 July.</p><p>Yours sincerely,</p><p>Minerva McGonagall</p><p>Deputy Headmistress</p><p>Anastase blinked wondering what in Merlin's name a Mugwump was, presumably something to do with the International Confederation of Wizards, but still a very strange name. He glanced at the list of books and equipment:</p><p>HOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY</p><p>UNIFORM</p><p>First-year students will require:</p>

He had known that he would need a wand of course, as well as a great deal of other stuff, but getting Mamă out of the house to go to Diagon Alley was not a task he wanted, exciting though it would be to have the opportunity to see people his own age that weren't his brothers or cousins. And as for getting a pet, there were already plenty of owls in the family and the only animal Anastase had ever wanted was a Crup though they had never gotten one, first because <em>she</em> might have hurt <em>herself</em> with it or <em>she</em> might have hurt <strong>it</strong> and then after <em>she</em> had gone, because Mamă had to look after the twins and Anastase had been too little to care for one himself, it was good to hold out hope he reminded himself even if the chance was very, very slim.</p><p>*BANG*</p><p>Anastase gasped, leaping to his feet in shock as the door crashed open.</p><p>‘Have you got it???’</p><p>The excitement radiating from the twins was so strong that it might have been their Hogwarts letter that had come rather than his, Anastase thought with amusement.</p><p>‘Da mai mici, I have. Here it is’, as he spoke he held it out for them, they always liked to know everything, including their older brother’s post.</p><p>Liniște grinned, taking it from him. Kronid leaned on his shoulder to read it.</p><p>After a second Kronid peered up at Anastase in confusion, ‘What's a Mugwump?’ he asked quizzically.</p><p>Anastase burst out laughing, ‘I said the same thing when I saw it’, he explained, ‘It must be something to do with the International Confederation of Wizards, you see’. Anastase pointed to the words following the odd title, ‘They can't be saying that Director Dumbledore is the ICoW, that would be stupid.’</p><p>‘Da, I see’, Kronid nodded happily to the explanation.</p><p>Liniște rolled his eyes at his twin’s idiocy, ‘You're going to have to go to Diagon Alley for all this’, he said nodding at the list, ‘Do you think Mamă will let us come with you?’</p><p>‘No, of course not’, Anastase snorted, ‘She'll probably send you to Unchiule Mircea and Mătușa Lăcrămioara, at least you'll be able to see Decebal and Simu while you're there though.’</p><p>None of them had their cousins for ages, particularly since Decebal now spent most of the year at Hogwarts, he would be going into his third year come September. He would be good company for Anastase as he settled in.</p><p>Liniște huffed in frustration, ‘Why is it that Mamă never goes anywhere? I mean, we don't see anyone except family.’</p><p>‘I don't know Lini, she used to, before Tata died, and before ... her’, Anastase paused. He'd always tried not to think about his mother's oddities, the whole family’s oddities now that he thought about it. After all, before Decebal had gone to Hogwarts he'd only ever really known them, though he and Simu hadn’t been quite as isolated as their cousins, ‘I asked once a long time ago, but she just got angry with me’, Anastase remembered Irinel shouting at him that it was for their own good and to just do as they were told.</p><p>Privately Anastase thought that doing what one was told sometimes was fine but always? No, thinking for yourself was always better, and good luck trying to get the twins to do anything they don’t want to, you might as well argue with a rock, they were that stubborn.</p><p>The brothers fell silent, contemplating their odd relatives.</p><p>Why were they so strange, Anastase wondered, what made them different? Sure, they weren’t native to Britain but Bunica and Bunicul had moved from Romania in 1940! Long before Mamă or any of their parents for that matter, had been born.</p><p>They lived in a fairly normal house, a large London townhouse to be exact -it might not be what most would call standard but it had been bought by his bunicii, unchi de-al doilea, and  mare mătușa almost sixty years ago and as they’d sold most of their possessions to get to Britain in the first place, with the help of magic, and the reasoning that it meant their future family would be able to live in comfort, they had pooled their money together and managed to buy the rather expensive house-, but price aside, seeing as it was surrounded by other terraced homes, you could hardly call it odd. They ate normal food -British even! Though Mamă did sometimes cook Romanian dishes -again not anything unusual for a Romania family, normal clothes – for wizards anyway, Anastase wouldn’t want to go out into the Muggle world wearing robes, it might cause a few strange looks, and everything else, he thought looking around his – normal – room, it had a bed, wardrobe, bookcase, even a clock on the wall. Anastase snorted out loud at his own sarcastic thoughts.</p><p>Liniște was staring at him, ‘What did you snort for?’</p><p>‘I was thinking about how we live so normally – normal house, normal things, we’re not even really rich or anything like some British purebloods, just normal!’ He waved his arms around to encompasses his room, ‘Some people might think we are rich because of the house but obviously they’ve never been in it.’ Despite their grandparents hopes for a new life, neither family had become fabulously wealthy and many of the rooms in the house were unused and unfurnished.</p><p>‘Except most children our age have friends that they go out and meet’, Kronid pointed out, ‘We just sit in our rooms and read or sometimes go and see our cousins That’s not normal.’</p><p>‘But it’s not like we’ve ever thought about that until now is it?’ Anastase said, ‘Until we sat down and started talking, it was just normal as well. Do you think Decebal and Simu noticed when Decebal got his letter too? I mean it’s not just us imagining things?’</p><p>‘Okay,’ Liniște sounded very determined, ‘Here’s what we’ll do: Kronid and me-’</p><p>‘Kronid and I!’</p><p>‘Yes that’ Liniște rolled his eyes again at his brother’s nit-picking, ‘We’ll ask Mamă if we can come with you to Diagon if she says yes then we’re probably imagining things, but if she says no then we’ll ask Decebal and Simu what they think when we see them. Alright?’</p><p>‘And here I thought I was the big brother!’</p><p>You are,’ Liniște snapped, ‘But I’m smarter and we all know it!’</p><p>Anastase huffed but stayed silent. He did know it. Although he’d always loved reading and learning, and even smuggled old books out of the family vault when he was little, all he’d ever done with them was stuff them under his bed – the twins would probably have read them, and understood every word too. Unfortunately, that just made them extremely obnoxious about things when they could outsmart everyone.</p><p>‘Okay, now we have a plan. So, who wants to go ask Mum about going to Diagon?’ Kronid inquired, ‘Because not me.’</p><p>‘Nope, not me either’, Anastase bolted the words out hastily, ‘It was your plan Liniște you ask.’ He certainly wasn’t going to get lumped into doing his little brother’s work.</p><p>Liniște smirked, ‘But you actually need to go to Diagon, so you ask her that and then I’ll ask about us going too.’</p><p>He had a fair point there, Anastase admitted to himself, twins investigation or not he’d have to ask, he might as well please his brothers while he was at it, there was no point having them hold a grudge against him.</p><p>‘Fine, that sounds okay to me’, Anastase’s agreement was slightly tentative, after all, he didn’t want to agree to anything stupid, did he?</p><p>‘Baieți!’</p><p>Their mother’s yell took them by surprise. Kronid let out a yelp, Anastase leapt off the bed and Liniște stumbled backwards and hit his head on Anastase’s bookcase.</p><p>‘Dinner’s ready’.</p><p>They shared embarrassed looks as Irinel, rather than berate them about weird talk of strange family, instead called them down to eat.</p><p>Anastase carefully filed the memory away for future reference, it wasn’t often that you got to see either of the twins of taken aback.</p><p>‘You go on ahead’, Liniște ordered drawing up his dignity as best he could, ‘We don’t want her to think we’ve been up to something, and you’re never late.’</p><p>‘I think you’re taking this far too seriously’, Anastase replied, ‘I’m sure that Mamă wouldn’t think we were up to anything if we did come down together, but fine.’ He held his hands up in surrender as Kronid started to retort at him.</p><p>Anastase left his room and went down the stairs. Entering the kitchen, he saw that his mother looked far more composed than she had when he’d left.</p><p>He paused again, then safe in the knowledge that she didn’t know about his discussion with his brothers asked, ‘Mamă, we’ll have to go to Diagon Alley to get my Hogwarts stuff soon. When can we go?’</p><p>Irinel smiled, ‘It’s so nice to see you excited about this, normally you’re just apathetic. We can go tomorrow if the weather’s good. I’ll get you an ice cream too – if you behave!’ She ruffled his hair as she spoke.</p><p>Anastase dodged her finger’s, ‘Really!’ That was easy. Almost too easy but he wasn’t going to look a gift horse in the mouth. Not when he’d thought that getting Mamă out of the house would be like pulling out teeth, Anastase had learned that particular phrase from a Muggle book and rather liked the grotesque image it formed.</p><p>‘Yes, really but eat your dinner first then we can talk more about what we’ll do. Also, Kronid! Liniște! Dinner’s ready! Come down soon or it’ll be cold! Honestly, what are they doing?’ Irinel rolled her eyes in exasperation at her ever experimenting and inquisitive sons.</p><p>‘Coming Mamă, coming!’</p><p>Anastase couldn’t tell which of the twins had made the breathless yell but they’d done a brilliant job of sounding like they’d just been yanked away from an important problem they were trying to solve rather than sitting on his bed. Although in their minds working out Mamă’s behaviour might qualify as an important problem that needed to be worked out.</p><p>Feet pounded on the stairs as the twins raced down. The door banged open before they flung themselves into their seats.</p><p>Anastase doubled over laughing at them, while Irinel frowned.</p><p>‘No need to break down the house baieți.’</p><p>‘Sorry Mamă’, Kronid squeaked burying himself in his bowl.</p><p>Anastase clicked his tongue at the sight, Kronid had always been the most expressive of the twins, when they were little Mamă used to describe them as “a Head and Heart split in two” until Kronid had proven to be almost as controlled as Liniște though more easily ruffled.</p><p>‘Kronid?’ Irinel’s tone was bemused.</p><p>Kronid blinked at her, ‘Yes, Mamă?’</p><p>‘You do realise that I haven’t served you your soup yet, that bowl is empty’, Irinel looked like she wanted to join Anastase in laughing.</p><p>Kronid’s face flamed red, ‘Uh, of course, Mamă’.</p><p>Liniște glared at him for a minute, before Anastase kicked him under the table. Liniște could, Anastase mused, be a bit insensitive, though that wasn’t to say Kronid couldn’t be either just not quite as much.</p><p>The atmosphere at the table was light as Irinel served food and they chattered about their day.</p><p>‘Anastase got his Hogwarts letter today’, Liniște started, leaning forward to rest his elbows on the table.</p><p>‘Yes, he did’, Irinel eyed her son, hearing the beginning of a request.</p><p>‘So, you need to go shopping for his stuff, don’t you?’ Liniște widened his eyes as he spoke, looking as innocent as he could.</p><p>‘Where is this going Lini? Please just spit it out’, Irinel was starting to sound irritated.</p><p>‘Can Kronid and I come with you?’, Liniște had apparently decided to throw caution to the wind, ‘Please Mamă, we never go anywhere!’</p><p>‘We’ll be really good too. Promise’, Kronid chimed in, his voice wheedling.</p><p>‘No’, Irinel’s tone was one of finality.</p><p>‘Mamă! Please!’ But it wasn’t like either of the twins was known for being reasonable.</p><p>‘No. You’re not coming’, Irinel raised her voice angrily.</p><p>‘Why? What is it that you’re so afraid of? You do realise that we’ll be getting Hogwarts letters ourselves in two years’ time, don’t you?’, Liniște gazed into Irinel’s eyes unblinkingly as he spoke, ‘You’ll have to let us out eventually, why do two years matter so much?’</p><p>‘I am your mother’, Irinel shouted, ‘I will not be questioned like this! You will do as you’re told! You are not coming to Diagon Alley with your brother! As you pointed out you will be going to Hogwarts in two years’ time so just be patient!’ she paused her voice shaking with fury, ‘You will both stay at your aunt and uncle’s house. You can spend some time with your cousins while Anastase and I shop. Now go to your rooms both of you. I can’t look at you another minute’.</p><p>The twins meet each other’s gaze and silently left the room, clearly not chastened in the least and planning to rip apart and analyse every bit of the conversation.</p><p>Anastase tried to creep after them, before freezing half out of his seat at his mother voice.</p><p>‘No, Anastase stay here. Let’s not allow your brothers to spoil your big day’, she fairly snapped at him.</p><p>Anastase sank back into his chair nervously.</p><p>‘Okay Mamă’, he whispered meekly.</p><p>Irinel frowned but tried to recover the happy atmosphere, ‘Now, what do you want to do while we’re out?’ her tone had become light and affectionate, ‘Obviously, we need to go to Gringotts, Ollivanders, and Flourish and Blots but do you want to get some new robes while we're there? Maybe get some different ingredients at the apothecaries so you can do some experiments, I know you love those’.</p><p>Anastase perked up slightly, also trying to pretend nothing had happened, ‘That sounds wonderful, Mamă. We can also get Zgripțor some owl treats, after all, he’s going to be travelling further if I’m at Hogwarts, isn’t he? And didn’t you say that we could get some ice cream too?’</p><p>‘Yes, Anastase if your good we can stop at Florean Fortescue's Ice Cream Parlour’, Irinel smiled, ‘I remember when I was your age and that place seemed like the best in the world, until Hogwarts of course, and then Honeydukes in Hogsmeade if you were Radoslav or Camil. Zgripţor will appreciate some treats too, especially now, because you’re right he’s not used to flying as far as Scotland. If we have time we can even go and see your sister’.</p><p>‘… Really? That’s great’, Anastase stammered.</p><p>Ice cream and his father’s favourite shops were all very well and good, and Zgripţor did deserve some treats, even if he was a grumpy old owl. His sister on the other hand, well obviously not just his but he was the only one of the brothers who actually remembered Luminița. Why did Mamă want to go and see <em>her</em>? Anastase hadn’t seen <em>her</em> since he was four years old. The twins had never seen <em>her</em>, Mamă and Tata had made sure to keep <em>he</em>r away from them. That was why <em>she</em>’d had to go in the end. Tata had died and Mamă couldn’t look after both <em>her</em> and the twins.</p><p>‘Yes, she’s a bit better now. I’m sure she’ll be glad to see us both’, Irinel seemed far too cheerful as she informed him of this, especially as Anastase was pretty sure that no one ever sent her updates on Luminița’s mental state.</p><p>Not to mention that a bit better didn’t mean much. Not when Anastase could remember how bad <em>she</em>’d been. Luminița was only 2 years older than him but <em>she</em> had terrified him when <em>she</em>’d lived at home. He’d been so happy when <em>she</em> was gone. As for being glad to see them – well, after seven years <em>she</em>’d probably been desperate to see anyone – family or otherwise. In fact, considering family were the ones who sent <em>her</em> away <em>she</em> was more likely to hate them.</p><p>‘Yes, I’m sure she be so happy’, Anastase grinned broadly with a hint of despair, ‘I can’t wait to see her’.</p><p>He then yawned widely before blinking sleepily. Please let her think that I’m really tired, he thought, as he lifted his hand to cover his mouth, deliberately relaxing his muscles to appear droopy and limp.</p><p>‘Oh, Anastase! I didn’t realise how late it was. You must be so tired. Better get to bed quickly if you want to be awake tomorrow’, Irinel burbled. Unlike Anastase she clearly believed everything she had said.</p><p>‘Yes, Mamă. I’ll go to bed now’, Anastase repeated her words stiffly before he nearly bolted upstairs.</p><p>Scrambling across the landing and into the bathroom he got ready for bed quicker than he ever had before.</p><p>As expected, he had only just gotten into his bedroom, closed the door and sat down when it opened again, and the twins entered peering inquisitively at him.</p><p>‘What happened?’ Liniște demanded.</p><p>No sooner had he asked than Kronid interrupted, ‘Why did you come up so fast?’</p><p>The twins spoke over each other in their eagerness.</p><p>‘Wait, wait. I’ll explain in a minute’, Anastase sighed as he tried to get a word in edgeways, ‘Anyway, Mamă’s definitely up to something, between trying to keep you two away from everything, the letter from Uncle Camil-’</p><p>‘Wait yourself!’ Kronid exclaimed, ‘What’s this about Uncle Camil?’</p><p>‘Didn’t I tell you? When I went down to get my letter Mamă was sitting at the table looking at a letter from Uncle Camil. She looked…scared, I think. I asked if something was wrong and she said no but I’m sure she was lying’, Anastase explained, ‘Well between that, plus she wants to go and see…her’.</p><p>‘Her, as in <strong>her </strong>her’, Liniște inquired slowly.</p><p>‘Yes, Liniște. That her’, Anastase scrubbed a hand over his face, ‘Our sister. Luminița. I don’t know why she suddenly wants to see her after 7 years, but she does.’</p><p>The twins, having never known their sister, were understandably fascinated by <em>her</em>.<em> She</em> was like a monster under the bed. Someone who wasn’t quite real the way other people were.</p><p>‘Are you actually going to see her?’ Liniște repeated as if asking enough times would change the answer.</p><p>‘Yes, I am’, Anastase’s voice sounded numb to his own ears.</p><p>‘Does she even know we exist?’, Kronid asked, ‘I mean we didn’t know she existed until last year for Moșul’s sake.’</p><p>‘I don’t know, she might not. Even if someone told her, she might not remember. When she lived here, sometimes she didn’t know who I was, and she actually saw me’, Anastase shuddered at the memory, ‘She’s never seen you though. </p><p>Luminița’s mad, confused voice as she grabbed at him, demanding to know who he was and what he wanted with her, his own panic, Mamă pulling them apart, and Tata doing his best to hold the family together. It had been after his death that things had really fallen apart and Luminița had been sent to St Mungo’s.</p><p>‘It’s so weird! All this happening at the same time. It’s like something's happened, something bigger than all of us, something that’s caused all of this’, Liniște said softly.</p><p>‘Yes, it is’, Anastase whispered, ‘But what?’</p><p>The conversation quickly trailed off after that and when they heard Irinel start to make her way up the stairs the twins left hurriedly for their own room.</p><p>Anastase lay awake in bed staring at the ceiling. Liniște was right, something was going on, but what? Why them? Their family? But there was nothing unusual about the Atarescu or the Grecueanu families. They were just two of many Romanian families that had fled their native country in the wake of Gellert Grindelwald’s takeover and never gone back after it was freed. It was a story that had repeated itself many times over in Central and Eastern Europe during and after the Global Wizarding War.</p><p>Unable to sleep he got up and walked over to the windowsill where he’d left his Hogwarts letter. At the end, it had mentioned awaiting his owl, but between the twins barging in on him, the resultant discussion, and then Mamă calling him down to dinner, he hadn’t had time to reply. Retrieving a quill, some ink, and a sheaf of parchment, he sat back down on the bed and composed his letter.</p><p>Dear Professor McGonagall,</p><p>      I have received my Hogwarts letter, and accept my place at the school.</p><p>Yours Sincerely</p><p>Anastase Atarescu</p><p>He read through it, the Hogwarts letter hadn’t been very clear about what exactly they’d wanted in response but a simple acknowledgement that he’d got the letter and that he was going to arrive at the school come next term seemed to cover it.</p><p>Happy with the content, Anastase rolled it up, tied a bit of string around it, and placed it on his bookshelf. He’d give it to Mamă to send off with Zgripțor tomorrow, yet another reason to buy the family owl some treats while they were shopping.</p><p>Having calmed himself down Anastase could now see how stupidly overdramatic and irrational he’d been, in fact, he was quite surprised that Kronid and Liniște, normally so unemotional, had been caught up by fright. It was, he reasoned, simply a side effect of them being excited about the Hogwarts letter and then running away with themselves over another letter, wanting it to be just as interesting as the first, besides maybe Mamă had been upset because something bad had happened to Unchiule Camil, not that he was involved in something bad, and even that was pushing it.</p><p>No, Anastase thought firmly as he flopped back into bed, it was nothing to do with their families. It was plain and simply bad luck that the current generation of grown-ups was more than slightly batty, he decided, besides if it were really that bad then someone would have noticed, wouldn’t they?</p><p>Having successfully reassured himself that he and the twins were seeing things that weren’t there, Anastase rolled over, pulled his pillow over his head and went to sleep.</p>
