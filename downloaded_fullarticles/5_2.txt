    <p>The boy with the untamed black hair locked eyes with the slightly hooked nose and straight haired boy. Just for a moment, James was not present at all. He could only look at the other eleven year old’s boys eyes although he had no idea who he was and for what reason he couldn’t take his eyes off him.</p><p>“Eww… is he staring at you?” A girl popped up next up to the boy that James didn’t know.</p><p>“I think so.” The boy said and he looked quite uncomfortable by the staring. He looked over at the red haired girl that was in his company and totally tried to ignore James.</p><p>“Come on, let’s go look for an empty compartment.” The red haired girl said and she pulled the boy along and James was quickly left behind so he went to look for a compartment as well.</p><p>He didn’t want to go for an empty one though as he didn’t want to sit by himself. He quickly found a compartment with two boys. One was surrounded by snacks and the other one seemed to be permanently stuck with his nose into a book he was holding.</p><p>‘Great, I’ve found the compartment with the weirdo’s.’ James thought to himself before someone bumped up against him from the right.</p><p>James looked down and saw a slightly smaller male with black, slightly curly hair. He was wearing his robes already and they were so neat that James guessed that the boy’s mother might have made sure that he looked his best today.</p><p>“Is this compartment empty?” the boy asked and James shook his head.</p><p>“I’m going in anyway.” the boy said and as James stepped aside the boy went into the compartment and threw himself next to the boy with the book.</p><p>“My name is Sirius Black and you are?” the boy, apparently called Sirius introduced himself.</p><p>“Remus.” The other boy said and he looked up from his book, revealing he had some big scars across his face. “Remus Lupin.” He clarified.</p><p>“Those are some intense scars.” Sirius said and James decided to enter the compartment too and he decided to sit down next to the somewhat chubby boy that was surrounded by the snacks.</p><p>“James Potter.” He started.</p><p>“P-peter…Pettigrew.” the chubbier boy replied.</p><p>“In what house would you like to be?” James asked the boys.</p><p>“Ravenclaw or Gryffindor, I can’t really pick.” Remus said and he had put his book down fully now.</p><p>“I probably will end up in Slytherin, just like the rest of my family.” Sirius sighed.</p><p>“Eww, not that house full of slimy gits right?” James frowned.</p><p>“Maybe I’ll break the tradition and become a Gryffindor.” Sirius said and his voice sounded hopeful.</p><p>James nodded to that and then looked over to Peter who stuttered shyly: “I…I think I-I’ll end up in H-Hufflepuff.”</p><p>“I hope to be in the best house of all of course! Gryffindor.” James said proudly and Remus went back to his book.</p><p>“W-what makes Gryffindor the best?” Peter asked shyly and James gladly provided him with a lengthy lecture on why Gryffindor was the best house in Hogwarts.</p><p>“But Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff are fine. Just Slytherin is bad.” James said and he then looked out of the window. His thoughts drifted off to the boy he had met earlier. The boy with pitch black straight hair, a slightly hooked nose and an overall thin frame. Most eleven year olds looked quite tiny in comparison to kids that were older but Severus was just very skinny and honestly looked a little bit younger if it wasn’t for the serious expression on his face because that one made him look older than he actually was.</p><p>‘He’s so peculiar…’ James thought to himself.</p><p> </p><p>“Sev, what are you reading?” the red headed girl asked, her name was Lily. She and Severus were the best of friends and the school year hadn’t started officially yet as they weren’t sorted just yet.</p><p>“Magical Drafts and Potions.” Severus said.</p><p>“Isn’t that one of the books we were required to buy?” Lily asked and Severus nodded before lowering the book a little so Lily could look with him.</p><p>“It sounds all so complicated…” she muttered.</p><p>“It’s not as complicated as it looks, believe me. This for example is a cure for boils, so when someone jinxes you and gives you pimples, you can use this potion to remove them.” Severus told and he explained to her how the potion was made by simplifying the instructions.</p><p>“Also, you must take the cauldron of the fire before you add the porcupine quills or else the cauldron will melt and create a terrible odour and if it spills and touches your skin, it will cause it to erupt in vicious boils.” Severus warned and Lily looked a bit horrified.</p><p>“Thank you for telling me.” Lily said, glad she didn’t have to find that out the hard way.</p><p>“I wouldn’t want you to go through that.” Severus said kindly and he looked at her for a bit and smiled at her. He really thought of Lily as his best friend, his only friend but that was probably because Severus was terrible at making friends.</p><p>“Hey, Severus explain me again what houses there are?” Lily looked at him.</p><p>“There’s Gryffindor, the house of the brave and daring. They also value nerve and chivalry. The emblem is a lion.” Severus started.</p><p>“Then there’s Hufflepuff, it’s for the hard working, dedicated, patient and loyal people and they also value fair play. Their emblem is a badger. Oh and there colours are yellow and black.” Severus continued.</p><p>“What colours does Gryffindor have?” Lily asked.</p><p>“Red and gold.” Severus said.</p><p>“Now, there’s Ravenclaw. It values intelligence, knowledge and wit. The emblem is the eagle and it’s colours are blue and bronze.” Severus said.</p><p>“That sounds like the house you belong in.” Lily commented.</p><p>“Really?” Severus looked unsure.</p><p>“Yeah but what’s the last house?” Lily asked.</p><p>“The last house is the house my mom used to be in too, it’s called Slytherin. It values ambition, cunning and resourcefulness. It’s emblem is a snake and it’s colours are emerald green and silver.” Severus told.</p><p>“In which house would you like to be, Sev?” Lily then asked as she herself wasn’t sure in which house she belonged but she would like to be in Gryffindor.</p><p>“I’m not sure yet.” Severus admitted. Deep inside he would like to just be in the same house as Lily but he thought that saying such a thing was too cheesy so he didn’t.</p><p>“I would like to be in Gryffindor but I’m not sure if I belong there.” Lily looked unsure. Maybe she belonged more to Hufflepuff but honestly as long as Severus ended up in the same house as her, she didn’t really care in which house she ended up in.</p><p>“You do, Lily.” Severus smiled again and he then put his book away as he could feel the train going slower.</p><p>“We’re almost there.” Severus let Lily know and he was right because soon after the train had stopped and the students were called to leave the train. The new students especially were told to gather on the platform.</p><p>Severus and Lily got out of their compartment and as they stepped off the train and went on the platform, Severus and Lily saw the boy again that had stared so strangely at Severus before.</p><p>“He’s a first year too?” Lily wrinkled her nose.</p><p>“Apparently.” Severus fixed his robes. Comparing his dusty robes to the strange boy’s robes, he noticed that the strange boy’s robes looked brand new and of the finest material out there.</p><p>‘Great, that creep is a rich spoiled brat.’ Severus thought to himself.</p><p>The first years were guided to the lake where they were told to go in groups of four on little boats. Severus looked in panic at Lily, not sure with who they should group up but Lily didn’t seem to have any problems as she quickly found two girls. One looked honestly a little weird as she had a frog sitting on her head and the other girl had long blonde hair and a fringe that almost covered her eyes.</p><p>“This are Alice and Pamela.” Lily introduced the girls. Alice was the girl with the frog and Pamela was the girl with the fringe. Severus nodded and introduced himself to the girls before they went on the little boat. In boat in front of them had the strange staring boy on it and he was accompanied by three other boys. One that looked nervous and a bit chubby, one that had huge scratches in his face and the last boy had wavy black hair and just looking at him made Severus think he was of a pureblood family. The staring boy probably was too but the wavy haired boy seemed to have a different vibe about him. Severus couldn’t quite come up with what different vibe it was.</p><p>As soon they arrived at the castle they were guided up the stairs and a lady that introduced herself as Professor McGonagall, told them more about Hogwarts and about the houses that they would be sorted in but most importantly, she explained the rules and the point system.</p><p>When she paused for a while, James looked at the skinny boy and softly introduced himself. “My name is James Potter.” James said softly.</p><p>“Severus Snape.” Severus said back just as softly and then the group of first years got guided into the great hall. Severus grew nervous. In what house would he be sorted in and would he be in the same house as Lily?</p>
