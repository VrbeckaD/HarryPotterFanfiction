    <p>Luna lovegood knows that Nargles always surrounded those that were destined to love each other. It's one of the first things that she had learned from her mother, along with the fact that Dirigible Plum tea tastes like pickled feet. The radish shaped fruit themselves were delicious when raw, the flavor of your favorite dessert. She could remember biting into a peeled plum, and reveling in childish satisfaction as the sticky juice ran down her chin and cherry pie danced on her tongue.</p><p>------</p><p>Luna Lovegood wakes quietly on a Saturday morning with a teary face and shaky limbs. She wipes the tear tracks away with a practiced hand, and lightly twists and slides out of bed. The charms and spells that swarm her bedpost (shield, silencing, protecting, intruder beware, confundus) rustle as she pushes the thick curtains apart.</p><p>Fully dressed and with damp hair, Luna makes her way down to the common room. She avoids the trick step that makes her feet slippery with grease, and steps on the one that gives her neon green eyebrows. She needs a pick me up after her disturbed and restless sleep. The common room is nearly empty, and the high lofted ceiling creates an unpleasant cold draft that wasn't present in the stairway. The single other occupant is a fourth year, head slumped between piled scrolls and an upended ink bottle. </p><p>Luna idly watches black ink run perilously close to the boy's head, remembering that he had been one of those that had stolen her charms textbook last Thursday and had desecrated the cover. She carefully places the ink bottle right side up, and uses the corner of the student's robe to mop up the spilled ink. Luna presses her thumb into the soaked hem of the robe, and smears a wobbly smiley face onto the boys forehead. Satisfied, she slips out of the doorway into the hallway, turning to pat the ornate door knocker.</p><p>"Have any good riddles for me today Mr. Knocker?"</p><p>The face on the door knocker shook his head sadly. </p><p>"Nothing you haven't already heard." </p><p>Luna hums sympathetically.</p><p>"I'll think of some new ones." She said decisively.</p><p>"But dear, then you'll know them and I'll have to ask someone else!" The doorknocker's face twists into a mock-horrified expression at that last part and Luna giggles, muffling the sound in the fabric of her robe.</p><p>"That would be a shame Mr. Knocker. Perhaps you could ask the rather large troll in that painting over there. He looks like an individual who appreciates word plays." </p><p>Said troll laughs uproariously at that, and proceeds to garble in troll to the knocker. Luna senses the beginning of a conversation that she would greatly enjoy if it were not spoken in troll. Perhaps she could ask the troll to teach her troll later, he seemed to be a very nice being!</p><p>Luna was still smiling to herself, turning off the main hallway and into a dimly lit side corridor when she ran into someone. Quite literally. She landed in the floor with a soft thump, air knocked completely out of her lungs in a wheezed exhale.</p><p>"Are you okay?" Harry Potter's worried face suddenly entered her vision, and she took the offered hand gratefully. Then Luna looked at Harry, really looked at him.</p><p>"It's alway good to see you Harry, but it would be better if it weren't in the middle of the night."</p><p>Harry flushed, a guilty expression playing over his face. </p><p>" I know. Ron and Hermione try to keep me on track, but I've been investigating something. Something important."</p><p>"Hmmm, it must be important if you're up this late." </p><p>Harry puffed up, and Luna readied herself for one of his infamous rants.</p><p>"Malfoy missed a Potions class this week. He's never missed a Potion's class ever. He misses all the classes the day before Samhain, but that's because he goes back to his parent's house. And he usually misses a few days during flu season because he has a weak immune system. He's also been looking a lot more pale lately, and he's got huge eye-bags-!"</p><p>Luna tries not to laugh at Harry's analysis. She hadn't known him for very long compared to his Gryffindor friends, but he was amusingly stubborn and dedicated when he wanted to be. Also the fact that Harry had a soft spot the size of Antartica for Malfoy, even if he would deny it vehemently. She's glad that she had the chance to meet him, really meet him, and she impulsively interrupts Harry's long-winded rant to tell him just that. He blinks at the sudden interruption, reminding Luna of a just woken cat. How cute!-</p><p>"Umm, thanks Luna? I'm glad that I met you too?" Harry backtracks a bit, eyes suddenly wide "Wait, I didn't mean for it to sound like that. I really do appreciate our friendship!" He stops again, and wildly scrubs at his forehead, the crinkled line in his forehead deepening in a clear sign of exhaustion. "I'm sorry, I guess that I'm more tired than I thought..."</p><p>Luna smiles fondly, if a bit worriedly, and without further aplomb slides her hand under Harry's upper arm. She then turns towards the vague direction of the Gryffindor common room, dragged Harry behind her as he flails. </p><p>"Well, it's good that you admit that you have a problem!" Luna starts cheerfully, ignoring Harry's sputters, "Wracklespurts positively surround you, but some sleep should help with that. You should really take better care of your health you know. I have some health potions that you can use, theyâ€™re really quite wonderful."</p><p>She estimates that they're about halfway to their destination when Harry stops trying to politely decline her remedy offers (despite common belief, there is a reason why Luna is in Ravenclaw, and it's not because she doesn't fit into any other house. She's intelligent enough to know her own worth, even if no one else does.) His hands begin to tremble again, and Luna slides her hand down Harry's arm to gently grasp the one closest to her. He stiffens a little bit, and Luna stops and turns to face him, halting their forward progress. She slips her hands into both of his, loose enough for him to pull away if he needed to.</p><p>He didn't move though, aside from a light spasm of his fingers when their hands connected. The lost expression on Harry's face gained a deep level of sadness, and it made him look ten years older. Luna knew that she was probably overstepping her boundaries, but more than anything she wanted to ease the tension in Harry's limbs, if even a little. </p><p>"Is this okay Harry? If you're worried about me slipping you chocolates infused with love potion, please don't be. You're a lovely fellow, but you're not my type." </p><p>"What," he starts weakly, but Luna continues. </p><p>She knows that he's been followed around by more and more girls and boys since the end of last year, when the war's end was still fresh and many bodies just barely buried. She also knows that Harry, despite and maybe perhaps because of the frequent well-wishers and rise in fame that accompanied Voldemort's defeat, Harry has been... Well, Harry and several other have been unable to deal with human contact beyond the occasional backslap or handshake. Even though she wasn't privy to the reasons behind Harry and Ginny's cooling relationship and eventual separation, she knew that Harry's worsening touch aversion somehow influenced the outcome.</p><p>And it's not as though it didn't make sense to her. She knew, even before the war, that the loss of the loved one made intimate touch harder to stomach, left a crawling sensation that wouldn't leave for hours at a time. Luna just hated that Harry was left in such a state, when he had just begun to open up to others. She hated the fact that any of her friends or family had to deal with loss on such a massive scale. But she now had a chance to make at least one person feel better, and she would take that chance. </p><p>"I know that..." She pauses, trying to collect her thoughts, "That it's been hard this year. And i know that it's been hard to trust again. I want you to know it's okay to take time to recover. You don't need to be perfect."</p><p>His mouth opened and closed with no sound escaping, and Luna waited patiently for him to figure out what he wanted to say. She politely ignored the way Harry gripped her hand increasingly hard as seconds passed by. </p><p>"Thanks." The word was barely more than a whisper, but Luna heard perfectly clearly. She grinned at Harry, and then continued to tug them towards the Gryffindor common room. Time for a different topic.</p><p>"So" she started conversationally, "Malfoy."</p><p>With an air of delight, Luna watches Harry flush, balk at flushing and then collapse like a depuffed owl. </p><p>"You're evil Luna, you know that right?" Harry looks utterly resigned towards his lot in life, and Luna giggles.</p><p>"So there IS something there!" Luna starts delightedly, before Harry claps a hand over her mouth. She didn't think that it was possible for a human face to get that red. Then Harry realizes what he's done, and he hurriedly removes his hand.</p><p>"Err, sorry," He says sheepishly, hand reaching up to rub at his scar, "It's just ..."</p><p>"Not what you expected."</p><p>"Yeah. Or really what I wanted," Harry droops even more. They're almost to Gryffindor Tower, and while there's no one around, Harry still instinctively drops his voice. It's as if he expects the slightly mention of a Slytherin will wake all of the Gryffindors and send them as a mob of righteous fury right towards the two insomniacs. Honestly, Gryffindor and Slytherin themselves probably would never have anticipated this level of rivalry.<br/>
Luna returns mentally to the conversation at hand, noticing that Harry is still staring at the floor. She gently tugs at their still interlaced fingers, and smiles gently at Harry's wan face.</p><p>"It quite alright Harry," Luna plows over Harry's soft sound of indignation. She didn't mean to push him this far tonight, had this confrontation planned for a later date, but .... Harry deserved to be happy and if she had to drag him kicking and screaming she would. "Love of that sort is rarely expected or wanted in the beginning, but if it's cultivated... Love can change everything. Be anything and everything if that's what you want. It's the sort of love that my parents had." </p><p>Luna tastes a hint of cherry, and internally shuddered at the ill-timed remnant of her dream. She grinned, ignoring the lingering taste and continues</p><p>"Also, Draco is rather handsome. Not the most pleasant personality, but you two suit each other, especially with your own lovely personality." She then turns to walk down the last few corridors, ignoring Harry's sound of protest. </p><p>She's unbelievably thankful that Harry didn't bring attention to her moment of moroseness. Despite common opinion, Harry was incredibly perceptive and empathetic, and was able to read a room with a higher level of competency than most adults. It might be a good thing that his empathy is not well discussed, Luna thinks as they approach the Fat Lady. It's such a vulnerable trait for someone so immersed in the public's eye, something so easy to exploit and undermine and reduce until nothing but bitterness is left. </p><p>Luna surfaces from her dark thoughts to realize that her and Harry are paused awkwardly in front of the Fat Lady, who looks like a golden egg just fell into her lap. The painting was well known for her pen-chance for gossip, and an eighth year Gryffindor and a seventh year Ravenclaw wandering in the early morning and - Luna looks down to confirm - still loosely holding hands.</p><p>"Well, you know the drill child," The Fat Lady says, glee still dancing in her painted eyes.</p><p>Harry dutifully recited the password, nodding gratefully at Luna's foresight to cover her ears. The door swings open, and a surprised Neville Longbottom stands on the other side.</p><p>Ah. </p><p>Luna hasn't been avoiding Neville per say, but she has been avoiding Neville. There's something light and fluttery in her chest that tries to dig itself out everytime she sees him. If Ginny knew this, something that Luna is well aware of what it means, Ginny would whack her on the head with her Charms textbook and tell Luna just how stupid she was being. As it is, she has a scant second or two to pull herself together enough to not arouse suspicion. She smiles brightly, eyes fixed on the woodwork just behind Neville's head. </p><p>"Hiya Harry," Neville's usually enthusiastic greeting is subdued, and Luna feels a tinge of guilt at that that she resolutely stamps down. She sees him turn slightly, and her gaze is captured by the paleness of freckled cheeks and carefully blank eyes. They're usually such a bright and engaged hazel, with light smile lines that crinkle with every other word. Now they look dull and like mud. She avoids thinking about why this bothers her.</p><p>He clears his mouth, and Luna smiles tightly at him. "Hello Luna."</p><p>"Hello Neville," Harry turned towards her sharply, an eyebrow clearly raised. Luna ignores this, and takes a few seconds to walk backwards (definitely not stumbling) away from the common room entrance.</p><p>"I'll see you later Harry!" She called, feet directing her to somewhere far away from Neville Longbottom and his scruffy beard and kind eyes and-</p><p>Oh bugger.</p>
