</p><p>Hermione eagerly stepped out of the fireplace at Draco’s London flat on Christmas Eve, looking forward to spending the holidays with him. She’d begged off Christmas at the Burrow, telling Harry she wanted to spend the holidays with Draco. She still hadn’t told Ron who the new man in her life was, but he knew there was someone. When she made her way to the kitchen, she was greeted by the unexpected sight of Draco leaning against the counter with a smirk on his face and Blaise Zabini standing shoulder to shoulder with him.</p><p> </p><p>Straightening, Draco made his way over to Hermione and kissed her hello. Her hesitation melted away, and she reciprocated, her tongue meeting his as his hands trailed down to her arse. </p><p> </p><p>“Salazar,” Blaise groaned. “I thought I remembered how hot you were together...”</p><p> </p><p>Hermione smiled against Draco’s lips and broke the kiss, beckoning Blaise closer. She looked up to Draco, silently asking his permission. With his nod of assent, she planted a kiss on Blaise’s lips. </p><p> </p><p>“It’s been so long, Blaise. I thought you would’ve come back before now,” she said.</p><p> </p><p>He shrugged. “I’ve been busy with work, but I didn’t forget about this,” he replied, gesturing between the three of them. “I owled Draco last week to let him know I was coming to England for the holidays. We might have come up with a plan for a bit of Christmas cheer…”</p><p> </p><p>Hermione smacked Draco’s chest. “And you didn’t tell me?!”</p><p> </p><p>Laughing at her reaction, he replied, “I thought it would be better as a surprise for you, <em> pet </em>.”</p><p> </p><p>“Of course, you’re right, it's an excellent Christmas present. I’m very excited to see you again, Blaise,” she said.</p><p> </p><p>Draco put a finger under her chin and turned her face so she met his eyes directly. “Would you be open to going to the Manor for the next two days, Hermione, since my parents are in France? Blaise and I have set a few things up for you if you’re okay with it.”</p><p> </p><p>While the thought of Malfoy Manor no longer made her blood run cold, it still wouldn’t be on her top ten list of potential holiday destinations. However, the Manor held lots of potential for scenes…</p><p> </p><p>“One question,” she began, and Draco gestured for her to continue. “Will we be in the library at all?”</p><p> </p><p>Both men started laughing. “Oh, pet, of course we will. We need to use this golden opportunity to play out a few scenarios, I think.”</p><p> </p><p>“Sounds promising,” she agreed. “I could maybe be persuaded.”</p><p> </p><p>Leaning in to kiss Draco again, she felt his hand tangle in her hair. “Do you happen to have your old Hogwarts uniform at home, Granger?”</p><p> </p><p>Blaise chimed in. “Please, for the love of McGonagall, say yes.”</p><p> </p><p>Hermione laughed. “Oh, I think I can see where this is going. You do realise I’m a professor now, right?”</p><p> </p><p>Blaise leaned close and whispered in her ear. “Oh, but Granger, we’re going to be so good to you. The uniform can be your present to us.”</p><p> </p><p>Rolling her eyes, she headed for the Floo once more. They tried to follow her and she stopped them. “Give me half an hour. I’m sure it doesn’t fit properly anymore, and I’ll have to transfigure it a bit.”</p><p> </p><p>“If the blouse is a bit tight and the skirt a bit short, we certainly won’t mind,” Draco winked, leering at her suggestively.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m going to wrap your gift properly, Malfoy. Don’t rush me,” she stated before making a hasty exit.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Nearly forty-five minutes later, Hermione re-entered Draco’s flat, a long set of Gryffindor robes covering every inch of her, save her high-heeled shoes. When she got there, Zabini’s lips were on Draco’s neck, and Draco’s hand was holding him in place. When their eyes met, Draco looked nervous for a moment until he noticed her parted lips and shallow breathing.</p><p> </p><p>“You couldn’t wait for me?” she pouted.</p><p> </p><p>Draco released Blaise, and they both looked her over from head to toe. “No, princess, we couldn’t. We were talking about what we were going to do to you tonight, and we just—”</p><p> </p><p>Hermione started laughing. “No explanations necessary, Blaise. But now that I’m here, I’d rather like to be included.”</p><p> </p><p>Rising from the couch, they joined her, Draco kissing her lips while Blaise’s tongue licked up her neck.  When his mouth reached her ear, he whispered, “Let’s get you back to the Manor so we can really start the fun, princess.”</p><p> </p><p>She nodded. “Will you both be changing and playing along with me?”</p><p> </p><p>They both grinned. “Of course.”</p><p> </p><p>Draco took Hermione’s hand and tossed a handful of Floo powder into the grate and stated, “Malfoy Manor!”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Hermione had been instructed to kneel on the floor at the foot of the central staircase in Malfoy Manor. She quickly lost track of how long she’d been there, her heart racing in anticipation as she contemplated their plans. If there were enough scenes planned for tonight and tomorrow… Gods, she wouldn’t be able to walk come Boxing Day.</p><p> </p><p>When she heard footsteps on the stairs, it took every ounce of her self-control to keep her eyes cast down on her black robes. She felt Draco’s fingers touch the top of her head; she’d released all the charms she used daily, allowing it to get as wild as it had been during their school days. </p><p> </p><p>“Hermione, look at me,” Draco ordered. </p><p> </p><p>Her breath caught in her throat when she saw him, wearing a white Oxford with his Slytherin tie, his robes opened to reveal the uniform, and his hair styled like it had been in their sixth year. Blaise was dressed similarly and she instantly felt a little guilty for sexualising their school uniforms since she now worked at Hogwarts. Breathing deeply, she reminded herself this was just roleplay, a scene, a bit of fun playing out scenarios they’d never had a chance to explore since their time at school had been cut short by the war. </p><p> </p><p>“Good girl,” he praised. “Let’s talk about this weekend, shall we?”</p><p> </p><p>Hermione nodded obediently. “Yes, Sir.”</p><p> </p><p>“No Sir and pet, I think. We’re going to be roleplaying like we’re at Hogwarts, so we’re just Granger and Malfoy and Zabini,” Draco began.</p><p> </p><p>“So no dominance and submission?” she asked. “You know I need that, Draco.”</p><p> </p><p>With a smirk, he gently caressed her curls before gripping them in his fist. “Do you think I really need you to call me Sir to take control, Hermione?”</p><p><br/>“Draco knows what you need to get there, princess. Trust us,” Blaise added.</p><p> </p><p>Nodding, she agreed. </p><p> </p><p>“Do we want to discuss limits or just adjust as we go?” Draco asked.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione twirled a lock of hair around her finger. “Adjust as we go, I think.”</p><p> </p><p>“Are you ready to begin, Granger?” Draco asked.</p><p> </p><p>Smiling, she said, “Of course, <em> Malfoy. </em>”</p><p> </p><p>She remained kneeling, despite the fact that there were no <em> official </em> power dynamics at play.  Her knees were starting to ache from the cold tile floor as both of them stood directly in front of her.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, look what we’ve got here, Zabini. The resident bushy-haired swot of Gryffindor Tower,” Draco drawled. “What should we do with her first?”</p><p> </p><p>Hermione narrowed her eyes, attempting to get into character. “Malfoy, I thought you’d never want to associate with a filthy little—”</p><p> </p><p>Draco covered her mouth with his hand. “Hard limit, Granger. We will not be using that word, or Death Eater or Voldemort or any of that shite.” He released a shaky breath. ”You know I can’t.”</p><p> </p><p>Hermione flushed with guilt at Draco’s upset expression. She rose to her feet and wrapped her arms around his neck. “I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have said that. I just, I was trying to go back to our Hogwarts years,” she whispered in his ear. “I’m sorry, Draco.”</p><p> </p><p>Pulling back to give him space, Hermione felt Draco grab a fistful of her robes. “Where do you think you’re going, Granger?”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m — Draco, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to upset you.”</p><p> </p><p>With a devilish smirk, he pulled her closer with the fisted robes. “I said — where do you think you’re going? We’re still doing this, Granger. Just keep your mouth in line, or else I’ll have to keep it occupied all night.”</p><p> </p><p>Just like that, he’d recovered and caused her stomach to fill with butterflies, the anticipation coming back full force. He took her bottom lip between his teeth and she stood frozen until he started kissing her hard as one of his hands moved roughly to her breast, palming and squeezing it. </p><p> </p><p>“Blaise,” he said, “come on, Snape’s out of the castle and the potions classroom is just around the corner.”</p><p> </p><p>Draco gripped her hand and Blaise led the way to a potions lab with a cauldron already bubbling away. Hermione’s eyes widened as she inhaled the spiraling steam coming off of the cauldron.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m sure you can identify that from here, Granger, but move closer,” Draco urged. </p><p> </p><p>She stood in front of the cauldron as Blaise and Draco sat on the bench across from her, letting the steam from it invade her senses. She could feel the heat from the low fire and she could smell Draco, his cologne, the saltiness of his sweat when he was thrusting into her, on top of the scent of new parchment and freshly-mown grass from her youth… </p><p> </p><p>“Are you getting hot, Granger?” Blaise asked, shrugging his robes off. “It’s awfully warm in here.”</p><p> </p><p>Hermione breathed in the scent of the potion as she thought for a moment, chancing a glance at the pair of them. “No, I’m fine. It’s actually a bit chilly.”</p><p> </p><p>Draco grinned. “I really think you should take off your robes, Granger. Show us that red and gold.”</p><p> </p><p>“Is that a command?” she teased. “Or a request?”</p><p><br/>“Do it now,” he said, his voice lowering into something much more exciting.</p><p> </p><p>Removing the robes, she slowly revealed her tight white blouse and red and gold necktie. She knew her red bra was visible through the shirt, and the buttons were definitely straining over her breasts. She hadn’t needed to transfigure it at all to get the desired effect.</p><p> </p><p>Their eyes devoured her as she slid the robes further down her arms, her chest thrust forward. She turned and draped the robes over the bench behind her, bending slightly. When she faced them again, she nearly laughed. They had both stood to their full height and were looking at her. She knew the bench obstructed most of her lower half, so they likely hadn’t gotten the full effect yet.</p><p> </p><p>“Can you name this potion for me, Granger?” Draco asked.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s Amortentia, the most powerful love potion in existence,” she answered in her most prim, swotty voice. “It has the distinctive mother of pearl sheen and the steam is rising off of it in spirals.”</p><p> </p><p>“And what does it smell like to you, Granger?” Blaise questioned.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione swallowed. “I don’t think you need to know that, Zabini.”</p><p> </p><p>“Let me guess,” Draco began. “Freshly-mown grass and new parchment and Eau de Weasel?”</p><p> </p><p>Hermione narrowed her eyes at him in an attempt to stay in character while masking her surprise that he remembered. “Right on two counts, but not all three.”</p><p> </p><p>“Does breathing in the love potion arouse you, Granger?” he asked.</p><p> </p><p>She crossed her arms over her chest. “And if it does?”</p><p> </p><p>“Well, then we’d be more than happy to help you,” Blaise said with a smile while Draco sauntered around the table, his eyes dropping down to her legs.</p><p> </p><p>“Fucking hell,” he groaned at the sight of the thigh-high stockings and the skirt that barely brushed the top of them. “I don’t think those stockings are appropriate to wear to class, Granger. I’ve never seen a pair like them in the castle.”</p><p> </p><p>With a smile, she said, “I can assure you, they are. I did check with the Headmistress before I wore them.”</p><p> </p><p>Blaise walked around to the other side, his fingers trapping a bit of cloth between them. “Your skirt definitely isn’t regulation length, though.”</p><p> </p><p>Before she had time to retort, Hermione found her torso pressed down against the workbench, her arse in the air. She wasn’t sure who had put her in this position, but she felt her pussy clench in anticipation.</p><p> </p><p>“Most certainly not,” Draco agreed. “In fact, with those lacy, red knickers you’re wearing, I’ll bet you wanted to tease all of us.”</p><p> </p><p>She felt his hand glide up the back of her thigh, coming to rest on her arse and squeezing it hard. “I did. I wanted someone to see them,” she admitted.</p><p> </p><p>She felt his hand leave and then land on her arse with a hard crack. “Naughty little swot, aren’t you?” Draco asked before slapping the other cheek. “Do you like to be spanked, Granger?”</p><p> </p><p>Blaise’s groin entered her line of sight. She hadn’t even heard him move; her senses were so focused on Draco. Blaise fisted her hair and pulled her head up. “Answer him, Granger.”</p><p> </p><p>Another slap landed and she moaned. “Yes. Gods, yes. Please, harder, Malfoy!”</p><p> </p><p>Obliging, he struck her again while Zabini watched the expression on her face. </p><p> </p><p>“Oh, you beg so sweetly. What would Potter think if he saw you in this state, Granger?” Draco taunted before raining a series of blows over the cheeks of her arse. “Bent over the potions workbench in lacy red knickers getting your tight little arse spanked by me…”</p><p> </p><p>“He’d think you’d used some sort of curse or love potion on me,” she replied, squirming against the table. “Harry wouldn’t ever believe I’d do this on my own, Malfoy.”</p><p> </p><p>“Imagine his surprise when he realized you’d come here with us willingly, that you wanted both Blaise and me,” Draco mused, rubbing and squeezing the reddened flesh. </p><p> </p><p>Blaise unbuckled his belt and looked down at her. “Granger, what would the Chosen One say if he saw you sucking my cock <em> while </em> getting spanked by Draco?”</p><p> </p><p>Draco laughed. “I’m sure this little swot has never seen a cock, Blaise, nevermind sucked one.” Hermione tried to rise from the table. “Oh no, witch. I’m not nearly done with your arse. You need to learn a lesson about wearing such revealing undergarments to class under a short skirt.”</p><p> </p><p>While she and Draco hadn’t experimented much with spanking, the sensations she was feeling from it were driving her mad as she fell deeper into the roleplay. Playing on his jealous streak, she blurted, “I’ve sucked a cock. In fact, I’ve been with two wizards.”</p><p> </p><p>The hardest slap he’d delivered yet landed at her center and she nearly shrieked in a mixture of pleasure and pain, happy her planned slip of the tongue had been rewarded. </p><p> </p><p>“Two?” Draco asked. “Who’s been in your mouth, Granger?”</p><p> </p><p>“Viktor Krum,” she answered, watching the teeth of the zipper part as Blaise unzipped his fly. “And Cormac McLaggen.”</p><p> </p><p>“What do you say, Malfoy? Should we try her out?” Blaise asked, deliberately over-acting to make himself seem like an arse.</p><p> </p><p>As an answer, Draco pushed her further forward so her face hung over the edge of the bench. Hermione obediently opened her mouth, looking up at Blaise through her lashes. Pulling his cock out of his shorts, he rested the tip against her bottom lip before sliding in. Her eyes fluttered shut when his fingers laced through her hair and she swirled her tongue around him. </p><p> </p><p>“Oh, she’s definitely done this before,” he groaned. “She’s… talented. I think she’s studied up on how to please a wizard.  Did you learn this in a book, Granger?”</p><p> </p><p>Hermione moaned around Blaise’s cock in response and felt Draco’s hand start rubbing her over her knickers, his fingers quickly finding her swollen clit. “That doesn’t surprise me in the least,” Draco muttered. “These lovely little knickers are sopping wet. I think I’d be able to slide right into her.”</p><p> </p><p>Hermione released the moan she’d been holding back when Blaise’s grip on her hair tightened. He started to thrust into her mouth slowly, and she eagerly took more of him in. When Draco’s fingers worked their way around the lace and made their way inside of her, stroking and sliding against her inner walls, she purposely clenched around them.</p><p> </p><p>“Naughty little swot,” he repeated before using his other hand to spread her legs wider. “Father Christmas will definitely hear about this behaviour, Granger.”</p><p> </p><p>Draco’s fingers withdrew from her, leaving her unsatisfied. However, she felt his hand wrench at the lace, tearing the knickers off of her. When she was bared to him, he knelt behind her, burying his face in her cunt. She pulled back from Blaise, panting while Draco's tongue attacked her clit.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, Malfoy, yes!” she cried, pressing herself back against his mouth. “Yes, don’t stop. I’m going to come!”</p><p> </p><p>“So soon?” Blaise smirked.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione nodded, meeting Blaise’s eyes before he slipped back into her mouth. “Keep going, Granger. It’s my turn.”</p><p> </p><p>Draco’s tongue worked her perfectly and her body moved with both his and Blaise’s, seeking her own pleasure while desperately trying to satisfy Blaise with her mouth. </p><p> </p><p>When her climax began, she pulled back from Blaise and screamed. Draco didn’t wait for her to recover; he quickly dropped his trousers and slammed into her roughly from behind, his hands tightly gripping her hips.</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck, Granger, you’re still coming,” he growled. “She’s so fucking tight, Blaise.”</p><p> </p><p>Slipping his cock back into her open mouth, Blaise’s hands cupped her cheeks, holding her in place while she was jolted forward by Malfoy’s brutal thrusts. “What about her arse, Draco? Have you—”</p><p> </p><p>“I haven’t,” Draco replied.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione’s eyes opened wide and her cheeks flushed pink. “Do you want Draco to touch you there, Granger? No need to be embarrassed.”</p><p> </p><p>She nodded, silently answering Blaise’s question without taking his cock out of her mouth.</p><p> </p><p>Draco’s movements slowed. “Blaise, let her talk. I need to hear it. Hermione? We’ve not discussed this.” With that, Blaise drew back, his hardened cock falling from between her lips.</p><p> </p><p>“Try it,” she answered, giving her consent. She felt Draco’s fingers replace his prick to gather some of her wetness. The pad of his finger brushed her arsehole and she tensed. </p><p> </p><p>Blaise tilted her face up, caressing her cheeks with his thumbs in an attempt to reassure her. “Try to relax, princess. Don’t make him fight for it.” Hermione took a deep breath. “Draco, start fucking her again. It will help to keep her mind off of it.”</p><p> </p><p>As Draco sunk his cock back in, making shallow thrusts, Blaise muttered a lubrication spell, his palm filling with magical moisture before he extended it to Draco. Hermione tried to not think, but she couldn’t stop — until Blaise slid his cock between her lips. When she started trying to take him down her throat again, while also having her quim filled by Draco, her brain shut off. A few moments later, she felt Draco’s finger slowly glide into her arse, stilling for a moment to allow her time to adjust to the sensation. When he pressed down against the thin barrier to feel his cock as he fucked her slowly, she spasmed. </p><p> </p><p>“Oh, you like that,” he observed, starting to move his finger in tandem with his cock. “You really are so, so bad. Who would’ve thought Potter’s Golden Girl would like having all of her holes filled by Slytherins?”</p><p> </p><p>Hermione swirled her tongue around Blaise’s cock as he began thrusting into her mouth faster than before. “I’m going to come, Granger,” he grunted. “Be a good little swot and swallow it all down. We wouldn’t want to make a mess of this classroom.”</p><p> </p><p>As soon as Blaise’s prick spasmed in her mouth, she took him as deeply as she could, swallowing around him. When he pulled out, she ran her tongue along his shaft before licking her own lips to ensure she got every last drop. “You get an O in oral sex, Granger. I think she deserves a reward, Draco.”</p><p> </p><p>“He’s giving me one already,” Hermione whimpered, feeling her inner muscles tightening around Draco’s cock. “I’m so close.”</p><p> </p><p>Blaise slipped under the bench, his tongue finding her clit, causing Hermione to scream. His tongue ventured a bit further, flicking over the spot where Draco was sliding in and out of her. When Draco let out a groan, she knew Blaise had likely stroked his tongue over his cock. She tried to picture the scene below — Draco sliding in and out of her, Blaise licking and sucking at her clit, occasionally moving back to where she and Draco were joined, Draco’s finger in her arse — and all of it got her incredibly worked up. She didn’t bother to try and ask permission to come; there was no point. It was going to happen regardless. When she screamed, Blaise’s tongue increased its pace, prolonging her climax. </p><p> </p><p>“Oh, Granger, so good,” Draco groaned, thrusting harder and chasing his own pleasure while Blaise continued to use his tongue where he and Hermione were joined. “Your cunt is the best I’ve ever had. So fucking tight.”</p><p> </p><p>Blaise’s voice came up from under the bench. “Turn her around and wrap her legs around your waist, Malfoy. I have an idea.”</p><p> </p><p>Draco pulled out, obeying Blaise’s request, and spun her around, kissing her mouth hard before lifting her onto the bench. Her legs automatically settled into position and he slipped into her again. “I can’t get at your arse this way. Sorry, pet, I know you were enjoying it,” he whispered, pressing a kiss to her lips in apology. “I had no idea you wanted that. I would’ve done it much sooner if you’d told me.”</p><p> </p><p>She couldn’t answer, couldn’t even think as he rolled his hips into her, she was so dazed, having never fully come down from her orgasm. When Draco released a low moan, Hermione’s eyes popped open. “His mouth — oh fuck — my balls. Zabini, you could’ve warned me.”</p><p> </p><p>Draco’s pace increased and Hermione thought of Blaise on his knees, sucking and licking at Draco’s…</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, Gods!” Her voice echoed in the room, and Draco gripped her hips tighter, as a third orgasm ripped through her body. </p><p> </p><p>“The thought of us together turns you on, Granger? What if it was just the two of us, Zabini sucking me off?”</p><p> </p><p>“Do I get to watch?” she asked between panted breaths, making him laugh. Draco’s fingers tightened further, his lips latching onto her neck, and she knew he was on the brink. “He’s going to come, Blaise. Keep doing what you’re doing.”</p><p> </p><p>Less than a minute later, Draco was spent, leaning forward and pressing her into the bench again. She let her head fall back, her hair tumbling over the side. Blaise rejoined them, getting to his feet and pressing himself against Draco’s back.</p><p> </p><p>“Bloody hell. You’re already hard again?” Draco asked.</p><p> </p><p>Blaise laughed. “I am, so either get out of my way or get yourself ready.”</p><p> </p><p>Draco stood up straight and pulled out of his witch, wandlessly extinguishing the flames under the cauldron. Hermione sat up and let her legs drop to the side while Blaise slid his arms around Draco’s waist and began kissing his neck again.</p><p> </p><p>“Get in here, Granger,” Draco said, leaning forward to kiss her again before Zabini cut in with a nip to her lower lip. She could taste herself on his lips as Blaise kissed her, feeling desire reignite within her. </p><p> </p><p>Breathlessly, she asked, “What’s next?”</p>
