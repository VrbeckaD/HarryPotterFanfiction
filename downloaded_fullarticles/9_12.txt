    <p>“JAAAAAAAAMMMEEEESSSSS! IF YOU’RE NOT DOWN HERE FOR BREAKFAST IN THREE MINUTES, I WON’T BE TAKING YOU TO THE PLATFORM,” Ginny Potter threatened as she wafted away a little bit of smoke coming off the bacon, praying the smoke alarm won’t go off and wake her husband early.</p><p>“Mum, do you have to shout so loudly?” Albus – her youngest son - asked as he walked into the kitchen, rubbing the sleep from his eyes. She took the bacon off the hob and crossed the room to him, running a hand through his messy black hair and making a mental note to take him to get it cut.</p><p>“I’m sorry, honey,” she said sincerely, but Albus only shrugged and settled down at the table, letting out a little yawn. Unsurprisingly, it was her only daughter Lily who showed up next, hair a complete mess of slept-on French braids that Harry had done in a rush the night previous.</p><p>“Mum, why does James go back to school before we do?” She asked as she sat down and Ginny put a hot chocolate in front of her.</p><p>“Because James is starting Hogwarts today,” Ginny answered, “remember?”</p><p>“The magic school?”</p><p>“That’s right, and they start earlier than you two because you’re both still in primary school,” she explained, and Lily nodded along but Ginny knew she didn’t really understand.</p><p>“Now that James is moving, can I have his room?” Albus asked, blinking bright green eyes at his mum.</p><p>Ginny smiled. “He’s not going forever, Al,” she said and Albus pouted.</p><p>“Can I have it anyway?”</p><p>“I thought you wanted the attic room when we finished doing it out?” Harry said walking into the kitchen, giving Ginny a kiss on the cheek. Ginny internally sighed, hating that she’d woken up her husband even though he’d been at work late the night before. She was hoping to let him sleep as long as possible.</p><p>“I did-” Albus began but got cut off.</p><p>“DADDY!” Lily called, climbing onto her seat before launching herself at Harry. Albus watched them for a moment before sighing and pouring himself some cereal. Ginny decided to help him with the milk as the bottle was a little heavy for him to hold and pour at the same time.</p><p>James came bursting into the kitchen five minutes later – and nearly three minutes <em>after</em> the time of Ginny’s threat. He came in with a bright smile on his face, his hair a mess of knots and curls, looking unusually like Albus’ but Ginny knew it was much easier to tame.</p><p>“It’s Hogwarts daaaaaaaaaaaayyyyy,” he sung, dancing around the kitchen. He was already dressed in his school uniform, eager to get started. “Who’s ready for me to officially become the first Gryffindor within the children of this family, with only Lily following suit and little Albie over here goes shooting for the snake house?”</p><p>James ruffled Albus hair rather roughly before moving to his shoulder and punching him over and over. Albus stormed out of his seat, scratching the wooden chair along the laminate flooring before screaming, “Go away, James!” at his older brother. James took off in a run out of the kitchen and up the stairs, Albus on his heels. It wasn’t long before the two brothers were involved in a scuffle in the middle of the stairs to which Ginny had to end up using her wand to separate them both.</p><p>“Boys!” she scolded, holding them away from each other with her magical hold. “How many times do we have to tell you no fighting?”</p><p>“Sorry mum,” Albus said first, but James folded his arms.</p><p>“It was just a joke, Al doesn’t need to get so defensive,” he sulked.</p><p>“I don’t want to be in Slytherin!” Albus protested, folding his arms now.</p><p>“And you’re not going to be,” Ginny said, releasing her hold on Albus only and opening her arms to him. Albus immediately fell into them, accepting his mums hug.</p><p>“But what if I am?”</p><p>“What if James is?” At that, James went to protest and Ginny held her hand up to tell him to stop. “Or what if Lily is? Point is, Albus, is that we can’t dwell on the what ifs. This is something you don’t have to worry about yet, but James is going to have to worry about me if he doesn’t stop sulking and apologise this instance,” Ginny finished, her voice turning stern as she glared at James.</p><p>James dropped his stance, taking a huffing deep breath and looked at Albus. “I’m sorry, Al,” he said, sincerely.</p><p>“I hope you end up in Slytherin,” Albus said before turning away and going back into the kitchen. Ginny saw James take another deep breath, his eyes beginning to water as he watches Albus go.</p><p>“Hey, come here,” Ginny said, feeling a little sorry for her eldest son, he was, after all, only a child. James ran down the remainder of the stairs and crashed into her, wrapping his arms around her waist and holding her tight. She would miss him deeply when he’s off at Hogwarts.</p><p>“I don’t want Al to be annoyed with me before I go,” he cried, voice muffled against Ginny’s chest. She rubbed his back and ran a hand through his messy hair, making a mental note to find a hairbrush after he was done with his hug.</p><p>“He won’t be,” Ginny assured. “Albus loves you, he’ll come running to you when we have to leave. Which, is in half an hour, so go get some breakfast,” Ginny encouraged, pushing James towards the kitchen.</p><p>She followed him back in to find Albus and Lily’s heads pressed together as they try to read one of her books for school and James sulking over a plate of breakfast. Harry greets her with a kiss and presses a coffee into her hand. She wrapped her hands around the warm cup, wondering how she’d made it until <em>now </em>until she’d had her first coffee. Harry mumbled something about checking James’ trunk and heading upstairs, leaving Ginny and the three kids to it.</p><p>Ginny took a seat at the table and nudged James’ foot with her own. When he looked up, she sent him a smile which he returned. Next to her, Lily was reading aloud, Albus helping her with the words she couldn’t quite get as much as he could, though his own reading ability wasn’t much older than hers. Ginny smiled to herself as she took a sip of her coffee, feeling an overwhelming love for her three children, the angels sent to her from heaven.</p><p>She could hardly believe James was now eleven and starting Hogwarts. It seemed like only yesterday they were bringing him home from the hospital, wrapped in a little bundle of blankets and sleeping softly. He’d been a quiet baby, rarely crying and sleeping through the night. They were in for a shock when Albus came along and would barely stop for a second. When she got pregnant with Lily she nearly cried, hoping that Lily wouldn’t be as much of a nightmare as Albus had been.</p><p>However, as her children grew, they seemed to have swapped personalities. Quiet James turned into boisterous and loud James, whereas loud Albus grew into quiet and soft Albus. Lily has always been Lily, she wasn’t quite as quiet as James but not as loud as Albus, and she sort of balanced the two brothers out when she came along. She seemed to be the glue that held them together even back then and Ginny knew she would continue her role in that without even knowing it.</p><p>After James had finished eating, Ginny took a comb to his hair and listened to him groaning and moan in pain whilst Lily’s and Albus’ giggles filled the background. Harry returned after checking James’ trunk and pulling it downstairs and into the car ready to go.</p><p>Moments before they had to leave, Albus and Lily now cuddled on the sofa watching some programme that Lily loved but Albus only watched for her, Ginny’s mum turned up to look after them. They were going to take Albus and Lily to the platform, but had decided in the end to take James on his own and let them say goodbye at the house, and Molly was all too happy to step in for some quality time with her grandbabies.</p><p>“Okay, James, time to go,” Harry said, ruffling his hair, getting a protest out of him. James swatted his hand away and jumped up grinning.</p><p>“I’m so excited! I cannot wait for me, Freddie and Louis to all be sorted into Gryffindor and get up to mischief, just like you, Uncle Ron and Aunt Hermione used to do,” James said, bouncing on his feet. James ran out to the car, the rest of the Potters and Molly in tow.</p><p>It was Molly who first tackled James in a hug and wished him the best in his first year. Followed quickly by Lily who jumped on him, wrapping her arms and legs around him in a bone crushing hug.</p><p>“You’ll write to me, won’t you?” Lily asked. “I can write back to you all by myself and I don’t want to stop talking to you because I love you.”</p><p>“Of course I’ll write Lils, every day if you want me too,” James said, kissing the side of her head. “I love you too.”</p><p>Lily jumped down and the two engaged in a ‘secret’ handshake they’d been practising all summer. They then hugged again before Lily stepped back and into the arms of her grandmother. Albus shuffled on his feet slightly, trying to hide his face behind his mess of curls as he looked up at James. The two brothers stared at each other, the fight from this morning clearly still fresh and Albus looking a little conflicted. Finally, though, his love for his brother won and Albus came surging forward, crashing into James and wrapping him up in a big hug.</p><p>“Don’t forget about me,” Albus cried and Ginny thought she saw tears in James’ eyes.</p><p>“You’re my little brother, I could never forget about you,” he assured. They held onto each other for the longest time. Ginny had always loved how close they were, how they always had each other to go to. James was truly a great older brother to both Albus and Lily, even though he liked to tease them a lot. She was really proud of him.</p><p>“I’ll miss you,” Albus said, slowly pulling away.</p><p>“I’ll miss you too,” James smiled at him. “But you can’t have my room.”</p><p>“I wasn’t even going to ask!”</p><p>“That’s a lie,” Lily said, “he already did this morning!”</p><p>“I knew it,” James said, his eyes lighting up. “You little snake.” And even though the comment was a jab at the house James was convinced Albus would end up in, Albus let out a joyous laugh and hugged his brother one last time.</p><p>They eventually parted and James waved them all goodbye before getting in the car. Ginny hugged her other two children before climbing into the passenger seat and letting Harry take them to Kings Cross.</p><p>“I’m excited to start Hogwarts,” James said in the back as he waved goodbye to his siblings. “But I really am going to miss you all a lot.”</p>
