    <p>At the beginning of the summer of 1996, the Malfoy Manor burned. It was the cause of a great deal of whispering - the flames went untamed all through the night, which made people sure that malicious magic was behind the fire. When the fire finally died by itself during the brightening dawn, there wasn’t much left of the manor. What the bravest onlookers found as they dared closer to the ruins of collapsed walls and charred beams were the remains of two bodies, black as coal and barely human in form. As horrified the finders were by what they saw, it didn’t go unnoticed that the bodies lay in front of what had been the great entrance of the manor, side by side, almost like they’d been placed there to be found.</p><p>No arrest had been made by the time the Daily Prophet made the event their front page the following morning. The haunting image that they used to illustrate the story was that of the smoking ruins of the manor against the early morning grey sky and that of young Mr. Malfoy, standing in front of the sight looking like he had not quite understood what had happened.</p><p>The paper had few facts to share and most of the article was spent on speculating about probable explanations. The fact that two strong, capable wizards had not apparated into safety was curious, curious indeed. However, thanks to the questionable standing of the Malfoys in these troubled times, the Daily Prophet reporter who broke the news refrained from pointing fingers at anyone specific. It was a sensitive issue: Lucius Malfoy had only days before been sent home because the Wizengamot had failed to find enough evidence to convict him. This, in turn, had left many people desperate for some justice.</p><p>Harry Potter first saw the paper little past noon when he sat down at the kitchen table to wait for the Order meeting to start. He’d been too busy with unpacking his things in his new room at the Grimmauld Place that he hadn’t found the time to even glance at the paper earlier. The happiness he’d felt about finally getting to live with his godfather was replaced by a feeling that he had a hard time understanding. He’d never <em>liked</em> the Malfoys, but the picture of Draco Malfoy turning his head just slightly so that his unseeing eyes could be seen for a brief moment left Harry feeling sad and angry and confused about why he’d felt any of it in the first place.</p><p>“Harry,” Hermione said with a soft voice. She’d clearly noticed that Harry had been upset by the story and approuched him carefully. “Are you alright?” she continued as she sat down in the chair next to him.</p><p>“Yeah. Of course,” Harry replied without thinking about it. He folded the paper so that the picture disappeared and only the headline “<em>Malfoy Manor Burned – Two Dead</em>” could be seen. “It’s just- “ He shrugged, not really knowing what he wanted to say. This year had already been exhausting enough and he’d thought the worst was behind them. Now it seemed like there would be no rest for them even during the summer.</p><p>“Awful”, Hermione replied for him. She moved the Prophet closer to herself but didn’t, thankfully, unfold it again. “Who do you think did it?”</p><p>Harry hadn’t read the article since he’d been caught by the picture, but he knew it wasn’t likely that the Daily Prophet wrote something useful. “It could be the Death Eaters again, like with everything else lately. I just don’t know why they’d have a problem with the Malfoys. I mean, it could be connected to what happened in at the Department of the Mysteries. Malfoys cannot be popular after messing up publicly like that.”</p><p>That was when Ron walked into the room. He glanced at the table, saw the paper and quickly picked up on what they’d been talking about. “What they wrote in the paper is absolute bogus. No one is going to buy Malfoys committing suicide. Why would they bother burning the place down if that was the case? Can you even imagine them feeling so 'ashamed of what they've been associated with now' that they'd choose to give up?” Ron asked, paraphrasing from the Prophet.</p><p>Harry agreed. Malfoys preferring the pureblood ideology wasn't exactly news. It was like the Daily Prophet to make a story that suited them the best. The death of the Malfoys was bound to get political, and the many ties that the Malfoys had to both the Ministry and the Death Eaters made it uncomfortable to find someone to blame. Although both the Daily Prophet had finally admitted that Voldemort was back after the battle at the Department of Mysteries had made it into the news that the Ministry approved, their style of reporting had not changed. The Prophet was still unwilling to make the connection between bad news and Death Eaters like that could somehow make the problem go away.</p><p>Before they could discuss the shortcomings of the Prophet further, soft popping noises filled the air as their guests started apparating to the front door. A moment later a louder thump followed by a cloud of ash in the air warned them that more Weasleys had joined them through the floo network. Soon the kitchen table had been transfigured larger to make room for all of them. The people invited for this meeting presented a crowd of familiar faces: Dumbledore, Mad-Eye Moody and Tonks, Mrs. and battered Mr. Weasley, as well as Fred and George were all chatting away happily.</p><p>Remus and Sirius were the last to join them. On their way down the stairs, Remus was steadying Sirius who was still extremely weak from the yet to be identified spell that had caught him at the tail end of the Battle of the Department of the Mysteries. Sirius had been confined to bedrest ever since, but had refused to be left out of the meeting and had complained long and loud enough for the others to give in. He slumped in his chair when Remus unceremoniously dropped him there. His skin had a greenish tone to it, but he managed to give Harry a grin when their eyes met.</p><p>When everyone had quieted down, Dumbledore stood up to start the meeting. “Now that the Minister of Magic has finally gotten back to his senses and acknowledged that there is a fight to be fought, I wish we could take a moment to rest. But it is not so, and I know that you all are aware of that. Voldemort is getting brasher and his followers have been active. There is an ever-increasing amount of disappearances and other dark deeds committed all around the country.  However, you all already know why I’ve called you all here today.” He took a moment to look through the faces in attendance and Harry noticed how Dumbledore’s gaze paused at each of the new people that had been allowed to join this time. Harry, Hermione and Ron had all witnessed what had happened at the Department of Mysteries – Fred and George had both protested until they had been let in too. They would no longer need to eavesdrop on these meetings. Voldemort would not leave them alone so it was only right that the Order also acknowledged this. Harry made sure to face Dumbledore’s gaze confidently as it paused at him. This was his place. He would be part of the Order from now on. “I am, of course, speaking of the urgent matter of what happened last night at the Malfoy Manor.”</p><p>“Do we have proof of Death Eater involvement? Or should we suspect one of our own?” Remus asked calmly.</p><p>“Thinking about what happened during the last war,” Moody said and stopped for a moment. Everybody got a bit grimmer with the words. There were many missing faces. “Lucius Malfoy got away scot-free last time even though there was some hard evidence on him. This might be someone who decided it shouldn’t happen again now that a war is upon us once more.”</p><p>“That is a possibility,” Dumbledore said. “We do not know either way. If this was something the Malfoys brought on themselves by angering Voldemort, I find it curious that there was no Dark Mark in the skies to make this an example of his power. It could’ve been Voldemort’s followers fighting each other. We do not know and that worries me.”</p><p>“What do you want the Order to do about it?” Tonks asked.</p><p>“I want people looking into it and finding the truth. This doesn’t seem like something that Voldemort would use to strike terror at the Wizarding World – there are better targets for that. This could’ve been a sign of weakness and if it was that, we need to use it to get the upper hand. We cannot afford to wait that Voldemort accidentally reveals his plan. Which reminds me– “ Dumbledore turned to look directly at Harry now. “Harry, my boy, there’s no doubting you have a connection to Voldemort, and that he is aware of it now.”</p><p>“You mean the dreams,” Harry replied.</p><p>“Exactly,” Dumbledore said. “I need you to keep practising with your Occulemency. Since it’s now summer time and you’ll be unable to continue your lessons with Severus, Remus has volunteered to help you instead.”</p><p>Harry turned to look at Remus who gave him a warm smile. Harry returned the smile. This was a welcomed change. Without Snape in charge, he could see himself learning something this time.</p><p>“I can help too,” Sirius said drawing everyone’s attention. He was looking even more sickly now, and his voice was strained, but that didn’t somehow stop him from sounding triumphant. “I know a good deal about keeping secrets,” he added.</p><p>“Sirius- “ Remus started with worry in his voice, and then shook his head. “You can hardly stand on your own two feet.”</p><p>“That is a generous offer,” Dumbledore interrupted before Sirius could protest. He smiled like what Sirius had just done was endearing. “However, there is something else that I would need your help with. I know that you’re not feeling too good, but- “</p><p>“I am FINE,” Sirius said and pushed himself more upright. His fingers were white where he gripped the table. “What is it you need done?”</p><p>“There’s someone I need to find a refuge for, just for a few days,” Dumbledore said. “And since it’s unlikely that you are going anywhere for a few days, I was hoping you wouldn’t mind a guest. It is the matter of the young Mr. Malfoy.“</p><p>The meeting broke into a cacophony of voices.</p><p>“No,” Harry gasped. He had started looking forward to calling Grimmauld Place his home and he simply <em>hated</em> the idea of inviting Malfoy there.</p><p>“Can’t the git go crawling to his Death Eater friends?” Ron muttered under his breath.</p><p>“Ron,” Hermione and Mrs. Weasley called in unison and Ron flashed red and looked embarrassed for having been heard.</p><p>Sirius glanced at Harry and then turned to look across the table. “Tonks and him are closer family. Can’t he stay with her?”</p><p>She looked equally uncertain. “He doesn’t like me very much. Besides, I am needed elsewhere.”</p><p>“Remus?”</p><p>“The full moon is tomorrow. There is not much I can do about it.”</p><p>“Calm down,” Dumbledore said. “I want you all to remember that we are talking about a boy here that is barely sixteen. He has now lost both his family home and parents.” Harry looked down at the table, feeling burned from having been scolded. He’d asked to be included in the meeting. He was determined to be adult enough to deserve a place at the table and swallowed any further protest he might've had. When he looked up, he noticed Sirius looking sheepish as well.</p><p>Dumbledore allowed the silence to settle before continuing. “Knowing who the boy has to relatives, I thought it essential that I see to it that he is watched over by someone I trust. We do not want him to get lost on the path that leads him to become a Death Eater because he doesn’t have a choice.”</p><p>“Who’s to say he isn’t one already?” said Mad-Eye quietly. There was a silent murmur after the words, but the earlier bursts of protest were gone.</p><p>“I get that,” Sirius said. “I would never want him to end up in the care of Bellatrix. But why take him here? I’ve been careful not to show my face anywhere. Unless you expect me to be Padfoot while he’s here, he’ll find out that not only I’m still around but that you know where I am. I doubt I have even the energy to transform right now.”</p><p>“You talked about just a few days,” Mrs. Weasley said. Ron looked horrified. The twins shared the horror-struck expression.</p><p>“Mum. I don’t think Malfoy-”George started.</p><p>“Not to the Burrow, Mum!” exclaimed Fred.</p><p>“No, no, I don’t think the boy would like that very much,” Mrs. Weasley said. “Dumbledore obviously has some plan in place already. Where will the boy go after a few days?”</p><p>“He said that he’d be in contact with his friends and see if he could stay with one of them. He will only need a place to stay until he gets an answer. That answer is likely to give us some insight into how the old families think about this situation, and who might sympathise whom. If he finds himself friends, we can just watch him from afar,” Dumbledore said. He turned his attention to Sirius then. “I wouldn’t put this on you, Sirius, if I saw an alternative. I want everyone out there looking for ways of fighting Voldemort. You won’t be out there for a few days, and I can tell the boy that you offered because he is family. Now, this forces us to let him know about you, if he hasn’t already heard from someone present at the Department of Mysteries, but that is a risk I’m willing to take.”</p><p>“You don’t trust him,” Moody said. “Why are you so eager to let him here?”</p><p>“I might trust too easily,” Dumbledore said and smiled gently. “However, as long as he is my student I will protect him. Grimmauld Place will do just that, just as Grimmauld Place has protected us. This place is safe from prying eyes. That is what we need until we know what happened. He cannot betray the location of this place while it’s protected by us. It is the safest solution for us all.”</p><p>There was silence once more. Dumbledore’s solution made sense even if it made Harry uncomfortable. Grimmauld Place was safe – that was why he could stay here – and if Malfoy needed protection, these walls could offer it to him. It did not meant that he was welcoming him here with open arms. Grimmauld place was <em>his</em>.</p><p>“Alright,” Sirius agreed. “I’ll do it.”</p><p>“Thank you, Sirius. I knew I could count on you. Now, to the other matters we need to talk about.”</p><p>And that was how it was decided that Draco Malfoy would come to stay at the Grimmauld Place. At the end of the meeting it was also agreed that the Order would gather elsewhere until Grimmauld Place was once again free of prying ears and eyes. After the meeting was over, people apparated and flooed away to carry out the duties given them. Harry had nothing to do except wait. The only thing he had been given to do was to learn to control his mind and that had to wait until Remus was back to teach him.</p><p>Before leaving himself, Ron came to Harry and laid a comforting hand on his shoulder, accompanied with a sympathetic smile. “It sucks, mate. Come to the Burrow if you can’t stand the git. Or lock him in one of the creepy rooms.”</p><p>Harry just shook his head. He tried not to think about what it would mean to have Malfoy as a guest in his home. It had already been agreed to and there was no backing out of it. Not that he wanted to do so – this was what Dumbledore needed and Harry did not want to disappoint anyone by allowing something childish like not liking the boy one bit get in the way. So okay, not thinking about it was not going all that great.</p><p>It was with a mix of relief and dread that Harry realised that everyone but Dumbledore and Remus had left.</p><p>“I’ll be back to be your teacher immediately when I feel better,” Remus said to Harry. “Take care until then. And try to keep Sirius from killing himself by overexertion.”</p><p>“I’ll do my best”, Harry said and they shared a smile. It would be easier said than done.</p><p>Then Remus too was gone, and only Dumbledore remained. He and Sirius were talking in low voices and looking serious. When they realised Harry was staring, they fell quiet.</p><p>“I will go get the young Mr. Malfoy then,” Dumbledore said. Neither Harry nor Sirius said anything. Dumbledore walked to the front door and it looked effortless as he disappeared into thin air with a silent pop. Harry had the time to turn to look at Sirius and wonder what they’d agreed to before there was a sound again and Dumbledore was back with Malfoy in tow.</p><p>Harry had expected the Malfoy that he knew from school. However, the boy walking through the front door of the Grimmauld Place was like a poor copy somebody had made of that Malfoy. His hair was absent-mindedly combed back, far from the carefully styled and controlled way Harry was used to. There was no sneer on Malfoy's lips, and he looked cautious, not confident. At least, not before he saw Harry. Suddenly, Harry knew that this was indeed Malfoy, the bully who hardly deserved the kindness of being looked after by Dumbledore.</p><p>“I see how it is,” Malfoy spat. “Don’t you <em>dare</em> to feel pity for me. We are not the same.” The anger made his whole demeanour vibrant and alive.</p><p>Harry just blinked. He hadn’t... He wasn’t pitying Malfoy. If he could’ve chosen, he’d never invited him here in the first place.</p><p>Sirius cleared his throat. The sound made Malfoy flinch and look at his direction. “Welcome to the Black Residence. Don’t touch anything you haven’t had the permission to touch. The place has something of a mind of its own and there are still hexes and traps waiting for the unprepared guest.”</p><p>“Should make you feel like home,” Harry muttered. He only belatedly realised how inappropriate the words were right now.</p><p>Malfoy looked at Harry again and he had murder in his eyes. His right hand closed into a fist. It looked like he was ready to throw a punch – before Harry realised that Malfoy’s wand was right there in his pocket, very close to the hand that was white at the knuckles now. Malfoy was trying <em>not</em> to take his wand out. It became so obvious that Harry stared wide-eyed. Malfoy could’ve hexed him, Malfoy <em>had </em>hexed him for insults before. Why hadn’t he tried now?</p><p>“Harry,” Sirius said, his voice already growing weary. “Find Malfoy a room. We can talk about getting you to the Burrow after that. Molly will gladly welcome you there if you ask.”</p><p>“No,” Harry said and shook his head. “This is my home. I’m not leaving,” he added and hoped that Sirius understood. He was above this fighting. This wasn’t a problem. And he was definitely not going to leave Sirius alone when he could hardly stand. He looked from Sirius to Dumbledore and back. Dumbledore gave him a little smile, and Sirius looked sympathetic. ‘If you say so’ his look said.</p><p>Malfoy hadn’t moved from the spot, and was looking just past Harry now. Harry felt unsure how to approach this situation. It had flared up so naturally at first, but now that he’d gotten scolded – with very few words, but scolded nevertheless – he wanted to show that he was capable of being civil even with Malfoy. “Come,” he finally muttered and turned to lead them up the stairs. Malfoy didn’t say a word, but followed.</p><p>Harry spared one fast glace back to see Sirius and Dumbledore watching them disappear up the stairs. There was obviously something that they wanted to discuss, something that even Harry wasn’t privy to. There was so much of that nowadays. It had to do with the dreams and the connection with Voldemort and ever since he’d fallen into the trap that Voldemort had set up, he’d been treated differently. It made Harry angry. He was not going to betray them! He was getting better at keeping the dreams away, and this far Voldemort hadn’t tried to spy during the daytime. At least, Harry didn’t think so.</p><p>“I’m not going to murder you in your sleep. There’s no need to glare at me like that”, Malfoy said surprisingly quietly.</p><p>“I wasn’t-“ Harry started and then dropped his reply. No point trying to reason with Malfoy. So, he’d displayed some of the anger he felt about being excluded in his expression. None of Malfoy’s business. “Appreciated, I guess,” he said grudgingly before quickly moving on. “The leftmost room is mine, and Sirius has the one furthest to the right, one floor up.“ He opened the room to the bedroom next to his own – it was mostly covered in cold green shades and cobwebs. There was an empty bedroom on the other side of the landing as well, but it was the room they’d stashed away most of the judging portraits, which Harry warned about. “You can practise your scowl with them if you want to, though,” he added.</p><p>Malfoy looked at him. “Was that supposed to be funny?” he asked.</p><p>Harry blinked.</p><p>“I’m not interested in listening you snore. I take the one with the portraits”, Malfoy said. “They might even like me. I have unpolluted blood in me, after all.” He headed towards the room with portraits without giving Harry the time to react, stepped into the room and then closed the door with a slam and then locked it.</p><p><em>Great</em>, Harry thought and walked to his room. He went almost as far as locking <em>his</em> door, but stopped right before turning the key. So, he was forced to share Grimmauld place with Malfoy. If he wanted to spend his time locked in a room with hateful ancestors, so be it. It was not Harry’s problem.</p><p align="center">xxx</p><p>Harry ate breakfast alone the next morning. That Sirius slept late was a good thing, but that didn’t make sitting in the big kitchen all alone any more comfortable. Harry had very rarely eaten alone like this, in a room which he'd used to sharing with others. Hermione and Ron, and occasionally Remus, had kept him company the few days that he’d spent here since the school year had been over, and any other summer he’d either been surrounded by the Weasleys or the Dursleys. Dursleys weren’t people that he’d be missing, but they’d been good at making noise. It was just too quiet now. Harry understood that Ron wanted to spend time at home. Hermione hadn’t seen her parents since Christmas so of course she too would head home. That did not stop Harry from hoping that he’d have someone to share the breakfast with.</p><p>Harry readied a tray for Sirius after he’d finished his breakfast and took it up. He left it on a dresser inside Sirius’ room when Sirius failed to wake up. A sleeping Sirius was a good thing, Remus had said. A sleeping Sirius couldn’t go around doing stuff that could potentially kill him. Harry smiled and closed the door after himself.</p><p>He walked down, found himself a book on Quiddish history that Sirius had found laying in his room, outdated but entertaining nevertheless, and got ready to wait the unavoidable conflict that was Malfoy at the Grimmauld place. However, Malfoy seemed to be intent on not showing up. When it was long past noon, Harry could no longer concentrate on the book. Malfoy wasn’t even here and he still managed to make Harry uneasy. Why wasn’t Malfoy getting down to find some breakfast? Malfoy couldn’t be such a drama queen that he intended to starve away in his room until he got a way out of here, could he?</p><p>Harry walked up the stairs and stopped at Malfoy’s door. The conflict would happen sometime – it could as well be now. He knocked on the door. “Malfoy?” he called when there was no immediate response. When there was still no reaction, Harry tried the doorknob in hopes that it would be unlocked. No such luck, but the rattling did get him Malfoy’s attention.</p><p>“What do you want?” Malfoy asked through the door. He sounded grumpy.</p><p>“Don’t you want breakfast? Or lunch, really.” Harry asked.</p><p>There was no answer.</p><p>“Malfoy? I wasn’t planning on poisoning you,” Harry said. He found himself saying the words almost like a joke, which did weird him out a bit when he thought about it. He and Malfoy weren’t friends – they’d never really spoken to each other unless one counted throwing insults back and forth as a type of dialogue.</p><p>“I’m not really hungry so you can just leave me alone,” Malfoy said. Even if he'd tried to sound confident, he sounded everything but. In fact, he sounded vulnerable - like anyone stuck in an unfamiliar place, surrounded by people they didn't like, Harry realised. It was with that thought that a Harry suddenly felt hollow. How could it be so easy to forget what Malfoy had just gone through? He had come here expecting to find the Malfoy that always resorted to ‘wait till my father hears about this!’ when he knew Malfoy no longer couldn’t say that. Malfoy had no parents and no family to go home to. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be here. Dumbledore had already twice reminded them about it, and yet, it had been so easy for him to forget. “I’m sorry,” Harry muttered.</p><p>“I told you not to feel sorry for me!” Malfoy hissed immediately.</p><p>“A sorry excuse of a Black!” came a screeching voice. Several others joined it. “The boy is weak.” “Listen him cry.” “Traitors, and disappointments… “</p><p>“<em>Stupefy!</em> Just SHUT up,” Malfoy cursed, the words followed by a loud thump. The door then started to rattle and Harry stumbled back to get out of the way. Malfoy opened the door and looked at Harry like it had been Harry who’d personally insulted him. Harry just stared back, dumbstruck. Malfoy had barely slept. He looked so very tired that Harry didn’t know what to do.</p><p>“So, they didn’t like me,” Malfoy said like it explained everything. He rubbed his eyes, which was when Harry realised that they were very red.</p><p>“Were you crying?” Harry asked.</p><p>Malfoy didn’t even blink before he had his wand out and had casted a curse. Harry was completely unprepared and could only lift his hand in a vain attempt to shield himself from it. He felt a cold wind push through, and realised that he couldn’t get any words out. A tongue-tying curse. Malfoy pushed past him into the room on the other side of the hallway, the one that Harry had originally offered to Malfoy. At the door, Malfoy briefly turned to look back.</p><p>“Don’t pity me,” he said and slammed the door close.</p><p>The curse unravelled fast enough and after gasping for a breath a few times and coughing, Harry had the words back. He was pissed now and did not stop to think. He turned to the door Malfoy had gone through and unlocked it with a swift movement of his wand. The lock turned with a satisfyingly loud sound. Harry was not going to stand down now that Malfoy had attacked him. It had been a harmless curse, but the next one might not be. </p><p>Malfoy was standing on the other side of the room, in front of a window that was covered with heavy curtains. Some light was still shining through and the backlighting made it hard for Harry to really see Malfoys’ face. Harry <em>could</em> see that Malfoy was still holding his wand in his hand although it had now fallen to his side.</p><p>“Get it over with then,” Malfoy snarled, but the words lacked strength. He was leaning back but there was nowhere he could go now.</p><p>“Over with what?” Harry asked. He took a step forward but stopped when he saw Malfoy raising his wand just slightly. He was like a cornered animal, waiting to see what Harry would do now. “I wasn’t going to hex you!” he said, having quickly changed his mind about it.</p><p>“Oh, of course you wouldn’t!” Malfoy snapped. “You are going to use this to smugly look down on me.”</p><p>“No, I’m not! Malfoy, stop it!” Harry placed his wand into his pocket. He displayed his empty hands. “We need to talk.”</p><p>“No, we don’t,” Malfoy said and raised his wand. He was looking like a deer in the headlights now. “I don’t need you telling how you <em>get it</em>. You never knew your parents. You have no idea what losing them feels like!” Malfoy moved his hand as if to cast a spell and Harry hurried to get his wand out, how stupid he had been to trust Malfoy-</p><p>“<em>Expelliarmus!</em>” Sirius cried.</p><p>Malfoy’s wand flew violently from his hand and hit a wall. Harry turned around to see Sirius standing in the hallway. Harry almost expected more shouting, but Malfoy and Sirius only stared at each other. Malfoy was trying to face the stare without faltering, but he looked scared and shaken. Sirius was angry, but he was keeping it in check, if just barely.</p><p>“I think it’s better if Dumbledore takes you back to Hogwarts”, Sirius said. Malfoy didn’t answer. Harry didn’t feel like it was his place to say anything. When Sirius turned to leave, Harry followed him after giving one last glance at Malfoy. The boy stood very still, making neither a move to stop them from going nor moving to fetch his wand.</p><p>Sirius walked the stairs down slowly. He probably shouldn’t have rushed to the rescue and Harry winced every time Sirius let a pained grunt on his way down. They made it in silence all the way to the kitchen where Harry helped Sirius to some tea. Harry found himself unable to break the silence even then. Sirius was busying himself with trying to make the tea cool faster while Harry tried to figure out what he wanted to say. At first he’d been angry, but he’d quickly become confused about who the anger was directed at. Malfoy was acting weird, but that didn’t mean that Harry had needed saving or that he’d been in danger because of Malfoy. They didn’t need to send Malfoy away because this. It was Harry who hadn’t known how to deal with the boy. Besides, they’d just agreed to provide him a safe place to stay at. They couldn’t withdraw their offer like this. it felt too much like Harry letting the Order down.</p><p>At the same time, sending away Malfoy was what he’d wanted to do from the beginning. Nothing that could’ve changed his mind had happened. Malfoy had been snippy and moody, and then locked himself away. It was just as bad as Harry had expected – barely a day had gone by and the Grimmauld Place felt confining and unwelcoming.</p><p>One of the stairs creaked and both Sirius and Harry turned to look. Malfoy stopped at the doorway to the kitchen, looking uncertain about what he was doing. He was still looking extremely tired, but Harry was certain that he’d tidied himself up a bit. Behind the uncertainty there was an unmistakable pride, which was impressive taking in the circumstances. Malfoy walked to the table with steady steps and placed his wand on it with a pointedly controlled movement.</p><p>“I’d prefer to stay here,” Malfoy said. “You can have my wand as reassurance that it won’t happen again.” He waited for their reaction with his head tall and posture ramrod straight.</p><p>Harry wanted to have something to say, but his tongue was still tied as if he’d been cursed again. He had not expected this. It wasn’t only Harry that didn’t know how to react to this. Sirius, however, had still his voice. “Why? Why would you want to stay here?”</p><p>“Because I can’t stay at Hogwarts. Not all alone. The place is awful without any other students,” Malfoy said matter-of-factly. There was hardly an emotion to his tone, just a small, forced smile at the end of it. “I’ll stay out of the way here.”</p><p>“Fine,” Harry said. The word sounded way too loud and crude, but he had to say something. He could buy Malfoy being afraid of being alone. That made sense. He might’ve even been afraid that somebody was out to get him. It was understandable. Harry felt determined to rise above this. “There’s tea,” he added. Malfoy nodded at the words and Harry felt immediately better. They could do this. The wand was left on the table, with nobody feeling like reaching for it.</p><p>Sirius watched silently as Malfoy walked to the teapot to pour himself a cup of tea. Malfoy then sat down as far away from Sirius and Harry as he could, drinking his tea in solitude. Still, this was progress. There was something like a fragile peace.</p><p>“I can’t wait for Moony to get back”, Sirius said quietly and gave Harry a little grin. Harry couldn’t have agreed more. Neither of them had mastered the art of diplomacy.</p><p>Harry left a tray with food at Malfoy’s door after Sirius and he’d eaten, but tried to forget the boy otherwise. Sirius was grumpy, but did his best to keep Harry company and it was mostly a nice day. They didn’t do much, but Harry was content nevertheless. Sharing cups of tea in the sitting room was cosy and closest to an own home that Harry had ever gotten before. He was happy for the rest of the day, and felt uneasy only when he passed Malfoy’s door again when escorting Sirius to his room. The plate <em>had </em>been emptied, which meant that Malfoy had been forced to eat alone. If Malfoy’s reason to stay here was truly that he feared being left all by himself in Hogwarts, they were doing an abysmal job at offering him a better alternative. Harry decided that he would try to get Malfoy eat with them tomorrow, even if meant he would be spending more time with the boy.</p>
