          <div class="userstuff"><p>It started on a Spring day. There was nothing remarkable about the day except for it was the first time he had spoken to me. </p><p>The conversation had been brief but it sent my heart into a spiral. It took over my mind. The smile he gave me as he left was ingrained in my brain. </p><p>It was two weeks before he decided to chat with me again. I had sat in agonizing silence each day waiting for the next time his words would grace my presence. </p><p>It took months of talking, over exaggerated laughing, and arm touching before he finally asked me out. </p><p>The date was to be simple. We were to go to Hogsmeade and have a drink in the Three Broomsticks. Little did we know that everything was on the brink of collapse. </p><p>The day before the date I had waited my whole life for war broke out. Everyone had known it was coming but I was too involved in my dreamland to notice. </p><p>I watched as friends and enemies were slain by each other. I cast each spell in hopes of making it back to you when it was all said and done. </p><p>I ran through the crumbled hallways. Harry Potter had done it, he’d defeated the Dark Lord. All I need to do now was to find you alive and well. </p><p>Thoughts of your smile and laugh filled my mind as I raced to the Great Hall. All I wanted was to see that smile once more. It had kept me alive this long. </p><p>I skidded to a halt as the group came into my sight. The Weasley family stood there holding each other as they cried. </p><p>I felt my stomach drop and raced to see which one it had been. I hoped it wasn’t him. It couldn’t have been. I needed him more than anything else. He was the hope that had gotten you through this and he had to of made it too. </p><p>George was the first to look up and see me. He rushed over pulling me into a tight hug.<br/>
“I’m sorry,” He whispered into my dirty hair. </p><p>I took a moment to let the words sink in and the tears fill my eyes. It couldn’t be. </p><p>“No, it can’t be,” I argued and tried to break free of the hug. I had to be sure it wasn’t him. </p><p>He pulled me tighter not wanting me to see. He wanted to protect me from the pain he felt inside. </p><p>Eventually, he let go and I ran to the body. The pale face of Fred looked up at me and I collapsed on the ground. The tears slipped down my cheeks as I fumbled looking for a sign of life. I knew it was no use, his family would have already tried. </p><p>Molly placed a hand on my shoulder, “You were very special to him.” Her words only felt like another knife to my broken heart.<br/>
As I placed a shaky hand to his face a voice behind me spoke up. “You didn’t even go on a date with him, stop being so emotional.” As I turned to see who it was tears blurred my vision. Rage burned in me but I couldn’t see who had said it. </p><p>I turned back to the body next to me and placed a light kiss to his forehead. George pulled me into another hug before letting someone lead me off. I looked back at his broken body one last time knowing it would be the last time I saw the man who had stolen my heart all those years ago and I let the regret of not making a move sooner sink in.</p></div>
