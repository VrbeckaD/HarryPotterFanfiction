    <p>There were plenty of odd conversations that Professor Remus Lupin had accidentally listened in on, as his students filed into his class, finishing up their conversations before their peers came. Seventh years talking about failed growth charms, others talking about their summer plans that consisted of bizarre trips or equally bizarre relatives. Odd dreams of Dumbledore in drag, rumors of duels used to resolve sexual tension, every conversation that Remus could- and some he didn’t wish to- imagine, he heard the tail end of. Some conversations were amusing, others enlightening, and every now and again, one made him pause.</p><p>“-only started shrieking again this year, and only on full moons. It’s obviously him!”</p><p>His blood ran cold. Remus watched as three Slytherins walked into the classroom, deep in conversation, and was it just him or were they studying their professor for a bit longer than usual? Theodore had given him a nod, Tracey soon after him, and Daphne had turned her nose up before turning her eyes back to Theo’s theory. The usual responses. Everything was normal, it was fine.</p><p>Five minutes until class started, as punctual as usual. The third year Slytherins never admitted that they came to class early simply to sit and converse, always bringing a new and interesting topic up; this had happened since the first class in September, them talking about Daphne’s sister’s new massive yet realistic portrait of the 1473 Transylvanian Quidditch team Captain Vladimir Ursu, “Yes, the one that released the bats”. They always denied their early arrival when it was brought up, saying that they only arrived a few seconds before the rest of the crowd. This time around, the usual quarter had dwindled down to three, Blaise Zabini and his sarcastic quips missing from the conversation.</p><p>“So let me get this straight.” Tracey set her bag down on the lowner left corner of the desks the quartet had claimed, looking toward her friend. “You think Sirius Black is a werewolf and is trying to make an entirely Gryffindor clan by kidnapping them and saving them for the full moon.”</p><p>It seemed his worry was unnecessary, and he let out a silent breath of relief.</p><p>“Don’t forget the part where he presents the clan to You-Know-Who when he’s done.” Daphne added dryly, amused with the whole situation.</p><p>“But why is he only going for Gryffindors?” Tracey questioned, trying to find reason in her friend’s theory. Theodore seemed utterly too prepared to answer, clearing his throat and reciting it to his classmates.</p><p>“The Ravenclaws are too smart to fall for his kidnapping plans and the Hufflepuffs are too nice to be effective Death Eaters. And Slytherin is protected, so there’s only Gryffindor left.”</p><p>Now the girls groaned, and Remus couldn’t stop the small bemused smile that grew at their responses, curious to see where this theory was going.</p><p>“You’ve read too many muggle books, Theo.” Tracey chided, shaking her head. “There’s no connection between vampires and werewolves, and he isn’t afraid of Snape because our Head of House <em>isn’t a vampire</em>.”</p><p>Theo scoffed, shaking his head, “Their hatred has to be based off of something.” The three looked up when the door opened, revealing their fourth friend. If he hadn’t been the only one entering, Remus would not have noticed the slight differences to his appearance- he seemed to be tired, his head still held high though his shoulders more tense than usual. His tie was slightly off center, something that was usual for Theodore, yes, but never for Blaise.</p><p>“Good morning, professor.”</p><p>“Good morning, Mr. Zabini,” was Remus’ response, turning his eyes back to the paper in front of him as Blaise leaned against his and Theo’s desk, aware by now of their seating arrangement.</p><p>“Blaise, isn’t it true that vampires hate werewolves?” The pale boy asked in greeting, making his friend pause in his removal of his parchment. There was a moment of tension before Blaise let out a sigh, almost sounding disappointed.</p><p>“Snape doesn’t have a hatred of Sirius Black because he’s a werewolf, he hates Sirius Black because he murdered twelve people.”</p><p>Theo scoffed, ignoring it, and Remus couldn’t help it as his smile grew wider, imagining the batlike figure of the potions professor and seeing how multiple students could come to such a conclusion. Snape was rather pale, and wasn’t seen nearly enough times in the Great Hall during meals. Not to forget his tendency to hang out in dungeons, ever since he was a student here himself.</p><p>“What do you think, professor?” Remus looked up, and it seemed as if Theo mistook his surprise for confusion as he clarified, “Do vampires and werewolves really hate each other?”</p><p>“There is no indication that, as a whole species, either feels one particular way for the other.” His mind went back to an earlier time, in the first war, where he had been sent alongside a few older members to ensure it was remaining a simply-wizard conflict; the vampire covens they had spoken to did not seem particularly threatening, and Remus figured that they weren’t able to automatically tell what he was, just as he wouldn’t have known they were anything other than wizards if he hadn’t been given context.</p><p>“He gave us the professor-answer, it doesn’t count.” was Theo’s response to the amused looks of his friends. Daphne rolled her eyes, sitting down in her seat as the first students began trickling into the room.</p><p>“Who would win in a fight?” Tracey smacked her friend upside the head for Blaise, shaking her head as he complained that there was no need for violence, and that he would stop asking questions. There was a pause of silence between the four, before the other Slytherin boy stated with a wicked grin,</p><p>“A vampire, obviously.”</p><p>This was one of the few times the questions had trickled into classtime; the lessons were simply from the book this time, a quieter session than others, and it gave the boys plenty of time to quip back and forth.</p><p>“The Killing Curse?”</p><p>“Works.”</p><p>“Blood Pops?”</p><p>“Probably need a few.”</p><p>“Mr. Nott, Mr. Zabini.” Remus called out in warning, making the two quiet down for a few minutes and return to work. The peace didn’t last, however, as Theo continued his questioning, fixating on the topic.</p><p>“Sunlight?”</p><p>“Like a bad rash.”</p><p>“Reproduction?”</p><p>Blaise gave him a look that reminded Remus of McGonagall’s disappointment toward Sirius and James, and Theodore seemed to understand his mistake, laughing and turning his eyes back to his work. The defense professor let out a thankful breath, happy to not have to warn them again or dock points just for a boy’s curiosity.</p><p>“Would a werewolf bite-?”</p><p>“Shut up, Theo!” Tracey hissed from behind the two, swatting him with a quill. The three involved all looked up to their professor, the tips of Theodore’s ears turning pink in embarrassment when he realized that Remus had been paying attention the entire time. Conversations were put on hold until the end of class, where the professor was able to hear a whispered,</p><p>“Bats?”</p><p>“Patronus, not animagus.”</p>
