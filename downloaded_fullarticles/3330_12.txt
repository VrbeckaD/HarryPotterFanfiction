    <p>Petunia hated her nephew.</p><p> </p><p>She hated his eyes. </p><p>Not just because they were the same <strong>FREAKISH </strong> - <em> different, bright, Avada Kedavra, otherworldly, beautiful, wonderful, magical </em> - green as her sisters. </p><p>But, because even as a babe it - <em> he, they, <strong>FREAK</strong>, waste, <strong>BOY</strong>, never harry, never human, never worthy </em> - looked as if it were staring into her soul - <em> peeling back layers, stealing secrets, finding truths, none of her lies would be believed, <strong>HE JUST NEW!</strong> Evil little devil spawn </em> - and seeing everything she was. </p><p>The feeling of being stripped to the bone -<em>ravenous, hungry, constant </em> - whenever he looked at her made her skin crawl. It made forgetting what he, <em><strong>IT</strong></em> was all the more impossible.</p><p> </p><p>She hated the fact he had been left on HER doorstep just like Lily - <em> beautiful, strange, bright, Other </em> - had been left on her parent’s door step.</p><p>The symmetry would almost be poetic, if it wasn’t for the fact that Petunia didn’t want it, not like her parents had, - <em> oh how they’d begged, and pleaded, and prayed. Just one more child, just one more. So desperate that they’d let a <strong>FREAK</strong> like her, <strong>IT</strong> into their home with open arms, refusing to see the monster within. </em></p><p>She did not want this creature in human form. Who moved with the predatory stillness and grace that his mother had. That smiled the same broken - <em> jagged, vicious, more, possessive, cruel, sharp, kind, OTHER… so, so, like the Sidhe he came from </em> - smile full of teeth and pain. </p><p>She took a near gleeful pleasure, in using chores and Vernon to add the pain in his smile - <em> precious, miraculous Lily had never been taught her place, she was far too <strong>SPECIAL</strong>. Only she had seen the <strong>FREAK</strong> within. </em></p><p> </p><p>But most of all, though she would never admit it, she hated him because he had <strong>MAGICK</strong> - <em> power, sorcery, divination, witch craft, SIGHT, wizardry, voodoo, devilry. </em></p><p>He had what she had always wanted.</p><p>Desire turned to Jealousy. 
Jealousy turned to Hate. 
Hate Turned to Fear.</p><p>He had power, but he didn’t understand it - <em> not <strong>yet</strong> </em> - so she would make him feel powerless and helpless - <em> like she was; always afraid, envious, jealous, fearful… why wasn’t it hers! She deserved it, not the little monster </em> - for as long as she could. </p><p>She would make him suffer.
 After all, it was only what he deserved.</p>
