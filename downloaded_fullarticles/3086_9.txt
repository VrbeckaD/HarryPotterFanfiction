    <p>Prologue - five years in the future </p>
<p>A tall man with shoulder-length black hair walked down the street, unassuming in his ripped black jeans and leather jacket, a cigarette casually dangling from the side of his mouth. He walked down the street at a steady pace carrying a large black portfolio. No one looking at him would know that this punk reject was a world-class thief. </p>
<p>As the man made his way down the street towards an apartment complex, he flipped his hair out of his eyes and used the movement to glance over his shoulder to reassure himself that he was not being followed. </p>
<p>He continued on his way down the street, adjusting his white-knuckled grip on the portfolio handle. As he turned the corner, he spat out the mostly spent cigarette, snuffing it out with a twist of his boot. </p>
<p>The wind decided to pick up a little and he quickened his pace towards his destination. He turned down the alley parallel to a brick building that had seen better days. It was an unassuming building that the man knew was much nicer on the inside than the exterior would lead someone else to believe. He reached the side door and wrenched it open making his way into an empty stairwell. The door shut behind him with a quick snick, and he quietly bounded up the stairs to the first floor. </p>
<p>Exiting the stairwell, he made his way into a deserted corridor and glanced at the numbers on the doors as he walked. He ticked them off in his head, 101, 103, 105, and stopped in front of the door marked 107, halfway down the corridor. </p>
<p>He set the black portfolio against the corridor wall, a little less gently than intended,  as he proceeded to pat down his pockets. All he found was his wallet, phone, and lighter, but upon further inspection he found his lock picks in the inside pocket of his leather jacket. Good thing he knew how to use them. </p>
<p>The man then knelt down, scratchy carpet against his knees through the rips in his jeans, so he was at eye-level to pick the lock. He grabbed a pick and torsion wrench, shoving the rest of the kit back in his pocket. He picked the lock in a matter of seconds, but just as he was using the torsion wrench to turn the plug, the door was pulled open from the other side. </p>
<p>“Fuck,” the man muttered under his breath as he lost his balance and ungracefully fell forward onto his hands and knees. </p>
<p>******************</p>
<p>A couple hours earlier </p>
<p>Remus was worried. He kept pacing the flat hoping Sirius didn’t do anything stupid while he was gone. Remus just returned from a trip, a trip he had not wanted to take, but had to. Sirius had tried to convince him not to, but it was no use, they both knew Remus had to go, for closure, and he was only gone a few days anyway. </p>
<p>However, that wasn’t the full cause of Remus’ worry. Remus’ main worry was Sirius. Leaving Sirius alone often led to foolhardy plans that never ended well. While Remus would admit to Sirius’ brilliance, never in the other man’s presence, however, he needed someone a little more rational to rein in his exuberance. A couple weeks ago, they had finished a rather physically and emotionally exhausting job. It was something a little more personal for all of them, unlike their usual fare for the past few years. Now Remus was waiting on a call from James with information about a new job, something easy but potentially dangerous, nothing new there.</p>
<p>Hopefully, Sirius stuck to his plan of laying low and acting normal. Remus knew Sirius’ artistic endeavours could at least occupy his time for a couple of days. Sirius kept complaining about Lily badgering him to finally finish the painting he promised to her and James. Remus could only cross his fingers that Sirius decided to finish it. </p>
<p>Remus looked at the clock on the wall and realized almost an hour had passed without him noticing. He stopped his pacing and sat down in the comfy armchair in the lounge. He went to sip his tea and found it had gone cold, so he put it back onto the saucer on the side table. He decided he would try to read to take his mind off of things. Opening the book he had started recently, Remus read a few paragraphs, then realized that he had too much nervous energy to sit still. </p>
<p>He put the book down, got up and walked towards the other side of the lounge as he noticed the sun reflected off of something metal. As he looked closer, Remus realized the metal object was Sirius’ set of keys. </p>
<p>“Looks like he forgot them. Again,” he muttered to himself.  Remus put the keys in his front trouser pocket. He decided he needed to work off some energy, so he pulled his jumper over his head of messy curls as he made his way down the hall to the spare room. </p>
<p>The room was an office slash studio slash home gym. Remus draped his jumper over the back of the desk chair then proceeded to open one of the desk drawers for tape to wrap his hands. Hitting the speed bag for a while was always a good way to get his frustrations out.</p>
<p>Remus was halfway through wrapping his left hand when he thought he heard a sound from the other room. Normally, he would try to ignore it, but he was already too wound up. Ignoring the fact that his hand was only half wrapped, Remus ripped the tape from the roll and grabbed his jumper as he left the room to investigate. </p>
<p>The noise sounded like it was coming from the other side of the front door, so Remus figured Sirius must have returned, but the lack of knocking and the addiction of unexpected noises were suspicious. Remus approached the door and pulled his jumper back on, if it wasn’t Sirius, he couldn’t open the door bare-chested, his multitude of scars often led to raised eyebrows. He couldn’t hide the few faded ones on his face, at least he could cover his chest. </p>
<p>Remus listened for a moment and then quietly jerked the door open with his right hand. He let out a sigh as he heard a thump and then laughed at the image in front of him. A black-haired man balancing on hands and knees in the doorway. </p>
<p>******************</p>
<p>Well at least Remus inclination that it was Sirius was correct. In a tired yet amused voice, Remus said, “Padfoot, what on Earth are you doing?” </p>
<p>The man with the long black hair, Sirius, looked up at Remus leaning on the door as he blew his hair out of his face, “You know, just letting myself in to my flat. What are you doing, Moony?” </p>
<p>With a sigh Remus put his hands into his pockets, “Just watching my idiot boyfriend try to explain why he was breaking into his own home.” </p>
<p>There was a pause while Sirius leaned back onto his heels about to begin explaining, but before he got a word out, a large hand dangled a set of keys with a paw print keychain in front of his face, “Forget these again, did you? I found them on the coffee table in the lounge.” </p>
<p>Sirius shrugged, “You know, Moony, even if I had the keys, this way just seemed easier.” A smirk covered his face as he fully looked at Remus. </p>
<p>Remus shook his head, “In what world is it easier for you you to pick the lock instead of knocking on the door?” </p>
<p>“In the one where I’m a world class thief and can pick locks in my sleep?” Sirius said smugly, tossing his hair over his shoulders. “Well I didn’t want to interrupt if you were reading,” he added in a softer tone. “I knew you’d be worn out from your trip.” </p>
<p>Remus looked down at him fondly and let out a small chuckle, “Only you, Pads.” </p>
<p>Remus pocketed Sirius’ keys, and put his right hand out to help Sirius up off the floor. Sirius reached forward and pulled the pick and torsion wrench out of the lock, tucking them into his jacket and grabbed Remus’ hand. </p>
<p>As Remus hauled him off the floor, Sirius noticed that his left hand was partially wrapped, as if he stopped mid way through, while his right hand was bare, clammy against his own palm. As he got to his feet, Sirius noticed that Remus was  barefoot and that his jumper must have been hastily pulled back on if the state of his curls was anything to go by. </p>
<p>Sirius knew that he would find Remus one of two ways when he returned: molded to the armchair, legs tucked under him, with a book in his lap and a cuppa slowly growing cold on the table, or in the spare room stripped to his trousers, short curls dripping sweat into his face and his wrapped hands hitting the speed bag hung in the corner. But he would have put his money on reading. </p>
<p>“I guess I was wrong anyway,” Sirius said mostly to himself, still thinking as he let go of Remus’ hand.  He looked back at Remus’ face and asked, “Suiting up to box? Punch your frustrations out?”  He mimicked a boxing stance, fists up. </p>
<p>“What? Oh, yes I was,” Remus nodded  as he met Sirius’ eyes.  Remus looked apprehensive as he flexed his left hand, looking at his knuckles. </p>
<p>“Just let me grab the portfolio from the hall, Lils would kill me if something happened to that painting,” Sirius said as he quickly squeezed Remus’ hand again and let go. “I think she and James are gonna come ‘round with Harry later. How does a movie marathon sound?” </p>
<p>“Sure” Remus mumbled his assent. He continued leaning against the door to hold it open for Sirius as he walked inside with a large black portfolio in hand. Sirius walked into the room and bent down to lean the portfolio against the side of the sofa, while Remus moved out of the doorway to close the door behind them. </p>
<p>Sirius stood back up and turned to look at Remus as he walked towards him. Sirius gently prodded Remus’ arms which were again crossed over his chest. Remus uncrossed his arms as Sirius prodded them and pulled him into a hug. Sirius wrapped his arms around Remus’ waist and snaked one of his arms up to clutch the back of Remus’ jumper over his shoulder blades. Remus leaned into the embrace and wrapped his arms around Sirius’ shoulders, exhaling on a sigh. </p>
<p>Sirius  whispered, “I missed you,” as he kissed the side of Remus’ neck. Sirius felt the vibration as Remus laughed into his collarbone. Picking his head up off of Sirius’ shoulder, Remus’ lips turned up into a smile as he muttered, “Pads, I was barely gone for three days.” </p>
<p>“Well I still missed you. I mean we know I only keep you around to shower me in affection,” snarked Sirius, keeping the conversation light. Remus thumped Sirius on the shoulder lightly and stepped out of the embrace. “Think what you will Sirius, but someone still needs to keep you out of trouble.” </p>
<p>Sirius smirked and walked further into the flat towards the kitchen, “Says the man who is always right there with me,” he winked at Remus. </p>
<p>“Touché” Remus smiled. He walked towards Sirius and feigned the other way and took a seat in the armchair. “Well I guess you’re stuck with me then.” </p>
<p>Sirius scoffed mockingly then exclaimed, “You’re my partner in crime! I wouldn’t want it any other way.” He then walked into the kitchen to fix tea. </p>
<p>Remus only responded with a wide smile and soft eyes thinking how lucky they were to be here again, he didn't care if Sirius didn't believe in luck. He was in his flat with the man he loved, and their best friends would be by soon. So what if they were still considered criminals. If only the road to getting to this point wasn’t so rough.</p>
