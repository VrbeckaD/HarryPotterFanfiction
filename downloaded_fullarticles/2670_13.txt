    <p>Across a busy afternoon street, between the sea of moving legs of varying densities, coat dulled by the lack of sunlight, the squigglemink scampered.</p>
<p>Newton Scamander charged after it, as fast as an omega in a brutal heat can run, Dougal wrapped around him and a smell-me-not spell coating his heated skin.</p>
<p>"Spiffy!" He hissed vehemently, causing a few muggles to look around a bit.</p>
<p>The squigglemink squeaked indignantly, disappearing around a corner.</p>
<p>He gave chase, the slick coating his thighs growing cold and the glands deep within throbbing angrily.</p>
<p>He hoped fervently that the sun wouldn't shine; sunshine caught the myriad of pigments in the cat-like creature and set it ablaze in color.</p>
<p>It already looked strange with its large caribbean-blue eyes and forked tongue, the latter of which hung from its mouth as it ran.</p>
<p>The muggles, for the most part, ignored it as it bolted up the street, some shaking their heads at it in confusion.</p>
<p>Newt threw spells at it, missing and thankfully not harming any of the people, but his magical core was already exhausted enough and couldn't afford much more, so he ceased fire and instead focused on his smell-me-not spell.</p>
<p>Dougal cooed in alarm as the squigglemink ran into the MACUSA headquarters.</p>
<p>An omegan distress call almost escaped his lips but he stifled it vehemently and continued running, volcanic with pheromones.</p>
<p>He followed it inside.</p>
<p>It weaved through the legs of witches and wizards, and disappeared further into the building.</p>
<p>Newt didn't often feel even remotely violent but fate was not on his side that day.</p>
<p>"We must return home!" He lamented, panting heavily as the hallways grew more dimly lit.</p>
<p>"Spiffy," he tried again weakly, anxiety creeping into his voice.</p>
<p>Spiffy stopped for a moment, turning her bulbous eyes on him, intelligence glittering in her gaze.</p>
<p>Then she walked off, further still, and disappeared into a room.</p>
<p>Relieved at the dead end, Newt ventured after the squigglemink, into an empty office.</p>
<p>Dougal released his hold and the wizard was visible again.</p>
<p>Newt scooped Spiffy up, the squirrel-sized creature cooing and contentedly flashing rainbow colors across its pelt.</p>
<p>He could feel the sweat across his body, the slick soaking through his pants, the air stifling with the smell of his primitive need.</p>
<p>"Dougal, can you take her back to the suitcase? I'm going to be a while," Newt spoke to the demiguise, who made an affirmative noise, accepting the squigglemink into his arms and scampering away, invisible in a moment.</p>
<p>He took a moment to breathe, his muscular chest heaving, crouched over with a hand on his knee.</p>
<p>He was very suddenly slammed with the scent of an unmated alpha, who smelt of mangos and coconut.</p>
<p>He collapsed against the side of the desk beside him, a violent cramp in his abdomen crippling him for a moment.</p>
<p>His own scent began to blaze with fertility.</p>
<p>"Omega?" The alpha choked out, pre-rut pheromones soaking the air.</p>
<p>"Alpha," Newt realized in a lewd breath, as Director Graves bent him backwards over the desk, sniffing at his neck.</p>
<p>"My charm..." Newt managed, referring to his lost smell-me-not bubble.</p>
<p>"No-spell wards," Percival growled, grinding his immense, erect, and clothed cock against Newt's thigh.</p>
<p>The time for talk was over.</p>
<p>The omega's instinct took over, and he fought back, a test to deem the alpha worthy or not.</p>
<p>He managed to dislodge Graves from his ass, but the alpha regained control, pinning his arms above his head with one hand while the other undid their pants until both stood in puddles of their trousers.</p>
<p>With a possessive growl, their boxers fell and Percival entered him less than gently, impressive cock filling him beautifully and stretching him in ways he thought weren't possible.</p>
<p>He cried out, his own dick straining and sandwiched between them. Percival's hand circled it, and pumped vigorously, the pre-cum it wept serving as lubricant.</p>
<p>Percival thrust deeply into Newt, buried to his balls inside him, seemingly aiming for something.</p>
<p>Newt had sex before, but nothing had ever come anywhere near the level of sensations he experienced.</p>
<p>Then his prostate was struck mercilessly, and tears ran down his beautiful freckled face as his legs wrapped around Percival's waist and his nails scratched at his broad back, still annoyingly clothed.</p>
<p>He fumbled at the buttons with trembling fingers as Director Graves fucked him, staring deep into his stormy gray eyes as the vest and then the shirt once it fell to the floor.</p>
<p>He pawed at Percival's perfect abs, an omegan purr rumbling through his chest in satisfaction as Percival rolled his hips, the movement punctuated by the sound of his slick-coated balls smacking filthily against Newt's pert ass.</p>
<p>The alpha brushed some hair out of the omega's face, the last gentle thing before he brutally rammed in, his knot inflating, and even as Newt's entrance was sealed shut he rutted desperately inside him still, eyes rolling back in his head.</p>
<p>Newt's body instinctually seized the knot and milked it roughly, which prompted load after load of cum as Percival came with a harsh, low growl. It pumped deep inside Newt until his lower belly distended from the amount, and he came onto Percival's abdomen.</p>
<p>Then, in the silence that ensued, Graves, chiseled torso heaving with satisfaction and an alpha purr, leant down and bit down on Newt's neck, stimulating the sensitive glands there.</p>
<p>Newt cried out, immediately wrenching himself free so he could lean up and return the favor, nipping at Percival's neck and leaving a matching scar.</p>
<p>They lay connected by cock and ass, sweat trickling down their bodies and soaking into their puddles of clothes.</p>
<p>Newt, tears streaking down his face, inhaled deeply. The scent of rut and sex filled his lungs.</p>
<p>Percival wiped the wetness from his face, and kissed along his jaw, tongue flicking out to taste his skin.</p>
<p>They lay that way a while, until the older man's knot receded enough for him to pull free.</p>
<p>He made as though to pull out, but Newt's heat was insatiable. It flared indignantly, and he cried out, reaching for his alpha, and Percival was helpless but to answer his call.</p>
<p>He thrust inside Newt again, lifting him so that he was seated on the desk, both hands on his ass as he undulated in waves of tandem into the other wizard.</p>
<p>Newt mewled with pleasure and relief, the omegan distress call dying on his tongue as his alpha fucked him.</p>
<p>Their minds cleared significantly, given time. "A-Alpha," Newt stammered, as Grave's body slid against his pleasantly.</p>
<p>"Mm?" Percival hummed quizzically, purring slightly at the feeling of his omega under him.</p>
<p>"Don't think we've been-" he paused to moan in ecstasy, "-properly introduced."</p>
<p>Percival chuckled, and leant forward to kiss him to silence him.</p>
<p>The younger man tasted of ripe strawberries and blackberries in his heat, his arms wrapping around his neck to hold him there and secure himself.</p>
<p>They fucked twice more upon the desk, Newt coming once untouched and once touched, his belly taut and slightly rounded with seed.</p>
<p>Percival pulled out, finally, seed spilling out slowly, and helped Newt to his feet.</p>
<p>The omega's legs buckled, and Director Graves caught him, holding him close.</p>
<p>"Try to stand," he ordered gently, and the younger wizard obeyed, testing his legs gingerly.</p>
<p>After about a minute, he could stand properly. Graves supported him as he walked, and helped him into his clothes.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry I brought you to this," Newt spoke quietly, a blush dusting his freckled cheeks.</p>
<p>"Wouldn't have missed it for the world," Percival purred.</p>
<p>"So sorry about Spiffy, it won't happen again," Newt squeaked, blushing, before Percival locked their lips together in an affectionate kiss before gently directing him towards the door.</p>
<p>"If you need me, touch the bite with your wand and I'll apparate to you. My name is Percival Graves."</p>
<p>"I'm Newt Scamander," Newt managed, to which the alpha nodded.</p>
<p>So, naked and still with an air of authority Newt knew with utter certainty he'd never possess, Director Graves continued working at his desk.</p>
