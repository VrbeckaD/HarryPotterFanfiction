    <p>Holly had been trying to catch a portkey to the Quidditch World cup and had barely made it after packing her broom, wizarding tent, smartphone, headphones, laptop, hair care and personal hygiene products, and her plush dragon. She managed to grab the old tire just in time for it to whirl her away luggage and all but when she opened her eyes she wasn't where she was supposed to be. This was definitely not England... This was definitely not even outside! Her head hurt and her hand was burning like she'd stuck her hand in a pot of boiling water and glowing killing curse green. She looked around and found men in medieval armor with swords surrounding her as the door burst open. This couldn't be good...</p>
<p>"Tell me why we shouldn't kill you now?!" The woman growled, standing over her menacingly.</p>
<p>"For one I didn't do anything, another would be that murder is wrong... I'd also like to know who put this curse on my hand, cause that's gonna be a problem." The young witch replied with a shrug.</p>
<p>The armored woman looked like she was going to say something before looking at another blonde woman standing to the side then back at Holly. "What do you mean 'curse'?"</p>
<p>"Well normal magic doesn't leave marks like this that cause pain. I can feel the shit climbing up my arm trying to consume me, nothing but a curse could do that... Don't know the spell though so I can't reverse the curse." Holly replied.</p>
<p>"You're lying!" the armored woman accused, grabbing Holly by the shoulders and shaking her. The blonde woman who'd been silent until now pulled the armored one away from the witch and shook her head.</p>
<p>"We need her, Cassandra." She told her.</p>
<p>The armored woman that Holly now new was named Cassandra grumbled and stepped back while the blonde stepped closer, and squatted in front of the witch. "Do you remember what happened? How this all began?" She asked.</p>
<p>"I was trying to catch a portkey to the Quidditch cup, I'm supposed to be playing... I was a bit late and almost missed it, I got there just in time but... I ended up somewhere else. It was killing curse green with things chasing me... Then I remember a woman... But then I woke up here. I can't remember anything else, sorry." Holly replied, shaking her head.</p>
<p>"A woman?" the blonde asked, interest piqued.</p>
<p>"Yeah... She was really bright with a weird ass hat." Holly replied with a nod.</p>
<p>Cassandra stepped forward again "Go to the forward camp, Leliana" she told the blonde, "I will take her to the rift." she finished.</p>
<p>The blonde left the room, footsteps barely making any sound on the stone floor as she walked. Cassandra unlocked the shackles around Holly's wrists and pulled out a rope to tie her again. "What're you guys talking about anyway? What's going on? Why's it look like a god damn renn fair?" Holly asked, rubbing her wrists and backing away from the woman slightly. If she could avoid being bound she was going to.</p>
<p>"It would be easier to show you; now give me your hands." Cassandra replied.</p>
<p>"Not if you're gonna tie me up, I'm not. This is unlawful imprisonment." she said, folding her arms.</p>
<p>"Do not argue with me, prisoner." Cassandra growled.</p>
<p>"You kidnapped me and are holding me, prisoner, threatening to kill me and you expect me to cooperate just like that? I'll go with you but you're not tieing me up, and I'm sure as hell not going anywhere without my wand." Holly retorted.</p>
<p>"I don't know what a wand is, but I will allow you to walk unbound... Try to escape and I will kill you." Cassandra relented, if only slightly.</p>
<p>Seeing her wand on a table in the corner Holly grinned, walking over and picking it up, slotting it into place in the holder strapped around her wrist inside her sleeve with a relieved sigh. "This is my wand, and I'm not going to let it out of my sight. Got it, crazy lady? Try and take it and I'll turn you into a duck." Holly scowled at Cassandra, and Cassandra scowled back as Holly started up the stairs.</p>
<p>When they exited the building and Holly saw the sky her jaw dropped. What sort of magic could do that? Just then the mark on her hand flared as the hole in the sky did, causing her to fall to her knees. "What the fuck!?" She hissed in pain, grabbing her wrist.</p>
<p>"We call it the breach, a massive hole into the world of demons... Every time the breach grows so does the mark on your hand... And it is killing you." Cassandra told her, squatting before the witch.</p>
<p>"Well that's fucking peachy, isn't it? I'm not an Auror lady, I'm a Quidditch player. I might be a witch but I sure as hell didn't do that, and I don't know what kind of magic could... But I'll try and help." Holly groaned as the mark on her hand eased its assault.</p>
<p>"Then, you mean?" Cassandra asked</p>
<p>"I can't make any promises but I'll try. Merlin's beard... This is breaking the statute of secrecy ten times over... How fast do you need me up there?" Holly replied with a sigh as Cassandra helped her to her feet.</p>
<p>"As fast as possible, but it's a long walk." Cassandra replied, brows furrowed.</p>
<p>"Damn it... Hope you guys didn't break my broom..." She muttered, pulling her wand from her sleeve with a sigh. <em>"Accio Starsweeper!"</em> she called out, a ruckus coming from inside the building they'd exited as the broom flew out the doors from the dungeon and hovered in front of the witch and seeker.<br/>
"What is the meaning of this?!" Cassandra gawped.</p>
<p>"Well you said you wanted to get there fast, flying is faster than walking. Now get on the damn broom." Holly said, taking the broom into her hand and straddling it.</p>
<p>"I am not getting on the broom." Cassandra huffed</p>
<p>"Would you rather walk then? Because if you would then I can just go myself and deal with this all without you." Holly returned.</p>
<p>With a grumble, Cassandra straddled the broom behind the witch "You may want to hold on, this broom is really fast. It's a quidditch broom." Holly told the seeker.</p>
<p>"A what?" Cassandra asked</p>
<p>"A Quidditch broom, wizard sport. Basically, it goes fast." Holly replied with a grin. At that Cassandra wrapped her arms around Holly, holding on closely. With a shrug, Holly lifted the pair into the air, high into the air which caused Cassandra's hold to tighten on the witch who laughed.</p>
<p>"So you want me to test this whatever on something smaller right?" Holly asked, moving the broom forward, the wind blowing her hair into Cassandra's face who simply sputtered to get it out of her mouth.</p>
<p>"Yes, we will be meeting two people and closing a smaller rift that opened in the breaches wake. You will know when you see it." Cassandra replied.</p>
<p>With that Holly increase the speed of the broom, sending them forward at a speed that the seeker had never imagined. They quickly arrived above a green tear in the air surrounded by people fighting off... Holly had no idea what they were, but Cassandra had called them demons, so she was going to go with that. She set them down on the ground nearby and drew her wand as Cassandra stood stunned at what she'd just experienced.</p>
<p>Seeing the demons attacking a wizard using voiceless magic and a staff she settled on assisting him, aiming her wand at one of the two she shouted <em>"Reducto!"</em> and the demon disintegrated, turning to dust on the ground. Turning to a second demon which was attacking a muggle and aiming her wand there <em>"Sectumsempra!"</em> she called as the demon's arms were cut off before it turned into green ooze on the bricks below. By now the other two demons had been dealt with and she slotted her wand in her sleeve again. The bald wizard grabbed her arm and shoved it toward the rift.</p>
<p>"Quickly! Before more come through!" He told her.</p>
<p>She felt the magic of the mark connected to the green tear and sealing it. She looked between the man and her hand in awe "Just what did you do?" She asked him.</p>
<p>"I did nothing. The credit is yours." He told her, with a knowing smile upon his face.</p>
<p>"You mean this mark, right?" Holly asked him.</p>
<p>"Whatever magic opened the breach in the sky also placed that mark on your hand." He explained. "I theorized that the mark might be able to close the rifts that have opened in the breaches wake, and it seems I was correct." He added.</p>
<p>When Cassandra heard his words she stepped closer, with a determined look on her face. "Then it could also close the breach itself." She suggested, pleased with this knowledge.</p>
<p>"Possibly, the bald man said, turning to Holly. "It seems you hold the key to our salvation." He continued.</p>
<p>A voice from behind chuckled and Holly turned to see who it was "Good to know! Here I thought we'd be ass-deep in demons forever!" A short man said, tugging the gloves on his hands on further. He looked up at Holly with a grin before speaking again "Varric Tethras: Rogue, storyteller, and occasionally unwelcome tagalong" He introduced with a wink.</p>
<p>Cassandra groaned at Varric as Holly introduced herself to him in return "I'm Holly, Holly Wagner. It's nice to meet you Varric."</p>
<p>The wizard chimed in with "You may rethink that stance in time."</p>
<p>Varric laughed and replied with "Aww, I'm sure we'll become great friends in the valley, chuckles."</p>
<p>That made Cassandra unhappy as she stepped closer to Varric and told him "Absolutely not. Your help is appreciated, Varric, but..."</p>
<p>Varric quickly cut her off with "Have you been in the valley lately, Seeker? Your soldiers aren't in control anymore. You need me."</p>
<p>With a groan, she turned and walked away as the bald wizard started to speak once more "My name is Solas, if there are to be introductions. I'm pleased to see you yet live."</p>
<p>Before she could reply Varric spoke up "He means 'I kept that mark from killing you while you slept'."</p>
<p>"You seem to know quite a bit about the mark on my hand..." Holly said to Solas.</p>
<p>"Solas is an Apostate, like you." Cassandra commented.</p>
<p>"Seeker, your prisoner is capable of magic yes, but she does not draw on the fade like I or another would... Her magic is unique. Even so, I suspect that no mage would be capable of the magic we have seen with the breach." Solas told Cassandra.</p>
<p>"Ok first off... Not a Mage. I'm a Witch. Second, what the fuck are you lot talking about? What's the fade? What's an Apostate?" Holly butted in.</p>
<p>"You... Do not know the fade? We all enter it when we sleep and mages draw upon it to use their magic!" Cassandra seemed displeased to hear about Holly's lack of knowledge on these topics.</p>
<p>"I've never heard of it... And my magic, like any witch or wizard's magic, is drawn from inside us. And you, Solas! You should be ashamed! Revealing yourself to nomages. We'll be lucky if the ministry doesn't take your staff and my wand and put us in prison for breaking the statute of secrecy!" Holly said, folding her arms.</p>
<p>"Revealing myself to... Statute of secrecy?" Solas seemed confused, so did Cassandra and Varric when she looked at them.</p>
<p>"You have to be kidding me... This is why you're all dressed like a fucking renn fair?! Merlin's beard... The portkey took me... The portkey took me to another world..." Holly muttered as the realization dawned on her.</p>
<p>"That would explain why your magic is different than any other magic I have encountered" Solas replied.</p>
<p>Cassandra scoffed "We can deal with this later. We must close the breach."</p>
