  <span>The sixth year cowered against the wall, and Ron relished in the smell of iron and ammonia. “I would think again before saying that. I’d hate for Hogwarts to have to report the death of a student again.” He studied his wand. “Regularly, I wish people a good day before I leave, but I think it’s a bit too late for that, wouldn’t you agree?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The sixth year whimpered and huddled closer to the wall, which Ron took for conferment. “Excellent. I’ll be leaving now. Wouldn’t want to show up to the Halloween Feast in bloody robes, would I?” He turned and left, and started to whistle once he had rounded the corner.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sorry I’m late,” he gasped out, falling down onto the seat beside Harry. “A Ravenclaw was confused about certain things, and I couldn’t just let him go without helping him, could I?"</span>
</p><p>“Again, Ron? What was it this time? Did he say you were-”</p><p>“He said you were a traitor, Harry, and he called you a good-for-nothing. . . I’d rather not repeat it, ‘mione.” Ron glowered down at his plate. “I did the right thing, alright? No one gets to talk about you like that. And it’s not like he’s dead.”</p><p>“Yet.” Harry looked up from the textbook he had been reading. “You might not have killed him directly, Ron, but we know your methods. What spells did you use, by the way?”</p><p>
  <span>Hermione gave a subtle wave of her hand, and the surrounding chatter dimmed down. “You might consider being a little </span>

    <span>quieter</span>
  </em>
  <span>. Even though you’re the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry, that doesn’t mean others-” she nodded towards the professors’ table, where Dumbledore was conversing happily to Snape. “Won’t be keeping tabs on us. The Headmaster has been suspicious of us ever since the Philosopher’s Stone when missing.”</span>
</p><p>“Way to damper the mood, Hermione. Anyway, I used the one we made up just recently. You know, the one that combines the conjunctivitis curse with the one we found in the Restricted Section about draining blood.</p><p>“And he was still able to move when I left him, so if he has enough sense he’ll scurry along to Pomfrey. If not, well. . . It’s not a large loss.”</p><p>“Hogwarts will shut down if they find someone dead, like they almost did two years ago. Even if he deserves to die, he shouldn’t in school. Investigations will be everywhere. I hope you cleaned your robes. That spell is extremely messy.”</p><p>“Relax, Hermione.” Harry put a hand on her shoulder. “They’ll never suspect us, and even if they do, what’ll they do about it? No one even thought of accusing me, even though they had ample evidence. Riddle got off scot-free, and we will too."</p><p>
  <span>Hermione opened her mouth, presumably to make yet another objection to, what Ron considered, their very sound logic, but Dumbledore stood up just in time. He scoffed, and muttered, “Fancy being grateful to Dumbledore of all people.”</span>
</p><p>“Beauxbatons, Durmstrang, and Hogwarts students; it is time for the Goblet to choose the Triwizard Champions!” He gave a fancy wave of his wand, which the trio had long since suspected was merely for show, and the lights dimmed. Crouch rolled out the Goblet, careful to dodge the spitting green flames.</p><p>Mme. Maxime stepped up to the Goblet, and it spat out a piece of paper that floated delicately into her hand. “Fleur Delacour!” She called, and clapping arose from the Ravenclaw table. Karkaroff had shoved his way over, and reading the slip, Ron swore he saw him smile. “Viktor Krum!” Ron turned toward Harry, and started clapping enthusiastically. Dumbledore had now made his way to the Goblet, and with a great bellow, “Cedric Diggory!” left his mouth.</p><p>“Not the worst champion for Hogwarts,” Hermione muttered. “Not the worst.” Students returned to their conversations - albeit with a lot more glee than before.</p><p>“That reminds me, Harry.” Hermione glanced around before continuing. “I was curious about who had placed their names in the Goblet, and so I snuck out last night to see if I could tamper with it. I couldn’t, of course. Dumbledore isn’t called the greatest wizard for nothing. I was about to go in the Entrance Hall when Professor Moody walked out! I don’t think he saw me; he didn’t seem to be expecting anyone, but don’t you think that’s a bit odd?”</p><p>
  <span>“Are you implying he tampered with the Goblet? And how, considering, as you said, that Dumbledore is far more powerful than him.” Harry shook his head. “I suppose it </span>
  <em>
    <span>sounds</span>
  </em>
  <span> reasonable, but even if it did happen, why would it concern us?”</span>
</p><p>“I don’t know, Harry.” Ron jerked his head sideways. “Look at Mad-Eye over there. He seems pretty upset, and he keeps looking over here. Maybe whatever he had planned failed. Maybe he wanted the Goblet to choose a Slytherin champion.”</p><p>“And once again, does it matter? He obviously failed, which means that it didn’t really matter whether or not he tampered with the Goblet.” Harry got up and slung his bookbag over his shoulder. “Come on. If we leave now we can maybe pick around in Malfoy’s stuff.” Hermione and Ron followed close behind, their heads joined together.</p><p>“Don’t look now, but Mad-Eye is watching us. Do you think-”</p><p>“Do I think that his plan concerned us, or just Harry? Yes, yes I do. And he might still be planning something else. Just. . .”</p><p>“Don’t tell Harry.”</p>
