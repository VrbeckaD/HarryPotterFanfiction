    <p>“What are we doing in here, Hermione?  Shouldn’t we head to Molly’s Christmas party?”</p>
<p>“No,” Hermione said, shaking her head at Remus.  “We won’t be going to that.”  She’d been waiting long enough for 12 Grimmauld Place to be empty, and she was going to make the most of this rare opportunity.</p>
<p>“We aren’t?” Sirius asked, frowning.  “I’ve been looking forward to Molly’s fudge all week!”</p>
<p>“I know you have,” she said.  “But there’s something you’ve been wanting, both of you, for a lot longer than that.  And tonight you’re going to get it.”</p>
<p>Remus raised his eyebrows.  “Oh?  And what might that be?”</p>
<p>Hermione’s answer couldn’t be simpler.  “Me.”  To make her intentions clearer, she kicked off her shoes and bent down to pull off her socks.  She felt Sirius’ eyes checking out her cleavage as she bent, and it made her grin.  They really were painfully obvious.</p>
<p>“Wh-what are you talking about, Hermione?” Remus said, sounding nervous.  “We would-I would never—“</p>
<p>“You aren’t as subtle as you think you are, Remus,” she said.  She got back to her feet and shook her head at him.  “You might not be as obvious as Sirius, who never misses a chance to walk behind me so he can stare at my arse, or to look down my cleavage like he just did.”  She paused to glance at Sirius, who just smiled and shrugged his shoulders, knowing he’d been caught and not bothering to deny it.  It didn’t surprise her that he was the less resistant of the two; Harry’s godfather was a known flirt.  It was Remus who was going to be harder, but she knew she’d get to him in no time.  “But don’t think I didn’t notice how long your eyes lingered on my legs in my cheerleader costume at Halloween, or that erection you tried to hide when I ‘accidentally’ sat on your lap last week.”</p>
<p>“You did that on purpose?” Remus said, shocked.  So shocked that he forgot to deny the hard cock she’d felt poking her arse through his trousers that night.  “But why?”</p>
<p>“Because I’m sick of you two doing nothing but staring,” she said.  Her hands went to her jumper, and she began to pull it up, exposing more and more of her supple young body by the second.  “I’m tired of waiting for you to make you damn move and shag me already, so now I’m making the move.”  She pulled the jumper over her head and tossed it aside, leaving only her bra on her chest.  It was the sexiest bra she owned, a lacy purple thing that pushed up her already impressive chest, making it even more tempting.</p>
<p>“But, but the age difference,” Remus protested feebly, though she didn’t miss the fact that his eyes kept drifting down to her chest despite his best effort to maintain eye contact.  “And you were my student, and—“</p>
<p>“I’m not your student anymore, ‘professor,” she pointed out.  “That was years ago.  I’m all grown up now.”</p>
<p>“You certainly are,” Sirius said, whistling in appreciation as he stared at her.  Unlike Remus, he wasn’t bothering to hide how much he wanted her.</p>
<p>“That’s not helping, Sirius,” Remus said faintly, though he couldn’t bring himself to look away as Hermione unzipped her jeans and began to shimmy them down her legs.  “Yes, I know you aren’t a little girl anymore.  I’m very aware of that, much as I’ve tried not to be.  But what about the age difference?  We’re both old enough to be your father.”</p>
<p>“So what?” Hermione said.  She got the jeans down around her ankles and kicked them away, revealing her matching purple knickers.  “I’ve been with a couple blokes my age.  They don’t know what they’re doing.  I need a man, a real man.  Luckily for me I have two of them here with me, and I’m betting they can give me the good hard shag I’ve needed for months.”  </p>
<p>“Lucky for you indeed,” Sirius said.  Hermione grinned at him and reached down to undo her bra, but he stopped her.  “Let me do that,” he said.  He stepped forward, took her into his arms and kissed her on the lips.  Hermione moaned into the kiss, happy that at least one of them needed no more convincing.  Sirius was a known womanizer back in his youth, and part of that had definitely been knowing how to kiss.  She was pleased to discover that it was a skill that had not left him even if he had been out of practice for years.  She moved her lips against his, wanting to return his kiss with equal passion and heat.</p>
<p>Sirius broke the kiss, leaving her gasping.  He spun her around in his arms so her back was pressed to his chest, and reached around her body to grope at her chest through her bra.  Hermione groaned, loving the feel of a real man’s hands on her, a confident, experienced man rather than a timid young man closer to her own age.  With her back to Sirius, she was in the perfect position to stare into Remus’ eyes.  She saw the lust there, the desire overwhelming his conscience as he watched his best friend grope the young woman they shared a mutual attraction for.  It excited her even further.  Hopefully it wouldn’t be too long before Remus joined in as well and she had two handsome older gentlemen’s hands on her.</p>
<p>For the first time in her life, a man got Hermione’s bra off without any fumbling.  The hands of her friend’s godfather were steady and sure as he undid the clasp in the front and pulled her bra off of her chest.  She watched Remus closely as her breasts were exposed to his eyes, and grinned at the raw lust she saw there.  It wasn’t the full moon so she didn’t need to fear the werewolf even if he’d forgotten to take his wolfsbane, but it seemed a different sort of beast would soon be assaulting her.</p>
<p>Lupin didn’t have much time to ogle her, because Sirius quickly took her tits in his hands and began to grope them again, this time without her pesky bra in the way.  Again Hermione reveled in his firm touch.  Her previous lovers had been so hesitant to touch her like they’d clearly wanted to, so afraid of doing something wrong that they’d treated her like something fragile.  There was nothing hesitant in Sirius’ touch.  He saw what he wanted and he took it, giving her tits a squeeze and playing with her nipples.  This was a true man, one who was going to give her what she needed for the first time.</p>
<p>“Merlin, how long I’ve been dreaming about taking you into my arms and playing with your tits just like this, you hot little witch,” Sirius groaned.  He kissed her behind the ear, making her shiver.</p>
<p>“Do it,” she gasped.  “Touch me!  Show me what it’s like to be with a real wizard, a real man!”</p>
<p>“With pleasure, love,” Sirius said.  He gave her breasts another squeeze and lightly bit her neck.  “Time’s running out, Remus.  If you don’t get over yourself and get your stubborn arse over here, I’ll keep this lovely young witch all to myself.”</p>
<p>Remus had been wavering already, and his friend’s very real promise to go forward with or without him proved to be the thing that pushed him over the edge.  He crossed the room, and there was zero uncertainty in his eyes now as he stepped forward and kissed Hermione.  She groaned into his mouth, enjoying being taken by him.  He was every bit as good a kisser as Sirius, only in a different way.  Sirius was more about pressing a kiss on her and encouraging her to reciprocate.  Remus wasn’t interested in getting her to kiss him back; he was here to dominate her.  His lips firmly claimed hers, and his tongue demanded entry into her mouth, entry she happily granted.  He took over for his friend in squeezing her breasts, while Sirius grinded against her from behind, letting her feel his hard cock rubbing against her arse through his trousers.  When she reached out with her hand and rubbed at Remus through his trousers, she could feel he was just as hard as the other man.  She had two hard cocks ready and waiting for her, and she wasn’t going to make them wait any longer.</p>
<p>Hermione broke away from them both and dropped to her knees between them.  She’d waited long enough for them, and wasn’t going to wait anymore.  She impatiently stripped them both of their trousers and boxers, not stopping until she had two hot, hard cocks within her reach.  How fortunate she was, to have two well-hung men right here for the taking.  She didn’t need to take any time to think about which one she’d take on first, because she was going to make sure neither of her lovers went ignored.  While it was Sirius’ cock that her mouth went to first, her hand shot out to wrap around Remus’ length at the same time.  She smooched Sirius’ cockhead and ran her tongue across his tip while her hand, already moisturized just for this very moment, began to move up and down on Remus.</p>
<p>She threw herself into what she was doing.  It was so much better, so much MORE than anything she’d ever felt before, and it threatened to overwhelm her.  This wasn’t her first time giving a blowjob, but Sirius’ cock was far longer and wider than the two she’d sucked in the past.  She was having to dig deeper and push herself harder than she ever had before, but she was more than happy to do so.  Having a dick like this here for her to play with, to feel and to kiss and to suck on, was well worth the added effort she had to put in.  She worked her head up and down his length, gradually taking more of him in as she got used to fitting his larger cock inside her mouth.  And she didn’t forget Remus at any point; her hand continued to wank him without pause even as she taught herself how to suck a real man’s cock.</p>
<p>“Good girl, Hermione,” Sirius groaned.  “You’re sucking me so well.  You’re such a good little cocksucker, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>Hermione felt a thrill shoot through her at the lewd praise.  Dirty talk wasn’t something she had much experience in, and she found that it motivated her to bob her head even faster and take his massive cock down even deeper.  She wanted this, wanted to be his good little cocksucker.  But not just his.  She wanted to do the same for Remus, wanted to make her normally gentle and kind former professor go crazy with lust and become addicted to her and what she could do for him.  She pulled her head off of Sirius and turned so she could begin to suck Remus instead.  Lupin’s cock was not quite as thick as that of Sirius, but he did have his friend beat when it came to length.  All in all, she had two very impressive dicks to sample.</p>
<p>“That’s so good, Hermione,” Remus sighed.  “You’re doing an excellent job, but I would have expected nothing less from you.  You always were impressive at whatever you set your mind to.”</p>
<p>It was a very different from of praise than what Sirius gave her, but she appreciated it just as much.  It seemed to fit each of their personalities perfectly, Sirius being the cocky alpha male who loved to talk dirty, and Remus being the kindly former professor who gave her positive reinforcement.  Both approaches motivated her to give them all that she had.</p>
<p>She switched back and forth from one cock to the other, bobbing her head on one of the handsome older men for a minute or two before shifting and taking the other into her mouth.  Neither man had to wait for long before her mouth was back on him, and she kept him satisfied even during that short wait by wanking his cock and making sure he stayed hard and ready for her.  It made her feel like a porn star, using her mouth and both of her hands to get two men off at the same time.  The old Hermione would have been scandalized by the comparison, but the present day Hermione was more comfortable in her own skin and with her own sexuality, and the idea of being the personal porn star of these two handsome older men thrilled her.</p>
<p>Hermione would have been happy to keep that going indefinitely, but Remus took that option away from her.  Without warning, he began to cum inside of her mouth.  Her eyes widened in surprise, and her initial instinct was to pull her mouth off of him.  She prevented herself from doing so at the last minute though.  If she really wanted to embrace her sexuality, doing what she’d done before at the end of blowjobs and having him finish on her hand wasn’t going to cut it.  It was too late to pull off an impressive facial, so the best option was to stay right where she was and swallow his cum.  That proved to be no simple task, since he came for longer than her previous lovers, but she had never been a quitter.  She took it all in and swallowed it all down her throat proudly.  She smiled and stuck her tongue out at Remus afterwards to show off her success, and he groaned.</p>
<p>“Sorry about that, Hermione,” he said, wiping his brow.  “It’s been some time, and it snuck up on me before I knew it.”</p>
<p>“It’s okay,” she reassured him.  “But will you be able to get hard again tonight?  I was really hoping to get fucked by both of you tonight.”</p>
<p>Remus chuckled.  “With a lovely young thing like you here to inspire me?  I don’t think we have anything to worry about.  Just give this old man some time.”</p>
<p>“And in the meantime, you have another old rogue here to keep you company,” Sirius said.  He held his hand down to her, and she allowed him to pull her to her feet.  His hands immediately went to her knickers, pulling them down her legs and getting her fully naked.  “You shaved?” he said, sounding surprised.  “Wasn’t expecting that.”</p>
<p>“I wanted to be nice and pretty for you both,” she said, happy he seemed pleased with her absence of hair.  “Do you like it?”</p>
<p>“I do,” he said.  He reached between her legs and rubbed her smooth lips with his pointer finger.  “It makes me want to spend hours eating you out.”</p>
<p>She shivered at the thought of her horny old dog licking her for the rest of the night, but reluctantly shook her head.  “I’d love that, but another time,” she said.  “You two have been getting me worked up for months with your stares, and I can’t wait any longer.  Please, Sirius, fuck me.”</p>
<p>“I’ve never been one to refuse the request of a beautiful young woman,” he said, giving her that charming smile of his.  “How about you get on your hands and knees?”</p>
<p>“Doggy style?” she said, amused.  “How fitting, Padfoot.”  She assumed the position though, crawling onto the bed and getting down on all fours for him.  She heard a rustling that she could only assume was him taking off his shirt, and then he climbed onto the bed behind her.</p>
<p>“Hope you’re ready for this, because I’ve never been good about taking it easy,” he warned her. </p>
<p>“Good,” she said.  She bit her lip as she felt his cock press against her entrance.  “I don’t want easy.  I don’t want you to make love to me.  I want you to fuck me.”</p>
<p>“Then you’ve found the right dog,” he said.  He pushed forward, and then he was inside of her.</p>
<p>“OH!” Hermione gasped.  She wasn’t a virgin, but this was easily the biggest dick she’d taken, and as a result she felt fuller than ever before.  He gave her no time to get used to his hefty cock though.  His warning had been justified, because there was no slow entry here, no easing her into this.  He fucked her hard right from the very beginning, slamming into her from behind and forcing his cock in and out of her as fast as he could move his hips.  And that was very fast indeed.  Sirius might have been out of practice, but he definitely knew what he was doing.  She’d asked him to fuck her and that’s precisely what he did, better than anyone else ever had by a very wide margin.  His cock pumped into her tightness over and over again, his hips bouncing off of her arse with every thrust.  This was what Hermione had wanted, had always wanted, even before she suspected Sirius was the man to give it to her.  True to both this position and his animagus form, he was fucking her like a dog fucked a bitch in heat.  And she supposed that’s exactly what they were at the moment, especially considering how desperate she’d been for this.</p>
<p>The swift and deep fucking was all Hermione could have hoped for and more, and her body responded.  She screamed out at the top of her lungs when her orgasm hit, taking full advantage of the empty house and not restraining herself at all.  Either Sirius had been deliberately holding on until he knew she’d gotten off or her already tight cunt muscles squeezing him even tighter was more than he could handle, because he grunted and began to fill her up with his cum before she’d even finished.  That was perfect as far as Hermione was concerned.  Feeling him shoot off inside of her was the best way possible to end her first time with him.  No dog would ever stop fucking his bitch until he’d given her his sperm, after all.</p>
<p>“I hope you weren’t hoping for a marathon,” Sirius said moments later, after he’d pulled his cock out of her.  “I could barely contain myself, especially not once I was inside you.  That was definitely the tightest fit I’ve ever had.”</p>
<p>“Thank you,” she said, smirking to herself.  Most women would probably be offended by such a statement, but she took a sort of pride in hearing Sirius say she was the tightest of all his previous lovers.  It was an exhaustive list, after all.  “It was exactly what I needed.  I wanted you to fuck me, and you did.”  Did he ever!</p>
<p>“I’m sure it’ll only get better once we’ve done it some more, and I’ve gotten back to my old self,” he said confidently.  A hard fuck better than the one he’d just given her?  There was a thought.  “But in the meantime, I think you’ve got a wolf ready for more.”</p>
<p>Hermione rolled over onto her back, anxious to see if Sirius was telling the truth.  Sure enough, Remus was hard once more.  Perfect timing.</p>
<p>“Are you ready for more this quickly?” Remus asked.  “If you need some time, I completely understand.”</p>
<p>Even at a time like this, her former professor was considerate to a fault.  She found it endearing, but there was no need for him to worry.  “Get over here and fuck me, wolf.”</p>
<p>Sirius climbed off of the bed and Remus took his place, ready to fill in for his friend and make sure their witch got everything she needed.  Unlike her dog, her wolf didn’t make any requests or demands of her.  “How do you want it?” he asked her.</p>
<p>Hermione tapped her lip for a moment, considering.  There were all sorts of interesting positions she’d read about and was curious to try.  In the end though, she decided to go with the most common of them all.  “Give me missionary,” she said.  It was one of only two positions she’d done before tonight, but none of those previous times had been with Remus.  “I want to see how it feels when it’s a real man on top of me.”</p>
<p>Remus smiled and got on top of her, taking his cock in hand and carefully guiding it into position.  He slowly inserted himself inside of her, and groaned as he pushed further forward into her.  He wasn’t slow in the way her previous lovers had been though, because there was no hesitance in anything he was doing.  Remus had the bad habit of thinking too little of himself and doubting his own worth in many situations, but that didn’t seem to apply in the bedroom.  He didn’t fuck her with the same intensity that Sirius just had, but that didn’t seem to be his style.  </p>
<p>Where Sirius was all about frantically snapping his hips into her as quickly as he could, Remus focused on steadily thrusting his cock into her as deeply as he could, finding the proper angle that hit just the right spots inside of her to draw the loudest groans, and repeating that precise motion as consistently as he could.  It was a more intellectual approach, and it set Hermione off in a completely different but no less powerful way.  She loved the animalistic pounding from Sirius, but she loved this analytical approach from Remus as well.  She couldn’t decide which she preferred, and then smiled when she realized she didn’t need to choose because she could experience them both.  What a lucky witch she was.</p>
<p>Since he wasn’t fucking her with the reckless abandon Sirius had, her time with Remus lasted considerably longer.  He kept working his cock back and forth inside of her at a steady pace, always pushing deep into her and hitting that one spot that felt REALLY good.  It helped that he didn’t neglect her clit in his routine either.  He had her moaning and screaming early on in the process, and the longer it went on the more her pleasure built higher and higher.  While part of her wanted this to go on as long as possible, preferably all night, the logical side of her vaunted brain realized her body wouldn’t be able to take such focused and sustained pleasure for too long.</p>
<p>He drove her to her second orgasm of the night, but kept on going during and after her screaming climax.  His hips kept pumping and his cock kept pushing into her long after she’d come down from her high and settled back in.  Just when she was beginning to plead with him to give her over stimulated body a break, he stilled on top of her, groaned into her ear and began to fill her with his semen just as Sirius had.</p>
<p>“God,” Hermione moaned moments later, after her wolf had finished and pulled out of her.  Sirius had rejoined them on the bed, and the two men lay on either side of her.  “I can’t remember the last time I felt so exhausted.”</p>
<p>“But it’s a good exhausted, right?” Remus wanted to know.</p>
<p>“The best,” she said, smiling at him and rubbing his hairy chest.  “I can’t believe you two made me wait so long for this.”</p>
<p>“A mistake I, for one, won’t be repeating,” Sirius said from behind her.  He placed a kiss on her bare shoulder.  “From now on, I plan to fuck you as often as you’ll let me.  You’re going to get tired of me before long, I promise you.”</p>
<p>“Don’t count on that,” she said.  “I’ve had plenty of time to come up with all sorts of fantasies since you two kept looking but not touching.  We’ll be busy for months just trying to work through my list.”</p>
<p>“With your brain, I can only imagine what we have in store,” Remus said, grinning at her.  “But as for now, I’m afraid this tired old wolf needs his rest.”</p>
<p>And rest they did.  The two men sandwiched Hermione on either side, Remus hugging her front while Sirius pressed against her back.  It was a tight fit, the three of them squeezing in so close together in the bed, but Hermione couldn’t remember the last time she’d slept so well.</p>
