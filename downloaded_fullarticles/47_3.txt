    <p>
  <span>Hermione Granger did not know what to expect when she apparated just outside of the Hogwarts grounds.  When she had left in July the school was still teaming with witches and wizards working on reconstruction.  The grounds had been marred by scorch marks and spell scars and littered with rubble.  During the Final Battle greenhouses had been destroyed, the library roof caved in, and significant damage to the castle battlements had occurred.  But once Harry had emerged victorious, there had been no shortage of volunteers to help with rebuilding.  Shops in Diagon Alley and Hogsmeade had reopened, homes were repaired, and Hogwarts’ reconstruction was project number one as far as the Ministry of Magic was concerned. </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Focusing on all the rebuilding was what kept Hermione going.  Easier to focus on helping others than on her own demons.  What Hermione wanted was normalcy.  This was largely what made her decide to return to Hogwarts to sit for her N.E.W.Ts.  After being awarded Orders of Merlin First Class and the Daily Prophet sensationalizing their war efforts, Harry, Hermione, and Ron could have any job they wanted.  People were lining up to recruit them.  But Hermione didn’t want anything she hadn’t earned and so, while Harry had entered Auror training and Ron had gone to Romania with Charlie, Hermione returned to school.  One last year.  One last time through Hogwarts. </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione’s letter from Professor </span>
  <span>McGonnagal</span>
  <span> had instructed her to arrive a day early before the semester began.  She and the other so-called </span>
  <span>eighth</span>
  <span> years would be meeting and settling in before the Welcoming Feast.  A consideration of their unique status at the school.  Hermione was expecting new rules and high expectations.  All those returning would be doing so voluntarily and with the understanding that they were there for their exams.  Hopefully, that meant they would be academically inclined and stay out of her way.  Hermione was here to work. </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>With her trunk levitating behind her and Crookshanks in his carrier under her arm, Hermione walked through the gates and onto the school grounds.  </span>
  <span>The grass looked nearly immaculate. Some of the trees were missing, destroyed in the battle.  But overall it was much the same.  Most of the rubble had been cleared and, to her delight, a new house seemed to have been built for Hagrid on the grounds.  Circling around the castle she saw smoke coming from the hut’s chimney and a thriving pumpkin patch nearby.  Though the precious plants in the damaged greenhouses had been lost, all but one had been rebuilt in her absence.  The quidditch pitch was nearly finished with new stands.  The library roof was completely fixed and shingled.  Overall everything looked back to normal.  But inside the castle was a different story.</span>
  <span> </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Once inside the entrance hall, Hermione could see repairs were still needed.  Many of the gargoyles and ornamental stone pieces were missing or broken.  Several portraits in the entrance hall were gone with outlines around their newly bare spaces.  But before she could explore the castle further, a house elf appeared with a pop.</span>
  <span> </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Pardon me Miss Granger!  Are you needing help with your trunk?”  </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, no thank you.  I was told we just leave them here?”  </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes Miss!  Headmistress wishes for everyone to meet in the Great Hall for tea at two.”  </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you… erm”  </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Gordie </span>
  <span>M</span>
  <span>iss!”  The elf smiled, “If you are needing anything, please let us know!”  </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The elf disappeared with another pop.  Glancing to her left, Hermione saw that some other trunks had been left near the doors.  She smiled when she saw the trunk labeled, N. Longbottom and the one with S. Li.  Good old Neville had decided to come back and Su Li was a Ravenclaw who had been in Hermione’s arithmancy classes.  With a few hours to kill before she needed to meet McGonagall for tea, Hermione let Crookshanks out of his basket and decided to explore the castle.  It was deathly quiet without any other students around. </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione found herself walking towards Gryffindor tower out of habit.  But as she neared the old Charms classroom, she found her breaths coming quicker.  She took a wrong turn at the statue of Barnabas the Barmy and found herself face to face with a human-sized scorch mark burned into the stone.  Suddenly she could smell the smoke, the burning of flash.  Turning on her heel Hermione hurried away.  The walls were closing around her, someone was screaming.</span>
  <span> Hermione’s breathing came faster and faster until she was gasping.  Legs shaking, she sat on the staircase she’d been climbing and let out a dry sob.  Rocking back and forth she began repeating to herself again and again,</span>
  <span> </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I can do this. I can do this.”</span>
  <span> </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>At ten minutes to two, Hermione stood outside the doors to the Great Hall.  Taking deep breaths, she pressed a hand to her stomach.</span>
  <span> </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I am calm. I am safe. I am calm. I am safe.</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Then moving suddenly, Hermione pushed the doors open.</span>
  <em>
    <span> Screaming, crying, the smell of dust and blood. HARRY!  </span>
  </em>
  <span>But then she blinked, and it was different.  Hermione blinked once, twice and then looked up.  The same enchanted ceiling, the thousands of floating candles, the house banners, all there.  This was the Great Hall.  But rather than the four long tables, there were dozens of round tables, ten chairs at each.  Professor McGonagall was laying out plates of biscuits on one of them.  Looking up, the headmistress caught Hermione’s eye. </span>
  <span> </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hermione!  So good to see you!  You have no idea how pleased we all were when we heard you were coming back for your final year.”</span>
  <span> </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Smiling at the warmth in her professor’s voice, Hermione made her way to the designated tea table.  </span>
  <span> </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Professor!  The castle looks amazing!  You’ve all made such progress!”</span>
  <span> </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh yes!  The volunteers have been most enthusiastic.”</span>
  <span> </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>McGonagall sat down and gestured for Hermione to do the same.  Taking the seat her professor indicated would put Hermione’s back to the doors.  Glancing behind her, Hermione paused for only a few seconds before taking a seat.  Her wand was safely holstered on her arm, up her sleeve but she checked it anyway.  Before she could say anything else, McGonagall was standing and smiling at someone over Hermione’s shoulder.</span>
  <span> </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mr. Longbottom!  Welcome back!” </span>
  <span> </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Neville looked like he might have grown another inch taller.  He looked fit and pleased to be there.</span>
  <span> </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey Hermione!  I didn’t know you were back!”</span>
  <span> </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Standing, Hermione gave Neville a hug, “Just got back today actually.  How’re the greenhouses?  Looks like you got them ready to go!”</span>
  <span> </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Neville grinned and took the seat next to her, “Oh yeah we’ve been working hard!  Lost some of the plants but loads of the old wizarding families donated cuttings or whole specimens.  So, we actually aren’t too worse for the wear.”</span>
  <span> </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And one by one the other 8</span>
  <span>th</span>
  <span> year students started to arrive.  Susan Bones and Su Li came nearly at the same time.  Ernie MacMillan arrived puffed up and feeling important with the Head Boy badge pinned to his chest.  And then, to Hermione’s shock, the Slytherins arrived.  Theodore Nott and Pansy Parkinson arrived together.  Theo was nervous and looked quickly away when Hermione made eye contact.  Pansy, however, walked in brazen as you please and primly took a seat at their table.</span>
  <span> </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Granger.” She nodded.</span>
  <span> </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Parkinson.” Hermione replied coolly, “Tea?”</span>
  <span> </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Pansy nodded and accepted the proffered cup.  Another Slytherin girl entered the hall, with brown hair pulled into French braids. Pansy stood and excitedly greeted her. </span>
  <span> </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Tracey!  You came!”</span>
  <span> </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Eventually, they were all seated and taking tea.  There were a few awkward minutes of silence, but McGonagall filled them in nicely by asking after family and highlighting student interests.  There was one empty chair at the table and whoever was meant to occupy it was running very </span>
  <span>late.  Finally, at half-past two, Professor McGonagall turned in her seat towards the door.  Before Hermione could turn to see who it was, Ernie was on his feet drawing his wand.</span>
  <span> </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Draco Malfoy!”   </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ernie had shouted and Neville mirrored his actions. Though she didn’t stand, Hermione slid her wand into her hand under the table. </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mr. Macmillan!  Mr. Longbottom! Sit down at once and put those wands away!” </span>
  <span> </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Professor McGonagall’s voice was firm and had an edge of anger.</span>
  <span> </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But Professor – “</span>
  <span> </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sit!”</span>
  <span> </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Once Ernie and Neville were back in their seats, Professor McGonagall stood and gestured to the empty chair.</span>
  <span> </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mr. Malfoy do come in.  Please sit.”</span>
  <span> </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Pansy scooted over to make room for him and patted the empty chair invitingly.  Hermione rolled her eyes and Pansy glared at her in return.  As Draco walked toward them, Hermione took in his condition.  For someone who had recently been on trial he looked disgustingly well.  Not one blonde hair was out of place, his shoes were Italian leather, and his clothes were as fine as ever.  But the swagger she had come to expect was gone.  Malfoy didn’t make eye contact with her or any of the non-Slytherins.  Despite Pansy’s welcome and tight smiles from Theo and Tracey, Malfoy’s eyes were hard.  He seemed somehow both intently focused on and removed from all of them.  Separate.</span>
  <span> </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Well</span>
  </em>
  <span>, Hermione sniffed and started buttering a roll, </span>
  <em>
    <span>all the better for me.  The last thing I need is a strutting prancing Draco Malfoy.  </span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But despite this thought, Hermione found herself hyper-aware of him.  She was fixated on his hands as he fixed his tea.  His fingers were long and </span>
  <span>well-formed,</span>
  <span> but his hands shook when he tried to pour milk into his tea.  He set the milk down firmly and stared into his cup, glaring at it.</span>
  <span> </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well,” Professor McGonagall began, “that is everyone.  Welcome back for your eighth and final year.”</span>
  <span> </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione looked around the table surprised.  This was it?  These were the only people from her year who volunteered to come back?  Before she could dwell on that too much, Professor McGonagall continued,</span>
  <span> </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“While I am sure you all know each other, I think it would be best if we all went around and introduced ourselves.  Hermione?  Please begin.”</span>
  <span> </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>With all eyes on her, Hermione quickly and clumsily rose to her feet.</span>
  <span> </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“H-hermione Granger.”</span>
  <span> </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Cheeks flushed pink she sat down just as quickly.  Without standing, Su Li introduced herself.  The only other person Hermione didn’t know was the dark-skinned Ravenclaw girl next to Su.  This was quickly remedied as she introduced herself as Morag MacDougall.  Pansy and Tracey said their names.  Theo Nott raised his chin almost in a challenge when he introduced himself and Ernie made sure to puff out his chest so they could see his Head Boy badge.  Finally, they made it to Malfoy.  He smirked and then caught her eye.  Staring directly at her, he introduced himself, “Draco Malfoy.  Ex Death Eater.  Pleased to meet you.”</span>
  <span> </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>His gaze was intense, and Hermione lowered her eyes first.  She clutched her wrist under the table.  </span>
  <em>
    <span>What in the world was that?</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Professor McGonagall didn’t acknowledge Malfoy’s strange declaration.  Instead, she folded her hands and addressed them all in her crisp voice.  Hermione couldn’t help but notice that all their backs straightened as they gave McGonagall their full attention.  Hermione felt a giggle bubble </span>
  <span>up;</span>
  <span> McGonagall had never needed to try to exert her authority over her students.</span>
  <span> </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Now then, as you all are aware, you are here for your final year at Hogwarts.  Some of you are in fact repeating this final year.  N.E.W.T.s will be administered as usual and you will all be attending classes with the seventh years.  Often you will be in classes together and I trust you will all act like adults and not like a pack of wolves!”</span>
  <span> </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Here she paused and stared at them each meaningfully.</span>
  <span> </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The reason I have asked you all here a day early is not only because of your unique situation as students but also because all of you have been touched by the war.  Some of you fought in it, some of you have lost family and friends, and all of you have been personally affected by it.  This year, we will be instituting some changes here at Hogwarts.  One of them you have already seen.”</span>
  <span> </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Gesturing to the Great Hall she continued, “When rebuilding we have considered inter-house unity.  These round tables will be used instead of the traditional house tables.  We want to encourage all students, including you, to put aside differences and try to find common ground.  I expect all of you to set a proper example and encourage this in your fellow students.”</span>
  <span> </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Someone scoffed but Hermione didn’t catch who it was.  But considering McGonagall’s scowl, it looked like it had been Morag.  Quailing under the Headmistress’s glare, Morag quickly looked away mumbling an apology.  </span>
  <span> </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Due to your unique status as eighth years, you will not be residing in your house dormitories.”</span>
  <span> </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>This made Hermione gasp in alarm.  Ignoring Hermione’s outburst, McGonagall explained,</span>
  <span> </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <span>While you will be attending classes with your housemates, we have instead created a fifth dormitory for you.  You will all share a common room and you will each have your own private</span>
  <span> bed</span>
  <span>room.  Luckily the old magic of the castle protected the house common rooms and dormitories from too much damage.  So, if you wish to join your housemates in their common room, you are welcome to do so.  Now then if you are all finished with your tea, please follow me.”</span>
  <span> </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They all </span>
  <span>stood,</span>
  <span> and Professor McGonagall lead them up several flights of stairs and through corridors.  Trying to follow their progress, Hermione guessed they were somewhere on the third floor, funnily enough, near where Fluffy had guarded the Philosopher’s Stone their first year.  Finally, they stopped before a massive painting.  It was a landscape depicting a rolling field.  In it a sunny looking blonde girl was carrying a basket of brightly colored flowers.  She smiled at them all and waved. </span>
  <span> </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hello!  I’m </span>
  <span>Angharad!  I’ve never been a guardian portrait before!  I’m quite excited to meet you all!”</span>
  <span>  </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>A few of them mumbled hello and Hermione couldn’t help but smile.  Angharad’s enthusiasm was contagious.  Professor McGonagall said the password, (“unity”) and the portrait swung open.</span>
  <span>  As she entered, the first thing Hermione noticed were the floor to ceiling windows that gave them a view of the Black Lake. </span>
  <span>Different kinds of plants decorated the room, vines clung to the beams of the ceiling, cactuses were on the end tables, and roses bloomed over the fireplace.  The chairs were large and squishy reminding Hermione of Gryffindor’s common room and the walls were a lovely grey stone.  All the furniture was in cream and purple with rich mahogany wood.  Two doors in the far-right corner lead to the girls’ and boys’ sides respectively.</span>
  <span> </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The elves have already moved in your things so please make yourselves comfortable.  If you need anything one of the elves should be able to find me.  Dinner will be served at six in the Great Hall.”</span>
  <span> </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And with that, Professor McGonagall left, and they were all left staring at one another in silence.  Hermione sighed, </span>
  <em>
    <span>so much for normal</span>
  </em>
  <span>. </span>
  <span> </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>All the eighth years stood in the common room in various states of unease.  Pansy was the first to break the silence.  Flicking her black hair over her shoulder, she said loudly,</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, I for one am going to see what these private bedrooms look like.”</span>
  <span> </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Privately, Hermione was very curious about them too.  Students always roomed together at Hogwarts based on their year.  Though, considering Pansy and Tracey would have been her roommates, she probably should count herself lucky to get her own room.  Tracey followed Pansy and Morag and Su drifted to the bookshelves opposite the large windows.  Clearing his throat, Ernie announced,</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well being that I’m Head Boy, I had better get started working on patrol schedules!”  And he left out the portrait door for parts unknown.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Surprised you’re not going to get started on your Head Girl duties Granger.”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione jumped.  She was fairly certain the Theodore Nott had never said more than two words to her.  But there he was, sitting down and speaking to her like they were old friends.</span>
  <span>  Two could play at that game.  Sniffing delicately, Hermione sat in one of the chairs across from him.  </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, it would be pointless as I’m not Head Girl.”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Both Theo and Neville looked shocked.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hermione Granger not Head Girl?!  Someone ought to alert the Daily Prophet.”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rolling her eyes Hermione crossed her arms, “Hardly.  I turned it down.”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Theo looked confused, “Why?”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione shrugged and gave him the simple answer, the answer he’d probably expect. </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I need all the time I can to study for N.E.W.Ts.”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reaching into her magically extended beaded bag, she pulled out a notebook already filled with color-coded tabs.  In her swottiest voice, she continued,</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course, now I’ll have to consider any changes that McGonagall is making to scheduling to accommodate this new ‘inter-house unity.’”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Save us the start of your newest crusade Granger!  Some of us have better things to do.”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Pansy had returned and she settled on the arm of Theo’s chair.  Shoving her notebook back into her bag, Hermione marched off to find her bedroom.  Once in the girls’ side, she let out a groan.  The wooden doors all had their names written in a glowing golden script.  Hermione’s room was right next to Pansy’s.  Grumbling to herself, Hermione flung her door open with a bang and then slammed it behind her.  She leaned against the door and took her deep breaths.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I am calm.  I am safe. I am calm. I am safe.</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Feeling more grounded, she opened her eyes.  Her room had a little slit window that let in a decent amount of light.</span>
  <span>  There was a little bed identical to the one she’d had in the Gryffindor tower with a matching nightstand.  But rather than scarlet and gold, it had a purple coverlet and cream sheets following the theme of the common room.  A small wardrobe, a mirror, and a washstand were the other furniture in her room.  Her trunk had been brought up as had Crookshanks’s case.  Crookshanks himself was already curled up in her bed purring.  Hermione shook her head, of course, her familiar had already found his way up.  Hermione was suddenly exhausted.  Setting her purse on the nightstand she let herself fall face first into bed.  Before she knew it, she was asleep.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>***</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
  <span>When Hermione woke up light was shining through her bedroom window.  Her hair was plastered to the side of her face and she had drooled into her feather pillow.  Sitting up, her stomach growled loudly.  Crookshanks appeared to have let himself out in the night so Hermione pulled her hair into a rough ponytail and made her way into the common room.  She had been intending to go to the kitchen for some breakfast but was surprised to see two elves carrying trays.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good morning Miss!”  the male </span>
  <span>elf </span>
  <span>squeaked, “We is bringing you all some breakfast!  It is not much but we is very busy preparing for the feast tonight.”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thanking them both, Hermione sat down at the enlarged table and helped herself.  There were apples, oranges, toast with butter and jam, and croissants.  Coffee and tea were provided with milk and sugar.  As Hermione was peeling an orange, Tracey Davis entered the common room.  </span>
  <span>Hermione was surprised to see that Tracey was wearing muggle sweatpants and a track jacket.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I wasn’t expecting anyone to be awake yet,”  Tracey mumbled, sitting down and fixing herself some coffee.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I- I don’t know that we’ve ever met.” Hermione began sounding more helpless and awkward than she’d intended.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not really.”  Tracey agreed cautiously.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you</span>
  <span>…</span>
  <span> close friends with Pansy?”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tracey actually laughed, “Not until last year.  But then again,” </span>
  <span>here </span>
  <span>Tracey frowned, “A lot of things changed last year.”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione nodd</span>
  <span>ed</span>
  <span> nibbling on her orange slice.</span>
  <span>  Tracey took a deep breath and then dove in,</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m surprised you’d want to come back.  I was at the Final Battle, things got… intense.  It was hard enough coming back on my own.  So,</span>
  <span> I</span>
  <span> can’t imagine how you’re doing it.”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You were at the Final Battle?”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tracey frowned at Hermione’s shock, “I know everyone thin</span>
  <span>ks</span>
  <span> we’re evil, but I’m a half-blood.  Trust me when I say last year with the Carrows was no walk in the park.  So yeah,” Tracey glared, defensive, “I was there fighting with your lot.”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione didn’t know how to respond to that.  </span>
  <span>So,</span>
  <span> she just said,</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m glad you were there then.”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They both ate in silence until Hermione finally stood from the table.  When Tracey shot her a curious look, Hermione simply said,</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Going to Hogsmeade.  Errands.”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nodding, Tracey returned to her breakfast.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If anyone asks, I’ll tell them.”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Erm, thanks, Tracey.”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Using Tracey’s first name earned Hermione a small smile.  “No, thank </span>
  <em>
    <span>you</span>
  </em>
  <span> Gra- Hermione.”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>*** </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The rest of the day passed in a blur.  Hermione went to Hogsmeade and to the post office.  She’d had her mail on hold and informed the witch behind the counter that all her post could be forwarded to Hogwarts.  Then she spent a couple of hours in Tomes and Scrolls browsing and reading anything that caught her fancy.  Su Li entered the shop later but if she saw Hermione, she didn’t say hello.  Around lunch Hermione went to the Three </span>
  <span>Broomsticks</span>
  <span> and had some roast chicken and a butterbeer.  </span>
  <span>Finally,</span>
  <span> she made her way back to the castle to change for the Feast.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The day of reading and relaxation had made Hermione feel much more like her old self.  She hummed to herself as she changed into her school uniform and tried to do something with her hair.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Might be best if you braid it dear.”  The mirror suggested.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shrugging, Hermione took the mirror’s advice and meandered down to the common room.  When she left the portrait to head to the Great Hall the chattering of all the students grew louder as she made her way down to the first floor of the castle.  At the top of the steps of the entrance hall she heard a shout,</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hermione!”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Grinning, Ginny Weasley waved and rushed up to her.  A silence fell over the entrance hall and every student stopped to stare.  Hermione felt her face flush but tried to ignore everyone but Ginny.  Unfortunately, when she started walking down the stairs to meet the red-head </span>
  <span>slow applause began and built to a crescendo.  </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’ve got to be kidding me...” Ginny muttered.  Then, making a face that had her looking distinctly like the twins, she grabbed Hermione’s hand and started elbowing through the crowd.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Make way you lot!  Just want to get into the Hall!”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Once they’d pushed their way inside, Hermione spotted Neville and Luna sitting together at one of the new round tables.  Immediately making a beeline for them, Ginny pushed Hermione into a chair before sitting heavily herself.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’d think they never saw a war hero before.” Neville joked half-heartedly.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You get the hero’s welcome too?”  Ginny huffed, “And what’s with the tables?”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s for an inter-house unity initiative.” Hermione responded</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well I rather like them.” Luna smiled, “It’ll be nice to sit with friends.”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>There weren’t any more embarrassing moments during the rest of the feast.  The new first years were sorted into their respective houses and Hermione and Neville caught Ginny and Luna up on what life was going to be like for the eighth years.  Once dessert had been finished, Professor McGonagall rose to her feet.  The chatter immediately stopped.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Welcome back to Hogwarts.  For those of you who lived through the… the unpleasantness of last year, I wish to commend you for your bravery and resilience in the face of adversity.  A few announcements to begin the year.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>You will note that parts of the castle have been roped off for repairs and maintenance.  All students are to avoid these sections of the castle.  It can be </span>
  <span>dangerous,</span>
  <span> and you are not to get underfoot of our generous volunteers.  </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>As always, the Forbidden Forest is off-limits to all students unless under direct staff supervision.  As you all know, there are still Death Eaters at large and students are to keep to the grounds and curfew will be strictly enforced!”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>This last comment sparked a flurry of whispers and movement.  Hermione frowned.  She’d been under the impression </span>
  <span>that</span>
  <span> the</span>
  <span> most</span>
  <span> </span>
  <span>powerful</span>
  <span> Death Eaters had been captured and imprisoned.  </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yaxley, Avery, and some others are still out there.” Ginny whispered to Hermione, “Harry’s been working with the Aurors to track them down.”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We also have a few new staff members to introduce.” McGonagall continued slightly louder than before causing all the whispering to stop.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Please give a warm welcome to our new Defense Against the Dark Arts professor, Hestia Jones!”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hestia Jones stood and smiled warmly at them all as they all dutifully applauded.  </span>
  <span>Once Hestia had sat down again, McGonagall gestured farther down the staff table and continued,</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And we have a very special guest this year Mr. Rolf Scamander.  Mr. Scamander will be assisting Professor Hagrid teaching Care of Magical Creatures and working on some personal research.  I expect you all to treat him with the same respect you would any of your other professors.”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rolf Scamander was tall with curly brown hair and was incredibly handsome.  He stood and gave a short wave to them all.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Merlin,” Ginny whispered, “he’s gorgeous!”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>To Hermione’s surprise, Luna giggled.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Finally, w</span>
  <span>e expect all students to put aside any former conflicts and work towards a more united </span>
  <span>time ahead</span>
  <span>.  </span>
  <span>You are all here to learn and we expect that you will all cooperate to earn house points, study, and make this year a peaceful one.  That said, t</span>
  <span>his year we will be planning and holding several special events for fostering inter-house cooperation and unity.  </span>
  <span>Anyone interested in volunteering for event planning and execution should speak with their heads of house.  That is all!”</span>
  <span> </span>
  <span> </span>
