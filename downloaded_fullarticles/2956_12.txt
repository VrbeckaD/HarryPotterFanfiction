    <p>It all started when a young man called Garrick was wandering through the forest to search some sticks for his wands.<br/>
He picked some sticks from a tree, but he noticed that something was moving in the bushes, he went to see whats happening, a young faun woman, with blonde hair, green eyes,horns…,she was wearing an old dress.<br/>
Garrick: hello<br/>
???:  are you a mortal?<br/>
Garrick: im Garrick ollivanderr,nice to meet you.<br/>
The faun woman looked at him with confusion.<br/>
???: im mephis.., why are you here?<br/>
Garrick: im just here to find some materials to my wands.<br/>
Mephis: what´s a wand?<br/>
Garrick: oh, I almost forgot.., a wand is a wizard´s know weapon, and well I work as a wand maker at ollivanders, is in diagon alley.<br/>
Mephis: what?,who?,where?<br/>
Garrick: well, maybe i´ll show you that, follow me.<br/>
Mephis followed the young man, they were at some hill with a tree.<br/>
Mephis: what´s that?<br/>
Garrick:it’s a camera, this how it works, well smile!.<br/>
After they made the photo, mephis looked at the photo.<br/>
Mephis: it´s moving!<br/>
Garrick: is because of magic.<br/>
Mephis: magic?, what´s that?<br/>
Garrick: don’t worry, in diagon alley yours questions will be replied.</p><p>Then they arrived to diagon alley, Mephis looked amazed that mortals were doing some magic stuff, she saw some shops, she also notice that people looked disgusted at her.<br/>
Garrick: this is my shop: ollivanders, nice… that shop is  honeydukes, you can go, here have some money.<br/>
Later, he was in his shop, then he saw mephis holding a ton of sweets and candies, she was eating a cauldron cake.<br/>
Garrick: oh god, did you bought the entire store?<br/>
Mephis: no, I took the lot and I was eating this cauldron thing and it’s my favorite, so, where I should put all of this.<br/>
Garrick: on that table.<br/>
Mephis stare at the candies, she took a package that contained some candies.<br/>
Garrick: those are bertie bott´s every flavor be..<br/>
He was shocked after he saw that mephis ate the whole package.<br/>
Garrick: did you know that every flavor means every flavor.<br/>
Mephis: it tasted kinda funny.<br/>
Then Mephis took a lemon shaped candy, she tried to read the label of the container: sherber lemon, she ate one of the sweets, but she didn’t like that.<br/>
After that day, mephis stayed with Garrick, they were like a couple, and he taught her about this wizarding world.<br/>
Garrick: remember Mephis, the wand chooses the wizard.<br/>
Mephis: is the wizard that chooses the wand, a wooden stick can’t choose someone.</p><p>But one day, they were at the same hill with the tree.<br/>
Garrick: look mephis, I made this for you, it’s a wand with your name on it.<br/>
Mephis:…<br/>
Garrick: you want to say something, let said this both, ok.<br/>
Garrick: 1,2,3…I love y-<br/>
Mephis: we should me other people.<br/>
Garrick:What?,why?<br/>
Mephis: I know that is gonna sound like a pain in the ass, but.., I don’t date mortals, we don’t date mortals.<br/>
Garrick: what do you mean?, I was thinking about being together.<br/>
Mephis: hold your horses, im a monster, a faun, we don’t date humans,ok, also, I don’t want to spend my life making magic sticks, so, thanks for everything, im going to my home.<br/>
Then mephis go away from that hill, Garrick saw her at the distance.<br/>
(cassy: watch this eldain, you can actually pinpoint the second when his heart rips in half, and…Now)</p><p>The young heartbroken man returned to his shop, he left the wand in the amount of wands.</p>
