    <p>Hermione rushes out of the girls’ dormitory, tears streaming down her face, covering her mouth in an effort to not wake the other girls.</p><p>Crookshanks is missing.</p><p>She’s kept him locked in her room at night, ever sense Hogwarts security increased. Out of fear he’ll be caught in the crossfire or used to send a gruesome message. He’s hated the change. Most nights, Hermione has had to snuggle him to her chest until he stops resisting and falls asleep. He’ll cry otherwise, which she knows is part of the process, but her roommates—</p><p>One of them must have let him out well she was asleep. If anything happens to him—</p><p>She stops dead in the middle of the hallway. Luna Lovegood wears an expression of mild surprise, though that doesn’t necessarily mean anything when it comes to her. “Lovely evening, isn’t it? I haven’t had to hide once.”</p><p>“What—” her voice is shaky, “What are you doing out?”</p><p>“I’m looking for my potions book, someone’s taken it again,”<b> </b>Luna says. “But I suppose I could be asking you the same question.”</p><p>“Crookshanks he— My cat, I left him in my dorm last night and now he’s gone.” She adds: “I know he’s probably alright, but—” </p><p>“I’ve never had a pet,” she interrupts, “But my things always have a way of coming back to me. I could help you look through. Keep watch, whatever you need…” Hermione lets out a small, unexpected sob, and wraps her arms around Luna, taking her by surprise.</p><p>Of course Luna is the best person to run into at 03:00 when she can’t find her cat. Of course.</p><p>A moment later, Luna lightly pats her head and Hermione laughs, a chocked thing. But she knows it’ll be alright. </p><p>“I can help you find your book, too. After we find Crookshanks.”</p><p>“I’d like that; the company.”</p>
