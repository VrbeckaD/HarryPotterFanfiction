  <span>Sirius received the letter on a Wednesday - he had just finished moving into the apartment (well, he was still living out of boxes and suitcases, but all his things were present), had filled the fridge with the necessities, and James, who had been drinking himself asleep every night, was actually sober and not moping. It had been a good day for them both. Until the letter came. It had been addressed in inky script by an elegant and practiced hand - his mother's - and the envelope was made out of such high-quality paper that he was, for a moment, surprised that they had wasted it on him. Inside was a small square piece of paper, with the words a mess compared to the elegance of the script on the envelope. </span>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>
    <span>Regulus is dead. He would've wanted you to know. Don't come to the funeral. -W. Black</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Suddenly, it became a not-so-good day, and that pub next door seemed like a good idea. </span>
</p><p><span>*</span> <span>*</span> <span>*</span></p><p>
  <span>Remus hadn't exactly planned on working in a beat-up New York City bar, but he actually enjoyed it for the most part. There would be an occasional rude alcoholic, but usually the customers were polite and talkative, if a bit enraged, and were happy to share even the most personal facts with Remus - the alcohol helped. He found that he also had a knack for guessing the drinks that people were going to order based on their facial expressions - him and Lily, the other bartender (who probably was the reason for half of the customers, as good female bartenders were an endangered species), made a game of it. She wasn't nearly as good as him, but she was much better at actually making the drinks. So far today, Remus had gotten 17 orders correct out of 18 (the lady with the pug ordered a martini with </span>
  <em>
    <span>a twist</span>
  </em>
  <span>, rather than an olive), and Lily 4 out of 24. He took pride in this talent, since, outside of his academic pursuits, it was his only one. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>His 19th customer looked like three shots of Vodka chased by a pint of beer. He had long hair tied in a bun at the back of his head, and was wearing one of the most disgusting t-shirts Remus had ever seen (the stains looked suspiciously similar to sweet-and-sour sauce) under a large leather jacket. Remus held up the bottle of Absolut Vodka, questioningly, and the customer nodded gratefully. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Just what I needed,” he stated, placing his forearms on the bar and leaning his chin on it, watching Remus pour a shot as professionally as he could. “I’ve had the worst </span>
  <em>
    <span>fucking</span>
  </em>
  <span> day.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus nodded, sliding the shot towards him. The customer just looked at it for a few seconds before sitting up and downing it, then returning to his former position. “Another one?” Remus asked, taking the empty glass.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The customer shook his head. “Not yet. I’m gonna let this one work its magic first, mate, but thanks.” Remus nodded - not incorrect, but not correct </span>
  <em>
    <span>yet</span>
  </em>
  <span> - and returned to the tedious task of drying glasses and placing them on the correct shelves. “I’m Sirius, by the way.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus picked up a whiskey glass and began wiping it off. “Remus,” he said concisely, nodding to Sirius as a greeting with a smile. “So, what’s your story?” This was his favourite part of the job, the personal stories that somehow got shared through alcohol.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What do you mean?” Sirius responded, looking up at Remus from his position on top of the counter. He looked exhausted in a way that people only did after a trauma; a sloppy, pitiable exhaustion that consisted not of sweatpants on the couch but, rather, not getting out of bed for weeks. Remus was himself familiar with this exhaustion. It came with pain and insomnia and tears and then a lack of tears and not many showers. Sirius looked a bigger mess than even the usual patrons.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus shrugged in response. “It’s barely seven in the evening, and you’re here alone. Not to pry, but I’m curious. I’m also a lot cheaper than a therapist.” He placed the glass on the counter next to him and dropped the rag along with it, grabbing his glass of water and taking a sip, letting Sirius have some time to contemplate his offer. He put his glass down and checked the orders - table 6 wanted a Mojito. Sticky </span>
  <em>
    <span>and</span>
  </em>
  <span> time-consuming. Great. He grabbed a couple of mint leaves and some limes, and reached for the sugar. The shaker was already on the counter, and he poured in the rum and added ice.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My parents suck,” Sirius suddenly said. Remus looked up. He was still lying on his forearms, watching Remus make the drink. “I was cut off when I was, I don’t know, sixteen. They were racist, and homophobic, and … just generally assholes.” He paused, watching Remus break up the mint sprigs and add them to the rum, along with the sugar.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Now, </span>
  <em>
    <span>that</span>
  </em>
  <span>, I’m familiar with,” Remus muttered. He grabbed a lime and rolled it to get more juice out, then sliced it in two and put it in the citrus squeezer. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius cleared his throat. “Yeah, well, my mother just wrote and told me that my brother died.” Remus didn’t know what to say to that, so he just kept working quietly, topping the drink off with club soda. It didn’t seem like Sirius wanted pity or empathy, and Remus knew first-hand that nothing helped in the face of a loss like that. He put the finished drink on the end of the counter and within seconds, Lily was dancing his way to grab the drink with a grin.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Remus, another therapy session?” she joked, grabbing a peanut from the bowls on the bar and swiftly throwing it in her mouth. “You should have majored in psychiatry instead of the numbers and things you’re doing now. It seems to come natural to you.” Sirius didn’t move a muscle, but rather closed his eyes for a second.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sure that it would be very useful to be able to diagnose surgical patients with depression,” Remus answered, handing Lily a coaster to bring with the drink. “Now go, Lils. They’ve been waiting a while.” Lily grinned and turned away.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius opened his eyes again. “I’ll take that second shot now, please.” Remus nodded and did as asked, placing the shot glass carefully in front of him. Sirius downed it right away this time, before leaning back down on his forearms and fixing his dark eyes on Remus, who desperately tried to look busy in response so he didn’t have to make eye contact. “You’re going to be a surgeon?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I hope so. Neurosurgeon, if I can manage to pay my tuition through medical school.” He cleared his throat, uncomfortable with questions being directed at him for once, and ducked under the bar to check how much lime and lemon juice they had left. He wanted something to do with his hands, but found both jars nearly full. He popped back up again, cheeks tinged pink. “So, what about you? School?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I just graduated from NYU with a degree in political science. My rich hermit uncle set aside money for my education before he croaked so I didn’t have to worry about tuition, despite the lack of support from my beloved parents.” He sniffed, closing his eyes again. “Where do you study?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Columbia,” Remus answered carefully. “I’m a junior now.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius kept his eyes closed, but started tapping his fingers on the bar. “I liked Columbia. Was rejected, of course, given my antics senior year. Do you know a Frank? I don’t know his last name. He’s tall and overly polite and is dating a girl named Alice something-or-other.” He opened his eyes to look at Remus, who shook his head. “Eh, now if you see him you’ll know. What about, uh, Mary MacDonald?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus nodded, “Lily and her are really good friends, they’re in a lot of the same art classes.” He then added, for clarification, “Lily is the, you know, other bartender. Anyway, I’ve met Mary a couple of times. How do you know her?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius closed his eyes once more. “Dated her. A while. Could I have another shot?” Remus poured one as fast as possible, spilling a little over the edge, and watched as Sirius sat up (with some effort) to down his third shot. Only a beer and Remus would be 18 out of 19. “Ugh, I hate vodka. My best friend, James, knew her from a very young age. They’re.. y’know.. friends. Family friends. All old money families know each other.” He leaned against the counter again, but kept his eyes on Remus. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He liked relying on the customer, drunk and sad, to make conversation and talk. He took another sip of water, chewed on his bottom lip, then decided to shamelessly pry: “were you and your brother close?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, not recently. Until I left for boarding school, I s’pose. He fell in with the wrong crowd, and I was disowned, and that was it. My parents brainwash people.” He sat up straight, stretched his arms over his head, then propped his chin up on his hand. “Since we’re now friends, I expect you to vehemently oppose my parents with your entire being.” Remus let out a short laugh at that, making brief eye contact with Sirius’ dark eyes (that looked like they knew too much) before throwing a glance towards the sound of the door opening–three young women in business attire. Usually good tips. When he looked back, Sirius was face down on the bar. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You good?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m just ruminating on the sliminess of my parents in the face of my brother’s death,” he responded, muted by his position.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus didn’t feel the need to respond, thinking that he needed time to think to himself, so he picked up another glass to dry. Twelve glasses later, Sirius still hadn’t moved. Remus carefully prodded his head, with no response. He, naturally, started worrying that Sirius was dead, so he, with a lot of effort, turned Sirius’ head to check if he was breathing. He got his answer when Sirius let out a loud snore.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh. Okay,” Remus looked around for a second. He didn’t know what to do. People usually didn’t fall asleep when he was working, since he never had a shift after 10 p.m. He tried to get Lily’s attention, but to no avail. He walked around to the other side of the bar, and poked Sirius in the arm. “Hey, Sirius. Sirius,” he tried, pushing his arm. “Time to wake, Sirius. You’ve gotta have a beer, otherwise I’ll be 17 of 19, which is clearly </span>
  <em>
    <span>not</span>
  </em>
  <span> as good.” He shook him gently, but Sirius only groaned before moving away slightly from Remus’ touch. “Okay.” He didn’t like the idea of calling over the barback, who would have unceremoniously thrown Sirius out on his ass, so instead he checked Sirius’ pocket for an address book (because maybe he was still living in the ‘50’s) and found an outdated iPhone. Luckily he had no password. The first name on the starred contacts was </span>
  <em>
    <span>James, Not Bond</span>
  </em>
  <span>, who Sirius had mentioned, so Remus pressed call. James, Not Bond picked up immediately.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Are you on your way home? I ordered pizza and don’t have a tip.” </span>
  </em>
  <span>James, Not Bond was a deep voice with a hint of an accent and seemingly no sign of common sense.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hi, uh, James?” Remus asked hesitantly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He heard a cough. </span>
  <em>
    <span>“Yeah, who is this? Did you rob Sirius? I’m tellin’ you, this phone is worth ten bucks at most.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus cleared his throat and tried to poke Sirius awake again. “No, not quite, actually. Sirius fell asleep at the bar. At </span>
  <em>
    <span>Hokie’s</span>
  </em>
  <span>. On 43rd and Broadway. I would rather he be brought home to a bed than thrown out and I definitely can’t carry him.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He let out a bark of a laugh at that, then kept going lightheartedly, "</span>
  <em>
    <span>Sorry! I’ll be there in a second.”</span>
  </em>
  <span> James hung up without further ado. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Five minutes later, a disheveled man burst through the door. He had short, impressively messy hair and glasses, and he laughed as soon as he saw Sirius’ collapsed form. “I’m James,” he said, extending his hand. Remus shook it politely, “and I assume you’re the one that stole Sirius’ shit phone.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, actually, I decided not to, after you alerted me of its lack of value. I’m Remus.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nice to meet you!” James was all smiles. He was tall and tan, with light stubble covering a sharp jaw, a tiny earring in one ear and crooked glasses on a strong nose. “Sorry about my brother, he’s a drama queen when he wants to be.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus wondered about the ‘brother’ comment, but didn’t mention it. Instead, he motioned to Sirius, who had more muscle than Remus could even dream of, and asked, “Do you need help carrying him? I can try, or– or the barback. Unless you’re Wonder Woman under that sweater.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>James grinned, responded, “I can’t confirm or deny being Wonder Woman, but I can handle </span>
  <em>
    <span>him</span>
  </em>
  <span>. Could I have a glass of water?” Remus filled one up quickly with the soda gun and handed it to James, who proceeded to splash a good amount in Sirius’s face. The man in question flailed wildly, but opened his eyes immediately, shocked. James pulled him to a standing position, and leaned him on his shoulder as he practically pulled a still-sputtering Sirius out of the door. Before the door closed, he turned back to Remus and said, loudly, “Sorry about the mess. It was a pleasure, Rem!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And that’s how Remus Lupin met Sirius Black.</span>
