<p>Hi. I am Lady Russell Holmes, writer extraordinaire. This is my fic, and my ego sincerely hopes that you will like it enough to review. I have more than 200 pages already written for this fic on paper, of which this chapter is only the first 4 1/2, so I actually plan to finish this. A few words of explanation may be in order. This is in the summer after Harry’s fourth year, if it isn’t obvious, and I am insane. There. That’s all the explanation I have yet. More may come, just be patient. Oh, I suppose I need a disclaimer as well, don’t I?</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER!!!!!!! Pay attention, because this is the only disclaimer that I am going to write, unless you give me trouble. I DO NOT OWN HARRY POTTER, OR ANY RELATED PARAPHERNALIA!!!!! That is the inestimable privilege of Joanne K. Rowling, another writer extraordinaire. I’m just using him as a plaything, I am very rough on my toys, and I most definitely do not plan to return him in ‘like-new’ condition. So sue me, but all you’ll get is...(looks around room and checks pockets) 67 cents, 72 Francs and a very peculiar cat. Oh, wait, forget the cat: he owns me, not vice-versa.</p>
<p>Chapter 1</p>
<p>It was a quiet breakfast Friday morning at the Dursley’s, with Aunt Petunia and Dudley gone to London for the weekend, when Harry saw the owl at the window. Surprised, because owls usually came to his bedroom window, not the kitchen, he crossed the room and let it in. Vernon, at the table, looked apoplectic, but then Vernon had looked that way since Harry had come home for the summer, 4 weeks ago. He had lost his job at Grunnings, over an issue of embezzlement, and he was very irritable, even towards Dudley, but as always, especially towards Harry. Now his eyes drilled into Harry as he untied the letter from the owl’s leg. As he let the owl back out, Vernon slammed his glass of scotch onto the table, the first sound since the owl had tapped on the glass.</p>
<p>“Where do you get off letting a filthy bird into Petunia’s clean kitchen?” he demanded, his face gone red already.</p>
<p>“She didn’t touch anything,” replied Harry absently as he examined the envelope in his hands. It had his address on the front in a reddish ink. He flipped it over and his puzzlement grew. The wax seal on the back was imprinted with the crest of Gringott’s Bank. Why would Gringott’s send him a letter? Was he out of money? Harry opened the letter with trepidation, but Vernon snatched it from his hands before he could begin to read it.</p>
<p>“Hey! That’s mine!”</p>
<p>“So? Rubbish! What is this Gringott’s?” Vernon said contemptuously, but his eyes continued to scan the parchment. Suddenly, they froze, and a slow smile spread across his face. Harry’s stomach dropped. He remembered telling Hagrid once that the Dursley’s fear of all things wizard would not include a pile of gold. It would seem he was right.</p>
<p>Calm now, Vernon looked up. He handed Harry back his letter, still grinning in a way that reminded Harry of Fred and George, but with more avarice than mischief. To avoid Vernon’s eyes, he looked down at the letter. It was written in black ink, in a jagged script.</p>
<p>Mr. Potter,</p>
<p>This is an accounting review. For you convenience, we have provided sums in both Wizarding and Muggle currencies.</p>
<p>Below the short paragraph was a long list of numbers which Harry recognized as amount of Galleons, Sickles, and Knuts, divided into withdrawals and interest, as well as a total which more than explained Vernon’s good mood.</p>
<p>“This can’t be right,” stuttered Harry. “There isn’t this much gold in my vault.” He realized what he had said when Vernon pounced on him, his smile gone.</p>
<p>“You’ve had this money the whole time, haven’t you,” he hissed. “You ungrateful bastard! We took you in, raised you, supported you your entire life.” Harry had heard these words before, but what frightened him this time was Vernon’s grip on his upper arm. He could feel his fingers pressing into his arm, deep enough that his bones felt crushed. “You’ve been hiding a fortune from us, boy!” the man ground out.</p>
<p>Harry looked at the parchment again. Vernon was right. It <em>was</em> a fortune. According to the letter, Harry Potter was in sole possession of 310,344,827 Galleons, 10 Sickles, and 11 Knuts. A very respectable sum in its own right, but when translated into British Pounds, it was incredible.</p>
<p>“9 <em>billion</em> Pounds,” breathed Harry, unable to believe what his eyes told him.</p>
<p>“That’s right, boy,” sneered Vernon, his smirk returning. And I think it’s high time that I collected what you owe me.”</p>
<p>Harry just looked at him. A coldness began to grow in his chest and he pulled his arm from his uncle’s bruising grasp. “Owe you?” he laughed. “<em>You </em>should owe <em>me</em>! Retribution for a childhood without love, without any rights as a human being.”</p>
<p>“But you’re not a human being boy,” said Vernon in a low voice. Harry realized that his uncle was drunk, or nearly so. “You’re a freak, an unnatural parasite, and we gave you shelter, food. Be grateful, boy!” He was roaring now, and had Harry’s arm again. Harry tried to pull away, but his time, his uncle’s grip was too strong. Vernon leaned into Harry’s face and spoke, softly, threateningly.</p>
<p>“What’s yours should be mine, freak. If you were dead, it would be mine.”</p>
<p>Harry couldn’t believe they were having this conversation. “It wouldn’t,” he said, just as softly. “I wrote my will last year. Dumbledore witnessed it. Everything I own is left to my friends and my Godfather.” He felt distant. This wasn’t really happening, was it?</p>
<p>Vernon purpled, and then his eyes left Harry’s. They now held a calculating look. He looked back. “Then you’ll just have to <em>give</em> the money to me.” He tightened his grip, but Harry ignored it.</p>
<p>“You’re cracked.” he said succinctly. He tried to pull away one last time, and Vernon snapped.</p>
<p>“You will not disobey me!” he roared. He pushed Harry face-first into the wall, twisting his right arm behind his back. Harry struggled, but stopped immediately as he felt his shoulder begin to burn from the unnatural angle at which it was held.</p>
<p>“Now,” hissed Vernon into his ear. “Consider carefully.” He sounded dead sober now. “Will you pay me what I am owed?”</p>
<p>Harry was biting his lip against the pain, but he knew instinctively that, if he gave in, this would happen again. “I don’t owe you anything.”</p>
<p>It happened so fast. Vernon yanked Harry’s arm <em>up</em> suddenly and Harry felt his elbow just... come apart. The small cracking sound filled the kitchen, before it was drowned out by Harry’s scream. Vernon slammed his head into the wall to shut him up.</p>
<p>“You get another chance to answer me correctly, freak.” In his mouth, the last word held the timbre of an Unforgivable curse.</p>
<p>As he sank to the floor, cradling his elbow, Harry retained at least some presence of mind. “No,” he said. “I won’t.”</p>
<p>Vernon laughed, a harsh bark. He grabbed Harry’s newly broken elbow and hauled him to his feet. “You’re too <em>brave</em>,” and the word was a sneer, “for your own good.” Harry blacked out from the pain in his arm as Vernon threw him roughly against the table, into a chair.</p>
<p>He came to with his cheek lying in a puddle of spilt milk. Only a moment must have passed, for Vernon was still there, but now he held... Harry’s eyes widened. His uncle now held a knife.</p>

<p>Hi. It’s me again. Thanks very much to my first two reviewers, Kim and ---------. Lookie how fast I got Chapter two up!!! I can’t promise I’ll always be this fast, but hey! I’ll try. I’m now up to page 10 out of 208 *on paper*, so I’ve got a lot of material, especially since I plan to continue feeding it to you in itty bitty chunks. Mwahahahhaha!</p>
<p>Chapter 2</p>
<p>Harry managed to sit up, but he groaned as his elbow shifted, bones grinding painfully together. Quick as a snake, Vernon grabbed his wrist, pinning the broken arm to the table. Harry refused point-blank to scream again as his uncle dug the point of the knife into the web of soft tissue between thumb and forefinger.</p>
<p>“I won’t give in,” said Harry through gritted teeth, more to himself than to his uncle. Vernon looked up. “You will,” was his only response. Suddenly, the knife swiveled to lie across the base of his thumb. Harry saw it coming, but it only took one stroke.</p>
<p>A part of Harry watched with only concern as his flesh parted, as Uncle Vernon wriggled the blade to find the gap between the bones and drove it through to the wood of the table.</p>
<p>The rest of him was screaming.</p>
<p>His uncle freed the knife from the table and brought it to hover over the next finger. He looked up into Harry’s sweating face. “Well?” he growled, grinning.</p>
<p>Harry looked at his thumb, lying there, separate, on the table, and he began to shake. “I’ll do it,” he sobbed. “I’ll do anything you want. Just... don’t.” He wept as he slowly drew his maimed hand and arm against his chest, cradling them there as tears ran freely down his face.</p>
<p>Harry, wrapped in his pain, hadn’t heard his uncle leave the room, but now he returned, tossing a first aid kit in front of him.</p>
<p>“Clean yourself up,” he ordered, sounding bored. “And then we’re going to this ‘Gringott’s.’” Vernon watched impassively as Harry fumbled with the gauze and tape. When he finally had the stump covered, he threw a wad of cloth at the boy. Harry recognized it as one of his school robes, but without the house badge - Harry could see where Vernon had ripped it away - it looked just like any other wizarding garment.</p>
<p>“Put that on,” snapped Vernon. “It’ll hide your arm.”</p>
<p>Harry struggled into the robes, not even trying to thread his injured arm into the sleeve. Against his will, he looked back to his uncle for instruction.</p>
<p>Vernon smirked to see this. “Let’s go.”</p>
<p>They were at the car when Harry remembered. “I’ll need my wand.”</p>
<p>“Oh no, you don’t,” growled Vernon. “I’m not stupid.</p>
<p>He wasn’t, Harry realized, but he explained, “I can’t get into Diagon Alley, where Gringott’s Bank is, without it.” He hated how meek his voice sounded, cracked with pain and fear, but he could muster nothing stronger.</p>
<p>Only half-convinced, Vernon followed Harry upstairs and stood over him as he opened his cache under the floorboards, which was where he kept his wand. Before he could close it again, Vernon’s hand swept down to grab something out.</p>
<p>“What’s this?” he asked, sounding speculative. Before Harry could answer, he glared at him, daring him to lie. Harry found he couldn’t.</p>
<p>“That’s a Galleon,” he said tiredly.</p>
<p>“Is it real gold?”</p>
<p>“Wizard gold,” qualified Harry, standing up. Not saying anything further, he turned, and submissively followed Vernon to the car.</p>
<p>The ride from Little Whinging to London was long and nearly silent. Harry huddled against the passenger side door, as far away as he could get from his uncle. When Harry had directed Vernon where in London to go, and they had parked, Vernon turned to him. “Listen, freak. If you play me false, this,” he said, grabbing Harry’s mangled elbow and shaking it. “Will feel like a papercut. You had better act whichever way passes for normal with these freaks of yours, you hear me?” His voice was an ominous mutter that chilled Harry to the bone. He nodded fervently, hating himself for doing so.</p>
<p>They got out and crossed the crowded sidewalk. Harry headed straight for the Leaky Cauldron, but when he reached the door, Vernon wasn’t behind him. He looked around and saw him looking into the storefront next door. For a brief second, Harry considered running into the Leaky Cauldron and calling for help, but then his uncle looked at him and the momentary courage drained away.</p>
<p>“It’s here, Uncle Vernon,” he called dispiritedly. “You can’t see it because you’re a muggle. Just follow me closely.” Vernon grasped Harry’s right shoulder in an over-firm mockery of camaraderie and Harry led him into the tiny pub. Vernon looked about at the dark, dusty room with disapproval, but Harry led him straight through and out back into the miniscule courtyard. “I need my wand now.” Vernon hadn’t let him have it in the car, but gave it to him now. Harry tapped the appropriate brick and stepped back to watch as the wall folded itself back from the entry to Diagon Alley. Vernon paled, but didn’t say anything as the noise from the crowd beyond surrounded them.</p>
<p>Harry threaded their way through the throng, his uncle’s hand still heavy on his shoulder, to the white edifice that was Gringott’s Wizard Bank. As they mounted the marble steps, a goblin in a hurry pushed past them. Vernon stared after it. “What was that?” he hissed into Harry’s ear.</p>
<p>“A goblin,” replied Harry despondently. “They run Gringott’s”</p>
<p>Approaching the desk at the head of the hall, Vernon gawked openly, but stayed silent. Harry drew near to the goblin at the desk. “I need to get into my vault, please?” he asked quietly, and produced the key, which he kept on a fine length of chain around his neck. The goblin took it and examined it before speaking.</p>
<p>“Very well,” he said. He returned the key to Harry, along with a canvas sack, and he called over another goblin to lead them into the labyrinth of vaults. According to the review, a full twenty of them were filled with Harry’s fortune.</p>
<p>Uncle Vernon sat rigidly for the entire trolley ride down to Harry’ vault, never releasing the boy’s shoulder. When the cart stopped, he slumped slightly, but regained his composure quickly. “Let’s go then, boy,” he said, but the tone of his voice said ‘freak.’</p>
<p>Vernon’s eyes grew hard with greed as the vault was unlocked, revealing the mounds of gold and silver therein. He left Harry standing at the door as he shoveled Galleons and Sickles into the empty sack, filling it as full as he could. When he was done, he had to enlist the goblin’s help in lifting it into the cart. After they had returned to the surface, he made Harry direct him to the exchange desk, and then sent him out to the car.</p>
<p>His uncle had left the car locked, so Harry stood beside it until Vernon emerged from the Leaky Cauldron. He looked insufferably pleased with himself as he riffled the bundle of bills in his hands. “A profitable morning,” he chuckled to Harry as he unlocked the car and they got in. Harry cringed away as his uncle leaned towards him. “Listen well now, freak. As long as you continue to do what I say, with no argument whatsoever, I won’t have to do that,” he tapped the bandage that concealed the stump of Harry’s thumb, “again. You hear me?” Harry nodded frantically. “Good,” said Vernon. “When we get home, the first thing that you are going to do is get rid of that bird. I don’t care how, just get rid of it.” Ignoring Harry’s half-stiffled cry of protest, he continued. “And then, you are going to move all of your stuff back into the closet.”</p>
<p>When they were back at Privet Drive, Vernon stood over Harry as he sent a sleepy Hedwig to Ron’s, explaining carefully to her that she couldn’t come back. When she was gone, Harry gathered his stuff awkwardly and dragged his trunk one-handedly down the stairs. Vernon had to manhandle it into he closet, and then he shoved Harry in on top of it. Harry clouted his broken arm against the doorjamb and screamed before Vernon slammed the door shut. He heard his uncle’s heavy footsteps fade over the pain that shrilled in his ears and his own sobbing breath.</p>

<p>Look how fast this fic is growing! You know, I can’t keep up this rate, forever. School starts next week. I will do my best then, but no more guarantee of daily postings.</p>
<p>Chapter 3</p>
<p>The next day, when Aunt Petunia and Dudley got home, Harry was still locked away in his cupboard. From the sound of things, Vernon met them at the door and, from Petunia’s exclamation, Harry guessed that Vernon had showed her the money. He wasn’t surprised therefore when, after a moment, footsteps approached his cupboard and the door slammed open against the wall. He squinted against the sudden light to see Aunt Petunia standing there.</p>
<p>“Is this true? Have you been hiding a fortune from us?” she questioned him angrily. Harry remained silent until Vernon, who was standing behind his wife, reached around her to drag Harry out by his broken arm. He shouted in pain as the bone ends slid roughly against one another. He could see one now, pressing up under against his skin. It nauseated him.</p>
<p>Petunia looked at Harry’s arm, and then she looked at her husband. A look of unease entered her face. Vernon saw it and grimaced.</p>
<p>“Petunia,” he whined. “This freak’s been holding out on us. If it weren’t for him, you would have inherited when your sister and her freak of a husband got themselves blown up. Just look at this!” He brandished the crumpled letter from Gringott’s, shoving it into her hand. “He’s had heaps of gold and silver squirreled away this whole time while he let us scrimp and save to raise him right. He owes us every cent.” Vernon threw Harry back into the cupboard and locked him in. Harry huddled in the dark as his aunt and uncle raged at one another outside. They had fought like this before, but as the screaming went on and on, a feeling of dread possessed him.</p>
<p>At length, it was justified when the front door slammed. Before Petunia’s car had skidded out of the driveway, Vernon reappeared at the cupboard door. He was a terrifying sight, with his hair wild and his face as red as the Hogwart’s Express, as he dragged Harry into the hall. “Petunia just left,” he growled. “Because of you! She took Dudley, and <em>left me</em>!” He fastened his hands around Harry’s neck. “And it’s all your fault!!”</p>
<p>Harry struggled ineffectually. A little part of his mind removed itself from the situation. -Ha!- it said. -I’m safe here from Voldemort, the most powerfully evil wizard ever, and my uncle is about to kill me!- -No!- the rest of him cried out. “I don’t want to die!”</p>
<p>“Will,” he croaked out, hoping Vernon’s greed would overcome his fury. It worked. Vernon relaxed his grip. “My will. If I die,” Harry reminded him hoarsely, “Ron and Hermione and Sirius get all of the money, and it will be lost to you.” The ploy got through. Vernon dropped his hands, still glaring at Harry.</p>
<p>“You’re going to write a new will, freak.” His voice was chill and Harry’s insides froze. Vernon was going to kill him, just for money.</p>
<p>“I can’t,” Harry lied quickly. “Dumbledore has to witness any changes, or it’s not legal. Do you want him to see me like this?” Now he was relying on his uncle’s fear of wizards as he held up his bandaged hand. “I don’t think that he would be very happy.”</p>
<p>Vernon stood back at this for a moment before he slammed Harry back against the wall and stormed, growling, out of the room. Harry slid down to slump on the floor, but he barely had time to contemplate whether or not he could reach the door and run, well, stagger for help before Vernon was back.</p>
<p>“Let’s go,” he said tersely, and he pulled Harry up. Harry cried out and Vernon twisted the arm farther. He looked at the now-malformed arm and then up at Harry’s face and seemed to make a decision. Suddenly, he wrenched Harry’s arm violently. Harry screamed even louder as the sharp bone ends sliced out through the skin.</p>
<p>“We’re going to get the rest of that money. And <em>then</em>, freak, when I’ve got it in my hands, I’ll let you go to a hospital.” Harry nodded fervently as Vernon shook his arm, blood spattering them both.</p>
<p>“Anything,” he stammered out. “Just stop and I’ll do anything you want.” A part of him was dying as he gave in yet again. -I don’t belong in Gryffindor!- that part of him thought. -I don’t deserve it!-</p>
<p>Vernon made Harry sit in the back seat this time, which was fine with Harry, because that way his uncle couldn’t reach him. Neither spoke all the way to London. By the time they arrived, Harry was reeling from blood loss, but the wounds seemed to have finally scabbed over. This time, when they entered the bank, Vernon had Harry enlist the aid of enough goblins to empty all 20 vaults. It seemed to be an endless tour of treasure, and not just currency. Sculptures, jewels, and fantastic <em>objets d’art </em>filled the rooms, but Vernon was only interested in the gold, silver, and bronze coins. Afterwards, when he had had the exchanged money transferred to his regular bank, Harry worked up the courage to ask about the promised visit to a hospital.</p>
<p>“I’ve changed my mind,” was Vernon’s response. “I’ll take you to that doctor who fixed up Dudley after that monster attacked him, what was his name? Rubeus Hatgrid or something? Anyhow, he knows how to keep his mouth shut, and it’ll come out of ‘your’ money anyway.” Vernon sounded in an expansive mood. Harry didn’t say anything.</p>
<p>$ HEY! LOOK AT ME! IT’S WRITER’S BLOCK! Just kidding, but it was true for about a week. Imagine! This story almost died right here. Lucky for it (and you) that I know writer’s CPR. $</p>
<p>The doctor seemed competent to Harry as he set and dressed his arm, but strangely incurious. Harry had hoped he would see that the wounds were obviously not from accidents, and ask about them, but he didn’t, and with Vernon standing there glaring, Harry couldn’t bring himself to volunteer the information. Only as they were about to leave was he able to summon the courage.</p>
<p>“Don’t let me go with him!” he shouted, tearing free of Vernon’s grip. “He’ll kill me! He did this to me!” he yelled, brandishing his bandaged arm. He ran over to where the doctor stood by a sink, methodically washing his hands, and clutched at his sleeve. “He’s gone mad! He’ll kill me for money!”</p>
<p>The man turned and looked at Vernon, who shrugged slightly, and then at Harry. “If he were going to kill you,” he said slowly, “why did he bring you here?” In the time it took him to say that, Vernon had come up behind Harry and once again grasped his shoulder.</p>
<p>“Let’s go, boy.” Harry stared in silent desperation as the doctor turned away and Vernon began to draw him to the door.</p>
<p>“Please,” Harry breathed, but when there was no response, he did not give up. Not this time. He turned, shoved past Vernon and ran out into the road. It was dark here, without even streetlights, for this was the countryside north of London. Harry could see the lights of a house not too far away, so he sprinted for it. Almost immediately, he could hear his uncle pounding and swearing behind him. When he heard Vernon stumble and grunt, he thought he would make it, but a moment later, a thrown stone came whizzing out of the darkness. For a man as patently unathletic as Uncle Vernon, he had a good aim. The rock struck Harry hard behind the knee, and he fell hard to the tarmac.</p>
<p>Vernon was on him in an instant. He kicked Harry in the ribs as he tried to stand, then hauled him to his feet. He pulled Harry to the car, where he opened the boot. “Get in, freak,” he said, gesturing to the open boot. Harry just stared. “You’re not getting another chance to run,” Vernon explained impatiently. “Now get in.” With that, he lifted Harry bodily and practically threw him into the boot. Harry barely had time to pull in his hand before the lid was slammed above him. He felt the car start, and knowing that it would be some hours before he could do anything to rescue himself, he put his head down on Vernon’s briefcase and slept for the first time since that owl had appeared at the window. He slept without dreams, and for that he was grateful.</p>
<p>Some time later, Harry woke with a start into sudden silence. It took him a moment to realize that it was the motor being stilled that had disturbed his sleep. He waited for Vernon to let him out, or for some indication of what was going on, but all he hear was the door of a house slamming.</p>
<p>To Harry, waiting crouched in the dark, it seemed like hours before the door opened and shut once again and the boot was thrown open. He saw at once that Vernon was very, very drunk. An insane murderous light shone in his eyes. Seeing it, Harry scrambled out quickly, before he could be shut in again. Thinking that an inebriated Vernon might be a good deal slower, he tried to run again, but Vernon was ready for him. Faster than Harry would have believed possible, his arm shot out and grabbed Harry by the throat. Harry couldn’t make a sound, couldn’t even breath around his uncle’s grasp. Vernon didn’t speak as he dragged Harry, struggling and choking, into the house.</p>
<p>Once inside, Vernon slammed Harry’s head into the wall once again and then let him slide to the floor. Harry, seeing stars, tried and failed to stand. Vernon laughed at this as he climbed the stairs. From the footsteps that shook the ceiling, Harry could tell that Vernon was in his room. The footsteps paused a couple of times, and the floor creaked, and hen Vernon came back down.</p>
<p>“I found these in your little hidey-hole,” he barked. ‘These’ were two small vials of different colored liquids, one a milky grey, the other, an iridescent green. They were the results of Harry’s potion’s homework, done nearly a month ago in the bathroom on the Hogwart’s Express. Harry tried to tell this to Vernon, that they weren’t anything harmful, but the man was too drunk to listen.</p>
<p>“Don’t lie to me, freak. You were going to poison us all. Slip it in the tea, I daresay, and we all die. Make your life easier, I daresay.”</p>
<p>“No!” cried Harry as Vernon advanced upon him. “They’re harmless! I swear it!” He was groveling now as he backed against the kitchen cupboards.</p>
<p>“They’d better be, freak, because you’re going to drink them.” With that, he reached past Harry, who couldn’t restrain him self from flinching, to grab a glass from the cupboard. He poured the contents of the vials into the glass and, ignoring the way it bubbled and stank, thrust it at Harry. “Drink, freak,” was all he said, but Harry didn’t argue. Vernon was holding the knife again, the same one, still with dried blood on the blade. Harry trembled at the sight of it. The glass clattered against his teeth until he stilled it with his mouth and drank.</p>
<p>I could, and should, leave it here for tonight, but.... my sister Comechatcha would kill me, and so would you, I think. Read on.</p>
<p>Apparently, and this is an understatement, those two potions should not be mixed. Harry realized that immediately, before agony drove all thought from his mind. His eyes were burning, two coals searing into his skull. He clawed at his face, flames licking at his hands, fully willing to scratch his own eyes out, just to stop the pain. After a momentary eternity, the torture let up enough to allow him the presence of bind to grope blindly for the sink. He snatched at the faucet, turning on the water and plunged his head under the flow. It was the most logical solution and it worked. The burning sensation ebbed away under the cold torrent and in a few moments, the fierce heat had gone, although a great deal of pain lingered. When Harry stood up however, something distracted him.</p>
<p>“I... I can’t see! I can’t see!” he shrieked, staring into darkness. He stumbled over something and fell heavily onto Vernon, who began to laugh drunkenly.</p>
<p>“That’s what you get for tying to poison my family, freak. Serves you right.”</p>
<p>Harry broke. He launched his fist in the direction of Vernon’s laughter. “You drunken sot!” he yelled hoarsely as he knocked his uncle down. His yells changed, however, when Vernon struck back. Harry had forgotten the knife.</p>

<p>Hi. It’s me, Lady Russell Holmes. Here is yet another installation in Harry’s newest epic. Enjoy, and <em>try</em> not to think too harshly of me.</p>
<p>Chapter 4</p>
<p>At Hogwarts</p>
<p>At Hogwart’s castle, a goblin stood in front of the Headmaster’s desk. “Headmaster Dumbledore,” he said formally, “If you will remember, sir, several years ago, you asked us at Gringott’s to be alert as to anything unusual with regards to young Mr. Potter’s account. We thought that you would be interested to know that on Friday, Mr. Potter made a large withdrawal amounting to...” He had to consult a slip of paper in its hand. “941 Galleons, and 12 sickles, and that very early Monday morning, he emptied 18 of his 20 vaults. There are three additional causes for concern here. One,” he said, ticking off the point on an unusually long forefinger. “Is that early Friday morning, we issued Mr. Potter an review of the state of his account. Second,” and another finger folded. “Both on Friday and Monday, Mr. Potter was accompanied by an imposing muggle whom he addressed as ‘uncle’ and who he seemed to fear. Last, all of the money withdrawn was immediately exchanged to muggle British Pounds, and a great deal of it was transferred to the muggle’s account at the Bank of London.” The goblin assumed an expression at this point which, on a human, could only be called sheepish. “Please understand, sir. We do not often concern ourselves in the matters of humans, but the Boy-Who-Lived is... well...” He looked at the floor, at a loss for words.</p>
<p>Dumbledore smiled. “Harry Potter in very special indeed. Thank you for this information, Griphook. I will look in on him. Do you want to know what I find?”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Headmaster.” Griphook bowed low and vanished.</p>
<p>In truth, Dumbledore was more agitated at what he had just heard than he let on. He had known since Harry’s second year that there were problems between the Dursley’s and their nephew. Then, Molly Weasley had owled him, telling him how her sons had found Harry a prisoner in his own room. Even then though, he knew that Harry was safer there than with the Weasleys, the Grangers, or even here at Hogwarts. His aunt Petunia was the key. She was a blood relative of Harry’s, the only one living, but more importantly, she was Lily’s sister. Her <em>twin </em>sister. When Lily Potter gave her life to save her son, her sister was affected as well. Quite unbeknownst to Petunia, her very existance and proximity shielded Harry from discovery by Voldemort and his minions. Despite her dislike for her nephew, she was his best defense. The protection was purely natural and couldn’t be detected or countered, even now, with Lord Voldemort revived and sharing that same protective blood. As long as Harry lived with her, that is.</p>
<p>Dumbledore made to rise, but before he could leave his desk, a hesitant tap sounded at the door. “Headmaster Professor Dumbledore Sir?” It was Dobby, edging cautiously into his office. “Sir? Dobby is worrying about Harry Potter, Sir. Dobby is trying to visit Harry Potter all day yesterday, but Dobby is not being able to find Harry Potter’s house.” The diminutive house-elf seemed very worked up. “I is going to where to where it is, Sire, but it is not being where it should be!” He was shrieking now, and stomping his sock-clad feet. Dumbledore sought to calm his hysteria, laying a comforting hand across his shoulders as the two moved down the spiral staircase.</p>
<p>“There is a very simple explanation for that, Dobby. After last’s years events,” he explained, “I saw fit to place Mr. Potter’s household under the Fidelius Charm to protect him and his family. Also, I warded it so that no wizard or magical creature can approach it. I’m sorry if I frightened you, but it is for Harry’s own good.”</p>
<p>Dobby seemed calmer now, but he had one last question. “So Dobby cannot visit Harry Potter?”</p>
<p>“I’m afraid not, Dobby, said Dumbledore kindly. “But you shall see him when he returns to Hogwarts in the fall.” He patted the elf’s shoulder a final time before they parted company, Dobby disappearing into the inconspicuous house-elf passages that riddled the castle and led, ultimately, to the kitchens. Dumbledore continued on his way to the Great Hall, lost deeply in his own thoughts.</p>
<p>Friday morning, Harry Potter had received his review from Gringott’s Wizard Bank. Friday morning, a vague, sourceless dread had accosted Dumbledore as he ate breakfast in his chambers. The feeling had intensified throughout the day until he was pacing the corridors, unable to settle or to concentrate on anything. He had not slept that night and the dread had escalated hour by hour. Today, he had awoken, soaked with sweat, from a restless, dream-ridden sleep to the news of Griphook’s arrival. He greeted this with a sort of relief, for he knew, deep within, that the goblin's visit had something to do with his extreme unease. That Harry Potter was involved came as only a minor, if unpleasant surprise.</p>
<p>He emerged from his tense ruminations to find himself at the top of the Grand Stairwell. Looking down, he took a moment to notice something odd. From where he was standing, he could see the entire well, from its heights to its depths. Typically, one could always count on seeing at least one flight of stairs in the process of migrating from one landing to another. Today, however, nothing moved, not even the portraits coating the walls. All of the frames were empty, without exception. Dumbledore, puzzled, stepped out onto the uppermost stair.</p>
<p>He had meant to go downstairs, but not like this. As soon as his feet touched the step, it seemed to absorb them, trapping him neatly. Before he could even disengage his wand from its sheath in his robes, the flight disengaged itself from its landing, and dropped, straight down.</p>
<p>Only shock kept Dumbledore from screaming as he fell, pulled down by the vast weight of marble affixed to his feet. Shock and the dignity of more than three centuries of life. Before the shock and the dignity had time to give way to panic, everything stopped, without any evidence that he had ever moved. He was now standing, somewhat unsteadily at the foot of the stairwell. As the entrapping marble flowed away from his feet, the carved banister came up to shove him between the shoulder blades so that he stumbled into the Great Hall, propelled forward by its push.</p>
<p>A dozen or so members of Hogwart’s staff were eating late breakfasts in the hall. Startled by Dumbledore’s abrupt arrival, the stared at him as he cast wildly about. The school was trying to tell him something, he knew, and it was in this room. The sense of dread was so strong now that he fancied he could smell blood.</p>
<p>He <em>could</em> smell blood! It was strong, an acrid, coppery scent in his nostrils. Looking like an aged bloodhound, long nose almost touching the ground, he searched frantically for the source, but it was Professor Snape, with his nose long trained to the intricacies of potion-making, who found it first. He had smelt it almost before Dumbledore had entered the room.</p>
<p>“Here, Albus,” he called, beckoning. Dumbledore noted with distress that the Potion’s Master looked pale, extraordinarily so, as he ran to where Snape stood by the vacant Gryffindor table. He gestured slowly to a conspicuous spot below the bench. A dark red spot, slowly growing. Dumbledore’s legs gave out beneath him. He sank to the floor in a daze, not hearing Snape’s and McGonagall’s anxious inquiries. His eyes locked onto a word carved neatly into the edge of the table, an orderly wound, dripping blood.</p>
<p>“Harry” the word said and Dumbledore moaned softly. “Harry.”</p>

<p>Just kidding!!!!!!!! Sorry, sorry, I’m evil, I know. Actually it was my sister Comechatcha’s idea, so flame her, not me. On with the fic! Charge!!!!</p>
<p>By the time Dumbledore had regained his feet, he knew what he had to be done. Gesturing for McGonagall and Snape, to follow him, he headed back to his office. This time, the stairs behaved normally, although the portraits remained empty.</p>
<p>By the time the trio reached Dumbledore’s office, the two Heads of House were concernedly demanding an explanation. “What has the Potter boy done now?” growled Snape, but there was a genuine note of apprehension in his face despite his harsh tone and words. Professor McGonagall was all but stuttering in her concern.</p>
<p>“You-Know-Who can’t have taken Harry, can he? I thought you put him under extra precautions this summer. Oh, Albus, we should have kept him here, with you.” At this, Dumbledore sighed, leaning heavily against the mantle.</p>
<p>“I don’t know yet if Voldemort is involved, but you are right, Minerva. I should have kept Harry here, at my side.”</p>
<p>Moving like a man every day his age, Dumbledore grasped a handful of Floo Powder and stepped into the flames. “The Burrow!” Snape and McGonagall gaped briefly at each other before following.</p>
<p>Shocked silence greeted their arrival at the Weasley home. Forgoing greetings in his haste, Dumbledore adressed those present. “Ron. Where’s Ron? I need to speak to him now!” There was no mistaking the urgency in his voice. Mrs. Weasley regained her composure instantly, and stood up, pointing at the stairs.</p>
<p>“He’s in his room, having a lie-... It’s at the very top!” she finished in a yell, for Dumbledore was already bounding up the stairs, taking them two at a time in his hurriedness. Before the Professors and the crowd of Weasleys could follow, he reappeared, Ron at his heels. He held up his hands to counter the clamor of voices. Silence fell in the kitchen.</p>
<p>“I am very sorry, but I do not have the time to explain just now. I shall very soon, but now,” he whirled upon a very uneasy Ron. “<em>Ronald Weasley. Where is Harry Potter?</em>” Dumbledore spoke slowly and formally. The adults present gasped as they recognized the age-old formula by which a Secret Keeper is asked to reveal his charge. Ron’s eyes widened, but his ritual response was delivered in a strong, steady voice.</p>
<p>“<em>Who asks, and why</em>?” Both he and Dumbledore brought their wands to bear on one another, and the light of a truth spell blossomed across Dumbledore’s face.</p>
<p>“<em>Albus Dumbledore asks, for the protection of Harry Potter’s life</em>.” Everyone gasped again as the truth spell faded, indicating complete honesty.</p>
<p>“<em>Harry is in his uncle’s home, Number 4 Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey</em>,” said Ron, completing the formula. “What’s threatening Harry, Professor?”</p>
<p>“A moment please, Mr. Weasley, and I’ll explain.” Dumbledore rounded on Snape and McGonagall. “Severus, Minerva, go back to the castle. I need you to begin immediately to lift the wards I placed on Harry’s house, so we can approach it. It will take at least 24 hours, so please, begin immediately. I’ll join you once I have explained to Mr. Weasley and his family. Now, go!”</p>
<p>The two professor’s dissapparated immediately. Before Dumbledore could begin his explanations, however, Ron spoke up, to his parents.</p>
<p>“I <em>told </em>you something was up with Harry.” He turned to Dumbledore. “Friday night, Hedwig turned up at my window, and she won’t leave. I can't get her to go back to Harry’s. I got a post from him a week ago, and he said everything was fine.” Ron wasn’t far from hysteria. Dumbledore put his arm around the boy.</p>
<p>“Ron. I know that you are worried about Harry. So am I, but right now, I need you to think. In any of Harry’s letters, did he mention his aunt or uncle? Especially his uncle.”</p>
<p>Ron thought for a moment, still breathing hard. Slowly, he spoke. “He said his uncle was fired from his job, about the same time school got out. I can’t think of anything else. He doesn’t like to talk about the Dursley’s much.”</p>
<p>Dumbledore looked as though an ugly suspicion had been proved. “Here is what I know. Friday morning, I believe that Mr. Dursley discovered just how wealthy Harry really is. For some reason, Gringott’s sent him an unsolicited accounting review. That same morning, I began to feel restless, a dread that I could not place.”</p>
<p>He continued to relate the events of that morning, from the concerns of Griphook and Dobby to the castle’s own concern and ‘Harry’ carved into the Gryffindor table. At this, Ron spoke again.</p>
<p>“Harry carved that our first year. Mine’s straight across the table. Everyone carves their name somewhere. I even found... Dad’s....” his voice petered out as he realized that he was babbling. “Harry’s really in trouble, isn’t he, Headmaster?”</p>
<p>Dumbledore sank into a chair. “He is, Ron, and it is my fault. There are a thousand things that I could have done, <em>should </em>have done to protect him. I could have let him stay on at Hogwart’s, or even just looked in on him this summer, but my own wards, meant to <em>protect </em>him, even now prevent me from helping him when I <em>know</em> that something is terribly wrong. I thought that only Voldemort would be a danger to him. I forgot the antipathy of his own guardians and <em>that </em>is what now threatens Harry.”</p>
<p>“Hang on,” said Fred, speaking up for the first time. “These wards only exclude magical beings, right? Not muggles?”</p>
<p>“Right?” answered Dumbledore, looking up from his hands in interest. “Go on.”</p>
<p>“So, Hermione Granger’s parents are muggles, aren’t they, Ron?” Ron nodded, also interested. “So they could go and get Harry, right?”</p>
<p>“That’s an idea,” chimed in George. “No.. wait? How would they get past the Dursleys? If they really have, you know, <em>hurt </em>Harry, they wouldn’t want anyone to find out, would they? They could go to prison.”</p>
<p>“They should go to prison!” cried out Ginny, in tears. “They should be in Azkaban!”</p>
<p>“My sentiments exactly, Miss Weasley, but I’m afraid I agree with George. We can’t use the Grangers. If they aren’t able to retrieve Harry on a first attempt, the Dursley’s could hurt him worse in retaliation.”</p>
<p>At this, Mrs. Weasley burst out. “Worse?” she cried. “We don’t even know how badly he’s hurt <em>now</em>! And all we can do is wait?” The last word was a sob, and she turned her face into Mr. Weasley’s shoulder as he held her close.</p>
<p>Dumbledore sighed despairingly. “I’m afraid so, Molly.” He pushed himself to his feet. “Do you want to come back to the school with me to... wait?” A sad, mirthless smile played across his lips. “You’re all welcome.”</p>
<p>A brief moment later, the Burrow was empty, the last green flames fading from the fireplace.</p>

<p>Hi. It’s me, as if you couldn’t guess. I figured that this, Midnight December 31, was an auspicious time to post, so... here I am.</p>
<p>Chapter 5</p>
<p>Back at 4 Privet Drive</p>
<p>Despite Vernon’s inebriated state, Harry was no match for him. Certainly not blinded, and with one arm useless. Even less so with the knife thrown into the mix. Vernon’s reaction, almost instinctive, to Harry’s wild charge put the knife directly through the palm of Harry’s good, left hand. His recoil, accompanied by a panicked scream, tore the knife free, nearly severing his remaining thumb. His rage ebbed as fast as it had flooded, leaving him cowering once more on the floor.</p>
<p>“Help me help me help me help me.” His voice, slurred by pain, was a wavering monotone as he rocked back and forth.</p>
<p>“Shut up, you,” said Vernon, returning to his abandoned bottle of scotch. “You’re irritating me.”</p>
<p>Harry didn’t hear him. “Help me help me help me...” he kept muttering until Vernon would take no more. He surged to his feet and Harry, hearing him, scrambled unsteadily to his, still calling despondently for aid.</p>
<p>“I told you to shut up!” roared Vernon, lunging for Harry. Motivated by terror, however, Harry evaded his uncle’s hands and stumbled towards the stairs, leaving an profuse trail of blood. Confused by his anguish, both mental and physical, he made for his room as a place of refuge, but Vernon caught him at the top of the stairs.</p>
<p>“Where did you think you were going, boy?” Vernon was laughing at him as he lifted him with the surprising strength of a drunken man. Despite his earlier burst of adrenaline, Harry could only struggle weakly as his uncle carried him back downstairs. His grip, although too strong to allow Harry to escape, slipped enough that Harry’s head bounced against the last four steps. When Vernon dropped Harry to fish his keys out of his pockets, the boy was too dazed to do anything more than lie there.</p>
<p>He didn’t fight at all when Vernon proceeded to drag him by a foot out to the car, only crying out softly when his head dropped off the curb onto the tarmac. He lay inert in Vernon’s arm as he was lifted and dropped carelessly once again into the boot. It wasn’t until the lid shut above him and he had heard Vernon return to the house that he began again to murmur for the help which seemed such a remote possibility.</p>
<p>At that moment, in fact, help, in the form of Dumbledore, McGonagall, Snape and the Weasleys, was still 9 hours away, and the gash in his left hand would not stop bleeding. Even when he heard the Laughlins, from Number 6, walk by, he was too frightened and too weak to call out for aid. Before their voices had faded, Harry, exhausted by pain, blood loss, and fear, had once again fallen asleep.</p>
<p>Quite some time later, the boot opened. Harry couldn’t see it, but it was early morning. It had been night before. He could hear Vernon there, humming cheerfully and sounding generally unconcerned by Harry’s distress. “You stay quiet, freak,” he said menacingly. “You and I are going for a little ride.” The boot slammed again, and Harry felt the car tilt as Vernon got in and started the motor.</p>
<p>This ride was long, longer by far than the rides to London had been, and towards the end, the car jostled as though driving down an unpaved lane. When the car stopped, Harry curled himself as small as possible before Vernon opened the lid, but he was nonetheless dragged out to collapse onto what felt like gravel. He could hear rushing water nearby, but it didn’t quite register. Vernon hauled Harry to his feet, forced him to stumble towards the liquid sounds. The ground under foot changed to stone, cracked and uneven.</p>
<p>“I should have done this the day you showed up at my door, freak. I could have been rich then, and rid of you fourteen years ago. Well, after today, I’ll be both.”</p>
<p>Abruptly, Vernon released Harry, who staggered to catch his balance. A small metallic sound made him freeze. He knew that sound, had heard it before, but couldn’t place it now.</p>
<p>And there you go. Today’s installment must end there, I am afraid. Sorry it is so short. See you tomorrow, and have a Very Happy New Year, from Lady Russell Holmes, Comechatcha, and The Masked Cliffhanger.</p>
<p><br/><br/>##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### #####<br/><br/>Chapter: 6<br/><br/></p>
<p>$ Hi. It’s me. My most profound apologies for the brevity of the last chapter. I just couldn’t resist leaving it there. (Ducks and hides under desk to avoid thrown wands and stray burning Bludgers. Squeaks.) This one’s going to be even shorter. Forgive me? At least, don‘t kill me, or who‘ll finish this story? Well, I suppose Relle could do it, but ... Hey!!! I‘m not expendable!!! $</p>
<p>Chapter 6</p>
<p>A sharp, explosive report assaulted the air, and for Harry, time seemed to slow down to nothing. He could hear the whistle of something small rushing towards him through the air. His mind finally seemed to work as he recognized what it must be. A bullet. His uncle, the man who had raised him from infancy, had just fired a gun at him. He would <em>die </em>at his hand.</p>
<p>Harry had time to be amazed by the situation before he felt the bullet hit his chest, right below his heart. Even as he was knocked down, thrown backwards by the impact, his mind turned inward. He could fell the small lump of lead as it drastically rearranged his insides, and he screamed in a spray of blood as it blew out through his back.</p>
<p>Time returned to normal as he lay on the rocks, each breath bubbling out through the twin holes in his torso. Strangely lucid, Harry heard his uncle approach him. He nudged him in the shoulder with the toe of his shoe. From somewhere, Harry summoned the air and energy to speak.</p>
<p>“You’ll go to Azka-” he said, but had to stop to cough weakly, choking on his own blood. Before he could try again, Vernon put his foot across Harry’s mouth, silencing him.</p>
<p>“You’re still alive?” he asked, putting more pressure on Harry’s face. “Then listen, freak. I’ve got your money, which means I’ve got what I want, and I don’t want you. I never did. This isn’t even good-bye. This is good riddance.”</p>
<p>It was all Harry could do to cling to consciousness as Vernon stripped him roughly, even going so far as to rip the cast off his arm, causing him to scream again until blood filled his throat. When there was nothing left by which Harry could be traced back to Privet Drive, Vernon lifted Harry once again. Harry, still conscious, could only throw his head from side to side in protest. He couldn’t even feel his legs, let alone kick them. Instead, he tried to concentrate on what his uncle was doing to him.</p>
<p>Vernon was walking quickly towards the water sounds, which, Harry realized, were waves, far below him. Cliffs, then. The amused feeling from before returned. Who needed Voldemort? He had failed where Vernon Dursley, a muggle of the worst sort, would succeed.</p>
<p>He clutched at Vernon’s hands, but he was too weak. Vernon brushed his groping hand off like cobwebs, drew back, and flung Harry over the edge. Fortunately, Harry chose the next moment to finally black out from shock, for his inert form hit three rocky outcroppings in his vicious plunge into the waters of the English Channel.</p>
<p>$ This is specially for Lei Dumbledore. That was a mini-cliffie, THIS IS A MEGA CLIFFIE!! (It‘s even on a real cliff)$</p>
<p>$ Oh look! Yet another evil cliffie! “Here, cliffie, cliffie, cliffie!" when said cliffie, a small, friendly, quasi-magical creature resembling a cross between a Dachshund and a Chihuahua, approaches, I PUNT IT ACROSS THE QUIDDITCH PITCH!!!! As you can tell, I don't like them. And now I’m writing them!! How evil am I? And know what’s worse, I already have the next chapter written, typed and uploaded. I just haven’t posted it yet!!! Sooooooooo, how long should I hold you in suspense? A week? Or perhaps two? Or only a few more hours. It all depends on you, my <em>reviewers</em>. I’m evil, I know. $</p>

<p>Hi. (Tiny, meek voice comes from beneath desk. White flag waves.) I’m sorry, I’m sorry. Please don’t kill me. The cliffie ate my fic. (Emerges and speaks in a more normal voice.) This chapter is longer anyway. Have a ball.</p>
<p>Chapter 7</p>
<p>Back at Hogwarts. Again.</p>
<p>When the final ward fell, there was a palpable air of relief among those gathered. “What are we waiting for?” cried Dumbledore. “Arthur. You kept Harry’s house on the Floo network, didn’t you?”</p>
<p>“No,” said Mr. Weasley regretfully. “I really wish I had, but I promised. Oh, that doesn’t matter now. However we get there, it has to be fast.”</p>
<p>Hermione, who had arrived very early that morning, spoke up. “Dobby!” There was a collective ‘Huh?’ but she continued. “Dobby can apparate from here, and house-elves are really powerful. He could pop us all to Harry’s, couldn’t he, Professor?”</p>
<p>Dumbledore smiled hugely. “He could indeed! Dobby!”</p>
<p>By the time Dumbledore called his name, the elf in question stood before him. “Dobby can visit Harry Potter now, Sir?”</p>
<p>“Yes Dobby, you can, but you have to take us, all of us with you.”</p>
<p>“You can do that, right Dobby?” interjected Ron. Dobby nodded feverishly.</p>
<p>“Oh! Of course, Mr. Wheezy. Dobby can take all of you. It is easy.”</p>
<p>“Then I repeat: what are we waiting for?” Dumbledore grasped Dobby’s hand and the rest of the group followed suit. “Let’s go!”</p>
<p>“We go now!” Dobby snapped his fingers and the occupants of Dumbledore’s office dissipated into a fine mist, which raced out through a window and across the countryside. They zoomed past villages and hamlets, past the grey sprawl of Landon and into the endless suburbs of Little Whinging. The mist alighted in front of 4 Privet Drive before coalescing into ten figures. Professors Dumbledore, McGonagall, and Snape, as well as Hermione and Ron, Fred, George, Ginny, Arthur, and Molly Weasley stood in front of the house in which Harry Potter had grown up. But Harry wasn’t there. At that moment, in fact, Harry was in the boot of his uncle’s car, which had just turned onto an unpaved lane which led to an isolated and unpopular viewpoint over the Dover Cliffs.</p>
<p>Not knowing this, the Professors and Weasleys crowded onto the narrow porch as Dumbledore rung the doorbell. No one was surprised when there was no answer. Hermione pushed to the fore.</p>
<p>“Allow me,” she said. “<em>Alohomora!” </em>The door sprung open under the force of her spell, and they piled inside. Dumbledore started to direct a search of the building, but his eyes fell upon the wall behind the door. He froze, his mouth hanging open. Everyone turned to look.</p>
<p>“Blood!” squeaked Dobby, covering his eyes with his ears. It <em>was </em>blood, feathered as if by hair in a streak clear down to the baseboard.</p>
<p>“In here!” cried Ron from the kitchen , sounding very shaken. He, Fred, and George had pushed in past the crowd and so had missed the first stain. Responding to the near-hysteria in his voice, the rest ran to him.</p>
<p>What Ron had found was more blood. A pool of it, and more, spattered over the cupboards and wall. In the midst of this gore lay a knife. Ginny turned away, sobbing, and buried her head in her mother’s arms. Snape laid a hand on Mrs. Weasley’s shoulder. Showing an uncharacteristic empathy, he said, “Maybe you should take Ginny outside, Mrs. Weasley. We’ll fetch you if we find anything, alright?”</p>
<p>Mrs. Weasley nodded mutely, glancing fearfully back into the kitchen before shepherding her distraught daughter out into the Dursley’s front garden. Fred and, more reluctantly, George, joined her there, but Ron and Hermione resolutely joined the grim search. It only took a few minutes. By the time Vernon was lifting Harry out of the boot near Dover, it was obvious that neither Harry nor his family was in Privet Drive. Ginny lifted her head, tears running freely, to a defeated Dumbledore. “Is Harry dead, then?”</p>
<p>“No!” Ron and Dobby looked at each other, for they had both shouted. Dobby continued first. “No! Harry Potter can not be dead! The world <em>needs </em>Harry Potter!”</p>
<p>“I <em>know </em>that Harry isn’t dead! I’m his Secret Keeper. That means he and I are linked! I- I <em>feel </em>him! Like a thread between him and me. I’d know if it were cut. I’d know if he were dead, and he’s not!”</p>
<p>“Well,” said Professor McGonagall, sounding depressed, “If he <em>is </em>still alive, than where is he? How can we find him? He could be anywhere.”</p>
<p>Dobby’s ears pricked up. “Dobby can find him, Professors, Wheezys. Dobby is very good at finding lost things.” Before anyone could ask him what he meant, the house-elf had snapped his fingers and vanished with a loud clap.</p>
<p>As a mist, Dobby raced from one end of England to the other, searching as only a house-elf could. And he found Harry, saw him flung by Vernon over the cliff. Before Harry had hit the water, Dobby was back with the anxious wizards. He grabbed Dumbledore, who only had time clasp those nearest, Ron, Hermione, and Snape, to him before Dobby vanished again, taking them with him.</p>
<p>When Dumbledore rematerialized, the first thing he saw was Vernon Dursley turning back from the cliff, brushing his hands as if after a job well done. A broad grin faded from his lips as he saw the horrified and enraged wizards. Dumbledore pulled out his wand, intending to curse the muggle, but Snape had beaten him to it.</p>
<p>“<em>Petrificus Totalus!”</em> he cried. Vernon stiffened like a board and fell to the ground, but no one had any more attention to spare for him.</p>
<p>“Where is Harry, Dobby?” asked Hermione urgently. The house-elf gestured mutely to the cliff, and the four wizards ran to peer over the edge.</p>
<p>Hee hee hee. Told you this chapter would be longer, but guess what! It’s still the same cliffie! Is Harry alive or dead? Only I know, and you will have to wait to find out! Mwahahahhaha! That’s why <em>I </em>am the evil genius!</p>

<p align="center">Chapter 8</p>
<p>It was an incredibly long drop and at the bottom was Harry. He was drifting face down in the gentle waves, and they could see the horribly red stain that was spreading around him.</p>
<p>“Oh God!” cried Hermione.</p>
<p>“Merlin!” breathed Ron. “Hurry! He’s still alive!”</p>
<p>The two adult wizards apparated directly into the water, one on either side of Harry. Down here, the waves weren’t as mild as they had appeared, but they managed to cradle Harry gently between them as they apparated back to the top of the cliff. Hermione began to cry as she saw him, and, after a moment, Ron did too.</p>
<p>Harry lay absolutely motionless in Snape’s arms, staring at the sky from eyes gone as black and as flat as if they had been coated in soot. He was still breathing, but with each gasp, blood sprayed in a pink mist from the holes in his chest and back and bubbled in his throat. The tumbling fall down the cliff had done yet more damage. His already broken arm was twisted and all but torn off at the elbow, and now his other arm was broken as well, hanging stiffly from a malformed shoulder. One leg, miraculously, looked whole, but the other was folded completely back on itself from the knee, held there gruesomely by a shard of bone which protruded like a nail from Harry’s shin to enter his thigh.</p>
<p>Holding back his own tears, Dumbledore conjured up a floating stretcher. As Snape carefully laid Harry upon it, he turned to Dobby, who stood by weeping frantically, hands covering his eyes.</p>
<p>“Dobby! I need you to take us directly to Hogwarts, to the Hospital Wing, right now!” The elf opened his eyes and nodded. Again the party dissolved, reforming this time in the familiar environs of Hogwarts. Dumbledore hurried off to find Madame Pomfrey, but a stunned Snape stayed with Ron and Hermione by Harry’s side. Ron held Hermione in his arms, and she held him as he frantically called to Harry, whose eyes had closed.</p>
<p>“Harry! Harry! Wake up! Come on, just speak to me! It’s Ron! You’re safe now, you’re at Hogwarts! Just please, be OK!” he sobbed. Finding her voice, she added her exhortations to his.</p>
<p>“Harry, please, you just can’t die! We <em>need </em>you!”</p>
<p>When Dumbledore returned with a very flushed Madame Pomfrey, she immediately rushed over to Harry, clucking in disapproval until she actually <em>saw </em>the state he was in. “Tsk. What can Harry have done this ti-... Oh my Lord!” She clasped her hands in shock. “What...? Who...?” She was all but speechless and Ron spoke up bitterly.</p>
<p>“His uncle did this to him.” He looked to her with hope in his eyes. “You can save him, right? You have to!”</p>
<p>His vehemence startled Madame Pomfrey into regaining her composure. “I will try my best, Mr. Weasley,” she said professionally, “but you and Miss Granger must wait outside. I’ll need no distractions.” Having said this, she herded the two students out into the corridor, not even bothering to shut the door before she hurried back to the bed where Harry lay.</p>
<p>Not even pausing for more explanation, the Hogwarts nurse set about to examine her patient. She murmured to herself as she did so, cataloguing aloud the boys injuries. Snape and Dumbledore leaned closer to hear. She started with Harry’s head, where a deep gash bleed ferociously from behind his ear.</p>
<p>“He’s cracked his skull here, that’s very bad. Oh! My word! What is wrong with his eyes? They’ll have to wait. What else? His neck is alright, good.” To proceed, she pulled off the cloak with which Snape had covered Harry’s naked body, crying out at the sight of the bullet wound. “<em>Oh!</em> How is he still alive? It must have missed his heart, but not his lungs. Look at how it’s bubbling.” A mist of blood still issued with every weak breath. Pomfrey tapped her wand lightly against the wound and an image sprang into existence above Harry, showing his insides, with the path the bullet traveled horribly obvious as a tunnel of pulped flesh, already blackened as dead tissue. “Oh no!” breathed Pomfrey and Dumbledore together. An indrawn hiss of breath was Snape’s only response. Pomfrey rolled Harry gently onto his chest so she could see for herself what the image showed.</p>
<p>The bullet from Vernon’s gun had blown a hole the approximate size of a grapefruit from Harry’s back. A hole which exactly bisected his spine. Through the cavity, the professors could see the edges of Harry’s ravaged lungs and the bones of his spine, from which about three inches was clearly missing. Madame Pomfrey gasped and covered her mouth, turning to Dumbledore.</p>
<p>“Oooh! Albus, I can’t fix this! I mean, I can repair the broken bones, heal his lungs, but the spine! There is no magic that can replace that!”</p>
<p>“Do what you can, Poppy,” said Dumbledore soothingly. “Do you want me to stay with you?” She nodded mutely, already absorbed in her healing.</p>
<p>“Then I shall join Weasley and Granger. Poppy, Albus.” Snape nodded himself out of the room before going to find Ron and Hermione. They were sitting quietly in the Gryffindor Common room. They looked up as he entered, hope warring with dread on both their tear-stained faces.</p>
<p>“Is Harry going to be alright, Professor?” asked Hermione hesitantly. Snape, once again sounding extraordinarily sympathetic, replied in hushed tones.</p>
<p>“We can’t know yet, Miss Granger. His injuries are worse than we had feared. His back...” He sank into a chair, unable to continue. The three sat in silence, each wrapped in fears for the boy who lay, deathly still, under the competent hands of Madame Pomfrey.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Dobby, who had disappeared before Ron and Hermione had left the infirmary, appeared from nowhere at Snape's elbow. “Professor Snape, Sir?” he asked, pulling at Snape’s sleeve. “Sir? What is Dobby to do with the muggle?” Dobby’s face and tone were murderous as he snapped his fingers. Vernon appeared, freed now from the body-bind curse, but instead held captive by twining chains and shackles of house-elf- conjured iron. Their weight held him to his knees. He look up at the three wizards, his eyes fearful above the gag which kept him silent.</p>
<p>Snape and Ron, eyes blazing identically, stepped forward together, wands raised in ire. “Cruc-..” Snape started, but Hermione stopped him with a hand on his sleeve, forcing his wand down. A single glare stopped Ron.</p>
<p>“No, Professor. We can deal with him later. You know he’s not worth an Unforgivable curse. You too, Ron. Harry needs you here, not in Azkaban.”</p>
<p>Snape nodded regretfully and lowered his wand. “Put him in one of the old cells, Dobby. They’re in the lowest dungeon. You can leave him bound like that, if you like. Oh, and Dobby,” he added, seeing the brutal look on the elf’s usually amiable face. “Don’t hurt him. Much.” Vernon’s face paled as the homicidal house-elf advanced upon him. Snape allowed himself a small smile once they were gone.</p>
<p>After more moments of silence, Ron started. “Professor, what about the others? Mum, Dad, and Professor McGonagall? They must be terribly worried, and we forgot all about them!”</p>
<p>Snape looked at him in surprise. “You’re right, Mr. Weasley. Dobby!”</p>
<p>“Yes, Sir?” Dobby reappeared immediately.</p>
<p>“Dobby, go back to Harry Potter’s house and retrieve Professor McGonagall and the Weasley’s. Bring them <em>here</em>.” He indicated the Common Room. “Go, now!”</p>
<p>Dobby bowed and vanished once again. Only a moment later, the other five Weasley’s and Professor McGonagall appeared. Dobby disappeared again immediately as the newcomers clamored with questions.</p>
<p>“Did you find Harry?”</p>
<p>“Is he alright?”</p>
<p>“Where did you find him?”</p>
<p>“Where is he?”</p>
<p>“Where is Albus?”</p>
<p>Snape held up his hands, and the din slowly abated, everyone looking to him expectantly.</p>
<p>“Dobby found Harry just outside of Dover. His uncle had just....had shot him, and thrown him off a cliff. Harry is now in the Hospital Wing, with Professor Dumbledore and Madame Pomfrey.” He paused a moment and looked down at his hands before clasping them behind his back. “We can’t know yet if he... if he will live. He’s been hurt very badly.”</p>
<p>Everyone simply stared blankly at him for a moment, trying to absorb what they had just heard. Ginny spoke up first.</p>
<p>“Can we see him?” she asked, her voice cracked with worry.</p>
<p>Snape looked at her kindly. “Not just yet, Miss Weasley. Madame Pomfrey needs to give Harry her complete concentration right now.”</p>
<p>“Of course,” she murmured, subsiding.</p>
<p>“I’m going to see if I can help, Severus,” said Professor McGonagall, drawing him aside. “Will you stay here with them?”</p>
<p>“Of course, Minerva,” replied Snape. “Go.”</p>
<p>McGonagall actually ran down from the Gryffindor tower, all the way to the Hospital Wing. Reaching it, she stopped just outside the door in order to calm herself before quietly entering the infirmary. Silently, she approached the far end, where Dumbledore and Pomfrey worked quickly over a still form under a pool of light.</p>
<p>Harry looked better now than he had at the top of that cliff in Dover, but his appearance was still such that McGonagall cried out at her first sight of him. His limbs lay straight now, and most of the gashes and lacerations were sealed, but there had been no time or attention or time spared to clean away the blood that coated him. It was obvious to a nauseated McGonagall that the right arm, the one that had been broken first, was scarcely attached at the elbow, and that one foot was irreparably crushed. His skin was stretched so tightly over his skull that, through his eyelids, she could see the shadows of his burnt-black eyes. Even unconcious, he flinched at each touch, particularly on his hands. On his right hand, the stump that was all that was left of his thumb was hidden from view by a neat bandage. On his left, the huge gash had been replaced by a thick, ropy, red scar.</p>
<p>Dumbledore turned to smile wanly at Professor McGonagall. Looking to Pomfrey, he disengaged himself from Harry and put an arm around the Transfiguration teacher, who wasn’t far from tears. “Now, now, Minerva. He’s going to live. We’ve repaired his lungs, and the crack in his skull, and we’ve stopped all the internal bleeding. There shouldn’t even be any brain damage. We’re trying right now to save his arm and foot.”</p>
<p>“Albus,” interrupted Poppy. “I need your hands here.” He turned back to their task. McGonagall stood to watch just a moment more before turning to flee the heart-rending scene, returning to the Gryffindor Common Room and those waiting for news.</p>
<p>“He’s going to live!” she shouted as she clamored through the Portrait-Hole, dignity forgotten in the joy of relief. “He’s going to live!”</p>
<p>“What! Really?” The Weasleys and Hermione were exultant at the news. “Can we go and see him now, Professor?” Ron, wiping at the tears running down his face, started hopefully for the Portrait, but McGonagall caught his arm.</p>
<p>“Not yet, Mr. Weasley. I’m sorry. Professor Dumbledore and Madame Pomfrey still have work to do. The Headmaster will tell us when they are done.”</p>
<p>“Now, Minerva,” came Dumbledore’s voice. She and the Weasley’s whirled to find him standing behind them, next to the open portrait. “We’ve finished, done all we can. You can come and see him if you like, although I must warn you that Poppy doesn’t expect him to wake up for a couple of days. What he’s been through should have killed him. We should all be grateful that he lives at all.”</p>
<p>Despite the palpable air of celebration, it was a somber gathering at Harry’s bedside. Cleaned up and with all of his wounds bandaged, it was easy to believe that he would live, even for those who had seen him at the cliff. To keep pressure off of his wounded back, Harry was floating an inch or so above the mattress, held there by a hovering charm.</p>
<p>Unable to hold his friend’s hand, Ron contented himself with resting his hand against Harry’s unbroken shoulder while Hermione brushed the hair back from his eyes. It was still stiff with dried blood and saltwater. Fred, George, and Ginny stood at the foot of the bed, while their parents conferred quietly with the professors some distance away. the room was dimly lit, and outside, it had begun to rain. The tableau held, virtually unchanged as night fell. House-elves lit the candles in the wall-sconces, oddly conspicuous as they snuck worried looks at Harry, who still lay unmoving and pale.</p>
<p>it was past midnight when Dobby showed up. His face held an oddly satisfied smile, but Snape didn’t call him on it. He stood on his toes by Harry’s side so he could see his face. After a moment, he turned to Ron. “Harry Potter will be alright?” he asked, his eyes large and questioning. Ron smiled, and clasped the elf’s hand.</p>
<p>“I think so, Dobby. Maybe you should go and ask Madame Pomfrey.” He gestured towards the adults, turning to face them for the first time that evening. His optimism dissipated as he saw them. His mother was crying silently into his father’s arms. She looked as though she had been for quite some time. She tried to hide it when she saw that he was looking, but it was too late.</p>
<p>“Mum?” He left Harry and crossed the room to her side. “What’s wrong?” She just looked mutely past him to where Harry lay. Ron persisted. “Mum, Harry’s my friend. I’m his Secret Keeper. I have the right to know what’s wrong. Please, just tell me!” He had tried to keep his voice low, but Fred had heard, and he, George, Ginny, and Hermione came up behind him. Dumbledore, standing next to Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, sighed deeply and nodded.</p>
<p>“He does have a right to know, Molly. The bond between a Secret Keeper and his charge is as close as blood, maybe closer. I will tell them all, if you would rather not do it yourself.” At Mrs. Weasley’s pallid nod, he proceeded in a grave tone of voice. “Although Harry will most certainly live, he is not ‘alright.’ When his uncle shot him, he severed his spine. It is very unlikely that Harry will never walk again. He is paralyzed, and that’s not all. We had to amputate Harry’s left foot, and his right arm from just above the elbow. they were just mangled too badly for us to save them, although Merlin knows we tried. I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>Everyone had to take a moment to let this news set in. Dobby’s spindly knees gave way, leaving him sitting forlornly on the floor. As Ron was turning to return to his vigil at Harry’s side, Madame Pomfrey spoke up, her voice and eyes teary.</p>
<p>“That’s not all, Albus. I don’t know what that evil muggle did to him, but his eyes...” She turned away, but continued to speak. “His eyes are - burnt. From the inside out. i don’t know how it was done and there was absolutely nothing I could do.” She was crying now, and Dumbledore embraced her, trying to comfort her.</p>
<p>“There, there, Poppy. It’s not your fault. No one is blaming you.”</p>
<p>“But, but I couldn’t...” she sputtered, and he led her away, murmuring consolingly to the distraught witch. The others turned to Professor McGonagall for more answers.</p>
<p>“Does that mean that Harry’s blind, Professor?” asked George quietly. She nodded, looking down at her feet, and Ron blanched, returning to Harry without a word. Suddenly, Ginny burst out.</p>
<p>“Harry can’t be blind, can’t be paralyzed! And by a muggle? He’s the Boy-Who-Lived! He took a Killing Curse from You-Know-Who with only a scar, he’s beaten him three times since then, and a muggle could do this to him?” She looked as though she were about to hit Professor McGonagall, but abruptly, she collapsed to the floor, weeping bitterly with spent rage.</p>
<p>Ron, standing silently by Harry, wept with her for his best friend, the hot tears running down his face. He watched Harry minutely, trying to be only grateful that his friend would live, but unable to avoid glancing furtively at the blanket, where the lumps made by arm and foot should have been, but weren’t. He brought his gaze determinedly back to Harry’s face, trying not to see how the eyes were oddly shadowed through the papery lids.</p>
<p>“Harry,” he whispered fiercely, trying to convince himself with his own words. “It’s OK. Just wake up! That’s what’s important, that you live. You will live. We all know it, you need to know it too.” there was no reaction, but Ron hadn’t really expected one.</p>

<p>Sorry about the wait. School started and I got a bit discouraged by...stuff. So anyway, here’s what happens next.</p>
<p>**This chapter is dedicated to Moonlight, who thinks I’m revolting.**</p>
<p align="center">Chapter 9</p>
<p>By the time the sun rose, only Ron, Hermione, and the twins kept vigil. Ginny had fallen asleep hours ago, immediately after her outburst, and her parents had taken her to the Gryffindor Tower, where they had fallen asleep as well. Madame Pomfrey had retreated to her office, while Dumbledore and McGonagall had each retreated to their own chambers. Snape, trapped in restless thoughts, was prowling the empty castle and scrupulously avoiding the lowest dungeons. Very early that morning, he had had one conversation with the muggle. He did not trust himself to return.</p>
<p>“Why?” he had asked Vernon. Harry’s uncle had cast vainly about in the darkness for the speaker.</p>
<p>“Who’s there?” He sounded frightened, and Snape smiled.</p>
<p>“My name, Mr. Dursley, is Professor Severus Snape, Potion’s Master here at Hogwarts. And I repeat my question. Why did you do what you did?”</p>
<p>Vernon, gathering a modicum of courage, didn’t answer. Snape conjured a light, and Vernon, who had been facing a blank wall, spun around and raised his fists. “Don’t come near me,” he said, posturing threateningly. Snape just laughed lowly.</p>
<p>“Do you want to fight me, muggle? I am a mature, fully trained wizard, in possession of my wand. You wouldn’t have half the chance you gave your nephew. But,” he said, sounding thoughtful, “I would appreciate the chance to show you what I can do to you, if you want.” His voice was light, but somehow managed to sound sinister all the same. Vernon backed down. “That’s better. Now, tell me why!”</p>
<p>Vernon, relenting, spoke sullenly. “That boy has been a thorn in my side since your kind dropped him into my life. He’s insolent, selfish, arrogant, and malicious. I have a son of my own, Dudley, a fine boy. Without Harry to support, I could have given Dudley the kind of life I wanted to give him. Every bite of food that boy ate, every breath of air, was a bite or a breath <em>stolen </em>from my son! Harry was a parasite!” Vernon’s face was flushing with his passion for what he was saying. Snape felt sick. “We paid for his clothing, we scrimped and saved to raise two where there should have only been one. And all of this time, that <em>freak </em>has been hiding a fortune from us, even when he <em>knew </em>that he owed us that money. I f he had died with his parents, when he should have died, that money would have come to Petunia. We <em>deserved </em>that money!”</p>
<p>Snape’s eyes flashed dangerously. “You would have killed Harry Potter for money? Merlin’s Beard, muggle, do you even know who that boy <em>is</em>? Before he was ‘dropped’ into your life, as you so eloquently put it, he had already saved the whole damned world! Have you ever heard the name ‘Voldemort?’ No? Voldemort is the most evil creature ever to darken the face of this earth. He was once a wizard, but he has become something so monstrous, that no one now will speak his name for fear of it. Although his father was a muggle, very much like you, in fact, pompous and a general ass, Voldemort grew to hate all non-magical people. He thought that they were ‘parasites,’ unworthy even to breath the same air. About fifteen years ago, he decided to kill them. All of them. All of <em>you</em>. I believe the muggle news blamed the murders on terrorists or some such. He and his followers destroyed entire towns. He was one of the most powerful wizards ever, but he knew that there was someone who could overthrow him. Harry Potter was not even yet a year old, but Voldemort was afraid of him. He convinced one of James Potter’s best friends, a man named Peter Pettigrew to betray him, and he came for Harry. He killed James and Lily, who gave their lives protecting the boy. But when he tried to curse Harry, the curse rebounded. It destroyed Voldemort, and all Harry got from the encounter was a scar, the Parseltongue powers, and <em>you </em>as a guardian.” His voice was a sneer. “All this as an infant, not even old enough to grasp a wand. And that’s not all he’s done to your benefit, <em>muggle</em>. Voldemort wasn’t killed then, and he’s been regaining power as of late. In Harry’s first year, Voldemort came within a hair’s breadth of taking possession of the Philosopher's Stone, which would have made him immortal and more powerful than ever before. Harry confronted him, <em>alone</em>, and drove him back. His second year, he defeated Voldemort in another form, as well as a basilisk, still alone.</p>
<p>“Now listen well to this, <em>muggle</em>. Last year, Voldemort returned in full, as powerful as ever, but smarter. Harry dueled him, wand to wand, and <em>lived</em>! No one has ever survived a dual with Lord Voldemort. That means that Harry may be <em>the </em>most powerful wizard <em>ever</em>. The entire wizarding world believes that he and only he can defeat Voldemort once and for all. Even if he can’t, he gives us all the hope to fight on. And you, a pompous, posturing, <em>pathetic </em>muggle almost destroyed that hope. If it were up to me, I’d kill you here, would have killed you on that cliff. Or maybe a slow death.” Snape smiled maliciously as he saw Vernon pale. “Slow and painful, drawing it out until Harry himself is strong enough to deal the final blow.</p>
<p>“Harry was never my favorite student, but I have never hated anyone so much as I hate you, you muggle piece of filth. i went to school with Lily. I loved her like a sister and you tried to kill her son. You crippled him and blinded him and for that you should die, but it is not my choice! By wizard law, you will go to Azkaban for the rest of your natural life, but it is Harry’s choice whether or not you spend that tenure in possession of your soul!” With that, Snape had swept out of the cell, leaving a very frightened Vernon to the dark and to Dobby.</p>
<p>Tired of prowling, Snape returned to the Hospital Wing. He stood by the door, not wanting to intrude on the solitude of the four friends gathered around Harry. Ron was talking quietly to the unconcious boy of inconsequential things.</p>
<p>“Fred and George say that they were going to vote for you as Quidditch Captain this year, Harry, and I’ve got a new broomstick, a Nimbus 2001, like what Malfoy’s got, so I might go out for the team. Bill reckons I’d make a good Keeper. Because I’m so tall, I’ve got a long reach.” He didn’t think that talking of playing Quidditch to one blinded and crippled was ridiculous or cruel. Quidditch was important to Harry, and besides. He was asleep and couldn’t hear him.</p>
<p>“Dan got promoted at work, with a <em>huge </em>bonus and a pay raise. That’s how I got my Nimbus. He got us all stuff to celebrate. Ginny got a kitten, Fred and George got a ‘drum-set’ and a ‘guitar,’ whatever they are. Muggle musical instruments, they say, but all they seen to do is make a big row with them.</p>
<p>“I think I told you that Percy moved out, didn’t I? He’s got a small flat in London so he could be closer to the Ministry offices in case there’s an emergency or something.” Ron just kept on talking to Harry as though the boy could hear him. Fred and George had drifted away during the one-sided conversation, and Hermione, unwilling to leave Harry’s side but wanting distraction, had summoned a book from the library. As she read, one hand lay lightly against Harry’s shoulder. Ron kept talking.</p>
<p>“Peter Pettigrew was caught, Harry. Remember Wormtail? That means Sirius Black will be cleared soon. Wormtail’s already fessed up about being your parent’s Secret Keeper, and to working for You-Know-Who. As soon as the paperwork goes through, Black’ll be free! You’ll be able to go and live with him.”</p>
<p>“Ron,” came a slow, breathy voice. “I want to live with you.” It was Harry, his speech hesitant and rough, but clear. Ron and Hermione cried out happily to hear it, and Madame Pomfrey came running from her office.</p>
<p>“You’re awake!” Ron was crying again, this time in exultation as he tried to refrain from hugging the stuffing out of his best friend.</p>
<p>Harry opened his eyes, and then closed them again. “I had hoped it was a dream, but I can’t see at all. Who’s here?”</p>
<p>Hermione answered him. “Ron and me, Hermione, and Fred and George, and Madame Pomfrey. You’re in the Hospital Wing at Hogwarts,” she added before he could ask.</p>
<p>“Madame Pomfrey’s here? Can I please talk to her alone?” He didn’t want to hurt his friends’ feelings, but he wanted privacy as he discovered the extent of his injuries. He knew without being told that they were very serious. Ron and Hermione knew him well enough not to be offended, and they drew the twins out to the corridor, leaving Harry alone with the nurse.</p>
<p>“I can’t feel my legs at all, Madame Pomfrey. Are they... are they gone?”</p>
<p>“No, no,” Pomfrey hastened to assure him. “you still have your legs, Harry, but you are missing one foot. The reason you can’t feel you’re legs is that... Do you remember your uncle shooting you?” At Harry’s pale nod, she continued, trying to be as honest as possible, while easing what she could for the boy. “The bullet destroyed a good deal of you spinal cord, just below your heart. Can you tell me how much you can feel?”</p>
<p>Harry considered this for a moment. “Feeling ends just below my chest, I think. It’s kind of hard to tell.”</p>
<p>Pomfrey nodded before remembering that Harry couldn’t see her. “That’s what I expected. I afraid there was nothing I could do, Harry. I’m so sorry.”</p>
<p>Harry’s face had no expression. “Is it permanent?” was all he said.</p>
<p>“It is.”</p>
<p>Stoically, Harry refused to dwell on this. He moved on to his next concern. “What’s wrong with my arm? I mean, it’s great that I can’t feel it, because between my thumb, er, what was left of my arm and my thumb, it was awful. But I would like to know if I still <em>have </em>an elbow.” Pomfrey heard the panic behind his levity, but let him deal with it in his own way.</p>
<p>“I’m afraid we had to amputate your forearm, Harry, about two inches above the elbow. The bone-ends had sliced the muscle beyond repair, so even if we had left, you wouldn’t have been able to use it. But we couldn’t leave it because infection had set in unbelievably fast. I’m so sorry, so very sorry.”</p>
<p>Harry turned his face towards her voice, his eyes opening sightlessly. “You keep saying that. <em>None </em>of this is your fault. No one, especially not me, will ever blame you. I know you must have done everything you possibly could to help me, and I owe you my life. Now, what else? What about my eyes? Will I ever see again?”</p>
<p>“Your eyes. Now, Harry, I don’t know what your uncle did to you, or even how a muggle did something like this at all. Your eyes were burnt. From the inside out.”</p>
<p>“I know that,” interrupted Harry impatiently. “Uncle Vernon made me drink my potions homework. It was, let me see, it was something to change eye color, and something to make clouds. He mixed them together.”</p>
<p>A startled noise revealed Snape, who was still standing by the door. “Was that the Optichroma Elixir and the Nuageur Potion, Mr. Potter?” he asked anxiously as he strode forward.</p>
<p>Harry and Pomfrey just jumped, startled by his sudden appearance. Harry recovered first. “Those are the ones, Professor. You assigned them.”</p>
<p>Snape sounded very grave as he continued. “Not to sound callous, Potter, but it’s no wonder you are blind. The hornwort and isrythil root in the Optichroma Elixir would have combined with the Salamander skin and breath from the Nuageur Potion to form the Eaufeu Catalyst. Eaufeu reacts with water to start a fire. It should never even come in contact with skin, let alone be taken internally. Fortunately, the Optichroma Elixir must have directed its effects into your eyes.”</p>
<p>“Fortunately?” Harry didn’t sound angry, it was just a question.</p>
<p>“Yes, fortunate, because otherwise the catalyst would have reacted with all the water in your body. You would have burnt to death in an instant.”</p>
<p>“Aren’t I the lucky one?” Harry sounded bitter for the first time since he has woken up. “Any thing else I should know about myself?”</p>
<p>“Well, you’ve heard the worst, Harry. The rest of your injuries aren’t permanent. Your left shoulder is broken, and it remains to be seen whether or not the tendons in that hand will heal properly, but I don’t foresee any problems. Your left leg was broken very badly, and may not heal properly because of the paralysis, but, well, that won’t bother you.”</p>
<p>Harry waited a moment for more, but none was forthcoming. “Is that all?” He had closed his eyes again, but opened them now.</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s all.” murmured Pomfrey.</p>
<p>“Good,” said Harry, his bitterness fading quickly. “Could you fetch Ron and Hermione back in here? I want to see... well, not <em>see </em>them... I just want them here.”</p>
<p>“Of course,” said Snape softly. He shepherded a tearful Madame Pomfrey back to her office, calling for Harry’s friends to come in. They hadn’t gone far, and now they ran in, accompanied by Ginny, who had woken up as well.</p>
<p>“Harry!” shouted Ginny. “You’re awake!” She ran to his side and embraced him impulsively. At her touch, Harry cried out roughly. Ginny jerked back. “Oh Harry! I’m so sorry. What did I do?”</p>
<p>Panting with pain, Harry spoke through clenched teeth. “It’s OK, Ginny, you just bumped my arm.” He held up the stump of his right arm. Seeing it, Ginny gasped and turned pale.</p>
<p>“Oh Harry! I’m so sorry! I didn’t... I’m sorry!” She turned, crying and ran from the room in tears.</p>
<p>“You are OK, Harry?” asked George. Harry turned towards him.</p>
<p>“I’ll be fine, Fred.” The twins looked at each other, embarrassed for their friend.</p>
<p>“Uh, I’m George, Harry. Fred’s on your other side.”</p>
<p>Harry didn’t respond for a long moment. “Guess I’m going to have to get used to being blind,” he said at last. There was a sense of forced calm to his voice. “Hermione, where are you?”</p>
<p>“Here, Harry,” she said quietly, touching his hand gently.</p>
<p>“Hermione, I need you to tell me the truth. How bad do I look?”</p>
<p>She looked helplessly at the others before answering him. “You don’t look nearly so bad as you did when we found you at the cliffs. You’re face is all bruised and scraped, and your neck, but you don’t look dead anymore.” She traced his cut with her fingers to show him where they were. “The worst thing is your eyes. They look... They’re black now, just flat black. No whites, no irises, no shine. Just matte black.” She stopped, waiting for a response.</p>
<p>Harry was silent for a time, apparently absorbing this new information. Then he began to laugh, horrible, manic laughter that built and built until the Hospital Wing echoed with it. Mr. and Mrs. Weasley ran in, and the professors, but they stopped short, unnerved by the awful mirth issuing from Harry. He began to jerk his head wildly from side to side.</p>
<p>“The worst thing about this,” he gasped out, “is that I won’t be able to <em>see </em>the faces of the first years that I’m going to scare.” His voice broke on the last word and the laughter turned abruptly to deep, wracking sobs. He brought his stump up in an attempt to cover his face as tears began to flow. Mrs. Weasley couldn’t stand it. Looking first to Madame Pomfrey for permission, she went to Harry and carefully gathered him into her arms. He turned his face into her shoulder as she cradled him like a small child, rubbing his head gently.</p>
<p>Harry could not remember ever having been held like this, as if by a mother. It was immensely comforting, and he soon fell asleep, tears still marking his cheeks. Emotion and the residue of pain had exhausted him.</p>
<p>“Arthur, I’m going to stay here. You should take the children down to the kitchens and get them something to eat. Ron, Fred, George, you should get some sleep. You too, Hermione. You were all up all night.”</p>
<p>In the end, Mr. Weasley stayed with his wife and Harry. He drew up a chair to sit beside the bed, and he and Mrs. Weasley talked in low voices, careful not to wake the boy.</p>
<p>“Arthur, he’s so thin! So small!”</p>
<p>Arthur nodded, agreeing. “You know, the first time I saw him, I would have taken him for nine or ten, not twelve. He barely looks twelve now, and certainly nothing like fifteen.”</p>
<p>He’s not, yet. His birthday is in two weeks. July 31st. We were planning to invite him over for a surprise birthday party, and them keep him until September.”</p>
<p>“You can still throw him a party, Molly. He’ll probably love it.”</p>
<p>“I would,” said Harry sleepily, having woken up slightly. “I’ve never had one.”</p>
<p>“Oh,” said Mrs. Weasley. “We didn’t mean to wake you up, Harry.”</p>
<p>“’s OK,” he said, his voice still thick with sleep. “Just... keep holding me, would you? I’ve never had that either. It feels good.” He opened his eyes reflexively but closed them quickly when he felt Mrs. Weasley stiffen. “Are they that bad, Mrs. Weasley?” he asked, sounding dejected. She hastened to reassure him.</p>
<p>“No, Harry. They’re just.. a little unnerving, that’s all.” She made her voice as light as she could, but Harry wasn’t fooled.</p>
<p>“I should cover them, I guess. Madame Pomfrey?” he called, raising his voice. She looked out from her office as he continued. “Can I have something to hide my eyes? I don’t want to scare people.” They all heard the caustic undertone in his voice. As Pomfrey ducked back into her office, Mrs. Weasley spoke again to Harry, in an almost-pleading tone.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to hide them, Harry. They just take some getting used to.” Harry cut her off, not rudely, but firmly.</p>
<p>“Mrs. Weasley,” he said sadly. “You flinched when I opened them. I don’t want the people who care about me to draw away from me like that. I couldn’t bear it.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, Harry.”</p>
<p>“No,” he interrupted again, in a stern tone. “Will people please stop apologizing to me? None of this is any of your fault. It’s just stuff I have to get used to, like when I found out I was a wizard, or famous, or a Parseltongue.” This last word was whispered. Harry was almost asleep again. “I’m so tired,” and his head fell back against Mrs. Weasley’s shoulder.</p>
<p>Sorry again that this took so long. As I’m sure everyone knows, school has just started again, and I think I live there now. I have a <em>twelve-hour</em> school day, twenty credit-hours worth of work, plus a forty pound book bag, so I feel in general as though Fred and George have been sitting on my shoulders, one each, and beating me over the head with their Beater’s bats. Not a good day. Consider yourselves all lucky that I want to see this story finished so bad. ‘Till next time, I can only go sideways from here. (Mostly because I can’t stand up straight. Owwch!</p>

<p>Hi. It’s me. Thanks are very overdue to my lovely and diligent Beta, Comechatcha, who is also my sister. {Comechatcha- HA! I get to read these <em>months </em>before any of you peoples do!!!!!!!!!!!} Sorry about her, but she’s right. (Except that it’s weeks, not months.)</p>
<p>Anywho, here is Chapter 10. I hope you like it, and I really, really hope that you <em>review </em>it! Come on, it’s not hard, just a click of the mouse and a moment of thought. I <em>know </em>you can all handle that, right?</p>
<p align="center">Chapter 10</p>
<p>The next time Harry awoke, he couldn’t hear if anyone was near. “Hello?” he called, sounding slightly panicked. “Is anyone there?” When there was no answer, hysteria took him. “Please, don’t leave me alone! He’ll come back! He’ll kill me! Isn’t anyone here?” He wished desperately that he could move, could crawl under the bed and curl up into a tiny, invisible ball. “Please, anyone! I can’t be alone!”</p>
<p>He heard the door slam open and footsteps approach at a run, but his hysteria had a strong hold on his mind. “Help me! He’s here, and he’s going to kill me!” Strong hands gripped his good shoulder and he screamed, a long, high, shriek of terror, his mind seeing Uncle Vernon as the owner of those hands.</p>
<p>“Potter! Potter! Harry! Please, be still! You’re safe. Your uncle can’t touch you here! You’re safe at Hogwarts.”</p>
<p>The words finally got through and Harry stilled. He thought he recognized the voice. “Professor Snape?” he asked, and the hands left his shoulder.</p>
<p>“Yes, Mr. Potter,” was all that Snape said, but Harry didn’t hear any of the usual mocking tone. Something caught at his mind and he spoke it.</p>
<p>“You pulled me out of the water. With Dumbledore.” It wasn’t a question.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Harry turned towards him. “Thank you, Professor,” he said genuinely, smiling wanly. Snape made no response, turning to leave. Harry, hearing him, cried out. “No! You can’t leave me alone!”</p>
<p>Snape sighed. “I told you, Mr. Potter, you are perfectly safe here, even if you are alone. No one will hurt you.” His ordinary tone of exasperation had crept back into his voice.</p>
<p>“I know that, Professor,” Harry said meekly, “but it’s awful, being alone in the dark.”</p>
<p>Snape made an impatient sound. “It’s not dark in here at all, Potter. Every torch is lit...” He stopped dead as Harry’s dead eyes began to water. “Oh God, Harry,” he breathed, sounding horrified at his own words. “That was cruel of me. I’ll stay with you.” He sat down beside Harry, wrapping his robes around him self. “I’m sorry.” From that, the two kept easy company, each wrapped in silent, brooding thoughts. Even after Harry fell back asleep, Snape didn’t move. He didn’t want Lily’s son to wake up alone again.</p>
<p>Nearly a week went by in this fashion, with various combinations of Weasleys and professor’s keeping company with Harry, who slept most of the days and lay awake every night. Ron, Hermione, and Dumbledore spent hours on end talking with him, just unimportant things such as reading to him from the Daily Prophet or what progress the twins had made with Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes. No one mentioned quidditch, now that he was awake, or You-Know-Who, or anything that might distress Harry. They were on eggshells around him, and he let them be so. Still, tears frequently wet the black blindfold he now wore to hide his eyes.</p>
<p>Today, six days after his arrival at Hogwarts, Madame Pomfrey bustled to his side. “How does your arm feel today, Harry?” she asked cheerfully.</p>
<p>“Missing,” he replied, raising his stump in a flippant salute. The bandages had come off two days before.</p>
<p>“Very funny, Harry,” she said dryly. “But I meant your other arm. Can you move you fingers?” she asked, unwinding the bandages from that hand. When he had demonstrated that he could, although the thumb was stiff and unwieldy, she moved to his elbow. He could move that too and Pomfrey sighed in satisfaction. “I think we can take the cast off you shoulder today, Harry. It seems to have healed just perfectly.” With a wave of her wand, the cast fell apart to expose Harry’s should, pale and bone-thin, but whole. “Flex it for me, would you, Harry?” He did, a smile spreading across his face.</p>
<p>“It feels great! A little weak, maybe,” he said, rotating his shoulder.</p>
<p>“That’s to be expected, but with proper exercise, it will be as good as new in no time,” said Madame Pomfrey, beaming. Dumbledore, from his place at the foot of Harry’s bed, spoke up in a bluff, hearty voice.</p>
<p>“To celebrate, Harry, how would you like to go for a nice constitutional around the castle? Professor McGonagall and I have prepared a wheelchair of sorts for you. Are you willing to try it out?” Dumbledore clasped Harry’s hand, guiding it to the sleek arm of the wheelchair.</p>
<p>Harry explored the chair with his fingers for a long while, feeling the smooth wood and brass and the sleek cushions. “Does this mean I get to sit up?” he asked at last, his voice humourous. The tension of the last few moments dissipated immediately as the twin’s and Ron lifted Harry gently into the chair. When they released him, however, he listed slowly to one side. The remnant of his spine, it would appear, couldn’t hold him upright, but even this, he felt was preferable to having to lie one more minute flat on his back. He said so, but added, “Um, this might get uncomfortable after a while, and I’m sure it looks very odd.”</p>
<p>Pomfrey laughed politely. She then tapped the wheelchair with her wand, and it adjusted so that the cushion behind Harry held him upright. He was a little embarrassed that he couldn’t even sit upright, but in the last week, Harry had begun to be resigned to a lot of things that he could no longer do. It was enough for now that he would get out of the Hospital Wing.</p>
<p>Hermione and the Weasley children took turns pushing Harry around the school. The charmed chair did not actually need to be pushed, could in fact merely be told where to go, but they had volunteered. In fact, Fred, George, and Ron had fought for the privilege, a brief scuffle that left them all laughing, Ron in possession of one of the brass handles, Fred the other, and George pushing them both.</p>
<p>Hermione kept up a constant litany of where they were in the castle for Harry. When they were in a corridor on the first floor, Harry interrupted her. “Are we near Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom, Hermione? I want to pay her a visit.”</p>
<p>“Who’s Moaning Myrtle?” asked George, who, never having had the need to go into a girls’ toilet, hadn’t met the mournful ghost. Ron answered him.</p>
<p>“She’s a ghost Harry, Herms and I met in Second Year. She haunts that girls’ lavatory that’s always flooding, and she’s absolutely the most depressing creature you’ll ever meet. What in the world do you want to see.. er, visit her for, Harry?”</p>
<p>“I promised her I would, last year when she helped me figure out the clue in the egg so that I could find you in the lake. I promised her that you would come too,” he added slyly.</p>
<p>“What are you doing, making promises for me?” asked Ron, mock-angry. Harry smiled.</p>
<p>“I didn’t think you’d mind, Ron. After all, you got on <em>so </em>well with her in Second Year.”</p>
<p>“Oh, yeah? Well, It wasn’t me who she invited to share her toilet, was it?” blustered Ron good-naturedly. George and Fred guffawed loudly to hear this.</p>
<p>“Ah ha ha! Potter’s got a ghost for a girl friend!”</p>
<p>Harry blushed affably. “Not quite.”</p>
<p>They turned into the door of the bathroom to be greeted by an unexpected spectacle. Myrtle was lying on the ceiling while reading a transparent comic book. She was laughing uproariously. When she saw the group below her, she stopped quickly and tired to pretend that nothing had happened. But it was too late. They had seen, or in Harry’s case, heard.</p>
<p>“It’s all an act, isn’t it, Myrtle?” asked Harry laconically, smirking like Malfoy. “All that moaning and groaning and junk.”</p>
<p>Myrtle looked offended at first, then puzzled. “Who are you?” she asked, and then she saw past the blindfold. “Harry?!” she shrieked, zooming down to peer at him. “Harry? What happened to you?” She sounded shocked, which was to be expected.</p>
<p>“That’s a long story,” said Harry evasively, “and I’d rather not go into it right now. I just dropped in to say ‘Hi.’”</p>
<p>Myrtle just stood there numbly, her mouth hanging open. When no response was forthcoming, Harry asked “Are you still there, Myrtle?”</p>
<p>“You, you just came to see <em>me</em>?” The last word was a disbelieving squeak from the ghost. She sounded a bit like Dobby, Harry thought.</p>
<p>“Well, not to <em>‘see’ </em>you, exactly,” said Harry wryly. “I don’t <em>see</em> much of anyone these days.” He tapped the cloth covering his eyes. “Listen, though. I have a favor to ask of you. Do you <em>like </em>haunting a toilet?”</p>
<p>Myrtle looked suddenly crafty. “Not really. Did you have something better in mind?”</p>
<p>Harry smiled. “I have something of a little grudge against my Aunt and cousin, Petunia and Dudley Dursley.”</p>
<p>“Wait! Did they hurt you too, Harry?” demanded Ron, his hands balling into fists.</p>
<p>“Calm it, Ron. They didn’t touch me. In fact, Aunt Petunia left Vernon when she found out what he had done to me,” He shuddered slightly at what <em>that </em>had provoked his insane uncle to do to him. “But that’s <em>all </em>she did. She could have called the police or child protection and I would have gotten out of this with only a broken arm and a missing thumb. But she didn’t do anything.” His hand was clenched so tightly onto the arm his chair that his knuckles were white, but his voice was light as he continued. “I read somewhere that ghosts can change their appearance if they want to. Is that true, Myrtle?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” she said eagerly, sounding intrigued.</p>
<p>“Can you look like me? Like I was before, but bloodied up a bunch?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” she said again, sounding excited. She demonstrated, and Hermione described the result to Harry.</p>
<p>“She looks just like you did after the Chamber of Secret’s but even bloodier. And older.” She sounded sly, having deduced Harry’s plans. “It will be perfect!”</p>
<p>“Great. Myrtle, what I’d like you to do is to haunt Petunia and Dudley, looking like that. Not for too long, I don’t want you to get in trouble. Just scare them witless for a week or so. Will you do it?”</p>
<p>“Of course,” cooed Myrtle, enchanted with the idea. “Ooh, this’ll be so much fun!” With that and a shriek of laughter, she rocketed out of the bathroom and down the corridor.</p>
<p>“Well,” said Ron, halfway between approving and shocked. “You certainly made her day.”</p>
<p>I did, didn’t I?” said Harry, sounding suddenly exhausted.</p>
<p>“Should we go back to the Hospital Wing, Harry,” said Ginny, noticing. “It’s almost dinnertime.”</p>
<p>“I suppose we’d better,” he said quietly. “Yummy. Dinner-in-a-Needle.” It wasn’t quite a joke. Due to the injuries and the extant of his paralysis, Harry’s body couldn’t process solid food. Magic had never come up with self-digesting pizza, much to Harry’s displeasure. “Tastes a bit sharp,” he had quipped that morning as Madame Pomfrey slipped the needle into a vein in his arm.</p>
<p>“I think we’ll eat up with you today, Harry” volunteered Fred after a moment’s silent walking.</p>
<p>“No, don’t,” said Harry politely. “I appreciate it, but I don’t think I could stand smelling the food.”</p>
<p>“We’ll have salad, then,” said George brightly. “Can’t smell salad, can you?”</p>
<p>“Indeed you can’t.” Fred agreed. Harry smiled.</p>
<p>“Thanks, guys.”</p>
<p>Back in the Hospital Wing, Harry asked for Dumbledore, who arrived shortly. “Professor,” he asked, “How much longer do I have to stay here, now that I’m ‘up and about?’ I mean, this is as good as I’m going to get, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“I’m afraid it is, for the most part. Harry, although the sensation in your hand may yet improve. Madame Pomfrey wants to keep you here at Hogwarts for a couple more days, for observation. You may, however, move to the Gryffindor Tower, if you would like to sleep in your own bed tonight.”</p>
<p>Harry grinned hugely. “Really? That’d be great. Nothing against you, Madame Pomfrey, but I have spent far too much time in here since my first year.”</p>
<p>She nodded, chuckling. “And I’ve seen too much of you, as well. It’s fine with me, but you will need to come back here for meals, just until I can get you set up to do your own IV’s.”</p>
<p>“How can I do that? I can’t see to get the needle into a vein.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about that. Professor Flitwick is working on a charmed needle for you, one that will insert itself accurately. All you’ll need to do is connect it to the bottle of nutria-potion. But it will take another day or so.”</p>
<p>“All right, then,” Harry said, “Let’s go.” Dumbledore moved to take the handles of the wheelchair, but Harry stopped him. “I can do it, Professor. Chair, take me to the Gryffindor Common Room.” The wheelchair trundled off, slowly enough that Ron and the others had no trouble keeping up. At the stairs, the wheels unfolded into eight spindly legs which carried him smoothly up, holding him perfectly level the entire time.</p>
<p>In the common room, house-elves had already laid a fire. Even in July, the rooms of the castle carried a chill. Harry raised his head as though sniffing the air. “Feels like home.” Everyone laughed, agreeing with him. Exhausted by the days events, he yawned and directed the chair up to the newly-labeled Fifth Year dormitory. Ron helped him into his own poster bed. Harry spoke up tiredly. “I hate this, Ron.”</p>
<p>“I know, Harry,” said Ron, turning to go back to the common room. From behind him came only a light snore. Harry was asleep.</p>
<p>Down in the common room, Dumbledore was engaged in earnest conversation with Mr. and Mrs. Weasley. Harry was the topic.</p>
<p>“Albus, we want to adopt him. He’s already virtually Ron’s brother, and we all want the best for him.” Mr. Weasley leaned forwards, hands clasped with his elbows on his knees. “According to Ron, the first thing he said when he woke up was that he <em>wants </em>to stay with us.”</p>
<p>“What about Sirius, though?” countered Dumbledore. “He’ll be cleared very soon, and he <em>is </em>Harry’s Godfather. Lily and James <em>chose </em>him to take care of Harry.” Dumbledore looked Mr. Weasley squarely in the eye. “My chief concern, Arthur, is Harry’s safety. I’ve failed him twice, I don’t dare do so again. Sirius was an auror, one of the best. If Voldemort or his Death Eaters come for Harry, he has at least a chance of holding them off until help can come. Harry is defenseless right now, he hasn’t even got a wand. We can’t even keep it a secret much longer, because Harry is too much in the public eye. I just feel that he would be safer with Sirius.”</p>
<p>“Albus,” cut in Mrs. Weasley, “What if Sirius were to live with us as well? Three adult wizards would be better than one ex-auror, wouldn’t it?” She sounded hopeful.</p>
<p>“That is an idea, Molly,” mused Dumbledore. “Yes. If Sirius and Harry agree, we can do it your way.”</p>
<p>“Where is he anyway,” asked Ron, walking up to the adults and referring to Black. “Why isn’t he here? Last year, he came running just because Harry’s scar hurt.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Black,” said Dumbledore, “is on an errand for me. And before you ask, no. I can’t tell you the nature of the errand. I can tell you that I expect him back at some point in the next few days. Until then, I can’t get in touch with him at all. He doesn’t know.”</p>

<p>Here we go again.</p>
<p align="center">Chapter 11</p>
<p>The next morning was bright and warm. Harry was sitting by himself in the Great Hall, his face turned upwards to catch the placid light which streamed through the windows. Dumbledore, coming to find him, stood for a moment in silence to watch the boy. Harry looked, not content, but close.</p>
<p>“Good Morning,” he said at last, breaking the silence. Harry started violently.</p>
<p>“Please, Professor. Don’t sneak up on me like that,” he said shakily, pressing a hand to his heart. “I thought I was alone. What are you doing up so early?”</p>
<p>“Oh, I often stroll the school when it’s quiet like this. I quite enjoy it, actually. But today, I was looking for you. You weren’t in your room.”</p>
<p>“No,” said Harry simply. “I wasn’t.” He seemed tranquil, merely absorbing the peace of the morning. “did you want me for something?”</p>
<p>“I was merely wondering if you knew that Hagrid has returned from his envoy to the giants.”</p>
<p>Harry turned to face Dumbledore. “Really?”</p>
<p>“Would I lie to you?”</p>
<p>Harry chose not to answer that. “Does he.. does he know? About this, I mean?” His self-conscious gesture took in the chair, his blindfold, and the stump of his arm.</p>
<p>“No, I am afraid he doesn’t. I thought that you would want to break it to him yourself.”</p>
<p>“You’re right, Professor, but would you please come with me? For backup?”</p>
<p>Dumbledore smiled indulgently. “Of course, Harry.”</p>
<p>Except for Harry’s commands to his chair, neither spoke as they crossed to grounds to Hagrid’s hut. When they reached the steps, however, Harry asked Dumbledore to let him go first. Maneuvering his chair close to the massive door, he knocked firmly. After a moment’s commotion within, the door opened.</p>
<p>“Hello, Hagrid,” said Harry solemnly, removing the blindfold and facing towards where he estimated the half-giant’s face to be. Long moments passed before Hagrid’s reaction came, but it was every bit as explosive as Harry has predicted.</p>
<p>“Bloody ‘ell, Harry! What happened?” Hagrid’s voice was rough with shock and dismay. “Who did this? Professor Dumbledore” the Headmaster had come up quietly behind Harry, putting his hand on his shoulder. Harry was grateful for the support.</p>
<p>“Hagrid,” started Harry, then he turned to Dumbledore. “I don’t think I can do this.” His voice shook.</p>
<p>“Do you want me to explain, Harry?” asked Dumbledore in a kind undertone. Harry nodded.</p>
<p>Sitting down at Hagrid’s enormous table and drinking tea, Dumbledore explained the whole matter. Quite understandably, Hagrid was enraged that anyone, let alone Harry’s own uncle, would do such damage. At one point, he gripped his mug of tea so hard that it shattered. During the interruption as it was cleaned up, Dumbledore decided that it would not be prudent at this time to reveal that Vernon Dursley was in the castle.</p>
<p>When Dumbledore had finished, Harry spoke up. “Hagrid? Are you OK?”</p>
<p>Hagrid’s rage cooled instantly and his voice filled with tenderness. “Am <em>I </em>OK? Merlin’s Beard, Harry! Are <em>you </em>OK? It’s not me as was thrown off a cliff!”</p>
<p>“I’m OK, Hagrid, or at least I will be. Could we talk about something else now?” So they did, and they were still talking by the time Ron came to fetch Harry for Madame Pomfrey. Dumbledore stayed back a moment, he and Hagrid watching as Ron pushed Harry across the grounds towards the school.</p>
<p>“’E’s a verra brave boy,” said Hagrid softly, wiping his eyes on an enormous handkerchief.</p>
<p>“He has to be,” agreed Dumbledore, just as softly. “We all depend on his courage.”</p>
<p>Back in the castle, breakfast was laid out in the Great Hall. Harry was sitting in his normal spot at the Gryffindor Table, the bench cut away there to allow for his chair. Around him, Hermione and the Weasleys ate, talking cheerily when Harry heard an owl land on the table.</p>
<p>“What’s that?” he asked, hearing the rustle of someone opening a post.</p>
<p>“It’s my subscription to the Daily Prophet,” said Hermione from his right. “Harry! You’re on the front page! Oh, it’s Rita Skeeter again. Here, let me read it to you.</p>
<p>“Does the Boy-Who-Lived yet live?” she said, reading the headline.</p>
<p>“As the wizarding world knows, ever since the tragic deaths of his parents at the hands of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, Harry Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived, has lived with his muggle family, his Aunt, Uncle, and one cousin. Until very recently, however, the location of said family was a closely guarded secret of the Ministry of Magic, kept in order to protect Harry from He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. Early Tuesday afternoon, however, one week ago today, that secret was blown. Harry Potter has been raised by Vernon and Petunia Dursley, along with his muggle first cousin, Dudley Dursley. They have lived in Little Whinging, Surrey, in what muggles call a suburb, at Number 4, Privet Drive.</p>
<p>“The reason that this secret no longer need to be kept is that Harry Potter is no longer at Number 4 Privet Drive. This reporter can exclusively reveal that muggle authorities discovered Mr. Dursley’s automobile abandoned near Dover last Tuesday, with no sign to be found of the Dursleys or of the Boy-Who-Lived. A thorough search of their house and properties revealed no clues as to their whereabouts, although there were indications of violent struggles, both at the house and in Dover. When Ministry officials investigated, they discovered that, while none of the Dursley’s possessions were so much as disturbed, nothing belonging to Harry was to be found, save his wand, which was discovered, broken into several pieces in Mr. Dursley's automobile. Faced with this grim evidence, this reporter can only hypothesis that Dark Forces have managed to capture Harry Potter. Until there is more evidence one way or the other, we at the Daily Prophet urge our readers not to panic. Anyone with any relevant information should please contact the Ministry as soon as possible, and we will keep you updated as to any changes in the situation.”</p>
<p>Harry was shocked. Since his first year, he had become used to being constantly under public scrutiny, and even more so since the Triwizard Tournament. The idea that no one knew where he was was actually appealing. Dumbledore spoke before Harry could, once again seeming to read his mind.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, Harry, but we will have to tell them that you are here and not in the clutches of the dark. The panic your disappearance must have caused, I neglected to take that into account. Yes, what we must do is prove that you are in safe hands, immediately. Are you up for a visit to London?” Harry nodded, somewhere between amused and apprehensive. He did have a question, though.</p>
<p>“Won’t my... injuries cause people to worry, too, Professor?”</p>
<p>“We shall have to explain as frankly as possible. This, perhaps, would be the ideal time to turn your uncle over to the proper authorities.”</p>
<p>“My uncle...is... He’s here?” Harry’s voice, calm if nonplussed a moment ago, now held an edge of barely-controlled hysteria. “He’s been here the whole time?”</p>
<p>“He is in the lowest dungeon, nearly a mile below our feet,” said Dumbledore soothingly, “and Dobby guards his cell quite diligently, along with all of the suits of the armor in the castle. You are in no danger whatsoever. You will never even have to hear his voice again, unless you so desire, save at the trial.”</p>
<p>“A trail?” Harry perked up. “Will he go to Azkaban?”</p>
<p>“He will,” said Dumbledore sagely. “When he has had a proper trail. Under normal circumstances, wizard law is very much like muggle law, but we have stricter sentences for crimes of this sort.”</p>
<p>Harry smiled, sad, but smug. “I’ll be glad to tell a jury what he did and what he tried to do. Is attempted murder enough to send him to Azkaban for life?”</p>
<p>“Extravagant theft, extreme child abuse, torture, <em>and </em>attempted murder are enough to send him there for <em>several </em>lifetimes.”</p>
<p>“All that, eh?” mused Harry. “Well, what are we waiting for?”</p>
<p>“I just need to make one arrangement first, Harry. Be patient. Severus,” called Dumbledore to the professor who had just entered the Hall. “Severus, could you please collect Vernon Dursley and take him down to the Hogsmead Station? Put him in a secure car, if you can get one, and have the train wait for us. We’ll be along shortly.” To his amazement, Harry thought he heard a low chuckle as Snape swept out of the Hall, on his way to do the Headmaster’s bidding.</p>
<p>“Did Snape just...laugh?” he murmured to an equally thunderstruck Ron, sitting beside him.</p>
<p>“Yeah!” whispered Ron back. “And he had a real weird look on his face, like he was looking forward to something... tasty.”</p>
<p>“Harry,” said Dumbledore, “What are we waiting for?”</p>
<p>Hermione and the Weasleys, of course, insisted on accompanying them, and they picked up Hagrid as they crossed the grounds, so it was a full ten people who met Snape on Platform 61/5 in Hogsmead. Ron described the scene for Harry, for the train present was not the familiar Hogsmead Express. This train, according to Ron, looked like a bullet train, sleek and black, with only a few cars. One of the cars, the last, had heavy shutters closing its windows. Harry and company boarded the first.</p>
<p>Only once the train had been underway for more than an hour did apprehension overtake Harry. He really did not relish the idea of the entire wizarding world knowing how badly he had let his uncle, a mere muggle, beat him. Draco would be insufferable. As he sat there, his rage against the muggle in question grew until all that his mind’s eye could see was his uncle’s smirking, triumphant face when Harry had given in that first time, a week and a half and a lifetime ago. He did not know that his hand was clenching tighter and tighter into a fist, could not know that his best friends sat across form him, watching him grit his teeth and cry silent tears into his blindfold. He was startled when Ron spoke.</p>
<p>“Harry. Just remember, we’re here with you. You count on our support, no matter what.” With the murmurs of agreement from the rest in his ears, Harry relaxed, the fury turning into a determined sort of courage.</p>
<p>“Professor Dumbledore?” he asked, his voice controlled and older than his years would account for. “I would like to talk to Vernon now, before we reach London.” He didn’t offer an explanation, and nobody asked for one. Dumbledore merely led Harry in his chair back, out of their car, through the second, where several wizards and witches stared curiously, and to the final car, where a guard stood attentively in front of a solidly barred door. At Dumbledore's nod, he unlocked the door and stood aside. Harry went n alone.</p>

<p align="center">Chapter 12</p>
<p>At first, Harry couldn’t hear anything save his own tense breathing. “Uncle Vernon?” he ventured softly. A chain rattled as someone shifted.</p>
<p>“Boy? Is that you?” Vernon sounded somewhere between belligerent and in pain. Harry responded sarcastically.</p>
<p>“Of course. Don’t you recognize your own handiwork?” He spread his arms, first taking off the blindfold. He stared towards his uncle’s voice, satisfied to hear an indrawn breath. “What? Aren’t you proud of what you’ve done?”</p>
<p>“Of course not!” Vernon now sounded whiney, his voice shaky and pleading. Harry was reminded forcibly of Wormtail. “I was drunk, and you provoked me. You know that I would never have done those things if I were sober. You know it’s not my fault.” Harry was disgusted by his sniveling.</p>
<p>“You have no excuse!” he snapped. “People get drunk all the time without cutting someone’s finger off, or shooting them and throwing them off a cliff. Especially a member of their own family. You did all of this on purpose, out of sheer greed and bloody mindedness. You meant to kill me so I couldn’t turn you in for stealing so much money. So I wouldn’t be a ‘nuisance’ to you anymore. Well, after the trial, you’ll be rid of me and I’ll be rid of you. For the rest of my life. Just so you know, after the trial, I plan never to think of you again. You on the other hand, I am sure, will think of me everyday for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>Vernon whimpered. “What... what is Azkaban?”</p>
<p>“Oh, you’ve heard about that, have you?” Harry grinned maliciously. “Do you by any chance remember that criminal who escaped right before I blew up Marge? It was on all the news. Anyway, that was Sirius Black. My Godfather. The prison that he escaped from was Azkaban, the worst of wizard prisons. The guards there are not humans, but Dementors instead.” Harry couldn’t repress a small shudder, but Vernon didn’t see it. “Dementors are evil, soul-sucking creatures that drain all the happiness from you, making you relive the worst moments of your life over and over again until you go mad. Just so you know, I see my parents dying to save me. Oh!” Harry’s face suddenly lit up. “One more thing about the Dementors. Muggles like you can’t even see them.” By now, Harry could hear Vernon hyperventilating. “I'll leave you with that pleasant train of thought. See you at the trial.” He waved ironically, backing his chair out of the cell. Dumbledore was waiting for him.</p>
<p>“A little harsh?” he said but his tone was laughing. Harry didn’t answer, merely smiled in satisfaction. “I guess not.”</p>
<p>When the crowd disembarked at Platform 93/4, a ministry car was waiting for them. Harry, unable to see where they were going, was a little carsick by the time they stopped. Hermione described their destination as an imposing stone building, squat against a cloudy sky. Despite its awkward proportions, she was all but speechless over the spectacular carvings that decorated the facade. She illustrated to him with words how they portrayed the flight, deaths, and rebirths of an entire flock of phoenixes. Harry, thinking fondly of Fawkes, wished desperately that he could see it himself.</p>
<p>Inside, the first thing that the group encountered was a wizard running at full tilt down the stairs in front of them.</p>
<p>“Arthur! Arthur Weasley! Where have you been? Ever since the Potter boy disappeared, Fudge has been looking for you like mad. We all know it’s not your department, but seeing as he’s a friend of you son,...” The man shrugged. “The Minister thought you might know something.”</p>
<p>Mr. Weasley finally got a word in. “I’ve been at Hogwarts the whole time. Why didn’t you just send me an owl?”</p>
<p>“We tried! They just came straight back, with their letters still attached.”</p>
<p>“Dad!” a voice interrupted. It was Percy. He ran over to his parents, embracing them both. “Merlin, Dad!” he said chastisinglly. “Where’ve you been? Fudge wants you ‘cause of Ron being Harry’s friend and all that. He’ll want to see you immediate, so come on. You too,” he said presumptively upon seeing Dumbledore. Harry realized that no one had noticed him, sitting as he was in the back of the group, in front of Hagrid.</p>
<p>“Excuse me,” he said quietly, but the babble that flowed around him did not so much as falter. He drew a deep breath and bellowed. “Hey!”</p>
<p>Silence fell. Harry could almost sense all eyes on him as he wheeled his chair forwards, towards Percy. “I believe, Percy, that Fudge will want to see <em>me</em>.”</p>
<p>Murmurs and whispers raced around the room.</p>
<p>“Can it be?”</p>
<p>“Potter?”</p>
<p>“What could have...”</p>
<p>“He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named?”</p>
<p>“What could have happened to him?”</p>
<p>“Y-yes,” stuttered Percy, trying to regain his composure. “Yes. Well, then. Come on. He’s in his office, upstairs.”</p>
<p>Harry allowed Hagrid to push his chair up the stairs as they followed Percy to the office of the Minister of Magic. Harry hadn’t told anyone, but his chest still hurt and that shout had cost him. He was just now catching his breath when they stopped. He could hear voices, indistinct beyond a closed door. Harry smiled ruefully to recognize both Rita Skeeter and ‘Corny’ Fudge. Percy cautiously opened that door, clearly expecting the greeting that he received.</p>
<p>“Weasley?” Fudge sounded cross but relieved, as though any interruption was welcomed. Rather than make Percy explain, Harry intervened by rolling forward directly into Fudge’s view. The Minister, seeing him, swept down on him immediately.</p>
<p>“Harry Potter?” he asked tentatively. Harry nodded. The next second, he yelped in surprise as Fudge embraced him soundly. “Thank Merlin you’re safe!” he said fervently. “Your house, empty, blood everywhere, your wand broken... We were so afraid that You-Know-Who had taken you.” As he released Harry, he felt the older man shudder once, hard. “We need to inform the world that you’ve been found that, you’re safe. Ms. Skeeter? I need the Daily Prophet to deliver an Extra edition immediately!”</p>
<p>“Of course, Minister.” Harry swiveled to face her voice, surprised by her deferential tone. “I’ll just need a few more details. Headmaster Dumbledore, Mr. Potter, will you please explain to me for our readers the details of just what happened?”</p>
<p>And so Harry had to tell everyone of that awful weekend, and he did, in all its gory detail. He had forgotten none of it and he never would. Neither would those who were gathered in Fudge’s office. Harry’s audience grew as he spoke, staff members of the Ministry drifting in as the news spread. He warmed to his telling, feeling encouraged by the supporting murmurs of those around him. At one point, when he was describing the discompassionate doctor who had refused to help him, he felt Mr. Weasley’s hand on his shoulder, buttressing his courage. Strengthened, he continued.</p>
<p>When his story neared its end, telling of Vernon shooting him, of his words as he threw Harry over the cliff, he could hear rumbles of outrage all around him. Comforted by this, he finished his tale with his rescue by Dumbledore and Snape. Done, he found himself exhausted and sweating. He let Dumbledore answer the inevitable questions, rousing only when he had to.</p>
<p>Rita Skeeter, of course, had the most questions. “What is the extant of Harry’s injuries?” was her first, and Dumbledore listed them, eliciting more expressions of anger and sympathy. He was very patient, waiting until every single query was satisfied before turning to Fudge.</p>
<p>“Cornelius, what else I have to say requires a modicum of privacy.”</p>
<p>“Of course, of course,” agreed Fudge. He herded the crowd out, leaving the delegation from Hogwarts, plus Percy, alone with him. Dumbledore spoke without preamble.</p>
<p>“Presently, Professor Snape will be arriving here with Vernon Dursley. We expect him to be put to a rapid trial.”</p>
<p>“you have him?” Fudge sounded delighted. “Wonderful! Of course we’ll put him to trial. The public will want to see retribution, won’t they? Tomorrow! The trial will be tomorrow! Do you think, Harry, that your aunt would testify against her husband? We’ll have to find her first, of course. You do know where she went, right?” He didn’t even hear Harry’s “no,” continuing anyway in a relieved babble. “You should stay here in London. All of you.” He looked up to include the rest of Harry’s group. “We’ll just get you rooms in the Leaky Cauldron, and you can come straight back here tomorrow morning. Yes. The best thing is to get this whole mess behind us as fast as humanly or magically possible. Between you and me, this has been one disaster after another with public relations.” He stopped suddenly, realizing that he had gone one step too far. Harry wasn’t very offended. Rather, he laughed softly, shaking his head. He had realized early on that his eyes, unsettling as they were, were effective as a tool to shock people into paying attention to what he had to say. Now, he untied his blindfold, which was white today, awkward with his one hand. The trick worked now as he stared in Fudge’s direction.</p>
<p>“You should consider yourself lucky, Fudge, that that is your only disaster.” He was irritated, as always, by the Minster’s attitude. Fudge stood silently, his mouth opening and closing uselessly. He seemed to realize how he had just wronged Harry</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, Harry,” he said, but Harry didn’t feel like listening to the officious little man a moment longer.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, Minister,” he said, the very image of cordiality. “But I am very tired. My stamina, well, I have none. Did you mention rooms at the Leaky Cauldron?”</p>
<p>Faced with that, all that Fudge could do was escort Harry’s party to Diagon Alley.</p>

<p>I just had to give you all a little break while I find Vernon. It’s kind of a long story. You see, Harry ran away with Waccu (From the Tenchi series) last night, and before anyone could stop him, that nasty muggle Vernon ran out after them. Harry and his new wife returned after a few hours, but we’ve seen neither hide nor hair of Vernon. We have to get him back before we can put him on trial. Also, we have arrangements to make for a party. So, see you as soon as I can.</p>
<p><br/><br/>##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### #####<br/><br/>Chapter: 14<br/><br/></p>
<p>Just so you know, we found Vernon. He was hiding under a rock.</p>
<p>Just so you know, the Intermission was Chapter 13, just so I can keep it all straight.</p>
<p>Chapter 14</p>
<p>Fudge was true to his word. Before noon the next day, yet another ministry car collected Harry and company, taking them back to the Ministry building. Following a ministry aide through labyrinthine corridors, Harry had time to reflect. He relished the idea of Vernon getting his due with a visceral, almost bloodthirsty pleasure. It actually unnerved him, how much he was looking forward to this, but before he could dwell on it, his chair stopped.</p>
<p>Around him, Harry could hear a rumble of voices, echoing slightly as if off the walls of a very large room. The crowd sounded excited, almost as if they were there to see a quidditch match, but there was a clear underlying current of anger.</p>
<p>“Hermione?” Harry whispered, groping for her hand. Finding it, he continued. “Where are we? Describe it to me.”</p>
<p>Harry’s hunch was satisfied. The room that Hermione described was the self-same room that he had seen last year, when he had fallen into Dumbledore’s pensieve. The fact that he had ‘seen’ this place with his own eyes was somewhat comforting.</p>
<p>“Harry Potter!” The cry raced around the room as the crowd spotted him. Silence fell next as Dumbledore guided Harry to his place at the front of the room, Hermione still at his side to act as his eyes.</p>
<p>“All rise for the Honourable Judge Nicholas Longbottom,” a voice rang out. Dumbledore, seeing Harry's confusion, whispered to him under the noise of the standing crowd.</p>
<p>“Neville Longbottom’s uncle, his father’s older brother. And yes, he does know of your friendship with his son.”</p>
<p>Harry smiled, almost pitying his uncle. Even the judge would be prejudiced against him!</p>
<p>Then Vernon was led in. The crowd, which had just sat down, surged back to their collective feet in a massive, howling wave. They booed him violently, showering him with garbage and derisive fury. Harry, heartened still more by this, laughed at his uncle’s incoherent attempts to defend himself. Then there was a metal sound. Harry stiffened, remembering vividly that small noise, back at the cliff, but here it was only the clink of the chains holding Vernon to the chair in the center of the room. Harry relaxed again.</p>
<p>The jury entered next. 18 anonymous witches, wizards, and even muggles who would decide the fate of the accused. The trial began.</p>
<p>Harry’s solicitor, who he had met earlier that morning, was a witch by the name of Joanne D’Arche. He had liked her immediately. She was vibrant, her voice animated as she laid out concise plans to show Harry's uncle in the worst possible light, which, as she said, would not be very hard. As the prosecution, she gave her statement first. Once again, Harry had to listen to a retelling of those ghastly days. Ms. D’Arche didn’t exaggerate at all. She didn’t have to; the jury was obviously on Harry’s side. They murmured sympathetically at each pause and, although Harry couldn’t see it, shot frequent glares at the hapless Vernon.</p>
<p>D’Arche wrapped up her account, smiling triumphantly towards Vernon and his solicitor, an average-looking wizard who had been appointed by the Ministry to his defense. It was clear that, while he would do his job, he strongly disliked his charge. he was on Harry’s side too. His statement was short and convinced nobody at all of Vernon’s innocence. He claimed that Harry had run away, stealing his car, and that he didn’t know how the boy had been injured. His story was debunked immediately, however, with Dobby was called to the stand as the first witness. He had seen Harry’s uncle throw Harry from the cliff. Dumbledore followed, and even Snape gave testimony, and then it was Harry’s turn.</p>
<p>He had been told that morning what to expect. Instead of an oath to tell the truth, he was given a drop of Veritaserum, and then D’Arche began to question him.</p>
<p>“Harry, can you see me?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Why not?”</p>
<p>“My uncle Vernon Dursley made me drink my potions’ homework.”</p>
<p>“How did he force you to drink that?”</p>
<p>“He had a knife.”</p>
<p>“And the potions, what were they?”</p>
<p>“The Optichroma Elixir and the Nuageur Potion.” Snape had already testified to this, telling the audience of that infelicitous combination, so Harry received moans and sighs of sympathy from the audience and the jury. Ron and Hermione gasped, remembering Professor Snape’s strict injunctions on the properties of the catalyst.</p>
<p>D’Arche continued in a similar vein for Harry’s arm, going so far as to bring in the knife and the severed thumb as evidence. They had been recovered by wizarding law enforcement officers before Harry had been ‘found.’ All in all, the audience was calling for Vernon’s blood by the time Harry returned to his place by Dumbledore and Hermione, and D’Arche still had two more witnesses. The first of these was Aunt Petunia.</p>
<p>When she first saw Harry sitting there in the courtroom, she let out a shrill scream. “You... I saw you dead! I saw your ghost!” she stammered pointing at him with a shaking hand. Harry laughed.</p>
<p>“No, I assure you, I am quite alive,” he said, “no thanks to you.” He refused to say anything more to the shaken woman. Trembling and speaking straight to Harry, she told the court of what she had seen. Harry, cowering in fear of his drunken uncle, his broken arm and absent thumb, and the money. Bloody money, she called it. The whole time she avoided looking at Harry, but her voice pleaded a forgiveness which Harry refused to supply. D’Arche picked up on this.</p>
<p>“Why didn’t you tell anybody, Mrs. Dursley? Even if you had just made an anonymous telephone call to the muggle police, Harry would have been rescued before losing anything more than a thumb.” Petunia tried to mutter something about being afraid of Vernon and retribution, but the Veritaserum wouldn’t let her and neither would D’Arche. “It wasn’t Vernon, fear of the defendant that held your tongue, Mrs. Dursley. After all, you and your son were safe, away from your husband. Only Harry stood to be hurt.” Petunia’s thoughts had been obvious, and D’Arche’s voice dripped with scorn. “You just didn’t bother. You let your own nephew, your <em>dead sister’s </em>only son, blood of your blood, be crippled and blinded in the hands of a monster! You would have let him <em>die</em>!” She gestured fervently towards Harry. “The only remnant of your only sister. Did you love her so little, and hate him so much?” This was the last straw for Petunia, who burst into tears and was dismissed from the stand. Still sobbing, she ran out of the courtroom.</p>
<p>Last for the prosecution was the indifferent doctor. Harry bristled to hear his expressionless voice and D’Arche tore into him even worse than she had Petunia. He would be charged himself, at a later date, along with Petunia and Dudley for criminal negligence. From him, however, D’Arche could not provoke a reaction. He delivered his testimony accurately but without emotion, even when speaking of Harry’s pleas or of his desperate run for help. She dismissed him as quickly as she could, invisibly unnerved by his coldness.</p>
<p>Now it was the defense’s turn. Vernon himself was his only witness, and his attempt was pathetic. Under the influence of Veritaserum on the stand, he contradicted his earlier claim, actually confessing to the truth. D’Arche never even bothered to question him herself. The trial was over. The jury did not have to deliberate at all to declare Vernon Dursley guilty of all charges, criminal child abuse, assault with intent to cripple and maim, and attempted murder, as well as grand larceny for the money stolen.</p>
<p>With that, it was over. Judge Longbottom wasted no time at all sentencing Vernon to a life in Azkaban. He called Harry forward to the bench.</p>
<p>“Mr. Potter,” he said gravely. “As the injured party here, under wizard law you have a choice to make. Your uncle will spend the rest of his life in the confines of Azkaban. You must decide whether or not he receives the Kiss.”</p>
<p>Actually, it’s up to <em>you</em>, the reader to decide whether or not Dursley gets Kissed. I will count the votes for and against at 3:00 tomorrow (Monday, January 20, PST) afternoon and post the appropriate chapter soon after. So, you must tell me what you think.</p>
<p><br/><br/>##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### #####<br/><br/>Chapter: 15<br/><br/></p>
<p>*Here’s the next chapter. Sorry it’s so short, but it’s really just the end of the last chapter, Harry’s decision and some other stuff. Remember, you, the reader, chose this. (If you voted yes, you can read that version at .net. The link is .?id=1914)</p>
<p>Chapter 15</p>
<p>“No.” Harry had decided this already. He was tempted, but he had a personal horror of the Dementors and could not even wish them on his worst enemy. Well, maybe Voldemort, but not Vernon. “I want him to enjoy the atmosphere at Azkaban,” he explained over Vernon’s frantic expressions of relief. He turned away, grinning vindictively. “I think he should have Sirius Black’s old cell, don’t you, Dumbledore?” Those close to him were too stunned to react, but Neville’s uncle appreciated the humour.</p>
<p>I’m glad you mentioned Black, Mr. Potter,” he said. “The Minister has something of an announcement to make about him.”</p>
<p>Hearing this, Fudge stood up. “I have an announcement to make,” he said loudly, drawing the room’s attention and stilling the many peripheral conversations that had sprung up about the sentencing and Harry’s choice. “Two weeks ago, auror’s found Peter Pettigrew near Godric’s Hollow.” He had to raise his voice to be heard over the murmurs and shouts of incredulity. “He has agreed, under threat of Azkaban and the Kiss, to help the side of the light against the return of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.” Hearing no expressions of surprise at this, Harry realized that Voldemort’s return was now accepted as valid fact. “He has also testified, under full Veritaserum, to the innocence of Mr. Sirius Black in the deaths of Lily and James Potter.”</p>
<p>Harry, the Weasleys, Hermione, and Dumbledore all cheered raucously as Fudge laid the documents in Harry’s hand. Harry was happy beyond belief.</p>
<p>All in all, it was a heady day for Harry. And it got better, for as they left the Ministry building, a voice cried out.</p>
<p>“Harry!” It was Sirius, running up to them from a muggle taxi. “Harry!”</p>
<p>“Sirius!” Harry was overjoyed to hear his godfather’s voice. He waved the pardon papers at him. “You’re free, Sirius! You’re clear! Fudge pardoned you!”</p>
<p>“And I missed it.” Sirius sounded disappointed, but still ecstatic at his freedom. “I’m more upset that I missed your uncle’s trial. What’s important is; how are <em>you</em>?”</p>
<p>Harry was relieved that he would not have to explain his state to his temperamental Godfather. “I’m fine, Padfoot, as good as I’m going to get. Vernon’s gone. They apparated him straight to Azkaban. I know you’d like to kill him, but this is better. They’re giving him your old room, I hear.” He smirked and Black laughed, patting his shoulder firmly.</p>
<p>“You’re right, Harry. Azkaban and a life without a life is right for him. Death would be too good.”</p>
<p>“I just want to forget that Vernon ever existed, alright? I told him I would, and that’s all I need right now.”</p>
<p>“You’re right again, m’boy,” said Sirius with a determined heartiness. “I’ll not speak of it again. So, you’re staying at the Leaky Cauldron?”</p>
<p>Harry nodded. “We all are,” he said, gesturing to the small crowd around him.</p>
<p>“Have dinner with us,” invited Mrs. Weasley. “it can be celebration, both for Harry and for you.”</p>
<p>“Better than that,” cut in George.</p>
<p>“We’ll throw a party!” finished Fred.</p>
<p><br/><br/>##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### #####<br/><br/>Chapter: 16<br/><br/></p>
<p>*On with the fic!*</p>
<p>Chapter 16</p>
<p>“Better than that,” cut in George.</p>
<p>“We’ll throw a party!” finished Fred.</p>
<p>And so they did. Tom, the innkeeper at the Leaky Cauldron, was only too glad to host a celebration for the Boy-Who-Lived, and Sirius, as his godfather, was given the royal treatment. Fred and George orchestrated the entertainment, which consisted of them doing satires of muggle magic tricks. they had found Lee Gordon with his family in Diagon Alley and pulled him into the act too. Between the three of them, they had everyone in the pub clutching their sides and howling with laughter. Even Professor Dumbledore, who had volunteered to take a turn narrating for Harry so that Hermione could go and dance with Ron, could hardly speak for laughing. Harry, who couldn’t have danced if he wanted to, certainly did not begrudge his best friends the chance.</p>
<p>Percy, in a move totally out of character for him, had pulled a few strings and gotten a band. Although Harry had never heard of the London 4, they were, apparently, a very big deal in popular wizarding music. Ginny spent the entire evening standing at the back of the room, staring forlornly at the drummer, a teen named simply Trick.</p>
<p>All in all, the party was a grand success. Witches and wizards had poured in from the street as the news spread until the party had to expand into Diagon Alley. Magical fireworks lit the sky and the twins were doing a roaring trade in pranks. After the first hour, no one even paid attention when a nearby individual burst out in feather, merely continuing their revelry as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>The sun was nearly up when the last reveler went home. A yawning Mrs. Weasley offered to help clean up, but an equally exhausted Tom refused, pushing her towards the stairs and saying that he had help who would do the work later that morning. “Just sleep it off, dear,” he said. “This is my job.” She didn’t protest as he shooed her to her room.</p>
<p>Harry wasn’t tired at all. He sat, wide-eyed and content, listening to the silence that fell as Tom left for his own chambers. Well, not quite silence. Hagrid and Dobby had fallen asleep in a booth, Dobby lying across the half-giant’s chest and using his beard as a blanket. They both snored.</p>
<p>At some point during the festivities, Harry had come to an agreement with himself. This body, broken though it may be, was his. He would not be ashamed of it, would not blame himself for what his uncle had done. Gryffindors were strong and brave and he, Harry Potter, was a Gryffindor.</p>
<p>Morning came and went and, just before noon, Ron descended, rubbing his eyes. “You still here, Harry?” he asked with some surprise. “Didn’t you sleep at all?”</p>
<p>“Nope,” said Harry brightly. “Too happy to sleep. I never have to live with the Dursleys again! No more cupboard, no more awful summers.”</p>
<p>“We need to talk abut that, Harry.” Dumbledore’s voice came from the direction of the stairwell, but Harry heard more than one pair of feet.</p>
<p>“Who’s with you?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Mr. Black, and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley,” responded the aged wizard, understanding Harry’s need to know who was around him. “We’re going to settle that very issue this morning. You see, both Mr. Black and the Weasleys have offered to adopt you. Sirius, as your godfather, was James’ and Lily’s choice, but they didn’t know Molly and Arthur.”</p>
<p>Sirius spoke up. “Harry, I’ll understand if you choose them. I’m a confirmed bachelor, and very much unused to having to share my life. I honestly don’t know what type of father I would be.” his voice was very earnest. Harry knew that, although his godfather loved him, he wanted him to choose the Weasleys for his own good. He had already made his decision, but he let Ron’s parents speak first.</p>
<p>“I know that Sirius is your godfather, Harry, but we,” Here Mr. Weasly gestured to himself and his wife. “We think that you might be happier at the Burrow. I mean, you and Ron are all but brothers already.”</p>
<p>“Also, Harry,” interjected Mrs. Weasley. “With us, there are more people to help you if you need it.”</p>
<p>“But I don’t <em>need </em>help,” Harry started to say, but she overrode him.</p>
<p>“I know you don’t <em>want </em>to depend on anyone, Harry, but the truth is you have to now. I’m going to be very frank with you. You can’t even get yourself out of bed, or dressed. Please, let us help you.”</p>
<p>Harry wished vainly that he could see their faces, see what they were feeling beyond what bled into their voices. They sat silently for a moment before he spoke. He faced Sirius.</p>
<p>“Padfoot,” he said, using Sirius’s nickname from Hogwarts. “I’m sorry. I want to stay with Ron’s family.” He turned to his friend. “If you really want me.”</p>
<p>The next second his breath was knocked from his lungs as Ron hugged him fiercely. “Of course we want you!” The impact knocked him loose from the grip of his chair and he slumped sideways. He fell to the floor when Ron, acting instinctively, released him. “Oops, sorry Harry. Did I hurt you?” He sounded appalled at the idea, and Harry couldn’t do anything but lift his arms.</p>
<p>“Up?” he said mockingly in the voice of a very young child. Everyone laughed, once again diffusing a tense situation. Mr. Weasley lifted Harry back into his chair.</p>
<p>“Of course we want you, Harry. There is nothing we want more. Our home is your home.”</p>
<p>“I know,” said Harry, sobering. “but I need to go to Privet Drive first. All of my stuff’s still there, and I’ll need it.” He wasn’t looking forward to such a visit, and so was very glad when Dumbledore told him that he couldn’t go. Percy, who had just come downstairs, volunteered immediately and dissapparated just as fast. A moment later, Fred and George came down together, yawning and stretching in unison.</p>
<p>“’Lo,” they said, shuffling off to the kitchen in search of caffeine. By the time they got back, Percy had reapparated. From the sudden silence, Harry could tell that something was amiss.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?” he asked. He heard footsteps approach him and then something was put in his hand. Closing his fingers around it, Harry could feel an odd, feathery grit, with larger chunks interspersed with it. The lumps were varied; one splintery, one like a rock, and several that crumbled dryly. Try as he might, at last he had to ask “What is it?”</p>
<p>“Your things,” answered Percy softly. “That bastard of a muggle burnt them.” He sounded bitterly upset.</p>
<p>Harry’s throat felt tight. He was determined not to cry, but the pressure behind his useless eyes tested that resolve. “All of them?” His voice broke. “My Firebolt?” He dropped his handful of ash.</p>
<p>Percy knelt at his side and placed another object in his palm. Harry’s fingers recognized the smooth brass band that had once encircled the brush of his treasured broomstick, dusty now with soot and pitted with heat. He could still feel where he had engraved his name into it.</p>
<p>“Did he leave <em>anything</em>?” he asked desperately, tucking the ring into his robes. “Anything at all?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Percy, brightening. “I found your photo album wrapped up in your invisibility cloak and tucked under your mattress. Good job hiding them.”</p>
<p>Harry nodded sadly. “They’re my only remnants of my parents. I’m glad I didn’t lose them, too. Can I have them?” He held out his hand.</p>
<p>“Here.” Harry felt the familiar watery silk and leather cover. Opening the album, he ran his fingers lightly over the glossy pictures, remembering the images that he could not see. Seized by a sudden impulse, he threw the cloak over his head.</p>
<p>His face hidden from the world, he had meant to cry, but instead he laughed, manic hilarity like before. Dumbledore exchanged a worried glance with Black and the Weasleys before looking back to Harry. The cloak had only covered the boy’s head, so an apparently decapitated body shook with gales of bitter, self-derisive mirth. This time, Sirius reacted. He pulled the cloak off Harry’s face and gripped his chin firmly. “Harry,” Sirius said gently. “Harry. We’re all here for you, even if none of us can know what you’re going through.”</p>
<p>“I think I’m going crazy,” said Harry, so quietly that only Sirius and Dumbledore picked it up. He turned his face away from Black’s hand. “Yesterday was wonderful, one of the best days I’ve ever had. Today, I’ve got a new family, my best friend is going to be my brother, but I don’t know haw I can do anything now.” He gestured impotently to his eyes. “Dumbledore, can I even <em>do </em>magic, be a wizard at all, like <em>this</em>?”</p>
<p>Dumbledore replied warmly. “Of course you can, Harry. It will be harder to learn the wand movement, and you will have to relearn a great deal to do it left-handed, but it is by no means impossible. You will not be the first blind wizard. With some extra work this summer, you’ll be able to join your classmates in September.”</p>
<p>“That,” said Harry, straightening. “Is a huge <em>relief</em>. I was terrified that being blind...” He shook his head ruefully. “I’ve got to get used to that word. That being blind would mean I couldn’t go to Hogwarts anymore.”</p>
<p>“Lay that worry to rest. There is absolutely no reason for you not to come back.” Everybody crowded close, uttering reassurances until Harry smiled again. They all relaxed, now that he had.</p>

<p>Hi. More fic.</p>
<p>Chapter 17</p>
<p>By the end of the day, it was official. Harry was the legal child of Arthur and Molly Weasley. Percy and the twins had disappeared almost immediately after the morning’s conversation, saying that they were going to prepare for Harry’s grand arrival at the Burrow. At Fudge’s insistence, however, Harry spent one more night in London, being officially checked over by the staff of St. Mungo’s and seeing his aunt and cousin’s trials. They were each sentenced to two years in Dartmoor Prison, a lesser wizarding prison for lesser offences. Harry was satisfied, though his friends were all for stronger sentences.</p>
<p>The next morning dawned early and hot, typical for late July. Harry realized that only three days remained before his fifteenth birthday. He was really looking forward to it. Even though he didn’t know what Ron’s family did to celebrate birthdays, it had to be better than celebrating with the Dursleys.</p>
<p>“Making no noise and pretending I’m not there,” mused Harry, voicing his thoughts and startling Ron, who was drowsing in the seat behind him. Harry had not wanted to take a portkey, as they held unpleasant memories, so he and his new family were in yet another ministry car, bound for the Burrow. Hermione had had to go home, as her parents had made plans that could no longer be postponed, and the Professors and Sirius had left for Hogwarts. Truth told, Harry was a little relieved. Having an entourage that followed him everywhere had begun to be a little irritating. He sat in the front seat, Ron and Ginny sharing the back with their parents. No one was talking, but it was an amiable silence.</p>
<p>Harry was fingering his new wand. Mr. Ollivander had custom-made it, just for him. Dumbledore had provided another of Fawkes’ feathers for the core, but the rest of it was different. It was longer than his old one, thirteen and one-half inches. The same length as Voldemort's, in fact, but cedar not yew. Already, Harry could tell that his other senses were improving. With his fingertips, he could discern the straight grain of the wood in his wand, could even smell it, a faint scent that reminded him, of all things, of his trunk.</p>
<p>“We’re here, Harry,” said Mrs. Weasley. Harry had been so wrapped in contemplation that he hadn’t noticed the car’s stopping. Mr. Weasley lifted him out of his seat as Ron brought his chair around from the trunk, and set him into it. Harry let Ron push him across the yard and up to the porch. Fred came out to greet them.</p>
<p>“You’re late,” he said, reminding Harry so forcefully of a movie he had seen in Hogsmead the fall before that he couldn’t help responding.</p>
<p>“A wizard is never late, Fredo Baggins, nor is he early. He arrives precisely when he means to,” he said affection the voice of an aged man and adopting a very serious face. Silence reigned for a moment before Ron, Finny, and Fred cracked up. They had all seen the same movie with him. Everyone at Hogwarts had. Their parents just looked at each other in puzzlement. When Harry could speak again, gasping for breath, he tried to explain.</p>
<p>“Haven’t you read <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>?” he asked.</p>
<p>“No,” said Mrs. Weasley tentatively. “I haven’t.”</p>
<p>“You really should. They’re amazing books. they’ve got everything; wizards, elves, er, proper elves, not house-elves, dragons dwarves... They’ve got to be my favorite books. Anyway, the muggles made a really great movie, you know what a movie is? Good. A great movie out of the first of them, and the second one will come out just before Christmas, right after that other big movie. I can’t remember its name, though, but it was very familiar, like I’d heard it before..” His babble trailed off.</p>
<p>“C’mon, Harry.” It was George’s voice, calling from somewhere high above. “Come check out your new room!”</p>
<p>“I get my own room?” Harry had expected to share Ron’s room like he had before. From the sounds Ron was making, so had he. “Where is it?”</p>
<p>“C’mon. We’ll show you.” Fred grabbed the handles of his wheelchair to propel him through the door. “You’re all the way at the top.”</p>
<p>“Wait. <em>My </em>room’s at the top,” protested Ron.</p>
<p>“Higher.”</p>
<p>“Wait,” said Mr. Weasley. “You put Harry in the <em>attic</em>?” He sounded incredulous.</p>
<p>“No, of course not, Dad,” said George, joining them in the kitchen. “We were just kidding. We redid Percy’s room, is all.”</p>
<p>“And we moved it,” added Fred. “up right next to Ron’s room so he can be near help if he needs it. That chair handles stairs alright, right Harry?”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” agreed Harry distractedly. His own room. A real room, with only his own stuff in it. the idea was novel.</p>
<p>Harry leaned back and shouted to his chair. “My room!” The chair leapt away from Fred’s fingers, racing up the lights in its spidery legs only to stop suddenly. Harry put out his hand, found a door knob and stop, unsure of what he was waiting for. The he swung the door open wide and rolled in.</p>
<p>Around him he could feel a very friendly space, one that felt very much like <em>home</em>. Ron arrived after a moment, gasping from trying to keep up and followed by the rest of his family.</p>
<p>“What” gasp “do you” wheeze “think, Harry?” he asked, looking around for himself.</p>
<p>“I like it,” Harry announced. “Now, who can tell me what it looks like?”</p>
<p>Fred and George were eager to describe the minute attention they had paid to detail. From the plaque on the door declaring this to be “Harry’s Secret Lair. (Beware giant monster)” to the view outside the bay windows, to the perch for Hedwig, the vied to be the first to describe it to him. “And we saved the best for last, Harry,” crowed George. “Just tap the wall with your wand.”</p>
<p>Harry did, and instantly, the room was filled with soft hummings. “What is that?” he asked, puzzled.</p>
<p>“Allow me to demonstrate.” George cleared his throat importantly. “Bed.” Immediately, one of the murmurings grew infinitesimally louder, separating from the rest. Harry heard a voice that sounded all but asleep.</p>
<p>“Come to bed come to bed come to...” It faded back into the rest. Listening hard, Harry found that he could still pick it out. He followed its sound, hand out, and soon encountered a fluffy quilt spread over a soft, overstuffed mattress. Tilting his head, he oriented on another of the voices, following this one to a roll top desk. Guided by the sounds, he explored his new room, finding a massive wardrobe, a side table, and a nearly-empty bookcase. The window, when he put his hand against it, told him in a pleasantly female voice that there was a gnome riding a chicken below in the garden. He laughed and turned back to his new family.</p>
<p>“This is... incredible,” he said, searching for words. “Thank you all so much. I don’t know what I can ever do to repay you.”</p>
<p>“you don’t have to repay us, Harry. This is what families do, and we’re so glad to have you in ours.” Mrs. Weasley hugged Harry gently, and he could feel her shaking as she tried not to cry. Awkwardly, with an arm and a half, he hugged her back.</p>
<p>“So, do I call you Mum, now, or what?” asked Harry lightly.</p>
<p>“If you want to,” she answered tearfully, “or if you aren’t going to be comfortable with that, you can call me Molly.”</p>
<p>“And call me Arthur,” joined Mr. Weasley.</p>
<p>“And me, Fred,” followed George. Fred cuffed him and they laughed.</p>
<p>“Come on now, you,” said Mrs. Weasley. “It’s too late for breakfast, so we’ll have an early lunch. It’s so hot, what say we eat in the garden.”</p>
<p>“Sounds great to me,” said a new voice. Everyone spun to face the newcomer. Newcomers.</p>
<p>“Bill! Charlie!” Their dad sounded delighted. “What are you doing here?”</p>
<p>“Well, that’s nice,” said Charlie cheerfully. “We used to live her too, you know. Anyway, Perc’ said that we had a new member of the family. And here I thought you were to old for that, Mum.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Weasley blushed and batted her eldest’s shoulder. “I am too old, you. What he meant was, we adopted Harry.” The Weasley’s drew back so that Charlie and Bill could see Harry.</p>
<p>“Hello,” he said simply, waving towards them.</p>
<p>“Harry’s here?” asked Charlie, shocked. “I thought he was missing.”</p>
<p>“you should have read yesterday’s paper, then,” countered Bill. He looked at Harry. “Seems you had some trouble with that muggle family of yours. Your uncle’s in Azkaban?”</p>
<p>Harry’s face went carefully blank. “I have no uncle,” he said.</p>
<p>“Yeah, you do, Harry,” said Ron, drawing all eyes to him. “And aunts too. Mums got four sisters and a brother, and Dad’s the eighth of ten boys. You’ve just joined a <em>huge </em>family, with grandparents and great-grandparents and everything. Most of ‘em live in the states, though.” He lowered his voice to a stage whisper. “You’d never guess it, but Dad’s a yank!”</p>
<p>“I am not!” said Mr. Weasley, swelling with mock-indignation. “I was born right here on British soil, and I dare you to say otherwise.” He stamped his foot light-heartedly.</p>
<p>“Maybe, but Granny and Grampa Weasley were Yanks, so that makes you one too.”</p>
<p>“If you say so,” said Mr. Weasley, suddenly mild. A crafty gleam came into his eyes. “But hat makes you half Yank, doesn’t it?”</p>
<p>“If it does,” said Fred and George in unison, “<em>He’s </em>the Yank half!” They each pointed at the other.</p>
<p>Harry, listening to the exchange, was ecstatic. This was exactly how he felt a family should be, close and laughing. He laughed too as the whole family went downstairs, joining them in the garden even though he wouldn't be able to eat at the impromptu picnic. The whole group was joyously raucous, even when an errant gnome stole an apple pie. They just laughed harder.</p>
<p>That night, as Ron helped him prepare for bed, Harry was still chuckling from a joke Percy had told at dinner. Ron, however, had fallen silent.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?” asked Harry.</p>
<p>“Where did you get this scar?” asked Ron frankly.</p>
<p>“Which one?” replied Harry frankly.</p>
<p>“This one, around your left ankle. It looks older than the rest.”</p>
<p>Harry smiled. “Oh. That one. When we were four or five, Dudley got a puppy for Christmas from his Aunt Marge, that woman I blew up before Third Year. It was an evil little dog, and Dudley named him Shredder, after a villain from a muggle TV show. Anyway, one day, I was walking the little beast one day and it just clamped onto my ankle, and wouldn’t let go for three blocks. I had to get eight stitches, but it wasn’t the Dursley's fault, if that’s what you’re thinking. They never hurt me before this summer. Dogs just don’t like me, and I don’t like them. Except for Snuffles, of course.”</p>
<p>Ron snorted. “That name is going to haunt him, isn’t it?” He pulled the night-shirt over Harry’s head, one of the things that Harry couldn’t do one-handed, and lifted him onto the bed. “Ugh. Good thing you’re so light, or I wouldn’t do this. You could just sleep in your chair,” he joked. “How much <em>do </em>you weigh?”</p>
<p>“Let’s see. Madame Pomfrey weighed me at Hogwarts. It was.. er... six stone even.”</p>
<p>“Wow,” said Ron in an indrawn breath. “I weigh nine stone four, and I’m not <em>that </em>much bigger than you, am I?”</p>
<p>“I’ll probably gain weight on this IV.” Harry was pulling his needle out of its smooth, little case. Released, it quivered in midair for a moment before plunging itself deep into a vein in Harry’s half-arm. He flinched, because it was very tender. “I didn’t get to eat much at the Dursley’s.” He pulled the large glass vial of nutria-potion from its compartment in the wheelchair standing next to the bed, and screwed it onto the stalk of the needle. “That feels good,” he said, relaxing.</p>
<p>“What does it feel like?” asked Ron curiously as he pulled the quilt up under Harry’s arms.</p>
<p>“Like my invisibility cloak, you know, cool and silvery, but under my skin.”</p>
<p>“At least, if you have to do it, it’s not half-bad.”</p>
<p>“Yeah.” The vial was now empty, so Harry returned it and the gleaming needle to their proper places. “Good night, Ron.”</p>
<p>“Good night, Harry.” By the time Ron shut the door behind him, Harry Potter Weasley was asleep.</p>
<p><br/><br/>##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### #####<br/><br/>Chapter: 18<br/><br/></p>
<p>$ Hi. It’s me again. Just for those who don’t know what a stone is, it’s a unit of weight equivalent to 14 pounds, so six stone even is 84 pounds, while nine stone four is actually 130 pounds. So as you can see, Harry is ridiculously light for a fifteen year-old boy.$</p>
<p>Chapter 18</p>
<p>By the time Ron shut the door behind him, Harry had fallen asleep, once again exhausted by a hectic day. Ron went quietly down the stairs. “Mum?” he called softly upon gaining the parlor. “Mum, he’s asleep.”</p>
<p>“Oh good,” said Mrs. Weasley, putting down her knitting. From where she sat by the hearth, she threw a pinch of blue glitter into the fire. “Matilda Weasley!” she cried as quietly as she could. The flames turned a brilliant shade of indigo with a whoosh, and a head appeared amidst the coals. The older Mrs. Weasley most certainly did not look old enough to have grown grandchildren. Despite her son and grandchildrens’ red hair, she was a blond. An extraordinarily brilliant blond that, despite all odds, <em>was </em>in fact natural.</p>
<p>“Why, hello, Molly. What brings me to your neck of the world?”</p>
<p>“You’ve been reading the papers the last few days, haven’t you?”</p>
<p>“You mean the stuff about the Boy-Who-Lived and his uncle?” said the very perceptive Matilda. Molly nodded.</p>
<p>“Exactly. We told you he was a friend of Ron’s at Hogwarts, didn’t we? Anyway... We adopted him,” she finished in a rush, hoping for the approval of her mother-in-law. She got it in spades.</p>
<p>“Really?” gushed Matilda. “Oh Molly, that’s wonderful. That poor boy really needs a family to love him. How could anyone have done such things to a child?”</p>
<p>“Harry’s uncle was insane, and Harry never wants to hear his name again,” said Molly warningly.</p>
<p>“Gotcha in one, Molly. I can’t blame him at all,” replied Matilda.</p>
<p>“What I called you for was... The day after tomorrow is Harry’s fifteenth birthday. He’s never had any family worth speaking to, so I want to give him one as a present. Can we come out to your place for a party with the whole Weasley Clan? I know it’s something of an imposition, as well as extraordinarily last minute, but he’s never had a birthday party.”</p>
<p>“Not a problem, Molly. Not a problem at all. As a matter of fact, William and Jerome and their respective broods are already here, for the Tall Ships Festival, and Eric is coming tomorrow. It’d be great to have all of you, too. We have plenty of room, and you’ve never visited us.”</p>
<p>“Wonderful. If it’s all right with you and Uther, we’ll stay the whole week, from Monday ‘til Saturday.”</p>
<p>“That’s fine, dear. Would you like me to round up the rest of the gang?”</p>
<p>“Would you?” Molly Weasley beamed in relief. “That would be a heap of help. I still have to talk <em>my </em>clan into this. But I should have asked you first; Can you hold my side, too?”</p>
<p>“No worries, Molly. Well, if I’m going to get this set up in time, I had better go. Ooh, this’ll be so much fun!” Matilda Weasley squealed as her head faded from the fire.</p>
<p>“Claire Fraser!” Molly called out next, throwing another pinch into the fire. A new head materialized in the coals, with hair as red as the flames themselves.</p>
<p>“Mol’?” asked the new face inquiringly. “Is somat’ wrong?”</p>
<p>“No, no, Mum. Listen. You read today’s paper, right?”</p>
<p>“No....,” said Mrs. Weasley’s mom, drawing the word out into a question.</p>
<p>“Have you heard the news about Harry Potter?” asked Molly impatiently.</p>
<p>“Who hasn’t?”</p>
<p>“Alright then. Here’s the thing. Arthur and I adopted Harry. He’s been a friend of Ron’s since First Year, saved Ginny’s life in Second, and now he needs a real family, so we gave him one.”</p>
<p>“What a wonderful thing to do,” crooned Mrs. Fraser.</p>
<p>“That’s what we thought, Mum. The other thing is that the day after tomorrow is Harry’s birthday. He’ll be fifteen, and we’re all going to the States to introduce him to Arthur’s family. I want mine to be there too.”</p>
<p>“Of course we’ll come, Mol’. Malachy’s Harry’s and Ron’s age, i’n’t he?”</p>
<p>“He is. They’ll probably like each other right off.”</p>
<p>“T’is a great idea, Mol’. I don’ believe we’ve ever had both your families together. It’ll be a right proper hoard, it will.”</p>
<p>“It will, won’t it?” said Mrs. Weasley, eyes shining excitedly. “74 of us in all, plus Harry, and Ron’ll probably want to bring his friend Hermione. I think he fancies her,” she whispered just loud enough for Ron to hear. He rolled his eyes and she laughed. “So a total of 76. Wow. Do you think you can get everyone, Mum?”</p>
<p>“Of course, <em>mo chride</em>, but maybe you could ask Rebecca yourself? Her Dougal doesn’t like me much.”</p>
<p>“That’s no surprise,” said Mrs. Weasley wryly. “You don’t like him much.”</p>
<p>“Hmm. I don’t, do I? Ah, it canna be helped. Well, I’ve got to go, but I’ll get everyone to your place late tomorrow eve, come high water or Hell.</p>
<p>“Oh no,” cautioned Mrs. Weasley. “Make it the morning after. This is going to be a surprise party!”</p>
<p>“Are you sure, Mol’? If he’s in as bad a way as they say, can he take a shock like 74 people yelling ‘Surprise!’?”</p>
<p>“He’ll be fine,” replied Mrs. Weasley. “There’s nothing wrong with his heart or his nerves. He’s still the bravest person I know.” She sounded proud.</p>
<p>By the way, Mol’, what <em>did </em>that muggle do to him? All I get here are rumours and tell-tales.” There was a concerned note to Mrs. Fraser’s voice, and Molly deflated a bit.</p>
<p>“He tried his damndest to kill the boy, Mum. Harry’s blind now, and his spine was broken so he can’t even sit up and he lost his arm and a foot and he has to eat through a needle...” A note of hysteria entered her voice, but she forced it down. “Sorry, Mum. It’s just, I had such great parents that I can’t even imagine anybody treating a child like that. It’s not just this latest, either. We had him here three summers ago, when Ron and the twins found him being held prisoner in his own room, barred window and all! And he’s so small! Ron’s four months younger, but he’s got at least six inches on Harry and probably a stone and a half.”</p>
<p>“More than three, actually,” piped up Ron from the couch. “He weighs six even, and I’m nine stone four. He says he’s gaining, though.”</p>
<p>“Six stone?” said Mrs. Fraser, shocked. “You’d better feed him up, Mol’.”</p>
<p>“That’s just it, Mum,” wailed Mrs. Weasley. “I <em>can’t</em>! He can’t eat food, just nutria-potion through a needle into his arm. I can’t even make the potion, he has to get it from Hogwarts.”</p>
<p>“He looks really skinny, Mum,” said Ron. “I can count his ribs and his hips jut out, but he says he’s OK.”</p>
<p>“Then we’ll let it be, unless he gets worse,” his mom decided firmly, wiping her eyes. “So, Mum. Maybe you should get started?”</p>
<p>“Righto, dearest,” said Mrs. Fraser, and her head winked out.</p>
<p>“It’s almost midnight, Mum,” said Ron as he stood and stretched.</p>
<p>“You go to bed then,” she said, waving him absently towards the stairs and reaching for another pinch of blue dust. Her conversation with Rebecca Mackenzie was much the same as the first two, securing an eager promise to come. Dougal, her brother-in-law, came in about halfway through the conversation, happy to see her. His dual was with his mother-in-law, not her daughters. He too was excited about the idea of throwing a party for the Boy-Who-Lived.</p>
<p>$ Well? So now Harry has a family. Hope he likes them. $</p>
<p>Now, my first wholesale reviewer responses;</p>
<p>maria-</p>
<p>You’re right, not many fics actually have Harry getting adopted by the Weasleys. But after all I’ve done to him, I figured he needed a BIG break.</p>
<p>Gara-</p>
<p>Oh, believe me, I can write a more depressing fic if I wanted to, and I do! As soon as I’m done with this one, I’ll write a total tear-jerker. Just you wait and see.</p>
<p>scholcomp1-</p>
<p>Of course I’ll keep going, of course this isn’t the end of it, and you need to learn how to write a useful review.</p>

<p>Ah, yes. My favorite reviewer, and my most faithful. (And not a bad author yourself, I might add) Thank you for the eleven, count ‘em eleven supportive reviews. And I’ll repeat, just for you, that a stone equals 14 pounds.</p>
<p>Poetheiress-</p>
<p>I like it when good authors read/review my stuff. Makes me feel good. Incidentally, we’re nowhere near the end. This is the fic that never ends... Well, it will, but that’s quite a ways down the road. I’ve still got over a hundred pages on paper that I have to type and post.</p>
<p>Laterose-</p>
<p>My other most faithful critic, with five reviews for me to your name. I do hope your heart started again, you optimist you. And yes, I am evil. School starts in September. It’s still July, remember? And he’s laughing because he’s afraid to cry. I should know how that feels. Yuck.</p>
<p>Angryry-</p>
<p>And so he shall!</p>

<p>Sorry, I didn’t Kiss Vernon, but I did on . Go there and see Harry’s vengeance wreaked!</p>
<p>BuzzBuzz16-</p>
<p>You’re right. Vernon <em>is </em>scum.</p>
<p>Deerose91-</p>
<p>It would spoil the story if I told you whether Harry would get better or not, but remember if you will my disclaimer. (In Chapter 1)</p>
<p>Bill Weasley-</p>
<p>Harry doesn’t make speeches.</p>
<p>Relle</p>
<p>- Of course he’ll, but Harry will forget him, and so will we. Incidentally, you’re one of my favorite authors. Hey everybody! Go read Relle’s stuff! It’s really a bullet in the chest!</p>
<p>Kyohaku Celestiale Vespertina-</p>
<p>Thanks for your compliments of my court scene. I stole it from Perry Mason, except for the Veritaserum stuff, obviously. Didn't you like my intermission? I typed the Oo-de-lally song from memory. I know I need a life.</p>
<p>Snapdragon-</p>
<p>Oh my God, thank you for your enthusiastic review. Of course the Kiss would be too nice for Vernon, most things would.</p>
<p>Lady Foxfire-</p>
<p>Thank you for recommending me to Relle, I owe you. Of course P and D get tried too, and found guilty, and yes, this is going to get even nastier. And Myrtle very nearly does give P a cardiac arrest.</p>
<p>HPLover234-</p>
<p>There’s always hope, isn’t there?</p>
<p>Lynlyn</p>
<p>- Thank you for the in-depth review, i don’t see to many of those. Of course Harry is going to get his money back, but it won’t be a big deal in the story. Incidentally, the blindfold thing actually came from the <em>Fourth Quarter </em>books by Tanya Huff.</p>
<p>Amy</p>
<p>- Actually, I <em>can </em>be as cold-hearted as that. It’s an art.</p>
<p>Jordon-</p>
<p>Because he does.</p>
<p>Figgy the Witch-</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>liena-</p>
<p>Of course Harry won’t die, and the Dursleys will get their due. Pull yourself together, girl.</p>

<p>I may be an evil bastard, but I’m not a cliched evil bastard.</p>
<p>Mystic Queen-</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>Jordan-</p>
<p>Nobodies died, and Vernon <em>has </em>gotten it. Happy now?</p>
<p>Kim-</p>
<p>I know I’m evil, but stop throwing things at me and hitting me with things!</p>
<p>Anzie-</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>______-</p>
<p>Hey nameless! Thanks for the review, but I already know that I am evil and insane. Isn’t everybody?</p>
<p>Anne-Julie-</p>
<p>I said sorry already!</p>
<p>Bill Weasley (ruddy again)-</p>
<p>Sorry! As for what you have all done wrong is that I don’t have enough reviews! I eat reviews, and I can't post when I’m hungry.</p>
<p>PissedOffEskimo-</p>
<p>I know it’s good. I wrote it.</p>
<p>Moonlight-</p>
<p>I have nothing to say to you, since I already have dedicated a whole chapter to you and you’ve only given me one review.</p>
<p>Well, that’s everybody, so just keep on posting reviewing and I’ll keep right on posting.</p>

<p>$ Well, was that just an overwhelming acknowledgment list or what? And I’ll eventually have to do another one, ugh! Ah well, on with the fic! Also, did ANYONE get the ’Fredo Baggins’ joke? I thought I was being incredibly clever, and I had my family <em>in stitches! Why did no one notice? </em>Boo Hoo!$</p>
<p>Chapter 19</p>
<p>On the morning of his birthday, Harry woke up in silence. He could hear Ron shifting about in his room across the landing, but from downstairs there was nothing. “What time is it?” he called aloud. The clock answered.</p>
<p>“It’s seven in the morning. Oops, seven o’ one.”</p>
<p>Apparently, Ron had heard him, for Harry heard a tapping at the door. “Come in,” he called, and Ron stuck his head in the door.</p>
<p>“Happy Birthday, Harry! Are you ready to get up?”</p>
<p>“I guess so,” Harry replied noncommittally. “Where is everybody?”</p>
<p>Ron sounded cheerful as he started to get Harry dressed. “They’re here, downstairs. Birthdays are a big deal with us. When I turned fourteen, Fred and George threw a fireworks show. That was an incredible day, and today’ll be even better, I bet.”</p>
<p>“My very first birthday party,” mused Harry. “Hey, watch the ears! I need those,” he joked as Ron pulled a shirt over his head.</p>
<p>“Sorry.”</p>
<p>When Harry was dressed and safely ensconced in his wheelchair, they went downstairs. Ron’s steps behind him sounded particularly loud to Harry.</p>
<p>“Harry, Ron, is that you?” called Ron’s mom from the kitchen. “Happy Birthday, Harry.”</p>
<p>“Thanks, Mrs.... er, Molly.”</p>
<p>“Come on, Harry, we’re all in here.”</p>
<p>Entering the kitchen, Harry heard odd noises surrounding him, half-whispers and sounds of cloth rubbing against cloth. Who’s there?” His hand found his wand in its pocket, unnerved by the impression of being at the center of a silent multitude.</p>
<p>“It’s alright,” said Ron, sounding as though he were trying very hard not to laugh. “Just hold this.” He put something small and smooth into Harry’s hand.</p>
<p>Before Harry could question this, he felt a horribly familiar jerk. It was the sensation that had haunted the moments between sleep and not-sleep ever since the third task. A Portkey. Terror overtook him, sending him screaming into the maelstrom. To him, the transit lasted an eternity. By the time it ended, he was gasping for breath, no longer even able to shout.</p>
<p>“Harry! Harry!” Mr. Weasley’s voice took a moment to cut through Harry’s fear. On his knees in front of the trembling boy, he shook him gently. “Harry! You’re safe! We’re here, with you!” His voice was low and fervent and it worked. Harry visibly calmed, questing around the unfamiliar surroundings.</p>
<p>“Where are we?” His voice was still a little shaky, and he was uncomfortably aware that he had just made a fool of himself.</p>
<p>“We’re... well, I can’t tell you just yet, but I promise you, you are absolutely safe.”</p>
<p>His panic gone, Harry realized that this must have something to do with his birthday. Yesterday, the Weasleys had been conspicuously silent on the subject. It would have reminded him of the Dursleys, save for the whispered conversations that halted every time he entered a room. He grinned. “Alright. So, what now?”</p>
<p>“Just a sec,” said Mr. Weasley. He ducked out of the room for a moment, returning almost immediately. “All set. Here, Harry. Let me take you out there.” He then pushed Harry out the door.</p>
<p>“Surprise!” A great shout enveloped him, and he would have jumped if he could. “Happy Birthday!”</p>
<p>“Wow,” was all Harry could say. “Ron, he whispered out of the corner of his mouth, trusting that his friend was there. “Who are all these people?”</p>
<p>Ron sounded smug. “Your new family, all seventy four of us. Oh, and Hermione.” Hermione punched him affectionate.</p>
<p>“74.” Harry was at a loss for words. “Wow. That’s a lot.”</p>
<p>“Too right. And you have to meet them all. Each and every one.”</p>
<p>And so he did. Mr. Weasley, that is, Arthur Weasley, had nine brothers. Harry met William. Arthur’s oldest brother first, greeting also his wife, Marie, and their two grown children, Jonathon and Ewan, as well as Ewan’s wife, Marilyn, with their young daughter, Lieh.</p>
<p>“We live in Hawaii,” said Ewan, by way of introduction. “About as far away from England as you can get.”</p>
<p>Next was the next eldest son, Jared. He too was married, to a woman from Canada named Tracy and their two children, polite teenagers, were Isabelle (Just call me Bell) and Cedric. Harry winced at the boy’s name, but no one noticed.</p>
<p>The third son, Charles, was not married, but the fourth, Jerome, was wed to Angela and the proud father of two sets of twins; Robert and Dvorak (Just ‘D,’ <em>please</em>.) and Amie and Theresa.</p>
<p>Number five was Ian, who had Sheila and Blake, an eight year-old boy, and six was Sean, who had married Sarah and shown a slightly twisted sense of humour in naming his quadruplets; Simon, Stanton, Stephen, and a girl, Sequoia.</p>
<p>Luke was unmarried, the last one older than Arthur. The second youngest son, Eric, was there, with his wife Christine and their month-old son, a squalling little tyke named Raoul. Jason, the youngest who was only newly-wed, shyly introduced his wife of seven weeks and two days, Marissa.</p>
<p>“That’s thirty-two,” said Harry, who was patently enjoying this parade of introductions and pleasantries. Everyone here seemed to like him! “Who’s next?”</p>
<p>“My parent’s,” responded Mr. Weasley, approaching with said parents in tow. “Harry, this is Uther and Matilda Weasley. Mum, Dad, this is Harry.”</p>
<p>Apparently,” rumbled a deep voice to Harry’s left. A rough hand shook his. “Very good to meet you, Harry. I guess you get to call me Granpa now. Not Gramps, mind you.”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir,” said Harry flippantly. Granpa Weasley chuckled.</p>
<p>“I think I like this kid.”</p>
<p>Than I guess I’m Granny, aren’t I?” Matilda Weasley ruffled Harry’s hair. “Makes me feel old.”</p>
<p>“You don’t sound old,” said Harry genuinely. His new grandmother giggled.</p>
<p>“Oh, what a gentleman!”</p>
<p>“Hey, you haven’t introduced me yet!” a new voice called.</p>
<p>“We’d never forget you, Grandpa,” said Arthur. “Harry, this is one of my grandfathers. Grandpa Percival. We named Percy after him. Where’s Grandma Anna, Grandpa?”</p>
<p>“She’s over there,” the old man said, pointing even though Harry couldn’t see. “Gossiping with Renna, Clair and Virginia.”</p>
<p>Introductions took another half an hour. In the end, Harry had a total of eight great-grandparents, four grandparents, fourteen uncles, ten aunts, twenty-nine first cousins, and two second cousins, or were they first cousin’s once removed? It didn’t matter, they were all family. His family. Automatically he liked them all, especially his uncle Malachy, Molly’s kid brother, who was in fact, two years younger than Harry himself.</p>
<p>“Hey, everyone!” yelled Matilda once Harry had met everyone. “I’ve got us all tickets to Tall Ships for tomorrow. Today, though, is for Harry. A big hand for the Birthday Boy!”</p>
<p>“Thanks, I need one,” shouted Harry over the din of applause, sending the hoard into delighted laughter. They were definitely a merrier bunch than the Dursleys.</p>
<p>“So what do you want to do about all these presents, Harry,” asked Malachy, still laughing.</p>
<p>“Presents?” Harry sounded surprised.</p>
<p>“Of course,” said Claire Fraser, sounding surprised at <em>his </em>surprise. “It’s your birthday.”</p>
<p>It was a huge mound of gifts, far more presents than Dudley had ever gotten. Even after four years, opening presents was still novel to Harry. One-handed, it went slowly, but everyone was enjoying themselves too much to complain. The first gift he opened, from Claire and Colum Fraser, Molly’s parents, was a shiny new cauldron.</p>
<p>“Mol’ told us all how you lost all of your school things,” Colum explained tactfully. “So we thought this’d be a good idea. And it’s silver, so it’ll last longer than pewter.”</p>
<p>“Thank you,” said Harry sincerely before moving on to the next brightly-wrapped box. This one held a new wool cloak, with a Gryffindor Lion worked in bronze as the fastener. Hermione had resumed her sel-assigned post as Harry’s narrator, so she described it and all the other gifts to him. From his new parents came a ne trunk, complete with his name inscribed on a little plate in the front. Harry opened it immediately, moving his opened presents into it from his lap.</p>
<p>“Thanks, Molly, Arthur, but you didn’t need to give me anything. A family is the best present I’ve ever gotten.” A fierce hug was their response, knocking the breath from Harry’s lungs. “Well,” he gasped. “If you insist.”</p>
<p>Ginny’s present to him was a bundle of left-handed quills, mostly eagle, but with a big ostrich plume thrown in. That, Harry kept in his lap, running his fingers through its down as he opened more of his presents. Hermione, of course, got him a book. <em>Hogwarts, a History</em>, and charmed to read itself aloud.</p>
<p>“Thanks, ‘Mione,” said Harry wryly, “but now what will we need <em>you </em>for?”</p>
<p>Fred and George gave him a whole sack of pranks. Harry put those aside quickly without explaining, hoping he would have a chance to pull a few of them in the very near future. Ron’s gift was a real Golden Snitch. “It’s autographed by Victor Krum,” he explained.</p>
<p>Through Percy came a gift from the Ministry itself. “This,” he explained importantly. “Is a medal of commendation for extraordinary courage in the face of great danger.” He pinned an ornament to Harry’s left shoulder. “And this,” he said, pinning another, “is a citation for a honourable wound, received in the defense of the citizens of Great Briton and the World.”</p>
<p>Harry was floored. “These?” he asked confusedly, raising his stump and gesturing to his eyes.</p>
<p>“No,” said Percy soberly. “This,” he tapped the scar on Harry’s forehead, “and this.” He would have tapped the inside of Harry’s right elbow, but he had to falter. Harry had no right elbow. “The place where Peter Pettigrew cut you to take your blood to bring back He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. The Ministry sends its profoundest apologies for not believing you at the time.” Percy shook Harry’s hand warmly before stepping back.</p>
<p>That had dampened the mood, but now it returned to full swing as Harry continued to open presents. By the time he had opened them all, the crowd was as jocularly raucous as ever. He was euphoric with joy.</p>
<p>At this point, lunch was ready. Harry, although he couldn’t join in the meal, was put at the head of the table. His mouth watered at the smell of all the foods that he couldn’t have, until Molly’s mother spoke.</p>
<p>“Who wants Haggis?” Harry’s appetite died immediately.</p>
<p>After lunch, the adults stayed in the kitchen to talk, but all of the children swarmed out into the large back garden to play. Harry was it first in a spirited game of Blind Man’s Bluff. Yesterday, he had discovered that by planting his base of his wand against the arm of his chair he could use it as a kind of joystick. With that improvement in his mobility, this was a game that he was ideally suited for, requiring only one alteration to the rule. Whoever was ‘it’ had to constantly make some sort of sound so that Harry could track their movements as well as the sighted kids.</p>
<p>They were having so much fun that only when it began to get dark did the game end. Harry protested. “I can play just fine in the dark, why can’t you?” His tone was light, if regretful.</p>
<p>“Come on, Harry,” said Malachy. “It’s just about time for dinner, anyway. We’re all going out.”</p>
<p>“Really, Uncle Malachy? Where?”</p>
<p>“Don’t call me that,” he said without asperity. “It’s a restaurant called the Space Needle. Odd name, isn’t it? But Grandpa Weasley says the food is really good.”</p>
<p>“The Space Needle? As in Seattle, U.S. of A?” Harry was once again floored.</p>
<p>“Yeah. Didn’t you know where you’ve been all day? This is Granny Weasley’s place in the States. She lives on an island called Lopez in Washington State. It’s like Hogsmead back home, almost everyone here is magical.</p>
<p>“I’ve never heard of it, but then I’ve never been to the States before,”</p>
<p>“I haven’t been here since I was very little, when I came with Mol’, but it’s just like I remembered it. Did Hermione describe the house to you?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, she did, earlier. During the introductions. It sounds incredible.”</p>
<p>“It is,” said Ron as he came up to them. He sounded sentimental.</p>
<p>“Are you boyos coming or not?” called Aunt Bonnie, Molly’s youngest sister, from the back door.</p>
<p>“Coming, Aunt Bonnie,” called back Ron. “Come on, Harry. We’re going to Floo to Uncle Luke’s flat in Seattle. He says we can walk to the Space Needle from there.”</p>
<p>It took a long time for 77 people to disappear through the capacious fireplace. Harry couldn’t help but remember his first experience with Floo, and cringed and chuckled to himself simultaneously. He didn’t repeat the incident, for which he was grateful. Uncle Luke’s small apartment was absolutely packed when he arrived, but they all headed out immediately, a great hoard moving leisurely along the sidewalks of Metropolitan Seattle. Suddenly, Hermione gripped Harry’s arm.</p>
<p>“Oh, Harry, it’s beautiful!” she cried softly.</p>
<p>“What?” he asked.</p>
<p>“The Space Needle. It’s, oh, how can I describe it? Have you seen the Eiffel Tower, in Paris?”</p>
<p>“No,” said Harry patiently.</p>
<p>“Oh, well, this is like a saucer on top of a big, conical pedestal... Oh, here!” Seizing his hand, she traced the swooping lines of the landmark into his palm. You see?” she asked anxiously.</p>
<p>“I see,” said Harry. “What else can you tell me?”</p>
<p>“Well, it’s all lit up, with blue and white neon. It looks like some... Oh, there’s nothing I can compare it to. It’s... unique,” was all she could come up with.</p>
<p>“Sounds beautiful,” said Harry softly.</p>
<p>“It is,” she agreed.</p>
<p>Apparently, the clan had somehow reserved the entire structure, so there was no delay for the legendary elevator or to be seated in the revolving restaurant at the top. The food was incredible, and Harry even got to taste some, although no one would let him swallow any no matter how much he pleaded. Harry, Hermione, Malachy, Ron, and the other kids amused themselves by sticking notes to the windows. Only the floor of the restaurant revolved, along with the tables, while the windows and the central kitchen area remained stationary. Anything put on the windows therefore, passed by all the diners before returning to its originator, a circuit which took about forty five minutes. When Harry got his little slip of parchment back, nearly everyone had added a little comment or sketch to it. Once Ron had read it to him, laughing so hard he could hardly speak, Harry put it carefully away into his chair.</p>
<p>As dessert was wrapping up, an unfamiliar voice spoke up. “Harry Potter? My name is Klaus Dettriche, and I’m the President of the Space Needle Owners’ Association. May I just say that it is an honour to have you here, in our establishment.” Apparently, Mr. Dettriche was a wizard. “If there is anything that we, I can do or provide, you have but to ask.”</p>
<p>Harry replied slowly. “No, there’s nothing that I can think of right now. Wait.” He’d had an appealing thought. “Can we go up top?” During dinner, Hermione had told Harry of something she had seen on television about the Space Needle, and Harry had immediately wanted to get as high as he could on it.</p>
<p>“Anything for the Boy-Who-Lived,” said Mr. Dettriche obsequiously. “If you’ll just give me a moment.”</p>
<p>“You know,” said Harry over Ron’s jibes. “Being the Boy-Who-Lived is beginning to grow on me. I could even get to like being famous.”</p>
<p>Arrangements were made with the speed of light, and Harry, Hermione, Ron, and Malachy were escorted up a service staircase by Dettriche and an engineer named Martin. Above their heads, Harry heard a door open. Directing his chair upwards, he surmounted the Space Needle. He leaned into the stiff wind as best he could, trying to believe that he was on a broomstick, flying high above a Quidditch pitch, for that was why he had wanted to be so high. He missed flying more than anything else he had lost. Being up here wasn’t a substitute, but by the time Dettriche called to him, the craving for altitude had eased.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, Mr. Potter, but the wind is picking up. You and your friends have to come down now.”</p>
<p>Harry, reluctant to leave the roof of the world, lagged behind the other three in returning to the stairs and was the only one still out when a vicious gust swept across the saucer, knocking his chair on its side and sending it sliding. “Help!” Harry screamed, clawing uselessly at the slick surface. His fingers caught and tore at the rivets in the metal, but he couldn’t stop his slide.</p>
<p>“Harry!” shouted Hermione, but it was too late. Harry was three feet from the edge, one foot, and gone.</p>

<p>$ Was I evil with my last chapter? I’m sorry. (Mock sweet tone.) No, really, you’ve got to believe me. I don’t want to give you cliffhangers, but all the people who live in my head... They’re not so nice. (See my bio for a partial list of everyone who lives in my head.) $</p>
<p>$ PS: Sorry that this chapter took so long. I had to write a huge chunk in the middle from scratch or Harry wasn’t going to get to go to the Tall Ships thing, and I really wanted him to go. For those of you who aren’t boat people, a Tall Ship is an old-fashioned one. Think pirates, Columbus, and Captain Cook. The Tall Ships festival is where a whole bunch of tall ships and other noteworthy boats got together and toured the West Coast. I think they do the same thing on the East Coast, too. (Of America) They usually have two or more masts, square sails, that kind of thing. $</p>
<p>Chapter 20</p>
<p>Harry hardly had time to register the fact that he was falling before he hit something, the web of cables that surrounded the Observation Deck below the restaurant. His chair bounced hard, and he was dislodged from it, flying free of the net. He was falling, falling, and then suddenly he wasn’t. He felt the ground beneath him, grass against his cheek, but there had been no impact, no pain of broken bones or bleeding flesh. He was breathless from fear and screaming, but that was all. He was safe, even if he didn’t know where he was. Around him, he could hear people talking, so he called out. “Hello? Could someone give me a hand?” Voices had already risen in concern, and footsteps rushed to his side.</p>
<p>“Are you OK?” a gruff voice asked.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” said Harry. “Could you turn me over? And tell me where I am?”</p>
<p>“Just a sec, while I check if you’ve got any major injuries. Hold still. You’re under the Space Needle, son. Can you move your hands or feet?”</p>
<p>“Hand, yes, but I’m paralyzed below my chest. That’s not new,” he hastened to assure the speaker who was running impersonal hands over his body, checking for broken bones. “I’m not hurt.”</p>
<p>“That was too big a fall for you not to be hurt,” said the voice, sounding very perplexed. “I saw you fall.”</p>
<p>“I’m fine,” Harry repeated. He turned his head towards the voice, smiling to reassure the man, but he heard instead a gasp of surprise.</p>
<p>“Who did this to you?” the man asked, and Harry felt his hands on the knot of the blindfold. He opened his eyes as the cloth fell away.</p>
<p>“The man who did this is in a prison in Britain,” he said truthfully. “Can you please turn me over? This is very uncomfortable, and I’m lying on my stump.”</p>
<p>His anonymous would-be-savior relented, carefully rolling Harry onto his back.</p>
<p>“My name is Harry Potter, by the way,” said Harry, feeling awkward in the odd situation.</p>
<p>“My name is Samuel Clayton,” said the voice. “Dr. Samuel Clayton.”</p>
<p>“A doctor. Hmm. I picked a good place to fall, didn’t I?”</p>
<p>“I suppose so.” He sounded unsure of himself as he continued delicately. “Out of a professional curiousity, Harry, what happened to your eyes? I’ve never seen anything like that before.”</p>
<p>“Fun, aren’t they? A real talking point.” He had to prevaricate quickly, for a muggle such as this Doctor Clayton would not understand things such as an Eaufeu Catalyst. “A man... poured petrol into them and lit it.”</p>
<p>“Oh. God.”</p>
<p>“It’s OK, sir. Hey, could you or someone here go up to the restaurant, and get a Mr. Arthur Weasley? He’s my guardian and will need to know where I...” He didn’t get to finish his sentence.</p>
<p>“<em>Harry</em>!” It was Mrs. Weasley, running from the foot of the Needle. She sounded panicked as she pushed through the crowd that had grown around the boy. “Harry! Oh, Harry, are you OK?” She fell to her knees beside him and he reached for her hand.</p>
<p>“I’m OK, Molly,” he assured her, smiling. “As I was telling this man. Dr. Clayton, this is Molly Weasley, my step-mother.”</p>
<p>“Mrs. Weasley, your stepson just fell over <em>five hundred feet </em>without a scratch,” said the doctor, his voice making it a question.</p>
<p>“Just lucky, I guess,” said Harry. At this point, he just wanted to escape this too-curious muggle so he could tell Molly about what had just happened.</p>
<p>“Even so, Harry, I would like to get you to a hospital to check you over. There could be internal damage or fractures that I can’t see here.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, Doctor,” said Molly. “Obliviate!” Dr. Clayton’s hand fell limply from Harry’s shoulder as his memory was erased. “That should hold him for a few moments. Come on, Harry. You’re sure you’re OK?” She lifted him carefully like a small child and headed back into the shops at the foot of the Needle, where Arthur, Ron, and a large selection of the hoard were piling out of the elevator.</p>
<p>“Harry!” cried out Ron, seeing him. “Mum? Is he OK?”</p>
<p>“I’m fine,” said Harry with some asperity. “I’m not hurt at all.”</p>
<p>“I’m very glad you’re all right, Harry, but I don’t understand that you’re not hurt. We all saw you fall past the windows, way up there.” Mrs. Weasley sounded confused.</p>
<p>“I don’t understand either,” agreed Harry. “I was falling and then, I wasn’t. I didn’t hit the ground, I just wasn’t falling anymore, and I was on the ground.” Suddenly he remembered something else. “I heard an odd sound, like glass breaking.”</p>
<p>Mr. Weasley spoke up. “You must have apparated, Harry. Where did you learn that?”</p>
<p>“I apparated? How? I mean, I’ve never learned it, so how could I do it?” Harry remembered Mr. Weasley telling him once that apparation was very hard. “I didn’t splinch myself, did I? I’m missing enough pieces already.”</p>
<p>“No, you look all there to me, but how? Underage apparating is all but impossible.”</p>
<p>“I know. I mean, you’ve told me, but I don’t know how I did it. I didn’t even think of apparating, and I didn’t have my wand.”</p>
<p>“Who cares how he did it?” burst out Ron. “He’s OK!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I am,” agreed Harry. Suddenly, a wave of exhaustion hit him. He yawned. “But I’m really beat.” Someone had retrieved his chair by now, and, as Mrs. Weasley settled him into it he yawned again.</p>
<p>“I suppose we should go back to your place, then,” said Mrs. Weasley, a trifle regretfully. “Matilda, thank you for today. This means so much to him.” She gestured to Harry, who had already fallen asleep. “It means a lot to all of us.”</p>
<p>“Think nothing of it, Molly. It’s always a pleasure to host a bash like this.”</p>
<p>Harry didn’t even wake up as they took a portkey back to his uncle Luke’s apartment, where he and his immediate family were to spend the night as the rest of the two clans went back to Matilda’s house on Lopez. When they reconvened the next morning, it was already a blindingly hot day. The fair at the waterfront was already in full swing, full of people out to enjoy the spectacle of a score or so of ships sailed straight out of the past, tall ships such as the Lady Washington, which Fred recognized with delight. George did not.</p>
<p>“That’s because <em>you </em>don’t watch <em>Star Trek</em>,” taunted Fred. “That’s the ship from the beginning of <em>Star Trek; Generations</em>, but they called her Enterprise for that, of course.”</p>
<p>So they toured all the boats, swelling the already-long lines with seventy-odd more people. Harry actually got to sail on one of the tall-ships, the Hawaiian Chieftain in one of the mock-battled that it held with its traveling companion, the Lady Washington. He cheered until his throat was raw with the smoke from their cannons and laughed heartily when he heard a story from the ships’ last stop, a small town up north, right by Canada, called Anacortes. They had held mock-battles there, too, and a great mass of local boats ad come out to cheer them on. One of these, a schooner named Rejoice, had actually joined in. Lacking a cannon of their own, the young crew made one of their own by the simple expedient of lining up along the rail and shouting “BOOM!!” at the top of their lungs whenever they were broadside to either of the tall ships or to the shore batteries set up on the piers of the town. The Rejoice, Harry learned, had followed the tall ships here to Seattle, and was moored on display only a few docks down.</p>
<p>Immediately after the battle, Harry made a beeline straight for he Rejoice. He wanted to meet the inventive crew. As this boat wasn’t actually a tall ship, there was no line. They were welcomed aboard by a teen who introduced herself as Beth Huffington, a Sea Scout. The entire boat was crewed, owned, and maintained by Sea Scouts, and had an interesting history of his own, which Beth was more than willing to relate.</p>
<p>“The Rejoice was built in 1923 during the Depression, as a wedding present from a man to his bride. Her name was Joyce, and it was actually the man’s second marriage to the same woman. Hence the name, <em>Re</em>joice.” The pun drew a few guffaws. “The boat went through several owners before she was donated to the Sea Scouts. The owner before us was actually afraid of her, so she hadn’t been sailed for about a decade before we got our hands on her. She’s been sailed plenty since, but she was built for blue water, er, open ocean sailing and we can’t give her that. We’re based in La Connor, and we’ve never taken her farther than southern British Columbia.” Suddenly her voice petered. Harry could hear her fidgeting, and then she spoke again, quietly, as though afraid that those around her might hear. “Are you Harry Potter?”</p>
<p>“You’re a witch?” Harry asked, surprised. Sailing sounded like a lot of fun, but it did seem like more of a muggle pastime.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” she said with confidence. “I’m a student at the Northwest Islands Academy of Magic, up north on Folly Island. It’s just a small school, but it’s great. I’m a sixth year, South Tower.” She took Harry’s hand and shook it excitedly. “It’s an honour to meet you.” In rapid order, she introduced the rest of her shipmates, all of whom attended the Academy. “And this is Rob Shriglet, our Skipper,” she concluded, and Harry’s hand was shaken a final time.</p>
<p>“Would you like to come below, and tour the boat, Mr. Potter?”</p>
<p>“Sure,” said Harry. Since everyone on the boat was magical, he could use his chair’s more useful attributes, such as legs. It barely fit down the narrow companionway, but he made it below. Hermione was kept bust describing everything, and Harry had a lot of questions for Beth. The boat, it turned out, could power along up to eleven knots under the “iron genny,” a pink-painted diesel engine that lurked beneath the galley counter. They had a stove and a sink, but no oven or running water, and the head was a topic to be avoided. (A head on a boat refers to the w.c.) He got to try out a bunk, the smallest, which the crew affectionately and descriptively called “the Coffin.” It was a tighter fit than Harry’s cupboard had been. “Cozy,” he remarked, and people laughed. He learned that, although there were only a total of eight bunks, four in the main cabin, two in Captain’s quarter, and a further two very far forward in the foc’sl, or forecastle, sixteen people would be sleeping on board tonight. Mr. Weasley asked Captain Shriglet why they hadn’t used magic to expand and improve the quality of the living spaces.</p>
<p>“Because the magic-free ship,” replied the captain proudly. “She was built by hand and that’s how we keep her. Sure, it’s a challenge.” He described their annual haul-outs where they sanded and repainted the entire, fifty-six foot long hull, top to bottom, “But it’s a great thing for kids, for anyone to do.” The man was obviously passionate about his favorite pastime. Harry could sympathize, he was the same way about quidditch. He sternly repressed the little voice in his head that mocked him for even thinking about quidditch, and complimented and thanked Rejoices’ crew one last time.</p>
<p>The next day, at Harry’s insistence, they came back. What he wanted this time, though, was not to tour the boats again, but rather to try his hand at the activities on shore set up by the Sea Scouts. Beth had told him about them, and she, in fact, was crewing them today, rather than the boat. They had set up a rope-and-pulley hoist that they called a Bo 'sun's chair, and they were lifting small and not-so-small children aloft with it. Harry, hearing the happy shrieks of children some twenty feet above him, decided he had to try it. The Sea Scouts were extraordinarily conscientious in tying the knots on which he would depend, adding a few to compensate for his disabilities, and then he was up. Here was the feel of flying again, marred only by the abrasive rope that fed through his hand. Too soon, he had to go back down.</p>
<p>The rest of the week was spent on Lopez and the surrounding islands. Lopez had a small village called, appropriately enough, Lopez Village. It held the island’s only petrol-station and grocer, as well as a renowned bakery called Holly-Bee’s and a number of hole-in-the-wall bookstores. Friday Harbour, on nearby San Juan Island, was a bustling metropolis by comparison. Why, it even had a cinema! This being August, there were tourists clogging every venue. Harry prefered Lopez.</p>
<p>On their last day, it was decided that they would take a muggle airplane home, rather than another portkey, for Harry’s sake. At some point in the week, Thursday, Harry thought, a ministry official from England had tracked him down and asked him what he wanted to do with his recovered money. Harry had sent most of it back to Gringott’s, but had kept about five thousand Pounds out as ‘spending money.’ He had treated everyone to ‘frappacinoes,’ an American delicacy, but h still had enough to buy tickets for himself, Hermione, and his family, and he insisted. They took the ferries to Anacortes, which islanders called ‘the mainland’ even though it was an island itself, because there was a bridge that connected it to the continent. From the ferry dock, they took the airport shuttle past Seattle and all the way to the Seattle-Tacoma Airport, SeaTac. Mr. Weasley and Ginny, who looked to follow in her father’s eccentric footsteps, were speechless in wonder at the profusion of muggle ingenuities such as subways, conveyor side-walks, and ‘escabators.’ Hermione, who had flown often in her life, explained everything. Harry, who had never even seen an airport, listened as avidly as his step-father.</p>
<p>His handful of notes proved to be more than enough to seat them all in First Class on Flight 48 to London Heathrow Airport. At one point in the nine-hour flight, a stewardess approached Harry.</p>
<p>“Excuse me, sir. Is your name Harry Potter? The captain would like to meet you.” He followed her in his chair up the aisle to the door to the cockpit, puzzled. The stewardess knocked and he was admitted immediately, Ron and Hermione right behind him. Someone seized his hand, shacking it excitedly.</p>
<p>“A pleasure to meet you, Mr. Potter. I am honoured.” The excited voice of a young man rang out in the small room. “My name is Frank Abagnale. Captain Abagnale.”</p>
<p>“Pleased to meet you, Captain,” said Harry politely. “This is my friend, Hermione Granger, and my brother, Ron Weasley.” Harry was finally getting used to being recognized wherever he went, even starting to like it. “Thank you for inviting us up here.”</p>
<p>“My privilege, sir, my pleasure. If you’ll just come over here, my co-pilot will show you the controls.” He didn’t seem to realize how ludicrous tit was to think of showing a blind person anything, but Harry didn’t mind. The co-pilot, a witch by the name of Dorothy Gallant, was eager to explain the control board to Harry, letting him “see” it with his fingers, so long as he was careful. Ron and Hermione took turns sitting in the captain’s chair, laughing at each other. “Er, can I get a picture of you and me?” asked Captain Abagnale when Harry and his friends were ready to g back to their seats. He produced a camera, and Ron, laughing at the echoes of Colin Creevey, took the picture of him and his co-pilot with Harry sitting between them and the darkening sky as a backdrop.</p>
<p>“Can I have a copy of that?” Harry asked laughingly as the Captain himself escorted them back to their seats.</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>When they go back, Mr. Weasley was watching the in-flight movie in awed silence. Harry chuckled. From the sound of it, it was <em>The Lord of the Rings; the Fellowship of the Ring</em>, and it had just begun. Those who had seen it already waited with baited breath for the line and, when it came, laughed riotously at Mr. Weasley.</p>
<p>“Aye, that <em>is </em>funny!” he gasped, getting the joke at last, and wiping tears of laughter from his eyes. “Fredo Baggins indeed.”</p>
<p>At London Heathrow Airport, after getting Mr. Weasley past the oh-so-fascinating baggage claim, they hailed a trio of muggle taxies to take them to the Burrow. Harry tried to foot the bill again, but his step-mother would hear nothing of it.</p>
<p>“That’s your money, Harry. We can handle things like this from time to time,” was her argument, and he gave in, although he did insist on paying the tips.</p>
<p>Having been up all night on the flight, the entire family was exhausted. On arrival at the Burrow, no one resisted going straight to bed, Ron helping Harry, and Hermione rooming with Ginny, even though it was nearly noon.</p>
<p>“Harry! Ron! Everyone up! Ron, could you hurry and get Harry up? He’s going back to Hogwarts today.” It was the next morning, and Mrs. Weasley was yelling from the landing Harry shared with Ron.</p>
<p>“I’m awake,” muttered Ron from his room. “I’m awake.” Harry could hear him stumbling around, tripping once before he came across to Harry’s room.</p>
<p>“Morning, Ron,” chirped Harry cheerfully, deliberately provoking the half-conscious Ron.</p>
<p>“Good morning, Harry,” said Ron sarcastically, through gritted teeth, but he was as considerate as ever in helping Harry get ready for the day. Sometime while they had slept, Mrs. Weasley had brought Harry’s gifts up to his room, careful not to wake it’s exhausted inhabitant.</p>
<p>“Could I wear my new cloak today, Ron?”</p>
<p>“Sure.” Ron was slowly waking up. Today, Harry was going back to Hogwarts where the professors would help him learn to perform magic blind and left-handedly. He was actually looking forward to it. At least, he was until he got there.</p>
<p>“As Professor Snape is the only left handed member of the faculty, you will be working with him for the next month,” announced Dumbledore calmly, ignoring the obvious consternation of both Harry and Snape.</p>
<p>“Him?!” they cried in unison, each pointing to the other dramatically. At least, Harry had meant to point at his hated potion’s teacher, but he ended up indicating the wall behind him. Ron laughed and corrected his aim.</p>
<p>“Albus, I don’t think that I am best suited for this task. One-on-one teaching has never been my forte. Maybe you or Minerva would be a better choice.” Snape sounded almost panicked, which made Harry feel better about his own misgivings.</p>
<p>“No, Severus,” said Dumbledore, sounding amused. “This is up to you.”</p>
<p>“If i must,” deferred Snape in a growl, sounding definitively nonplussed. Harry wasn’t happy about it either, but he wasn’t about to complain in front of Snape.</p>
<p>“Good,” said Dumbledore, observing their grudging compliance. “You should work out between the two of you when you are going to meet, and then get started.” He clapped Snape’s shoulder jovially, ignoring the man’s bared teeth. “Well, I leave you to it.”</p>
<p>Upon Dumbledore’s departure, Harry sat nervously, feeling Snape’s glare. He shrugged. “This isn’t my choice, either, Professor. So, when are we going to do this?”</p>
<p>“Immediately, Mr. Potter. Best get this ordeal over as rapidly as possible. Follow me.”</p>
<p>Harry tagged along behind the sweep of Snape’s robes, descending into the dungeons to Snape’s office.</p>
<p>$ More soon, I promise. Same brat time, same brat channel. Not really same time, but you get the idea, right? $</p>

<p>$ To those few of you who got it, of course the pilot was <em>the </em>Frank Abagnale, from Catch Me If You Can. I hardly ever do anything clever on accident. $</p>
<p>$ I don’t particularly like this chapter, especially the stuff between Harry and Snape. Think about it while you read, and I would really appreciate a few constructive comments. $</p>
<p>$ Third comment. This is a long chapter for me.$</p>
<p>Chapter 20</p>
<p>Once Snape committed himself to a course of action, he chose to make a proper job of it. His lessons with Harry were intense, thorough, and long. They left Harry drained every day, but he progressed at a speed that surprised Snape. He just seemed to absorb what Snape had to teach him at an almost alarming rate.</p>
<p>“If only you were so dedicated in my potion’s class, Mr. Potter,” Snape said, coming perilously close to a compliment. Harry only smiled in return.</p>
<p>On their last session, six days before the other students would arrive, they were working on a particularly intricate twist-twitch wand movement. Harry had done it perfectly a number of times since Snape had demonstrated it by the simple expedient of holding Harry’s hand and moving him through it, but now Snape wasn’t paying attention.</p>
<p>“Professor?” Harry drew his attention. Over the past four weeks, the animosity between the two of them had lessened due to enforced proximity. One day, a week in, during the repitition of a simple and tedious exercise, Harry and Snape had suddenly found themselves engaged in conversation. Snape had exploded at Harry’s disability, cursing volubly at the man who had done this to Lily’s son. In his voice, Harry had heard an emotion that he couldn’t quite place.</p>
<p>“Were you close to my mother, then?” he had asked, not really expecting an answer. Snape, however, surprised him.</p>
<p>“I was, yes. Lily was... a good person. Actually,” he said, opening up slowly. “She used to help me with my transfiguration homework, even though we were in different houses. She headed a study group. On Friday’s, after Transfiguration.” He spoke slowly, as if savoring the memories.</p>
<p>“I wish I had known her,” said Harry, downcast. From there, the conversation had expanded, and today, three weeks later, Harry and Snape were almost friends.</p>
<p>“Professor,” Harry repeated.</p>
<p>“Oh, yes, Potter?”</p>
<p>“Have I got it right?” He performed the wand movement one time more, paying attention to nuance.</p>
<p>“Er, yes. That’s correct.” Snape sounded very distracted, and Harry commented on it. “It’s nothing, Potter, not your business.” Snape pulled himself together and stood. “Very good, Potter. I believe there is nothing more I can teach you in this matter. As I have business to attend to, the next time we shall meet will be at the Welcoming Feast.”</p>
<p>“’Till then, then,” said Harry cheerfully, waving. Snape patted his shoulder firmly before leaving in a rush of robes. Harry alone made his way up to the Gryffindor Tower. Halfway there, he ran into Peeves. It was the first time he had encountered him this summer.</p>
<p>“Aww. Is ickle Potty Potter rolling along?” crooned the poltergeist, spinning his chair in a circle. “Where is wee Potter going?”</p>
<p>“I’ll go to the Bloody Baron if you don’t leave off,” threatened Harry. The threat worked, and Peeves zoomed off, bouncing from wall to wall and laughing insanely. Harry laughed to and continued towards the Tower. In front of the portrait, however, stood Dumbledore.</p>
<p>“Harry,” he began warmly. “Term starts shortly, and Severus tells me that you have some spare time. Would you like to go to Diagon Alley with me to collect your school things? I have a free day, and it would be my pleasure to accompany you.”</p>
<p>“Sounds great, Headmaster,” said Harry, beaming. He had been wondering what he would do to fill the hours without schoolwork.</p>
<p>“Than we shall go.”</p>
<p>They took the train once again to King’s Cross, and then the muggle Underground. Unsurprisingly, Dumbledore took all of the muggle technology in stride. Upon arrival at the Leaky Cauldron, Harry was, as always, accorded a hero’s welcome. He blushed at the applause, but didn’t wince as he once would have. He waved to Innkeeper Tom’s cheery “Nice to see ya again, Mr. Potter, Dumbledore,” as they passed straight through and out back to Diagon Alley.</p>
<p>Diagon Alley was as crowded as ever, full of students shopping for their Hogwarts supplies, just like Harry. His first stop was Madam Malkin’s, for new robes. As well as his school robes, he got some varied ones for everyday wear, and a pair of novelty socks for Dobby, one’s which sized themselves to any foot and glowed at night.</p>
<p>Next was Flourish and Blot's, where the storekeeper gladly hunted down self-reading copies of Harry’s required texts, as well as a few books for pleasure. Added to the books he had received for his birthday, he was amassing quite a library.</p>
<p>When he had finished the rest of his list, he was quite content to simply follow Dumbledore through his shopping, interested in what such a wizard would but. Dumbledore kept a running commentary for Harry’s sake, but it was mostly mundane stuff, potion’s ingredients and old books. Last, almost to the evening, Dumbledore stopped Harry’s chair in front of a shop. “Which shop is this?” Harry asked tiredly. It had been a long day.</p>
<p>“This is Quality Quidditch Supplies,” replied the Headmaster, pushing Harry through the door. “You need a new broom.”</p>
<p>“What for?” Harry was puzzled now, and more than a little irritated. “I can’t ride one now, like this.”</p>
<p>“You can,” answered Dumbledore patiently, “If you try.” He turned to address the solicitous shopkeeper. “I owled you about four weeks ago, concerning the order of a custom broom. I understand it is finished?”</p>
<p>“Yes, yes, of course,” simpered the man, and he ducked into a back room. “I’ll be just a moment,” he called back.</p>
<p>“What’s this about, Professor?” Harry was still confused.</p>
<p>“I should explain, shouldn’t I?” Well, on your birthday, Harry, I ordered a broomstick on your behalf. It is a Starstone, absolute top of the line, and I’ve had it added to. Now, it will clasp you to itself, in much the same manner as your chair, and you steer it with a harness that will attach to your shoulders, leaving you a hand free to catch the Snitch.”</p>
<p>“Haw can I catch the Snitch if I can’t <em>see</em>?” Harry was beginning to get exasperated now, but the older man didn’t seem to notice.</p>
<p>“That will be taken care of, Harry. Ah, here it is. Would you like to try it out immediately?”</p>
<p>All hesitation was instantly forgotten. “Yeah!” Harry was excited now, as Dumbledore put the Starstone in his lap, describing it while Harry explored its shape.</p>
<p>The Starstone was longer than his Firebolt had been, and slimmer, with a more delicate transition between the handle and the brush. It felt good in his hand, almost humming with energy. According to Dumbledore, the handle was made of frosted glass, translucently blue, with a tail of fine, pale twigs. Harry could feel his name etched at its head, along with what Dumbledore said was stylized lightning bolt. He smiled at that. The modifications were evident as well, three pairs of slender arms extended from the staff, each delicately filigreed with tiny veins of silver. It felt good. It felt right.</p>
<p>“So, you gonna try it?” asked the shopkeeper with an odd tone to his voice. Something like awed hope.</p>
<p>“Of course,” said Harry eagerly. “A hand, Professor?”</p>
<p>With Dumbledore’s help, Harry was soon mounted on his new broom, floating a few feet above the floor. His useless foot and stumpy leg were firmly secured in dragon-hide stirrups so that they wouldn’t dangle, and the six arms were twined about him from his hips to his shoulders, holding him upright and canted slightly forward. The silver filigree had expanded to cover his shoulders, his neck, and the back of his head. His hand was free, just like Dumbledore had promised. After the shopkeeper had delivered a rapid-fire series of instructions, Harry was ready.</p>
<p>The skills that had earned him a place on the Gryffindor Quidditch team in his first year hadn’t deserted him. In a matter of minutes, Harry had mastered the strange new broom. He raced around the shop, avoiding people, walls, and racks of merchandise as though he could see them. Quickly, he had accrued a fair-sized crowd as an audience, all of whom applauded to see their young hero so obviously unfazed by his trials. This, is fact, had been one of Dumbledore’s main aims in getting Harry back on a broomstick. It had worked.</p>
<p>“Harry,” he called at last. “It’s time to go.”</p>
<p>“Aw,” pleaded Harry. “Do I have to?”</p>
<p>Dumbledore chuckled warmly. “I’m afraid so, Harry. I have to get back to the castle. Come on.” He disengaged Harry from the broom and settled him back into his chair. “Remember, the broom is yours now. You’ll need to practice hard to be ready when the next Quidditch season starts, right?”</p>
<p>After Harry bought the rest of his Quidditch supplies, he and Dumbledore went back to the castle. There, the headmaster let Harry fly through the halls until well after midnight. When he did at last go to bed, it was with his Starstone in arm’s reach.</p>
<p>The last few days of the summer literally flew by for Harry, who spent every waking moment on his broom, eschewing his wheelchair entirely. Dumbledore had enchanted a Snitch for him so that it whistled highly, only for his ears. It was not loud, so the chances of his hearing it were the exact same as those of a sighted Seeker seeing it. Dumbledore had checked with Ludo Bagman, and all of the modifications, both to the broom and to the Snitch, were perfectly legal in any Quidditch match. They would even be allowed in the World Cup, should Harry go that far in a Quidditch career.</p>
<p>The fell of flying again, wind reddening his cheeks as he sped far out over the lake, this was what he had been missing, and he had barely even known it. His emotions when he first caught the Snitch were indescribable, and he wept from a place beyond joy.</p>
<p>The day school would start, Dumbledore woke him very early. The house elves hadn’t even lit the fires yet. “Harry,” he said, sounding slightly abashed. “Today, the staff traditionally have a quidditch match. An informal one, just for old time’s sake, but it is vaguely Gryffindor versus Slytherin, and they trounced us last year. We need a good Seeker.”</p>
<p>“Are you asking me to play?” Harry was excited and amused. Even the teacher’s thought he was good! “Sure! Who’s the Slytherin Seeker?”</p>
<p>Dumbledore answered with a chuckle. “Professor Snape.”</p>
<p>Immediately after breakfast, Dumbledore helped Harry into his Quidditch robes and onto his broomstick, and pointed out the rest of the team. He, Professor Vector, and Madame Hooch were the Chasers, Professor McGonagall was the Keeper, and the Beaters were Hagrid and... Remus Lupin.</p>
<p>“Professor Lupin!” cried out Harry in delight. “Are you teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts this year?”</p>
<p>“No, I’m not,” said Lupin. “Dumbledore told me that Defense Against the Dark Arts teachers are still scarce on the ground, but this year Professor Snape gets the job. I’m taking over potions from him. I know I’m not quite as adept there as he is, but I think I’ll do.”</p>
<p>“You’ll do great,” was all Harry had time to say, and then the game began.</p>
<p>Professor Trelawney was announcing the match and Harry, for once, found himself listening intently to her. The game was fast, faster than any he had ever played, and he loved it. He could track his teammates and opponents by listening to them whistling through the air, fast as bullets. Gryffindor scored, then Slytherin, and then Gryffindor again, all in an instant. But when the game was 260-270, Slytherin up, he heard the Snitch, zipping past above him. He raced after its sound, following the tiny whistle straight up. Snape had seen it in the same instant, but Harry could hear him falling behind, cursing and unable to keep up. Suddenly, the Snitch reversed, began to fall straight down. Harry didn’t turn to follow it. Instead, smiling, he stalled his broom, beginning a freefall. He fell past a startled Snape, through a layer of Catchers and Beaters, all trying to save him. He didn’t need saving, not this time. Still harnessed to his broomstick, Harry spread his arms wide, an exultant grin across his face. Without even trying, the Snitch was suddenly trapped in his hand. He halted his fall immediately and hovered, still on his back with the grass of the Quidditch Pitch only a foot below him. The other players landed around him an instant later.</p>
<p>“You fool Potter! You pull a stunt like that again and...” Snape was speechless with rage, and Harry suspected that his face would be approaching the shade of a violet pudding.</p>
<p>“Aww. Severus. I didn’t know you cared,” Harry drawled. “And what? You’ll expel me?” He was still on an adrenaline high, and didn’t care.</p>
<p>“Calm down,” said Dumbledore, dismounting. “Harry knew what he was doing, didn’t you, Harry?”</p>
<p>Harry shrugged. “I was just having fun.” He heard Dumbledore laugh sharply. “What?”</p>
<p>“That’s what James said when he pulled this same stunt. I think you did it with more flair, though. Your father hit Severus here on his way down. It spoiled his form somewhat.”</p>
<p>“And broke my bloody arm!” cried Snape, but Dumbledore waved him away. McGonagall spoke up next, having just landed.</p>
<p>“You are OK, Harry?” she asked anxiously.</p>
<p>“I’m fine,” replied Harry, wishing that people would stop asking him that.</p>
<p>“Oh My Goodness, look at the time!” she exclaimed suddenly. “The students will be arriving in less than an hour!”</p>
<p>“Erk,” said Hagrid, surprised. “I’d better hurry down to th’ station, then.”</p>
<p>“We’ve all got things to do,” said Dumbledore calmingly. “Just get to them. I’ll walk Harry back up to the castle.” Having summoned Harry’s chair, he levitated him into it and the two started across the grounds as the others ran off in various directions.</p>
<p>“Did my dad really do that falling thing?” Harry asked as they left the pitch.</p>
<p>“He did. He called it the Potter Faint Feint. It wasn’t his signature move, but it was his favorite. He had been signed by the London Lowflights by the time he graduated.” They had reached the castle. “Do you want to wait for the students to arrive in the Great Hall, or with Professor McGonagall?”</p>
<p>“With Professor McGonagall, please. I’d like to get the staring and the whispers over as soon as possible. Plus, it’ll be fun to scare the first years.” He pulled off his blindfold and stared towards Dumbledore “How do I look?”</p>
<p>“Unnerving as ever,” said Dumbledore with a mock shudder before he left Harry in the entry-way. Harry directed his chair down to the room where McGonagall was waiting for the annual crop of new students.</p>
<p>It wasn’t long before the first First Years arrived. Seeing Harry at the top of the stairs, a tiny girl screamed. McGonagall whirled to find Harry, slumped limply to one side, his black eyes open and staring in a scarred, vacant face. “Mr. Potter!” she snapped. “Please endeavor to look less dead. You’re scaring the First Years.”</p>
<p>“That,” said Harry as he closed his eyes and adjusted his chair to hold him upright, “was entirely the point, Professor McGonagall. I’m sorry, but I couldn’t resist,” he apologized to the younger students. The girl who had screamed approached him cautiously.</p>
<p>“You’re Harry Potter?” she asked in a whisper. He nodded, and was greatly surprised when she embraced him fiercely. Releasing him after a very long moment, she spoke again. “My name is Breena, Breena Diggory.”</p>
<p>“Oh,” was all Harry could say, absolutely stunned. “You’re...?”</p>
<p>“Cedric was my brother.”</p>
<p>“Oh,” Harry said again, feeling very stupid and awkward. What could he say to this girl? I’m sorry I got your brother killed? What he ended up saying was “I’m sorry about Cedric.”</p>
<p>“Oh. Thank you, but it’s not your fault, even my dad admits to that. We’re actually very grateful to you for bringing his body back to us.”</p>
<p>“He asked me to,” Harry said sadly, and then McGonagall led the new students into the Great Hall. Harry came in behind him, and then made a beeline for his spot at the Gryffindor table, joining Ron and Hermione.</p>
<p>“’Lo, Harry,” said Ron.</p>
<p>“Hi,” added Hermione.</p>
<p>“Good to see you, Ron, ‘Mione,” said Harry, before he was interrupted by a familiar drawl behind him.</p>
<p>“Have a good summer with those muggles of yours, did you, Potter” said Draco Malfoy. Harry swiveled his chair to face him, and was deeply satisfied to hear his rival stumble backwards with a half-formed curse. He had not yet replaced the blindfold.</p>
<p>“Actually, Malfoy, I did not. They’re just like you, to tell the truth. You hate muggles, just on principle, and they hate wizards. You’d get along famously.”</p>
<p>Draco was incoherent with rage at having been compared to a muggle. “I... uh... you...”</p>
<p>“Snake got your tongue, Malfoy?” said another voice. “How fortunate for you. If I had had to listen to insult Potter again, I would have been forced to take points from my own house.” The voice, smooth and icy, belonged to Snape. Harry grinned to hear him tell Malfoy off.</p>
<p>“Hello, Professor Snape,” he said cheerily, wishing desperately that he could see Malfoy’s face. Hermione, on his left, was making little muffled sounds of hysterical laughter.</p>
<p>“Hey, Malfoy,” interjected Ron. “You should be happy. With Harry off the Gryffindor Quidditch team, you might actually have a chance at getting near the Snitch.”</p>
<p>“Hey!” said Harry indignantly. “Since when am I off the team?”</p>
<p>“Well,” said Ron, sounding abashed. “I just thought, well...”</p>
<p>“Here,” said Harry, producing something from a magically enlarged cavity in his chair. “One of my less considerate fans sent me this as a get-well-soon gift. I think they made it. Apparently, it’s a hybrid between a wizard camera and a muggle camcorder. I filmed this with it this morning.” With that, he thumbed the ‘on’ switch, wishing yet again that he could see.</p>
<p>What everybody but Harry saw was the Quidditch Pitch, as it had been after breakfast that morning. To all appearances, they had all apparated their, for they could no longer see the seats on which they sat. Around and above them were the players in that morning’s game. Trelawney’s voice, easily recognized by those who had her class, announced the score.</p>
<p>“<em>Gryffindor 260 to Slytherin 270!</em>” The Slytherin students cheered to see their alumni in the lead, but everyone else’s eyes were riveted on the drama above. They watched as Harry ascended after the Snitch. Harry heard Hermione mutter “Icarus Complex,” and laughed. He knew what came next.</p>
<p>The next second, the entire audience gasped as one when Harry’s odd broomstick apparently failed, and he plummeted backward towards them and the hard ground. Not a few people screamed as the image of Harry fell directly into, no, <em>through </em>the real Professor Snape to stop abruptly at the level of his knees. Growling, Snape stepped out of Harry’s image only to have his own land directly on top of him, and then run to Harry’s side.</p>
<p>“You fool Potter!” the whole student body heard before the real Snape reached the camcorder-thing, shutting it off ill-temperedly.</p>
<p>“If you are finished disrupting this sorting, Potter, may we please proceed?” asked Snape sarcastically through clenched teeth.</p>
<p>“You may,” said Harry airily, waving his hand in benediction. His fellow Gryffindors laughed disbelievingly and Snape returned stiffly to his place at the high table. Order restored, Professor McGonagall proceeded with the Sorting. The Hat, when placed on its customary stool, sang out as always with a new song.</p>
<p>Oh, when you look at me,</p>
<p>You may see just what you see.</p>
<p>But you’d be wrong if you thought that</p>
<p>Was all there was to me.</p>
<p>Ten lives of yours and more ago,</p>
<p>The Founders needed one to know</p>
<p>Who they would teach when they were gone,</p>
<p>So in me that knowledge they did throw.</p>
<p>Gryffindor’s the house to choose</p>
<p>If courage is a trait you’d use,</p>
<p>Or P’rhaps in Ravenclaw you’ll find</p>
<p>Friends like you with clever minds.</p>
<p>If you work hard, and play as well,</p>
<p>Than Hufflepuff is where you’d dwell.</p>
<p>But should you find yourself in Slytherin,</p>
<p>Slyness is yours, and ambition.</p>
<p>Seven years from now, when you must leave,</p>
<p>You’ll miss me, and I know you’ll grieve.</p>
<p>“That crazy old hat,” you may well say,</p>
<p>“Placed me well, my Sorting Day.”</p>
<p>$ Well, did you like it? I want to rewrite the scenes between Harry and Snape, but I need some suggestions. Before anyone tries it, this story is not, nor ever will be slash of any form. I read it, I don’t write it. $</p>

<p>$ Hi. For those of you who keep asking about Sirius, tough. He’s not going to be a big part of this story. I just find him a very boring character. I like Lupin and Snape much more, so they will have bigger parts. Sorry. $</p>
<p>Chapter 22</p>
<p>As usual, a round of applause celebrated the Hat’s song, and the Sorting commenced. Harry waited eagerly to hear what house Breena was sorted into, but McGonagall’s list went straight from Declan, Allison to Duran, Michael. Harry didn’t mention the skip to Ron and Hermione, not really wanting to be the one to bring the name ‘Diggory’ into the open, but he thought hard on it, not listening to the rest of the Sorting until Ron nudged him hard.</p>
<p>“Huh?” he said stupidly.</p>
<p>“There’s a new student, Harry,” he whispered excitedly.</p>
<p>“There are new students every year, you prat!” responded Harry mildly.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” said Ron, “but this one’s not a First Year!” As if on cue, Professor McGonagall began to speak.</p>
<p>“We have a departure from the ordinary this year, students. Breena Diggory is coming to us as a fifth year from the Pacific School of Sorcery in Alaska of the United States of America. We all remember Cedric Diggory, her elder brother. Please, do not trouble her about his death. She needs all of your support. Breena, please step forward.”</p>
<p>The Hat didn’t take long at all to Sort Breena. Although Cedric had been a Hufflepuff, for his sister, the Hat shouted “Gryffindor!” Harry clapped as loudly as any of his housemates as the girl ran down from the dais, and once again she surprised him with an enthusiastic hug.</p>
<p>“Friend of yours, Harry?” asked Ron, sounding amused. Hermione giggled.</p>
<p>“We’ve met,” responded Harry. “No offense, Breena, but I thought you were a first year.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I’ve gotten that a lot.”</p>
<p>“Huh? Is everybody as blind as I am?”</p>
<p>“No, silly,” she laughed. She took his hand and placed it on top of her head. “I’m only four foot three. Half the first years are taller than me.”</p>
<p>“Well, you’re taller than I am,” joked Harry, feeling more at ease with Cedric’s sister than he would have thought possible. It was her easygoing manner, and she obviously held no grudge against him. She vaulted over the table to sit across from him, wedging a place for herself between Fred and George. Everyone turned their attention back to the Head Table, where Dumbledore had just come to his feet.</p>
<p>“Well, here we are once again, at the beginning of yet another year. This year will be different than those we are used to. As you all know, two of our students are here this year under unusual circumstances. They both need your respect, not your pity. I speak, of course, of Breena Diggory and Harry Potter. I know that those of you in non-magical families may not have access to Wizarding news, and may not be familiar with these names. Before you hear any rumours, I will explain Harry’s situation.” Harry shrunk into his chair, not wanting to hear once again the details of his injuries, but all Dumbledore said was “Early this summer, Harry’s uncle tortured him in an attempt to steal the Potter family fortune. As a result of the injuries he received, Harry is now blind, and unable to walk. Be considerate of him, but do not pity him.</p>
<p>“Oh,” he said in a much lighter tone. “I do have some very bad news for Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Harry is still the Seeker for the Gryffindor Quidditch team, and, as you all have seen, his skills have most certainly not suffered.” These last comments broke the aura of tension in the room, and people here and there laughed. Harry was relieved. While many people would still want to know more, they at least knew enough that he would not have to incessantly explain. “To proceed with the rest of my announcements,” continued Dumbledore, his voice instantly quelling the rising conversations in the Hall. “As always, the Forbidden Forest is strictly forbidden to <em>all </em>students. Also, I am pleased to introduce your two new Professors. Remus Lupin, whom you older students should remember, has returned. This time, he will be teaching potions, as Professor Snape has finally gotten the Defense Against the Dark Arts postion that he has always wanted.” Everyone laughed at that, even the first years who had no clue what the Head master was talking about. “And this is Sirius Black, here to teach Auror Method’s and Magic to Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Year students. His classes are mandatory, and have been added to all of your schedules.’ groans greeted this last, but apparently Sirius’s innocence was now well known, as there were no screams of terror. Harry, Hermione, and the Weasley's cheered for his godfather.</p>
<p>The feast was as good as ever, even if Harry couldn’t eat it. He was reaqquainting himself happily with his fellow Gryffindors when Malfoy returned, his cold voice cutting into a spirited, six-way quidditch-based conversation.</p>
<p>“Is what I hear true, Potter? You’re a Weasley now?”</p>
<p>“I am,” said Harry proudly. “What of it?”</p>
<p>“I thought the Headmaster said you had a fortune. He mast have been mistaken, if that miserable excuse for a pureblood family adopted you. They seem to be allergic to gold.”</p>
<p>“Actually, Malfoy,” said a widely grinning Harry. He was going to enjoy putting the Slytherin down a peg. “I think I’m richer than you.” Beckoning his rival closer, he whispered figure into Malfoy’s ear, relishing the indrawn breath of shock. “I never knew how much fun being inconceivably wealthy could be,” he confided in a laughing Ron as a amazingly subdued Draco retreated to his own table.</p>
<p>As dinner was finished, Dumbledore stood once again. “If I am not mistaken, three out of our four Quidditch teams are in need of new captains this year. Will the members of Gryffindor, Slytherin, and Hufflepuff teams please rise.”</p>
<p>While Fred, George, and Angelina Johnson, the only remaining members of the Gryffindor team still in Hogwarts stood, Harry poked his chair with his wand. Its eight legs unfolded to raise him above the level of the seated students around him.</p>
<p>“Good, good. Now, we will begin with Gryffindor. Will the team members please use their wands to vote for their choice?”</p>
<p>Harry had thought long on this, and voted now for George, but when the results were in, he was shocked to learn that all three of the others had elected him. He, Harry Potter, was Quidditch Captain for Gryffindor. The whole table stood as one to cheer. “Speech! Speech!” hooted the twins until Harry waved them off.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” he said, speaking around the lump of emotion in his throat. “I’m very flattered, and I will try my best, always. Gryffindor’s name <em>will </em>be on this year’s Cup!” The cheers grew, drowning out the boos and hisses emanating from Slytherin as Harry lowered himself back to the table. They finally died down in time to hear Chadwick Compton voted Captain Hufflepuff.</p>
<p>“I pity him,” whispered Ron to Harry. “He has to fill Cedric’s shoes. He’ll never do it.”</p>
<p>For Slytherin, Draco and his erstwhile teammates elected Travis Mallow, a Fifth Year that Harry remembered as being about six foot five and almost as wide as Dudley, muscle-bound and thick necked.</p>
<p>“I’m not worried. We’ll have no problem beating him,” confided Harry confidently to <em>his </em>team. “I can’t wait to see what we get in the trials. That’s in two weeks. I’m really looking forward to it. We’ve had no new blood in this team since me.”</p>
<p>“Careful, Harry,” jibed George. “You’re beginning to sound like Wood.”</p>
<p>“That’s a bad thing?” deadpanned Harry, and then he smiled.</p>
<p>Dumbledore was still not quite finished, not quite. “Due to certain events this summer and last year, prefects have not yet been appointed. Instead, we have four Head Boys and Girls, one per house. By Halloween, I will have elected all eight prefects, but I cannot explain the reasons behind the display just yet.</p>
<p>“Now, I believe that this feast has run well overlong, so have just to sing the school anthem and you can all toddle off to bed.” Harry was delighted. He hadn’t gotten to sing the anthem since his first year, and he loved it. Everyone sang lustily, choosing their own tune and completely ignoring Dumbledore’s conducting.</p>
<p>“Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts,</p>
<p>Teach us something please!</p>
<p>Whether we be old and bald</p>
<p>Or young with scabby knees,</p>
<p>Our heads could do with filling</p>
<p>With some interesting stuff,</p>
<p>For now they’re bare and full of air,</p>
<p>Dead flies and bits of fluff.</p>
<p>So teach us things worth knowing,</p>
<p>Bring back what we’ve forgot,</p>
<p>Just do your best. we’ll do the rest,</p>
<p>And learn until our brains all rot.”</p>
<p>This time, Harry, Ron, and Hermione joined the twins in their funerary rendition of the ancient, irreverent lyrics, falling down laughing over each other at the end, and then they left the table as a group, repeating snatches of the song as they climbed to the tower. They parted in the common room to go to their respective dorms, still laughing. As Ron tucked Harry into bed, Harry plugged himself into his nutria-potion. A moment later, Seamus, Dean, and Neville piled into the room.</p>
<p>“Oy, Harry, what’s that?” cried Neville.</p>
<p>“What’s what?” asked Harry patiently. “Neville, I can’t see what you’re pointing at.”</p>
<p>“That.. thing... er... poking into you arm, er.. How did you know I was pointing if you can't see me?”</p>
<p>“It’s kind of obvious,” said Harry, blowing his hair out of his useless eyes. “Even to a blind boy. This is an IV line, Neville. IV stands for intravenous, or ‘in the veins.’ It’s delivering this nutria-potion here,” He tapped the bottle at his side. “Straight into my blood. See, below here,” now he tapped his sternum, “nothing works. I can’t feel it, I can’t move it, and it doesn’t work. Here, pick up my foot. Pinch it, poke it, whatever. I don’t care.” He flipped the covers off his whole leg. “Are you doing anything?” he asked a moment later. “I can’t tell.”</p>
<p>“All right,” said Seamus from somewhere near his feet. “But how are you going to Quidditch Captain if you can’t even walk?”</p>
<p>“I don't need to walk, if I have my chair or my broom. <em>Accio Starstone!</em>” His new broom swept up from its place under his bed to nudge gently against his hand. He gripped it<em>. </em>“It’s a Starstone, with a few modifications. Dumbledore ordered it for me.”</p>
<p>“A Starstone? Really? A real Starstone?”</p>
<p>“Uh huh.”</p>
<p>“By Merlin, Harry, do you know what types of broomsticks Starstone makes? They make one of a kind brooms, and really wealthy people collect them. No one actually <em>flies </em>a Starstone, they’re just too valuable! Dad’s seen one <em>once</em>, when he was invited to Princess Diana’s wedding as a representative of his department.”</p>
<p>Huh. Well, not to brag or anything, but I can buy about a hundred of these, so I plan to fly this one. Wait. Princess Di was a witch?”</p>
<p>“Nah, muggle through and through, but she got one as a gift from Mr. Hermes himself.”</p>
<p>“Who?”</p>
<p>“Oy, Harry. You’ve been in the wizarding world for five years now, and you still don’t know anything. Mr. Arturio Hermes, the guy who makes the Starstone brooms. He’s an artist, an incredible one. He’d probably have an apoplexy if he knew you were actually <em>using </em>yours.” Ron sounded annoyed, but admiring, and Harry rose to the bait.</p>
<p>“Would this Mr. Hermes ever allow someone else to modify one of his amazing brooms?” He indicated the arms there to hold him.</p>
<p>“No, but,”</p>
<p>“Well, then <em>he </em>modified mine so that I could <em>fly</em> it. Apparently, this broom was made to win Quidditch games. Ron, it’s incredible! I can’t fell it below me, but I don’t think that I would even if I could. With the steering harness, It feels like I have my own wings. That game this morning was the best I’ve ever flown!” Harry said fervently.</p>
<p>“Wings,” muttered Ron, obviously caught by the word. “Oh! I almost forgot! One of the firsties is a boy named Tristan McGinnis. He’s half-fae, he wants desperately to play Quidditch, <em>and </em>he got sorted into Gryffindor. I’m sure he’ll be at the trials, even if he is a firstie.”</p>
<p>“Hmm. I’d have to get Professor McGonagall’s permission to get him a broom, if he’s any good.”</p>
<p>mused Harry, but Ron interrupted him.</p>
<p>“He’s going to be good! He’s damn fast, and he’s got wings!”</p>
<p>“Wings? He’s in. I will have to get him a broom, but the rules only say that he has to ride it for the first minute of play.”</p>
<p>“You <em>do </em>sound like Wood,” laughed Ron. “You’re gonna be a great captain!”</p>
<p>“Thanks for the vote of confidence,” said Harry. Suddenly, he yawned. “Good night, guys.”</p>
<p>$ Is it just me, or do I end a lot of chapters with Harry falling asleep? It’s just an easy method of transition, I guess. Aye well, read and review and I love you.</p>

  <b>
    <u>Chapter 23</u>
  </b>
</p>
<p>As always, their first class was potions with the Slytherins. The difference this year was that, instead of Snape brooding at the front of the class, it was Remus Lupin who greeted them all warmly.</p>
<p>“Before we do anything, students, I need to collect your homework that Professor Snape assigned you last spring.” He consulted his notes. “That would be, er, the Nuageur Potion and the Optichroma Elixir. Just bring your vials up and put them in these,” he said, tapping two labeled bins. The entire class, save Harry, trooped up to the desk with their homework. “Harry?” said Lupin questioningly. “Do you have the assignments?”</p>
<p>“No,” replied Harry, determined not to show weakness before this friend of his father’s. “I did them, and Professor Snape has already seen the results. He should have given you my grade.”</p>
<p>“No, he hasn’t.” Lupin sounded a little confused, and Harry was provoked by Draco’s snickers from the Slytherin side of the dungeon, so he decided to explain.</p>
<p>“Here are the results, than. Malfoy’s already seen them.” Yet again, he pulled off his blindfold to expose the lifeless eyes beneath it. “The Optichroma Elixir changes the imbiber’s eye color, and the Nuageur Potion creates clouds in clear sky. <em>Do not mix them.</em> If you do, the hornwort and the isrythil root from the Optichroma Elixir will combine with the salamander skin and breath in the Nuageur Potion to form a variant of the Eaufeu Catalyst. When this mixture is taken internally, the other ingredients from the Elixir will direct the catalyst to the eyes, which are then burnt from the inside out. The Nuageur Potion confines it’s effects to the eyes so that it doesn’t spread.” His voice was perfectly impassionate, as though what he was describing had not happened to himself. “The immediate effect is burning, actual flames shooting from the eye sockets. Long-term effects include irreparable blindness and,” he paused to smile. “No eyelashes, and frightened First Years.”</p>
<p>Silence met his recitation. Even the Slytherins had nothing to say. It was a very long pause before Lupin gathered his wits again, changing the subject effortlessly to continue with his first class. After a few moments, however, Malfoy interrupted him stridently. “Why would anyone be thick enough to drink something like that?” As the class was now discussing famous potioners, everyone knew what he was talking about. Harry replied, sounding irritated.</p>
<p>“<em>Accio knife</em>!” he hissed. He had barely spoken when a boning knife from the kitchens appeared in is hand. In his chair, he vaulted over the intervening tables to land directly in front of Malfoy. He pressed the blade under his jaw. Everyone drew back, unwilling to interfere for fear of causing Harry’s hand to flinch. “Call me ‘Sir,’ Malfoy,” he growled, drawing the blade back an inch.</p>
<p>“Yes, S- Sir,” stuttered Malfoy, trembling and paler than usual. Harry drew back the rest of the way and banished the knife back to the kitchens.</p>
<p>“See how quickly you caved, and that was my first threat. I didn’t give in until that bastard had broken my elbow <em>and</em> cut off my thumb. Now, leave off!”</p>
<p>No one said anything as he wheeled back to his place, but after class, Lupin drew him aside. “What was behind that, Harry?” he asked, resting a hand on Harry’s shoulder. Harry shrugged it off.</p>
<p>“Malfoy had it coming, Professor,” he said stiffly. “He’s had it coming since first year.”</p>
<p>“I won’t disagree with you, and that’s why I didn’t take any points off of Gryffindor, but you can’t just threaten people with knives, even to prove a point. I’m giving you an hour of detention, here, tomorrow after dinner.”</p>
<p>Harry’s black mood lifted as suddenly as it had fallen. “See you then, Moony,” he said, smiling over his shoulder as he left the dungeon. “I’ve got to go or I’ll be late for Divination, and we both know what a shame that would be. They both laughed as Harry climbed the stairs.</p>
<p>Harry had been wondering just how he would get into the attic where Sybil Trelawney taught, but when he came to the foot of the rope ladder, his chair didn’t stop, just mounted rungs like a spider on a web. The similarity, in fact, was so strong that Ron, standing below him, shuddered.</p>
<p>“You look like a spider,” he said, beginning to climb himself.</p>
<p>“Cool,” replied Harry, grinning down at his friend. “Just call me Aragog.”</p>
<p>Ron shuddered again as he reached the top of the ladder. “I thought we agreed never to mention that again.” Harry just laughed.</p>
<p>Professor Trelawney made her usual dramatic entrance a moment later, looming from her shadowed, curtained office and peering through her bug-glasses. The effect was entirely lost on Harry. Abruptly, before she could speak, Harry went rigid. A low sepulchral voice issued from his open mouth.</p>
<p>“Sybil Ann Trelawney,” he intoned. “I see you. You were born thirty-nine years, eight months, and seventeen days, and four hours ago, in Mercy Hospital, Dublin, Ireland. Room 12C. You will die...”</p>
<p>“No!” cried Trelawney, composure completely abandoned. “No! I don’t want to know!”</p>
<p>Interrupted, Harry stopped. Slowly he relaxed, closing both his mouth and his eyes and shaking his head as if to clear it. When he spoke again, it was in a normal voice. “You mean you don’t know yourself, Professor?” he asked innocently. She gasped.</p>
<p>“You had a true seeing, and you <em>remembered </em>it?”</p>
<p>“I did, didn’t I? Isn’t it normal to remember?”</p>
<p>“Not as a child. Not always as an adult, but never as a child. Have you had any visions before? Here, wait a moment.” She had utterly abandoned her mystic air, letting it give way to frank curiosity. “Class dismissed! We will get back together tomorrow. Harry, dear, could you please step into my office? I’d really like to talk to you.”</p>
<p>“See you later, Ron,” said Harry regretfully as the class filed out around him.</p>
<p>“What was that?“ whispered Ron as he passed. Harry could only shrug in puzzlement. He then turned to follow Professor Trelawney into her office, feeling a mild sense of unease. With the door closed behind them, Trelawney rounded on him excitedly.</p>
<p>“Have you ever <em>seen </em>before?”</p>
<p>“No, not that I can remember.”</p>
<p>“No unexplained blackouts, fainting, anything like that?”</p>
<p>“No, I don’t think so.”</p>
<p>Her voice turned a trifle suspicious. “You’re not just pulling a prank, are you?”</p>
<p>“No,” Harry hastened to say. He was actually eager to describe what had happened. “I was as surprised as you. It was really weird. I mean, all of a sudden, I could see! For a moment, I thought that somehow, my sight had come back, and I tried to look around, but I couldn’t. All I could do was watch a little room where a woman, a witch was giving birth, and I knew where I was, and when I was, and exactly what I was seeing, like someone very close to me was standing right behind me, telling me, and then I saw you again, but <em>you </em>didn’t want to see that part, so it went away. I can’t remember what I was about o see there. Is that what seeing is like for you?” Harry was as excited as Professor Trelawney. He had seen something! Even if it wasn’t with his own eyes.</p>
<p>“My seeings aren’t that clear, Harry, and I don’t often remember them. You told me about one of mine at the end of the year before last, did you not? The night Sirius Black escaped the Dementors?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, but you didn’t believe me. Dumbledore did, when I told him later. He said that brought your total of true seeings up to two.”</p>
<p>“Future seeings, yes.” Trelawney seemed embarrassed. “I can predict fairly well, tea leaves, crystal balls and the sort, but seeings are much, much more rare. And I can see the past and the present without too much effort, but they are easier.” Harry could hear tea pouring, but Trelawney was considerate enough not to offer him a cup.</p>
<p>“But I saw the past, and I was about to see the future. Does that mean I’m a seer?” Harry didn’t know whether to be eager or depressed. He had always denigrated Divination, not believing in predicting the future.</p>
<p>“It does,” said Professor Trelawney, sounding delighted. “But don’t worry. If you don’t want the visions, I have a charm that I can teach you to ward them off. When I was a young witch, mine were overwhelming. Everyone I met, I would see their past, to the point where I couldn’t tell if I was talking to an old man, a youth, or a young boy. I didn’t get it under control until I came here. Dumbledore helped me.</p>
<p>Harry thought about his options before he spoke again. “I’ll try this for a while, to see if I can handle it. I like being able to see something.”</p>
<p>“Alright then. I’m sure you want to join your friends, so you can go. Just, if you’ll come by later this evening, I’ll have some books on this for you to read. They’ll help you to understand this, I hope. See you then?”</p>
<p>“OK,” agreed Harry. “See you then.” With that, he directed his chair back to the Gryffindor Common Room, knowing that he would find Ron and Hermione there. He was right. They were there, along with the rest of his year. They all crowded around him.</p>
<p>“What was that all about, Harry?” asked Ron immediately. Harry told them all about his conversation with the Divination teacher, even what he had seen.</p>
<p>“Ron, I could see! Really see!” he finished fervently.</p>
<p>“Harry, that’s great,” replied Ron, sounding just a little uncertain about his friend’s new ability. “It sure shocked old Bug-eyes, though, didn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, it sure did,” laughed Harry. “Almost as much as Malfoy in Potions.”</p>
<p>Ron laughed hard at this. “Oh, I wish you could have seen his face Harry. He was dead white, and fit to piss himself. Snape would have killed you, but Lupin just let it slide.”</p>
<p>“Er, not quite,” amended Harry. “I’ve got a detention with him tomorrow night. He did agree with me, though. Malfoy only got what he deserved.” A note of suppressed anger showed under his voice, but there was no sign of it in his face.</p>
<p>“He did, didn’t he?” agreed Ron. “Are you coming to lunch?”</p>
<p>“No,” said Harry. “You go. I’m going to ask Dumbledore about something.”</p>
<p>“Nah, I’ll come. Not hungry anyway.”</p>
<p>“Alright, then, come on.” Harry led the way to the gargoyle that led to Dumbledore’s office. “Skittles,” he announced, and the statue leapt aside to allow the two students to ascend. Dumbledore was waiting patiently at the top, obviously expecting them.</p>
<p>$ OK. I wasn’t intending to end this chapter here, but I feel that none of you want to wait two weeks for an update from me. I’m using a different computer than normal, so nobody blame me if this chapter ends up looking odd. It’s not my fault. $</p>

So now I’m back, and I expect hundreds of grateful reviews. Or at least three, and a flame. That’s a more realistic expectation, right? Ah... so then, here. $</p>
<p>Chapter 24</p>
<p>“May I help you, Harry, Ron?” he asked, smiling benignly.</p>
<p>“Professor,” Harry replied, jumping directly to his point. “May I have my own room? I think I’m making my dorm-mates uncomfortable, and I’d rather not have that between them and me.”</p>
<p>“That’s not what I expected you to be here about, but I understand, but there are a few concerns. It is true that you need help, whether you like that fact or not. Madame Pomfrey has insisted that you have someone within earshot at night, just in case.”</p>
<p>Inspiration struck Harry. “Ron could share the room with me. He has to help me already anyway, and he’s my brother. It’s fun scaring First Years and Slytherins, but I don’t want to scare my friends. Plus, it’s embarrassing for me.”</p>
<p>Ron agreed happily to Harry’s idea. “I agree with Harry, Professor,” he said, nodding. “The other guys aren’t really dealing with this in the dorm. even though, during the day, they’re OK with it. Harry can’t even dress himself, he needs as much privacy as he <em>can </em>get.”</p>
<p>“I believe that will work admirably, Mr. Weasley. There is, in fact, a room adjoining your current dorm that will be perfectly suited to this situation. You can enter it via a house-elf passage. Dobby will show you, if you can find him. He should be in the kitchens, this time of day. But I wanted to talk to you about the news I got from Trelawney. She told me you had a vision.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I did,” said Harry. “She said what I saw was true, and that it was very extraordinary for a youth to see the future and then to remember it.”</p>
<p>“It certainly is,” said Dumbledore musingly, “but we have always expected the extraordinary from you.”</p>
<p>“What?” Harry was surprised. “Why from me? I’m not that special.”</p>
<p>“He’s right, he’s not,” interrupted Ron jokingly. Harry meant to elbow him in the ribs, but he was too low and only hit his thigh.</p>
<p>“I mean it. Why does everybody expect me to save the world?”</p>
<p>Dumbledore suddenly grew cryptic. His voice was light, but somber. “You’ll know before too much longer, but we can’t tell you now.” With that, he ushered them abruptly out of his office.</p>
<p>“We?” said Ron in a puzzled voice to the closed door.</p>
<p>Realizing that their interview with the Headmaster was decidedly over, Harry and Ron raced each other down to the portrait that guarded the kitchens and tickled the pear. As they climbed through the hole, a small, Dobby-shaped blur tackled Harry. The diminutive house-elf was overjoyed to perform a service for “Harry Potter Sir,” and followed them happily back up to the Gryffindor Fifth Year Boy’s dorm.</p>
<p>“Passway is here, sirs,” Dobby said, patting the wall beside on of the recessed windows. “Password is ‘Klinglt.’”</p>
<p>“Klinglt?” asked Ron puzzledly.</p>
<p>“Is in House-elf language. Klinglt means ‘open.’”</p>
<p>“Can I change the password?” Harry was unsure that he would be able to pronounce the odd word, let alone remember it.</p>
<p>“Of course, Harry Potter Sir. It is easy. From inside, tell the wall to remember new password. Klinglt,” he said clearly to the blank wall. It folded back cleanly and silently into a neat stone arch surrounding a wooden door. Entering the door, Ron described to Harry what he saw, a low, narrow hall of intermediate length which forked about ten feet before a second door, this one inscribed with a radiant Gryffindor Lion.</p>
<p>“That way is leading to the kitchen, sirs,” said Dobby, plucking at Ron’s sleeve and pointing down the fork. They passed it by and opened the second door. Beyond it was large, empty chamber, long and narrow, with three windows along its length. After Ron had described it to him, Harry smiled.</p>
<p>“This is perfect,” he announced. “Dobby, could you and some of your friends please move our stuff in here? Beds and everything?” Dobby nodded eagerly. “Great. Ron and I have to get to class.”</p>
<p>“We do?” asked Ron, checking his watch. “We do! Come on, Harry, we’re going to be late for Herbology!” He pushed Harry’s chair back out into the hall. “Hey! We can take a shortcut through the kitchens to the greenhouses!” He went down the second passage at a jog, pulling Harry behind him backwards. They burst into the kitchens, scattering house-elves as they ran out through the portrait. Harry sped past Ron as they flew up onto the grounds and up the hill to Greenhouse 4, where the rest of the class was assembling. They weren’t late, just barely.</p>
<p>Nothing eventful happened in Herbology, even though all the Gryffindors kept shooting glances at Harry, unsure of what he’d do next. He disappointed then all by listening politely, attentively to Professor Sprout talk about the properties of different kinds of fertilizer. After class, he, Ron, and Hermione returned to the Common Room, as classes were done for the day. The boys smuggled Hermione though the boy’s dorm to show her their new room, where the house-elves had done a great job. Tapestries decorated the walls, and the two poster beds stood at the far end, Harry’s directly under the third window. Their trunks were there, tucked neatly under the beds with their contents stowed away in a pair of bureaus and roll-top desks. To top it off, there were three fatly stuffed armchairs clustered around a lit fireplace.</p>
<p>“This is great!” exclaimed Ron, seeing it all. He described it rapidly to Harry, who had already begun to explore the room by touch.</p>
<p>“It is,” agreed Hermione. They had explained to her why they got their own room, and for once she utterly concurred with their logic. “I’m a bit jealous, actually. Not that you don’t deserve this, Harry, but you don’t have to share a room with Parvati and Lavender.”</p>
<p>“Ha!” laughed Harry smugly, running his hand over the velvet, red-and-gold coverlet. “I don’t envy you.”</p>
<p>The rest of the day proceeded without incident, Malfoy avoided the Gryffindor table at dinner, and so ended the first day of classes.</p>
<p>It wasn’t for three days that Harry ran into Breena. She’d been in classes, but he hadn’t had the opportunity to talk to her until she approached him at breakfast. “Hiya, Harry,” she chirped, tapping him on the shoulder. The shoulder she had tapped was the one away from her, but Harry swiveled to face her anyway.</p>
<p>“I am <em>smarter </em>than that,” he said.</p>
<p>“I’ll bet. Hey, did you catch yesterday’s notes in Transfig? I forgot to write it down, and I can’t remember diddly if I don’t write it down. Nope,” she said, audibly tapping her temple. “Can’t remember squat. Diddly squat!”</p>
<p>“OooooK...,” replied Harry, drawing back from her a foot. “Who had pepper-up potion for breakfast?”</p>
<p>“Not me,” she said laughing. “Coffee, and lots of it. It’s an American thing.”</p>
<p>“Must be. Anyway, you’ll have to ask Hermione for her notes. I didn’t take any. The homework, though, is to read pages 19-38 in <em>Advanced Transfiguration for Marginally Competent Wizards</em>, and don’t forget that quiz on Monday, turning a skunk cabbage into a skunk. Write it down, this time,” he finished, with only a hint of asperity to his voice.</p>
<p>“All right, all right.” Harry could hear Breena’s quill scratching as she used the back of his wheelchair as an impromptu desk. “Got it.”</p>
<p>“Are you going to Hogsmead tomorrow?” asked Harry, changing the subject.</p>
<p>“Are mermaids wet?” Her voice was mocking as she stated the obvious. “Is Peeves insane? Of course I’m going. You’re going with Ron and Hermione, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, them, and George and Fred, and Ginny. You should come, too. With us, I mean.” Harry found himself holding his breath as he waited for her answer and forced himself to relax.</p>
<p>“George and Fred? Oh, right, Ron’s brothers. Twins. They’re sixth years, aren’t they?”</p>
<p>“Seventh. They’ve got a year and a half on Ron. You’ll love them. Were you there yesterday when the Slytherin table flipped over?”</p>
<p>“That was them?” Breena practically shrieked. “Oh, God, I’ve never laughed so hard. Malfoy’s porridge slid straight down his robes. It was great!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, they’re like that,” Harry laughed. “So, you are coming with us?”</p>
<p>“Duh!”</p>
<p>“Excuse me?” Harry didn’t understand the not-quite-a-word.</p>
<p>“Yes. ‘Duh’ means yes, or sure. It’s another American thing.”</p>
<p>“Oh. Well, come on then. We’ve got to get to our first ever Defense against the Dark Arts lesson care of Severely Snapped Severus Snape.” Harry rolled back from the table.</p>
<p>“What’s he like? Everyone I’ve asked about him just looks at me pityingly. Is he that bad?” Breena actually sounded worried, and Harry didn’t blame her one bit. The first time he’d met Snape’s eyes, he’d been scared stiff. Of course, that was really because Lord Voldemort had been staring at him through Quirrell’s turban, setting his famous scar afire with pain, but that wasn’t the point.</p>
<p>“Nah, he’s not that bad. He just hates Gryffindors on principle, especially Gryffindor who are famous through no fault of their own. He’s head of Slytherin House, you see, and the only famous Slytherin is Vol, er, You-Know-Who,” Harry explained, raising his voice as he heard Malfoy and his thugs walk by behind him. “And Blaise, but Blaise is only famous here.”</p>
<p>“Why is that?”</p>
<p>“Haven’t you noticed? Nobody knows if he’s a he, or if she’s a she. Whichever, Blaise isn’t telling.”</p>
<p>“Well, that explains why he sits above Slytherin Table looking like he swallowed arsenic, doesn’t it?” Breena sounded relieved. “I think I can handle him.”</p>
<p>“You haven’t met him yet,” said Harry cryptically.</p>
<p><br/><br/>##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### #####<br/><br/>Chapter: 25<br/><br/></p>
<p>$ Hi. It’s another chapter! Two chapters in one week? I must be getting back to my old stamina. Hooray! Hooray for you, anyway. So, here’s Snape’s first DADA class.$</p>
<p>Chapter 25</p>
<p>Rolling into the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom felt to Harry like entering a dense fog. Snape’s presence today was a malevolent influence, vindictive, menacing and cold. The Head of Slytherin House was in a very good mood.</p>
<p>“Class,” he snarled by way of greeting. “Today, we shall review what little you have learned and <em>retained </em>over the past four years in this class. Having had the dubious pleasure of evaluating your progress in your third year, I am not optimistic. Now, who among you, <em>besides Miss Granger</em>, can tell me by which signs a lycanthrope may be recognized, and what a lycanthrope <em>is</em>?”</p>
<p>Snape continued to critically review the efforts of the previous Defense Against the Dark Arts teachers, patently unimpressed, if unsurprised with what he was finding. As his near-rant went on and on, Harry’s mind began to roam. He hadn’t thought about what had happened the night of his birthday for some time. What <em>had </em>happened? He supposed that he must have apparated, but how? No one had ever brought it up since that night. Mr. Weasley had seemed only mildly surprised, yet before, he had told Harry and Ron just how dangerous and difficult apparation was, even when you knew how to do it. Harry most certainly did not know how, not even the basics, so how had he done it? As Harry’s mind ran along these tracks, he became utterly unaware of what was occurring in the classroom until Snape’s hand came down heavily upon his shoulder, bringing him back to reality very abruptly.</p>
<p>“Mr. Potter, are you here today? I asked you if you knew what advantages a left-handed wizard has against the Dark Arts?” Snape’s voice was as contemptuous as ever, but Harry was unfazed. He and Severus had spent three days arguing this very point less than a month ago, and he had a ready answer.</p>
<p>“The left hand is connected to the right side of the brain, the inventive side. Therefore, magic done with that hand is more of an art than a science, and more powerful for it. After all, only a lefty is in his right mind.” He smiled sweetly and Snape’s snarl sounded more amused than exasperated. Behind him, Harry heard Hermione giggle.</p>
<p>After Defense Against the Dark Arts, as Harry was trading acerbic banter with Snape, Breena came up behind him, taking the handles to push his wheelchair. He let her, sensing that she wanted to talk to him, but she kept silent until they were well away from the classroom.</p>
<p>“Why are you and Professor Snape friends, Harry? He used to be a Death Eater, didn’t he?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, but Dumbledore trusts him, so I do too. He helped the Light against the Dark, back when You-Know-Who was rising before. He’s not a bad guy.”</p>
<p>“If you say so...” Her mood lightened almost instantly. “What do we have next?”</p>
<p>“<em>I</em> have a meeting with Professor Trelawney. <em>You</em> have a free period. Ask Ron and Hermione to introduce you to Hagrid. You’ll like him.” They parted ways at a back stair, Harry climbing towards Trelawney’s class, and Breena running outside to enjoy one of autumn’s nicest days.</p>
<p>Harry reflected more as he rolled slowly through the quiet halls. He didn’t much like being outside anymore, when he wasn’t on his broom, that is. Sound scattered out there, making it hard to monitor what was going on around him. In just over a month, his hearing had sharpened incredibly. Here, within the stone walls of Hogwarts, he felt a bit like a bat, using echoes to tell him where people and things were in his vicinity. It was those echoes that warned him, as he mounted the main stairs, of someone’s presence at the top of the flight. He wished that they could tell him who it was.</p>
<p>“Who’s there?” he called out inquiringly. When there was no answer, he backed up a little. The presence advanced, light footfalls ringing on the polished steps. Harry, understandably nervous now, pulled out his wand and was about to cast an identifying spell when the presence charged him. A robe-clad shoulder tackled into Harry’s chest, knocking his chair off its feet just as the stairs beneath them both began to move. He was reminded wryly of the Space Needle as he fell heavily on his side to the steps. The footsteps circled him, then stopped just in front of his face. Harry reached out his hand, but it was kicked aside as the unknown knelt beside him in a rustle of robes. He could hear it, smell it as it leaned very close.</p>
<p>“No matter how rich you are, <em>Potter</em>,” came Draco’s sneering voice, “you are still vulnerable. <em>Mortal</em>. My master will reward me richly for this.” With a stifled grunt of effort, he simply shoved Harry in his chair off the edge of the still-moving flight. Draco laughed quietly to himself as Harry disappeared from sight and the staircase slid home into its new landing.</p>
<p>Even as Harry began to fall, his mind was working rationally. He knew he couldn’t apparate to the ground this time, still didn’t know how he had ever apparated, but a solution came to him almost immediately. “<em>Accio Starstone</em>!” he shouted, not losing his words to the wind of falling. A brief whoosh heralded the arrival of his broomstick directly into his hand. He gripped it tightly, and an arm strengthened by rigorous therapeutic exercises with Madame Pomfrey was strong enough to stop his fall gently. he hung there a moment, still attached to his chair and hanging from the broom. he reflected on what an idiotic image he must present, but called for help anyway. “Someone? Help?” He wasn’t really panicked, although that surprised him.</p>
<p>“Harry!” It was Ginny’s voice, below him and to the right. “Harry, what are you doing?”</p>
<p>“Oh, I’m just hanging out,” he said, directing his broom to glide towards her. “Could you just keep talking so that I can get to where you are? I think my hand is starting to slip.”</p>
<p>With Ginny’s help, it wasn’t long at all ‘til Harry’s wheels touched down on the marble floor. “What happened, Harry?” she asked anxiously, checking to see that he was indeed alright.</p>
<p>“Draco pushed me,” he said soberly, hardly believing it himself. “Draco Malfoy pushed me. I need to talk to Dumbledore. Excuse me.” He left Ginny at high speed, reassuring her with a word as he sped towards the Headmaster’s office, back up the flights past which he had just fallen.</p>
<p>This time, Dumbledore was obviously not expecting Harry. When Harry reached the door at the top of the stairs, he heard the anxious voice of a boy beyond it, alternating with the Headmaster’s calmer tones. Not wanting to eavesdrop, Harry knocked lightly and the voices stopped. “Come in, Harry,” said Dumbledore. Harry rolled in, curious as to who else was there, but he had stopped speaking. “How was Defense Against the Dark Arts with Professor Snape?”</p>
<p>“What? Er, it was OK, but I need to talk to you about something else. Alone.” He could still hear a third person in the room, as well as a sound something like a slow fan. “Who else is here?” he asked, turning to face the unidentified sounds. Dumbledore chuckled.</p>
<p>“Harry, allow me to introduce Tristan McGinnis, one of your house’s fine young First Years. He was here to try and persuade me to allow him to bring his broom here to Hogwarts. he cited you as a precedent on this case. As Captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch Team, do you have an opinion?”</p>
<p>As always, Quidditch readily distracted Harry from anything. He really was turning into Wood. “You’re Tristan?” he addressed the sounds in the corner,</p>
<p>“Yes, Sir.” the boy’s voice was confident and light, and the fanning sound sped up slightly as he spoke up.</p>
<p>“You don’t need to call me Sir,” insisted Harry, and then curiousity overcame tact. “Do you really have wings?” His fingers twitched in desire to find out for himself, but he felt that would be rude.</p>
<p>“Yes, yes, I do. My Mum’s a faery, so I inherited them from her,” he explained, sounding as though he had done so a thousand times before.</p>
<p>Harry laughed. “I’ll see you at trials, then. Leave it to me to convince him.” Here, he jerked his thumb towards Dumbledore, eliciting a warm chuckle from that direction. “If you’re any good, I’ll make sure you’re on the team.”</p>
<p>“Thanks, Mr. Potter,” said Tristan, breathless with excitement now but still confident.</p>
<p>“Call me Harry,” said Harry as he stuck his hand out in the boy’s direction. “Just Harry.” He was pleased to note that the hand that shook his was calloused in the peculiar pattern particular to the dedicated Quidditch Player; smooth across the palm where it is protected by the obligatory dragon’s-hide gauntlet, but rough and wind-chapped across the fingers and at that one little gap between the straps at the joint of the thumb. With a jaunty “See you later, Harry,” the First Year was off.</p>
<p>“Now Harry,” said Dumbledore as Harry swung back to face him. “I believe you had something of a less sporting matter to discuss with me?”</p>
<p>“Oh, yes.” The import of why Harry was here returned to him. “I had an...an encounter on my way up to Professor Trelawney’s attic. It was Malfoy, sir. He pushed me off the stairs in the Grand Stairwell, Professor Dumbledore, and he told me, well, he <em>implied </em>that he was loyal to Voldemort. Sir, he tried to kill me!” The words all came out in a rush.</p>
<p>When Dumbledore spoke again, his voice was very grave. “Are you sure of this, Harry? I’m sure I don’t need to tell you that these are very serious accusations. Did anyone else see this?”</p>
<p>Harry knew that Dumbledore didn’t disbelieve him, but just the same he was uncomfortably reminded of Fudge’s disbelief at the ends of his Third and Fourth years. “I don’t think so,” he replied truthfully, “but Ginny Weasley saw me right afterwards.” To explain, he had to back up a little. “I knew I couldn’t apparate in Hogwarts, like I did that night at the Space Needle, so I summoned my Starstone and caught myself.” He grinned ruefully. “At least this time I could save myself, eh, Professor?”</p>
<p>“It seems so, Harry.” Dumbledore’s voice was regretful. “I will talk to the staff about this, Harry, and I’ll send you a note when we need you again. I have to convene the board to expel a student in a matter like this.”</p>
<p>“Expel?” Harry wasn’t sure he had heard right.</p>
<p>“Attempted murder, Harry. You’re already familiar with the maximum sentence, so why should expulsion surprise you? As for him being a Death Eater, to prove that we will have to overcome his father’s influence in the Ministry. That won’t be easy, Harry, and there will be a trial. No doubt about that.”</p>
<p>The trial of Draconis Lucian Malfoy took place the very next day, and it was a disaster. the Malfoys, of course, had already in their employ an entire tribe of the very best solicitors Britain had to offer, as well as, much less publicly, the judge and a fair percentage of the jury. Harry couldn’t prove it, but he knew it, and Draco’s near-complete exoneration galled him to the core. The boy was expelled, but that and a small monetary fine were to be the sole retribution. Nothing at all was said about the Death Eaters, and the entire incident was passed off as a fight between schoolboys.</p>

<p>$ Sorry this took so long. I’m working off the top of my head, and that’s a lot harder than when I’ve had it written for weeks and weeks and have only to revise it and type it up. Also, it‘s Ren fest, so I had some difficulty coordinating things with on of my betas. Go figure. But Siriusly, folks, here it is. $</p>
<p>Chapter 26</p>
<p>That evening, after the trial, Harry followed Draco around the castle as he said his goodbyes, staying about ten paces back no matter what the former Slytherin threw at him, verbal or otherwise. At one point, Ron and Hermione joined him, glaring bitterly at the blonde's unconcerned attitude.</p>
<p>“How does he get off trying to kill you, and then just transferring off to Durmstrang?” Ron’s voice was acerbic and loud enough for the Slytherin Table to hear, as they were currently in the Great Hall. Harry smiled grimly in response.</p>
<p>“He’s not transferring. That’s just what he’s telling everybody. To save face. He’s really. Been. Expelled!” His voice rose, so that he yelled the last word in Malfoy’s direction. Conversation there stopped. “You heard me, Malfoy. You’ve been expelled. Kicked out, wand snapped and everything. You’re just lucky that your daddy’s such a big shot with his Death Eater friends that Durmstrang’ll take you anyway.”</p>
<p>“Shut it, Potter,” shouted back Draco in a wearied voice. “At least I didn’t let a muggle cut me to bits and all but kill me.”</p>
<p>“Maybe not,” Harry retorted, “but you couldn’t even finish the job, could you? What reward will your laughable snake of a master give you now?”</p>
<p>Draco didn’t answer. He walked quickly out of the room, shoving brusquely past Harry and his friends. They followed him as a group, eventually winding up at the entrance to the Slytherin Common Room. Draco had given up trying to avoid Harry, but now, he just stood there, not doing anything or even moving.</p>
<p>“What, Malfoy?” taunted Harry. “Can’t remember the password? Try ‘Pureblood.’” At this, Draco jerked in surprise. Harry was pleased to have provoked a reaction, but he couldn’t see the defeated look on his face. No one saw the mad and treacherous glint in his hooded eyes.</p>
<p>“They’ve changed the passwords,” he said in a leaden voice. “I have to knock.”</p>
<p>Harry crowed in delight, joined enthusiastically by Ron. Hermione tried almost successfully to smother a smirk. “Not even a Slytherin anymore, Malfoy, are you? Not even they want a Death Eater in their ranks. We <em>all </em>want you to leave!” With this, he left the boy, laughing even harder when he heard a knocking on the door behind them.</p>
<p>“That was mean, Harry,” said Hermione, but her heart was not in her words, and she couldn’t keep her face straight.</p>
<p>“That was bloody awful,” joked Ron. “You’ve got an inner Slytherin, Harry. Don’t deny it.”</p>
<p>“Hey!” protested Harry. “I, er, uh, well, no, I can’t really deny it, can I? Not when I can still do <em>this</em>.” The last word came out as a gutturally sibilant hiss and his friends shuddered slightly. Parseltongue came more naturally to Harry now, although he didn’t use it often. None of them were very comfortable with it.</p>
<p>“True,” said Hermione. “Well, if you’re done teasing Draco, let’s head up to the Tower. It’s getting late, and Fred and George are getting us all up early to go to Hogsmead tomorrow. Do any of you know why?” Everyone shook their heads, but she continued nonetheless. “Harry, Breena told me that you invited her to come with us.” Her voice made it a question.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I did. Yesterday morning. I meant to tell you guys, but... It’s OK with you?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, sure, Harry. You can bring your giirlll friennnd.” Ron drew the word out and made kissing sounds. Without a word, Harry reversed his chair to roll a wheel directly over Ron’s overlarge left foot. “Ow!” he shouted. “You know, that chair of yours is a weapon, you great prat.”</p>
<p>“Ha.”</p>
<p>Early indeed the next morning, shouts of shock and fury emanated from the Fifth Year girl’s dorm, along with a tremendous splash. Harry, Ron, and Ginny, already dressed and waiting in the common room, only had time to be puzzled a moment before Fred and George raced past them in a state of gleeful panic, closely pursued by four furious, soaking wet teenaged girls. George, who was running backwards, wolf-whistled. “Isn’t this a great school, brothers?” he called to Ron and Harry as he circled the room only a few paces ahead of the murderous girls. “Wet tee-shirt contests at five in the morning Alp!” Breena and Lavender caught up to him, and they tackled him and held him to the floor as Parvati did the same to Fred. Hermione advanced menacingly, wand drawn. Ron, when he could draw a breath between gales of laughter, was describing the entire scene as rapidly as he could to Harry.</p>
<p>“Expelliarmus!” she cried through gritted teeth. They tried in vain to hold onto their wands, but she caught them neatly. She shot a shrewd glance to the other girls, and they all grinned toothily. “Rekoppirts!”</p>
<p>Fred and George fell over as their clothes removed themselves, leaving them only in their boxers just as the rest of the Gryffindors, woken and attracted by the commotion, piled into the common room. They blushed simultaneously as red as their hair, but quickly recovered their <em>sang froid </em>enough to wink at the girls of all years. “Good morning all!” and they whisked off up the stairs.</p>
<p>Not much later, for Harry’s new, talking watch had not yet told him that it was 5:30, the seven of them were strolling down the road to Hogsmead. No one else was out, but why they had to be out so early, the twins would not say. They just kept pushing every one to go faster.</p>
<p>“Come on, Fred, let’s slow down,” complained Ginny, out of breath. “What’s sp important about being there early anyway?”</p>
<p>Fred looked at George. George looked at Fred. “Should we?” he asked cryptically.</p>
<p>“We should,” responded Fred enigmatically, and then they turned to the others, alternating rapidly as they began to speak.</p>
<p>“Last summer,”</p>
<p>“We pitched some of our Wheezes ideas,”</p>
<p>“To Zonko’s.”</p>
<p>“Xavier Zonker Zonko himself wrote us,”</p>
<p>“A letter.”</p>
<p>“A very long,”</p>
<p>“Very enthusiastic,”</p>
<p>“Letter.”</p>
<p>“He wants us,”</p>
<p>“To work for him!”</p>
<p>“On weekends”</p>
<p>“It’s OK with Dumbledore,”</p>
<p>“As long as we keep our grades up,”</p>
<p>“So we’re on our way to our very first ever day of work.”</p>
<p>“Of paid work, anyway.”</p>
<p>“And we don’t want to be late,”</p>
<p>“And we wanted you guys,”</p>
<p>“Here to cheer us on!”</p>
<p>Ron, Ginny, and Hermione just stared at them, something akin to terror on their faces. Breena just looked wary, and Harry put his face into his hand, shaking his head. “Oh no,” he moaned aloud. “It’s the end of the world as we know it! You two, getting paid to prank? Kill me now!”</p>
<p>“Ha ha,” said Fred drolly. “We’re not getting paid to prank.”</p>
<p>“Just to invent them,” piped in George.</p>
<p>“This is serious work.”</p>
<p>“Of course, they will all need tested...”</p>
<p>“But not on you.”</p>
<p>“No, would we ever prank on you?”</p>
<p>“See, we’re not supposed to test them ourselves.”</p>
<p>“Our judgments might be a little...”</p>
<p>“Just a smidgen.”</p>
<p>“A little biased.”</p>
<p>“Corrupted, you might even say.”</p>
<p>“So we need some testers.”</p>
<p>“Some volunteers.”</p>
<p>“Count me in,” said Ron immediately, his voice enthusiastic.</p>
<p>“Me too,” chimed in Ginny.</p>
<p>“Me three,” said Breena, grinning hugely.</p>
<p>“You’ll have to count me out,” said Harry with more than a little regret. “I can hardly report accurately on the results, can I?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, you’re right, I suppose,” said Fred thoughtfully, “but we’ll give you loads and loads of samples anyway. You are our chief investor, after all. Hermione, about you? Willing to throw in your lot with us collaborators?” He hung his arms over Ron, Ginny, Breena, and George, and smirked wildly at her, trying successfully to look like an outlaw.</p>
<p>“No, I’d better not,” she said with a sigh. “I’d get caught in an instant. Can’t keep a straight face to save my life, or anybody else’s.”</p>
<p>“You, Herm-ee-own? I thought you were the Queen of Jesters.” Ron’s voice was sarcastically affectionate, and he pulled her close in a one-armed hug. “Don’t you worry, ‘Mione. I would never pull any on you.” Behind her back, he tapped Harry with his free hand. Touching it, Harry had to stifle a laugh as he traced this friend’s crossed fingers.</p>
<p>Fred and George led the group around to a door in the back of the infamous magical joke shop. George knocked, a deliberate rat tat ratatat knock that sounded an awful lot like a prearranged code. A moment later, they all herd the bolts being drawn and the door opened. The man standing there looked at them all suspiciously.</p>
<p>“What are they doing here, Weasley?” he asked in a suspicious voice, not distinguishing at all between the twins. Harry suspected that he wasn’t able to. “How can you be sure they’re not spies for Jeegan’s?”</p>
<p>“What is Jeegan’s?” blurted out Harry. He had never heard the name. Fred made a noise of disgust.</p>
<p>“Jeegan’s is Zonko’s biggest competitor, Harry. They’re based in America, but they have shops <em>everywhere</em>.” He sounded a trifle scornful. “Their jokes are plebian, mass-produced things, though. Nowhere near Zonko’s quality. They even use <em>plastic.</em>” Coming from his mouth, the muggle word sounded like an obscenity. “They say it holds magic as well as anything else, but we know better, don’t we, George?” He nudged his brother, who nodded fervently.</p>
<p>“How could it?” agreed George. “It’s so... so... <em>plastic</em>!” Fred snorted and shoved his brother at this bad joke.</p>
<p>“Anyway, we’ve tried it. It just doesn’t hold magic to our high standards. Or to Zonko’s,” he added, sketching a vague bow to the man in the door. “Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and Breena, please allow me the great honour of introducing the King of Craziness,”</p>
<p>“The Pasha of Pranks,”</p>
<p>“The Ultimate Ruler of Insanity,”</p>
<p>“And our new boss.”</p>
<p>Fred leaned in to whisper an aside to Harry and Ron. “As well as so paranoid that Mad Eye Moody looks laid back.”</p>
<p>“Wow,” Harry whispered back, seriously impressed. To meet anyone more paranoid than Moody, the real Moody or the fake, was such an impossibility that it was almost an honour. Unfortunately, the subject of their discussion heard the brief exchange.</p>
<p>“In this business, boys, it pays to be a bit paranoid. If your ideas are just left around for anyone to find, you go out of business. Basic rule of a game like this.”</p>
<p>“How true,” said George in a respectful voice. “And that’s why you’re the top in this highly competitive field.”</p>
<p>“Enough with the flattery, boys,” grumbled Zonko, but there was amusement in his voice. Well, if you’re sure about this lot, I guess you can all come in. Don’t touch anything,” he warned sternly. “It might explode.” Remembering the twin’s room back at the Burrow, Harry thought that this was a very sensible precaution. He had almost lost his other thumb exploring in there by touch. The industry of prank-making was apparently a very hazardous profession, but more for the bystander than the prank-maker.</p>
<p>The twins were going to share a workshop in the surprising vast complex that was behind the rather inconspicuous little store. There were three other inventors there, as well as Zonko, and they all seemed a friendly lot, if a little possessive of their ideas. Territorial, too. Aside from them, though, only two other workers were to be seen. It seemed that the fewer people who had to be trusted, the better. Though they tried, they couldn’t manage to wrangle their way into any of the other workshops, and the door that led to Zonko’s studio was bolted, barred, and generally locked down tight. But Fred and George’s workshop was interesting enough to make up for it. Even though today was to be their first day of work, the small laboratory-like room was awash in things that half the Gryffindor House would kill to be able to slip into the Slytherin Common Room or onto the Slytherin table. Harry’s fingers twitched to get at some of the things that Ron breathlessly described to him. There were liqufious bombs, which were what the twins had used on the girl’s dorm that morning, and there were flowers to be worn on the lapel that shot a goo which, when you tried to wipe it off, squirted you with another color of goo. There was a mirror that showed you that you were bald, and as long as you were looking into it, you were. It was a very novel feeling, Harry thought as he rubbed his bare scalp. Apparently, even though he couldn’t see the mirror, it worked on whatever was in front of it.</p>
<p>They poked around a bit longer, but it was obvious that Fred and George were itching to get to work. Before too long, then, the non-employed parts of the group were on their way out to the rest of Hogsmead. All of them, particularly Harry, were planning to enjoy this day.</p>
<p>$ That was the promised update. It may be late, but it’s here now, so don't throw things at me, especially you, Kim. No squeaky hammers. I am going to acknowledge my reviewers again!!! And I had better not forget my live-in BETA, Comechatcha. If I do, she’ll parody me hopelessly in one of her many, wonderful* Sailor Moon fics. $</p>

<p>You get the award for my most useless review ever. Here it is in its entirety; Right more.</p>
<p>Laterose-</p>
<p>Very glad to have you back. Coffee and 'Duh' are American things because the Encyclopedia Britannica says so. Or I do, I can't tell the difference anymore.</p>
<p>Sorry I'm not fast anymore.</p>
<p>Glad you like the broom. So do I. As it's mine.</p>
<p>They do have coffee, but the every-morning addiction to coffee is an American thing.</p>
<p>“Duh” is an American thing. I used it on my neighbor’s British exchange student a couple years ago, (OK, so it was a whole decade ago,) and she didn’t know what it meant.</p>
<p>I know I’m brilliant, but be sure to keep telling me.</p>
<p>Traveler-</p>
<p>Hee hee hee. Traveler called this an adult fanfic. Wow. Anyway, glad you like it and I am meaner, aren't I?</p>
<p>Callas-and-Ivy-</p>
<p>My favorite BETA, because she lets me keep her up all night on IM talking about inconsequential things with which to change the world. She writes good HP stuff and better original. Go and read Unspeakable, on Fictionpress, but be warned. She's as mean to her toys as I am. Almost. She is a Slytherin, after all. (She's going to hate me in the next chapter.) Btw, Callas, Chibi eyes?</p>
<p>I like to think that I am good at images.</p>
<p>Heeee'ssss aaaaa Liiiivvveeeee. For now.</p>
<p>Of course Snape's a lefty. Is anyone of a more sinister persuasion than good old Severely Snapped?</p>
<p>You would not believe how much work I put into the Weasleys. I’ll send you the whole bloody family tree if you want it?</p>
<p>No. He has not been through enough, as you should know, since you know <em>me</em>.</p>
<p>Also, since you know me, you should know that I can never get enough reviews. Neither can you. <b><em>Hey Everyone! Go and read Callas-and-Ivy’s stuff! She’s amazing! </em></b>Ahem. I know I’m doing marvelously. The voices in my head tell me so.</p>
<p>Once again, thank you from the bottom of the heart that I don’t have for agreeing to be my BETA.</p>

<p>What would Harry be without Quidditch?</p>
<p>I can make you go over the edge, what’s so hard about Harry?</p>
<p>JessicaKou-</p>
<p>You just wait until I write the Quidditch Trials. You are going to scream!</p>
<p>Everyone has poor Severus having to take Harry shopping, so I thought I’d try something different.</p>
<p>Sorry. No mad muggle scientist for you.</p>

<p>So glad you’ve been to Tall Ships! Isn’t it awesome? However, the one here on the Pacific Side is a little bit different from your East Coast version. Bigger ocean = More ships.</p>

<p>Chapter 27</p>
<p>An anonymous minion of Zonko’s escorted the five out through a door, which, when they turned back, had vanished into a brick wall. The effect was obviously lost on Harry, who, trailing his fingers across the facade, easily found the lines of the concealed door. They all laughed, and headed out into the main thoroughfare of Hogsmead Village. It was a hot, sunny day, exceptionally so for the middle of September, but it was still too early for the rest of the students. A few witches were out, doing their shopping and glancing curiously at the five teenagers who kept bursting into bouts of unexplained laughter.</p>
<p>“You know,” said Harry, “It’s too bad that Draco got himself expelled, isn’t it? Who am I supposed to try these pranks on?” He patted the unmarked bag, full to bursting, which hung from the side of his wheelchair. Fred and George had been generous with their samples. “At least Crabbe and Goyle are still here, even if they are too stupid to make it much of a challenge.”</p>
<p>Ron laughed. “Well, getting him expelled was worth losing a target. And anyway.” He peered into his own bag. “Some of these are too dangerous even for him, little guy that he is. We might try them on Peeves...” He sounded amused by this, but not terribly thrilled. Breena snorted.</p>
<p>“Oh sure. Play pranks on a poltergeist. That’s going to work real well.”</p>
<p>“She speaks!” Ron jumped in mock surprise. “Sorry, Breena. I’d almost forgotten you were there, you’ve been so quiet. It’s not like you.”</p>
<p>“Ha. Ha,” she said sardonically, clearly not amused. “For your information, thanks to your brothers, I haven’t had any coffee yet. I’m going to continue being an ass until I get some.”</p>
<p>“Uh oh,” said a grinning Harry. “We’d better find her some coffee, then, and quick. Is the Three Broomsticks open this early?” It was not yet 7:30.</p>
<p>“No,” said Hermione, spying the sign. “It doesn’t open ‘til eleven.”</p>
<p>“I smell coffee!” cut in Breena. “And better than coffee. It’s a white chocolate mocha!”</p>
<p>“A what?” Ron sounded clueless, but Breena was off, sprinting full throttle down a nearby side street. With less than a moment’s hesitation, the group ran after her, calling for her to wait up. They spotted her only a few blocks down, where she was politely interrogating a witch holding a steaming paper goblet. The witch, smiling indulgently, pointed her down th next-to-nearest alley. The group caught up with her there, where she was standing laughing hysterically, at the top of a set of steps that led to a dark basement landing. A cracked, dirty sign read “Starbucks.”</p>
<p>“A Starbucks? Here?” Words emerged from Breena’s hilarity. Harry was as shocked as she was. Hogsmead was supposed to be an all-magical community. Starbucks and its popularity had occupied Hermione’s Muggle Studies homework for an entire week back in their third year, as she whispered to Harry and Ron now.</p>
<p>Trooping down the stairs, the door that confronted them was scarred, stained, and locked, with only a tiny, shuttered, spy-hole of a window. Breena, her face set in determined lines, raised her hand and knocked firmly. Ron, Hermione, and Ginny glanced nervously at one another, and Harry was as perplexed as they. Beyond the door, footsteps echoed across a wooden floor. The tiny window slid open.</p>
<p>“Who is it?” rasped a suspicious voice. A single, penetrating eye roved over the group of five, piercingly examining each of them. As usual, the eye did a double take when it came to the boy in the wheelchair. The spy-hole slid shut a moment before the door swung wide, and the suddenly amiable voice was revealed to belong to a middle-aged witch in mostly muggle clothing and an attractive, softly-lit lounge. “Harry Potter!” she exclaimed, ushering them all inside. “Welcome, all of you”</p>
<p>Suddenly, inexplicable, Hermione burst into a fit of giggles. “What?” asked Harry, swiveling to face her. “What’s so funny?”</p>
<p>“It’s a speakeasy,” Hermione giggled. “It’s a coffee-house speakeasy.”</p>
<p>“Aye, that it is,” agreed the woman.</p>
<p>“A what?” Ron was clueless again. Hermione turned to him, and turned into an encyclopedia.</p>
<p>“A speakeasy, historically, is an underground or illegal pub. They originated in the 1930s, in the United States, during the short-lived American Prohibition, when alcohol was made illegal. For the most part, the law was ignored, but not openly, so there were the semi-secret speakeasies, which either hid themselves or bribed the local authorities to look the other way. Which is this?” she asked the proprietress, who was staring at Harry as he explored the cafe by touch.</p>
<p>“A little of both, actually. Certain members of the Magical Law Enforcement are friends of mine, either friends or customers, and they try to keep the... less tolerant officers away.”</p>
<p>“Why is such secrecy necessary at all?” asked Ginny curiously. “Coffee isn’t illegal.”</p>
<p>“No, no it’s not, but muggle franchises aren’t allowed in Hogsmead. Zoning laws, you know.” Her voice was lightheartedly contemptuous and struck a thought in Harry. From his current spot where he was running an observing hand over the labels of a display case full of croissants and biscotti, he spoke up.</p>
<p>“You were a Slytherin, weren’t you?” She certainly sounded like one, ambitious and sly, but she just laughed him off.</p>
<p>“No. I’m flattered, but I’m afraid I’m nothing but a muggle. That’s the other reason this is an underground operation. In a pure-blood town like this, a wandless-wonder like me should stay as low-key as possible. I used to be married to a wizard, and my son’ll go to Hogwarts, so they tolerate me, but...” She shrugged eloquently. “So I sell bootleg espresso and biscotti. It’s a funny way to make a living, really.”</p>
<p>“It is,” agreed Harry. “So, do you take Pounds or Galleons?”</p>
<p>Half an hour later, when they came out of the speakeasy, they knew that the proprietress’ name was Samara Ziechrist, and that, to Breena’s intense delight, she was more than willing to deliver through the house-elves. “Nothing against the school’s coffee,” Breena said, back to her bouncy self after 2 mochas and a yogachino, “But nothing, absolutely nothing compares to a white-chocolate yogachino first thing in the AM.”</p>
<p>“I’ll have to take your word for it,” laughed Harry. Breena was immediately contrite.</p>
<p>“Oh, I’m sorry, Harry. I am such an idiot. I totally forgot that you can’t eat anything. I didn’t mean anything by it, I just love this stuff.”</p>
<p>“It’s OK,” soothed Harry. “I’m not offended at all. It’s not your fault that I can’t have any of that stuff, so I don’t mind. Really.”</p>
<p>The next stop on their non-existent itinerary was, at Hermione’s insistence, the Hogsmead Public Library. Harry opted to stay there with her as the rest, quickly bored, wandered off to refill their sugar stashes at Honeydukes. He had never been here before, and it fascinated him. The Head Librarian, one Mr. Martinette, was only too happy to show him a simple charm with which to bespell books to read themselves aloud. Surprisingly, the reclusive bookworm didn’t recognize Harry for the Boy-Who-Lived and only showed a researcher’s mild curiousity when Hermione, who was a regular there, introduced them.</p>
<p>“Oh really?” he had said in a mildly interested voice, pushing his glasses up his nose. “Have you ever thought of writing an autobiography?” And then he had gone on to tell them about other biographies he had in his stacks, including a hand-written one by Headmaster Rudolph Dippet, written 6 years after the man’s death. Harry politely declined an offer to “see” this, instead letting Hermione show him the comprehensive section they had of muggle literature. At his birthday party with the Weasleys, he had recieved a book, <em>A Study in Scarlet</em>,” by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. According to Hermione, it was only the first of nearly sixty stories about the Great Detective, and Harry was anxious to read the rest. Ron had briefly teased him about his new bookishness, but he didn’t mean it, and Harry didn’t mind. There was no way Ron could know how boring it was to be blind.</p>
<p>When Ron, Ginny, and Breena came back, sticky-fingered, sticky-faced, and grinning, Harry had a new library card and was checking out a sizable stack of books. “Planning a transfer to Ravenclaw?” Ron asked around a mouthful of Drooble’s Best Chewing Gum. Everyone just laughed it off.</p>
<p>The rest of the day was spent pleasurably in the various shops of Hogsmead’s high street. Their last stop, not long before dusk, was the pet store, Higgin’s Crawling Shoppe. Harry bought a bag of owl treats for Hedwig, even though the snowy owl had become more Ron’s than his over the summer, and Hermione bought a catnip mouse for Crookshanks that scurried about, squeaked, and smelt strongly of chamomile. When Harry noticed that Breena had gone quiet again, he asked her what was wrong. She didn’t answer. With Ron and Ginny’s help, Harry found her a moment later, deep in the recesses of the shop, coddling the smallest of a litter of seven kittens. “Isn’t she precious?” she cooed to Harry, dropping the small beast in Harry’s lap and guiding his hand to it. Harry had never, not once in his life, pet a kitten. Mrs. Figg’s cats were all grown, with slightly sticky, ragged coats. This kitten's fur was just slightly long, and so fine that it clung to Harry’s fingers as he drew them through it. His fingertips had, by now, become so sensitive in lieu of sight, that he could feel the infinitesimal variations of temperature and texture telling him that this cat was a Siamese. The darker points were just that much more densely furred, that much warmer than the rest. Ron’s patronizing description confirmed it and Harry learned that the handsome pattern was accompanied by a pair of crossed, strikingly blue eyes. The kitten arched her cheek confidently against Harry’s knuckle, and he was lost.</p>
<p>“No fair,” laughed Breena as he rolled up to the front counter. “I saw her first.”</p>
<p>“Yeah?” smirked Harry, “But she likes me better. If you want one, pick one of the others. I’ll buy it for you.”</p>
<p>Ron snorted and elbowed Harry. “You know, Harry, most people buy candy and flowers for their girlfriends before they jump to small, fuzzy animals.” he teased. Breena blushed, ducked her head, and play-punched Ron in the gut.</p>
<p>“I’m not his girlfriend,” she said. “Harry’s just a nice guy, right? Plus, he’s rich enough to buy us all cats.”</p>
<p>“That’s good idea,” said Harry thoughtfully. “Anybody else want a kitten?”</p>
<p>In the end, they all took him up on it, except for Hermione, who already had Crookshanks. Ron was still teasing Harry as they left, although he kept getting distracted by his new cat, a yawning little scrap of brilliant orange fur. Ginny’s was the same, except for a white spot on the inside of one of its forelegs, and Breena had chosen a pure white moggy with a nose pinker than anything that should be found in nature. Breena named hers Jennifer right off, because of that white coat, and Harry named his Mystoffelees, but Ron and Ginny chose to wait. “A name should come from a personality,” explained Ginny. “Like Pigwidgen.”</p>
<p>“I thought you chose Pigwidgen because it was cute,” laughed Harry.</p>
<p>“Yeah, well, Pigwidgen’s personality was cute.” Ginny’s voice was defensive, but not overly so.</p>
<p>“No,” corrected Ron. “His personality is annoying, hyperactive, and altogether irritating.”</p>
<p>“No disagreement here,” said Harry, grinning. “That little tennis-ball with feathers almost knocked the Snitch out of my fingers when I was practicing last night. His voice is as high as the Snitch’s.”</p>
<p>“I’ve been meaning to ask you, Harry,” said Ron suddenly. “How do you play Quidditch without being able to see? Watching you on your broom, no one can tell that you’re blind.”</p>
<p>“Thanks,” said Harry. “I’m flattered, but there’s still no way I’m going to tell you. That’s my little secret, until you figure it out yourself.” He smiled smugly. Ron had been trying to get him to tell that secret since his little demonstration at the Sorting, but Harry steadfastly had refused, dropping only the barest of hints. Ron would find out when the whole team did, which would be when one of them figured it out for themselves. Harry hoped to make them more observant. To tell the truth, Harry was nervous about the Quidditch tryouts, which were scant days away. He had worked something out, but he still wasn’t sure that it would work. He could only hope that he wouldn’t make a fool of himself.</p>

<p>Chapter 28</p>
<p>The next Saturday dawned nasty and wet. Autumn had truly set in now. Harry and the rest of the incumbent Quidditch team were standing on the Quidditch Pitch. Harry, of course, wasn’t standing <em>per say</em>, rather, he was floating on his Starstone. Present was himself, Fred and George, and Angelina Johnson. Alicia Spinnet and Katie Bell had graduated the year before, and Oliver Wood, of course, the year before that, so there were three positions to be filled that day. Two Chasers and a Keeper, and Harry also wanted to find a full complement of reserve players. Wood, he felt, had relied too heavily on his first string players, leading to more than one unnecessary loss. It was not a mistake that Harry intended to make as Captain.</p>
<p>Standing in front of Harry, in a neat, sniffling line, were 17 hopefuls, first years through seventh, each with a broom in hand. Tristan, the winged half-faery, was the only first year. Harry had succeeded in pleading his case with Professor McGonagall, knowing full well that the Gryffindor Quidditch Team was a weak point with her. Aside from him, the line-up held Ron, Dean, Breena, both the Creevey Brothers, and a load of other Gryffindors, all as nervous as could be expected. Harry smiled to hear them shifting uneasily, feet squelching in the rain-soaked grass.</p>
<p>At precisely 8:00, Harry broke the silence. “As all of you know, there are three empty positions on the team this year. Two Chasers, one Keeper. I also want to form a reserve team, with at least one alternate for every position. So there are, in fact, up to ten positions to be awarded. With seventeen of you, that means that you each have better-than-even odds of joining the team. Now, I’ve seen most of you fly in the past, and I know you all can, but today I want to see you at your best. Well, I won’t exactly “see” you,” he said with a self-deprecating laugh, “but I will be observing you in my own way. My teammates will be watching as well, each looking for specific things. Fred Weasley, Beater, will be watching the candidates for Keeper, and George will be watching those for reserve Beaters and Seekers. Angelina Johnson will watch those of you who are going for Chaser. I will be supervising the whole thing from the middle of the pitch.” He raised his wand and called out the spell the McGonagall had taught him the week before. “<em>Seterebreveremoda</em>!” Suddenly, the rain stopped. All present could see it falling outside the perimeter of the pitch and above them, but an invisible dome interceded before it could reach them.</p>
<p>“Cool, Harry,” said an amused Ron.</p>
<p>“Thanks, Ron. Now, I know I should be finding out how well you can fly in any weather, but there’ll be plenty of time for that. This is Scotland, after all.” The pointed comment drew a round of chuckles, and the mood relaxed distinctly. “So. We have enough here, so what I’m going to do is split you into two teams, and you’ll play a mock game. Angelina, could you split them up for me?”</p>
<p>The numbers turned out to be almost perfect with one extra Chaser to each side and an extra Keeper who they would rotate in at some point. Harry floated slowly upwards while Fred, Angelina, and George made sure that everyone knew what the rules were and assigning them their positions. He positioned himself squarely, precisely, in the center of the pitch, at the very apex of the dome. He pulled from the neck of his robes a tiny silver whistle, and blew on it. One infinitesimal, long, delicate note issued, one that echoed and multiplied all over the pitch, reverberating off the dome like the inside of a bell. Those on the ground couldn’t hear it at all, but it blazed through Harry’s mind, his sensitized ears drawing a detailed map of his surroundings, showing him everything, so long as he concentrated. The other students, just mounting their brooms below him, echoed each their own pitch, slightly softer tones than that of stands, turf, and hoops. Harry smiled. This was really going to work as well as he and McGonagall had hoped.</p>
<p>Almost immediately after his return from Hogsmead one week ago, Harry had gone to the Head of Gryffindor House with his plan. It’s conception had occupied his consciousness ever since he was appointed as Team Captain, and he was glad that he had come up with something.</p>
<p>Sound was the key, as it always was for the blind. In the teacher’s game, that morning before the Feast, he had followed the sound of the snitch and avoided the sounds of the bludgers. It had been simple. But, as Team Captain, he had to be able to “see” everything that was happening on the field. So he had come up with the dome and whistle. The dome was an immense, glass-like arc of magic, meant specifically to reflect sound without distorting it. The whistle was an invention of Harry’s own. Its sound lasted until he cancelled it with a sour note, and the sound was very reactive, echoing differently from every type of surface. A charm from Professor Flitwick had sensitized Harry’s ears incredibly, sharpening them to a point of almost painful acuity. It was a new sense, beyond simple hearing, and it had taken some getting used to. Fortunately, it could be turned off with a simple “Finite Incantatum,” even if he did feel rather head-numb for a while afterwards.</p>
<p>Below him, the game started. It was evident right away that Tristan was definitely worth bending the same rules that had gotten Harry onto the team. He stayed on his broom for exactly the required minute before abandoning it to race across the field, wings beating so fast that Harry could only “see” their outlines. He was by far the fastest of the Chaser-hopefuls on the field, and he scored the first three goals of the game. Ron served as the Keeper for the opposing team, and he was as good as Fred and George had bragged. He had grown over the summer, and was nearly six feet tall now, which gave him an impressive reach. Only Tristan could score against him at all.</p>
<p>The only person on the pitch faster than Tristan was tiny Dennis Creevey, who was trying out for Reserve Seeker. He clung to his ancient Silver Arrow Broomstick like a limpet, urging it to exceptional speeds as he narrowly avoided stray bludgers and teammates. He caromed around the pitch, following a course seemingly laid out by chance, but he caught the Snitch again and again, sometimes mere moments after it was released.</p>
<p>Harry, who at this point was lying on his back on his broom, head resting comfortably on its brush, smiled. He twitched his shoulders to cause the broom’s harness to sit him up, and dropped down to tap the other Seeker-hopeful, a third year named Terry Brock, to sit out. Everyone stopped what they were doing to watch as Harry and Dennis faced off. Smirking, Fred released the Snitch. They gave it a moment’s head start, and then they were off.</p>
<p>Dennis actually spotted the Snitch before Harry heard it, but the difference was less than the space of a heartbeat. In tandem, they bolted around the pitch, Dennis matching Harry’s every move. In the end, Harry caught the snitch, but only because Dennis deferred to him rather than slamming against him as he would have to against an opponent.</p>
<p>“You’ll have to work on that,” Harry told him when they, and everyone else, were back on the ground. “But you’ve done great. All of you,” Harry said, raising his voice to the crowd around him. “You’ve all done well. My decisions will be posted in the Common Room by 3:00, Tuesday afternoon. You’ve all flown great today, and even if you aren’t chosen, you have nothing to be ashamed of. Thank you for coming this morning, and I’ll see you all around.” Turning away to head back to the castle, he let the hopefuls overhear his comment to Fred, George, and Angelina. “We’re going to have an <em>incredible </em>team this year!” He grinned to hear them raise a joyous cheer.</p>
<p>“I still don’t get how you do it, Harry,” said Ron later, around a mouthful of cheese sandwich. They were eating lunch in the crowded Great Hall. “When I wasn’t playing, I was watching you up there, and you didn’t look like you were paying attention at all. You just looked asleep, but then when you went one on one with Creevey, well, it’s like I said before. No one would believe you were blind, if it weren’t for that blindfold. If anything, you’re better than... before.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, someone let out a loud exclamation from one of the neighboring tables. It cut through Harry’s ears like a blinding light and he winced away from it. Before Ron could ask what was wrong, Harry had tapped his ears with his wand and murmured “<em>finite incantatum</em>.” The room faded around him to a normal auditory level and he relaxed. Being able to hear every single sound was a questionable blessing in a room where that many people are eating and conversing.</p>
<p>Ron was clearly puzzled, but Harry turned the conversation away from there with a well-placed question about Ron’s new cat. The beast’s initial sleepiness and placidity had vanished almost immediately upon its arrival in the Gryffindor, where it had quickly developed a personality that made Ron name him, for the beast was a boy, Gred. Ginny, who had been having the same difficulties with hers, followed suit by naming hers, which was female, Feorge. Their erstwhile namesakes were appropriately flattered, professing paternal feelings for the mischeivious kittens. Perversely, the kittens detested Fred and George, adamantly refusing to be handled by them, even though, with anyone else, they begged for attention, twining through ankles and leaping into laps indiscriminately. Fred seemed a little hurt, but George just laughed it off.</p>
<p>“They just recognize the competition,” he had said one evening, holding a snarling, spitting Feorge. “But you’ve got to admire their force of personality. Ow!” He released the cat, who shot away up the stairs to the girl’s dormitories, and sucked on his bleeding finger. “Strike that. You’ve got to admire their razor sharp claws.”</p>
<p>“How’s Miss Myst?” asked Ron in return. The name had been shortened almost immediately, the honorific added due to the graceful kitten’s almost overdone air of dignity. She spent a fair amount of time at Harry’s left side within arm’s reach. She liked Harry, and ignored everyone else. When she wasn’t with Harry, she tended to reign in perfect aloofness from the canopy of Harry’s bed, surveying the territory below her with calm regard. Harry had fitted her with a bell so he could keep track of her, but she moved so softly, so smoothly that it rarely sounded.</p>
<p>“She’s herself,” Harry said. “Her Royal-Highness self. Did you hear her last night, meowing to get out?”</p>
<p>“Uh, no,” said Ron sheepishly. “Sorry.”</p>
<p>“For what?”</p>
<p>Early Tuesday afternoon, a crowd of Gryffindors followed Harry eagerly as he approached the Common Room bulletin board. Excited murmurings broke out as he displayed a roll of parchment, ceremonially handing it off to Gryffindor’s Head Girl, one Briary Lodge, who scanned it, nodded happily, and tacked it up. The crowd surged up, pressing forward as one to read the list.</p>
<p>Dean Thomas - Chaser</p>
<p>Tristan McGinnis - Chaser</p>
<p>Ronald Weasley - Keeper</p>
<p>Sally-Anne Perks - Reserve Chaser</p>
<p>Gregory Tall - Reserve Chaser</p>
<p>Colin Creevey - Reserve Chaser</p>
<p>Samuel Long - Reserve Keeper</p>
<p>Lee Jordan - Reserve Beater</p>
<p>Terry Thatch - Reserve Beater</p>
<p>Dennis Creevey - Reserve Seeker</p>
<p>Ron, seeing his name, let out a whoop and shoved through the press to embrace Harry, lifting him free of his chair in his exuberance. “Thank you thank you thank you thank you...” he kept repeating.</p>
<p>“Ron? Could you put me down?” Harry laughed. “Don’t thank me. You earned it. Only 6 goals scored off you in a two-hour game? That’s pretty good.”</p>
<p>The Creevey brothers were the next to accost him, though only Dennis dared hug him. Harry shook Colin’s hand warmly. “Welcome to the team.” Somewhere, he heard a camera click, but he pretended not to notice. After a while longer, he raised his hands and waited for the commotion to die down.</p>
<p>“To those who didn’t find there names on the list, I’m sorry. I only had 10 positions to fill, and I filled them all. I had to make a few very hard choices, but those choices have to stand. You all played very well at trials. I thank you for your efforts, and I hope you will all try out next year. After all, some of our team are seventh years, so there will be new openings.</p>
<p>“For those of you who did make it, congratulations. The first practice is tomorrow, immediately after dinner. I’ll see you all there.”</p>
<p>“You know, Harry,” remarked Angelina as crowd ebbed away. “You’re going to be a great diplomat someday.”</p>
<p>“Someday? I thought he already was,” added George, clapping Harry on the shoulder. “Great job, Harry.”</p>
<p>“Thanks.”</p>
<p>Fortunately, the following day was free of rain. It was cool, with hints of frost in the omnipresent wind, but there was no rain. For that first practice, Harry was early to the pitch. He had planned to set up his dome before hand, but someone was already there. He could hear running footsteps on the opposite side of the field.</p>
<p>Deciding that the other person was far enough away, Harry raised his wand. “<em>Seterebreveremoda</em>!” Soundlessly, the dome spread out once again across the field. “<em>Echolosquery</em>,” the spell to sharpen his hearing was next, but then he reached a quandary. He was still in his chair. He could get on his broom unaided, but it was an ungainly and graceless maneuver. Not something he wanted to do in front of an unknown spectator.</p>
<p>Suddenly, however, he recognized the sound that accompanied the running feet. It was Tristan, his wings outspread and whistling through the air as he ran. “Oy, Tristan,” Harry called out. The footsteps sped up briefly, and then Harry heard the other boy leap into the air. He landed a moment later by Harry’s side.</p>
<p>“Did you want something, Harry?” he asked. Harry nodded.</p>
<p>“I could use a hand, for just a moment. I just need you to hold me upright, so I can get on my broom. It’ll only take a moment.” With Tristan’s help, it did only take a moment. The boy was tall for an eleven year-old, and strong, so between him and Harry’s strong right arm, Harry was soon mounted on his broom. “Forget the chair,” he remarked. “I’m going to live on my broom.” They both laughed, and Harry sent his chair to wait by the team’s entrance. “So,” he started, a little embarrassed by the request he was about to make. “Your wings, er, can I, um, touch them? I just want to know what they look like, and that‘s the only way I can ‘see’ them.”</p>
<p>“Oh, sure.” Tristan didn’t sound at all offended. “Here.” He took Harry’s hand and guided it to a wing. “Just be careful of the feathers.”</p>
<p>“Feathers?” Harry was surprised. “I thought faeries had wings like a butterfly’s.” Tristan just laughed.</p>
<p>“I get that a lot,” he said. “That’s the little faeries, like pixies and fae. My mom’s one of the big ones, the Ys. We have hawk’s wings, because bug wings are simply too delicate for a man-sized person. Plus,” he said in a smug voice, “they would be far too delicate to play Quidditch. Anyway, you can touch them, but be careful, and don‘t rub them wrong. They only lay right in the one direction.” With Harry’s hand on the appendage, he stretched it and flexed it. “See, that’s what I was doing, running with them out behind me to align the feathers. I wear a cloak over my wings all day, just ‘cause people get too curious about them, and it messes them all up. They have to lie just right for me to fly my fastest, and running like that fixes it. It also builds up my stamina. Call it a warm-up.”</p>
<p>The feathers under Harry’s hand were fine, small feathers, the pinions, the largest, being only a handspan long. They all lay precisely in a smooth layer over the muscular wing. Harry could feel, when the wing flexed, the work of the muscles under the skin, and the adjustments made by each feather to accommodate its new position. The wing was a marvelous piece of living machinery.</p>
<p>“Sometime,” Harry mused aloud, “when I’m on my broom, it feels like I have wings. This harness pulls at my shoulders, and the tiniest adjustments send me in whole new directions. It really is an incredible feeling. I wish I had real wings.”</p>
<p>Before Tristan could respond, Ron hailed them loudly from the entrance. “Hey, Harry. What are we going to do today?” He was obviously excited about his first practice as part of the team. The rest of the team, including all of the reserves, arrived a moment later, and Harry officially began the practice.</p>
<p>After a few rudimentary drills, Harry set the players against each other in another mock-game, mixing reserve and prime team members on each side. He kept Dennis out, racing against him around and around the pitch, faster and faster until they were both ready to fall off their brooms. That was all they did for Seeker practice, but it was overall a very good practice. The fourteen of them were windswept, blue-lipped, and numb-fingered when they came in, but they were raucously happy, chattering of strategy and skill. Harry was doing well, so far. Time would tell. Their first match, against Hufflepuff, was but a month away. Time would indeed tell.</p>

<p>Chapter 29</p>
<p>The Monday after the tryouts, Dumbledore tapped his glass to gather the students’ attention. It was dinnertime, and with trials for all the house teams recently completed, the chatter that filled the room was mostly Quidditch-based. When it had quieted, Dumbledore spoke.</p>
<p>“At the start of term, I told you all that I would choose 8 new prefects. I have. Professor McGonagall shall read the list to you, and those whose names are called should come forth to recieve their badges.” Smiling, he sat down and McGonagall stood up.</p>
<p>“This year’s new prefects are as follows. For Ravenclaw, Terry Boot and Padma Patil. For Gryffindor, Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger. For Hufflepuff, Ernie Macmillan and Susan Bones. For Slytherin, Morag MacDougal and Blaise Zabini. Good luck to you all.”</p>
<p>The entire student body stood up and cheered as the eight new prefects filed up to the High Table to receive their shiny new silver Prefect’s Badges. Harry, laughing, had to give a stunned Ron a shove to make him follow Hermione, and then he cheered as loud as anyone else. Except, perhaps, for Parvati Patil, who cheered doubly hard for both the Gryffindor appointees and for her sister in Ravenclaw. Fred and George, of course, were the loudest of all.</p>
<p>“Yay, Ron!” yelled Fred, deafening those around him. George was even louder.</p>
<p>“Way to go!”</p>
<p>When Ron and Hermione returned to their seats, Harry clapped them each on the back. “Congratulations, guys,” he said, grinning broadly. “Always knew you would make Prefect, Hermione.”</p>
<p>Hey,” said Ron in mock-affront. “What about me?”</p>
<p>“You were a surprise.”</p>
<p>“Gee, thanks,” but the sarcasm was affectionate.</p>
<p>“You’re quite welcome. I don’t envy you at all, Ron. Now you have to deal with Quidditch <em>and </em>being a prefect.”</p>
<p>“Oh. Right.”</p>
<p>Those words were not a mere jibe. Harry understood only too well right now the occupation of responsibility. Practice five nights a week and four mornings, plus homework, left Harry little time for anything else. When he wasn’t playing Quidditch, he was thinking of it, or talking strategy with Angelina Johnson, his Second-in-Command. He let Hermione set up a schedule for him, for his homework, because, left to his own devices, he would let his studies slide in favor of the game. He knew, when he let her do that, that he had changed. That more than his body had changed since the last year.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until after classes the day after the roster was posted that Harry found a moment to talk to Breena alone. He finally caught her after Transfiguration.</p>
<p>“Breena, wait,” he called into the noisy hallway. A pair of footsteps faltered, and Harry orientated on them, catching her quickly. He caught at her sleeve to force her to stop, and pulled her aside, into the lee of a suit of armour. “Are you mad at me, Breena? You’ve been scarce since yesterday.”</p>
<p>He could feel the muscles in her arm tense, but she didn’t pull away. Her voice was controlled when she spoke. “I’m not mad at you, Harry, I’m mad at me. Quidditch... Quidditch is important to my dad. I wanted to make the team for him. For Cedric.” The last word was a whisper.</p>
<p>“Come here,” Harry said softly, pulling her gently towards him. She didn’t resist, collapsing carefully into his lap. They just sat there for a moment, him holding her, and then she took a deep breath, shook her head, and returned his embrace.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry about that, Harry,” she began to apologize.</p>
<p>“There’s nothing to be sorry about, Breena. Cedric was your brother. Nothing can ever replace him, no matter how hard you try. It’s ok that you aren’t him.” His voice was low, tinged with his own sorrow, but it got to her. She wiped her eyes and extricated herself from his chair.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Harry,” she said, the beginnings of a smile evident in her voice. “I have a study group now, but I’ll talk to you later, I promise.” She moved out into he crowd, and Harry turned away, only to be drawn back.</p>
<p>“Breena?” he called out. Her footsteps stopped, and spun to face him.</p>
<p>“Really, Harry,” she said lightly, a laugh in her voice, but it sounded forced, just the slightest bit. “You’ve known me long enough now to call me Bree. I‘ll see you later” As she hurried away, her footsteps rapidly losing themselves to the converging masses, Harry found himself clinging to their sound as long as he could, and wondering why he had such a foolish grin spread wide across his face.</p>
<p>The time before the match flew by in a welter of responsibilities. Harry tried to make time for Breena and his friends, but he couldn’t make nearly so much as he would like. He only made it down to Hogsmead with her once, and it wasn’t for very long.</p>
<p>About a week before the match, Harry arranged a one-on-one Seeker practice with Dennis. For the last several practices, he had charmed a spare Snitch to be three times as fast as it should be, figuring that, if the diminutive second year could catch it now, he would be well-equipped to catch the game Snitch, which would seem sluggish by comparison. The boy was good, there was no doubt of that, but it was because he was reckless with his safety. He just locked onto his target and sped towards it, ignoring obstacles such as teammates, opponents, or bludgers. Cho Chang was much the same way, Harry had realized. It was why he hadn’t encountered her in a match until his third year. Harry had plans for Dennis, and they did not include him confined to the bench by injuries all season. That was why they were here today.</p>
<p>“We’re going to work on your agility today, Dennis, so we’re not going to practice in the ordinary way. Look up there.” He gestured up, to the air above the pitch. Dennis obediently raised his eyes. What he saw was another of Harry’s Quidditch innovations. Between the stands where students and staff would sit was strung a tangle of thin, brightly colored cables, swaying slightly in the light breeze that penetrated Harry‘s invisible dome. Large, man-shaped dummies suspended from a number of these, and bells hung everywhere, silent in the breeze. “Those bells,” Harry explained when Dennis asked about them, “will only ring when you run into a rope or a dummy. They’re for me, so I can know when you’re messing up. Remember, just because I’m good at this game doesn’t mean I’m any less blind on the pitch.” This was a reference to an earlier practice, about a week ago, when Dennis, while attempting a Wronski Feint, has yelled out, “Harry! Watch this!” The entire team had gotten a good laugh out of it, especially Harry, but Dennis had been absolutely mortified by his gaffe. Harry was still trying to put him at ease about it. He laughed weakly, which was an improvement. “So, I’ve set the Snitch to go as fast as it did yesterday, and to stay within the ropes. Your goal is both to catch it, <em>and</em> to avoid touching the ropes, or the things hanging from them. There’ll be two bludgers up as well, so be careful. Think of this as a test. If you pass, I might let you play in tomorrow’s match.”</p>
<p>He released the Snitch, which zipped up and rapidly lost itself in the web of ropes. At Harry’s signal, Dennis launched himself upwards, entering the tangle with only a moment’s hesitation.</p>
<p>It took him a while to get the hang of it, and he narrowly avoided getting knocked off his broom several times. So many bells were rung that Harry’s ears were ringing as well, but eventually, they decreased and then lay nearly silent. He could hear Dennis flying confidently after the Snitch, which let off a soft chime every time he caught it. Then Harry dropped his dome, and the wind picked up substantially. The ropes began to dance wildly, and the player-forms began to slide to and fro across the pitch. “Harry?” Dennis’ voice was a query. Harry laughed to himself, and then he raised his voice to be heard above the wind.</p>
<p>“This is even closer to a real game, Dennis. Nothing ever holds still. Try not to ring any bells.”</p>
<p>By the end of practice, as dark was falling, Dennis hadn’t mastered the exercise. That wasn’t a surprise. Harry had designed it, once again, to be more difficult than anything the boy would encounter in a match. He wanted to see, exactly, how good he was. He had to be ready, though for what, Harry did not know.</p>
<p>When match day arrived, Harry gathered the entire team in the common room before classes. He didn’t give them a pep talk, as Wood would have. Instead, he merely complimented them on yesterday’s practice and exhorted them to relax over the day and to make sure they got at lest one good meal. He remembered his first match, and picking nervously at a piece of cold toast.</p>
<p>Classes flew by, as they do when one is both looking forward to and dreading something, with teachers as well as students excited by the prospect of the first Quidditch match in two years. Outside, it was a nice day, cool, but not cold, and dry. Harry had his dome set up before he joined his team, <em>his team </em>in the locker room.</p>
<p>“Now is my real chance to sound like Wood,” he said, quelling the excited chatter. The older students, those who remember Oliver Wood, laughed. “Today, we represent Gryffindor. Today, we <em>are</em> Gryffindor. We are courage, and we are strength, and we will win this match. This is a great team, for all we haven’t been together long. Fred, George, you’re here to do what you do best. Run into people and hit things with sticks. Ron, you keep your eye on the ball. If it gets anywhere near those hoops, its your responsibility. You’re our guard, our bastion. I know you’ll be great. Angelina, Dean, and Tristan, from you I want speed today. Hufflepuff’s biggest weakness is that their Chasers are slow on their brooms. I know that this shouldn’t be a problem for you, right? Tristan, you got your wings settled?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I didn’t wear the cloak today, and I had a good run this morning.”</p>
<p>“Wonderful. Everyone, I want the school to see your best today. Reserves, be watching the game carefully. You might be called, and you have to know what’s going on. Lee, are you announcing today?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, but I’ll have my broom with me.”</p>
<p>“Good. Well, then, it’s time. Remember, we are Gryffindor!” A raucous cheer rang out, and they all ran out to the pitch, still cheering. The crowd’s cheer joined them, and it was time to play.</p>
<p>Taking his place above the rest of the team after shaking hands with Chadwick Compton, Hufflepuff’s new captain, Harry blew his little whistle, sighing in satisfaction as the pitch sprung into auditory relief around him. Madame Hooch put the Quaffle into play, and the game was joined. The Hufflepuff Chasers were slower, as Harry had predicted, but not by much, and they made up for it in flawless teamwork. When they had the Quaffle, they passed it between themselves with seamless precision and dead-accurate throws. Ron, however, foiled them nearly every time, passing the Quaffle off to one of his own teammates.</p>
<p>Three hours into the game, Lee Jordan was proudly announcing that the score was 120-70, Gryffindor’s favor, and Harry was getting irritated. His team was playing great, but he was not. It had never taken him this long to catch the Snitch, except for the teacher’s game, and it was embarrassing. It helped that, while he had heard it several times, if only long enough for a fleeting chase, the Hufflepuff Seeker had yet to spot it at all, but it was still frustrating, not to mention tiring. Harry was breathing hard, and he couldn’t seem to catch his breath.</p>
<p>Suddenly, just as Hufflepuff scored a goal, Harry heard the Snitch. It was across the Pitch, near where the Hufflepuff Keeper guarded his hoops. “Finally,” he thought as he sprinted towards it, keeping a wary ear on the Hufflepuff Seeker, who took a moment to realize what Harry was doing, then raced after him. Harry leaned forward in his harness, willing the broom to its top speed, but the Hufflepuff was just as fast, astride what Fred and George, in their self-imposed role as Gryffindor’s spies, had told him was a Firebolt. The boy was right on his tail, and creeping up. The Snitch was still half the pitch away, and Harry was losing ground. Gritting his teeth, he willed the broom faster, pushing at it with his mind. Abruptly, <em>something </em>gave, and the broom leapt forward, tearing through the air like a lightning bolt. Harry let out a whoop as his opponent fell behind, but his exhilaration was short-lived. The broom kept going faster, kept accelerating through the air, but Harry couldn’t breath. He couldn’t feel anything save the burning that had taken over his chest, the agonizing signals from his brain that what his lungs were receiving was vacuum. A blackness that had nothing to do with blindness crowded at the edges of his mind, and his ears were ringing with colors that had nothing to do with sight. He couldn’t feel his hand, his arms, not even the wind on his face. He was losing it all to the vacuum.</p>
<p>Harry didn’t hear the succession of players from both sides shout as they tried to catch him, didn’t feel the beats of Tristan’s wings as they slowed his fall, didn’t feel the ground beneath him. There was only the vacuum, bright and dark, cacophonous and silent together. And welcoming. It was peaceful there, close and tempting. He succumbed to it gladly, and then it betrayed him. There was no light, there was no sound, and it was so cold. He struggled silently against it, but there was nothing he could do. The vacuum had him firmly in its grip.</p>

<p>Chapter 30</p>
<p>“Harry? Harry! Wake up!” Ron was screaming at his friend as he ran up to the Hospital Wing, Harry in his arms. Harry wasn’t breathing, his lips were blue and his skin like ice. Dumbledore had joined him as he left the pitch, along with most of the student body, but Ron hadn’t relinquished his hold on his friend. He let the Headmaster turn back the crowd as he ran, still trying to awaken his friend.</p>
<p>Reaching the infirmary, Pomfrey was already waiting for him, and she grimly set to work immediately. “What happened?” she asked while she loosened his robes and bared his chest.</p>
<p>“He was going after the Snitch, and he just passed out. I don’t know what happened to him. He just passed out and fell.” Ron was trying hard to keep from crying in worry for his friend. Hermione ran in, having sprinted as fast as she could from the prefect’s stands.</p>
<p>“Is he OK?” she asked. Ron shook his head, almost crying.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. He’s not breathing.”</p>
<p>“I need you two to leave,” Madame Pomfrey said politely, not looking up from Harry. “I’m sure he’ll be all right.”</p>
<p>“Is it just me,” said Ron with forced levity as he and Hermione were ushered out of the Infirmary, “or does Harry have his own, reserved bed in there? Oh, Headmaster, Harry’s already in there, with Madame Pomfrey.” Dumbledore smiled an absent reassurance at them as he strode past and into the room they had just left.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong with Harry?” the Headmaster asked the Nurse, speaking in a grave tone.</p>
<p>“I can’t explain right now,” she replied impatiently. “He’s not breathing and the Ressucio Charm didn’t work. I have to do this the manual way. Will you help?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know what to do.” For the omniscient Headmaster, that was an uncharacteristic admission. There was so very little that he didn’t know.</p>
<p>“I’ll walk you through what you need to do,” she said, a little startled. “I’m going to do the chest compressions, so you’ll have to breath for him. When I tell you, breath in through his mouth, one deep breath.” She rolled up her sleeves and positioned herself to start. “Are you ready? One...Two...Three...Four... Five...now, breathe!” With each number, she pressed her hands deeply into Harry’s chest. No air was expelled, despite the force behind the thrusts. When Dumbledore breathed in, his chest didn‘t rise. The air would not go in, though nothing blocked his throat. They repeated the operation three times, with as little result. Madame Pomfrey checked his pulse again. It was still there, though it was thready. “I’ll have to put in a chest tube. His lungs are deflated. Did something hit him in the chest?” She didn’t wait for an answer, just continued summoning the things she would need. “This is a mundane operation. Usually, I can fix this with Ressucio, but it’s not working, and I don’t know why.” She cast a sterilization charm around the Infirmary, and then she set to her task. “I have to cut into him, and put in a tube to inflate his lungs by hand.” She shuddered. “I hate operating,” she said, but her hand was steady as she put the scalpel to his skin. A few careful, controlled cuts brought her to Harry’s chest wall. Working quickly, for Harry’s heart, deprived of oxygen, was beginning to falter, she cut a small slice through it, and inserted the tube. A simple charm sealed the muscle and skin around it, and then she conjured a medical bellows to pump up the collapsed lung. A few slow pumps, and Harry’s chest rose. A few anxious moments later, it fell, and rose again. Harry was breathing again. Madame Pomfrey and Dumbledore breathed themselves, deep sighs of relief. It wasn’t long at all before Harry’s colour returned to normal.</p>
<p>The first sensation of which Harry was aware was a small pain, in the right of his chest. It was the only thing in the vacuum, so his consciousness drifted towards it. It grew, possessing his chest in a fire that hurt horribly, but he knew that healing was being done. Abruptly, his chest heaved, and he was back in his body. The vacuum was gone.</p>
<p>He tried to speak, to ask who was near, but before he could make a sound, he felt a staying hand. “Don’t try to talk, Harry, not yet.” It was Dumbledore’s voice, kind and warm. “You’ve just had a rather trying experience.”</p>
<p>“What?” he mouthed, no sound to waste precious air. “What happened?”</p>
<p>“What happened? We don’t know yet, Harry. We were hoping that you could tell us, but that can wait until you’re a bit better. You’re going to spend tonight in the Hospital Wing and tomorrow night as well, I’m sure you’ll be glad to hear. I know how you love this place.” A dry chuckle. “Now, I’m sure that Miss Granger and Mr. Weasley would like to monopolize your time.”</p>
<p>“Hi, Harry,” said Ron’s voice, hesitant and worried. “You okay?” Harry nodded.</p>
<p>“He’s not supposed to talk yet,” said Madame Pomfrey from behind them. “You can stay a while, but then I want him to rest.”</p>
<p>“Alright, Madame Pomfrey,” said Hermione. When the matron had gone, she stepped closer to Harry’s side. “I’ve got your broom, Harry,” she said, and pressed it into his hand. “It didn’t fly off, it just fell with you on it.” Harry closed his fingers around it, but made no more response than that. The two stayed by his side in silence until Madame Pomfrey came to shoo them out. Harry drank the sleep potion she gave him without protest, which worried the Nurse mare than his injuries.</p>
<p>The next morning, Pomfrey told Harry that he could talk, but that he had to stay in bed. It was a Saturday, so Breena, Ron and Hermione spent the entire day by his side. They talked little, mostly of what had happened after Harry left the game. There had been a long break, but it had eventually been resumed. Dennis, Harry was glad to hear, had caught the Snitch, but it really didn’t matter who had caught it. Tristan, who had returned to the game after catching Harry, had scored 12 goals. Gryffindor had won by over two hundred points. At some point or another over the day, the entire team drifted into the Infirmary to wish him well. Harry smiled and made merry while they were there, but when it was just him and his friends, he deflated and retreated back into silence. Late in the afternoon, Dumbledore came back to visit. He and Pomfrey came in together, conferring in low voices, a fact which made Harry unaccountably nervous. When Pomfrey retreated to fiddle nervously with something in the back of the room, the anxiety increased. “Professor Dumbledore?” Harry asked in a voice scarcely more than a whisper. “What’s the matter with me?”</p>
<p>Dumbledore tousled Harry’s hair affectionately, but his voice, when he spoke, was grave. “I’m afraid, Harry, that we were overeager to declare you recovered. Your lungs, it appears, have not healed fully since your ideal this past summer, and you overstrained them yesterday in the match. You had a pulmonary seizure, Harry, a seizure of the lungs. They just stopped working, at which point you lost consciousness, and when you blacked out, your broom stopped functioning, and you fell. Young McGinnis caught you, that admirable young man with the wings. What we are worried about is it happening again. That, Harry, is why I have to deliver some very bad news. Madame Pomfrey has insisted, and I, I am afraid, have to support her. You can not play in the matches anymore. You can still captain the team, but I’m afraid that we are worried that this will recur, and that, next time, we won’t have such good fortune. We were very lucky this time, Harry. You were oxygen-deprived for a dangerously long time.” Warily, Dumbledore and the others waited for Harry’s response. Whatever they were waiting for, however, they didn’t get it. Harry merely blinked blindly a few times, and then turned his face to the wall. He didn’t say anything, and they didn’t press him. He would talk when he was ready.</p>
<p>Late that night, after pretending to take another of Madame Pomfrey’s sleeping drafts, Harry lay awake. He had never turned down his hearing after the match, and he could hear all the tiny noises of the castle at night. Nearly a dozen floors below him, he could hear the gossipy chatter of the house-elves in the kitchen, working to prepare food for the next day. A floor above, he could hear Argus Filch talking to his ancient cat, Mrs. Norris. ‘Who’s Mr. Norris?’ Harry wondered absently. His mind wandered blankly, not wanting to settle on a thought, but one kept cropping up. Quidditch. The Quidditch pitch was his life now, the only place where he never felt crippled or blind, and it was lost to him. He couldn’t play, but, oh irony of ironies, he was still captain. He had to watch over the practices, attend every game, but he couldn’t play. He gripped his blanket in a fist, gritting his teeth against despair. He couldn’t play. His broom still leaned against the table by his bedside, taunting him. At least he didn’t have to see it, he thought wryly, but he knew it was there. At least he had a replacement. Suddenly, he realized something. This was why he had been training Dennis so hard. Something in him had <em>known </em>that this would come to pass. He had foreseen it, but not realized it. He could have avoided it, if he had known. That forced a bitter laugh from him. He was a seer now, wasn’t he? He should have <em>seen </em>this coming. Then and there, Harry resolved to train his new talent. Starting in the morning. With that thought, he rolled over and went to sleep. He never knew that his foot had twitched twice during his introspection, and no one was there to see it when it twitched again.</p>

<p>Chapter 31</p>
<p>The next morning, before Madame Pomfrey could wake up and forbid him, Harry summoned his chair and, by dint of no little effort, pulled himself into it. He let himself out of the Hospital Wing, rolling silently through the halls. Reaching the Fat Lady, he gave her the password, “Victorious,” but ignored her anxious questions as he passed. He slipped through the boy’s dorm and into the room he shared with Ron, all without waking anyone. He could hear his friend’s light snores as he whispered a summoning charm, caught the few books he wanted, and retraced his steps back to the Common Room. Being careful to remain quiet, he cast his Eladmij charm to make the books read themselves to him, and settled in to study his new talent.</p>
<p>A few hours later, when the castle began to stir, Harry had read the first two books cover to cover and was well started on the third. He closed it as sleepy Gryffindors began to trickle into the Common Room, and, without a word to anyone, he slipped out with his books. He passed a few professors in the corridors, but they had heard of his loss through one avenue or another and so left him to his silence. But it wasn’t silence he was seeking this morning, nor solitude. His wheels led him to the room below Professor Trelawney’s attic.</p>
<p>“Professor Trelawney?” he called out loudly. When there was no immediate response, he levitated the heaviest of his books to the ceiling, using it to knock on the trap door there. That provoked movement above, and a moment later, the trap door opened.</p>
<p>“Harry!” exclaimed Trelawney in a shocked voice. “What are you doing here?” Since his demonstration on the first day of class, she had dropped her airy-fairy act around him. It was a refreshing change.</p>
<p>“I want training in being a Seer,” he called up to her.</p>
<p>When they were ensconced together in her office, which was a comfortable enough room if one left the window open, Trelawney questioned him. “Now, Harry,” she said, choosing her words carefully. “What brought about this change of mind? As I recall, you wanted to ignore this skill so long as it didn’t interfere with your life.”</p>
<p>“Well, now it’s interfering. I was training Dennis Creevey to replace me, and I didn’t even know it. All I knew was that I had to be ready, but I didn’t know what I had to be ready for. Now I do, and I wish I’d known before. I could have prevented this.” His voice was tight with frustration.</p>
<p>“Seeing a thing and being able to prevent it do not always come hand in hand, Harry. The damage that caused this was done long before you manifested this ability to see. To tell the truth, I...” Harry could hear her fidgeting, but she went on. “I would not be the best person to instruct you in this. My strengths are in the lesser Divinations, as I’ve told you before. What you are capable of is beyond that, something that we call True Seeing, or Oraclamancy. The name is misleading. What you may See is not what will, definitely, assuredly come to pass, but it is the most likely possibility. It is what will come to pass if specific action is not taken to prevent it. That is, of course, if you are Seeing into the future. What you See in the past, or in the present, those occurrences are already set in stone, but from there, from <em>now</em>, what may happen is fluid, alterable. Oh, I wish...” Her voice changed, lightened. “Why not? Up for a stroll down to Hogsmead, Harry? There’s someone I’d like you to meet.”</p>
<p>Surprisingly, out of the school, Trelawney proved an easy companion. She let Harry keep to his introspective silence, humming gaily as she strolled alongside his wheelchair. She had already refused to tell him where they were going, saying that it was to be a surprise. Somehow, Harry got the impression that the surprise was not for him.</p>
<p>Reaching the edge of town, Harry had to let her direct his chair, and he was surprised when she skirted the village itself, following instead a dirt track that led across the train tracks and up the foot of the nearby mountain. Harry estimated that they were near the cave in which Sirius had hid only the year before. They turned through a garden gate that creaked gently, up a gravel path, and mounted a wooden porch. Stepping ahead of him, Trelawney knocked. Rather, she would have, had the door not opened under her fist.</p>
<p>“Sybil!” came a delighted voice, that of a young man. “What brings you to my door this fine morn?” His voice was smug, but friendly. Harry liked him immediately.</p>
<p>“Good morning, Dominic, but you know perfectly well why I am here, for all I was trying to surprise you. You knew I was coming before I was, didn’t you?” Her tone was one of easy camaraderie, Harry noticed, but with a deep respect for this Dominic.</p>
<p>“Certainly I knew, Sybil,” he said, a self-satisfied laugh ringing in his voice. “But one does not parade the fact that one is All-Knowing. I frequently act as though I am not possessed of the Inner Eye, so as not to make others nervous.”</p>
<p>At this echo of Professor Trelawney’s own words, Harry gaped a moment, then burst out laughing. Trelawney made small sputtering noises, and the man laughed as well, a warm, only slightly superior chuckle. “Oh, don’t take teasing so seriously, Sybil. A joke’s a joke. And you then, since I <em>am </em>possessed of the Inner Eye, are Harry Potter. A pleasure to meet you. My name is Dominic Deegan, and, since Sybil has neglected to explain anything to you, I am a Seer, and I’m going to train you to be one too. Er...” He stopped short, listening to something that Harry could not hear. A moment later, though, two loud crashes resounded from the rear of the house. “Right on time,” he sighed. “Excuse me a moment. Stunt and Bumper need to be put out.” The two adults laughed at a shared joke, and Dominic left the room. From the back, they could hear 3 raised, male voices; something about trapdoors and idiocy, then a door slammed, and Dominic returned. “They will never learn,” he said, more to himself than those present. He sat down in a chair beside the empty fireplace. Harry heard the scraping and tamping sounds of a pipe being filled, a sound familiar to him from the Weasleys. When the warm scent of pipe tobacco filled the air, Dominic sighed and spoke again. “I have the feeling that this, me teaching you, would be a useful endeavor for us both, but the decision is ultimately yours.”</p>
<p>At his words, Harry felt something very odd. A heavy, mist-like sensation overtook him, making him feel somehow less substantial, less solid. From Trelawney’s indrawn breath, he knew that she felt it too. “What...?” Harry began to ask, but Dominic cut him off with an explanation and a laugh.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. This is a peculiarity of mine. Whenever I’m on hand to bear witness to a life-altering decision, like this one, the world around me goes somewhat... grey. I don’t know why it happens, although I have several theories.”</p>
<p>The sensation, unnerving though it was, didn’t last long. All it took to strengthen Harry’s decision was to remember why he had made it in the first place. “Teach me,” he said firmly, and the feeling was gone, as thoroughly as if it had never been. “I don’t want to be caught be surprise again.” He heard a dry chuckle in response to his determined statement, and a hand took his and shook it.</p>
<p>“Well chosen, Harry,” said Dominic sincerely, all sarcasm gone from his voice. “That’s exactly why I chose this life, and it’s the best reason I’ve ever come up with. Down to business, then.” His tone turned brisk. “Headmaster Dumbledore has already approved this, I assume?” Trelawney made a small squeaking sound, which Harry rightly took to mean that she had forgotten that particular detail. “Well then, it’s a nice day, we can all walk up to the castle together. I’d like to see it.”</p>
<p>All the way back up to Hogwarts, Dominic and Professor Trelawney chattered argumentatively about the relative merits of different varieties of tea leaves for readings. Harry lagged a space behind the two, not particularly wanting to be included in a conversation between two obviously close friends. As they neared the castle, however, Dominic fell slowly silent. Harry could hear his footsteps slow now and again, as though he was trying to absorb the surroundings. “Wow,” he murmured under his breath.</p>
<p>“What is it?” asked Harry, catching up to them.</p>
<p>“The castle,” said Dominic in a low voice. “It’s... incredible.”</p>
<p>Harry was puzzled, but he let it slide. From behind them, a noise was distracting him. Pawsteps were following them, from the edge of the road. He was sure the others had not heard it; his enhanced hearing has barely brought it to his attention. He was about to mention it to them when a brash, inhuman voice called out from the vicinity of the stalker. “Hey Boss!” it called. “You forgot to feed me!” Then, abruptly, several things happened so rapidly as to seem all at once.</p>
<p>First, Harry heard a whistling, as of an object hurled rapidly through the air. Before he could cry a warning, the object connected with someone’s head with a solid thunk, Dominic cried out in pain and anger, and then something, probably that same something on a rebound, bounced off Harry’s shoulder and landed in his lap. At least, he assumed that was where it landed. He couldn’t feel anything there, after all, but he hadn’t heard it fall to the ground. He was groping around for it in his chair as he heard Dominic grumbling and swearing. He found the object wedged next to his hip, and held it up. It was a sphere, he found, made of something very smooth. Glass, probably. It was a glass ball.</p>
<p>“That would be mine,” growled Dominic. “Spark always throws it at me when he’s mad.”</p>
<p>“Spark?”</p>
<p>“My cat. He tends to think with his stomach, and I apparently didn’t feed him today. Spark, go home! I’ll feed you after I get back.”</p>
<p>“Fine,” sulked the voice, “but it’d better be fish...” Spark stalked off, muttering dire threats that only Harry could hear. He offered the ball to Dominic, but when the man touched it, meaning to take it, he froze. Harry felt him start to tremor before he, too, felt the rigid cold that crept from the sphere. Try as he might, he found that he could not let it go. As though from a distance, he heard Trelawney’s cries of alarm and felt her try to pull the ball from his hand, but it seemed of no consequence. What was important was the tiny point of light that dominated his vision.</p>
<p>The point expanded, adopting a greenish tinge as it approached. It opened into a scene, one that chilled Harry more than the ice coating his hand. Voldemort, standing in a circle of Death Eaters, holding a child. Rather, the body of a child, for no neck of a living creature would hang at that angle. She was a heart-breaking sight, a tiny girl, dark of hair and skin, dressed by some loving mother in a yellow dress, with a bow in her hair to match. Voldemort held her as though she were alive, cradling her, brushing the hair away from her staring eyes. They were blue, Harry noticed in his stunned state, a clear, surprised blue. A snake of red crossed one, where the tiny blood vessels had burst in the moment of death. A matching trickle of blood trailed from her lax mouth, smeared slightly by her killer’s hand. No painless Avada Kedavra had taken her life. Voldemort had killed this child with his own hands, and he had laughed. The knowledge sickened Harry, but he could do nothing to refuse it. It poured into his mind, as had the knowledge of Professor Trelawney’s life at the start of term. He watched, in a horrible doubled layer of vision, as Voldemort ripped the crying child from her mother’s hands, as he killed her with one awful blow in front of her family, as his Death Eaters held the father and the two sons at bay. They were muggles, this family, and had done nothing to call this down upon themselves, nothing save give birth to a witch, that tiny child that lay limp in evil’s arms. Her name was Arriana, Harry knew. She was four, and had just lost her first tooth. It was under her pillow, waiting for the tooth fairy to replace it with a Pound. He knew that it would still be there, weeks hence, when the bereft relatives of this doomed family came to claim their effects. He knew, too, that the oldest son, a boy of fourteen, named Aaron, would be missed at school by his girlfriend, a girl who, driven to promiscuity by grief and rage, would bear another boy’s child by her sixteenth birthday. The younger son’s dog, a week after his master’s death, would chew through the rope that held him in the yard, run into the busy nearby street, and three people would die in a screech of steel. All of this, Harry knew, and more. The man who would replace the father in his job as a security guard at a nearby bank would be corrupt, and two women, one pregnant, would be shot in a hostage situation. The mother, had she lived, would have finished her Doctorate in a matter of months, and become a surgeon in an emergency room in London. She would have saved scores of lives in the six years she had left to her natural life. But her life, unnaturally or not, ended tonight, and she was glad to die, for she had seen her children die first. She pleaded with evil to let her join them, and he obliged in a flash of green light.</p>
<p>That same flash that released the ravaged mother released Harry from his vision. He stared gratefully into his familiar blackness, scarcely aware of the muffled thunk of the glass ball falling to the grass, or of Dominic’s panting. He merely sat there, stunned and trembling. His scar burned dully, but deeply, as though the mark were bone-deep. The sun still shone, warm on his cheek, but Harry felt nothing but cold. He had seen Voldemort before, it was true, but this, this was worse than seeing him. Harry had seen him kill with his own hands, had seen his obvious pleasure in the deaths, and he had seen the repercussions. He could still feel the ripples spreading, as though the air itself was transmitting Voldemort’s evil. A hundred names and more streamed through Harry’s mind, all future deaths that could be traced to this one vision of murder.</p>
<p>Arriana. A moment of clarity in his terror brought him another unwelcome vision. Had she lived, she would have gone to Hogwarts. She would have been one of Hermione’s first students, and she would have sat in the front row, always with her hand up. She would have been a Ravenclaw, eventually a prefect, and after school, she would have worked in an obscure office at the Ministry. There was no possible reason for Voldemort to kill her, yet there she lay, dead in his arms. All because of her muggle blood. The sheer unfairness of it hit Harry like a wave, drowning him in a tide of bitter rage. Everything, every hardship that Harry had faced, all of it was Voldemort’s fault, but it was nothing compared to the loss of this one, innocent life. She had been four.</p>
<p>“She was only four, you bastard!” he screamed into the morning, shattering the last vestiges of the vision. Dominic’s moaning stopped, as did Trelawney’s hennish queries.</p>
<p>“You saw a girl?” Dominic asked, his voice hitching and pained as he knelt by Harry‘s side. “A girl in a yellow dress, killed by a monster?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Harry in a biting voice. “And her family, and a hundred more people. Voldemort would kill the world, if he could. Just to rid it of ‘impurities.’” He lifted his head to the sunlight, trying to erase the coldness of the vision from his skin. “That’s how he thinks of muggles, and to him, muggleborns are worse. The little girl, Arriana, was a muggleborn.” She’s dead. The words did not need said.</p>
<p>“I only saw her,” said Dominic softly. “In his arms. So that was Voldemort?” Harry nodded mutely, noticing without caring that Dominic didn’t falter to speak the most hated name in the wizarding world. “But you saw more?” Harry nodded again. He wasn’t going to describe his vision, wasn’t going to live through it again, but Dominic didn’t press. “I saw one more thing,” he said softly. “A page, from a book. I didn’t understand the language, but there was a lightning bolt repeated over and over as the border.” Harry nodded a third time, still silent. He had seen the page as well, but it was overshadowed. In his vision, it was soaked in blood, torn and ground under Voldemort’s feet. Harry could read it, though. It was clear as day in his mind’s eye, but he refused to read it. Not just yet.</p>
<p>“Let’s go to Dumbledore,” suggested Trelawney hesitantly. The Seers started, having forgotten that she was there. Dominic stood up, and he pushed Harry’s chair the rest of the way to the castle. Harry didn’t speak a word. The warmth of the sunlight seemed to slide over him, avoiding him. He flinched when they entered the shadow of Hogwarts.</p>
<p>Dumbledore wasn’t in his office, nor was he to be found anywhere in the halls. Harry was ready to scream in frustration when they finally found him, puttering around in one of the greenhouses. His cheerful humming grated on Harry’s nerves, but he sobered when he saw Harry’s face. “I had a vision,” Harry said, his inflection toneless and flat. “Of Voldemort. He’s killed a muggle family, all because their daughter was a witch. She was four.” Still, no emotion infected his voice. He had locked it away, to keep it from drowning him again. “Her name was Arriana, and she would have been a Ravenclaw Prefect. Hermione was supposed to teach her Transfiguration. So many deaths...” His voice cracked. He couldn’t continue. Dumbledore, at a loss for words, patted his shoulder. Harry was gasping for breath as the remembering became too much. There was too much to remember, too much to know. It was a sharp pain, a hitch in his heart and in his throat. “It’s too much,” he whispered.</p>
<p>Dumbledore stepped back from Harry a moment, conferring quietly with Dominic and Trelawney. “Harry,” he said gently. “I am going to go and get something that will help you. Will you let Mr. Deegan take you up to your room, and will you wait for me there?” At Harry’s mute nod, he left in a swish of robes.</p>
<p>Harry was forced to speak, to direct Dominic through the labyrinthine castle. To all appearances, the man had never seen it before, yet he was a wizard. It would have puzzled Harry, under any less distracting circumstances. As it was, he spoke no more than necessary, directing the man left or right at intersections, up this stair or down that one, and giving the various passwords.</p>
<p>When, at last, they reached Harry’s room, they had encountered few students, and those they had seen had been turned aside by Dominic’s deft sarcasm. When the entered Harry’s room, however, Ron was there.</p>
<p>“Harry? What’s wrong?” he asked, seeing the pain in Harry’s face. “And who’s that?”</p>
<p>Gracefully, Dominic introduced himself, giving Harry time to work up an answer, truthful or not, for his friend and brother. “My name is Dominic Deegan, and I’m Harry’s new teacher. I live down in Hogsmead, which is where I’ll be teaching him, and where he’s been this morning. I’m a Seer,” he explained. “And Harry is going to be one too. In fact,” he said, his voice going sad. “He already is.”</p>
<p>I know that,” scoffed Ron. “He saw old Trelawney's whole life the other day, didn’t you, Harry? Harry?”</p>
<p>“I had another vision, Seeing, whatever you want to call it, today, Ron. I don’t want to talk about it. Dumbledore is going to meet me here. You can stay, if you want. In fact, I’d like you to be here.” Harry’s voice was fragile and cool, hiding most of what was running through his mind. Four. Blue eyes. A dog in headlights. The knowledge wouldn’t stop coming. He could still feel the glass ball in his hand, he realized, still feel the ice that had crackled under his fingernails and around his palm. He rubbed his hand fiercely against his robes, trying to erase it. “It was Voldemort. I saw him.”</p>
<p>Ron winced at the name, as Harry had expected, but he moved to offer sympathy nonetheless. He came to sit next to Harry’s chair, patting his shoulder awkwardly. It wasn’t much of a comfort, but Harry was grateful for the effort. Together, the three of them sat in silence and waited for Dumbledore.</p>
<p>It was nearly an hour before the Headmaster appeared, coming not by way of the door, but rather through the fireplace, in a swirl of green flame. Three quick strides brought him to stand in front of Harry, and he placed something in Harry’s lap. Exploring it with his hand, which was at last beginning to feel warmth again, Harry found a smooth, stone basin, carved around the rim with symbols that Harry’s fingers did not recognize. It was a pensieve.</p>
<p>“I believe I showed you how one of these works, Harry,” said Dumbledore. “Do you think it might help?”</p>
<p>Harry nodded once again, eager to get the swirling thoughts out of his head. He placed the tip of his wand immediately to his temple, shuddering in relief as he felt the image of Arriana in Voldemort’s arms slide out of his mind’s eye. It was still there, when he deposited the liquefied thought into the basin, but it seemed to have faded. To have taken a step back. Encouraged, he put the entire vision into the bowl, strand by strand. He was oblivious to the reactions of the others in the room as his vision unfolded on the surface of the light made liquid that filled the bowl. Dumbledore’s face grew still, his eyes hooded as he saw the future that Harry had seen. Dominic and Ron cried out softly as each person died, although they saw only the family. Of the future beyond that, the bowl concealed what Harry had Seen.</p>
<p>“Harry!” said Ron when he was done. “Merlin, Harry!” He couldn’t seem to articulate a thought beyond that. Harry, on the other hand, slumped in relief. He could breath again, could take a deep breath without rage that Arriana would never again draw air into her lungs. The anger was still there, would never leave completely, but it was no longer stifling.</p>
<p>“I’ll be alright, Ron,” he said with a half-smile. “I’ll be okay. It was just...”</p>
<p>“It was terrible.” Dominic completed the sentence for him. “I didn’t know that you saw all that. All I saw was that first scene, and the page. You didn’t put the page into the pensieve.”</p>
<p>“Oh, right.” Harry pulled that one final thought from his head, putting it into the liquid. Dumbledore made a small exclamation.</p>
<p>“You both saw that? And you could read it?”</p>
<p>“I couldn’t.” said Dominic.</p>
<p>“I can,” said Harry quietly.</p>
<p>“You can?” Dumbledore sounded incredulous. “Harry, it’s written in the Griffon Hand. It’s an ancient language, rumoured to be only myth. No one still living can read it. I can’t, certainly.”</p>
<p>“I can,” repeated Harry. It still shone in his mind’s eye, undiminished by the strand of thought that he had taken out. He read it aloud.</p>
<p>“As a phoenix rises, born from death, so shall he.</p>
<p>Killed four times over in the space of a circle,</p>
<p>By family, life, friends, and foe.</p>
<p>He shall yet live to learn.</p>
<p>Of four, he is heir to two, and bound to one from youth.</p>
<p>“It’s a prophecy,” murmured Dumbledore.</p>
<p>“It’s the beginning of the Prophecy of the Wood,” corrected Dominic. “Merlin himself wrote it, over fifteen thousand years ago.”</p>
<p>“The beginning?” asked Ron. “Do you know the rest of it?”</p>
<p>“No, I don’t. That’s the only part that’s been translated.”</p>
<p>“I haven’t heard of this prophecy,” said Dumbledore curiously.</p>
<p>“It’s kind of obscure,” admitted Dominic. “But I am something of an adept at obscure research. I enjoy it.”</p>
<p>“You sound like our friend Hermione,” said Ron in a half-hearted attempt at levity. With an effort, Harry smiled, and even managed a laugh.</p>
<p>“You do, you know, if you like research that much. She’s probably in the library right now.”</p>
<p>“She is,” confirmed Ron. “Looking up stuff for that essay in Transfiguration that’s due in two weeks. It’s not even been technically assigned yet.”</p>
<p>“I know,” said Harry wryly. “But that’s Hermione for you.”</p>
<p>“Well,” said Dumbledore with an air of moving on. “Do either of you know what provoked this vision? Did you touch anything, smell anything?”</p>
<p>“My crystal ball,” said Dominic. “We touched it at the same time, after my cat threw it at me.”</p>
<p>“That’s right,” said Harry. “It bounced off Mr. Deegan’s head and landed in my lap, and when I was handing it to him, that’s when it happened. We both froze, and ice grew over our hands.”</p>
<p>“Is that an ordinary side effect when you see, Mr. Deegan?” asked Dumbledore. “The ice?”</p>
<p>“No,” said Dominic. “That’s never happened before, but I’ve also never Seen <em>with </em>someone. This was the first time someone else has Seen what I‘ve Seen.” There was a strangely relieved tone to his voice. “I think that I was only Seeing an echo of Harry’s vision, though. I wouldn’t have Seen it if he weren’t there.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry,” apologized Harry.</p>
<p>“I didn’t say it was your fault, did I?” said the Seer. “If anything, it was mine. I should have fed Spark this morning.”</p>
<p>After explaining this apparent non-sequitor to a puzzled Ron and Dumbledore, they agreed mutually to abandon the topic, and set off to Dumbledore’s office to discuss Harry’s tutelage as a Seer, or as Dominic preferred to call the profession, an Oracle. It didn’t take long to decide that Harry would study independently during the week, meeting with Dominic on the weekends at his house in Hogsmead to discuss his progress. He would meet with Trelawney too, although he was excused from her everyday classes, but she would be more of am aid than a teacher. Most of what Harry was going to be learning was beyond her.</p>
<p>All of this was settle just in time for lunch, so Dominic joined him at the Gryffindor table. Harry, not eating as usual, made an effort to act as cheerful as he had been before the Quidditch match, and most of his classmates were fooled. Dennis was apologetic in the extreme about replacing Harry as Seeker, but Harry reassured him as best he could.</p>
<p>“You’re going to be great, Dennis, and I knew you were going to replace me anyway. I didn’t <em>know </em>that I knew, but I knew, if that makes any sense. Now I have time to train as a Seer, so I won’t be surprised like that again. I’m still Captain, but that doesn’t mean I have to be at every practice. I’ll be at the general practices, and your Seeker practices, but Angelina and the Twins can direct the rest. They have more experience than I do anyway. And of course, I’ll be at the matches.” The words were eating him hollow, and no one saw it. “I can captain just fine from the sidelines, and this team is so good they don’t need me breathing down their necks in the air.” No one at all saw it, except Dominic, sitting next to Harry and letting the conversation wash over him as he ate. He, in that same doubled vision that had nauseated Harry earlier, saw Harry’s fall two days before, but what Dominic saw was not the truth of what had happened. He didn’t see Tristan’s spectacular and heroic catch of the unconscious Seeker. Rather, he saw the winged boy miss by a hand‘s length, saw Harry hit the ground hard, saw him bounce on the hard ground and lay still, unmoving. He saw Dumbledore’s grieving face as Madame Pomfrey shook her head in negation. He saw Harry dead, two days ago, yet there he sat, laughing with his friends at Dean’s amazement when the pastry he was eating turned him into an orange Labrador. You couldn’t see a past that hadn’t happened. That was one of the first things he had learned in his own training as a Seer, not so long ago. A vision of the past was true. But this vision, obviously, was false. He excused himself politely from the table and retreated to a point outside the front doors of the castle. There, he lit his pipe to aid his concentration, and pulled his crystal ball from his pocket. Wiping the grass stains and dew from it, he gazed into it, willing to see farther into Harry’s past. He, like everyone else, had heard of the boy’s trials at the hands of his uncle, and he looked back to see his rescue from that. Through a thick cloud, he saw Dumbledore, Snape and the adult Weasleys apparate on the curb in front of Privet Drive. He watched them walk around the Dursley’s car, which was parked haphazardly across the front lawn, and up to the porch. Snape blasted the door down, and they all hurried inside, where they found a drunken Vernon Dursley passed out in front of a blaring television. There was no sign of Harry, and Vernon was in no condition to tell them where he was. Dominic was forced to watch as nearly two weeks passed, and then a decomposing body washed up near Calais, France. Voldemort’s forces were the one to find it, and to identify it as the corpse of the Boy-Who-Lived. When the vision released him, Dominic sighed. There was a sense of wrongness to these visions, beyond the mere wrongness of Seeing something that had not happened. He didn’t have the energy, just then, to See forward into the boy’s future, and he would not be able to trust what he Saw.</p>
<p>“Mr. Deegan?” called a girl from the castle door. “Harry’s looking for you. I’m Breena, by the way,” she said in a cheerful, American accent, as he turned to follow her in. “I’m one of Harry’s friends.”</p>
<p>“Nice to meet you.”</p>
<p>Back in the Great Hall, Harry’s classmates were finishing their lunches. Ron and the others had succeeded in cheering him up as much as could be expected, and plans were being made for a chess tournament in the Common Room that evening. Harry found himself irritated at the amount of noise around him, but he ignored it in favor of being around his friends. His need for solitude that had marked this morning had fled. When he noticed that the seat next to him was empty, he had asked everyone if they had seen where the man had gone, and Breena had volunteered to go and get him.</p>
<p>“Hey, Harry,” said Dominic as he returned, but he did not sit back down. “I’ve got to head home before Spark hunts me down again, so I’ll see next Saturday, around 10 in the morning, alright?”</p>
<p>“Alright,” said Harry amiably. “See you then.”</p>
<p>That evening, Harry joined in the chess tournament, but he was one of the first to be disqualified. He couldn’t concentrate on the strategy and the advice of his pieces. He went to bed early, and was asleep before his cat could curl up at his side. Before morning, though, his twitching foot would drive her away, but, once again, no one human was there to see it.</p>
<p>(Look, I ended another chapter with Harry falling asleep.)</p>
<p>(Oh, one last thing. My beta, Callas-and-Ivy, has once again gone to heroic efforts on my behalf. This extraordinarily long chapter kept her up all night for nearly no reason. I must have been on roll, but there was very little for her to do on this chapter.)</p>

<p>Chapter 32</p>
<p>Around midnight, Harry’s sleep was gripped by terror. Voldemort stood before him in his mind, alone this time. The Dark Lord wasn’t doing anything much, merely examining his own hands. With one long, claw-like fingernail, he picked blood out from beneath another. His hands were covered in dark blood, dried into every crack. The simple dream lasted for what felt like hours before it faded into the fog of peaceful sleep. When he awoke, all Harry could remember of it was the pervading sense of terror.</p>
<p>During breakfast the next morning, Harry stayed up in his room. A new set of books had arrived for him in the night, and he poured over them with Hermione-like diligence. He was easily distracted this morning, however, and had only finished one by the time he had to leave for his first class of the day, Transfiguration. He focused on his classes as best he could, almost to the exclusion of all else. Professor McGonagall praised him when he successfully managed to turn a book into a baidarka, and Lupin found nothing to criticize in his Puzzling Potion, but Harry just smiled distantly and nodded politely. At lunch, he went straight back to his books, and then he disappeared into Trelawney’s attic for the afternoon, which was a free. There, they discussed theory and history of Seeing, vying away by mutual agreement from any practical practice. Harry frankly did not want to See anything right now, for a sense of terror still lurked in that idea. So instead, he and Trelawney bantered about famous Seers, such as the famed Oracle of Delphi, whom Trelawney had actually met once, when she a young girl, and Rowena Ravenclaw, who, Harry learned, had been known as the fortune-teller Hawksight in her youth.</p>
<p>That night, when Ron was helping him get ready for bed, they talked about that day’s practice, which had been just between Chasers and Keepers. Tristan had a cold, Ron told Harry, but it hadn’t slowed him down much.</p>
<p>“I should have known that,” said Harry as Ron pulled his pajamas down over his head. “Maybe I should step down as Captain.”</p>
<p>“Don’t say that,” said Ron firmly. “It’s okay for you to be off for a few days. You’ve been through a lot since Friday.”</p>
<p>“Ummm...” Harry didn’t know whether to be mollified or not. He didn’t want his friends treating him like he would break. He smiled at that thought. You just didn’t get much more broken than this, yet he was worried about what his friends thought. Ironic. “I guess so, but I’ll be back tomorrow morning. Dennis has a Seeker practice before breakfast.”</p>
<p>“Right,” agreed Ron, getting into his own bed. “Well, wake me up when you've got to go. I’ll just go back to sleep after.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” said Harry.</p>
<p>The next morning, however, he didn’t waken Ron. Once again, he pulled himself into his chair. He didn’t bother with his clothes; they could wait until after practice. He just pulled his robes on over them, grabbed his cloak for warmth, and headed out to the Pitch. Dennis was already there, and Harry’s broom was still in Madame Pomfrey’s office, so he forewent setting up his dome. Instead, he set Dennis to flying laps, timing him around the Pitch until he was satisfied with his speed and timing before he released the super-powered Snitch. It looked a short practice, just Dennis catching the Snitch over and over, but then Tristan showed up for his morning run.</p>
<p>“Morning, Harry, Dennis,” he called, jogging over to where Harry sat. “I’m sorry about your problem,” he said softly to Harry as he watched Dennis weave through the loops, looking for the small gold ball. “Not to be able to fly... I can’t imagine it.”</p>
<p>“I can still fly,” said Harry defensively. “I’m just not allowed to play in the matches anymore. <em>Too stressful</em>.” He mimicked Pomfrey’s words from the morning after the game. “Did someone explain it to the team?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, Ron did. Boy, was he ever mad at Madame Pomfrey.”</p>
<p>“I was too, for a while. It’s not her fault, though. It never is. She’s just protective. I would be too, of a life I’ve gone through so much trouble to save, and more than once.”</p>
<p>“I think she’d be this protective of any of the students, Harry. It’s not just you.”</p>
<p>Harry swiveled to face the half-faery. “You sure you’re eleven?” He didn’t sound like a first year.</p>
<p>Tristan laughed, that light, musical laugh again. “No, I’m not. I was born 19 years ago, but I’ve spent most of those living with my mother’s kind, and they don’t consider a person to be old enough to leave his mother’s side until he’s at least 16, and I won’t be an adult until I’m 27. Time is different there. I look about 14,” he added, for Harry’s benefit. “I would have come to Hogwarts two years ago, but it took some time to convince the Ministry to let me have a wand. I am, after all, a non-human magical creature.” He said the words easily, but there was an edge to his voice. His pinions rattled as he shook his wings to settle them. “It didn’t help that my mother had taken up the case of that half-giant’s pet Hippogriff in front of the board for the Disposal of Dangerous Magical Creatures only the year before, and then the vampires in Australia revolted...... What it all amounted to was that they were paranoid about anyone who wasn’t human, and then I had the nerve, nay, the gall!” His voice took on theatrical overtones. “To ask for a wand of my own, so that I, a half-breed, might go to Hogwarts, to learn to use the powers I had inherited from my father. First, I was too inhuman, then I was too old. Finally, Mother talked to Dumbledore himself, and here I am.” He sighed. “And I’m so happy here. In Gryffindor, people don’t even worry about my wings. They, they accept me. On the train, I was worried that I would get sorted into Slytherin. I encountered Draco Malfoy on the train, with his friends. Lucius Malfoy was on the board that tried to keep me from getting my wand, and Malfoy knew about the whole thing. He was teasing me about it, calling me half-bred and stuff like that. One of his hulks, Doyle, I think, got behind me and snatched my cloak off. When I’m startled, sometimes, my wings jerk out. One hit Malfoy across the face, and he got mad. He grabbed my wing, and he was twisting the feathers when Hermione Granger came along behind him. I know she wasn’t a prefect yet, but she sure acted like it. She told him off, and he and his hulks went off into a different car. She let me sit with her and Ron the rest of the way here, and she wished me luck before I got into the boats.” He stopped abruptly, sounding as though he was worried that he had said too much. Harry grinned.</p>
<p>“If you’ve got a crush on her, I’m afraid you’re going to have to get through Ron. He got pretty jealous last year when she went to the Yule Ball with another guy.”</p>
<p>“No, it’s nothing like that,” muttered Tristan. “Everyone knows about Ron and Hermione. It’s, in the compartment with them, I met Ron’s little sister. She didn’t even mention my wings, the whole trip. She didn’t seem to care that they were there at all, and she was the first person to ever be like that. And she hugged me today.” He shut up fast after that admission, closing his mouth with an audible snap.</p>
<p>Harry smiled. “Sounds like that wasn’t such a bad thing.”</p>
<p>Tristan fidgeted, rattling his wings again. “You aren’t mad?”</p>
<p>This puzzled Harry. “Why would I be mad?”</p>
<p>“Er, well, everyone says that you and Ginny are a couple.” The words came out in a rush.</p>
<p>“Ginny and me? That’d be wrong. She’s my sister!” Harry wondered who had been spreading that rumour. He knew that Ginny had had a crush on him, once upon a time, but she certainly hadn’t protested becoming related to him, so he thought that her attraction had cooled.</p>
<p>“That’s right!” Tristan’s voice lifted. “Well, then, you don’t mind if I, if I try?”</p>
<p>“It all depends on what you try,” said Harry in his best approximation of a protective older brother, but then he laughed. “She thinks you’re cute, you know.”</p>
<p>Tristan made a little embarrassed noise, scrubbing his toe in the grass. Harry laughed. “Don’t worry about it, Tristan. Hey, I heard you scored a grand total of 19 goals in Friday’s game. Very impressive.”</p>
<p>“Thank you,” he replied proudly. “But Ron deserves more credit than I do. Hufflepuff’s Chasers were incredible. They kept getting the ball away from me?”</p>
<p>Harry had a shrewd thought. “Want to improve your skills?”</p>
<p>“Always!”</p>
<p>“Go up there,” Harry said, gesturing to where Dennis was circling lazily as he watched for the Snitch to reappear. “And play tag with Dennis. Hey, Dennis!” he bellowed as Tristan sprung into the air. “Tristan’s the Snitch! Catch him!”</p>
<p>They came in late to breakfast, the three of them, laughing and joking together. Harry invited them to eat with Ron and Hermione, but he declined to do so himself. “I’ve got more studying to do,” was his excuse. He headed up to the Gryffindor Tower, where he buried himself in Dominic’s books until time for class.</p>
<p>They had Care of Magical Creatures today, which meant that they would be meeting their new projects. For today, Hagrid had procured a brood of jarveys, which they were to train over the next several weeks. They each picked one out of the large pen. Harry got the only one that didn’t outrun his questing fingers, a fat sleepy one that Ron said was black, with buff under-hairs. It curled up in his lap, and promptly began to snore.</p>
<p>“Well, now you’ve all got one,” said Hagrid, quelling the conversations. “You need to make up a pen for them. Make sure they’ve got shade, and water, and a big tub of good, loamy dirt to burrow around in.” The class wandered out into the lawn, where a cluster of wire pens were set up. Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Breena chose adjacent ones, and Harry’s jarvey didn’t even notice when he set it inside.</p>
<p>“Is yours alive, Harry?” asked Ron jestingly. His was so active that it was slopping the water dish Ron had just put in.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Harry answered, poking the animal. It scratched lazily at the disturbance, then went back to sleep. “He’s just lazy. I could name him Ronald,” he teased.</p>
<p>“Yeah?” said Ron in mock-belligerence. “Then I’ll name mine, hey, what’s Harry short for, Harry? Harrison, or Harold?”</p>
<p>“You know,” said Harry, pondering the question. “I don’t know. No one’s ever called me anything but Harry. Dumbledore would know, I should think, or Sirius or Remus.” He shrugged. “Any of the professors, I guess.” It bothered him a little, even though it was something he had never thought of before. “Imagine, not knowing my own name.” It was a very unsettling moment, but it passed when Ron’s jarvey, unsatisfied with it’s cage, ran up his arm and into his clothing. Harry laughed heartily with the rest as Ron crashed about, trying to dislodge the ferret-like creature from the inside of his robes. By the time class settled down again, the mood of unease had fled.</p>
<p>After the last class of the day, Harry was tired, content to sit doing his homework by the Gryffindor Common Room fire. Breena moved to share a table with him, but they worked in companionable silence for a time.</p>
<p>“What do you want to do when you graduate, Harry?” she asked suddenly. Harry and Ron had asked this of each other so often that Harry didn’t think before he answered her.</p>
<p>“Play Quidditch for England.” The truth of his words hit him a moment too late, and it left him gasping. That was what he had wanted for his life, but it wasn’t possible now. In those words, his world shifted just that much. He would have to re-evaluate a few things in his life. He knew that the goals of a fifteen year-old boy were fluid things, but that made the loss no less real. Even blinded, that goal had not left him. To play Quidditch, in front of a crowd like that at the World Cup, it had been his dream from that first match, all the way back in his first year. To play, like his dad. “Well,” he said finally, aware of Breena’s discomfiture at his side. “I guess I don’t know what I’ll do.”</p>
<p>“Well,” she said, rallying. “I want to be a doctor. I’ve wanted to be one ever since I was a little kid. I just like to help people.”</p>
<p>“You’ll be great at that,” Harry said, smiling as he reached over to find and pat her hand. “I know you will.”</p>
<p>“Aww...” came Fred’s voice from behind them. “How sweet!”</p>
<p>“Harry and Breena.” George joined in the friendly teasing.</p>
<p>“Sitting in a tree.”</p>
<p>“Not you, too, Ron!” bellowed Harry, although he did not contest their allegations. “Maybe Breena and I should go somewhere private to study.” He closed his books. “Like the Quidditch Pitch. I want to fly, right now. We can study later, eh, Bree?” His tone made light of it, but flying was more important to him than ever. Which is why, ten minutes later, he was aloft, the wind in his face washing lost dreams out of his mind.</p>
