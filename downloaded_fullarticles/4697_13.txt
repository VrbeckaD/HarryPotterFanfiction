    <p>
  <span>The train let out a loud vibration and billowed a more than healthy amount of smog-even for an old fashioned train. I smiled at my parents and signed </span>
  <em>
    <span>I love you! Goodbye, Mother, Father,</span>
  </em>
  <span> before I ran onto the train, giving the conductor my letter from Hogwarts, he said something and then pointed for me to move along. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I jumped a bit as the train lurched forward, not knowing what I was meant to do, I walked further and further into the bowels of the trian. I glanced at each compartment that I went by, each seemed to be full of Second Year and up students, as well as their younger siblings. I was almost to the back of the train when I finally got to a compartment that had one girl sitting in it, she was already in her Hogwarts uniform, which concerned me at first, seeing as all the others that I had run into that had their uniforms were returning students.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I knocked on the door, praying to all of the African gods and goddesses that I could remember that she would not reject me for being a freak, if she could hear my knock at all. I assumed that I had either knocked just loud enough, or too loud as her head whipped around I saw a wheelchair leaning up against the window and I smiled, there was a lesser chance that I would get rejected if she too was disabled. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I took a pad and quill out of my pockets, seeing as I was still in my jeans and wrote, </span>
  <em>
    <span>May I come in? </span>
  </em>
  <span>The letters looked like scratches from the bird that was currently perched on my shoulder. She nodded and made a gesture to the wheelchair. I smirked, the only smile that I seemed capable of, and opened the sliding glass door. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I placed my suitcase on the rack and picked Deimos off of the bag before shutting the door on the poor bird. Phobos shifted and nuzzled his mate. I smiled and sat down, facing the other girl. She said something into her hand and I huffed, rolling my eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I clapped my hands, catching her attention, I pulled out the pad and paper. </span>
  <em>
    <span>What did you say? I am deaf I cannot hear you. </span>
  </em>
  <span>I wrote quickly. Though it still looked as if Phobos had written it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The pale haired girl nodded in realization, she lifted her hands up, looking at the ceiling, she slowly signed, </span>
  <em>
    <span>I know not all sign language. Can understand more than show.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>I beamed, signing to her, </span>
  <em>
    <span>Thank Shango! I was worried I would have to write on pad and paper my entire time. What is your name? I am Inyoka.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Nala,</span>
  </em>
  <span> she signed back, slow with her letters. A smirk slid across my chapped lips once again as I stuck out my hand, she took it, squeezing so hard that it hurt. I grimaced and then flopped down next to her, removing my ravens from my shoulder. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I glanced over at Nala, who was writing something on the pad and paper that I had dropped earlier. When she handed it over to me. I looked at her and then back to the paper a time or two, rather confused about what she wanted me to do. “Read it.” she mouthed. I nodded and then glanced down at the perfect cursive writing.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Are those your birds?</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Yes.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Where did you get them from?</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>My mother was a bird charmer. I got them for my ninth birthday. Their names are Phobos and Deimos.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>That’s so cool! Do you know why they’re cuddling?</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>They’re mates.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Cool again. Were you always deaf? If you don’t mind me asking.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I don’t mind. No, I wasn’t always deaf. It started off with bad hearing, and then I slowly just lost the ability to hear.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>That’s really sad. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>What about you?</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>What?</span>
  </em>
</p><p><em><span>The wheelchair is yours right?</span></em><em><span><br/></span></em> <em><span>Oh. That. Yeah. I was in an accident when I was a baby. Shattered all the bones in my legs.</span></em></p><p> </p><p>
  <span>~~~</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I trailed my long, nimble fingers through my corn-rowed hair, making the jewels that had been braided into them bang together, thus making the corn-rows swish back and forth. I took a deep breath in through my nose and then opened my eyes, hoping that no one had been talking to me while I calmed my nerves. My eyes darted to the student who had been standing next to me, coincidentally, it was the same girl from the train.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I chewed on my bottom lip and stood on my tiptoes, trying to see over the other students, thus I would be able to read the Headmistress’s lips. There was a very large male in front of me, making it so I could not see anything in front of him, my shoulders slumped.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I just stayed and waited for someone around me to move so that I could move closer to see what was happening. The room was silent, it was always silent to me, but there was no buzzing of noise at that moment, a girl in a wheelchair nudged my leg, pointing at the stool, I sighed and walked up to the chair, signing </span>
  <em>
    <span>I’m sorry. I’m deaf.</span>
  </em>
  <span> To Professor McGonagall. She tilted her head to the side and I just let the breath escape from my lips.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I shook my head and hopped onto the stool, waiting for the hat to be placed on my head. There was a buzzing sensation when it was placed atop my hair that were laced with emeralds. I looked at the floor and then glanced at my tie, watching it as turned into Slytherin colors. My lips tugged into a smirk and I hopped off of the stool, going to stand with the other chosen First-years. I watched as the girl from the train, I believe she said her name was Nala Solana, pulled herself onto the stool.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The hat shouted something that I could not hear, per the usual, and she beamed. Getting off of the stool, she wheeled over to me, her mouth moving in words that I could not understand. I held up one of my dark fingers, pointing at my ear and signing, </span>
  <em>
    <span>Slow down!</span>
  </em>
  <span> She smiled and began to talk slower. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I got into Gryffindor,” she pointed to her tie and then looked up at me with a smile, “We could be flatmates!” I nodded vigorously and giggled mentally as a smirk tugged at my lips. Someone backed into Nala, it would make sense, seeing as her eyes were pointed at the floor. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>My friend’s brow furrowed and she exclaimed, her eyebrows furrowing with anger. The girl that she had run into apologized and then paled, I could see her breath quicken, her hands began to move down to where the folds of her skirt were. I placed my calloused hand on Nala’s shoulder. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her hair, had it not been cut to around her ears, would have hit me in the face with how fast she turned. I shook my head and she sucked in her cheeks, muttering what I assumed was an apology to the girl she had just been yelling at. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you want help?” someone asked me in my head, I turned and jumped back when I saw the charms teacher, Professor Lovegood, she had a slight smile on her lips as she pulled out her wand. “Hold out your hands.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I did so and she placed her wand on my hand and muttered a spell, that I could not hear. The spell wrapped around my hands and then they felt warm, I furrowed my brow with confusion. </span>
  <em>
    <span>What did you do to my hands? </span>
  </em>
  <span>I signed. My mouth fell open when the words that I had signed float into the air, spelling out the letters, one by one. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I cast a translation charm on your hands, it’s generally used for delegates coming from other countries, but I’ve seen it done on people who use sign language. I’m glad it worked for you, remember to watch out for Plexuses in your bed!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I beamed and thanked the teacher, feeling butterflies go off in my stomach as I watched the words flutter around in front of me ‘til I waved them away. I looked back at the Headmistress and waited for her to tell us who are roommates would be. </span>
</p><p><span>When the last of the students were finally sorted she called for all the students. “Gryffindors to the South, Slytherins to the North, Ravenclaws to the East and Hufflepuffs to the West please!” she shouted at the students, who followed her orders, though they stumbled over each other quite a bit before they finally ended up where they were supposed to be.</span><span><br/></span> <span>“You will have one of every other house as your flatmates for the rest of your time at Hogwarts, so you better learn to get along with each other!” Professor McGonagall warned before she placed the blood red stone that she had placed in the palm of her hand in the middle of the students.</span></p><p>
  <span>Red light shot out from the stone and scanned all of the students. I inhaled sharply through my nose and then jolted forward, I smirked when I noticed that Nala and I were being pulled closer together. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>When the sensation faded I noticed that there were two others around us, one of them was the girl from before who had been sorted into Hufflepuff, she looked almost as nervous as before, but she was now with a girl who was sorted into Ravenclaw. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Introductions?</span>
  </em>
  <span> I signed with a small smile. </span>
  <em>
    <span>I am Inyoka Sasanata.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m Nala Sonala,” Nala said, sticking out her hand, she did not do this to me, as we had met on the train before the sorting. The Ravenclaw took the hand and said something that I could understand, seeing as her lips were moving too fast.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nala turned to me and mouthed, “Jace Webster,” and then turned to the girl that they had run into earlier, she also muttered something that I could not understand, so Nala translated, “Enna Baldwin.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I smirked, slightly happy that I was finally at Hogwarts.</span>
