    <p>The aftermath (Muggle/mundane)</p>
<p>09:35 Monday 1st July 1991 – Avon &amp; Somerset Police HQ, Portishead.</p>
<p>Detective Sergeant Alexander Seawoll was not happy, and when DS Seawoll was unhappy the rest of the detective pool got out of his way. He was a good thief taker but, at times, bulls and china shops would seem to be just a minor blip. Today was one of those days. It was bad enough that, with the escaped boa constrictor still missing after a week’s searching, the uniform division had just decided it was no longer an accidental escape but must have been an organised crime. They therefore promptly shifted it off their list, dumping the mystery onto the detectives in CID to solve. Given his Sergeant’s previous excellent clear up rate Seawoll’s boss had therefore equally promptly passed it a further link down the chain to said DS. </p>
<p>The snake case, however, was not the prime cause of Alexander’s angst. No, his current feeling of general disgruntlement was because of the upcoming announcement as to whether or not he had passed his recent Inspector’s assessment. He was confident he would have passed the Board, that wasn’t being big headed he was good at his job so expected to pass, it was that passing would ease one decision, but create another. </p>
<p>His dilemma was that he was aware that several of his colleagues had already passed the Board. Unless he applied for a transfer to another force the chances of actually getting promoted into an Inspector’s position in Bristol, or anywhere else in the Avon &amp; Somerset region for that matter, were slim. Making the decision to apply for the transfer would be easy, the dilemma would be choosing whether to head back north, where he would be most at home, or apply to the Met’ and head for London where the best job prospects should be.</p>
<p>As he reread the case file for the third time Seawoll could see this missing snake case was going to be a challenge. He had yet to discover just how much of a challenge it would prove to be, or just how deep would be the scars it would soon burn into his psyche. He’d been back in the general CID office for about twenty minutes since the Detective Inspector had handed him (lumbered him with) the case and, as far as Seawoll could see, it was just not making sense. </p>
<p>He called over to DC Jennifer Trym and, despite his time in the West Country, his booming Lancastrian tones filled the room, “You free Jenny? Come and take a skeg* at this.” Jenny decided that heading over when he was in this mood was better than the alternative and, anyway, the stolen car theft she was working on was going nowhere fast. She grabbed her coffee and walked over. </p>
<p>“So what we’ve got is this,” Alexander outlined, and began to show her the few, and rather blurry, CCTV recordings**. “the picture quality may be crap but it is obvious that one of that group of three boys seems to be harmlessly watching the snake” he pointed at the screen and also looked down at the file to check on the names, “Harry Potter his name is. Look, there, see, the snake is is just lying there, I bet it was bored out of its skull, as we all would be stuck in that tank, but Harry’s not doing anything. Then now, watch, see how the snake gets agitated, starts waggling about a bit, and the other boys come over.”<br/>
He stopped the film briefly to check his notes again before carrying on,<br/>
“See, now, that one, the scrawny one, Piers Polkiss his name is, he calls over that fat one, Dudley Dursley, and then look - the glass just disappears. None of them did anything untoward, we can’t even think about doing them for criminal damage, but where does the glass go? There’s only a few people around, the two who brought the boys and a handful of others and again look, Jenny, see how the glass goes and every bit of CCTV kit fails at exactly the same time. We can’t track the snake it’s not on film!”</p>
<p>Jenny looked at him with a smile, “You’re from Lancashire aren’t you Sir - sure you’ve not brought the Pendle Witches down with you?”<br/>
Seawoll spluttered for a second, was about to yell, then realised she was joking, relaxed, and started laughing for the first time in a few days. Magic was definitely something he thought impossible. His bullying older sister had shaped his attitude to women in several ways during his childhood, her argument that if witchcraft existed, and the alleged witches had really been witches then they wouldn’t have been caught, made sense. They had both missed the point; despite the best efforts of the church and state, no real witches were ever arrested, let alone brought to trial!</p>
<p>“Seriously though Sir, joking aside, I agree we do have to wonder where the glass went. It’s not as if people carry a dustpan and brush around with them on the off chance is it? Do you reckon the DI will give us expenses to visit the boys and the Dursleys to do a re-interview? I’ll be up for a run out to Surrey if you are.” </p>
<p>Jenny, of course knew full well where the snake had ended up; as, in her own small way, she’d actually helped it escape, not that she was going to mention anything about that. She was ambitious. She had her hopes set on getting the DS’s job when Seawoll got promoted the situation everyone, bar Seawoll himself, was anticipating; unfortunately for Jenny there was a snag - she hadn’t yet grasped the fact there was a promotion bottleneck.</p>
<p>“Good point Jenny”, Seawoll continued, “and there’s another thing that doesn’t fit. Looking through this file it doesn’t look as though uniform did any follow up interviews, or if they did do some then they’ve all gone astray. All we have is a few interview notes and field jottings made on the day, the CCTV footage such as it is, plus the logs of security team searches in the Zoo and surrounding area looking for the snake.”<br/>
Jenny then noticed something else that was missing.<br/>
“Just a thought Sir. Do you remember that weird London team that turned up on the Sunday evening, where are their Animal Welfare reports? We have received nothing from them, and they are not showing up in our Inter-Force contacts directory - I think you are right, Sir, it does justify a trip to Surrey.”<br/>
This was the first time in her career that anything regarding her other life as a minor river goddess had come remotely close to her police work, if the trail was heading towards Surrey, and therefore away for her own catchment area, anything she could do, or say, to help steer it that way was a bonus.</p>
<p>13:25 Monday 1st  July – Avon &amp; Somerset Police HQ, Portishead.</p>
<p>By this point in the afternoon Seawoll’s temper was at boiling point. Before lunch he’d asked his Inspector for permission to go with Jenny up to Little Whinging to carry out the interviews uniform hadn’t bothered to do. He’d been polite, quoted facts simply and logically, and been quickly rebuffed. A calm refusal stating operational grounds and other priorities for his time here in Bristol he could have understood and would have accepted. What had wound him up was being interrupted by his line Inspector before he’d even begun to properly explain why they needed to go to Surrey and told “There’s no effing money for effing joy rides for effing jumped up junior officers so why don’t you just eff off back to your effing desk and solve the effing case from what you’ve effing well already got!”<br/>
After a startled pause, as this outburst was even more extreme than the DI's usual outbursts, Seawoll had simply turned to the door and, as he began to leave, also heard his boss add a follow up “Send Surrey a request to effing well do it for us, and don’t effing well think you can override me even if you have passed your effing Board exam.” </p>
<p>15:11 Monday 1st  July – Avon &amp; Somerset Police HQ, Portishead.</p>
<p>Luckily as the afternoon wore on Seawoll calmed down enough to get Jenny to ring the local police station at Staines and she managed to successfully arrange for them to go out in the next few days and do a re-interview. </p>
<p>That calming down had paid off when he received the summons mid-afternoon to go to the Personnel Department on the first floor and get his promotion board results. Not only had he passed also with it was an offer from the Met to take up an Acting DI position should he require it.</p>
<p>When he got back to his desk, still with a rare smile on his face, his colleagues all saw instantly that he’d passed. What they hadn’t seen was his earlier sidle into the Gents toilets and make a two handed ‘fist pump’ accompanied by the triple exclamation of - “YES! YESS! YEESSSSS!”</p>
<p>Luck was on Jenny’s side as it was DC Fred Murray who asked the blindingly obvious “You passed then boss”<br/>
“Yes Fred, drinks will be on me tonight. Got an offer from the Met too – immediate Acting DI. I’ve not accepted yet but, if you ask me honestly, I guess I’ll be leaving soon.”</p>
<p>Jenny already knew he had passed, and that he’d got the offer from the Met, her acting skills had been extended to the ultimate for the last couple of days. She’d had nothing to do with the exam result, he’d won that pass on his merits, but, as for the transfer, after all what’s the point of being a River Goddess if you can’t sometimes manipulate and tweak things behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Unbeknownst to Seawoll, or to any of her other work colleagues of any rank, once Jenny had known the snake case was going to create problems with a clash between her work and river life she’d been trying to get Seawoll off the case. She recognised his talents as the only detective in the area likely to come even close to cracking the puzzle. </p>
<p>It was fortunate that she knew Ash Thames well enough to be able ask him to set up a meeting with Old Father Thames himself. After just a bit of grovelling on her part, he’d told her to leave it with him to sort out. Jenny never did find out how things had been manipulated but on Friday she just knew they’d been sorted, and that there was unlikely to be anything to worry about. Today, she’d found out what had been arranged and that she now owed the Thames clan several major favours.</p>
