    <p>
  <span>“Is it comfortable up in that tree?” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Jack doesn’t react to the question when he hears it. Why would he? It’s not as if she could be talking to him after all. No one talks to him. No one can see him. It’s been centuries - over two hundred years, closer to three hundred - and he has yet to find a person who can see him. So he doesn’t react. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh, you aren’t wearing shoes either. I dislike shoes - even when the nargles don’t steal them I don’t like wearing them. It’s easier for the earth to speak to you without them you know.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>At that he glances down out of curiosity. Who is she talking to? He is out in the middle of what is called the Forbidden Forest. No students are supposed to be out here. Not that that stops them by any means. If anything the name is more of an invitation than a warning. It is for Jack. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>But when he looks down she is looking straight at him. It sends a chill through him that has nothing to do with the weather. He is a winter spirit after all. The cold is his thing, right along with the snow he can form with a mere thought and the wind he can talk to. But her pale blue eyes seem to go right through him. Like she sees him and more. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She appears to look at him expectantly, as if waiting for an answer. The ever dreaded, but ever present hope bubbles up in him. Every time, every time it seems as if someone can finally see him, it rears up. No matter how much it hurts, it always comes back. Hope is funny like that. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>So it’s no real surprise when he finds himself asking, “Are you talking to me?” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Who else would I be talking to?” she asks, “There isn’t anyone else around - not even the fizzabees.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Jack - well he has no idea what a fizzabee is, but he doesn’t care. He jumps down from his branch, hardly daring to believe it. “You can - you can </span>
  <em>
    <span>see me</span>
  </em>
  <span>?!” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She nods, smiling. “Hello.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Jack lets out a whoop of joy, letting the wind pick him up. It spins him round and round the girl. She sees him. She </span>
  <em>
    <span>sees him</span>
  </em>
  <span>. After all these centuries, finally someone who sees him. He couldn’t keep from grinning wildly if he tried. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She watches him calmly, waiting until he lands back in front of her. “You must be lonely,” she says solemnly, “I know what that is like. Not many people talk to me either. But it’s gotten better this year. I have friends.” Her smile is bright and happy. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>There’s something both terribly sad and terribly innocent about that. Jack can relate. “No one has talked to me since the Man in the Moon told me my name.” Not really talked anyways, not taken the time to stop and introduce themselves. Or get to know him. He knows there are others around - Santa, the Easter Kangaroo, the Sandman, the Tooth Fairy and her tiny minions, minor and major names all. But they have never bothered with him, even when he did see them. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“My name is Luna Lovegood,” she holds out her hand for him to shake. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m Jack. Jack Frost,” he stutters over in excitement. He is still vibrating with joy. This seems almost too good to be true. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Jack Frost nipping at my nose?” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He laughs. “More like Jack Frost giving you a massive snow storm.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh, yes, that sounds nice. Scotland is the perfect place for that. You must like it here.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He nods. Scotland is a great place to be in winter. All the northern countries are. They expect the snow he brings. Instead of cursing it they accept it and go on through it. Not all, but their kind of winter is always his favorite. And he can admit that he likes it here for another reason. The magic. He loves the magic of the school, the way it fills the air and brings life to everything around it. It’s a wonder. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Would you like to meet the thestrals?” Luna asks, “I was on my way there now. Sophia just birthed her new foal last week.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yeah, sure,” Jack agrees quickly, before she can change her mind. Before she can leave. He would have agreed to just about anything to spend more time with Luna right now. He isn’t ready to go back to being invisible, not yet. Not so soon. He has no idea what a thestral is either, but that doesn’t matter. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She leads the way through the winding path clearly made by animal and not human feet. Jack follows, swinging his staff as he walks - or rather skips - along. His happiness is probably bordering on obnoxious, but he doesn’t care. It feels as if he can barely contain the joy inside of him. Like it is just waiting to burst out into the air around them. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Luna hums as she walks, a nonsensical tune. There’s no rhyme or reason to it, but it fits the mood. They step around the next turn and stop at a clearing filled with - well, thestrals obviously. Jack steps back in surprise. Sure he has seen some surprising things in his near three hundred years, but these - these are. Well. He’s seen them before of course, but never close up. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Luna continues on without hesitation. Jack shakes off his surprise and follows. Around him the skeletal horses take notice, snorting and whining. They lift their heads, white eyes watching. He has to wonder if they can see him too or not. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Hello Sophia,” Luna greets one of them, stroking the leathery skin of its - her - nose, “I brought you a new friend to meet.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Jack walks over to join her. Carefully he holds out a hand. Sophia snorts into it before nudging it. Well that answers that then. Slowly he pets her nose. Her skin is cold under his hand, just like his skin. One less worry then. He’d hate to make her too cold. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“And this is Marcus,” Luna says, gently petting a foal hidden almost under Sophia’s wing. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Marcus prances out to meet him bold as you please. Jack laughs and introduces himself. Marcus snorts, approves and then moves on to play. Jack watches with a grin. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Thestrals are misunderstood creatures,” Luna tells him as they watch, “Only those that have seen death can see them. People tend to shun anything too close to death. They think that it makes it bad.” She pets another thestral that came over to greet her. She smiles. “But they are such sweet things.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Jack freezes - pun unintended - when he hears, but he forces himself to relax. Forces himself not to think about the death he has seen. The death he has inevitably caused. Winter may be fun, but it is not always safe. He never means for anything to happen, but it does anyways. No matter how he tries to prevent it, it always does. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He tries not to think about it because once he begins he can’t seem to stop. He begins to wonder if that means he is bad. Accident or not, his storms have caused death before. If the reason he is like this is some kind of punishment. If he doesn’t deserve to be ignored, shunned, after all. Tries not to because then his control over the weather really slips. Sinking too far into his dark emotions is what causes the worst of his storms. The most deadly of blizzards. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He startles when he feels a hand slip into his. “Death comes to everyone,” she says, still looking at the herd around them, “That doesn’t mean you should be afraid of it. There are some things that are out of our control, no matter how we wish otherwise.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Jack swallows and nods. He turns his attention outward again. Having Luna’s hand in his helps. It grounds him to the here and now. Laughter bubbles up again as he watches Marcus play with some of the other youngsters. They are chasing the wind as if they can see it. Who knows, they probably can. They can see Jack after all. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He itches to join in. He doesn’t - not right away at least. But he can’t resist for long, so he goes, dragging Luna along with him. She follows easily with a laugh. They dance and spin and fly. Jack lifts her off of the ground with him and twirls them around. Their laughter fills the clearing. Jack’s joy finally spills over. He focuses on the here and now, enjoying every second of this. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>An indeterminable amount of time later - both too short and forever - they collapse on their backs on the ground. Jack’s cheeks hurt from smiling. He can’t remember the last time he smiled so much. Maybe never. Above them the sky is barely visible through the branches. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It’s almost supper time,” Luna announces, getting up. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Suddenly there is a lump in Jack’s throat. He swallows his pleads for her to stay. Not to leave him. Not to abandon him like everyone else has. He has no right. She is a student, alive. She can hardly stay in the forest forever. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She seems to hear him anyways because she smiles. “Don’t worry, I’ll be back. I enjoy spending time in the forest. It’s very peaceful here. And no one else really keeps the thestrals company besides Hagrid. They aren’t his only responsibilities though. They need someone else as well.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Jack has once seen a colony of man eating spiders attack and devour what looked like some kind of large lion creature. Peaceful is not how he would describe it at all. Still it is reassuring to know that she will be back. Even if it is only for the thestrals, she </span>
  <em>
    <span>will</span>
  </em>
  <span> be back. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Maybe next time I can bring a friend too. Harry could use some more. Especially now. The nargles are bothering him even more then me. I suspect there are others at work as well. Maybe even a three eyed jackalburs. Those are among the most deadly of all.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Once again Jack has no idea what she is talking about, but he doesn’t mind. “Great,” he agrees. He has his doubts that this Harry will be able to see him, but he doesn’t say anything. Maybe another miracle will happen. He never expected Luna now did he? </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She smiles. “Goodbye Jack Frost. I will be seeing you soon.” She waves and skips off, back to the castle. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Jack grins. That didn’t sound like a promise - that sounded like a guarantee. He takes to the sky, shouting with glee. </span>
</p>
