    <p> </p>
<p>One day toward the end of Sixth Year – about a week or so after Harry had accidentally almost killed Draco – Slughorn was presiding over their potions class when he suddenly felt rather ill. Since most of the students had reached a point in their potion making in which the potion needed to be left alone to brew for a bit, the teacher told them to use the rest of their class time working on their essay, and if he wasn't back before the end of class, they could just leave when it was time.</p>
<p>This left four Ravenclaws, four Slytherins, Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ernie Macmillan on their own. Ron was the last to get his potion to the brewing stage, and when he did, Terry boot smirked at him from the Ravenclaw table.</p>
<p>“Oi, Weasley, look what I have!” He held up a packet containing several slips of paper. The packet was labeled Magical Dares.</p>
<p>“Oh no,” Ron muttered reluctantly. The packet was a product from his brothers' shop.</p>
<p>“What's that?” Ernie Macmillan asked curiously.</p>
<p>“These are papers to write magical dares on,” Terry explained, turning to grin at Padma in a way that suggested that he was trying to impress her, but she simply rolled her eyes and shook her head.</p>
<p>“I'm almost afraid to ask,” Ernie muttered warily.</p>
<p>Terry took this as the actual question and explained that: “Any dare written on one of these slips and then given to the person you wish to dare is magically BOUND to do the dare. They CAN'T chicken out!”</p>
<p>“Oh...?” Ernie questioned, more interested than he thought he'd be.</p>
<p>Hermione huffed a laugh. “It doesn't have to be stupid things! Although I'm certain you boys will write stupid things. You could always write something like: I dare you to tell the truth about something in particular, or I dare you to help me finish my potions essay.”</p>
<p>“Where's the fun in that?!” Terry asked with a snort. “It should be things like: I dare you to strip off and streak across the Quidditch Pitch!”</p>
<p>Hermione glared and growled at him. “If you DID dare that, YOU'D get expelled when the person completing the dare is brought in and forced to confess to why he or she broke so may rules so egregiously!”</p>
<p>Terry sighed reluctantly. “Fine, I agree that perhaps the dares shouldn't break rules so publicly like that.”</p>
<p>Anthony Goldstein waved a hand as if he thought he was an expert on the subject. “A dare should never be anything YOU PERSONALLY do not want to do.”</p>
<p>“Fine,” Terry agreed mildly. “Those are the rules then. Let's play a game, shall we? Everyone who wants to participate will take a slip and write a dare on it. The dare can be anything that won't get anyone expelled – or hurt them – and should not be anything you personally would not want to do. Thus, I personally will not be daring anyone to kiss any spiders – and if anyone uses that and I somehow get stuck with it, I'm hexing you all as unpleasantly as I can think up just as soon as I've finished kissing the bloody spider.”</p>
<p>“Here here!” Ron cheered in agreement.</p>
<p>Terry grinned at him. “So... you in?”</p>
<p>Ron took a deep breath, knowing full well that if he declined – considering who his brothers were – he'd never hear the end of it. “Yeah, I suppose I could stand to take a dare.”</p>
<p>“Well count me out!” Hermione muttered fervently. "I have no need to waste any time on such foolishness when I have homework to do!”</p>
<p>There was a pained sigh from across the room. “I can't <em>believe</em><span> I'm about to say this, but I agree with Granger,” Draco drawled. “I have too much bloody homework to do and not enough interest in participating in foolish dares.”</span></p>
<p>“<span>Count me in!”</span> Blaise exclaimed with a nearly evil smirk.</p>
<p>“Not me,” Padma stated firmly.</p>
<p>“Harry?” Ron asked with a look that subtly begged Harry not to let him be the only Gryffindor participating.</p>
<p>“Yeah alright,” Harry agreed with a reluctant sigh.</p>
<p>Anthony and Ernie both shrugged and decided to play while Michael Corner – the other Ravenclaw – declined. This left Nott and his fellow Slytherin undecided for a long moment before shaking their heads.</p>
<p>“Can't really see anything in it for me,” Nott informed them.</p>
<p>“Alright then!” Terry exclaimed a bit gleefully as he passed out the slips to those who agreed to play. Everyone took a minute or so to decide on their dares and write them down. Terry collected them in an empty cauldron so that no one could see the slips once they were in it.</p>
<p>Blaise was the last to add his slip to the cauldron, but the look he gave Terry as he did so sent shivers of apprehension up most everyone's spines. Terry held the cauldron up so that not even he could see in it and asked: “Who's first?”</p>
<p>No one responded for a long pause, and then Ron nudged Harry, clearly dreading being forced to be first if no one volunteered. Harry was actually sort of used to being volunteered to do things like this – such as that time in Care of Magical Creatures which ended up with him riding Buckbeak. He sighed.</p>
<p>“Yeah alright,” he agreed wearily, gesturing for Terry to bring the cauldron over.</p>
<p>Before Terry let him pick a slip, he held up a hand. “Also, no one should be allowed to say what their dare is until after it's performed. I should think half of the fun will be watching people do crazy things and having to guess what the dare was.”</p>
<p>“Yeah alright,” Harry agreed, sort of thankful that he wouldn't have to immediately tell everyone should his dare happen to be something like: grope the arse of the person on your left. He could just do it and get it over with, and then apologize profusely. He stuck his hand in the cauldron and swirled it around a few times. One slip seemed to stick to his hand, practically refusing to be let go of, so Harry shrugged and pulled it out of the cauldron.</p>
<p>His eyes bugged clear out of his head as he read the somewhat fancy script. <em>Give Draco Malfoy a blowjob until finished swallowing his spunk.</em><span> He immediately crushed the slip in his hand and shook his head.</span></p>
<p>“<span>Oh hell no! There's no way in bloody hell I'm doing that!!!” He roared before throwing the slip on the floor and casting an Incendio on it.</span></p>
<p>
  <span>Terry laughed while Ron chuckled weakly. “Sorry mate,” Ron said. “They're magically binding. You HAVE to. You won't be able to stop yourself.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry threw his forehead into the palm of his hand and groaned pathetically. “Why me???” He bit his lips together and clutched the worktable to stop himself from doing anything as he watched everyone else pick their slips.</span>
</p>
<p>“<span>Yes!” Ron hissed happily. “This could have been so much worse! I won't actually mind doing this...”</span></p>
<p>
  <span>Harry positively </span>
  <em>glared</em>
  <span> at him.</span>
</p>
<p>Ernie Macmillan paled and shook a little as he stood up and walked over to Padma. Then he gave her something that looked a cross between a smile and a grimace. “Hi...” he greeted before leaning over and kissing her quite thoroughly.</p>
<p>She made a sound of protest for a moment before shrugging and surrendering to the kiss.</p>
<p>Ron gave Hermione a brilliant grin. “I think you're brilliant. Best witch I've ever met.”</p>
<p>Hermione quirked a brow at him. “Was your dare to tell someone a truth you don't *think* they already know?”</p>
<p>He shook his head. “Nope, it was to give a girl in this class a sincere compliment.”</p>
<p>Harry was inexplicably fascinated to see that Ernie and Padma were still at it, and Terry was positively SEETHING as he watched them. Clearly, he had been hoping for that dare. Harry also had to guess that Ron's dare had been written be Ernie – as only a Hufflepuff – or maybe a girl in general – would have come up with such fluffy dare.</p>
<p>His body was now shaking from the effort of suppressing his magically bound urge to drag Draco away and do as dared. Ron was clearly wondering what Harry had been dared to do – since Harry probably looked about ready to vomit – and patted him on the back in commiseration. Unfortunately, this unbalanced Harry and made him lose his grip on the table.</p>
<p>Before he could say a word or take a breath, he was up and marching to the front of the room where Draco sat with his brethren. Almost certain that his face was making the same expression it would make if he was in front of a firing squad, Harry grabbed Draco firmly by his arm and yanked him off his stool. THANK MERLIN that he had enough control to drag him to the storage cupboard.</p>
<p>“Potter! What in the bloody hell are you doing?! Let me go! Let me – I swear I will hex your grimy barbarian hand clean off if you do not – urgh!” Draco's indignant litany was cut short when Harry threw him again the shelves so that he could shut and lock the door with locking spells that not even Hermione could unlock.</p>
<p>Harry pressed his head to his hand again and prayed for a miracle.</p>
<p>“What the fuck are you doing?!” Draco demanded, holding his wand at the ready to hex Harry. To his utter shock, Harry dropped to his knees and looked up at Draco with such pleading in his eyes that Draco forgot all about his plan to hex the infuriating git. “Er...”</p>
<p>“Please murder before I have to do this,” Harry begged.</p>
<p>“Do what?” Draco asked with a deep curiosity that he just couldn't suppress.</p>
<p>Groaned reluctantly, Harry reached out and unfastened Draco's trouser – since his school robes were already hanging open.</p>
<p>Draco's mouth dropped open in surprise. “Wha...?”</p>
<p>Rather than explain what must be obvious by this point, Harry simply pulled the long and semi erect shaft out through the opening in the silk black pants that were as soft as a cloud. He gave it a few good tugs to help it finish getting hard, and then dove right into a task he had NEVER even considered trying before. Both his head and his hands bobbed back and forth with a firm and somewhat rough pressure.</p>
<p>Draco gasped and then stuttered: “Wait! But! But!” Quite abruptly, his knees seemed to go weak and he slumped against the shelf. “Merlin's crooked prick! That feels so good!”</p>
<p>Harry had no idea why he was so chuffed to hear that. He could only assume that if he HAD to do something like this, he'd hate to be terrible at it. That would just make the mortification all the worse when he was done and Draco strutted out of the room to complain that not only had Harry molested and mouth raped him, but that he was so bad at it that Draco couldn't even enjoy it. Or something like that.</p>
<p>Draco's legs started to shake and he had to grip the shelf behind his hips in order to remain upright. “Merlin, fuck! Salazar! Potter, if you don't stop, I'm going to – to –” he was cut short by a groan of sheer pleasure. His bollocks tightened as a feeling like electricity went up his spine. His toes even curled!</p>
<p>Harry hummed in understanding and held his breath as he mentally prepared for the second half of his dare. When it happened, it was hot and acrid, but not enough to make him gag. In fact, it was sort of salty with a hint of something undefinable that Harry inexplicably liked. He kept sucking and swallowing until every last drop was gone. Then he probed the puffy little slit with his tongue in a search for more.</p>
<p>Feeling like his toes were going to curl right up his legs and into his arse if Harry didn't stop, Draco yanked him to his feet and stared at him with wide eyes for a long moment, trying to think of <em>anything</em><span> to say. When words failed him, he pulled Harry closer and snogged him. Of its own accord, one of his hands slid down and freed Harry's thick and rigidly erect shaft.</span></p>
<p>
  <span>It just seemed like the thing to do at a time like this – giving Harry an orgasm in return. Using all the techniques Draco like to use on himself, that hand full of long fingers soon had Harry moaning into Draco's mouth and holding onto him for dear life. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry had no idea why, but he was turned on more than he'd ever been! He was so hard he could probably hammer nails if he had to! He felt a shockwave pass through him, making him arch into Draco to avoid falling off his feet. Suddenly he was squealing very softly as a tidal wave flowed from him, splashing everything.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>After a moment, that sinful hand stilled and Harry slumped so that his head was resting on Draco's chest.</span>
</p>
<p>“<span>So, erm... we should probably get cleaned up...” Draco pointed out at least a full minute later, sounding relaxed and almost happy.</span></p>
<p>“<span>Right,” Harry agreed because there was nothing else to say. They separated, neither able to look at the other as they cast cleaning spells and put themselves away.</span></p>
<p>
  <span>When ready, Harry scratched the back of his neck and wondered if he should say anything. An apology seemed appropriate, but at the same time, he had a feeling Draco would hex him if he even tried. Rather than say anything, Harry decided to simply unlock the door.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>As they were quietly walking out of the cupboard, both fervently prayed that class had ended and everyone else had left. But no such luck! All ten other classmates were staring at the door expectantly.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry blushed and looked away. This wasn't entirely unusual as Harry was often embarrassed enough to blush – even over little things – but the real incriminating evidence was when </span>
  <em>Draco</em>
  <span> also blushed and looked away before sort of covering the side of his face with a hand and marching over to gather up his books and shove them in his bag.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Blaise was giving him a smugly </span>
  <em>knowing</em>
  <span> look.</span>
</p>
<p>Everyone else looked astonished bordering on downright gobsmacked. Ron and Hermione were even gaping at him. Suddenly, Terry burst out with: “Bloody hell! If I'd known that <em>shagging</em><span> was a valid dare, I would have dared myself to shag – erm, nevermind...”</span></p>
<p>
  <span>Harry once more wished that someone would murder him on the spot. Rather than say anything – or even gather up his belongings – Harry simply whirled around and fled from the dungeon.</span>
