<p>The smell of meat disgusted him.</p>
<p>That in itself was not surprising. It was only a week before the full moon, and his senses were sharpened to the point of sickness. The light stung his eyes, the acrid smoke of the potions inflamed his throat<b>.</b> He couldn't even attend herbology class since they were studying mandrakes, their piercing screams made him pass out despite wearing earmuffs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>No. Really. It was exhausting.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>But the worst part was the smell of meat.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Dining in the Great Hall had become a burden, even away from the table. He smelled it, behind the greasy sauces, this toxic stench which was forced down his throat and permeated his clothes.</p>
<p>So gross.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>A chain of sausages created by the summoning charm of a third-year passed under his nose and made him gag, his hands dropping his cutlery to cover his mouth.</p>
<p>No. He was definitely not okay.</p>
<p>‘’Remus?’’</p>
<p>Bending over the table, Peter was staring at him with little round eyes.</p>
<p>‘’Remus, are you alright?’’</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>‘’Yes.’’</p>
<p>They were too far apart for Remus to sniff him out. But he was sure Peter stank too. He'd seen him stuffing his face with roast beef during dinner. The mere thought made him nauseous and he got up awkwardly, grabbing his robe while fleeing from his friend's gaze.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>‘’I just... I just need to take a walk outside.’’</p>
<p>And without giving Peter time to answer, he staggered away from the Gryffindor table.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The weak candlelight gave him the impression of having blurred sight as violent shivers ran down his spine. He knew he had to go to the infirmary. He knew he had to see Madam Pomfrey.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Yet, his footsteps carried him in the opposite direction.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>His whole body was ordering him to get out of the castle.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>_________________________<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The closer he got to the exit, the more he smelled them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The heady scents from outside.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>He had taken the passage behind one of the portraits on the 4th floor, to not be noticed. Heads had turned his way as he left the Great Hall, especially those from Slytherin. With them, a marauder alone was never safe.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>A draft caressed his sweat-soaked face, and for a few seconds, he felt invigorated. Accelerating his pace, he finally came out of the underground passage, landing in the boathouse right by the lake.</p>
<p>It had rained, and everything was glittering now. Remus gazed out over the small rowboats that were suspended or moored, closing his eyes to breathe deeply the smell of old wood that emanated from them. He felt like he was healing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The setting sun bathed the lake in an orange, autumnal light, in harmony with the intoxicating aromas that now tickled his nostrils.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Moss, pine needles, petrichor and geosmin.</p>
<p>The Gryffindor walked for a while along the shores of the lake, nose to the wind, before finally making his way back to the castle. He could distinguish in the air a resinous odor, strong perfumes which diverted him from the path. He was surprised to find himself climbing the rocks. His fingers were slippery against the wet stones. His lips grazed the granite and a metallic taste filled his mouth.</p>
<p>It was nice, feeling cold while sliding across the rocks.</p>
<p>He climbed for a long time before smelling the undergrowth and its bark fragrances again. Hurrying, he left the rocks and moved towards what seemed to be a small pond at the top of a mound, not far from the quidditch field. The trees that framed it had already lost their leaves, creating a skillful painting of red and amber around the water.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>His legs bent by themselves, making him fall to his knees before he laid on his stomach, chin and hands in the mud, his nose resting on the lichens whose woody notes made his head spin.</p>
<p>Slowly his lips curled, his teeth gnawed at the surface. The moss took hold of his tongue, and he straightened up, rubbing it against his palate.</p>
<p>
  <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>
</p>
<p>It was exquisite.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He heard voices in the distance. A group of students - he thought he recognized the blue uniform of the Ravenclaws - was walking towards the stadium, broomsticks in hand. One of them raised his head in his direction and stopped.</p>
<p>Damn. Had he seen him?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>His instincts told him to throw himself to the ground and this time he ended up landing in the pond, the icy water flooding his face. He yelped, letting a few bubbles of air rise to the surface before holding his breath.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>No one was supposed to see him. Not like that. Not in that state.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>It was his moment.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>He waited as long as he could, the water soaked his clothes until it came to freeze his arms, shoulders, and ribs. He shivered, his nose buried in the dirt. Then his whole body trembled but he didn't dare get up.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>It was only when his lungs were empty that he stood up, suffocating, his eyes fixed on the branches of the trees. He hesitated for a moment before glancing back towards the lawn.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The students had disappeared. He was alone again. Wet and cold, but alone.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>He breathed a sigh of relief. His body weighed by the water, he laid down again into the pond, his hands supporting his head. The icy wave made him sleepy, his temples throbbed as his eyes dreamily observed the concentric ripples forming around him. His belly was too warm compared to the rest of his body, and he eventually amended this by taking a small sip of chilled water. It had the taste and color of clay.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>A few curious tadpoles came to visit him, rubbing against his lips. Remus stared at them for a long time, motionless, before finally gently opening his mouth, letting the larvae pass between his teeth to taste his gums. He felt their flabby bodies against his tongue and the inside of his cheeks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>So exciting.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>His jaws contracted sharply, crushing them before swallowing everything.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Woods have their timeless tastes and smells. It is the only place that still makes you understand that Man comes from Nature.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Sooner or later, He will return home.</p>
<p>______________________________________________________________________________<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Seeing him smile awakened all sorts of sordid feelings in James.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>He wasn't supposed to be this happy. Not with what happened this morning in potions class. Not after the humiliation he and Sirius had put him through.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>----------<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Remus had been unable to attend Slughorn's test, leaving them in a panic in front of their cauldron. Usually, he'd get behind them with Peter to help with their preparations,minimizing the damage. But today, the two best friends had found themselves completely lost, and soon their potion turned into a revolting mush that eventually burst in their faces to the greatest delight of the Slytherins. Severus Snape, in particular, was quick to burst out laughing and threw acidic remarks in their faces, in an infuriating way only he knew how.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>‘’Say that again and I'll drown you in it, Snivellus!’’ barked Sirius, scowling at him.</p>
<p>Snape replied with a sly smile.</p>
<p>‘’It seems that when the brain of the gang isn't here, it's immediately a mess. And I thought you and Potter were the leaders. Why isn't Lupin here, by the way? Is he sick again? Don't you think it's your stupidity that's exhausting him? If that’s the case you'll surely end up killing him.’’</p>
<p>‘’SnivelIus! I swear I'm going to…’'</p>
<p>Sirius's threats were interrupted by Slughorn, who was coming out of the storeroom with vials in his hands.</p>
<p>“Come on, children!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I can hear you shouting from over there, what's that-”</p>
<p>His nose wrinkled, sniffing the air for a moment before he looked for the cause of the foul smell that was spreading in the dungeon. He finally came upon James and Sirius, covered with the viscous liquid.</p>
<p>‘’Merlin's beard! It's abominable!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>How could you have failed that potion so dreadfully? From the smell alone I can tell you that none and I mean none, of the ingredients are correctly used!’’</p>
<p>‘’I'm sorry, Professor,’’ tried James, ’’If you give us another chance…’'</p>
<p>‘’Oh, no. I think you've done enough for today, no more brewing and certainly no magic. Here, there are mops in the back of the classroom so please, be nice and clean up this mess.’’</p>
<p>Sniggers were heard from all over the classroom and James thought he saw Slughorn sneer for a few seconds. Sirius blushed with anger.</p>
<p>‘’Damned snakes.’’ He whispered to himself.</p>
<p>Both had to get up and walk across the room. James looked up at Evans and saw that the girl was laughing at him too. It was his turn to turn red, a deep sense of shame filling him. And to top it all, Snape threw them mocking glances as Slughorn complimented his concoction.</p>
<p>‘’Look at him’’ James whispered to Sirius, ‘’I'm sure the bastard made the best potion.’’</p>
<p>It wouldn't be a surprise, he excelled at it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Sirius seemed disgusted, staring at Snape, his desk, the shelves next to it, before his face lit up. James knew that expression too well. He had an idea.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>‘’What do you suggest, Padfoot?’’</p>
<p>His friend didn't even answer, his wand already discreetly pointed at the racks. He cast a spell, just a tiny, silent spell that barely moved the overloaded boxes on the top shelf. Boxes that tumbled down, taking with them the lower levels, all covered with all kinds of ingredients that eventually fell into the Slytherin's cauldron. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>First, there was a strange light, then an explosion and finally flames. They were bright blue, big, beautiful, glittering.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>And they were devouring the body of their nemesis.</p>
<p>He was struggling, screaming, frantically starting to take off his uniform in front of the class.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The students were pushing each other in all directions, forming a tumultuous mob.</p>
<p>Slughorn shouted, wand in hand, trying to extinguish the flames that seemed to only attack Snape, sparing the furniture and his classmates.</p>
<p>Sirius tried to grab James' wrist and drag him across the room, but James stopped him, getting as close as possible to the fire. The vision was horrifying but he couldn't look away.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The Slytherin was tearing off his clothes, screaming like an animal, every inch of tissue removed revealing a skin that was burned, but above all covered with scars, of all shapes and colors as well.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Fuck.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What the hell happened to him?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Slytherin's desperate struggle against the fire had led him to take off his cape, his sweater and then his shirt.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>James watched him scramble towards the door, as the flames continued to burn his thighs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Snape was escaping.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>While yelping in pain, he had opened the door of the dungeon to go down the corridor, his complaints soon attracting many students who watched him twist and creep to the ground as he desperately tried to undo his trousers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>James had thoughtlessly followed him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>He couldn't help it. He wanted to understand. He wanted to see.</p>
<p>Snape, who, after clumsily removing his belt, rolled to the ground.</p>
<p>Snape, who, after tearing off his pants, whimpered without stopping.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><em>Severus</em>, who, after sliding his boxers along his skinny legs, crawled on all fours on the wet cobblestones.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>His white and pink skin. His white and pink skin completely exposed as he writhed along the floor. His thin legs. His flat buttocks. Everything. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>This disgusting image that was now vividly engraved in his pupils.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He wanted to puke.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘’SEV!’’</p>
<p>Lily walked past him, shoving him. With her cape in her hand, she rushed to Severus to cover his body with a rapid gesture.</p>
<p>‘’Don't worry, Severus! I'm here! I'm here!’’<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Her screams brought James back to reality. His gaze fell once more on the Slytherin before watching the crowd that had gathered in the corridor.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Fuck.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>They were in deep shit.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>He ignored Slughorn, who was also running to his pupil, and looked for Sirius. The other boy was standing outside the classroom door, panicked.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>They could only hope that no one had seen them.</p>
<p>----------<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>As a result, the Slytherin was urgently transferred to the infirmary.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Sirius and James didn't discuss the event with each other or other students. Despite their hatred of Snape, the incident seemed to have been classified as a taboo subject, best forgotten. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>And then, against all odds, after finding himself naked in front of half of his house, Big Nose was there, all dressed up, pretending that nothing had happened with his little friends.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>But, really, how was that possible?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Big Nose with his skinny, scarred body.</p>
<p>His white and pink skin.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The scene was stuck in his head since this morning, sometimes filling his mouth with bile.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>‘’Hey, James? Did you see how Remus left in a hurry? I don't think he's doing very well.’’<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>James didn't even answer Peter, his eyes still fixed on Snape.</p>
<p>He suddenly had the impression that, despite their constant bullying, he'd managed to open up to others, to make a place for himself in his house, to blossom.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A foul and repulsive little flower.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He had to uproot it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p> </p>
