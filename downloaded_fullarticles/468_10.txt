  <strong>Prologue: A New Life</strong>
</p>
<p>"You'll stay with me?"</p>
<p>"Until the very end," said James.</p>
<p>"They won't be able to see you?" asked Harry.</p>
<p>"We are part of you," said Sirius. "Invisible to anyone else."</p>
<p>Harry looked at his mother.</p>
<p>"Stay close to me," he said quietly.</p>
<p>And he set off. The dementors' chill did not overcome him; he passed through it with his companions, and they acted like Patroni to him, and together they marched through the old trees that grew closely together, their branches tangled, their roots gnarled and twisted underfoot. Harry clutched the Cloak tightly around him in the darkness, traveling deeper and deeper into the forest, with no idea where exactly Voldemort was, but sure that he would find him. Beside him, making scarcely a sound, walked James, Sirius, Lupin, and Lily, and their presence was his courage, and the reason he was about to keep putting one foot in front of the other.</p>
<p>His body and mind felt oddly disconnected now, his limbs working without conscious instruction, as if he were passenger, not driver, in the body he was about to leave. The dead who walked beside him through the forest were much more real to him now that the living back at the castle: Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and all the others were the ones who felt like ghosts as he stumbled and slipped toward the end of his life, toward Voldemort. . . . A thud and a whisper. Some other living creature had stirred close by Harry stopped under the Cloak, peering around, listening, and his mother and father, Lupin and Sirius stopped too.</p>
<p>"Someone there," came a rough whisper close at hand. "He's got an Invisibility Cloak. Could it be—?"</p>
<p>Two figures emerged from behind a nearby tree; Their wands flared and Harry saw Yaxley and Dolohov peering into the darkness, directly at the place Harry, his mother and father and Sirius and Lupin stood. Apparently they could not see anything.</p>
<p>"Definitely heard something," said Yaxley. "Animal, d'you reckon?"</p>
<p>"That head case Hagrid kept a whole bunch of stuff in here," said Dolohov, glancing over his shoulder.</p>
<p>Yaxley looked down at his watch.</p>
<p>"Time's nearly up. Potter's had his hour. He's not coming."</p>
<p>"And he was sure he'd come! He won't be happy."</p>
<p>"Better go back," said Yaxley, "Find out what the plan is now."</p>
<p>He and Dolohov turned and walked deeper into the forest. Harry followed them, knowing that they would lead him exactly where he wanted to go. He glanced sideways, and his mother smiled at him, and his father nodded encouragement. They had traveled on mere minutes when Harry saw light ahead, and Yaxley and Dolohov stepped out into a clearing that Harry knew had been the place where the monstrous Aragog had once lived. The remnants of his vast web were there still, but the Death Eaters had driven out the swarm of descendants he had spawned, to fight for their cause. A fire burned in the middle of the clearing, and its flickering light fell over a crowd of completely silent, watchful Death Eaters. Some of them were still masked and hooded; others showed their faces. Two giants sat on the outskirts of the group, casting massive shadows over the scene, their faces cruel, rough-hewn like rock.</p>
<p>Harry saw Fenrir, skulking, chewing his long nails; the great blonde Rowle was dabbing at his bleeding lip. He saw Lucius Malfoy, who looked defeated and terrified, and Narcissa, whose eyes were sunken and full of apprehension. Every eye was fixed upon Voldemort, who stood with his head bowed, and his white hands folded over the Elder Wand in front of him. He might have been praying, or else counting silently in his mind, and Harry, standing still on the edge of the scene, thought absurdly of a child counting in a game of hide-and-seek. Behind him head, still swirling and coiling, the great snake Nagini floated in her glittering, charmed cage, like a monstrous halo. When Dolohov and Yaxley rejoined the circle, Voldemort looked up.</p>
<p>"No sign of him, my Lord," said Dolohov. Voldemort's expression did not change. The red eyes seemed to burn in the firelight. Slowly he drew the Elder Wand between his long fingers.</p>
<p>"My Lord— " Bellatrix had spoken; She sat closest to Voldemort, disheveled, her face a little bloody but otherwise unharmed.</p>
<p>Voldemort raised his hand to silence her, and she did not speak another word, but eyed him in worshipful fascination.</p>
<p>"I thought he would come," said Voldemort in his high, clear voice, his eyes on the leaping flames. "I expected him to come."</p>
<p>Nobody spoke. They seemed as scared as Harry, whose heart was now throwing itself against his ribs as though determined to escape the body he was about to cast aside. He hands were sweating as he pulled off the Invisibility Cloak and stuffed it beneath his robes, with his wand. He did not want to be tempted to fight.</p>
<p>"I was, it seems . . . mistaken," said Voldemort.</p>
<p>"You weren't."</p>
<p>Harry said it as loudly as he could, with all the force he could muster. He did not want to sound afraid. The Resurrection Stone slipped from between his numb fingers, and out of the corner of his eyes he saw his parents, Sirius, and Remus vanish as he stepped forward into the firelight. At that moment he felt that nobody mattered but Voldemort. It was just the two of them. The illusion was gone as soon as it had come. The giants roared as the Death Eaters rose together, and there were many cries, gasps, even laughter. Voldemort had frozen where he stood, but his red eyes had found Harry, and he stared at Harry moved toward him, with nothing but the fire between them.</p>
<p>Then a voice yelled, "HARRY! NO!"</p>
<p>He turned: Hagrid was bound and trussed, tied to a tree nearby. His massive body shook the branches overhead as he struggled, desperate.</p>
<p>"NO! NO! HARRY, WHAT'RE YEH—?"</p>
<p>"QUIET!" shouted Rowle, and with a flick of his wand Hagrid was silenced.</p>
<p>Bellatrix, who had leapt to her feet, was looking eagerly from Voldemort to Harry, her breast heaving. The only things that moved were the flames and the snake, coiling and uncoiling in the glittering cage behind Voldemort's head. Harry could feel his wand against his chest, but he made not attempt to draw it. He knew that the snake was too well protected, knew that if he managed to point the wand at Nagini, fifty curses would hit him first. And still, Voldemort and Harry looked at each other, and now Voldemort tilted his head a little to the side, considering the boy standing before him, and a singularly mirthless smile curled the lip-less mouth.</p>
<p>"Harry Potter," he said very softly. His voice might have been part of the splitting fire. "The Boy Who Lived."</p>
<p>None of the Death Eaters moved. They were waiting: Everything was waiting. Hagrid was struggling, and Bellatrix was panting, and Harry thought inexplicably of Ginny, and her blazing look, and the feel of her lips on his—. Voldemort had raised his wand. His head was still tilted to one side, like a curious child, wondering what would happen if he proceeded. Harry looked back into the red eyes, and wanted it to happen now, quickly, while he could still stand, before he lost control, before he betrayed fear—. He saw the mouth move and a flash of green light, and everything was gone.</p>
<p>Harry groaned as he regained his vision. He was in a dark room with no apparent light source, yet everything could be seen in great detail. He was laying on a small bed with midnight blue sheets on it. It was the only piece of furniture other than a small table two chairs. A dark figure sat in the chair facing him. The figure wore what looked to be a large black cloak.</p>
<p>"Harrison James Potter, known as the True Master of Death and the Chosen One, and one of my favoured. It is good to finally speak to you." Said the specter. Its voice was male and very deep.</p>
<p>"Where am I, and who are you?" Harry asked.</p>
<p>"To answer your second question, I am Death, also known as Thanatos, you may call me either one. Your first question is a bit harder. The best way to explain it would be to say we are between your world and the after-life. You are my favoured so I thought that I would do something for you" answered Thanatos.</p>
<p>"So what did you mean by 'True Master of Death', and why would I be your favoured?"</p>
<p>"Your family is descended from the Perveral Brothers that I gave gifts to centuries ago. Your father is descended from Ignotus, and your mother from Cadmus. You already had the Cloak and the Stone, the wand would have worked for you as well as Draco Malfoy was the winner of the wand when Albus Dumbledore was disarmed, and you won it from young Draco when you beat him in the duel at Malfoy Manor. You are my favoured just like all those who have possession of the Cloak were."</p>
<p>"Okay," Harry said slowly, "so what do you want with me?"</p>
<p>"As I said I want to do something for you. You are the only Master of Death to not want the hollows for greedy or selfish reasons. I want to reward you. You have a can move on into the afterlife or you can be reborn into a different dimension. I give you this choice because of your less than perfect childhood; in this new world you would be able to grow up happy and loved. If you choose this option I will take control of your body in the mortal plane to kill Tom Riddle. That man is on a one way track to Hell's eternal torture chambers."</p>
<p>To say that Harry was surprised would be an understatement. He had never thought that he would ever get this. He had been perfectly content with seeing his parents again. Oh, his family, they were waiting for him. But he had always dreamed of having this chance.</p>
<p>"May I speak with my family before I decide? I would have to be the world's biggest prat to do this without asking them." He asked Thanatos.</p>
<p>"I figured you might ask that. Before I bring them in you should know that if you choose to be reborn, your memories of this dimension will be locked away. They will only be unlocked if you are in a situation where the skills and knowledge from this world would be the only way to survive." replied Thanatos.</p>
<p>The God of Death snapped his fingers and four very familiar people appeared. James and Lily Potter stood arm-in-arm looking at Harry with a sad smile. Sirius and Remus looked livid though.</p>
<p>"WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING HERE PUP!?" roared Sirius, "You were supposed to AK that snake faced bastard! Why did you let him hit you? You could have stayed under the invisibility cloak and cursed him in the back!"</p>
<p>"But I thought you said I was doing the right thing, back in the forest." Harry said, startled by his godfather's anger.</p>
<p>"Harry, sweetie, the stone was enchanted by Albus Dumbledore, he wanted you to die willingly so that Riddle would be weakened by having his last horcrux destroyed. A living horcrux can only be destroyed if the container dies on its own accord." said Lily.</p>
<p>"B-b-but I gave up everything. I GAVE UP EVERYTHING, FOR THE SENILE OLD GOAT FUCKER!" Harry bellowed,"Thanatos please tell me he is rotting in Hell."</p>
<p>Thanatos just smiled, "Oh, don't you worry, he's being punished for all his crimes." Everyone was smirking at that.</p>
<p>"Cub, I think you should choose rebirth." "Remus said speaking for the first time.</p>
<p>"Moony?"</p>
<p>"Cub, you've been through hell. You were orphaned, abused, manipulated, and were forced to become a fucking martyr! I just want you to be happy."</p>
<p>"You know, I could send one of them with you." Thanatos said nonchalantly. Seeing he was again the center of attention he grinned and continued, "I can send your godfather with you. Your parents have been dead to long to be reborn and Remus here is cursed. Even I can't remove the curse that Selene's spawn spread. Lycanthropy mellows after death but Remus will still transform at the full moon, but now there is no need for the Wolfsbane Potion. Sirius and you would be separated for a time, but you will eventually find each other."</p>
<p>Sirius's face lit up at that. Harry looked around the room, his parents nodded, and Remus gave him a thumbs up, even if he looked a bit down about not being able to go. Harry looked at death and nodded. "We'll do it." He told Thanatos.</p>
<p>"All you to have to do is walk through that door." the specter replied, pointing to a door that Harry hadn't seen before. Harry and Sirius got up and told everyone goodbye.</p>
<p>"I hope you have fun Harry." James told him.</p>
<p>He nodded and Sirius quietly let him know that it was time to go. Harry opened the door and headed towards his knew life.</p>
<p>
  <strong>-A New Life</strong>
  <strong>-</strong>
</p>
<p>Fate smiled sadly. She was glad that the child was getting a new chance at life; unfortunately his soul has been cursed by Chaos. He would be separated from his godfather again, but hopefully Fate would be able to find him a family. One that would be able to love him for longer than James and Lily had. She vowed that he would have a happy childhood; no matter what she needed to do to make it happen.</p>
