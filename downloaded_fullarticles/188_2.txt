  <p dir="ltr">Remus has never felt this lonely before even when he thought that he lost all of his friends there was another feeling fueling him...Anger</p>
</div><p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p></p><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">He thought that Sirius betrayed him then not only by killing his three best mates but forcing him to live his worst fear, living alone without the only people who truly accepted him for who he was not caring that he is a monster instead of running away from him they joined him, he felt that he belonged after spending so many nights fearing that he was doomed to be left out.</p>
</div><p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p></p><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">But now he can't blame Sirius even though he wishes he could be mad at him for taking the risk and going to the ministry, defying the order that told him clearly to stay in Grimmauld place... But how could he be mad at Sirius for wanting to protect his godson James son he just couldn't</p>
</div><p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p></p><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">It's not fair losing him twice. Remus doesn't deserve to live this nightmare twice, and the only memory thats left of him is him falling through the vail, no matter how hard he tries to remember him during the happy times</p>
</div><p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p></p><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">Even now the war finally ended and people accepted him and weren't afraid of him anymore now that he is considered a hero but the truth is all of this doesn't mean anything to him without who truly mattered to him</p>
</div><p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p></p><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">All that he did these days was walking just walking without a destination in streets he has never seen before and didnt care to. He keeps walking until he is too exhausted maybe after that he could sleep for a few hours</p>
</div><p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p></p><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">And now he is hallucinating, he must be because he is seeing a long lost fantasy, maybe he finally lost it ... But here he is seeing SIRIUS BLACK laughing with a bunch of muggles. he is laughing so hard his stormy grey eyes are barely open and his black long locks are shaking with his head.</p>
</div><p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p></p><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">He is definitely hallucinating, it must be caused by his brain thats craving some sleep and food, he just needs to apparate back to his house find a sleeping potion and call it a day</p>
</div><p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p></p><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">When he was about to turn around to find a secluded alley to apparate, Sirius met his gaze and he was not hallucinating because Sirius is pointing at him to his little group of friends, are they his friends?</p>
</div><p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p></p><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">Is he walking toward me! All that lupin could think of</p>
</div><p dir="ltr"> </p>
