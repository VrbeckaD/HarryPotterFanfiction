    <p>A miserable groan signaled Hermione Granger’s slow return to full wakefulness. She attempted to swallow around the dry tongue stuck fast to the roof of her mouth, but her throat was too parched to manage it effectively, and thus she surmised that she must have been unconscious for a long time. That thought brought to mind the smirking form of Lucius Malfoy, standing over her as her vision had rapidly dimmed to blackness.</p><p>The sudden memory cleared the fog from her mind, and brought her brain screeching back to full alertness. Unfortunately, it was accompanied by a screaming pain in her neck, arms, and back as she startled fully awake. The protest of her muscles and joints brought forth an agonized moan as she raised her chin from where it lay against her chest.</p><p>Once the pain in her neck subsided, she tentatively began to study her surroundings. Torchlight danced off the dark stone walls from a single sconce, a nearby tabletop stood, covered with neatly ordered gleaming torture instruments, and her neatly folded clothes lay on top of a chair. All of them. Her bra and knickers lay on top practically mocking her with how innocently they sat there. The dungeon, she assumed it belonged to the Malfoys, was otherwise unfurnished as far as she could tell in the dim light. The air was cold against her bared skin and Hermione imagined she would be able to see her breath if it weren't so dark.</p><p>She pulled ineffectually against her restraints, not really believing that she could get free, but feeling the need to at least give it a try. She was standing, spread-eagle between two thick wooden support beams, an arm and leg bound to each. The chains binding her ankles were taut, and even though her feet were only hip width apart, the chain attaching her ankles together meant she wouldn't be attempting to kick anyone. For him to have taken such a precaution, she hoped the bastard had some personal experience with that. There was a bit of slack present in the chains binding her wrists, though there wasn’t nearly enough slack in each to move around. There was just enough to make the chains rattle whenever she did try to move, so that every time she shifted position she would be reminded of her circumstances, and every time she fell asleep she would sag in her bonds and wake painfully. Her shoulders and back were still screaming.</p><p>She was a little surprised to notice that rather than metal shackles binding her, Malfoy had chosen instead to use padded medical restraints. Rather than relief, a wave of trepidation rolled through her. She was sure the decision had nothing to do with her comfort. There had to be a reason Malfoy was taking care not to mark her up, and that reason probably involved an extended stay in his dungeon.</p><p align="center">-----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Lucius studied the shivering girl as she dozed fitfully. His eyes roamed over every inch of her, lingering on her breasts, peaked from the cold, the curve of her hip, and the nest of closely cropped curls at the juncture of her thighs. While her body was nice enough to pique his interest, that alone never held it. Narcissa was beautiful, after all, and they hadn't been intimate since Draco’s conception was confirmed.</p><p>He took a step closer to her, reaching out to caress her cheek, recalling to mind several details from the file he had assembled on her. It was never the packaging that held his interest, and he knew quite well what she was capable of. This girl held his interest, and she had for far longer than he cared to admit. Lucius felt his trousers grow tight, and mentally slapped himself at the direction of his thoughts. Right now, he needed to exercise control, difficult as it would be. He had a lot of work to do, and so little time in which to accomplish it. He shouldn’t be indulging such base thoughts when so much depended on her cooperation.</p><p>Just as he had regained control of himself, she let out the faintest whimper in her fitful sleep. Lucius cursed as the sound shot straight to his groin and he imagined that whimper in a much different context. If only Draco hadn’t complained about the girl so much over the years, he wouldn’t be in this predicament. Then again, Lucius thought to himself, if not for Draco’s incessant whingeing, he might never have considered her to begin with.</p><p align="center">-----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>The dungeon had cooled significantly over the last several hours. Hermione wasn’t sure how long it had really been, but it felt like a long time. She came awake gradually as unexpected, but welcome warmth caressed the side of her face. Unconsciously, she leaned into it, still not quite aware of her surroundings.</p><p>“It's time to wake up now, Miss Granger.” The voice crooned honey-smooth in her ear and she blinked slowly in confusion as wakefulness returned. “There we are.” It was the smugness in that voice that finally shook the last of the cobwebs from her mind, reminding her where she was and just who she was with. Lucius Malfoy’s cold, arrogant, grey eyes bore into hers. They judged her. They dismissed her. She longed to claw them out.  </p><p>She snapped at the hand caressing her cheek, but he snatched it away too fast for her to sink her teeth into it. He laughed derisively, and she pulled against her bonds, a white-hot rage overtaking her. “Bastard! You won’t be laughing when my friends come and rescue me. You’ll spend the rest of your life rotting in Azkaban!” she screamed at him, or tried to at least. Her throat was so dry that the words came out as more of a croak than anything else.</p><p>“Your friends won’t even know that you’re gone.” He amended his statement at her incredulous look. “I should say, rather, that they won’t come looking for you.” He let the moment play out as he stalked around her, giving her time to puzzle over this information.</p><p>Of course, he was lying. Harry and Ron would absolutely find her once they realized something was wrong. She had the utmost faith in them. Unless… Fear coiled inside her. What had Lucius Malfoy done, that they wouldn’t even miss her? Were they even okay?</p><p>A heartbeat after the question manifested in her mind, he stepped in close, pressing against her back, his body heat warming her chilled skin. She was so sick over what he might have done, the fact that he was pressing up against her naked body nearly went unnoticed. Nearly. Which was probably why he didn't leave it at that.</p><p>With one hand, he reached up and grasped the chain just above her bound wrist. With the other, he caressed the skin over her hipbone tenderly, splaying his long fingers wide, conveying with the display his supreme confidence and the control he had over her. The action caused the thick folds of his soft, fur robes to close around her, leaving only the front of her body exposed to the cold.</p><p>The heady scent of his expensive cologne wrapped around her brain until she felt as if he had burrowed inside her like a parasite. His cologne was surprisingly delicate for a men's scent, and yet the spiced aroma invading her senses insidiously proclaimed Lucius’ masculinity.</p><p>It was an assault on two fronts that punctuated the lack of power she had in this situation. Hermione was mortified by his proximity, even as his body was a shield against the cold. The intimate nature of his touch was far worse than she had anticipated, and she shuddered. Her skin crawled at the thought that a Death Eater, a blood-supremacist, was the first to touch her in such a manner.</p><p>He whispered directly into her ear, sounding so sure of himself, his warm breath stirring small strands of her wild hair. “I’m sure you have an inkling, an idea perhaps.”</p><p>His fingers kept moving on her hip, matching the intimacy in his voice. “There are probably a thousand different scenarios running through that brain. Oh, but what if you’re wrong about all of them? What exactly could a big bad Death Eater do right under Dumbledore’s nose? Would you like to <em> know </em>?”</p><p>Hermione nodded mutely. Her insatiable curiosity was always getting the best of her, although in this situation, knowing was at least better than wondering. If she knew what he had done, she might just find a hole in his scheme that she could exploit.</p><p>“If you want it,” his low voice crooned seductively against the shell of her ear, “you need to ask for it. Something you should keep in mind going forward.”</p><p>He was toying with her, but then why wouldn't he? In this situation, he had all the power. She swallowed her revulsion and responded in a quivering voice, “Please tell me what you did.”</p><p>He paused for a moment, hand playing at her hip, as if considering her request. Would he grant it, or was it just another power play? All at once that overwhelming heat at her back was gone. He released her and stepped back around so that he could see her face as he told his tale, dragging the fingertips of the hand so recently caressing her across her lower back as he did so.</p><p>“I did nothing, Miss Granger.” He seemed amused at his statement and the crestfallen look on her face. “It was you who wrote the letter in the Gryffindor common room, telling your friends that you were going home and wouldn’t be staying with them over the break. You see, you were so homesick that you just couldn’t bear to not go and visit your parents on holiday.”</p><p>Hermione thought she was going to be sick all over the dungeon floor even though she knew she had nothing in her stomach to retch up. The snake coiling and roiling in the pit of her stomach began to move faster as he continued. A letter she had written…</p><p>“Naturally there was no time for goodbyes. You lost track of time submitting last minute assignments, and it was all you could do to pack a bag and get to the train on time. You wished your friends a happy holiday, and reminded them to study for their potions practicums, lest they forget. Does that sound at all plausible?”</p><p>Hermione felt despair as Lucius finished, grinning widely at her. It was exceedingly simple, believable, and that last bit did sound like her, too much like her. “As I said, you won’t be missed.”</p><p>She swallowed thickly, hoping she sounded more confident than she felt. “I won’t tell you anything. I won’t betray my friends.”</p><p>“You mistake me, Miss Granger. I don't want information about your friends. I don’t care about them.” He cupped the side of her face with one hand and with the other, tapped the side of her head at the temple.</p><p>“I want this,” his eyes bore into her once more, but this time, there was something in them she couldn’t place, almost as if he were searching for something. She didn’t know what it was, but it scared her all the same.</p><p>“They claim that you are the brightest witch of your age. I seek the truth of that.” Lucius turned for the door, leaving Hermione flabbergasted.</p><p>“If that's true, then why am I chained naked in your dungeon, you sick bastard?” she called out at his retreating form.</p><p>Lucius looked back over his shoulder and smiled faintly. Hermione wished in that moment that she had kept her mouth closed as his eyes fell upon her once more, roving over her naked body before his gaze, at last, snapped back to hers, but he said nothing, and instead simply left the room.</p>
