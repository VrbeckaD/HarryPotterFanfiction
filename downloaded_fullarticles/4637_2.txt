    <p>
  <span>Draco Malfoy did not care what house his son was sorted into, so long as the boy was accepted, and able to make friends despite his surname. This did not however, lessen the shock when, twelve hours after putting his only child on the train to school, his former Head of House appeared in his floo.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Malfoy,” came the familiar drawl.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco stepped from this bedroom into his private study to see a familiar dark head in his fireplace. “Snape? Is everything okay? Scorpius?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Is fine. I thought I’d tell you in person: he was sorted Gryffindor.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco wasn’t sure how he managed to find a chair so easily as he slumped into it. “Gryff- but how? What? That’s-” He blinked over at the head. “That’s like a Potter in Slytherin.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“That happened, too,” the man replied in his usual bored drawl.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What?” Draco stared in silence for several minutes. “You’ll keep an eye on him, won’t you, Severus?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The man rolled his eyes. “He won’t like it, but yes. I didn’t let </span>
  <em>
    <span>you </span>
  </em>
  <span>go to ruin, did I?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Snape’s head disappeared, leaving Draco to sit in stunned silence for nearly half an hour until he burst into gales of laughter. Father would not be happy about this.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>After months of reading about “James this” and “James that,” Draco was not surprised to receive an owl from the Savior himself asking if the precious Malfoy heir might like to spend a few days with the whirlwind of red-haired Weasels. Draco supposed he might as well give in, as well as reciprocate, especially as Scorpius had started to become bored with their annual trip to Bristol. Unfortunately, between the visit to the Burrow and the trip to Bristol, Draco had to listen to his son wax on about the Weasleys: their numerous cousins and god-siblings as well as all the aunts and uncles. (Mr. Charlie tames dragons, Father. Mr. George is always inventing new things. Mr. Ron took us out to the back field, and let us play with some of the new products not even on the market, and look what he gave me. He kept giving me odd looks though.) Astoria was giving </span>
  <em>
    <span>him</span>
  </em>
  <span> an odd look right now, as well.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco was called to the school three times Scorpius’s second year, no thanks to the Potter brat leading his son astray. He made sure Potter knew who was to blame. The trouble started that summer when Scorpius returned from his week with the Potters with the news that something was off in the household. James confirmed this later when he came for his visit, and told them his parents were getting a divorce. Draco vaguely wondered if Snape knew yet.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Scorpius’s third year was a lot calmer.  Though Draco wasn’t sure if this was because his son was growing up, becoming more Slytherin and thus less likely to get caught, or if Snape was losing his touch. Draco knew the man was distracted by his weekly visits with the Chosen One.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>That summer, Scorpius joined the Potter brood in Greece, and they would be heading to France in August. Thankfully, Astoria had gone ahead with her sister for “bonding” time. Things had become even more strained in their relationship since Scorpius had come out to them just after school let out. He could tell by the daggers she glared at him, Astoria felt it was his fault. Pouf begets pouf. Maybe this would finally push her to the divorce he’d been seeking for for years. To celebrate his week of solitude, he invited Snape over for a drink.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m fucked.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco glanced lazily over at Snape who was uncharacteristically frowning down into his whiskey. “Do tell,” Draco drawled. “It’s been so long, I’ve almost forgotten what it feels like.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Snape snorted. “I wanted to ask him if we could continue having drinks during the summer, but I couldn’t bring myself to do it. What if I’m just a way for him to keep tabs on his son?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Does he have weekly meetings with the Heads of House for his other kids?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Snape shot Draco a look. “Probably. It’s Longbottom.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Ah, yes. Draco had forgotten his own son’s Head of House was Neville Longbottom. “Well, maybe he’ll come back when school starts,” Draco said, trying to be reassuring. It wasn’t often the two Slytherins mentioned ‘The Gryffindor Secret’ as Draco was wont to call it, usually only when they could be assured no one would overhear, and alcohol was involved.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Snape sighed. “I suppose I’m weak enough to take it.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“At least you have his friendship,” Draco said, the words slipping out without thought. Snape shot him a sympathetic look. “Don’t,” Draco growled.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The man nodded, and looked away.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Besides,” Draco nodded, “do you really want a relationship with Potter? Can you imagine how many Weasleys that would involve?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Severus snorted, knowing exactly how many Weasleys Draco would like to be involved with.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>What surprised Draco was the way she did it. He’d hardly seen his wife at all during the vacation, taking the boys out sightseeing and to a few nice muggle restaurants for dinner. Someone had to refine the Potter brat, after all. It was the last night of their vacation, and Draco was relaxing in front of the fireplace, catching up on the day’s news when Astoria walked in.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m staying in Paris, Draco,” she told him. “You may have the lawyers draw up papers when you return. If you’ll let me keep this apartment you can keep the-“ she paused, thinking, “I believe the flat in Soho and the cabin in Bristol were to go to me at the dissolution of the marriage. You may keep them in exchange for this place.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco sneered at her. “Not going to give up the alimony are you, Astoria?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It stops upon the event of my remarriage, doesn’t it?” He nodded. “Then you won’t be paying it for long.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I see. All ready to give me that divorce now you’ve got something better,” he sneered.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She glared at him. “As if the divorce would have done </span>
  <em>
    <span>you </span>
  </em>
  <span>any good, Draco. He’s married. She’ll never let him go. You’ll only ever have your pathetic crush.” Her tone was laced with that venomous sneer she only ever used when referencing the man Draco adored above all others.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Get out,” he sneered at her.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She huffed, and left the room.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He’d asked Astoria regularly for a divorce over the last ten years, and she had always refused. The marriage had, of course, been arranged by his mother, and the two had tried to make a good go of it. Astoria had even been faithful until Scorpius had been born. He supposed he was partly to blame. He had visited Astoria’s bed regularly during their first year of marriage; but after Scorpius had been born, he’d fallen out of the habit. By that time, he’d been in a steady relationship with Eric. Eric had stuck around for almost five years, but when it became apparent Astoria would not give up being Lady of the Manor, and Draco would not be granted a divorce, Eric had left. Draco wasn’t even sure what the issue had been; he couldn’t have married Eric, and he wasn’t sleeping with Astoria. He’d let the man go. He’d met Alex a few years after that, and had come to an amiable agreement with the man regarding semi-regular meet ups.  No more relationships for Draco Malfoy, not when he was still married. So the question now was: could he move forward in a relationship with Alex? Except, he hadn’t even spoken to the man in months. And what if Alex started speaking of love? How do you explain to someone you were willing to be in a committed relationship with them, but could never love them? Draco tossed back his whiskey. No. Best just to let the non-existent relationship with Alex continue to fade. He wasn’t ready to put the energy into maintaining a relationship right now.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Now, he just had to break the news about the divorce to Scorpius.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Mr. Malfoy?"</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco looked up at the short squat solicitor that was holding out the stack of papers. He grabbed them, and tossed them on his desk without looking at them. So this was it, then? He was a free man. Finally.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"That will be all, Collingsford," Draco dismissed the man, and turned towards the fire, his eye catching on the whiskey decanter. If he was going to celebrate, he wasn't going to celebrate alone. He strolled over to the fireplace, and took a pinch of Floo powder. "Severus Snape's office."</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He stepped into the green fire, and came out in the familiar dark study. The man behind the desk glanced up.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Congratulate me, Snape. I'm officially a failure."</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The man dropped his quill. "Bloody hell." He stood, and went to his liquor cabinet. He came back, and pressed a glass in Draco's hand. "Let me go make arrangements for my detention. I'll be right back."</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco held the glass up in a "cheers" motion. "I'll be right here."</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The man stepped through his office door, and Draco poured the whiskey down his throat. Leave it to Snape to have top shelf alcohol in a school. He placed the glass on the end table, and wandered over to the potions cabinet.  It was locked, of course, but Draco wondered if it was still full of all those interesting, illegal ingredients he remembered from fourth year. Draco shrugged, and went back for his glass. He was almost there when there was a knock on the door, and it swung open. Draco had </span>
  <em>
    <span>known</span>
  </em>
  <span> it was only a matter of time before he ran into the man, but he still wasn't prepared when Harry sodding Potter walked in holding a file, and looking damn fine in his Auror robes. He, of course, was hands off, not that Draco would ever lower himself to shag Potter, but he was a nice piece of eye candy. Lucky Snape.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Malfoy. What are you doing here?"</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Was that a flash of jealousy in those emerald orbs? "I'd ask the same of you, Potter. Did your son attempt to burn down the quidditch pitch and blame Scorpius again?"</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The ex-Auror rolled his eyes. "James did not burn down the pitch, Malfoy. And he has never tried to push the blame off on Scorpius."</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>No. Scorpius always went willingly. Blindly following a Potter, like so many before him. Draco said as much.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"You made plenty of your own messes, Malfoy," </span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Don’t I know it, </span>
  </em>
  <span>Draco thought with a silent sigh. "Wasn't talking about me, Potter," Draco spat.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Boys." He looked over to see Snape had returned. Potter crossed the room, and shoved the file at Snape.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"There's your notes back on the Inferi. They were quite helpful." Potter cast a glare back at him. "Enjoy your evening, Snape."</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Potter tried to push past their ex-professor, but the man grabbed his wrist, and pulled him close. He started a hushed conversation with the man, and Draco saw the younger man relax slightly. Potter pulled at Snape's buttons, and Draco almost gagged. Could they be any more obvious about the nature of their relationship? Another reason he could never be with Potter. It seemed the Chosen One was a bottom as well, if his submissive behavior was any indication. Of course, he'd always suspected Snape was a top.</span>
</p>
<p><span>"You two are going to have to learn to</span> <span>get along. You're both a part of my life now," Snape said sternly.</span></p>
<p>
  <span>Draco nodded with a sigh.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Okay, Severus, for you," Potter replied with a glare at Draco before he stepped from the room.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Another drink, Draco?" Snape asked as he crossed the room to grab the bottle of Ogden's Finest.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"An entire bottle, thanks."</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Snape refilled his glass instead. Draco grabbed it up, and collapsed onto a chair. Snape poured his own, and joined him in the opposite chair. "So it's over then?"</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco took a sip. "Yup," he replied, popping the P.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"So what now?"</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco studied the amber liquid in his glass. "I think I'm done with relationships for a while. Everything's kind of fizzled out with Alex anyway. No complications for a while."</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"It'll be good for you," Snape assured him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco downed the whiskey, and poured another. "I haven't told Father yet. I can just imagine the look he'll give me."</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"It wasn't your fault, Draco," Snape reassured him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Wasn't it, though? I'm the one who couldn't bring himself to visit her bed after Ro- Scorpius was born. She's not the one that's been hung up on someone else for years. Dad will see this as one more failure. If he could hold a marriage together, why can't I?"</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Your father was in love with Narcissa for years before their betrothal. You did not have that luxury. Yours was purely a business arrangement. Businesses dissolve all the time.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco sighed. "Why did </span>
  <em>
    <span>we</span>
  </em>
  <span> never hook up?"</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Snape snorted. This wasn't the first time they'd had this conversation. "Because you are not into dark, brooding, older men, and I do not go for the effeminate types. Besides…"</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco nodded. "We're both hung up on Gryffindors." Draco raised his almost empty glass. "At least you got yours."</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>A coy smile crossed Snape's lips. "Yeah."</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco rolled his eyes.</span>
