    <p>Death was getting tired of Fate's complaining about how there was to many unnecessary deaths. Well him being Death he didn't really care for unnecessary deaths unless it made the nature of things unbalanced. Fate made him so bored with the complaining he started to think of a ways to make her stop. He smiled brightly which made Fate shiver and stop complaining.<br/>
       <br/>
"Death what ever it is your thinking don't do it!" Fate screeched still horrified by his happy smile.<br/>
       <br/>
"But I didn't say or do anything yet." Death pouted at Fate.<br/>
       <br/>
"You smiling means your planing something! Which means a whole lot of trouble for everyone." Fate started ranting at Death again.<br/>
       <br/>
Death listened to Fate's ranting for a while before going ahead with his plan. He teleported himself to a different dimension where Harry Potter had a sister named Harriet Potter. His plan was to kidnap her and tell her a way to bring back her older twin brother.<br/>
       <br/>
Harriet was sitting near the tome of her brother's grave crying. She truly missed him and his over protective nature for her. Harry kept her feeling safe from there relatives and any other scary aspects of life. She hated feeling scared and weak as well as she hated the fact that Voldemort won. Sure the wizarding world is better but it wasn't the same without having someone to trust and help you. "I miss you big brother." She said quietly to herself.<br/>
       <br/>
Death heard Harriet talking to the tome of her brother's without her realizing he was there. He walked closer to her, letting her notice his presence of him here.<br/>
       <br/>
Harriet felt a small shiver of cold brush her. She thought it was a dementor nearby, she wiped out her wand, ready to cast the patronus spell to any dementor she sees. However she didn't see anyone except a man who had some kind of bat wings and eye patch on with a worried expression on his face. "Wh-who are you and why d-do you have a presence like a dementor?" She asked bluntly at Death.<br/>
       <br/>
"Well that was a somewhat a fast recovery. I have a presence of a dementor because I'm Death." He immediately replied to Harriet's question. Harriet's face twisted into a questioning look at him but she didn't say anything. Death decided to further explain himself. "I'm nether living nor dead so I am death and if I truly wanted to I could control the dementors. Why I am in front of you is I need your help with a little project of mine."       <br/>
        <br/>
"Um? So Death what is this project you are talking about?" Harriet asked, tilting her head curiously. She was thinking about many possibilities that could happen for Death's project. Though all Harriet could hope it didn't involve herself being killed. Death's chuckled snapped her out of her thoughts.<br/>
"Don't worry you won't have to be dead for this project. I just need you to go into a different dimension to get seven books about your brother's life. However that is not all I also need you too kidnap people from other dimensions along with your brother. It's mostly people you think will be important in reading the seven books. However if you kidnap Dumbledore and Voldemort I believe you should dress them in a straight jacket."<br/>
       <br/>
She grins evilly. "Does that mean I can kidnap Tom as well before he mutilates his soul?"<br/>
       <br/>
"Yes as well as making sure your parents and brother isn't killed as well." Death said to her.<br/>
       <br/>
Harriet set off to do her tasks of getting the books as well as thinking of who to kidnap so they can rewrite history as they know it. She can only how that it will stop all the unnecessary deaths that happen along the way.</p>
