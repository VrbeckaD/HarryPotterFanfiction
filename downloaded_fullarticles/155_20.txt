    <p>His heavy footsteps thumped in his ears as he walked towards the kitchen. He hated Order meetings; on the verge of despising them. Day in and day out he would sit in Grimmauld Place, waiting. Waiting for people to visit him, waiting for a battle, waiting for word from Harry. Waiting, waiting, waiting. Waiting for his life to begin again. 12 years in Azkaban and he’s still a prisoner. His life had gone from one monotony to another.</p><p>He never expected to be surprised when he stepped into the kitchen, resigned to sitting in silence, his pout already prepared for the meeting. The light from the kitchen gently filled the hallway, illuminating Sirius’s way. He looked up; his eyes slowly landing on the figure sitting at the edge of the table closest to the door. He sucked in his breath at the sight of her. It’s been 15 years but he would recognize her anywhere. She had long flowing curls that fell down to her waist. When he first met her, her hair had been short, resting just above her shoulders. He could see the blonde and brown highlights throughout, the light from the kitchen making her hair shine. Her skin had deepened in color since the last time he saw her, before a dark cherry color, now a deep mahogany; but it was expected to see a change after 15 years. Who knows what adventures she had gone on. Her fingers twilled her wand, showing the elegance she always carried with her. He suddenly felt self consciousness begin to creep in. He knew he was still fit, more fit than a lot of men his age, but he recalled the greys that he saw in his hair this morning, the grey in his stubble. The daily reminders that he no longer was a young man.</p><p>She looked over, the sound of footsteps catching her attention. The eyes that heated his blood and soothed his soul landed on him, the warm brown sparkling with mischief. All Sirius could see was her. She stood and stepped over to him, a soft smile on her full lips causing a gentle crinkle on the sides of her eyes and mouth, the only thing truly bellying her age.</p><p>“Hello Sirius,” she finally said, ignoring the stares of the other Order members around them, her voice deep and thick like honey.</p><p>“Long time no see Ceres,” Sirius replied. He was stiff; could hardly move. All he could see was her. He could smell honeysuckle and lavender waft over from her and he had to fight his body to not breathe in deeply. He didn’t know how long he stared, but time seemed to slow as everything else around them fell away.</p><p>“Now that everyone has been acquainted,” Dumbledore’s gentle voice woke Sirius and Ceres from their staring, “I believe it is now time to commence with the meeting.”</p><p>Ceres moved to sit first, returning to her previous seat. Sirius gave a quick glance around and groaned internally at the fact that the last remaining chair was beside her. He usually lounged in his seat, a drink in his hand, but this time he sat ramrod straight, no alcohol in sight. He noticed the looks rest of the Order sent his way, but he kept his eyes glued to Dumbledore.</p><p>“Now that we are all here, I would like to introduce you to Ceres White; she is joining us all the way from San Francisco,” Dumbledore began, the wise headmaster opened his mouth to speak but was cut off by Snape’s deep drawling voice.</p><p>“Why is she here,” Snape asked, his tone brittle. Sirius’s head snapped over, his own mouth opening in retort but Ceres beat him to the punch.</p><p>“I’m here because I’m the foremost expert on forensic magic and I was in the Order <em>before</em>. Which I understand is not something you would be familiar with Professor,” Ceres replied, her tone the epitome polite if not laced with a cool edge. Snape sneered at her, but otherwise remained silent, allowing for Dumbledore to continue.</p><p>“We need as many tools in our arsenal as possible, and that includes forensics. I believe that being able to trace past magical use will be a great help in our fight against Voldemort. Ms. White is currently the foremost expert on forensic magic and will be primarily working from Grimmauld.”</p><p>“No, she won’t,” Sirius said, his voice terse. Ceres looked at him, hurt creeping into her eyes. Sirius quickly glanced at her, but otherwise kept his gaze steady on Dumbledore. He hated putting that hurt in her eyes but it’s nothing compared to the pain he suffered before. All of the Order members watched everything with peaked interest, the tension mounting with every moment Dumbledore took to reply.</p><p>“Other than Hogwarts, this is the safest place for Ms. White to conduct her research,” Dumbledore explained calmly, a small smile on his face. Sirius could feel his lips fall into a pout.</p><p>“Why can’t she go to Hogwarts then,” Sirius asked, a hiss escaping Molly’s lips. Sirius blocked them out as he continued his face off with his old Headmaster. His heart hammered against his chest, the smell of honeysuckle and lavender clinging to his nostrils, forcing memories of laughs and skin to the forefront of his mind.</p><p>“Sirius,” Remus began, giving a pleading look to his friend, “Please.”</p><p>“I think it’s a fair question since this is my house,” Sirius said, looking over at his best friend. He knew that he was making his situation worse, widening the already encompassing divide between them, but the idea of having her in his home made his soul ache. He also couldn’t stand the thought of her seeing him in the sorry state he was in currently, the walking corpse he had become.</p><p>“The threat of Voldemort has become too great and eyes are everywhere. We can not risk word getting back to him that she is here to help us. Grimmauld is the safest and most discreet place she can be for the time being,” Dumbledore explained, his voice filled with patience. Sirius knew that, that was the end of the discussion. He could feel her eyes burrowing into him, watching him. The meeting continued on, the only part that Sirius cared to listen to was the plan to get Harry out of Privet Drive. Sirius sank into his chair, his arms crossing his chest as he was left out of the mission. Just like all of the missions previous. He hated not being able to do anything. Another reason to curse Pettigrew’s name. Sirius was in a freedom limbo and he despised it.<br/>
The meeting finally ended and Sirius rushed out of the room, leaving the rest of the Order members baffled by his behavior in his wake. Remus stepped over to Ceres, a gentle smile on his face.</p><p>“How are you doing Ceres,” Remus asked, his voice soft. Ceres gave a sarcastic twinkle of a laugh, a nervous hand reaching up to her curls to push them out of her face.</p><p>“I’ve been better,” she began, looking towards the door before turning back to the tall man, “I knew it wasn’t going to go well, but I wasn’t expecting that. He hates me. And now Dumbledore expects me to live with him. I don’t know how I’m going to do this.”</p><p>“Sirius does not hate you,” Remus began, resting a light, reassuring hand on her shoulder. Ceres looked up at him, still unsure.</p><p>“He didn’t even want me in his house,” Ceres nearly exclaimed, “I knew coming back was a mistake.”</p><p>“Please trust me on this. Sirius doesn’t hate you. He’s working through a lot of trauma, but he’ll come around. You just need to give him time.” Ceres nodded, a small but unsure smile on her face as Remus stepped away. She jumped slightly when Dumbledore was suddenly by her side. He had that mischievous twinkle in his eyes that never seemed to diminish, even in the darkest of times.</p><p>“How are you Ceres,” Dumbledore asked, his voice gentle and warm.</p><p>“As well as to be expected I suppose,” Ceres sighed out, but her previous unsure smile turned into a more confident and genuine one. Dumbledore nodded sagely at her.</p><p>“If you need anything, please do not hesitate to ask,” Dumbledore replied, looking at her over his spectacles.</p><p>“I won’t Professor,” Ceres told him.</p><p>“I think we’ve known each other long enough for you to call me Albus,” Dumbledore said, a smile lighting his face.</p><p>“Of course Albus,” Ceres said, smiling at the older man once again before he nodded and stepped away. Ceres’s eyes landed on the doorway Sirius stomped through, the temptation to go find him pressing on her back and belly. Sitting beside him made her skin tingle; his distinct scent of oak, fire whiskey and cigar wafting together to make an intoxicating scent. It was much improved upon the cigarette smoke that clung to him in his younger years. When he first walked in her heart pounded. Even Azkaban couldn’t strip him of his handsome features, his grey eyes looking into her soul. Those eyes always were able to draw her in and convince her to do some wicked things. Her heart ached when he sat beside her, his denial of her. Memories flashed behind her mind’s eye; laughter, warm kisses, arguments, sex. Even after all of these years, her love for him never diminished.</p><p>She finally stopped bouncing foot to foot and followed after him, not noticing everyone’s eyes on her as they watched and waited for her decision. Molly and Arthur took particular note as they stood beside Remus, wondering what will happen.</p><p>“Poor thing, having to be trapped in this place with him,” Molly began, leaning into Arthur’s side lightly. Arthur placed a hand on Molly’s back as he took a sip of his tea.</p><p>“Come now Molly; Sirius isn’t that horrible to be around. Besides, we’ll be here for the rest of the summer until the children go back to Hogwarts. A nice full house,” Arthur told her, his hand beginning to rub small circles into her back. Molly always found it soothing when he did that.</p><p>“Sirius has been lost for a long time now. I just hope she’ll be able to help him find his way again,” Remus added, looking at the doorway where his best friend and love of his life exited.</p><p>“That’s a lot of pressure for so young a person,” Molly stated, sighing heavily.</p><p>“We’re not children anymore Molly,” Remus told her before downing the last of his own drink and beginning to say his goodbyes and then following behind Ceres to the rest of the house.</p><p>~0~0~</p><p>Ceres stepped quietly up the stairs, careful not to wake the children already in the house. She lifted her wand and gave it a small flick, watching as footsteps appeared on the wood. She could tell by the shape and size that they were Sirius’s. She followed the footsteps to a dark hallway, illuminated by a small shaft of light leaving a room with it’s door slightly ajar. She walked over to it, her heart thumping in her chest, a small ringing in her ears. She felt as if she was walking to the executioner’s block as she stepped up to the door. She lifted her hand but hesitated, her eyes squeezing shut as she lowered it, trying to gather her thoughts.</p><p>“Are you gonna come in or stand out there all night,” Sirius’s deep voice said from within the room. Ceres sucked in a breath but gently opened the door. Sirius was lounging on his bed, a book in his lap, his long dark hair lightly covering his face. He looked up at her, softly shutting his book and setting it on his bedside table. He tried to look like the easy playboy of his past but she could see the stiffness in his back and the edge to his eyes.</p><p>“I was hoping we could talk. Clear some air,” Ceres began as she stepped in enough to lean on the door frame beside her. Sirius rested clasped hands on his belly.</p><p>“I didn’t realize there was anything for us to talk about,” Sirius replied, sinking more into his pillows.</p><p>“Come on Sirius, don’t do this to me,” Ceres said, her back straightening as Sirius shot up from his bed and stomped his way over to her.</p><p>“Don’t do this to you? Don’t do this to you? You thought you could waltz back in here and pretend like nothing happened,” Sirius hissed the question at her, his anger thickening the air in the room.</p><p>“No, I don’t which is why I’m trying to talk to you,” Ceres replied, trying to stay calm.</p><p>“You lost the right to talk to me when you left. Dumbledore may have decided that you have to stay here to help the Order, but that doesn’t mean I have to like it. Stay away from me and get the hell out of my room,” Sirius growled out. She knew he would be upset, but the pain and hurt in his eyes punched a hole through her heart. Tears sprang to her eyes as he spoke to her with such hate and fury. Sirius could feel himself falter a moment as he saw the tears gather, but he couldn’t give in, not to her or the heartbreak she can bring with her.</p><p>“I’m sorry Sirius,” Ceres gasped out before spinning around and exiting his room. Sirius slammed the door behind her, falling back on his bed, his head resting in his hands. Ceres made her way down the stairs to the next floor, seeing Hermione and Ginny stand out side of their door in their pajamas; the only two seemingly hearing the slam from earlier.</p><p>“Who are you,” Hermione asked, her hand gripping her wand, a hard look in her eyes. Ceres gave the girls a soft smile. They were tough, she could tell.</p><p>“I’m Ceres White,” she replied, her smile brightening at the gasp Hermione gave, “I see you’ve heard of me.”</p><p>“I’ve read your book ‘Mixed: A Philosophy and Study of Nomag Forensics and Magic’ only a thousand times,” Hermione replied, the grasp on her wand lightening.</p><p>“Light summer reading,” Ceres asked, her brow raising in question and laughed softly at the blush on the girl’s face.</p><p>“You girls better get back to bed before Mrs. Weasley comes up and murders me for keeping you awake,” Ceres told them; giving them a wink as they nodded and went back into their room. Ceres waited till she heard the soft click of the door before allowing the tears to fall. She pressed her back against the wall, taking deep breaths as she tried to get her emotions under control. She didn’t think this would be this hard.</p><p>Remus stepped up the stairs, his ears prickling at the soft sound of tears. His feet land on the last step, his eyes adjusting to the dark and seeing Ceres leaning against the wall, her hands scrubbing at her face. Her deep breaths are loud in the quiet hall.</p><p>“I take it whatever you went up there for didn’t go as planned,” Remus asked, his deep voice a low rumble as he tried to make sure no one could hear their words.</p><p>“That’s an understatement. I don’t know how I’m going to do this,” Ceres admitted to the other man once again. Remus placed a warm hand on her shoulder, drawing her into his arms for a hug.</p><p>“You know Sirius is a hot head Ceres,” Remus told her.</p><p>“I messed up Remus. I left him for what? To go back home? To pursue a career? Where did that leave him?,” Ceres asked, her voice muffled by his shoulder.</p><p>“You were just living your life. None of us knew what would happen. You have to forgive yourself,” Remus replied, his arms still tight around her. Ceres pulled back, wiping the tears from her eyes.</p><p>“Thank you. I don’t know where I would be without having you after all of these years,” Ceres said to him, her cheeks wet with tears, glistening as she smiled at him.</p><p>“The feeling is mutual,” Remus replied, his hands still resting on her shoulders. They never saw the grey eyes watching them from around the corner at the stairs that lead to Sirius’s room. Remus glanced over his shoulder, feeling a presence that his other senses didn’t pick up.</p><p>“What is it,” Ceres asks him, looking over his shoulder as well after she notices his attention had been drawn away.</p><p>“Nothing,” Remus told her, his voice attempting to be light, “Come on, we’ll find you a room to get settled in.”</p><p>“Are you sure,” Ceres asked, insecurity creeping into her voice once again. Remus gave her a gentle smile as he placed his hands on her shoulders and practically pushing her down the hallway to find an empty room.</p><p>Sirius was back upstairs in his room, his rough calloused palms rubbing against his face in frustration and exhaustion. He fell back into his bed, his sheet awkwardly pressed against his back but he couldn’t bring himself to care. He stared up at the ceiling, imaging what James and Lily would say if they saw him now. Call him an absolute idiot undoubtedly. He sighed deeply, his heart hurting.</p><p>“Everything will be better once Harry is here,” Sirius whispered softly to himself, tears springing to his eyes as his sadness echoed throughout his room.</p><p>~0~0~</p><p>The sights and smells of Diagon Alley filled Ceres’s nose as she walked around. Loud crashes of magic as people milled about, purchasing the various things they needed and didn’t need created a sense of wonder within her. Compared to San Francisco, Diagon Alley was small fare but it still made her heart swell with adventure.</p><p>Sirius loved walking through Diagon Alley. It always seemed to be filled with warmth and laughter; things desperately needed these days as the Dark Lord grew stronger. The smell of fresh flowers wafted over to his nose as he walked through the bustling alley way. The closer he came to the flower stand the more pronounced certain scents came. Honeysuckle and lavender filled his nose; and that’s when he saw her. A young woman about his age smiling brightly at the flower vendor. The bright colors of purple, yellow, orange, red and pink all added a glow to the woman that Sirius had never seen before. He was instantly drawn to her and the warmth that radiated from her.</p><p>He felt his feet move of his own accord, stepping towards her. His breath left his body as he moved closer, her chocolate colored eyes landing on him. Her curls fell in coils to her shoulders. Sirius couldn’t help but allow his eyes to roam down her body. Her t-shirt was a rusty red tucked into brown corduroy pants that hugged her every curve. Sirius admired the thickness of her thighs, the epitome of strength and power. She wore a light off-white sweater which added a touch of innocence to the ensemble that Sirius felt his heart ache to sully. Finally, he reached her, the scent of honeysuckle and lavender hit his nose full force, soothing his soul. He breathed in deep, his eyes falling shut.</p><p>“May I help you,” she asked, her sultry voice creating a stir in his lower belly.</p><p>“I’m way beyond any help luv,” Sirius replied, his eyes opening, his heated stare landing on her.</p><p>“I can tell,” she told him, her brow arching as she looked over him, “Do you normally do this?”</p><p>“Do what,” Sirius asked, his voice light with innocence.</p><p>“Creepily walk up to and smell women at a flower stand,” she asked, but Sirius could tell by her tone that she wasn’t truly asking.</p><p><br/>
“The honest answer is, you’re just so beautiful I just couldn’t help myself,” Sirius told her, taking a small step forward, the warmth of her body beginning to flow towards him.</p><p>“That’s a disappointing answer. I’ll give you another chance,” she replied before turning and walking away. Sirius was flabbergasted by her sudden exit. His mouth fell open as he watched her back become smaller and smaller, the flower in her hand becoming a colorful speck.</p><p>“Wait! What’s your name? Where are you staying? I can tell you’re not from around here,” Sirius called, taking a large step forward towards her. She turned around, a wide smile on her face and a mischievous glint in her eyes.</p><p>“A girl needs a little mystery about her,” she replied, calling back to him, a laugh on the edge of her lips.</p><p>“Will I see you again,” Sirius asked, his heart pounding, the butterflies in his stomach flying madly about like a thousand snitches racing around.</p><p>“Perhaps,” was her only response before turning around and completing her walk away, her laugh finally escaping her, the petals of her flowers fluttering as she swung them in her hand. Her stride was powerful and strong and Sirius could feel his stomach in his throat now. He’s never felt this way about a witch before and he prayed to whatever gods above that she’ll float into his life again.</p><p> </p>
