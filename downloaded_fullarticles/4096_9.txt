    <p>Percival gazed down at his desk, and resisted the urge to swear. Swearing wasn't appropriate behaviour from a world class auror, even when he had a headache coming on. He knew why. Scamander. The man had left a trail of chaos across two different continents, and had slipped out of MACUSA's containment cell before they had had a chance to properly process him.</p><p>He had been arguing that Scamander should avoid the death penalty. Although the man was a con artist and a thief, he hadn't put state secrets at risk. If he used magic around No-Majs, he was subtle about it - and from what he had seen of Scamander's work in the flesh, at least half of what he did was actual sleight of hand. It was ridiculous, a wizard acting like a stage magician, but it meant he could slip in whatever he wanted without being detected.</p><p>Now, Scamander had up and left, managing to disguise himself as one of the guards. He had been being held outside of the main MACUSA building, and Percival was now cursing whoever had made that choice.</p><p>"Director Graves?" Picquery called out as she swept into the room, reaching out to place a hand on his shoulder. "I know that you're going to find him. You always do. Now don't let him get under your skin."</p><p>"It took months last time," Percival muttered under his breath, a little irritated - Scamander was a distraction from the real cases, the ones where magical lives were at risk. Right now he should have been tackling the Jauncey smuggling gang who were linked to a dozen disappearances, but he had been pulled from that to waste time on Scamander. Scamander just waltzed around taking whatever he wanted, and Percival had to spend his time untangling whatever mess had been caused.</p><p>"Make it shorter this time," Picquery said, her voice gentle, before she walked away, leaving him alone with his thoughts. Percival sighed and stared back at the prison log book.</p><p>Scamander, who he had never known to be anything other than clean shaven, had been bearded when he escaped. He had apparently stopped using magic to prevent hair growth a couple of weeks beforehand, so he needed to look through the visitor book and see what might have triggered it.</p><p>There were few people to visit Scamander. A handful of witches, who he had constant correspondence with, but nothing out of the ordinary. A new name caught his eye.</p><p>P. Newton. was written in the name box, and the signature beside it said "Pickett Newton", the letters a little shaky. Percival wasn't one of the aurors who specialised in this, but he could recognise the shaking as a sign a name had been forged. He frowned.<br/>"I thought the pen was enchanted so that whoever was visiting had to sign their name honestly?" He asked one of the other aurors. Goldstein nodded, and Percival reached for a magnifying glass, leaning in for a closer look. There was an odd flourish on the end of the second letter "t". He reached for Scamander's file, reading it over, and groaning as slowly everything fell into place.</p><p>Scamander had a younger brother called Newton. He leaned in, staring at the space between the two words, and his thoughts were confirmed. What he had initially taken as a dramatic flourish was a small <i>and sign</i>. Newton's notes revealed a penchant for magical creatures, illegally brought from across the world. Newton hadn't been able to lie when he'd held the pen. He'd just added his name to that of one of his creatures, one small enough to smuggle into the jail.</p><p>So Newton had come to see his big brother, and a few weeks later big brother had broken out of prison, when efforts were already being made to find a way to help rehabilitate him. It could be that Scamander had decided that the lingering threat of Azkaban wasn't worth the risk, but Percival doubted that.<br/>"Do we have pensieve recordings of the visit that day?"<br/>"No. There was a large brawl in another meeting hall, so the pensieve crew were busy trying to organise that."</p><p>Percival rubbed his forehead once more, tapping his wand against his coffee cup to get a drink. He sighed to himself. Something about this situation wasn't right, he just couldn't work out what - it didn't help that the only person who did know had already escaped from prison and so couldn't be asked. At least, not before Percival had located him.</p><p>"I want his face on wanted posters across the country," he informed Goldstein. "And every auror briefed on him. And I want them looking for his brother too. I'm sure that wherever Scamander has gone, his brother is mixed up in it."</p><p>"Yes sir," Goldstein murmured and scurried away. Percival frowned. There was little he could do about Scamander right now - not until there was a sighting, or some other clue as to where he had apparated off to. He turned his attention to the other files on his desk, skimming through a few - the main concern right now was that among the apparent kidnappings were four No-Maj children who had been due to be moved into MACUSA care, as they had multiple older siblings who had shown magical ability. </p><p>That in turn meant that he suspected whoever had been behind the kidnappings knew that these children had magical abilities. He didn't know Jauncey was involved. After all, the man was one of the best obliviators that they had, so he would often have knowledge about cases. But there was just something about the interest that he was taking in the case that set Percival's teeth on edge.</p><p>He had assigned auror guards to a few other No-Maj children who looked like they were showing promise - there was no point in taking them from their family if it turned out not to be necessary. He considered what else he could do for those children, when a knock sounded on the door.<br/>"Come in!" He called, and paused as the door swung open and he saw a letter. Finding a letter wasn't unusual in itself, people often dropped their paperwork off at his door before rushing away. What was a little more unusual was that the letter in question was hovering almost two feet off the ground, and advancing on him.</p><p>His hand twitched towards his wand. He was being frightened by some menacing stationery, but he couldn't help it.<br/>"Revelio!" He cast, but the letter just continued its path to his desk, floating down in front of him.</p><p>Reluctantly, he reached for it, seeing his name written in Scamander's broad, confident scrawl. He ripped it open, not sure what he should be preparing himself for, just knowing it would be something important.</p><p>"Sorry for running out on you old chap." Scamander had written, and Percival frowned, able to feel his headache worsening, and utterly sure that Scamander didn't regret it in the least. He waved his hand to close the door, and took a few deep calming breaths. Still, he owed it to him to at least discover what ridiculous excuse he had concocted for his escape attempt. As he read on, he felt a sense of exasperation. "It's my brother, he's got mixed up in something and really he needs my help. So I am off to rescue him. Don't worry, it shouldn't take too long, and once he's safely back ensconced where he should be, I'll come back." Scamander had signed it with a characteristic flourish.</p><p>He stared at the letter, and then stared at it again, reading it over - he didn't know if he should laugh at that message, or cry. He was far from inexperienced at handling escape attempts but he had never known anyone offer to come back as soon as they had finished what they were doing. Worse, he suspected that Scamander meant it.</p><p>Percival looked up as he heard a faint creak, and saw that his door was slowly beginning to open. A wave of his wand closed the door once more, and he stood, watching it. After a few seconds, it once more began to open.</p><p>Feeling more than a little ridiculous, Percival got out from behind his desk, as he used a wave of wandless magic to close the door. He threw himself forwards, colliding with something which immediately attempted to get away from him. He wrapped his arms around the something, then yelped as sharp teeth dug into his hand. His arms released, and the door opened, the whatever-it-was slipping through before Percival could stop it. He stared at the mark on his hand - two neat semicircles of points - not human. Not goblin either, or house elf, from what he had seen of it.</p><p>With a sign, he walked over to evidence, allowing them to take a look at it. It was bizarre, and now he could add assault of an officer to the list of Scamander's crimes. All the others had been non-violent. He considered. He supposed he must have frightened whatever had attacked him. Though that didn't excuse it, it went some way to explaining the action. </p><p>Abernathy held his hand, examining it.<br/>"Definitely a creature, but I'm not sure what kind. Can't be a carnivore, judging by this..."<br/>"Do you have any books I can look at?" Percival suggested. "I'd rather not hold you up."<br/>Abernathy nodded, puffed up with a sense of his own importance. He fetched a handful of books about creature attacks, and handed them over. Percival returned to his office, opening one and then quickly closing it when he saw a close up of a dragon attack. After fetching himself another cup of coffee, he returned to the book.</p><p>The real problem with this entire situation was that Percival actually liked Scamander. He was charming, and more mischievous than actually dangerous - he was out for whatever he could get, but no one else would be hurt along the route. After days of dealing with murderers and monsters, Scamander's escapades were closer to light relief than anything. </p><p>He flicked through the evidence book, pausing when he saw a page marked "Invisible Creatures". He dismissed the hidebehind - if it had been one of those, his hand would have been ripped off. A diricrawl was obviously not the culprit - they lacked teeth. But a demiguise - he examined all the notes, seeing the similarity in the bite mark illustration. Demiguises were peaceful, but would attack if provoked. A pang of guilt hit him, but he pushed it aside.</p><p>Scamander's younger brother liked creatures. If he was missing, then the creature had to be a link. He returned to the note, studying it - it didn't make any sense. Scamander was claiming that he wrote simply to reassure Percival he would return, but that action was too cocky even for Scamander. He tried examining it for a hidden code, but nothing jumped out at him. He tapped his pen on the note, wondering if it might change, but it stayed the same. Uncharmed paper and uncharmed ink. His wand revealed no hidden spells. Just one brief message.</p><p>Percival's eyes widened, and he looked over the note once more - no hidden message, but instead a very clear statement of what Scamander was doing and why. It wasn't a boast, and it wasn't an apology.</p><p>He was asking for help.</p>
