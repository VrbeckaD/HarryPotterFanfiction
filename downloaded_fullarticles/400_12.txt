    <p>          The final battle, the Battle of Hogwarts, had ended. Harry had beaten the odds and defeated the darkest lord of the recent centuries. After the battle he did what was expected of him; he married the girl, he got the job that his new family wanted him to get and worked alongside best mate who was now also his brother-in-law.</p><p>          However, Harry noticed something when he compared himself and those around him to pictures; everyone was aging. Everyone but him.</p><p>          When he had first noticed this he started applying glamors to himself, making him look like he should. Now, even though he is twenty-six years old if someone were to see him without the glamors he would look to them to be somewhere around eighteen or nineteen years of age.</p><p>        He had also noticed that he was feeling less and less, not too long after coming to this realization he had booked an appointment and visited a mind healer. Thinking it was most likely something similar to depression, that might be an after effect of the war, or perhaps some kind of PTSD, there was also the possibility that it was a form of survivors guilt.</p><p>          With everything that has happened he figured it could be just about anything, but even with that thought in mind he was absolutely not prepared for the results that he would soon receive.</p><p>          While at the mind healer they performed a routine physical scan that would tell them if the mental effects were a result of something else, and the results that came back were appalling. They said that he had been continually and routinely dosed with a potent love potion and the overwhelming amount of that in his system had caused his brain to release too much dopamine over too long a period of time thus making his brain to not register it as much, if at all, anymore.</p><p>          The mind healer referred him to a mediwizard that would be able to take care of his problem and advised that if even after the cleansing he was still feeling in need of a mind healer he come back.</p><p>          Harry left the appointment with a sense of betrayal, that his wife and/ or her family- if anyone else it was probably Molly- had been dosing him with love potions for who knows how long. He left St Mungo’s and mentally noted to contact the suggested mediwizard later that day, very glad that he did not tell his wife what he was doing while out.</p><p>          Then he had a thought, deciding to check even though he hoped he was wrong, he apparated to Diagon Alley, just outside Gringotts Bank.</p><p>          He entered the bank and nodded respectfully towards the goblins guarding the entrance. After the war, it had taken a while but the goblins were no longer surprised or suspicious of his actions in treating them as equals. Not long after the battle ended Harry had gone to the bank to pay for repairs and to mend his relationship with the goblins, at first they were not trusting of him at all, it was like that for a while, which made sense.</p><p>          But, when Harry never faltered in his respect and understanding for them they began to open up, not completely as was expected, but enough. Many of the goblins still did not trust him and he did not blame them one bit, but others had surprisingly accepted that he repented for what he had done, especially after he somehow got in the good graces of Ragnok, the head goblin at Gringotts.</p><p>          Harry approached one of the teller counters, behind which sat a goblin he was well acquainted with, “Hello, Griphook, how are you this afternoon?” he greeted kindly.</p><p>          Griphook had been the first goblin he had encountered when he had entered the wizarding world for the first time- since then Harry had also made Griphook the Potter account manager. Griphook gave him what most people would consider or assume to be a sneer but Harry could tell after time spent with the creature that this was his version of a smile.</p><p>          “I am well, what can I do for you today Lord Potter-Black?”</p><p>          “If I might have a word privately in your office? And, as always, please, just call me Harry”</p><p>          “Certainly, Lord Potter-Black,” with that, and a chuckle from Harry, Griphook motioned for him to come around to the other side of the counter and led them briskly out of the main hall and through a complex maze of halls and doors. When they eventually reached Griphook’s office and closed the door Harry spoke.</p><p>          “Griphook, I have recently come across some information that has made me rightfully paranoid and suspicious, not of you or yours, mind. Apparently, I have been almost constantly dosed with love potions. Due to this I have a nagging feeling that there is more that had been kept from my attention, as such I would like to request a full blood inheritance and diagnostic to be done,” Harry looked hopefully to the goblin sitting opposite him, Griphook gave him a sneer-smile and told him that it would cost him 10 galleons collectively to get them done, Harry nodded and told him that that wouldn't be a problem and they could take it directly from the Potter vault.</p><p>          With that Griphook left to go get the needed components for the small ritual.</p><p>          Griphook returned about eight minutes later with two grey stone bowls, one was half full of a blue watery liquid and another with a more opaque yellow liquid, two pieces of parchment, and a small but ornate goblin crafted dagger made of Damascus steel. He set the components on his desk then instructed Harry to “please use the dagger and drop seven drops of your blood into each of the bowls,” he slid over the aforementioned items and Harry did as instructed and sliced his palm with the intricate blade, he then squeezed his fist and counted out fourteen drops of blood dripping equally into the bowls before he healed his hand and pushed the items back towards Griphook who then stirred the liquids and his blood together until it was a consistent lilac or peachy color throughout. Griphook then pulled out a quill and dipped it into the first mixture and it began to write on its own.</p><p>The first parchment read;</p><p> </p><p>Name:</p><p>          Hadrian Jamison Potter</p><p>Maternal:</p><p>          Lily Ann Jane Potter nee Evans</p><p>Paternal:</p><p>          James Fleamont Potter</p><p> </p><p>Godparents:</p><p>          Sirius Black-Lupin</p><p>          Remus Black-lupin</p><p>          Alice Longbottom</p><p> </p><p>Blood:</p><p>          Pure Blood (Wizard standards)</p><p>          Elf - 40% - Paternal</p><p>          Grim Reaper - Death</p><p>          Nymph - 38% - Maternal</p><p> </p><p>Inheritance:</p><p>          Lordships:</p><p>                  Black - Godfather</p><p>                  Emrys - Mother</p><p>                  Gaunt - Conquest</p><p>                  Gryffindor - Father</p><p>                  Hufflepuff - Godfather</p><p>                  Mortem - Death</p><p>                  Pendragon - Mother</p><p>                  Peverell - Father</p><p>                  Potter - Father</p><p>                  Ravenclaw - Mother</p><p>                  Slytherin - Conquest</p><p>                  Tenebris - Death</p><p> </p><p>Other Notable Titles;</p><p>          Master of death</p><p>          Companion of Death</p><p>          Goblin Friend</p><p> </p><p>          The parchment continued on, further detailing what vaults were his and what properties he had claim over. There were several things on the parchment that Harry was confused about, wanting to get answers he asked, “Hmm, Griphook? May I ask some questions?” the goblin replied in the affirmative, “well first it says that my name is Hadrian, but I only ever knew it to be Harry. Next in regards to my godparents I, uh, thought that only Sirius was my godfather and are- were he and Remus married or something? They share last names…</p><p>        “Uh, next it- it says that I have creature blood but I know nothing about this, I’ve never come into any kind of inheritance. Next … why- how do I have so many Lordships? My mother was a muggle born and what does it mean when it says ‘Death’? And Death comes up later as well saying master and companion of Death, and then there is the Goblin friend, what does that mean?” Harry took a deep breath having said that with only a small amount of air.</p><p>          Griphook looked surprised, “May I take a look over the parchment?” Harry handed it over, knowing that nothing about this would ever be repeated without his consent. Upon reading it over Griphook knew that he should get the Bank Manager Ragnok involved, as even he didn’t know the answers to some of the questions but answered what he could. “Your Godfathers were married, however, I do not believe it is a sanctioned marriage with your ministry, but because Remus Black-Lupin is a creature and Sirius Black-Lupin is his destined mate as soon as they were to mate the bonding would serve in place of a marriage ceremony.</p><p>          “As of your mother, I guess she was less muggle-born than anyone thought, possibly descending from a long line of squibs or alternately she could have been adopted. Some of the titles that you received from her were known to have creature blood, but it seems to have surged and become more potent either in the last few generations or in you. For the rest of the questions, I think we should take this to Manager Ragnok.” Harry nodded in agreement silently wondering why weird stuff seems to constantly be following him. But before they were to go to Ragnok he wanted to look at the next parchment, hoping that this would be less eventful. He hoped in vain.</p><p> </p><p>          The next parchment read;</p><p> </p><p>          Full Diagnostic (alphabetized, not in order of when in the year they occurred)</p><p> </p><p>Age, One Year;</p><p>          Injury caused by curse, resulting in scar</p><p>          One small scratch on the arm</p><p> </p><p>Age, Two Years;</p><p>          Eye strain</p><p>          Slight bruising</p><p>          Slight malnutrition</p><p> </p><p>Age, Three Years;</p><p>          Eye strain</p><p>          Mild bruising</p><p>          Mild malnutrition</p><p>          Sprained ankle (left)</p><p>          Sprained wrist (right)</p><p> </p><p>Age, Four Years</p><p>          Binding of Magical Core (20%)</p><p>          Broken wrist (left) (improperly healed)</p><p>          Bruising</p><p>          Burn on forearm</p><p>          Damage to eyesight due to strain</p><p>          Malnutrition</p><p> </p><p>Age, Five Years;</p><p>          Bound Magical Core (20%)</p><p>          Bruised ribs</p><p>          Bruising</p><p>          Damage to eyesight due to strain</p><p>          Fractured fibula (right) (improperly healed)</p><p>          Lacerations on back</p><p>          Malnutrition</p><p> </p><p>Age, Six Years;</p><p>          Bound Magical Core (25%)</p><p>          Bruised mandible</p><p>          Bruising</p><p>          Concussion</p><p>          Damage to eyesight due to strain</p><p>          Dehydration</p><p>          Fractured rib (improperly healed)</p><p>          Lacerations on back</p><p>          Malnutrition</p><p>Age, Seven Years;</p><p>          Bound Magical Core (30%)</p><p>          Broken rib (improperly healed)</p><p>          Bruising</p><p>          Concussion</p><p>          Damage to eyesight due to strain</p><p>          Dehydration</p><p>          Fractured ribs</p><p>          Lacerations on back</p><p>          Lacerations on thighs</p><p>          Malnutrition</p><p> </p><p>Age, Eight Years;</p><p>          Bound Magical Core (35%)</p><p>          Bruised metacarpals (both hands)</p><p>          Bruising</p><p>          Carved words in skin (back)(-freak -monster)</p><p>          Concussion</p><p>          Damage to eyesight due to strain</p><p>          Dehydration</p><p>          Lacerations to back</p><p>          Malnutrition</p><p>          Slight fracture to skull (improperly healed)</p><p> </p><p>Age, Nine Years;</p><p>          Bound Magical Core (40%)</p><p>          Bruising</p><p>          Concussion</p><p>          Damage to eyesight due to strain</p><p>          Dehydration</p><p>          Forced mate block (placed- to activate at 16)</p><p>          Internal tearing of the lining of the rectum</p><p>          Lacerations to back</p><p>          Lacerations to thighs</p><p>          Malnutrition</p><p>          Obedience potion administered</p><p> </p><p>Age, Ten Years;</p><p>          Bound Magical Core (50%)</p><p>          Broken ribs</p><p>          Bruising</p><p>          Cruciatus Curse</p><p>          Concussion</p><p>          Damage to eyesight due to strain</p><p>          Dehydration</p><p>          Fetus in early development</p><p>          Forced abortion</p><p>          Forced Mate block (reinforced)</p><p>          Internal tearing of the lining of the rectum</p><p>          Lacerations to back</p><p>          Malnutrition</p><p>          Obedience potion administered</p><p>          Obliviate</p><p>          Weak love potion administered</p><p> </p><p>Age, Eleven years;</p><p>          Bound Magical Core(60%)</p><p>          Bruising</p><p>          Concussion</p><p>          Cruciatus Curse</p><p>          Dissuading charm</p><p>          Hate charm</p><p>          Forced mate block</p><p>          Internal tearing of the lining of the rectum</p><p>          Lacerations on back</p><p>          Loyalty charm</p><p>          Loyalty potion</p><p>          Mild love potion administered</p><p>          Obedience charm</p><p>          Obedience potion</p><p>          Obliviate</p><p>          Recklessness charm</p><p>          Short attention span charm</p><p>[whatever injuries he got in school]</p><p> </p><p>          The list continued on to detail what injuries, spells, charms, and potions had happened or been used on him all the way through to now, revealing much more than the diagnostic spell had. What was one of the most shocking things was that by the time he was 17 85% of his core was blocked, that meant that he was able to defeat Voldemort with only 15% of his magic. Shit.</p><p>          Harry was surprised by all that Dumbledore had done to him, but more than that he was angry, he was pissed. How could they do that to him!? He had trusted them to… well, to not do<em> this</em>. Suddenly he turned back to the first parchment at the spot where it detailed the activity to and from his vaults. He saw what he had expected but hoped not to see, they had also been stealing from, Dumbledore as far back as the day after the murder of his parents.</p><p>          Oh, and the Dursleys who were always bitching and moaning about how they were receiving nothing for taking him in and that he should be grateful at how generous they were being, they were being paid handsomely from his own vaults. Harry was livid now.</p><p>          Trying to control his temper and his magic Harry turned his attention back to Griphook from the papers, “can we fix this?” it was so quiet, but with his magic cracking around the room it seemed to amplify it so the goblin was able to hear him loud and clear.</p><p>          “Harry, I think we should go up to Ragnok now, he should be able to help.”</p><p>          Harry stood up with a strange rigid fluidity that was oddly graceful. The two quickly vacated the room and headed towards Ragnok’s office. When they were allowed entrance Griphook entered first, having already received permission to share the documents, he gave them to his superior and quickly explained the situation in Gobbledygook. Harry gave a malicious smile when he saw the rage in Ragnok, he would get revenge,<em> good</em>.</p><p>                  Then a thought struck him “Ragnok?” the goblin turned to him ever so slightly tilting his head to show that the wizard had his attention. “When I got married to Ginny the name on the contract that I signed under was Harry Potter, not Hadrian Potter... Whatever other names, does this make any difference in me marrying her if my real name was not used?” Harry got his answer in the form of a terribly wonderful smirk that splayed across the goblin’s face then it was confirmed.</p><p>          “If you wish it can be annulled, due to the technicality. She will be immediately barred from anything that was not originally hers and you will no longer be married. The messenger owl that carries the letter to inform her will <em> conveniently  </em>not be able to find her and came back.” Harry grinned, glad he could be free from at least one of the people drugging him, it was in times like this he immensely loved being on good terms with the goblins.</p><p>          Then remembered his earlier questions and revoiced them to Ragnok, other than the one about his godfathers because he had already been informed of that one, he still asked about the creature thing and his mother because he wanted to know more. He also asked again about his lordships and Death and being a ‘Goblin Friend.’</p><p>          Ragnok answered his questions with a nice amount of detail, “your mother was a direct descendant from the lines Emrys, Pendragon, and Ravenclaw. Those lines are known to carry creature blood in them. It could be that your mother was a nymph or it could be that she was just a carrier for the gene and it activated in you. From your father, you received the elven portion of your creature. It is known to us that Potters often come into an elven inheritance so it would not surprise me if your father was one. Skipping around a little here, have you been in possession of all of the Deathly Hallows?” at Harry’s hesitant nod the goblin nodded to himself slightly, “it might be, Lord Potter, that the legend surrounding those objects could be true, you also having Peverell blood flowing through your veins could have been the last step, of course, this is all just speculation.</p><p>          “And a few of your Lordships have come from Death, most likely as a part of your status as Master and Companion of Death. Lastly, about your title of Goblin Friend, it is fairly simple, because you have been genuinely generally wonderful to the goblin race as a whole, disregarding the incident with the dragon, this title is not assigned, it is earned. Witches and wizards are almost never genuinely nice to us goblins, most do not even pretend to be, we had created a system that would assign the title of Goblin Friend to anyone who our ancient magic deems genuine and worthy. You are one of less than twenty-five wizards and witches who earn the title.” Ragnok informed.</p><p>          “The blocks, charms, and potions, can we get those off of me and out of my system?” Harry asked.</p><p>          Ragnok noded, “there is a way, but with the quantity and potentness of some of them it will be excruciatingly painful, are you sure you want to do this?” Harry nodded affirmatively. “Griphook, take Hadrian down to the medical ward and tell the healers that he will need cleansing, purging, and general healing. Once you are done and recovered please come back up here so we can devise an appropriate retaliation against those who have wronged you,” Ragnok finished with a sneer.</p><p>          Griphook led Harry down to where the healers were located, and after many turns, hallways and down two flights of stairs the duo made it to the medical wing of Gringotts. Again Griphook entered first and explained to the other goblins what needed to be done, however after he had finished with that he needed to get back to his normal job and left Harry in the wing with goblins that he had not met before. Trying to alleviate some of the awkwardness Harry spoke, “Hello, my name is Harry, might I know yours, and what you do?”</p><p>          The goblins looked shocked before one spoke “I am Rorglock I’ll be in charge of your general bodily health, over there is Gilshuk he will be in charge of getting the potions out of you, then there is Riflooger who will be in charge of getting the blocks off of you and your magic, we all have people working under us.”</p><p>          “Thank you all for helping me with such a large request,” Harry smiled kindly at the goblins.</p><p>          Soon enough Harry found himself in a circle covered in runic symbols and goblins standing periodically in a circle around him, some chanting in their native language of Gobbledygook and some chanting in the more familiar Latin. However, Harry could not take any notice of this because he was currently writhing in pain on the ground, hoping for it to be over. Unfortunately for him, this ritual ended no sooner than an hour later. This first ritual was to rid him of the foreign magic, there were still two more rituals that he had the <em>pleasure </em>of going through.</p><p>          The next ritual went about as well as the first had, leaving him even worse for the wear. It was on the third ritual, to remove the blocks from him and his core that something went wrong.</p><p> </p><p>          Harry died.</p>
