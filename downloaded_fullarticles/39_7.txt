    <p>Tom could be patient, it was a virtue that took practice certainly, but he was always fond of the saying “practice maketh a man perfect”, and most of his selected <em>hobbies</em> required a high level of patience. ‘And practice as well’, he supposed. For Tom, they weren’t ever too far apart.</p><p>It all started with reading. Reading wasn’t doing. It was retaining and fascinating, and Tom could and <em>did</em> develop a deep adoration with reading. But as pleasurable as it was, it lacked that engagement Tom’s heart chased. </p><p>One Author, in particular, had Tom yearning to <em>practice</em>. To revere their texts as if they were his Holy Bible, to follow their words like Sunday prayer, to execute their written lines as though they were Commandments.</p><p>He wondered if his choice to associate <em>Crime Novels</em> to <em>The Holy Bible </em>was a bit tasteless. But Tom was Agnostic, so he didn’t have much to play off of here.</p><p> </p><p>Or he <em>was</em> Agnostic.</p><p>Before finding <em>Roonil Wazlib.</em></p><p> </p><p>Real name: Harry James Potter, he being the Author of Tom’s favourite series of Crime Novels.</p><p> </p><p>So <em>yes</em>, Tom could be patient. Finding Harry’s real name, his general area of residence, and his favourite Coffee House took a level of quiet persistence that wasn’t for the faint of heart. Arranging some of his entrances to coincide with Harry leaving, some of his exits with Harry entering, slowly whittling that down to conveniently arriving at the same time as Harry, this all required <em>patience</em>. One couldn’t go around and stalk someone so obviously.</p><p> </p><p>“Do you mind if I take this empty seat?” Tom was pulled from his musing by his muse themself. He could feel himself freezing up, ‘is this what’s it’s like to be starstruck?’ Tom wondered.</p><p>“I’m sorry, the shop is just so full today, and I desperately needed to get some writing done. I’ll go stir crazy at home.” Tom felt his mouth part slightly but found he couldn’t speak. He settled for a firm nod.</p><p> </p><p>It was absolutely the right choice with how Harry lit up as though Tom had just gifted him the entire world. Harry’s eyes were a very unique shade of green, Tom was only now noticing. How long had it been since he breathed? Eight years of medical school told him he probably shouldn’t have to ask, that was a bad sign.</p><p> </p><p>“Thanks, I promise not to be a bother.” Tom waited as Harry sat down in the chair opposite, pulling out a laptop and taking a long sip of what Tom knew was an Iced Americano while expertly navigating and opening a word document. Well, it was probably a word document if Tom was reading the reflection on Harry’s glasses right. And he liked to think he’d gotten quite good at that.</p><p>After a few more moments of breathless staring, Tom mindfully lowered the cover of the book he’d brought with him to hang delicately off the edge of the table. No need to scare Harry off by showing that he was an avid fan. Tom carefully returned to his breathing <em>and</em> reading, fake as it was.</p><p> </p><p>Was he ready for this step? Confrontation. Maybe he needed more time to admire Harry from a safe distance, a few more days, perhaps? Possibly a few months.</p><p> </p><p>Harry’s careful sigh had Tom glancing back up, ‘how much time had passed?’ But he wasn’t fast enough to casually look away when Harry’s eyes had drifted from his screen and met directly with Tom’s. Harry, at some point, had slouched and put his head in one palm, elbow on the table. The eye contact had Harry perking up slightly, and the mischievous smile that followed had Tom swallowing too early as he reached for his tea.</p><p>“Are you a doctor?”</p><p>Tom choked and coughed through his reply, “I’m sorry, what?”</p><p>“Oh, it’s just— well, your attire. I thought maybe you were a fancy doctor of some kind.” Harry’s hand moved to cover his amused smile. Tom hated that habit.</p><p>Tom glanced at his lab coat; he had pulled a Graveyard shift and hadn’t bothered changing before coming straight here, hoping to catch sight of Harry before he crashed for the day.</p><p>“I see the connection, and I’m a Medical Coroner, though I do have D.M. So I could be a ‘fancy doctor of some kind’.” Tom’s answering grin was max-charm, he would know, it was all practice after all.</p><p>The hint of red and pleasant surprise on Harry’s face was unexpected but reassuring. Tom watched as Harry’s hand came up to close his laptop slightly, he leaned forward, enraptured. And Tom’s shaking hand reached for his bookmark.</p><p> </p><p>Confrontation was happening. And naturally, it seemed.</p><p> </p><p>“That’s so interesting! You must have a great set of work stories with a job like that?”</p><p>“Nothing too special I’m afraid,” Tom faux sighed and shook his head. “Unless of course, you find yourself a fan of gruesome death stories?”</p><p>Harry’s smile grew wider as he shyly picked at a fading sticker on his laptop case, “I guess you could say I find them curious.”</p><p>Tom’s eyebrows raised, he felt the need to giggle childishly, but this was an inside joke he shouldn’t know quite yet. Still, a small smirk curled the edge of his lips.</p><p>“Should I be worried? Am I sharing my table with a closet necrophiliac?”</p><p>Harry’s loud laughter at Tom’s poor joke seemed to surprise even himself as he quickly covered the lower half of his face and sent a sorry glance to the other patrons of the Coffee House. His reply was almost a whisper.</p><p> </p><p>“No no, nothing so horrible. I’m actually a writer who veers towards the crime and thriller genres, so stories of the ‘gruesome death’-y variety are my speciality.”</p><p>“Ahh, that makes sense. Is that what you were working on just now?”</p><p>Harry sighed dramatically, “It’s what I <em>should</em> be working on, sadly I’ve hit somewhat of a block, and I’ve been sneakily skirting my responsibilities by browsing the latest psychological-thriller movies released this month.”</p><p>“There <em>are</em> a few good ones out right now. I’ve meant to see one or two of them, though is it too cliche to be a Coroner and like psychological-thrillers?” That last question was mostly for Tom to contemplate, and he didn’t really care one way or the other for movies, but Harry did so—</p><p> </p><p>“No, never,” Harry paused and carefully shut his laptop entirely. He started packing his bag and downed the rest of his drink, reaching back into his bag shortly after to tear a piece of notebook paper. He shuffled around some more only to frown, look towards the coffee bar and then back at Tom, eyes zeroing in on the breast pocket of his lab coat.</p><p>Harry boldly reached across the table, plucked one of Tom’s pens, and quickly but neatly wrote his name and phone number on the scrap.</p><p>“Not sure if this is totally weird or unwanted or both, but I’m free this Saturday. And you’re cute.” The smile Harry gave Tom then had short-circuited him completely. Tom couldn’t breathe, think, speak, any other normal bodily function, and <em>wow</em> he couldn’t even name anything else? This was really very bad. Was his mouth open?</p><p>Harry once again reached across the table, this time to return Tom’s pen and slip the paper— ‘Harry's <em>phone number,' </em>his brain helpfully supplied<em>—</em> in his pocket. He gave it a single pat and winked as he made a hasty retreat.</p><p> </p><p>Tom sat in the Coffee House well into the afternoon. Once the shock settled, he allowed his body to go slack and like a puddle of goo, he slipped and sunk in his chair until his chin could uncomfortably rest on the table’s edge.</p><p>Well.</p><p>Patience was a virtue. A very rewarding virtue.</p>
