    <p>
  <span>Harry’s life was lonely.  He had no friends because Dudley always scared the other kids off, no loving family as the Dursley's hated him, and definitely no pets because of Petunia’s allergies and fears.  The small ten, almost eleven, year old sat in the cupboard under the stairs wishing he had someone to confide in, someone he could tell all his secrets to and not have to worry about them telling.  He had always considered the spiders that shared his cupboard his friends, but Aunt Petunia had gotten Uncle Vernon to kill them all when she kept spying them all over the house.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It was about a week before his birthday, and Harry hoped that eleven would be better than ten.  Dudley’s birthday had been last week, and Harry had been locked in the cupboard ever since because of the incident at the zoo.  He had been sneaking out at night and taking small bits of food, in order to stave off the hunger until he was let out.  Harry sat listening to the quiet stirrings of the house when he heard a sound outside.  He wasn’t sure if it was safe to sneak out yet, but he was worried that someone was trying to break in.  He was considering ignoring it and waiting and extra fifteen numbers when there was the sound of a lock clicking.  Harry quickly opened his cupboard and snuck out, he couldn’t have whoever this was waking up his relatives.  He wouldn’t be able to feed himself if they woke up.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry tiptoed to the front door checking to see if there were any lights upstairs as he went.  He looked at the door expecting to see the silhouette of an older man or woman, but he was surprised to see nothing but an open door.  He turned to check the living room when he felt something brush against his leg.  Looking down he was shocked to see what appeared to be a bright green kickball… with wings and a beak?  Harry bent down to get a better look at the creature when it suddenly jumped into his arms.  Harry caught and held it as it nuzzled him fondly.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What are you?”  The creature stopped for a moment before looking at Harry.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Na-tu.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Natu?  Is that your name?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Na-tu,” the creature had shaken its head signaling yes, and allowed Harry to stand up with it.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Well you can’t stay here Natu,” Harry said as he walked towards the door,  “my aunt and uncle don’t like animals and they’d probably kill you.”  Harry placed Natu on the doorstep and shooed him away as he closed the door.  Harry turned, about to go to the kitchen and sneak a couple of morsels of food when Natu appeared out of thin air.  Harry fell back out of shock and watched as the bird made its way into the kitchen.  “You can’t eat any of the food in there!  I’ll get in trouble.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry followed Natu ready to stop it if the bird decided it was going to steal.  Once in the kitchen, Natu jumped onto the counter, and somehow miraculously opened the cupboards.  Natu then jumped into the cupboards themselves prompting Harry to climb on a chair to get the bird out.  Harry saw that Natu had gone to the very back of the cupboard making Harry climb on the counter to reach him.  It was as Harry was about to grab the annoying pest that the bird came back with some old boring cereal that no one touched anymore.  Natu threw the box onto the floor causing some to spill out.  Harry groaned realizing he would probably have to pick up the mess, as Natu jumped down and stood next to the box staring intently at Harry.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry jumped off the counter and picked up the box of cereal.  Just as he was about to turn and put it up he considered it.  No one in the house would notice the cereals disappearance and there was enough that it would hold him over for awhile.  Harry had no idea of how much longer his groundation would last, or when he would next be able to have such an opportunity.  Harry nodded and set the box on the counter, he then went to grab the broom to sweep up the cereal that had fallen only to find Natu had eaten most of it.  Harry considered putting Natu on the doorstep again when Natu vanished from sight having eaten the mess off the floor.  Harry was a bit sad to have lost the little bird but that quickly vanished when he heard a soft Na-tu from the backyard.  Smiling Harry picked up the box of cereal and carried it to his cupboard.  He had tried to take his time in eating the food so he didn’t get sick, but this was the first decent amount of food he’d gotten in awhile.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The next morning Harry was finally let out of his cupboard and was told to watch breakfast.  Once that had finished cooking he was told to go outside and weed the gardens.  Harry worked on the front gardens first plucking the weed and sustaining several small cuts from thorns and burrs on the flowers.  Once Harry had finished out front he went to the back and started working there.  It was as he was bent over on his hands and knees that he felt something settle on his back.  He straightened and looked behind himself to see Natu sitting on the ground behind him.  The two stared at one another for a moment before Harry shrugged and got back to work.  Natu sat next to him and after a while started helping sometimes pulling up flowers by accident.  Harry finished his work just as the sun was setting, and, after waving goodbye to Natu, he went back inside and was given a small helping of bread and cheese and was sent to his cupboard.  Harry sat eating his food when he felt something in the cupboard with him.  Harry squinted trying to see in the darkness, and could just barely make out a round shape.  “Na-tu,” it was quite almost a whisper, but enough for Harry to tell who it was.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You can’t be in here.  I already told you that they’ll hurt you.”  Natu didn’t listen however and just curled up in the space next to Harry.  Moments later quite “Na-tuuuu”’s could be heard and against his better judgment, Harry decided to let the bird stay.  There was nothing he could do if the bird was just going to teleport into his room like that.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>~~~~&lt;0&gt;~~~~</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The next morning Harry awoke to the sound of his cupboard door being banged on.  Rolling over he noticed that Natu had disappeared again, most likely to the backyard.  Harry got up and crawled out of his cupboard, and sat at the kitchen table.  In the sink was his uniform for school which at the moment looked like soaked elephant skin and smelled absolutely awful.  No one in the house liked the smell that much was evident by the grimaces on Vernon and Dudley’s faces.  Harry was not looking forward to wearing that and was thinking of how humiliated he was going to be the first day of school when the mail slot clicked.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Get the mail, Dudley,” said Uncle Vernon from behind his paper.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Make Harry get it.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Get the mail, Harry.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Make Dudley get it.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Poke him with your Smelting stick, Dudley.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry dodged the dumb stick and went to get the mail.  Three things lay on the doormat, a postcard, a bill, and- a letter for Harry.  Harry stared at it in awe and had been about to return to the table when Natu suddenly appeared before him.  Harry jumped in shocked and dropped the mail on the ground.  Natu picked up Harry’s letter in his beak before disappearing again.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Hurry up, boy!  What are you doing checking for letter bombs.”  He chuckled at his own, very unamusing, joke.  Harry returned to the table feeling a bit hurt that his first friend would steal his first letter.  Vernon read the postcard informing Petunia that Marge was ill, and set aside the bill for later.  Harry was sent off to do his chores and was allowed to do whatever for the rest of the day.  Immediately Harry went to the backyard and looked for the small green bird.  Just as he was about to start shouting Natu appeared before him, the letter still clutched in his beak.  Harry sat down in front of him and held out his hand for the letter.  Natu dropped the letter on the ground and hopped into Harry’s lap.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Really?”  Natu simply snuggled deeper into his lap, leaving Harry to sigh and pick up the letter.  The envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowing parchment, and addressed in emerald green ink:</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>Mr. H. Potter</b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>The Cupboard under the Stairs</b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>4 Privet Drive</b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Little Whinging</b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Surrey</b>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Flipping the envelope over Harry spotted a coat of arms depicting a lion, an eagle, a badger, and a snake all surrounding a large letter H.  Harry broke the seal and pulled out the letter which was strangely enough written on the same parchment as the envelope.  Opening the letter the first thing he was greeted by was:</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>HOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Witchcraft and Wizardry?”  Confused, Harry read on only getting more confused the further along he went.  From what he could gather, he was a wizard, or someone was pulling a really harsh and cruel prank.  Harry reread the letter and realized several things that would cause problems if this was real.  He had no clue where Diagon Alley was, nor did he have money to pay for his supplies.  He also didn’t own an owl, so he couldn’t tell them he wished to attend in the first place.  But did he want to, did he want to go to a school where there was the possibility of him being just as hated and lonely as he was here.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>While Harry got lost in his own head, Natu disappeared again only to reappear with pen and paper.  Harry hadn’t noticed his disappearance, but he did notice when he came back.  Natu looked from the paper to the letter, to Harry trying to convey what he wanted Harry to do.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You want me...to write them back?”  Natu nodded his head... body(?), in agreement.  “I don’t own an owl and they didn’t give me an address, so I can’t mail it to them.”  Natu simply hopped up and down nudging the pen closer to Harry.  Harry watched the bird for a bit before grabbing the pen and writing a reply, if only to stop Natu from moving so much.  Harry wasn’t sure what to write and kept referring back to the letter for answers, leaving the final draft a bunch of marked out phrases and messy blots from where he rested the pen.  In the end, it read:</span>

  <span>    To who it may concern:</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>        Hogwarts seems like a really fun place, and It’d be cool to attend I’d like to attend if it’s not a prank.  I’ve never heard of wizards and witches before.  I also like to say that I’m afraid that I don’t have any money, and I don’t know how to get to </span><strike><span>Digon</span></strike> <strike><span>Digaon</span></strike><span> Diagon Alley.  If someone could come to help that’d be really nice.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>    Yours </span>
  <strike>
    <span>sincerly</span>

  <span> sincerely,</span>

  <span>    Harry Potter</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He read it over again, and nodded satisfied he then looked at Natu, “Now what?”  He honestly hadn’t expected for the anything to happen, so he was surprised when Natu picked up the letter and disappeared.  Harry stared at the spot the bird had stood in moments ago wondering how Natu knew where to go.  Harry sat outside a moment longer before heading to the park to take his mind of the possible prank and to quench the small flame of hope in his heart.  He didn’t want it to be stomped on like everything else he had ever treasured had.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>~~~~&lt;0&gt;~~~~</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It was a week later when someone from Hogwarts showed up.  The day after Natu had taken the letter the little bird had shown back up.  He didn’t carry anything, so he had to have given the letter to someone.  Who that was, was something Harry didn’t know.  (Though a certain professor of transfiguration had gotten a strange visitor late that night.  After taking the letter from its beak it had disappeared confusing her greatly.)  Natu slept in Harry’s cupboard at night and stayed in the backyard during the day.  Harry spent the week walking around the neighborhood and going to the park with Natu.  The longer Harry’s letter went without response the more he thought that it was a prank and that he was a fool for believing it could be anything else.  It was the morning of his birthday when there was a knock on the door.  The Dursley's were watching some movie about a boy and his dog.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Get the door, boy.”  Harry walked towards the door, the movie wasn’t any good anyway.  Opening the door revealed a giant of a man, his face hidden by a long shaggy mane of hair and a wild, tangled beard, his eyes glinting like black beetles.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You look jus’ like yer dad, except yeh’ve got yer mum’s eyes.  Why the las’ time I saw yeh, you was only a baby!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You knew my parents?”  Harry was surprised.  Not only had Hogwarts actually sent someone, but they sent someone who had known his parents, the two people Harry wanted to hear the most about but the Dursley’s absolutely refused to talk about.  “Could you tell me about them!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Sure, I’ll tell ya’ on the way to get your stuff.  Still got yer’ letter?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yeah, just let me go get it, but, um, who are you?”  Harry had just realized that he could have just walked off with a stranger just because they said they knew his parents.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Right, I haven’t introduced mehself.  Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m Harry Potter, I would introduce my friend Natu but he’s hiding in the garden somewhere.  Wait here, I’ll go get my letter.”  Harry walked over to the cupboard trying not to disturb the Dursleys, unfortunately, Vernon had noticed him walk back in.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Who was it, boy?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“A representative from a school.”  It wasn’t a lie, Harry hoped he wouldn’t question it further.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What school?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry sighed knowing his next words would only make things worse, “Hogwarts.”  He could tell that Vernon hadn’t really processed what he had said yet as he had yet to turn away from the TV set.  Harry tried to sneak away to get his letter before Vernon could stop him when the man shouted.  Faster than Harry had ever seen the man move, he was at the front door telling Hagrid to get lost, and soundly shutting and locking it.  He then rounded on Harry, about to tell him that whatever freakishness they’d put his head had better not ever be brought into the house again when Natu appeared on top of Harry’s head.  Natu had Harry’s letter in his beak, and Vernon looked murderous, but before he could do anything Harry felt a tight feeling in his chest before he felt as he was being forced through a straw.  Harry fell to his knees and threw up his breakfast from that morning.  Looking around he saw that he was outside on the front lawn and that Hagrid was hovering nearby nervously.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Hey Hagrid, this is my friend Natu.”  Natu hopped off of Harry’s head and offered the letter to Hagrid.  “He got my letter, and I guess he also got me out of the house.  We should probably go, Uncle Vernon didn’t look too happy.”  Just as those words slipped past his lips the front door was ripped open.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“YOU!”  Vernon started to make his way towards Harry when Hagrid blocked his path.  Vernon stopped in his tracks staring at the half giant the stood before him.  His mouth opened and closed as he tried to gather his thoughts making him look like a fish out of water.  Vernon seemed to finally found his voice when he screamed, “I WILL NOT HAVE A FREAK IN MY HOUSE.  WE HAVE DONE EVERYTHING WE CAN TO ENSURE THAT BOY DOES NOT GROW UP LIKE HIS MOTHER AND I WILL NOT LET YOU RUIN THAT!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Wait, you knew I was a-”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“DON’T YOU DARE SAY THAT WORD!”  Vernon was purple in the face and looked ready to explode.  “You will go back inside, you will go sit in your cupboard, and you will never speak of this again.”  He spoke in huffed breaths the anger in his voice still there even though he wasn’t yelling.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hagrid had stayed quiet up to this point, and it was now that he spoke, “If you think you’re going to deny Lily and James’ son his education, yeh got another thing comin’.  He’s famous in our world, people would come looking for him if he didn’t show at Hogwarts, and where would yeh be then.”  Harry didn’t know anything about this supposed fame of his, but it seemed Vernon did, as he went as pale as a ghost at the mention of people coming to look for Harry.  “Now, I’m going to take Harry to get his school things, and you are going to let him go, or else.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Vernon had been about to start screaming again when Petunia stuck her head out the door, “Vernon let it go, we’ll talk about it later.  Let the boy go before the neighbor’s see.”  Vernon took one last look at them, before growling and re-entering the house.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What would have done if he tried to hold us back?”  Hagrid kept looking at Natu strangely, but he answered nonetheless as he led the way to the station.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Nothing really, can’t use magic on muggles, and I’d probably kill ‘im if we fought.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What’s a muggle?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“People who don’t have magic.”</span>
</p>
<p><span>    </span> <span>“What did you mean when you said I was famous?”</span></p>
<p><span>    </span> <span>“You heard the story of how yer parents died, right?  That’s what I meant.”</span></p>
<p><span>    </span> <span>“A car crash made them famous?”</span></p>
<p>
  <span>Hagrid stopped and looked at Harry, “A car crash?”</span>
</p>
<p><span>   </span> <span>“That’s what Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia told me.”</span></p>
<p>
  <span>“Those filthy muggles.  Yer parents weren’t killed in no car crash, but this isn’t summat that should be talked about here.”  Hagrid led the way and had been about to pass the bus stop when Harry pointed out that taking the bus would get them to London quicker.  Being he didn’t understand ‘Muggle money,’ Hagrid had given the bills to Harry so he could pay their bus fare.  Hagrid complained that the seats were too small the entire way, but Harry was just glad he didn’t have to walk all the way to London.  Natu followed the whole way, and it was during the bus ride that Hagrid brought him up.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Where did yeh find your friend, Harry?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“He broke into the house, one night and had been living in the backyard ever since.”  Hagrid seemed concerned about that, but he pushed it aside for now.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Did you name him Natu?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Nope, he told me.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What?”  Hagrid looked at Natu, who was sitting comfortably in Harry’s lap, confused.  Natu had been sleeping up to this point, but at hearing his name he had woken up.  Natu and Hagrid stared at each other for a moment before Natu tilted his head curiously, “Na-tu.”  Hagrid had wanted to hold Natu, but the bird refused to leave Harry’s lap.  Whenever Hagrid did pick him up he would just do his teleporting thing and reappear in Harry’s lap.  While Hagrid just kept getting frustrated, Harry was getting a good laugh.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The bus left them in a hot tourist spot, with several people milling about.  Several people stared at them for several reasons.  One reason was Hagrid’s large size and the fact that he kept pointing out ordinary things like parking meters and saying, “See that, Harry?Things these Muggles dream up, eh?”  Another thing people stared at was Natu.  Natu seemed unaffected by all the staring, but it was starting to get on Harry’s nerves.  Thankfully Hagrid led them to a lesser populated road and seemed to know his way as he led them through streets and alleys until they were in a busy shopping district.  Hagrid easily cut through the crowds, all Harry had to do was walk closely behind him.  They made their way through the crowd until they stood before a grubby looking pub.  </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“This is it, the Leaky Cauldron.  It’s a famous place.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>For a famous place it looked run down, but Harry withheld his comment.  Hagrid steered him inside and Harry didn’t think the inside was much better than the outside.  Once they had stepped inside everything had seemed to stop.  Several people knew Hagrid as they waved and smiled at him and the bartender reached for a glass, saying, “The usual, Hagrid?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Can’t on Hogwarts business,” Hagrid said, clapping his hand on Harry’s shoulder and making Harry’s knees buckle.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Good Lord, it can’t be.”  The Leaky Cauldron had gone completely still and silent.  “Bless my soul.  Harry Potter… what an honor.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The bartender rushed forward from behind the bar to shake Harry’s hand, and after some time everyone else in the pub rushed forward to do the same.  Natu had to have had some kind of foresight because he had hopped onto Harry’s head the moment they entered the dingy building.  Up to this point, he had stayed quiet and silently observed everyone as they approached Harry.  It was when a pale young man tried to approach that Natu started making a ruckus.  Everyone surrounding them startled some of them now noticing the bird for the first time while the man himself backed himself into a corner.  Harry picked Natu off the top of his head and tried to calm the bird down, and while it did stop screeching it didn’t stop glaring at the man.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hagrid used this as an excuse to get away from the crowd and led Harry to a small walled courtyard, where there was nothing but a trash can and a few weeds.  “Told yeh, didn’t I?  Told yeh you was famous.  Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh- then again he could’ve been trembling cause Natu screeched at ‘im that and he’s usually tremblin’.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“That man was a Professor?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yep teaches Defense Against the Dark Arts.  Poor bloke.  Brilliant mind.  He was fine while he was studyin’ outta books but then he took a year off ter get some first-hand experience.  Rumour was he had a nasty run in with some vampires and some hag- never been the same since.  Scared of the students, scared of his own subject - now, where’s me umbrella?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry’s head was spinning, not only were wizards real but vampires and hags as well.  What other nighttime horrors existed out there?  How dangerous was the wizarding world and how would Harry defend himself?  Harry could feel panic creeping up his spine and almost had a panic attack when Natu gently smacked him in the face.  The little bird was leaning down to look Harry in the eyes, and once he had Harry’s attention he made a weird cooing noise.  Harry kept looking into his eyes and felt a strange calm overcome him.  Hagrid had been doing something with the wall, but Harry didn’t notice.  Only when Hagrid said “Stand back, Harry,” did Harry snap out of his strange trance.  Even though he had fallen out of the trance a sense of calm still remained giving Harry the chance to clear his mind and focus on the magic happening right before his eyes.  Harry watched as the wall before them slowly turned into an archway leading to a cobbled street that twisted out of sight.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Welcome, to Diagon Alley.”  As they stepped through the archway Harry turned around and watched as the arch shrunk back into the wall.  The street itself was no less amazing and spectacular.  Everywhere Harry looked there was something magical chiming, clanking, or whizzing about.  The buildings were tall and jagged, built at strange angles that looked impossible.  The people were all dressed in robes, and some wore pointed hats.  Owls hooted, frogs croaked, cats meowed, and various other animals made a canopy of noise that nobody seemed to mind.  Harry was in awe as they walked towards the large snowy white building that towered over all the other shops.  Natu had jumped back down into Harry’s arm in fear of getting whiplash from how fast Harry’s head was turning</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>As they approached the large building, which Harry had been told was the wizarding bank Gringotts, Harry noticed the creature standing by the bronze doors wearing a uniform of scarlet and gold, a goblin.  The goblin bowed as they entered the building, being met with a pair of silver doors vowing vengeance on any thieves who dared to rob the bank.  Beyond the door was about a hundred more goblins, sitting behind a long counter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing coins in brass scales, and examining precious stones.  There were several doors leading off the hall, some of which goblins were showing people in and out of.  Hagrid made for one of the counters and Harry followed along behind him.  Hagrid handed over Harry’s vault key and a letter from Professor Dumbledore.  A goblin, Griphook, was called over and the goblin led them to a narrow stone passageway that sloped downward and equipped with little railway tracks on the floor.  A cart rolled up, and Natu jumped from Harry’s arms to rest on the floor and wait for their return.  The cart was fast, and while Harry was exhilarated Hagrid was getting sick. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Once they reached Harry’s vault, Harry was shocked to realize that he not only owned money but quite a lot of it.  Hagrid only let him get enough to get his school supplies which Harry wasn’t happy about, but he understood.  They then went back to the cart which sped away to the top secret vault at an incredible, almost impossible speed.  Once they were in the vault Harry was shocked to see that the only thing in the vault was a grubby little package.  For the amount of protection on the vault, he had expected something of more grandeur, not this.  Hagrid emptied out the vault and once they were back at ground level fled from the carts, Harry and Natu following behind.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Let’s get yer uniform first.”  Hagrid pointed towards a shop that declared itself as</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Madam Malkin’s Robes for All Occasions, but just as they were about to enter Hagrid asked if he could slip off to settle his stomach after the cart ride.  Harry could tell he was still feeling sick, so he walked into the store with Natu perched on his head.  Madam Malkin was a kind woman who got Harry on a stool for fitting not even moments after he sat down.  It was as he was being fitted that he met another boy who was going to Hogwarts too.  Harry had thought the boy was too stuck up for his tastes and found himself instantly disliking him when he called Natu, “A useless looking owl that probably couldn’t deliver a letter, much less fly.”  He liked the boy even less when he made fun of Hagrid, and called him a servant, and savage.  Thankfully, Madam Malkin finished with Harry’s robes quickly and he was able to get away from the boy and his nasty opinions.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hagrid helped Harry buy the rest of his supplies until the only thing left to get was Harry’s wand.  Harry had been surprised to learn that his wand was the twin to the one that gave him his scar.  The wand itself was holly with a phoenix feather core, eleven inches, nice and supple.  Harry had enjoyed the rush of adrenaline that he’d felt when the wand had released red and gold sparks.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hagrid had promised to get Harry his animal as a birthday gift.  Harry had tried to say that Hagrid didn’t have to, but he insisted and that was what led them to enter Eeylops Owl Emporium.  There were owls everywhere, some in cages, some free and flying about, and some that rested on the perches to sleep.  There was a large variety too, small and large, white and brown, fluffy and rough, Harry was in awe.  Natu sat in Harry’s arms, calm as ever, intimidating most of the birds away.  Harry had asked Hagrid why Natu couldn’t be his pet, and Hagrid told him that it would be better to get an owl to deliver his letter since Natu couldn’t fly.  Natu had seemed slightly offended by that but allowed Harry to search for an owl anyway, even though he kept scaring them all away.  It was as he was approaching a nice looking brown, that he felt something land on his shoulder.  Harry turned his head and looked at the beautiful snowy white owl that had landed on his shoulder.  The owl regarded him silently before turning to look at Natu.  Both birds stared at each other before both tilted their heads, “Na-tu,” ”Noct-owl.”  Harry was a bit shocked that the bird on his shoulder was like Natu, but when he asked if that was the owl’s name it shook its head no.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry was spooked when the store clerk suddenly grabbed his other shoulder.  The clerk seemed surprised that the owl had approached him, and told Harry that she didn’t get along with most of the people who came through the store.  The clerk had offered to find an owl with a better temperament but Harry liked this owl and insisted he have her.  Hagrid bought Harry the owl, and Harry thanked him for the first birthday gift in his life.  Hagrid then brought Harry back to the station helping him carry all is new gear for school.  It was over hamburgers that Hagrid told Harry about his family, and how he had gained he fame by being the only known survivor of the the killing curse and killing the greatest dark lord of that time.  After lunch, he boarded the train and Hagrid gave him his ticket to board the train to Hogwarts and told him that if the Dursleys gave him any trouble to send his owl with a letter.  He then said goodbye as the train started to pull out of the station.  Harry sat on the train feeling giddy and anxious.  He was excited to go to Hogwarts but afraid of what would happen when he didn’t meet people’s expectations.</span>
