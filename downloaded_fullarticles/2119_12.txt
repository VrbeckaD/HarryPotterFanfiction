  <strong>EXT. HOGWARTS — DUSK</strong>
</p><p>CAPTION: <u>Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry 1966</u></p><p>The sun is setting behind the castle. The scene grows darker and darker by the second. There is an ominous feeling. Something isn't quite right.</p><p>
  <strong>INT. HEADMASTER'S OFFICE — NIGHT</strong>
</p><p>In the office sits ALBUS DUMBLEDORE (85, Wizarding). Old face, young eyes. He seems to be waiting for something.</p><p>There is a knock on the door. He looks up.</p><p align="center">DUMBLEDORE</p><p align="center">Enter.</p><p>TOM RIDDLE (40) enters. Pale. Snake-like eyes. Hollow face of a once-handsome man.</p><p align="center">DUMBLEDORE</p><p align="center">Good evening, Tom.</p><p>Dumbledore gestures to the chair across from him.</p><p align="center">DUMBLEDORE</p><p align="center">Won't you sit down?</p><p>Tom sits.</p><p align="center">TOM RIDDLE</p><p align="center">Thank you.</p><p align="center">(lightly)</p><p align="center">I heard that you had become headmaster. A worthy choice.</p><p align="center">DUMBLEDORE</p><p align="center">I am glad you approve. May I offer you a drink?</p><p align="center">TOM RIDDLE</p><p align="center">That would be welcome. I have come a long way.</p><p>Dumbledore stands and walks behind his desk. He pours one goblet of wine and hands it to Tom Riddle, then pours another before sitting back down.</p><p align="center">DUMBLEDORE</p><p align="center">So, Tom...to what do I owe the pleasure?</p><p>A moment of silence. Tom sips his wine.</p><p align="center">TOM RIDDLE</p><p align="center">They do not call me 'Tom' anymore. These days, I am known as —</p><p align="center">DUMBLEDORE</p><p align="center">(smiling)</p><p align="center">I know what you are known as. But to me, I'm afraid, you will always be Tom Riddle. It is one of the irritating things about old teachers. I am afraid that they never quite forget their charges' youthful beginnings.</p><p>Dumbledore raises his goblet lightly. The room suddenly feels colder. Tom Riddle's eyes lose any shine.</p><p align="center">TOM RIDDLE</p><p align="center">(slowly)</p><p align="center">I am surprised you have remained here so long. I always wondered why a wizard such as yourself never wished to leave school.</p><p align="center">DUMBLEDORE</p><p align="center">(still smiling)</p><p align="center">Well, to a wizard such as myself, there can be nothing more important than passing on ancient skills, helping hone young minds. If I remember correctly, you once saw the attraction of teaching too.</p><p align="center">TOM RIDDLE</p><p align="center">(shortly)</p><p align="center">I still do.</p><p align="center">(more calculating)</p><p align="center">I merely wondered why you — who are so often asked for advice by the Ministry, and who have twice, I think, been offered the post of Minister —</p><p align="center">DUMBLEDORE</p><p align="center">Three times at the last count, actually. But the Ministry never attracted me as a career. Again, something we have in common, I think.</p><p>Dumbledore tilts his head down to look at Tom above his spectacles. Tom Riddle remains cold and takes another sip of wine. There is another long moment of silence.</p><p align="center">TOM RIDDLE</p><p align="center">(speaking quietly)</p><p align="center">I have returned. Later, perhaps, than Professor Dippet expected...but I have returned, nevertheless, to request again what he once told me I was too young to have. I have come to you to ask that you permit me to return to this castle, to teach. I think you must know that I have seen and done much since I left this place. I could show and tell your students things they can gain from no other wizard.</p><p>Dumbledore considers the request for a moment.</p><p align="center">DUMBLEDORE</p><p align="center">(disapproving)</p><p align="center">Yes, I certainly do know that you have seen and done much since leaving us. Rumours of your doings have reached your old school, Tom. I should be sorry to believe half of them.</p><p align="center">TOM RIDDLE</p><p align="center">Greatness inspires envy, envy engenders spite, spite spawns lies. You must know this, Dumbledore.</p><p align="center">DUMBLEDORE</p><p align="center">You call it "greatness", what you have been doing, do you?</p><p>Tom Riddle begins to get angry.</p><p align="center">TOM RIDDLE</p><p align="center">Certainly. I have experimented; I have pushed the boundaries of magic further, perhaps, than they have ever been pushed —</p><p align="center">DUMBLEDORE</p><p align="center">(quiet, but firm)</p><p align="center">Of some kinds of magic. Of some. Of others, you remain...forgive me...woefully ignorant.</p><p>Tom Riddle smiles eerily, showing us how far gone he is as VOLDEMORT.</p><p align="center">TOM RIDDLE</p><p align="center">(softly)</p><p align="center">The old argument. But nothing I have seen in the world has supported your famous pronouncements that love is more powerful than my kind of magic, Dumbledore.</p><p align="center">DUMBLEDORE</p><p align="center">Perhaps you have been looking in the wrong places.</p><p align="center">TOM RIDDLE</p><p align="center">Well, then, what better place to start my fresh researches than here, at Hogwarts? Will you let me return? Will you let me share my knowledge with your students? I place myself and my talents at your disposal. I am yours to command.</p><p>Tom leans forwards, as if giving himself over.</p><p align="center">DUMBLEDORE</p><p align="center">And what will become of those whom you command? What will happen to those who call themselves — or so rumour has it — the Death Eaters?</p><p>Tom seems visibly shocked at the name. His eyes slit and his nostrils flare.</p><p align="center">TOM RIDDLE</p><p align="center">My friends...will carry on without me, I am sure.</p><p align="center">DUMBLEDORE</p><p align="center">I am glad to hear that you consider them friends. I was under the impression that they are more in the order of servants.</p><p align="center">TOM RIDDLE</p><p align="center">(quickly)</p><p align="center">You are mistaken.</p><p align="center">DUMBLEDORE</p><p align="center">Then if I were to go to the Hog's Head tonight, I would not find a group of them — Nott, Rosier, Mulciber, Dolohov — awaiting your return? Devoted friends indeed, to travel this far with you on a snowy night, merely to wish you luck as you attempted to secure a teaching post.</p><p align="center">TOM RIDDLE</p><p align="center">You are omniscient as ever, Dumbledore.</p><p align="center">DUMBLEDORE</p><p align="center">(small smile)</p><p align="center">Oh no, merely friendly with the local barmen. Now, Tom...</p><p>Dumbledore sets down his glass and sits up straighter.</p><p align="center">DUMBLEDORE</p><p align="center">Let us speak openly. Why have you come here tonight, surrounded by henchmen, to request a job we both know you do not want?</p><p align="center">TOM RIDDLE</p><p align="center">(genuinely surprised)</p><p align="center">A job I do not want? On the contrary, Dumbledore, I want it very much.</p><p align="center">DUMBLEDORE</p><p align="center">Oh, you want to come back to Hogwarts, but you do not want to teach any more than you wanted to when you were eighteen. What is it you're after, Tom? Why not try an open request for once?</p><p align="center">TOM RIDDLE</p><p align="center">(sneering)</p><p align="center">If you do not want to give me a job —</p><p align="center">DUMBLEDORE</p><p align="center">(firmly)</p><p align="center">Of course I don't. And I don't think for a moment you expected me to. Nevertheless, you came here, you asked, you must have had a purpose.</p><p>Tom Riddle stands up angrily. He truly looks like Voldemort.</p><p align="center">TOM RIDDLE</p><p align="center">This is your final word?</p><p>Dumbledore also stands up, but much more gently.</p><p align="center">DUMBLEDORE</p><p align="center">(with a nod)</p><p align="center">It is.</p><p align="center">TOM RIDDLE</p><p align="center">Then we have nothing more to say to each other.</p><p align="center">DUMBLEDORE</p><p align="center">(sadly)</p><p align="center">No, nothing.</p><p align="center">(pause)</p><p align="center">The time is long gone when I could frighten you with a burning wardrobe and force you to make repayment for your crimes. But I wish I could, Tom...I wish I could...</p><p>Tom's hand twitches as if he is about to reach for his WAND but then decides against it. Instead, Tom Riddle turns around and storms out of the office.</p><p>

  <strong>INT. HEAD OF AURORS'S OFFICE — DAY</strong>
</p><p>CAPTION: <u>FIVE YEARS LATER</u></p><p>VINCENT FAWLEY (50s), the Head of the Auror Office, sits at the desk. There is a distant sound of a door being opened and a person rushing in.</p><p>The WIRELESS (Wizarding radio) is playing in the background.</p><p align="center">WIRELESS (V.O.)</p><p align="center">— killed a Muggle family of five in Crawley, Sussex. No Dark Mark was found at the scene, but a witness claims to have seen bright green lights from inside the house before the family was found killed. Muggle reports cannot determine a cause of death...</p><p>A LETTER is slammed onto the desk.</p><p>This is done by DORCAS MEADOWES (21). Dark hair, dark skin. Confident. Ambitious.</p><p align="center">DORCAS</p><p align="center">What the bloody hell is this?</p><p>Fawley continues writing. He is not surprised by this visit.</p><p align="center">WIRELESS (V.O.)</p><p align="center">Minister for Magic Eugenia Jenkins has not yet made any significant advancements towards this rising threat. Muggle murders are becoming more and more frequent and many are wondering who is rallying these Death Eaters and what they might do next...</p><p align="center">FAWLEY</p><p align="center">A rejection.</p><p align="center">DORCAS</p><p align="center">(unamused)</p><p align="center">I got that, but —</p><p align="center">FAWLEY</p><p align="center">I'm afraid we could not accept your application.</p><p align="center">DORCAS</p><p align="center">Why not? You know I am more competent than all the other applicants —</p><p>Fawley looks up from his paperwork, losing his patience. He turns off the wireless.</p><p align="center">FAWLEY</p><p align="center">Dorcas —</p><p align="center">DORCAS</p><p align="center">(continuous)</p><p align="center">I got Outstanding in all my N.E.W.T.s, you've seen what I can do. There's a war brewing out there and you're understaffed and could use Aurors with Healer training. So, explain to me how in Merlin's name I didn't get accepted!</p><p align="center">FAWLEY</p><p align="center">Look, Dorcas. You were an exceptional applicant, but given your family history...</p><p align="center">(beat)</p><p align="center">You know we can't take any risks here.</p><p align="center">DORCAS</p><p align="center">And you know better than anyone that I was the one who brought him in. It should be a non-issue.</p><p align="center">FAWLEY</p><p align="center">That may be the case, but it still makes you too close.</p><p align="center">(sincere)</p><p align="center">I know you have had a difficult year. And I admire your resilience.</p><p>Fawley stands.</p><p align="center">FAWLEY</p><p align="center">As you said, we're seeing the beginnings of a civil war here, and your brother was one of the ones preparing to fight against us. There's no room for error.</p><p>Fawley walks over to the door to lead Dorcas out.</p><p align="center">DORCAS</p><p align="center">(desperate)</p><p align="center">Please, Vincent, you know me. You know I don't buy into that pure-blood nonsense.</p><p align="center">FAWLEY</p><p align="center">I get you want to help people. And you can. You're almost done with your Mediwizard training and Merlin knows we need some good Healers. It's what your mother would have wanted.</p><p>Dorcas gives him one last look before storming out of the office.</p><p>ALASTOR MOODY (late 30s) walks in. He barely avoids hitting her.</p><p>A good look at Moody: hard features, face fully intact, somewhat optimistic yet rough. Almost unrecognisable as the "Mad-Eye" we are used to.</p><p align="center">MOODY</p><p align="center">That the girl who turned in Damien Meadowes?</p><p>Fawley nods and grabs a FOLDER from a pile, offering it to Moody. Moody goes to sit down at the desk and begins flipping through quickly. It is Dorcas's application.</p><p>SHOW: Cover photo, N.E.W.T. qualifications, aptitude test results, recommendation signed by Dumbledore, Mediwizard training progress files.</p><p align="center">FAWLEY</p><p align="center">She applied to be an Auror.</p><p align="center">MOODY</p><p align="center">(gruff)</p><p align="center">Good. We need fighters like her.</p><p align="center">FAWLEY</p><p align="center">I rejected the application.</p><p>Moody remains calm, yet surprised.</p><p align="center">FAWLEY</p><p align="center">She's a Meadowes. She's his sister.</p><p>Moody takes in this information. He is understanding, but...</p><p align="center">MOODY</p><p align="center">Sounds like the perfect Auror to me.</p><p>Fawley ceases his shuffling, visibly shocked.</p><p align="center">FAWLEY</p><p align="center">You think I should have accepted her?</p><p align="center">MOODY</p><p align="center">Perhaps it's risky, but we could do with some fresh minds with the rising threats. She already proved she can make the hard choice.</p><p>Moody closes the folder and puts it back down on the desk.</p><p align="center">MOODY</p><p align="center">I say it's a risk worth taking.</p><p>Fawley plops down into his chair and takes another look at the application.</p><p align="center">MOODY</p><p align="center">Anyway, I came in here to let you know that McKinnon is out this morning. Taking his daughter to King's Cross as it's her first year 'n all.</p><p>Moody gets up and walks to the door.</p><p align="center">MOODY</p><p align="center">And Vincent, think about the girl.</p><p>Fawley nods and looks back down at Dorcas's application in contemplation.</p><p align="right">DISSOLVE TO:</p><p>
  <strong>INT. MAIN AUROR OFFICE — DAY (LATER)</strong>
</p><p>Moody is deep in paperwork, as are others in cubicles nearby. It's obvious there's been some time since his conversation with the Head.</p><p>Fawley opens the door of his office for a brief moment.</p><p align="center">FAWLEY</p><p align="center">Alastor, looks like you've got yourself a new trainee.</p><p>Fawley closes the door. Moody smirks.</p><p>
  <strong>INT. KING'S CROSS STATION — DAY</strong>
</p><p>SHOW: CLOCK. 10:40 o'clock.</p><p>The station is bright and bustling. A family of four walking quickly around a single cart. This is the EVANS FAMILY.</p><p>LILY EVANS (11) is looking around as she hurries with her family. PETUNIA EVANS (14) is not wearing a pleasant look. She throws a glare at her sister. Their PARENTS (both in their 40s) rush ahead.</p><p>They pass a Platform 8...Platform 9...Platform —</p><p align="center">PETUNIA</p><p align="center">Ten! It's nine, then ten! I knew this was all just rubbish! Nine and three-quarters...I knew it.</p><p align="center">MRS. EVANS</p><p align="center">Oh, Petunia. Remember that lady explained that the platform was hidden by some kind of magic.</p><p align="center">LILY</p><p align="center">(excited)</p><p align="center">Yes! Severus said you had to go between platforms nine and ten.</p><p align="center">PETUNIA</p><p align="center">(appalled)</p><p align="center">Are you mad? Are they mad? That boy...he's leading you on! Making you out to look like a bloody idiot running into that wall.</p><p align="center">MR. EVANS</p><p align="center">(warning)</p><p align="center">Petunia...</p><p>Mr. Evans is disapproving of Petunia's rudeness.</p><p>But Lily did not hear Petunia's remarks. She is focused on two teenagers — FRANK LONGBOTTOM (15) and ALICE FAWLEY (15) — and an older woman — AUGUSTA LONGBOTTOM (late 30s) — rushing through the station. One cart has an OWL in a cage. The three pause for a moment and glance around before running at full speed into the wall.</p><p>They VANISH.</p><p align="center">LILY</p><p align="center">(excited)</p><p align="center">Did you see that?</p><p>Lily points at the wall. Her parents and Petunia follow her finger.</p><p align="center">PETUNIA</p><p align="center">See what?</p><p align="center">LILY</p><p align="center">They just went through! Sev was right!</p><p>Lily grabs hold of her cart with determination. She's going to go through.</p><p align="center">PETUNIA</p><p align="center">Lily, don't be ridiculous. You'll hurt yourself!</p><p>Lily begins to run. A moment of doubt hits her just as she's about to hit the platform wall, but then...</p><p align="right">CUT TO:</p><p>
  <strong>INT. PLATFORM NINE AND THREE-QUARTERS — DAY</strong>
</p><p>Lily runs through the platform wall. At first, it seems empty, and then she goes around the corner...</p><p>SIGN: Platform 9¾</p><p>There are hundreds of people. Many of them are in robes, but a few are in Muggle clothes. There are owls flying around and in cages; children excitedly hugging their parents as they get ready for their new adventure.</p><p>A red train with "The Hogwarts Express" painted on the side stands at the edge of the platform.</p><p>Lily's parents and Petunia emerge from the other side. Petunia's face looks sour. There's no doubt their parents had to drag her through.</p><p>They make their way into the crowd.</p><p align="right">CUT TO:</p><p>Alice fusses with her owl's cage. Daughter of previously seen Head of Auror Office Vincent Fawley. Gryffindor robes on top of her Muggle clothes. Newly appointed Prefect, indicated by the badge pinned to her robes.</p><p>With her is Frank, also with Gryffindor robes.</p><p>Mrs. Longbottom stands with them.</p><p align="center">MRS. LONGBOTTOM</p><p align="center">Now, Frank, I better not hear about any of this funny business of yours this year!</p><p align="center">ALICE</p><p align="center">I'll be sure to keep him in check, Mrs. Longbottom.</p><p align="center">FRANK</p><p align="center">Oi! I'm perfectly capable of taking care of myself, you two!</p><p align="center">MRS. LONGBOTTOM</p><p align="center">Tell that to the pile of letters I've received from your professors. Trouble finds you, my boy.</p><p>Alice laughs. Frank frowns.</p><p>In the distance, ADELINA MCKINNON (late 30s) waves to Mrs. Longbottom.</p><p align="center">MRS. LONGBOTTOM</p><p align="center">Now, if you'll excuse me, dear Adelina is calling for me. I trust you two can handle yourselves for a moment?</p><p>Frank nods. Mrs. Longbottom trots off to chat with her friend.</p><p align="center">FRANK</p><p align="center">I'm not that big of a troublemaker, am I, Al?</p><p align="center">ALICE</p><p align="center">(doubtful)</p><p align="center">I mean...I'm sure there could be worse!</p><p>Frank looks mildly insulted.</p><p align="center">ALICE</p><p align="center">But — well...Well, I know you have good intentions.</p><p>Alice playfully pats Frank on the cheek. He pouts.</p><p align="right">CUT TO:</p><p>SEVERUS (11) and EILEEN SNAPE (42) stand together on the platform. The boy is incredibly skinny, with long, black hair and a large nose. He is wearing unfitting and dirty Muggle clothes.</p><p align="center">SEVERUS</p><p align="center">Mum, I'm fine. No need to fuss.</p><p>Mrs. Snape stops.</p><p align="center">MRS. SNAPE</p><p align="center">I just want everything to be perfect. It's your first year at Hogwarts!</p><p align="center">SEVERUS</p><p align="center">Yeah, yeah. It'll be fine. I've got a friend.</p><p>Severus glances over at LILY some ways away.</p><p>Lily appears to be arguing with her sister. Her parents are off to the side, talking with the POTTERS (both in their 70s, Wizarding).</p><p align="center">LILY</p><p align="center">I'm sorry, Tuney, I'm sorry! Listen —</p><p>Lily grabs Petunia's hand. Petunia tries to pull away, but Lily holds on tight.</p><p align="center">LILY</p><p align="center">Maybe once I'm there — no, listen, Tuney! Maybe once I'm there, I'll be able to go to Professor Dumbledore and persuade him to change his mind!</p><p align="center">PETUNIA</p><p align="center">I don't — want — to — go!</p><p>Petunia finally manages to escape Lily's grasp.</p><p align="center">PETUNIA</p><p align="center">You think I want to go to some stupid castle and learn to be a — a —</p><p>Petunia fades away and looks at their surroundings.</p><p>SHOW: OWLS hooting in their cages, students in robes and holding WANDS, the HOGWARTS EXPRESS.</p><p align="center">PETUNIA</p><p align="center">— you think I want to be a — a freak?</p><p align="center">LILY</p><p align="center">(sadly)</p><p align="center">I'm not a freak. That's a horrible thing to say.</p><p align="center">PETUNIA</p><p align="center">That's where you're going. A special school for freaks. You and that Snape boy...weirdos, that's what you two are. It's good you're being separated from normal people. It's for our own safety.</p><p>Lily desperately looks to her parents, but they are busy getting an introduction from the Potters. She looks back at Petunia with a quiet rage.</p><p align="center">LILY</p><p align="center">You didn't think it was such a freak's school when you wrote to the headmaster and begged him to take you.</p><p align="center">PETUNIA</p><p align="center">(turning red)</p><p align="center">Beg? I didn't beg!</p><p align="center">LILY</p><p align="center">I saw his reply. It was very kind.</p><p align="center">PETUNIA</p><p align="center">(whispering)</p><p align="center">You shouldn't have read — that was my private — how could you — ?</p><p>Lily tilts her head towards Severus subtly.

He cautiously walks in.</p><p align="center">JAMES</p><p align="center">D'you mind?</p><p>Lily does not say anything. James sits down. He looks at her again, waiting for her to protest.

Now, before you take your seats beside your classmates, you must be sorted into your Houses. The four Houses are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin.

You will have classes with the rest of your House and year, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free time in your House common room.

</p><p>The Great Hall is a magnificent room. It is huge, with four long tables taking up most of the space.

People of various ages occupy it — the PROFESSORS.</p><p>At the front of it all, there is a hat sat upon a stool. This is the SORTING HAT.</p><p>The group of first years walks down the middle.
