    <p>Harry sat by the lake by himself.  Exams were done, and he could hear the laughter of other students around him in the warm air.  The Giant Squid basked in the shallows nearby, as Fred and George Weasley tickled it.  The mountains in the distance were misty, a beautiful picture against the cloudless blue sky.<br/>
“Is anyone sitting here?” a soft voice asked from behind Harry.<br/>
He looked over to see none other than Draco Malfoy sit beside him.<br/>
“I want to start over,” Draco said, his pale grey eyes seeming sincere, and almost regretful, “I’ve been so awful to you all this time, but I wanted to be friends.”<br/>
They sat in silence for a moment, as Harry thought about this.  He had always thought of Draco as a spoiled rich boy, who was very stuck up and mean, but now, he realized that Draco was a lot more than that.<br/>
“We can start over,” Harry smiled.  He hadn’t noticed before, how Draco’s blond hair shimmered in the sunlight, how his grey eyes were full of intelligence.<br/>
“Follow me!” Draco called.  He stood quickly and ran towards the Forbidden Forest.  Harry laughed and ran after him.<br/>
No one seemed to notice as the two boys disappeared from the grounds into the dark of the forest.<br/>
Draco stopped, and turned back to Harry, his grin sheepish, “I’ve been wanting to tell you this for a long time, but I, uh, I like you Harry.”<br/>
Harry blushed.  Suddenly, he felt the same way.  Or maybe he had always felt this way.<br/>
“I think…  like you too Draco,” Harry said, and he hugged the other boy fiercely.<br/>
Draco leaned into the hug, and the two boys walked back out onto the grounds.  They lay happily next to each other, and talked, through the whole afternoon, and long after everyone else had gone.  When the sun was setting, Draco and Harry both sat up to watch the mountains glowing with the beams of pink, yellow, and orange light.<br/>
“It’s so beautiful,” Draco breathed.  He had never before stopped to notice things like sunsets.  But now that he and Harry loved each other, he felt like he could.  Draco didn’t need to worry about being a pureblood anymore or upholding his family’s legacy.  He didn’t care about pleasing his father, because he had Harry.<br/>
And the boys fell asleep together on the shore of the lake, until the moon was high, and Harry woke again.<br/>
He levitated Draco gently, and slowly carried him through the halls to the Slytherin dorm.  Draco had told him where it was, and the password, because he trusted him so much.<br/>
“Goodnight Draco,” Harry said, kissing the boy lightly on the cheek before he slipped quietly away.</p>
