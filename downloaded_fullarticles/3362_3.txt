    <p align="justify">With her temples leaning on the cold window of the moving train, Hermione had her lips pressed together tightly - rubbing them against each other anxiously. She felt the grittiness of the micro-glitter in her lipgloss and the thought of her makeup maybe being a mistake crossed her mind once again. She had never understood the point in makeup. What was it for, what went where and why? Her mindset had only changed when the Yule Ball came along in year four and she saw how much potential her face actually had with a little bit of colour here and there. Even though she hadn't touched the stuff after that one night it stayed in the back of her mind until this summer. Her and Ginny were fooling around one night and decided together that it might be time for a new look. And now here she is, wearing a mini-skirt she never thought she would wear with tights - it was autumn after all - and a long sleeved top Ginny picked out for her when they were shopping during the holidays. </p><p align="justify"><br/> Hermione took out a muggle fashion magazine the girls picked up in a muggle shop in central London. Her lip twitched at how amusing it was to watch her best friend roaming around in the store, stunned by the different kinds of fashion and colours. A quiet sigh escaped her sticky lips as she flicked through the colourful pages, questioning the perfect bodies and faces she saw.</p><p align="justify"><br/> Her small body flinched at the sound of a knock on the window of the compartment. The girl flashed a smile at the two redheads that now entered the small room. </p><p align="justify"><br/> Hermione still couldn't believe how much her best girlfriend had changed in such a short period of time. Her hair flowed down like silk and her skin had cleared up so much that she was wondering if Ginny might have used a spell or potion for that. The new confidence suited her very well and even though her body looked nothing like the girls in the magazines she looked almost breathtaking. At least in she did Hermiones  opinion. Trying to fight the little, raising bubble of jealousy that brewed inside her she now looked over to Ron. It took her by surprise that it actually seemed like he had some sort of stubble going on. She spotted little cuts along his throat and jawline, a clear sign that he started to shave. </p><p><br/> "Have you seen Harry yet?</p><p>Ginny's voice ripped Hermione out of her thoughts and she turned her head towards her friend who took a seat next to hear. </p><p>"Huh? Oh. No, I haven't actually. I sort of expected him to come along with you two."</p><p>A little frown appeared on her forehead.</p><p>"Maybe he's with Cho somewhere?"</p><p> "Doubt it."</p><p>Ron grunted, his voice deeper than it was the last time she heard him speak, and reached into his jacket to reveal a in clingfilm wrapped sandwich.The two of them sent letters over the last weeks of summer that Hermione didn't spend at the burrow but with her muggle family on vacation in Edinburgh.</p><p> "She wrote him that she feels like they would be better off as friends or something. 'dunno."</p><p>The redhead explained before biting a chunk out of his meal. Some things might never change, Hermione thought to herself as she faced Rons sister once again. Her little frown increased slightly when she noticed that her top was more filled than usual. Was she wearing a push-up bra? Did they exist in the magic world? Or did she purchase one when they were in this muggle store and didn't notice?</p><p>"Hey, are you still seeing Dean, Ginny? He seemed to be really into you, y'know."</p><p>Hermione asked to keep the conversation up. The girl shook her head. Ginny and Dean were seeing each other for a little while before the holidays started.</p><p> <br/> "Too much drama. I called it quits just a few days after we saw each other last, Mione. I wanted to write you but I felt like I wanted to have some things to talk about when we see each other again! But now that I think about it, it really isn't worth the hassle. He was a little too clingy for my liking."</p><p>Ginny shrugged it off. Ron scoffed quietly. He wasn't very talkative today and Hermione started to wonder why.</p><p>Ginnys brother scoffed quietly to what his sister said but continued to devour his sandwich. The redhead crossed her legs and her over-knee boot clicked against the metal of her seat. It didn't matter who she was speaking of, Ron never approved of anyone. But if she'd be honest, it didn't faze her one bit. She just turned sixteen and definitely was old enough to make her own decisions when it came down to boys.</p><p>She had to admit that she was more than pleasantly surprised to see that her best friend actually stuck with what she had planned. She looked quite different - in a good way! Hermiones hair was braided to one side, some stubborn stray hairs still poking out but everyone knew that her hair is nearly untameable. Her eyes were framed by dark eyelashes and her cheeks had a hint of rosy flush which Ginny wasn't sure of if it was natural or not. And then of course her lips that looked twice as plump as they usually did. Hermione might have been older than the Weasley girl but in the end it was Ginnys idea to give themselves a little makeover.<br/><br/> She caught her brother staring at Hermione with his jaw slowly dropping before they entered the train compartment. It came to no surprise that this boy was so surprised by Hermiones looks. The normally rather prude girl that always had her nose stuck in some sort of book wore makeup and a short skirt that was not part of the uniform. She didn't blame him - her jaw would have dropped as well.</p><p> "Sorry guys! How were your holidays Hermione? Blimey! You look different!"</p><p>Harrys voice suddenly appeared out of nowhere and the boys leaned down to give his best friends a hug. He looked good. He didn't show any beard growth like Ron did but his voice definitely sounded deeper than it did the year before and he dressed nicer. Much nicer. This leather jacket suited him. Ginny caught herself biting down on her rosé painted lips.</p><p>After the boy took his seat next to Ron they all engulfed into a chit chat about the past summer and what happened. Harry explained that he just saw Cho and they talked it out - obviously with a happy ending, according to his swollen lips and even more messed up hair. Ginnys brother went on and on about how he is not looking forward to potions this year since it even drove the twins absolutely bonkers when they were in year six and Hermione talked about the gloomy weather in Edinburgh and all the runes they had visited.</p><p>And somehow Ginny just knew that this year was going to be one hell of a ride.</p>
