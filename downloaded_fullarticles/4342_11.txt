    <p align="center">***</p><p>By seven o’clock in the evening Remus had finished putting the dishes away in the cupboards, made all of the beds, washed and hung the clothing out to dry, and then stood in his small room on the ground-floor and tugged his sweat soaked shirt over his head.<br/><br/> He dropped it beside the bed, pocketed his wand, and trudged out into the back garden.<br/><br/> At the bottom where the ground sloped down and a decades-old rotten fence gave itself up to the wildness of the moors beyond, Remus stopped and took a deep breath.<br/><br/> Tipping his head up, he allowed himself a moment to admire the pastel smudge of the clouds on the horizon, a stretch of his aching bones, and then kept on going.<br/><br/> He knew he could walk this route in his sleep by now, felt so strung-out and exhausted that he felt almost compelled to close his eyes and let his feet lead him there.<br/><br/> But then, he noted, the times he almost stepped on an adder or tripped into a swamp, and so kept his eyes on the wild countryside that threw itself down at his feet the further he walked in, and soon he could hardly see the edge of the city over his shoulder.<br/><br/> The lights of the back of the housing estate blurred and soon enough they were hidden by the hills.<br/><br/> It was perhaps another fifteen minutes or so before he passed the first of the signs. Remus reached out and brushed his fingers over the wood out of habit as he passed one on his right.<br/><br/> He put this one in himself, he recalled; a replacement for the one he had come across when first shown to the site; a rotten heap in the grass.<br/><br/> The waist-high panel was accompanied by several dozen, positioned at 20 yard intervals around the perimeter, warning ramblers of treacherous bog beyond, and diverted them off to the East or West, depending how directly they were about to walk towards the shacks.<br/><br/> Ten minutes beyond them, Remus stopped in front of three small wooden buildings, not unlike the average Muggle shed, sitting back to back with one another.<br/><br/> The Disillusionment charm made them waver before his eyes, and he he had to squint slightly to see them before stepping inside the boundary.<br/><br/> He shivered in the breeze that had picked up since the sun had begun to set, and set himself to putting down the usual series of concealing charms and protective wards around the place.<br/><br/> All colour had begun to drain from the clouds by this time. The sky was now stained as if with charcoal, except at the ever-diminishing point on the horizon where the sun was sinking itself.<br/><br/> His bones, in response, had started to weigh heavy inside his body, and the lethargy and dim light made him want to sink to the ground like the sun. He groaned aloud and plodded on.<br/> <br/> These were the worst moments, Remus reflected. If he ever came across somebody who asked, Remus would like to surprise them with this information.<br/><br/> It’s not the change, he would tell them, though that part is horrific, but the time just beforehand, when you have to face the fact of what you are; alone.<br/><br/> Deep in his thoughts, Remus had moved a circle around the buildings and as he raised his wand for the final ward to close the gap, he was snapped violently back to reality by a body, hurling itself through the underbrush from his right and colliding with him so forcefully that they were both knocked off their feet into the dirt.<br/><br/> There was a resulting scuffle, within which punches were thrown and hands attempted to wrap around throats, but finally Remus grabbed a handful of the stranger’s cloak and tugged them around until they were pinned neatly between his knees.<br/><br/> The grappling had inadvertently landed them in a puddle of mud, and after a moment of coughing together and swiping mud out of their mouths, Remus pressed the tip of his wand to a point just above the attacker’s Adam’s apple.<br/><br/> “Wait, wait!”<br/><br/> The voice was male and refined, and there was a hint of frustration amidst the pleading tone.<br/><br/> Remus tugged at the cloth between his fingers, felt the roughness of an embroidered coat of arms, and noted a faint recognition of the symbols.<br/><br/> “What is this?” Remus asked, still panting from the exertion, and tugged the crest up towards the man’s eyes. “Who are you? Some Pureblood hunter, or something?”<br/><br/> A shake of the head rustled the grass beneath him. Remus bristled at the refusal to open his mouth for answers, and for that Remus pressed him further into the earth.<br/><br/> “What do you think you’re doing?” he snapped. “Do you know how much danger you’re in, running in here?”<br/><br/> The man tried to reach up for the wand, but Remus grasped his wrist tightly and pressed it into the dirt beside his head. The other hand was already being slowly crushed beneath his right knee.<br/><br/> “Ow! Okay! Okay, I’m sorry- I’m sorry, all right? I’m just trying to get away from the city, I’m not here for anything.”<br/><br/> “Didn’t you see the signs?” Remus growled, the blood heating in him now as the last rays of sun eked away. “Didn’t you think that maybe there was a reason--”<br/><br/> “I was in a rush! I’m sorry I missed your private party notices!” the stranger retorted sarcastically, bucking beneath Remus in an attempt to throw him off.<br/><br/> Remus, in retaliation, took him by a firmer hold at the scruff of the neck and shoved him harder into the dirt for emphasis.<br/><br/> “They were <em> Ministry-sanctioned werewolf warning notices </em> , you fucking idiot!”<br/><br/> The body went very still beneath him as the information sank in, and then Remus could almost feel him trying to recoil away.<br/><br/> It struck Remus, as it always did, how much the response continued to sting him, each and every time he encountered it.<br/><br/> In response, he simply let go and pushed himself up out of the soil, to turn his back on the stranger.<br/><br/> “Just get out,” he sighed, and gestured to the gap still to be closed in the wards. “Fast, like.”<br/><br/> Instead of the scurrying sound of a person escaping the enclosure of a werewolf just minutes from a change, Remus heard the distinct rustling of a body picking itself up and lingering behind him.<br/><br/> He turned to see the man holding out a pouch.<br/><br/> The cloak and hood were shifted back into place. It shielded his face from recognition in the darkness, but Remus could still see a smear of blood on his chin.<br/><br/> He stood just a step or so too far back, as if the extra distance would save him if Remus transformed suddenly, or decided to attack again.<br/><br/> “Thank you for sparing my life,” the stranger said, uncertainly. “Please accept this money as thanks.”<br/><br/> Remus stared, and it suddenly occurred to him how he recognised the coat of arms. The stars should have given it away, but the thoughtless tossing of money around really slotted the final piece into place - The Noble and Most Ancient House of Black, <em> of course</em>.<br/><br/> “I don’t need your money,” Remus lied, exhausted now. “Just hurry up and <em> get out </em> .”<br/><br/> “Then, please,” the stranger continued, “accept it in return for your silence. If you hear anybody in search of a Black, tell them you saw nothing.”<br/><br/> “Whatever,” Remus grumbled, struggling valiantly against that final tug. “Now fuck off.”<br/><br/> He turned away and there was the sound of a bag of coins being dropped on the ground, and when he looked back, the man was gone.<br/><br/> Barely a minute later Remus was locked inside one of the sheds. He knelt on the ground and gave himself over to the wolf, and in those last few seconds of agony did he only slightly curse himself for accepting the bribe of a Black. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">*** </p><p> </p><p><br/> An hour prior to Remus leaving the house and setting out for the site, in a distant part of the city, Sirius Black stood back from his handiwork on the wall and grinned.<br/><br/> He dropped to knife into the carpet, where it stuck in the wood with a thud and stood upright.<br/><br/> He then paced to the door, heaved the wrought-iron doorstop into his arms, walked to the window, and threw it.<br/><br/> The resulting crash was thrillingly loud. If he had stayed around long enough to find out, he would have known that it had woken the entire household and several of the neighbours - both magical and Muggle - but by the time his mother reached the doorway, he was gone.<br/><br/> Walburga Black blasted the door practically off its hinges and screamed with rage when she saw the room beyond.<br/><br/> A cool wind blew in through the broken window and glass littered the carpet, but most infuriating was the message slashed into the vintage silk damask wallpaper above the bed: ‘I would rather die’.<br/><br/> Reluctance was only natural, she knew, especially from someone his age, and it wasn’t like it was the first time he had ran away in response to this decision - hijacking the Floo, threatening the house elf to side-long apparate, and duelling his own father had all been effective but not long term.<br/><br/> It was a far more disgusting notion to Walburga Black to know that he had opted for an entirely un-magical method of escape this time around, and that she had been forced to consider it.<br/><br/> She stood at the window, felt the crunch of glass beneath her heel, and took a deep sobering breath of the fresh night air.<br/><br/> Finally, she turned to where the house elf, her husband, and her youngest son stood in the doorway, gaping openly at the scene. “Well he can die if he’d rather, but so long as that boy lives, he is my son and my heir, and he <em> will </em> be married by the end of the month.”</p><p> </p>
