    <p>It all started like everything in Hermione’s life seemed to, with the written word.<br/>
<br/>
Specifically “Story Of O”, one of the few books that caught her eye in the normal book store, a consultation prize while on vacation as they’d been unable to find L'allée Magique, the magical district of France.<br/>
<br/>
Well, to say that she only bought one book would have any that knew her laughing their heads off at the impossibility she was sure, but it had been the only one to really stick with her.  <br/>
<br/>
She hadn’t known what it was about of course, how could she when it was at a used book store and it had no book jacket?  She did what she always did in such a situation, went to first chapter and read the first page to see if it was any good.  Before she knew it was  on the second chapter being scolded lightly by her parents that it wasn’t a library.  Without so much as a by-your-leave her Mother had put it on the top of the stack laying on the counter only a few meters high.<br/>
<br/>
She told herself she’d read it last and only if there wasn’t anything else new to read, and as soon as they got to the hotel room that evening started on "French Ways and Their Meaning”, a book about the French and their culture and she told herself firmly that it was very interesting.<br/>
<br/>
She hadn’t really even wanted the other book after all.<br/>
<br/>
She was only 12, after all, far too young for such things!<br/>
<br/>
Her parents would disapprove.<br/>
<br/>
It took her ten minutes to finish the first page of “French Ways and Their Meaning”, an astronomical amount of time for her.  Somehow she couldn’t remember a bit, and in the end she switched books ever so grateful her parents trusted her to have a separate hotel room even as she abused that trust.</p>
<hr/><p>Emma Granger sneezed then looked in the direction of Hermione’s hotel room with a fond smile, ‘Aw, she’s reading it I bet!’<br/>
<br/>
“Mmmm!”  Emma’s husband Dan screamed into her and she reluctantly got off the face of the bound man letting him get a few breaths before sitting back down, one last thought hoping her Daughter enjoyed the book as much as she had.</p>
<hr/><p>The “Story of O” introduces us to "O", a young woman in a strange situation.  She is almost immediately forced into with what Hermione later learned was exhibitionism and it only gets more extreme from then on as she’s trained into being an obedient sex slave for any member of a secret society.  Tied, whipped, spanked, taken in every way Hermione could imagine and more than a few she had trouble picturing. </p><p>Ultimately O is branded and lead via a leash attached to a piercing on her labium, or to put it bluntly her vaginal lips into a crowded party not wearing a stitch save an Owlish mask, the guests ravaging her...<br/>
<br/>
She couldn’t believe what the book was doing to her, and as she fell asleep after binge reading it couldn’t help rubbing herself to it picturing herself as O being lead out into the great hall by a piercing, arms bound behind her and naught but an owl mask herself.  She believed it when she  had the best “O” of her life.<br/>
<br/>
Thank Merlin it had been at a hotel and her parents hadn’t had to be the ones to wash her sheets, and made a note on her day-planner to ask her parents to teach her to do laundry the Muggle way, just in case.</p>
<hr/><p>Of course, with any new topic of interest she researched it extensively and found related works including a sequel.<br/>
<br/>
Some of them were stomach turning to her such as many of “120 Days of Sodom”’s “600 passions” as the preface called it, and yet... and yet most of them still made her react. It started with Fathers raping their Daughters and got no better, many of the scenes disturbing, horrifying or just plain gross and yet her body still reacted to the tales within, sometimes with accompanying nausea it was true but not always and not as often as she went on.   She couldn’t help read the whole thing, at least as much as was written as it ended in unfulfilling drafts.  <br/>
<br/>
Her psychology books said it was perfectly normal though!<br/>
<br/>
Of course, she’d learned her lesson about books with Lockhart however, trust but verify and cross-reference what you read and most important of all, real world data trumps all.<br/>
<br/>
It’d have to be with someone she trusted of course- what her books called safe-words would have to be used.  She’d use the following year to find someone, and maybe slowly work her way up to that even if she had to ask every single damned person in Hogwarts out herself.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe even more extreme measures such as tying herself up and letting herself get discovered? She shuddered in delight and horror at the thought, what if it was Malfoy?  Oh Merlin, he’d be absolutely awful to her- that wasn’t a good thing Hermione scolded herself as her body reacted to that too</p>
<hr/><p>“-and lastly I expect you to keep knowledge of the time-turner from your fellow students.  I believe that is all, do you have any questions?”  Professor Mcgonagall finished<br/>
<br/>
Hermione uncharacteristically hadn’t been paying much attention to the lecture, too busy imagining what she would, er, could do with it.  Still, she was used to multitasking, and she got the ending.<br/>
<br/>
She was sure she could find a book for whatever she missed but more importantly keeping it a secret from Ron and Harry? Was she serious?<br/>
<br/>
“You know they’ll find out right? Just like last year Harry found the Chamber of Secrets that had been lost for a millennia and the year before that Harry found the Sorcerer’s Stone Professor.”  Hermione stated somewhat blandly, even as Professor Mcgonagall’s lips narrowed into a thin line, the barest hints of red on her cheeks.<br/>
<br/>
“Be that as it may Miss Granger the Unspeakables would like you to keep it secret lest they get flooded with requests or some such.  I do not pretend to understand how their minds work.  If that is all?”<br/>
<br/>
Hermione nodded, a little miffed that she had to keep a secret from her friends, but... They really probably would find out.  Okay, Harry would find out but he’d tell Ron.  She gulped, which meant they’d find out about her Summer reading, oh Merlin.<br/>
<br/>
“So what’d Mcgonagall want?” Harry asked having waited outside for her to return.<br/>
<br/>
“<em>Professor</em> Mcgonagall wanted to discuss my electives.” It was even true, she thought as Harry flinched at my correction amusing her like always, thankfully Daddy taught his daughter poker, it was ever so fun to mess with the boys.<br/>
<br/>
“Trying to get you to drop from the fifty classes you’re taking to something sane?”  Harry asked.<br/>
<br/>
Hermione snorted “I wish there were fifty classes, no she was just telling me when to go to what classes.”<br/>
<br/>
Harry looked suitably horrified at the thought, though she did wish there were more classes like all the mundane subjects, and maybe alchemy, though even she thought fifty was overdoing it a touch. </p>
<hr/><p>“I’m tellin’ you mate, the Chudley Cannons could really win it all this season.” Ron said definitively.<br/>
<br/>
“Sure Ron.”  Harry agreed with a shrug.  Hermione wondered if Ron would ever realize that Harry cared nearly as little about the Cannons as she did.<br/>
<br/>
“Hermione, you agree with me right?” Ron asked while chewing a pile of eggs the size of a chicken.  Ron Weasley was an idiot, but he was one of her idiots so she replied mostly amiably. “I’m sure they have as much chance as you remembering to not speak with your mouth full.”<br/>
<br/>
“Fanks!  Hey, wait!”  Ew.  Times like this she wished she had some friends that were girls, or that had some manners to talk with their mouths full.<br/>
<br/>
“Free period all today and every Tuesday!  Alright!” Ron pumped his fist and even Harry cracked a smile.<br/>
<br/>
“Ronald, free periods are meant to do your other homework, or you know, study!”  Hermione huffed not able to understand throwing away the ability to milk all you could out of magic.  Even her extra research books had magic in them!<br/>
<br/>
“Yeah yeah, you get off on that stuff but me, I’m going to be keeper for the Cannons, just you watch.”  Hermione frowned, did Ronald really have no other plan than that?  She suddenly pitied his Mother, and worse yet his future wife.  Then she saw the crumbs on his robes and resisted the urge to giggle- right, no worries there if he never gets one.   Yeah, Ron’s firmly out of the running.  She was seriously considering Harry though.   She doubted he would go for her though, not looking like she did, a major flaw in her plans she thought with a frown.<br/>
<br/>
“Hey, they’ve got your schedule mixed up, you’ve got Divination, Muggle Studies and Arithmancy all first period!  Has Mcgonagall lost her bloody remembrall?”  Ron pointed out, to which she snatched her schedule back.  She was furious, though mostly at herself- if Ron figured it out already she’d be ever so embarrassed- she’d figured on Harry maybe figuring it out in December or January, not Ronald on the first day!<br/>
<br/>
“Language!  That’s Professor Mcgonagall as well and no she hasn’t!”  Think Hermione, think!  Right.<br/>
<br/>
“She called me in yesterday with Harry- she told me to forget the schedule I’m given today since I’ll be with the other houses classes for some of my classes.”  That sounded alright didn’t it?  Come to think of it, it even made more sense than giving her a time-turner did.<br/>
<br/>
“Oh, so that’s what you two were talking about!”  Harry exclaimed.<br/>
<br/>
“Huh.” Ron said, sounding disappointed he hadn’t caught Professor Mcgonagall messing up.</p>
<hr/><p>Hermione wanted to pull her hair out the next morning.  Better yet, she wanted to pull out the author’s hair.<br/>
<br/>
“Superstitious nonsense, if it hasn’t happened yet then how in the world would they know something bad will happen?”  Hermione muttered over a short book that had most certainly been worth pleading for permission to read as it was for reasons unknown in the restricted section.<br/>
<br/>
“Really, why in the world would seeing yourself do anything?  Most of these possible examples are just illogical, I’m not going to purposely murder myself.”  Hermione grumbled, sliding "Timey Wimey Wibbly Wobbly” back where it belonged.  Well, back in the bookshelf at least, she was hardly going to throw a school book in the trash lest Madam Pince ban her from the library.<br/>
<br/>
Still, it did have some good information.  Time-turners didn’t age you- she hadn’t the faintest how that worked since the author didn’t know either, but it was good to know.  She would have been far more conservative otherwise, but now she wouldn’t have to worry about not sleeping enough- she’d just need to find someplace to sleep.<br/>
<br/>
That and for some reason it couldn’t go forward again if she spun one too many times- she’d have to be careful.   It was odd, Hermione thought, going forward should be far easier than going backwards...  Hermione’s eyes lit up, last year she had been petrified- and she hadn’t been happy to learn she’d missed months of school... Could petrification work as a sort of cryogenics?  </p><p><br/>
“Note to self, see laws about breeding basilisks and ask what Harry’s planning to do after school.” She could just imagine getting petrified and waking up hundreds if not thousands of years in the future- just think of all the new books that had yet to be written and progress yet to be made!<br/>
<br/>
Hermione browsed a bit during her daydreaming and grabbed a few books for light reading checking them out before heading to breakfast, finding more than one about her Summer research project to her surprise, then she rushed to the first classes of the year.</p>
<hr/><p>Deciding which class to subjectively take first on Wednesday was a hard decision, and in the end she decided to start off light with Muggle studies.  She was regretting it though.<br/>
<br/>
“-and so the Muggles invented elektricoty and with it invented a telebone to communicate much like the Floo-”  Hermione perked up, mostly it had been less fun than she had thought to learn how wizards thought about Muggles, but magicals could use a Floo to communicate, not just travel?  That was good to know, but why was this the first she was hearing about it now?  She would have loved to be able to talk to her parents at school!  <br/>
<br/>
To think Ron and Harry thought she wouldn’t learn anything in this class- she learned that Wizards were idiots with their heads in the sand and how to make a whole heap of pounds with her time-turner without going all the way home.<br/>
<br/>
As soon as the magical bell rang Hermione was out like a shot ducking into an alcove and quickly pulled out the time-turner. It was, she thought, rather cute.  An ornate hourglass that truly did look like a piece of the finest jewelry despite having an hourglass in it. She quickly gave it two spins and the world rushed backwards in the oddest sensation, almost as if she were momentarily as if she’d missed a stair.<br/>
<br/>
She shook it off and rushed to the library, she had research to do! </p>
<hr/><p>Hermione sighed, so much for Floo, at least until a Hogsmeade weekend.  Honestly, why couldn’t her parents have a Floo in their house?  It made no sense!  It wasn’t as if a fireplace would alert mundane guests that something strange was going on...Well, unless they saw someone go through it but really!  They could install it in a bedroom or the office!  She huffed.<br/>
Discrimination, she thought with a frown even as she walked to Arithmancy, the course that seemed the most interesting of the new courses save perhaps Runes.  She hoped it would improve her dour mood.<br/>
<br/>
Arithmancy sadly turned out to be boring and likely would remain so for ages.  Sure, it’d be nice to revise her math but she had already done that in the Summer, but it seemed she’d be doing it twice.  It turned out most purebloods didn’t know much math beyond addition and subtraction, a few students didn’t even know that much.  Still, she did learn that it’s about predicting things with math, not just the future or wand movements as she’d been led to believe, and sounded utterly fascinating.<br/>
<br/>
She felt like she needed a pick up from her pick-me-up, though she decided to go to Divination.<br/>
<br/>
It actually was interesting even if the teacher was a blatant fraud, well, maybe.  She did predict Neville dropping his cup...  Then again maybe Trelawney knew about  Neville being a bit clumsy?<br/>
<br/>
Ronald seemed to be a believer so she kept her peace, though that was tested as all through the walk to Transfiguration class Ron told Harry about how his Uncles supposedly died from seeing a Grim,making Harry worry about seeing it in his teacup.<br/>
<br/>
She sighed in relief as Mcgonagall helped ease the students’ minds. </p>
