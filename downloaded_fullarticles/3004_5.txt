  <span>It was said that the greatest romances budded from your first love. Thesus was not as lucky. As he stared into the eyes of his wife, there was no denying that he loved Leta with his entire being. However, this was a different type of love than that of his first. Because there was still no greater romance than a fall into the pits of the cold lake with the wild haired Ravenclaw boy. Because despite the sheering cold of the black waters that pulled him down to the shore, the sensation of skin against skin kept him warm. That was the beauty of falling, there was no telling if up is actually down or if down was actually up. Sure, Thesus found himself in the infirmary for hypothermia the next day, but when that grinning Quidditch Captain dropped by with a batch of brownies and soft kisses Theseus knew everything was worth it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He was the 7th year Ravenclaw Quidditch Captain— a seeker. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Thesus was a 6th year Hufflepuff— a chaser.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And falling was their specialty.</span>
