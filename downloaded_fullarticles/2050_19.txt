  <em>“Lucius, as my second in command, you know what is expected of you, correct?” </em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Of course, My Lord.” The blonde man replied with a sweeping bow. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p><em>“So you understand that in the event of my demise, </em>you<em> would become the next Dark Lord?”</em></p><p> </p><p>~!~</p><p> </p><p>The Final Battle had been… epic, to say the least. Everything had been going exactly as we had planned; well it <em>would </em>have if we had one to begin with. But it was all going in our favor, at least. Until after Neville killed Nagini, the last of Voldemort’s horcruxes. It was after that that things went horribly, horribly wrong.</p><p> </p><p>Well, that’s what I thought at the time. Now, I couldn’t be happier that it happened, because if it hadn’t, I wouldn’t have met the man of my dreams. Yes, I, Harry James Potter, Former Savior of the Wizarding World, am gay.</p><p> </p><p>Anyway, there was just me and him, Voldemort, and everyone else circled around us. Our wands were drawn and pointed at each other. I was speaking but not really paying attention to what I was saying, just trying to find the perfect moment to catch him off guard. That was when some coward hit me in the back with a stunner. I never did find out who it was, just that he was punished severely by the Dark Lord for interfering.</p><p> </p><p>When I came to, I was in a room I had never seen before. It was just barely light enough for me to make out that it was a bedroom. But who did it belong too? I had one idea that made me shudder and I couldn’t help but pray that I was wrong.</p><p> </p><p>Minutes after I came to awareness, two men entered the dark space, blindfolded me and bound my arms behind my back, though they didn’t have to. I was without my wand and I couldn’t possibly have hurt them, they being so much bigger than me and all. That was when I noticed I wasn’t even wearing my glasses, not that they were needed in the dark or while I was blindfolded.</p><p> </p><p>I was led out of the room and down a hallway, or so I assumed. There were many turns and I had a vague feeling that they may have been leading me in circles just to disorient me.</p><p> </p><p>We finally stopped and I heard the creak of an opening door. I know they took me into the room beyond because they shoved me pretty hard and my shoulder hit a doorframe.</p><p> </p><p>When we stopped again, I was unbound, turned and made to sit on what I figured out was a bed. “Where am I?” I asked but the men just chuckled as they left me alone.</p><p> </p><p>I waited.</p><p> </p><p>When no one came for me right away, I tried taking off the blindfold. But every time I touched it, it shocked me, so I laid back and stared at the inside of the cloth over my eyes. I figured I might as well be comfortable while I waited for what could have been certain doom.</p><p> </p><p>After a time, which I’m fairly sure was no more than two hours though I can’t be one hundred percent certain because I dozed off, the door opened again.</p><p> </p><p>I immediately sat up and went on alert, using my other senses to try and figure out who was with me. “Who are you and where the hell am I?”</p><p> </p><p>My question was once again answered with a chuckle as the door was shut. Unfortunately, I couldn’t tell who it was just based off that alone. I could however, tell that there was only one other person in the room because there was only one set of muffled footsteps on the carpet as they came nearer.</p><p> </p><p>There was an unfamiliar incantation spoken right in front of me. I felt nothing and assumed it must have had something to do with the room. I found out later how wrong I was.</p><p> </p><p>A hand pressed against my chest and forced me to lie down again. I felt a bit of a breeze above me right before my clothes disappeared.</p><p> </p><p>I yelped as I covered myself and tried to scramble away. Of course, I didn’t make it very far before a pair of strong hands grabbed me and held me in place.</p><p> </p><p>Both of my wrists were held in one hand while the other reached for something. When it came back, I felt course rope sliding over my wrists but it didn’t bind me. I knew it was a silent warning that if I didn’t behave, it would be used and it would be painful.</p><p> </p><p>I was still and quiet as I was maneuvered so that my head was resting on a pillow. The bed shifted with the weight of another body joining me on the bed and my legs were spread apart so the other could settle between them.</p><p> </p><p>A second later, a naked body was pressed against mine. A very <em>male</em>, naked body and my own body automatically responded in the form of a growing erection.</p><p> </p><p>When he started thrusting against me, I couldn’t help the breathy moan that escaped my throat. I felt my cheeks heat up in slight embarrassment but couldn’t bring myself to care once a hand wrapped around both of our arousals.</p><p> </p><p>As he continued to thrust and grind into me, my hands grasped the sheets below me to stop myself from holding onto my… torturer? Pleasurer? But that’s not even a word, no matter how accurate.</p><p> </p><p>My breathing sped up along with his as he moved faster and harder over me. I could feel the heat building in my lower stomach as I neared release. He felt how close I was as well and he backed away but kept his hand moving over my cock.</p><p> </p><p>I cried out and arched off the bed as my first orgasm from another’s touch washed over me, spots erupting in my vision behind the blindfold and my warm come splattering on my stomach and chest.</p><p> </p><p>My breathing was harsh as I came back down from the pleasure high and I <em>almost</em> wished I could see the man that caused it. At the same time, I was extremely glad that I couldn’t.</p><p> </p><p>Once I had calmed down, I felt two fingers drag through the cooling mess on my torso. My muscles quivered under the touch in both fear and excitement. Excitement because I knew we weren’t finished and fear… because I knew we weren’t finished.</p><p> </p><p>I was a virgin but so far, I hadn’t protested and I knew I wouldn’t. Deep down I felt ashamed that I hadn’t done anything to stop this from happening but at the same time, it was thrilling not knowing who was touching me.</p><p> </p><p>Without my sight, all my other senses were heightened. I could hear every breath he took and smell the sweat on his skin. Every touch was twice as powerful as normal and it was amazing.</p><p> </p><p>Finally, the man stopped drawing patterns in the come covering me and his fingers moved to the base of my balls. They trailed further down and I stiffened in anticipation and fear when he circled my entrance.</p><p> </p><p>With his free hand, he grabbed one of my ankles and bent my leg up to my chest. Then he did the same with the other. I wrapped my arms around my legs and spread them apart because I knew he’d like the view. Sure enough, I heard the hitch in his breath.</p><p> </p><p>My eyes squeezed shut and my hands clawed at my calves as a single digit forced its way into my body using my own fluids as lubrication. It stopped when it was buried fully and he gave me a few moments to get used to the intrusion before shoving a second finger in with it.</p><p> </p><p>After another pause, the two fingers began pumping in and out of me as they scissored to accommodate something much larger. Soon, a third finger was added and I couldn’t help the pained cry. He stopped again and I felt his free hand begin massaging my flaccid penis, slowly bringing it back to life. The joys of teenage recovery time.</p><p> </p><p>I hardly noticed when he continued stretching me again but I whined pitifully when the fingers withdrew and the hand let go of my renewed erection, leaving it to bounce against my stomach.</p><p> </p><p>The bed shifted as he moved and I was confused until I felt something tap against my lips. I turned my head toward it and opened my mouth. He thrust in but only so the head of his cock was in, leaving me to do the rest of the work of slicking it up.</p><p> </p><p>I had never done this before so I did what I imagined would feel good, swirling my tongue around the head and dipping slightly into the slit. When I moved further down it, a hand buried itself in my hair. I sighed in relief when he didn’t try to make me take more than I could handle.</p><p> </p><p>After several minutes, he growled and pulled me off of him. I could only guess that he was getting too close and wanted to enjoy what was still to come.</p><p> </p><p>When he was once again between my thighs, I felt him nudge my entrance before slowly sliding in. He moaned, the first sound of pleasure he had made all night… Morning? Afternoon? I had no idea what time of day it was.</p><p> </p><p>He pulled my legs to wrap around his waist and with only the smallest of pauses; he pulled out and pushed his way back in. I silently thanked anyone that might have been listening that he was going slowly, at least for now.</p><p> </p><p>It didn’t take long for him to hit that spot inside me that had me nearly screaming.</p><p> </p><p>I didn’t think after that, couldn’t think as I wrapped my arms around his back and held on for, what felt like, dear life. My nails dug into his shoulder blades and I swear I heard him groan from it. I couldn’t really be sure with all the sounds <em>I</em> was making at the time.</p><p> </p><p>As his thrusting sped up, I felt lips brush against mine before a tongue began plundering my mouth. I kissed him back like it was going out of freakin’ style. I just didn’t care anymore. It felt too good for me to care.</p><p> </p><p>That was when he pulled the blindfold off. But I kept my eyes closed. I didn’t want to see him and have this ruined for me. When I couldn’t see him, I could pretend that he was anybody I wanted.</p><p> </p><p>By the time I felt my climax nearing, he was pounding into me almost brutally and I was meeting him just as hard. He pulled his lips off of mine at last and I felt a hand grip my chin painfully.</p><p> </p><p>“Look at me.” He growled. I didn’t deny him. I opened my eyes to see piercing red ones staring back. The possessive gleam in them forced my orgasm on me.</p><p> </p><p>My hips lifted off the bed as I screamed my release and my come coated both of our torsos. I could feel his efforts to continue moving when I tightened around him but it did its job when he came inside me moments later.</p><p> </p><p>He collapsed on top of me but I paid it no mind. I was relaxed and sated; the added weight just seemed to solidify that feeling.</p><p> </p><p>Once we were both breathing normally, he got off me and off the bed. He slid into a silk bathrobe and left through an open door. He returned a moment later with a jar in hand.</p><p> </p><p>Besides that single command, he hadn’t spoken to me. I’m not sure why, but it unnerved me. He seated himself beside me and moved my legs back to my chest. I honestly thought he wanted to do it again, just with the proper lubrication, and I felt panic rise in my chest.</p><p> </p><p>Now that we were done and the pleasure had subsided, I realized how badly it hurt. I didn’t want to do that again without time to heal.</p><p> </p><p>He opened the jar and scooped some of the contents onto a single finger. When he brought it toward my abused entrance, I flinched away from him.</p><p> </p><p>I was confused by the small frown he gave me. “Not again.” I timidly explained. He chuckled lightly.</p><p> </p><p>“I promise this is just a simple healing salve.” He said. “I had expected you to resist and planned to take you dry when you did. But you didn’t, so I happily changed my plans and used what was available at the moment as lubrication. Now, legs up. I don’t want my consort in pain.”</p><p> </p><p>“Consort?” I squeaked as I brought my legs back up. “We… we’re not…”</p><p> </p><p>“Married? Of course not. I find marriage to be such a trivial thing and completely pointless, especially when you don’t know how long a thing will last.” Naturally, I thought that meant he planned on killing me. He elaborated when my eyes widened in fear. “Don’t worry.” He patted my head. “I plan on you being by my side for a long time to come. I have other methods of punishment if I feel you need it.” That didn’t do much to quell my fear.</p><p> </p><p>When he was done applying the salve, he closed the jar, set it on the bedside table and crawled back into bed, throwing off his robe as he did so. He grabbed the blanket, which was folded at the bottom of the bed, and covered us with it. Then he pulled me so my back was against his chest and held me. I had to admit it felt nice.</p><p> </p><p>I swallowed around a sudden lump in my throat. “V-Voldemort…” I started, not really knowing what I wanted to say.</p><p> </p><p>He growled in my ear and the arm around me tightened painfully. “Never call me that!” He spat before he loosened his grip and spoke softer. “That is a name to strike fear in the hearts of the masses, not for those close to me and especially not for the one in my bed. You are to refer to me as Voldemort or Sir when in public. In private or in the presence of a select few, you may call me whatever you wish.” He explained as he soothingly rubbed my stomach.</p><p> </p><p>“Tom?” I questioned weakly.</p><p> </p><p>“That is what the others call me.” He replied.</p><p> </p><p>“Tom. Who are the others?” I asked, having forgotten what I wanted in the first place.</p><p> </p><p>“Lucius, Severus, and a few others I’m sure you’ve never heard of. I’ll introduce you later.”</p><p> </p><p>“You mean Snape’s alive?” I turned my head and looked at him with wide, hopeful eyes. “But, I saw him die.”</p><p> </p><p>“No, you saw him go into a coma that is ninety-eight percent indistinguishable from death. It was a failsafe. I thought him a traitor; if I lost everyone would think he was dead, he would be buried alive, and I wouldn’t have to worry about my deepest secrets being revealed. If I won, I simply had to give him the antidote within forty-eight hours and then question him until I knew where his loyalties lie. That’s where I was before I came here. He passed.” Tom explained.</p><p> </p><p>“And by question you mean torture?” I asked with a raised brow.</p><p> </p><p>“Of course.” He replied nonchalantly. “You have no need to worry. I won’t make you watch or perform any kind of torture or killing unless I feel it is a fitting punishment for a transgression made on your part.”</p><p> </p><p>“How do I avoid such punishment?”</p><p> </p><p>“By obeying me.” He said simply. “And only me. By that, I mean if someone else gives you an order claiming to have come from me, don’t do it. If I want you to do something, I will tell you myself. If I want you some place, I’ll fetch you myself. Do you understand?”</p><p> </p><p>I nodded.</p><p> </p><p>“There is one scenario in which you are to obey another and that is if I happen to be away and I couldn’t take you with me. But if there ever is such an occurrence, I will tell you beforehand who will be receiving messages from me and who you are to listen to. Most likely, it will be either Severus or Lucius.” He continued. “Understand?”</p><p> </p><p>I nodded again and I opened my mouth to ask another question but he silenced me with a finger over my lips. “Enough questions. There will be plenty of time tomorrow. Now, sleep, Harry.”</p><p> </p><p>And sleep I did.</p>
