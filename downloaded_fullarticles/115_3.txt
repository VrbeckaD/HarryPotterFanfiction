    <p>The day of the blessed union between Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour had dawned at last. In the midst of war, in the midst of worry and strife, here was something beautiful, something wonderful, Hermione Granger mused to herself as she checked her reflection in the mirror. After sharing a room with Ginny and Fleur all week, Hermione was glad to have a few minutes to herself. The rings under her eyes had become more pronounced in the last few days, a tell-tale sign of the number of sleepless nights she had suffered of late. Though her pale and wan appearance could easily be attributed to the many late night wedding chats she had had with Ginny and Fleur of late, Hermione could not deny the truth of it to herself. She was worried. No matter what she told Harry and Ron, how organised and prepared she tried to be, she felt woefully inadequate in the face of what she knew was coming.</p><p> </p><p>            They all knew, she supposed. It was there in the brave face Ginny tried to put on for her brothers, for Harry even, though Hermione knew the two had split after Professor Dumbledore’s funeral and would be unlikely to rekindle their relationship for as long as Voldemort remained a threat. It was there in the forced jokes the twins continued to share in a feeble attempt to lighten the sombre mood, the feeling of doom as war closed in. It was there in the way Mrs Weasley snapped orders to all and sundry, her need for all to be perfect on this one day, perhaps the last day that she would have her family here together, like a mother hippogriff sheltering her fledglings from a coming storm. It was there in the weary slump of Mr Weasley’s shoulders as he returned home to the Burrow later and later each night, lines of care and sorrow appearing as clouds across his once cheerful face and chasing away his childlike curiosity. It was there in the grim set of Charlie’s mouth as he arrived at the Burrow a few days before the wedding, apparating to just outside the wards and bringing news of the Romanian Dragon Reserves under siege from suspected Death Eaters, eager to take control of the dragons and weaponize their power for You Know Who’s cause. It was there in the way Bill absently touched the scars on his face every time the Daily Prophet brought word of a new werewolf attack, a tremble in his fingers the only sign of his growing agitation as he paced his floor into the early hours of the morning like a caged zouwu. It was there in the way Fleur’s eyes followed Gabrielle’s every move, as though afraid this fairy child could be snatched away from her at any minute, her usual graceful composure a mask she wore to conceal her growing fear.</p><p> </p><p> It was there in Ron’s abrupt mood swings, the brief surges of anger an attempt to look the part of a fearless Gryffindor, rather than the frightened boy who clung to the protections of home and family for as much time as would be allowed. And most of all, it was there in Harry’s deadened expression, in the way he carried himself, his steps no longer carrying the lively spring of a boy, but the heavy, leaden step of a man, a man with the weight of fate itself burdening his young shoulders. The weight of the Boy Who  Lived, The Chosen One who would either be chosen to live or chosen to die by the same cruel hand of fate that had robbed him of his parents  at the tender age of one. Hermione watched them all with a heavy heart, for it was there in her mind too, she who had known since the first time she went through a trapdoor with Harry that all her magic, all her will, all her books and all her cleverness were not enough.</p><p> </p><p>But it would not do to dwell on darkness and forget to live, here, in the present moment, she reprimanded herself, unconsciously paraphrasing something Albus Dumbledore had once said to Harry. Steeling herself against the dread that occasionally overwhelmed her, Hermione reminded herself that  what would be, would be. Not that she truly believed in fate or destiny and all that nonsense, she just believed that Molly Weasley would never forgive her if she stole this moment of joy from Bill and Fleur. More importantly, Hermione would never forgive herself. A time of grief was surely coming, but it was not now. Now was a time of love, of song, celebration, of drinking and Merlin forbid, of <em>dancing. </em>Hermione grinned, remembering the last time she had danced, cocooned in the arms of a Bulgarian quidditch player. Though she could not understand the attraction of the sport for the life of her, she could not deny that quidditch players were undoubtedly fine. Her thoughts strayed to a certain Gryffindor quidditch player and she blushed, yes, quidditch players were very fine indeed.</p><p> </p><p>An hour later, Hermione made her way downstairs, satisfied that she looked presentable enough to pass even Molly Weasley’s eagle eyed inspection. Any flaw in her appearance would be immediately noted and Hermione would be sent back upstairs to put it right. But she passed Molly’s inspection without comment, merely a satisfied nod in her direction as she left the house and made her way to the gazebo where Harry and Ron were waiting for her. Though the ease with which Hermione passed Molly’s inspection may have been due to Monsieur Delacour’s bouncy presence, Mrs Weasley seeming to smile at every word the charming Frenchman uttered. Mademoiselle Delacour entered the room, garbed in a stunning sequined silver dress that glittered like polished diamonds as she greeted her husband, dropping kisses on each of his cheeks. Her daughter Gabrielle trailed behind her mother, the picture of angelic beauty in a simple gold dress, needing no ornament aside from the dazzling smile she flashed at “<em>Tante</em> Molly” as she had taken to calling her in her sweet childish way.     </p><p> “My dear Molly, you have been a wonderful hostess.” Monsieur Delacour said kindly.</p><p>“Oh it was nothing!” Molly said, waving away his compliment as though she hadn’t spent the last 4 nights sleeping on the living room floor after graciously giving up her and Arthur’s bed to the Delacour’s.</p><p>“No truly, I appreciate your kindness. Welcoming us all into your home like this. Really, it made everything so…much…easier.” The Frenchman said, his voice dropping to a purring murmur.  </p><p>Molly turned to look at him gratefully, it was so nice to be appreciated! “Why thank y—” She froze in confusion as all three Delacour’s drew their wands on her in unison, casting their spells simultaneously.</p><p>“<em>Silencio!”</em></p><p>
  <em>“Incarcerous!”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Petrificus Totallus!” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Caught unawares, Molly Weasley fell where she stood, silenced, bound and immobilised by her house guests.</p><p>“Come, we must hurry.” Mademoiselle Delacour said, casting a disillusionment charm on Molly’s still form and sweeping from the room, her companions in tow. The Dark Lord would not be kept waiting for his prize…</p>
