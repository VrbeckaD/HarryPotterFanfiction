    <p>The resounding slam to the Three Broomsticks entrance, drew the attention of all it's occupants. Severus snape glanced around looking for someone, unaware of ogling eyes. To all who remebered him, he was as he'd always been; pale and slender but different, less sallow and gaunt. In forest green robes and long willowy legs, he was fine looker. </p><p>His eyes stopped on a table of children and what seemed to be their parents. A wide smile graced his face as he stode towards them, recognizing someone.</p><p>"Draco, my boy. You've worried your parents to death." His voice was smoother than in his youth.</p><p>"Oh, my! Draco darling, who are your friends" Regardless of his scanning eyes, he finally looked at the people before him, and only just realizing his company, he became confused. The young blond turned to his friends to introduce them.</p><p>"This is Hermione, Ron and Harry, We're in Slyther-"</p><p>"Pleasure to meet you" <span class="pwa pwa1">He interrupted</span>, sweeping his <span class="pwa pwa2">eyes</span> over the <span class="pwa pwa1">children</span> before <span class="pwa pwa3">smiling</span> at the <span class="pwa pwa4">adults</span> seated.</p><p>"And these must be the fathers?"</p><p>"<span class="pwa pwa3">Well</span>, only ones of us, my nam-"</p><p>"<span class="pwa pwa1">Oh</span> no, <span class="pwa pwa2">I <span class="pwa pwa4">don't</span></span> <span class="pwa pwa5">care</span>. As I was saying <span class="pwa pwa3">Draco</span>, your parents are worried" <span class="pwa pwa1">He interrupted</span> again, <span class="pwa pwa6">and turned</span> on his heels to stride <span class="pwa pwa7">away</span>. The young <span class="pwa pwa5">blond boy</span> winced as he <span class="pwa pwa6"><span class="pwa pwa7">looked</span></span><span class="pwa pwa6"> up</span> to the <span class="pwa pwa2">men</span> surrounding.</p><p>"<span class="pwa pwa6">Sorry</span>, <span class="pwa pwa4"><span class="pwa pwa4">Mr</span></span><span class="pwa pwa4">. <span class="pwa pwa6">Potter</span></span>, <span class="pwa pwa4">Mr</span>. Lupin and Cousin <span class="pwa pwa2">Sirius</span>. <span class="pwa pwa1">He's</span> flighty with natural human communication," The three <span class="pwa pwa2">men</span> laughed glumly.</p><p>"<span class="pwa pwa3">Things</span> <span class="pwa pwa4">don't</span> change" <span class="pwa pwa2">Sirius</span> <span class="pwa pwa4">smiled</span> wanly and <span class="pwa pwa7">looked</span> between his two <span class="pwa pwa6">friends</span>.</p><p>" Could be the company you're keeping, though, kid." </p><p> "<span class="pwa pwa1">I'm</span> <span class="pwa pwa6">sorry</span>, do you know him?"</p><p>"Yeah <span class="pwa pwa3">well</span>, we went to Hogwarts with him. <span class="pwa pwa5">First</span> <span class="pwa pwa7">right</span> through to the <span class="pwa pwa6">fourth</span>," </p><p>"<span class="pwa pwa5">What do you mean</span>? Only <span class="pwa pwa1"><span class="pwa pwa6">fourth</span></span><span class="pwa pwa1"> <span class="pwa pwa2">year</span></span>?" Confusion clouded <span class="pwa pwa3">Draco</span> as he  <span class="pwa pwa7">turned to</span> them.</p><p>"<span class="pwa pwa3">Well</span>, sometime around <span class="pwa pwa1"><span class="pwa pwa6">fourth</span></span><span class="pwa pwa1"> <span class="pwa pwa2">year</span></span>, he disappeared," <span class="pwa pwa7">Remus</span> <span class="pwa pwa7">looked</span> down at his coffee.</p><p>"Somehow, we might be <span class="pwa pwa3">to blame</span>. We were rather horrible to him."</p><p>"We were childish to him" Unwelcome memories flashed through <span class="pwa pwa6">James</span>' <span class="pwa pwa2">eyes</span>. Harry <span class="pwa pwa7"><span class="pwa pwa6"><span class="pwa pwa7">looked</span></span></span><span class="pwa pwa7"><span class="pwa pwa6"> up</span></span><span class="pwa pwa7"> at</span> his father for the <span class="pwa pwa5">first</span> time wordlessly and Hermione, familiar to bullies herself, pursed her lips <span class="pwa pwa6">and Turned</span> <span class="pwa pwa7">away</span>.</p><p>"<span class="pwa pwa4">Don't</span> be <span class="pwa pwa1">like</span> that," Uttered Ron.</p><p>"So many <span class="pwa pwa2">years</span> since then. They were <span class="pwa pwa1">children</span> who did silly <span class="pwa pwa3">things</span>. We all make mistakes and <span class="pwa pwa2"><span class="pwa pwa1">I'm</span></span><span class="pwa pwa2"> sure</span> godfather could forgive you. Your <span class="pwa pwa4">adults</span> <span class="pwa pwa5">now</span>. <span class="pwa pwa7">Right</span> <span class="pwa pwa4"><span class="pwa pwa4">Mr</span></span><span class="pwa pwa4">. <span class="pwa pwa6">Potter</span></span>?" <span class="pwa pwa3">Draco</span> <span class="pwa pwa4">smiled</span> at his <span class="pwa pwa6">friends</span> and their family. <span class="pwa pwa3"><span class="pwa pwa2">Sirius</span></span><span class="pwa pwa3"> turned</span> a feeble smile on the <span class="pwa pwa5">blond boy</span> as <span class="pwa pwa7">Remus</span> replied, doubt coating his voice.</p><p>"<span class="pwa pwa2"><span class="pwa pwa1">I'm</span></span><span class="pwa pwa2"> sure</span> he would,"</p><p>....</p><p>
  <em>"This is all your fault <span class="pwa pwa6">Potter</span>, You stupid dickhead!" <span class="pwa pwa6">James</span> <span class="pwa pwa7">turned to</span> <span class="pwa pwa4">Lily</span> Evans, <span class="pwa pwa3">smiling</span>.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"<span class="pwa pwa1">Oh</span>, and just what have I <span class="pwa pwa7">done</span> <span class="pwa pwa5">now</span>? hmm, Lilypad?" Her <span class="pwa pwa2">eyes</span> were cold and calculating, <span class="pwa pwa3">red</span> rimmed and tear stained.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"THEN. BRING. SEVERUS. <span class="pwa pwa5">BACK</span>." She snarled lowly. Every <span class="pwa pwa5">one</span> in the Gryffindor common room stilled and ogled the unfurling scene. <span class="pwa pwa3"><span class="pwa pwa2">Sirius</span></span><span class="pwa pwa3"> turned</span> and glared, but no <span class="pwa pwa5">one</span> seemed to <span class="pwa pwa5">care</span>.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Uh <span class="pwa pwa1">oh</span>, <span class="pwa pwa6">Potter</span>, what did you do <span class="pwa pwa5">now</span>?" <span class="pwa pwa5">One</span> of the seventh <span class="pwa pwa2">years</span> crooned, his excitement palpitating.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"I have <span class="pwa pwa7">done</span> nothing" He paused for a moment to think.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"At least <span class="pwa pwa2">I <span class="pwa pwa4">don't</span></span> remember doing anything. <span class="pwa pwa4">Lily</span>, <span class="pwa pwa5">What do you mean</span>?" <span class="pwa pwa7">Remus</span> who was reading, put his book down and moved closer.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"<span class="pwa pwa2"><span class="pwa pwa1">I'm</span></span><span class="pwa pwa2"> sure</span> he'll come <span class="pwa pwa5">back</span>, the new school <span class="pwa pwa2">year</span> starts soon. He very <span class="pwa pwa3">well</span> won't tarnish his perfect grades or attendance."</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"<span class="pwa pwa1">He's</span> <span class="pwa pwa7">right</span>, the greasy git won-"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Shut up. Black" She hissed, her face <span class="pwa pwa3">red</span> and fiery <span class="pwa pwa1">like</span> flowing locks. Realizing the audience, <span class="pwa pwa4">she turned</span> at left for the hallway, hoping on hope the boys would follow. When <span class="pwa pwa4">she turned</span>, the 'marauders' were waiting for her to speak. For the life of her, <span class="pwa pwa5">she couldn't</span> utter a single word. Anguish and regret painted her heart as she finaly <span class="pwa pwa7"><span class="pwa pwa6"><span class="pwa pwa7">looked</span></span></span><span class="pwa pwa7"><span class="pwa pwa6"> up</span></span><span class="pwa pwa7"> at</span> them. She knew they weren't wholly <span class="pwa pwa3">to blame</span>, but it hurt too much to consider her own part in it. She couldn't help being mad at him, he'd called her a bloody mudblood, for goodness sakes, Even if she was close to forgiving him. It didn't matter now, he was gone.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"He isn't coming back. Bad grades or otherwise." Her voice was crackling, even to her own ears. Before anyone could ask, she pulled a folded parchment from her pocket and threw it at them.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"He isn't coming back. It's all your fault." Remus took the paper as Lily turned and ran off, trying to contain her tears.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Alright then Moony, don't just stand there. What does it say?"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Not in the corridor, too many prying eyes and ears." He glared at the nosy portraits, the Fat Lady not one of them. Once safely inside, he opened the parchment and began to read aloud.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>....</em>
</p><p>Sirius inhaled deeply through his nose; Whether he wanted forgiveness, regardless if he gave them forgiveness, He knew they wouldn't deserve it. They all knew it and that was why Peter had changed. Why they all had, it was something they could not forget.</p><p> </p><p> </p>
