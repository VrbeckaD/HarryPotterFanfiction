  <em> <strong>Prongs</strong> </em>
</p><p>Lily Evans sat down at a table in a coffee shop in Camden Town. She wore muggle clothes and her wand was carefully hidden in her muggle bag. She even put on lipstick, and, truth be told, that worried her more than a little.</p><p>When dickhead Potter asked her to show him some muggle place she knew, only the two of them, he felt her utterly shocked. That was far from his usual annoying tease and sounded quite genuine, for once. She thought about refusing, of course, then she realised two things:</p><p><em>One</em>, she really liked the idea, somehow. Potter that last year had grown more mature and well tempered, almost kind, and she hated herself for that but she couldn’t say she didn’t find him obnoxiously attractive.</p><p><em>Two</em>, Severus hated him with all his heart and he deserved this. He deserved this after what he said to her the last time they talked.</p><p>Severus would have hated it if he knew, and she was sure Potter was going to tell everybody they met during the summer, once the school would have started again. </p><p>Plus, Severus would never ask her to meet in muggle London. This was important. This ment James didn’t care.</p><p><em>“You filthy mudblood, huh? Let’s see who’s going to be filthy this time around”</em> she thought bitterly, biting her lip.</p><p>Potter wasn’t so bad, after all. Her fellow prefect, Remus Lupin, was kind and caring and smart and he hanged out with him all the time. He wouldn’t if James really was that bad. </p><p>And when Potter saved Severus from “I can’t tell you what happened”? That was totally a smart move.</p><p>And the Quidditch matches were so worth watching when he was playing. He was endearing on a broomstick.</p><p>“Enough, Lily. Quit overthinking this. Potter’s an idiot and you’re doing this to unplease Severus, that’s all”</p><p>As soon as she heard the door bells ring she hesitantly looked up. She feared he had just shown up in wizard robes, Gryffindor scarf and wand in sight. Why did she agree to meet him there? It was stupid.</p><p>
  <em>“Because it was so kind of him. He accepts this part of you, unlike-”</em>
</p><p>Her eyes finally met his and she noticed with relief she was only half right. She couldn’t stop herself from smiling.</p><p>He was wearing his Gryffindor scarf indeed, but it looked like a common red and golden scarf, with the jeans and muggle shirt he was wearing with it.</p><p><em>“It seems he really put an effort to that, after all”</em> she thought.</p><p>“Potter” she said instead, trying to sound cold or at least nonchalant, and failing miserably.</p><p>“Evans”</p><p>His hair were messy as always, but his smile was so different from the one she was used to. He looked shy.</p><p>She looked at him, magnetic green eyes fixed on the boy.</p><p>“So… you’re doing research for muggle class, right?”</p><p>“Uhm, yeah”</p><p>“During summer”</p><p>He shrugged and flushed slightly. She immediately aknowledged she wanted him to do that more often. </p><p>“And you want me to help you”</p><p>“Well, who better than you, right?”</p><p>Embarrassing silence weighed between them when the waitress approached them.</p><p>“Good morning sir, miss” she smiled politely. “I'm here to take your order”</p><p>“Double tall latte, thank you. Lots of sugar” Lily replied, smiling back at the woman. She nodded.</p><p>“What about you, boy?”</p><p>James widened his eyes, and for a moment he didn’t know what to say. He had been so nervous all day he didn’t even think about what he should have to drink. He didn’t know muggle food in the slightest.</p><p>“Err… what she said. But no sugar I guess?”<br/>The waitress looked at him in confusion, but silently nodded and wento back to the counter.</p><p>Lily couldn’t help but snort. James felt his heart sink in his chest.</p><p>“Not bad for it to be your first time, Potter! Next time I’ll let you actually choose from the menu!”</p><p>“Next- oh, yeah! Of course! Next time! Totally!”</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> <strong>Moony</strong> </em>
</p><p>Remus Lupin was sitting down on the ground in the countryside next to his home. His back was leaning on a three, and his fingers were gently stroking the blades of grass.</p><p>It had been a couple of days since the last full moon, and he liked sitting down enjoying the cool breeze in the morning, focusing on his breaths and trying to ignore the pain that still haunted his body, his fresh scars bright red under the sun. His eyes were closed and he sighed, feeling a sudden ache in his chest as he did so.</p><p>It was always bad in summer, his furry little problem. His father was getting older, and he didn’t have Wormtail, Prongs and Padfoot to keep him company and look after him not to let him hurt himself or anyone else. </p><p>When he heard a loud <em>crac</em>, his eyes snapped open.</p><p>An house elf was in front of him, in the middle of the field, and he was smiling forcedly at him. He looked tired, and not very kind, as he slowly walked towards him and his smile didn’t reach his eyes.</p><p>“Excuse me?” he asked, slowly standing up, leaning to the tree and trying to hold back a whine.</p><p>“<em>Excuse me</em>? Ha! This one was good” he elf croaked, his big eyes shining.</p><p>“May I know who I'm-?” the boy reached his wand with his hand discreetly.</p><p>“My name’s Kreacher, sir. I serve the Black family. Master Sirius sent me at your place, he says it’s an emergency. An intimate matter”</p><p>“S-sirius? Emergency? Intimate?” Remus asked, worry started to raise in his chest. He never visited the Black manor, he knew Sirius' parents would never let him step inside. If Sirius was asking him to come like this it had to be important. </p><p>He looked hesitantly at the elf. Sirius talked about him a lot, and everything he said wasn’t exactly flattering, to use an euphemism.</p><p>“If you could just grab my arm, sir…” Kreacher said, his voice was dry.</p><p>Remus tensed and put his wand back in his pocket.</p><p>“Oh, right, yes! Of course, yes!”</p><p>He  stepped closer and in the exact moment his hand brushed with the elf’s arm, his face shifted in a disgusted grimace and the boy heard the <em>crac</em> again.</p><p>Everything was dark. Darker then he thought it would be. And he was on the floor.</p><p>“Where…? Pads?” he heard nothing but silence. “Sirius?” </p><p>Suddenly, his eyes adjusting to the darkness, he started to see a blurred shadow in front of him. He soon noticed it couldn’t be his friend. It was bigger and it looked like a woman, if his eyes didn’t betray him. He tried to grab his wand, but the shadow was quicker.</p><p>“Accio” a woman’s voice said, flatly, and he felt, more than saw, his wand slipping away and fading in the darkness.</p><p>“What’s happening?” he asked, his voice weak, terrified. He was wandless and injured due to the full moon. Useless.</p><p>“Time to make this… thing know its place, right Kreacher?”</p><p>The small chuckle that came in response sent chill to Remus' spine. He thought about standing up but something in him told him it wasn’t a good idea.</p><p>“The collar, Kreacher” the voice ordered.<br/>Something cold and metallic touched his neck and he yelped in surprise and fear. He realised in horror an iron collar was now chained to his neck.</p><p>“Who are you? What do you want from me?” Remus asked, he didn’t dare to fight, knowing full well he was disarmed and he didn’t have a chance.</p><p>The blurry shadow in front of him moved, and the instant later the sun light filled the room, curtains being opened. He blinked a few times to let his eyes get used to it, and his eyes widened in shock.</p><p>The walls were all black, even if he could hardly tell because the wall was covered in motorbike muggle posters. Black was the huge wardrobe next to the window, and black were the sheets on the queen sized canopy bed his collar was chained to. </p><p>The Gryffindor emblem was hanging on the bed, probably fixed with a permanent sticking charm, and on the wardrobe there was a big cage he knew it belonged to Liquorice, the owl of the Black family.</p><p>Sirius' Room.</p><p>Kreacher was standing in front of him, smiling more earnestly than before. Remus hates it. Behind him, a woman. She was big, well dressed, her head covered in long dark curls. He didn’t have to ask who she was anymore. Her silver eyes told him she was Walburga Black. </p><p>“Well, well, well. Remus John Lupin, am I right?”</p><p>The boy gulped.</p><p>“I asked you a question” Walburga said, coldly.</p><p>“Yes”</p><p>The woman stepped closer, a smile on her lips. “I don’t want your filthy hands anywhere near my son ever again. My family is nothing like your kind. If I ever happen to know you’re hanging out with him again I'm coming back for you. I assure you, nobody will miss you once I’ll be finished with you. Freaks like you shouldn’t even attend the same school as normal people. You don’t even need it anyway. Who would even hire someone like you?”</p><p>“I don't know what you’re talking about” Remus whispered, hoping it wasn’t what he was thinking. It couldn’t be.</p><p>“You know very well what I’m talking about, you hybrid”</p><p>That shut him up. He froze, holding his breath. </p><p>She knew. Sirius told her. She knew. After what happened with Snape he looked so wrecked, so genuinely guilty and hurting that Remus could have sweared he wouldn’t have revealed his secret again. But he was wrong. And it destroyed him.</p><p>Because, after all the boy did to him, he still was his best friend. And, most importantly, Remus still was helplessly in love with him.</p><p>He desperately tried to stand up, he didn’t know what he was going to do, but the fact that Sirius had betrayed him again made him go crazy. He soon discovered he couldn’t. He had to do something, he didn’t care about the wand. The collar on his neck forced him on the floor, the short chain fixed to one of the bed's legs. He wondered how to release himself.</p><p>“Where’s my… where’s my wand?” </p><p>“I have it, and I intend to keep it. They should be off limits for the ones of your kind. You’re dangerous”</p><p>“I’m sure… I’m sure we can find a solution togheter. There’s no need to-”</p><p>“Listen, freak. You’re not going to talk your way past this. I’m going to teach you a lesson. A lesson you won’t forget. And if you even try to think to tell anyone about this, just know it’s your words against mine, and nobody would believe at the words of an hybrid like you”</p><p>“What are you-”</p><p>“I hope you’ll learn a lot today. And if you’ll behave next year and stay away from my son, I’ll never hurt you again. This can be a one time thing, if you’re smart enough”</p><p>She raised her wand, smiling wider. Remus felt like he was going to die.</p><p>“Crucio”</p><p>Pain suddenly overwhelmed him all at once. For a moment it numbed him, his mind going blank, then it was like every cell in his body screamed in unison. </p><p>He let out a strangled yelp, used to the pain – he was, after all, a werewolf and had to deal with it once a month – managing not to scream.</p><p>She frowned. “I’ll make you cry and beg, I promise. Crucio”</p><p>The pain increased and he whined loudly, his eyes starting to tear up.</p><p>“That’s better” she hummed in content as she looked at the agonizing boy in front of her.</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong> <em>Padfoot</em> </strong>
</p><p>Sirius Black just stepped back home after a ride on his flying motorbike. He took off the helmet in a sigh. At least the ride succeeded in making him feel better.</p><p>“Crucio” he heard from upstairs, followed by a muffled scream. He bit his lips in frustration. His parents loved to torture the house elves and he hated that, even if he knew he couldn’t stop them. To try would result in him being tortured with them and nothing else.</p><p>“I have to get out of this hellhole as soon as possible” he thought, clenching his fists. </p><p>He started to think about moving away the summer between his fourth and fifth year at Hogwarts, and he didn’t do that yet only because he was afraid he would be a burden for the Potters – of course he would go to the Potters, always the Potters – but now he really was reaching a breaking point.</p><p>He got in the great living room and threw the helmet in one of the sofas. Regulus, his brother, was reading an old book on the couch. As soon as he saw him, he smirked and yelled “Mooom! He’s back!”</p><p>“What the fuck is your problem, Reg?” Sirius asked. </p><p>The other shrugged. “She told me to call her as soon as you came home. She’s not in a good mood today”</p><p>“Yeah, I got it from the crucio it just came from upstairs, man” he hissed.</p><p>“Sirius!” his mother’s voice came from somewhere on the second floor. “Sirius!”</p><p>“What now?!” he groaned, visibly annoyed.<br/>He heard heavy footsteps coming down the stairs. The door slammed open once again and Walburga looked at him with a frown.</p><p>“We have to talk. Now”</p><p>“We are already talking, mother” he replied coldly.</p><p>“When exactly did I teach you to hang out with hybrids, Sirius?”</p><p>Sirius froze for a moment. It couldn’t be what he was thinking. They couldn’t have figured it out.</p><p>“H-hybrids?” he asked, his voice suddenly lower and hesitant.</p><p>“Don’t you dare look at me like that. I know what your friend, that Lupin, what he is. I know he’s a werewolf”</p><p>“What are you-? How-? He's not-” he croaked, his breath fastening and his heart running in his chest.</p><p>“You should hide your stuff better next time, brother” he heard Regulus say, throwing his leather diary at him. His heart skipped a beat.</p><p>“You, fucking, disgusting, horrid little bastard, I’ll fucking kill you this time!” he yelled, taking his wand and raising it towards his brother. </p><p>Regulus mirrored the gesture with a smirk. He was one year younger than him and still underage, but he knew his mother would successfully cover him if something happened and he had to use magic in the house.</p><p>“It doesn’t matter how, or who, or when. I know, and that’s enough. And it has to stop”</p><p>“You can’t force my away from my friends” Sirius hissed, stepping back and turning to face his mother. Regulus was certainly less than a threat compared to her.</p><p>“You really think so?” the woman cheered.</p><p>“I am certain of that, actually” he said, and he felt a wave of hatred and disgust overwhelm him all at once. </p><p>He always managed to bear his mother’s presence before. He learned how to pretend he doesn’t hear the unforgivable curses muttered behind the walls. He learned how to suppress a swear when his father says something ridiculously offensive against muggleborns. He learned how to turn his head when his mother has her bursts of rage and destroys everything that comes to her sight. But this… he couldn’t forgive this.</p><p>He knew how much his friend has suffered, he knew how he will keep to, how he could not escape his condition even if he wanted to – and Merlin knows how much he wanted to – and the bare thought that his parents of all people wanted him to suffer more made something in him snap.</p><p>“You are <em>certain, actually</em>. Well, you should go see your bedroom, then. You’d be surprised” she said, shrugging her shoulders and sighing in content. </p><p>Sirius watched her as she took a wand in her hand and looked at it with a satisfied grin. Everything in Sirius burned. It wasn’t her wand. He could recognise it everywhere. It was…</p><p>“How did you have it?” he yelled.</p><p>The woman didn’t reply.</p><p>“Mom, how did you have it?” </p><p>
  <em>“She’s not in a good mood today”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Yeah, I got it from the crucio it just came from upstairs, man”</em>
</p><p>He desperately sucked a breath. Suddenly his knees were weak. The room started spinning around him.</p><p>“She’s joking. She's joking. It can’t be. She’s joking, it can’t be, it can’t be” </p><p>He wasn’t even aware of the fact he was racing up the stairs like his life depended on it until he heard Regulus yell “Say hi to him for me, brother!” from afar.</p><p>
  <em>“Merlin, please, let it all be a joke, please, it can’t be him, please”</em>
</p><p>He opened the door in a rush and what he saw nearly made him pass out on the spot. “No. No, no, no, no”</p><p>His friend was laying on the floor, chained to the bed, a collar thight around his neck. He was lightly whining, eyes closed, shaking probably because of the pain. His forehead was bleeding profusely, ugly cuts on his skin that formed the word <em>BEAST</em>.</p><p>He struggled to suppress a sob, closing the door behind him and locking it with magic. <br/>Hearing the sudden noise, Remus opened one eye, seemingly self conscious. He opened his mouth to say something, but it came out as a raspy sound.</p><p>Sirius immediately knelt next to him, staring in horror. “Don’t talk, it’s okay, it’s- fuck, it’s going to be okay. I’m so sorry, Merlin, I’m so sorry Moony…” he whispered, as he tried to hold his wand to unlock the collar on his neck.</p><p>“Alohomora” he muttered, finally managing to free his friend. </p><p>“Sirius…” the boy moaned, squeezing his eyes and trying to focus on staying awake.</p><p>Sirius brushed his fingers on his cheek, feeling his eyes already wet. Remus flinched at the touch.</p><p>“Don’t you… fucking… touch me” he croaked, and Sirius snapped his hand back like something burned him.</p><p>“How could you tell her? How could you tell her? I got over Snape, I really did, but your mother? What the fuck Sirius, do you hate me that much?” he finally found himself capable to say, everything still aching like hell.</p><p>The other boy shook his head furiously. </p><p>“I didn’t! I didn’t tell them Moony, I swear! I would never do it! Please, believe me, I swear! You know I could never do something like that!” he pleaded, tears starting to cross his cheeks. Sirius aknowledged in that moment that he never felt so miserable.<br/>Remus looked at him in the eyes. He looked hurt, in more than a way, and that made Sirius' heart ache like it never ached before. He let out a sob.</p><p>“It’s not my fault. It's not my fault. I swear!” <br/>Remus frowned for a moment, then sighed. He looked he was having an internal fight Sirius didn’t know anything about.</p><p>“Okay” he croaked.</p><p>“O- okay?”</p><p>“Okay. I trust you” </p><p>The boy blinked, trying to figure out what he just heard. “Do you believe me?”</p><p>“Yes. I do” </p><p>Silence passed between them. Tears still down his cheeks, Sirius took all his courage and touched him hesitantly again. This time, Remus didn’t reject him, but he bit his lips not to whine in pain at the touch. Sirius gulped.</p><p>“I’m going to try to put you in my bed now, okay?”</p><p>“Sirius, Padfoot, wait, it’s not a-OUCH!” </p><p>“Shit, sorry, okay, it can’t work” he cursed, looking at him with his chest on fire. </p><p>“Pads it hurts… fuck, it hurts so bad…” Remus whined softly, closing his eyes, trying to forget the pain. </p><p>Suddenly all the fear, the worry, the guilt he had bottled up in his body turned into rage. The boy wiped his tears off with his sleeve and growled “I’m going to fucking kill her”</p>
