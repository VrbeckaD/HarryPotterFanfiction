    <p>Graves groaned, waking up. One moment he was just casually strolling outside the Woolworth building, about to disapparate to his apartment, the next he was, well, here. Of course, he didn’t really know where ‘here’ was, per say. Given the darkness and the feeling of heavy bricks under him, he would say that he was… in jail? Psh, he was, like, 25% sure that he hadn’t done anything recently to warrant an arrest.</p><p>His mind quickly buzzed for ways to get out. He tried a bit of wandlless magic, but was rewarded with a burning sensation by his wrists. He might have guessed that it wouldn’t be that easy to get out of this mess. Suddenly, the lights flickered on. He called out but was not rewarded with a reply. Either everyone in this… block? Was asleep or he was alone in here. He sighed, setting his head down. He couldn’t tell the time, but assuming it hadn’t been too long since he’d been knocked unconscious, this would be around about the time that he was supposed to go to sleep.</p><p>.</p><p>The next time he woke up he heard some voices. Alright then, he guessed the last time he’d called out everyone in the vicinity had- probably- been asleep.</p><p>“Hello?” he called out.</p><p>“Yeah?” two or three men called back.</p><p>“Um, can someone please tell me where I am?”</p><p>“You’re in Nurmengard, pal.”</p><p>Dread set in him. “I-I’m, uh, I’m where?”</p><p>“Nurmengard. Gell-o’s prison.”</p><p>“Gell-o?”</p><p>“Yeah, you know. Grindelwald.”</p><p>Right, he’d heard stories about this place. It was rumored to be somewhere in Germany near Nuremburg. </p><p>“How long was I out?”</p><p>“How would we know that?”</p><p>“How long’ve you guys been here?”</p><p>The replies that followed ranged anywhere between 4 years ago and last Tuesday.</p><p>A door along the end of the hallway opened. He heard footsteps approaching, footsteps that stopped right outside of his cell.</p><p>A man wearing brown-grey pants, a white shirt, a golden vest and a black bowtie stood just beyond the bars. He had light brown-gold hair with just the slightest tinge of red. He was young and incredibly handsome, and had this been any other type of scenario, Graves likely would have asked him out to coffee sometime.</p><p>But at the moment, it was clear that he was one of the people in charge of keeping him captive.</p><p>“Hello, Mr. Graves,” the man smiled, in a sort of smug-y-sinister-y kind of way.</p>
