  <span>12:57pm.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Shit.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Shitshitshitshit.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Ok, I’m good.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rosa Dawn was running around her room getting ready. Her makeup was hastily done but pretty, her bad hair day was concealed by a quick elegant bun on the top of her head. She grabbed the grey dress her mother had picked out for her on her run in Diagon Alley. How she managed to find such beautiful dresses constantly, Rosa did not know. The dress was tea length, stopping at her ankle. It had a modest v-neckline, and lacy long sleeves. It wrapped her waist and frilled into a beautiful layered skirt. She zipped it up in no time; a perfect fit.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She rushed down, hearing her mother’s shouts from the living room. She was running late. A quick tempus gave her the exact time; 12:59. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Shit. </span>
  </em>
  <span>She ran, in her high heels, to the living room, where her mother, Madilyn Dawn, was sitting in a beautiful armchair, facing the fireplace. She had her cane elegantly between her fingers. Waiting. She was wearing one of her own dresses, one of the ones from her past. One of the ones that she didn’t wear often. Rosa stood next to her, staring into the fireplace.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wearing the dress?” her mother questioned quickly, not moving to look her daughter up and down like her regular habit was.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah” she answered matching her haste.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Posture?” Rosa corrected hers instantly.</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Straight as a pole”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Manners?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Couldn’t care less for them” Rosa commented under her breath.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Just wear your mask for 15 minutes, Rosa.”</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I won’t disappoint, mother”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>After a moment, the fireplace roared in green flames, and three people stepped into the medium sized living room. Rosa bowed her head in greeting, keeping her mouth shut. No matter how much she hated the custom, she let the men speak up first.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mrs. Dawn. Miss Dawn” the man greeted. Rosa’s mother raised her hand waiting for the man to grab it, which he did. He kissed the back of her hand slightly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lord Crabbe at your service. May I present to you my wife, Lady Crabbe and my son Vincent” the old man introduced the rest of the two. The whole family looked very pompous and rich, dressed in probably their 5th best robes. Their attire still was much more beautiful than Rosa could ever dream of. Her gorgeous dress was no competition against Mrs. Crabbe’s bloodred robes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lovely to meet you finally, Vincent. Clarisse, as always it’s lovely to see you. Please, do sit down” Rosa’s mother said with a sweet voice only Rosa knew to be fake.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rosa poured everyone a cup of tea, asking for everyone’s preferences. (Mr. Crabbe liked his tea plain, Lady Crabbe enjoyed a dash of cream and Vincent wished for two cubes of sugar together with cream) The Crabbe family sat down around the coffee table, the oldest man sitting on a similar armchair as Mrs. Dawn, whilst Lady and Vincent shared the sofa with Rosa. Vincent as feeling uncomfortable with the lack of space, sandwitched between the two women. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rosa knew to stay silent through the conversation, she was here out of courtesy; ‘do not open that mouth of yours’ her mother had said to her weeks ago. ‘These are the most important conversations of your life’ she liked to remind her every other day after that.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Has she been reserved?” Lord Crabbe started the interrogation.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, not yet” Mrs. Dawn answered quickly after swallowing her sip of tea. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is there any offers?” the man asked, looking for straight answers, which he didn’t feel that the witch was giving him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’re waiting for a few.”</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That is a no, then” To Rosa’s surprise, the man turned to her. He looked at her dead in the eye. This was unusual, her eyebrows rose in intrigue. Her mother frowned uglily.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Blood?” he questioned. Speed round then. Rosa smirked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Dirty, sir”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Children?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Pure, sir”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“House?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Gryffindor, sir”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mudbloods?” Rosa took a breath, making up her mind.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Muggleborns</span>
  </em>
  <span>, sir.” she corrected him. He glanced at her mother, who was clearly not liking Rosa’s answer. She didn’t care of her opinion. She would always fight against the predatory prejudice her family was plagued with. She felt a fit of anger in the pit of her stomach which she desperately tried to ignore.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Career?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“An Auror” she lied and subsequently dropped her manners.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Friends?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Plenty” Lie.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Subject?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Defence” Lie again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Grades?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Exceed Expectations” another lie.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s not good enough for an auror”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Watch me”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Rosa!” her mother scolded. Lord Crabbe smirked in return.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fortune?”</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“More than enough” Rosa said vaguely.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Specifically?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Two fifty.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Woah” came the comment from Vincent’s mouth. His mother nudged him in the ribs lightly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’ll reserve her” Defeat.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What?!” Rosa exclaimed. This was not the outcome she had expected nor wanted.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, shut it, child.” the man said. Rosa’s mother shifted in her seat, suddenly extremely interested in what the man had to say.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I see she’s exceedingly fantastic at lying. To the Nott’s she’s a future Healer, with only O’s. To the Malfoy’s she’ll become an Unspeakable with barely passing grades. I believe the Zabini’s got the impression that you are a Hufflepuff. You rebel. You have a brain. No matter how disgusting I find you and your blood Miss Dawn, since the children will be pure I think you’re a perfect fit. Unless we find something better of course”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You are proposing only a reservation?” Rosa’s mother butted into the conversation, the faked sweetness of her voice was now suddenly. Must’ve forgot it in her excitement.</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“For now.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We agree.” Rosa had never seen a more amazing smile gracing her mother’s face.</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“Perfect. Congratulations, Miss Dawn”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>+++</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You sold me” Rosa said after the last green flame had left the fireplace signaling the departure of the Crabbe family.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’s the best you can do. Do you think someone like Nott would go for you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m just having some fun whilst they’re wasting their time here… Dad could find a better half blood” She let the comment out and instantly regretted her lack of filter. Clearly her mask came down crashing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Come here, Rosa” her mother demanded, tone suddenly angry.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rosa knelt next to her mother’s armchair, her face slightly lower than her mothers. The woman looked at her, eyes filled with disgust. She brought her hand back above her own head and then brought her open palm back to Rosa’s cheek with force. Rosa bit her teeth together not to make a sound of pain. A red splot was slowly but confidently forming on her cheek.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Your mask is slipping, Rosa. Learn your place. You might disgust me and them, but you have to make sure to keep that boy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Will do, mother”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>+++</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rosa sat, her Gryffindor colored uniform already on, in a blissfully empty compartment as the Hogwarts Express pressed on its journey. Her mother never came to the platform with her, a fact that she had grown to accept. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Even today, the fact saddened her. The platform was bustling, even though it was 30 minutes before the train was to depart. Mothers were crying, fathers were giving awkward hugs to their children. The students themselves were feeling bittersweet, first years were looking at the train wide-eyed. On her first year, seeing everyone’s families seeing their children off had broken her heart. The platform was simply filled with unconditional love, which of the receiving end Rosa had not belonged often during her lifetime. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rosa averted her gaze, deciding that she had hurt herself by watching the families for long enough now. She stared at the opposing empty seat. The compartment door slid open with a click, Rosa’s head snapped to see the person who dared to disturb her peace. She grimaced. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t look so sad to see me again, Rosa Dawn” Draco Malfoy greeted with his trademark smirk. The pair had known each other since they were children, growing up in the same circles. But they were not friends, guite opposite to that really. Rosa’s bloodline was a wall between their friendship.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you have to find me every year, Malfoy?”  she said with a sigh. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course.” he started, now leaning against the opening of the compartment, “--but I think congratulations are in order this year” Rosa bit the inside of her cheek. Pureblood rumours went around quickly. “Thank you” she answered, not meeting his deviant eyes. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You don’t sound very excited, Rosa Dawn. Greengrass was practically jumping when I reserved her” So, that’s why he was here. To brag about his reservation. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You sound as if it was your decision” Rosa clapped back, Malfoy’s smirk wavered. He crossed his arms swiftly. He ignored the statement.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What do you think Vincent will say when he finds out that you’re not that excited?” Malfoy asked in a sing-songy voice. Rosa scoffed. “Oh, really? I don’t think Astoria would be super happy about you fraternizing with another lady on the market either, Malfoy” He rolled his eyes, knowing well that Rosa’s word against his was worth next to none. It was worth a shot.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Charms homework, until Christmas.” she offered. Malfoy flashed a genuine smile. Rosa was on the top of class in charms, his homework would be perfectly finished. Rosa knew that the best thing she had to offer was her brain, as her name held no power in Malfoy’s eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Though I would love that, I’d so much rather watch you beg” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Excuse me?” for the first time, Rosa let her eyes meet the Slytherin’s dead on. Her look was one of disgust, whilst the boy looked thoroughly amused. “I’d rather have you on your knees, begging me not to break your reservation.”</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“It sounds to me as if you are </span>
  <em>
    <span>begging </span>
  </em>
  <span>to be hexed right now” Rosa’s glare at that moment could’ve rivaled You-Know-Who’s. “Oh, come on, Rosa Dawn. Have a sense of humour for once in your life.” he growled, not finding the situation as fun anymore (for a good reason; Malfoy was often receiving her skillful hexes, but he also feared her right hook). “--bring my homework to the library on Sunday” Malfoy practically slammed the compartment door shut. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Aye, aye, Captain” Rosa mumbled under her breath, as the Hogwarts Express started to move towards its destination.</span>
