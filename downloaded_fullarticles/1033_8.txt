          <div class="userstuff"><p>Our story starts in The Minister For Magic's office, Cornelius Fudge ex Minister is trying to convince Rufus Scrimgeour that it's time for him to retire.</p><p>Cornelius said, "Think about it you nearly died because of your position."</p><p>Rufus stated, "That's true, but I was also saved by you while in this position."</p><p>Cornelius sighed. "I just think that it's time for you to hand the reins over to a more appropriate candidate."</p><p>Rufus frowned. "You may be right there, but now isn't the time to just leave."</p><p>Cornelius replied, "Now's the perfect time, The Second Wizarding War is over and we won. Ruf, this is the exact right time for you to resign. There are plenty of bright young witches and wizards willing to take up the reins."</p><p>Rufus smiled ever so slightly. "I suppose you're right, Corny. I've had my fill of disasters as Minister, it's time for someone else to deal with all of this nonsense."</p><p>Cornelius grinned. "That's what I like to hear!"</p></div>
