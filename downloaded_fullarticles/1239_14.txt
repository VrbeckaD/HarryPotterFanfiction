</p><p>
  <strong>Hermione/ ?</strong>
</p><p>A note before we get started is that Harry and his friends are again a year older than in the original story, it just makes more sense. Just letting you guys this Chapter is an updated one with better grammar. Hopefully it is easier for you guys to read.</p><p>The others are to be decided so if you have any ideas please let me know. This is my first crack at a non-gay story so let me know how I am doing. I am intending to create a Harry/ Fred story at some point I'm just letting you all know now.</p><p> The words that are misspelled are done on purpose in order to portray the accents of the French and Bulgarians. I have updated this story and fixed the mistakes.</p><p>This story will contain Ginny bashing and a lot of it and Dumbledore bashing as well. Death will happen as planned but it may not be who you all think it will be. I am full of surprises as you all well know!</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>Chapter 1: My guardian Angel</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>It was the summer before fourth year at Hogwarts and you can find Harry at the Dursley's alone in his room. <em>*When am I going to get out of the hell hole? Dumbledore won't listen to a word I tell him. He always just keeps saying you are safest there I know what is best for you. Screw you Dumbledore you don't know anything!*</em> "Harry Potter get down here now!" Harry groans inwardly and thinks. <em>*What in the bloody world does he want now? I can't get a moment of peace in this place.*</em> He then sighs to himself. "I'm coming Uncle." Harry gets off his bed and heads downstairs wondering again what they could possibly want with him. Harry walks into the family room. "I'm here what do you need uncle?"</p><p> </p><p>His uncle sneers at him. "Don't you dare give me attitude boy."</p><p> </p><p>Harry rolls his eyes without his uncle seeing this. "Sorry uncle it won't happen again." Petunia just looks at him with regret filled in her eyes. She was sorry that she allowed this to happen to her nephew. This was the only thing that Vernon could do, she would not let anyone physically harm him. Her reasoning to her husband was that "his" kind would come check up on him and they didn't want anyone to ask questions including the neighbors. Petunia recalls this conversation with her husband about Harry's treatment. However, this was not the only reason, she really did care for the boy and someone had to watch over him since she knew Dumbledore didn't give a crap about him really. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <strong>Flashback</strong>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Petunia walks into her bedroom to talk to her husband. "Vernon dear we need to discuss how we are going to treat my sister's child."</em>
</p><p>
  <em> Vernon looks up at his wife. "Well I'm certainly not going to treat him like he's one of the family."</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Petunia nods her head. "That is fine with me dear, but we have to make sure that a hand is never laid upon him."</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Vernon looks shocked. "But dear..."</em>
</p><p>
  <em> Petunia cuts him off and raises her hands. "I'm not defending the little runt." She pretends to sneer. "But do you really want people of his kind to come and check on him and find that he has un-explainable marks all over him?"</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Vernon is forced to concede because he doesn't want any those freaks to step one foot into his house. "Okay dear I will agree to these terms, but we are not going to tell him anything about where he comes from deal?"</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Petunia nods. "Of course dear." She silently thinks to herself: *To bad I don't actually intend to keep that promise, Harry deserves to know the truth.*</em>

  <strong> </strong>
</p><p>Petunia realized very early on that he was not someone to be trusted. She also knew that her sister did not want Harry raised by her because of her husband but Dumbledore went against their wishes and did it anyway. Petunia was furious when they had found Harry outside that fateful morning and she had no idea why he was left there. She has been furious with Dumbledore ever since then and couldn't wait to get her hands on him. She was listening Harry and Vernon's conversation and after it was over she pulled Harry aside. "There are a couple of letters in your room for you when you have finished your chores." Harry smiles at her. "Thanks Aunt Petunia." She just smiled at him. </p><p> </p><p>Harry had decided fairly quickly that Aunt Petunia really wasn't that bad it was Dudley and Vernon that he had to worry about, and Harry was relieved for that fact. It was bad enough with Uncle Vernon and Dudley and there, constant verbal abuse that they threw on him on a daily basis. </p><p> </p><p>He didn't need Aunt Petunia to be that way too. Harry went outside to work in the garden like Uncle Vernon told him to. He was never asked if he wanted to do something or not, he was never given a choice. Harry knew that if he questioned any of Uncle Vernon's orders that he would be punished severely. Aunt Petunia had to step in a couple of times to prevent Vernon from physically striking Harry. </p><p> </p><p>Aunt Petunia also, had to convince Uncle Vernon to let Harry have Dudley's second bedroom, prior to this happening Harry's home had been the cupboard underneath the stairs. Uncle Vernon had relented and gave into his wife's request and her reasoning again was that if Harry's kind came by to check on him they would want to see that he was being treated fairly.</p><p> </p><p>Hours went by before Harry was finally finished with all the chores that Uncle Vernon had given him that morning and that included cooking dinner which he didn't receive any of course. So, Harry was sent straight to his room after making it and his uncle's reasoning for mouthing off to him that morning. Harry just nodded his head and again did what his uncle told him to do.</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <strong>∞∞∞∞∞∞</strong>
</p><p>Once he got upstairs he noticed a couple of letters in his room and he grabbed them and sat on his bed to read them.</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>Dear Harry,</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong> </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>Hey mate I haven't heard from you in a while and I was wondering if everything was okay. Summer so far has been nuts, mom is all in a tizzy because Bill and Charlie are coming for a couple of weeks to visit and everything must be perfect. It is so annoying the only thing more annoying is Ginny's constant obsession with you. She won't stop talking about how she is going to be the future Mrs. Potter. Someone please shoot me already.</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong> </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong> The main reason for writing to you is to invite you to the quidditch world cup with us and of course for you to stay with us for the last three weeks of summer vacation. I have also enclosed a ticket for you. I think Charlie is going to pick you up in a couple of days. I can't wait to see you. So please send your response back to me so I can let Charlie know if he is going to pick up or not.</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong> </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>From,</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>Ron</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>Harry couldn't stop laughing after he read the part about Mrs. Weasley but then he became sour when he read the part about Ginny. So, before he forgot he decided to write a response down for Ron. But, before he could write a response there was knocking on his door. Harry got up and answered it immediately fearing that it was his uncle.</p><p> </p><p>Harry opened the door. "Oh, hello Aunt Petunia how can I help you?" He said this in complete sincerity.</p><p> </p><p>Petunia just smiles. "I wanted bring you something to eat since Vernon sent you up here without any food." She hands Harry the plate that she was carrying.</p><p> </p><p>Harry takes the plate from here. "Thank you Aunt Petunia, I really appreciate it."</p><p> </p><p>"Your welcome Harry." Petunia turns to leave but Harry calls her name. </p><p>"Aunt Petunia please wait I wanted to ask you something."</p><p> Petunia turns herself around and looks at her nephew. "What did you need to ask me?"</p><p> </p><p>"Well my friend Ron invited me to stay with him for the remainder of the summer and I was kind of hoping that I would be allowed to go."</p><p> </p><p>Petunia thinks about for a minute but then smiles and nods. "Of course you can. You deserve to have some fun during the summer. I will inform your uncle and make sure you inform your friend."</p><p> Harry smiles big. "Thank you so much Aunt Petunia." He catches her briefly off guard by hugging her but she hugs him back then she leaves to go downstairs.</p><p>Again, Harry sits down to write a response to Ron.</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>Dear Ron,</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong> </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>Thank you for writing and yes, I'm okay and I'm sorry for not writing any sooner my uncle has given me so many chores I have barely had any time to breath let alone write letters to my friends. The part about your mom is hilarious I can only imagine what its like to live there every time she gets like that.</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong> </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>I decided I would write back to you immediately, so I didn't forget cuz you know me I tend to do that when I get distracted. (LOL) Anyway, I asked my aunt and she said that I could stay with you guys for the remaining three weeks of summer vacation. I can't wait to see you all again.</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong> </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>Sincerely,</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>Harry</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>As soon as he had put the letter into an envelope he moved on to the next letter which assumed was from Hermione.</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>Hiya Harry,</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong> </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>I hope you are doing well this summer. I for one am so tired with all this homework we must do. I hope that you have completed yours, I know that Ron didn't so I'm not even going to bother asking him if he completed his. I know he just going to try and ask me to do it for him or at the very least ask me to help him with it. Which I swear this time I am going to tell him no and I'm not going to change my mind. </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong> </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>Anyway, I wanted to say beware of Ginny she is becoming a little more obsessed than normal about you and everyone is worried. Dumbledore is also starting to worry me, but I don't want to say anything over a letter, so I will talk to you in a couple of days. See you soon.</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong> </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>Sincerely,</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>Hermione</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong> </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>P.S. I sent a treat for Hedwig I hope you don't mind.</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>Harry smiled his friends always knew how to cheer him up. He also laughed about the part about Hermione refusing to help Ron with his homework, luckily for Harry he had already completed all his homework for once. He turned his head and noticed that there was also a letter from Sirius, but he decided to read it another day as he was too tired to read it tonight. So, before he goes to sleep he sends Hedwig with his letter for Ron.</p><p> </p><p>"Hey girl I need you to get this to Ron as soon as possible." Hedwig hoots at him and takes the letter into her mouth and flies out the window.</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <strong>∞∞∞∞∞∞</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>The next day the Weasley's are all going on with their business when a familiar white snowy owl flies into the kitchen right in front of Mrs. Weasley.</p><p> </p><p>Molly notices the owl and calls for her youngest son. "Ron I believe that you have a letter here. There is a white snowy owl waiting patiently."</p><p> </p><p>Ron runs down the stairs and goes into the kitchen. "Awesome!" He walks over to Hedwig and gently takes the letter from her beak and Molly gives her an owl treat.</p><p> </p><p>Ron reads the letter and looks up with a big smile on his face. "Harry said his aunt has given him permission to stay with us for the rest of summer vacation."</p><p> </p><p>Molly is delighted to hear this. "That's wonderful my dear. We will just have to make space for him in your room again. Who is going to retrieve him?"</p><p> </p><p>Ron smiles at his mother. "Charlie is going to get him on his way to coming here."</p><p> </p><p>Molly just nods at her son's response. "Oh well that is good. Is Harry going to know who Charlie is?"</p><p>Ron laughs. "I'm pretty the flaming red hair and freckles is dead giveaway."</p><p>Molly just smiles and rolls her eyes. "Oh you." She whips the towel that she is holding in his direction. "Out with you." She is laughing a little as she says this.</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <strong>∞∞∞∞∞∞</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong> </strong>
</p><p>A few days later Harry is outside working in the garden when his aunt comes outside to talk to him.</p><p>Petunia walks up to Harry and he looks up at her. "Hello Aunt Petunia is there something you needed?"</p><p>She just nods at him. "Yes, Harry I just wanted to talk to you before you left."</p><p>Harry nodded and asked her. "Where are Dudley and Uncle Vernon?" </p><p>"Vernon took Dudley out for some ice cream and I do believe someone should be picking you up soon. But Harry, I wanted to warn you about Dumbledore."</p><p> </p><p>Harry looks at her strangely. "What do you mean you wanted to warn me about Dumbledore? He hasn't done anything wrong has he?"</p><p> </p><p> Aunt Petunia just looks at him with sad eyes. "Unfortunately, he has I wanted to make sure that you were prepared for this year. Before your mom passed away she sent me a letter expressing her concern about him. She didn't go into a lot of detail but did express that something felt very wrong and was questioning which side she should really be on."</p><p> Harry was stunned. "My own mother was questioning what side she should be on? But that doesn't make any sense, Voldemort was the one to kill her and my dad."</p><p> </p><p>Aunt Petunia just looks at him. "Was he though? I don't believe that you have all of the facts right. I want you to be safe Harry and use your head first before jumping into any reckless situations and don't let him control you, he doesn't really care about your well being and I don't want to see you get hurt. You weren't supposed to be sent here there were many different options for you. Also, please remember that you can contact me if you need help."</p><p>Harry nods in agreement. "I promise I will think before I act and thank you for being here for me and why didn't you send me to one of those other options?"</p><p>Petunia thinks for a moment before answering his question. "Well your godfather was sent to prison and the Longbottom's are no longer able to raise you and Dumbledore wouldn't allow you to be raised by Mr. Lupin or the Delecour's."</p><p> </p><p>Harry looks at her questioningly. "Who are they?"</p><p>"I believe you will be meeting them soon. Have an enjoyable time and be safe." She hugs him and walks back into the house.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A couple hours later Harry is back outside but this time he is out front waiting for Ron's brother Charlie to pick him. He notices someone walking towards and he doesn't know who it is and is about to grab his wand until he notices the flaming red hair. </p><p> </p><p>Charlie walks up to him. "Hi Harry I'm Charlie, I'm here to bring you to our house."</p><p> </p><p>Harry nodded. "Hello Charlie is nice to finally meet you and thank you for picking me up."</p><p>Charlie nods "No problem, are you ready to go or do you need to grab a few more things?"</p><p>Harry shakes his head. "Nope I'm all set I can't wait so see your family."</p><p>Charlie smiles at him. "Well then let's get going. Harry, I need you to grab my arm we are going to apparate there." </p><p> </p><p>Harry looks confused but nods in agreement and as soon as he grabs Charlie's arm they are pulled and are spinning until they are in front of the Burrow. Harry has a very strong urge to puck and so he does.</p><p> </p><p>Charlie looks at him and chuckles. "Yeah that is completely common for the first time. It takes some getting used to."</p><p> </p><p>Harry shakes his head. "I never want to do that again." Charlie chuckles again and the two of them walk into the house.</p><p> </p><p>Charlie shouts into the house. "Mom I'm home." The next thing they know is Mrs. Weasley is flying towards her second oldest son and pulling him into a big hug.</p><p> </p><p>"Oh, Charlie I have missed you so much since you decided to move to Romania."</p><p> </p><p>"Mom I have missed you guys too but you know it's my calling to work with dragons, but I will always come and see you guys."</p><p> </p><p>Wiping her tears away. "I know it is dear, but did you have to move so far way?"</p><p> </p><p>Charlie looks at his mother and smiles. "No, I guess not. Maybe I will see if I can get transferred to a closer reserve."</p><p> </p><p>This makes Molly very happy then she sees Harry is standing next to Charlie. "Oh, Harry dear I almost didn't see you standing there." She pulls him into a tight hug as well.</p><p> </p><p>Harry hugs her back and smiles. "Hello Mrs. Weasley."</p><p>Molly pulls away and gives him a stern look. "Honestly how many times do I have tell you to call me Molly or mum."</p><p>Harry chuckles a little. "This will be the last time I promise Molly."</p><p>Charlie starts laughing at Harry as he says this. "You know she is going to hold you to that."</p><p>Harry turns his head to look at Charlie and smiles. "Yeah I figured as much."</p><p>Gives him another stern looking expression Molly points a finger at Harry. "It had better be and you're still far too skinny for my liking. Let's see if we can't fatten you up a little bit before you go back to school."</p><p> </p><p>Harry smiles big in return. "Thank you Molly."</p><p>Molly smiles at him. "No thanks is needed Harry dear I think of you as one of my son's also."</p><p>Harry really does think of Molly as mother since never got the chance to know his. "Where are Ron and Hermione?"</p><p>Molly responds. "They should be outside dear."</p><p> </p><p>Harry nods. "Thank you again Molly." Then he walks outside in search of his two best friends. He smiles when he sees them bickering like an old married couple. "Do you two ever stop fighting?"</p><p>Ron and Hermione immediately stop what they are doing, and Hermione flings her arms around Harry and squeezes.</p><p>Harry pats her back. "It's great to see you too Mione but I would like to breath if you don't mind."</p><p>Hermione blushes and let's go. "Oh sorry Harry."</p><p>Ron chuckles and hugs Harry as well but not as hard as Mione. "How are you mate?"</p><p> </p><p>Harry smiles at Ron. "I'm okay at least I'm here for the rest of summer. Aunt Petunia had to keep Uncle Vernon from hitting me on several occasions."</p><p> </p><p>Hermione gasps and puts her hands over her mouth. "Oh, Harry that is awful, there is no way that you can continue to go back there or something bad is going to happen to you."</p><p>Harry sits down on the grass and nods his head. "Yeah I know it is, but Dumbledore won't do anything about."</p><p>Fred and George come outside. Fred speaks. "We thought we heard voice how you are Harry?"</p><p>Harry smiles at the twins. "I'm good glad to be here."</p><p>George speaks next. "We are too Harry. Now what was this about Dumbledore?"</p><p>Charlie comes to the backdoor and leans against. "Yes, I would like to know that as well."</p><p>Harry looks around and rolls his eyes. "Oh boy well I guess its better that you all are here, so I don't have to repeat myself."</p><p>Bill walks towards Charlie giving him a big hug before turning his attentions to the rest of the group. "Hello children what did miss."</p><p> </p><p>Charlie looks at him. "Not much yet anyways. Harry was going to tell us something about Dumbledore."</p><p>Harry looks at Bill. "Hey Bill think you could do me a favor and put up a strong silencing charm this is going to be a bit of a shock and I don't want prying ears to hear this."</p><p>Bill nods. "Of course." He mutters some complicated sounding spells. "Okay we are good to go."</p><p>Harry smiles and takes a deep breath. "Okay so during my time at the Dursley's this summer Aunt Petunia told me some very interesting things about my mom and Dumbledore. The first thing she said was the that a little bit before my mom was killed she sent Aunt Petunia a letter and inside the letter were some of my mom's concerns about Dumbledore."</p><p> </p><p>Hermione looks at Harry. "What were some of her concerns?"</p><p>Harry shakes his head. "She didn't go into detail, but she said not to trust him. Then she told me the most shocking part of the letter my mum wrote to her. Mum said she was questioning whether or not she was fighting for the right side of the war."</p><p> </p><p>The Weasley kids that were standing there including Hermione all gasped. Charlie looks at him. "Are you serious Harry?"</p><p>Harry nods. "Yeah I am and when I asked Aunt Petunia about that and told her the Voldemort was the one who killed them she just looked at me and asked did he really?"</p><p> </p><p>Fred speaks up. "Well if Dumbledore is really up to no good then we all have to stick together and investigate this."</p><p>George nods. "I agree brother and Harry I think you should ask Sirius and Remus about this."</p><p>Ron puts a reassuring hand on Harry's shoulder. "We are with you mate and we will keep a close eye or closes eyes on him. What do you think about this?"</p><p> </p><p>Harry shrugs his shoulders. "I'm not sure to be honest but Aunt Petunia also told me that I was never supposed to go to them. It was stated in both of parents wills and Dumbledore disobeyed their most important request."</p><p>Bill just shakes his head. "You know Harry I don't think that your parents will have ever been read either. I can ask the goblins to look into on your behalf."</p><p>Harry smiles. "Thanks Bill but will they really do that?"</p><p>Bill stands there a little stunned. "Of course they will, you're one of their wealthiest customers."</p><p>"I am?" Harry asked a little shocked.</p><p>Bill just looks at him astonished. "Yeah you are, you're one of the wealthiest people in the world not just in London."</p><p> </p><p>Fred and George just look at each other and both mentally agree on something then Fred speaks. "Yep I buy your aunt's story Harry. Dumbledore is definitely not too be trusted and Sirius and Remus are going to be furious when they hear all of this."</p><p> </p><p>The gang continues to talk until they hear Molly announce that it was dinner time. Bill dropped the charms and they all walked over to the table to eat dinner.</p><p> </p><p>Later that night when everyone was getting ready for bed Harry and Ron. </p><p>Ron looks at Harry. "What are you going to do about Dumbledore?"</p><p>Harry looks at Ron. "To be honest I really don't know Ron. I'm kind surprised by this and sort of not surprised at the same time."</p><p> "What do you mean by that?"</p><p>Harry shrugs his shoulders. "Well I kind of figured that my parents didn't want me to go live with my aunt and uncle and after Dumbledore constantly refused my request to be moved somewhere I knew that something was up. But, I didn't know that it could potentially go even deeper than that."</p><p> </p><p>"Yeah I know and to be honest that's a really scary thought. But, like I said earlier we are behind you and I can almost assure you that most of our friends will be too."</p><p> Harry smiles. "Thanks Ron that means a lot."</p><p> Ron smiles back at him. "Any time mate we are like brothers and Hermione is like a sister to us."</p><p> </p><p align="center">

</p><p>
  <strong> </strong>
</p><p>Two days later at the Burrow and it is the morning of the Quidditch World Cup and the house is in a bustle.</p><p> </p><p>Molly was bustling around frantically in the kitchen trying to get everything for her family for the Quidditch World Cup. "Boys let's get moving or you are going to be seriously late." One by one each of her children including Harry and Hermione come downstairs fully dressed. "Now I want each of you to grab some breakfast and be on your way."</p><p> </p><p>They all say in unison. "Yes Mum and yes Molly." They all grab a quick breakfast and go outside to meet Arthur who is waiting for them." </p><p>Arthur looks at the gang walking outside. "Well its about bloody time you all got your butts outside."</p><p>They all mumble. "Sorry."</p><p>Arthur just shakes his head. "Well we better get going." The gang nods and they all start walking to their unknown destination.</p><p>Harry whispers to Ron. "Uh where are we going?"</p><p> </p><p>Ron shrugs his shoulders. "I dunno." Then  he shouts up to his dad. "Dad, where are we going?"</p><p>Arthur looks over his shoulder slightly. "You will all find out in a minute."</p><p>A minute later they are greeted by a friendly man. "Arthur you finally made it. I was beginning to worry."</p><p>Arthur shakes his head. "I'm sorry about that Amos we had a lot of people to get ready and some of us decided to get up late." He turns his head and looks at Ron.</p><p> </p><p>Amos just smiles. "It's alright really I'm just glad that you guys were able to make it."</p><p>Charlie looks at his father then at the other man and something clicks in his head. "You're Amos Diggory, aren't you?"</p><p>Amos nods his head. "Yes I am, and this is my son Cedric I'm sure some of you know him." He pulls Cedric over to the kids.</p><p> </p><p>Fred and George immediately greet Cedric then Cedric walks over to Harry. "Hello Harry."</p><p>Harry smiles. "Hey Cedric how was your summer?"</p><p>Cedric smiles back at him. "It was pretty good how about yours?"</p><p>"Oh, it's better now that I'm staying with the Weasley's for the rest of the summer."</p><p> </p><p>Cedric looks at him quizzically. "Well that is good to hear." Everyone continues to walk a little further until they make up to the top of a hill where a boot was sitting.</p><p> </p><p>Ron looks at the boot then looks at his dad. "Why are we standing around the mangy old boot for?"</p><p> </p><p>"It's a portkey Ron. Now everyone grabs onto the boot." Everyone immediately grabs onto the boot and it activates. Next thing they know Arthur is shouting at them. "Let go!" Hermione shouts. "WHAT!!" </p><p>Arthur says again. "Let go of the boot."</p><p> </p><p>So, against their better judgement the kids let go. Most of the kids get slammed into the ground then they see Arthur, Amos, Cedric, Bill, and Charlie strolling down out the sky.</p><p> </p><p>Fred looks at them. "How the bloody hell did you guys learn how to do that?"</p><p>Charlie smirks at his brother. "Wouldn't you like to know?"</p><p>George looks at him and rolls his eyes. "Yes, that was the point of Fred asking in the first place."</p><p>Cedric comes over to Harry and offers him a hand. </p><p>Harry takes it and says. "Thanks Cedric."</p><p>Cedric smiles. "No problem Harry."</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <strong>∞∞∞∞∞∞</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>After everyone got themselves picked up off the ground the gang walks toward the entrance of the camp grounds to the Quidditch World Cup.</p><p> The person at the front asked, "What is the name for your reservation?"</p><p>Arthur answers . "Weasley."</p><p>The man looks at the list and says. "Ah here you are you're in lot 234, enjoy your stay."</p><p>Arthur smiles. "Thank you."</p><p>Amos and Cedric move forward, and the man again asks for the reservation name.</p><p> </p><p>Amos speaks up. "It would be under Diggory, sir"</p><p>The man finds the name. "Very good and you are in lot 200."</p><p>Amos says. "Thank you sir." Then he turns to Arthur. "Well sir I guess we will be seeing you at the game."</p><p> </p><p>Arthur shakes his hand. "Yes we will." Amos and Cedric went their separate ways. Arthur turns to his group. "Okay guys lets start walking to our tent" the nods their heads and they finally arrive at lot 234. </p><p>Harry just stopped in front of the tent and looked at in confusion. "This is where we are staying how is everyone going to fit inside?"</p><p> </p><p>Bill walks next to him and puts his hand on his shoulder. "It's called magic Harry have you ever heard of it." He then laughs at Harry's expression.</p><p> </p><p>Harry fake laughs at Bill. "Haha Bill very funny." So, Harry decides to check it out and it stunned at soon as he enters the tent. "Wow, I love magic!!"</p><p> </p><p>Inside the tent there were 7 bedrooms and a kitchen and one living area for everyone. Arthur looks at the girls. "Hermione and Ginny you two need to pick a room and stick to your choice."</p><p>Ginny replied. "Okay dad." Ginny and Hermione pick one the rooms.</p><p>After everyone picks a room most of the gang sits down Ginny comes over to Harry and sits down next to him. "Hey Harry."</p><p>Harry looks at her nervously. "Hey Ginny."</p><p>Ginny tries to snuggle up to him and Harry looks at the Weasley's desperately for help.</p><p> </p><p>Bill speaks up. "Hey Gin why don't you come with me and we can look at some of the things that the traders are selling?"</p><p>Ginny smiles. "Okay Bill sounds good." She gives Harry a kiss on the cheek. "Bye Harry, I will see you later." Ginny leaves with Bill. Harry breathes a sigh of relief.</p><p> </p><p>Ron looks at Harry. "Man that could have gotten really uncomfortable really fast."</p><p> </p><p>Harry nods. "Yeah I know, thank goodness for Bill stepping in."</p><p>Charlie shakes his head. "I don't understand what is going on with her. Does she normally act like that around Harry?"</p><p>George shakes his head. "No, not normally this bad she has always had a celebrity crush on Harry but this summer she just went nuts with it."</p><p>Arthur finally speaks up. "Molly and I have tried to talk to her about it, but she claims that she is fine and nothing strange is going on."</p><p>Harry nods. "Well as long as you guys keep helping I think we should be fine. Hey guys I think I'm going to go take a walk for a little bit before the game."</p><p>Hermione looks at him. "Do you want us to come with you?"</p><p>Ron speaks up. "We should let him go Mione he needs some time alone." He turns around and looks at Harry. "Hey stay safe and we will see you soon."</p><p>Harry nods and mouths thank you before walking out of the tent to explore.</p><p> </p><p align="center">

</p><p> </p><p>Harry was mesmerized by all of the colors and cultures that were represented at the separate tents. Harry got distracted by one of the tents and wasn't paying attention to where he was going and plowed into someone and they both fell.</p><p> </p><p>He was so embarrassed and immediately got up and began to apologize and help the girl up. "I am so sorry I wasn't looking at where I was going."</p><p>The girl turns around and for a split-second Harry's breath stops but he is able to regain his composure as soon as the girl speaks. </p><p>"It'z okay. I wasn't paying attention either." She takes a quick minute to look at the boy she ran into and was impressed at what she was seeing. This boy had jet black hair with the most beautiful green eyes she had ever seen, he was a little on the short side and was wearing these terrible glasses.</p><p>Harry held his hand out for her. "My name is Harry what is yours?"</p><p>Fleur smiles. "My name iz Fleur Delacour."</p><p>Harry smiles back at her. "It is very nice to meet you Fleur where are you from?"</p><p> </p><p>Fleur smiles at him. "My home country iz France and I am here with my parents and my lettle sister Gabrielle."</p><p>Harry smiles back at her. "That is very cool I came with my best friend's family."</p><p> </p><p>Fleur looks at him. "Arry whatz your last name?"</p><p>Harry looks at her sheepishly. "Oh, its Potter, I'm Harry Potter why?"</p><p>Fleur was shocked not only had to literally run into the most famous wizard, but he was immune to her Veela genes. "Oh, no reason I was just curious. Where are you sitting for the game?"</p><p>Harry thinks about it. "Oh um I think that we are in the highest box."</p><p>Fleur frowns a little bit.  "Really I was sure that you would be in a private box..hmm maybe I can talk to my father."</p><p>Harry shakes his. "It's okay Fleur you don't have to do that really we are okay."</p><p>Fleur smiles. "Oh nonsense 'Arry I'm going to do it anyways."</p><p> </p><p>Harry just shakes his head and laughs. "Well alright Fleur if you insist but, I think I should be heading back to my tent."</p><p>Fleur agrees. "Yes, I should be too, but I will see you later Mr. Harry Potter." She walks over to him and kisses him on the cheek and leaves to her tent.</p><p> </p><p>Harry just places a hand to his cheek and he is pretty sure that if anyone saw him right now he would look like a tomato for sure. It took him a few minutes to comprehend what just happened to him *I can't believe I just met a girl as beautiful as Fleur and she kissed me on my cheek.*</p><p>Once he was able to finish processing everything that had just occurred he decided to walk back to the tent to tell Hermione and Ron what he just went through on his sight-seeing adventure.</p><p>Harry walked into the tent and over to where Ron and Hermione were sitting. "You guys will never guess what just happened to me."</p><p> </p><p>Hermione looks up at him. "Of course something happened to you even though we have only been here for a few hours...What happened?"</p><p> </p><p>Harry laughs a little. "So I was walking, and I literally ran into someone because I wasn't paying any attention. When I helped her up my breath stopped for a second she was so beautiful."</p><p>Hermione smiles. "What was her name Harry?"</p><p>Harry smiles big. "Her name is Fleur Delacour."</p><p>Arthur after hearing this looked up from reading the paper. "Oh you just had your first encounter with a Veela."</p><p>Harry just looked at him. "What in the world is a Veela Arthur?"</p><p> </p><p> Arthur just smiles at him. "They are beautiful creature's that have an allure to them that can help them find a mate and they can only have one mate in their lifetime. Unfortunately, this allure can also have a nasty side effect, they usually attract a lot of unwanted attention from almost the entire male population which I would almost have to guess is most annoying because there is no way to stop it from occurring."</p><p> </p><p>Ron was a little jealous, but he knew that Harry deserved to be happy just like anyone else. "Congrats mate it looks like you found yourself a winner."</p><p> </p><p>Harry blushed. "You're not mad or jealous about this?" Harry thought *Yep, she must be my guardian angel.*</p><p> </p><p>Ron shook his head no. "Why would I be mad or jealous you deserve to be happy and especially with someone who likes you for you and not because of your fame."</p><p> </p><p>Harry tried to protest. "She is just a friend who happens to be girl." </p><p>Ron and Hermione just gave him a look. </p><p>Harry sighs and gives in to their looks. "Alright you guys win! Maybe I do want her and I to be more than just friends. Are you two happy now"! </p><p>Ron and Hermione just laugh and give each other a high five and then they both say "YES!!!!"</p><p> </p><p align="center">

</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Fleur entered her family's tent with a big smile on her face. Her mother looks up at her. "What has got you so happy my dear flower?"</p><p>Fleur sits down in one of the comfy chairs. "Oh mama it was so wonderful, he is so wonderful."</p><p>Her mother and father just look at each other with a raised eyebrow.</p><p>Her father looks at her. "Who is wonderful my dear?"</p><p>She smiles big. "I met him papa I really met him..I met the famous Harry Potter."</p><p> </p><p>Her mother was shocked . "You did?! But what makes him so wonderful?"</p><p>She looks at her mother. "He's immune mama."</p><p>Her mother just looks at her incredulously. "He's immune to the Veela allure?"</p><p>Fleur nods excitedly. "Yes, and he is super cute with the most gorgeous green eyes I have ever seen."</p><p>Her father is shocked. "It sounds like your Veela has found its mate my dear and only on the first meeting. He must certainly be extremely powerful."</p><p> </p><p>"Oh, papa I promised 'Arry if we could get him and his friends better seats because his tickets are for the very last row."</p><p>Her father shakes his head. "That is just disrespectful. It is also no way to treat a future nobleman. Yes, of course my dear we can do that."</p><p>Fleur smiles. "Then I would like to request staying outside of the entrance to bring them to us."</p><p>Her father smiles. "Of course my little flower you may wait for them outside of the entrance."</p><p>Fleur giggles and kisses her father's cheek. "Thank you papa."</p><p>He smiles at his daughter and he can tell she is already smitten with this young man. "You're welcome my flower."</p><p> </p><p align="center">

  <strong> </strong>
</p><p>Later that day it was getting close to the time for the match to begin. So, all the guests that were going to be in attendance were starting to make their way to their seats in the gigantic stadium when Harry and the gang were stopped by a beautiful girl.</p><p> </p><p>"Hello 'Arry. Are these your friends." Fleur asks him.</p><p>Harry smiles. "Yes, Fleur these are my friends. What are you doing out here?"</p><p> </p><p>Fleur smiles at him "well, I told you I was going to ask my papa to get your seats moved and so I did, and he moved them. You and your friends were moved to a private box right next to my family."</p><p>Arthur shakes his head in shock as the Veela allure didn't work on him either. "Fleur that is very kind of you, but we could never accept."</p><p>Fleur wasn't going to let him decline. "Oh nonsense my papa insists. I'm sure you know him Mr. Weasley my papa is Jacques Delacour."</p><p>Arthur nods his head and smiles. "Yes, I do know him well then we mustn’t keep the French Prime Minister waiting." </p><p>Fleur smiles, and they begin to walk to their brand-new seats.</p><p> </p><p>Before the group gets to their seats they are stopped by one blonde haired prat and his father.</p><p>Lucius sneered at them and said. "Well, well what do we have here?" Draco looked at them and was ashamed that his father always had to pick a fight with them every time they crossed paths. </p><p>"Father let's just go we shouldn't waste our time here." His father agreed and before he left he gave Hermione a wink and walked away with his father. Hermione blushed a little and Harry whispered. "What was that all about?"</p><p>Hermione shakes her head and whispers back. "Not now I will tell you later."</p><p>Harry nodded in agreement and they continued to follow Fleur to their new seats. They finally arrive at their destination and Fleur walks over to a very tall man. "Papa I would like you to officially meet 'Arry Potter, the Weasley family, and his other friend 'Ermione Granger."</p><p> </p><p>Jacques turns around and goes over to shake Harry's hand. "It is nice to finally meet you Mr. Potter."</p><p>Harry shakes his hand. "Please just call me Harry that's what all of my friends call me."</p><p>Jacques smiles at him. "You're very polite Harry. Then I insist that you call me Jacques."</p><p>Harry smiles and nods in agreement and Jacques goes over to shake Arthur's hand. "Ah Mr. Weasley it is so good to see you again."</p><p>"Likewise, Mr. Delacour. Thank you so much for getting us the amazing seats on such short notice."</p><p>"It was nothing really. My daughter asked, and I delivered and speaking of daughters I would like to introduce my younger daughter Gabrielle and my wife Apolline."</p><p> </p><p>After all of the introductions were done Harry, Hermione, and the Weasley's all filled into their new box to watch the Quidditch World Cup Final.</p><p>As soon as all of the guests were in their seats Prime Minister Fudge stood to make his introduction speech. After he was completed he announced the start of the game.</p><p> </p><p>The first thing that could be seen was green and white then a leprechaun could be seen dancing in the stands and out flew the Irish team. No less than a minute later red and black could be seen everywhere and a huge picture could be seen of their seeker and he came out and the fans started cheering even louder.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione leans over to Ron. "Who in the world is that?"</p><p>Ron looks at the guy dreamily then looks back at Hermione and smiles. "That is the youngest seeker ever to make it to a world cup team. He is the greatest seeker in the world, Viktor Krum."</p><p>Hermione just shook her head because it made Ron sound like he had a crush on the man, but she let it go. </p><p> </p><p>The game started, and the Irish chasers were all over the Bulgarian beaters, they couldn't be stopped. This continued for the next two hours until Viktor Krum pulled a Wonski Fient and grabbed the snitch. Unfortunately, the Irish were up by some many points that they still ended up beating the Bulgarians 250-230. </p><p> </p><p>Everyone was so tired from the days events that Fleur turned to Harry and said. "'Arry we are just going to head back to our tent, but I will make sure to come say goodbye to you before we leave tomorrow."</p><p>This made Harry a little said, but he didn't show it. "Okay Fleur, it was really nice meeting you and thank you again for getting these amazing seats for us I owe you one."</p><p> </p><p>Fleur blushes. "It waz nothing as I said earlier." She kisses his cheek again. "Goodbye 'Arry Potter." She leaves with her family.</p><p> Charlie smirks. "You have it so bad there Harry."</p><p>Harry blushes and mumbles. "Shut up Charlie. I do not." </p><p>The Weasley's just laugh and they start to make their way back to their tent.</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <strong>∞∞∞∞∞∞</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>A few hours later the Weasley's and Harry and Hermione were all inside their tent and cheering about the game when all the sudden loud noises could be heard coming from somewhere outside. </p><p>"Well the Irish have their pride on." Fred stated. </p><p>Mr. Weasley ran outside to check on what was going on and ran back into the tent looking as white as a ghost with a panicked expression on his face. "That's not the Irish, everyone get back to the portkey now!" They could all hear the worried tone coming from Mr. Weasley and they immediately did as they were told. </p><p> </p><p>Harry, Hermione, and Ron got separated from the rest of the group and then during the hysteria coming from the current situation, Harry then got separated from Hermione and Ron. </p><p>Harry was trying to run in the same direction as the rest of the crowd trying to relocate his friends when he heard a female scream that sent shivers down his spine, and he ran toward the noise without even thinking twice about it.</p><p> </p><p> When he got closer he saw Fleur and her sister being grabbed inappropriately and Harry could tell what this man's intentions were. He got enraged by this scene, then he ran and punched the male that was trying to attack her. "Fleur I'm coming." He yelled as loud as he could.</p><p> </p><p>"'Arry?" Fleur questioned before she was thrown to the ground roughly.</p><p>Harry was able to save Fleur and Gabrielle from this disgusting man however, before he could say anything to her to see if she was okay he was hit with a spell from somewhere and he was knocked unconscious.</p><p>When he awoke there were a couple of people surrounding him and he immediately spotted a familiar face from earlier. Jacques looks at him "Harry I am forever in your debt. Thank you for saving my daughters lives."</p><p> </p><p>Harry sat up and then slowly stood up and was completely dumbfounded as he did not know what was going on. "Jacques it was nothing I was just doing what anyone else would have done in the same situation."</p><p>Jacques is completely caught off guard by Harry's humble nation . "Now I have to disagree with you on that one Harry. Not many people would have done what you did especially when their own life was at stake."</p><p>Harry shrugs his shoulders. "My friends say I have a hero complex but I will always save those can't save themselves but can you please explain to me what you meant?"</p><p> </p><p>Jacques Delacour nodded his head in agreement. "You see Harry most people when put into an unknown situation decide to flee and go the other way. However, you were different and instead of running in the opposite direction like most people you decided to run head first without thinking right into a dangerous situation. Also, considering that my daughter Fleur is part Veela it only means a great deal more.</p><p> </p><p>Harry looks at him confused. "Okay well the last part is a little confusing, but I trust you."</p><p>Jacques chuckles a little at Harry's innocence. "More will be explained to you at another time but again I wanted to thank you, no words can describe how happy I am that you were here to save my daughters." He shook his hand and got out of the way, so his daughters could say thank you.</p><p>Fleur walked up to him and kissed him on the cheek again. "Thank you ‘Arry for saving me and my sister. I will see you soon and look for my owl pleaze I promize that I will write to you."</p><p>Fleur stepped aside so that her sister could say thank you to Harry as well. Gabrielle goes to Harry and hugs him. "Thank you for saving me 'Arry."</p><p>Harry hugs her back. "Anytime Gabrielle."</p><p>Fleur and Gabrielle waved him goodbye and they walked away with their father. </p><p> </p><p>Hermione ran up and hugged him tight. "Mione can you let go now I can't breathe"! Hermione let go. "I'm sorry, are you okay Harry? Ron and I tried to find you, but we couldn't get through the crowd."</p><p>Harry just chuckled to himself a little. "It's okay Mione and yes I am fine." After some questioning from some Auror's the gang was finally able to go home. </p><p> </p><p>The entire gang was immediately greeted by a very worried Mrs. Weasley. She ran to them and hugged them all tightly. "I am so happy that you are all safe". She cooked them all dinner and after helping cleanup they all went to bed because the next day they would all be under questioning by Mrs. Weasley.</p><p> </p><p>The next morning came by fast and everyone was called to the table for breakfast. Right before Mrs. Weasley was going to start the interrogation an owl flew in and landed on Harry's shoulder. Everyone was watching closely wondering whose owl it was.</p><p> </p><p>George looked at Harry and decided to ask the question that he knew everyone was dying to ask. "Who is that from Harry?" </p><p>Harry just blushes in response.</p><p>Ron answers for him. "It's probably from Fleur."</p><p>"Who is Fleur Harry dear?" Mrs. Weasley asked them.</p><p>Hermione looks at Ginny then at her before answering. "Harry saved her life at the World Cup."</p><p>Mrs. Weasley smiles wide. "That's my boy excellent job! Harry it looks like you have also gained someone's heart." Ginny was beyond jealous, Harry was hers and no one else's she would have her revenge.</p><p> </p><p>
