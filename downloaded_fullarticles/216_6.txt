    <p>Harry Potter feels like he’s burning up. His breath scalds his throat as it enters his lungs with each breath he takes, a deep, throbbing pain buried deep into his bones. The warm July air makes Harry’s hair stick to his forehead with sweat, his body overheating in nighttime heat. The Dursley’s, with their undying generosity, had confined Harry to the garden shed in the backyard after his nighttime thrashing had disturbed their beauty sleep. Harry’s nails bite deeply into the flesh of his palms at the thought, drawing blood as hot rage boils inside him. It makes him want to destroy, to burn everything around him to the ground only to turn back the clock and do it all over again. To go back in time to when Vernon was weak and helpless just like he is and- </p><p>He finds he can’t keep hold of the thought. His mind feels like it’s unravelling inside him, like a tapestry coming apart at the seams. Suddenly it’s like his feet have dropped out from under him, and he’s not quite sure who he is anymore, his identity a piece of Aunt Petunia’s glassware that’s shattered onto the floor.</p><p>Who is she, again? </p><p>
  <em> Allen Walker. </em>
</p><p>The words resound throughout his mind. A name, an identity, and he thinks surely this must be who he is.</p><p>But no. He’s- </p><p>
  <em> Allen Walker. </em>
</p><p>No, he’s not. He’s-</p><p>
  <em> Allen. Allen Walker. </em>
</p><p>The identity floods into him with all the force of a tsunami, unable to be fought or stopped. But the former identity is nothing if not stubborn, and when the force ceases, a bright spark of what once was remains. </p><p>Harry opens his eyes a few hours later feeling confused and disoriented. He sits up in a garden shed of all places, rubbing at his temples to try to relieve his headache. Then he blinks as everything clicks into place. Allen looks down at himself, his new body. He sighs, shaking his head a little. Being fourteen again will certainly be an experience. Then again, this body seems extremely malnourished, so perhaps he’s older than he thinks. </p><p>Clambering to his feet, he stops to take stock of himself. When he checks his left arm is indeed his Innocence, and with a touch to the left side of his face and an examination of his bangs he can conclude that his curse scar is also with him, and has once again blessed him with white hair. He appears to be in Noah form right now, but with a bit of concentration his grey skin bleeds to a deep brown.</p><p>He sure hopes that his host wasn't pasty pale before all of this. There would certainly be questions if that were the case. </p><p>Allen opens the door to the garden shed with why exactly he had been in there still a complete mystery to him, and steps out into the hush of early morning, the sky still dark above him, like a pool of deep water. He stumbles a bit as he walks out into the backyard of someone’s house, as he’s unused to this body as of yet. <em> Well, I suppose it’s best to leave before I get caught trespassing. </em> He thinks wryly. But then Allen blinks and looks up as he feels something painful pang in his chest at the thought of leaving this boringly unpleasant house, as if something is calling him there. </p><p>Returning to the garden shed allows him to requisition something serviceable for lock picking, and a minute and thirty seconds later the lock to the backdoor of the house clicks open, and Allen slips inside. He enters through the backdoor into a spotlessly cleaned kitchen, and this observation for some reason makes Allen both irritable and pleased at the same time. He feels an urge to climb up the stairs, and so he does so, avoiding each creaky step with ease. </p><p>By now he’s sure that he’s been here many times before; or rather, that his host has. That he probably even lived here. The thought makes him angry, the sadness and the guilt a heavy weight on his shoulders. Does his host have family here, whoever he used to be? Family who loved him, and are going to miss him when he’s gone? He peers through a doorway into a bedroom to find two middle aged adults sleeping soundly, one a severely overweight man and the other a woman that could be called homely at best. These could well be his host’s parents, but when he looks at the overweight man’s face all he can feel is a bone deep fear and a desperate need to please the man, to never <em> ever </em> make him angry. </p><p>For a moment Allen stands transfixed, caught in the emotions like a fly trapped in a web. Then he rips himself away from the doorway, taking a few stumbling steps down the hallway, breathing heavily with his head pounding like the beat of a drum. Shaking his head to clear it, he decides that leaving this place as soon as possible has become his next priority. Passing by another occupied room and not daring to look in to see what emotions this person might garner, he eyes the last room down the hall warily, thankfully empty. </p><p>Walking into the room on soundless feet, Allen’s sharp ears alert him to the sound of wings flapping through the air, and he turns. In the darkness of the bedroom a beautiful snowy owl alights on Allen’s shoulder, her talons digging lightly into his shirt, and her golden eyes look at him with an expression of wounded reproach. His throat closes up suddenly and he finds he has to swallow the lump in his throat, his eyes burning with unshed tears. He smiles wistfully, his heart full of love that may or may not be his own as he strokes the owl’s feathers. He almost <em> left her behind. </em>  </p><p>“I’m sorry, girl.” Allen apologizes, and the she-owl hoots reprovingly. He feels so much love, so much fondness and companionship for her, surely he can remember her name? </p><p>Searching the depths of his mind, he cocks his head at the she-owl and looks at her with uncertainty. “Hermoine?” The she-owl hoots, flapping her wings and pecking him on the shoulder, obviously quite offended. “No, Hedwig!” He says, suddenly certain. Hedwig hoots again, but it’s more of an offended huff. Allen strokes the feathers on her head to soothe both her and himself, the she-owl hooting and leaning into it with half-lidded eyes.</p><p>“Hey, Hedwig. How do you feel about getting out of this place?” Allen isn’t even sure if she’ll respond in any way. But she has so far, in a way that Allen can clearly understand. And General Nyne’s Innocence Lau Jimin is very intelligent, almost humanly so. Something is telling Allen that Hedwig is the same. </p><p>Hedwig launches herself off of Allen’s shoulder and grabs a lock of his hair in her beak, her talons hooking into his shirt as she tries to tug him towards the door, her wings buffeting his face as she hoots excitedly. Allen laughs. “Okay, we’re going.” He searches around the room for anything that might be of significance, but the only thing truly out of place is an odd wooden stick, and well, what would he need that for? He considers taking some of the oversized hand-me-downs with him, but eventually decides against it. He can buy different clothing later once he’s got some money in his pockets. He quickly acquires some by searching quietly around the house and pinching all the money that he can find, from a wallet to a cash jar to some kid’s piggy bank. He just wishes they weren’t all in this confusing paper money, instead of the gold/silver/copper exchange that he’s used to.</p><p>Hedwig starts making a fuss as they pass by a boot cupboard on their way out the front door, and Allen pauses at the door, feeling his skin crawl. A choking miasma of misery and fear lies locked and hidden behind that door, but Allen finds he can't deny her this. Swallowing down his fear, Allen takes out his makeshift lock picking set and starts in on the first lock. Five tense minutes later and the last padlock finally falls to the floor, several others laying at his feet.</p><p>What's in here, the secret to immortality?   </p><p>Tugging open the door, the first thing Allen sees is a trunk lying sprawled out in the small space, along with an owl cage and a… broom? But his eyes quickly stray to the walls, and his heart drops like a stone. </p><p><em> Harriet's room! </em> is written in bright green crayon on the walls, the 'i-e-t' in Harriet scribbled out with red crayon, replaced with a clumsy 'y'. There are children's pictures drawn on the walls in multiple colors of crayon, and wedged into the corner is a small… mattress. Horror climbs up Allen's throat, his spine prickling with the visceral fear of it. He finds he's yanking the trunk and broom out of the boot cupboard, making quite a lot of noise while he does so.</p><p>“<em> Boy </em>, what’s with all this racket?”</p><p>Allen looks up towards the top of the stairwell to see the overweight man looking down at him, and looking into his eyes Allen can't help but stutter as he says, “i-it's nothing,” <em> please, just go away. </em></p><p>But the light clicks on overhead, illuminating Allen and Hedwig clearly. The man looks surprised, and then his thick neck flushes with anger. “Are you trying to leave again, you <em> freak </em>?”</p><p>Allen's not sure how his host gained the moniker “freak,” but Allen's heard it enough times that it makes him more angry than scared for the word to be used so casually against him. He glares defiantly at the man. “Yes,” he declares.</p><p>And the man smiles, vindictively pleased. “Good. I don't care what those wizards say, if  you want to leave, I’m not going to stop you. Always stealing out clothes and taking the food right out of our mouths, putting us all at risk. Well, good riddance.”  </p><p><em> Wizards? </em> Allen wonders, even as he is being ungraciously shoved out the door with broom, trunk, and owl cage in hand, Hedwig hooting insults from her precarious perch on Allen's shoulder. Allen smooths a hand through her ruffled feathers and she calms, cocking her head to look at him before hooting softly, her golden eyes fond. Allen smiles softly at her as they pass under another streetlight, the light giving Hedwig’s feathers a white luminescence. Allen stops to examine his surroundings with a frown on his face, and notices that the road is lined with far more streetlights than it should be, the road too smooth and even beneath his feet with odd carriage-like devices standing still in the road, barren of horses. Allen wants badly to investigate, but logically he knows he needs to find somewhere safe to sleep for the night rather than find out just what sort of alternate universe he’s landed himself in. </p><p>He finds a bit of vindictive pride in the fact that that horrible man will soon be finding his wallet empty to Allen’s ministrations, and he can’t help but smile in satisfaction at the thought. Allen shivers, feeling suddenly cold. His breath fogs in the air, and Hedwig hoots and hunches in on herself. And then Allen is in the graveyard. Mana’s Akuma Skeleton looms over him, dark and ominous. “I curse you, Allen!” His knife arm comes down and then Allen is drowning, drowning in his own blood just as his body drops through the air and his neck snaps. Allen jolts, opening his eyes to see two cloaked and hooded figures that seem to absorb the darkness around them, drifting towards him in the distance, and with them come overwhelming tides of fear. </p><p>Allen activates his Innocence, sending a rush of warmth throughout his body and chasing back the chill in the air. He leaps at one of the dark hooded creatures, his four foot long metallic claws ripping a hole deep into its stomach while his white feathered cloak tears it to shreds with surprising ease. The creature gives a last dying rattle before its body fades and dissipates into nothing. A deathly rattle sounds from behind Allen, a dead and rotted hand gripping his shoulder hard enough to bruise. Allen’s cloak flares, and the creature screeches and the hand falls away. </p><p>Allen turns to face it, but he stumbles on a rock that had been lying in the middle of the road, silently cursing. The creature strikes lightning quick, grabbing hold of him with icy fingers and pulling them face. Allen stares into the depths of the hood and sees the darkness of the void inside, a darkness that absorbs all other darkness. Allen starts to feel faint, all the energy drained out of him as a rattling emerges from deep within the creature's throat. Some instinct inside him is screaming <em> danger danger danger </em>, and he knows he needs to do something fast before irreparable damage is done. Bringing up his left arm with all the force he can muster, he sinks his claws into the creature’s chest, tearing into it as he drags his imbedded claws down its body. His cloak slices and tears into it with a vengeance born of pure desperation. The rattling cuts off suddenly as the creature turns to wisps and then dissipates into nothing.</p><p>Allen falls to the ground amongst his things, only just now registering Hedwig’s screeching. Allen looks around a bit foggily, “He’wig?” There’s an owl’s screech from above, and then Hedwig practically dives into his arms, Allen quickly deactivating his Innocence so as not to harm her. He quickly notices that she’s hurt; her talons wounded and bloody and the feathers on her stomach broken and bleeding. Protective anger burns in Allen’s chest, and this emotion, at least, is his own. “Who did this to you, Hedwig?” He asks, holding her carefully against his chest so as not to harm her further. </p><p>Hedwig shoots him a scathing look, flapping her wings as if slightly affronted. Allen can almost imagine her saying,<em> I protected you, of course. Why do you think I would do anything else? </em></p><p>Allen smiles at her as if she had spoken and runs careful a careful finger down her spine. “Thank you, Hedwig.”</p><p>Hedwig puffs up proudly, even as she scolds, <em> well Merlin knows someone has to. You can hardly take care of yourself as it is.  </em></p><p>Allen’s eyes bug out of his head, because Hedwig had just talked to him. But before he can properly process that fact as well as reconcile with himself as to what exactly those things were, a hysterical woman bursts out from behind a house and comes bustling towards him with all the chastening and beratement of a woman who clearly thinks herself above the station of ‘old cat lady’. Allen’s sharp nose wrinkles at the overwhelming scent of cat and pee that pervades his nostrils. He had smelled it in the area before, but had just assumed that there were stray cats nearby.</p><p>“That Mundungus Fletcher, skimping off duty at a time like this! He’ll have some explaining to do, and frankly Harry so will you. Destroying Dementors…” The woman shakes her head and then abruptly grabs onto Allen’s left arm. “Well, you can explain yourself back at Order Headquarters.”</p><p>Hope flutters like a pack of butterflies inside Allen’s chest, and he parrots, “Order Headquarters?”</p><p>“The Order of the Phoenix, Harry. Though we must not discuss this right now. We must- Harry? Harry, come back here at once!”  </p><p>But Allen doesn’t stop. He runs like his life depends on his escape, the owl cage abandoned in the streets as he scoops up the trunk and broom with Hedwig clutched safely against his chest. His heart pounds, his breathing quick with his lungs burning and he vows to get this body some actual exercise because he was never this winded when making getaways before. He makes twists and turns down backstreets and winding alleyways, the darkness like an old friend as he calls for the Ark and he is gone, gone, <em> gone. </em></p>
