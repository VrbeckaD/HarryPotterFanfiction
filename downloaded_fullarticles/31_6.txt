    <p align="justify">Harry woke up with a gasp, side throbbing in pulses of pain. He had no idea where he was, but something kept him from freaking out, as if some kind of buffer was between him and the rest of the world. He moaned without meaning too; he was unbearably hot.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">A hand settled on his brow, gently rubbing along his eyebrows. Harry couldn’t open his eyes for more than a few seconds; everything was unbearably slow and confusing and –</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Hush, Harry,” Severus said, “you’ll be fine. I’m here.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Harry slept.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">--</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The next time he woke, the pain was worse. His mouth was dry. He tried to roll his head to the side and pain lanced through him; he whimpered.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Hush,” Severus said. Lips pressed down against his temple, but they weren’t Severus’s.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Tom,” Harry breathed out and a hand settled on his aching tummy, slowly rubbing in circles.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Harry slept again.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">--</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The time he woke after that, Harry was able to open his eyes. The lights were too bright for him, but they were quickly dimmed, and Severus quietly told him to try open them again. When Harry did, his gaze was automatically drawn down towards the injury, but he couldn’t see it; it was under some sort of privacy charm that Harry had never seen before.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Tom?” he asked, and Severus shook his head, lips thin.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Back at work,” he said, “you’ve been in for six days.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“What happened?” Harry asked. There was a low thrum of anxiety inside him, as if he had forgotten something big.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You were attacked,” Severus said and scooted closer, gently reaching out to stroke Harry’s hair away from his face.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I can’t remember,” Harry said; the anxiety grew, and Severus came even closer, a human shield between Harry and the rest of the world. It settled some of Harry’s nerves.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’ll tell you in a little while,” he promised, and Harry slept.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">--</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Tom looked unhappy when Harry woke up the next time. A healer came in and ran some tests on Harry, not taking away the privacy charm.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Did I lose my legs?” Harry joked; he could tell that it fell flat, but Tom gave him the ghost of a smile in response.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">There was a pull somewhere deep inside Harry; a pull that promised something frightening and horrifying.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I don’t feel good,” Harry said once the healer had left.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Tom came closer and sat at the edge of Harry’s bed and took his hand, playing with his fingers for a moment. Harry’s fingers looked naked without his ring, but the ring was with Tom, because Harry’s fingers were too swollen to wear it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“How so?” he asked quietly and it scared Harry; Tom was not usually this complacent when Harry got hurt.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Like there’s something – some thing inside me,” Harry said, and Tom breathed in deeply, blinking his eyes. Harry’s anxiety sky-rocketed; Tom didn’t cry.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You’ve been bitten,” he said in usual blunt way, “by two werewolves on the day of the full moon.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Harry tried to say something but there were no words.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“We have to wait until the next one to know for sure,” Tom said and then held Harry’s head up when he retched.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">--</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The wound was ugly and horrifying, stretched all the way from Harry’s second lowest rib to the very edge of his pelvis. The flesh had still not knit back together; the huge chunks they had ripped out of him were taking a long time to heal.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Parts of his guts had been regrown by the healers; his bladder had been ripped open. His kidney on the side of the injury had been torn and had regrown as well. Worst were the internal injuries he had suffered around his dick and that Harry could not feel any pressure or temperature on the skin directly surrounding the bites.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Severus’s fingertips were very gentle when he followed the shapes of them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I can’t feel my dick,” Harry said, and Severus looked up at him, face full of sorrow.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“They’re not sure you’re going to regain feeling there,” he said, and Harry closed his eyes, tears leaking out.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Please make it stop,” Harry begged, and Severus kissed him, kissed his closed eyelids, kissed the tears running down his cheeks, gently kissing them away.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I got you,” he promised, and Harry cried.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">--</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The first time Harry was allowed to try and take a shower, protection charms in full work around the injury to not aggravate it, he looked in the hospital mirror. Besides the wound there were other bruises on his body but for the first time he saw the clear finger prints on his hips, the mark of blunt human teeth on his neck.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They made him remember.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Tom had gone out to get a coffee; Severus was teaching at Hogwarts. Harry sat down at the edge of the tub and wept until the nurse came in and asked if he needed assistance. Then he got himself together, had his shower – he didn’t want his colleagues to see him in the state he was in; before he went to sit on his bed to wait for Tom.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Tom take one look at him before he floated the coffee away and rushed to Harry’s side.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Don’t,” Harry said, “I called Robards. I remember. You can’t – touch me. I will lose it. Please don’t.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Tom opened his mouth, but Harry shook his head desperately. “Later, please,” he begged, and Tom nodded, went over to where his coffee was still floating in the air and gave it to Harry.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Severus will kill you if he knows you gave me caffeine with all those potions,” he said, and Tom smiled. He wasn’t exactly hovering, was definitely doing Harry the favor of not comforting him but Harry knew he wouldn’t leave the room even if ordered.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The rest was anticlimactic; Robards came and brought Pritchett and Farrarbone with him. They took Harry’s statement; Tom raised a simply eyebrow at Robards when he was asked to leave. Robards visibly blanched and Tom remained in his corner, watching them silently.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Harry,” Robards said at the end, “we have nothing but respect for you, but you know the regulations regarding werewolves in the force.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Harry swallowed; Tom watched.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“We don’t know yet if I was turned,” Harry said with some difficulty. Deep inside he knew he knew.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Come see me once you know,” Robards said, “paid leave until then. I hope you’re feeling better soon.” Harry nodded at them when they left.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The door closed. Harry couldn’t look at Tom for another moment and Tom got up and got closer until he could lift Harry’s chin with a finger.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“They won’t walk away,” he said, eyes a dark storm of hate and revenge. Harry dropped his head on Tom’s shoulder and kept breathing; just breathing.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">--</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">He was alone. It was the middle of the night and they didn’t usually sleep with him whenever he stayed at St. Mungo’s; but Harry had never been hurt like this and it was the middle of the night and he was turning into a monster and they had taken turns watching over him while he slept, shushing Harry whenever he said they needed rest or work. Not tonight though; tonight, Harry was alone.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">He tried to sit it out; tried not to cry for help. He fought against himself for such a long time but when he looked at the watch again only 20 minutes had passed.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">He cried; he hyperventilated. Nobody came. He didn’t know where his wand was; probably with Tom. He tried calling out, but his voice was too weak. He cried more; his face was so wet. They weren’t there.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The door opened 10 minutes later; Tom came in first. “Harry?” he said and then immediately cast lumos and within a second, he was on the bed beside Harry, hugging him. “It’s okay,” he said. Severus was doing something, but Harry couldn’t lift his head from where he sat gasping against Tom’s chest.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Nightmare,” Tom said to Severus, “he’s fine.” Severus answered something Harry couldn’t hear; Tom kept stroking through his hair.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“He’s not supposed to sit up like this,” Severus said; the hand he had on Harry’s shoulder turned insistent. “Lay down, Harry.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“No,” Harry said and gripped Tom’s shirt, balled up the expensive fabric.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yes,” Tom answered and leaned them down, hunching over to not let go of Harry. The wound pulsed; everything directly around it Harry could still not feel.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Severus was looking at it, picking up something to clean parts of it. Harry had by now grown extremely squeamish of it, couldn’t look at it at all without having a panic attack. Tom, he had noticed, also prevented directly dealing with his wound though Harry doubted that he would ever admit feeling sick at the sight of it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Tom,” he said again; he wasn’t sure why. Tom’s hands gentled him. Harry turned his head a little to breathe him in more deeply. The bed dipped by his uninjured side and Severus’s hand touched Harry’s neck after a moment, resting over his pulse point.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’m sorry,” Harry said.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Don’t be,” Severus said. “I don’t mind taking care of you,” Tom said at the same time. Harry shivered and pressed closer until he was drowsy and shifted off to sleep.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">--</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Three days before the full moon, the last bite of Harry’s injury closed. He also got an infection and a forty-degree fever.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It was Severus with him, once again. Tom had barely stopped by that week. Apparently the brain room was melting. Harry had no idea what the brain room was, but Tom appeared flustered by it and anything with the ability to fluster Tom was potentially very bad.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Harry had spent much of his fourth week at St. Mungo’s by himself. He had had some physical therapy and mostly continued to wait for the bites to fully close up. He had contemplated asking Hermione or Ron stop by, but Ron worked at St. Mungo’s and hadn’t come to see Harry and the ball of sadness in Harry’s chest whenever he thought about it had prevented him from owling either one of them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They hadn’t really talked since he had gotten together with Tom and shortly after with Severus and Harry missed them, but he was also angry; it was complicated.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">All that kept him company was one of Tom’s shirts and an array of funny little missives out of the brain room. St. Mungo’s staff frowned at his owl coming directly into his room, but sometimes it paid to be married to one of the administration’s most mysterious and feared man.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You don’t have to stay,” Harry told Severus when the nurses rolled out the anti-inflammation potions. Severus had studied their labels with a rather grim look on his face and he jerked around sharply when Harry spoke.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’m not leaving you with a fever and completely defenseless three days before the full moon,” he hissed and went back to studying his label.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’ll be fine,” Harry tried, “you’ve been here all the time. Go home and get some sleep.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I don’t sleep,” Severus answered absent-mindedly.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Then get some work done,” Harry said and yawned. He was cold and shivery, and the blanket gave him not enough heat.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Cut it out, Harry,” Severus said and came over towards him, resting his hand on Harry’s forehead. “You must know that I care for that fever of yours as little as I care for any first-year potion’s essay,” he said quietly, and Harry breathed him in.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Why is Ron not stopping by?” he asked in that same quiet voice and Severus rubbed his nose against Harry’s cheek.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“A million reasons,” he said, “that all start with he’s a treacherous excuse of a friend and end with you are better off not dwelling on why people stop liking you because of your choice of partners, because you must recognize that you must either reform your choice of partners or your choice of friends and both makes you maudlin.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’m maudlin,” Harry agreed, “Tom’s not here.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Tom is fighting brains,” Severus said, “and very soon me if you continue being sad about it. Rest would do you some good.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You’ve been so nice to me,” Harry said, “no telling me I am an imp with two braincells in the last four weeks. It feels weird.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“We’re trying very hard for normalcy, Harry,” Severus said, “but you also managed to be chewed up like a dog toy. I never want to see you again in the state you’ve been in.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Am I going to ever go back to work?” Harry asked which was an euphemism but Harry couldn’t ask about the wolf.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I make a point of not lying to you,” Severus said which was an euphemism for not wanting to answer.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’ll be fine if you want to go,” Harry said sleepily again.</p><p align="justify"><br/>“I’m right where I should be,” Severus answered and smoothed back his hair.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">--</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Harry burned.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They had tied him down inside a fortified and warded room. The shift was likely to reopen his injury but there was nothing to stop him from shifting, no potion or spell or magic in the world. It was still three hours until the moon would rise, but Harry knew; they all knew. The healers were to wait outside; St. Mungo’s security had been sent in and withdrawn again when Tom had heard that they were supposed to stun Harry if he managed to escape the shackles or the binding spells or the weird shimmering glow that Tom had drawn around him. He had explained what he had been doing but Harry had only listened to the sound of his voice not his actual words and then only started listening to his actual words when he had ordered security away. Harry knew that tone of voice and he was worried, but he was also too far gone already to tell Tom that he would be very mad about any kind of murder.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The wound was already bleeding as if it knew what was to come. Harry could barely hold still; his muscles flexed and itched and twitched and Tom kept saying “stop twitching” and “Harry, I’m begging you” and Harry couldn’t stop. Something kept Severus at Hogwarts, but Harry couldn’t listen to Tom telling him what.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When the moon rose, Harry howled.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It was unlike anything he had ever felt. It was indescribable. It felt like breaking open, felt like being ripped apart while his consciousness hovered elsewhere. He felt himself losing all control until all he wanted was to sink his teeth into Tom’s hands holding him down. Then he forgot all sense of Harry or Tom; all he wanted was to rip apart the hands holding him down, was to escape, was to –</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Then he lost all sense of thinking and enraged, he howled.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When he came back to himself, his head was on Tom’s shoulder, his upper body resting on Tom’s chest. They were in some kind of bath that wasn’t filled with water but some sticky steam. It felt very weird, but also weightless and comforting. Everything felt dull but beyond the dullness Harry could sense an immeasurable amount of pain and exhaustion. Tom’s hand was on his forehead, keeping him steady. Tom’s other hand was holding him around the ribcage, keeping him close. Severus was sitting outside the tub, gently scooping and stirring the steam.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I don’t want it,” Harry mumbled. Tom didn’t answer, but Harry felt his voice in his head anyway, telling him that he was safe and loved and that it would be fine.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I want to go home,” Harry whispered. “Soon, Harry,” Severus said quietly. Tom hugged him a little closer.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Please keep wanting me,” Harry said. He hadn’t meant to, but he had worried. Severus had always strongly disliked Remus. Tom had never voiced any particular problem with werewolves, but he also thought them to be ruled by their emotions.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Severus laughed. Tom sighed. “You infuriate me,” he said, “we promised until death.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“But Severus didn’t,” Harry said. They had discussed it back then, but Tom and Severus ruled it out, didn’t want the complications of openly living in a relationship with three people. “I’d prefer to remain untethered anyway,” Severus had said, and Harry knew that it was true, that Severus preferred to see them occasionally over seeing them all the time. Out of Tom’s childhood an addiction had grown to take care of the very few people he trusted himself to love and out of Harry’s childhood an addiction to being taken care of had grown. Out of Severus’s childhood, however, an ultimate will had grown to not ever depend on anyone but himself and that will could not easily be pressed down into domestic life. It had never been an issue but a perfect fit but now Harry worried.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You’re not scared?” Harry asked, just to be sure.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Until death, Harry,” Tom said, “and now sleep.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And Harry slept.</p><p align="justify"> </p>
