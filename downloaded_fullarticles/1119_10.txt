  <b>TAMING GRANGER</b>
</p><p> </p><p>There was a moment of fraught silence as Draco stared back at the two bumbling twits. They seemed unable to decide who should speak first and it wasn’t until Draco lifted a waiting palm in their direction with a pointed glare that Weasley finally slapped Potter on the back and the words came tumbling out. </p><p> </p><p>“Well, the problem is that Ron and Ginny’s dad is a bit old fashioned—” </p><p> </p><p>Weasley snorted, leaning back in his chair with a huff. “Old fashioned? Mate, he’s medieval.” </p><p> </p><p>“Right,” Potter continued, winching behind his smudged glasses. <em> Ugh. </em> These two made his stomach churn. “Well, the rule is that Ginny—Ron’s sister—can’t go to the Yule Ball unless Hermione does.” </p><p> </p><p>Draco’s eyes darted between them, still waiting for the part that had anything at all to do with him. There was an air of panic about Potter and against his volition, Draco’s lips turned down in a disgusted sneer. Weren’t they supposed to be bloody Gryffindors?</p><p> </p><p>“You’re boring me.” With a dismissive wave of his hand, Draco’s eyes floated across the hall, his gaze settling on the two witches in question. </p><p> </p><p>Ginny was quite fit; she played a fair bit of Quidditch, and she wasn’t half bad at it either. She was all long lean legs and her arse was decent. She did sport that gods-awful ginger hair and her freckles were quite distracting, but she was definitely shaggable.</p><p> </p><p>But, Granger. Merlin, that witch was downright terrifying. It’s not that she wasn’t equally fit, some might argue <em> more </em> fit, but the girl was a wreck. Not only was she insufferable as a fellow classmate, but she was also quite nearly the driving force behind the rest of the school remaining celebate. Oh, she loved to march around the school with her little Head Girl badge pinned to her chest, ripping apart broom cupboards and docking points from any couple seen canoodling. </p><p> </p><p>In the worst possible way, the girl was a witch. </p><p> </p><p>It was Weasley to finally grab the reins and steer the old Hippogriff home as Draco yawned and rested his elbow on the empty chair beside him, lolling his head back in their direction. “We need your help,” he blurted and Draco’s features pinched. </p><p> </p><p>“Help with what? I’m not going to date Gin—”</p><p> </p><p>“<em> No!” </em> Potter interjected forcefully, his palm slapping on the table between them. “Not Ginny. That’s—no. We need you to date Hermione.” </p><p> </p><p>Draco’s gaze wandered again through the Great Hall, landing on the witch in question again. She had a serious pout to her lips as she read through the days’ course material—of which Draco would bet a pretty galleon she’d already memorized—and when someone reached past her to grab a scone, she swatted violently at their wrist without looking up to see who it was. </p><p> </p><p>She’d earned the name “Dragon Queen” and it had nothing to with her royal stature and everything to do with the fact that she was a complete shrew. There had been some rumblings early on of her with a bloke the year up, McLaggen, if he remembered correctly. And very shortly after their sordid little love affair fizzled, the whispers began circulating. Not that Draco cared much for such things, but he wasn’t about to waltz into the Dragon’s den and ask to be set on fire, was he?</p><p> </p><p>With a loud, indignant huff Draco pushed back from the Slytherin table and retrieved his bag. “You’re both barking.” He made it barely a few steps before they were clamoring to his side as he marched from the Great Hall. “Why on earth would you want me to try and date Hermione Granger? She’s a wreck. I don’t walk the same halls if I can avoid it.” </p><p> </p><p>“Well, that’s where it gets complicated…” Potters cheeks darkened and damnit all, but Draco was curious. He stopped on his heel, crossing his arms across his chest as he waited. “You see, Hermione… she’s particular. That’s why she doesn’t date much, never has.” </p><p> </p><p>“You’re her friend, Weasley. <em> You </em> date her.” Draco smirked, his jerking smugly to the side as he waited for a weak rebuttal.</p><p> </p><p>“First—<em> ew </em>. She’s like my sister. Second, I’m not her type.” Ron and Harry both shared a purposeful look before turning back to Draco. “She likes blonds.” </p><p> </p><p>There it was again, that long painful beat of silence as the three of them stared blankly at each other. The first bubble of laughter past Draco’s lips caught him by surprise, but the following guffaws that tore a stitch in his side completely overwhelmed him. </p><p> </p><p>The Dragon Queen preferred herself a blond, did she? Oh, it was just too good. As his laughter subsided and he righted himself to stare back at the two little twits, he let out a final long breath. “I’m not the only blond—though, I admit, I am the best looking.” </p><p> </p><p>“Well, Hermione can be a little…<em> tough. </em> We think you have the least likely chance of being frightened away by her and actually succeeding in getting her on a date. I want to take Ginny to the Yule and there’s no way in hell that’s happening unless Hermione goes with someone too.” </p><p> </p><p>Draco thought about it, truly he did. But the chances of his bollocks ending up in a jar with lime green fluid surrounding them was too great. “Sorry, boys. Find yourself another sacrifice.” </p><p> </p><p>Pushing between their shoulders, Draco made his way towards Potions, a class where Miss Dragon Queen herself would be present. </p><p> </p><p>“We can pay!” Harry shouted at his back and that earned a wry smile from Draco as he turned, never missing a step as he retreated backward down the hall. </p><p> </p><p>“If you think I need the money, you’re dimmer than I thought, Potter!” Righting his step, he shook his head, considering the ridiculous idea that he, Draco Malfoy and the scariest witch at Hogwarts, Hermione Granger, might end up together. It was too preposterous to even consider. </p><p> </p><p align="center">xXx</p><p> </p><p>The problem was that she was actually quite pretty. Draco found the longer he looked at her, the more he enjoyed the smattering of freckles along the bridge of her nose and he could suppose her hair wasn’t quite as awful as it’d been in their formative years. But, there was still an air of superiority that bothered him to no end. </p><p> </p><p>The way she stood at her potions desk with her nose tilted in the air and her back perfectly straight; it was infuriating. But her arse looked like you could probably bounce a sickle off it and every time she leaned for another ingredient her prim little skirt rode up the back of her thighs. </p><p> </p><p>It would be quite the challenge, and Draco found his seventh year entirely too boring. Merlin, if he was the one to tame the Dragon Queen? He’d be an absolute legend. </p><p> </p><p>Granger must have felt the weight of his stare because suddenly she whipped her face around and glared at him. Feeling a bit cheeky, Draco fluttered his eye closed in a wink. Her lip curled in a scowl and she rolled her eyes as she returned to her work. </p><p> </p><p>Well, that settled that. Draco Malfoy was going to seduce Hermione Granger. </p><p> </p><p align="center">xXx</p><p> </p><p>“Potter! Weasley!” </p><p> </p><p>The pair of them stopped mid-step, sharing a nervous look before turning over their shoulders in tandem. Draco couldn’t help the slow smirk spreading over his features as he approached them, fully enjoying the terror laced in their features. </p><p> </p><p>“It’s your lucky day dimwits. I’ve decided it’s in my best interest to comply with your request.” Truthfully, he could do it on his own without these fools but everything was better with an audience. Besides, if he let them believe it was a favor to them, he could easily reap the rewards. </p><p> </p><p>“You—<em> you will?” </em>Potter asked, his brow pinched in his suspicion. “Why?”</p><p> </p><p>Draco waved a dismissive hand through the air. “That’s not important. It’s important that I’m going to and you two will be my cronies until the Yule.”</p><p> </p><p>“Cronies?” Weasley said slowly, his lips exaggerating every syllable. </p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, you know. Wash my cauldrons, brush my broom, whatever I want.” Adjusting the strap on his bag, Draco canted his head to the side and a crooked smile pulled at his lips. “You’ll do it.”  </p><p> </p><p>Weasley seemed apprehensive, his hand dragging through his overgrown hair nervously but Potter was all too eager, quickly blurting, “Deal!”</p><p> </p><p>A wicked smile formed on Draco’s lips and lifted his bag from his shoulders and held it between the three of them. “Brilliant. Take this down to the dungeons, would you? I’ve got practice.”  There was a delicious joy knotting in Draco’s belly as Potter frowned and reached for the strap, securing it over his own. “Later, boys!”</p><p> </p><p align="center">xXx</p><p> </p><p>The library was mostly deserted. Only a few seats were taken and one of them by the object of his desire, Miss Granger, herself. Straightening his spine, he pushed his wet, freshly showered locks of hair back from his forehead and crossed the library to the table in the back that she was occupying. </p><p> </p><p>He stood for quite some time, waiting for her to look up and acknowledge his sudden appearance, but her gaze remained firmly on her parchment, flickering only briefly to the tome to her left before back to her neat pen ship again. </p><p> </p><p>After an obscenely long wait, Draco scowled and decided to concede. “Hey, Gr—”</p><p> </p><p>“No.” </p><p> </p><p>Draco’s head cocked back as if he’d been slapped. The infuriating little witch still hadn’t even looked up from her parchments yet. “What do you <em> mean </em> no? You haven’t heard what I was about to say.” </p><p> </p><p>Granger loosened a long, exaggerated sigh as she dipped the tip of her quill into her inkpot. “I can say with full confidence the answer is no.” </p><p> </p><p>“What if it wasn’t a question?” Draco snorted, dropping his bag into the chair. “What if I was just saying hi?”</p><p> </p><p>This earned her attention—<em> finally. </em> Her squinted, chocolate-coloured eyes lifted to his, a frown curling her lips downward. “Draco Malfoy, I’ve been going to school with you for six and a half years. I have shared more classes than I can count, done prefect duties with you and even on one occasion, to no fault of my own, had to serve detention with you. In all that time you’ve never come up to just say <em> hi. </em>”</p><p> </p><p>Draco’s lips parted, ready to retort, but she gave him not a moment, instead continuing on her judgmental little tyrant before he could a word in edgewise. </p><p> </p><p>“This leads me to only conclusion: you are up to no good. And I don’t have time to fuss with your nonsensical business as I’m currently studying for my N.E.W.T.s. So if you please—”</p><p> </p><p>“N.E.W.T.s? Those aren’t until the spring.” </p><p> </p><p>Rolling her eyes, Granger brought her attention deftly back to the work in front of her. “You sound just like Harry and Ron—just like everyone, really. There is a reason why I excel at academia, and that is because I take it very seriously. I don’t brush it off until the last minute like the rest of you.” </p><p> </p><p>Draco’s ego felt the punch and he huffed his indignation. “Hey! You forgetting who’s number two in our year?” </p><p> </p><p>Another sharp glare from Granger, her lips quirking up in a wicked teasing smile. “Are you forgetting who’s number one?”</p><p> </p><p>Without any control of the matter, Draco’s lips curled back into a snarl and he yanked his bag up and stormed from the library. </p><p> </p><p>Merlin, he hated Hermione Granger. </p><p> </p><p align="center">xXx</p><p> </p><p>Advanced Astronomy was a fucking joke. But when Draco had first been presented with his course options for seventh year, he found he needed to fill his schedule with at least two more requisite classes. Astronomy had been an easy choice there; the lectures were droll and the practical portion of the class happened only once a month. </p><p> </p><p>It was mostly full of other students in his similar position, peers who wanted a slack class during the final year. After all, it’s not like any of them were going to go on to be Astronomers. But not Granger. </p><p> </p><p>No, the little swot had her hand in the air during every lecture, was there in the Astronomy tower before anyone else for each and every nightly observation. Add it to the list of reasons he thought Hermione Granger was a nuisance. </p><p> </p><p>“For the next few weeks, until term breaks for the holidays, you will be working in pairs. Your Midterm will be to submit the track the night sky on your assigned night. I will expect twelve inches on your findings, specifically any orbital anomaly, as well as your charts. Let’s pair up!” Professor Sinistra clapped her hands and returned to the blackboard as the students began making meaningful eye contact with each other in hopes of securing a friendly partner. </p><p> </p><p>Draco would have none of that. Without thinking of what a complete and utter fool he looked like, he rushed across the classroom and quickly claimed the seat next to Granger. He was actually fucking panting as he took his seat, meeting her wide curious expression with a horrified one. </p><p> </p><p>Everyone in the class was staring at them. </p><p> </p><p>“Hello, Granger,” he managed through his huffs. “Partners?”</p><p> </p><p>Her eyes narrowed. “<em> No. </em>”</p><p> </p><p>Thankfully, everyone had since seemed to couple up, taking new seats and lifting their books from their bags. </p><p> </p><p>Professor Sinistra turned, her eyes landing on the two of them and widening in disbelief.  With a small shrug, she turned and started on the far side of the room. Pointing to each pairing and assigning them a night to track. When she reached their table,  she announced that the pair of them would be taking Friday night. </p><p> </p><p>Draco’s mouth fell open to protest but Granger beat him to it. “If you’d prefer to switch partners, that’s perfectly fine. I wouldn’t want to interrupt your social life with something of actual importance.” </p><p> </p><p>Mashing his lips shut, Draco turned to the little swot at his left. “Nope.” His lips popping at the <em> p </em>. “Why wouldn’t I want to spend my Friday night with you, Granger? You’re a lovely companion, such an absolute joy to be around.” </p><p> </p><p>With an obscene roll of his eyes, he turned back to the front of the classroom. The Astronomy Professor continued on, explaining the project in further detail but Draco could hardly focus. All he could think of was how much Granger drove him nuts and how poorly he was doing at seducing her. If anything he was doing a brilliant job at making her despise him even more. After Sinistra dismissed them for the day, Granger began quickly gathering her thing and shoving them into her bag. </p><p> </p><p>“Last chance to back out, Malfoy. And you should know I have no intention of doing all the work, which I’m sure is why you rushed to this seat in particular. If you think this is going to be an easy ‘O’, well, you have another thing coming.” </p><p> </p><p>His brow knitted as she wore on. What a twit. Like he couldn’t easily manage an ‘O’ all on his own. But he thought twice on it, biting on the inside of his cheek. He was meant to be seducing her not infuriating her. </p><p> </p><p>“Granger, I have no intention of having you do all the work. I just wanted to work with you.” </p><p> </p><p>She pulled a face. “So, we’ll meet in the Astronomy Tower at nine? I’ll bring our texts and charts—”</p><p> </p><p>“Why don’t I swing by your tower and pick you up first? I can escort you.” The words had tumbled out of his mouth before he could think them properly and they both stilled at the thought. </p><p> </p><p>“Um, no,” Granger said, shaking her head and rising to stand. “That won’t be necessary. I’ll see you Friday, Malfoy.” </p><p> </p><p>She turned, already halfway up the aisle before he turned quickly in his seat and called after her. “Maybe before then, if I’m lucky.” </p><p> </p><p>Granger froze, her entire body tensing as she managed a short look over her shoulder. She said nothing in return, her gaze darkening for a brief moment before she resumed her step and walked straight out of the classroom. </p><p> </p><p align="center">xXx</p><p> </p><p>Throughout the week, Draco had attempted several times to place himself in Granger’s path. He took up space at her favorite desk in the library, bumped into her outside Herbology, even offered to care the witch’s bag from Potions but each and every time he was met with her icy exterior. </p><p> </p><p>Merlin, she was a hard witch to woo. </p><p> </p><p>Friday came and while he spent the day enjoying the lingering crispness of Autumn, he found himself dreading the long night ahead in the Astronomy Tower. </p><p> </p><p>As he made his way up the stairs, a portrait swung open and a mess of curls hiding behind a thick book came storming out, barrelling into him and sending them both tumbling to the stone floor. </p><p> </p><p>“Fuck!” he groaned, as an elbow crushed his sternum. He blinked up, wheezing out a breath as he took in the witch tangled around him. “<em> Granger </em>?” </p><p> </p><p>Her curls created a canopy around them and Salazar, help him but she was soft and warm pressed against his body that for the briefest moment he almost forgot who it was. Almost. Because she growled and as she got up her knee was far too rough between his thighs, nicking him in the balls. With a strangled groan, he rolled onto his side. </p><p> </p><p>“Draco Malfoy, I told you not to come here! I don’t need an escort,” she said forcefully, stomping her little foot into the space next to his head. </p><p> </p><p>“First,” he began, still lying on the ground. “I can see up your skirt.”  With a wild shriek, she kicked at him with the toe of her shoe and he let out a low laugh, rushing to his feet. “Second, I didn’t stop here for you. I was walking by and was unwittingly tackled by you. But, since I’m here, shall we?”</p><p> </p><p>Draco stepped to the side, lifting his bag back onto his shoulder and gesturing up the stairs. She seemed to mull it over, wanting to turn him down just for the hell of it while simultaneously knowing that they are walking in the exact same direction. </p><p> </p><p>“Fine,” she breathed, rolling her eyes and yanking her bag off the ground. </p><p> </p><p>They walked in silence, Draco just a few steps behind and Granger with her face still buried in her book. He couldn’t help but stare at her. She was quite lovely when she wasn’t sneering, pretty, even. When had Hermione Granger gone and gotten herself pretty? </p><p> </p><p>There’d been a few moments where she’d caught his eye; the Yule ball fourth year had nearly the entire castle talking. But now, without the angry wrinkle in her brow, he was pretty sure that Granger was quite possibly the most beautiful girl in their year.</p><p> </p><p>Her gaze flickered to him, the wrinkle returning when she found him staring at her. Loosening a low breath, she returned her attention to her book. “Stop looking at me, Malfoy.” </p><p> </p><p>The truth rushed to his lips, and he almost stopped himself from speaking it. But then, all his other attempts to woo her had fallen flat. “You’re beautiful.” </p><p> </p><p>She turned quickly, the snap of her book echoing around the empty corridor. “What are you doing? You haven’t paid me any attention for years and now, for some reason, I can’t rid myself of you! You’re always around. Always looking at me and saying things that I can’t bring myself to believe you actually think. So what’s going on?”</p><p> </p><p>Draco smirked, taking a step towards her until he was dangerously in her space. “I guess you could say I’m seeing things with a new perspective. And you’re one of those things.” His gaze scoured her face, the edges of his eyes crinkling as his smirk widened. </p><p> </p><p>Her breath hitched, her own gaze flickering to his full lips before hardening into a scowl. “I don’t trust you, Malfoy. Let’s just get done with this project and we can go back to ignoring each other like we always have. Deal?”</p><p> </p><p><em> Fat chance, Granger. </em> The more she fought his attention the more he desperately wanted to gain it. “After you.” He jerked his chin back in the direction of the Astronomy Tower and after a final hard glare, she turned. </p><p> </p><p>Tucking his chin into his chest, he chuckled lowly and stared up at her through his lashes. Granger sure wasn’t going to be making this easy on him. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">
