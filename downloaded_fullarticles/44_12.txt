    <p>September 1st was turning out to be a gray and overcast - even somber - day, a touch chilly even given the time of year, and an equally somber Hermione Granger was approaching the passageway to Platform 9 ¾ with an almost melancholy expression etched into her features.</p>
<p>Thoughts of the upcoming school year were only a small part of the myriad that were swirling around in the witch’s mind, her mind constantly switching between school and her best friends and the upcoming war and Merlin only knew what else, though she pushed those to the side as she stepped through the barrier and looked around, noticing a group of redheads - and one tall, black haired boy among them - her melancholy lifting and a grin replacing the hint of a frown as she pushed her way over to join her second family.</p>
<p>A chorus of ‘Hello Hermione!’ went up as the Weasley’s took notice of her, though Hermione noticed it took Harry a moment to say anything, almost as if he’d been so lost in thought that he wasn’t aware of what was going on around him.</p>
<p><i>That could spell trouble… </i>She thought to herself.</p>
<p>“All right you lot, onto the train. They’re finishing up boarding now!” Mrs. Weasley chimed in, giving a hug to Ron, Ginny, Harry and then Hermione before shooing them away, standing off to the side as she wiped away a smattering of tears with a handkerchief she’d pulled out of one of her pockets.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the Trio was able to find an empty compartment - Ginny had wandered off to find her own friends - and the conversation between the group soon turned to the thoughts that had been plaguing Hermione all summer.</p>
<p>“...how are you holding up, Harry?” Hermione posed, absently petting Crookshanks as he purred happily in her lap.</p>
<p>“I’m done with the Dursley’s at least.” He finally replied a moment later, his eyes dry but there was something lingering in the emerald orbs that had Hermione narrowing her eyes slightly.</p>
<p>
  <i>Oh yes, definitely trouble.</i>
</p>
<p>“I’ve been owling back and forth with Dumbledore all summer. It turns out that the locket we found a few months back wasn’t the real thing. Someone had switched it.”</p>
<p>“So you went through all of that for nothing?” Hermione’s eyes narrowed further at that, another piece of the puzzle they’d been working on developing yet another curve that didn’t fit in anywhere else.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t say nothing…” Harry started to reply, though he was cut off from saying anything further by the arrival of the Sweets Cart, and by the time he and Ron had loaded up, the moment to press on had passed, and the boys began a lively discussion on Quidditch that had Hermione rolling her eyes and turning her attention to one of her Arithmancy texts.</p>
<p>By the time the train pulled into the Hogsmeade station, the storm that had been threatening all day had finally broken, and with the exception of the First Years who were led towards the boats by a soaking wet Hagrid, everyone began making a mad dash towards the carriages, casting drying and warming spells on themselves once safely ensconced inside.</p>
<p>It wasn’t long before they all arrived at the Castle, passing by a huddled and shivering group of First Years who were being dried and warmed by Madam Pomfrey and Professor Flitwick while everyone else filed past to enter the Great Hall.</p>
<p>It was upon entering that everyone realized things had gone a bit wonky.</p>
<p>There, stretched out from one end to the other, were not four House tables, but five, the fifth one having just a simple black banner hanging overhead with no indication as to what it’s purpose was.</p>
<p>Murmurs soon broke out among the students as they took their seats at their usual tables, the conversations obviously revolving around the newest addition, though before anyone could start posing any serious theories as to its purpose, they were silenced when Dumbledore rose to his feet and approached his podium, clearing his throat once before he quietly began to speak.</p>
<p>“Welcome, welcome, students. While normally this is the part of the night where we bring in the First Years and begin the Sorting Ceremony, this year, we must conduct business a bit differently. By now, I am sure that you all have noticed the presence of the fifth table here in the Great Hall. While I’m sure there are those among you who are under the belief that we are perhaps playing host to another school this year, rest assured that this is not the case.”</p>
<p>Dumbledore heaved a sigh then before coming out from around his podium and standing before it, his hands loosely clasped in front of him as he cast his eyes out over the assembled, seemingly giving each and every student a careful and pointed glance before moving on to the next.</p>
<p>“It has never been publicly made known that the four founders of Hogwarts were actually not the only ones. A fifth - largely silent - partner was also responsible for its creation, though Isadora Avila never wanted her name to always be associated with the school. Instead, it was agreed upon by all parties that her name - and indeed, her House - would only appear during times of great strife in the Wizarding World. I need not remind you of the many perils that may be looming on the horizon, my children.”</p>
<p>He paused again then before turning his gaze towards the entrance doors where McGonagall was leading in the first years and instructing them to line up at the back of the room before she made her way up the front and retrieved the Sorting Hat and stool.</p>
<p>“This year, instead of merely sorting the First Years, we must also re-sort some of the students who have already pledged their loyalty to another House. In just a moment, the Sorting Hat will begin calling out the names of previous students, and you will be asked to come forward and once more slip on the Hat. Please note that, while your name may be called, there is certainly no guarantee that you will be moving on to Avila. If you are not, you will be returned to the House from whence you came. This does not mean you are unworthy, but merely that where you are now is where you are most needed.”</p>
<p>Without another word, he stepped back and moved to reclaim his seat while Professor McGonagall moved forward to stand by the Hat’s side, her back seemingly stiffer than usual as everyone awaited the Hat’s first name call.</p>
<p>“Granger, Hermione!”</p>
<p>And that was when everything changed.</p>
