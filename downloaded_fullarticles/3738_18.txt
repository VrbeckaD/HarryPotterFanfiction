    <p>Harry loves when Newt brings home new creatures, especially when he builds them a whole new habitat. He loves watching the concentrated movements of Newt’s wand as he creates transfigures paper into rocks and plants saplings which will eventually grow into trees and plants native to the creature’s original home. He also likes it a lot when Newt trusts him to help the new creature settle in. Usually, Harry gets along well with them because he’s been there and he understands that it’s pretty scary at first. But Newt has a uniquely calming presence and Harry knows that the new addition will come to trust him eventually.</p><p>They’ve been waiting for the basilisk egg to hatch for weeks now. Newt had rescued it from the poachers who killed its mother.</p><p>“I don’t think it will have the power to kill with its gaze since we got it away from those poachers before it hatched,” Newt had explained when Harry had asked why he’d placed the egg in the occamy nest. “But I can’t be sure and it’s never wise to make assumptions. Occamies don’t like assumptions either, you know. I’m hoping they’ll be able to convince the little creature not to develop that particular ability because it would be extremely inconvenient.”</p><p>Harry had nodded like he understood.</p><p>Now, Harry watches the egg shiver and crack and he feels every muscle in his body tense with anticipation. He’s about to call for Newt when the man in question practically falls out of the sky. Judging by his scorched shirt, Harry can only assume he’s been with Nora. The norwegian ridgeback dragon had just laid several eggs and had become extremely territorial and, by extension, immensely difficult to feed.</p><p>“Go back to the shed, Harry,” Newt says and he uses that tone which leaves no room for argument. Harry wants to argue anyway but he bites his tongue.</p><p>Newt raises his eyebrows expectantly and Harry scampers back to the shed, unable to stop himself from craning to see what’s happening out of the little window. He can’t see much, particularly not when the curtain is magically pulled across and the door locked with a faint <em> click. </em>Harry sits down on the bench, feeling a little put out that Newt hadn’t even let him look from afar. The basilisk must be really dangerous if Newt is being so careful.</p><p>Harry supposes he appreciates the way Newt cares about him. He’s never been protected like this before and it feels nice though it is somewhat jarring to have these sudden limitations on his freedom. He’s always been curious and at least the Dursleys had always let him roam free. They’d pull Dudley back from the edge of the road but they’d let Harry balance precariously on the kerbside if he wanted. It’s strange to have that freedom taken away. He’d been angry at first until Newt had sat him down one day and explained that he only had rules to keep Harry safe, that he cared about him.</p><p>So Harry tries to understand.</p><p>Almost half an hour passes before Newt comes to get him, sleeves rolled up to his elbows and a soft smile on his face. He reaches out a hand and Harry jumps up, hurrying across the room to grab it so Newt can lead him over to the occamy nest which now has a whole new nest right next to it. It’s made of basically the same material but it’s padded with soft green leaves. One tiny little snake is curled happily in the middle.</p><p>“Isn’t she beautiful?” Newt whispers, squeezing Harry’s hand as though trying to infuse Harry with his own wonder. But Harry doesn’t need any; he’s full to the brim with his own.</p><p>Something in him feels drawn to the little creature and, glancing at Newt for permission, he reaches out to greet it.</p><p>“Slowly,” Newt advises, nodding approvingly when Harry rests his hand gingerly on the edge of the nest and lets the snake observe him. “That’s it. Good.”</p><p>After a moment of observing him, the snake slithers forward and Harry feels her scales settle against his fingers. His face splits into a wide grin and he can’t keep a delighted chuckle from bursting excitedly forth.</p><p>“Hello,” he says. “You’re so much smaller than I expected.”</p><p>The snake slithers closer, winding around Harry’s wrist. Harry grins up at Newt in amazement, expecting to see that same tender look he always wears when he’s caring for his creatures, but instead Newt looks surprised, almost concerned.</p><p>“Harry,” he begins and his voice is almost choked. “Have you ever spoken to a snake before?”</p><p>Confused, Harry shakes his head. “They don’t really have snakes in Surrey,” he says apologetically, suddenly terrified that he’s done something wrong.</p><p>Newt crouches down next to Harry which is always a sign that he’s about to say something serious. Harry swallows nervously, subconsciously rubbing his thumb over the snake’s scales to calm himself. She doesn’t seem to mind.</p><p>“There are some people in the world, very few people, who can talk to snakes the way you just did,” Newt explains solemnly, putting his free hand against Harry’s waist and gazing at it rather than at Harry. “Some people will try to tell you that it’s a dark power and that it means you’re a dark wizard but those people are wrong. They are closed-minded people. They’re the same people who think our creatures are dangerous.”</p><p>Hearing Newt say <em> our creatures </em>makes Harry feel so safe that he almost cries. Living with Newt feels like having a family.</p><p>“Do you understand, Harry?” Newt asks, searching Harry’s eyes intently.</p><p>Harry shakes his head nervously. “I just said ‘hello’,” he whispers.</p><p>For a moment, Newt gets that look in his eye like he’s observing a particularly interesting new creature. Harry squirms uncomfortably.</p><p>“Maybe you said hello and your power automatically translated it into parselt- uh, snake language?” Newt supplies tentatively.</p><p>Harry supposes that could make sense. At least Newt doesn’t dismiss him like his teachers used to.</p><p>(“I’m sure you <em> thought </em>you saw a unicorn Harry but there’s no such thing as unicorns.”)</p><p>He tries to remind himself that Newt isn’t like the other adults he used to know. Newt is kind and he listens to Harry. With this in mind, Harry plucks up the courage to ask his next question. “Can you speak to snakes too?”</p><p>The smile Newt gives him is soft and amused and he looks down at the ground again. “No. If I could, it’d make my job a whole lot easier. Though, being able to speak niffler would be even better.”</p><p>Harry can’t bring himself to smile at Newt’s joke. His heart is hammering in his chest.</p><p>“Hey,” Newt’s voice startles him out of his panic before it can really begin. “It’s alright. It’s not a bad power and you’re not a bad wizard. I promise.”</p><p>Harry relaxes. Newt has never broken a promise.</p><p>“Do we have to do some of those breathing exercises we practised?”</p><p>Crinkling his nose, Harry shakes his head. He doesn’t like the breathing exercises. They’re really boring. Seeing this reaction, Newt seems to relax a little too. He nods towards the little snake which is now happily settled around Harry’s wrist, apparently not planning on moving anytime soon.</p><p>“She seems to have taken a shine to you,” he observes, eyes shining with the same delight which is steadily spreading through Harry’s chest. Newt squeezes his hand again and Harry notices absently that he hasn’t let go since he took hold if it back in the shed. “Would you like to name her?”</p><p>Shock hits Harry square in the chest.</p><p>“Me?” He squeaks, eyes widening in disbelief. “I- I think you should name her. You’re a grown up. I’m too little to do it properly.”</p><p>Newt looks momentarily appalled but quickly regains himself. “You are perfectly capable of this, Harry. I trust you and I’m sure your new friend trusts you too.”</p><p>Harry turns his gaze back to the snake and bites his lip. She hisses quietly, her tongue flicking against the veins in his wrist and, despite his worry, Harry can’t resist a smile.</p><p>“Ellie,” he says, far more decisively than he means to. Then, he says, “Is it okay if I call you Ellie?”</p><p>The snake only winds further around his wrist and tucks her head beneath her coils, apparently settling in for the foreseeable future. A smile tugs at the corners of Harry’s lips as he looks up at Newt again, relieved to find him smiling too.</p><p>“I think she says Ellie is okay,” Harry mumbles.</p><p>Newt’s smile only grows. “You asked for her opinion?” He brushes Harry’s unruly hair out of his eyes fondly. “You have a very kind soul. Just the type of person who’d make an excellent magizoologist.”</p><p>Harry feels tears welling up in his eyes as he lets Newt pick him up under his arms and settle him on his hip. He really is far too old for this sort of thing but he clings to Newt nonetheless, careful not to upset Ellie in the process. Newt keeps Harry balanced on his knee until they reach the kitchen where he sets Harry down on the counter and sets about making them dinner. He finishes directing the knife to cut the vegetables before turning back to Harry.</p><p>“I’ve never heard of anybody learning to speak to snakes before,” Newt muses. “Typically, you’re either born with the ability or you aren’t. But maybe, if you’re willing, you could teach me a few things? You might feel better about it if it’s something you can share.”</p><p>Harry considers this proposal for a moment before sagging. “But I don’t even know how I’m doing it. I think I’m just speaking normally.”</p><p>Newt nods thoughtfully. “Well, how about you just speak to Ellie and then tell me what you were saying and I’ll try to repeat what I heard you say? I’d like to learn how to tell Ellie that she’s beautiful.”</p><p>Harry smiles and Newt returns it, placing a hand protectively on Harry’s knee.</p><p>“No matter what anybody tells you, this isn’t a bad thing. If anybody ever gives you any trouble for it, I want you to tell me. And if anybody, Merlin forbid, if anybody ever hurts you because of this-” Newt stops talking and pulls Harry into an unexpected hug and lowers his voice. “I wish I could keep you safe in here forever but you’re not a creature. I can’t just build you a habitat and expect you to stay there. It wouldn’t be fair. I know those awful muggles already did that and I’d never do that to you, Harry, never. But I wish there was a better way to keep you safe.”</p><p>Quite overwhelmed by this uncharacteristically candid confession from Newt, Harry doesn’t say anything. Instead, he closes his eyes and buries his face in Newt’s neck. He smells, as always, like wood shavings and, for a moment, there is nobody else in the entire world.</p>
