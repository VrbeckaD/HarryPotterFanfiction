    <p>Nights are too quiet now.</p><p>The Slytherin dorm is nearly empty. There’s no cacophony of snores from Crabbe’s bed. No scuffle of sheets as Blaise restlessly shifts in his sleep. Nothing to keep his mind from his memories. </p><p>Despite the terror of his dreams, when Draco wakes, he does it silently; his eyes snap open but he doesn’t shift or jerk or sit up. He’d learned to stifle his reactions into nothingness, first from his father, who resented any show of fear, then from his mother, who was terrified of her son dying for reacting the wrong way in Voldemort’s presence. Draco was grateful for it at the time -- he’s quite sure it really did save his life once or twice -- but now even once he was awake, he had no outlet for his fear.</p><p>In the silence of the room, his stomach snarled. He’d missed dinner again. And lunch. The Great Hall wasn’t exactly a friendly place for the Slytherins and he’d used studying as an excuse to avoid it. Not that that was a lie; now that his name was no longer an advantage, his mother made a point of reminding him that all he had going for him in the world was his grades. </p><p>Donning a robe, Draco traded the silence of the dorms for the silence of the halls. He passed a prefect without speaking, and they ignored him in turn; after the war, people wandered the halls at night more often than not, and the rule was revoked for anyone second-year and beyond. In 5 years, when the current first years were the oldest, things would be back to normal, but for now, the child veterans were allowed their freedom.</p><p>In the end, Draco found himself raising a finger to awkwardly prod a oil painted pear. He’d never gone to the kitchens before but his stomach had the reins now and he stepped inside as soon as the painting shifted. </p><p>“Jesus Christ!”</p><p>Draco didn’t jump at the voice. He simply turned his head to find its source, and let his expression relax and sour at once when it landed on none other than Harry Potter, the berk hero himself. He was dressed in a dreadful oversized jumper that draped to his knees and bared far too much of his chest to be decent, never mind the cotton shirt that blocked Draco from actually seeing skin, and black pants that looked to be made of a soft, dense black fabric. He looked...heavy. Like his entire body was being pulled downward, from the slump of his shoulders to the skin under his eyes. The only part of him that seemed to have any life to it was his hair, which had never allowed itself to be affected by gravity, much less something so mundane as a sleepless night.</p><p>“Sorry,” Draco said, too tired for fights or pretenses. “I’ll leave you be.”</p><p>“Wait!” </p><p>Draco halted with one foot over the lip of the entrance and turned his head to find that Potter had taken a step with him and had his hand absurdly raised as though to reach out for him. He cocked a brow, and the hand went down to rub instead at Potter’s arm.</p><p>“I just…” The man seemed at a loss for words, which Draco spitefully mused was really nothing new. Then Potter asked, “do you like pancakes?”, and that did take him by surprise.</p><p>“They’re… fine.” Draco answered, and pulled his foot back inside. “A little sweet for my tastes.” The lie was automatic; Draco enjoyed sweet foods immensely, but crowing over desserts was unbecoming for a Malfoy Man.</p><p>“Oh,” Potter answered, oddly dejected. “Okay then. I’d just…” he trailed off and motioned to a plate beside him, which Draco hadn’t noticed. It was heaped with a stack of pancakes, light brown and fluffy and at least thirty high. </p><p>“Feeding the entire Weasley clan, are you?” If there was less bite to his words than normal, Draco would blame his exhaustion.</p><p>Instead of getting angry, Potter let out a small huff of breath and shook his head with a wry smile. “Guess so,” he returned, then added, “you want some?”</p><p>Draco’s stomach answered for him, and Potter’s grin spread. </p><p>“Bug off,” Draco demanded, and took a seat at one the bar stoods the lined the center counter.</p><p>Potter served him first, made a point to get him a drink and his cutlery and napkins, and thankfully said nothing when Draco drowned his pancakes in blueberry syrup. They ate in silence, then parted with a nod when they were done. It wasn’t friendly per say, but it was something, and Draco slept better for it.</p>
