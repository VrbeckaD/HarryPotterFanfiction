    <p>
  <span>The fields of the Highlands wave as crisp winds roll through the land carrying the shadows of the clouds with them. The battering of dandelion seeds do little as they chase the breeze a train leaves in its wake. The scarlet cars are a sharp contrast to the vivid greens of the land, but they compliment each other, as they have for many years. Some dandelion tuffs blow into an open window, tickling the nose of a portly boy. Said boy snorts, not ready to wake from his nap. The trip was a long one thus far but his mates didn’t seem to share his plight as they continue to argue. Like they had been for the past hour.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“There is no way I can allow this.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh come on Moony. You’re a Marauder, and we stick together.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Just because I’m a Marauder doesn’t mean I can let you get away with this. I’m a Prefect.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Unruly hair stuck up in all sorts of directions as the young man sits defiantly in his seat as he regards his friend. “But you made Prefect last year and let us play pranks.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That was different James.” The fourth boy in the compartment continues to write on his parchment, quill scratching and leaving faint marks on the leather bound book beneath. “A little comradery to keep you from going,” the feather of his quill circles the side of his head, “mental.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Exactly! Thank you Sirius.” The wheat haired boy receives a wink and thumbs up from his companion. “But this. THIS. Is completely mental! Honestly, I cannot believe I’m having this conversation with you.” Chocolate eyes meet hazel. “You cannot steal from Slughorn’s storage. Not only is it stealing from a teacher but some of those ingredients are volatile. Getting caught could lead to expulsion.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Then we don’t get caught.” It seems like the most obvious solution to James.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ugh you are not listen-” With a huff Remus stands. “I’m going to do my last rounds before we arrive.” He just needed to get out of the compartment. The room stays quiet for a few moments after the door slid closed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So,” Sirius looks up from his parchment. “Still going to do it?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>James scoffs. “Of course.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Good.” The ink on the scroll hadn’t even dried before it was given to the leader of this band of miscreants. “Just a few revisions to your plan. Less likely to get caught this way.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh and I thought Remus was the mad genius. This is brilliant.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“He’s rubbing off on me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Despite the awful images that put in my mind, I didn’t think you’d have time to learn anything from him with all the snogging you try and illicit.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“How do you think I earn it?” James gags as Sirius makes high pitched kissing noises through pursed lips. The compartment fills with laughter as the two plan pranks for the upcoming term.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Their sixth year at Hogwarts was already shaping up to be something incredible.</span>
