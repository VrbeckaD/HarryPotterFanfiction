          <div class="userstuff"><p>I. You come and then you leave</p>
<p>She remembers him.</p>
<p>He was beautiful.</p>
<p>And he was looking at her!</p>
<p>Silver blonde hair and pale skin.</p>
<p>Those grey eyes.</p>
<p>She had never seen anything quite like it before.</p>
<p>She clutched her book closer to her chest and her heart seized.</p>
<p>She remembers hoping that she can introduce herself to him at some point when the din of the train station dies down.</p>
<p>She hoped that he would be her friend.</p>
<p>Maybe they could talk about books or study magic together!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Later in the safety of her dorm, hidden from her roommates, she cries.</p>
<p>He had hissed horrid words and his face contorted into something else.</p>
<p>She knows now he’s not beautiful but ugly like his words!</p>
<p>Like his soul!</p>
<p>This will be the last time she ever thinks of him!</p>
<p>He is vile and cruel and, and- !</p>
<p> </p>
<p>II.  Like seasons in my heart</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She can’t believe it.</p>
<p>The staff had the audacity to pair her with HIM of all people.</p>
<p>They shared many courses together.</p>
<p>They also seemed to share a voracious hunger for books.</p>
<p>Still!</p>
<p>Whether or not that was a good thing remained to be seen.</p>
<p>He would be lazy and self-centered and a million other things.</p>
<p>And they would never finish anything on time!</p>
<p>His mutterings surprised a laugh from her and if she wasn’t acutely aware it was him slouched beside her she would have thought it was a friend.</p>
<p>His face slackened for just a moment at the sound of her laugh and she hid her face with her hair.</p>
<p>Later in class she finally looks at him and her breath hitches slightly.</p>
<p>Sparkling grey eyes and tinged cheeks.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That night she looks at the sky and thinks of him.</p>
<p>The glass around her heart cracks infinitesimally and she let’s it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>III. Believe me, it’s a shame</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She tries not to look at him.</p>
<p>He is forbidden to her.</p>
<p>But every time he enters a room, her gaze slides to him.</p>
<p>She’s tried.</p>
<p>Oh, how she has tried.</p>
<p>To ignore him.</p>
<p>To stop cataloguing every gesture.</p>
<p>Every facial expression.</p>
<p>His laugh.</p>
<p>His scent.</p>
<p>Stop it!</p>
<p>He’s vile and cruel and not worth it.</p>
<p>She repeats it like lullaby.</p>
<p>It’s too bad that her heart is too old for lullabies.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>IV. Her hands are not the same</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Gross, what do they see in him?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>[He’s found someone.]</p>
<p> </p>
<p>[He’s found someone to warm his bed.]</p>
<p> </p>
<p>[journal entry] … I hate him… but I love him. Or at least I think I do? Ah! Ne puis-je savoir si j’aime ou si je hais?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I don’t know. Maybe he pays them?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>[waterlogged paper crane] … If I could be one thing I would be the breath in your lungs. I would fill all the places I wished I could touch. Would you let me? </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Haha! Oh! Maybe he blackmails them-”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>[Does he think of her? Does he see her face when he touches them? Does he think of her when he touches him-]</p>
<p> </p>
<p>[She does.]</p>
<p> </p>
<p>[She has past the point of shame]</p>
<p> </p>
<p>[...she’ll do it again…]</p>
<p> </p>
<p>V. Let’s face it all for once</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Her heart shattered that day in the cool summer night.</p>
<p>She didn’t know why she cared so much.</p>
<p>She felt every piece as they sunk deeper into her flesh.</p>
<p>Blood was sure to have coated her lips.</p>
<p>She imagined blood covering her hands as well.</p>
<p>Maybe we’ll be a matched pair?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Time away from school dimmed him.</p>
<p>He was no longer the focus of her world.</p>
<p>She focuses on what she knows.</p>
<p>It certainly wasn’t him.</p>
<p>At least she’s sure.</p>
<p>Another’s attention makes her feel giddy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>[Nauseous]</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It’s fine.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She’s fine</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She doesn’t need him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She doesn’t need anyone.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But then he’s there.</p>
<p>One night of horror later.</p>
<p>He’s there.</p>
<p>And she hates herself for the relief she feels at seeing him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When she wakes she imagines him.</p>
<p>His grey eyes haunting her.</p>
<p>Her friends help her down the stairs and that’s when she sees it.</p>
<p>He’s there again in a too small cabin filled with others.</p>
<p>He looks out of place.</p>
<p>A lord among his serfs.</p>
<p>She wonders if she is hallucinating.</p>
<p>Maybe that thing that carved into her broke off a piece of her mind.</p>
<p>Maybe she chewed on it like a wad of gum.</p>
<p>The image is too much to process.</p>
<p>She giggles and her friends stare at her in concern.</p>
<p>He turns his gaze on her and she knows then that he’s very real.</p>
<p>Her laughter chokes in her throat like flowers and she runs up the stairs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She’s...</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Fine. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>VI. I don’t believe in love </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Maybe it was because she had idolized romance that when confronted with it in all its terrible glory she was unprepared.</p>
<p>Half of her youth she spent running back and forth between life and death.</p>
<p>Maybe that was it as well?</p>
<p>She knows for certain she loves her friend.</p>
<p>He was there for her during the times went for terrible to horrific.</p>
<p>She’s thankful for him and his family.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But she can’t bring herself to say those words to him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She can’t tell him.</p>
<p>Part of her knows that if she did it would be hollow.</p>
<p>Empty pretty words.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the night she dreams of him.</p>
<p>It’s always cold and the stars look like frost on a lake.</p>
<p>He breathes out.</p>
<p>She breathes him in.</p>
<p>He fills her.</p>
<p>And she aches.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It’s not fair</p>
<p> </p>
<p>No, she can’t tell him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He’s not the one she wants to tell.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>VII. Tú que vienes a rondarme, amárrate a mí</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She breathes in the cool night air.</p>
<p>She breathes in until it burns her lungs and she slowly releases it.</p>
<p>Has it really been two years since she last saw him?</p>
<p>He all but disappeared in the afters and she didn’t care.</p>
<p>She didn’t!</p>
<p>She was happy to see him go.</p>
<p>Yes, happy.</p>
<p>He had helped them and that was it.</p>
<p>She didn’t want to see him.</p>
<p>She didn’t want to think of him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But her traitorous heart whispers and stutters and seizes each time she catches a flash of silver hair.</p>
<p>It’s not him, her mind whispers.</p>
<p>Yes, but it could have been, her heart says back.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Surprisingly her friend, her brother she would die for and almost did, corners her.</p>
<p>She stared into his green eyes and her heart’s hastily constructed shield crumbles.</p>
<p>She confesses everything.</p>
<p>Almost everything.</p>
<p>Some things are to [sacred] to confess.</p>
<p>He understands.</p>
<p>At least he thinks he does.</p>
<p>But he trusts her and in the end that’s all that mattered.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So here she stands.</p>
<p>The pathway to his home stretched out in front of her daunting and unknown.</p>
<p>Her mind and heart are for once in agreement.</p>
<p>She will wait as long as needed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>[A call]</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He opens the door.</p>
<p>[Breath in lungs full of him and his full of her and she aches aches-]</p>
<p>And she smiles.</p></div>
