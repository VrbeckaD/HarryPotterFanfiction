    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p>It was the day everyone had been waiting for, the day that every pre-teen and tern alike  had been waiting for. Classification day. Ever single person had to go through this at some point whether they wanted to or not. Whether they were wizards, witches or muggles. It was something that had been put to law from the very beginning. Anyone found to have not taken the test or holding back their classification would be put through the correct measures to make it right.</p>
<p>Now harry had been hoping he could be a of those exceptions, or by some miracle something would happen so that he wouldn't have to go through that day. Unbridled fear settled into his heart if he even thinks about it. He's been dreading his day ever since the durselys  got exceptionally angry at the official after his cousins results came back as anything but the neutral that they wanted him to be. They-and by they it was mainly harry's uncle  Vernon that had made trouble shouting and demanding while his face turned an ugly shade of puce, all Harry's  aunt did was stand behind him with a pinched look on her face as she held her son tight in her grasp.</p>
<p>The official took great offence and then proceeded to take Dudley away from the two parents seeing as he was unwanted there, the two durselys had been put into a correctional facility that would hopefully earn them their rights to their child back. Dudley had been put in children's care home for situations like those. The durselys had been let out on good behaviour and a had been given a probation  where they would be monitored under close watch, Dudley had been estactic to have his parents back when he saw them. Harry knew that just because the durselys finally accepted Dudley didn't mean that they would be kind to their freakish nephew, nope not at all. Before harry left for his new school his uncle Vernon had given him a threat of the worst beating of his life if he came back as anything but neutral, he promised that this time he wouldn't make  the same mistake as he did the last. This time they would never find out.</p>
<p>That had left harry shaking in from head to toe. It had been swirling in the back of his head ever since then, he had managed to push it to the back of his mind until it left him up , sleep deprived early on the morning of classification day. Worry ate at his mind as he paced back and forth beside his bed. He prayed to anyone that would listen that just this once everything would go how he wanted  it. No surprises. No exceptions. Just this once he wanted to be normal. Harry hoped he would still have his friends by his side and the others that he called family to to support him.</p>
<p>Hopefully.<br/>
========</p>
<p>Midday was when the test commenced, the whole of Hogwarts seemed to be either bursting with anxiety or blazing with curiosity. The Officials that were supposed to be leading the test had asked everyone to be station in their dorms or common room ready to leave at any moment. When someone goes through classification day , a series of tests and scenarios were given to judge what class you were, a bit of a physical  exam was performed along with some blood, urine and a hair and saliva sample would be needed ,  then there would be a spell that would be performed to either show that the official was right or something like that sort. Not just anyone outside of the classification officials knew how it worked exactly which others found strange. Some of the students thought that they left the testing till now so that they'd  the exact amount of nervous to flunk it, but harry thought  that just seemed ridiculous.  How could you flunk something that you didn't need to prepare for??  His friends opinion on then test had varied as they do with such different personalities, Ron was just happy that he wouldn't have to study for a test to finally to care  and Hermione  was just a bundle of nerves and highstring because of how u prepared she would feel going in.</p>
<p>Harry had heard rumors that there had been exceptions where someone would need to go through with the exam because they had shown signs of their classifications beforehand. He knew that he wasn't showing  any kinds of signs of any classification but maybe that had to do with his magic? Who  knew?  Anyways back to the present, harry sat in the middle of the Gryffindor common room with Ron and Hermione, praying that they'd just skip over him like they usually did back when he had gone to school with Dudley. Though the likeliness of that happening was slim.  He could hope though.</p>
<p>It seemed like they were going in no particular order, a lady dressed in purple robes with an appearance that reminded him of someone he had seen in the halls would enter the common room, have a look around for a few moments then she'd  proceed to point to a few people before she proceeded to the forms where some of the other students were. The students that had been called would be given strict instructions not to leave this guide and then they'd exit leaving hushed whispers behind them.</p>
<p>It wasn't clear how long it took to do whatever they were doing but about 15 to 20 minutes  later another person would come up dressed the same as the last and call out names before leaving in the exact way the last had. The process can late into the evening because of he sheer amount of children Hogwarts had  usually when they would have dinner  by now.</p>
<p>Only a few kids were left now including harry and his friends whom had taken up  a book or played a game to distract themselves while they waited.  Ron after hours of whining about how bored and hungry he had gotten shot up when headmistress Mcgonnell entered the room with three carts filled with food and drinks for her lions. Everyone couldn't help the cheers at the sight and smell of food, now that their bellies would be filled they would be less grumoy when their time came. "Children, " an official called out as the food was being shared, she had a kind smile on her face as she surveyed the children that was left " Since this group will be the last, he process will go a bit quicker, but I am here to advise you that you don't eat to much so that when the test is taken nothing adverse effects the result. You might feel a bit of nausea during the process to some examinations, so don't stuff yourselves.  In a few  minutes your headmiatress and i will proceed ro show you where you will be taken to feom here , just like all the others that have gone before do not leave your guide once your name has been called. I'm sure uoud rather not fi s oht whst hapoens if you do. " she warned accordingly  then turned to speak with the headmistress in a much quieter vioce.</p>
<p>Ron who had already began eating his fill slowed down when Hermione rather rudely elbowed him at the end of the warning. "Ron," she hissed with her face full of disappointment " didn't you hear what the official just said? Don't overstuff yourself or else!" Ron appalled at the idea of even not eating his fill swallows the mashed potatoes he had in his mouth before speaking "C'mon mione, I've been waiting g  for ages to eat. Stuffing yourself a little wouldn't hurt anyone after waiting so long!" Hermione gave Ron an glare as she began listing off he adverse effects his actions could have if he didn't listen to what was said.</p>
<p>Harry had been watching the whole thing in slight amusement, glad for some distractions from his shot nerves. He hoped that after this he would still be able to hang out with his best friend's,  and still maybe visit the weasleys. All that positive reinforcement  that he had taken to try and up his confidence wavered the moment he heard that they were the last group to be classified.  His appetite flew out the window so he forgoed the meal offered, best not test how strong his stomach was right now  no doubt hed throw up right there and then and a cold sweat had begun forming on has body as the minute ticked by.</p>
<p>Finally the time came to leave, everyone as ordered too ,gathered in a straight line as they filed out the room and down the hall, around some corners and into a room that was filed off in  sections.  Standing in the room were different coloured robes witches and wizards , some they had seen before and sone completely  new. Each of them were given orders to handle a kid each since there were about ten kinds left. In a sudden flurry of robes and movement harry found himself in a sectioned part of the room at the back with a male dressed in a deep red robes and a younger female dressed in yellow as his assistant.</p>
<p>The male smiled at how nervous harry was before he introduced himself as healer  garick  and his nurse Lillian. He then went on to explain what the process would entail but harry had not been listening , all he could hear was blood rushing though his ears and his mouth suddenly felt like how he imagined the Sahara. He could feel panic building up because this was finally happening. Nothing he would say to do would stop it from happening.</p>
<p>He would finally being classified.</p>
