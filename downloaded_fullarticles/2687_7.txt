          <div class="userstuff"><p>Percy had only been at Camp Half Blood for a few days. He barely knew his way around, still confused about the death of his mother and the discovery that his father was a God. But even when one was lost and confused, you could usually tell when something wasn’t right and the young man that sat at the back of the lunch hall in silent contemplation was not right.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>He didn’t fit in. His contemplative gaze and his lack of fidgeting. The way that the shadows seemed to dance around him, even encasing him, as he sat alone at the table. His skin was pale, his hair raven black and Percy was sure that those piercing green eyes could kill with one look.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Grover” Percy nudged the satyr, keeping his eyes on the boy who was creeping him out. “Who’s that?” He nodded his head.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Grover followed his gaze, eyes widening as he recognised who he was talking about.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“That’s Harry.” Unclaimed. He doesn’t take the whole Demi-God thing too well, only here for summers. I think this is his sixth summer here.” Percy nodded, his eyes still on the young man as Grover continued.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Used to be here full time. But got into some weird boarding school when he was eleven. That was four years ago. He’s not very social. I’d just let him be.”</p><p>Percy nodded and turned back to his food. He didn’t think about the boy again. Not until the battle of capture the flag a few days later. </p><p>Just as the game had finished. Just as the flag had been captured. Just as the trident had faded, a hideous and threatening howl ripped though the camp. Each eye turned in fear. That was no ordinary dog. That was a hellhound.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The beast was growling loudly, fangs sharp and glinting. It’s eyes were pinned on Percy. Chiron had ordered the archers, their arrows pointed sharply at the beast before them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Stop” a voice shouted from the back. Breaking the silence. But the beast was too large and dangerous to listen to any interruptions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The voice shouted again, but was once again ignored. The beast’s eyes were glowing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>However as the owner of the voice had pushed their way through the crowd, standing before hundreds of arrows, directly in front of the hellhound. That was when people took notice. Chiron was lost for words as he watched the young man that he had never really got to know, step before the gigantic creature. He was sure he would be dead in seconds. But he was so frozen in shock he could do nothing to stop it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Harry wanted to roll his eyes at the stupidity of the people that stood behind him. Why did they always have to kill, kill, kill. It had always been that way. Ever since he had arrived here at nine years old. Greek Gods could never find a peaceful solution. Well, he wasn’t about to let an innocent creature get killed. Not when last year he had risked life and limb to save a similarly misunderstood magical being.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“It’s all right” Harry’s voice was soothing. His hands out in front of them. “I’m not going to hurt you.” Harry suppressed the urge to snort. If only Hagrid could see him now.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The beast cocked its head, looking at Harry with a curious glance.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Come on boy” Harry smiled at the creature, as he stepped even closer. He was mere feet from the dog. It gave out a growl as Harry took another step forward.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“It’s alright” Harry soothed, taking yet another step. The hellhound was now looking with suspicious eyes. Yet, as it took a sniff, a deep inhale of air, its whole body seemed to relax. A small whine escaped its lips. It’s eyes widening, in what was akin to worship and admiration.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>It was as though it suddenly flipped a switch. The dog’s tongue lolled from its mouth, panting. It flopped to the floor, paws the size of Harry’s head, out in front of it. It blinked up as Harry, letting out another whine. </p><p>“You’re just a big baby, aren’t you boy.” Harry smiled at the horrific dog.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The rest of the campers were still frozen in place. Their eyes wide. Some in awe and some in horror. No one had stopped a hellhound before. Especially a boy that was unremarkable and obviously the son of a minor God that couldn’t even be bothered to claim him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Harry ran his hands along the flank of the gigantic dog with a small laugh. He was surprisingly soft. The dog panted and it’s large tale thumped against the ground. Rolling over, the dog’s belly was quickly on show. Harry was happy to oblige. </p><p>“Harry”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>A voice finally broke through the silence and through Harry’s focus on the hellhound that now lay at his feet. Harry looked to the source of his name, sighing. He ran a hand through his hair. The lighting bolt scar bumpy under his fingers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Chiron” Harry nodded his head at the centaur.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Harry had kept his life rather a calm one since being abandoned in America by his so called relatives. An abused and neglected nine year old that had been taught to keep his mouth shut didn’t do too well in battle situations. Even after his acceptance to Hogwarts, Harry had kept his quite demeanour at Camp. If he stood out, then they would notice his peculiarities. If he stood out, then they would see him for what he was. They would know who his father was. Well...it seemed that his calm life was over.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The centaur pushed his way through the crowd of Demi-Gods that were still<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>frozen in place. Harry raised a hand.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“I wouldn’t sir. Hellhounds and centaurs...” Harry tilted head to the side in slight contemplation. “They don’t get along too well.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The half man, half horse frozen in his tracks, just as the hellhound jumped to his feet. Harry’s attention was drawn back to him in an instant.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Now now” Harry set his hand on the beast’s flank. “Calm down.” </p><p>The animal let out a mixture of a huff and a whine. Harry raised a brow.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Sit down” Harry patted the rear of the animal. It quickly complied with his demands. Harry smiled at the creature.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>However, soon, a gasp of shock was ripped from every mouth. Harry looked up.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>A bright light above his head was forming. Shaping itself into an all too familiar symbol. One that Harry really did not want to see above him. He sighed. </p><p>A sharp cross, topped by a curve. In the centre of which a final dot was situated. Every single set of eyes was on his. A pin could be heard if it were to patter to the floor. Harry wanted to sigh. It seemed his life of hiding in the shadows, literally, was over. </p><p>One word was on every set of lips. Two syllables that no one wanted to whisper.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Hades”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p></div>
