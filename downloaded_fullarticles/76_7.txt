    <p>“Babe.”</p><p>Sirius didn’t comprehend what he had just heard. The soft sound felt far off and he was warm and relaxed and not in tune with anything other than that. He let himself fall back into that serenity, melting deeper and deeper into it. It had been at least a week since he had felt this tranquil and he didn’t think there was anything that could pull him out of it—</p><p>“Babe, you need to get up,” the voice broke through again, and there was a weight on his shoulder along with it this time. “We need to leave in less than an hour.”</p><p>And then Sirius was awake, and he remembered. </p><p>“Fuck,” he mumbled hoarsely. “Fuck, I’m sorry Rem.” Sirius felt discombobulated as he opened his eyes, trying to regain his consciousness. He sat up quickly, too quickly, and looked around the room frantically. Remus was sitting along the edge of the bed next to him, already dressed and ready to go. “I haven’t even packed yet. Fuck, I’m so sorry, Rem,” he added in a groan. </p><p>“It’s okay,” Remus said in a breathy laugh that made Sirius realize he may be overreacting, which tended to happen when he was pulled out of sleep prematurely. “I packed for you last night.”</p><p>“Oh, thanks,” Sirius rubbed at his eyes for a moment. “I fell asleep early last night didn’t I?”</p><p>Remus pushed a strand of hair out of Sirius’ face. “You were out by the time I got home.”</p><p>Sirius groaned. He felt worse now. “I’m sorry,” he said as everything from the day prior came back into his memory. The plans they had made for that night which Sirius had apparently slept through. He had passed out as soon as he had gotten home. “I didn’t even shower. I need to shower, I’m disgusting.”</p><p>“Sirius,” Remus pulled him closer to him and lowered his head to kiss along Sirius’ neck, something Sirius would usually enjoy when he wasn’t so damn flustered, “it’s okay. We have tonight.”</p><p>“Remus, your parents are not my biggest fan as it is. I’m not having sex with you while we are in their house,” Sirius muttered, and when Remus laughed in response, Sirius didn’t find the humor in it at all. “I need to shower,” he repeated as he shifted his body over, away from Remus, and stood up out of the bed. </p><p>“I’ll pack the car up while you shower,” Remus called as Sirius stripped his boxers off in the bathroom. At least he had had the wherewithal to change out of his scrubs the night before. “Stop stressing, the only thing you need to do is get ready. I’ve taken care of everything else.”</p><p>Sirius turned the shower on and stepped under the harsh spray of the water before it had even heated up. He’d gotten comfortable with extreme levels of discomfort since starting his residency in emergency medicine — sleeping at a hospital more often than at home had the tendency to do that to a person — and he’d also become too short on time for luxuries like hot showers on most days, so it barely even bothered him at this point. Plus, it was sure to wake him up, and hopefully bring him out of whatever funk he was in along the way.</p><p>Forty-five minutes later found the rental car packed up with one medium-sized suitcase, a small cooler full of breakfast and waters, and Remus driving the two of them to the outskirts of Swansea where he had grown up. They would battle some traffic getting out of London, that was always expected, but it would be less than a four hour drive before they reached Remus’ parents’ house. </p><p>“You can sleep, you know? I know you had a long shift yesterday,” Remus suggested easily as he turned the volume of the music down.</p><p>“You wouldn’t mind?” Sirius asked as they hit a stoplight.</p><p>Remus laughed lightly and placed a hand on Sirius’ knee. “You’re spending your precious day and a half off visiting my parents with me. You can do whatever the fuck you want.”</p><p>Sirius took a drink of the coffee that Remus had ready for him by the time he had finished getting dressed. It was dark and it was strong and damn, it was nice to have the opportunity to enjoy a proper cup of coffee. A rare luxury these days.</p><p>“I think I’ll be alright, thanks to the coffee and… what was it, 12 hours of sleep last night?”</p><p>“I got home at 8 and you were passed out on top of the covers.” </p><p>Sirius groaned. “So much for even trying to schedule sex.”</p><p>“I think we called it a ‘romantic dinner in,’” Remus corrected him.</p><p>“Oh please, we know both knew what that really meant,” Sirius laughed softly before blowing on his coffee, out of habit more than anything.</p><p>“I had your favorite mediterranean foods all prepped in the fridge too. All I needed to do was grill up the chicken,” Remus gave him a quick look before the light turned green and he drove through the intersection.</p><p>“No,” Sirius groaned, elongating the word as he tipped his head back against the headrest. “Don’t tell me that, I already feel terrible enough about it all.”</p><p>“You’re ridiculous,” Remus smiled, and Sirius felt a swoop in his stomach because, well, he had a thing for that smile. And then he smiled too. “You’re in your medical residency. You maybe get one full night’s sleep a week. Did I want to have a night to ourselves that ended with me fucking you into the mattress? Absolutely.” Sirius smiled wider. He loved this man, he always did, but fuck, there was something about those words coming out of that proper mouth of his that made Sirius love him even more. “But was I happy to see that you were finally sleeping in our bed after the last two weeks you’ve had?” Remus tacked on. “Fuck yeah, I was.”</p><p>Sirius hummed and took another drink of his coffee, his mood better now, but there was still a lingering something, like there always seemed to be these days. “So what’s the over-under of how soon after we arrive that your mam gives me that look?” he asked.</p><p>“What look?” Remus asked, and Sirius had to consciously keep himself from snorting.</p><p>“The one that practically screams, ‘Oh, you’re still around?’ or ‘My beloved only son picked <em> you</em>?’ or ‘Well, look at him, he’s a baby, this won’t last.’ Take your pick.”</p><p>“She does <em> not </em> hate you, Sirius. Get that out of your head.”</p><p>“Maybe she doesn’t <em> hate </em>me. But I can’t say that we’ve ever had a positive interaction.” Sirius stated, and he was glad that he and Remus had the type of relationship where he could say these things so openly without Remus taking offense. “Sirius Black, letting parents down since the day he was born.”</p><p>“Alright, put the dramatics away please,” Remus laughed, but Sirius saw that subtle roll of his eyes along with it. “I know they haven’t exactly… warmed to you yet--”</p><p>“Your dad asked me if I was old enough to drink the last time I saw them,” Sirius deadpanned. “I’m a fucking doctor. Unless I was some child genius -- which I can assure you I was not, James would happily tell you that if you’d like a confirmation -- then I am, at the very least, 26-years-old. And your dad is a smart man, Rem. He is aware of this, and yet he decided to make that comment. A comment that also insinuates that you are a pedophile, by the way.”</p><p>“That’s fair,” Remus admitted with a sigh. And they had just hit a bit of traffic now, so that didn’t help either. </p><p>“It gets old, so forgive me for my reticence.”</p><p>“I know,” Remus squeezed at Sirius’ knee and Sirius placed his hand on top of his. “I don’t know what to say about it. Thank you for coming anyway, it means the world to me. And they will warm up to you eventually, I know it.”</p><p>“And if they don’t?” Sirius asked, his voice slightly cracked, and he was surprised at himself. It was something that had haunted his thoughts ever since he had met them for the first time — when things hadn’t gone as he had envisioned — but he had never brought it up so blatantly before.</p><p>“Are you really that worried about it?” Remus’ voice was more concerned now.</p><p>“Uh, yeah?” Sirius answered, and something about it made him uncomfortable, like he was missing something. “They are important to you.”</p><p>“You know that it ultimately doesn’t make a difference to me, right? In regards to us?”</p><p>“It does on some level,” Sirius countered because he knew how much Remus loved his parents. It would be silly of him to believe that it didn’t matter at all.</p><p>“Of course I would <em> like </em>for them to actually give you a proper chance, I know they will love you when they do. But even if they never do that, it isn’t going to change anything. It’s not like their skepticism—”</p><p>Sirius snorted. “That’s a kind way to put it—”</p><p>“—makes me rethink anything,” Remus continued, unfazed. “They are my parents, yeah, I love them. But I’m almost 40-years-old now and you are my future. It’s not something I would ever think twice about.”</p><p>Sirius bit down on his lip. “Even though I fall asleep before you can grill the chicken that you prepped for me?” It was a joke, but it also wasn’t at the same time.</p><p>“Because you had been up for 27 hours literally saving lives in the A&amp;E? Yeah, I’ll deem that to be acceptable.” Remus pulled his hand off of Sirius and placed it back on the steering wheel to merge the car into the right lane. “But maybe try to shower before you fall asleep next time. Hospitals and bodily fluids and that sort of thing, you know?” Remus added with a quick look over at Sirius — a grin brightening his face — before he quickly turned his gaze back to the road.</p><p>“Not my proudest moment, I’ll admit,” Sirius laughed as he looked out the window to make brief, awkward eye contact with the cabbie next to him and then quickly turned his head back forward. “I’ll put the sheets in the wash when we get back to tomorrow, before I leave for my shift.”</p><p>Remus hummed, and then was quiet for a moment. “Listen, I know it’s a lot to ask,” he started again, “especially with how they have been in the past, but please keep trying with my parents. Just keep being pleasant, alright?”</p><p>“What else do you think I’m going to do?” Sirius laughed, but not because it was funny. </p><p>“I know. I know. I just had to say it,” Remus replied, quieter than he had been before.</p><p>Sirius hummed, deciding it was better not to say anything further on the subject, and turned the volume of the stereo back up again. Remus had put one of his playlists on and Wilco flowed through the speakers. They were still in traffic and the music had a lulling effect. Sirius decided to take Remus up on his offer and leaned his seat back to close his eyes. He hoped that this trip, at the very least, would help him catch up on sleep.</p><p>Three and a half hours later found them pulling up to Remus’ childhood home. Sirius had been able to get a couple of hours of sleep and woke up to one of Remus’ comedy podcasts playing through the speakers of the car. The two of them stayed quiet during the last hour of the drive, except for the occasional laugh or comment about whatever the podcast host had said, and overall, it was a quick and easy trip.</p><p>Remus’ parents owned a nice plot of land, Lyall had built the house with the help of Remus’ uncles before Remus had been born, and they had lived there ever since. It was warm and a little drizzly out, typical UK weather. Hues of green and gray surrounded them from every direction, only broken up by the brown tint of the Lupin's two-story home.</p><p>“Ready?” Remus asked him as he put the car into park and looked over at Sirius, and Sirius could sense his excitement, which was sweet.</p><p>“Absolutely,” Sirius smiled back at him, hoping that this trip would surprise him given his low expectations, and unbuckled his seatbelt.</p><p>Remus leaned over, placed a hand on Sirius’ cheek, and kissed him soundly. “Thank you for coming with me.”</p><p>“Of course I came with you,” Sirius said, his voice sounding off kilter, even confused. “It was never even a question.”</p><p>“I know.” His hand slid into Sirius’ hair and he kissed him again. “That’s why I’m so grateful.” </p><p>Sirius pulled back, feeling a little strange for a reason he couldn’t put his finger on, and pulled the handle to open his door a bit. Remus raised his eyebrows, confused now too, but for Sirius, it didn’t feel like the proper time for affection. Not while sitting outside of his parents’ house while he was on edge, like he would be the entire day most likely.</p><p>“Shall we go?” Sirius asked simply. Pleasantly</p><p>“Yeah,” Remus’ eyes flickered across Sirius’ face and landed on his eyes. “Let’s do it.”</p><p>In the next moment, they both got out of the car, and the slamming of the doors must have been a giveaway, because Hope and Lyall were coming out of the front door to greet them less than 30 seconds later. Sirius stayed at the trunk of the car, unloading their shared suitcase, as Remus made his way over to them and a couple rounds of hugging commenced. </p><p>Sirius was surprised that after the immediate joy of seeing Remus wore off, both Hope and Lyall greeted him with a smile and a hug each. That was an improvement, he thought, and he did his best to reciprocate gratefully. They made their way into the kitchen where Hope had prepared lunch, tea, and even coffee, which had they gotten “just for Sirius”. He couldn’t help but wonder if they had magically come around on their own accord, or if Remus had something to do with it. Either way, at least he had coffee this time.</p><p>“Mam, I’m going to take the suitcase upstairs and then I’ll be right down for lunch,” Remus said as Hope poured Sirius that cup of coffee. “The guest room, right?”</p><p>“That’s right, it’s made up for the two of you,” she said casually and Sirius suppressed a look of surprise. Remus made his way upstairs and Sirius knew for sure that a conversation had taken place that he hadn’t been aware of until now.</p><p>The day passed, and Sirius would even consider it pleasant for how happy it seemed to be making Remus. It was a low key visit, a lot of catching up, and Hope and Lyall beamed as Remus told them stories about teaching and his upcoming curriculum for the class he was teaching on the Baroque era this semester. They adored him, it was the most obvious showing of love that Sirius had ever seen, and it made Sirius’ heart burst and hurt all at once. There were probably a lot of reasons for that, but he pushed those feelings back down like he always did. </p><p>Around 3pm, Remus took a couple of hours to fix the things around the house that his parents had been having trouble with — changing lightbulbs that required a ladder, re-aligning doors, bringing Christmas decorations down from the attic in case he didn’t make it back before December — and Sirius had a chance to get some paperwork done for the hospital before they all reconvened for dinner. There was an ease to it all that felt wonderful, no tension that Sirius could feel, but he couldn’t keep himself from wondering if it would be enough for Remus like this. Laid back and fine, but lacking enthusiasm and that certain <em> something </em>he knew was missing.</p><p>Hope had prepared a pot roast for dinner, along with all of Remus’ favorite dishes, which was cute and ridiculous and felt like a made-for-tv movie. Remus prompted Sirius talked about his residency and his stories were met with interest — although that wasn’t saying too much considering the accident and emergency department was always one of the most interesting places to be, any day of the week, any hour of the day — but he still filed that away as another win for the day. </p><p>Dinner turned into wine by the fireplace, and Sirius took that as his opportunity to head upstairs and turn in for the night. The guest bedroom was large, one of the two bedrooms on the second level of the house — the other being Remus’ old bedroom — with a queen sized bed and a TV. Sirius took the rare opportunity to watch an hour of mindless television, some reality show about fishing for tuna off the northeast coast of the States that Sirius found surprisingly wonderful, and then decided that another shower before bed would do him well.</p><p>He spent at least half an hour in the shower, enjoying the luxury of time and warm water and the full night’s sleep he knew was awaiting him that night. Remus’ parents probably enjoyed the one-on-one time with Remus, and Sirius was glad to give it to them.</p><p>He dried off after he was sufficiently relaxed, combed his hair out, and pulled on his boxers and a t-shirt before walking back into the bedroom. It was an extremely low likelihood he would run into either one of Remus’ parents in the five steps from the bathroom to the bedroom, especially considering that their bedroom was downstairs, but he was going to be at least somewhat clothed if he did.</p><p>“Hey,” Remus was there, in bed already. The TV was off now, but the lamp next to the bed was on. Remus put his book down on the nightstand when Sirius walked back into the room and looked at him expectantly.</p><p>“I thought you’d be up later with them,” Sirius commented as he pulled his t-shirt back off and folded it neatly back into the open suitcase. Remus said nothing, but watched as Sirius crawled into the bed next to him, situating himself under the covers with a satisfied sigh. </p><p>Sirius was exhausted, even after all of the hours of sleep he had accumulated in the last two days. He was always exhausted. But he still wasn’t sure how quickly he would fall asleep. Interactions were uncomfortable around Remus’ family, even though things had noticeably improved. As nice as they usually were on the surface, he knew that he wasn’t the partner they had always hoped for Remus, and that was a difficult feeling to shake off. </p><p>“Come here,” Remus mumbled as he pulled Sirius over to him, wrapping his arms tightly around Sirius and kissing along his spine, starting at the bottom of his neck.</p><p>“Rem,” Sirius sighed, not letting himself melt into it yet. There was a lot on his mind.</p><p>“I’ve missed you, baby.” His hands moved up and down Sirius torso, covering as much area as they could, and Sirius could feel that he was naked beneath the covers. Naked and very hard against his back. “I’ve missed you so much.”</p><p>“Have you?” Sirius whispered, and it turned into a soft moan one when of Remus’ hands moved up to pull less-than-gently at his nipple.</p><p>“Mhm,” Remus’ voice was gravelly, the combination of it and Remus’ hands turning Sirius from human into putty in an embarrassingly short amount of time. “It’s been so long,” Remus added with a sigh and a light bite at Sirius’ earlobe.</p><p>“I know,” Sirius breathed as Remus tugged Sirius’ boxers over his erection and down to his knees. Sirius rolled onto his back and Remus slid himself on top of his body and Sirius’ breath hitched at the very close contact. “I’m sorry,” he muttered against Remus’ lips.</p><p>“There’s nothing to be sorry for,” Remus said softly as he pressed a hand above Sirius’ forehead and raked his fingers down along his scalp. Sirius looked up at him and met his eyes. “Just be here with me now.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Sirius whispered. Remus was right. “Yeah, I’m here.”</p><p>Remus brought himself back down to kiss Sirius, and groaned into his mouth when Sirius reciprocated, slowly but eagerly, in a way that gave up all control and let Remus take the lead. Sirius melted into it, into him, and when Remus sensed the shift he deepened the kiss and moved a hand down to grasp at Sirius’ cock, fingers dancing feather-lightly around it — barely, gently, so softly that Sirius wasn’t quite sure that Remus was touching him at all.</p><p>“Remus,” Sirius whispered as his body attempted to writhe beneath Remus’, but it didn’t really get him anywhere.</p><p>“Yeah?” Remus asked, unnecessarily so, between messy kisses along Sirius’ collarbone.</p><p>Sirius exhaled shakily. “Don’t tease me.”</p><p>And Remus must have read the desperation in his tone because he shifted back up to plant a kiss on the corner of his mouth before pulling the sheets completely off of them and kissing a winding trail down Sirius’ torso.</p><p>Whenever Remus topped, which was the majority of the time, he always liked it like this. Some sort of light on, sheets pushed away, all clothes removed. Absolutely nothing obstructing his view of, or his access to, Sirius. Remus had some sort of body worship kink, Sirius had figured that one out over the last couple of years. He wasn’t sure if he had always been like that, or if it was specific to Sirius, but Sirius found that whenever Remus got this way, it sent him into a different world where nothing except the two of them existed.</p><p>Remus pulled Sirius’ boxers the rest of the way off and nestled himself in between his legs, leaving a soft kiss on the inside of his thigh before pushing at his calves and maneuvering his knees into a bend and his feet to rest just beneath his arse. </p><p>Sirius closed his eyes and relaxed his muscles, having resigned himself to Remus’ touch minutes ago. He never quite knew what Remus was going to do, but the man could do whatever he wanted as far as Sirius was concerned. There were no boundaries between them when it came to this. And somehow, Remus always knew exactly what Sirius wanted and how to make it happen without Sirius needing to say anything along the way, which made it that much better. </p><p>He twitched as Remus mouth moved from kissing up his inner thighs and settled in with one long lick over his hole. A deep moan was pulled from Sirius’ chest, louder than he would prefer given where they were, but if Remus was concerned about the noise, he gave no indication of it. So Sirius didn’t worry too much about it either.</p><p>Remus alternated between kissing and licking and nipping, using his fingers to prod and rub and begin to slowly work him open along the way. Remus liked to take his time, and it was a rare occurrence when he didn’t know exactly how Sirius wanted to be touched and how he wanted to be fucked and tonight was no exception. </p><p>His free hand moved up and resumed that feather-light touch on Sirius’ cock. Sirius’ chest rose and fell dramatically with it all — he hadn’t been this turned on in months, nor had he and Remus had the time together — and it felt so good to be laid out like this, powerlessly, as Remus took charge for the both of them. He allowed it to envelope him, and he felt completely in tune with his body, and yet totally detached from it all at once, only aware of Remus’ one hand stroking his cock and the other pushing into his hole with his tongue right along with it.</p><p>“No fucking at my parents house, you said?” Remus’ moderate voice pulled him out of it. </p><p>“Ah…” Sirius couldn’t focus on much more than his breathing as Remus’ hands and fingers continued working into him, around him, only faster now and threatening to drive Sirius completely crazy.</p><p>“Because we can stop you know, just say the word,” he continued nonchalantly, and Sirius could feel his eyes on him everywhere. His voice was calm, easy, unaffected, and that was infuriating and unbelievably arousing and Sirius wasn’t going to last much longer splayed out like this. “I just thought that it might relieve some of your stress, to let yourself disconnect for a while,” Remus added before pulling both of his hands away and letting them rest on the back of Sirius’ thighs, massaging at them as he pushed them up and closer to Sirius’ chest.</p><p>Sirius groaned at the loss and took a moment to catch his breath enough to speak. “Fuck me,” he managed to gasp, and Remus pushed his length along the cleft of Sirius arse, but just barely. “Please. Fuck me, Rem.”</p><p>Remus reached over Sirius to the nightstand and grabbed a small bottle of lube. He coated his cock with it before dripping some onto two fingers and applying it at Sirius’ entrance. Sirius breathed deeply in anticipation as Remus butterflied his legs open, wrapping them around his own waist and letting Sirius’ heels sit just above his arse. And then he pushed himself inside, hands gripping tightly at his hip bones, and Sirius’ back arched up to meet him. The pain-pleasure hit him immediately, but the sound of Remus’ groan, finally affected right along with Sirius, lulled him through it all. He focused on that, as Remus thrust back in and out and in again, the sounds leaving Remus’ mouth, erratic and uncontrolled and volatile — descriptions that never fit Remus except for those glorious moments when he was inside of Sirius, fucking him into total oblivion.</p><p>And then Remus shifted, and was lying over Sirius and they were kissing. It was desperate and grounding, and it was real and Sirius loved him. They had issues and struggles and things certainly hadn’t been easy, especially lately. But fuck, Sirius loved him.</p><p>Remus lasted a long while longer, eventually coming inside of Sirius and then moving back down to finish him off with his mouth. He swallowed as Sirius came down his throat, his come-coated fingers back inside of Sirius’ arse as he did, rubbing at his prostate, tapping a pattern that never failed to make Sirius squirm with discomfort and pleasure and far more sensation than his body was built to handle. </p><p>“You were fucking made for me,” Remus whispered into his ear as he pulled Sirius against his chest tightly. He managed to reach down and pull the crumpled bed sheets back on top of them, and Sirius felt so spent and drained with Remus’ arms around him and Remus’ come leaking out of him that he knew he would fall asleep in no time at all.</p><p>“I love you, Sirius,” Remus continued, squeezing him closer with his bottom arm as his other hand stroked firmly down his thigh. “I love you so fucking much.”</p><p>And a soft cry fell from Sirius’ mouth in response, it was all that he could muster, but he knew that Remus knew. Sirius’ love for the other man had been obvious from the moment they had met, and nights like this, when Remus so fully reciprocated it back to him, Sirius felt that words were impossible. But Remus knew, he always had.</p><p> </p><p align="center">*****</p><p> </p><p>Morning arrived and it felt like days had passed for how deeply Sirius had been out the entire time. He felt warm and sore and sticky, which brought the night before right back to him, but when he reached out for Remus, he found the other side of the bed empty. And then he remembered. They were in Wales, at Remus’ parents, and Remus had probably woken up early to spend the entire morning with them.</p><p>Sirius reached over to his nightstand to grab his phone to check the time. It was just after 9am — later than he would have preferred to sleep given that he was at Remus’ parents’ house, but not as bad as he had initially thought for how well-rested he felt. He knew Remus didn’t mind though, and that was all that really mattered.</p><p>A shower was needed, evidenced by the sticky feeling between his legs, but it would have to be a quick one this morning. He sat up out of bed, stretched his arms above his head, and stood up. He pulled on the boxers from the night before that had ended up on the floor, grabbed a change of clothes he had brought from the suitcase, and headed to the bathroom. </p><p>Twenty minutes later Sirius emerged from the bathroom, refreshed, clean, and prepared for another day of interaction with Remus’ parents. He heard a muffle of voices, it sounded like the three of them were talking in the kitchen or the living room, probably having tea, and Sirius wondered just how early they had all gotten out of bed. When he was halfway down the stairs, their conversation became clear enough to comprehend.</p><p>“—seems more subdued. I hope that isn’t due to us.” Sirius heard Hope say, and then Lyall agreed, and oh, they were talking about him. He froze in place.</p><p>“No, it’s not,” Sirius heard Remus sigh and he gripped the handrail more tightly. “He’s been like that ever since he started his residency. I’m sure that spending the majority of his time in the A&amp;E is mostly responsible for that.”</p><p>“But he seems to like it though, doesn’t he?” Hope asked.</p><p>“He does, from what he tells me at least. But I think he’s still adjusting. He doesn’t have any semblance of a normal sleep schedule and he has a lot more responsibility now. He has attending doctors supervising him, of course, but most of the time, the decisions are on him, given the nature of the accident and emergency department. And I know that has been a lot, as it would be for anybody.”</p><p>“Ah, yeah. That’ll force anyone to grow up fast,” Lyall threw out and Sirius wasn’t sure if it was warranted, but the comment annoyed the shit out of him.</p><p>“He was already grown up, Dad,” Remus replied, voice pleasant but strained now.</p><p>“Well, the haircut certainly helps,” Lyall tacked on and that was enough for Sirius. He closed his eyes tightly, walked back up the couple of steps above him, and returned into the guest room to catch his breath. The magnitude of it was small, he knew that, but it was still so familiar and he didn’t need to hear anymore. </p><p>He shut the door to the guest room quietly and began to pack up all of their things. It was a quarter to 10am now, so they would only be staying five more hours at the most, and Sirius would be ready when the time came. He stripped the sheets off of the bed and put them in a pile on the floor — he’d take them down to the laundry room when he eventually decided he was ready to go downstairs — and then sat at the foot of the bed.</p><p>“I thought I heard you up,” the door opened and Remus’ voice interrupted his thoughts a couple of minutes later. He looked up and Remus was leaning against the door frame, eyebrows furrowed but a soft smile on his face. He was wearing a Swansea City FC hoodie that Sirius had never seen before. Probably a gift his Mam had picked up for him.</p><p>Sirius forced a smile on his face. “I just wanted to give you all some time together. I know they miss you.” And Sirius has to hand it to himself, it sounded genuine.</p><p>“That’s sweet…” Remus took a couple of steps over to Sirius and kneeled down into the carpet so that they were somewhat eye level, “but I want that to include you too.”</p><p>Sirius looked back into his eyes, and found it easier than he would have thought. “Okay.”</p><p>Remus kissed him once and then Sirius stood up, moving to grab the sheets he had left in the corner.</p><p>“They just started breakfast, and we have a pot of coffee ready for you. Then we are all going to walk along the beach at Three Cliffs Bay for a couple of hours before we head back home.” Remus informed him, his eyes not leaving Sirius, and Sirius knew that Remus was gauging his reaction.</p><p>“That sounds great, Rem,” Sirius replied easily. He was genuinely looking forward to the beach.</p><p>“Hey,” Remus grabbed Sirius by the upper arm before he could make his way out of the door, “is everything alright?”</p><p>Sirius smiled again, but he knew it didn’t reach his eyes, and he cursed Remus for always being so astute. “Yeah, I’m just dreading my shift tonight,” he lied. He wasn’t dreading it at all. The hospital felt like a nice escape right now, actually.</p><p>“Are you sure?” Remus asked unconvinced.</p><p>Sirius huffed with frustration. “Yes, Remus. Can we go downstairs now? And can you please stop looking at me like that?”</p><p>“Like what?”</p><p>“Like I’m hanging by a thread or something,” Sirius said with exasperation, but he kept his voice quiet, not wanting to be overheard. “I’m not. I’m fine. I’m happy. I’m looking forward to walking along the ocean, so can you let me be?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Remus nodded and Sirius sighed with relief that the topic was being dropped. “Let me carry the sheets down though.”</p><p>Sirius rolled his eyes and handed them off to Remus before turning around and walking back out to the stairs. He could hear Remus walking right behind him, and he composed himself as he descended down the steps, knowing that he needed to come off more positive and upbeat by the time he reached the kitchen. And he would, he’d gotten good at that by now. </p><p>Breakfast was a nice, with Hope and Lyall almost uncomfortably complimentary of him, and that felt strange given the snippets of conversation that Sirius had overheard, but maybe he was reading too much into it. Hope made sausage and eggs, and Lyall made chocolate chip pancakes. It all looked fantastic, but Sirius’ appetite seemed to have abandoned him and the few bites he took stemmed only from wanting to be polite. However, Sirius made sure that talked. A lot. He showed interest in Lyall’s garden in the backyard, Hope’s book club, and, to really get the Lupins going, any story about Remus that he thought they would appreciate. </p><p>And it all worked. Everybody particularly enjoyed Sirius’ retelling of Remus running into one of his students at the pool in the gym and consequently being nicknamed “Professor di Adamo” around the King’s campus a couple of days later. The cleverness of it was lost on none of them, and Hope had never looked prouder, or laughed harder, and it was infectious to everybody else at the table. Even Remus looked more at ease at Sirius’ seemingly improved mood, but it had been exhausting to pull off. </p><p>“I’m glad I finally got to bring you here,” Remus remarked as they stood along the shore of Three Peaks Bay three hours later. A walking path had led them around the cliffs and eventually to some stepping stones that crossed Pennard Pill, a large stream that flowed into the bay, and the entire scene was completely breathtaking.</p><p>“It’s gorgeous,” Sirius sighed as a cool breeze caused them both of them shiver at the same time, and then they laughed at that. “I can’t believe you grew up so close to this. It’s amazing.”</p><p>Remus hummed in agreement and wrapped his arms around Sirius from behind, bringing his chin down to rest along Sirius’ shoulder. It was warm and it was romantic and the combination of the touch and the breeze and the smell of the ocean brought a genuine smile to Sirius’ face for the first time that day. </p><p>“Don’t you miss it when you’re in London?” Sirius asked as he leaned his head back to rest on the crook of Remus’ neck.</p><p>“No,” Remus answered with certainty. “Life is life wherever you are. It’s nice to have a gorgeous place like this to visit whenever you want, but it never made the quality of my life any different. Plus, everywhere has its own beauty, London is beautiful too.” Remus kissed behind his ear and squeezed him tighter.</p><p>“You’re very wise.” Sirius smiled and Remus chuckled into his neck. Sirius reached a hand back behind him and pushed it into Remus’ hair, enjoying the closeness between them. “I need to be more like you,” Sirius mused.</p><p>“You really don’t,” Remus responded with a huff. “<em>That </em>is something that would change my quality of life for the worse. I definitely need one of you, not another version of myself.”</p><p>Sirius tugged as Remus’ hair with a bit of strength, at a loss for what else to do. </p><p>“What was that?” Remus asked with a laugh, and Sirius wondered how the hell he had ever gotten lucky enough to be in this moment. He certainly didn’t deserve it, he knew that.</p><p>“You’re just wonderful. It’s overwhelming, so I had to ruin it,” Sirius replied as he looked around the beach, feeling a tinge of discomfort, and he wanted it to go away. “Where are your parents?”</p><p>“Hm, they like to walk through the castle every time we come here,” Remus answered thoughtfully, used to Sirius’ ridiculousness by now. “Do you want to go find them?” he asked as he loosened his hold around Sirius.</p><p>“Yeah, we need to leave soon, don’t we? So we should probably stick by them for the rest of the time until we say goodbye,” Sirius concluded and continued down the path that presumably led to the castle. They had packed up the car before they’d left for the bay, so they’d be saying their goodbyes here before they headed back to London. “I want you to get your fill.”</p><p>“Alright,” Remus agreed and jogged a couple of steps in Sirius’ direction to catch up. Sirius grabbed for his hand and let Remus lead the way, enjoying the simplicity of being outside and appreciating the fresh air around him. </p><p>They spent another hour walking around and enjoying the view. Lyall seemed enthusiastic about giving Sirius a history lesson about it all. And that was nice, Sirius supposed — like father like son, and yada yada. Yet Sirius felt as if there was a wall separating him from everybody else, making it impossible to be himself, making him too worried about saying the wrong thing or the stupid thing, and ultimately, he thought it better to just stay quiet instead. </p><p>Sirius wasn’t sure if it was him or Remus’ parents or just the entire situation as a whole, but by the time they were ready to head back home, he was mentally drained. It had been a good trip, probably. He really couldn’t tell in the moment, he just felt so lost in his head. Unsettled. Yet there was no good reason for any of that, none that he could identify anyway, and he chastised himself for whatever it was that he was feeling as he and Remus got back into the car.</p><p>“It was fun, right? You had a good time?” Remus asked after they had said goodbye to the Lupins and Remus had started the car up.</p><p>Sirius hummed a sound of confirmation as he pulled his sunglasses off for a moment and ran a hand through his hair. “I need to spend more time outside, I think. It’s good for me.”</p><p>“We’re so close to Hyde Park,” Remus offered as he pulled the car onto the road. “Not the most exotic, but it’s an easy thing to incorporate into the days when you have a little free time.” </p><p>“Yeah,” Sirius said with a nod, the idea of running around Hyde Park more appealing than it had been in recent memory. And then a beat later, “I think I’ll sign up for a half marathon.”</p><p>Remus laughed. “You’re serious?”</p><p>“Uh, yeah?” Sirius answered, put off. He pulled out his phone and searched for upcoming races in London. “Is that funny?”</p><p>“No,” Remus answered slowly, and Sirius knew he was becoming careful with his words. “I just know that your free time is very limited right now. And a half marathon is a lot. You don’t want to start a little smaller?”</p><p>Sirius didn’t answer, but focused in on a half-marathon in Victoria Park that was two months away. Perfect. He clicked to sign up, and then heard Remus sigh next to him. </p><p>“You’re so far away,” he muttered, and his voice sounded sad.</p><p>“I’m right here,” Sirius sighed back, and yeah, there was a lot about this day that was fucking exhausting. </p><p>“You know what I mean,” Remus’ eyes flicked over to him and then back to the road ahead, but Sirius couldn’t find it in himself to respond. </p><p>Instead, he leaned his seat back and plugged his phone charger into the car’s HDMI port to connect it to the car’s audio system. He turned on the next episode of the podcast that Remus loved, hoping that it would keep him from instigating any further conversation, and turned his head to watch the Welsh countryside pass them by.</p>
