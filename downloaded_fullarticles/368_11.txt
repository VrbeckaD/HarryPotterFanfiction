    <p>Harry swallowed as he was shown through the entrance halls and antechambers of the house that must have been ancient; all red-brick and dark wood and stale air that pressed itself into Harry’s body and chilled his lungs. Each corridor was dim, the few lights that were turned on were uneven and cast great shadows upon the walls. The only great features that distinguished this property from all the others just like it was the serpentine carvings in every piece of wood, and the piles of books everywhere, clearly dictating that this was a <em>personal</em> residence rather than a professional one. </p><p>Harry glanced around again, maybe, the slow twisting in his stomach that he identified as anticipation, was less to do with the property itself, and more to do with who he was here to see within its walls. Tom Riddle, the Minister for Magic; they’d crossed paths before, though their interactions were rarely <em>friendly</em>. Perhaps, it was the insidious aftertaste that Riddle’s particular brand of politics left in his mouth, or, the serpentiform quality to his smile that felt contaminated in its sincerity, but either way, they weren’t friends. </p><p>In fact, prior to this occasion, Harry had never been invited into the sanctums of Riddle’s administration, even less so the sanctuary of his private residence, though maybe his recent promotion to the head of the Aurors had something to do with it. After all, it was well known that Riddle’s political reach was becoming intrusive in places that it shouldn’t, and that, in turn, was shifting every dynamic; in most cases, it made people bend to his will, except Harry wasn’t bending. </p><p>As of just this week, he’d ignored four <em>urgent</em> requests, and seven trivial ones, ranging from innocuous suggestions of how he should be organising his own department, to the far more sinister ideas of what, exactly, the role of the said department should be. Of course, ignoring Riddle’s suggestion didn’t mean he thought the Aurors were perfect, far from it, and the department was in great need of reformation; a renaissance, of sorts, to fit with the mutating threats of a modern world. </p><p>But it was not the place of politics, and even less, Riddle’s politics, to play the central role in that reformation. Harry had never been one for politics particularly, but he’d had enough conversations with Hermione to understand there were foundational principles to any functioning state, and one of them, was keeping politics restricted from influencing the ideas of freedom and justice.  </p><p>Hence, he suspected this… meeting, if such an informal approach to consultation could even be called such, wasn’t going to go well. Particularly if the rumours of Riddle’s preferred methods of repartee were true; a habit for pushing right to the parameters of comfort and decency, everyone said, and then pushing a little more. It was a practice that attracted just as much disdain as it did admiration, but Harry was yet to find out which side he would come down on.</p><p>In fact, he was yet to even meet his host who’d spectacularly failed to materialise at all. That was until he entered yet another anteroom, though this one was more comparable to a wide corridor with a row of shelves, all of them lined with books, along one side, and the stairs on the other. And, as Harry entered, Riddle was coming down those stairs; he paused, even from the distance he was at, Harry could see the way Riddle’s eyes lingered on him, assessing him.</p><p>“Good evening, Harry,” he said eventually, his tone smooth and surprisingly light given they didn’t really know one another. “I apologise for not meeting you at the door, but I had some exigent business that needed attending to.” As he spoke, he continued to walk down the stairs, his hand spread over the bannister, and an expressed on his features that appeared to be faintly amused. </p><p>Harry just nodded, vaguely hearing the excuse of an explanation, but far more transfixed by the shifting angles of the lights and how they highlighted every sharp edge of Riddle’s face and smoothed out the non-existent imperfections. It would be fair to say that Riddle was, at least on the surface, repulsively attractive; the perfect assimilation of features and colour tones that made a face so impeccably balanced, and so faultless that Harry was inclined to think it was a criminal offence. </p><p>If Harry was being entirely honest with himself, he would have to admit that, had they met in different circumstances, he would have been inclined to overlook the distasteful nature of Riddle’s politics for the sake of getting a taste of his mouth. But they hadn’t, and so he was going to have to be professional, and not think about the quality of the tailoring of that crisp, white shirt, and how it clung almost indecently to the tapered lines of Riddle’s waist; nor was he going to think about the flickering of that diamond smile that everyone said was irresistible. Though, at the same time, there was something slippery in that smile; it was a little too artificial, in fact, Riddle’s entire act reeked of superficiality and insincerity as though it was woven into his skin.</p><p>“Hello…” Harry found himself sticking out his hand but trailing off with his sentence, his brain struggling to find an address that was not only appropriate but was also palatable on his tongue. ‘Sir’ was the obvious choice, but that held far too many subservient connotations for Harry to be comfortable using it, and yet ‘Minister’ also felt too formal to use when invited into a personal residence, but then again, all other iterations fell on a side that was far too casual to be used without invitation. </p><p>Fortunately, or unfortunately, as Harry could say, Riddle sensed the predicament his tongue was in. “Please…” he said, with a smile that was a touch too insouciant given the gravity of the moment. But then, Riddle had a reputation for putting people at unnerving ease in his presence; he, by all accounts, possessed a calmness of being, smooth words blended effortlessly together to make this slick, shining surface of charisma. “…call me, Tom,” he finished, taking Harry’s hand in his own. </p><p>Harry swallowed again. <em>That</em> certainly felt far too casual given the circumstances, there was simply something so <em>indecent</em> about calling the Minister by his own first-name when this was practically the first time that they’d ever been properly introduced to one another. Though apparently, Riddle didn’t seem to share that particular sentiment and just contented himself with speaking Harry’s name as though he’d been saying his whole life. </p><p>“Won’t you follow me?” he said, turning away and heading through a side door before Harry had had any opportunity to voice any protest at all. He still followed though. Even if something under his skin felt increasingly nervous about heading so deep into the spider’s web. It wasn’t that he <em>feared</em> Riddle, necessarily, more that he didn’t trust him in the slightest. Not when there were rumours, however thin and unsubstantiated about how dissidents were treated when Riddle was officially in power, and, of course, Harry’s substantial knowledge of his activities when he had been <em>outside</em> the main political arena. </p><p>It made his skin crawl to think about, and his fingers involuntarily touch at the hilt of his wand, as it rested against his thigh.</p><p>Riddle didn’t turn around once as he led the way through several more corridors, before arriving into what must have been the dining room, possibly one of many. It was a relatively small room, intimate, though not cosy. The walls were painted a peacock shade of green and there was what was probably an original-feature fireplace against one wall, on none of the surfaces was there anything remotely <em>personal</em> in nature. And Harry got the impression this was a room that blurred the line between business and pleasure; a place where Riddle could entertain his political favourites, and discuss policy over ornamental cups of coffee, but also it was a place for the formal gathering of genuine friends.</p><p>Regardless of whatever Riddle typically used this room for, it was currently a dining room, and Harry took the seat offered to him at the far end of the table. Riddle took the seat opposite. Between them was a modest spread, kept warm by a preservation charm; the sort of meal designed to be picked at, and with even the fussiest diner in mind. There was meat, prepared precariously rare, and fish, and vegetables, and potatoes and rice, all so beautifully designed that either Riddle had exceptionally well-hidden aptitudes or talented house-elves. Harry was inclined to believe the latter simply because Riddle looked as intrigued by what was on the table as he did. </p><p>But, despite the beauty of the spread, set out as though it were an art show, Harry couldn’t stomach eating most of it. There was just something too elaborate but so substanceless in the setup, something too garish in the colours of the garnish, and too <em>real</em> in the limp, staring, eyes of the fish, lying on a bed of greenery and decorative flowers. Of course, there was the shallow exquisiteness to it all: the lusciousness of the verdure, and the vivacity of the possible edible flowers embellishing the dishes, adding colour to the otherwise black ceramic plates, but that was overpowered by the brutality of the carving and the redness of the meat. </p><p>“Are you not hungry, Harry?” Riddle said after a few minutes, apparently noticing that he was simply using his fork to serve himself minimal portions, and then to pick at the food he’d placed onto his plate, pushing it to the edges and examining each mouthful as a fussy child might.  </p><p>He looked up at Riddle. “The meat’s a little rare for my taste,” he said carefully, whilst attempting to maintain the civility that had got him this far in life. Emotion, and indeed passion, was all well and good, but in Harry’s experience, it rarely got you what you wanted, and instead waylaid you with a reputation for fervency at the expense of rational thinking. So, he tried to dampen down the passion, press it all into a little bottle and only uncork the lid at times of desperate need. </p><p>“Why don’t you try the fish then?” was Riddle’s unhelpful suggestion. </p><p>Harry glanced down at the staring, dead, thing lying on the central plate, before returning his gaze to Riddle’s face. “I’d rather not,” he said simply. He was contented with eating the more vegetarian options, after all, there was something about these animals that made them feel more <em>alive</em> than anything Harry had eaten before, as though at any moment the fish on the plate might begin to flop about again. It was certainly worlds away from the battered, deep-fried, thing he ate on the occasional Friday night.   </p><p>They continued to sit in the same silence that they had entered with, one that Harry could almost describe as pleasant. Riddle apparently content so survey the situation with single, lingering, glances every few minutes. Indeed, the only interruption to the extended quietude was the clinking of metal cutlery against ceramics and the slow chewing of the human jawbone. But, as nice as it was, Harry hadn’t come all this way to sit here in pleasant silence and have a man watch him eat.</p><p>So, Harry leaned forward, ignoring the tall glass of red wine in favour of the glass of water right beside it. He took a slow sip, raising the glass up to his mouth and catching a glimpse through the curve of how Riddle watched the contours of his throat when he swallowed. Still in silence, Harry put the glass back down on the tablecloth and allowed his eyes to meet Riddle’s. “Can I ask,” he said, “why, exactly, am I here, or is that redacted?”</p><p>It was perhaps a low blow to deal out so soon after beginning to eat, but it was also painfully common within Riddle’s administration that information tended to be redacted, or classified, or available only on a strictly need-to-know basis, and, apparently, Harry did not <em>need</em> to know what happened within the walls, as it were.</p><p>To be quite honest, he didn’t always want to know either.   </p><p>Except now, of course, at precisely the time when Riddle held the most power <em>not</em> to tell him. Riddle didn’t hold his gaze. “Of course, you can ask,” he said, cutting a slice of rare steak as he spoke, before raising it up to his mouth, “as long as you understand that I am not necessarily at liberty to answer.” He chewed and swallowed, but the slight smile at the corner of his mouth was enough to indicate that he understood just how annoying, and even unprofessional, that answer was. After all, why drag a man out to the middle of nowhere to <em>not</em> tell him why he was there?</p><p>“Why am I here then?” said Harry firmly, continuing to push the cap of a mushroom around the rim of his plate. He didn’t look up from the endeavour, but he could feel Riddle’s eyes, as they came to rest, heavy, on his throat, and in such a way that Harry felt a warmth flare up in the bottom of his stomach. He was used to be being stared at, but this was more than that. This was Riddle not just letting his eyes wander, but actively <em>watching</em> him, as any predator might watch its rodent prey; and Harry couldn’t help but want to see his expression. </p><p>With the practised finesse of someone used to chancing glances, Harry stabbed the mushroom right through the head and looked up at Riddle as he placed it on his tongue. Riddle didn’t even try to hide how shamelessly he’d been watching, if anything, he looked with an only increased interest at Harry’s mouth, even as he wetted his own.  “You want to discuss that now?” he said. </p><p>“When else would we discuss it?”</p><p>“Well,” said Riddle, pausing his meal and placing down his cutlery, “typically one doesn’t even begin to discuss business until after dessert,” he said slowly, taking his time to taste every word before speaking it in a way that was as enviable, as it was a form of synthetic human emotion. A contrived attempt at appearing to be as attractive inside his skin as he was on the outside, and perhaps it would have fooled most people, but Harry had spent his whole life watching people make themselves masks and hiding behind their shining visages. </p><p>Apparently seeing that his explanation of typical etiquette for working dinners, had not significantly moved his guest, Riddle smiled in that serene way that was a surprisingly accurate mimicry of empathy and must have usually made people trip over themselves with delight. “But, of course, I can make an exception for you, Harry,” he said, that same soft sibilance lacing itself between the lettering. “In essence, the matter that I want to discuss is that you now hold sway in one, of just two, institutions over which I myself do not have jurisdiction.” </p><p>“That’s hardly unsurprising,” Harry interrupted, his eyebrows raised, “given political ideology rarely mixes coherently with justice.”</p><p>“So the lawyers tell me,” Riddle replied, “but then again, you and your… department are not the definitive representation of <em>justice</em>, are you?” he continued, that slight quirk back at the corner of his mouth; the one that said he’d made an observation to his advantage. “Really, you are simply the middleman enacting policies handed down to you from a higher power, one which – ”</p><p>Harry interrupted again. His career had contained enough politics to know when a politician was about to start a polite speech about the great social issues of their time, that was actually their own ideological spiel dressed up to the nines with overly ornate vocabulary. And even if he was less obvious than others Harry had known, Riddle was still a politician at heart, and thus suspectable to their cruder characteristics. </p><p>“What exactly do you want from me, Riddle?” he said, stabbing another mushroom with the same intensity as the last, mortally wounding it before placing it into his mouth, and shifting in his seat as Riddle watched him swallow. </p><p>Riddle dipped his head and smiled, more to himself than to Harry; it was yet another display of artificial humanity. A clever and highly realistic imitation of awkwardness, stemming from embarrassment, but there was just something <em>off</em> in its delivery. Perhaps, it was the glance upward that Riddle gave to gauge the reaction, or, the fact that despite the curving of his mouth, his eyes made no attempt to show any emotion at all. “Please, do call me Tom,” he said, apparently formality was not his brand of forging relationships, “and all I want, Harry, is an understanding.”</p><p>Harry continued to watch in silence, waiting. If he was quiet for long enough without cracking, Riddle would get the social hint and explain himself a little more clearly. He had to wait thirty more painful seconds.</p><p>“Alright,” Riddle said with a smile that dripped with feigned empathy, “I am, of course, quite aware that the Aurors are not my <em>personal</em> constabulary,” he said, choosing every word with far too much care for it to be an entirely natural process, “which is, in principle, acceptable, after all, I have <em>other</em> enforcement to suit my purposes.” Harry swallowed at that, and momentarily put his fork down. He was quite aware of Riddle’s pseudo-Aurors, <em>death eaters</em>, as they were colloquially known.</p><p>Technically, they outranked him. Technically, they shouldn’t exist. But, as long as, Riddle kept them within certain strictures, the law had no opinion on the matter. Even now, when their role was being significantly expanded, and their competences were increasing, the courts were reluctant to engage, and Riddle’s competing force had started to ooze, like a most pervasive species, into the mainstreams of law enforcement.  </p><p>“However,” Riddle continued, not bothering to sugar-coat his next words, “now I find myself wanting…” he paused, his tongue running over his mouth as he considered the best words to fit his purpose and still be appetising “…assurance,” he said, “that the Aurors will not try to engage in matters of no concern to them.”</p><p>The dissatisfaction at that must have shown on Harry’s face because Riddle paused and appeared to reconsider his precise wording. “Simply put,” he said, “I just want surety that you, and your department, will be staying within the predetermined parameters given to you.”</p><p>It was Harry’s turn to smile; to practically laugh in Riddle’s face because it was a <em>laughable</em> suggestion. To say that the very entity charged with investigating wizarding crime was to stay in its place, which Harry took Riddle to mean, it should stay out of his, most likely illicit, business, was frankly ridiculous. “You must know, I can’t guarantee you that,” he said coldly. </p><p>Riddle dipped his head again, though this time he didn’t smile. Instead, he placed his cutlery down beside his plate and reached for his wine. “Maybe, I didn’t make myself clear enough then, Harry,” he said taking a long, slow, swallow, “you will <em>not</em> encroach on territory that is not yours to dispute.” He put the glass back on the table, but his fingers lingered on the stem and his eyes stayed hooked on Harry’s. “You appreciate the criticality of you observing this, don’t you? And the implications if you don’t.”</p><p>“Is that a threat?”</p><p>“Of course not,” Riddle replied, “it’s simply an understanding between friends.”</p><p>They were not friends. In fact, Harry was doubting that they could ever even be colleagues when the entities at the heart of their relationship would constantly be competing for jurisdiction. But, if Riddle was thinking the same thing, he didn’t voice it, so neither did Harry. </p><p>Rather, they stayed there, observing each other for a moment too long. Riddle slid back to shameless regarding the curve of Harry’s throat with such an intensity that Harry found himself shifting under the attention, moving his chair back and forth, scratching the feet against the wood of the floor. All whilst that same treacherous hotness squirmed through his insides, and his mouth became pitifully dry. He took another drink of his water. </p><p>“May I be candid with you, Harry?” said Riddle suddenly, his movements mimicking Harry’s own as he reached for his glass again, though his tone was, in no way, candid. Rather each syllable was delivered at a calculated pitch, designed to put him at ease, but somehow had the opposite effect. </p><p>“Now seems as good a time as any.” </p><p>Riddle only smiled at the acerbic lilt Harry’s tone had taken on, “I get the distinct impression,” he said, “that you have decided that you don’t like me.”</p><p>“Why ever would you think that?” Harry replied, laying on an even thicker layer of sarcasm, and certainly more than what was necessary to get his point across. He wasn’t usually so provocative in his challenges, but there was something about Riddle’s infinite calmness and constructed authenticity that made Harry want to rile him up and make him snap, because <em>everyone</em> had a snapping point, even the Minister of Magic. </p><p>Not to mention, finding out <em>exactly</em> what was underneath that constructed surface would be rewarding all by itself. Was Riddle as slippery as he seemed?</p><p>But, apparently, Riddle did not get the rhetorical nature of the question and answered it anyway. “Well for starters,” he said, “you’ve been tense since you got here, as though at any moment you expect me to reveal that I’ve poisoned you.” That time, Riddle really did let whatever superficial charm he’d worked so hard to perfect, drop completely, and there was a certain banality to his tone, even as he spoke of something as salacious as murder, and <em>that</em> made Harry’s breath catch in his throat. </p><p>For Riddle wasn’t one to have his façade collapse around him by accident, nor had Harry been prodding long enough to penetrate it, which meant Riddle wanted him to see that slick surface, and the razor edge of a serpentine smile. But, as quick as it was revealed, it was covered up again, under layers of civility and faked smiles. “I haven’t; poisoned you, that is,” Riddle clarified, “after all, killing you now would be… <em>impulsive</em>.”</p><p>Harry swallowed hard and his hand drifted down to where his wand still lay against his thigh. The way Riddle said it, made it sound like killing him had been under some serious consideration for a worrying length of time, and the way Riddle glanced up at him, his eyes tracing down Harry’s arm, and almost certainly guessing what his hand was doing, suggested he might still be considering it. </p><p>There was only one way to find out. </p><p>“But my murder still on the cards, I take it,” Harry said, managing to keep his voice steady, and trying to ignore the thrumming of his pulse in his neck; this was far more exciting than his average day at the office.</p><p>Riddle just smiled, casually picking up his fork again and skewering another slice of painfully pink meat, he placed it on his tongue, and chewed, and swallowed. “Oh, <em>everything</em> is on the cards, Harry,” he said.</p>
