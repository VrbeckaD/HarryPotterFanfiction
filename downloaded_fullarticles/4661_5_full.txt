              <p>Something is attacking New York City, and by extension the magical community that lives there. With the threat of a dark revolution overseas, MACUSA is desperate to find whoever or whatever is responsible for these attacks and put a stop to them.</p>
<p>As a man who lives solely for his work, Percival Graves will not rest until the case has been solved. But with a frustrating lack of evidence or leads, the investigation is forced to consult the help of an... unusual man. A wizard with a briefcase of highly questionable legality, who is somehow both completely different to everything Graves is, and more alike than he'd ever imagine.</p>
<p>(Uses the film's plot as a guide but is ultimately divergent, i.e. Graves isn't Grindelwald)</p>

    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p>The papers in front of Porpentina Goldstein blur together, the words looking less and less like English the longer she forces herself to read them. Evidently it seems like the papers are getting just as fed up with her as one particularly rowdy sheet of parchment flips up and starts dancing with her inkwell. Unable to fumble the strength to break-up their waltz, Tina rubs her eyes tiredly and switches to a map of the city where red dots glow faintly to represent the most recent attacks in New York. Behind her she hears Donald McBurney taking notes, his quill scratching softly against paper, and on her left Ambrose Strenburg sets down his seventh cup of coffee.</p>
<p>The clock inside their workroom at MACUSA ticks the seconds away and Tina fights to keep her head up, despite the beat of the second-hand lulling her to shut her eyes, if only for a moment…</p>
<p>The clock chimes and Tina jolts at the sudden noise with a start.</p>
<p>“That’s it,” Don groans, chair legs scrapping against the polished hardwood floors as he stands up from his desk. “I can’t do this no more. I need a damn break.”</p>
<p>Tina’s inclined to agree. But then again, she’s been inclined to agree all week. She stretches her neck and shoulders and winces with every pop from aching bones and stiff muscles.</p>
<p>“You finished cross-referencing the No-Maj witness accounts?” Ambrose asks, wandlessly pouring creamer into an eighth cup. His pale blue eyes are bloodshot and his grey-blonde hair sticks up from constantly running his hands through it.</p>
<p>Don walks over to Ambrose’s desk and swipes the cup, throwing it back like water. Ambrose levels him with an annoyed look, but does nothing else. Tina figures he doesn’t want to waste the energy. “I’ve been cross-referencing No-Maj statements for two goddamn weeks, and guess what I found out? They all pretty much agree that they didn’t see nothin’!”</p>
<p>Ambrose puts his hands up. “I’m not trying to give you trouble Don, but you-know-who is going to ask you the same thing and your answer better be something break-worthy.”</p>
<p>Tina watches sympathetically as Don buries his face into his hands to muffle a scream – if there was ever a time a wizard was going to snap due to paperwork, it would be now, and Tina knows there isn’t a court in the world that would convict him.</p>
<p>The thoughts of workplace negligence have crossed her mind more than once the last few days when she has a moment to spare to something other than their case. She’s exhausted, they all are. If they aren’t sitting in this room going over evidence then their out in the field looking for it. Sleep is now some abstract thing in the day that serves no other purpose than to waste time better spent working – or at least that’s what the little voice in her head that sounds suspiciously like her boss says.</p>
<p>Don’s fingers are raw and ink-stained from all the writing he’s done and Tina spots the beginnings of silver due to stress sneaking into his hair, while the lines in Ambrose’s face are drawn deep in weariness as he twists the gold ring on his left hand and simply replaces the coffee Don stole. Tina looks back down at her papers and maps, unable to read a damn thing, and holds back the urge to pull her hair and cry in frustration.</p>
<p>Weeks upon days upon hours of case files and ticking clocks and pirouetting papers and not a single wink of sleep is enough to drive a person insane and Tina senses that everyone in the room has just about had it. That’s when the door to the office opens loudly and the entire room straightens up so fast spines can be heard snapping. Don turns to the door, mouth working faster than his legs, his very understandable fear palpable. “Sorry sir we were just…! Oh, thank <em>Christ</em> it’s just you Queenie.”</p>
<p>Tina raises her head in utter relief as her sister bounds in, gold hair flouncing with every step and green eyes narrowed at the door at the end of the room where a certain someone’s personal office was, the stain-glass barn owl adorning the door’s window sleeping oblivious to the new arrival. “Is he here?”</p>
<p>“No,” Ambrose says with an uncharacteristic note of bliss, because they didn’t currently have a large, looming shadow breathing down their necks, “Left about a half hour ago for a meeting with Madame President.”</p>
<p>“Good.” Then Queenie walks over to Tina and yanks her out of her seat.</p>
<p>Tina yelps in surprise, “Queenie!”</p>
<p>Queenie settles her with a look that means no nonsense. “Don’t you try gettin’ of this one Tina. We’re goin’ out for a bit. Mr. Tall, Dark, and Brooding can have you back in an hour.”</p>
<p>“But,” Tina struggles, stuck between wanting desperately to leave and not daring to leave, looking to Don and Ambrose for help, but the two stare back at her with more envy than sympathy, “I’m still working!”</p>
<p>“Really?” Queenie clearly isn’t hearing any of it, “Tina can you tell me what day of the week it is?”</p>
<p>Tina doesn’t know when the individual days became a never-ending stretch of time but she should probably acknowledge, if only a little, Queenie’s wisdom if it’s this difficult to remember the date. Thinking <em>hurts</em>. “…Tuesday?”</p>
<p>“That’s what I thought.” Queenie links their arms together and marches them back to the door.  Tina should fight harder. Should tell Queenie no. Should sit back down in her chair because prophecies only know the hell that will rain down if her desk is found empty. But damn if Tina doesn’t miss fresh air.</p>
<p>Queenie, perhaps intuiting Don and Ambrose’s own silent pleas for salvation, pauses just before she and Tina leave and turns back to them, “Can I get you fellas anything while we’re out?”</p>
<p>“A couple ham sandwiches wouldn’t go wrong Ms. Goldstein.” Ambrose looks to Don for confirmation. It’s not much but they look happy enough to be thought of and Don practically salivates at the mention of food. “Yeah that’d be great Queenie. You’re a lifesaver.”</p>
<p>Queenie flashes her smile that reminds Tina of sunshine. “You got it boys!” and throws the two a little wave as she handles Tina out of the office.</p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>It’s a chilly day in New York City with the sky overcast and November air nipping at noses. No-Majs walk the streets bundled in thick coats as the late afternoon takes hold, busying themselves with street vendors and food stalls. Tina doesn’t know why her sister chose a rather lackluster café in a part of town where everything smells of fish, but quite frankly now that she isn’t surrounded by mountains of paperwork and the relentless ticking of clocks she’s just happy to be out of the office for what feels like the first time in weeks.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t say he’s cold… exactly,” Tine lets her eyes flit about the small café she and Queenie opted to sit at for lunch – though more of a late lunch considering the hour, trying her best to find the appropriate word to describe one Percival Graves. “He’s more…” She waves her hand about.</p>
<p>Queenie gets that knowing look in her eye and Tina can see her sister snatch the thoughts right out of the air before she gets the chance to think them. “Of a stick-in-the-mud? A pill? A wet blanket?”</p>
<p>Tina tucks a stray lock of brown hair behind her ear and shakes her head, “No, none of those.” She frowns almost comically over her coffee cup in thoughtfulness before taking a sip. Queenie’s pink lips open in a delighted smile.</p>
<p>“Oh! He’s a hardass!”</p>
<p>Tina spits out her coffee in a decidedly very unlady-like manner and smacks her sister on the arm, “Queenie!”</p>
<p>Queenie just laughs while Tina looks around the café, mortified. One or two patrons look in their direction at the outburst but pay them little more attention than that. It doesn’t really surprise her considering the café is relatively close to the docks with sailors coming in and out of port and factory workers going home for the day.  Someone getting called a hardass is probably one of the nicer things the No-Majs hear around here.</p>
<p>“It’s true.” Queenie chirps, “Of all the thoughts millin’ around most of the time it’s either sex or swearing!”</p>
<p>“Queenie…” Tina hisses, burying her face in her hands.</p>
<p>Another bell of a laugh from her sister and a playful nudge. “Oh come on Teen, I’m just kiddin’! Mostly,” And she winks.</p>
<p>Despite herself Tina smiles.</p>
<p>“Besides,” Queenie continues, dropping sugar cubes into the last of her coffee, and Tina can tell from the shift in tone of her sister’s voice that this is a conversation not to be overheard and mutters a quick <em>muffliato</em> under her breath. “Even if you ain’t thinkin’ it exactly, you know I’m right. He’s been workin’ you to the bone for the last three weeks! You come home after I’ve gone to bed and leave before I wake up, and I’m guessin’ he locks you and the other Aurors in a dungeon somewhere when you’re on the clock since I can’t catch a glimpse of you at work even though we work in the same building.”</p>
<p>Tina sighs. It’s true. Painfully, woefully true, but still. “We’re all working hard, Queenie. It’s not just me. Ambrose’s gotten at least two Howlers from his wife and I don’t think Don remembers what daytime looks like. And Graves? Merlin, don’t get me started. I’d swear the man sleeps at MACUSA if I thought he ever slept!”</p>
<p>Queenie pouts and picks at the leftover crust from her sandwich. “That still don’t give him the right to keep everyone from their lives. If you could hear half of what the department thinks about him right now…”</p>
<p>Oh, Tina knows. It’s no secret around MACUSA how much of a stickler Graves is. The man is perhaps the greatest Auror Tina’s ever known – working his way up a long and tough career to become the Director of Magical Security through hundreds of cases and criminals, which says nothing of his immense skill in both wordless and wandless magic. Honestly, Tina can say she’s honored to be able to work with someone as proficient and distinguished as Graves.</p>
<p>However, Graves the Auror is also Graves the Man – with his sharp, forthright way of addressing people, frosty attitude, and utter lack of being anything close to personable. Everyone at MACUSA respects Graves, not many people like him.</p>
<p>“It’s the case, Queenie. Someone out there is leveling parts of the city like it’s nothing and disappearing without a trace,” Even as an Auror the words form a pit in Tina’s gut and the flashes of buildings torn from the inside out turn it cold. There have been whispers around the office, of a dark wizard stirring up trouble overseas, that the Ministry of Magic doesn’t have the problem as under control as they claim, but so far there has been no word of him setting foot on American soil, and no connection to their current string of cases.</p>
<p>As relieved as Tina is about that, it’s still frightening to know something else out there is able to cause so much ruin in so little time. She does her best to keep those thoughts away from Queenie and continues, “The only thing left behind is destruction. Without any leads, everyone’s been working a bit harder, and if Graves works his team the hardest? That just means he cares that much more. He is head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement for a reason you know.”</p>
<p>Tina can almost feel Queenie searching her. Not so in an invasive way, but in concern. Eventually her sister gives a half-smile in begrudging acceptance, eyes shining with an intelligence most others write off when all they see is her beautiful blonde looks and fashionable clothes. “I’m just worried about you Teen.</p>
<p>Tina reaches over and squeezes Queenie’s hand reassuringly. “I’ll be fine Queenie. You don’t have to worry.” Queenie squeezes Tina’s hand back. “Well I’m your sister, it’s what I’ve gotta do.”</p>
<p>A bell rings out loud from a nearby factory signaling the end of another day at work. Tina laughs, some of the gloom of the last week lifting off her shoulders. “Thank you Queenie. I don’t know what I’d do without you.” It’s a bright spot in her heart to have Queenie care so much. “And I promise I’ll try to take a break a bit more often, maybe even take Ambrose and Don along… with…”</p>
<p>At some point Queenie’s eyes drifted somewhere past Tina’s left ear. Tina raises a dark eyebrow in suspicion and turns around to see whatever has Queenie’s attention. Milling out the gate of a canning factory are dozens of cover-all clad workers, every man lined in a film of grime and each with a near-identical tin lunchbox in hand. But Tina follows Queenie’s gaze into the midst of the crowd to a rather humble looking man. He’s shorter than the rest with portliness to his features and a kind face drawn down in lethargy, almost sad… Oh no. Oh, no, no, no. Tina immediately whips back around to Queenie’s miserable attempt at an innocent expression.</p>
<p>“Is that why we’re eating here?” This is not what Tina thinks this is.</p>
<p>Queenie just blinks, doe-eyed and voice void of anything incriminating. “What do you mean?”</p>
<p>This is <em>exactly</em> what Tina thinks it is. “No, Queenie,” Tina groans, stress crashing back over her like a wave, “You can’t do this.”</p>
<p>“I’m not doin’ nothin’.” Queenie protests feebly and Tina merely stares. She may not be the Legilimens of the family but she knows her sister.</p>
<p>It doesn’t take long for Queenie to give up the charade and get right down to pleading.</p>
<p>“Tina you don’t understand! He’s such a sweetheart!”</p>
<p>“He’s a No-Maj!”</p>
<p>“Sure but if you just heard him-”</p>
<p>Tina cuts her off. “Have you spoken to him?”</p>
<p>Queenie glances to the side. “Well, no, but…”</p>
<p>All Tina can think is thank goodness for that and Queenie glares at her for it, betrayed.</p>
<p>“Don’t give me that, Queenie. You’re a witch; he’s a No-Maj. It’s <em>illegal</em>.” And if anyone at MACUSA found out her sister was taking interest in a No-Maj… if <em>Graves</em> found out… they’d be lucky if they only got fired.</p>
<p>“It’s not like I meant to meet him!” Queenie smiles sheepishly. “We just, sorta, bumped into each other.” Tina can only cross her arms in disapproval – as if that’s ever stopped Queenie before, but then Queenie gets a faraway look in her eye, happy and dream-like, and Tina feels her resolve slowly start to crumble. Some Auror she is.</p>
<p>“It was down by that bakery on 7<sup>th</sup>, ya know? I wanted to get somethin’ sweet before work and there he was, standin’ outside the window.”</p>
<p>Queenie bites her lip in a vain attempt to stop from grinning and traces the porcelain edge of her coffee cup with her finger. “He was thinkin’ about cherry Danishes and banana-nut muffins and pecan pies and it was with all this love and he was going over the recipes his grandma taught him… it was so… passionate.” Queenie sighs the last word, “And do you know what he thought about when he looked up and saw me?”</p>
<p>“The same thing most guys think about when they see you?” Tina says to be coarse but it lacks any heat and Queenie sees right thought it anyway.</p>
<p>“He thought, ‘I’d like to have the kind of bakery a girl like her would walk in to.’” Queenie’s smile turns a bit somber. “He didn’t talk to me, the poor guy, he was too shy. But I wish he had. Not a lot of people think that brightly, ya know?”</p>
<p>The lit of sadness in Queenie’s voice tugs at Tina’s heart and compulsively she turns back to look at the No-Maj. He doesn’t seem all that special with his round features and battered leather briefcase, but Queenie’s always had a soft spot in her heart for people, for dreamers, something Tina always believed wasn’t only due to her being a Legilimens, and she supposed it was only a matter of time until one of them caught Queenie’s eye.</p>
<p>Still, Tina wishes that it would have been anyone other than a No-Maj.</p>
<p>“Like Mr. Graves maybe?” Despite the playful look Queenie sends her way, Tina knows it’s her sister’s way of asking for the conversation to drop, and while Tina can’t let Queenie follow a No-Maj around just because she thinks he’s sweet, it’s probably a good idea to let it go for now.</p>
<p>“Ugh, Merlin no,” Tina puts on a face like she’s just smelled a Troll.</p>
<p>Queenie’s smile returns, if a bit slower than before. “What, you don’t think he’s attractive or somthin’”?</p>
<p>“I think he’s my boss.”</p>
<p>Queenie smirks playfully. “Maybe he just needs a special someone in his life? A little bit of lovin’ might make him less of a hardass. He got a type? I could play matchmaker.”</p>
<p>The idea is so ridiculous Tina laughs and stands, grabbing the bag with Don and Ambrose’s food. “The only thing I know about Graves personally is that he loves his work, which is why I should get back before he notices I’m not doing any.”</p>
<p>“Fine, but you let me know if you sniff anything out,” Queenie follows her and takes a final bite out of her sandwich. “I happen to know Nessa in Magical Items Confiscation thinks he’s real swell.” Tina rolls her eyes as they leave the café. “Then Nessa hasn’t tried to talk to him – it’s like having a Hippogriff stare you down.”</p>
<p>“Or a Basilisk.”</p>
<p>The two dissolves into infectious giggles as they make their way to a nearby alleyway. Tina feels lighter, getting out of the office doing a world of good even if it results in what is sure to be a less-than-pleasant talk later on. Stepping between two buildings, Tina gives the area a quick glance around – nothing but brick and trash. With the coast clear she nods to Queenie and they apparate away.</p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>Tina peaks around the door to the office. Ambrose and Don sit at their desks, diligently at work, but Graves’ door is still closed with the stain-glass window sound asleep which means she’s made it back before he has. Tina draws strength in the knowledge that she’ll live to sort forms another day.</p>
<p>“Holy moly I thought you weren’t comin’ back.” Don goes right to Tina the second she gets through the door, grabbing up the sandwich bag like it would disappear at any moment. Tina scoffs. “I was out for twenty minutes. Don’t overreact.”</p>
<p>Don waves her off, stuffing a sandwich into his mouth and tosses the second one to Ambrose.</p>
<p>“Gee, thanks Tina for the food,” Tina says as she shrugs off her coat and floats it over to the coatrack with a wave of her wand, “I appreciate you and everything you do. You’re such a pal.”</p>
<p>Don tries to smile around his sandwich. “Fhanks Fhina!”</p>
<p>Tina shares a look with Ambrose who shakes his head and has the maturity to not act like a man starved. “Thank you Tina, and thank Queenie for me too.”</p>
<p>Tina goes back to her desk where her paperwork has folded itself into vultures to circle her from above. She has barely enough time to sit down and sigh, wondering how she’s going to convince it to come down, does Graves walk in.</p>
<p>The paper vultures instantly float back down to her desk, cowed as they should be.</p>
<p>In the flesh, Percival Graves is a formidable figure. A tall, broad man with dark hair styled back and even darker eyes that lend him a stare so intense it gives President Picquery a run for her money. It’s that very intensity that has Tina frightfully paranoid that Graves somehow figured out she left the office for lunch and it takes more strength than she thinks she has not to duck under her desk. It’s Graves’ serious, stone-cold expression that makes people either feel guilty or want to admit to being guilty – Tina’s seen him wring confessions out of suspects by simply staring at them, no magic needed.</p>
<p>It’s silly considering she hasn’t done anything wrong.</p>
<p>But there’s no judgement or irritation in Graves’ face, only cool detachment, and that trickles the icy-numb feeling of dread down her spine, because there’s only one thing that makes him look like that nowadays, and the somberness in his voice confirms it.</p>
<p>“There’s been another attack.”</p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>Graves would like to think he’s worked his fair share of atrocious cases over the years. There was that month-long sting to track down a goblin dealing in Unicorn Blood, an unlicensed wandmaker selling cheaply crafted wands that resulted in the deaths of two children, and a Veela trafficking ring that was traced all the way out to Chicago.</p>
<p>All of them terrible in their own ways and better fit to stare at through the end of any empty bottle, but if Graves could say one thing it would be that at the very least each one got solved. Evidence was left behind, witnesses stepped forward, patterns eventually formed… something little always lead to something more and all Graves ever needed was a breadcrumb. Give him that, and the hard detective work and dedication would take it from there to get the job done.</p>
<p>But this case has given him nothing. It feels like he’s been treading water for miles with no land in sight.</p>
<p>Graves steps through the remains of a malformed warehouse. There’s a hole in the roof where flakes of rust and plaster fall like snow onto the splintered concrete floor. Graves starts at the end of an outermost crack in the floor and follows it inward, seeing the damage quickly get deeper and messier, reaching further down, past the foundation of a man-made building, pieces of glasses, brick, metal… all broken apart again and again until they resembled little more than dust.</p>
<p>At the epicenter of the destruction is a crater fifteen feet at its deepest. The support beams that once held the second floor are curved around the crater, bowed inward as if Graves has stepped into the steel ribcage of a great leviathan missing it’s heart.</p>
<p>Even with the severity of the destruction Graves figures the incident must have happened not too long before MACUSA was notified and they were able to contain the perimeter. It was unnerving that something so violent could happen so quickly and leave nothing of itself behind.</p>
<p>Pressure behind his eyes flares up and Graves pinches the bridge of his nose. That was the circumstance with all the attacks; violent and random, leaving destruction and fear in their wake, yet nothing linking them together.</p>
<p>It makes Graves itch.</p>
<p>“Damned lucky it happened in a mostly abandoned part of the city this time. Be thankful for small mercies, huh?” Graves nods in acknowledgement to Auror Huang Bai, the man he put in charge of No-Maj Obliviation when it became apparent that these attacks were attracting more attention than the handful of Aurors arriving first on-scene could effectively handle. Huang accompanies Graves when Obliviation requires an entirely separate team, and needless to say Huang has accompanied Graves to every incident attack after it first started last month.</p>
<p>Graves stares down at his Aurors as they move about the scene, nothing escaping his attention. Strenburg and McBurney work to keep the second floor from caving in; Fanbrick casts a quick <em>erecto</em> to search beneath a concrete slab; Howell tests the area for any signs of invisibility charms.</p>
<p>“Think we’ll find anything?” Huang asks though his tone suggests he doesn’t think they will.</p>
<p>Graves wants to be optimistic and believe that this will be the time they finally get the upper hand they so desperately need, but quite frankly he isn’t an optimistic man. It’s been this way week after week, an endless stream of questioning unhelpful No-Majs, scouring the wreckage for any trace of what caused it, throwing around theories, calling in favors, following leads straight into dead ends… all for it to be for nothing when their unseen assailant strikes once more, and the headache starts all over again.</p>
<p>Despite the panicked murmurs of those higher-up, Graves has found no evidence to tie any of this to Gellert Grindelwald – and he <em>has</em> searched that particular possibility extensively. But with how dire things have been going over in England, the temperature could drop a few degrees past the average and the council would cry Grindelwald and drop behind their podiums. The destruction may be his style, but that’s where similarities end. No fanatics, no threats, no deliberate attempts on No-Maj life.</p>
<p>In a way, Graves almost wishes it were him, if only so he’d have a man to focus his efforts.</p>
<p>The corner of Huang’s mouth quirk up, “If you keep staring that hard you might actually set some poor soul on fire.”</p>
<p>Graves doesn’t comment. While he appreciates Huang’s attempt at levity, the last thing he wants to do is joke. Every time an attack like this happens, the boundary between the wizarding world and that of the No-Majs shrinks, and as that divide closes so does the feeling of safety, security, and anonymity their kind has needed to survive. It’s a serious matter, and he’s tired of their lack of traction.</p>
<p>“Sir!” Goldstein’s voice pierces the air, urgent. Graves apparates down to her where she holds her wand over a crisscross of rebar and steel panels. As he steps closer, glass crunching under his shoes, Graves swears he can hear… a voice.</p>
<p>All it takes is a look at Goldstein and she flicks her wand. “<em>Wingardium Leviosa</em>.”</p>
<p>The debris lifts cleanly and swiftly – a staple of Goldstein’s sturdy wandwork – and unveiled beneath the rubble is the broken body of a No-Maj.</p>
<p>He’s a man somewhere in his late forties and most likely homeless due to the worn, ratted clothing he wears and the long, scraggly beard on his face. Both of his legs and left arm are obviously crushed, blood pours from his nose and trickles out his mouth, and he looks up at Graves and Goldstein with bleary, unfocused eyes.</p>
<p>The pitiful sight strikes Graves right through the gut. So far death was something narrowly avoided with these attacks – a silver lining if he were so inclined to think of it that way. Now… now Graves grits his teeth behind the hard line of his mouth.</p>
<p>Damn.</p>
<p>The No-Maj rattles with each stolen breath. “P-please… help….”</p>
<p>Even if they had their best Healers there is nothing that can save this man, a trainee could see that. Graves kneels down in the dirt and dust and blood, “We’re going to get you some help,” The lie falls easily from his lips. “Can you tell me what happened here?”</p>
<p>The No-Maj shakes, coughs, broken fingers twitch in a useless attempt to move. “C-c-cold…”</p>
<p>Graves motions with a hand and settles a quick warming spell over the man. Graves doesn’t know how effective it is given the man’s state, but his shivers do quiet down. “Please,” Graves tries again, “Tell me what happened.”</p>
<p>The No-Maj blinks. “W-wa- was tryin’ t-to find a p-p-place… to sleep fer t-th-the night. S-so cold. W-woke up… when I-I heard s-somethin’….” He trails off in a weak cough, blood bubbling its way past his teeth. Next to Graves, Goldstein covers her mouth but refuses to turn away.</p>
<p>Graves gently places his hand on the No-Maj’s shoulder – pointless comfort in a hopeless situation. “What did you hear?”</p>
<p>“Her-heard a-a s-scream… but… but it, it w-weren’t l-like a p-p-person…. weren’t…. like… a person…” His words fade away. They were losing him.</p>
<p>Graves tries to keep the surge of desperation from his voice. A sliver of a chance for some kind of lead gnaws at his insides. “Did you see anything? Anything at all?”</p>
<p>“… O-only… d-d-dark,” The No-Maj looks somewhere far away, peace settling over his dirtied face. “…a… s-storm….?” The final note of confusion in his voice diminishes and his body stills.</p>
<p>Graves closes his eyes, takes a deep breath and exhales. The pressure in his head blooms into a pain, rich with something he refuses to call futility. Damn.</p>
<p>Damn, damn, damn.</p>
<p>He stands back up, knees stiff. The rest of the Aurors had stopped what they were doing, all eyes on Graves and the dead No-Maj at his feet.</p>
<p>“Alright everyone, back to work,” His voice carries far and powerfully and everyone busies themselves once again. They don’t have the time to waste, certainly not to feel guilt over the death of one nameless man.</p>
<p>A notion starts forming in Graves’ mind, the pieces of the case fitting less like a puzzle and more like a cobbled road, but a picture forms nonetheless. He looks down at the No-Maj, vacant eyes half-lidded, and mostly to himself he mutters, “We still have a long night ahead of us.”</p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>Strenburg, McBurney, and Goldstein stand in front of Graves’ desk, hands clasped tightly behind their backs as they wait for him to finishing reading over their reports. As is expected, it is exemplary work from each of them, but with tonight’s attack, tonight’s <em>death</em>, there is still much more to be done. With this first, true witness, they have to go back thorough all previous No-Maj statements, set up surveillance teams for the warehouse and surrounding area, comb back over the earlier incident sites, try and find any correlation between the locations, retest anything and everything for spells, charms, jinxes, hexes…</p>
<p>Still so much to do when there simply weren’t enough hours in the day.</p>
<p>The headache he’s been staving off the better part of the week slowly spreads down his neck and shoulders. But it doesn’t matter. Discomfort is something Graves can ignore, and it will be ignored for however long it takes to see this damn case solved.</p>
<p>There’s a single, sharp knock outside his office and, as it is spelled to do, the door opens to allow Seraphina Picquery entrance.</p>
<p>“Madame President.” Graves stands as she steps into the room, her embroidered robes and bejeweled headdress sparkling gently by the light from the fireplace.</p>
<p>“Mr. Graves,” she smiles to him and nods to the others in greeting, each matching her with a respectful, “Madame President” as she meets their eyes.</p>
<p>“I heard there was another attack tonight. A death,” she says, hands folded neatly in front of her, “Any new insights?”</p>
<p>Is it Grindelwald, she asks silently.</p>
<p>Graves shakes his head. “No ma’am. However, we were just about to compile the reports. I can have it ready in a few hours if need be.” McBurney makes a strangled noise in the back of his throat to which Goldstein subtly smacks him on the back for and erupts into a brief coughing fit.</p>
<p> Graves ignores him. He knows his Aurors are tired, but this is the job. No one ever said it was going to be a cakewalk, and while he doesn’t expect perfection, he aims very close to it.</p>
<p>“Sorry Sir,” McBurney coughs, red with embarrassment, “Madame President.”</p>
<p>Seraphina raises one perfect eyebrow and turns back to Graves. “That won’t be necessary Mr. Graves. I’m sure your reports can wait until morning to be… compiled.” She punctuates the last word with something Graves is sure he’s supposed to catch onto but he doesn’t have the time or energy to spare for it.</p>
<p>“Of course,” he flicks his hand and his quill springs to life, copying the notes for his personal files, “In the meantime I need to speak to Rodgers about getting an owl out to the Ukraine. McBurney, Goldstein, I want you two to track down Gnarlack and see if he’s heard anything about tonight. Strenburg, I want you—“</p>
<p>“Ah,” Seraphina interrupts with a hand, “Mr. Graves, I think your investigation can resume in the morning, don’t you?”</p>
<p>She motions slyly with her eyes towards the three Aurors at his desk and Graves takes a moment to focus. None of them slouch, lean, or sway, but now that he really looks at them, Graves notices the large, dark rings under Goldstein’s eyes, the twitch that’s developed in Strenburg’s left hand due to all the coffee he’s been drinking, and the fact that McBurney’s been wearing the same suit for the last three days.</p>
<p>Being an Auror is built on long days and even longer nights, and Graves doesn’t excuse weakness of any kind, but he concedes this case might have gotten more under his skin that he’s been willing to admit, and maybe it would be… <em>nice</em> of him to give the three a break for tonight.</p>
<p>“Yes, Madame President.” He addresses the three before him, “You’ve done good work. Go home, get some rest, and report back to me in the morning.” They do a very poor job of hiding the relief that washes over them – McBurney looks like he might actually burst into tears.</p>
<p>Not to look a gift horse in the mouth, Goldstein, Strenburg, and McBurney say their goodnights hastily and scurry out the office, presumably before Graves can find a reason to rope them back. Still, Graves has an image to uphold.</p>
<p>“Ms. Goldstein.”</p>
<p>Goldstein freezes mid-step, Strenburg and McBurney already well out of the door.</p>
<p>“Yes, sir?” she turns to him like she anticipates a firing squad and Graves levels her with a look.</p>
<p>“Next time you leave for lunch, I would appreciate you clearing it with me first. Otherwise, you might find it more convenient to bring food from home, or visit the kitchens.” He probably shouldn’t take gratification in the flash of panic that crosses over her face.</p>
<p>“Yes, sir,” she stutters.</p>
<p>He nods once. “Goodnight then, Ms. Goldstein.”</p>
<p>Graves appreciates Goldstein not fleeing his office as the door shuts behind her. Seraphina, for her part, is far more amused then Graves thinks the situation warrants.</p>
<p>Almost like a taking off a coat, Seraphina shakes off her President of MACUSA regality and settles more into the friend Graves made his third year at Ilvermorny when they paired up for Potions and discovered through no small number of explosions and melted cauldrons that they were both equally terrible at the subject.</p>
<p>“Do you enjoy instilling fear in the hearts of all those you meet, or are your underlings special?” her voice is full of good-humor and Graves blames the answering quirk to his mouth on the lack of sleep and headache.</p>
<p>Graves sits back down into his leather chair with a sigh. “They’re good Aurors.”</p>
<p>Seraphina leans against his desk and smirks, “It might be nice for them to hear that from you every once in a while.”</p>
<p>“They know.” Graves isn’t entirely sure if that’s true or not, but he didn’t start his position as head of the department by giving flowery, emotional speeches of empowerment to his Aurors, and he isn’t going to start now. The quill at his elbow pauses for it’s work to be checked but as Graves looks over, Seraphina snaps her fingers and the file snaps shut, skimming the tip of his nose.</p>
<p>“When I suggested your team be allowed to go home for the night Percival, that wasn’t a suggestion for you to take as you please,” Graves glares up at her halfheartedly.</p>
<p>“I have work to do Seraphina.”</p>
<p>Seraphina waves him off, the bangles around her wrist clinking delicately. “You always have work Percival. You had it yesterday, you had it today, and you’ll have it tomorrow. You’ve been waist-deep in this case since it started and there’s no amount of note-reading or paper-pushing that’s going to give you any more clues in the next few hours than it will in the morning.”</p>
<p>Graves doesn’t like to admit when he’s exhausted, but he likes being called out on it even less. “I’m working on a new angle and I need to get started on it tonight.”</p>
<p>“You gave me the impression it wasn’t Grindelwald.” Her tone is immediately serious.</p>
<p>“It’s not,” he matches her tone beat for beat. There is nothing he takes more seriously than his work. “It’s a different kind of angle.”</p>
<p>“Oh really?” Seraphina crosses her arms, challenge in every line of her posture. “What angle?”</p>
<p>“I think a beast could be behind these attacks.”</p>
<p>Seraphina loses some of her sudden hostility and shifts attentively. “Why do you say that?”</p>
<p>Graves rubs a hand over his mouth. “There hasn’t been a single trace of magic to be found at the crime scenes, just damage. The No-Majs never see or hear anything. Not until tonight,” he taps the file. “This No-Maj said he heard something, something not human. And these attacks have just been so random – no pattern, nothing to gain.” Graves brings his hands together and rests his elbows on his desk. “If the attacks don’t fit typical criminal behavior, then maybe it’s because it’s not a criminal doing them.”</p>
<p>Across from him, Seraphina doesn’t look so convinced. “That’s a lot of speculation.”</p>
<p>She hits the nail on the head and Graves scowls. He isn’t happy about it either. “I know. It’s irritating and I don’t like taking leaps this big without the evidence to back it up, but it’s all I have to work with.”</p>
<p>Seraphina leans back, understanding in her expression. “The one avenue you haven’t yet tried?”</p>
<p>“Preciously.”</p>
<p>“And that’s what makes you such a damn good Auror.” She smiles at him fondly, and he can’t help the small one he gives her in return. There aren’t many times when President Picquery his Boss and Seraphina Picquery his Friend overlap, but the few occasions they do make even Graves’ reserved temperament warm just a little. Not that he’ll admit it.</p>
<p>With a wave of her hand, Picquery summons Graves’ crystal decanter from the top of his filing cabinet and pours herself a drink. “So,” she swirls the brandy in her glass, “what’s the next step?”</p>
<p>“I’m going to owl Flintsworth from Beast Ordinances. He’s currently in the Ukraine with his wife celebrating their thirtieth anniversary and isn’t due back until Christmas.” Graves frowns into his hands, “I’d rather work with him directly, but I’m hoping he can suggest a peer to consult with us on this case.”</p>
<p>Seraphina hums in thought and sips her brandy absently. Graves thinks of the night ahead, how late it is, how much more needs to be done, how the muscles in his lower back twinge. It’s enough that the amber of the brandy shines attractively and why not? He could use a drink.</p>
<p>He picks up the decanter for his own pick-me-up but all that fills his glass is air.</p>
<p>“If you want a nightcap, you can have it at home. Take the night off Percival.”  Seraphina flicks her wrist and Graves’ decanter, brandy and all, pop back onto his file cabinet. He squashes the rising irritation because he doesn’t need to help the subtle throbbing in his head.</p>
<p>“I still—“</p>
<p>“I can send an owl with the best of them,” Seraphina rises from her seat, “I haven’t forgotten since becoming President.”</p>
<p>Seraphina’s tone leaves no room for argument, but the thought of leaving work unfinished, and to someone else no less? No. He has to be the one to do it. His muscles will relax. The headache will go away. The exhaustion will be held off.</p>
<p>“Seraphina, with all due respect—” Graves stands, and is then promptly betrayed by his own body when a nerve in his neck spasms and he cuts himself off. Seraphina smells blood in the water and it’s all it takes for her to move in for the kill.</p>
<p>She pulls herself up to her full height. “With all due respect, <em>Mr. Graves</em>, you are my subordinate, and I am ordering you to go home.”</p>
<p>“Seraphina—“</p>
<p>“<em>In fact</em>, I think you should take tomorrow off as well.”</p>
<p>“Now look—“</p>
<p>“Would you like to make it a long weekend, Mr. Graves?” Seraphina askes, voice polite as ever but her eyes glint sharply, daring him to push her. Grave very nearly growls.</p>
<p>Seraphina smiles all pearly white teeth. “I thought not.” With one hand she motions to the fireplace and extinguishes the flames and with the other tosses Graves’ coat at him.</p>
<p>“I can take care of this before the night is out,” she says, summoning Graves’ files to her waiting arms – now she’s just showing off, being as pleased with herself as she clearly is, and Graves would roll his eyes if he didn’t know for a fact Seraphina would take it as another victory. “I’ll see you the day after tomorrow.”</p>
<p>Graves throws on his coat, trying to salvage some of his dignity despite the urge to fight her on this. That’s what he gets for a diligent work ethic. But he knows at the first sign of defiance, Seraphina will follow through on her threat.</p>
<p>Or worse, make him take a vacation.</p>
<p>Graves shudders at the thought.</p>
<p>“Goodnight Madame President,” he says civilly, if not icily, because being petty won’t get him anywhere.</p>
<p>“Goodnight… <em>Percy</em>.”</p>
<p>It takes a near unsurmountable level of Graves’ well-honed self-control to leave the room and not turn around to do something incredibly childish in response.</p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>It’s well past midnight as Graves apparates behind his apartment building. The cold air hits him immediately, piercing and bitter, and he pulls his coat tighter, not bothering to charm it warmer since he’s so close to home. The street is quiet and empty, no one around to see him step out onto it as anyone with any sense already would have been home and in bed hours ago – Graves isn’t sure what that says about him.</p>
<p>Graves walks up the frosted steps to his door and lets himself in with two taps of his wand at the keyhole. The eldest son of his landlord, a young man of about twenty-one named Tanner Knobbs, is fast asleep at the front desk with gold and silver keys with wings flying lazily over his head and a spellbook on Apothecary nestled against his chest. Graves shuts the door loudly enough the boy snaps awake in a panic making the keys above him agitated.</p>
<p>Tanner is one of the few people Graves has ever known to look relieved to see him, but Coal Knobbs is notoriously strict in how his apartments are to be run, so Graves assumes he is the lesser of two evils.</p>
<p>“Evenin’ Mr. Graves,” Tanner yawns and bends over to pick up his book, only for his glasses to fall off his nose, “Another late night at the office?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Because Graves isn’t one for small talk, and from the way he feels his legs drag, it seems the fatigue has caught up to him with a vengeance.</p>
<p> He shuffles past the lobby desk to the main stairway when Tanner continues to speak, “Don’t you want to know if you have any mail?”</p>
<p>He’s a good tenant. He’s a good tenant and he shouldn’t hex his landlord’s son.</p>
<p>Graves bites back a sigh. “Do I have any mail?”</p>
<p>“No, sir,” Tanner replies far more cheerily than someone should be at this hour.</p>
<p>“Good.” And Graves stalks up the stairs before Tanner can bid him goodnight.</p>
<p>Graves opens the door to his apartment and is greeted with much needed solitude. Although he’s annoyed that Seraphina lorded her power to remove him from his office, Graves can admit that taking an hour or two for himself is something he’s missed in the last month over the case.</p>
<p>Graves has always lived with a minimalistic style. He’s never wanted nor needed a lot of material things, and the few extravagancies he does own are gifts he’s received from family and friends over the years, like the silver cauldron adorning the small kitchen table his father gave him when he started at Ilvermorny and the Persian rug in the hall gifted to him by his sister for making Auror.</p>
<p>His mother has accused it of being too impersonal, but Graves feels it reflects his tastes just fine; structured, clean, to the point. It may not be very homey, but it is his home.</p>
<p>Even with as weary as he truly feels now, Graves knows he’ll lay in bed awake for hours. The case is still on his mind, past, present, and future. He ducks into the kitchen and briefly contemplates food, but really anything left in his refrigerator has either gone off or gained sentience and that’s a problem he can tackle tomorrow.</p>
<p>Instead he goes to the cabinet above his sink and grabs a sleeping draught. Graves doesn’t like to rely on them to get him through the night, but sometimes sleep is more important.</p>
<p>He walks past a bookcase on the way to his room and picks up on the fine layer of dust that coats everything in the apartment. He grimaces and adds cleaning to tomorrow’s list.</p>
<p>Graves stumbles into his room and is overtaken by a yawn. He waves his coat, suit jacket, and waistcoat to the closet and doesn’t bother with changing out of the rest as he lies down, engulfed in a large bed with silk sheets – a luxury that would have to be pried from his cold, dead fingers.</p>
<p>The deco pattern and white paint of his ceiling stares down at him. The clock on his wall ticks softly. The mattress conforms beneath his weight. There is nothing to water, nothing to feed, no rousing plans for his time off tomorrow save to get his apartment back to pristine condition.</p>
<p>His mother has also mentioned how she’s afraid he’s lonely, but Graves disagrees. He likes his privacy, his solitude. He has his career, his position, his work. He can’t imagine being in anything other than Magical Law Enforcement – it fills his days with meaning and gives him something to do and will continue to do so for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>The blue vial of the sleeping draught catches a slice of moonlight peaking in through the blinds as Graves holds it over his face.</p>
<p>He enjoys his work, he does. Even on the nights he comes home to his quiet apartment, lies in his large bed, and faces the images of terrified eyes half-glazed with death and the sounds of horrible, wet, gasping breaths that play at the fringes of his mind alone.</p>
<p>Graves downs the potion and barely has enough time to lay his head back down before a dark, blissful sleep takes him.</p>
