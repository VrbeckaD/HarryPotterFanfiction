  <b>January 1979</b>
</p><p>Just as Sirius’ fingers slip into Remus’ waistband, Remus pulls away from the kiss. Sirius’ hand freezes where it is. He's about to ask “what's wrong” - because they really should get back to what they were doing - but he doesn't get a chance to speak.</p><p>“I don't do relationships,” Remus blurts out and it's so out of place that Sirius almost laughs. Until he remembers what they're doing and what that means. “It's just a shag, a one-time thing,” is what Remus is trying to say.</p><p>Sirius hadn't thought beyond this, beyond kissing that beautiful smile and touching every inch of Remus’ body and making him writhe and come undone underneath his--</p><p>He's getting distracted. Those hazel eyes are looking down at him worriedly. The pout on his kiss-swollen lips looks almost absurd, but is sexy enough to distract Sirius for another moment. Sirius clears his throat.</p><p>“Yeah.” He should probably say more. <i>Say something. Where has all your charm gone?</i></p><p>Sirius keeps staring at the half-naked man above him. Remus has him straddled still, and his disheveled hair and heaving chest aren't doing much for Sirius’ ability to think clearly about anything other than what he wants to do with that body.</p><p>“Me neither.” <i>‘Me neither’?! Good job, Black. Charming. Be careful, he might swoon and fall off the couch.</i></p><p>Remus gives Sirius a small smile, and looks relieved. After another beat, they’re kissing again.</p><p>-</p><p>
  <b>May 1979</b>
</p><p>Over the next few months, they fall into a rhythm: Whoever gets back from work first will turn on their lights to signal that they're home. The other will drop by if able. Unless they're too tired, or too late. <i>That</i> is indicated by the lights being turned back off. Sirius had once seen the flip <i>just</i> as he'd gotten home, and almost whined like a dog.</p><p>They sometimes have food, if one of them was in the middle of supper. They chat for a while, maybe half an hour. Then they have - <i>amazing, mind-blowing</i> - sex. Never in the bedroom, they never seem to manage to get there before their cocks are out. Maybe they share a post-orgasm fag, then they go to sleep in their own houses. Remus often says a hilariously polite “thank you” before leaving. Sirius can think of few things more endearing, and he’s puppy-sat before.</p><p>Sirius isn't looking for anything special. <i>Honestly, at our age, who is?</i> But it doesn't mean that he was seeking out a fuck-buddy either. At the time, all he'd thought was that he had been flirting on and off with his neighbor for weeks, and wouldn't he look just delicious moaning underneath him, or on top of him? He hadn't thought about rules, or boundaries. Not quite the Sirius Black style to care about or obey rules. And yet, Remus has silently set them up.</p><p>Sirius doesn’t want a relationship, but he does want to have conversations that last longer than all of five minutes before he has lips curled around his cock, he’s surprised to find. He doesn't want the sex to stop - Merlin and Circe, no - but he wants… He wants…</p><p>Remus’ lights turn on. Sirius glances at his watch. It's two in the morning. He gives it a few minutes to make sure the other man hasn’t just gotten up for water or the loo. After five minutes, he's convinced. He puts out his cigarette and doesn't bother grabbing a cloak before heading out.</p><p>When he knocks, Remus doesn't immediately answer, even though Sirius has heard his footsteps stop in front of the door before the Sirius even put his knuckles on the wood.</p><p>“Who is it?” comes a hoarse voice, barely audible.</p><p>“Remus?” Sirius asks, surprised at the tone. Then he realizes what that sounds like. “Er,” he amends, “It’s Sirius.” No further sound comes from the other side of the door for a few moments. “Your neighbor,” Sirius adds lamely.</p><p>Remus mutters something that sounds suspiciously like <i>cock</i>. “I’m not feeling very well, Sirius,” he says, a bit more loudly. He sounds fragile, and Sirius wonders if he has been crying. <i>What’s wrong? What happened?</i> A million thoughts are running through his head. It’s not a good thing for an Auror in training. He’s thinking of the worst things he has seen on the job, not simple explanations, such as Remus just having the flu.</p><p>“Your lights were on,” Sirius says, and puts a hand on the door, leaning against it. He has half a mind to vanish it. Remus has removed any wards that would keep Sirius out.</p><p>Sirius almost hears a chuckle, but it turns into a coughing fit too quickly to be sure. “I’m sorry,” Remus apologizes as he regains his breath.</p><p>“Remus, I-- Can you open the door?” He thinks he deserves a bloody medal for his patience but is old enough to know that the other man has no obligation to share anything with him. Sirius is nothing to him, barely a friend.</p><p>“Not tonight, Sirius. Go to bed.”</p><p>Sirius Black, for the first time he can remember since he was twelve, backs down.</p><p>“Goodnight, Remus.”</p><p>-</p><p>Remus doesn’t turn his living room lights on for the next few days, and his curtains are drawn. Sirius almost loses his mind and finally cracks, telling James and Peter about what’s been going on.</p><p>“So,” Peter says slowly, “You’ve been shagging your neighbor.” He seems perplexed about the whole deal, as if he’s never heard of sex before.</p><p>“Yes,” Sirius says impatiently. “That’s not even close to the point I was making, though.”</p><p>“You’re worried he doesn’t want to suck your cock anymore?” James asks, having the audacity to sound helpful.</p><p>“That’s not what I said,” Sirius says through gritted teeth. Why is he even <i>trying</i> to get advice from a boy who fell in love at twelve and another who has the most boring relationship that Sirius has ever heard of?</p><p>James gets up and flips his chair around before sitting back down, as if he is in some weird muggle movie. “You said he moved into the house next to yours. Then you started talking to him when he flirted with you--”</p><p>“Asked me about my bike,” Sirius cuts James off.</p><p>James rolls his eyes. “When he <i>flirted</i> with you,” he repeats. “Then you started shagging him. You got this weird cloak-and-dagger secret-spy code shit because you can’t have a normal shag like a normal bloke--”</p><p>“Hey!”</p><p>“<i>Then</i>,” James continues, not deigning Sirius’ protest with a reaction, “He - what did you say? Doesn’t leave the curtains open?”</p><p>“Turns on the lights,” Sirius mumbles, feeling stupid. James makes it all sound so <i>stupid</i> when it’s <i>not</i>.</p><p>“Right. Then he doesn’t turn on the lights, and you don’t get sex for going on three days. Have I got that about right?”</p><p>“As right as Cissy’s smile,” Sirius says darkly.</p><p>“What?” James and Peter both ask.</p><p>“Nevermind. You are-- You’re right, in your own gitish way.”</p><p>“I know you pull often, Sirius, but is three days really that bad?” Peter asks innocently, wiping his face with a cloth napkin as he finishes off a muffin.</p><p>Sirius doesn’t answer, but he knows his face is not hiding any of his emotions. He feels his expression shift and change, but he’s never been good at controlling his body, not when it comes to this, so he doesn’t even try. He feels James staring at him, studying him, and tries not to care.</p><p>“Pete, do you wanna go and see if Lily’s done in the garden?” James asks in that voice he only ever uses when he needs something from someone. Peter knows it well, but never fails to fall for it.</p><p>“Sure, Prongs.”</p><p>Sirius looks after him, almost wanting him to come back because if James has sent Peter away, they’re about to Talk.</p><p>“Sirius, what’s wrong?”</p><p><i>He’ll make a good father,</i> Sirius finds himself thinking. James’ question sounds sincere and, well, adult-like without being annoying.</p><p>“I think he was hurt.”</p><p>“You said you thought he was hiding something,” James says.</p><p><i>So <b>now</b> the knob remembers,</i> Sirius thinks, and glares at James. He’d been doing a bloody good job of pretending otherwise a few minutes ago. “Well, the thing he’s hiding is-- I think he was hurt.”</p><p>James looks at him, but doesn’t speak. He lets silence wrap around them, and doesn’t prod Sirius into speaking.</p><p>“I know you think I sound mad,” Sirius says in the end. He thinks so too.</p><p>James shakes his head. “I don’t think you sound mad, Sirius. I think you sound worried.”</p><p>“It was just a few sentences, I know, but… He sounded… He sounded <i>hurt</i>, Prongs. Physically hurt.” He pauses. “And it’s not about the three days without a shag - we’ve gone longer, when our schedules didn’t line up.” He takes a deep breath. “I <i>am</i>. Worried.” He raises his head to look at James again. He hadn’t even noticed his head drooping until now. “What’s wrong with me?”</p><p>“You like him,” James says casually, and takes a gulp of his beer.</p><p>Sirius blinks a few times in confusion. “I like him?” he repeats in a deadpan voice.</p><p>James nods, swallowing the last bit of his sip. “Yeah.”</p><p>“And that means I make up stories in my head about him getting hurt?” Sirius can’t tell whether or not James is taking the piss out of him.</p><p>“Before Lily and I - even now, really - I used to…” He takes another sip of his beer to buy some time. “When it comes to Lily, I always imagine the worst and the best. I don’t know how to explain it. If she is rubbing her head, I want to take her to St. Mungo’s right away, because dear Merlin, what if she has been cursed? If she smiles my way, I think she’s thinking of how in love she is, with me.” He shrugs. “When you fancy someone, it always seems so… Big…”</p><p><i>Like my cock,</i> Sirius adds quietly. It’s astounding how, even at a moment like this, his brain’s first reaction is penis jokes.</p><p>“I’ve fancied blokes before, James,” he sighs. He’s <i>nineteen</i> not <i>nine</i>.</p><p>To Sirius’ surprise, James shakes his head. “Not really. You’ve <i>wanted</i> people before - talked my ear off about that Fenwick bloke - but you haven’t been in love, or anything.”</p><p>“<i>‘In love’</i>,” Sirius scoffs. “We’re just having sex, not moving in together.”</p><p>James shrugs with both of his shoulders. “And this arrangement is because - what was his name? <i>Sheamus</i> - wants it that way.”</p><p>“Remus,” Sirius says absentmindedly, then frowns. “I suppose,” he concedes. It’s true that although Sirius had agreed wholeheartedly to sex without emotions, he hadn’t volunteered for it.</p><p>“I reckon you fancy him - more than just for shagging - and you don’t know what to do with yourself.”</p><p>Sirius glares at James, whose amused expression makes it look like he’s just barely holding back a snicker.</p><p>“Blimey, Pads,” James says with mock surprise, “And here I thought you were a Gryffindor.”</p><p>Sirius continues glaring, not bothering to answer. He supposes James is trying to insult his courage, but he doesn’t see how this relates to that.</p><p>“Grow some bollocks and tell him you want to go out with him. Sheesh. How is this even a problem?” James tilts his head and looks at Lily and Peter making their way back towards the house. “You’re supposed to be the most forward one, you know.”</p><p>“Says the man who asked a woman out dozens of times - for years - despite being hexed for his trouble. I don’t remember stooping that low to get <i>anyone</i>.”</p><p>“You know what I mean, arsehole,” James laughs, not at all offended at being reminded at his pursuit of Lily. It had all worked out, in the end.</p><p>“So I just… What, go over and ask him out?” he asks, playing with his beer glass that he has barely touched. He doesn’t like the stuff, why does he keep letting people give him pints of it?</p><p>“That’s often how it works, yes,” James says dryly, then laughs. “Am I giving Sirius Black advice on how to get laid?”</p><p>“By a bloke, no less,” Sirius shoots back with a bark of laughter. James has never been a homophobe, but this must be a bit far even for him.</p><p>“Don’t remind me,” James groans, but is still laughing.</p><p>-</p><p>Sirius catches Remus as he’s about to leave for work, just after six. Not that Sirius has gone out of his way to find that out. He just… Noticed the pattern.</p><p>“Oh!” the sandy-haired man says, when Sirius steps in front of him on the path in front of his house. “Hi, Sirius.” He gives him a small but sweet smile. Sirius wishes it didn't disarm him so easily. He wants to feel determined and annoyed, not sappy and randy.</p><p>“Good morning,” Sirius says with fake cheer. “Fancy a cup of tea?” <i>Tea? Are you fifty, Sirius? What are you even asking him? He’s leaving for work, he’s not going to turn around and--</i></p><p>“Ah, I have to get to work, I’m afraid.” Remus glances down at his watch. “I have a bus to catch in ten minutes, and it’s an eight minute walk, so…”</p><p>“Let’s walk together.”</p><p>Remus looks at Sirius, then at the road. He slowly draws his gaze back onto Sirius, and nods. “Sure,” he says lightly.</p><p>They talk idly on the way for the next few minutes. How has Remus’ mother been and has James finally convinced Lily that they should try for a baby, yet? It’s both comforting and unsettling, how easily this conversation comes to them. When you add all of their conversations together they wouldn’t equal half of what James and Sirius say to each other in a month, but somehow they’ve learned enough about each other’s lives to make this easy.</p><p>“I think I’ll finally get the weekend off, this time--” Sirius is saying when he’s cut off by a loud, pained “FUCK!” from Remus.</p><p>Noticing Remus stop, Sirius does as well, and looks at him in confusion. “Er- you alright?” Sirius looks around at the ground to see if Remus might have stubbed his toe on something.</p><p>“No, I just…” Remus’ voice trails off. “Getting old,” he says with a big smile. “I stepped on my foot wrong.” He seems genuine enough, but Sirius still finds it quite odd. Remus’ face is scrunched up and he is wincing a bit as he walks.</p><p>When the reach the bus stop, Sirius finally finds grit. “Remus, I was thinking… Do you want to have dinner, tonight?”</p><p>Remus studies Sirius’ face carefully for a few moments. “Why?” he asks, looking into Sirius’ eyes as if they are not in the middle of a crowded bus stop in London, as if they’re alone.</p><p>“Why not?” Sirius asks with a shrug, trying his best to look uninterested. The broody, aloof bad boy look used to come easy to him, but it feels out of place now, for some reason. “We both eat, might as well do it together.” <i>Don’t fidget. Don’t fidget.</i></p><p>“Sure,” Remus says softly then turns right to see if his bus is arriving. “That’s me,” he declares, and waves for the bus to stop.</p><p>“Later then.” Sirius tries telling his heart to stop beating so <i>fast</i>, as though it’s trying to get out of his <i>chest</i>, but it won’t listen. He stares after the bus for an embarrassingly long time before walking back home.</p><p>He should take him to that Indian place around the corner that James has approved of. He’s seen Remus eat take-away curry. Or maybe that new Ethiopian place - wouldn’t <i>that</i> seem cultured and interesting?</p><p>Remus has other ideas, however. When Remus finally makes his way home at eight, Sirius has been tapping his foot on the floor of his living room, fully dressed, for an hour. He waits with the patience of Merlin himself until Remus <i>finally</i> turns the lights on. He’s probably out the door before Remus’ finger is off of the switch.</p><p>This time, it doesn’t take long for Remus to open the door. He’s grinning as he gives Sirius a once-over. “Going somewhere?” he asks slyly.</p><p>“Sirius Black doesn’t go out in public looking anything less than dashing,” Sirius confirms with a shit-eating grin of his own.</p><p>“I’m sure he doesn’t,” Remus says, amused, then steps aside. “You coming in?”</p><p>“Weren’t we going out to dinner?” Sirius tries not to sound disappointed, but his smile drops. They had <i>deal</i>, didn’t they?</p><p>“I thought-- I thought I might make us something to eat, instead,” Remus says, chewing on his bottom lip and, <i>oh</i>, a gorgeous flush colors his cheeks.</p><p>Sirius’ grin is back and possibly even bigger than before. “In that case, step aside.” He walks in as if he owns the place, and Remus chuckles, following after him.</p><p>The dinner is a humble but delicious shepherd’s pie. An odd choice for a date, Sirius thinks, but can’t complain about the taste. Halfway through the meal, as Remus pauses to drink water, Sirius grabs his free hand, and holds it above the table. Remus raises an eyebrow and looks at their hands. He doesn’t move his hand away, but is still looking at it when he puts down his glass.</p><p>Sirius, for his part, can’t do much else other than look at that handsome - alright, maybe not traditionally handsome, but <i>very attractive</i> - face. Does Remus chew on his lips on purpose every day, to get them puffy like that?</p><p>“Er-- Sirius--” he stutters, as he draws back his hand. “Is this--” He looks up at Sirius worriedly, as if he’s a stray dog that might attack him.</p><p><i>Well, in a way</i>… Sirius thinks, and laughs at his own joke. This makes Remus look at him with even more worry, and now a dash of confusion.</p><p>“This isn’t a date,” Remus says curtly, bringing Sirius back to real life so fast he thinks he might have whiplash.</p><p>Sirius looks around the room as if waiting for people to jump out and yell “surprise!”. Then, he looks at Remus again. “It’s not?” he asks.</p><p>Remus sighs, and gets up, frowning. “Sirius, I told you, I don’t--”</p><p>“That was <i>months</i> ago.”</p><p>“And you thought the fact that I never have relationships might have changed in the last few months?” Remus says angrily. He reels back instantly, and shakes his head as if shaking his anger away. When he speaks again, his voice is calm and his expression blank. “I don’t do relationships, Sirius. If that’s what you want, I can’t give it to you.”</p><p>“But why not?” Sirius challenges, getting up as well. Is it bad that even now, when he’s looking at the throbbing vein on Remus’ neck, all he wants is to kiss him? “We get along, we have fantastic sex - what more do you want to start dating someone?”</p><p>“Things might be that easy for you, but they aren’t for everyone,” Remus says bitterly.</p><p>“Hippogriff shit! It’s as easy as you let it be, Remus. Going out on a few dates won’t kill you.” He finds he is angrier than he had thought, and wishes he had kept his voice a little lower when Remus cowers back. He’s still breathing fast, but his anger hasn’t subsided nearly enough for him to apologize. <i>What do I have to apologize for? He’s the one being unreasonable.</i></p><p>“I told you what I wanted, and you need to respect that,” Remus says coldly, looking at a random spot on the floor determinedly.</p><p>“And if I want more?” Sirius growls.</p><p>“You’ll get it somewhere else,” Remus says firmly.</p><p>“I don’t <i>want</i> someone else.” He’s exasperated, and sounds it. They’ve been dancing around this since they first saw each other, Sirius realizes, so why is Remus fighting it with such ferocity?</p><p>“We were meant to be neighbors who have sex now and again.” Remus’ voice is mostly calm, but there’s the obvious lilt of frustration in it. “Not whatever you want this to be.”</p><p>“And why not?” Remus opens his mouth to respond, but Sirius doesn’t let him. “What, you have a busy schedule? Have too much of a social life to fit a boyfriend in there?” He’s snarling and it’s childish, he knows, but he can’t bring himself to care. He has many gifts, and cruelty is one of them. He can almost always find the most painful thing to say, without even putting in any effort. He hadn’t given it much thought until the words had come out of his mouth. And now he knows that Remus’ loneliness <i>is</i> a sore spot because there’s sadness in those big green eyes.</p><p>“I don’t recall you complaining about the lack of company I keep when it meant you get to have sex every night.” Remus sounds conversational. Sirius can still see that he’s hurt. His face is calm, but his eyes are too expressive to hide anything.</p><p>Sirius laughs darkly. “I could pull every night with or without you.” He watches something flicker in Remus’ eyes, and delights in seeing the other man’s hands curl into fists. “Not as convenient, I admit,” he continues cruelly, “Being ten feet away from it before I even put on my trousers, not having to buy you drinks, not having to listen to boring chatter for long...” He can list more, but Remus has dropped his gaze, and Sirius knows he’s almost won. “Terribly convenient,” he concludes, then pauses to let the venom sink in.</p><p>Remus is quiet for a while, looking around the room with idle interest, as if he were at a gallery. Sirius watches him, and feels his breathing and heart beat slow down. It’s always so odd, this time <i>after</i>. After he hurts someone, <i>after</i> he breaks something.</p><p>“I think perhaps you should go,” Remus says softly. Sirius is about to agree when Remus gives him a small smile.</p><p><i>That damned smile</i>, Sirius thinks, eyes widening. He thinks of all the times he was given that smile - must have been dozens - and what it might have meant. It’s fake, he knows now. How often has Remus been fake smiling at him? He feels angry again, and opens his mouth to speak, but Remus cuts him off.</p><p>“Look, Sirius, I understand why you’re upset.” He sounds infuriatingly calm. Sirius would punch him except he loves those cheekbones and it would be such a shame to ruin them. “We both need to calm down, and--”</p><p>“You seem awfully calm.” Sirius keeps his angry eyes fixed on Remus’ tired-looking ones.</p><p>“I just know how this goes, Sirius. I can’t do relationships. As annoying as this--” He gestures between the two of them. “Might seem to you, I’d rather do this ten times over than what I know would happen if we tried to have a relationship.” He sighs wearily. “You’re wonderful, Sirius. Handsome, funny, smart... This isn’t about you, so don’t get offended. It’s me who doesn’t do relationships.”</p><p>“And why not?”</p><p>“It ends badly.”</p><p>“So far, maybe. You don’t know how it would be with me.”</p><p>“Yes I do,” Remus says miserably, and Sirius almost - <i>almost</i> - feels bad for him. Remus is looking at the floor again, obviously caught up in a flashback.</p><p>“Fuck this,” Sirius growls, and grabs his jacket. Before he leaves the kitchen, he turns around to face Remus. “Does this mean--” He <i>hates</i> that he feels the need to ask this. “Can we still…?”</p><p>“If you can.” Remus shrugs, still not looking up.</p><p>Once again Sirius is suddenly by Remus’ side, kissing him. It’s different than every other time they’ve done this before. It’s not passionate and fun like it usually is, nor rough and playful like they sometimes get. Sirius keeps kissing Remus because he doesn’t want his lips to be free, he doesn’t want to hear whatever Remus is thinking. He just wanted to kiss him and fuck him because Merlin he might not be allowed to even have <i>one</i> date with the man but he can claim him all he wants with sex. He knows Remus isn’t seeing other people, he’s Sirius’ in at least one way that matters.</p><p>Sirius has Remus on the table. Forget getting distracted by the falling china, he gets motivated further with everything that falls and breaks. He has noticed that Remus doesn’t have much furniture or even cutlery, and as he pushes Remus’ face down onto the table and a glass falls onto the ground, shattering to pieces, he barely stops himself from shouting out “yes”. <i>Reparo won't help with that</i>, he thinks with satisfaction.</p><p>Remus comes before him, which is not too much of a surprise with how distracted Sirius is by his thoughts. He’s too focused on the way Remus’ cheek and palms are scraping the wood to be lost in the sensation of being <i>in</i> him. Eventually he manages to come, out of breath and sweaty all over.</p><p>When Remus gets up and turns around, there is no malice or fury in his expression. This wasn’t hate-sex or fight-sex for him. At least it doesn’t seem that way. Sirius feels more confused than ever.</p><p>“Same time tomorrow?” Remus asks after a minute’s silence and they both laugh. It’s absurd, this thing.</p><p><i>What the hell is going on here?</i> Sirius wonders as he lights up a cigarette. Remus doesn’t share, this time, but sits with Sirius by the window as he smokes.</p><p>Remus is still shirtless and the streetlight’s light hits him just right to accentuate his scars. A sudden, dark thought occurs to Sirius. “What did he do to you?” he asks.</p><p>Remus turns to him, startled. “What?” he asks.</p><p>“This-- This person that makes you think you can’t have a bloody relationship. What did they do?” he asks dangerously. His eyes keep lingering on the crisscrossed scars all over the other man’s body. Why had it never occurred to him?</p><p>Remus notices, and puts his sweater back on. “He left,” he says quietly.</p><p>“How did you get your scars?” Sirius asks bluntly.</p><p>“Why do you care? Weren’t we keeping things light?” Remus responds, but his voice is quiet and the ghost of a smile is on his face.</p><p>“We’re past that, I think,” Sirius chuckles darkly. “So?”</p><p>“No boyfriend did this, if that’s what you’re asking.” <i>It is.</i></p><p>“Who then?”</p><p>“You’re a wizard, you can figure it out.” Remus curls up into himself a bit, and faces away from Sirius, staring out of the window.</p><p>Sirius’ head is spinning. A magical incident? There are so many things that it could be, from potions to herbs to hexes. Remus is making it sound like a puzzle that could be solved, so there must be other clues.</p><p>“I was hoping you would never ask,” Remus says softly. Then, he turns to Sirius and looks at his hand. He sounds distant, but not sad. “I should get to bed. You know where the door is by now, I suspect. Goodnight.” He gives Sirius a kiss on the forehead, and retreats to his bedroom.</p><p>Sirius is too curious about the puzzle he’s been given to respond, or be offended at being unceremoniously kicked out.</p><p>
  <i>I’m a wizard. I can figure this out.</i>
</p><p>-</p><p>
  <b>June 1979</b>
</p><p>It’s surprisingly easy to pick up where they had left off. Sirius doesn’t ask Remus out again, and their evening (and sometimes early morning) rendezvous continue with less than ten minutes of talking beforehand.</p><p>Only this time, Sirius doesn’t hold back his Auror instincts anymore. He no longer considers himself paranoid, but on an investigation.</p><p>One night, he binds Remus and kisses and licks him all over in an apparent game of fantasy (and, to be fair, it <i>is</i> also hot and fun), but what he’s really doing is mapping out the scars, trying to see if there’s a pattern to them. Remus moans, growls and begs. <i>We really should get kinkier</i>, Sirius thinks. But as soon as he thinks that and imagines spanking Remus, his mind is brought back to Remus’ scars, and the secret Sirius is trying to uncover.</p><p>In three short weeks, Sirius knows the following:</p><p>	•	Most of the scars are variations of two or three parallel lines, animal claw marks, though they are inconsistent in size and structure.<br/>
•	One scar, the biggest one, on Remus’ back left thigh, is the same color as most of the rest, but is not linear. It resembles, if anything, a bite.<br/>
•	They did not all happen at the same time.</p><p>The last part is the worst of it. Even images of cursed bears attacking Remus isn’t as painful as the thought that it wasn’t a single incident. This… this <i>kept</i> happening to him, whatever it was. <i>Whoever</i> it was. The more Sirius thinks about it, the less he can imagine it being a simple classroom mishap or wild animal attack.</p><p>A thought occurs to him - a strange thought that he never would have imagined having:</p><p>
  <i>I hope I never figure out who did this to you.</i>
</p><p>He doesn’t know what he would do, but it wouldn’t be anything good. Whatever it would be, Remus wouldn’t appreciate it. Sirius might have only a piece of the other man, but he’s determined to keep it. Determined to have those long, elegant hands and soft brown curls in his life. He hates the thought of never getting to see or touch Remus again.</p><p>
  <i>Bloody hell, I <b>am</b> in love, aren’t I?</i>
</p><p>He’s not sure what’s worse: That Potter was right, or that he’s in love with a man who won’t love him back.</p><p>He wonders when that happened. Sure, they’d had chemistry and yes, the attraction was obviously there, that’s why he has slept with the man exclusively for months, and asked him out. But <i>love?</i> When had <i>that</i> snuck in?</p><p>Sirius settles down on his couch, and turns towards the window, the one that faces Remus’ own living room. He lights a cigarette watches Remus sleep with the book laying on his chest. Sirius’ own chest feels the weight of it, and he tries not to dwell on the feelings he’s getting, staring at the other man through the windows.</p><p>-</p><p>They manage to sync up their schedules two days later, when Remus drops by and immediately kisses Sirius. Remus is gentle, and more compliant than usual. He even lets Sirius take him to the bedroom. <i>One more thing to note,</i> Sirius thinks, <i>Did they do whatever it was in a bedroom? Is he scared of them?</i></p><p>He tests this theory by throwing Remus onto the bed and towering over him as menacingly as he can, naked with a hard-on. All Remus does is give a little chuckle, and smile. He doesn’t seem bothered at all. <i>Then why have I been getting aches all over, having sex in living rooms and kitchens?</i> Sirius wonders, and strikes out the bullet point from his mental list. Whatever happened to Remus, it has nothing to do with--</p><p>Remus has new scars.</p><p>Not new cuts, new <i>scars</i>. Sirius pulls back further up, and sits back with his two legs around Remus’ body. Remus’ shirt is off by this point, and he’s working on getting his trousers unzipped to catch up with Sirius’ state of undress. Any other time, Sirius would either not look at all, lost in their snogging, or stare at Remus with hunger. Now, he’s looking with confusion and a touch of fear.</p><p>It takes Remus a few seconds to realize that Sirius is frozen on the spot. When he does, he stops fiddling with his fly and looks up at Sirius. “Sirius?” he asks tentatively. Sirius can’t even imagine what his expression must look like, but it can’t be pleasant if Remus is giving him that look.</p><p>“Where were you?” Sirius asks, and runs his fingers over a new scar on Remus’ collarbone. Remus hisses in pain. <i>Scars don’t hurt</i>, Sirius thinks, getting more confused by the second.</p><p>“Er-- Today? I was at work, I had to close the shop so I was late and…” Remus’ voice drifts off. He knows that’s not what Sirius is asking.</p><p>“No, earlier. When we couldn’t meet because you had to <i>revise</i> because we’re apparently still at school. When you closed your curtains for <i>days</i>.”</p><p>Remus takes a deep breath, and closes his eyes. “I should go.”</p><p>Sirius pointedly shifts himself on top of Remus, showing that he has no intention of letting that happen. His erection is already lost, but he won’t get off of Remus, not until he has answers. “You should answer my question,” he says dangerously.</p><p>“I don’t have to tell you anything,” Remus says defensively, and looks away.</p><p>“No,” Sirius agrees. “But I want you to.” His fingers hover over one of the new scars again, but he doesn’t touch it. “Who does this to you?”</p><p>Remus squeezes his eyes shut. “Sirius, it’s fine. If-- If it bothers you then I’ll keep my shirt on, I--”</p><p>“That’s not what I said,” Sirius spits out. Is Remus insecure? Is that it? Feeling inadequate next to Sirius, the handsome pureblood? Because that’s ridiculous, Remus is all Sirius wants. “Remus, do you do this to yourself?” he asks quietly, thinking of that one woman they had had to have committed, that was hexing boils on herself. She had said that it was because she hated herself.</p><p>Remus’ eyes spread open immediately, and widen in shock. It’s the look of somebody who’s been caught, not somebody appalled by a shocking suggestion. He’s still avoiding looking at Sirius.</p><p><i>Oh Remus, tell me that’s not it.</i> Sirius feels his guts tangle themselves, and wants to throw up.</p><p>Remus slowly turns his head back to Sirius, and studies his face, the way he does sometimes when Sirius says something - Sirius could never figure out what triggers it. He had thought he got that look whenever he got close to Remus’ secret, and now, with a sinking feeling, he realizes he must have been right.</p><p>“Why would you ask that?” Remus asks, still staring at Sirius’ face, trying to read something in his eyes and Sirius doesn’t know what, so he tries to look back as kindly as he can.</p><p>“There was a woman, she…” Sirius’ eyes dart toward Remus’ chest again before looking him in the eyes. “She would hurt herself, hex her arms and legs to feel pain.” He feels that’s enough of an explanation, and Remus’ frown says that it is.</p><p>“I do, but not like you think. Not because I want to.”</p><p>“I’m sure she didn’t want to either. It’s an illness, Remus, you can go to St. Mungo’s and--”</p><p>Remus laughs darkly. “St. Mungo’s can’t fix me, Sirius.”</p><p>“Remus, I don't think any less of you,” Sirius says, as calmly as he can manage. He tries to remember more from his training about dealing with victims, but his mind is blank.</p><p>Remus gives Sirius an odd, almost condescending look, then sighs. “You should get off of me for this. Put some pants on. Maybe even trousers. You should <i>definitely</i> get your wand.”</p><p>At least five different sentences of protest - most of them including expletives - cross through Sirius’ mind, but he puts his boxers back on, and grabs his wand.</p><p>“Well?” he demands once he is seated on the edge of the bed, looking at Remus who is sitting as well, as far as he can be from Sirius.</p><p>“I'm a werewolf,” Remus says curtly.</p><p>“You're a what now?”</p><p>“A werewolf,” Remus says, raising an eyebrow. He glances down at Sirius’ hand and Sirius realizes he's gripping it rather tightly now. Remus doesn't seem bothered by it, or scared at all, even though Sirius is an Auror.</p><p>
  <i>And why would he be? I can't arrest a person for being a werewolf.</i>
</p><p><i>But you could kill him</i>, a traitorous, vile part of his brain supplies. <i>There is no penalty for killing a dark creature.</i></p><p>Sirius looks at Remus for a while, his mind trying to wrap itself around the fact that the gentle, kind bookshop clerk neighbor being a bloodthirsty beast like Fenrir Greyback.</p><p>“And that's when you do it,” Sirius finds himself saying, only half aware of the stream of consciousness that lead to the words.</p><p>“Do what?” Remus asks, amused.</p><p>“The scars. You claw at yourself.”</p><p>“Oh,” Remus says, blinking. “Yes.”</p><p>Sirius nods to himself. “Why?”</p><p>“Because I have nothing else to claw at,” Remus says simply.</p><p>“Do you transform at the Ministry?” Sirius asks, wondering if it would be rude to get up to grab a cigarette now. He left his pack all the way in the kitchen.</p><p>“I--” Remus starts answering, then stops. “Are we really talking about the technicalities of my lycanthropy?” He stares at Sirius, confused.</p><p>Sirius shrugs. “Seems fair that we should, doesn’t it? I mean, I had a crash-course on werewolves but it covered only the bare basics, it was barely two days. Unless you specialize, they don’t teach you much about them, doesn’t really come up in most Aurors’ lives. And even if it did, I doubt they would mention the things I want to know.”</p><p>“Like what?” Remus asks, guarded.</p><p>“I’ve only ever seen two others. One was a young woman, just after she was bitten. The other, Greyback. They looked quite different as you can imagine. And you, you don’t look like either of them.” He shrugs again, not knowing what else to do with his body, then starts playing with his fingers absentmindedly. “Not to say that it needs to change your appearance but, well… Shouldn’t you be hairier?”</p><p>“‘Hairier’?” Remus repeats dumbly. Sirius nods, fast, a few times. “You want to know why I’m not hairy?”</p><p>“Well not <i>why</i>, just… Was it recent? Will your body change?”</p><p>“Not really,” Remus says slowly, still confused. “I mean, I get more scars a lot of the times I transform, but other than that…” His voice trails off.</p><p>“Good,” Sirius says with a lopsided grin. “I like your body.”</p><p>Remus’ eyes dart around the floor, as if he is looking for something he’s dropped. “Maybe I should go,” he says carefully.</p><p>“It’s fine if you don’t want to talk about it now, but we will need to, at some point,” Sirius says thoughtfully, then scoots closer to Remus. “For now, I’d rather go back to what we were doing.”</p><p>“You want to have sex? <i>Now?</i>” Remus asks incredulously.</p><p>“No time like the present,” Sirius says with a laugh.</p><p>“You’re mad,” Remus says, bit the left corner of his mouth is twitching as if he’s holding back a smile.</p><p>“Does run in the family,” Sirius says, nodding. Then he moves closer, and puts a hand on Remus’ thigh.</p><p>Remus takes a deep breath. “Well, alright then.”</p><p>When they’re done, neither of them make a move to get up. Sirius looks sideways at Remus who has one arm over his head, covering his eyes, as he is catching his breath. Sirius smiles. Remus will probably spend the night. The thought of waking up with him makes Sirius happier than he expected.</p><p>After a short rest, they both turn to their sides and look at each other, running their hands lazily over each other’s bodies.</p><p>“I can’t cook,” Sirius starts suddenly, “But I do know some excellent restaurants around here.”</p><p>Remus gives him a look. “You’re hungry?”</p><p>“Not <i>now</i>, of course.” Sirius waves a hand in the air dismissively before returning it to settle down on Remus’ side. “For our date.”</p><p>Remus’ smile drops, and he sighs. “Sirius--”</p><p>“Obviously you were holding out because of your…” Sirius waves his hand in the air again, this time gesturing a circle. “Furry little problem. Now with that secret out of the way, I don’t see why--”</p><p>“It’s not <i>‘out of the way’</i>, Sirius. It’s what I am.” Remus sounds more confused than angry.</p><p>“Sure. Right. So I think Italian is the classic choice, but there’s this brilliant Indian place right around the corner.”</p><p>“Sirius, do you really not care?” Remus asks tentatively.</p><p>“Of course I care, you git,” Sirius says with an uncharacteristically soft tone. “I’m already thinking of where you’ll transform this month because whatever the Ministry has, it can’t be that good, and I <i>know</i> I can do better. Of course I care.”</p><p>Remus gulps audibly. Sirius tries not to think about licking and sucking at his neck. “But you want to date me, still?”</p><p>“Remus,” Sirius sighs with the impatience of Kettleburn teaching first years, “You could have told me you were related to me, and I would still want you.”</p><p>The werewolf furrows his brows and pulls his neck back a little. “What?”</p><p><i>Right</i>, Sirius thinks. <i>He doesn’t know about the Black family traditions or how deeply I hate them.</i></p><p>“I would want to be with you even if you actually <i>had</i> a big dark secret.”</p><p>“And being a...family member... is worse to you than being a <i>werewolf</i>, a dark creature?” Remus laughs.</p><p>“Yeah,” Sirius responds with a grin. “You haven’t met my family - thank Merlin.”</p><p>Remus seems to think this over, and Sirius waits all of a minute before his patience runs out, and he gives the side of Remus’ lips a quick peck. The werewolf chuckles in return, and turns to Sirius with that mind-melting smile of his.</p><p>“Well, that’s not how I imagined this conversation would go,” Remus says, raising his eyebrows. “I mean, of course I knew you’d figure it out eventually, you’re an <i>Auror,</i> but I thought you would, you know… Stop this.” His eyes go back and forth between them.</p><p>“Couldn’t if I wanted to,” Sirius says honestly. “I don’t know what you’ve done to me, Remus Lupin, but somewhere between meeting you painting the outside of your house <i>blue</i> of all colors and shoving my tongue into your mouth on a daily basis, I…” <i>You’re a Gryffindor</i>. “I got hooked. You’ve got me.”</p><p>Remus slowly rolls on top of Sirius, not stopping smiling for a moment, then looks down at him affectionately. Sirius pulls him down for a kiss. “Round two, then?” he whispers mischievously when their lips finally part.</p><p>Remus lets out a deep, happy laugh. “You’re mad, Sirius.”</p><p>“Yes, runs in the family.”</p><p>-</p><p>
  <b>January 1980</b>
</p><p>“Lily’s pregnant,” James blurts out. Lily smacks him on the back of his neck.</p><p>“Potter!” she scolds. “We had a <i>plan!”</i></p><p>“Lily, I can’t help it!” James moans. “You’ve already shut me up for <i>months</i>.” He turns back to Sirius. “It’s been <i>killing</i> me mate, I swear I wanted to tell you. Every day.”</p><p>Sirius rolls his eyes. “Calm down, James, and stop bouncing in your seat. You’re going to wet yourself.” He looks at his fidgeting best friend and his wife with a grin. “A mini Potter, eh?”</p><p>“Maybe he’ll have enough Evans in him to have <i>some</i> resemblance of normality,” Lily says gravely, although she’s smiling.</p><p>“Congratulations, Lily,” Remus says kindly, and raises his wine glass for a toast. “To Lily and James, and the little sprog to come!”</p><p>They laugh and clink their glasses. Sirius looks to his right, staring at Remus openly. He knows tonight is about James and Lily - and the little monster growing inside her. But he can’t help but think of Remus. Because that’s who he thinks about now, when he thinks of happiness and family and warmth. Remus notices he’s being watched and looks back at Sirius. He smiles, and Sirius wonders how he ever thought he had a chance to not fall for Remus.</p><p>He leans in and gives Remus a quick kiss. Remus doesn’t resist, but he’s shaking his head when they pull apart. “Sirius, we’re with company,” he says, but there’s no energy behind his words.</p><p>
  <i>He’s happy too.</i>
</p><p>“I should be allowed a discretion or two on our anniversary,” Sirius says defiantly.</p><p>Remus stares at him like an owl, confused.</p><p>“Anniversary?” Lily asks, then takes a drink of her pumpkin juice.</p><p><i>No wonder she’s not having wine, I hadn’t thought of it until now,</i> Sirius thinks idly. “Yes,” he says, “The anniversary of when I met this beast.”</p><p>“Would you <i>please</i> stop calling me that?” Remus groans, rubbing the bridge of his nose.</p><p>“Not until you stop reacting adorably to it,” Sirius says, matter-of-factly. Then, he shoots Lily a big grin. “This gauche git was painting his house <i>blue</i> and I had to put a stop to it, so I walked over and introduced myself.”</p><p>Remus’ eyes are still wide, and he blinks a few times, reminding Sirius even more of an owl. “What, this day last year? Exactly?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Sirius says casually, looking away.</p><p>“Bloody hell, how do you remember?” James asks.</p><p><i>How could I forget when I met him?</i> Sirius wonders, glad that he is not a blusher. He sees Remus’ face reddening by the second. “’Twas the day I passed the first exam with Moody.”</p><p>James nods in understanding. “Ah, right.”</p><p>Sirius doesn’t feel like being sappy and going on about Remus outside of their small but comfortable bedroom. Least of all on a night that’s meant to be about the next generation, not them. Sirius clears his throat. “Anyway, congratulations on finally knocking this one up,” he says, nodding over at Lily. Lily giggles and shakes her head.</p><p>By the time they finish eating and Sirius is helping Lily with the dishes, he can’t help but feel an odd sense of completeness, coupled with something akin to eagerness. He feels as if they’re on the edge of something, but he can’t tell what. It’s been a year since he’s met Remus and they have settled into a sort of domestic life already. Now James and Lily are adding a little Marauder into their midst. Everything feels complete, for the first time in his life, and yet he’s giddy with excitement.</p><p>“I think next year, we should spend New Year’s Eve in London,” James is telling Remus when Lily and Sirius walk into the living room. Lily quickly settles next to James, and puts her head on his shoulder. Sirius sits in an armchair close to Remus.</p><p>That does sound like a good idea. Next year, they’ll stay in London, take James and Lily somewhere close to where Sirius and Remus live. Sirius looks at Remus, and smiles. And the year after that, maybe they’ll go to South of France instead, escape the bitter cold of England. Because there <i>will</i> be a next year, with Remus beside him. Many next years. He’ll make sure of it.</p></div>
