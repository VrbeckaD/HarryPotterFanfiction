    <p>Spider Miles held few fond memories for Doflamingo, yet he often found himself thinking he was fond of the place. It had been the Donquixote Pirates base of operations for 6 years before they'd claimed Dressrosa. Three years before that, Doflamingo had killed his own brother. Two years before that, Sugar and Monet had joined the Donquixote Pirates. A few months after Rosinante had left with Law on his half-a-year roundtrip, Trebol had had her get rid of a traitor in their ranks. Doflamingo hadn't much cared, he'd just wanted to know who the destroyed room belonged to inside their Headquarters. He didn't receive a name, just that it had been a traitor and Trebol had decided to take care of it before it got out of hand, which was why Doflamingo had no notes on the subject.</p><p>	Doflamingo had no reason to doubt his most trusted, if not also most annoying, subordinate and let the matter be. </p><p>He'd regret it deeply 13 years later.</p><p>	Doflamingo had a lot of questions pertaining to the first three years on Spider Miles. Why had he suddenly stopped meddling in human trafficking? Drug dealing? Why had he treated Law as a son? Why had he felt much more fond of his time there those first years, yet suddenly stopped right after Rosinante left with Law? Why had he been declining most of Trebol's plans during those three years before his brother's betrayal? Why did he feel so betrayed by a brother he hadn't seen in almost two decades? Why did he <em>care</em> so much for a brother he hadn't seen in almost two decades? Why did he have a spare set of sunglasses resembling those he'd worn as a child? Where had the strange golden locket around his neck come from and why did he keep it? And where had his feather mantle disappeared to 13 years ago? He'd had to get a new one, which took <em>months</em>. It had been annoying. He was still very peeved about it. And most importantly, why <em>did</em> he want immortality?</p><p>He didn't know it, but all these questions could be answered by the one Trebol had claimed to be a traitor. Doflamingo, however, did not know this, and would not know this, until Sugar was knocked out by Sogeking Usopp when The StrawHeart Pirate Alliance stormed Dressrosa.
</p><p>But until then, all he had were unanswered questions and an unexplainable ache in his heart.</p><p>	Trafalgar Law had very confusing memories of his time with the Donquixote Pirates. On one hand, he remembered being happy, but on the other hand, he couldn't remember a single reason <em>why</em> he'd been happy. He was also positive he'd only had two years to live with how bad his Amber Lead disease was, yet he'd only gotten rapidly worse after two-<em>and-a-half</em> years. Somehow, he'd actually had a year more than he'd originally estimated. He was also sure Cora-san had said something about someone saying it would be fine, then never mentioning it again a few months later, acting as if no one on Spider Miles had been told prior to their departure. Three years after the death of Cora-san Law had gone and tattooed a pair of feathered wings on his back. He still wasn't sure why.</p><p>	There was also an odd feeling of sadness surrounding him constantly, not to mention an aching in his chest he knew wasn't caused by any illness or injury, old or new. Then there was the song. He could never remember the words or accurately mimic the melody, but he was sure he'd recognize it if he ever heard it.</p><p>	He had no way of knowing all would be answered when he asked to form an alliance with Straw Hat Luffy.</p><p>

</p><p>He was on deck guarding Ceasar when he heard it. The melody was familiar and while at first he didn't recognize it, something clicked and he turned to look at the source of the humming. The Straw Hatted menace he'd allied himself with out of desperation (and, if he stopped lying to himself, familiarity and hope that Mugiwara-ya would pull off an unexplainable victory somehow, like he always did) was happily humming and swinging his arms as he walked passed.</p><p>“Mugiwara-ya.” The Surgeon of Death called, causing the other to stop and turn his head toward him.</p><p>“What, Torao?”</p><p>“That song you were humming...”</p><p>“Ah, that? I can't remember the words, but Mama always sang it to me and Ace as a lullaby. I think it's about jellyfish or something, not sure, I always fell asleep pretty fast, hehe!”</p><p>That last bit sparked something in Law's memory and he raised a hand to massage away the headache “I swear I've heard it before... but I can't remember how... or where.”</p><p>Mugiwara tilted his head in confusion, before he hit his palm with his fist “Ah! You're from North Blue, right?”</p><p>“Yes...” Law wondered how the hell that was in any way relevant.</p><p>“Then you might've met Mama from before the curse!”</p><p>Law blinked, he didn't particularly believe in magic “Curse?” he nevertheless inquired, only half-expecting a real answer.</p><p>Straw Hat nodded “Yeah, Mama lived in North Blue with his husband and kid, but someone named Candy or something and a snot man attacked him and cursed him so everyone who knew him forgot! So you might've known Mama from before he got cursed and that's why you can't remember!”</p><p>Law sat there with narrowed eyes, immediately thinking of two people the descriptions matched “That makes an annoying amount of sense. And it's not Candy, it's Sugar, and the “snot man” is Trebol. It seems you too have something to gain from this alliance.”</p><p>The younger of the two blinked, not understanding what he was talking about, before his eyes widened “Oh! I can avenge Mama! Yay!”</p><p>“Urgh...” Law once again regretted making the alliance (not really) and longed for the time before this walking headache inducer (liar).</p><p>(Law lied to himself a lot. It was frighteningly effective nowadays.)</p><p>(He really should do something about that.)</p><p>
  <em>Somewhere far away, a raven-haired man with white and gold wings looked at a starry sky with sad emerald eyes, tracing patterns as he thought of cold nights lying in bed, surrounded by strong arms. He looked into his dwelling, at a figure cocooned in a hazy white shroud of energy and bit his lip as the shroud wavered and thinned. Looking at his hands, which were shaking, he could only think one thought:</em>

  <em>'I'm dying soon...'</em>
