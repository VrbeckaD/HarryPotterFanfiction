    <p>Chapter 1</p><p>Hermione pulled off the hood of her cloak and brushed her hair away from her face.  Per the instructions in a letter she had received via owl post the morning before, she had walked briskly from Hogwarts after dinner to the Three Broomsticks.  Although she’d made the walk many times over the years, it seemed longer tonight without companions.  It was not yet dark, but she’d kept her hand firmly wrapped around her wand in the pocket of her robes the entire way down.  A few months of apparent peace was not enough to convince her that she was safe.  After a year on the run, she found that old habits died hard.</p><p>She nodded at Madam Rosmerta as she walked through the restaurant of the Three Broomsticks.  She didn’t bother to check the letter she had received for instructions.  She had memorized what it said already, having found herself pulling it out in two of her classes.  It was not becoming of the Head Girl, but she was curious.  It had read:</p><p> </p><p>Dear Ms. Hermione Granger,</p><p>Best wishes as you start your final year at Hogwarts.  We are aware you are busy, but Mr. Oberon Alton would like to request your assistance with a matter of some sensitivity.  When the subject was discussed with trainee Auror Potter, he recommended your name due to personal experience and insight you could provide to the matter at hand.</p><p>If you are willing to be of assistance, Unspeakable Madley-Lima will be waiting for you in Room 304 of the Three Broomsticks.</p><p>Please send your reply with this owl,</p><p>Ruby Wakefield<br/>Secretary to Oberon Gregory Alton, Head of the Department of Mysteries</p><p> </p><p>Hermione walked up the stairs to the third floor, the carpet muffling the sound of her footsteps.  Room 304 was two doors down from the stairwell on her left.  Squaring her shoulders, she tapped her knuckles on the door three times in quick succession.</p><p>She could hear the footfalls of somebody walking towards her on the other side of the door.  A few seconds later there was the sound of a chain and the door opened.  The woman who opened the door was tall and had an air of authority to her.  If Hermione had to guess, she would estimate that the woman was about ten years younger than her parents.  “Come in, Ms. Granger.”</p><p>Hermione had not spent time in magical hotel rooms and was comforted to see that they closely resembled Muggle ones.  The print of the bedspread and the matching heavy curtains were abstract, as was the painting on the wall.  That did not surprise her.  It would be unsettling to have a portrait watching you as you slept, especially if the hotel had matching prints the same as Muggle hotel chains.  At the centre of the room, she turned to face the Unspeakable.</p><p>“Please take a seat,” the woman said, pointing to one of the two chairs near the window.</p><p>Hermione walked over, looking out over the back garden through the privacy sheers before sitting.</p><p>“I am Madley-Lima,” the woman said, taking the chair opposite Hermione.  “We at the Department are glad that you offered your assistance.”</p><p>Hermione nodded, although she didn’t yet know what it would involve.  “I hope I can help,” she replied.</p><p>Madley-Lima crossed her ankles.  “Harry Potter told us about your contribution to the battle against Voldemort’s followers in the Department of Mysteries two years ago.”  Hearing Voldemort’s name said without hesitation, even months after his death, still gave her a little jolt.  “I am sure you can recall the destruction to the various chambers.”</p><p>“Some,” Hermione said.  She had suffered from mild retrograde amnesia after being knocked unconscious, but she remembered the destruction they had caused in the Hall of Prophecy – both intentional and accidental – in perfect detail.  From conversations the others had, it sounded like the other chambers had not fared any better.  Hearing about planets being destroyed, the time room being filled with shards of glass, and Ron being attacked by brains were not things you easily forgot.</p><p>“The following information is off the record,” Madley-Lima said, “even though it is easy to deduce.  The attention of Unspeakables has been largely focused on the rebuilding of the objects destroyed during the battle.  It was complicated because not only were the objects of study destroyed, but much of the research was lost as well.”</p><p>Hermione shifted in her seat uncomfortably.  The destruction was inevitable given the fact that they were fighting off Death Eaters, but the loss of knowledge made her uncomfortable.</p><p>“Thankfully, to become an Unspeakable you must have top marks in school.  Thanks to the partial notes and what had been memorized prior to the battle, significant progress has been made in the restoration.  It is that progress that has led us to this meeting.”  Hermione watched as the older woman reached into a locked briefcase and pulled out a small box.  As she handed it to Hermione she said, “I have been informed by Headmistress McGonagall and Harry Potter that you are familiar with this.”</p><p>Nestled on the deep green velvet inside the box was a small hourglass, supported by gold circles and attached to a delicate gold chain.  Hermione suppressed a gasp.  “You’ve made time turners.”</p><p>“We have begun work on crafting time turners again,” Madley-Lima corrected.  “Given the extensive damage to the Time Room, it is still in its early stages.  You are holding the only completed one.”</p><p>Hermione placed her fingers gently on top of the hourglass.  “Why are you telling me all this?  You’re an Unspeakable.”</p><p>“I am, but there are very few people who have experience with the time turners from before the battle two years ago.  I should not have to tell you that the number was affected by the recent war.  But it is necessary that somebody familiar with time turners, somebody who has used one with some frequency, to examine the new one.”</p><p>Their eyes met, brown and blue.  “And I am supposed to fill this role?”</p><p>A nod.  “There was some debate, given your lack of qualifications.  But given your role in the downfall of Voldemort and you unparalleled experience in using a time turner, it was decided to ask for your assistance in this matter.”</p><p>She hesitated, but Hermione nodded.  After everything she had faced in the last year, which had been mentally taxing as well as dangerous, it was a relief to be asked to do something so simple.  She lifted it out of the box carefully.  She didn’t want to think what the reaction would be if she damaged the only working time turner.  “It feels the same,” she said.</p><p>“We came to that conclusion as well.  The measurements were taken from old notes and old photos have helped ensure that the craftmanship is a match to the originals.  The concern at this moment is the spell work.”</p><p>Hermione waited for a moment, hoping that the vague classification of spells would be further talked about.  After an long, uncomfortable stretch, it became clear that Madley-Lima had no intention of explaining further, at least not without prompting.  Hermione asked, “Are there spells that you had to recraft or reattempt from memory?”</p><p>“We managed to find most of the information just fine, but there are a few things that have proven impossible to find in the records.”</p><p>“What did the people involved in the creation of the last batch of time turners have to say about the missing information?  Surely they were able to fill some things in from memory, or at least able to give you a place to start.”</p><p>Madley-Lima leaned forward in her chair, pale hands clasped on her knee.  She gestured for Hermione to mirror her.  “The original batch of time turners were made a long time ago.  The oldest was from 1763.  The newest one was only new in comparison, as it was completed in 1948.”</p><p>Hermione did some quick mental math.  Fifty years.  “Why did they stop after that?”</p><p>“After living through magical and Muggle dictators and examining the policies of the time in a broken down country – no, a broken down continent – some people felt it was best to severely limit access to the time turners in hopes of avoiding their misuse.  We believe we know how time travel occurs and the rules of physics it involves, which the newer time turners were unwavering from.  The older ones, like the eighteenth century original, were less stable and less predictable.  You wouldn’t necessarily pop out where you were standing in the past, and there was some variation in how far each turn would send you back.”</p><p>“I had never heard of any of this,” Hermione said, eyes wide.  They gave one to her around her fourteenth birthday, but they were so secretive she knew nothing other than what she had been told by Professor McGonagall.</p><p>“There was no need,” Madley-Lima replied.  “You were given the second newest time turner and that one had never been anything less than steady.  And even then, there were lots of debate about whether or not we should let somebody outside of our Department use one.  Dumbledore and McGonagall both pulled some strings to get you that one.”</p><p>Hermione looked back to the time turner she had been given.  “What about this one?  How reliable is it?”</p><p>The hesitation told her everything she was worried about.  “We have not yet used the time turner.”</p><p>“Then why am I here?”</p><p>“You are the only living person who used the properly functioning time turner more than a hundred times.  If anybody would be able to contribute to the further re-development of the time turner project it would be you, Ms. Granger.”</p><p>She swallowed hard.  “Has anybody used this time turner before?  Even once?”  When the Unspeakable shook her head, Hermione swore in her head.  “After everything I did to bring about Voldemort’s downfall, you are asking me to take a great risk.”</p><p>“We are aware of what we are asking of you,” Madley-Lima said in a voice that was somehow both quiet and authoritative.  “We only ask that you go back in time two hours.  If all goes well, you will be in this room and you will meet a colleague of mine with extensive medical training.  If the trip goes as planned you will be able to great him and send him on his way and wait for my arrival.  If something has gone wrong, he will be there to help mend you.  I can assure you that we believe the risks to you are minimal.  We would not have been approved to start testing unless we could show minimal risk.”</p><p>After a moment, Hermione pulled the time turner out of the box.  She stood up and slipped the petite necklace over her, cloak and all.  She hadn’t bothered to take off her outerwear or put down her bag and it was probably a good thing.  At least this way she would have everything on her when she went back two hours.</p><p>She felt the familiar nerves she’d experienced before she’d used the time turner for the first time back in third year.  Would it work?  What if the feeling was unexpected and somehow awful?  Yet, then and now, she pushed through her fears and lifted the circle up so she could get a better grip on the winding mechanism.  She tipped it towards the Unspeakable and spun the dial twice.  “This feels the same as before,” she said, carefully holding it in place.</p><p>With a nod, she let go and the device began to spin on its own, the way she remembered.  The rest though… that was different.  There was a blur of colours swarming around her and the muffled noises were building, building, until they began to merge into a high pitched, shrill sound.  She didn’t remember it being this intense before.  She’d been able to make out bits and pieces of the world around her, but now she couldn’t even tell what was moving around her.</p><p>The intensity did not dull, which added a new layer to her anxiety that this may be going wrong.  She had gone back two hours in time numerous times.  She had been doing it multiple times a day, five days a week, for a year.  It had never taken this long.</p><p>Hermione closed her eyes and inhaled slowly.  Hold, hold.  Breathe out slowly.  There was no need to worry.  They could work on making the process easier to deal with in the future.  Hers probably required some tweaks to get it as consistent and easy to deal with.  Expecting perfection from the first attempt at a project was well and good, but unlikely.</p><p>The high pitched shrieking stopped and Hermione felt herself physically relax.  It had ended.  The relief that it had all stopped only lasted until she had opened her eyes.</p><p>The wooden floors of before had been replaced by a plush orange carpet.  The painted walls were now covered in wallpaper with beige and orange flowers.  The beds and chairs in the room were all made of a light, honey oak and were decorated with white linens and yellow cushions.</p><p>She was not two hours back.  She was much, much farther back in time than she had agreed to.</p><p> </p>
