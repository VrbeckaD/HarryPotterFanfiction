    <p>  Mila followed closely behind Draco and Narcissa as they walked through the streets in Diagon Alley. She couldn’t contain the wild smile that played on her lips while her hand tightly clutched the most important letter she had ever received in her pocket. It was the letter she was eagerly waiting for the last few months, driving everyone up the wall with her constant glances to the window and inability to talk about any other topic other than what she would do when she got to Hogwarts. The letter in simple, cursive writing wrote:</p>
<p>HOGWARTS SCHOOL OF WITCHCRAFT AND WIZARDRY</p>
<p>Headmaster: Albus Dumbledore</p>
<p>(Order of Merlin,First Class, Grand Sorc.,Chf.Warlock, Supreme Mugwump ,International Conded. Of Wizards)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Dear Ms Rosier,</p>
<p>We are pleased to inform you that you have a place at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment. </p>
<p>Term begins on 1 September. We await your owl by no later than 31 July.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>Minerva McGonagall</p>
<p>Deputy Headmistress.</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>  Along with the letter of acceptance,  there was a list of required materials included, which Mila gave to Narcissa to handle, but not before memorising all the details. Necessities like the books and equipment were already ordered and to be delivered to the Manor, but it was finally the time to get her wand and get measured for the uniform. </p>
<p>They had arrived at ‘Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382BC’. Narcissa wasted no time to push the door inside. The tinkling bell rang somewhere in the store as they entered the tiny place. </p>
<p>“Good afternoon,” Mr Ollivander greeted the small family as he emerged from the corner of stacked wands. “Ah, the Malfoys and Miss Rosier how wonderful, I have been waiting for ye,” He continued with a warm smile, adding to Mila’s excitement. The whole place felt as if it was vibrating from magical presence. </p>
<p>“Good afternoon, Mr Ollivander. Always a pleasure,” Narcissa replied politely and nodded towards Draco to go ahead. </p>
<p>Draco, of course,  wasted no time and approached the older man, his demeanour demanding attention.</p>
<p>“I’m here to get my wand,” He expressed loudly as his eyes darted between the different boxes. Mr.Ollivander inspected him and nodded lightly.</p>
<p>“Of course you are, young sir, and I think I have the perfect wand in mind for you,” With that, the man disappeared into the back of the store to retrieve it. </p>
<p>Mila stepped a little closer and rose on her tiptoes to see better just as Mr.Ollivander returned with a box. She felt Narcissa’s hand rest on her shoulder, but she couldn’t pull her eyes away from Draco, especially when his hand touched the sleek wood. He flicked his wrist effortlessly and a stream of red and gold sparks flew shot out from the end. </p>
<p>“Excellent!” Mr Ollivander exclaimed. “This is Hawthorn wood with unicorn hair,10 inches and Reasonably springy. It will serve you well, young sir.” </p>
<p>Draco smiled and nodded before stepping back with his new wand. His eyes met with Mila’s and he flashed her a smirk just as Narcissa nudged her. Mila straightened up and raised her head as she approached the man.</p>
<p>“Miss Rosier, it’s a pleasure to see you, you look just like your parents when they came here for the first time, they were just as excited as you. Let’s try this one,” Mr Ollivander pulled out one wand from under the counter and passed it to her.</p>
<p>“Sure, thank you,” She clenched the wand in her grip and flicked it. Instead of red flares coming out of the wand, the few papers that were lying on the counter lit up in flame. Mila’s heart skipped a beat as she took a step back in fright.</p>
<p>“Merlin! I’m so sorry!” She gasped out, her hands instinctively going up to her mouth as guilt flooded her. </p>
<p>“No worries dear, that’s definitely not your wand,” Mr Ollivander chuckled as he got rid of the flames with his own wand. Mila put the wand back and nervously glanced at Narcissa while Mr Ollivander walked off to get another wand. </p>
<p>“Don’t fret, things like these happen,” Narcissa commented lightly while Draco snickered to himself. She rolled her eyes at him, but a small smile reappeared on her face.</p>
<p>“Let’s try this one,” Mr Olliver returned with another wand. Sending a small prayer, Mila took a hold of the wand. A gentle, warm feeling overcame her as she held the wand. Lightly flicking the wand, the same sparks came out from her wand, just as it did for Draco when he got his own.</p>
<p>“Marvellous! This is Chestnut wood with a phoenix feather core, 13 inches and unyielding flexibility.  This is a very interesting wand Ms Rosier, we can expect great things from you, “</p>
<p>“Thank you sir,” She nodded and smiled gratefully. </p>
<p>Narcissa paid for their wands and with a wave of goodbye they were off. By the time they entered ‘Madam Malkin’s Robes for All Occasions’ and got to stand on the stool for measurements, Mila was positively starved. </p>
<p>“I will head to Lucius and see about the possibility of getting a pet. Once ye are finished with the robes, meet us at ‘Rosa Lee Teabag’. Behave yourselves and do not forget you two are representing the family name,” Narcissa explained, emphasizing the end. </p>
<p>“Of course,” They both muttered in sync and watched her leave.</p>
<p>“We’re still going to ‘Sugarplum’s’ right?” Mila asked quietly as Draco stood up on a footstool for the witch to start measuring him.</p>
<p>“Of course we are, we’ll go to ‘Broomstix’ too, father won’t mind too much if we slip away for a few moments.” Draco responded, raising his arms.</p>
<p>“This way dearie, we’ll get a start on you too,” Another, older looking woman approached her and pointed to the stall behind an open curtain. </p>
<p>“Be right back,” Mila muttered to Draco and followed the woman into the stall. She zoned out most of the procedure, but her interest peaked again when she heard Draco speak.</p>
<p>“Hullo, Hogwarts too?” </p>
<p>“Yes,” Responded a quiet, timid voice.</p>
<p>“I’m waiting for my sister to finish up. My mother and father are up the street looking for our pets. Then we are going to look at racing brooms. I don’t see why first-years can’t have their own. I think I’ll bully my father into getting us two and we’ll smuggle them in somehow. Have you got your own broom?” Draco continued to speak just as Mila started to put back on the outer layers of her clothes. </p>
<p>“No,” Responded the boy.</p>
<p>“Play Quidditch at all?”</p>
<p>“No,”</p>
<p>“Thank you very much,” Mila thanked the lady and yanked the curtain back to meet back with Draco.</p>
<p>“I do - Father says it’s a crime if I’m not picked to play for my house, which I must say I agree. Kno-” </p>
<p>“Was that before or after I hit you off the broom into the ground?” Mila snickered, cutting him off in mid-sentence. She noticed the boy smile in amusement as well just as Draco rolled his eyes.</p>
<p>“I’m Mila, this here is Draco, what’s your name?” Mila introduced herself and held a hand out for him to shake. </p>
<p>“I’m Harry,” The boy, Harry, shook her hand back and glanced between her and Draco.</p>
<p>“Look at -” Draco was once again interrupted, this time by the woman measuring him.</p>
<p>“That’s you done too dear, your uniforms were already paid for and will be sent to your household within the next day.” The woman explained, and Mila was entirely grateful to have an excuse to leave. She had a feeling Draco was about to say something that might have not been nice. </p>
<p>“Let’s go Draco, we got places to be,” Mila grabbed his arm and pulled him towards the door. She watched him and Harry share another look for a moment.</p>
<p>“Well, I’ll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose,” Draco  sneered at him. Mila offered a wave and a quiet “See you later, Harry.” </p>
<p>By the time they arrived to meet Narcissa and Lucius, the sun was setting. Mila spotted them sitting down in a corner outside beside the entrance, enjoying the last spells of sun while sipping some tea. Mila and Draco half raced the rest of the way towards the table before slowing down and politely sitting down opposite each other. A moment later, two cups of tea and a tray of delicacies were brought out by the worker.</p>
<p>“Last time I checked, robe fitting does not take two hours,” Lucius drawled out lazily as he took out his pocket watch and pointed it to them.</p>
<p>“What can I say, girl’s robes take foreverrr,” Mila muttered out the lie distractedly as she piled her plate with chocolate desserts.</p>
<p>“Does it now?” Lucius raised a single eyebrow in question, not fully buying it. Narcissa in the meantime pulled the almost empty cup of tea closer to her lips to hide the small smile.</p>
<p>“Yup,” Mila responded before shoving the dessert into her mouth. </p>
<p>“Mila, eat like a lady,” Narcissa commented watching her. Draco was also busy eating his portion but at least he was eating appropriately.</p>
<p>“Hungry,” Mila mumbled through her fingers as she attempted to swallow as much food as she could.</p>
<p>“You were told to eat your breakfast in the morning. As I remember correctly, you did not. Eat properly.” Lucius pointed out, his voice becoming sharper. </p>
<p>“Sorry sir,” Mila apologised and drank her tea slower than she ate. To her surprise Draco didn’t have any comment to add, he just kept his eyes on his tea and remained silent. </p>
<p>Soon they were finished and rose to their last destination, to get their pets. Since Mila demanded a cat while Draco insisted on an owl, the family split to get it over with sooner. Mila followed Lucius towards ‘Magical Menagerie’ while Narcissa and Draco went to ‘Eeylops Owl Emporium’.</p>
<p>“Now don’t even think about getting something that sheds, I do not wish to see any hairs in the manor.” Lucius said, mild disgust coating his voice as he looked through the cages with mild interest.</p>
<p>“Okay,” Mila mumbled to herself quietly as she scanned through the cages as well. A lot of them looked either something Lucius would despise or old. She glanced towards one of the cages where a feral orange cat seemed to glare at her with its big orange eyes. Mila raised her eyebrow, in an identical fashion like Lucius did, and looked at the cat for a moment longer before moving away. </p>
<p>A low meow caught her attention and large, green eyes met Mila’s eyes. The cat was tiny, wrinkly with dark grey complexion and no fur. It meowed again and moved closer to the cage towards Mila. </p>
<p>“I found it!” She exclaimed, gaining Lucius’ attention. He moved closer and looked at the cat before glancing at her. </p>
<p>“Are you sure?” He enquired to which Mila nodded quickly. </p>
<p>“Fine. You take care of it, clean for it and if I find that you are lacking, it’s going,” He expressed and handed her the 9 Galleon  to pay for it. </p>
<p>Once everything was paid for and signed, Mila refused to put it inside the cage, choosing to rather hold it in her arms, something the creature didn’t mind. In fact, Mila could hear her purr as she scratched her ear. </p>
<p>“What are you going to name it?” Lucius asked, leading the way back.</p>
<p>“Margo. Her name is Margo,” Mila declared happily. </p>
