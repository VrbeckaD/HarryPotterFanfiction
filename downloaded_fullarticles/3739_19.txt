    <p>Chapter one- the project</p>
<p>Harry’s pov</p>
<p>“Mate, wake up, he’s about to call out the pairings for the new assignment” </p>
<p>Rob nudges me and I sit up. I didn’t get much sleep last night, worrying about an escaped prisoner out to get you can cause a lot of stress on a person.</p>
<p> Snapes voice echoes through the room as he announces “Weasley and Goyle” I can’t help but laugh at this, Goyles about as clueless as a rock.</p>
<p> “You know what that means, he’ll probably put you with Crabbe” I groan realizing Ron is probably right.</p>
<p> “Potter, Mhm who should I pair you with? Considering how poorly you preform in my class, It may be beneficial for you to work with ahhh Mr. Malfoy” Malfoy makes a noise of disgust </p>
<p>“ But professor Snape this is preposterous !!” Malfoy can argue with Snape all he wants but I know better than to speak up.  “Silence Malfoy!” Snape roars. Snape continues to list off the pairings. “Honestly I’d rather work with Crabbe” I whisper to Ron, I already know this is going to be dreadful. </p>
<p>The next morning. </p>
<p>“I can’t believe he put you with Malfoy, I’m telling you he’s out to get you. Him and Malfoy are probably working together to try and, I don’t know kill you or something!” Ron says through a mouthful of bacon. “</p>
<p>“Ron don’t be an idiot!” Hermione snaps. I chuckle at how they  bicker like an old married couple.</p>
<p> “Harry I know this is going to be tough, but just focus on the project, and don’t let him be the cause of your failing!”, I roll my eyes, “Mione’ how can I stay focused on this stupid potion when I know Malfoy is going to tease me and much as he possibly can! I already have to worry about being murdered and now this?!” Her eyes soften </p>
<p>“I know it’s going to be rather difficult, but just stay strong, Oh Merlin, we’re going to be late!!” She grabs Rons arm and ushers him to come on “Hey I’m not done eating”, Hermione sighs “Ron you’re a pig, Harry are you coming ?” </p>
<p>Standing up I say “yeah I’m  right behind you”. This is going to be a long day.</p>
