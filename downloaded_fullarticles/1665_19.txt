  <span class="s1">Sirius’s hand shook violently as he reached for his wand to heal the gaping wound in Remus’s chest. But it was too late. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Remus looked at him, brown eyes dimming as he said,</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Sirius, it’s okay, you need to let go. Move on. You have so much to live for. You’ll love again. Don’t forget me, but move on.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">And then the light in his eyes left, and his body stilled as his last breath escaped his lungs.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Sirius cried out in agony.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“REMUS! NO! NO WAKE UP!! PLEASE... please...” he shook with sobs as he leaned over Remus’s motionless form. “Please.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Suddenly, Remus sat up, surprised.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Merlin, Sirius, we’re only role playing.” The brunet motioned for James to stop recording the scene. James rolled his eyes.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I know.” Sirius replied, wiping away tears. “I take acting very seriously, Remus.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Understatement of the year, mate.” James commented from behind the paused camera. “You should play in an angsty musical like Dear Evan Hansen or something.”</span>
