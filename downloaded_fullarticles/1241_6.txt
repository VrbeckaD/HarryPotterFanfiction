  <em> <b>First Impressions</b> </em>
</p><hr/><p> “...It’s such a good vibration. It’s such a sweet sensation!...”</p><p>Wait.</p><p>“...Yo it’s about that time to bring forth the rhythm and the rhyme…”</p><p>I know this song.</p><p>“...I’m a get mine so get yours. I wanna see sweat comin’ out your pores…”</p><p>I knocked on the compartment door. A boy with sandy-blonde hair was dancing as he rapped. He opened the door for me, and I took a tentative step forward, “Hi. I couldn’t help but notice the song, and I was wondering if you were muggle born like me.”</p><p>“Oh no, not exactly. Me mum’s a witch, but my dad’s not,” he grinned, “come join me.”</p><p>I didn’t get much of a choice as he pulled me into the compartment with him, and he immediately began again while shifting his weight from one foot to the other, “Come on, come on. Feel it, feel it. Feel the vibration.”</p><p>“It’s such a good vibration. It’s such a sweet sensation.” I started softly.</p><p>“Yeah! Come on.”</p><p>“It’s such a good vibration. It’s such a sweet sensation!” He continued with me, and soon enough we were both bouncing and laughing through the song.</p><p>Suddenly the compartment door slid open, and we froze mid step, arms in the air. There was a girl with bushy brown hair standing in the doorway. She cleared her throat and put a hand on her hip, “Have you seen a toad. A boy named Neville’s lost one.”</p><p>“Nope.”</p><p>“Nope.”</p><p>Still frozen in place, she left. A quick look at each other, and we burst out laughing.</p></div>
