    <p>Seeing the train felt like coming home to Harry.</p><p>He'd missed this— the feeling of magic in the air, youngins singing the school song to the wrong tune, the smell of cauldron polish wafting through the air– everything about going back to Hogwarts. The air was filled with steam from the train, and the chaos that ensued around him made Harry feel only a tiny bit claustrophobic.</p><p>"Alright, dears, stay close!"</p><p>"Molly, they aren't children anymore–"</p><p>"Except for Ginny!"</p><p>"Shut up, Ron."</p><p>The endless bickering from the siblings and smothering from Molly hadn't been necessarily bothersome all summer, but it had been something Harry has had to deal with. (For slightly longer than he would have liked.) But Molly's motherly gaze and Ron and Ginny's snarky remarks were of the same value as classical music to Harry. Some people listened to Bach and Mozart while they went about their day; Harry listened to the youngest of the Weasleys' squabbling while under their mother's close eye. It was familiar, comforting. Not just in the way that it filled the air with noise, but in the way it reminded Harry that he wasn't alone. He's going to miss the busy and chaotic life that he had when he lived at the Burrow.</p><p>Suddenly, the trolley beneath Harry's grip hit a crack in the cement of Platform 9 3/4, causing it to jostle rather unpleasantly. Harry stumbled, and the cart ran over someone's heels. He heard a small yelp and the scuffing of shoes on the pavement.</p><p>"Oh, sorry!" Harry began to say. "I wasn't looking where I was–"</p><p>The person before Harry was lacking in colour, face and hair a creamy white and traveling cloak a stark black against the dozen greys of the platform and station. His eyes were skittish, dancing about, and steely grey. They were less guarded than Harry remembered. But what truly shocked him was the person's hair: still blond and shiny, looking as soft and perfect as it always did– but it was a different kind of perfect. What once was slicked back and simply lacking in imperfections was now a messy undercut, but messy in the most purposeful way.</p><p>"It's alright." Draco Malfoy's voice was calm and steady, but his eyes gave him away. He seemed anxious, like his brain was in the midst of a fight-or-flight dilemma. He looked the way Harry felt all the time now.</p><p>The girl behind Malfoy cleared her throat. She was tall, thin, and utterly gorgeous. She grabbed his sleeve gingerly and smiled up at him, tucking a piece of brown hair behind her ear. "Draco, darling, we won't get a good spot on the train if we don't hurry." Only after Harry heard her voice did he recognise Astoria Greengrass.</p><p>Draco nodded ever so slightly. "Yes, coming. Good day to you, Potter."</p><p>And then he was gone and Ron was suddenly standing in front of Harry, looking at him like he'd turned into a numpty. "Mate, what are you doing?"</p><p>"I–I was talking to—" The train's whistle interrupted him, and Harry hadn't even gotten his trunk on board.</p><p>"Bloody Hell, c'mon. We're gonna end up crashing another car into the Whomping Willow if we don't hurry," he joked.</p><p>Harry tried to smile at Ron, but it came out more as a grimace than anything else. His mind was still stuck on how the air seemed to still between him and Malfoy, the way his robes whipped in the draft of the train station, the weight of the magic that surrounded him<em>. </em>He couldn't decide whether it was horrid or <em>intoxicating</em>.</p><p>...</p><p>The feast in the Great Hall went as it normally did, but instead of the man with a long grey beard and high-heeled boots beneath his dress robes speaking to the school, Minerva McGonagall gave the opening speech. It was strange, without Dumbledore, but it didn't hurt like Harry thought it would. Over the past year, Harry had learned things about Dumbledore that he almost wished he hadn't. Because now, after what felt like decades of stewing and brooding over the memories, everything in Harry's mind that had to do with the old man was locked up in an angry, red box in the in back of his mind that he refuses to touch with a ten foot pole.</p><p>"Harry, are you okay?" Hermione jolted him back to reality. She was curled up on the common room floor now, poufs and pillows surrounding her in a pleasant arrangement of rich purple tones. That was the colour scheme for the eighth year dorms, where Harry and his class were staying for the year. They were given the opportunity to retake their seventh year of schooling since they were unable to sit their NEWTs. The students were all in their original houses, but since they were also technically in a school year that had never existed, the wizarding community resurrected up a new wing buried deep in the dungeons near the Slytherin dorms during the Hogwarts Restoration that took place over the summer. The eighth year commons had a completely different atmosphere when compared to Harry's beloved Gryffindor tower, but the more time he spent in it, the more it seemed to grow on him.</p><p>"Sorry, just thinking. What're you reading?"</p><p>She adjusted her position, setting her book down and snatching the blanket off the arm of the couch Harry was sitting on. "Some Austen. I've been feeling a bit homesick."</p><p>"You and your old-timey literature..."</p><p>Hermione smirked, and said in her quoting-voice, "The person, be it gentleman or lady, who has not pleasure in a good novel, must be intolerably stupid."</p><p>Harry chuckled. "Yeah, yeah." He then paused, growing slightly more serious. "Why are you already homesick? It's only the first day, 'Mione."</p><p>She sighed and snuggled deeper into the blanket. "I know. But with this whole eighth year dorms arrangement, I just feel a little... out of place, I suppose."</p><p>Harry nodded. "I get that." Although their roommate assignments were the same as they were in Gryffindor, the rooms themselves were completely different. The walls were covered in a deep purple wallpaper with some kind of shiny, Victorian-esque pattern. The beds were stiff and felt like they were new— Harry missed the old, magically preserved mattresses that were stuffed with goose feathers and smelled of frankincense in the Gryffindor tower. Lying on the new bed felt like lying on a stranger's. "We'll get used to it, though," he said eventually.</p><p>"Indeed. And hopefully we won't be as distracted with all that 'saving the world' stuff this year."</p><p>It was at this moment that Ron walked through the door to the common room (it wasn't the Fat Lady and her passwords, but rather a mirror that you had to bow to before it would allow you to walk through it). He was carrying two paper grocery sacks, Dean and Seamus in tow with similar packages.</p><p>"Guess what?" he said as soon as he approached them.</p><p>Hermione put her book down. "What."</p><p>Dean leaned on Seamus' shoulder. "Parkinson decided to throw a little eighth year get-together tonight after curfew. Gonna be some drinks, apparently."</p><p>Hermione tsked. "You all know that we do have classes tomorrow morning, right?"</p><p>Ron tsked back at his girlfriend. "You know that we don't start classes until eleven tomorrow, right?" He earned himself a displeased look from Hermione. He gave her a small, teasing smile. "That's plenty of time to drink some hangover cure and get on with it."</p><p>It was true; since eighth years only had to take their NEWT classes, their schedules were more or less cut in half. They started classes at eleven o'clock, ate lunch at noon, and then studied until four (or five, if they had a double lesson or demonstration that day). But that didn't mean that the eighth year students were let off the hook; the house elves did not have to provide their service to the upperclassmen, with the exception of cooking and such. So the students were left to their own devices when it came to cleaning and laundry. McGonagall had suggested a chore chart of sorts, which most of the Gryffindors and Slytherins resented and most of the Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws adored.</p><p>"Anyways," Seamus disregarding Ron and Hermione, "She sent us to get some decorations." He reached into his bag and pulled out a roll of...</p><p>"Crêpe paper?" Harry asked, eyebrow raised.</p><p>Ron smirked, seemingly cocky all of the sudden. "Yeah, what about it?"</p><p>"Nothing, nothing," Harry grabbed his mug of tea from the coffee table in front of him and took a sip. "It's just that plain old streamers don't quite seem Parkinson's style."</p><p>Seamus shrugged with a sly grin, putting the roll back in the bag. "Just following orders, Potter. I'm sure Parkinson has something up her sleeve. Foxes like her always do."</p><p>Hermione made a sour face. "She's not really like that... a fox, you know. That's all just gossip, right?"</p><p>Harry chuckled dryly. She shot him a dirty look and hit him with a cushion.</p><p>"Who's to say. Anyway, we should get going, or the "fox" is going to go feral." Ron nodded to Dean and Seamus, and they began to follow in his stride. "See you there tonight," he said with a bright smile. He patted Harry's shoulder over the back of the couch as he headed towards the girls' dorms, most likely to give Pansy her decorations.</p><p>"Are you going?" Harry asked Hermione once they were out of earshot.</p><p>She scoffed and reopened her book. "Hera, no. You couldn't <em>pay</em> me to go in a dark, smelly room with a bunch of drunk and horny teenagers. That's just a recipe for disaster."</p><p>. . .</p><p>The "little get-together" Pansy claimed to have been throwing was actually more like one of those raging house parties you see in coming-of-age American films, and Harry was positive that no one had bothered to ask McGonagall for her permission to have this small event. Someone had charmed the candles to flicker rainbow, and the streamers Ron, Dean, and Seamus had brought earlier were charmed to dance around the chandelier in the center of the ceiling, all of them glowing a bright lavender. A Muggle radio had been smuggled (probably by Ron, Dean, and Seamus, too) from Professor Cloven's office— the same radio that's used in demonstrations for Muggle Studies. Britney Spears was blaring in the common room, and Hermione was right: it smelled of sweat and alcohol, and nearly every student was bumping and grinding to the music.</p><p>"Hey, Chosen One," Pansy drawled, cleaning out a glass at the makeshift bar he was sitting at. Two dressers from one of the girls' dorms must have been Locomotor-ed into the common room and filled with most-definitely illegally conjured alcohol. Though Harry was too buzzed to care, if he was being honest.</p><p>He then realised he hadn't listened to the second half of what Pansy said. "Sorry?" He half-said-half-shouted over the loud music.</p><p>"I asked you if you needed another firewhiskey?"</p><p>Harry debated. His consumption of alcohol up to this point had been somewhat temperate; did he really want to get smashed tonight? He didn't have classes in the morning, so it's not like he had anything to worry about... and it might actually help him get a decent night's sleep for once.</p><p>"Act'lly, I'll take a shotta Gigglewater."</p><p>She smirked. "Comin' right up."</p><p>Pansy was light on her feet, dancing around the two other Slytherins tending the bar (Harry didn't recognise either of them). She was pretty— puberty had been quite kind to her— and she'd grown into her tall and lanky frame with a grace unbeknownst to Harry. Her makeup was done dark, making her cheekbones stick out like blades and her eyes pop. Harry wondered when this happened, the whole Pansy Not Looking Like A Bulldog thing. The other Slytherins seemed different too. Not just physically, but... socially. Since boarding the train, those who had meaner streaks in the past kept to themselves.</p><p>"Here's that Gigglewater for you," she wiped her hands on a towel that was half stuffed in the pocket of her skirt. "Let me know if you want another."</p><p>Harry smiled are her. "Will do." Then he downed the shot and, forgetting to bite his tongue afterword, burst out laughing. Pansy snorted, holding a hand over her mouth to hide her smile. Harry had never seen her do either, genuinely at least.</p><p>"You have a nice laugh," he said, brain too fuzzy and music too loud to really process it.</p><p>She narrowed her eyes at him, but the smile remained upon her lips. She let the words sit between them a bit before replying sarcastically, "You, Potter, are quite the charmer when you're drunk."</p><p>He shook his head. "Nah, not really. I'm just drunk," he leaned his elbows on the table, resting his head on his hands. "No charm. "</p><p>She rolled her eyes, shook her head. "Sweet Aristophanes..." She began to turn away, probably to serve one of dozen other drunks in the room</p><p>"Wait," he reached out towards her, not close enough to touch her, but far enough that it caught her eye. " 'Nother shot?"</p><p>She rolled her eyes (<em>again... Harry began to think that she may do that a lot</em>) as she grabbed the bottle and another shot glass. "Are you trying to get blackout drunk?"</p><p>He smiled wide, squinched up his eyes and nose and everything. The whole nine yards; the kind of smile he doesn't normally show. "Yup!"</p><p>She cackled then. A full-on loud, brassy cackle. But it was so fitting, so charming, and Harry felt like she was showing him a part of herself that she didn't normally show, too. Her cheeks were flushed, not as much as Harry's were bound to be, but enough that he could tell she was at least buzzed. Which meant she probably wasn't showing him the softer-side of herself on purpose. Regardless, she grabbed a second shot glass and filled it up after Harry's, raising it to a toast. "To getting fucking wasted."</p><p>"To getting wasted!" Harry toasted and downed the shot. This time, his laugh was bigger, harder to contain. Pansy's cackle and his belly laugh fillined the air around them, drawing attention to their corner of the room. The onlookers smiled at them, some expressions filled with confusion, others too drunk to question why the Gryffindor "godsend" was laughing with Pansy Parkinson.</p><p>"'Mione was right 'bout you," he said when their outburst had finally died down.</p><p>She seemed to blush slightly at this, but with the dim light, Harry couldn't tell for certain. "What do you mean?"</p><p>"You're good company, Pansy."</p><p>She smiled at him, softer than before. "Thank you, Potter. But you are also drunk, and I'm on my way there, so I don't think it's quite fair to make judgments at this point."</p><p>He shrugged. "Too late." She shook her head with a smile, and Harry grinned back. "I'm gonna go dance. Wanna come?"</p><p>She held up the bottle of Gigglewater. "I'm afraid I'm stuck with tending to the bar."</p><p>"'Kay, well, I'll be on the dance floor." He waggled his eyebrows, swaying as he stood. "See ya, Parkinson."</p><p>He could hear her chuckle as he walked away and into the sea of drunk teenagers. Britney Spears changed to Janet Jackson, and Harry may or may not have lost his shit. He found Ron in the crowd, along with Dean and Seamus, and they all may or may not have danced completely inappropriately. "Woo"s and "Daaaaamn"s were shouted out by surrounding students when Seamus suddenly turned to Dean and smashed their lips together, quite messily if Harry was being honest. He felt himself smile while Ron hollered, "Get it, Seamus!" over the smooth vocals of "You Want This."</p><p>As the songs turned from popular dance anthems to more mellow tunes, Harry returned to the makeshift bar for more drinks. A boy with a head of mousy, brown hair served him instead of Pansy, who was busy with a group of Ravenclaw girls. He looked familiar to Harry, but he couldn't quite place where he knew him from. The boy was drying a glass with a towel, looking like he was working in an old-timey saloon rather than a crowded room full of stupid teens. He didn't greet Harry, didn't acknowledge him expect for giving him a glass of firewhiskey and a flat look. </p><p>"Hey, what's your--" When they locked eyes, Harry could finally place where he knew this guy from. "Oh, you're Nev's friend, right; the one from the Gardening Club? Terrance?"</p><p>"Theodore. Nott." He said, avoiding eye contact with Harry.</p><p>"Damn, so close!" Harry sipped at his drink. "So, Nott..."</p><p>Harry trailed off. What was he even going to say? What <em>is </em>there to say? Theodore said nothing, still drying that same glass which had to have been dry by now. Harry watched with minimal interest, mind going blank. He couldn't quite focus on anything particular; his vision was too fuzzy, mind too foggy. But he felt warm, from the inside out, for the first time in a long time, so he kept sipping his glass until there was nothing but ice cubes in it.</p><p>"Another?" Nott asked when Harry set the glass on the bar.</p><p>"Why not?"</p><p>And so they continued their not-quite comfortable silence well into the evening until Ron stumbled up to the bar, an irked-looking Hermione in tow. She apparently had been either getting ready for bed or was in bed by the time Ron had got to her because she was wearing her Gryffindor dressing gown (every student got one in their house colours each year... it was quite much in Harry's opinion) and her bedroom slippers. </p><p>Harry threw his arms up in the air, sloshing some of his drink onto the stone floor. "'Mione! Ron! 'S wonderful to see yuh!"</p><p>"Oh, for Heaven's sake, Ronald, he's had more to drink than you."</p><p>Ron, who was buzzed, but not nearly as drunk as Harry, grabbed the glass out of Harry's hand and downed the rest in a quick gulp. "Not true; he just can't hold his liquor."</p><p>"Shuuuush," Harry grumpily quieted Ron as he tried to drink out of the glass. When no drink came forth, he frowned and look to Theodore Nott, who was obviously listening in on the conversation. "Another round, Nott!"</p><p>Hermione instantly cut in. "Absolutely not, Theodore. Isn't there a cut off for those so obviously intoxicated?"</p><p>He looked Hermione in the eye and shrugged, just as aloof as he had been towards Harry for the last twenty minutes. He didn't serve Harry another drink, but Hermione still tutted and turned to Ron, arms folded across her chest. "Why did you bring me out here?</p><p>Ron laughed heartily, loud enough for anyone to hear over the music blaring through the charmed speakers. He wrapped an arm around her, speaking into the crook of her neck with a grin on his face. He looked like he was about to kiss her, like he wanted to do more than just kiss her. "You need to let loose, Hermione. Have some fun, live a little, et cetera, et cetera."</p><p>She shrugged him off of her. "Ronald. I am going to—"</p><p>"Hey there, Granger. Would you like something to drink?" Pansy Parkinson purred at her. She leaned forward onto the opposite side of the bar, an arm draped around Nott's waist as she did so.</p><p>Hermione pulled an affronted look, and for a moment, Harry swore she was about to whip out her wand and do something she'd most certainly regret. Instead, she just narrowed her eyes at Parkinson and curled her lip as she said, "No. Thank you."</p><p>Pansy leaned even closer to Hermione, who's cheeks were reddening under Pansy's malicious smile. "Well then." And she walked away. Harry thought the exchange was quite odd, but who was he to judge?</p><p>Ron's slightly widened eyes turned from Pansy back to Hermione. "Yeesh. She sure is something."</p><p>Hermione huffed, but said nothing, eyes still trained on the Slytherin girl who was now fixing a drink for someone on the other end of the bar. Suddenly, as Harry was trying to figure out who it was for, his vision began to swim and the scene around him was masked by green, red, and blue spots. As though the world had been tilted on its axis, Harry leaned far to the right and nearly fell of off his stool. Ron caught him by the elbow and kept him upright. "Oh. Hey, Ron." Harry said, as though he had just noticed his presence.</p><p>"For the love of— Ron, get him to bed before he hurts himself." She was about to turn away when she hesitated. "Harry, just, please try to actually get some sleep tonight. I'll bring you some Hangover Cure in the morning."</p><p>"What about me?" Ron called to her as he half-guided, half-carried Harry away from the bar. Hermione turned on her heel to face him, hair bouncing along with her. The look of pure exasperation on her face made Harry giggle.</p><p>"You, dear Ronald, get nothing."</p><p>And with that, she pushed her way into the sea of teenagers and disappeared. Harry laughed at Ron's incredulous look and put all of his weight against him. The ginger groaned, leaning into Harry to counterbalance the force of Harry's body on his. "Your girlfriend is scary, Ronny," Harry mumbled.</p><p>Ron began dragging them forward towards the dormitories. "I'm aware. An' don't call me that."</p><p>Harry must have drank more than he thought, because he'd reached the giggly stage of drunkenness; the point where everyone and everything is utterly hilarious. He tittered at Ron, looking at him fondly. "'Kay, Ronny."</p><p>The people around the boys were dancing, pushing into them. It was nice, the contact with other people, though unintentional. Harry didn't touch other people— or get touched by other people— often, besides Hermione, and Ginny when they were a couple. Touching Ron was nice too, almost in the same way. But it felt nicer for some reason, more secure. Ron was strong, not like, body-builder level, but as fit as Harry was. And he smelled <em>so damn good. </em>Like pine, peppermint, and something distinctly... masculine. Harry leaned close to Ron's neck and breathed in deeply.</p><p>"Oi, what're yuh doing?"</p><p>"You smell," he breathed in again, relishing the scent, "Rully good, Ronny."</p><p>Ron scoffed. "Sweet Lady George, you're drunk."</p><p>The boys kept making their way through the crowd, until someone bumped into Ron and decided to strike up a conversation. Harry's vision was swimming, the scene in front of him constantly dipping and swaying at this point, and his legs felt like they were about to walk off without him. The hall to the boys' dormitory was in sight, so he tugged on Ron's sleeve like a little kid at Tesco's, silently pleading with his mum to stop talking to Cathy from the PTA because it'd been fifteen minutes and he wanted to go home. Ron looked to the door of the dormitory and then, apparently thinking Harry was sober enough to get himself there, said, "Go ahead, I'll just be a minute." </p><p>Harry gladly stumbled through the outskirts of the dance circle to his dorm room. The lights were dimmed, and someone was sitting on their bed, reading a book. Harry recognised him, but couldn't figure out who it was. His brain was yelling at him, telling him that he knew exactly who it was, but it felt like Harry was underwater. He couldn't focus on anything except his bed, which once was perceived by Harry as uncomfortable and stiff, but now looked as comfortable as a cloud to him. He collapsed onto the duvet, giggling when his glasses rode up his face and rested on his eyebrows. He readjusted them and attempted to unknot his tie with one had, the other one not wanting to cooperate for some reason.</p><p>After a minute of struggling to get it anything but loosened, Harry sighed and left it on. In favour of doing absolutely anything, he rested his arms on his stomach and laid staring at the canopy above him. It looked quite soft, and the draping of the fabric reminded him of the banners he saw in the Ravenclaw common room during the restoration of Hogwarts over the summer. Remembering the five weeks he spent rebuilding the school with his friends caused a certain warmth to arise in him, one he hadn't felt in a long time. So he grabbed at the moleskine pouch he wore around his neck and took out the vial containing a dozen or so of his favourite memories, a few being from his time on the grounds over the summer. He studied the bottle, remembering the night he transferred the first memory into it. Harry had kept bringing up the Pensieve, and even contemplated owling the headmistress to see if he could come and use Dumbledore's. He had really just wanted to watch a memory of him, Sirius, and Remus all making dinner together (one of his fondest with the men) because he missed seeing them— missed the way their eyes would light up when they saw him, the jokes and private smiles the two would share between themselves, and the way they tried to include Harry in their special moments. He missed being a part of that family. And the only way he could truly get closure was to see them again, at least in a metaphysical sense. So on one of their particularly mournful nights, him and Hermione spent hours at the Burrow trying to come up with a spell that would work with memories in the same way that a Muggle projector would work with slides. It was complicated work, but Harry was thankful for the distraction. It was well after midnight when they finally casted the spell successfully and were able to watch their favourite memories of those they'd lost. Fleur, while getting a glass of water from the kitchen, was the one to finally figure out that you couldn't just be <em>thinking</em> of the memory you wanted projected, but you physically had to have the memory extracted and on the tip of your wand in order to work. She had said it so simply, like it was the most obvious step in the spell, that Hermione had nearly gone into shock. </p><p>Harry dipped the tip of his wand into the vial and whispered the spell now, smiling to himself at the thought of the late nights spent at the Burrow. "<em>Proiectura tempore</em>."</p><p>The magic glimmered a light blue for a moment on the grey canopy before the memories began to play, one by one. The first to play was from a week or so after the Battle of Hogwarts, at the Burrow. Molly had wandered into the kitchen late one evening to find Harry sitting alone, staring out the window at the back garden. He'd had a nightmare and decided to brew some tea to calm himself down, but found himself feeling more alone than ever. No, he hadn't just felt alone, he felt hollow— empty. </p><p>"Harry, dear, what on Earth are you doing up this late?" She had said, resting a hand on Harry's shoulder. She spooked him, causing him to jump and turn towards her, hastily wiping the tears from his face. She took notice and sat down next to him. "Nightmare?"</p><p>He nodded. "It was about Fred."</p><p>That was all Molly needed to hear before wrapping both arms around him, whispering reassurances and comforting words to him.</p><p>After what felt like hours, but was only a few minutes, Harry sniffled and said, "Thanks, Mum."</p><p>It was the first time Harry had accidentally called her that. She smiled and chuckled weakly at the look on Harry's face. "Of course, dear."</p><p>The memory faded and a new one played in its place on the canopy above, and Harry sighed, letting himself relax. The next memory was of Hermione, Ron, and him, during first year, when the Black Lake froze over and all of the students were allowed to ice skate on it. Harry had never skated before, so it was mostly just him hanging onto Ron and Hermione whilst trying to keep his balance. It was Harry's most pure memory, one of the first times in his life where he truly felt he belonged. When he showed Hermione the memory on the night they created the projection spell, it had made her cry. </p><p>"How wonderful," now said a person to Harry's left. He jumped, causing the memory to flicker and distort for a moment before the spell resumed its projection. Harry turned his head to the side only to find Neville Longbottom, completely sober and in his pajamas. </p><p>"Yeah," Harry responded, looking upward. He scooched over to allow Neville some room on his bed. He wouldn't normally be so blatantly open about his most personal and beloved memories, but in all honesty, Neville looked like he could use some cheering up. And besides, Harry was smashed. He didn't really care.</p><p>"What spell is this? I don't think I've ever seen one that works such as this," Neville said, laying down next to Harry. The memory switched to Harry teaching Dumbledore's Army how to cast a Patronus charm. He smiled at the blue animals dancing above him. </p><p>"'Mione and I came up with it. 'S like a Pensieve but not."</p><p>"That's incredible. That you both made the spell up, I mean." Neville smiled as the memory showed him failing to cast a corporeal Patronus. "It's not an easy feat for one to just create an incantation."</p><p>Harry shrugged, watching the rabbit Patronus of Luna Lovegood bound across the "screen". They continued watching Harry's memories in silence until Harry began dosing off. The spell wavered as he fell asleep, and not wanting to invade Harry's privacy, Neville returned the memories to the vial, corked it, and then stowed them and Harry's wand on the nightstand. Harry remembers Neville saying something to him as he clambered into his own bed, but Harry couldn't remember what. He thought it was some sort of "thank you," but what for, Harry didn't know.</p><p> </p><p>When Harry awoke, drool dripping onto his pillow, tie knot digging into his clavicle, the room was pitch black. He was panting hard and his heart was thumping as though he had just run a mile, and he wasn't sure why. Another nightmare, he presumed. Probably the same one he'd been having for a few months now.</p><p>He tried to focus on his surroundings to ground himself. Ron was snoring deeply and he could hear the breathing of who he assumed was Dean and Seamus as well. He propped himself up with his elbow, hissing at the pounding at the back of his head. He didn't feel very nauseous though, so he closed his curtains, tugged off his trousers and button up, and undid his tie, planning on going back to sleep. But as soon as his head hit the pillow, he knew that wasn't going to happen. He allowed himself to lay there for a while, though, praying for sleep to take him. When it didn't, he sighed and got up, deciding to get some tea from the kitchens. That's what he always did when he couldn't sleep, drank a couple cups of tea. It never got him to go back to sleep, but it did settle his nerves. So he tugged on some pajama bottoms and made his way out of the room. Since he wasn't used to the new layout, he tripped over a trunk and a pile of books next to Seamus' bed (or at least he assumed it was Seamus' bed... he couldn't tell in the dark.) on his way. Muttering a string of curse words under his breath he made it out into the hall. Holding his foot with one hand, he leaned against the cold, stone wall and cast a quick tempus.</p><p>It was half past two. He remembered looking at the clock in the common room before going to the dorms to lay down. It had read one o'clock.</p><p>God, Harry hated himself.</p><p>Feeling bad for asking so much of the Hogwarts house elves this early in the morning, he decided to just call Kreacher and see if he could prepare Harry a cup.  He figured he should probably step away from the dorms to do it, since he didn't want to wake anyone, and made his way into the common room.</p><p>He expected to see passed out teenagers lying on the floor, snoring and drooling just as he'd been half an hour earlier, but what he hadn't expected to see was Draco Malfoy. A person who thought himself too prim, too proper, and too damn rich to be cleaning up the half spilled cocktails of stupid eighteen year olds.</p><p>But here he was, doing just that, alone at two thirty in the morning.</p>
