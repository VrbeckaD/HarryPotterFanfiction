  <b>Tuesday October 28, 2008</b>
</p><p>Ron Weasley opened the door to the red telephone box, wondering what was so urgent that he’d been summoned to the Ministry by a stag Patronus before he’d even finished his morning tea. He closed the door and dialed 62442.</p><p>A woman’s voice echoed in the box, “Welcome to the Ministry of Magic. Please state your name and business.”</p><p>“Ronald Weasley. Harry Potter’s Patronus scared the pants off me and demanded that I come immediately.”</p><p>“Thank you,” the affectless voice replied. “Visitor, please take the badge and attach it to the front of your robes.”</p><p>There was a rattling noise in the metal chute, and Ron grabbed the square silver badge out of the telephone. It read <i>Ronald Weasley, Urgent meeting with Deputy Head Auror. </i>He pinned the badge to his magenta robes.</p><p>“Visitor to the Ministry, you are required to submit to a search and present your wand for registration at the security desk, which is located at the far end of the Atrium.”</p><p>Ron tapped his fingers on the top of the phone impatiently. The telephone box began to descend. He thought it was ridiculous that the magical entrance didn’t recognise him. What with how often he was here visiting his wife, his best mate, his father, and even his brother, he felt that the disembodied voice should welcome him as an old friend. “Good morning, Ron,” it should say, “and what’ll it be today? Hermione, Harry, Arthur? Percy?”</p><p>The box continued its creaking descent, and Ron’s thoughts wandered to the huge order of Halloween-themed Wildfire Whiz-bangs they’d received last night. He was going to have to adjust the type of spider legs in the pyrotechnic potion to get the Halloween colours. George had been brassed off when the stag Patronus interrupted their morning. Ron had promised George that when he was through with Harry he would get the extra supplies they would need to fill the order. Ron looked at his watch, wondering how fast he could finish here, get over to their supplier, and then back to the shop.</p><p>The telephone box bumped to a stop, and the voice said, “The Ministry of Magic wishes you a pleasant day.” The door sprang open.</p><p>Ron strode out of the box but was stopped in his tracks by an Auror standing in front of him behind a shimmer of wards. “Step back!” the Auror barked. “Restricted entrance!” Ron stepped back warily and looked around.</p><p>The Atrium was in chaos. A large contingent of Aurors huddled at the far end, past the War Memorial Fountain and near the Wideye Coffee kiosk. More than a dozen Aurors stood shoulder to shoulder, and another group was casting at the ground and the surrounding area.</p><p>Aurors had blocked off the Floos with magical barriers and stood guard interviewing each person who had arrived through the arrival Floos. Another contingent of Aurors stood at the departure Floos checking wands.</p><p>The Auror in front of Ron took a step towards him, and then recognition flashed in the Auror’s eyes and his eyes dropped to the visitor badge. “Mr Weasley,” he said, “Deputy Head Auror Potter is waiting for you. I just need to verify your identity.”</p><p>Ron, wide-eyed, held out his wand. He took a breath to empty his mind and reached out for the mental link to Hermione. <i>I’m here. Are you okay? What’s going on?</i></p><p>The Auror cast a revealing spell and an identification spell.</p><p><i>Oh, thank goodness you’re here, </i>Hermione’s voice sounded in Ron’s head. <i>I’m fine. It’s a Love Potion attack, we think. I just got to Harry’s office. See you in a minute?</i></p><p><i>Fuck, </i>Ron responded.</p><p>The Auror handed Ron his wand, then passed a long golden rod up and down his front and back. “Not that this will find what we’re looking for,” the Auror muttered under his breath, looking annoyed with the protocol. Then to Ron, he said, “Thank you, Mr Weasley, you can head to the lifts.”</p><p>Ron nodded his thanks and headed across the Atrium. <i>On my way now, see you in a minute.</i></p><p>Moments of stress like this always made him grateful for the ability to talk to Hermione at any time. The next-best option was a Patronus, but that was an incredibly public method of communication. He supposed they could use the Muggle alternative of putting words into mobiles, but he wasn’t quite sure how that was supposed to work. Their families had objected to them taking on the soul bond. The objections had ranged from “It’s just so old-fashioned” to “Do you really want him/her <i>in your mind?” </i>to “It will cut you off from other people” to “What if you ever want to get a divorce?” But to Ron and Hermione, it had been an easy decision. Easy and instantaneous communication—tangible evidence of their commitment that was also practical. It had been intense at first, but since then Ron only ever thought about how glad he was for the bond. Never again would he feel isolation like when he’d left Hermione with Harry in the Forest of Dean.</p><p>He’d never quite get over being worried about Hermione, or Harry either, but he supposed that was what happened when you’d been on the front lines of a war.</p><p>He walked swiftly across the Atrium, boots clicking against the dark wood floor. The festivity of the Halloween decorations that adorned the Atrium—pumpkins bobbing along in the air above people’s heads, paper bats flapping around and landing on various surfaces, floating black candles, illuminated skulls—were in stark contrast to the crime-scene atmosphere provided by the Auror detail.</p><p>Ron reached the smaller hall beyond the Atrium, in which stood the lifts behind wrought golden grilles. The usual queue of people waiting for the lifts was missing, lending the scene an uncanny feel, like one of those American westerns Dean and Seamus liked with tumbleweed blowing through a ghost town.</p><p>A lift clattered open, and Ron entered, along with a dozen interdepartmental memos and a witch carrying a cup of Wideye Coffee. Ron nodded hello to the woman and leaned against the back of the lift. The witch fumbled with her bag. Levels seven, six, and five, at which the lift stopped but no one got off, had Ron cursing the Ministry for its failure to upgrade their lifts to match the functionality of their Muggle equivalents. The first time he’d visited Selfridges with the Grangers, he’d been astonished to find that the lifts had buttons allowing riders to select a floor.</p><p>After the lift clattered away from Level five, the witch blew on her coffee and turned to Ron. “Crazy morning, isn’t it?” she asked politely.</p><p>“Sure is,” Ron agreed.</p><p>The woman, who looked to be about forty and wore Auror robes, gave Ron a weary look. “I got called in on my day off!” she said, then shook her head and took a sip of her coffee.</p><p>(“Level four, Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, incorporating Beast, Being, and Spirit Divisions, Goblin Liaison Office, and Pest Advisory Bureau.”)</p><p>“That’s too bad—” Ron began, but he noticed something had gone wrong. Her shoulders slumped almost imperceptibly, her eyes unfocused slightly, her skin went a few shades paler.</p><p>He drew his wand on instinct and was about to talk to Hermione over the bond when the witch dropped her coffee, splattering it all over the lift and burning Ron’s leg. She launched forwards, grabbing Ron’s robes and meeting his eyes with a lecherous gaze.</p><p>“Shit!” Ron said, as she pressed her lips to his with an off-putting and frankly horrifying intensity.</p><p>He aimed his wand at her from underneath her death grip and cast a nonverbal <i>Stupefy. </i>A jet of scarlet light hit her in the sternum. She flew against the wall of the lift and slumped to the floor, unconscious.</p><p>(“Level three, Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes, including the Accidental Magic Reversal Squad, Obliviator Headquarters, and Muggle-Worthy Excuse Committee.”)</p><p><i>Hermione! </i>Ron’s heart was beating fast. <i>I just Stupefied an Auror in Lift, </i>he raised his eyes to the door, <i>Lift 2. A love potion, I guess. Her eyes went wonky and she tried to jump me out of nowhere! It was bloody disturbing!</i></p><p><i>Oh my god! </i>Hermione returned. <i>Are you okay?</i></p><p>
  <i>Fine. Could use some MacGruber’s Magical Mouth Rinse. Tell Harry? We’ll be there in a moment.</i>
</p><p>(“Level two, Department of Magical Law Enforcement, including the Improper Use of Magic Office, Auror Headquarters, and Wizengamot Administration Services.”)</p><p>The golden grille clattered open and Ron saw Harry running towards the lift, wand raised, Hermione and two Aurors at his heels.</p><p>Harry stopped abruptly, taking in the scene. Ron surveyed the lift—coffee everywhere, unconscious woman, him standing there like a bloody idiot.</p><p>Hermione stopped running and gave Ron a sympathetic look. <i>You alright? </i>she asked.</p><p>At the same moment, Harry snapped into Deputy Head Auror mode and began barking orders. “Johnson! Get Auror Sloane to St Mungo’s and stay to observe and interrogate her when she’s come to.”</p><p>Johnson ran up, nodded at Ron, and cast a Levitation Charm at the unconscious witch before throwing her over his shoulder and standing at the back of the lift.</p><p>Ron stepped off just before the lift clambered away.</p><p>“What the fuck is going on?” Ron asked, looking between Harry and Hermione. “How’d she get dosed with a love potion? Why her? I noticed as it happened, she got all slumpy and unfocused.”</p><p>“We don’t know,” Harry said.</p><p>“There was an, er, <i>incident</i> in the Atrium,” Hermione added.</p><p>“That’s why I called you both in,” Harry said, walking towards his office. “What happened in the lift?”</p><p>Ron grabbed Hermione’s hand as they fell into step behind Harry. She squeezed.</p><p>“After she got sedated and started acting like she was a prostitute I’d just paid a thousand Galleons, you mean?” Ron asked.</p><p>Harry snorted, looking at them over his shoulder, but Hermione frowned.</p><p>“She grabbed my robes and kissed me like some sort of demonic snogger,” Ron explained. “So I Stunned her. That’s it.”</p><p>“Robards is irate already,” Harry said, picking up his speed. “It’s not going to be pretty when he hears about Sloane.”</p><p>“What happened in the Atrium?” Ron asked.</p><p>Harry turned and gave him a dark look. “I’ll tell you in the office. It’s awful. And also kind of strangely hilarious, in an I-can’t-believe-this-actually-happened kind of way.”</p><p>“Harry!” Hermione admonished. But then she admitted, “The mental image is funny, but what happened to those people is terrifying, not funny.”</p><p>“Agreed,” Harry said, turning a corner.</p><p>Harry’s assistant, Thurstan Trumble, called out, “Deputy Head Auror Potter, the Minister for Magic is on his way up. Robards is gathering everyone in Conference Room Three.”</p><p>Harry slowed his steps. “Okay, great. Thanks, Thurstan.”</p><p>Another worker walked up, Levitating a tray of food. “Deputy Head Auror Potter,” she said, “do you need anything?”</p><p>“You could send tea to Conference Room Three; make sure you get that kind that the Minister likes. Thanks, Janice.”</p><p>Janice nodded and handed a Wideye Coffee from her tray to Thurstan. Thurstan accepted the cup, which was decorated with jack-o-lanterns, and thanked her.</p><p>Ron made the connection one second too late. “Don’t drink it!” he cried.</p><p>At the exact moment, Thurstan took a large gulp of his drink. He trembled, then looked at Harry with unfocused eyes. Thurstan lunged towards Harry and grabbed his arse.</p><p>After a shocked split second of watching Harry get groped by his subordinate, Hermione positioned herself to take aim and Stunned Thurstan. “<i>Stupefy!” </i>He slumped onto the floor.</p><p>“Fuck!” Harry yelled.</p><p>“It’s the coffee,” Ron said, “I forgot before because of the commotion. Shit, I should’ve said something before.”</p><p>Harry immediately pointed his wand at his throat. When he spoke, it echoed through all eight levels of the Ministry. “UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE, DO NOT DRINK ANY BEVERAGE OR EAT ANY FOOD THAT YOU DID NOT BRING FROM HOME. DO NOT DRINK ANYTHING FROM WIDEYE COFFEE.”</p><p>When Harry finished speaking, the building was eerily silent. Gradually, people began talking again, whispering about the edict.</p><p>If anyone in the Ministry had been unaware that there was a situation underway, they knew now. Bloody hell, Ron thought, that meant the <i>Prophet </i>would have the story within a minute. They’d probably issue a special edition, causing panic in the wizarding community through misinformation and half truths. He had to get word to Molly, because she’d worry when the special edition arrived. Who else was in the Ministry today? Arthur and Percy. Little Molly might be in the Ministry daycare. Ginny was in Wales. Bill at Gringotts. George at the shop. Charlie in Romania.</p><p>Ron raised his wand, closed his eyes, and thought of standing in the garden of the Burrow, Harry and George at his back, next to Hermione, taking the soul bond. He opened his eyes. “<i>Expecto Patronum!” </i>His terrier Fletcher burst from the tip of his wand and turned to him with an expectant tail wag. “Go find Percy and Arthur Weasley and give the message: I’m okay, with Harry and Hermione. Are you okay? Someone needs to contact Mum.” Fletcher ran off.</p><p>When he finished, Harry and Hermione were in conversation. Harry turned and called out, “Bernice, take Thurstan to St Mungo’s, and stay with him, okay?”</p><p>“Yes, sir,” an Auror said, and took Thurstan towards the lift.</p><p>“Alastair, hurry down to the Atrium and close Wideye, and all of the other cafes in the building, and bring the workers up to the holding rooms for questioning.”</p><p>“Yes, sir,” and another Auror was gone.</p><p>Ron quickly conjured another Patronus and sent it to George, letting him know what was happening and to tell Bill.</p><p>Hermione came to stand next to Ron and put her arm around his waist. A weasel Patronus bounded into the room and spoke in Arthur’s voice, “I’m fine, I’ve contacted Molly, let me know if you need help, stay safe.” A sardine Patronus swam in a moment later and spoke in Percy’s stilted voice, “I’m decent; things in chaos. Molly is home with Audrey today. I’ll contact Bill.”</p><p>Ron breathed out a sigh of relief, simultaneously marveling at how you could <i>hear </i>the semicolon in Percy’s words.</p><p>Janice’s eyes went wide. “Minister!” she squeaked. “You’re in Conference Room Three.”</p><p>Ron turned around. Kingsley Shacklebolt had just strode into the office. He carried with him an air of undisputed power and the Aurors shrunk away in awe as he passed.</p><p>“Thank you,” Kingsley said to Janice. Then, louder, “Robards! Potter!” His eyes landed on Ron and Hermione. “Senior Undersecretary Granger and Mr Weasley. Excellent. Follow me.”</p><p>The Minister’s robes billowed behind him as he turned into the conference room and took his place at the head of the table. On the way into the room, Harry whispered a report about Thurstan to Robards. Robards nodded with a frown and, as Head Auror, sat to the Minister’s right. Harry, Hermione, and Ron sat along one side of the long table. Kingsley’s assistant, Frostine Galway, took her place at his left, her stenographic quill and parchment at the ready. Susan Bones, Junior Assistant to the Minister, took a seat next to Frostine.</p><p>The conference room, though underground, had a magicked window that gave a view of a beautiful sunny day, as if they were a few storeys above ground. The walls were covered in the “M” and wand Ministry of Magic seal embossed in purple and gold. The conference table was dark wood and held a long line of candles that adjusted their brightness according to the current tasks of the people at the table. A miniature parade of little jack-o-lanterns meandered around the room at the ceiling. Ron spotted one that was carved to look like a gnome.</p><p>The far wall was covered in a large map of Britain, which displayed tiny diagrams of real-time events and information. There was a magical fire in Cornwall. St. Mungo’s was at 80% capacity. Puddlemere was playing the Harpies at Holyhead.</p><p>The tiny diagram of the Ministry of Magic building in London read, “Potions attack in progress.”  </p><p>Hermione, looking at the map, nudged Ron’s knee. “At least there aren’t any attacks elsewhere,” she whispered.</p><p>Ron studied the map. It was a small consolation, he thought. Ever since the Romilda Vane incident, he had always been a bit touchy about love potions. And that was before this whole thing had even started. He shuddered, a bit, remembering the unseeing look in the Auror’s eyes when she launched herself at him in the lift.</p><p>Ron glanced at Harry. Harry looked tired, but like he was coping alright. Everyone around the table was serious, attentive. He wondered if his mum had received word about what was happening. He wouldn’t be surprised if Molly Weasley showed up in the Auror offices; she’d become very protective of Hermione these past months.</p><p>“Let’s get started,” Kingsley said. “The others can join us when they get to the Ministry.” He sat back in his chair, waved his wand to shut the door, and then sighed. He looked suddenly tired. “Someone tell me what in the name of Merlin is going on.” He paused. “Facts only, please. We’ll discuss theories after.”</p><p>Robards leaned forwards, bracing his forearms on the conference table. He cleared his throat. “At ten after eight this morning, the Auror department received an urgent summons to the Atrium. When Aurors arrived at the scene, two Ministry workers were on the floor, partially undressed, engaging in sexual intercourse.”</p><p>Ron’s eyes snapped up to find Hermione’s. She gave him a <i>can-you-believe-it’s-gotten-this-bad?</i> look. He hated seeing that look on her face, and yet somehow it was there frequently, even after the war. He reached over and squeezed her thigh under the table.</p><p><i>I’m glad you’re here, </i>she said.</p><p>“Right in the middle of the Atrium?” Kingsley clarified.</p><p>“Yes,” Robards confirmed. “Well, near the Wideye Coffee kiosk at the back. We sent a contingent of Aurors to the Atrium to monitor people coming in and out. Then at 8:14, Smith in Magical Games and Sports called to report that he’d had to Stun his assistant. At 8:25, Mr Weasley arrived on Level 2 with a Stunned Auror in the lift. At 8:29, Auror Potter’s assistant Thurstan Trumble launched himself at Potter and was Stunned by Ms Granger. Auror Potter issued a call to shut down food distribution in the Ministry at 8:30. The Stunned Aurors have been sent to St Mungo’s.”</p><p>Kingsley looked around the table, eyes landing on Ron. “Mr Weasley, why were you in the lift?”</p><p>“I called him in,” Harry said, “after the report of the incident in the Atrium sounded like a love potion.”</p><p>Kingsley nodded. “Mr Weasley, describe what happened in the lift?”</p><p>“Auror—Sloane, is it?” Ron looked to Harry. Harry nodded. “Auror Sloane,” Ron continued, “and I boarded the lift on level eight. She chatted a bit. Then she took a sip of her coffee, her skin went pale, her shoulders slumped, her eyes went unfocused, she grabbed my robes and kissed me. I Stunned her.”</p><p>“And why are we sure it was a love potion?” Susan Bones asked. “Just because all these people at least kissed, and at worst…” she trailed off. “It doesn’t sound like Amortentia.”</p><p>“No, it’s not Amortentia or another love potion,” Ron said. “Though the effect was similar. The way her skin went pale.”</p><p>“Love potions cause infatuation,” Hermione explained. “They might lead to…sexual relations, but not so directly, so this must be something else. It could be a lust potion, but I’ve never heard of people reacting to a lust potion quite like this.”</p><p>Kingsley tapped his fingers on the table. “So we’re likely looking at a related potion.”</p><p>“Yes,” Robards confirmed. “We’ve had some suspicions that there might be a new potion under development.”</p><p>“Why did the two in the Atrium end up having sex?” Harry asked. “The other incidents—in the lift, on level seven—didn’t end in sex.”</p><p>The room was quiet, and everyone looked to Ron. Good Godric, Ron hated to be put on the spot like this. He knew he was the only one with potions expertise in the room, but usually his potions expertise consisted of developing joke products and brewing up a batch of Ten-Second Pimple Vanisher. He was no good at theory, even with his advanced knowledge about love potions. Ron hoped that he wouldn’t be the only potions expert on this case.</p><p>Eventually Hermione spoke. “One of two reasons. Either the dosed person in the Atrium started kissing the other person and the other person allowed it to escalate, which seems unlikely because they were in the Atrium and even someone with less-than-honourable intentions would probably not allow that to happen in full view of the public, or they were both dosed.”</p><p>Robards sat back in his chair. “This is a disaster. They’ve been attacked on Ministry property. They could have STIs now, or be pregnant. They could bring us up in front of the Wizengamot for negligence and damages.”</p><p><i>Of course we care about a possible trial,</i> <i>not the damage these people have suffered, </i>Hermione said, annoyed, over the bond.</p><p>There was a knock at the door. Everyone’s eyes turned as the door opened to reveal a pointy blond bastard. Great, Ron thought, just what this day needed.</p><p>“Excuse me for interrupting, Minister,” Malfoy said. “Auror Zane told me to come right in.”</p><p>“Mr Malfoy, excellent,” Kingsley said, gesturing him inside the room. “Thank you for getting here so quickly. Everyone, Draco Malfoy, who just received a doctorate in potions at Jussieu, was recently brought on as a potions consultant for the Ministry. Mr Malfoy, the Ministry is under a potions attack.”</p><p>Malfoy sat next to Frostine, adjusting his pristine robes. He looked up at Kingsley with a surprised expression. “What, under attack <i>now?</i>”</p><p>“Yes. People drink coffee from the Wideye Coffee kiosk in the Atrium, they take a sip, they grab someone near them and start kissing. Or groping, in the case of the man who got Auror Potter. There were two people this morning having sex in the Atrium.”</p><p>Malfoy’s eyebrows shot up in surprise and his gaze drifted to Harry. The git looked like he was trying to suppress a smile.</p><p>“This is serious, Malfoy,” Harry said, annoyed.</p><p>“I never said it wasn’t, <i>Potter.</i>”</p><p>Harry glared.</p><p><i>Oh, good, </i>Ron said silently to Hermione. <i>On top of everything else going to shit, we get to watch Harry and Malfoy bicker. It’s like the mid-90s.</i></p><p>Hermione turned to allow Ron to see her small smile.</p><p>“What I don’t understand,” Harry said, turning wisely away from Malfoy, “is that hundreds of people must have purchased coffee from Wideye this morning. We only had five people hit with the potion.”</p><p>“Four that we know of,” Robards corrected. “One we suspect. But you’re right. It must be a targeted attack.”</p><p>Ron frowned. Was there some connection between the victims that he was missing? He couldn’t think like that in a meeting like this. He’d need paper and time to treat it like a chess game if he was ever going to figure it out. And by then Hermione would’ve solved it.</p><p>“So Mr Malfoy,” Kingsley said, “people drink coffee. Mr Weasley reports pale skin, slumped shoulders, unfocused eyes. The person throws themselves at someone nearby, kissing and groping. We suspect the two in the Atrium who were having sex both ingested the potion.”</p><p>“Not a standard love potion,” Malfoy mused.</p><p>“We got that much already,” grumbled Ron under his breath.</p><p>“Excuse me, Weasley, do you have something to add?” Malfoy asked, like the great git that he was. When Ron only scowled at him, he continued. “Amortentia and other love potions do cause pale skin, but the immediate behavioural effect is infatuation with a given target, not propositioning the nearest person.”</p><p>“I don’t think,” Hermione said, “that the word ‘proposition’ is appropriate here. They did not proposition. They <i>assaulted</i> the people near them.”</p><p>“Either way,” Malfoy said, and he missed the way that fury crossed Hermione’s expression as he continued his lecture. “A love potion would cause a drinker to go pale, turn dreamy, and say something like, ‘I need to see Chambrs Cosworth right now. Where is he? Can you introduce me?’”</p><p><i>Is he </i>trying<i> to enrage me? </i>Hermione asked.</p><p><i>I doubt he knows how intensely you despise Chambrs Cosworth, </i>Ron replied.</p><p>“Alright,” Kingsley said. “So it’s not a love potion, but some other, unknown potion that causes the drinker to engage sexual relations without consent,” he nodded at Hermione, “immediately with someone nearby.” He paused. “Ms Bones, will you go see if Harry’s assistant’s coffee is still out there, and bring it in as evidence?”</p><p>Susan nodded and left the room.</p><p>“Do we have any idea who the person dosed with the potion will target with their advances?” Kingsley asked. “Is it just the nearest person?”</p><p>“Well,” Hermione said, “Thurstan targeted Harry, and as far as I know, Thurstan is straight. Harry was nearest him, though I was nearby, and so were other women. I don’t know about the others. So it seems a reasonable hypothesis that it doesn’t have to do with the person’s true sexual attraction.”</p><p>“The two in the Atrium,” Robards spoke up. “I talked with their supervisor. She says they barely get along. At each other’s throats constantly. Not two you’d think would be secretly harboring sexual attraction. But that’s really just speculation.”</p><p>Susan came back Levitating Thurstan’s coffee cup, as if merely touching it would infect her with the potion. Kingsley waved his wand and the cup landed in front of Malfoy.</p><p>“For analysing, not drinking,” Kingsley instructed. “Unless you fancy jumping Potter.”</p><p>The group chuckled at Kingsley’s joke, but Harry turned red, and Ron noticed that Malfoy looked discomposed for a brief moment.</p><p>Kingsley furrowed his brow. “Alright, here’s what we’re going to do. Auror Potter, you’re in charge of the investigation. With Mr Weasley’s consent, you will work with Ms Granger, Mr Weasley, and Mr Malfoy. Harry, you’ve got an Auror, a politician, an industry expert, and an academic expert—it’s a perfect team.” Kingsley looked expectantly at Ron. Bloody hell. Ron nodded. Kingsley continued, “If you need anything else, let me know. Auror Robards, you’re going to go interview all of the employees from Wideye Coffee and then come help me deal with the fallout from this. Susan, I need you to get ready to deal with the <i>Prophet. </i>Frostine, get temporary full clearance for Mr Weasley and Mr Malfoy. Until further notice, you are employees of the Ministry. I want frequent updates!”</p><p>He stood and walked quickly from the room; Susan and Frostine scrambled to gather their things and follow him to the lifts.</p><p>Robards turned to Harry. “Auror Potter, do not rush headlong into this. This could be related to the on-going case, and if so they’ve come out of the woodwork and this is our chance to actually catch some of these arseholes. We can’t botch it. Take your time, do your research.” With that, he left.</p><p>The door slammed behind them, and the conference room was suddenly quiet.</p><p>Ron sighed. He was stuck working a case at the Ministry. There was a reason he hadn’t become an Auror. He <i>hated </i>this sort of thing, although given the nature of the case, he’d rather be here than anywhere else. He just wished it hadn’t happened at all, and he could be at the shop making Whiz-bangs. Oh, fuck. George was going to be furious when he found out Ron couldn’t come back to work.</p><p>He considered sending Fletcher to give a message to George, but a look at the clock showed that customers would be starting to arrive and the arrival of a Patronus messenger was known to cause some commotion. Instead, he Conjured quill and parchment and scribbled a quick note apologising for his absence and promising to make it up by opening the shop the next three Saturdays. He Charmed the letter to fly itself to the Ministry Owlery.</p><p>When Ron finished his note, he looked around the table. Harry had his eyes scrunched shut the way he always did when concentrating about something. Malfoy was casting spells at the Wideye Coffee cup, murmuring under his breath. Hermione was looking at the two of them with amusement, waiting for Ron to finish his letter.</p><p>“So are we just going to sit here in silence,” Hermione asked, “or shall we get started?”</p><p>“You’ll notice I was not put in charge of this operation, Granger,” Malfoy drawled. “If I had been, I would be establishing a plan already.”</p><p>Harry opened his eyes. “I was <i>thinking</i>, Malfoy.”</p><p>“I know that’s difficult for you.”</p><p><i>Oh Merlin. </i>Ron said to Hermione. <i>Are they really going to do this?</i></p><p><i>I’m reminding you of the bet we had in sixth year, </i>she replied. <i>I still intend to hold you to your end of it.</i></p><p>Crap, Ron had hoped Hermione forgot about that. The loser had to sing “Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong Love” in front of the entire Gryffindor Common Room. He wasn’t sure how that translated to their lives now, but whatever it would be, it wouldn’t be good.</p><p>“Malfoy,” Harry said with patience that Ron would not have been able to muster, “We’re happy to have you here. Let’s try to be civil, okay?”</p><p>“Right-o,” Malfoy said, with a jaunty salute.</p><p><i>I propose a new bet, </i>Ron said. <i>How many hours until Harry hexes or punches him?</i></p><p>“You know the worst part of this?” Harry grumbled. “We can’t even drink coffee.”</p><p>“Yes, Harry. <i>That’s</i> the worst part,” Hermione said with uncharacteristic sarcasm. “Not the victims who were sexually assaulted this morning and who are currently in St Mungo’s.”</p><p>Harry flashed a cheeky grin at Hermione. “Okay, seriously though. What do you think is going on here? Have you had any new threats that you didn’t tell me about?”</p><p>“No,” Hermione said. She looked at Ron. “No, right?”</p><p>“No,” Ron agreed. “It’s been quiet for awhile.”</p><p>“What would the motivation behind an attack like this be?” Harry asked, fiddling with a quill. “Why would anyone want people shagging in the Atrium? Do you think the people who got dosed were chosen at random? Or do you think Robards is right, that it’s related to the on-going case?”</p><p>Hermione’s quill jotted notes down while Harry was speaking, but then she said, “Let’s do one thing at a time, okay? Have your Aurors heard anything?”</p><p>But Ron interrupted, “They have to be trying to get Hermione, right? They want to get nude photos of her.”</p><p>Malfoy lowered his wand from casting spells at the coffee cup. “I’m glad to hear your concupiscence for your wife hasn’t withered over the years, Weasley, but surely Granger isn’t attractive enough for all <i>that?</i>”</p><p>The three glared at him.</p><p>“Would anyone care to include me in this conversation?” Malfoy continued. “Chances are I will be more useful if I have an idea what’s going on. And why is Weasley even here? Is there some pressing need for professional jokesters on this case?”</p><p>Ron could feel his face flushing with anger; damn his fair skin. “And why are <i>you</i> here, exactly, Malfoy? Is there some pressing need for a pompous git who used to be a Death Eater?”</p><p>As soon as the words were out of his mouth, a shield appeared in the middle of the table above the candles. Hermione’s wand was raised.</p><p><i>Ron, </i>she grumbled in his head. <i>I agree he’s a git. But let’s set a good example, okay?</i></p><p><i>Ugh, fine, </i>Ron answered. <i>I hate being a grown-up. </i></p><p>Harry was giving them an odd look. “Are you two doing your secret head talking again?”</p><p>Fuck, Harry hated it when they talked over the bond and excluded him. They should’ve let Harry in on their soul bond. Only then everyone would be even more convinced they were polyamorists. Not that there was anything wrong with that. But <i>that</i> rumour had enough traction already after the “exposé” in <i>Witch Weekly </i>a few years back.</p><p>“Sorry, mate,” Ron said.</p><p>“Yes, sorry Harry. We’ll stop.” Hermione dropped the Shield.</p><p>“I cannot believe this fucking day,” Malfoy said, tipping his head back to look at the ceiling. “I’m barely settled in my new flat after returning to England, I get woken up by an urgent Floo call from the office of the Minister for Magic, I have to rush in here—because it’s not as if I could say no, could I?—and now I am stuck investigating a potions attack with this crack team of Gryffindor dimwits who are arguing like an old married threesome. Threesome? Or is it triple? Trio? Triple is the exact grammatical analogue of ‘couple,’ of course, but trio is probably better for flow. In any case, linguistic nuances aside, you’re bickering like old married polyamorists.”</p><p>Ron, having just been thinking about the jokes people cracked about them having threesomes, perhaps overreacted. “We are NOT having sex with Harry!” he bellowed.</p><p>Harry, Hermione, and Malfoy all silently turned to look at Ron. Malfoy’s face wore that infuriating smirk.</p><p>“The Weasel doth protest too much, methinks,” Malfoy drawled.</p><p>“Oh, for fuck’s sake,” Harry swore. “Malfoy, I’ve never had sex with Ron, or Hermione, or Ron and Hermione. Though I fail to see how that is relevant. Ron and Hermione took the soul bond when they got married, so they talk to each other in their heads.” He turned to Ron and Hermione. “Let’s be sure to include Malfoy in the conversation, and to have conversations through actual talking—you know, with our vocal cords.”</p><p>Ron sighed. “Fine. It seems like we should assume that this is a new potion, given the similarities and differences from standard Love Potions.”</p><p>Malfoy sat back in his chair and said pompously, “Weasley, what makes you think you have any idea what kind of Potion this was? Did I somehow miss a few years of Potions classes in which you actually excelled? Did you manage to complete a Potions Mastery without running into me at all of the conferences and professional meetings? Did I miss your latest article in <i>Potions Today</i>?”</p><p>Ron glared. Leave it to Malfoy to be an arsehole at a time like this. “Can you stop being a git for one second, Malfoy? I learned about love potions working at the shop. We had love potions for sale, and I learned to make them. Then I developed an alternative product, and in the process I became quite a love potion swot. Turns out, I’m good at Potions when it’s being used in the real world, rather than in the ivory tower.”</p><p>“Very impressive, Weasley,” Malfoy asserted. “I, in contrast, only wrote a hundred-thousand-word dissertation on desire-altering potions, including love and lust potions. So good thing you’re here, or I’m not sure what we’d do.”</p><p>“Malfoy,” Harry said, “can you please stop being so rude? I know that might be difficult, having been in France for so long.” Harry looked at Malfoy consideringly for a moment. “Should we get an Unspeakable that works in the Love Chamber on the case?”</p><p>Malfoy smiled. “They tried to hire me. So I think we’re fine, Potter.”</p><p>“Can we stop bickering like third years?” Hermione asked, annoyed. “Malfoy—can I call you ‘Draco’?” Malfoy nodded once. She continued, “Draco, we’re all very impressed with your academic achievements; there’s no need to brag about them. Ron knows a ton about love potions, so you should be glad you have someone here who will actually be able to keep up with you on the topic.”</p><p>Hermione turned to look at Harry and Ron. “If Draco is going to be part of the team, we need to update him on what’s happened over the last year.”</p><p>“What, when you got love potions banned?” Malfoy said disdainfully. “That made the newspapers, even in France.”</p><p>Hermione glared at Malfoy. Ron could feel his latent anger over the entire fiasco rising to the surface. How <i>dare </i>Malfoy think he could say anything about it?</p><p>Harry held up a hand. “Look, Malfoy, you can’t be a prat about this. You really don’t know what you’re talking about.”</p><p>“Well then explain it to me, <i>Potter. </i>How much could I have possibly missed? I read all about the Wizengamot hearing and Granger’s feminist crusade.”</p><p>Harry sighed. “It really is a long story.” He sounded knackered. Ron thought they should probably pop out of the Ministry to get some coffee, or they’d lose Harry to a narcoleptic haze. Either coffee, or Ron would have to owl George for a phial of Wise-And-Shine from their new line targeting Ravenclaws.</p><p>Hermione grabbed Ron’s hand under the table. “I think,” she said, “we should use a Pensieve. That way Draco can learn what happened, and we can scan our memories for any relevant information that might help the investigation.”</p><p>“Hermione, <i>no,</i>” Ron said, turning in his chair. The last thing in the world he wanted was for Malfoy to view their memories—any memories, really, but especially the memories from the last year. Sure Malfoy had changed, even if he was still a git. Sure he was giving money to all the right causes and publicly denouncing Blood Supremacy. Sure he funded the War Orphans Fund and gave money to Hogwarts for special programmes to help Muggleborn students. But that didn’t mean Ron wanted to share his memories.</p><p>Plus, maybe Malfoy was only doing those things to get his name favorably in the paper.</p><p>Harry nodded, and he and Hermione looked at Ron.</p><p>There was nothing for it. “Fine,” Ron grumped.</p><p>Harry started talking about going down to the Pensieve Rooms, which were near Obliviator Headquarters in the Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes.</p><p><i>I can’t believe we have to spend the whole day with Malfoy, </i>Ron chanced saying to Hermione over the link.</p><p><i>We’ve survived worse, </i>she replied.</p><p><i>I can’t wait for the end of the day, and it’s still morning, </i>Ron whined. <i>Can we open that elf-made mead and watch Never Mind the Buzzcocks tonight?</i></p><p><i>Definitely. </i>She smiled.</p><p>“Harry,” Ron said, “how about you go tell Robards that we’re heading to the Pensieve Rooms, and Hermione and I will go get us some coffee from the Starbucks out on the corner.”</p><p>“Excellent,” Harry said, perking up at the mention of coffee. “See you two on level three. Malfoy, er, I guess you’re coming with me.”</p><p>“Alright, Potter,” Malfoy said, “I’m coming with you. If you insist.”</p><p>Harry glanced at Ron, looking mildly panicked, but left the room with Malfoy.</p><p>“Those two are bloody fucking weird, Hermione.”</p>
<hr/><p>Twenty minutes later, coffee in hand, Robards informed, waivers signed, and access to Pensieve Room 6 (the largest Pensieve room) secured, the four found themselves sitting around a large stone basin.</p><p>“Of course we had to get the room with the spider Halloween decorations,” Ron said, looking at the wall where a giant glittering web hung with a magicked spider in a purple top hat sitting in the centre of it.</p><p>Harry laughed, sipping his coffee reverently. “It’s not a real spider, mate. And even if it was, I know for a fact it’s not the biggest you’ve seen.” Ron shot Harry two fingers, to which Harry responded with a grin.</p><p>Hermione sat primly on one of the chairs that surrounded the Pensieve, and Ron could tell she was nervous. He reached over and rubbed her arm, trying to be comforting.</p><p>“Are we going to have to watch these two with their public displays of affection all day?” Malfoy sighed dramatically.</p><p>Ron looked incredulously at the git, and was slightly annoyed to see Harry give a small, reluctant laugh.</p><p>“Oh, grow up,” Hermione ordered. She raised her wand to her temple and pulled out a long, silvery strand of memory.</p><p>“Are you sure you want to be the one?” Ron asked, reaching towards her. “We can use my memories. Or Harry’s.”</p><p>“It’s okay,” Hermione said, finishing extracting the memory and placing it in the basin. “Neither of you were there for some of these.”</p><p>“Malfoy, have you ever used a Pensieve before?” Harry asked.</p><p>Malfoy fixed Harry with a withering look.</p><p>Ron snorted, Harry rolled his eyes, and they leaned over the basin, falling through to land in Harry’s kitchen, where a memory of Harry, Ron, Hermione, and George eating around the kitchen table played out.</p><p>“My kitchen? Is this necessary?” Harry asked.</p><p>“Yes, just wait,” Hermione replied.</p><p>“Hey look!” Harry enthused. “My World Cup mug! That’s been lost for months! When was this?”</p><p>“Early 2007. Shhhh,” Hermione said, and they all quieted, standing on the edge of the room to watch the memory.</p><p>“George,” memory-Hermione said, “you should <i>not </i>joke about that. It’s not funny.”</p><p>“Oh, come on,” he replied. “It’s just a love potion.”</p><p>“Love potions are not trivial. People end up taking them without knowing it, and sometimes they end up having sex with someone they never otherwise would’ve.”</p><p>“Sex isn’t a tragedy,” George said, popping a potato in his mouth. “Well, at least when you’re having it with someone who isn’t my little brother.”</p><p>“Hey!” Ron said.</p><p>Memory-Harry sat in silence, watching the proceedings like they were great entertainment.</p><p>“First of all,” Hermione claimed, “sex with Ron is fabulous, and I don’t require intoxication to give consent.” Harry groaned, and George pressed his hands over his ears. “Second of all, sex without consent is rape. A person under a love potion cannot give consent. Love potions produce only a simulacrum of consent that shouldn’t hold any legal or ethical weight.”</p><p>“Does that actually happen?” Harry asked.</p><p>“Yes!” Hermione was getting riled up now. “You <i>know</i> it happens, Harry—people have been trying to dose you with love potions for over a decade. Remember Romilda Vane? But in terms of it actually leading to rape, I just read a fascinating story in <i>Witch Weekly </i>about this awful case in which a young witch was snuck a dose of Amortentia by a wizard who had been stalking her, and it was awful. She’s trying to prove her case in front of the Wizengamot, but people keep asking her how she can prove that she didn’t consent, or prove that she was actually under the influence of a love potion. One of the Interrogators asked, ‘Well didn’t you have your wand?’ And the wizard who drugged her just picked the potion up at an average apothecary! You two need to take this seriously—I’m worried someone will get raped after being dosed with a WonderWitch love potion, and who knows if the shop will be held liable.”</p><p>Ron and George both looked worried. “Fuck,” Ron said. “Yeah, they’re no joke. Remember I hit Harry when I was dosed?”</p><p>“Yeah, that was fucked up,” Harry agreed.</p><p>“They’re not always used that way, though,” George claimed. “There are plenty of legal ways you can use a love potion.”</p><p>“Like what?” Hermione challenged.</p><p>“Well, couples who both agree beforehand to use it,” George said.</p><p>“A condition of consent is that it can always be revoked or renegotiated,” Hermione said, crossing her legs. “So you can’t give blanket consent for anything that could happen and then lose all faculties.”</p><p>“Blanket consent,” Harry snickered.</p><p>Hermione shot him a look.</p><p>“You remember that girl Julie I dated?” George asked. “She is obsessed with <i>Magic Without Duty. </i>Thinks it’s the most romantic thing ever. Wanted us to dress up as Wynefreed Poffe and Chambrs Cosworth for a Halloween party. Often asked me to bring home items from the WonderWitch line, if you know what I mean. She’s a girl—it’s not just blokes who think Love Potions are cool.”</p><p>“She’s a <i>woman,</i>” Hermione corrected, earning an eye roll from George. “And that is terrible logic. The fact that one woman approves of something doesn’t automatically make it okay. And don’t even get me <i>started </i>on that arse-trumpet Wynefreed Poffe.”</p><p>“Arse-trumpet?” George asked, looking around the room for confirmation of the bizarreness.</p><p>“Gender-neutral cursing,” Harry explained and George stifled a smirk.</p><p>“Seriously, George, don’t get her started on Wynefreed Poffe,” Ron advised, with the tone of a person who’d already heard quite a bit on the matter.</p><p>“Who is Wynefreed Poffe?” Harry asked, clueless.</p><p>“Oh, Godric,” Ron sighed, slumping into his seat and settling in for the long haul.</p><p>Hermione turned in her seat, grabbing her wine glass and taking a sip. “I’m glad you asked, Harry. Wynefreed Poffe is the main character in a despicable book by Parry Woodbrygge called <i>Magic Without Duty. </i>It is something of a wizarding classic.”</p><p>“Widely considered the most romantic book of all time,” George put in.</p><p>“How have I never heard of this?” Harry asked.</p><p>“Consider yourself lucky,” Hermione said. “A creepy Potions Master—like, imagine Snape-level creepiness, Harry—comes in and. Wait, no, you know what. Hold on.”</p><p>Hermione hopped up, grabbed a handful of Floo powder and disappeared. George turned to Ron. “Galloping gargoyles, Ron. I love Hermione, you know I do, but.” He let out a huge sigh.</p><p>“She’s right, you know,” Harry said, helping himself to another serving of potatoes. “You just don’t want to have to change your mind and admit you’ve been wrong.”</p><p>George glared at Harry. “Lighten up, mate.”</p><p>Harry opened his mouth to respond, but the Floo roared and Hermione stumbled in, carrying a red book.</p><p>“I want you to listen to this, actually <i>listen </i>to it, and think about how incredibly fucked up it is,” Hermione said. She sat down, propping the book on her knees. She pulled her wand and cast a Charm at the book, the pages of which flipped quickly until landing at a page. She started to read in a dramatic voice.</p><p>As memory-Hermione began speaking, Ron wondered how much wine she’d had before they entered the memory.</p>
<p></p><blockquote>
  <p><i>Wynefreed sat at the writing desk, quill in hand. </i>Evered<i>, </i>I write, as I’m sure your inner eye already informed you, to invite you to tea tomorrow. My father is out of town, and I long for your company.  </p>
  <p>
  <i>Just then, the door to the parlour opened with a bang. Chambrs Cosworth stood menacing in the doorway, his broad shoulders illuminated from behind. Wynefreed stiffened as the faint scent of sulphur dissipated into the room from Chambrs’s person. She took a breath to summon a calm exterior. “I must never let him know I’m afraid to face him,” she thought.</i>
</p>
  <p>
  <i>“Wynefreed,” Chambrs barked, his potions-stained fingers rising to grasp the door frame. “Shall we have a pleasant domestic discussion about what you said to me earlier?”</i>
</p>
  <p>
  <i>She turned, her eyes flashing with fury. “Get out, Master Cosworth. My father is not here to indulge your taste for elf-made mead.”</i>
</p>
  <p>
  <i>“I am aware that Baron Poffe is not in the house. In fact, he’s not in the county, is he?” Chambrs fixed Wynefreed with a blazing look. “Pity.”</i>
</p>
  <p>
  <i>“What is it you want, Master Cosworth? I am currently employed with other matters.”</i>
</p>
  <p>
  <i>Chambrs Cosworth sauntered into the room with a predatory air. “I have some suspicions of an olfactory nature.”</i>
</p>
  <p>
  <i>Wynefreed stiffened. She was not certain what he meant, but she did know that Potions Masters earned their deceptive and salacious reputation.</i>
</p>
  <p>
  <i>Chambrs approached the writing desk like a dragon approaching a hippogriff. He peered over her shoulder. “You spend your time tracking the long-suffering Mr Yelverton.”</i>
</p>
  <p>
  <i>Wynefreed gasped. “How dare you—”</i>
</p>
  <p>
  <i>“I am not interested in your explanations,” Chambrs avowed. “I know the truth better than you do.” </i>
</p>
  <p>
  <i>And with those words, Chambrs grasped Wynefreed’s neck in his potions-stained fingers and tipped back her head, exposing her throat and opening her mouth. He opened a small glass phial and tipped a drop into her mouth.</i>
</p>
  <p>
  <i>“Veritaserum!” Wynefreed screamed, her fingers flying to her assaulted throat. “How dare you! What my father will say!”</i>
</p>
  <p>
  <i>But Chambrs only smiled with menace. “Now that you are helpless to withhold the truth from me,” he challenged, “why don’t you tell me what you smell, my dear?”</i>
</p>
  <p>
  <i>He pulled a larger phial from his robes and unscrewed the cap with care—almost lovingly. He brought it up to his nose and took an elaborate sniff. “I smell your father’s elf-made mead, anger, and Wynefreed Poffe.”</i>
</p>
  <p><i>Wynefreed huffed, “That couldn’t be—</i>Amortentia<i>?” She was horrified. She was horrified not of what Chambrs Cosworth smelled in that phial, but of what she, herself, would smell. What she had been telling herself for far too long that she did not smell. But Amortentia, like Veritaserum, did not lie.</i></p>
  <p>
  <i>“Of course it is,” Chambrs menaced. He thrust it under her gaping nostrils. “What,” he insisted, “do you smell, Wynefreed Poffe?”</i>
</p>
  <p>
  <i>Wynefreed tried not to inhale, but that was impossible. Before long the fumes spiraled into her nostrils, and then she changed tactics, and tried to avoid answering. But it was no use—the Veritaserum flowing through her veins acted as a compulsion, and she was blurting, “I smell books! And my dead mother’s perfume! And—and—sulphury potions fumes.” She sobbed.</i>
</p>
  <p>
  <i>Chambrs preened. He reached his potions-stained fingers towards her, and from those fingers dangled the phial of Amortentia. “Drink it.”</i>
</p>
  <p>
  <i>Wynefreed looked up at his dark eyes in terror. But inside that terror was a wild thrill such as she had never known. Before she could contemplate what was happening, she took the phial and raised it to her lips.</i>
</p>
  <p>
  <i>“Drink it, my dear,” Chambrs insisted, his potions-stained fingers pressing menacingly into her shoulders. “Drink it, I say, and let Amortentia set you free.”</i>
</p>
  <p>
  <i>Wynefreed whimpered, then drank. She felt joy, fear, madness, excitement, surrender to arms that were too strong, lips too bruising, fate that moved too fast. For the first time in her life she had met someone, something stronger than she, someone she could neither bully nor break, someone who was bullying and breaking her. Somehow, her arms were around his neck and her lips trembling beneath his and their robes fell onto the sitting room floor as the flames in the fire crackled beside their undulating bodies.</i>
</p>
</blockquote><p>Memory-Hermione closed the book with a bang, placed it on the table, and looked up at her audience. “Are you fucking kidding me? ‘Drink it, I say, and let Amortentia set you free’?”</p><p>George looked like he was going to burst with wanting to talk, Ron looked uncomfortable, and Harry was pressing his lips together to quell a smile at the ridiculousness of it all.</p><p>“It’s romantic!” George finally contended. “She smells <i>him</i>!”</p><p>“Mate,” Harry said, “It’s not romantic. It’s rapey. He forces Veritaserum down her throat, forces her to smell the Amortentia.”</p><p>“Thank you, Harry!” Hermione said. “Though I will note that it is not only ‘rapey,’ it is <i>rape.</i> Merely smelling someone in Amortentia does not constitute consent for sex.”</p><p>“But he didn’t force her to drink the Amortentia,” George said, but he was losing vehemence.</p><p>“Wynefreed Poffe is a flawed character, and she made a bad choice to drink the Amortentia,” Hermione asserted. “But what happened there was not consensual sex. A person does not have to have acted perfectly to be raped!”</p><p>“Plus,” Harry said, “what happens if she wanted to have sex with him, drinks the potion, loses all rational faculties, and then he tries to stick it up her butt? There’s lots of ways to have sex; the potion makes negotiating it impossible.”</p><p>Ron burst out laughing. Hermione pointed at Harry enthusiastically, showing her agreement. George relented. “Fine!” he said. “Fine. It’s rapey, not romantic. Although I’m not sure how you stop people from getting raped if half of everyone thinks rape is romance.”</p><p>Hermione frowned. “Actually, I agree. That <i>is</i> the difficulty.” She sighed. “Somehow we need to convince our whole society that consent is sexy.”</p><p>“But what about smelling it?” Ron asked. “Isn’t it nice to see what Amortentia smells like for you? That’s sweet.”</p><p>Hermione softened a bit. “Of course. I love smelling it. But you don’t need to drink it to smell it.”</p><p>Ron sighed. “We should stop selling the love potions. Maybe we can make a different product that just lets you smell it? That way the old customs and traditions can sort of still survive, though changed. It’s the right thing to do, and I’m worried we’re going to be held liable.”</p><p>Hermione beamed.</p><p>George poured himself another glass of wine. “Whatever, little brother. I’m putting you in charge of it, so have fun with that.”</p><p>Harry looked thoughtfully at Hermione. “You should say all of this to Kingsley and have him bring it before the Wizengamot. Love potions shouldn’t be legal.”</p><p>Hermione was surprised. “You think he’s ready for that? You think our society is ready for that?”</p><p>“No,” George said. “It’s not. It would end up causing a huge commotion. You’d clear the way for an unregulated, illegal black market. And you would make enemies.”</p><p>Harry shrugged. “If we wait till everyone’s ready, it’ll never get done.” Hermione flashed a bright smile.</p><p>The memory changed, swirling silver and changing image, until they were standing on the edge of Kingsley’s office. Memory-Hermione stood in staid robes in front of Kingsley’s desk. The Minister sat behind his desk, watching her with curiosity. Hermione was using her wand to project charts and statistics in the air.</p><p>“First I will give you a summary of how the law currently stands with regard to magically mediated sexual assault,” Memory-Hermione said. “Otherwise legal spells are illegal to use with the intent of manipulating another person into engaging in sexual acts. This includes, but is not limited to, <i>Confundus, Legilimens, Stupefy, Immobulus, Petrificus Totalus, Silencio</i>. Otherwise legal spells are also illegal to use with the intent of causing a person to forget sexual acts. This includes, but is not limited to, <i>Obliviate</i>. Spells that are specifically related to sex are legally considered to be a type of sexual activity, and therefore cannot be cast on another person without their express consent. This includes, but is not limited to, <i>Engorgio Phallus, Penetratio Totalus, Provocem Carnem, Genitalibus Excitare.</i>”</p><p>Ron fidgeted. His experience with sex spells was limited, but it was hard not to fidget at the memory of <i>Engorgio Phallus. </i></p><p>“Magical objects are treated similarly,” Memory-Hermione continued, waving her wand to change the visual aid projected in the air. “It is illegal to use any magical object to manipulate another person into engaging in sexual acts. And moreover, the use of magical objects designed to increase arousal, desire, and sexual performance are legally considered to be a type of sexual activity, and therefore cannot be used on another person without their express consent.</p><p>“Potions, in contrast, are poorly regulated from the standpoint of preventing potion-mediated sexual assault. The law simply states that it is illegal to give another person any potion, including love or lust potions, without their express consent. And yet, love and lust potions comprise a large industry, and statistics show,” she waved her wand to change the visual again, “that most doses of love and lust potion are consumed without consent. So why does the Ministry continue to allow the sale of love and lust potions when we know that they are being used in illegal ways that we have no hope of prosecuting?”</p><p>Ron fiddled with the sleeve of his robe. With the benefit of hindsight, he wondered what hope they had of regulating or prosecuting <i>any </i>of this.</p><p>“A limited number of lust potions are restricted, including the Priapus potion, and many libido-increasing potions, erectile dysfunction potions, and premature ejaculation potions are available only through prescription from healers, rather than from apothecaries. And personal use of potions to perpetrate assault is also illegal; that is, otherwise legal potions are illegal to drink with the intent of manipulating another person into engaging in sexual acts. This includes, but is not limited to, Polyjuice potion, Pheromone-increasing potion.”</p><p>Ron grabbed Hermione’s hand, leaning against the wall of the office, as they watched her memory self convince the Minister for Magic that love and lust potions should be illegal. Even now, knowing the outcome as he did, he was amazed with her. She was so impressive, so driven, so strong. He slipped his arm out of her hand and around her waist, pulling her close and hooking his thumb under her trouser waistband.</p><p><i>You usually do that when you want to have sex, </i>she said. <i>But I’ll be honest, watching these memories with Kingsley in the room really doesn’t really put me in the mood.</i></p><p><i>Malfoy and Harry in the room is okay, though? </i>Ron retorted.</p><p><i>Eh, </i>Hermione mused. <i>I mean, if I was trying to get in the mood I’d rather they weren’t there—they just don’t put me off it as much as my boss. And if the two of them were to start going at it—</i></p><p><i>Ahhhhh! Stop! </i>Ron shouted in her mind. <i>La la la la la!</i></p><p><i>I’m just saying, </i>she said. <i>I wonder if we’ll be around when I win that bet.</i></p><p>Ron tried to inconspicuously steal a glance at Harry and Malfoy. Malfoy was watching memory-Hermione’s presentation, now about sexual assault statistics, with interest. Harry, to Ron’s dismay, was looking at Malfoy.</p><p>Ron had to admit that Malfoy was a good-looking bloke. He looked like he just stepped off the pages of <i>Warlock </i>magazine. And, oh Merlin, Malfoy looked at Harry, and Harry snapped his eyes away.</p><p>Fuck it all. He was going to have to sing “Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong Love.” He’d better start working on memorising the lyrics, because if he was going to sing it, he was going to sing it right. <i>I've got a cauldron full of hot, strong love, And it's bubbling for you! Say </i>Incendio<i>, but that spell's not hot</i>—fuck, that’s all he could remember.</p><p>Memory-Hermione was now presenting expert opinions she’d managed to get on the record.</p><p>Ron glanced towards Harry and Malfoy again. Malfoy was looking at Harry out of the corner of his eye as Harry stretched his left shoulder, the one that always bothered him since he got hit with a Severing Hex in a duel a few summers ago.</p><p><i>Look at Malfoy’s face, </i>he said.</p><p>Hermione did her best to look at them subtly, but this time Malfoy saw her looking and his eyes snapped away from Harry.</p><p><i>I called it TWELVE years ago, </i>Hermione gloated.</p><p><i>Don’t boast, </i>Ron chided, but poked his thumb playfully into the squishy flesh at her hip bone.</p><p>“I am impressed, Ms Granger,” Kingsley extolled. “You make a convincing case using flawless logic.”</p><p>Memory-Hermione smiled. “Thank you, sir.”</p><p>“I will bring this before the Wizengamot. Please prepare a proposal specifically tailored to them. We need to take into account the membership of the various committees and consider how best to make the argument to them. Let’s plan a strategy meeting for after you’ve had time to think about it.”</p><p>“Yes, of course. Thank you so much!” Hermione beamed.</p><p>The memory began to swirl, and they had the sensation of floating upward through the memory, out of the Pensieve, to land on the floor in Pensieve Room 6.</p><p>Ron, Hermione, and Harry turned to look at Malfoy, the only one of the group for whom this wasn’t old information.</p><p>Malfoy sat down, crossed one of his elegant legs over the other, and said, “I always thought that Chambrs Cosworth was a charlatan. And he gives Potions Masters such a bad name.”</p><p>Oh, thank Godric. Ron didn’t think he could sit through another iteration of Hermione convincing someone that Chambrs Cosworth was an arsehole. Because she <i>would </i>convince them. He just didn’t want to have to sit through it.</p><p>“Giving Wynefreed a potion by force,” Malfoy continued. “That’s not on.  And if he somehow knew, by her Amortentia scents or otherwise, that she secretly harboured feelings for him, he looks like an utter coward for forcing the issue with a potion. He ought to have <i>convinced</i> her, without resorting to potions, that she couldn’t continue resisting the strength of her attraction. He ought to have acted in a way that made her realise she no longer <i>wanted</i> to resist her attraction, but rather to give in to it.”</p><p>Harry choked—on what, Ron wasn’t sure. “Harry,” Ron said, “are you alright, mate?”</p><p>Harry, red in the face, tears in his eyes, nodded, coughing all the while.</p><p><i>This is the funniest thing I’ve ever seen, </i>Hermione mused.</p><p><i>Anything to lighten the mood from this crap, </i>Ron replied. <i>Even this whatever-it-is with Harry and Malfoy, I suppose.</i></p><p>Malfoy was sitting serenely, like the huge twat that he was, smirk plastered on his face as he watched Harry cough up a lung.</p><p>“That’s actually one of the points I’ve been trying to make, Draco,” Hermione said. “Well not the bit about being a coward. But that it’s far sexier and more desirable and more attractive to seduce someone without the use of potions.”</p><p>“Much manlier, too. Don’t you think, Granger?”</p><p>Harry, who had finally stopped choking, started coughing again.</p><p><i>Do you think we ought to do something? </i>Ron asked.</p><p><i>Like what? </i>Hermione retorted.</p><p>Ron said, <i>Well. Watch this.</i></p><p>“Alright,” Ron said, changing the subject. “I’m hungry. Let’s get lunch, shall we? Harry, do you mind if Hermione and I go alone? We just need a minute to talk about, er, something.”</p><p>Harry’s face immediately turned sympathetic. “Oh, of course. Are you two okay? I know the love potion memories aren’t the easiest to dwell on—”</p><p>“Oh, we’re fine. Just want some time to decompress,” Hermione added.</p><p>“Sure.” Harry turned to Malfoy. “Do you want to come with me to get some lunch? We can’t eat here because we’ve shut down all food production at the Ministry. Unless you’d rather hang out here. That is, without food.”</p><p>Ron watched as Malfoy slowly stood, brushed nonexistent wrinkles out of his robes, and grinned. Ron honestly couldn’t tell if that grin was supposed to be threatening, predatory, or seductive. Fuck, but Harry was in way over his head with this one.</p><p>“Excellent idea, Potter,” Malfoy agreed. “Shall we go?”</p><p>“Uh, sure,” Harry said, following Malfoy out of the room with a bewildered look over his shoulder at Ron and Hermione. “What do you feel like eating? There’s a great place for fish and chips—”</p><p>“Stop talking, Potter,” Malfoy said as he left the room, “we’re not eating fish and chips.”</p><p>When they’d disappeared around the doorway, Hermione turned towards Ron. She heaved an amused sigh, her eyes twinkling with humour amid an underlying weariness. “Let’s go,” she said, holding out her hand, and Ron took it.</p>
<hr/><p>Ron and Hermione sat at their usual table at their usual lunch spot. Ron often met Hermione for lunch during the week—usually on Tuesdays and Fridays, but subject to change given Hermione’s commitments on any given week.</p><p>Hermione took a bite of salad. “Draco seems…” she sighed. “I don’t know. What do you think?”</p><p>Ron forked one of her cherry tomatoes and it popped satisfyingly between his teeth. He hated mushy tomatoes. “He seems fine. Still a git, but I don’t think he’s dangerous. He’s not going to hurt the investigation. Or Harry. I don’t think he was ever really dangerous, was he?”</p><p>Hermione nodded. He knew they were both thinking of Bill’s scars. “No, not really,” she said. “Sometimes I still wonder what would’ve happened if he hadn’t been at the Manor that day.”</p><p>Ron nodded. “I’d rather work with him than most of the idiot Aurors that are straight out of training. I’m still going to hex him if he’s a prat, though,” he said thoughtfully, stabbing another tomato.</p><p>Hermione swatted him away. “Get your own salad!”</p><p>“Why would I do that when I have yours?” he asked with a lopsided grin. He turned back to his own plate. “What do you think about this case? Do you think it’s related to the previous threats?”</p><p>Hermione sighed, planting her elbow on the table and resting her cheek in her hand. “It’s hard to be sure, but it’s got to be, right? But the Aurors haven’t had any leads on the threats, either, have they? So that doesn’t help us much.” She raised a piece of chicken to her mouth, then paused. “What I’m really interested in is the composition and function of this new potion. It’s horrifying.”</p><p>Ron’s face was haunted, but in an attempt to be lighthearted, he said, “Think that was the first time anyone’s ever had sex in the Atrium?”</p><p>“Not by a longshot,” Hermione said immediately.</p><p>“What?” Ron cried. “How can you be so sure?”</p><p>Hermione shrugged. “I mean, not like <i>that. </i>On the floor in the middle of everything….Those people are never going to get over that. I wonder if they had partners.”</p><p>Ron’s stopped chewing. “It’s bloody awful.”</p><p>“Could’ve been me,” Hermione said, trying and failing to sound unaffected.</p><p>Ron stiffened. He knew she was right; they’d both been trying to steel themselves against the possibility for months. And with this new potion….The idea of Hermione being hit with that potion and on the floor having sex with some faceless person made Ron’s blood boil. He could feel the heat in his neck and he knew that his freckles were currently lost in the red flush on his skin. But then he looked up at Hermione and saw the fear in her brown eyes, and his own discomfort fell away.</p><p>“Hey,” he said, reaching across the table and grabbing her hand. She looked at him with eyes that were trying to be strong. “Hey. If that ever happened, you know it wouldn’t mean anything. It wouldn’t mean anything about you, or about me, or about us—all it would be about is the potion. The potion would be doing it, not you.”</p><p>“I know,” she said, shaking her head slightly, as if she could maintain a purely rational stance by shaking off the messy human emotions. “Not important.”</p><p>“Plus,” Ron said, “Nadheer would never let it happen. Harry might actually kill him.”</p><p>Hermione smiled, looking to the door of the restaurant where Nadheer stood guard. “Maybe <i>you’ll</i> get hit with the potion,” she said mildly, stabbing a tomato, “You’re such a trollop anyway.”</p><p>Ron grinned. “That’s me. Feminist husband of Hermione Granger—if you want to call me a person of lax morals, epithets of any gender are appropriate.”</p><p>“Slag,” Hermione said.</p><p>“Scrubber,” Ron said.</p><p>The waiter, who had approached the table without them noticing, took a step backwards.</p><p>“Oh!” Ron said. “It’s not—”</p><p>“We’re just—trying to make light—” Hermione attempted.</p><p>“We’re married!” Ron finally yelled.</p><p>The waiter gave an exceedingly polite nod and hastily retreated from the table.</p><p>“Oh Merlin,” Hermione said, putting her hand over her eyes.</p><p>Ron laughed, though he was bright red again, and said after a moment, “So what <i>are</i> your thoughts about the new potion?”</p><p>Hermione frowned. “You noticed something was wrong in the lift before she acted, right? What did you see again?”</p><p>“She sort of slumped a bit, her eyes unfocused, skin turned pale.”</p><p>“I need to read up about libido-increasing potions, but my books are at home. The libido-increasing potions that are prescribed by Healers don’t have side effects like that, I’m pretty sure.”</p><p>“I read about that when I was trying to develop an alternative to love potions,” Ron said, around a mouthful of food. “You’re right, they don’t work like that, they just raise your overall randiness, they don’t make you want to jump someone <i>right </i>then. Although those are the kind that are actually legal. I’m not sure about the effects of illegal lust potions. I’m sure Malfoy will figure that out.” Ron paused. “And then boast about it for hours.”</p><p>“You’re right,” she conceded. “Solving the Potions puzzle isn’t why I’m here, is it?”</p><p>Ron grinned. “I know it’s hard for you to resist homework, but that wasn’t assigned to you.”</p><p>Hermione groaned, laughing. “I know! Okay. I will focus on the politics and Kingsley and think about our official response. Happy?”</p><p>“Ecstatic,” Ron said, his smile dropping off his face as he remembered exactly what they were discussing. “It’s a bit odd to watch the memories like that, isn’t it?”</p><p>“Extremely,” Hermione said.</p><p>“It’s going to be worse after lunch, isn’t it?” Ron asked.</p><p>“Well, if we’re going to bring Malfoy up to speed, we have to actually show him. But yes, it’s going to be worse.”</p><p>“Want to do shots before we go back?”</p><p>“Ron!” Hermione gasped, but she was laughing. “No, I don’t want to do shots on my lunch break when we’re about to go back into the Ministry to face not only Draco Malfoy, but also the Minister for Magic.”</p><p>“Oh fine. You’re always ruining the fun.”</p><p>Hermione reached across her salad and slapped Ron’s arm. He looked up at her with an adoring smile.</p><p>“Did you ever convince Harry to come to the Halloween party?” Hermione asked.</p><p>Ron sighed. “No. He’s determined to skip it! He’s still sore over the costume he got last year.”</p><p>Every year the Ministry put on a Halloween party for its employees. It was huge, with excellent food and brilliant decorations. The party used a variety of magical enchantments, the most exciting of which was the entrance to the party, which was magicked to Transfigure each person’s clothing into a costume on their way into the party. The problem was, no one got to pick their costume; the enchantments chose a costume for each partygoer. The costumes were always fantastic, but were not always appreciated by the wearer. Last year, Harry had walked into the party to find himself dressed as Cupid, wearing nothing but a tiny loincloth, a pair of wings, a quiver, and a bow. He spent the entire party trying to get people to give him more clothes, and eventually ended up putting on Ron’s king robe and leaving early. The <i>Prophet </i>had snapped a photo of him and put it on the front page. Rumour had it their circulation had never been so high for a single issue since the end of the war. (Harry would never agree to pose shirtless, not for the media’s lack of trying.)</p><p>“Well it <i>was</i> a bit much. Poor Harry. I told the head of D.A.P.P.E.R. that we needed to have the magic adjusted to make sure that people weren’t forced to bare more skin than they wanted to. I think he did it.” She paused. “I should check.” She pulled out a magical planner and flipped open the cover. She pressed her wand to the paper and said, “Ask D.A.P.P.E.R. about the costumes.” When she finished speaking, her words appeared briefly on the page, but then disappeared as they sorted themselves into the right place in the book, ready to remind her later.</p><p>“What’s D.A.P.P.E.R. a barmy acronym for, again?” Ron asked.</p><p>“Department for the Arrangement of Party Planning, Events, and Regalement.” Hermione snorted.</p><p>“Maybe if we get their word that there’s no chance of that happening again, we can get Harry to come. I think he’s worried he’ll end up dressed up as, like, an underwear model.”</p><p>Hermione laughed. “Harry would make quite a good underwear model, don’t you think?”</p><p>“Ew, Hermione! Don’t say that! He’s our best mate!”</p><p>“Draco’s already convinced we’re having threesomes.”</p><p>Just then, the waiter returned with a puritanical sneer, having clearly overheard that Hermione was discussing threesomes, with the bill. As he walked (quickly) away from the table, Ron said over the bond, <i>I think he’s hoping we invite him next time.</i></p><p>Hermione laughed. They took their last bites, paid the bill, and stood to leave, Hermione slinging her bag over her shoulder.</p><p>When they got outside the door, they said hi to Nadheer as a small owl landed on Ron’s shoulder from where it had been waiting for them. “Hello, you polite bird,” he said, and untied the letter from its foot.</p><p>“I think I have an owl treat,” Hermione said, pointing her wand surreptitiously at her bag and casting a nonverbal <i>Accio.</i> An owl treat flew into Hermione’s hand, and she gave the treat to the bird.</p><p>Ron unrolled the parchment and leaned on the building out of the way of the passersby. “It’s from Bill. Fleur is sick and he needs someone to pick up Victoire from school. Think I can do it?”</p><p>Hermione’s face took on the slightest hint of annoyance. Ron knew that she loved being a part of the Weasley clan, but she felt that Ron was often asked to do more than his share of family responsibilities. “They ask you because they know you’ll do it,” she always said, “and they don’t want to listen to George or Ginny whining, or Percy’s pretentious excuses, or Bill’s Gringotts schedule, so everyone always asks you.” But this time, apparently not wanting to get into a fight, she only said, “If no one else can do it, we can make sure you get out on time.”</p><p>Ron Conjured a quill and wrote a note to Bill, tied it on the owl, and watched it fly away. He looked up at the sky, where the bird had finally disappeared from view.</p><p>“You know,” Hermione said, “you’re going to be a really excellent dad some day.”</p><p>Ron’s head shot down, surprised, to look at her. She was wearing a pensive expression as she looked at him, blinking against the sunlight.</p><p>“I love you,” he said, and grabbed her hand as they walked back to the Ministry.</p>
<hr/><p>When they got back to the Ministry, Hermione and Nadheer went with Ron through the Visitor’s entrance, Ron grumbling all the while about having to answer the questions from the disembodied voice even though he already had a badge. When they arrived in the Atrium, the scene was much subdued since the morning, but oddly deserted. One of the paper bats fluttered down and landed on Hermione’s head. She smiled as it flew away.</p><p>The same woman’s voice that spoke in the lift was saying, “The Ministry is under a special alert. See the detailed message above the War Memorial Fountain.” A few moments of silence passed, and then, “The Ministry is under a special alert….”</p><p>A message flashed above the fountain: “ALL NON-ESSENTIAL STAFF ARE DISMISSED UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE. ESSENTIAL STAFF PROCEED WITH CAUTION, SUSPECT MALICIOUS POTIONS. ESSENTIAL STAFF, IF YOU ARE NOT CURRENTLY TAKING CONTRACEPTIVE AND STI POTIONS, PLEASE PROCEED TO THE HEALER STATIONED AT THE SECURITY DESK BEFORE REPORTING TO YOUR POST.”</p><p>Ron glanced at the Security Desk. Sure enough, there was a small queue of witches and wizards. Most of them looked older, which made sense, because younger people were more likely to take the potions as a matter of course. Ron grimaced, thinking about the breach in medical privacy that Kingsley apparently thought was warranted.</p><p>“Fuck,” Ron whispered. “I wonder what happened.”</p><p>“If Kingsley sent home all non-essential staff…” Hermione trailed off. “More people must have been hit.” She looked at Nadheer.</p><p>“I haven’t heard anything,” Nadheer said, “but Auror Potter asked us to stick with you even inside the building now.”</p><p>Ron grasped Hermione’s hand and started walking swiftly across the Atrium. He had to slow his stride to match Hermione’s. She was walking fast, but couldn’t keep up with his long legs. They reached the lifts quickly, nevertheless, and the ride to level three seemed to take ages.</p><p>After they’d passed through levels seven and six, Ron said, “You’re here all the time, but do you ever just come to the Ministry and have that paralyzing fear where you feel like you’re Polyjuiced and we’re on the hunt for a locket?”</p><p>Hermione smiled sadly. “At first it happened some.”</p><p>“I’m probably only feeling that way now because we’re trying to get somewhere quickly and it reminds me of running out of here and Yaxley and—”</p><p>“I know.” She squeezed his hand. “At least this time we probably won’t end up dead, only randomly having sex with people.”</p><p>“Hey, if we stick together, at least we’d probably only end up having sex with each other.”</p><p>Hermione laughed. “Much as I love having sex with you, I’d rather no one was watching and that I was in my right mind.”</p><p>“You’re such a prude,” Ron teased. “Frigid, frigid Hermione Granger.”</p><p>Nadheer, trying to stay professional, looked away with a small amused smile.</p><p>Hermione fixed him with a glare before reaching over and pinching his arse, hard.</p><p>“Oi!”</p><p>“Frigid my arse,” Hermione grumbled, but she was smiling.</p><p>They finally reached level three and proceeded quickly to the Pensieve Rooms, where they found Harry and Malfoy standing a bit awkwardly. Malfoy was reclining against the wall, his head leaned back. Harry was pacing in front of the door. Nadheer took up guard a little way down the corridor.</p><p>“There you are!” Harry cried. “Better when you’re here and I don’t have to worry that you’re ripping each other’s clothes off in public.”</p><p>“Likewise,” Ron said. At that, Malfoy’s eyes flew open and Harry’s eyes widened. “I mean,” Ron stammered, “glad you’re both, I mean…Anyway! So what happened?”</p><p><i>Oh, real smooth, </i>Hermione teased.</p><p>“Two more workers somehow succumbed to the potion—no one you know, but both on level one,” Harry reported. “They were both Stunned before anything was er, consummated. Kingsley’s been through to see Gordon Brown.”</p><p>Hermione was surprised. “They think the Muggles are in danger?”</p><p>“No, I don’t think so, but the Muggles would be confused if people started randomly having sex in public places. I mean, it’s bad enough for us even though we immediately suspected it was a potion. So he and Robards wanted to warn them, even though they don’t think it likely that anyone would target Muggles.”</p><p>Ron grunted. “It’s funny—I just assume that any plots like this are going to be even more dangerous for Muggles.”</p><p>Malfoy suddenly heaved a dramatic sigh. “Yes, of course, because all social cleavages are about Light versus Dark magic and Pure versus Muggle Blood, is that right, Weasley?”</p><p>“I just meant it’s—”</p><p>“Even if it is some sort of Pureblood traditionalists behind these attacks, blood status doesn’t have anything to do with one’s position on love potions. This isn’t about Muggles.”</p><p>Hermione pressed her lips together. “You’re right of course, Draco, but be reasonable—Ron already knew that. He’s not an idiot. Harry, is that what Robards is thinking?”</p><p>“Robards is going on the assumption that they’re trying to hit high-profile Ministry workers: Kingsley, us, maybe some others. They’ve got a team of Aurors tailing Kingsley and testing all of his food and drink before he can eat it. He’s annoyed, as you can imagine.”</p><p>Hermione began to giggle. Ron and Harry turned to her with questioning expressions and Malfoy raised a querulous brow.</p><p>“Granger,” Draco said, “given your role here, I’m a little surprised that you would laugh at people being threatened with potions that would render them unable to resist sexual assault—”</p><p>Hermione managed to quell her giggling. “Sorry. I just—I think it’s the stress. And adrenaline. It’s not funny. It’s just—I’ve known for months that I’m a target and likely to be hit with an illegal love potion. Our whole life has been rearranged because we’re assuming that I will. I’ve been on contraceptive potions and even those nasty potions that protect against STIs, because we know that I could easily get hit, despite the Auror department’s best efforts.” She paused, looking at Ron, a bit manic. “We wanted to have a baby, but we are waiting because it doesn’t seem safe to go off the contraceptive potions, presuming I actually want <i>Ron’s</i> baby!” She paused. “But somehow it never occurred to me that they might try to dose <i>Kingsley</i>!” She pressed her hand over her mouth to stifle her laughter.</p><p>Harry started to laugh with her. He grabbed her hands. “Can you imagine him just suddenly stopping everything he was doing and propositioning the person next to him?” He laughed harder, causing Hermione to lose herself a bit more.</p><p>Ron was happy to make light of this whole situation, he really was. But the first part of Hermione’s explanation was sitting too heavy in his throat for him to laugh. He looked up at Malfoy, who was watching, bemused, as Harry and Hermione roared with laughter over a very serious situation. Malfoy caught Ron’s eye.</p><p>“They sometimes…get like this,” Ron said, waving his hand vaguely. “Feminists laugh, too.”</p><p>At that, Malfoy joined the laughter.</p><p>“Alright, alright,” Harry finally said a few moments later. “We have some lovely memories to re-live. Let’s go in.” Hermione, finally calming down, walked through first, followed by Malfoy.</p><p>Ron grabbed Harry’s elbow. “How was lunch?” he asked, raising a brow slightly.</p><p>“It was fine,” Harry said. “Malfoy thinks he can figure out the potion easily enough, but he agrees that we won’t catch these people unless we have a good grasp of the entire situation, not just the nature of the potion, and that means finishing these memories.”</p><p>Ron nodded. “Anything else from Robards? Any leads?”</p><p>“Not yet. The memories of the workers at Wideye seem to have been wiped,” Harry said, walking in and taking his place around the Pensieve. “One of them vaguely remembers someone approaching the kiosk in costume.”</p><p>“Like, in a Halloween costume?” Ron asked, confused.</p><p>“Apparently,” Harry reported. “But we’re not sure it’s related, even.”</p><p>A knocking sounded at the door. “Excuse me,” a wizard in lime green robes said, poking his head in. “I’m Mediwizard Smith from St Mungo’s. We’re contacting all essential staff to confirm that you’re taking contraceptive and STI potions, as a precaution against the potions attack. I also have Ministry waivers for you to sign.” He waved his hand to indicate a cart that was wheeling itself along behind him, potions phials clanking against each other. He waved his wand, and four parchments soared through the air to each of them. “Sign those, please.”</p><p>Hermione grabbed the form and her eyes scanned it rapidly. She looked up. “The Ministry wants us to release them from liability in the case of a future potions attack.” She squeezed her eyes shut. “Those fuckers.”</p><p>The Mediwizard widened his eyes. “Look, I have nothing to do with those waivers, they just asked me to bring them around while I do the potions. If you have questions about the potions….”</p><p>“No, it’s okay,” Hermione said. “It’s not your fault.” She picked up a quill, signed the waiver, and Levitated it back to the Mediwizard. The others followed suit.</p><p>“So, if you please,” Mediwizard Smith said, “I need your names and potions status, and I can give you the potions if you need. You can come out in the hallway one at a time to maintain medical privacy.”</p><p>“There’s no need. Hermione Granger. Already taking the potions.”</p><p>The Mediwizard’s quill recorded her answer on a clipboard.</p><p>“Ron Weasley, already taking the potions.”</p><p>Harry glanced at Malfoy, then turned to the Mediwizard. “Harry Potter. Already taking the potions. The hazard of being around you two too often,” he joked. Ron tried to smile, but he suspected that it came off like a grimace. It was the truth—everyone close to them was taking the potions, even his parents and his ten-year-old niece. Ron tried not to think about the implications of that too much.</p><p>The quill finished recording the information as four eyes turned on Malfoy. Malfoy, face inscrutable, slowly stood and sauntered across the room and into the hallway. The Mediwizard followed him out.</p><p>The three sat in silence for about a minute, and then Malfoy walked calmly back into the room, with absolutely no indication in his face or demeanour whether he had just downed a phial of potions, or if he’d already been on them. What a Slytherin.</p><p>Harry stared at the git—quite shamelessly, in Ron’s opinion.</p><p>“Alright,” Hermione said, raising her wand to her temple to extract a memory. “So now we’re moving on to the Wizengamot hearing determining the restriction of love potions. Ready?”</p><p>The group nodded and entered the memory, landing in the Wizengamot courtroom.</p><p>“The first Pensieve memory I ever entered was a memory of the Wizengamot,” Harry said, looking around. Members of the Wizengamot and visitors to the hearing milled about, waiting for something to begin.</p><p>“Is this long?” Malfoy asked. “I’m sitting.” He found an empty seat and made himself comfortable, adjusting the way his robes fell behind him. The others followed him and sat.</p><p>“There we are,” Ron said, pointing.</p><p>Memory-Hermione was sitting next to Kingsley near the front of the room, and Ron sat next to Slughorn. Harry sat nearby, acting as Auror protection with a half dozen other Aurors in the room.</p><p>“When was this, again?” Malfoy asked, surveying the surroundings. “Elphias Doge looks like utter shite. Is he sick?”  </p><p>“A little over a year ago. I’m not sure,” Hermione answered, unsure how else to respond.</p><p>Just then, the Chief Warlock, Diarmad Barrach, who sat in the very middle of the front row in the plum-coloured robes of the Wizengamot, stood, announcing, “Legislative hearing of the third of May, 2007.” He paused, and the Court Scribe’s quill began recording his words. “Into the petition of the Minister for Magic to reclassify love and lust potions under the Decree for the Restriction of Potions Brewed With Malicious Intent or Effect.</p><p>“Petitioner representing the Minister’s office: Matilda Watson. Arguing against the petition: Tobias Stickles from the Brewing and Apothecary Retail Federation, Bertie Popkin from the Society for the Legalisation of Potions, and Rosa Titcomb from the Society for the Protection of Incantational Traditionalism. Interrogators: Brunhilde Stokke, Ernest Hawkworth. Court Scribe: Arastu Shotori.</p><p>“First, the Ministry’s representative, Matilda Watson, will present the case for the restriction of love and lust potions. Ms Watson.”</p><p>An imposing witch with voluminous, curly white hair stood and walked to the front of the courtroom. She wore a set of smart and modern robes that seemed to echo her smart and modern argument.</p><p>“Witches and wizards of the Wizengamot,” she began, “I am here today to make a case for the reclassification of love and lust potions, including but not limited to Amortentia, Draught of Amour, and Elixir of Lust, as Controlled Substances, illegal to brew, sell, or purchase, under the Decree for the Restriction of Potions Brewed With Malicious Intent or Effect. This case, which has been submitted in written form, has been cosigned by the Wizarding Council for Civil Liberties, the National Organization for Witches, and the Witches Reproductive Rights Federation, among other organizations.</p><p>“The case for the restriction of love and lust potions is simple. The use of these potions renders the drinker incapable of providing consent to sexual activity. All sexual activity that occurs as a result of love or lust potions is, therefore, and in a technical sense, rape.”</p><p>The assembled witches and wizards watched Watson in silence, listening with rapt attention to her radical words.</p><p>“In one modal use of the potions, a lovelorn person secretly doses their love interest. The person who ingests the potion becomes infatuated. This person is in no position to give consent in a way that passes legal muster. It is, in fact, already illegal to dose someone with a potion without their consent, though the easy availability of the potions and the fact that this seems to be their most common use puts into question whether the Ministry is at all serious about preventing this sort of behaviour.</p><p>“In another case—which statistics show is not a common use of love potions, but which is a case often invoked in hypothetical debates about the legality of love and lust potions—two people consent to the use of a love potion. Perhaps, the story goes, they are lovers who have fallen out of love but who don’t want to end their relationship. Perhaps they’ve been together for a long time and lost the spark. Perhaps they are a loving couple that just wants to experiment and see what happens if they throw back some potion.</p><p>“The fact remains, witches and wizards of the Wizengamot, that this is <i>still </i>a malicious and harmful use of the potion. A person who has ingested a love potion cannot revoke their consent. They cannot negotiate their sexual acts. They cannot be a willing participant in any sexual encounter.</p><p>“This might not comport with what you’ve been taught, but let me tell you the truth. All sex under the influence of a love potion is rape. All sex under the influence of a love potion is sexual assault.”</p><p>The memory changed, but this time it didn’t swirl and coalesce to a new scene; rather, it reminded Ron of watching movies when Harry or Hermione would do something called “fast forward.” A moment later, the witch named Matilda Watson was in her seat.</p><p>Chief Warlock Barrach stood. “Interested parties have been invited to argue against the proposed restriction. After that, the Wizengamot Interrogators will call experts to testify. First, we have Tobias Stickles from the Brewing and Apothecary Retail Federation.”</p><p>Ron snorted. “Tobias Stickles. It’s no less funny the second time around.”</p><p>Hermione shushed him, though Harry was smiling. Malfoy was not smiling. Ron suspected that with a name like “Draco Malfoy,” one was unlikely to poke fun at anyone’s name.</p><p>A slight but severe man rose to face the assembly. “Love potions,” he proclaimed, “compose a sizable portion of the annual revenue of British brewers and apothecarists. This has been the case for centuries.”</p><p>He flicked his wand, illuminating a chart. “As you can see here, love potions account for upwards of 5% of industry revenue. And this shows market size over time.” He flicked his wand again, changing the visual.</p><p>Malfoy leaned forwards on the bench and leaned over Harry to smirk at Hermione, “Wow, you made a real enemy of one Tobias Stickles, didn’t you, Granger?”</p><p>Hermione shrugged, an unrepentant grin on her face. “Of everything about this situation, annoying Tobias Stickles is one outcome with which I am completely fine.”</p><p>Stickles continued, “This means that love potions are a 75 million Galleon industry! The Ministry of Magic cannot in good conscience pass legislation that will harm the livelihood of brewers and apothecarists.”</p><p>Stickles turned around dramatically, calling to mind images of Professor Snape. “Moreover,” he articulated, “love potions have been a standard part of British wizarding society for centuries, since even before the invention of Amortentia in 1498. It is a part of who we are, and if it has survived this long, why would you think we can expunge it from our society now?”</p><p>“We at B.A.R.F. do not deny that the Ministry has a compelling interest in restricting the brewing and sale of certain potions and potions ingredients. We support the restriction of addictive recreational potions, and those lust potions that are already restricted. Let it not be said that B.A.R.F. is unreasonable. But we cannot support the expansion of the restriction to include mainstream love potions. It will threaten the continued existence of our industry.”</p><p>With that, Tobias Stickles waved his wand, causing his illustrations to disappear in a shower of menacing sparks, as he took his seat.</p><p>Hermione sighed. “It sounds no less hyperbolic the second time around, does it?”</p><p>Chief Warlock Barrach stood. “Next, the Wizengamot welcomes Bertie Popkin from the Society for the Legalisation of Potions.”</p><p>Malfoy crossed one of his legs over the other. “This should be interesting.”</p><p>Harry looked at him curiously.</p><p>“Pureblood traditionalists might support B.A.R.F.,” Malfoy explained, “but in general, <i>everyone</i> hates the libertarian clowns at S.L.O.P.”</p><p>Harry laughed.</p><p>Bertie Popkin stood. He wore drab, outdated robes. He was fairly young, and his hair was even messier than Harry’s. He bounced on his toes as he asserted, “There is no higher social goal than to give every mentally sound individual an opportunity to make their own decisions.” He paused, looking around the room. “To make their <i>own</i>,” he paused, enunciating wildly, “decisions.”</p><p>“Oh, sweet Merlin,” Malfoy murmured, and Ron couldn’t help but agree.</p><p>“This includes love and lust potions! If people are taking these potions of their own free will, and their use is not harming anyone else, what possible interest could the Ministry have in restricting their use? The Ministry contends that the use of these potions will inevitably cause harm, but giving a love potion to another person unknowingly is <i>already illegal. </i>So, I ask, what are we attempting to do here today? Protect people? No, because that is already accomplished with our current laws!”</p><p>Bertie Popkin ran a hand through his hair, causing it to stick up in a chaotic mess.</p><p>“And it must be said—witches and wizards of the Wizengamot, it <i>must </i>be<i> said—</i>that the restriction of the brewing and sale of love potions would set a dangerous precedent! What about all of the other potions that you think should remain legal? What about contraceptive potions, impotence potions, libido-increasing potions? How, I ask you, are those potions functionally different than love potions? If we restrict the sale of love potions, the restriction of these potions is the next logical step—inevitable, really!—and we cannot have that! Think of the danger to our liberty!”</p><p>“The fact that some people will abuse potions should not be the basis for the prohibition of the potions for all people, including law-abiding citizens. It would be an indefensible assault on our liberties.”</p><p>Bertie Popkin finished, bounced on his toes one final time, and took his seat.</p><p>“These arguments are not even the slightest bit logical,” Hermione sighed, shaking her head. “Yes, Bertie Popkin, love potions are <i>exactly</i> the same as contraceptive potions. There’s absolutely no way to stop the slippery slope.”</p><p>Malfoy raised an eyebrow, amused, perhaps, with sarcastic Hermione. For some reason, people who didn’t know her well were always surprised when they witnessed her wit.</p><p>Chief Warlock Barrach stood. “Finally, we have Rosa Titcomb from the Society for the Protection of Incantational Traditionalism.”</p><p>A witch of about sixty took her place at the centre of the room. She wore immaculate makeup and puce robes; her hair, which looked to be magically coloured, was in a heavily styled bob.</p><p>Ron glanced at current Hermione and then at memory-Hermione. Hermione <i>hated </i>Rosa Titcomb. Current Hermione looked freely annoyed; memory Hermione also looked annoyed, but more guardedly so—you would need to know her well to realise how annoyed she was.</p><p>“Good afternoon,” Rosa Titcomb simpered. “I am here today to argue against no less than the annihilation of wizarding culture. Just that little thing: the <i>annihilation of wizarding culture.</i>”</p><p>She looked around, inviting the assembled group to join in her polite outrage.</p><p>“Love potions are part of our cultural history, our lore, our norms. They are in our stories. They are in our dreams, they are in our <i>wishes </i>and our <i>desires.</i></p><p>“Imagine the young people, sitting in Potions lessons, eager to find out if they smell their paramour when they brew Amortentia. Imagine people everywhere, reading <i>Magic Without Duty </i>and wishing to, perhaps,” she paused to giggle, “reenact a <i>certain</i> scene.”</p><p>Ron looked at his companions, and saw that Harry and Malfoy had both turned to look at Hermione, who was tapping her fingers on her leg impatiently. It reminded Ron of her eagerness to answer questions during lessons at Hogwarts.</p><p>“Imagine a witch and wizard who have undertaken the sacred marriage vows, who desire to use the potion within the sanctuary of their marriage bed,” Rosa Titcomb said, with a confidential tone.</p><p>Hermione groaned. “The bloody marriage bed! Because of course, consensual use of a potion could only happen between a married witch and wizard.”</p><p>“How,” Rosa Titcomb continued, “can we even <i>consider </i>criminalising something that is so deeply a part of our culture and history? If we allow this type of restriction, we are allowing our culture to be thrown aside by young people with no regard for traditions, who do not understand what is at stake.”</p><p>She stopped, raised her hand to her chest. “I implore you, revered members of the Wizengamot. Do not forget from whence you came. Do not betray your culture, your ancestors, your <i>heritage. </i>Thank you.”</p><p>Rosa Titcomb sat, arranging her puce robes around herself and looking quite satisfied.</p><p>Chief Warlock Barrach rose. “That concludes the cases made by interested organizations. Next, we will allow Ms Watson to respond to their claims.”</p><p>The memory began to rush forwards again. “Draco, you’re smart enough to know why those arguments were absolute rubbish,” Hermione said, “so I didn’t want to waste time listening to this.”</p><p>Ron privately thought that the cases made by Stickles, Popkin, and Titcomb weren’t as easily dismissed as Hermione seemed to suggest, but he wasn’t about to say anything.</p><p>The memory coalesced on the Chief Warlock again standing. “Wizengamot Interrogators will now call for expert testimony. The first Interrogator will be Brunhilde Stokke.”</p><p>A witch wearing the plum-coloured robes of the Wizengamot rose and announced, “I call Ronald Weasley, of Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes.”</p><p>Memory-Ron stood, accepting a seat near the Chief Warlock that was used for testimony of those not accused of crimes.</p><p>“Mr Weasley, please describe your position and the circumstances of your expertise on love potions.”</p><p>“Hello,” memory-Ron said. “I am co-owner of Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes. We brewed and sold love potions until a few months ago, and I was in charge of the production of the potions. When we decided to stop selling the potions, I researched love potions further, and developed a line of alternative products that would allow us to recoup the lost revenue from the love potions.”</p><p>“And what type of alternative did you develop?” Stokke asked.</p><p>“I developed a potion that allows people to smell Amortentia, but not consume it. Or, rather, it produces the smells—just like Amortentia—but if one was to consume the potion, nothing would happen. It would pass through the body as harmlessly as pumpkin juice, only it would taste rather worse.” Memory-Ron gave a lopsided smile.</p><p>Ron was uncomfortable. It was strange to watch yourself like this. He had done a good job, but that didn’t mean he wanted to watch it again. He looked awkward up there—he wasn’t a smooth public speaker.</p><p>“So the purpose is only to allow people to determine how Amortentia smells to them?” Stokke prodded.</p><p>“Yes,” memory-Ron answered. “Much of the cultural significance of Amortentia is about the smells, not the administration of the actual potion. By developing this alternative, we allow people to continue experiencing Amortentia in ways that are culturally significant and harmless, while restricting the love potion, which is problematic.”</p><p>“How long did you practise these answers, Weasley?” Malfoy asked with an amused grin.</p><p>Ron couldn’t help it—he laughed. His speech did sound stilted, like he was reading—badly—from a script. “A lot,” he admitted.</p><p>“You did a good job!” Hermione insisted.</p><p>“And you’ve been selling this alternative potion for a few months now?” Stokke queried. “Have you seen changes in your sales?”</p><p>“We’ve been selling the new potion—which we’ve marketed as ‘Scents of Love’—for four months. We’ve seen slightly lower sales than we did with our range of love potions during this time period last year, but it was a less than 0.05% decrease in revenue. We hope that, with more effective marketing, the sales will increase to completely replace the lost revenue of the love potions.”</p><p>“Would other brewers and apothecaries be able to sell the alternative potion, or is it proprietary to Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes?”</p><p>“We hold a patent, but the instructions are available to any brewer or apothecary if they are willing to pay royalties, as is the common procedure with all new potions. And, of course, other potioneers are free to develop their own alternatives that remain within the law.</p><p>“We at Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes,” memory-Ron continued, “are convinced that the restriction of love potions is not only an ethical imperative, but also a prudent, forward-looking business decision.”</p><p>Malfoy let out a long whistle. “Weasley,” he said, “you are <i>whipped.</i>”</p><p>As one, Harry, Hermione, and Ron turned to glare at him. Malfoy, infuriatingly, just smirked at them.</p><p>“Thank you, Mr Weasley,” Stokke said, dismissing him with a wave.</p><p>Memory-Ron left the stand.</p><p>“Next,” Chief Warlock Barrach said, “Interrogator Ernest Hawkworth.”</p><p>A bearded wizard stood. “I call Horace Slughorn, retired Potions Master and Special Advisor to the Wizengamot.”</p><p>Slughorn heaved himself out of his seat and to the stand. “Hullo,” he wheezed amiably as he sat.</p><p>“Mr Slughorn, you are a long-time Potions Master and expert in the field, are you not?”</p><p>“Oh ho,” Slughorn said, “yes, I finished my training in the twenties, and started teaching at Hogwarts in 1931. During my tenure there, I mentored some of the most important witches and wizards of the last hundred years!”</p><p>Slughorn appeared delighted to be the centre of attention.</p><p>“Mr Slughorn,” Hawkworth asked, “given the nature of the potion, can a person who has ingested a love potion provide meaningful consent for a sexual encounter?”</p><p>Ron cringed, and recalled cringing the first time he’d heard Slughorn asked that question. They had to ask <i>Slughorn </i>about this. The man was ancient. Did he even know what consent was?</p><p>“Well, young man,” Slughorn said, “a person under the influence of a love potion can certainly agree verbally and physically to engage in a sexual act. But such agreement would not reflect their true state of mind. It is likely that a person under the influence of a love potion would agree to any sexual proposition from the person to which the potion is linked.”</p><p>“Therefore,” Hawkworth continued, “is it possible for a person under the influence of a love potion to say no to a sexual act, or to withdraw consent previously given?”</p><p>“No, no, I would say not. The potion is too strong.”</p><p>“In your professional opinion, do you think a person’s preexisting sexual preferences and inclinations would survive with the potion? That is, would a person under the influence of a love potion be likely to engage in types of sexual activity that they otherwise would not engage in?”</p><p>“Yes, I think it is likely that a person under the influence of a love potion would be likely to do, well.” He paused, feigning sheepishness. “Well, they’d do <i>anything, </i>wouldn’t they?”</p><p>Ron couldn’t help it; he shuddered. Hermione grabbed his hand.</p><p>“Mr Slughorn,” Hawkworth implored, “some people might suggest that a person under the influence of love potion is only operating under lowered inhibitions, and therefore the actions that they undertake represent things they would always have liked to do, but which they were too inhibited to do.”</p><p>Slughorn shook his head. “Oh, no. If a wizard by the name of Vulmaro Broggi who lived in Italy and whom I’d never met, brewed Draught of Amour and threw in one of his hairs, and I drank the potion, I would become immediately convinced I was in love with someone named Vulmaro Broggi. Nevermind that I’d never heard of him before and nevermind that I’ve never been sexually interested in a man. That’s the mechanism by which the potion works. It is absolutely not true that the potion only lowers inhibitions. If someone said that, they’ve confused love potions with Firewhiskey.” He chortled pretentiously.</p><p>“I really didn’t need to hear about Slughorn’s sex life,” Malfoy drawled.</p><p>Harry laughed. “Nor did I need to relive the memory. Ugh.”</p><p>The memory started to rush forwards again, and Ron watched, mesmerised, as the Wizengamot put up their hands to vote in fast motion. The memory returned to normal speed just as the Chief Warlock stood and pronounced, “The Wizengamot has spoken: love and lust potions, including but not limited to Amortentia, are now reclassified as as Controlled Substances, illegal to brew, sell, or purchase, under the Decree for the Restriction of Potions Brewed With Malicious Intent or Effect.”</p><p>The memory ended, and Ron found himself landing on the floor in Pensieve Room 6, bumping into Hermione as they fell back into their seats.</p><p>“I’ll tell you why this ended up such a disaster,” Malfoy announced.</p><p>The glares he received would’ve cowed a more circumspect wizard.</p><p>“Three main things,” Malfoy continued. “You took it to the Wizengamot too soon. You should have undertaken a campaign to change hearts and minds first.”</p><p>Ron did not want to deal with this. Fucking hell.</p><p>“Second, the arguments presented by the organizations against the ban were weak, but they were also straw man arguments. You should’ve gotten people in there to make really good arguments against the prohibition. That way, if the Wizengamot still voted to prohibit, no one could question it. Third, you made it seem like a huge collusion between Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes and the Ministry! Making royalties off the alternative! Which, did you know, one of the owners of Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes is married to the Minister for Magic’s Senior Undersecretary?”</p><p>Harry looked irate. “You know what, Malfoy—” Harry challenged, and Ron was transported back to Hogwarts, gearing up to try to keep Harry from pummeling Malfoy.</p><p>But Hermione stopped Harry’s righteous outrage by raising her hand. She sighed. “Draco’s right. I wish we’d had this foresight back then. I really thought it would blow over, and so did Kingsley. We were wrong.”</p><p>Malfoy grinned and waved his hand as if he was accepting a commendation.</p><p>Hermione rounded on him, and Ron could see a glint in her eye. “But unless you have a Time Turner, we’re stuck dealing with what happened in the past, and we’re all a little prickly about it, so do us a favor and keep your gloating to yourself.”</p><p>Malfoy raised his eyebrows, but shut his mouth.</p><p>“Alright,” she said, sitting up straight, “so, what happened after the prohibition is the most relevant part, from the perspective of this case.” Hermione raised her wand to her temple and extracted another memory.</p><p>“You okay?” Ron asked her, squeezing her hand.</p><p>She smiled, stoic and determined, and the group entered the Pensieve again.</p><p>They landed in Kingsley’s office, where a memory of Ron and Hermione talking with Kingsley, Harry, and Robards was playing out. “This was summer 2007,” Hermione informed them.</p><p>“There have been threats against Ms Granger,” Robards was saying, “that we’ve intercepted at the Ministry. Have you received any threats at your home?”</p><p>Memory-Hermione sat stiffly. “Yes. I have the letters here, except for the Howlers.” She handed a short stack of parchments to Robards.</p><p>He flipped through them quickly, Harry looking over his shoulder.</p><p>“You’d think they’d come up with another word for ‘cock,’” memory-Harry said, trying to lighten the mood.</p><p>Memory-Ron furrowed his brow at Harry, and Harry stopped talking.</p><p>“Alright,” Robards said. “Alright. These threats are specific and serious enough to justify action. We’re going to assign a group of Aurors to guard your home, and to escort you, Senior Undersecretary Granger, when you’re in public. So you will have an Auror guarding you from your home until you are safe in the Ministry.”</p><p>“Okay,” Hermione said.</p><p>“We’re also going to keep an eye on your families and on you, Harry,” Robards said. “Because of the way this was covered in the <i>Prophet, </i>people who want to blame someone will blame the three of you.”</p><p>“Well at least that’s a role we’re used to,” memory-Ron joked.</p><p>The memory changed, swirling in clouds of silver, until it rematerialised as Ron and Hermione’s living room. Memory-Ron and memory-Hermione sat on the sofa, Ron’s arm around Hermione’s shoulder. She was reading a stack of parchments and he was watching a football game on the television.</p><p>The Floo roared. It was a Floo-order pizza. Hermione looked at Ron. “You ordered pizza?”</p><p>“No,” Ron said.</p><p>She stood and retrieved the box, reading a note affixed to the lid. Her face went pale and she peeked in the box. “Immature, disgusting cretins,” she said, passing the box to Ron.</p><p>Over memory-Ron’s shoulder, they could read that the note said, “ENJOY THIS, BITCH, SINCE YOU CLEARLY DON’T HAVE ENOUGH OF IT IN YOUR LIFE.”</p><p>Memory-Ron looked up at Hermione, confused. He opened the box. The pizza was covered in sausage. The side of the box had been marked at the pizzeria, “Extra sausage.”</p><p>He dropped the box and stood to hug Hermione. “They’re arseholes.”</p><p>“I know,” she said, her face blanched.</p><p>“Think the pizza is safe to eat?” Ron asked, looking at the box over his shoulder, but Hermione scowled at him and Vanished the box.</p><p>The memory swirled. It rematerialised as Harry’s kitchen, the three friends sitting around the table laughing and talking. There was a knock at the front door, and when Harry answered it, he looked down to find a box with a note affixed to the top that read, “Ron Weasley.”</p><p>“What is it?” memory-Ron called from the kitchen. When Harry didn’t answer, they joined him at the door.</p><p>“We shouldn’t open it,” Hermione said.</p><p>“Well, true, and I’m glad that’s your reaction, but I am an Auror so I can go through the procedure to check if it’s safe. Do you want me to do it later, so you don’t have to see what’s inside?”</p><p>Ron shook his head. “Go on with it.”</p><p>Memory-Harry pulled his wand and began casting at the box, surrounding it with a shimmering field of purple sparks. A couple minutes later, he pronounced it harmless. “Want me to open it?”</p><p>Ron declined, walking up to the box and pulling the letter off the top, reading aloud, “Because yours is missing.”</p><p>“That cannot mean anything good,” Hermione observed.</p><p>Ron lifted the lid of the box to reveal a dozen dildos.</p><p>The memory swirled. Hermione was in the WWN office, conducting an on-air interview.</p><p>“I am not against romance or sex,” memory-Hermione was saying, “only against sexual violence and sex in which participants cannot give true consent.”</p><p>“So the issue really comes down to one’s interpretation of consent, do you think that’s right?” the host asked.</p><p>“That’s right, Miranda,” Hermione answered. “And if you look at consensus among experts about what consent is, you’ll find that there is broad consensus on what consent requires.”</p><p>“And what is that broad consensus?”</p><p>“Well, first, consent can be withdrawn by any party at any point. Second, consent must be voluntarily given and is not valid if coerced. Third, consent to engage in one sexual activity cannot be presumed to apply to a different sexual activity. Fourth, past agreement to engage in a sexual activity cannot be presumed as consent to engage in the sexual activity again. Fifth, consent cannot be given by a person who is incapacitated. It doesn’t take much consideration to see that love potions are problematic on nearly all of these qualifications.”</p><p>“And is this view of consent reflected in the law?” Miranda asked.</p><p>“Well,” Hermione explained, “the law says that engaging in sexual acts without consent is illegal, but it doesn’t specifically codify what consent is. Over time, our views of consent and sexual assault have evolved.”</p><p>“Let’s take a caller,” the host said. “You’re on Wizarding Wireless Network.”</p><p>“Hermione Granger is a frigid whore who has no idea how the real world works. She needs to be fucked hard by someone who knows what they’re doing and if they can fuck some sense into her she’d realise she wants a love potion as much as—”</p><p>The host finally succeeded in disconnecting the caller. “We apologise for that outburst and won’t be taking any more callers today,” the host said, flustered.</p><p>Memory-Hermione sat in her chair for a moment as if she’d been hit with a <i>Petrificus Totalus </i>before she recovered herself. “Thank you, Miranda. I’ll point out that valuing consent in sexual relationships is not a new thing. People have valued consent in sexual relationships for a long time, in part because consent is sexy—it’s a turn-on to have sex with someone who wants to have sex with you.”</p><p>The memory swirled. They were in Ron and Hermione’s kitchen, and the memory showed Harry arguing with Ron and Hermione.</p><p>“I’m not leaving,” memory-Harry said, crossing his arms over his chest. “Not after the threats we intercepted today. I’m staying put, or you’re spending the night at my house.”</p><p>“Harry, Nadheer is here,” memory-Ron said. “It’ll be fine.”</p><p>Harry’s angry face morphed into worry. “I know, but Nadheer is not me. He’s also been working for eight hours already.”</p><p>“If you want to stay,” Hermione said, “of course you can. But I suspect that you’re acting on emotion, not reason.”</p><p>“Of <i>course </i>I’m acting based on emotion!” Harry yelled. “Today at work Robards tells me that an anonymous person issued a 50 thousand Galleon reward to anyone who could dose my best friend with a love potion and publish photographic evidence, with an extra thousand if her breasts are in the photo, and an extra ten thousand for full nudity!”</p><p>Memory-Harry abruptly stopped talking, looking as if he wished he hadn’t spoken so plainly. The three friends looked at each other in silence for a moment, and then memory-Hermione walked over to Harry and wrapped him in a tight hug.</p><p>They stood there hugging for a few seconds, and then memory Ron said, “I’ll make us some tea.”</p><p>“Want to play Pictionary?” Harry mumbled through Hermione’s hair.</p><p>“Not with you, you dirty cheat,” Hermione said with a laugh, though her eyes were a hint watery.</p><p>The memory ended, and the group landed back on their feet in Pensieve Room 6.</p><p>Ron immediately pulled Hermione into a hug. “I’m sorry you had to watch that again,” he whispered.</p><p>“Me?” she said with a sly grin, though she did feel a bit shaky. “I’m the stoic one of the group. You two are the ones who can’t handle the heat.”</p><p>Ron looked over her shoulder at Harry and Malfoy. Harry looked weary, but Malfoy looked shocked.</p><p>“Has it continued?” Malfoy asked.</p><p>“Has what continued?” Ron replied.</p><p>“The threats and harassment.”</p><p>“Yes,” Hermione said. “Though it’s been better since all of our mail is searched and an Auror follows me around all day and night.”</p><p>“Actually,” Harry said, thinking, “hasn’t it been a bit quieter lately? I suspect whatever group is behind the coordination of the harassment switched tactics and started planning for this potions attack against the Ministry.”</p><p>“Doesn’t that seem a bit too organised, Harry?” Ron asked. “Some wankers Floo-delivering sausage pizza doesn’t exactly speak to high-level organization.”</p><p>Harry shrugged. “Who knows?”</p><p>“What did you do with all of those dildos?” Malfoy asked.</p><p>Hermione opened her mouth, but then closed it. Ron could feel his face turning red. Harry looked suspiciously at the floor.</p><p>Malfoy raised an eyebrow, and then held up one hand. “Never mind. I do <i>not </i>want to know. I thought I was being facetious.”</p><p>It wasn’t that Ron thought there was anything improper about their dildo-related actions. There was nothing wrong with adults doling out dildos to their friends and keeping one for themselves because it would be a shame to let state-of-the-art magical dildos go to waste. It was just that he didn’t really feel like admitting it to <i>Malfoy. </i></p><p>Harry looked mortified. “We didn’t use them <i>together</i>!” he clarified unhelpfully. “Separately! Actually, I have no idea what they did with their dildo and I don’t want to know.”</p><p>“Harry,” Ron hissed, “stop talking.”</p><p>Malfoy, though, didn’t say anything. He stared, eyes wide, at Harry, with an expression that was somewhere between amusement and shock. And something else Ron couldn’t—wasn’t going to try to—place.</p><p>“So, um, are we done with the memories?” Ron said, in a clumsy attempt to change the subject away from dildos and back to the safe ground of the protracted campaign of harassment and intimidation.</p><p>Harry jumped a bit, looking away from Malfoy and back to Ron. “Oh, er, actually. I have some more to add, and then I think we can be done. Hermione, Ron—you don’t need to watch these memories. Some of the Auror side of things.”</p><p>The look that Hermione gave Harry was so reminiscent of McGonagall that Ron suspected she might turn into a cat. “Harry James Potter,” she said, “when have we ever let you go off on your own to protect us?”</p><p>Harry had the sense to look penitent. “Alright, it’s just—you know how, when the patients aren’t nearby, Healers talk about them like they’re not human beings? That sort of thing happens with Aurors, too. And I don’t want you to feel, like, objectified or something.”</p><p>Malfoy snorted. Harry pretended to ignore him.</p><p>Hermione flashed him an amused smile. “Merlin forbid I should feel objectified while discussing arseholes who are trying to get naked photos of me. We can handle it.”</p><p>Harry sighed, looking apologetically at Ron, then raised his wand to his temple and closed his eyes. A moment later a silvery substance wisped out of his head. He flicked it into the basin and said, “Okay then. Let’s go.”</p><p>The group entered the memory, landing in one of the Auror conference rooms. “Morning briefing, right before the meeting we saw with Robards in Hermione’s memories,” Harry informed them just as the memory of Robards started talking.</p><p>“Alright, team. We’ve intercepted dozens of owls with letters making credible and specific death and rape threats against Hermione Granger, some of them also against her husband Ron Weasley. Ms Granger, as you know, is Senior Undersecretary to Minister Shacklebolt, and works on Level One. Mr Weasley works in Diagon Alley at Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes. The Granger-Weasley home is in Ottery St Catchpole. The two often spend time at the senior Weasley house, the Burrow, in Ottery St Catchpole, and with Harry Potter, Ms Granger’s Muggle parents in Oxfordshire, and Mr Weasley’s siblings, of which there are five.” Robards flicked his wand, and the locations of the family members were projected onto the wall.</p><p>“Here is an example of the types of threats being made.” Robards waved his wand at the wall and a copy of a letter appeared on the wall.</p>
<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>‘<i>Hermione Granger, bitch enjoy your frigid cunt today because tomorrow we’re going to find you in Ottery St Catchpole and fuck you in every orifice until you bleed. I’m going to drink your blood out of your cunt after I rip it open. Youll wish you could get your hands on a Time Turner so you could go back and never stick your Mudblood nose into things you could never understand.’</i></p>
</blockquote><p>Robards placed his hands on the table. “How are we going to keep Ms Granger and Mr Weasley safe from assault?”</p><p>Ron had never seen that threat before. His face felt numb. His ears—his ears were ringing?</p><p>Memory-Harry looked like he was waging an inner war against the possibility of storming out of the office and going after the letter writer like a lone ranger, but he managed to calm himself down. Staring at the list of names on the wall, Harry asked, “Sir?” When Robards looked up, Harry continued, “Do you think everyone on that list, including me, is in danger, or that these are the locations where Hermione and Ron might be attacked?”</p><p>“We have received no threats against anyone other than Ms Granger and Mr Weasley.”</p><p>Harry nodded, but he didn’t look relieved.</p><p>“Auror-strength wards on all of these residences, sir?” Auror Zane asked.</p><p>“Yes,” Robards said, aiming his wand at another wall, where a plan for warding the residences appeared. “With Muggle-protocol wards in place for the senior Grangers. Mac, I want you to choose a Junior Auror and take on the warding.”</p><p>“Yes, sir.”</p><p>“What else?” Robards asked.</p><p>“Auror protection of Ms Granger and Mr Weasley, sir?”</p><p>“I agree that’s necessary at this point, but the question is what level of protection. Does it merit someone tailing her twenty-four hours a day? That’s going to get mighty interesting, considering that Aurors assigned to her inside the Ministry would need high-level security clearance due to her work with the Minister.”</p><p>“Moderate security,” memory-Harry suggested. “Someone to guard her house, but not follow her around inside, tail her in public, leave her once she’s safely inside the Ministry, meet her outside at the end of work. And undercover Auror protection at Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes—Ron isn’t as much of a target, but the nature of the shop is too risky. It’s filled with explosives and potions—someone could do real damage there.”</p><p>“Reasonable plan, Potter,” Robards said. “Does anyone disagree?”</p><p>“What about the family members, boss?” Auror Sloane asked.</p><p>“Well,” Robards said, “they’re getting extra protection on their homes. If we receive any threats against them, we can reassess. Potter, watch your back. Due to the nature of your…fame and history, you would be a likely target. Auror Lehri, I am assigning you to head the team guarding Ms Granger and Mr Weasley.”</p><p>Nadheer nodded.</p><p>The memory swirled, but landed them right back in the same office. This time, Harry and Robards were the only Aurors in the room, and memory-Harry was screaming.</p><p>“THE PROTECTIONS ARE NOT ENOUGH!” he yelled. “EVEN WITH THE AURORS INTERCEPTING THEIR POST, THESE ARSEHOLES MANAGED TO GET A GIANT BOX OF DILDOS TO RON AT MY HOUSE! THEY’VE ALREADY HAD TO CLOSE THEIR FLOO! THEY’RE ALREADY BEING TAILED BY AURORS! IT’S NOT WORKING! YOU’RE GOING TO LET HERMIONE GET ATTACKED!”</p><p>Robards sat quietly through this diatribe. “Are you quite finished, Auror Potter?”</p><p>Memory-Harry just looked at him, arms crossed over his heaving chest, still fuming.</p><p>“I’ll have you remember, Harry, that the Auror force is not to blame for your friends’ endangerment—whoever is behind the threats is. If you want to help them, let’s find the culprits. Until then, their protection is excellent. You’ll notice that even the post monitoring has been successful—had you not been there, the dildos would’ve been opened by Aurors in the Ministry and disposed of before they fell into the hands of your friends.”</p><p>“But!”</p><p>“No,” Robards stopped Harry with a raised hand. “No. If you want to keep your security clearance for this case, you will calm down. Because you’re acting like a worried parent, and you know how helpful worried parents are around investigations.”</p><p>The memory swirled. They landed once again in the same office. This time it looked like another morning briefing, if the assembly of coffee-drinking Aurors was any indication.</p><p>“We’ve received an anonymous tip from someone involved in the potions industry that there are people developing a new type of love potion that is somehow more malicious than Amortentia,” Robards said. “This person didn’t want to be identified, but became convinced that the potion under development is dangerous. They said it involves moonstone.”</p><p>“We need more information from the source,” memory-Harry insisted.</p><p>Robards sighed. “I agree, Auror Potter, which is why it’s unfortunate that the source is anonymous and did not give us any way to contact them.”</p><p>“How did they contact you?” an Auror asked.</p><p>“They sent a post owl with a warded letter. The letter could only be opened by me, and after I finished reading it, it Vanished.”</p><p>“What else do we know?” Nadheer questioned, and Ron felt bad for the man. He’d been following Hermione around for months, under a barrage of constant threats, but with no clues or evidence with which to hope for a conclusion to the case. He had almost nothing to work with, and was tasked with protecting two very high-profile civilians who were often to be found with <i>the</i> two most high-profile people in magical Britain.</p><p>“They said that the group thinks they can exact some sort of vigilante retribution through the new potion. The source used the phrase, ‘they say they will teach that bitch a lesson.’”</p><p>“Well what are we supposed to do with this information? It’s not very helpful, is it?” memory-Harry asked.</p><p>“I agree that it’s not ideal, Auror Potter. But as we move forward, we remember Mad-Eye.” Robards pointed to a giant gold plaque on the wall of the office that read,</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>
<i>CONSTANT VIGILANCE</i><br/>
<i>In memory of Alastor “Mad-Eye” Moody, 1942–1997</i></p>
</center><p>The memory ended, and the four landed back in the Pensieve room.</p><p>Ron and Hermione rounded on Harry. Hermione’s hand was on her hip. Harry took a step backwards.</p><p>“What the fuck, mate?” Ron said. “Why didn’t you tell us about the tip on the new potion?”</p><p>“I—I didn’t want to worry you! And I can’t tell you details about ongoing investigations without Robards’s permission! And you saw—it’s not like I really knew anything, anyway.”</p><p>“Still,” Hermione chided, “you could’ve told us. You’d expect us to tell you if <i>we</i> heard something!”</p><p>“Alright, I’m sorry, okay?” Harry held up his hands. “I won’t do it again.”</p><p>“So some potioneer got spooked about how illegal and dangerous this new potion is,” Malfoy said, “and submitted an anonymous tip to the Ministry that is so vague as to be almost useless. We can assume that means that if they had given any more information, it would also give away their identity, don’t you think, oh Chosen Auror?”</p><p>Harry glared at Malfoy, but nodded.</p><p>“But we can assume that the new potion the source referred to is not just a love potion, but something different, and that we should consider the moonstone.” Malfoy Conjured a parchment and a prissy-looking quill and began to scribble some notes. “I need to get that coffee into my lab and run some tests on it.”</p><p>“Coffee,” Harry moaned. “I wish I had a cup.”</p><p>“Draco,” Hermione said. He stopped scribbling and met her eyes. “There’s one more thing I think you should see.” She tapped a purple folder with her wand, and at the touch, the folder unsealed, revealing a stack of papers inside. She handed the folder to Malfoy.</p><p>On the front of the folder, Ron had scribbled, “You amaze me. Don’t give up,” and a little heart. He could feel his face turning red. Merlin, he hadn’t ever considered that <i>Malfoy </i>would read that.</p><p>But Malfoy opened the folder without commenting on Ron’s saccharine scrawl. He pulled out the first parchment.</p>
<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
  <i>Ms Granger,</i>
</p>
  <p>
  <i>I just wanted to let you know that I am so grateful for your work. I know you’re getting a lot of crap right now. I don’t have much of substance to say, but I want you to know how much I respect you. The work you’re doing is so important!</i>
</p>
  <p>
  <i>Ena Sprem</i><br/>
<i>Liverpool</i>
</p>
</blockquote><p>Draco set the parchment on the table and reached for the next.</p>
<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
  <i>To Hermione Granger:</i>
</p>
  <p>
  <i>I was sexually assaulted with a love potion in school. I have spent six years trying to pretend it didn’t happen, and on the rare occasion that I tell people about it, they don’t even agree that what happened to me was rape.</i>
</p>
  <p>
  <i>I can’t tell you how much it means to me to have seen you in the public eye talking about this. You make me feel like I’m not crazy. </i>
</p>
  <p>
  <i>In solidarity,</i><br/>
<i>Isobel Burns</i>
</p>
</blockquote><p>The next item in the folder was a photo of two children. One of them, a girl, waved at the camera wearing a shirt that said, “ASK ME ABOUT MY FEMINIST AGENDA.” A boy stood next to her holding up a peace sign. His shirt said, “YOUR BODY YOUR CHOICE.” Their mother had scribbled on the back of the photo:</p>
<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
  <i>Thank you for being a role model for all of us. </i><br/>
<i>Niamh Cooper (and Lottie, 10, and Augustus, 8)</i>
</p>
</blockquote><p>Malfoy put the photo on the table and glanced at the next item, an article cut out of <i>Witch Weekly </i>titled, “If You Romanticise Chambrs Cosworth, You’re Having A Rape Fantasy.” The next was a cover story about Hermione from <i>Tempus Magazine. </i>A flattering photo of her smiled from the cover next to the words, “Hermione Granger: An Intimate Look at the Unintimidated Reformer.”</p><p>Malfoy flipped through the rest of the letters and put them back in the folder, handing it to Hermione. Ron clenched his teeth—if Malfoy belittled Hermione’s folder of hope, Ron would have to hex him.</p><p>But Malfoy simply said, “Impressive, Granger. I reckon we’d better find the arseholes who are trying to hurt you.”</p><p>She nodded, seemingly satisfied that Malfoy understood what was at stake.</p><p>“Alright, so what do we do next?” Ron asked.</p><p>Malfoy gave an imperious look and said, “Well, Weasley, I’d say you three can bring me gifts of fealty while I figure out what type of potion we’re dealing with.”</p><p>Ron rolled his eyes.</p><p>“Did anyone notice anything from the memories that you think worth noting or exploring?” Harry asked. “I was hoping we’d see some clues while we were bringing Malfoy up to speed, but honestly, nothing is jumping out at me.”</p><p>“The anonymous tip about the moonstone will probably be useful,” Malfoy replied, “once I’m in the lab.”</p><p>“Do you think the Ministry is doing enough to protect essential staff?” Hermione asked. “If these people are trying to target me, or Kingsley, or Harry, by just dosing as many innocent people as necessary—” She sighed. “I’m really not comfortable with the waiver they had us sign. It’s like we’ve all just legally agreed to get raped.”</p><p>“You know how the legal department is,” Harry grumbled. “They’re probably beside themselves with worry about what will happen with the workers who are already victims, especially the two from the, er, Atrium.”</p><p>Ron glanced at his watch. “I need to leave to go pick up Victoire. And I should probably stop by the Burrow and talk to Mum after that.”</p><p>Hermione nodded. “Alright, you go on ahead, I’ll meet you at home later.”</p><p>Ron stood and began to tidy the mess they’d made in the room.</p><p>“So Potter,” Malfoy said, “am I allowed to carry the potions evidence in the coffee cup out of the Ministry, or are you going to insist on coming home with me?”</p><p>“I am not going to insist on <i>coming home with you</i>,” Harry sneered, “I am going to act as an Auror guard to maintain the integrity of the evidence. This isn’t a joke, Malfoy.”</p><p>Malfoy smirked. “Of course it’s not. I wonder how strong this potion is. I wonder if it can affect you through skin penetration—that is, if you touched it.”</p><p>“No,” Ron said, “the first coffee splashed on my leg and I—” but Malfoy and Harry were paying him no heed.</p><p>“First of all,” Harry said, “I know what penetration is. Second of all, are you suggesting I am such an incompetent Auror that I am going to accidentally dose myself with evidence while escorting you to your lab?”</p><p>“I suggested no such thing!” Malfoy snapped.</p><p>Hermione looked at Ron. <i>Oh, come and stir my cauldron, </i>she sang in his head. <i>And if you do it right, I’ll boil you up some hot, strong love, To keep you warm tonight!</i></p><p>Ron shook his head with a smile.</p>
<hr/><p>Ron Apparated just outside the wards of his house. His annoyance at not being able to Floo home had mostly faded now that it had become habit, and when he got his bearings, his first sight was Nadheer standing guard.</p><p>Nadheer walked forwards, waving his wand to allow Ron through the wards. At first, an Auror had followed Hermione around all day and another Auror had been stationed at Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes. But then, when the threats escalated, the Auror protocol had increased. Now, one Auror was at their home at all times, plus an Auror with Hermione, and an Auror at the shop.</p><p>“Hey, Nadheer. How’s your day?”</p><p>“Better here than at the Ministry,” he said with a smile. “Nothing to report here.”</p><p>“That’s what I like to hear!” Ron smiled and clapped Nadheer on the back. He looked forward to the end of this nonsense, when they could actually hang out with him. They’d gotten to know their contingent of Auror guards so well, but the Aurors were always working and unable to enjoy their company.</p><p>Ron walked inside. “I’m home!”</p><p>“I’m in the living room!” Hermione called.</p><p>Ron took off his robes and boots and walked across the house. Fuck, what a day.</p><p>Hermione was curled up on the sofa, a blanket tucked over her legs, books and papers scattered over her lap and the sofa. Her wand was stuffed in her hair. Ron’s chest constricted with how much he loved her, and with relief that they’d made it through the threats of the day. As much as he pretended he’d be fine if she got hit in a potions attack, he knew he’d be an utter mess if it actually happened.</p><p>“Hey,” he said, and she looked up with a smile.</p><p>“I’m trying to research the legality of those waivers,” she said, “because I know if I spend my time researching the potion, Draco will feel like I’m stepping on his toes, but I can’t sit here and do nothing.”</p><p>“Mum sent me home with food,” Ron said, holding up a dish.</p><p>“Oh, excellent. How is everyone?”</p><p>“Victoire is upset with a boy named Roger, and Roger called her bossy. Roger also pulled her hair. I did not tell her that Roger probably fancies her, even though he clearly does, because I don’t want her to think people show romantic interest through violence.”</p><p>Hermione smiled. “You’re such a good feminist.”</p><p>Ron laughed. “But Roger totally <i>does </i>fancy her. Anyway. I dropped her off with Fleur, who is sick but on the mend, and then I went to the Burrow. Mum sat me down with a mug of tea and made me give her a minute-by-minute rundown of the day. She’s furious, of course, and mad that all of us at the Ministry were in danger today. She said she needed to do something, so she made a week’s worth of lunches for you, me, Harry, dad, and Percy, and—get this—she warded each individual lunch, so there’s no way anyone could spike it with a potion.”</p><p>“She warded the <i>lunches</i>?”</p><p>“You know it.”</p><p>Hermione laughed. “I love your mum.”</p><p>Molly was outraged at the harassment against Hermione and Ron, and had been spending most of her time worrying about them. Hermione suspected that Molly secretly loved Chambrs Cosworth, but she’d been nothing but supportive of Hermione and the cause.</p><p>“I called my parents,” Hermione said. “They’re good. They spent the entire call telling me about how they’re packing for a trip to the British Dental Association conference. The trip isn’t for ten days, but my mother read a tip that you should roll your clothes instead of fold them, so she’s planning to try that.”</p><p>Ron snorted. “Did you tell them about the attack?”</p><p>“No,” Hermione said, sounding uncertain. “I hate to worry them. They’re already shaken up about me being under constant Auror guard.”</p><p>Ron nodded. “I’m going to go serve up this food. Shepherd’s pie, I think.”</p><p>He walked into the kitchen and set the dish on the counter. He waved his wand and two plates flew out of the cupboard and landed next to the dish.</p><p>“Do you want wine?” Ron called.</p><p>“Do you have to ask?” Hermione yelled back.</p><p>Ron grabbed a bottle and poured two glasses. He was grabbing a spoon to serve the dinner when Hermione’s voice called, “So how long until we accidentally walk in on Harry having sex with Malfoy?”</p><p>Ron began to laugh loudly, happy to let it out after holding it in all day. “I don’t know—tomorrow? Harry’s not very patient, is he?”</p><p>Hermione’s laugh echoed through the house.</p><p>“When did Harry last see Malfoy?” Ron asked, serving the shepherd’s pie.</p><p>“I don’t know,” came the reply. “Maybe last spring at that charity function at the Ministry? Didn’t he say something about that?”</p><p>“Malfoy <i>is</i> good-looking,” Ron yelled.</p><p>“Your teenage self would be horrified to hear you say that!” she called with a laugh.</p><p>“Well I’m not blind, woman!”</p><p>Ron Levitated the plates and glasses into the living room. He didn’t feel like a proper at-table meal, he felt like collapsing on the sofa and not moving for hours. Hermione seemed to agree, reaching for the wine glass and balancing a plate on her knee. She waved her wand and the papers and books piled themselves neatly on the floor next to the table.</p><p>“Did you convince Harry to go to the Halloween party?” Ron asked.</p><p>“No,” Hermione sighed. “Though I did confirm that D.A.P.P.E.R. has changed the costume magic, and after I told Harry that he said he would at least consider it.”</p><p>“Good,” Ron said, tucking in.</p><p>“So you think Malfoy will figure out this potion quickly?” she asked, taking a sip of wine.</p><p>“Yes, I’m sure he will. Because he won’t miss an opportunity to boast about it.” Ron chewed. “What’s Harry’s plan for tomorrow?”</p><p>“Well, depending on how much Malfoy discovers, they may interview some of the big Potions suppliers. It seems like a long shot, but we have to do something. Nadheer says you and I shouldn’t go out in the field like that, so Harry and Malfoy will go. We can work in the Ministry, look at any new leads that Robards or Kingsley have. Unless you want to go back to the shop tomorrow?”</p><p>“No,” Ron said. “No, I’m staying with you.”</p><p>“You’re just saying that because you want to be the one standing next to me if I’m hit with this potion,” she said with a half smile.</p><p>“You bet your sweet arse,” Ron said, returning her grin. She’d taken off her jumper when she got home, and her camisole was low enough to show the curve of her breasts. She saw him looking and raised an eyebrow.</p><p>Earlier in the day—with all of the sexual assault and terrible memory reliving and discussion of Harry having sex with Malfoy—Ron would’ve claimed that he wouldn’t be able to even think about sex for a week. Or at least a day. But perhaps he was still young and virile enough that even all of that nonsense couldn’t suppress his hormones for long.</p><p>He set his plate aside. “Want to finish dinner later?” he asked. He leaned over, wanting to touch her, but her plate was in the way, so he grabbed it and set it aside.</p><p>“Smart man, taking away the plate instead of the wine,” she joked, taking a big sip of wine before putting it on the table behind her. She rose up on her knees and straddled his lap.</p><p>“Consider this my enthusiastic consent,” she said with a laugh, burying her head in his neck and kissing under his ear.</p><p>“Fuck, please stop talking about consent,” Ron breathed, grabbing her hips and shifting her closer.</p><p>She pulled back, her hair wild around her shoulders, her brown eyes looking at him intently. “No, I don’t think I will stop talking about it,” she said. “Because I want to tell you,” she paused to kiss his nose, “<i>exactly,” </i>she kissed his dimple, his stubble scratching her lips, “what I want you to do to me.”</p><p>“Oh <i>Merlin,</i>” Ron moaned, bringing his hands up to her face. “Yes, keep talking about it.”</p>
