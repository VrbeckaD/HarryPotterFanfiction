<p>
  <span>The Yule Ball was near as it was almost the beginning of December. The whole castle was in the Christmas spirit as well were the teachers. Most of them didn't want to go through the whole process of correcting papers so they gave our less homework and shorter essays but they promised to give more after the ball and Christmas. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Girls traveled in packs giggling to themselves while boys tried to separate these packs and ask out a girl of their liking. Most of the time they were unsuccessful and more than half chickened out and didn't end up asking out the girl they wanted. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Ginny Weasley and Hermione Granger were no exception. Ginny participated in the heated discussion of the guys and girls that were going out. Hermione mostly stuck to reading but sometimes joined in. Although it seemed like Hermione wasn't paying attention she knew every date the way she knew the whole Charms book. She kept up with the gossip and latest news on the guy-front. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Only Ginny and Harry knew that Hermione already had her eye on someone. Hermione had turned down three people just waiting for him to ask her as Harry had assured he would. They boy was a red head in her class. Hermione almost always called him daft whenever he would drone on about Quidditch with Harry. They had their arguments but always made up as they spent so much time together. Being good friends with his sister was helpful but annoying whenever Ginny would tease her about him... about Ron  </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry was just as stuck as Hermione although he made no effort to reach out to the girl. He knew her of course and talked to her a lot but he made no effort to try to move their relationship past a friendship. Ginny kept him awake sometimes when he had a good day with her. Harry was glad to be on speaking terms with Ginny and watched her very carefully. Harry stayed up thinking about her. They way her bright, red hair fell easily down her back. How her chocolate eyes could pierce him when she was angry or when she was happy they lit up. When she laughed she tossed her head back and looked so cute and pretty. Anytime and anywhere Harry James Potter could admit that Ginny Weasley was beautiful but he could never say that out loud due to the one person that stood in his way. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Ron. </span>
  </em>
  <span>Ron loved Ginny and was very protective of her. He scolded Ginny for flirting with any boy until she put on a cute pouty face. Ron then softened and would hold her close saying "I just can't lose you." </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione let her eyes flutter open as soon as she woke up. She quickly changed into some nice robes and sat on her bed. Hermione was thinking about what to get Ron for Christmas as today she was going with Ron, Harry and Ginny to Hogsmeade to go Christmas shopping. She was going to get him a book as she usually did but she was giving that to everyone and she wanted his present to be different and special. She couldn't think of anything that would appeal to him but also show how he was special. As she was thinking she decided to ask Ginny which would be helpful since she was his sister. Hermione also smiled silently to herself as she wanted to know what Ginny was going to get for </span>
  <em>
    <span>her</span>
  </em>
  <span> special someone. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She raced to ran to Ginny's dorm and whispered "Come on, Gin. Wake up." Hermione knew she wasn't supposed to be in her dorm but this was an exception. She knew that Ginny would not get up so early like this so she decided to wake her up herself but Ginny just rolled over on the bed to avoid waking up. Hermione pulled the warm blanket of her bed and dashed over to Ginny's dresser to get her some clothes because it cold. She took out some jeans and a white shirt and threw them to Ginny. Ginny was slowly starting to wake up while putting on her jeans and her shirt. Ginny grabbed her old Weasley sweater from on top of her dresser and put it on while still shivering. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"It's cold today, Gin, and since we are going to be outside I suggest you bring a strong jacket, mittens and scarf. Oh... before I forget what are you getting Harry for Christmas?" Hermione said mischievously. Ginny had just been grabbing her winter things out of her trunk so her back was to Hermione. The question had come out of nowhere and had startled her because that was exactly what she was thinking of. Ginny just shrugged but decided to turn things to Hermione. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"I don't know what to get him maybe something Quidditch related. Anyway what are you getting for Ron." Ginny said turning around to face Hermione. Hermione sat up just as startled as Ginny when she had received her question. Hermione only smiled at the ground and did not meet Ginny's eye "I was going to ask you. If you knew anything that he would like... something that is special. I was going to get Ron a book but I get almost everyone that!" Ginny only smiled at Hermione's answer that was honest but she knew that Hermione was a little frustrated in herself for not being able to think of something "I think he will like something that is special and unique. Something that no one else in the world could have." Ginny answered honestly to Hermione's honest question. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Since you asked a question that was honest then I will ask you something. Do you know what Harry will like?" Ginny said looking Hermione dead in the eye. Hermione expecting this question already had an answer and needed no time to think."He would want something that you made. Something that comes from you, your time, and your hands."</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Ginny had never thought of making something for Harry but it was a good idea. Although she would need inspiration on what to make so she decided to still go shopping with the trio. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>All four of them had met up in the Great Hall to eat breakfast. It wasn't as crowded as a school day but each table still had a few people sitting at them. Hermione was still pondering what she was going to get Ron. She needed to get something unique but if she bought it then the store may have another one. What if she bought something and then she changed it. If she changed to fit Ron and his style. While thinking though she had barely touched her food and even though she had very little to eat. Her idea made her very light and happy.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It was time to go into Hogsmeade and Ron and Hermione stepped in front of Ginny and Harry. Ron kept tilting his head to get a peak of Hermione. She seemed very happy and energetic even though she had very little breakfast. Something was making her glow and it made her seem happy and very pretty. He never said a thing to her </span>
  <span>but just silently watched her. Ron also didn't notice how Ginny and Harry were taking turns looking at each other until Harry elbowed Ginny to point out what Ron was doing. Ginny smiled and smacked her hand onto her mouth to stop herself from laughing. Harry himself felt a little sense of pride for making Ginny laugh. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Ron was rather excited to go Christmas shopping because this year he had gotten some pocket money from his parents to get gifts. Harry had also left him some money by giving it to Fred and telling him to give it to Ron. He easily though of what to get everyone in the family. Bill a journal to write down his findings, Charlie some dragon food, Percy just some book, Fred and George some supplies for their candies, Ginny a nice scarf, his mum some yarn for the Weasley sweaters and some muggle items which he got from Harry for his dad. Harry was also simple a refill for his Quidditch kit. Hermione was... supposed to be simple. Ron was going to get her a book and get her over with but now he wanted something that would make glow with joy just like this morning. He couldn't think of anything that would make her very happy besides a new book. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He sighed rather loudly making Hermione perk up from her own inner thoughts. She took one look at him and knew that he was deep in thought as she was. Hermione debated asking him if he was alright for a while until she noticed that Ginny and Harry were talking pleasantly. She decided to ask him because it wouldn't hurt. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"You alright, Ron" Ron woke up from his thoughts to look at Hermione. She was looking at him with a curious smile and her head was tilted just a little to give her a cute kind of look. Ron felt his ears turn bright pink just a little under her gaze. He hoped that it would only make him look cold as everyone else had pink ears to. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Fine. It's just that I don't know what to get as a present for someone." Ron hoped that his reply was not obvious. Hermione was not called the smartest of them all for nothing. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She nodded. "You just seemed frustrated. That sigh was pretty loud and I think many people heard it." Hermione looked at him smiling that same smile that made her glow. He smiled back at her. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>What Ron didn't realize was that a single butterfly was flying in Hermione's stomach. She always liked it when he smiled at her. Hermione always liked his real and genuine smile because she knew that under all that toughness was a sweet guy. She just wished she could pull him out more often.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Here we are guys. Let's meet up here after we go shopping." Harry said pointing to a table outside Florean Fortescue's Ice Cream Parlour. Harry nodded to Hermione as they were going shopping together. They had agreed that Hermione went with Harry and Ginny with Ron. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Ron grabbed a bag and tossed at Ginny making her catch it and laugh before chasing Ron into the snow. The siblings ran off while Harry stayed behind watching Ginny. He wanted to get her something nice and her good mood put him in a good mood. </span></p>
