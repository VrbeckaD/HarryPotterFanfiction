    <p>Harry was bored back at the Dursleys. Of course, they'd tried snatching his things away from him as soon as he got home but Harry was getting older and bigger now and so the threats came easier.</p><p>He whipped out his wand and shoved it underneath Uncle Vernon's throat, telling him to leave him alone or he'd curse him. When he asked what that was, Harry laughed and said he'd gladly show him. Aunt Petunia interfered, obviously having known what it must be from hearing about it from her sister when they were younger.</p><p>She still gave him a look of disbelief, as if not understanding what was going through his head to make him say such a threat like that. He just shrugged at her with a smile and took his stuff to his room, ignoring her worried look.</p><p>He was still feeling completely bitter with Ron. Actually, no. For the time being, he refuses to call him by his name. Right now, he's just Weasley. He's bitter with <i>Weasley</i> for how he treated him not only in the tower by calling him a traitor, but in the compartment on the train. Friends don't do that.</p><p>At first, Harry felt a little bit bad about spitting in his face, he felt like that was a low blow, but after going over the situation several times and not even getting a letter to apologise... Or even just to ask if he's alright?</p><p>Unacceptable behaviour. He scowled when he thought about him, mentally reprimanding himself for it. Until he gets what he deserves, which is an apology, he refuses to think about him.</p><p>He's sitting in bed late at night and reading over a book that deals with witch burning. He'd seen Aunt Petunia leave a book out about this a couple of years ago, but it was a silly muggle version for comedic reasons. This is the real deal.</p><p>He laughs down at the contents. There was some witch that loved being burned alive and the morbid thought stuck with him. Even though she used magic to put it out, the thought of some wicked witch or wizard that peeved him off just getting stuck to a stake and lit up in bright flames seemed oddly appealing. </p><p>Even the thought of doing it to a muggle, perhaps the one's downstairs. He wouldn't miss the Dursleys at all. He could easily make it look like an accidental fire from the stove or oven being left on. </p><p>He was pulled out of his musings by hissing.</p><p><b>"Youngling, you have mail! Look, the fat bird is holding something for you. Grab it before I eat it,"</b> Nessie told him.</p><p>Harry looked at the owl who was cooing on his windowsill and holding a package. He took it from the bird and it flew away. He distinctly recognised the grey bird as Severus's.</p><p>He opened up the package and inside were three of his disgusting vials, of course. </p><p>"Great," he sighed to himself. "I completely forgot." Honestly, if it weren't for Severus, he'd be a wreck and most likely, several people would either be injured or even dead.</p><p>
  <b>"What is it? Is that your funky juice?"</b>
</p><p>Harry smiled and nodded. <b>"Yeah, girl. It's the stuff that stops me from going nuts,"</b> he sighed.</p><p><b>"What's wrong with going nuts? Being a normal person is so boring. Be as crazy as you want, youngling,"</b> she advised him.</p><p>Harry stroked her scales and cuddled into her. She always offered the best of advice, even better than humans. <b>"Thanks, Ness."</b></p><p>He decided to be tough and just chugged a vial of the potion back with a cringe, tongue sticking out and letting out a disgusting "blaaahhh!" to himself.</p><p><b>"So overdramatic..."</b> Nessie hissed and Harry scoffed at her. The audacity!</p><p>He lets her wrap herself snugly around him whilst making sure the door to his room is locked. The very last thing he wants is for the Dursleys to come in and see Nessie. They'd try to kill her and that wouldn't end well for anyone. It'd be a bloodbath.</p><p>He falls asleep eventually, listening to her gentle hisses which always sooth him. He may not have a human mother, but Nessie is the second closest thing he has to one, just in animal form, no matter how weird that may seem to people. It's their dynamic, it's perfect.</p><p>Â </p><p>The next day when the Dursleys are getting under Harry's skin and he's so close to actually using some form of curse on Dudley, which he should be thankful he isn't, he decides to get out the house, much to everyone's relief. </p><p>He has money in both muggle and magical form stored away deep in his trunk, grabs some Galleons as he wants to explore some Wizarding stuff that he perhaps can take back to school, walks out on the streets and holds out his wand for the transportation he knows exists. The Knights Bus arrives almost instantly and he nods to Stan who grins at him.</p><p>"Ey, look who it is! It's Evan. Have you gotten taller?" he laughed.</p><p>Harry smiled awkwardly, remembering the fake name he gave last time. "Just a tad."</p><p>"Same place as usual, I take it?" Stan asks.</p><p>"Yeah, thanks," Harry nods, meaning the Leaky Cauldron.</p><p>The bus then takes off at full speed and Harry clutches at his stomach just like last time, refusing the hot chocolate he was offered.</p><p>"I still can't get used to this..." he mumbled, feeling sick.</p><p><b>"I can <i>totally</i> get used to it!"</b> Nessie spoke up cheerfully, clearly enjoying the ride. She's mental, Harry was thinking. How she was enjoying this, he would never know.</p><p>Eventually, they reached their destination and Harry just threw the money at Stan and jumped off the bus so he could get to the Leaky Cauldron and through the wall which led him into Diagon Alley. He'd memorised the way you tap your wand against the wall to get in but he never told anyone that, of course. </p><p>He had decided to wear long black robes today and pulled his hair across his face, then his hood up over his head. He was a spooky sight to see, but otherwise he was the kind of figure you wouldn't want to approach in the streets. </p><p>Perhaps people should start taking notes as to why he dressed this way then. It's not exactly a fashion accessory. He really does just want to blend in with the shadows and crowd.</p><p>He takes in a deep breath and heads in the direction he's most familiar with, making sure his face is covered and wand is ready to be drawn from his arm holster at any moment. He walks confidently into Knockturn Alley and turns into a small bookshop that he's heard some people in the common room recently talk about, unaware that he's been listening in. Honestly, they should be more aware of their surroundings. </p><p>Although, it does help that he has super sensitive hearing because of his lycanthropy.</p><p>The bookstore is like the dark, dusty and rundown version of Flourish and Blotts, if he's being honest. But he knows there will be books here that will suit his appreciation much more. </p><p>He doesn't exactly know what he's looking for, only that he wanted to come check the place out and see what was good. Nobody else is here so he looks randomly around shelves and alleys for about five minutes before his eyes are drawn to something interesting. It's a big, black book and hardly looks touched, therefore has a thick layer of dust on the top of it.</p><p>He brushes it off with his sleeve and frowns down at the title. <i>Understanding Death, Himself. What Lies In The Beyond?</i></p><p>What a strange title, he's wondering. There comes a chuckle from the doorway behind the counter and an old man appears. He must be the shopkeeper.</p><p>"I see you've finally decided."</p><p>"I guess," Harry shrugs. "What is it? Why has nobody touched it? Because it looks brand new compared to the others," he told the man, thrusting the book out.</p><p>The man takes in a deep breath and nodded. "Quite right you are. It is untouched, and for a very good reason," he says hushed.</p><p>Harry leans forward over the counter to hear him better. "What's the reason?" He was getting quite intrigued by now.</p><p>The man whispers with a grin, as if he was about to share the world's best secret. </p><p>"They say that whoever is in possession personally with this book, whoever purchases it and reads it... They will face Death, himself. And soon," he shuddered.</p><p>"Death, himself?" he raises an eyebrow. "What does that mean? Is this a metaphor for something? Surely, death can't actually be a real person," he said sceptically. The man just stared at him. "Oh, come on! Once you die, you die! That's life and death. That's all there is to it. There is no Death, that you speak of," he rolled his eyes.</p><p>The man grinned at him and linked his fingers. "Buy the book and read it yourself, then."</p><p>"What?" Harry asked in shock.</p><p>"If you're so sure..." the man smiled deviously. "Purchase the book for yourself, and let's see whether or not you have your brush with Death."</p><p>"Nice way of trying to make a sale, by intimidating your customers," Harry sneered.</p><p>"Not intimidating if you're hardly believing anything I'm saying," the man shrugged. "Merely persuading."</p><p>Harry sighed and looked down at the book. He hadn't yet opened the pages but it was calling out to him to do so. </p><p><i>'I don't care how mental this guy is. I want to find out what is in this book! He's a fraud, anyway. Just like all those other Seers you hear about,'</i> he thought bitterly.</p><p>"How much?" he asked, reaching into his pocket and pulling out his money pouch.</p><p>The man gaped at him, as if wondering if he was the one who was mental. "Uh... That'll be thirty Galleons," he said, then he smiled. "But since you're going to die soon, I'll give it to you for free. A departing gift, if you will."</p><p>Harry glared at him at scoffed, putting his money away and shrinking the book, shoving it in his pocket and leaving, after the shopkeeper offered him a sad "goodbye".</p><p>He continued walking out the Alley with his hood up, seeing a suspicious looking goblin standing around and snarling at some people whilst holding some pieces of parchment. He looked over in Harry's direction and called out.</p><p>"Oi, you interested?"</p><p>Harry slowly walked towards the tiny thing and shrugged. "Depends on what is is."</p><p>The goblin huffed at him. "You like money?"</p><p>Harry laughed. "Of course I do, who doesn't?"</p><p>"Exactly what I wanted to hear," it gave a nasty grin. "What would you say if I told you I could help you make money?"</p><p>"I'd say, tell me more."</p><p>"Come with me," the goblin led him into a small shop and shut the blinds, locking the door behind them. Harry sat down in a chair opposite him. "How old are you?"</p><p>"Twelve," Harry said, deciding it's best not to lie if this goblin can help him make some extra cash.</p><p>"I take it you still get allowance from your parents?"</p><p>"My parents are dead," Harry shrugged.</p><p>The goblin stared at him before humming. "Who gives you money?"</p><p>"I have a vault that they left me before their passing."</p><p>"But, soon enough that will run out," the goblin said.</p><p>Harry nodded. "I suppose."</p><p>"Good idea that you came to me then," it smiled. "We often use... Questionable methods of getting people money, but it works all the same. In turn, by making you money, I make money. Good, huh?" it grinned.</p><p>Harry gaped. "Hold on, is this some shady black market business?" He honestly never would have expected this from a goblin, of all creatures.</p><p>"Well, you are in Knockturn Alley," it raised a bushy eyebrow.</p><p>Harry supposed that was fair, but still... "Alright, point taken. It's just, you're a goblin!"</p><p>"Yes?"</p><p>"Shouldn't you be in Grin-"</p><p>"Gringotts?" it asked with a frown. "You would think. But, after I expressed my opinion that we should be more generous with our vaults and give some to other magical beings, they kicked me out and here I am," it scowled.</p><p>"Why would a goblin kick one of it's own kind out? Especially if you're defending magical beings?"</p><p>"They have a hard enough time dealing with witches and wizards. If the news were to spread around that Gringotts were open to vampires or werewolves, they fear their reputation would be over."</p><p>"But that's hardly true!" Harry said exasperatedly. He's suddenly glad the news of him being a werewolf had never gotten out. He just wondered how Silas coped. This is probably how he makes his money, now that he thinks about it, and that's why he lives in Knockturn. "First of all, it's completely hypocritical. And secondly, it would make people like goblins more, as they'd seem more accepting."</p><p>The goblin nodded in agreement. </p><p>"Well, we've wasted enough time. Let's get down to business, shall we?" </p><p>"Okay. What do you need from me? You said questionable things, what does that entail?" Harry asked with narrowed eyes.</p><p>"Well, it's all different kinds of things. Sometimes, a wizard will come in with a supply of Acromantula venom. Sometimes, someone will bring in some unicorn blood. There's a hag who might brew some nasty potion. A vampire who might come in with a heavy supply of blood. A werewolf with some fur or claws, you'd be surprised by how sharp they are," he said with wide eyes. </p><p>Harry wasn't surprised at all, however. He owned them.</p><p>"So, do you have anything useful? Can you make any poisons? Do you have any weird body parts you could give us? Any dangerous artifacts?" the goblin asked.</p><p>The thing is, Harry had all those things but he didn't want to give up that private information. He did, however, have something useful he could use to his advantage. He'd been wondering what he could do with it, since it would just rot away eventually. Plus, the fang really is deadly and could come in useful.</p><p>"I can supply you with Basilisk parts," he said bluntly.</p><p>The goblin blinked at him. "What parts?"</p><p>Harry sighed. "There was a giant Basilisk in my school last year, going around and Petrifying people. A girl even died. I saw it first hand and it was massive, but the thing eventually died. It's body is still buried deep within the chambers of the school and nobody knows," he smirked. "I can easily go down there and start collecting the pieces in jars and bring them to you."</p><p>"What kind of pieces?" the goblin asked in wonder.</p><p>"Well, the eyes will be a little messed up and bloody, but there, all the same. I can give you the skin, it's so tough. And my personal favourite," he grinned. "The fangs. I've already kept one at home and I've used them in potions before, when nobody was around, of course. Trust me, it's toxic."</p><p>"Marvellous!" the goblin laughed. "Although, you'd be at school. How would you get them to us?"</p><p>Harry sighed. He forgot. "Um."</p><p>"You could always have someone deliver it to us, by proxy," the goblin shrugged. "We make arrangements like this all the time for people who wish to be more discreet."</p><p>"I'll give that a think, then," he nodded. There may be one person in particular he has in mind, if only he'd agree. He doesn't want to take advantage of Silas, he's his mentor, a friend. But he's a really quick and cunning vampire. He'd be the best help he could have. Plus, he'd gladly give him some profit.</p><p>But, that's a thought for later.</p><p>"You can have time to think about it. Right now, just sign your name on this piece of parchment," the goblin said, finally handing over the sheet he has been holding this entire time. Harry signed his name on a contract with a quill and instantly the ink just vanished. He gaped. "It is a magically binding contract, stating that anything I've discussed with you today, I cannot share, such as your identity and the Basilisk parts."</p><p>Harry felt relieved at that. "And on my part?"</p><p>"You can tell who you wish, so long as you know they're trust worthy. But, you cannot give up <i>my</i> identity and the secrets I've told you," he said firmly. Harry nodded, he supposed that was fair. </p><p>He grinned. "We don't even know each other's identities properly, though. Do we?"</p><p>The goblin grinned. "How rude. My name is Ragnok."</p><p>Harry stood up and bowed down to him politely. "Harry Potter."</p><p>Ragnok gasped and Harry snorted, heading for the door. </p><p>"I'll hopefully see you again, soon!" he called out as he left the store.</p><p>"Of course, Mr Potter," Ragnok's voice spoke up before the door shut.</p><p>Harry usually didn't like telling people his identity and if they did find out, he definitely didn't like making a big deal about it, but he needed to stay on Ragnok's good side. They can be pretty vicious little things.</p><p>He'd been out for a couple of hours now and really wanted to get into that book already. He felt the tugging in his head, like there was a distant voice yelling <i>read me read me read me!</i></p><p>He left back the way he came and thought about simply taking the train back to Surrey, but Nessie had woken from her long nap underneath his robes and demanded that he take her on that fun bus ride again. He couldn't say no to her, not after everything she'd done for him as a protector. She deserves the little joys in life.</p><p>He called the wretched Knight Bus back and they were on their way back to Surrey. Harry was, yet again, jumping off it as quickly as he could when they were back at the Dursleys and chuckling at Nessie's whines.</p><p><b>"We'll go on it again, okay? When I'm feeling better, I'll take you,"</b> he promised regretfully. </p><p><b>"I knew I liked you since the beginning, youngling,"</b> she hissed back in contentment and snuggled back into his robes to fall asleep again.</p><p>He ignored Dudley's irritating voice as he walked back inside the house, running upstairs and slamming the door to his bedroom, right in his cousin's face.</p><p>"Open the door, freak! Where have you been?" he yelled through the door.</p><p>"Aw, were you worried for me, Dudley? That's so nice," Harry taunted back. He let down Nessie and told her to stay put on his bed, hidden. He didn't want Dudley seeing her, at least not now.</p><p>He heard a scoff. "You wish! I was just wondering who was going to make me lunch."</p><p>"How about you get your mummy to do it for you? Since you're her baby and everything," Harry grinned.</p><p>Dudley kicked the door. "She's away out shopping, so it's just the two of us," Dudley's voice turned cheeky, as if he were planning something. He probably wanted to wind Harry up or something.</p><p>Harry sighed and finally opened the door, facing him. </p><p>"I guess so, Dudley," he smiled innocently. "That means anything could happen."</p><p>Dudley narrowed his eyes at him, wondering what he was talking about. Harry thought it was amusing how this lump of a boy thought he could scare him. He's practically the muggle version of Malfoy. Arrogant, spoiled, bratty. And means absolutely nothing to him.</p><p>"Go make me a sandwich," Dudley said.</p><p>"I don't think so. Go make it yourself, I'm busy," Harry said, crossing his arms defiantly. </p><p>"Busy doing what? You've got no friends to talk to!" he snapped. </p><p>"Let me put it this way, Dudley. If you want me to make you a sandwich right now, I will." Dudley grinned triumphantly but Harry continued on with a flat voice, uncaring. "But, just know. I will put a lethal amount of poison in it," he grinned. "I'm not even kidding."</p><p>Dudley stepped back. "You wouldn't dare!"</p><p>"Go on, try me. See what happens," Harry challenged. Did Dudley seriously think he would joke about this? He's tempted to show him the small vial of Basilisk venom he has left in his trunk right now, but he wouldn't know what it is. </p><p>It's also tempting to tell him that he literally poisoned his teacher to death with the very poison in his bedroom right now, but the swine would have him arrested.</p><p>Dudley didn't like being challenged so he growled at Harry and lashed out at him, leaning forward to grab the front of his robes. Harry just quickly jumped back and with impressive reflexes and speed, he slammed the door shut right on Dudley's hand where it was halfway through the doorway and he screamed as it locked in place, with no chance of him escaping. </p><p>He laughed at him and shook his head at the pathetic display. </p><p>"Help! Please! Muuummmy!" he called out for his mother like the child he is. </p><p>Harry rolled his eyes and unlatched the door, letting Dudley fall back flat on his arse and cringed at the blood streaming down his hands. His fingers looked broken and he was sobbing hysterically. </p><p>"Can't you take a hit, kid? Grow a pair!" Harry snapped.</p><p>"Y-you t-tried to k-kill m-me!" he blubbered. Oh great, he sounds like Quirrell. Maybe he can die painfully, too. </p><p>"Believe me, Dudley. If I tried to kill you, you'd know. Alright?" he glared.</p><p>Dudley sniffed and nodded timidly then got up off the floor, running away to his own room on shaky legs and slamming the door behind him, locking it.</p><p>Harry slammed his own door and turned back to Nessie who was praising him. </p><p><b>"Well done, youngling. Although, you should have let me bite him. Or made him that sandwich,"</b> she said.</p><p>He nodded to her in consideration. </p><p><b>"Do you know what, Ness? I think you're <i>absolutely</i> right,"</b> he grinned. Maybe his hand might just slip over the holidays...</p><p><b>"Of course I am.  I'm a snake, I'm superior,"</b> she hissed cockily, making him laugh.</p><p>Â </p><p>Harry lays awake in the middle of the night, the only sound being the sound of Nessie breathing next to him and the turning of the pages.</p><p>He had finally gotten into his book, <i>Understanding Death, Himself. What Lies In The Beyond?</i></p><p>He was in the middle of yet another moon episode and his muscles ached all over, but after years of taking the Wolfsbane Potion, it had certainly done a fantastic job of easing the monthly pains. He remembers just two years ago, he'd be screaming bloody murder and wishing for death. Even just one year ago! How horrid of a life it was. He still hates this, but he knows it can only get better form now on. At least he hopes...</p><p>Tomorrow, he'll find out for sure. And he has Nessie with him for support. That's all that matters right now.</p><p>He buries his head in the book and pushes away any lingering paranoid thoughts that man in the bookstore put into his head about death being a person. Death is a state of being, or technically not being. As in, not living. It's not some living consciousness. That's purely hypocritical, is it not? For something that's supposed to signify death, it's now showing signs of being alive? That isn't possible. </p><p>He refuses to refer to "death" as Death, himself. What a silly title for the gullible.</p><p>He scoffs at the whole idea and continues reading.</p><p>
  <i>Many believe that once you pass on from life, that is all there is to it. Nothing more than an empty and lifeless shell that has fulfilled it's timeline and purposes in this world</i>
</p><p>
  <i>This, in a sense, is true. Your body is nothing more than the hollow version you once were, no longer with a conscious to talk to. It can be a very heartbreaking experience for most people, especially if they're not ready to say goodbye to the one's they're losing, or if they are the one's who are passing and haven't come to terms with it</i>
</p><p>
  <i>It is perfectly understandable, as it is going into the unknown. We hardly know anything about what lies after we die. We all die in the end, nobody is immortal, no matter how much we try to be. But, when we go, can we tell what the experience was like?</i>
</p><p>
  <i>Some muggles like to believe so. They call it reincarnation, believing that they had a past life and can recall how they died during it. Or they have techniques called resuscitation, where they are brought back to life by doctors, the muggle version of Healers, when they have been on the brink of their death. They also talk about their experiences they may have endured and remembered</i>
</p><p>
  <i>Who knows if it is true or not? It may be their brains playing games with them as a coping mechanism due to trauma. Or perhaps, it could be real. The thing is, maybe we'll never truly know</i>
</p><p>
  <i>But, what if there is something else entirely? What if this is something that doesn't involve muggles and their beliefs, and magicals with their fears and curiosity?</i>
</p><p>
  <i>There have been many sceptics who believe death is less of a state of the un-living and more of a sentient being. They call him Death, himself</i>
</p><p>
  <i>People have strong beliefs that when you pass, you may have a greeting with Death and if you're worthy, he'll welcome you into, what some people may believe to be, the Afterlife</i>
</p><p>
  <i>The Afterlife is believed to be a place where witches and wizards go after they pass and their souls will roam forevermore, if Death allows it. It is believed to be a place of peace and calm, where there will no longer be any troubles or worries</i>
</p><p>
  <i>Therefore, people say you don't have to fear death. But do they mean the state of being, or Death, himself?</i>
</p><p>
  <i>Some people don't believe this, however. They believe it to just be a story, due to the sheer irony behind it. They say that something that is supposed to signify passing on, and allow the same with others, could not possibly have the form of something still roaming around</i>
</p><p>
  <i>Although, many people who have come into contact with Death's Book, or what is also known as 'Understanding Death, Himself. What Lies In The Beyond?' have found themselves mysteriously losing their lives no more than a year later</i>
</p><p>
  <i>Some people believe this a coincidence, other's believe the book is tainted and cursed by Death himself, so they can join him in the Afterlife, as to prove he is a real existence</i>
</p><p>
  <i>There have been only a tiny handful of people who have claimed they have actually seen Death, himself, and therefore that is how people have gotten enough information over the years to write about Death's Book. These people who made these claims, however, began to lose their minds and change. Who were once kind people, began to morph into callous people who nobody would recognise anymore</i>
</p><p>
  <i>It was said that if you came back from death, after seeing Death, himself, you were changed, most likely not for the better, as you weren't supposed to move on from death</i>
</p><p>
  <i>Some people believe if you are worthy enough after you die, Death would look for your soul and try to give it back to you so you could come back into existence. Others believe he may feed a part of his soul to you, again only if you are worthy</i>
</p><p>
  <i>A few believe if he did decide to let you come back, you'd be in his debt and have to do some of his bidding, therefore that's why people lost their minds and changed</i>
</p><p>
  <i>It is wildly and strongly theorised that Death takes you by claiming people's souls, and as said before, if you trick him or persuade him strongly into letting you go free, your soul will be changed, which affects the mind</i>
</p><p>
  <i>These people claim that the only way they came back to life after seeing Death, was if their dying experience was horrific and involved having a terrible encounter with magical beings who had the ability to take a person's soul themselves, such as Dementors</i>
</p><p>
  <i>The Dementors would strip their souls bare and Death would have total control to do what he'd liked from there</i>
</p><p>Harry gaped down at the book. That was a lot of information to take in and certinally a whole lot more complicated.</p><p>So, this is Death's Book, as he realises it's officially called. </p><p>He now feels just a teensy bit of anxiety holding on to it considering what he just read. It was talking about owners having not lived longer than a year. And the man at the bookstore said the same. He knows there's the old saying that you don't believe everything you hear or read in a book, but he couldn't help his stomach from churning and he knew it wasn't from his monthly episodes.</p><p>He gulped and got up, locking away the book deep within his school trunk even though that would do absolutely no good. He was still the owner of it. Plus, if he got rid of it, it wouldn't matter. He's already read it, the damage is now done. If this book really is cursed by, dare he say Death, then he's just cursed himself by reading his and his victim's secrets.</p><p>He scolds himself for being paranoid. This is exactly the kind of thing the didn't want to happen. Now, he'll never sleep.</p><p>He sighs and tugs at his hair roughly in frustration, wondering what to do. He needs a distraction until he feels tired enough to sleep. He won't wake Nessie, he's not mean. And Hedwig is off flying somewhere, most likely looking for mice, as she likes doing that at night.</p><p>He casts a Silencing Charm on his room and decides to start practising magic until he feels tired. It's not like he'll get in trouble, anyway, since the Trace is removed.</p><p>He conjures a rat and practises the Imperius Curse, just like he did with Weasley in the chamber. He makes it float out the window much to his amusement and then drown itself in his glass of water. He thinks of Summoning the stupid rat Scabbers here and doing the same but Weasley would freak out and he can't deal with some stupid letter here with accusations or something, even if they're true.</p><p>He still refuses to call his "friend" Ron until he bucks up and apologises to him for being awful and treating him like dirt. For now, he can live without him.</p><p>Eventually, he begins to get tired and Banishes the drowned and dead rat away somewhere else, getting back into bed and falling asleep.</p><p>Â </p><p>It was the next day and that of course meant the final day of the cycle, thank goodness. All he had to do was get through this and he'd be fine. </p><p>It was also his birthday and, as always, the Dursleys paid no attention to him. It used to bother him a little because he felt unwanted, but now he hardly gave a damn because he had people who cared to an extent back at school and they were the people he could surround himself with and not want to rip their faces off.</p><p>He'd gotten a letter from the Weasley twins, surprisingly, and it wished him a happy birthday. It also came with a picture of them all standing together, minus Ginny, attempting a smile as they wore ridiculous clothing. Apparently they'd won some money and were going to Egypt, Harry had barely gotten through the letter due to the messy handwriting. He noticed Ron looking quite grumpy in the picture, with his silly rat on his shoulder.</p><p>There was a message from the twins on the parchment. It read,</p><p>
  <i>Harry, we know we haven't been close recently and we're sorry. It's just that Ron is really upset and as our brother we have to put him first, you know? - Fred</i>
</p><p>
  <i>After everything that went down in the chamber, he feels more sad than the rest of us, I think... Because he was there and couldn't do anything about it - George</i>
</p><p>
  <i>Yeah! And then you leaving Gryffindor tower? It pushed him over the edge and he freaked out then said those nasty things - Fred</i>
</p><p>
  <i>Which we're sure he didn't mean. He'll come around, you'll see - George</i>
</p><p>Harry scoffed and scrunched up the letter, throwing it in the bin. Did they seriously think this was acceptable? He doesn't care about what the twins think, he cares about what Ron thinks and the fact that he's using his own brothers as a scapegoat for his guilt or regret is pathetic. Harry is livid!</p><p>He's expecting an apology letter or an explanation from Ron, himself. Not from the twins to do it for him. How childish and... And cowardly.</p><p>Some Gryffindor he is.</p><p>He spends the rest of the day in isolation with just Nessie for company, munching on raw steaks he's snatched from the freezer without Aunt Petunia catching him, reading over some books he has and completing some summer homework he remembers to do.</p><p>He groans the night away as his personal hell comes, and tears his hair out, glad for his dragonhide gloves otherwise he'd have torn his own eyes out.</p><p>What a pitiful birthday.</p>
