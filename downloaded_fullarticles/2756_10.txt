    <p>Remus Lupin always knew it would end this way. </p><p>In his bones, he knew it. He and Sirius Black were much too much. Too much of everything.</p><p>Too many arguments, too many half-hearted apologies just so things could go back to how they were after boyhood arguments and raw nerves, too many feelings, too many gasped declarations of just what they meant to each other under Gryffindor curtains, too many words left unsaid after twelve damn years.</p><p>Too many mistakes over the, <em>Merlin</em>, two decades of being so damn entwined it was hard to tell where one stopped and the other started, too much to overcome after all the hurt, too much Sirius, too much Remus.</p><p>Too much love, so much it spilled over, so much that it was felt when you walked into the room they were in, curled in the same armchair in front of the fire, scarred fingers weaving their way through masses of inky hair as if they could be anywhere else. So much love that you couldn’t do anything but notice the way their eyes seemed to perpetually meet across the room if there was but an inch of space between them - the constant glances in classrooms, at Christmas parties, at Order meetings, at moments where it all felt impossible but yet here they were. So much love that it was too much. </p><p>As if they could barely handle how much the other boy gave to them, but lapped it up all the same. The pair were only too aware that far too much of them resided within the other. Remus knew nearly all of him lived with Sirius, and the raven-haired boy knew the majority of his being lived with his Moony. Even before their relationship became anything close to romantic, Remus knew he belonged with the other boy. He knew it from the moment their eyes first met, to some extent, in his veins as sure as he knew the pull of the moon. Although, Remus couldn’t describe their relationships as romantic - the word didn’t seem enough, nothing seemed enough. It was all encompassing. Every moment of Remus’ life was touched by Sirius Black.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>They were two trees whose roots had grown together over time. Through the glory and safety of Hogwarts, the quiet terror of their little flat, then the gradual yawning spaces of pain between them, it was like they had truly forgotten to breathe without the scent of the other in the air. As boys, their insides were already so full and yet broken at the same time, but they could always find what they needed in each other. Never what they wanted. But always, what they needed. Kicking and screaming, shouting they couldn’t do this anymore in the middle of the night, when one of them stumbled home and there was so much pain and mistrust in grey and amber eyes, so much terror of <em>Merlin, how can I carry on when all I need is you but I can’t have you, not like I want, not like I need, I can’t - Merlin burning, I can’t trust you.</em> They couldn’t do this, there was too much, they couldn’t do it, not to each other, not to themselves. But they always needed. And so they were, despite the pain and the terror there was always Remus-and-Sirius, always what they needed in each other.</p><p>Remus always tried to keep to himself, but he found that, despite what he wanted, he was always drawn to Sirius Black. From the first moment they met eyes on the train, Remus was captivated. That wave of inky black hair, the careless way he threw it back from his eyes, the way he carried himself in those utterly unflattering Hogwarts robes. Remus found himself smiling behind the safety of his book, despite it all. The feeling only grew as Sirius, James and Peter stood by him in second year. They had found out about his lycanthropy, Remus’ biggest fear, gathered in the dorm room, James worried but steadfast behind his glasses, Peter stood a half pace behind, unsure as always, and Sirius, oh Sirius, reclined on the bed as if he hadn’t just upended everything Remus knew. He was so prepared to just pack up his things, always trying to be as little of a bother as possible, and throw himself off the Astronomy Tower. But Sirius had laughed, in that way he always did, slung his arm around Remus’ shoulder, and said “We’re Marauders, mate, you’re not going anywhere.” He remembered crying with relief, a sob dropped onto Sirius’ shoulder even as the raven-haired boy shot James a bewildered look.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The other predominantly Sirius feeling came shortly after that, after looking over in Transfiguration and looking at the way Sirius chewed idly on the end of his quill, Remus realised he was in love with Sirius. It felt like nothing and everything had changed all at once, but it all settled with gentle kisses that soon exploded into a need that ravaged Remus, he needed to be with Sirius, near Sirius, always. School was a whirlwind after that, a torrent of emotion that Remus tamped down hard on, his biting need to be always with Sirius, to merge his being with the other boy, so desperate for whatever Sirius could give him. Nothing in Remus’ life felt easy except Sirius. There was always unflinching connection between them, as steadfast as James, as loyal as Peter, as clever as Remus, as brash as Sirius. He yearned like he never had before, he wanted and needed and <em>got</em>. It was perfect, the rush of love he felt for Sirius.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>They moved into a flat at the edge of London after Hogwarts, with Alphard’s inheritance and a childlike excitement for life. James moved out and married Lily, Peter got himself a ministry job and Remus-and-Sirius remained. Steadfast, loyal, clever, and brash. Until it all started to fall apart. But even then, through the terror and the mistrust and Merlin, so many tears, Remus still <em>needed</em>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The need didn’t go away on October 31<sup>st</sup> 1981. As much as Remus wished it was gone, it stayed. The gnawing emptiness inside him that still needed Sirius, he still knew his other half resided with him, in Azkaban, with shrieking madness and laughter. He felt it. Sometimes he thought it was the grief, late at night in that forsaken flat that made him want to scream and laugh, but he knew it was Sirius. He felt the raven-haired boy - or was he a man now? - the same way he always did. It was their link, the animal part of their brains that knew they weren’t whole without each other. The part of Remus that sunk his teeth into Sirius’ shoulder one morning over Christmas break in fifth year as he shuddered with pleasure, and Sirius had sighed as he collapsed into the pillows, the feeling of how much Remus loved him coursing through his body making the tears spring to his eyes. It had always been near telepathic, the uncanny ability to feel exactly what the other was feeling.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> Research didn't help, it was presumed to be something wolfish springing from Remus' blood, the fierce pull for a mate. But they never looked into it, it never seemed important, it was just another part of Remus-and-Sirius.</span></p><p>It made it worse. Remus felt the clenching distrust in Sirius’ gut when Remus finally appeared home, two weeks after schedule looking as if he had gone three full moon’s in a row. He felt the burst of love in Sirius’ chest that he tried so hard to push down because he wasn’t quite sure how he could still love someone he didn’t trust to sleep next to. So he still felt it, years later separated by the North Sea and the walls of Azkaban, the madness clawing at Sirius’ veins like it was the phantom pain of a lost limb. He wept and tried not to think about the fact Sirius would feel the tears like they were burning his own eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Even as Remus felt the elation of seeing Sirius before him, free from Azkaban after all those years, a small, wry smile on his face just a shadow of his previous brilliance, he knew how it would end. Even as Remus embraced his former lover, his other half, his beautiful, beautiful Padfoot, and felt his too-skinny arms wind around him, he knew. Somewhere between the bones and marrow and wolfish blood coursing his body, Remus knew how it would end. Even if he hadn’t foreseen this outcome, the sting of knowing he was wrong after twelve years, wondering how exactly he could’ve ignored the punch to his gut every time he thought Sirius had betrayed his best friends and not marched to Albus’ door and screamed until he was hoarse. But it was done, Remus only ever thought about endings anyway, and the past was behind them. Sirius was back, and the screaming madness in both their veins seemed to abate.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Even as they tried to fall back into old ways a year later, curled around each other in bed on a Sunday morning, listening to the Order come and go below in Grimmauld Place, Remus knew this wasn’t the end. It hadn’t taken them long to unearth the buried connection between them, the searing wanting <em>need</em> between them even after a decade. Turns out the soul was hard to ignore, no matter how stubborn Remus was, and he knew Sirius was even worse. He tried to focus on the fleeting moments of happiness of Sirius grinning as he heard Bowie for the first time in twelve years, the sheer relief of a hot shower, the beautiful way Remus could unravel and put him back together in bed at night, as if no time had passed at all, and despite the distance they were still boys at Hogwarts discovering their bodies to a soundtrack of Queen and rasping moans. But he was thinking of endings. They were always meant to be a tragic love story, Moony and his Padfoot, he knew this wasn’t the end. Not yet.</p><p>When Remus heard the crackling laughter of Bellatrix Lestrange, and felt more than saw the curse hit Sirius’ square in the chest, that’s when it dawned on Remus. When those stormy grey eyes flickered over the room, instinctively searching, they found Harry, <em>Prongslet</em>, who was always his first instinct to protect. Then they found Remus, in the second between falling and disappearing, he saw his Moony, the one he always looked to for protection, the one he always needed, no matter what. A moment of peace crossed his face through the terror, that beautiful face, even despite it all, despite the chasm between them for years, the misunderstandings, the fighting, the screaming, the <em>pain</em>. Despite it all, Sirius looked to Remus for what he needed, and found in there in his last moment. The peace in Sirius’ heart ricocheted through Remus like a cannonball, so aware of how wrong it felt when braced against the scream in his throat and the tearing of fresh disbelief. It had taken every ounce of Remus’ strength not to tumble through the veil after his other half, the gnawing emptiness of his soul so glaringly obvious now. He knew then, it was the beginning of the end. But there would be no release then.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>In the 12 years Sirius was in Azkaban, Remus did nothing but feel. Endless, painful swathes of feeling that kept coming and coming until he felt like he was drowning in it all. He never knew how he managed to keep his head above water, but he did, somehow. After Sirius fell through the veil, all feeling stopped. Everything was numb, as if the water he tried so hard not to drown in before was seeping into his very being. Somehow, the lack of Sirius was even more painful than their separation. Moony howled, every day of the lunar cycle, even when he was meant to get a break, when the night sky was dark, Moony howled and keened and the emptiness of it wouldn’t stop. He kept his head down, he was there for nothing but Harry. He was the only Marauder left, and he had to stand by the Prongslet - and Godric that name still hurt - until he could do nothing but stand until he couldn’t, so painfully aware of the ending.</p><p>The battle loomed on the horizon for most, but Remus wasn’t feeling. He was thinking of endings, he found himself in the thick of it, throwing curses with reckless abandon, nearly feeling James and Sirius at his shoulders, back to back, fighting like the brothers they were, so in tune with each other, moving like one, like the quiet voice of his animal instinct, the two best duellers he knew, and Merlin, it still hurt. It all still hurt. The shot of green light came at him quickly. But Remus was quicker. He turned, met the thing full on. He could nearly hear James roar behind him, firing off a counter curse, Sirius shoving at his shoulders. But they weren’t there. He was the last Marauder, the last bastion of it all, falling down around him. He told himself he could’ve thrown up a shield, cast a deflection, dove out of the way. If he were only a split second quicker, if he had James and Sirius at his shoulders, the best duellers he knew, moving as one. Of course he didn’t admit it, he didn’t want to think about how he could’ve postponed the ending just for a few more painful moments. He was thinking about endings. But he was bone-tired and Godric, everything still hurt. He was always thinking about endings. As he had been since the beginning, Remus was painfully aware of the end. The curse hit him square, and in that glorious moment, everything stopped hurting.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Then, he was stepping on the Hogwarts Express, sunlight filtering through the windows. He was on autopilot, stumbling through the carriages until he got to their compartment. Just like he did every September, the same compartment year after year, even the same compartment in 1993 when he woke with the acid of grief in his throat, staring at James and two best friends he didn’t recognise. Always the same compartment, back to his best friends, his other halves, his pack, year after year, even through all the pain and terror and hollowness of it all, the Hogwarts Express welcomed him home. The door slid open and there was James, all grins and a shock of messy hair, exactly how he was in the Summer of 1980, giddy with excitement at the world, worries so far away. He pulled Remus into a tight hug, until Lily shoved him aside and stood on her tiptoes to draw Remus against her. She was the same, endless happiness shining from her bright green eyes, so beautiful and like the sister he had been longing for for so long. His heart ached with belonging. He heard their words but they didn’t seem to matter. He’d been thinking so hard about endings, he didn’t think about what might be past them. Then Lily moved, stepping aside with a knowing smile on her pretty lips, and there was Sirius.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Sirius Black in all of his beauty, as old as when he’d seen him last, but without the ravages of Azkaban, the cruelty of time. His hair was as thick and luscious as it had been stepping from the shower in their flat, his eyes sparkled with the mirth and livelihood he remembered, and that Queen shirt hung just so from his bony shoulders, skimmed his stomach in just the way he remembered. He looked like mischief personified, so glorious and gorgeous and <em>here</em>. He looked like Remus was looking in a mirror and seeing all his missing pieces. His lips tasted like menthol cigarettes as he pulled Remus down for a light kiss, and Moony felt the half of his being become whole again. In that moment, the pain that had followed him for sixteen years, the uneasiness in his gut that had settled there since the first moment their lips met two decades ago, had gone. Sirius was pliant and beautiful, tangling his hands in auburn curls and murmuring some ridiculous quip, probably teasing his rusty duelling stance from the battle, something about refreshing his memory in a different kind of duelling. All the pain and horror and terror of it all washed away against Sirius’ body and Remus found himself clinging to the half of his whole he was so keenly aware of missing until now. He choked on the idea of feeling whole, it felt like too much, he was so used to being empty.</p><p>Remus Lupin always knew it would end this way. It was all too much, but all at once, it was exactly what he needed. Never what he wanted. But it all seemed to pale into insignificance. He was quite happy for the end to come.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
