    <p>The thick vapor filled her lungs bringing with it the knowledge that it certainly wasn’t good for her and that the manic hamster running circles through her mind would slow. One more hit on the little USB cancer stick and she would go back in. Just two more hours at Rick’s Diner running Coney dogs and praying for good tips and she would be done. She could do it. <br/>In her twenty-two years, Hermione Granger had learned a lot about sticking it through. Seven years of helping Harry dodge a madman had made her determined and the last five years since of the war had ended had just reinforced that. It hadn’t been easy, the endless funerals for friends that had become family had worn on her, her dead-end job at the ministry frustrated her. After that final day in May things were supposed to get better, magical Europe was supposed to be more accepting. Muggle-borns were supposed to be equal, sentient beings were going to finally get a say in the Ministry of Magic, she was the brightest witch of the age and she was the one who was going to write the legislation that was going to make it happen.<br/> But three months later people’s enthusiasm for equality was dried up. Sure, werewolves weren’t living in destitute packs anymore, but their children still couldn’t go to Hogwarts and what jobs they could get had shit pay. She had been laughed out of every meeting for even suggesting that house elves deserved a measly ten galleons a week. Hermione Granger was a failure at least in the ways that matter to her. <br/>However, it was Ron’s betrayal that drove her across the pond. She could still smell the cheap vanilla candle burning in her living room and see the overturned empty bottle of wine on her coffee table when she came home from yet another failed meeting this time pushing for programs to help muggle parents adjust to their little witches or wizard’s new world and caught them. The tall, slender nameless blonde groupie and her best friend, her fiancé, her Ron. <br/>The fight that followed echoed down the hallway of their apartment in upscale wizarding London as blondie scrambled for her clothes, if the scraps of material could even be called that. Merlin, they looked like something a Knockturn Alley whore would wear. <br/>Hermione exhaled sharply pushing the plume of smoke out of her lungs and watched it float into the misty December night in downtown Detroit shaking her head. It did no use to relieve that mess, it was thousands of miles away. That night she had thrown enough clothes for a weekend into her old beaded bag and flooed to Luna’s. Over the weeks following the final battle Luna’s oddities no longer endless irritated her but rather settled in a familiar peace that no matter what turmoil raged in the world stayed constant. <br/>What was supposed to be just few days turned into two weeks of refusing to venture out into the hornet swarm of reporters desperate to catch a glimpse of the distraught golden girl and the distinct feeling that although Luna was ever the perfect hostess albeit a bit absent minded, Hermione had over stayed her welcome. Gathering what was left of her meager savings account after purchasing what was supposed to be their starter home, one Ron had pushed for because he didn’t “have nice things” as a child even though it was over budget, Hermione had booked a flight for New York.<br/> After a few weeks staying at the Black Newt, New York’s equivalent of the Leaky Cauldron, and watching what little money she did have rapidly shrink she had seen a tourist wearing a Detroit Hustle’s Harder sweatshirt and decided what the hell, she knew next to nothing about that place except for its love of cars and that she was willing to hustle too. If nothing else the cost of living would be a touch better and again packed, her few possessions and apparated to Detroit only to sit in the same coffee shop each morning and nurse a cup of dreadful excuse for tea and watch time go by.<br/> In those hours spent sitting sipping she learned a lot, Detroit was no longer a dangerous pit of economic hardship; it was on the rebound and filled with people like her that wanted a fresh start. One of those people was Candice, she had a mess of black curls that rivaled her own and had moved there to escape her sleepy town and embrace her…free spirit.  Taking advantage of the county university’s low tuition was an added bonus. Luckily for Hermione, Candice desperately needed a new roommate to be able to afford to move out of her current place so that she would never have to speak to Bianca the bitch ever again and no longer had to put up with the constant judgement of Bianca’s prudish ways. Because apparently, even in 2018, the idea of a grown woman bettering herself off the dime men as an exotic dancer was simply too risqué. <br/>And that was how she ended up here, pushing the back door into the restaurant and hurrying past the shelves of cleaning supplies and other junk collected over the years, through the kitchen, and back into her own personal hell. Two more hours of half-drunk idiots begging for refills and extra ketchup and she would be home free and damn it if she didn’t have to fish her tip out of another upturned water glass left by another twenty something year old guy trying to be clever, she would call it a win. <br/>The next hour was mercifully short and the following a blur as she wiped tables, swept, mopped and helped prepare for the next morning’s breakfast rush in a haze. Well Candice loved shaking ass to a jumble of rap Hermione just couldn’t bring herself to join her even if she didn’t have a problem with it. Something about her parent’s disappointment in seeing their daughter crawl around the stage half naked for a few dollar bills stopped her, even if her parents were still happily running a flower shop in Australia blissfully unaware, they even had a daughter. <br/>The tinkling of the bell hung above the door interrupted her musings. Shit I must have forgotten to lock the front door again Hermione thought to herself cursing the possibility of having to argue with yet another party goer desperate for a late-night meal.<br/>“Sorry we’re clo—” Hermione started before she was interrupted.<br/>“Oh hush, it’s just me momma” Candice offered happily turning to flip the lock before skipping happily dated red tables in a way only she could at nearly three in the morning. <br/>“Sorry Candy, I didn’t even look up. Today’s been a long one. You know Rick has told you you can use the staff entrance. Just wasn’t expecting you to come through the front” Hermione offered. <br/>“Barf you know I hate walking past the dumpster, I have a very fine nose you know.” Candice replied tapping her nose for emphasis before pulling back her hood. <br/>“Yah yah, papa used to say you have a sense of smell stronger than a blood hound. I know” Hermione replied this time truly looking up from the piles of silverware she was sorting and seeing Candice for the first time all day.<br/>Gosh with make-up Candice looked even more like a doll. Unlike Hermione her messy curls fell into neat ringlets with just a touch of mousse even after being crushed into the hood of a winter jacket and the fake lashes only added to effect framing her round grey eyes. How did she do it? She had just worked an eight-hour shift at the club and still seemed to have boundless energy.  She made her worn skinny jeans and Ugg boots look like they were supposed to be that way instead of part of the “bum costume” all the girls wore out of work to dodge the attention of the last to leave customers. Maybe it was the fact that with working just three nights a week she still made enough cash to pay all her bills and save a nice bit. <br/>“Right you are, now lemme help ya finish up so we can go home” Candice snipped back before bumping Hermione over rapidly flicking silverware into the appropriate bins like a niffler set loose on a pile of treasure.<br/>“Mia call it quits girl.” Rick’s gravelly voice called from the kitchen breaking the stream of ting ting ting as forks and knives dropped into their buckets.<br/> “Seriously Hermione, I know you pulled a double but the zombie act ain’t cute. Go home and sleep.” He prodded gently emerging from the kitchen. “Oh, hey Candy, didn’t see you sneak in. There’s a slice of pie wrapped and waiting for each of you waiting on the back counter. I know it’s a real lady’s choice” He added with a smile creasing the worn lines of his face earned over the years of running his family business. <br/>“Thanks Rick, I appreciate it. Let me just sign out.” Hermione sighed sorting the last of the silverware before shuffling to punch out, grab her jacket, and collect their treat with Candice trailing behind her waving goodbye.<br/>The car ride home was filled with Candice softly singing to the Christian music station which still after all these weeks still made Hermione scrunch up her brow. How could a girl be so at ease in a strip club seducing men and capitalizing on being hot still be so into Jesus music? Oh well Hermione sighed.<br/> Years ago, the contradiction would have made the swotty know it all Hermione argue with her over the confusing morality of it all but now it wasn’t her place to judge Afterall, she had made some interesting choices that others didn’t understand. For example, leaving her celebrity status all behind her and for the most part her magic too. Now she only used the minimalist of spells and hadn’t brewed something more difficult than a pepper up potion in almost six months. Candice was a muggle but due to the constant close quarters it wasn’t long before they had to have the talk which Candice took surprisingly well revealing that she had regularly practiced tarot cards and while by her own definition was a Christian, believed there was more out there than just the Good Book. To this Hermione summed it up to just another one of Candice’s free spirit and while she didn’t place much stock in divination did admit that even without traditional magic, Candice gave a better reading than Lavender Brown and Padma Patil on their best days. Who was she kidding anymore Hermione was a far cry from the ambitious second year who brewed Polyjuice in a bathroom and wasn’t entirely sure of how magic flowed, half the theory books she had spent her entire academic career pouring over hadn’t really panned out anyway.  She sighed again. It seemed like tonight was filled with her troublesome reminiscing. <br/>Jeeze Mia what’s with the sighing tonight? I’m not your mom and you aren’t a middle schooler I picked up early from the school dance.” Candice broke from her singing turning down the radio dial. <br/>“It’s nothing Candice, just thinking” Hermione responded. <br/>“Is it about budgeting and money again? You know I don’t mind covering some of your rent, you’re a much better cook than I am. Without you I would be living off chips and cheese again. Plus, you scored us pie” She turned over grabbing the white paper bag shaking it encouragingly.<br/>Hermione sighed again. While the rest of the night had mercifully not included dollar bills drowning in ice water the pocket reserved for tips in her waist apron felt pitifully thin and rent was due tomorrow and as of last night, she was over a hundred dollars short. <br/>“Candice, you know I can’t let you do that.” Hermione pleaded.<br/>“Oh hush, you know it is no big deal. Club was decent tonight even with the weather being crummy.” Candice supplied knowing full well that Hermione wouldn’t accept, a guy could through a stack of hundred-dollar bills on her and Hermione would still say no. This time it was Candice’s turn to sigh. <br/>“Hermione listen I know you won’t take the money, but the club is always taking new dancers and—” Hermione cut her off. <br/>“You know I can’t do that either and that I won’t ever knock your hustle but it’s not right for me.” She readjusted the dial and looked out the window to avoid the big puppy dog eyes imploring her to just try it for a night. <br/>She had heard the argument over and over. This club was different, girls were protected, it wasn’t seedy at all, skanks got fired quickly, it was the best of the best. Hell, this club served alcohol and under state law the girls could only be topless, and you could find a sexy pair of tits in no time flat online anyway. She wouldn’t have to give up her job at Rick’s and could wear a wig and all the girls danced under fake names anyways, it wasn’t like she anyone she knew would ever walk in. The idea of forking out the two hundred dollars for a dance card though immediately stomped whatever feeble contention that she would even try it just for a night. She wouldn’t dream of asking Candice to help her with her rent let alone asking Candice to float the money to pay for a dance card she would chicken out and never even use anyway. <br/>Just then they pulled into the driveway and Candice cut the engine of her Mini Cooper, the one treat she had allowed herself after nearly a year of dancing, effectively dismissing Hermione’s fledging fever dream of becoming an exotic dancer. With that Hermione opened the door and raced up the front steps of their modest townhouse half an hour west of the city to unlock the door while Candice slung her dance bag over her shoulder and hurried behind her. <br/>Sure, maybe they could have found something closer to the University but both young women enjoyed the peacefulness of the suburbs compared to downtown and it gave Candice’s family peace of mind that their little girl was still the small-town angel they wanted her to be, naturally they knew nothing of their daughter’s night time activities. And what Candice had described them as they would shun her for life if they ever found out. <br/>“Check the freezer for some ice cream will ya? Imma throw dance clothes in the wash real quick so I don’t forget tomorrow afternoon.” Candice asked.<br/>“Sure thing.” Hermione nodded wandering past the entry way into their neat kitchen in search of ice cream. <br/>She found it at the bottom of Candice’s junk food drawer stocked with pizza rolls and fish sticks and left it sitting on the counter to soften before attempting to scoop it. Biting her lip Hermione reached for the wad of cash shoved in her apron pocket groaning. It mostly singles intermixed with a few fives. Rick’s served great diner food, but it was just that diner food, and cheap. Which meant a twenty percent tip normally didn’t equate to more than five dollars, seven if she was lucky and tonight was especially poor. Nonetheless Hermione counted it out frowning as she scribbled $63.74 into the orange notebook with “I believe in the power of positive bitching” in bold print splashed across the front cover that Candice had picked up as a housewarming present for her. She was nearly $40 short just to cover rent in the morning and sure she got her actual paycheck later this week she needed some cash to contribute to groceries and had one pod left for the stupid juul Candice had gotten her hooked on after one girl’s night out. Oh well she still had some money left in her savings drawer she would just pick up an extra shift or two and it would all work out. <br/>Sliding it back in the drawer to the right of the refrigerator and picking up the ice-cream scoop Hermione heard the telltale bounds of Candice coming back down the stairs and smiled. After a long day something about cherry pie would wash all the stress away and with that, she grabbed a spoon and collapsed at the table ready to enjoy the few minutes of peace the sticky treat provided. <br/>The girls ate in silence punctuated by the soft clink of spoons on plates and occasional rasp of each girl’s personal cancer stick.<br/>“Mmm what would we do without cherry pie?” Candice hummed, pushing away from the table and placing her plate in the sink.<br/>“Don’t worry about the dishes, I’ve got them in the morning.” Hermione rolled her eyes taking one last drag.<br/>“Thanks momma,” Candice replied sleepily “Imma go take a hoe bath and settle in for the night.” <br/>Hermione nodded as she stood to add her own plate to the sink smiling softly. Candice was a lot of things, neat and tidy wasn’t one of them more like organized chaos. Thankfully they didn’t have to share a room and a it wasn’t the Gryffindor dorms all over again. <br/>The soft smile was later replaced with frown when Hermione opened her small safe tucked in the back corner of her closet. There was only $32 left and she was officially for the first time in her life short on rent and once again had failed this time on something incredibly basic and not a fantasy of grandeur of equal rights for all creatures. She gulped stumbling to the edge of her bed and sitting down resting her elbows on her knees.  <br/>“Easy girl just breathe” she coached herself absently bringing the silver stick to her lips inhaling counting to five and then slowing releasing it. <br/>She pressed her lips together and the hamster started running faster than Harry on his firebolt after the snitch. Candice normally made at least 250 on a week night much more on weekends. What was worse? Starting a spiral of always asking Candice to cover her expenses for her giving dancing a go and asking Candice to help pay for her dance card? Both options required swallowing a great deal of pride. Fuck, where was that Gryffindor spirit now? She needed it desperately and lately it had been absent. Replaced instead by something distinctly Hufflepuff that simply refused to quit and give up. When finally, an image flashed behind her eyes effectively bringing the mind rodent to an abrupt halt. <br/>Candice’s wide grey eyes filled with that secret shame, pain masked under and strong I don’t care what you think attitude fueled by her innate desire for independence. Once again that Hufflepuff streak was alive and well. They only got this little house because Hermione was able to promise that together they would have the stability of two incomes to afford it. She couldn’t do that to Candice to ask her to either move or take on a new roommate and beside Hermione really couldn’t bank on getting another person let alone young woman that would be able to keep quiet about living with a real witch. And that was enough. <br/>Screaming silently Hermione pulled herself up off the bed and set a path straight out her bedroom door and across the hall before she lost her nerve. She gulped and knocked softly on the door before she could pause and fully consider her options. <br/>“Just come in Mia, no need to knock,” Candice called teasingly. <br/>She pushed the door open paused in surprise when she was met with the sight of Candice sitting on her bed surrounded in piles of singles. Candice blushed, Hermione knew she normally avoided letting her see the cash counting process as she never wanted to push Hermione’s decision or make her feel like less because her job certainly didn’t pay as well. That sight was enough.<br/>“Fuck it, I want to do it” Hermione spit out.<br/>Candice jumped sending singles flying onto the floor in a flurry that made Hermione wince knowing that her announcement had certainly resulted in a lose of count. <br/>“Really you mean it? You will give dancing with me a go?” Candice squealed.<br/>“It won’t be permanent,” Hermione cautioned. <br/>“That’s fine, I won’t push you to stay” Candice answered quickly nodding like an erratic bobble head, her hands clasped in front of her chest excitedly trying to rein it in. <br/>“And” Hermione paused, looking around the room nervously before swallowing “I will need a favor.”<br/>“Of course, Mia anything. I will do your make-up and hair every night, I will loan you some outfits, and teach you some dance moves before we go, I will stand in line all afternoon with you to fill out paperwork, anything” Candice rushed.<br/>“I need you to help me pay for my dance card and rent tomorrow. I will pay you back immediately just—” <br/>“Duh bitch I have already planned for all of that” Candice waved her off leaving Hermione to sputter she pressed on “I knew from that first time we met that you had the mental strength necessary to a dancer and when you got a job at Rick’s to carpool that was great and all but that job doesn’t pay jack shit even if Rick is a sweetie and gives us free pie. I also knew this needed to be your choice and that I couldn’t push you. So here.”<br/>Candice got up and padded over to her much larger safe and pulled out a lime green envelope. <br/>“What’s this?” Hermione asked, accepting it reluctantly and opening it with shaking fingers that betrayed the depth of her trepidation.<br/>“Two hundred. For your card and three hundred to buy you some decent shoes, a skirt, cash bag, all the other little extras I wish I had when I started.” Candice responded softly. <br/>“Oh Candy, I can’t take that much, really I will just wear some cute bra and panties I already have.” Hermione answered. <br/>“Girl with your ass and new girl luck you will pay me back in a night you watch.” Candice encouraged. <br/>“Bullshit.” Hermione bit back.<br/>“Just trust me Mia,” Candice implored, “I know this isn’t your first choice but trust me you got this.”<br/>“Just for a bit.” Hermione warned.<br/>“Just for a bit,” Candice echoed, “Now help me count all these singles and consider it practice for counting your own!”<br/>And with that Hermione smiled weakly tucking the envelope into her pocket and bending to gather the dollar bills strewn across the silver rug and beginning to count. No turning back now she thought, Candice would never let her turn back. This time next week she would be a stripper too she realized as her heart jumped in her chest.</p>
