"I'm here, little girl."</p><p>Daphne jumped and tried to locate the owner of the voice; but she could see nothing in the darkness of night.</p><p>She timidly asked, "Who's there?"</p><p>A dark figure emerged from the trees and smirked. "You asked if there were any werewolves and I answered your question."</p><p>Daphne gasped. "Y-Y-Y-You're a werewolf?"</p><p>The man smiled an evil smile. "Y-Y-Y-Yes I am, little girl."</p><p>Daphne said, "I'm not little, I'm in third year."</p><p>The man grinned. "That's still little to my eyes. Now, what are you going to do with your werewolf, little girl?"</p><p>Daphne suddenly unafraid beamed, "Well, I think I should take him out on a meat eating date before I even think of doing anything else with him. What's your name, Mr. Werewolf?"</p><p>The man bowed and told her, "Fenrir Greyback at your service, Miss."</p><p>Daphne replied, "Greengrass, Daphne Greengrass."</p></div>
