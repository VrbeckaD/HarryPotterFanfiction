    <p>Both Kreacher and their own house elf, Dippy were there to meet Bellatrix, Andromeda, Narcissa, Sirius and Regulus as they got off the train from Hogwarts. They were home for the summer, and Bellatrix and Andromeda would be staying with their Uncle and Aunt for the first two weeks of summer. Dippy encouraged Narcissa to go with her—she was to join their mother and father in France. Bellatrix had managed to get out of leaving with thanks to the Dark Lord, who had insisted he needed all the time with her he could get to train her before she returned to school in September. She had 5 months to learn everything possible from him; she already had her mark, after all.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Bellatrix kissed both her younger sister’s goodbye and let Dippy take them, leaving with Sirius, who looked like he’d rather not be with her, and Regulus, who clung to her like a little puppy. An arm around the much shorter little cousin Regulus who was coming home from his first year and couldn’t wait to see his mother particularly, Bellatrix disapparated straight into the foyer of Grimmauld Place. It was sweltering in London.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Immediately, Kreatcher appeared with Sirius and took their trunks upstairs. Bellatrix would no doubt have the whole west wing to herself, but as Regulus sped off to get dressed, Bellatrix wanted to find her Aunt. Walburga had a certain soft spot for Bellatrix—as did Orion, though he worked a fair amount.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Aunty?” Bellatrix called as she made her way into the dining room. It was perfect time for dinner, the sun was streaming in through the back of the huge gardens that ran for what felt like miles. The pool at the back was glistening with shimmering, barely moving water, like silk that caught the sun just right.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Bellatrix.” Orion spoke, catching sight of his niece as soon as he walked in. </p>
<p>She turned immediately, a genuine smile touching her expression, “hi Uncle.”</p>
<p>“Merlin, you’ve grown this past year.” He chuckled as he opened arms out to her.</p>
<p>She didn’t hesitate to move into his arms and press a kiss to his face, “oh <em>stop</em>, you’re just saying that.”</p>
<p>“No, you <em>really</em> have. Look at my little girl, all grown up! Don’t forget to remind me! I was away this year for your birthday, but I’ve still got your present. It’s come all the way from Paris just for you. . .”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Mm, I wonder what it could be.” She gave him a grin as she moved from his arms. He had a habit of spending lavishly on his niece. She was something particularly. . . <em>important</em> to him. Orion hadn’t had a daughter and in truth, he didn’t feel close to either of his sons. His Bellatrix was <em>different</em>. She was beautiful, strong and wilful, a classic Black inside and out. So often he lavished her with expensive jewels, her favourite macaroons from Paris, silken dresses. All of this was much to Druella’s evident annoyance—he needn’t spend so much, she insisted, yet he too insisted it was entirely his <em>pleasure</em> to make Bellatrix happy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But beneath the kind exterior, ulterior motives lay. A sickening warped obsession of the young beauty. He hadn’t acted on it, he wouldn’t. . . until she was of age. <em>Now</em> she was of age; she was seventeen. She was an adult now in the eyes of the Magical World.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Yet the façade never slipped. The kind smile and gentle touch of his hand always remained as familial as it could. He was a <em>father</em> to her when her own father couldn’t be around. He’d had a hand in raising her. He hadn’t lusted her until. . . <em>now</em>. It was as if someone had flicked a switch in his head. He no longer saw his little girl, not when she was so grown up, lean and tall, the perfect pureblood witch.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The heat was unbearable. Bellatrix was sweltering. Her wavy black hair had been tied back in a French braid and she’d thrown half of her clothes aside, clad in black shorts and a black vest top. The seventeen-year-old was staying with her Aunt and Uncle for the first two weeks of summer; both Cygnus and Druella were still in France, tending to one of Druella’s family matters. It wasn’t that she minded – she rather liked Orion and Walburga, but she particularly got along with her Uncle.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She threw the duvet off herself after tossing and turning for the better part of an hour. Maybe a quick trip to her Uncle’s liquor cabinet would do her some good. She didn’t bother putting anything more on; the thin fabric of the old t-shirt was fine.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She hated how the floorboards creaked in Grimmauld place, but she was as stealthy as a cat – it was only when she reached the top of the stairs her Uncle caught her as he was making his way upstairs. Orion Black was only seventeen years older than his niece; they’d all had children so young, but he’d not been twenty and Walburga twenty-one until they’d had their first, Sirius. Cygnus and Druella had just got a move on much sooner, having Bellatrix when Cygnus was seventeen and Druella was sixteen. Much like many members of the Black family, Orion had dark hair, dark, handsome features and grey eyes. He was also adorned in a variety of tattoos, much to Bellatrix’s evident curiosity.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Orion raised a brow at his seventeen-year-old niece, “everything alright?”</p>
<p>“Mhm,” Bellatrix answered as she slipped past him, “just… forgot something earlier.”</p>
<p>“A strong drink?” he questioned flatly.</p>
<p>“Do you mind?” she asked, giving him a look of faint surprise at his forthright question.</p>
<p>“I keep the best stuff in the Master suit. Come.” He gestured for her to follow. “You can’t sleep?”</p>
<p>“No,” she answered, arms folding absentmindedly until they reached the room. It wasn’t often Bellatrix entered Uncle and Aunt’s room, but it was certainly as extravagant as Walburga was. Most of the furniture was a beautiful, deep oak, the drapes that adorned the huge windows all silk and the sheets absolutely divine. They had an attached walk-in room for their clothing and a huge bathroom with a beautiful square tub. It was no wonder their quarters took up half of the third floor of this house.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Take a seat, I’ll get us something.” Orion said, gesturing to the huge king size bed as he made a move for an elegant looking cabinet filled with a variety of drinks. “What would you like?”</p>
<p>“Anything that’ll get me to sleep <em>fast</em>.” She said as she clambered onto the bed, making herself comfortable on what she knew was her Aunt’s side of the bed.</p>
<p>“What’s keeping you awake?” he asked, his back turned from his niece as he made two drinks.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“The heat – and well, you’ve probably heard my father’s marrying me off to Rodolphus Lestrange.” She added with an exaggerated eye roll.</p>
<p>Orion couldn’t help the laugh that left him as he took a glance back at her, “you don’t like him, I take it?”</p>
<p>“He’s fine I just—” Bellatrix pursed her lips as she considered what it was about Rodolphus that she just <em>didn’t like</em>. “he’s boring and he’s a <em>boy</em>.”</p>
<p>“Well, yes my dear I’m afraid generally girls tend to have to marry boys and boys tend to have to marry girls. Our bloodlines would struggle to continue if we didn’t, wouldn’t you say?”</p>
<p>“<em>No</em>, I mean,” Bellatrix sat up, a little laugh leaving her as she leant back on her hands on the softness of the mattress, “he’s a <em>boy</em> – not a <em>man</em>.”</p>
<p>“Ah,” Orion nodded his understanding, glancing to his niece over his shoulder as he made his drink, “you’d rather marry a <em>man,</em> would you?”</p>
<p>“Of course.” She answered a little quieter this time. There was someone playing on her mind… her fingers dragged absentmindedly over the fabric of her shirt, which reached her upper thighs. <em>He</em> was the man she desired, but she’d never dare make that kind of suggestion – he might have her head for it. “Rodolphus is only seventeen, like me.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I’m sure he’ll become quite the man you desire over time, my love.” Orion heaved a sigh as he thought on his marriage to Walburga. It was no secret they didn’t get along – but what they didn’t know, more particularly, what his raven-haired beauty of a niece didn’t know, was quite how abusive Orion and Walburga’s relationship was. “Your Aunt and I didn’t always get along, you know.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I hadn’t noticed.” Bellatrix answered dryly, though Orion immediately picked up on her sarcasm and smirked to himself. She was as witty as she was sharp. He turned, two drinks in his hands and handed one over to his niece.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Perhaps it was wrong of him, but he’d thought of her often over the two days she’d been here. She’d grown up so much— she was a <em>woman</em>. She’d come back from her school year 17 years old and absolutely beautiful. He couldn’t help himself as he’d watched her in the pool, dripping wet as she wrung out raven black hair and walked around in a skimpy bikini. . .  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Thank you.” She smiled faintly as she took the glass and took a gulp. An almost immediate knot fell onto her finely shaped dark brows and she struggled not to cough, “what is this?”</p>
<p>“A little something to help you sleep, as you asked.” The wizard answered as he joined her on his bed, leaning back against the tall leather bedframe.</p>
<p>“Help me sleep? You’re going to have to <em>carry</em> me to my bed.” She scoffed a laugh, taking another gulp, “I like it though. You’re quite the drinks craftsman, Uncle.”</p>
<p>“A man of many talents, so I’ve been told.” Orion suppressed his chuckle at her outright cheekiness, taking a good few gulps of the drink he’d crafted before moving back to her previous point, “like I said, you’ll get used to Rodolphus – one day he’ll be the man you desire. If not, kill him and move on.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Perhaps but that’s unlikely.” She murmured into her glass, though she couldn’t help but grin at his final comment. Oh, if only he knew that was <em>exactly</em> what Bellatrix would do. There were many men Bellatrix could envision herself with and Rodolphus Lestrange, no matter how handsome and charming and disgustingly into her he was, was <em>not</em> one of them. “At the end of the day, when I marry him, he’s <em>still </em>going to be a <em>boy</em> and I don’t want to give him the satisfaction of being my—”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Bellatrix had paused as she’d realised what she was saying and who she was saying it to. But Orion just watched her with some curiosity, asking, “your what?”</p>
<p>She hesitated for some moments but eventually answered after she cleared her throat, “of being my first.”</p>
<p>Orion remained silent for a second before he shrugged his shoulders, “so don’t give him the satisfaction of being the first then. What he doesn’t know won’t hurt him.”</p>
<p>“Gee, what a great way to go into a marriage.” Bellatrix responded, raising her brows, though she couldn’t help the faint glimmer of an amused smirk touching her lips.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Orion didn’t say anything further though clearly; he was suppressing a smirk at her sarcasm as he took a good few gulps, hiding his neatly trimmed moustache and beard behind the glass.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I must be overthinking.” Bellatrix said after a moment before she shrugged it off. “Where’s Aunt Walby by the way? I didn’t even ask.”</p>
<p>“She’s gone away with your father.” He replied.</p>
<p>“I thought my father and mother were gone together. . .” Bellatrix trailed off, perfectly shaped brows furrowing in ever so slight confusion.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I highly doubt my wife would go anywhere with your mother for longer than necessary. But perhaps.”</p>
<p>“Well,” Bellatrix gave a scoff as she sank a little lower into the bed, “I don’t blame her, my mother is worse than a banshee at times.” </p>
<p>Orion gave a chuckle, pulling the thin sheet over his niece, “you’re more like Walburga than even <em>I’d </em>care to admit, Bellatrix.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Should I take offence since it’s clear you don’t like your wife that much?” she asked, lower lip still pressed to the rim of the glass before she bought it back to her tongue, becoming a little more accustomed to the taste.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A grin that curled one corner of his lips formed moments later, grey eyes scrutinising the teenage witch in his bed. He answered after a time, plucking the glass which she had almost finished from her hands and downing the last gulp for himself. He set the glass beside his own empty glass. “Not quite, but I <em>do</em> however think you’ve had enough to drink.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Mhm I agree, I’m sleepy enough now. . .” a yawn made her trail off the rest of her sentence as she slid low enough that she was lying in the huge bed, propped up only by one of the large, fluffy pillows.</p>
<p>“Come on kid, I’ll take you to bed— and remind me to teach you how to hold your drink a little better.” He chuckled, leaning over to scoop her up into his arms.</p>
