    <p>“I honestly can’t see how you can spend a whole <em> two </em>hours in there!”</p>
<p>“How can I <em> not </em>?”</p>
<p>“You’ve been there a hundred times this year already!” Lily exclaimed, “Surely they haven’t got anything <em> that </em> new!”</p>
<p>James just shook his head.</p>
<p>You have no appreciation for the fine arts Lily.”</p>
<p>“If that’s what you consider ‘fine arts’.” Lily muttered.</p>
<p>“Sorry love? Didn’t hear you.”</p>
<p>“Oh! I said how can a mere <em> mortal </em> like myself ever compare to the <em> great </em> James Potter’s vast mastery of the <em> finest </em> of arts!” Lily replied in an admiringly breathless voice.</p>
<p>“Now, now,” he said, putting an arm around her shoulders, “Don’t be too hard on yourself! Even someone like you can be as good as me.”</p>
<p>Lily paused, raising an eyebrow at him.</p>
<p>“‘Someone like me’?”</p>
<p>Her tone was calm, but James knew better.</p>
<p>“What do you mean by that?”</p>
<p><em> Well, </em> he thought, <em> better start digging. </em></p>
<p>“I just meant that a girl- no! not a girl because girls can do it too!”<em> foot, </em> “But someone who sticks to the rules. Not that you’re a stick in the mud!” <em> Meet mouth. </em></p>
<p>Lily merely hummed, pursing her lips. He wasn’t sure if she was angry or trying not to laugh.</p>
<p>He hoped it was the latter.</p>
<p>Suddenly her eyes lit up and Lily rushed past James, squealing.</p>
<p>“A puppy!” she cooed at the, very clearly, not-puppy, “Oh, who’s a good boy? You! Yes you are!”</p>
<p>No he wasn’t. He was most definitely <em> not </em> a good boy, but a very <em> bad </em> Sirius.</p>
<p>James wanted to groan.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you a handsome boy!” Lily said, now scratching the shaggy black dogs back as he wagged his tail.</p>
<p>“He looks like a mangy stray,” James said, “I wouldn’t get to close Lily. Who knows what sort of diseases he’s picked up from the gutter”</p>
<p>That earned him a glare from the dog.</p>
<p>James glared right back.</p>
<p>“What are you talking about James?” Lily asked, looking up at him, “He looks well cared for. Probably just broke out of his yard.”</p>
<p>“Oh look! There’s no collar, I guess we’ll just have to leave him here then! Say bye to the pretty lady doggy!”</p>
<p>“James what are you-oof!”</p>
<p>Sirius had tackled Lily to the ground and began licking her face.</p>
<p>“Oi!” James yelled, pulling the dog off her.</p>
<p>The dog then turned on him and began tugging at his jacket. One Sirius <em> knew </em> James couldn't get replaced until summer.</p>
<p>“Geroff!”</p>
<p>“Don’t hurt him James!”</p>
<p>“He’s attacking me!”</p>
<p>He’s playing!</p>
<p>The dog stopped tugging on the jacket and trotted off to stand next to Lily who rubbed his ears again</p>
<p>“I wonder who you belong to.”</p>
<p>“He belongs in the pound!”</p>
<p>Lily shot him a glare.</p>
<p>“Do you know what the kill rate in those places are?” She hugged the dog close to her chest. “I could never put an animal there!”</p>
<p>James thought the dog was enjoying the hug a little too much.</p>
<p>“What are you going to do with it Lily?” He queried, “You can’t take him up to the castle dogs aren’t allowed.”</p>
<p>“Maybe Hagrid-”</p>
<p>“Already has a giant dog and a number of other terrifying pets I’m sure.”</p>
<p>“I don’t want to just leave him.” she frowned, thinking.</p>
<p>“Look,” James stepped closer to her, “I’m sure he’s just being a git to his owners,” the dog huffed, “Who are probably wanting him to get fixed or something, so he’s having a bit of fun before his tackle’s taken.”</p>
<p>James smirked at the dog who had frozen stock-still.</p>
<p>Suddenly, he bounded away from Lily and James and sped around the corner.</p>
<p>“Hey!” Lily called, “Come back!”</p>
<p>James sighed, “That’s a real shame.”</p>
<p>“I hope he gets home alright.” Lily said quietly.</p>
<p>“I’m sure he will,” he said, putting an arm around Lily, “Now, let’s head to The Three Broomsticks. I’m freezing!”</p>
<hr/>
<p>“Hey you two Lovebirds!”</p>
<p>Lily and James looked towards the voice where Sirius was waving them over from a booth in the pub. They made their way over and sat down opposite him.</p>
<p>“Pete and Remus are just getting drinks.” He said, “How was your date?”</p>
<p>James saw a smirk growing on his best mate’s face.</p>
<p>“It was lovely!” Lily answered, “We walked around for a bit, looked in some shops. James spent <em> forever </em> in Zonko’s.”</p>
<p>“Which is justifiable.”</p>
<p>Remus and Peter had just returned with a mug of butterbeer for each of them.</p>
<p>“Not you too Remus!” She pleaded, “I thought you appreciated following the rules.”</p>
<p>“There’s nothing that says you can’t break the rules,” He said, casually, “Just that there are consequences if you get caught.”</p>
<p>“So does that explain why you lot always get caught?” she asked.</p>
<p>“They get caught,” Remus clarified,“Not me.”</p>
<p>“Hmm,” she pursed her lips, not able to completely disagree, “Oh, and we saw a dog.”</p>
<p>“What kind of dog?” Peter asked.</p>
<p>“Why have you three seen a dog walking around?” James  asked, looking directly at Sirius, “He was a big, black, shaggy mutt. Hideous thing really.”</p>
<p>“Hey!”</p>
<p>“What are you talking about James?” Lily asked, turning to him, “He wasn’t hideous at all.”</p>
<p>“Yeah! What are you talking about James?”</p>
<p>“Well, did you happen to see him Sirius?” Remus asked, a smile playing on his face.</p>
<p>“I believe Lily.”</p>
<p>“Thank you Sirius.”</p>
<p>“I’m sure he was a handsome devil.”</p>
<p>“Well, he owes me a new Jacket.”</p>
<p>“James, James James,” Sirius laughed, “You know dogs can’t go into shops and buy things!”</p>
<p>"If he wants to keep his bollocks he will."</p>
<p>"James!"</p>
