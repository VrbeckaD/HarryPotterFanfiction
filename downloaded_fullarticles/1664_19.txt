    <p>The moving trucks outside whistled, the sound of rubber tires on pavement filled his ears. He didn't want to look up, out the window, see who was going to replace his one and only friend Ron. That idea scared him, the thought he'd never see Ron again. They'd make due, right? </p><p>They always do. They always pull through. </p><p>It was always Ron and Harry against the world. </p><p>He willed himself a peak out of the glass but what he saw surprised him. Standing on the grass, looking sunken, had to be the prettiest boy on Earth. Maybe it was just the pale lighting, but his hair looked like a halo around his pretty, pointed face.</p><p>He was in awe. That couldn't be a human, could it? That couldn't be.. That was a doll. That had to be a 5-foot-something doll because Harry couldn't spot a single imperfection and it was standing completely motionless on he lawn. </p><p>It-- he-- must have felt Harry's gaze on him, because his head whipped to the side and he pressed two stormy eyes to Harry's. The look made Harry's breath catch in his throat. </p><p>"Did you see our new neighbors, Dudely?" Aunt Petunia asked as she bustled around the kitchen, making dinner for her family. Her hands were silent and nimble, whipping around the counters with all the newest cooking technology. </p><p>"Yeah, I did mother. I saw their car too. What's wrong, movin' into a place like this with a car like that?" Dudely questioned, tapping his fingers on the wood so it made a soft, organized click that irritated Harry to no end. </p><p>Aunt Petunia began without looking up from her creation, "I don't know, Dud. But I say you make good friends with that boy." </p><p>"Why?" Dudley questioned. He doesn't make friends, he intimidates people into being his friend, Harry thought. He wonder if maybe he could do that, too, if he could bully someone into liking him. If he didn't have the reputation he did now maybe he'd try it. Even though he probably wouldn't scare a soul. </p><p>Maybe with the doll-kid. </p><p>"Alright, Duddles. Looks like Vernon will be late..." She worried at her lip, looking at the clock over her stove. "Looks like its just you and me," a sneer made way to her made-up face, "and Harry." </p><p>She placed a plate piled with food in front of Dudley, an average portioned one in front of herself, and one void of much at all for her nephew. Harry didn't mind it too much, actually. His stomach had grown used to the starvation and it just allowed him to leave the table all the more quicker. </p><p>"You know," Aunt Petunia started, hawk-like eyes trained onto Harry's, "you better not get too close to that new lad. You will ruin everything." </p><p>"Isn't a little rude to only want to hang out with someone because your parents like his parent's car?" Harry pressed.</p><p>The woman released a heavy, exhausted breath through her thin chapped lips. "Isn't it a little rude to disrespect the people who care for you? Who gives you a place to stay and feeds you a balanced diet? You're just like your mother..."</p><p>Harry shook his head and stood, slamming his empty chair so hard under the table the silverware shook. Dudley's lip quivered, but before Aunt Petunia or Dudley could say another word, Harry disappeared into his stairwell closet and curled up on his tiny mess of blankets. </p><p>"I hate you, I hate you, I hate you," he mumbled to himself, into the sea of his pillow, tears wettening his cheeks. He cried until his heart calmed, until his skin was dry and uncomfortable with tears. When his eyes could no longer produce any more liquid, he looked to the wall clock limply pressed into the corner of his room. </p><p>"I should run away. Yeah. I could make out." He glanced to his bent knees, "I'm big enough. I could live in a cave." There are no caves in Pivot Drive. He battled with the voice inside his head until he fell into a light, colorful sleep. </p><p>Â </p><p>He could see the blond boy immediately. Stargazing, leaning over the edge of a building, fingers tight around a solid steel fence. He was completely steady and still in the most elegant of positione. When he straightened out to face Potter, he was just a little shorter than him.</p><p>"Hey," Potter greeted shyly. He was desperate to hear the boy speak. Maybe he'd sound as he looked. Perfect, light, and regal. Maybe he was an American. Whatever he was, he was so absolutely, frustratingly beautiful. He was so pretty, his skin so pale, his eyes so grey and intense. His hair was just as perfect as the rest of him. Harry wanted to reach out and touch them. "I'm Harry."</p><p>The kid looked at him expectantly. His face was almostunreadable, but Harry could see just a tinge of annoyance. Why was this boy such a twat? Couldn't he just be another carbon copy of Ron, just a lot of shorter and a lot prettier? </p><p>"What's yours?" Harry pressed, desperate for a word. He wanted to devour this boy. He wanted to surround himself in lemons and sea storms and untouched, soundless snow. </p><p>The boy opened his mouth, but his vision faded into the red of his eyelids before he could say a word.</p>
