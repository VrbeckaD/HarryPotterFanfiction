    <p>“We’re back!” called out a shrill voice as the front door to the Aomine manor slammed open.</p>
<p>Daichi Aomine smirked as he looked across to his son who let out a sigh of exasperation. The two males had been playing one on one quidditch in their back yard while the women of the house had been out shopping. But they knew they would have to go into to listen to the gossip of Diagon alley and dutifully inspect their purchases.</p>
<p>“Next to score wins” declared Daichi as he threw the quaflle to his son.</p>
<p>Catching the ball Daiki zoomed off towards the lone goal they had set up a few years ago. His father was quick to catch up when his son had to jerk his broom to the right to avoid a bludger and chuckled loudly as he knocked the ball from the youth’s arm.</p>
<p>With a low growl the tanned boy pushed forward and surprised his dad with how quickly he was able to get in front and block a shot at the goal. Daiki caught the falling quaflle and threw the ball with little to no form to make the winning goal of their match.</p>
<p>Daichi followed his son to the ground and slung an arm over the youth’s shoulder, “that’s an interesting shot you got there!” he said with a large smile.</p>
<p>The two propped up their brooms by the large glass doors, “Slytherin hates it” Daiki answered with a smirk.</p>
<p> They were interrupted by a tall tan woman pulling her husband into a hug with her hands full of large bags that sparkled and changed color. Diagon Alley shops were very bright with their advertising, Daiki thought as he side stepped a large pink bag that had hearts fluttering around on it. Ew.</p>
<p>A pink haired girl giggled from behind him, “Who won?” she asked cheerfully as she plopped onto a large plush couch in the sitting room.</p>
<p>Daiki smirked arrogantly, “me obviously” he said stated while taking a pumpkin pasty from a plate on the coffee table.</p>
<p>A light slap to the head greeted Daiki as he parents joined the children in the sitting room, “I was wining ten to three you brat” Daichi admonished while he sat next to his son while his wife joined Satsuki.</p>
<p>Daiki rubbed his head and glared at his dad while the girls laughed. Once everyone was settled the shoppers dropped their bags on the floor in front of them making Daichi and his son sweat drop at the number of things the two bought.</p>
<p>Evalyn Aomine pulled out a number of dresses and was satisfied that her husband liked everyone one of them while Satsuki showed off some clothing of her own. Daichi sighed fondly as he watched his wife gush over her new clothes, books and trinkets and asked for his opinion on her findings.</p>
<p>Once they were done going through all of their shopping bags Mrs. Aomine glanced out the window and noticed how close the sun was to setting, “Aren’t your friends supposed be here for dinner?” she asked already in the process of getting up to start food preparations.</p>
<p>Daiki groaned as he was reminded of his so-called friends. He didn’t really have a problem with any of the other “Futures” but he wouldn’t really call them his friends. Midorima was a crazy horoscope cult following weirdo. Murasakibara didn’t like anything other than sweets and Aomine was surprised he actually played quidditch. Haizaki was a bully with a family name to defend him. Akashi actually scared him sometimes, the little red head had this strange power around him that made the bluenette not want to go against him. He actually might be able to consider Kuroko a friend, after all he grew up with the teal haired boy and they got along well. Okay, he was friends with Kuroko.</p>
<p>Daichi stood up to help his wife, “Alright, you two go make sure the guest rooms are prepared” he directed before going off into the dining room.</p>
<p>Though the Aomine’s are a notable pure blood family that has been around for centuries they believe themselves to be more forward thinking. They had house elves, but they worked for salary and not because of the old custom of slavery. Also, Daichi did not want his children to grow up spoiled like a lot of pure-blooded children he has seen and made his children do chores as well.</p>
<p>An hour later supper was being placed on the table when a loud knock came from the door. Momoi ran down the stairs after spending the last forty minutes “getting ready” and was wearing one of her new dresses, a cute white dress with pink flowers. She quickly opened the door with a bright smile when she saw one of her favorite people.</p>
<p>“Tetsu!” she squealed in delight as she pulled their neighbor from a few houses down into a bone crushing hug.</p>
<p>The teal haired boy carefully extracted himself from her arms, “Good evening Momoi. I ran into the others as well” he gestured to the small group of classmates behind him.</p>
<p>With a bright smiled the Ravenclaw ushered them all into the dining room where Aomine was already eating while his mother scolded him about his manners.</p>
<p>“Good evening Mr. and Mrs. Aomine. Thank you for having us stay with you for the weekend” greeted Akashi as he shook the adult’s hands.</p>
<p>Daichi smiled guiltily, “You boys are always welcome. I am sorry to say but the Mrs. and I just got assigned a mission and will need to be leaving soon” he apologized while holding up a black envelope.</p>
<p>A grey owl was perched on one window sill indicating the letter had most likely arrived not even a few seconds ago. With a sigh Evalyn flicked her wand and two bags floated towards the couple, “We should only be gone for a week at most” she explained to Daiki and Satsuki, “don’t get into trouble and I will be sending an owl to Testsuya’s mother and she will be keeping an eye on you Daiki.”</p>
<p>The bluenette scoffed with an eye roll but said his good byes and then his parents apparated away. This was not an unusual occurrence and the Futures were used to these things happening because of their own parents’ line of work. Momoi put out the last few plates and then the Hogwarts students started their supper.</p>
<p>“I like your mom’s food” stated Murasakibara as he waved his wand to copy the food already on his plate so he could eat more.</p>
<p>Haizaki rolled his eyes, “You like all food” he said while slurping on his stew loudly.</p>
<p> The purple haired boy shrugged and continued to eat. Akashi and Midorima had a pleasant conversation about a wizard’s chess while Aomine and Kuroko talked about quidditch and trading witty jabs for the coming year.</p>
<p>Once everyone seemed full, except for the purple haired Hufflepuff, Momoi collected the dishes and Akashi lead everyone to the large entertainment room. Aomine rolled his eyes at how the red haired boy felt in charge to easily in someone else’s home.</p>
<p>“Thank you again for letting us use your home Daiki and Satsuki” Akashi said as he seated himself in a leather recliner, “Now there a few things I think we need to discuss before we start training for the tournament”</p>
<p>The summer quidditch tournament is an event that most magical families look forward to every year. It was a fun community event that the Ministry of Magic encouraged of most people to come and participate of spectate. The event encouraged witches and wizards of all ages to compete and generally there were age brackets so that everyone was on a fair playing field. The Futures had first joined the tournament last year when they had all met at a boring retirement party for some bloke that their parents cared about. Akashi had asked if they wanted to make a team together, Momoi volunteered to be their manager and they all met once a week to train together.</p>
<p> When the day of the tournament showed up no one had anticipated for the team with one player short to destroy the pre-student bracket. Many players complained that they had a first-year student, Haizaki and should have been placed in the student bracket. To appease the players and fans the event planners had the Futures play in the next round of matches in the student age group where they also won. This year Akashi had spoken with the event coordinators for the tournament and his team would be participating in the adult age group.</p>
<p>For the last month Seeker Weekly had been running many stories about the upcoming tournament. Many wizards had been interviewed claiming that the Futures were only using their parents’ names to win the younger divisions the previous year. But, that would not being happening this year and if they wanted to play with adults then they would be treated like one. No exceptions.</p>
<p>Akashi held up the most recent issue of Seeker Weekly and it had a picture of everyone present in the room on it, “Our opponents are not going to be easy this year so I have decided to make an addition to our roster so that we can have a full team” he explained.</p>
<p>That perked everyone’s interest, “who would be able to keep pace with us?” asked Haizaki cockily as he lounged on a love seat with his legs thrown over the arm rest.</p>
<p>The red head stood up with a small sparkle in his eye, “I think he just arrived” and then a knock came from the front door, “Satsuki would you please let him in?”</p>
<p>The pinkette traded questioning glances with Kuroko before quickly leaving the room to answer the door. They heard a loud gasp from the girl and Aomine had a sneaking feeling he knew who would be walking into his home.</p>
<p>“Momoicchi!” exclaimed a gratingly familiar voice that made Aomine curse under his breath and Kuroko pat his shoulder mockingly.</p>
<p>A few moments later Ryouta Kise followed Momoi into the entertainment room looking slightly startled to see all of his classmates.</p>
<p>“What’s up?” he asked happily after a moment.</p>
<p>Akashi nodded in greeting to the blonde, “Glad you could make it Ryouta. We were just about to discuss our training schedule”.</p>
<p>The bubbly blonde seemed to be aware of what the red head was talking about, he quickly sat down next to Momoi who pulled him the rest of the way into the room.</p>
<p>Before Akashi could continue his explanation Haizaki laughed mockingly from his slouched position, “You expect me to believe this guy is supposed to be on our team? He’s not even on his own house team!”</p>
<p>Surprisingly Aomine was the one to speak up for the blonde, “That’s because he’s never played until last year” he said casually.</p>
<p>That just made the silver haired boy laugh more making the blonde blush slightly in embarrassment, “Oh Merlin this is the best joke ever.”</p>
<p>Akashi glared at his fellow housemate, ready to scold his teammate when Kise spoke up, “If you think you’re that good why don’t we play one-on-one?” one golden eyebrow raised.</p>
<p>Momoi looked worriedly between the two boys, “Wait a mi-“</p>
<p>“Fine, first to fifty wins” challenged Haizaki as he slowly stood up to glare down at the blonde, “If you lose, you’re not on the team.”</p>
<p>Kise just nodded not losing his smirk. Kuroko looked to his half-brother and saw that Akashi looked satisfied with the proceedings. He probably planned this, thought the quiet boy as he rose to follow the group out to the yard.</p>
<p>Aomine, Momoi, Kuroko and Midorima cast a lumos charm to light up the small field so that the players could see. Murasakibara sat on the grass while munching on a bag of chocolate frogs but was keeping a close eye on the game. Akashi mounted a broom to take on the role of referee while Kise and Haizaki geared up quickly.</p>
<p>“who do you think is going to win?” Momoi asked curiously as she watched the two boys fly up in the air to start the match.</p>
<p>Kuroko watched as Haizaki shoved the smaller boy out of the way to try and score but Kise managed to use his broom to deflect the shot, “I think that Akashi already knows who he wants on the team.”</p>
<p>The pinkette looked at him curiously but shrugged before turning her attention back to the match. Each player managed to score a goal already. Aomine smirked as he saw the determined look in those golden eyes that he has become familiar with after a year of playing against the persistent blonde.</p>
<p>“Haizaki is getting desperate” Midorima commented as he watched the boy almost pull Kise off of his broom.</p>
<p>The others nodded in agreement. The score was now tied forty to forty and Kise had a large bruise forming on his cheek but he didn’t lose the fire to win.</p>
<p>Haizaki snarled at the blonde as he tried to gain his breath back, “I’m not gonna’ let some no named half breed beat me.”</p>
<p>Golden eyes widen in surprise and Haizaki used that moment to score his last goal shouldering through the blonde. The Slytherin’s larger frame knocked Kise from his broom and the blonde fell a short ten feet to the ground.</p>
<p>“Alright pretty boy, get out of here” sneered Haizaki as he towered over the looser of the match.</p>
<p>A moment later Akashi landed next to the two, “Actually Shougo, I will be asking Ryouta to stay with us and for you to leave”</p>
<p>The Slytherin looked at his housemate in confusion, “What are you talking about?” he growled.</p>
<p>The red head glared at Haizaki, his miss matched eyes eerie in the lumos created light, “You have already reached your maximum potential. While, Ryouta has yet to scratch the surface of his and will far exceed your abilities in a short amount of time” he explained as the rest of the spectators looked on surprised.</p>
<p>Anger quickly raged through the older boy but he managed to not do something that he would regret. With a glare at the all students around him the silver haired boy pulled out his wand and summoned his bag and then walked away.</p>
<p>“Congratulations Ryouta” Akashi said as he turned to face the stunned blonde.</p>
<p>Aomine wrapped his arm around his housemate’s shoulders, “you are nowhere near able to beat me yet” he said while the blonde smiled brightly at the group.</p>
<p>Satisfied that Kise was going to be a new addition to the team Akashi spoke with a commanding voice, “We will start training tomorrow morning.”</p>
<p>Momoi watched as the young quidditch team flew around in the sky above her house. She had a quick note quill writing frantically as she observed the players.</p>
<p>“Akashi I’m going to release the snitch now” she called out as she opened a box for the golden ball to fly from.</p>
<p>The red haired boy quickly jumped from the three on three game to chase after it. While the five adjusted to the change Momoi went inside to look for the Seeker Weekly magazine and read up on some of their opponents. She found it on the kitchen counter but was surprised at what was underneath it.</p>
<p>Grabbing the other magazine as well the pinkette ran back outside, “Ki!” she called for the blonde.</p>
<p>With a wave towards his teammates the Gryffindor joined the team manager, “Yes?” he asked sweetly while wiping the sweat from his forehead.</p>
<p>She held up the latest issue of Spella Weekly without a word.</p>
<p>The blonde gasped in surprise as he grabbed it from her, “I didn’t realize it was for Spella” he said in amazement.</p>
<p>Momoi squealed loudly, “You’re a model?”</p>
<p>Kise scratched his neck sheepishly, “I wouldn’t say I am a model. This is the only photo shoot that I have done”</p>
<p>By now the rest of the team had joined them after hearing Momio’s shout. Aomine snatched the magazine from his house mate and saw golden eyes shining up at him from the front cover, it was kind of weird looking in his opinion.</p>
<p>“Did they put makeup on you?” he asked in disbelief as he tossed it to Kuroko much to Kise’s dismay.</p>
<p>The model was wearing the Hogwarts uniform, a white button up shirt with a sweater vest and was running a hand through his shining hair while fluttering his long lashes. The tealnette passed it to Akashi with Murasakibara and Midorima looking over his shoulder easily.</p>
<p>“Shut up Aomineicchi” whined the blonde.</p>
<p>The blue haired boy glared at the whining model, “That’s not my name.”</p>
<p>Kise’s whining quickly turned into a smirk, “But’s it’s my nickname for you. I add icchi to anyone I consider a friend” he said with a big smile.</p>
<p>Aomine rolled his eyes, “ew are you a girl?” he teased causing the blonde to pout.</p>
<p>Momoi smacked her adoptive brother on the head and then sent the boys back to practicing. Reminding them that their first match is in two days.</p>
<p>The Draco family volunteered to host the tournament this year and the Ministry was thankful for it because, their manor was secluded making it easy for a quidditch arena to appear quickly over the course of a few weeks. Hundreds of witches and wizards had already seated themselves in the stands by the time Akashi arrived with his teammates.</p>
<p>“how does this work?” asked Kise as he followed Midorima into a row of seats reserved for them.</p>
<p>Momoi easily explained the bracket system for the tournament. Teiko, their team name,  would need to win five games in a row to win the tournament. If they lose then they were done. The prize this year was a vile of liquid luck for each member and a large sum of money.</p>
<p>“Some of these teams are new so I don’t have much information on them” Momoi admitted as they watched the first match between a team of old men that should probably not have been on the brooms against a team of all women.</p>
<p>Aomine shrugged as he watched the boring game, “If they are anything like these guys then we don’t need to worry.”</p>
<p>Even with his teammate’s words of confidence Kise was still worried, he has never played a real game before and they are playing down one player. Akashi explained that a seventh person right now would mess up their dynamics when the blonde was already new and it would be better to stick with six. Great.</p>
<p>“Let’s go get changed, we are next” said the red-haired captain after watching the game for another thirty minutes.</p>
<p>It seemed one of the older men caught sight of the snitch and the game would be coming to a close soon.</p>
<p>Kise felt like he was living a dream. Over the course of the week his team had won every game and the blonde was amazed at how much fun it was to play with a team instead of one on one like he was used to. Teiko was in the championship game and their opponents did not look happy to be playing against a team of eleven and twelve-year-old students. Momoi had decided to make him the lone beater because of their low numbers and Kise ability to quickly learn what their opponents were doing.</p>
<p>Currently he was floating around the middle of the pitch watching Aomine and Kuroko exchange fist bumps after an awesome pass that lead to the tanned boy’s goal. They were like a shadow and light combo, Kuroko hiding behind the tanned boy’s bright aura to make the undetected passes.</p>
<p>“Atsuhi please stop eating” Akashi called from the behind the blonde making him turn around to see their keeper eating a handful of candy.</p>
<p>The purple haired boy sighed in exasperation as he put the bag of sugary sweets in a pocket of his robes, “But this is so boring” he whined to the seeker.</p>
<p>Kise could see why he thought it was boring the keeper had yet to give up a single goal the whole tournament. He made it look so easy guarding all three hoops and not ever looking surprised by a shot from the opponents. Kise found it kind of curious why the boy played quidditch when he seemed to not enjoy it all that much.</p>
<p>The blonde continued to fly around the field using the bludgers to disrupt the other team to give Aomine the chance to steel the quaffle back or to give Midorima time to set up his long shot. After a short half hour Akashi caught the snitch ending the game with a score of 530 to 0.</p>
<p>“Teiko wins” signaled the referee sending the stands into a loud roar of cheers and whistles.</p>
<p>When all six players landed on the ground Aomine slung his arm around Kise’s shoulder, “Nice game Kise” he said while messing up his teammates hair, “you better try out for Gryffindor this year” he joked.</p>
<p>The blonde nodded excitedly, “you better hope I don’t show you up” he teased back.</p>
<p>Akashi called for the teams attention so they could be awarded the trophy, which Akashi would be keeping since he was captain. There were lots of flashing lights and questions being thrown about the boys ignored them as they said their thanks to the event organizers and went to go change.</p>
<p>Rita Skeeter was never one to be pushed aside though as she chased after the boys, “Why was Shougo Haizaki not playing with you this year? What will you be using the liquid luck for? Murasakibara are you half giant? Ryouta Kise are you using this tournament to become a Future?” she prattled on some more questions before Akashi spun around to face the blonde reporter.</p>
<p>With a business smile that he had learned from his father he stared he down, “Mrs. Skeeter, I would kindly like to remind you that we are underage wizards who cannot be spoken to by reporters without our guardians present. Must I tell my father that my teammates and I were badgered on our way to the locker room?” he asked with a raised eyebrow.</p>
<p>The journalist huffed before turning around and walking away not wanting to incur the wrath of the Akashi family. Satisfied the short seeker continued to lead his team into the lockers rooms to change.</p>
<p>“I hate that woman” grumbled Murasakibara as he sat down heavily on one of the benches.</p>
<p>Momoi gave him a chocolate frog with a sympathetic smile. The purple haired boy had always been made fun of because of his height. There was no proof in his family tree that anyone was related to a giant, everyone just happened to be extremely tall. But that didn’t stop the witches from gossiping at the high class parties or for the spoiled brats they raised from teasing him.</p>
<p>Aomine slapped a hand on the tall boy’s shoulder, “who cares what other people think” he stated before pulling off his flying robes and changing shoes.</p>
<p>The others followed suit and Akashi congratulated everyone and gave a quick speech about their performance and expects them to all maintain this level of play at school. Otherwise they would all be bored. Once everyone was ready to leave Momoi opened the door and was surprised to see a flyer floating in front of her face.</p>
<p>Grabbing the charmed paper she let out an irritated groan, “That women…” she huffed as thrust the flyer into Aomine’s chest.</p>
<p>He was unsurprised a picture of his teammates holding their vials of liquid luck and trophy. Kise had his arms around Aomine and Kuroko laughing giddily while Akashi smirked with the trophy in his arms. Midorima was displaying his lucky item, a whistle, like it was his own trophy. Murasakibara was happily eating his sweets. The picture wasn’t the problem though, it was the script floating around the image.</p>
<p>THE GENERATION OF MIRACLES</p>
