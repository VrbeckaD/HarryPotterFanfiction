  <p>The war festers inside the body. The wine slinks down, first one glass, then another.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>She feels like she’s lived lifetimes; she remembers the first time she and Ron kissed, remembers the pain of cat hairs in poly juice potion, remembers waking from being petrified, feeling hollow. She also remembers the first time she entered her office at the ministry, how excited she was to start working, remembers restoring her parents memories in Australia, their confused smiles as they came to.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Ron puts his arm around her and she leans her head on his shoulder. They’re at the leaky cauldron, at the weekly after work, surrounded by everyone they love: there’s Harry and Ginny, George, Neville, Luna, so many faces, so many smiles. Hermione sighs, takes another sip, feels her eyelids becoming heavy. Tired to the bones.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Ron nudges her, kisses her cheek: "Hey, 'Mione. Cheer up." </p>
</div><div>
  <p>She sighs, kisses him back, tries to swallow down the sadness. The war was won, sure, but there are way too many smiles, everywhere, way too often. Is no on else suffering from insomnia, like she is? Aren't there memories pestering their minds, refusing to leave them alone? Bellatrix Lestrange's wide eyes as she smiled, lips the colour of blood. She laughed and she laughed and the pain was unbearable. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Hermione downs the wine glass and can feel it get to her head. </p>
  <p>Leaky Cauldron is getting packed, more and more young Ministry workers gathering to celebrate the weekend. She closes her eyes, tries to will herself into a better mood. <em>Come on, come on, come on. Smile. Have fun. Look at your boyfriend.</em> </p>
  <p>She opens her eyes and takes Ron's hand.</p>
  <p>"Come on. Let's dance." </p>

  <p>No matter how drunk she is, no matter how tired she is, the dreams come. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>It always starts in the basement, leads to Bellatrix standing above her, carving into her arm. The dreams end with blue piercing eyes illuminated by a lone candle in the basement. Blue eyes and blonde hair and one, single, gentle touch to the cheek. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Every night, Narcissa Malfoy appears in her dreams, eyes wide and face achingly empty. There's always that flicker. Mrs Malfoy is one of the few people left alive who know what Hermione went through at Malfoy Manor during those days and hours, and Hermione doesn't know what to do with that thought. Does it mean anything? Why does she keep appearing like this, every night? The dreams roam her body, leaving a heavy feeling in her limbs. </p>

  <p>After some weeks, Hermione decides to talk to Ginny about it. They're at the Burrow, having eaten Sunday dinner and she and Ginny have decided to take a walk in the apple garden. </p>
  <p>"Ginny?" Hermione says, brushing her dark curls out of her face so she can look at the red headed witch.</p>
  <p>"Hmm?"</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"How often do you dream?"</p>
</div><div>
  <p> "Uh..." Ginny frowns, gives her a side-eye, "I honestly don't know. You mean how often do I remember a dream? Maybe once every second week...? Sometimes more often, sometimes less."</p>
  <p>She nods. </p>
  <p>"Why?" Ginny's eyes are gentle in the evening sunlight and so very wise. Hermione looks away and clears her throat. Ginny continues: "Are you having dreams?</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Hermione nods. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"About what?"</p>
  <p>"Nightmares." </p>
  <p>"About what?" </p>
  <p>"I'd rather not say. But... yeah. You can probably guess." </p>
  <p>Ginny nods and takes her hand, forcing her to stop. </p>
  <p>"I don't know how much you know about dreams, Hermione. I know you're not very keen on divination and the likes of it. But if you're having one recurring dream night after night, that definitely means something. It's part of your mind and soul, and therefore your magic."</p>
  <p>Hermione swallows, trying to silence all arguments against such unscientific theories. That's what's scaring her, as well. She can feel it in her bones, how the dreams connect with everything that she is. They're not just random Muggle versions of dreams. It's magic. But why and how and what does it mean? </p>
  <p>"What should I do?" </p>
  <p>"Hmmm." Ginny is silent for a while and then resumes the walk about the garden. </p>
  <p>"My mum always said to not be afraid of them. And if I have conscious will in them, dare to explore them. So you can understand why they're happening and what they're trying to tell you." </p>
  <p>"You mean... I should... take action... in my dream?" Hermione frowns, feeling out of her depth. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Yes. If that's possible. Or if that doesn't work, try to see how it connects to your real life. Is there any way you can understand the dream and deal with it when you're awake, in your every day life?"</p>
  <p>Ginny stops once again, right outside the front door. "But I don't know, Hermione."</p>
  <p>Hermione nods. "No... Thanks, Ginny. That was helpful. I'll see what I come up with."</p>
  <p>Ginny smiles, sadly. "Is this why things have been so weird with Ron lately?"</p>
  <p>Hermione's cheeks turn pink and she can feel the stress in her throat. "What do you mean? Has he been talking?"</p>
  <p>"Calm down, 'Mione. It's not a big thing. I think he's just worried. And... a little lonely. Maybe you should talk to him about this." </p>

  <p>For days, Hermione tries to gather the courage to talk to Ron, she really does, but something always stops her. A feeling that this is not what either she or he needs. Ron has nothing to do with the dream or those days at the Manor, it won't do well to involve him. They might be together, but this is her own problem. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>The dreams continue, and the lines underneath her eyes become more prominent. If anyone around her notices, they don't say anything. Hermione goes to work each day, the only place where some of her old fire returns, where she can feel like she's actually doing something good in the wake of this war. The moment she returns to her and Ron's flat, the energy drains from her. </p>

  <p>She makes a habit of going to the big wizard library in connection to Diagon Alley each Sunday, to research her dreaming patterns. She makes notes in a book where she also writes down the dates of the dreams and if there are changes in them. It's a scientic approach to it, she knows that, but it's the only thing she knows. She sits in one of the armchairs at the very back of the big library, next to a window overlooking a courtyard. </p>
</div><div>
<p></p><div><p>She reads and reads, about dreams and how to make them go away. All the books on the topic say things simliar to Ginny's advice: you need to dare to explore the fear and the dream itself. Dare.</p></div><div><p>Hermione wonders if the war managed to suffocate any traces of bravery within her. She doesn't dare talk to Ron, she doesn't dare go to sleep, she doesn't dare explore anything that has to do with the dreams and the torture in them. </p><p>Bellatrix's laugher rings in her ears, and she closes her eyes.</p></div><div><p> </p></div><div><p> </p></div></div><div>

  <p><br/>
One day, she sees a mane of blonde hair in-between the shelves. For a moment, her mind flashes backwards into her memories, down to the basement and the blue eyes. Could it be? But... what are the odds? Her body shudders, but it also <em>wakes up. </em>She stands up quickly and hurries down the narrow path in between the shelves. </p>
  <p>"Wait!" she says, and turns the corner. Long blonde hair, high heels, elegant purple robes... It is her. But she doesn't stop and Hermione doesn't know what to do, just knows she has to get more than a glimpse. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Please." The library is so very silent and her voice easily travels across the space toward Mrs Malfoy.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Mrs Malfoy stops and slowly, slowly turns around.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Her face is a blank mask, a beautiful blank mask, surrounded by silken hair. </p>
  <p>Hermione reminds herself to breathe and that it is indeed in order to say something. </p>
  <p>"Could you..." Hermione takes a few steps forward and Mrs Malfoy watches her wearily. "Could you please... just... wait." </p>
  <p>Mrs Malfoy does not move, does not say anything, until Hermione has come closer. But Hermione doesn't know what to say, just knows that she needs someone who actually shares these memories, albeit from an entire other point of view, position, life, feeling, belief... but still, simply... a memory shared. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"The war," Hermione manages to mumble and feels her cheeks heating up, heart pounding. Her body is responding, finally filled with energy after months of sleeplessness and hopelessness. </p>
  <p>Mrs Malfoy's voice is soft, "What about it, Ms Granger?" </p>
  <p>"I... It's still inside my body." Hermione knows she sounds pretty crazy and pretty unlike herself, but it's the only way she can explain it. </p>
  <p>"Hmmm. Yes. That's understandable." There's no empathy, no feeling, apart from a flicker of recognition. </p>
  <p>"I can't seem to... let it go." </p>
  <p>"And that's my problem, how?" Hostility and venom and beautiful, blue eyes.</p>
  <p>"I just..." Hermione is at loss for words and when nothing escapes her lips, Mrs Malfoy gives her a harsh look before turning around. She starts walking, high heels against the wooden floors. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Hermione's eyes close. The library is eerily quiet.</p>
  <p>"I keep seeing you."</p>
  <p>Mrs Malfoy halts to a stop.</p>
  <p>"I keep seeing you in my dreams," Hermione continues and the desperation keeps pushing her forward, "why is that? You and your sister. The blood. The curses. The smell in the basement. And... you... your hand... on my cheek. Gentle. Please... Explain to me." Mrs Malfoy turns around and Hermione walks up to her, all the way up, so that they're actually within conversational distance of each other.</p>
  <p>Hermione continues: "I've been going over this in my head for months. How is it that during the day, when I'm awake, living, alive... I feel nothing. But in a fucking dream that can't seem to leave me alone, you simply put your hand... right here..." Hermione puts her own hand on her cheek, "and... I feel.. calm. Grounded... Or I don't even know. At least I feel something. And then, I wake up." </p>
  <p>Mrs Malfoy is frowning. </p>
  <p>"Why did you have to do that? Or rather, how could you? For hours on end you witnessed my torture. You stayed silent, and your eyes were so... mean. But then in the basement, you... turned soft. And I witnessed that. I know I was out of it pretty much my entire time down there... but still. You became soft..."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>The softness echoed through the flesh. The softness was amplified a hundred times over in the silence that was the cruelty. </p>
  <p>Mrs Malfoy looks so very uncomfortable. Closes her eyes, lets out a breath. </p>
  <p>"Ms Granger." She doesn't say anything, doesn't open her eyes. After twenty seconds or so she finally opens her eyes, and they're glassy. Her voice is a whisper.</p>
  <p>"I am so very sorry. I won't ask you to forgive me. But I am sorry."</p>
  <p>Hermione doesn't know what to say, and after a few seconds Mrs Malfoy turns around, and walks away.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>That night, the dreams change. She is lying on the floor of the basement, but no one comes. There's no light, no feeling, nothing. Just an empty basement and an aching body with wounds scattered across it. Blood.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>This, ironically, awakens something in her. Some kind of memory of being a person with endless curiosity. She used to want to learn things, want to understand things, but since the war all she's wanted to do is forget. Now, there's a simmer underneath the surface, a sign of life. She breathes out a sigh, grateful for a flicker of something she thought was lost. </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>A week later, Ron's voice becomes soft and small, as they lie in bed. </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Do you even like me anymore?" He sounds heartbroken, and she swallows down the fear.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Of course, Ron. I love you, you know that."</p>
  <p>"Yes. I know you love me. But do you <em>like </em>me? I honestly don't know what... what to feel anymore."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Hermione starts crying, turning around to embrace him. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"I don't know what's wrong with me, Ron. I keep having these nightmares and they're so exhausting. Ever since the war ended, I just feel like my body is slowly giving in to... in to..." She can't talk about it. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Ron tightens him embrace. "It's okay, my love. We'll get through this. I know we will."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>She tries to believe him, and for the first time in months they fall asleep intertwined, and she dreams, of course, but only for a tiny bit of a moment. </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Two weeks later, it's Sunday, and she's in the library again, poring over her notes, trying to find some kind of pattern, something to latch onto. There isn't. Just as the exhaustion and frustration are about to fill her to the brink, a clicking sound reaches her ears. Heels against wood. It can't be...?</p>
</div><div>
  <p><br/>
Narcissa Malfoy rounds the corner and when the soft sunlight through the window reaches her face, Hermione's mouth falls open. Mrs Malfoy's eyes are harsh blue orbs. She walks all the way to Hermione's table.</p>
</div><div>
  <p><br/>
"Hello. Mind if I join you?" Her voice is smooth and cool.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Hermione nods, feeling the adrenaline rush through her. Mrs Malfoy takes a seat opposite of her, sitting with a very straight spine.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"The dreams you mentioned. Are they still happening?</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Hermione nods again.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"What exactly is it you dream?" </p>
  <p>Hermione's mind, which had stopped to a halt, starts moving again, "Well. They're always a version of the same event. Your sister. Blood. Pain. Screams... and then, waking up in the basement to the sight of you. Leaning down. Giving me water and then... touching my face."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Mrs Malfoy nods, seemingly unaffected by Hermione's retelling. </p>
  <p>"How do you feel when you wake up?"</p>
  <p>"Like I want to jump out of my own skin. Every single morning. It's exhausting." </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Mrs Malfoy nods again, but doesn't say anything. </p>
  <p>Hermione pushes, "What do they mean? How do I make them stop?"</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"It's pretty obvious, don't you think?" For some reason Mrs Malfoy's voice isn't quite as sharp as before, "you need to work through the trauma of that event."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Hermione tsks frustratedly, "I'm not stupid. I know that. But <em>how?" </em></p>
</div><div>
  <p>At this, Mrs Malfoy's eyes become even bluer, lovelier, "If only I knew how." </p>
</div><div>
  <p>They stay silent for a minute, and Mrs Malfoy is truly quite beautiful in the afternoon sun. The sun lends her the warmth her countenance lacks. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"I thought I was going to die," Hermione begins, and she doesn't really know where the words are coming from. Mrs Malfoy's eyes are alert. "And that's not special, not when one's been in a war, and I've been close to death more times than I can count. But there was something so incredibly frightening about being trapped in that manor. Surrounded by so many people that wanted to do me harm. Me, bound with ropes, trapped, hexed and beaten and cut. I just... I can't shake that deep fear... that... feeling. You know?" Mrs Malfoy's eyes are so very focused on Hermione's face. Hermione swallows and continues: "I think... it was the fact that I'd been so brutally beaten and cut for so many many hours that... when you touched me like that, it just... magnified. The touch magnified and I honestly think some part of my... magic or something latched onto it. That touch. And I had never thought you of all people would look at me like that, with... softness. I didn't think you had it in you, to be honest." </p>
  <p>Mrs Malfoy's face looks guarded but not entirely hostile. She's silent for a minute before answering:</p>
  <p>"I didn't think... I didn't think I'd feel any pity toward you. I didn't think I'd feel anything at all. But then after so many hours with Bellatrix and her absolute madness, I... couldn't help myself. You were lying there on the floor, so very helpless and... I became so tired."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Hermione has no idea what that means but nods anyways.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"I just wish I could forget it." </p>
  <p>"As do I."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>They sit in silence, having reached a strange acceptance. </p>
</div>
  </div>
