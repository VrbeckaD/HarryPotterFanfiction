    <p>Astrid was exhausted. She leaned against the locked bathroom door, and slid to the ground. Everything was too loud, too much. The shouting, the shattering of glass, and finally, the stomping up the stairs. She was too tired to hide, too tired to put up a fight again. He almost never came upstairs, and when he did it was never good. </p><p>It soon felt like the whole house was shaking, and she squeezed her eyes shut. Was that her heart pounding in her ears? His fist slamming against the door? Was she trembling in fear, or was the whole world coming to an end? But the shaking stopped, and the rumbling silenced. And the whole house was still. </p><p>She opened her eyes to see the bathroom far different than how she’d seen it last. The mirror was shattered, and the shower rod had fallen. Astrid hesitated to open the door, but she just had to move. The man, Rick, was nowhere to be seen, so she continued to the stairs. The living room had fared worse than the rest of the house. The TV had fallen over, and her mother’s china cabinets were destroyed. The chandelier had crashed to the floor. </p><p>“Astrid?”</p><p>“Jack?” Astrid tread lightly over the glass and into the kitchen. Her brother, Jackson, was standing just inside the door to the garage. “You okay?” </p><p>He nodded. “You?” </p><p>“Yeah. Where is everyone? When did you get home?”</p><p>“I got here ten minutes ago. Mom and Rick were in the living room, I thought.”<br/> “I thought so, too. Should we report them missing?”</p><p>Astrid was reaching for her phone when she heard another crashing noise from the living room.</p><p>“Hello? Anybody home?” A woman’s voice shouted. </p><p>“No one’s going to answer that,” a man replied. “Not since you already alerted the whole neighborhood by knocking down the door.”</p><p>Astrid picked up a leg from the collapsed dining room table and crept up to the wall separating her from the living room. She peered around the corner, peering through the dust. The woman in the doorway was wearing a long cloak, and had a shock of pink hair. The man was wearing a shabbier version of the same cloak, over a collared shirt and tie. </p><p><em> They’ve gotta be crazy, </em> Astrid thought <em> . </em>She turned and was about to tell Jackson to sneak out the backdoor and run like hell, when she bumped into something. Someone. </p><p>Astrid swung around, narrowly missing the large man’s nose with her table-leg sword. Before she could her bearings, he grabbed her by the collar and held her against the wall. He was brandishing a much smaller stick, no match for Astrid’s. </p><p>“Ah ha! What do we have here? Caught at the scene of the cr- OUCH!” Astrid swung her club as hard and she could into his side, and he dropped her unceremoniously. Jackson shoved the man down and they ran into the other room.</p><p>The two strangers now had drawn weapons of their own- wooden sticks similar to the other man’s. Astrid still brandished her club, but was much less confident against the two. </p><p>“Who are you?” The woman asked, pointing her stick at Astrid. </p><p>“Why should I tell you?” She said warily. </p><p>“We can help you, if you tell us,” the man in the shabby cloak said, lowering his weapon. At no reply, he spoke again. “My name is Remus Lupin. We’re here because this house was attacked. We were told that there were no survivors, and we needed to investigate.” </p><p>“Attacked?” Jackson asked. He had nothing to defend himself with, but had taken to watching their backs. “There was an earthquake.”</p><p>“I understand that this is confusing for you two. We just want to help, if you tell us your names.” Astrid tightened her grip as the man took a step forward. There was scuffling from behind her, and Jackson grabbed her wrist. </p><p>“Call off your fucking attack dog!” Jackson hissed. Astrid glanced behind her, and the man who had attacked her had recovered. He was big, and had a scarred, grizzled face. To top it off, he was missing a chunk of his nose and wore an eye patch. </p><p>“Hey, he’s a renowned auror! Show some respect!” The woman retorted.</p><p>While the man didn’t rear on them again, he glared as he passed them, and never lowered his weapon. “Never let yer guard down! They could be Death Eaters!”</p><p><em> This is getting out of hand, </em> Astrid thought. <em> Remus Lupin? Death Eaters? </em> </p><p>“<em> Revelio! </em>” The man shouted. Astrid immediately felt like a bucket of ice water was dumped over her head. </p><p>“Alastor, they’re kids! They’re not Death Eaters!” Remus said tiredly. The man, <em> Alastor </em>, argued again, but the woman interrupted. </p><p>“Don’t mind him, he’s being paranoid!” She waved him off lazily. “The name’s Tonks. That’s Mad-Eye.”</p><p>“You guys are crazy,” Jackson said. </p><p>“Maybe they’re Muggles?” Tonks asked Remus. </p><p>“No, then how did they survive? This has to be them,” he said.</p><p>“Muggles! Okay, that’s enough!” Astrid reached into her back pocket for her phone, but it wouldn’t even turn on. “You guys are <em> insane! </em> God, when did this all happen, 1996?”</p><p>“It’s 1995,” Remus said, and Astrid rolled her eyes. “Look, I know we have a lot of explaining to do, and it sounds crazy, but please, let us help you.”</p><p>Astrid glanced at her brother, then the kitchen, and back again. Jackson nodded, but it probably looked more like a twitch it was so small. Without turning back to the intruders, she chucked her weapon at them and sprinted after Jackson into the kitchen and into the garage.</p><p>Jackson hit the button to open the door one, two, three times. Each time harder than the last, but it wouldn’t work. </p><p>“Come on, god damn it!” He hit it one more time for good measure, before giving up. He picked up the baseball bat that had been leaning against the wall just as the door opened. </p><p>“<em> Expelliarmus!” </em> Jackson’s weapon flew out of his hands like it was nothing. Astrid was starting to panic- <em> this shouldn’t be happening!  </em></p><p>“Wait! We’re not trying to hurt you!” A man’s voice shouted. Probably Remus, if Astrid had to guess. But she didn’t <em> care. </em> This was <em> crazy </em>. </p><p>She set her shoulders, fully prepared to take on these people with her fists, but Jackson hesitated</p><p>“What if they’re telling the truth?” He asked. Astrid looked into the doorway again. Remus and Tonks had their wands lowered. Astrid nodded. </p><p>“Okay, we surrender,” she said. Mad-Eye still did not let down his guard. </p><p>“C’mon, Mad-Eye, they’re not going to fight us. They’re just kids,” Tonks said. </p><p>  “Why are you here?” Jackson breathed. The twins were both still reeling from their run. </p><p>“Your house has been attacked-”</p><p>“Yeah, thanks,” Astrid snarled. </p><p>“Oh, she’s funny!” Tonks said sassily with a grin. </p><p>“-By Death Eaters, I mean,” Remus explained. “We were told by the Ministry that there were no survivors, but we had reason to believe otherwise. We’re here to help you.” </p><p>Astrid’s mind was buzzing. This wasn’t possible. At first she thought it was all a coincidence- the names and the talk about Muggles. But the disarming charm had worked. And Remus had said it was 1995…</p><p>“Help us how?” Jackson asked. </p><p>“We have a place for you to stay. Hopefully we can get you two up to speed- and since you’ve been attacked, our goal is to keep you guys safe.”</p><p>“And our parents?” Jackson asked finally. </p><p>Remus frowned at him. “I- I’m sorry. The Ministry said there were no survivors… A man and a woman were found just outside. It doesn’t seem like they were in any pain, but…”</p><p>They nodded solemnly. </p><p>“Come on,” Remus said, leading the group back out of the garage and out the front door. </p><p>There were two bodies, looking unharmed, lying in the grass. For once, they weren't shouting or throwing things. In fact, they could almost be napping.</p><p>"I'm sorry Jackson, Astrid. There was nothing we could do," Remus said quietly. </p><p>Neither were particularly emotional about their parent’s death. Rick wasn’t even their dad, and it wasn’t like he loved them anyways. And their mom- she hadn’t really been around in a while. </p><p>"I'm so sorry about your parents. We can offer you guys a place to stay, for now," Tonks offered. Astrid thought for a moment before agreeing. Normally, she would not be inclined to move in with strangers , but there were no other options.</p><p>"Thank you. Just for a few days, don't want to intrude...," Astrid said, running on autopilot. "Someone 'll take us for work, I'm sure. All right, Elliott?" She turned to him, and he nodded, not meeting anyone's eyes.</p><p>“We’ll sort something out. In the meantime, our rides are here!” Tonks said gleefully. She gestured to the five broomsticks that were laid out on the sidewalk. Astrid’s mind was still reeling- they were going to fly? She turned to Jackson, who was already standing next to his broom. He glanced up and smiled at her. He was always better under pressure, anyways.</p><p>“Up!” He said, and the broomstick flew up into his hand. He grinned at her again. “Alright, you’re turn.”</p><p>“Up!” Sure enough, the handle snapped into her palm. Like magic. “This is insane,” she whispered. </p><p>“Oh, for sure, dude,” he whispered back. “Do we have any other options?” Astrid shook her head. </p><p>Mad-Eye nodded approvingly. "That sorts it. Okay, follow Tonks, and I'll take the rear. Maybe we can double back, go a little off North so we are not being followed. Even th-"</p><p>"Mad-Eye! It's December! We are going straight there, or we will never make it!" Tonks shouted. “We’ll, let’s make sure you two can fly straight.” </p><p>Astrid kicked off as hard as she could, and she wobbled for a few moments as she pitched forward, but she regained her balance. Jackson soared up next to her. </p><p>Soon, they were moving so fast it was too windy for conversation. </p><p>Now Astrid had time to think. <em> Twenty-four years. With magic and Death Eaters and broomsticks. And what ever Mad-Eye Moody packed in their suitcase. </em> Astrid blinked a few times, just to be sure she wasn’t dreaming, or having a nightmare. <em> We’re fucked.  </em></p><p>When they touched down, it was in a gloomy neighborhood, with no streetlights. This was a blessing and a curse. They weren't seen, but Astrid almost tumbled when she touched down, stubbing her toe hard on the curb.</p><p>Tonks wasted no time in showing Astrid and Jackson the slip of paper with the address. '<em> Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place </em>,' in tall, loopy letters. As they read it, the house appeared on the street.</p><p>After two knocks at the door, a dim entry way greeted them. But, surprisingly, the house smelled of pine and cranberries. And underneath it, what could only be described as cleaning chemicals and mold.</p><p>There was loud caroling coming down from the decorated staircase, and the man singing them only stopped when he saw the new arrivals.</p><p>"'Sup?" Jackson said, although barely containing his excitement. Astrid stamped on his foot with her boot. "Ow, Az!"</p><p>"Hello," she said politely. The man glanced between the two. He had sallow skin, and long, unkempt hair, just as she had imagined.</p><p>"I thought the Ministry said there were no survivors," he said, squinting at Astrid and Jackson. He only looked at Remus when he spoke up.</p><p>“They did, but we had reason to believe there were. And they needed a place to stay,” Remus said, and looked at Sirius with a knowing stare. Sirius frowned and nodded. </p><p>“Well, you can stay as long as you’d like. I’m Sirius, and you?”</p><p>“Jackson, and this is Astrid.”</p><p>“I’m sure there’s a gaggle of teenagers somewhere who are willing to show you around. And dinner is just about done, as well,” he said, and started into the kitchen. </p><p>“Go ahead, take Lo and get something to eat. I’ll be there in a second,” Astrid mumbled. Astrid just needed to think. “Remus, sorry, where’s a bathroom?” </p><p>“Upstairs, first door on the left.” </p><p>She nodded and hurried up the stairs, not looking up and hoping to avoid anyone. Astrid had made it to the landing without interruption, and shut the door to the bathroom. It was dark and didn’t smell perfect, but it was much quieter than the rest of the house. </p><p><em> I really need to talk to Jackson </em> , she thought, leaning against the door. <em> Surely, there must be a reason we’re here. Lives to save, something to change? Maybe something went wrong… </em> To think, everyone she’s met today ends up dead before the end of the series. One of them in, what, six months? She took a deep breath and stood up. She shouldn’t leave Jackson to his own devices for too long, anyways. </p><p>She’d just stepped out onto the landing when she was shoved into the wall for the second time that day, wand at her neck.</p><p>"<em> Who are you and how did you get in?" </em> He demanded, green eyes boring into Astrid's. For a split second, she took in the messy black hair, lightning scar, and the glasses, and she was sure he was doing the same to her. Astrid was about to shove him off when the boy fell to the floor. </p><p>"Dude! Why do you all keep doing that!" Jackson snapped, flexing his hand. The boy on the carpet was holding his ribs. “Next time someone tries to hurt my sister, it’ll be worse!”</p><p>“That’s a lot, Jack. I had it,” Astrid said tiredly. Before he could retort, two other teens came downstairs and stood next to the first. They all had their wands drawn</p><p>“Who are you?” The dark-haired girl asked. </p><p>“Who are you?” Astrid remarked. She already knew who all three of these people were, if she had to guess. </p><p>"We asked you first, plus, we live here, so tell us!" The other boy demanded. He was taller than the other two, with a shock of ginger hair.</p><p>"I'm Jackson, and this is Astrid. Sorry for surprising you guys like this,” he said. </p><p>"I'm Hermione, and this is Harry, and Ron," the girl said, gesturing to the bespectacled and ginger haired boys respectively. "Not to be rude, but why are you guys here?"</p><p>"Ah, Death Eater attack. Tonks, Remus, and M-Mad-eye, is that what you all call him? They brought us here," Astrid explained, not going into detail. The trio finally put their wands down, and the two sighed in relief.</p><p>“Oh, I’m sorry to hear that,” Hermione said sincerely. “And I’m sorry on Harry’s behalf that he attacked you out of nowhere,” she scolded, and flicked Harry in the forehead. </p><p>"Yeah, yeah, all right. I am sorry," Harry admitted, rubbing his face. Hermione smiled at them, and scooted around them to go to dinner. </p><p>
  <em> CRACK </em>
</p><p>"I heard there were twins in the house!"</p><p>"Did you know, there's a law that says if two sets of twins are in the same place, they have to fight to the death?"</p><p>Jackson and Astrid nearly jumped out of their skins at the Apparition of whom they could only guess were the Weasley twins.</p><p>"<em> Jesus fucking Christ </em>," Jackson said loudly, and Astrid was just trying to make sure she didn't topple down the stairs.</p><p>"Oh, yeah, you guys look like twins," Ron said scratching is chin. "Why didn't you tell us?"</p><p>"Didn't come up," Jackson wheezed..</p><p>"I'm Fred, and this is George! Pleased to meet you both!" One twin (Astrid was unsure if it really <em> was </em>Fred) said, and they alternated shaking their hands.</p><p>"Astrid."</p><p>"Jackson.” </p><p>Astrid sighed tiredly. This day could not get any longer. </p><p>"DINNER!" They looked down the stairs to see who the Potter Twins could only assume to be Mrs. Weasley yelling up at them. The teenagers raced down the stairs, with the new kids in tow.</p><p>"Ah, Astrid, dear, and Jackson. It is so nice to meet you," Mrs. Weasley said with a warm smile. "I am Mrs. Weasley, but you can both call me Molly." She gave them both bone-crushing hugs and led them to the table.</p><p>"Thank you Mrs. Weasley, for the place to stay and for dinner," Astrid said politely, taking a seat beside Hermione. Jackson nodded along, looking eagerly at the plates of food in front of him.</p><p>"Oh, of course, you're always welcome."</p><p>"So, Astrid, Jackson, you said you'd only stay a few days, are your parents coming to get you soon?" Fred asked, piling mashed potatoes high on his plate.</p><p>Seeing as Jackson already was chewing more than he could swallow, Astrid answered for the both of them. "Oh, um, no. They both died in the attack," she mumbled and passed the salad to the next person.</p><p>"Oh goodness, I'm sorry to hear that. Will you guys be coming to school with us, then?" Hermione said, placing a reassuring hand on Astrid's shoulder before continuing.</p><p>"Oh, no, we can't afford to, we ha-"</p><p>"Sure, why not!" Jackson said and kicking Astrid under the table. She glared at him, and he gave her a look that said <em> we'll talk about this later </em>.</p><p>"Excellent! We're desperately low on Quidditch players, do you think we could teach you?" Ron, turned excitedly towards Jackson. Astrid, who'd been curious, at least, coughed loudly. "Oh, yeah, there's two spots, if you're interested."</p><p>"Not that I couldn't kick Jackson's ass at anything," <em> (Language, Astrid!) </em>, "I'm good. I just wanted to be considered," Astrid said coyly. Ron flushed red, and Hermione laughed behind her hand.</p><p>"Could help overhear- my name is Ginny. I say you try out. Those boys don't seem to consider us any good until we prove it to them." A red-haired girl shoved Ron's chair over to shake Astrid's hand.</p><p>"Nice to meet you, Ginny. And I appreciate the enthusiasm,” she said with a wink. </p><p>The meal truly was delicious. It wasn't often that Jackson and Astrid had home-cooked meals, and when they did, they usually made them. They were both stuffed when Mrs. Weasley said it was time for bed.</p><p>"I hope you kids don't mind sharing a room; I'm afraid the only one left is quite small, but it is clean!" Mrs. Weasley led the newcomers up the stairs into a guest room, and it reminded them of all the Dark artifacts and creatures that lurked in the house.</p><p>"Sick, this stuff is cool," Jackson said, picking up a large, dusty book.</p><p>"So," Astrid whispered. "How do you plan on telling them we can't go to school, Jack?"</p><p>"What do you mean?" Jackson said, not looking up from the cover.</p><p>"Where do you think we're gonna get money from? Books? Robes? Anything?" Astrid interrogated, collapsing on the bed. </p><p>"Surely there Mom and Rick left something for us. And I doubt Hogwarts just denies students because they have no money.”</p><p>"That's a lot of maybes. Also, now that I think about it, school’s not our biggest concern. Our biggest concern is <em> what the fuck is happening </em>," She hissed at him, hoping to get him to pay attention.</p><p>"I mean, I don't know. Maybe Albus Dumbledore himself is gonna explain this all to us," Jackson shrugged.</p><p>"Jack, I am worried you're not taking this seriously."</p><p>"Well, I'm worried you're taking it <em> too </em> seriously," he quipped.</p><p>"Our parents are dead, Jackson. At least look at me and tell me I'm not dead or going crazy," Astrid said, pinching her wrist. Jackson sat on the bed next to her, putting down his book.</p><p>"Astrid, you're not dead or crazy. And everything will turn out. Anyway, we kinda hated mom and Rick, so I'm not that mad about it," he said, bumping her shoulder.</p><p>"You're an idiot."</p><p>"You love me."</p><p>"Eh."</p>
