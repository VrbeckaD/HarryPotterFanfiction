    <p>Bill paced in the lounge of Hermione’s flat, his hands shoved deep in the pockets of his dress robes so he wouldn’t be tempted to run them through his hair. He hadn’t done much with it, but for once it was neatly styled and hanging loose, free of the leather thong he usually used to hold it back. He shouldn’t be nervous - or, rather, he shouldn’t be outwardly nervous. By all accounts, he was doing a dear friend a favor, nothing more. But as the door at the end of the hallway opened and Hermione stepped out, practically glowing in a burgundy ball gown, the bodice covered in black sequins, he had to admit he’d gotten in over his head. Her hair had been twisted up, leaving only a few curls to bounce tantalizingly over her bare shoulders, and Bill found himself quite without words.</p>
<p>“Don’t you look dashing,” she said as she approached him, the click-clack of her heels on the tile setting the pace for his heart. </p>
<p>He took one hand out of a pocket and smoothed it down the center of his chest, flattening non-existent wrinkles. The robes were new, commissioned for the occasion, and had cost him a shiny knut. But Hermione… the usually beautiful witch had been transformed into a goddess. Whatever she’d paid for the dress, the seamstress deserved more. If only his famously glib tongue hadn’t deserted him, he’d be able to tell her. He’d charmed a Veela into marriage, for Merlin’s sake, regardless of how short-lived it’d been, but he couldn’t tell the woman who was his best friend how beautiful she looked. Because he was desperately in love with her. </p>
<p>She smiled, pleased and shy all at once, her ruby red lips parting slowly and ending with the inside of her bottom lip caught between her straight white teeth. Her reaction caused Bill to wonder if he’d spoken any of that aloud, but no, if he’d opened his mouth it was only to gape at her.</p>
<p>“You look beautiful, Hermione,” he finally managed. “Just beautiful.”</p>
<p>Was he imagining things or was that a hint of a blush on her cheeks? “Thank you, Bill.”</p>
<p>“Shall we?” he asked, offering her his elbow.</p>
<p>“Such a gentlewizard,” she teased, taking it.</p>
<p>Clearing his head of her floral perfume and of thoughts about how, despite her heels, he was still easily six inches taller than her, granting him an unrestricted view down the bodice of her dress, he focused on their destination. They apparated into the Ministry a second later and walked down to the ballroom where the celebration was to be held.</p>
<p>It was the fifth anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts, and frankly, the years had flown by. It was also the first time the lead-up to the anniversary had felt like a celebration instead of a memorial. Bill had been invited, of course - all of the Weasleys were - but Hermione’s attendance was rather more <i>required</i>, and she needed to have a date. Unfortunately, it was a frequent complaint from her that being ‘one-third of the Golden Trio’ tended to intimidate wizards, and those who managed to make it past her celebrity status never seemed to measure up to whatever standards she set long enough to be considered a ‘boyfriend’. He couldn’t remember the last time a wizard had made it past a third date.</p>
<p>When she’d looked up at him from her position on his sofa two weeks ago, her brown eyes boring into him, and suggested they go together, he couldn’t tell her no. So, here he was, grateful the majority of wizardkind were either blind or cowards if it meant he got to have Hermione Granger on his arm, even though he was secretly one of the cowards. </p>
<p>It wasn’t any of that Golden Trio nonsense which held his tongue. His divorce was two years in his past, and had been surprisingly amicable, so it wasn’t that he was still hung up on his ex-wife. Hermione’s relationship with his younger brother - if it could even be called that - had fizzled out only a few weeks after the Battle. Ron had since moved on with various witches of the week, so there was very little concern about what he would say. It seemed cliché that Bill was worried about how a romantic relationship would affect their friendship, but that was a huge part of it. Combined with fears that he wouldn’t measure up and that she didn’t return his interest in the first place meant Bill had been stuck in limbo for over a year.</p>
<p>They mingled, champagne glasses in hand. It was no surprise Hermione seemed to know everyone. Aside from an occasional touch to her lower back to guide her through the crowds or to get her attention, Bill kept his hands mostly to himself, avoiding the curious looks from those who didn’t know them quite as well when he moved from group to group at her side. She saved him from certain embarrassment when dinner was announced and he found himself approaching a table near the front of the room with Ginny, Harry, Ron, and Ron’s current arm candy, whose name Bill had not even registered when she’d been introduced at Sunday dinner the week previous. None of them ever seemed to stick around, so why bother to remember their names?</p>
<p>“Rachel,” Hermione said, leaning in to kiss the younger woman on the cheek, “good to see you again. How are you?”</p>
<p>No one seemed to notice Bill’s sigh of relief over Rachel’s answer. Everyone sat and a few hectic moments followed of waiters bringing out the food. Eventually they fell into comfortable conversation as they ate.</p>
<p>“So, Bill,” Ginny said sometime during the soup course, “not tired of your desk yet?”</p>
<p>Hermione paused, her spoon only an inch away from dipping into the tomato bisque. After the last field position he’d taken, which had been mostly an opportunity to step away from London for a few months so he could clear his head after his divorce, Bill had been quite content inside the Diagon Alley branch of Gringotts. A lot of that had to do with the witch sitting on his right. She never really brought it up, so he hadn’t bothered to mention to her that he’d turned down several assignments in the interim.</p>
<p>He chuckled at his sister’s obvious distaste for a sedentary lifestyle. “No, not yet. There is something brewing at the site in Egypt, though. The goblins are saying they may need me back out there.”</p>
<p>“When would you leave?” Hermione asked quietly, placing her spoon delicately back on the table.</p>
<p>Bill’s heart stuttered at the slight hurt in her tone. He hadn’t mentioned it because it wasn’t definite yet. Even if the chamber the team was currently studying actually did contain a hidden door which lead into another, previously undiscovered, part of the pyramid, there was no guarantee his expertise would be needed to explore it. “They should know something within the month. I would leave shortly after.”</p>
<p>She nodded and Ron picked up the conversation, explaining to Rachel about Bill’s cursebreaking job. Bill listened with half an ear, far more concerned about Hermione’s reaction to him potentially leaving. A waiter passed by a few minutes later and she allowed him to take her bowl away. She hadn’t taken another bite and remained subdued through the rest of the meal. </p>
<p>Kingsley got up as pudding was being served and made a short speech then announced that dancing would begin once the tables were cleared. This pageantry was the reason Hermione was required to have a date. Kingsley led his wife into the middle of the room, followed by several high-ranking members of the Ministry as well as the Golden Trio and their dates to lead off the dancing.</p>
<p>“Are you alright?” Bill asked once he was certain the music would cover their conversation.</p>
<p>“Why didn’t you tell me you were leaving?” she deflected, directing the question at the center of his chest.</p>
<p>“Because I’m not sure it’s going to happen. There are a lot of ‘ifs’ between here and a portkey to Cairo.”</p>
<p>“How long would you be gone?”</p>
<p>“As long as it takes.”</p>
<p>She seemed to deflate a bit further. “Do you miss it?”</p>
<p>“I miss the challenge. I don’t miss being away from everyone.” <i>From you.</i></p>
<p>The song moved seamlessly into another, and Bill found himself dancing with Ginny instead when Harry cut in with Hermione. It went on like that for what seemed like hours, his father and each of his brothers taking a turn - even Fred, the limp he lived with since the Battle making him the least graceful of the bunch, but he managed what none of the others had, to pull a genuine smile from her. Bill was making his way back to Hermione when Kingsley took her hand from George and the whole process started over again with members of the Ministry and the Wizengamot. </p>
<p>“Go get her,” Harry said after finding Bill at the bar several drinks later. “She doesn’t want to be here and the two of you need to talk.”</p>
<p>Bill found her easily in the crowd. Even if the dress hadn’t been a beacon, <i>she</i> was. He didn’t know the name of the minister she was dancing with, but he could see another waiting to take his place as soon as the song ended. He placed his glass on the bar.</p>
<p>Stalking through the crowd, Bill scowled at the waiting minister, taking full advantage of his scarred face to get the other man to back off. When the next song started, Bill was there, taking her hand and pulling her close, his heart sinking when she didn’t look at him.</p>
<p>"I don't know this one," he said when the lyrics started.</p>
<p>Hermione’s head jerked up and he wondered if she’d known before that moment who she was dancing with. "It's a muggle song.”</p>
<p>"It's nice." </p>
<p>“Yeah. It’s been around for years. It’s popular.”</p>
<p>The lyrics were distressingly accurate. A man sang about a beautiful woman in a red dress that every man wanted to dance with, and how his own dance with her was exactly where he wanted to be. Maybe Bill had been just as blind as the singer claimed to be, in addition to the coward he’d already branded himself. He was completely and utterly in love with her, yet he’d spent most of the evening too afraid to ask why her mood had so obviously shifted when he’d mentioned returning to Egypt. Was she simply sad her friend would be away for a time, annoyed he hadn’t mentioned it, or was it something more?</p>
<p>Harry was right. They did need to talk.</p>
<p>“Hermione… can we go somewhere else? I’d like a moment away from all of this.”</p>
<p>When she agreed, he took her hand and led her from the dance floor just as the last line of the song whispered through the room: <i>I love you…</i></p>
