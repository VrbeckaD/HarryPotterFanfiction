</p><p>            I know I haven’t written in a diary since I was eleven, and that time it tried to kill me, but, hell, we’re all in mortal peril now according to Mum’s clock so why not write my most intimate thoughts and feelings into a book again. I’m pretty sure this is a safe one, too, because it’s an extra one Hermione bought at a muggle shop and left here last summer. I don’t think she will care if I use it and I don’t even think she will remember she left it here.</p><p>            It’s been a month since I’ve seen him and a month since he called it quits with us. I can’t get my mind off of him. I know he’s been safe because I would have heard if he wasn’t but I just haven’t gotten myself to send him a letter. I don’t even know what I’d say. <em>Dear Harry, just wanted to let you know that I don’t think we are over yet and I miss you like fucking crazy, can’t get my mind off of you. By the way my mind wanders to you and your body every time I let it. Just yesterday I was feeding the chickens and let my mind wander to that time you fingered me under the tree by the lake and I replay how good your fingers felt inside of me, and then I realize that I’m in my wellies surrounded by chicken shit and my cunt has become so wet that I think I will definitely need to change my panties for the third time today because oh god whenever I think of you my heart skips a beat and my pussy starts dripping… Love, Ginny.</em> That’s a perfectly normal letter, right?</p><p>            He’s supposed to come home tonight. I’m so fucking scared. Almost everyone I love are risking their lives to get him here safe. I need to distract myself, because even if he does by some miracle get here safe, what about Dad or Ron or Bill or Fred or George? Mum’s been triple and quadruple scrubbing down the kitchen to prepare for the wedding, but I know it’s because she’s scared shitless. It’s been about an hour since they all left to get Harry and I don’t know how much more time I can take. I want to know what’s going on. I just want them all to be safe. For him to be safe.</p><p>            And if he does make it home I don’t even know what I’ll do with myself. I can hardly think of him without becoming so insatiably horny. I don’t know what I will do if it <em>is</em> him there. I know we’re technically broken up but I don’t believe it. He just has to save the world, is all. Which is so fucking scary. And so fucking hot. I can’t wait I can’t take it any longer.</p><p> </p><p>

</p><p>            I’ve been up all night I can’t get it out of my mind. When I first saw Harry I thought my heart would leap right out of my chest and a fire ignited that started in my belly and quickly spread right to my clit but I didn’t know just what to do. I couldn’t say anything then because Mum and Hagrid were there and we haven’t gotten time alone because only a few minutes later he was telling us about how he ran into You-Know-Who and then Dad came home with George who lost an ear and now Mad Eye is dead. Lupin gave us all Firewhiskey and since I hadn’t eaten all day and my mind was all crazy and screwed up from everything it just went straight to me. While no one was looking Fred topped off my glass another three or four or maybe five times. I don’t remember. We both needed it. He seemed okay after George got hurt and Mum cleaned him up but I saw when nobody was looking Fred would wordlessly refill his glass with his wand. He must have known that I was hurting too because he kept refilling mine whenever he did his. I don’t know what was going through his head, but I know he must be hurting. He puts on his goofy act all the time, but I can tell when something’s wrong. Maybe he sensed that and needed someone else to drink with. I know he never went up to bed last night because when I came downstairs this morning he was sleeping on the big armchair next to the couch George was on.</p><p>            And a few drinks in I couldn’t help but stare at Harry who was staring at the floor and not saying anything. I know he doesn’t want anyone hurt because of him and now Mad Eye and Hedwig are dead and George is hurt and who knows what will become of the rest of us in a few weeks or months. What if he doesn’t come back from his mission to save the world and I’m just the stupid girl who waited for him thinking he could get this done with safely?</p><p>            I know what I can do to make his time here worthwhile before he goes on his mission. I decided last night. He’ll be seventeen on Thursday and I still haven’t bought him a present, but then I realized why buy him a present when I could be present and his present? He needs a happy memory before he goes off hunting You-Know-Who and I need a happy memory too to keep me sane before he goes. I still have the potion from the apothecary hiding in the bottom of my school trunk that I was going to use with Dean but we never had the chance. Sure, we jerked each other off plenty of times and I’d blown him in the secret passages, but we never did it. And with Harry, there was never enough time. After the last Quidditch match we escaped to the grounds and snogged a bunch. He sucked my titties while I jerked him off but it was his first time anyone had done that to him and he barely lasted two minutes. And then there was the time he fingered me under the tree by the lake but every other time we were together Ron and Hermione were always around or there would be some stupid third years gossiping by the lake, too close for comfort. We never got to doing much at Hogwarts and I’m afraid if I don’t act now we will never do anything. It’ll be his birthday soon and he’ll know that we’re not over.</p><p> </p><p>

</p><p>            He told me after this it’s over and he tried to mean it but I know it’s not over it just can’t be over I’ll pretend it’s not over until we can continue and then we will be together and it’ll be okay. If it’s written down it’ll never be over because I can come back and read it again and again and it’ll be here forever and I won’t forget anything. When Mum and Dad were showing the Delacours around the backyard and the marquis and going over everything for the wedding I invited him to my room. I realized that he was the first boy other than my brothers to come into my room and we were about to do it on the bed I know I wet as a child but it was the perfect time.</p><p>            I told him that I didn’t have his birthday present and couldn’t think of what to get him, but wanted to give him a happy memory in case he ran into a beautiful veela when he was off saving the world. He looked so sexy when he smiled at me with that perfectly chiseled chin and looked deep into my eyes and laughed and said that he wouldn’t have time to date on his mission and before I would keep running my mouth out of sheer nerves I just went for it and started kissing him like mad. I used my teeth to bite at his lower lip the way I knew he loved so much, and all of a sudden his hands were all over my ass and he pulled me in close to him and I could feel his cock get hard and I knew it was time to make my move. I slid my hands under his shirt and started to feel around his lean torso before I pulled away from our kisses to start leaving kisses all the way from his bellybutton up to his nipples and then to his neck as I eased the shirt off, up and over his head. He smelled so freaking good, just like amortentia. Or what I think amortentia smells like. I could breathe that boy’s musk in all day and then all of a sudden I’m taken to that day by the lake when he told me he loved me and I told him I loved him back. I told him then in my bedroom that I loved him and I’d never stop, even if he was on his mission for a decade, and he responded by taking his wand out of his pocket and casting <em>Muffliato</em> at the door so no one would hear us and with another wave of his wand the door was locked shut.</p><p>            “I love being of age,” he told me then, which was so goddamn funny at the moment and we both started laughing and kissing and it was just so sweet and lovely. This time as we were snogging his hands made their way up my jumper and they felt so nice and warm against my skin, which was covered in goosepimples in the dead of summer. As his fingers made their way under my bra to play with my boobs I let him have a quick squeeze before saying that today was all about him, not me, and I ran my hands down to his belt to undo the buckle. I started to retrace my trail of kisses again, this time down his torso until I reached the button of his jeans that I undid and watched his cock spring out. He was so fucking hard for me. I love how much I made him crazy. I pulled his underwear down around his ankles and started kissing him, starting at the base of his cock and making my way to the soft pink tip. I retraced my kisses over and over, each time wetting his cock a little more with my tongue until before long I was sucking the tip of his cock and started to slide my mouth over it over and over again, pressing my tongue on the thick vein on the underside of his cock which drove him crazy because then all of a sudden he was facefucking me and I could feel the tip of his cock hitting the back of my throat. He was thrusting against the back of my throat until it became sore and it took everything to keep going as my eyes filled with tears and I hardly had a chance to breathe and I could taste his salty precum on my tongue. I looked up at him and we locked eyes and he exclaimed, “Merlin’s beard, Ginny, you’re the hottest girl in the whole fucking universe.” On my knees, on my childhood bedroom floor, bra half on, eyes filled with tears, and saliva dripping down my chin, mouth filled with his cock and I was the hottest girl in the universe. I’ve never felt so sexy. This made me suck his cock even harder, take him in even deeper until he pushed me away and told me that I had to stop and he needed a break. He wiped the saliva off my chin with his thumb and pulled me in closer for a kiss that said thank you and I want more all at the same time.</p><p>            “If you need a break why don’t you take the time to undress me?” I asked him because he was standing there basically completely naked, with his pants pooled around his ankles while I was nearly completely clothed. “Yeah, okay,” he said as he kicked off his trainers and stepped out of his pants leaving him in nothing but his dorky white socks. He lifted my jumper up and over my head before he quickly unhooked my bra that he snatched away from me and so he could suck on my nipples. Goddamn, does that boy love my boobs. He palmed and squeezed and sucked for a while until I reminded him that I was only half undressed and I can’t even begin to describe how awkward the crazy dork was as he fumbled at the button of my shorts before he pulled them down to expose my lace panties. With his teeth he began to pull them down, which was not nearly as sexy as he thought it would be and soon abandoned the idea to whip them off me with his hands.</p><p>            Everything went hazy as he helped me lay down on the edge of my bed and I could feel his finger inside of me. I could feel his ridged knuckles against my walls and it was complete heaven and there I was transported back to the lake on that day. He pumped his one finger in and out of me a few times before I could feel him add another, and soon after a third. I was being stretched out by Harry Potter and bloody hell. Instead of using his fingers like he had done before he brought his mouth to my clit and I thought I might pass out. A few more times he pumped his fingers in and out of me and all of a sudden I was cumming all over his hand. I begged him to keep going as I came again.</p><p>            As I caught my breath I sat up and pulled his hand toward me, and stared right into his green eyes as I sucked my cum off of each of his fingers, and asked him if he was ready for his big present yet (I can’t believe I actually said that— it sounded perfectly fine in my head but now it’s just so awkward!). The dork nodded with the stupidest smile on his face and wordlessly he lead me back so I was lying down completely on my small twin bed and he was parting my legs and taking a second to examine my folds before going for it. I knew neither of us had done it before but my god that boy has instinct in bed. I felt the pain as he first thrust inside of me and I bit hard onto my lower lip as he slid in and out of me, slowly, so he wouldn’t hurt me and I could appreciate every delicious inch of him as he found his way back in me. Yes. This started to feel so good. A few slow, careful motions later and I could feel my walls tightening around his cock as I felt an orgasm erupt through my whole body. Yes, this was fucking Harry Potter. This was <em>fucking</em> Harry Potter and I loved him and I knew he loved me and as I felt my pussy clench around him again. I looked up and saw his facial expression change and his mouth hung open as he jerked in and out of me a few more times and he exclaimed <em>Fuck</em> as I felt his hot cum inside of me.</p><p>            My lips hardly began to form <em>I love you </em>as I happened to turn around and peek through my curtains to see Mum and Dad bringing the Delacours back into the house. Shit. I completely lost track of the time. I shot up out of bed and began to pull my clothes on before Harry followed suit and did the same. “How’s my hair?” I asked as I reached for the brush on my dresser and tried to flatten out my sex hair. “Fine,” he said, “and how’s mine?” “It’s the same.” We laughed. I cracked the door open to see that the coast was clear and told him to go back up to Ron’s room all the way upstairs. I could hear his footsteps halfway up and then Hermione said <em>we’ve been looking for you, Harry</em>, and I knew we were caught.</p><p>            Hermione came down the stairs and to my room, and stepped inside to ask me if everything was okay. She told me my cheeks were red and she knew that the buzz in her ears was from <em>Muffliato</em>. Goddammit, she’s too smart for her own good. I begged her to not ever tell Ron because I knew how he was when he found out I was just snogging Dean and if he knew… It’s best if he just doesn’t. She agreed, and didn’t say anything else to me about it, which I am only too thankful for because if she said something I think I’d die right then and there on my bedroom floor from embarrassment.</p><p>            He and I shared secret looks at his birthday dinner over the snitch cake, but only a few, and then Scrimgeour came and the whole night ended in chaos. Well, tomorrow’s the wedding. I know what Firewhiskey did to me. Maybe a few glasses of champagne and he will want me to wish him a happy birthday all over again.</p><p> </p><p>

</p><p>            I’ve been crying all night. Not because the wedding was beautiful, because it was, but because he’s gone. He and Ron and Hermione got away before the Death Eaters came and all I can do is hope they’re safe. I don’t even remember what exactly happened. One moment I was dancing with one of Fleur’s cousins and then the next Kingsley’s lynx was there and Fred and George were hurrying with me and Mum toward the protection of the Burrow while Dad and Bill and other Order members stayed to fight the Death Eaters. Everyone managed to get away safe, or at least that’s what Dad says. I hope he’s right.</p><p> </p><p>

</p><p>            Holy fucking fuck. I just spent the past few hours organizing and packing all my things to go on the Hogwarts Express tomorrow and at the bottom of my trunk I found the vial of potion, the one I got to use with Dean, the one I meant to use with Harry. Fuck fuck fuck. It was supposed to be taken right after but then Mum and Dad were coming home and he had to get out of my room and everything was crazy and I forgot. I’ve been feeling so tired and sick lately, ever since he left, but that’s just because I’m so worried and don’t know what’s happening, or that’s what I’ve been telling myself. I only started my cycle last year and I’ve missed it before, they say because I’m so skinny. It’ll come back next month and everything will be okay and I can go back to worrying about him and missing him and not having to worry about me too.</p>
