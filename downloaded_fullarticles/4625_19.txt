    <p> </p><p> </p><p>Harry bit back a smile as he looked around and saw that Death had successfully placed him where he had asked. A jitter of excitement rippled through his spine, something that hasn't happened in the decades of his young immortality. He could feel where the hallows were, calling out to him softly by pulling at his magic like that of a small child tugging on their parent's sleeve. He wondered if he should retrieve them. But then again he'd have to go through the trouble of going after Dumbledore's lover, stealing from the Potter vaults, and hunting down the Gaunt ring as well. He did wonder if he could simply summon them, but dismissed it. It would be too easy. And would go against the main reason for this little time trip he had. That reason being insane boredom.</p><p>He quickly cast a notice-me-not spell and walked around Diagon Alley. It was refreshing to see the same shops but at it's finer and younger state.  The last time Harry went to here was to have lunch with Ron instead of dining at the redhead's place like usual. It was the day before he died from heart failure the night later. It didn't bring Harry as much sadness as he thought it would, but being the master of death gave him a thorough understanding of the inevitable end. Plus it helped that the stone gave Harry the power to let Ron say his proper goodbyes to Hermione and his kids who were all devastated with his death. Except for Harry. He didn't grieve and could not bring himself to. Not when he knew it was Ron's time. They were old. All of them were. It was already set in stone. Ron had lived a full life of a hundred and thirty, working as an auror then moving up to Head Auror before finally retiring from old age.</p><p>Both Ron and Hermione knew he stopped aging after the war. But he still wore a glamour in front of them just to feel normal. He never took off his glamour outside the privacy of Grimmauld Place, although Luna did reveal to him when she was on her deathbed that she was never fooled. She had always seen him, the real immortal youth he was trying to hide. And it was one of the first times Harry found himself wanting to cry for her loss. He knew it was coming, but it felt different when revealed something like that. He had asked her why she never told him. And she smilingly countered by telling him, "You wanted to hide it Harry. So I let you."</p><p>Harry shook his head with a small rueful smile. He didn't travel all the way to another dimension to think about the past. He was on a mission. Spending decades and decades after everyone he ever loved died had made him yearn for something. But Death argued by telling him, that it was someone, not something.</p><p>"You seek for a companion in your unwanted immortality," Death told him.</p><p>"I've long given up on that," Harry replied defensively, "I'm just insanely bored now. The world of magic is dying. Even before I faked my death, they refused to listen. Now there's nothing to do but watch them dwindle into extinction while the muggles advance far beyond anyone's imagination. There's not much to do anymore."</p><p>"There is always something to do."</p><p>"There's nothing that interests me. You won't let me relinquish this title, so I'm stuck with this endless loop of eternity, watching humans, both wizard and muggle, do the same thing over and over again. Sure it's fascinating to see what wizards are doing nowadays with their new hidden community in the magical space the last few generations have dedicated their lives into making, and to watch muggles declare war on one another with their advanced artillery and nuclear technology. It's still not enough. I've spent my time studying every branch of magic there is. I even tracked down the Flamels for their knowledge in hopes finding something to keep me grounded."</p><p>"The one to keep you grounded is already dead," Death informed him.</p><p>"Excuse me?"</p><p>"Your soul is yearning. Yearning for someone that I've already collected."</p><p>"And you're telling me this now because..."</p><p>"You never asked. And the subject never came up. It's not my business to decide what you do and what you feel. It is only that you stay sane and whole while I anchor Death to you is important."</p><p>"You're a selfish bastard," Harry told him, already used to Death and his sense of humor. He already knew Death didn’t do anything to help him. He didn’t go out of his way to look after him. Merely responded when asked but other than that, Death was a busy entity that occasionally dropped by to troll him. "Anyway, so you were talking about something like my soulmate yes? I thought that was just a pile of romantic rubbish."</p><p>"Master, you must not dismiss things that involve the soul so easily. No matter how ridiculous it sounds. Many wizards dismissed the Hallows as such and look what a mess it made with your life," Death smirked, "And yes, soulmates are real. Would you have a guess as to who was yours?"</p><p>Harry pursed his lips, twirling the elder wand absently, "I...no...I don't have a clue. Are they in the line of souls to be reborn? I know the magical population is dying but the line shouldn't be that long seeing as how some of them have surely chosen peace rather than rebirth."</p><p>"I'm afraid that your destined one is...not in line, nor are they in peace. You could say that the soul doesn't exist anymore. Well, not in this time that is," Death explained.</p><p>"What do you mean? Where are they then?" Harry was aware that there were multiple worlds in parallel timlines other than the one he was in. This was just the one where he became Master of Death first, therefore claiming the title over every other world and locking the mastery to his singular existence. No other Harry would ever have the same title.</p><p>"Dead. With no chance for peace. You as well as the rest of the Light have cursed your soulmate to never again exist. The soul was barely one when I collected it."</p><p>Harry stared at the tall floating ethereal dark being with wide eyes, his brain connecting the dots until he came to the shocking conclusion of his soulmate's identity. "You mean...But--How? The prophecy--"</p><p>"Was correct. But was interpreted differently. And the man was in a sad state of insanity. Have you never wondered how you became his hocrux when it should not be possible? No human could become one, without the host dying almost immediately. But you were soulmates, a pair, and your soul recognized his and allowed it to dwell within you."</p><p>Least to say that Harry had spent a few years throwing something like a tantrum as he denied and tried to ignore the information he received. A few muggle nuclear weapons had gone off disastrously while Harry raged and caused chaos and destruction.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Harry shook his head out of the memory as he went straight to Gringotts. He secured the Peverell lordship as Harreth Evans Peverell to the shocked faces of the goblins who stood gawking at him after he said that he is the Master of Death, something Death had advised him to do so as not to complicate matters since the Peverell line was a very important part of the old pureblood families.</p><p>"How is it that the test said I'm a pureblood. Did you change my blood lineage as well?" He asked as he signed the necessary documents needed, while adding the specific rules he wished to mebe implied.</p><p>"You are a pureblood. Both parents are magical. Since you never tried to take the test in your previous time, you'd be surprised to know that Lily Evans was a half blood, and her grandfather was a squib born from the Peverells. Both your parents are from the Peverell line and when they had you, the title became only yours to claim."</p><p>"I guess you learn something new everyday. And what's with the fancy nancy-name <em>Harreth</em>?"</p><p>"Do you not like it?"</p><p>"Do you?"</p><p>"Irrelevant."</p><p>"Why not just Harry?"</p><p>"Immortality has not given you creativity Master."</p><p>"Shut up. Fine. I'll keep the bloody name." Harry rolled his eyes mentally while finishing up with the goblins. He wore the lordship ring and scanned through the list of his estates that were being neglected and unoccupied. He would end up needing a house once he got things moving. So far the castle and half of the estates are being maintained by the Potters. But they dismissed the smaller properties and left them unattended to. When he claimed his lordship after the war, most of the properties were already being occupied by muggles due to neglect on the wards while the others just rotted away.</p><p>Harry marked down the smaller properties and decided on setting out to expand them. He was quite good with estate managing after he was left to man all the Black properties. He'll choose one where he'll reside as well. He'd have to set up everything while remaining hidden from the ministry. Those meddling old fools were going to ruin his plans if they got wind of the Peverell seat being claimed by someone whose background was impossible to look into.</p><p>Harry bought a trunk, a new set of clothes fit for the current year's fashion, and some potions ingredients to brew regular potions he kept with him at all times. He rented a small flat temporarily while he busied himself with the properties he went to check out. So far, they were mostly empty flat lands, unused and isolated from civilization. There were two cottage houses that were within London and were in decent shape. Harry chose one of them and hired people to fix it up, deciding to use muggles instead. They were undeniably good builders and it would prove more convenient. It was also less likely for the ministry to hear of it as well.</p><p>A month later after the house was still being redesigned and renovated, Harry set out to visit the person he traveled back in time for. He had been putting it off a few. As old as he was some scars still stung and while he’d pick anything to the torturous boredom that plagued him, Tom Marvolo Riddle was still an existence that made a mess of his life. But he already finished his tantrum in his original universe. He came here ready to feel alive.</p><p>And boy did he feel it the moment he laid eyes on the boy whose magic sung to him like that of a Veela’s allure.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t a very unusual night when everything changed for one Tom Marvolo Riddle. The night was dark and cloudy, not a single star could be seen from the window of his room. Among the orphans, Tom was the only one who had his own quarters. None of the orphans felt safe to sleep near him at night. Not since the incident with Billy and the rabbit.</p><p>Tom ignored the rumbling sound his stomach made. Nothing could be done when the older orphans stole his food and later pushed him to the ground. He couldn’t hurt them so blatantly anymore, not when he heard the matrons discuss and debate on having him exorcised. He had searched the meaning of the word in the old tattered dictionary among the shelves and knew it was something he should avoid. Tom knew they thought he was scary. He knew they thought he was mad.</p><p>He didn’t really understand. For as long as he remember, everyone around him feared him. He’s heard the matrons gossip and say how his eyes were unnerving, how strange things always seemed to happen around him, especially when they upset him. Hurting him only made them sick. But no one could prove anything. He was only five. And even at this age he learned to use his appearance to get away with what he could. He’d nearly gotten adopted a couple of times. But each time something happened to prevent it. Something made them change their minds and dump him back in the orphanage. He wasn’t like other children. But he too wanted a family. He’s seen families in church. He wanted it. But these thoughts were at the bottom of his priorities since surviving in the orphanage always came first. And the little boy didn’t just want to survive. He wanted to stand above them. Make them see how they were wrong to treat him the way they did. It wasn’t his fault that families looking to adopt always singled him out first. But the other orphans were bitter jealous and competitive little bastards that would gang up on him for it. It wasn’t his fault that he wanted to know things, to have things. So he stole Mary’s crayons, Billy’s toy car, Mrs. Cole’s hairpin…He learned at quite an early age that people weren’t kind. Especially to those different. And Tom knew he was different. He believed he was special for none of the other children or adults could do what he could. He was the smartest out of all of them.</p><p>But he was so hungry.</p><p>Tom clutched the itchy old blanket, his head laying unhappily on a stiff old pillow as he stared at the blurry for of the moon behind a thick layer of clouds, trying to ignore his hunger. Tears pooled in his eyes. He despised it here in the orphanage. He hated his mother for dying on him. The matrons had given him his answers when he first asked about his parents. He was told of a weak woman who gave birth to him in this very orphanage. And Tom hated her for leaving him here. He wished someone would take him away.</p><p>And at that very moment, someone appeared.</p><p>He didn’t scream when a man with glowing green eyes appeared before him. All he did was stare in startled silent wonder as a fond gentle and somehow mischievous smile stretched the man’s lips.</p><p>“Who are you?” the boy asked warily, eyes narrowing in suspicion.</p><p>“My name is Harry,” the man said, looking around the room which was dimly lit by the now visible moon.</p><p>“What are you?” Tom asked, eyeing the stranger, Harry as the man approached him.</p><p>“A wizard,” Harry responded with a cheeky grin. Orbs of light appeared from his fingertips, drawing an amazed gasp from the boy.</p><p>“It’s magic, my dear Tom,” Harry continued, letting the lights float playfully around Tom.</p><p>“Magic,” the boy whispered in awe before his eyes sharply went back to Harry. “How did you know my name?”</p><p>“Because I’m here to take you away from this place,” Harry smiled. “If you’d let me.”</p><p>Tom felt his heart lurch and he hurried in shoving away the hopeful feelings Harry’s words ignited in him. “Why? No one wants me. Everyone’s afraid of me.” Sooner or later Harry would probably send him back. Just like the rest of them.</p><p>“I want you,” Harry said firmly, bright green eyes hard. “And I’m not afraid.” He knelt in front of Tom, taking his hand and holding it when the boy tried to snatch it back. *<em>I’m not afraid Tom.*</em></p><p>It was like a dose of something electric and warm washed through him. *<em>You can speak snake as well?</em>* he whispered in shock.</p><p>*<em>I can,</em>* Harry grinned, his thumb caressing the small hand in his. “Now, will you come with me?</p><p>Tom looked conflicted between trusting a complete stranger and staying in the orphanage. Harry was a stranger to him. But Harry was also the answer to all his problems if this was all real.</p><p>He nodded firmly and was abruptly rewarded with being enveloped in the warmth of the man’s arms wrapping around his small frame. It felt so nice… and Tom thought to himself that that was what a hug felt like.</p>
