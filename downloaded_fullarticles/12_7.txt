    <p> </p><p>Severus Snape was no stranger to bottling up his emotions. It had, after all this time, become second nature to him: so much so that sometimes he didn't feel anything anymore.</p><p>Emotions didn't come from external sources. They were triggered by thoughts. For example, if he thought his third year Gryffindors all earned Ds for their latest essay because he was a worthless teacher, he would feel a sense of shame at his failure. By contrast, if he thought it was because they were a bunch of arrogant dimwits who spent more time misbehaving than paying attention, he would feel anger and frustration at their failure. If he thought that at least their grades showed the areas where improvement could be made...well...things would probably be better for everyone, but he rarely thought that way.</p><p>The point, however, was: if you shut off your thoughts - you shut off your emotions along with them. Closing the mind was not easy. It had taken him years to master Occlumency and still he had to be disciplined in ensuring he practised regularly, otherwise the magic would be much more difficult to perform when it was needed, and often it was needed as a matter of life and death. The key to clearing one’s mind was to accept that it was, in fact, impossible. Thoughts would always come. Pushing their way through like crowds of squabbling children. What you had to do was acknowledge them, recognise them for what they were, then push them back. Some thoughts were more stubborn than others, of course.</p><p>But whenever he stepped over the threshold of Number Twelve Grimmauld Place, Severus Snape felt. He felt a multitude of things. None of them were pleasant.</p><p>"I can confirm with certainty that Alecto and Amycus Carrow have resumed their positions among The Dark Lord's ranks. As has Antonin Dolohov," Severus said to the members of the Order gathered around the long, wooden table.</p><p>"What about Karkaroff?" Bill Weasley, who had stiffened at the mention of Dolohov, asked. Severus had briefly forgotten the man had murdered both of his uncles. Perhaps he should have approached things more sensitively. But there was so much death to keep track of.</p><p>"To my knowledge, he is still in hiding," Severus replied, keeping his voice monotone.</p><p>Sirius Black, who had been lazily spinning a butter knife on the tabletop all through Severus' report, suddenly stopped. "Your knowledge seems rather limited these days, Snape."</p><p>None of the people in this dingy, basement kitchen were facing the same challenge as Severus: none of them knew exactly what the person across from them was thinking. That meant none of them could use that to gain the advantage, true, but equally they didn't have to be subjected to unwanted opinions and the onslaught of self-doubt that came with them. Oh, they all had their insecurities. Especially the young ones like Bill. But none of them faced a constant barrage of doubt and suspicion subconsciously fired at them from all directions whenever they spoke. None of them had it confirmed just how unwelcome they were. Even the ever-hospitable Molly Weasley was secretly glad that he would always refuse her offer to stay for dinner. He should be used to it by now but sometimes it was...wearing.</p><p>Severus let loose an exaggerated sigh. "As I've told you before Black, the Death Eaters have returned to operating within small factions to hide their identities, even from each other. It protects against the threat of spies. A threat that turns out to be very real indeed."</p><p>"So, what you're saying is...you aren't as useful as you appear?"</p><p>Black didn't make eye contact as he made his comment. He didn't have to. His feelings about Severus, which had escalated to murderous even at the tender age of sixteen, were always expressed loud and clear. The rage came quickly. He wanted to react, wanted to take out his wand and send him careening across the room into the blackened pots and pans hanging from the ceiling; he wanted to snatch Mundungus' wine bottle from out of his grubby hands and bring it down right over Black's smug head. He couldn’t do either of those things, of course, but there were other ways to cause damage.</p><p>"It's an unfortunate hurdle I have to overcome,” Severus began smoothly. “One that also prevented me from learning the truth about your dear friend Peter Pettigrew all those years ago. Though I'm not sure what your excuse was...being so very close to him and all."</p><p>The knife, which despite its bluntness had still been making Severus nervous in the hands of Sirius Black, suddenly clattered to the floor as the man pushed back his chair in anger.</p><p>"Now listen here you-"</p><p>"Sirius, please."</p><p>Ever the diplomat in these situations, Remus Lupin stepped in to place a calming hand on Black's shoulder. It seemed to have the desired effect. Black, sullenness and resentment all over his now haggard features, resumed his place at the table, arms folded across his chest. All eyes were back on Severus now as he finished his report. And through them flowed all their thoughts.</p><p>
  <em>Such a rude man.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>That was uncalled for.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Sirius was goading him, but still.</em>
</p><p>And then, the simplest, but by far his favourite:</p><p>
  <em>Prick.</em>
</p><p>The only person he wasn't getting anything from was Lupin himself. Come to think of it, he rarely got anything from him at all anymore. Had he developed some hidden talent for occlumency that Severus wasn't aware of? Unlikely. There probably just wasn't a lot going on in his mind these days.</p><p>Regardless, Severus spoke mainly in Lupin's direction when he needed to address the group for the remainder of the meeting, purely so he could focus. When it was over, he gathered his things and swept quickly from the room. Too eager to be out of that house to waste time with false pleasantries.</p><p>

</p><p> </p><p align="center">***</p><p align="center"> </p><p>This time the tension was reduced to only a slight gnawing in his stomach. Today he had the support of the one person who trusted him completely. At least, Severus thought he did. The man was an even more accomplished Occlumens than he was.</p><p>Headmaster Dumbledore had taken his place, naturally, at the head of the worn kitchen table. Somehow, he managed to bring an air of importance and grandeur to the dusty, run down room which at other times made Severus feel like they were trespassing children playing an elaborate fantasy game.</p><p>"Got a nice little tidbit for ya t'day. A right tasty morsel, yessiree," Fletcher was saying.</p><p>The Headmaster steepled his long fingers together serenely. "Do share it with us Mundungus, please."</p><p>It never ceased to amaze Severus how the headmaster showed endless patience and respect to even the most distasteful of people. But he wasn't fooled. The only reason Albus had saved Fletcher all those years ago was because he saw something useful in him.</p><p>So really, he and Severus were one and the same.</p><p>"Well," Fletcher began, brushing a strand of scraggly ginger hair out of his eyes to indicate it was time to be taken seriously, "it's the McCoys ain't it? They've only gone an’ expressed a very keen int'erest in some of my, err, darker items."</p><p>"The McCoys, really?" remarked Arthur Weasley, sounding shocked. "I remember Angus claiming he was doing their bidding under the Imperious last time, but I always thought he was one of the few telling the truth."</p><p>Albus smiled sadly. "I'm afraid I've had suspicions about them for some time now. What items exactly?" he asked, turning back to Fletcher.</p><p>"Oh, only the best that's for sure." He used his fingers to begin listing off all manner of horrible things; candles that would slowly poison you, a teapot that gave the drinker homicidal tendencies, even a self-smothering duck-feather pillow. "But mainly they were interested in covert means of transportation."</p><p>"I see." Albus nodded thoughtfully before addressing Severus, who was seated to his right. "I believe they have a daughter in your House Severus? Please keep an extra close eye on her from now on."</p><p>The judgemental eyes of The Order focused on him again. Here we go.</p><p>
  <em>In Slytherin? Astonishing.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>No surprises there.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Everyone in that House should just be expelled and have done with it!</em>
</p><p>God. Hadn't any of these idiots heard of the self-fulfilling prophecy? He looked to Remus sitting across from him who appeared to be listening intently. Their eyes met but...nothing. This was starting to become a little unnerving. But he kept his focus there. It was quiet. Calm.</p><p>Severus spent the rest of the meeting feeling disturbingly like an anxious, bullied teenager hiding behind a teacher. In some ways he was.</p><p>But then, they were all stunted men. Him, Black and Lupin. All of them trapped in the days of their youth. Black carted off to Azkaban when he'd barely hit his twenties, Remus losing his entire support network in one go only to find out that there was no place in the big bad world for the big bad wolf, and Severus...well Severus had escaped a hell of his own making only to be trapped living and working in the school he had only just left. No wonder they each held on to old grudges.</p><p> </p><p align="center">***</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Severus never got used to apparating directly back to Hogwarts and he didn’t like having to rely on Dumbledore in order to do so. By the time he had let go of the old wizard’s arm, Severus was in desperate need to be alone. So, it was with great effort that he managed to suppress a sigh at being asked to remain in the Headmaster’s company.</p><p>“Please sit down, Severus. I promise not to take up too much more of your time,” said Albus kindly, indicating to the plush, red chair in front of his desk.</p><p>Severus sat. “Thank-you headmaster. I must confess I’m feeling rather...drained.”</p><p>“Indeed,” remarked Albus, concern flashing from behind his spectacles as he sat down opposite Severus. “I have been a little worried about you as of late.”</p><p>“I’m fine, thank-you. I just need some rest.”</p><p>“Yes, of course. I shall be direct then.” The Headmaster’s voice became measured, as if he was approaching a subject where he knew he had to tread carefully. “You see, Severus, as you are no doubt aware, I have given Remus a task – one almost as difficult for him as the one I ask of you continuously-”</p><p>Severus scoffed. Going native among the werewolves hardly compared to what he had to endure. Albus carried on as if he hadn’t heard.</p><p>“-and, I’m afraid to say, I fear he is struggling.”</p><p>“Struggling?” asked Severus flatly, one eyebrow raised to indicate his disdain.</p><p>Albus gave a small ‘hmm’ of confirmation. “Being exposed to such stress, along with his condition, is taking its toll. He would benefit from your help.”</p><p>“You wish me to brew that blasted potion for him again?!” cried Severus, temper flaring quickly as it so often did these days. “Don’t I have enough to do? When I’m not out there risking my life, my schedule is quite packed with teaching! I could do without spending my evenings brewing for that ungrateful-”</p><p>“Severus, Severus, please!” Albus held up his hands in a placating gesture. After Severus had let out a frustrated exhale through his nose, he continued. “That is not what I am asking – not this time anyhow,” he added after Severus narrowed his eyes sceptically, “I merely thought you could share with him some of your wisdom. You know better than all of us what it means to be a spy, to play the part...but not lose oneself in it.”</p><p>Lose oneself? Could that mean...? He didn’t need to ask. Albus answered his question with just a look.</p><p>“So, you wish me to impart some friendly advice upon Lupin? Offer some tips on how to be the perfect spy?”</p><p>“Precisely.”</p><p>Severus sighed and rubbed his temples. “Of course, Headmaster.”</p><p> </p><p align="center">***</p><p align="center"> </p><p>“Lupin, might I have a word?”</p><p>Today’s meeting had been a complete waste of Severus’ valuable time and it seemed he was doomed to waste even more of it thanks to Albus. At his words, Lupin had turned to look at him with an expression of surprise etched on his tired face that quickly turned to wariness. Despite this, the man managed to keep his voice irritatingly calm and friendly.</p><p>“Of course, Severus. Shall we use my quarters?” His quick reply managed to silence Black who had already opened his mouth, no doubt to question Severus’ intent.</p><p>Severus gave a stiff nod in reply and followed Lupin out of the kitchen, conscious that all eyes were upon them. He had already begun to feel the same conflicted feelings he had experienced every time he’d brought that smoking goblet to him each month.He remained behind Lupin as the two of them made their way up a winding, rotten staircase, the bannister of which was carved into an elegant</p><p>serpent, until they reached the door to the bedroom which was, presumably, serving as Lupin's quarters for the time being.</p><p>Lupin reached out to turn the silver handle, also shaped into the head of a hissing snake. (Severus appreciated the décor but even he thought the Black family had gone a little over-the-top in proclaiming their love of the Dark Arts.) The interior was of similar taste. The only thing that betrayed Lupin's presence was an old, worn-out trunk placed neatly at the bottom of the musty single bed in the corner of the room. Merlin, he hoped Lupin wouldn’t spend too much time trying to engage him in polite small talk like he used to.</p><p>But Lupin’s whole demeanour changed once they were alone. He whipped round to face Severus; hands balled into defensive fists at his sides. Those tired, bloodshot eyes seemed to turn redder with anger as he spoke.</p><p>“What do you want Severus?”</p><p>Alright – no small talk then. Actually, this made things harder. How best to appease a werewolf on the brink? For once, honesty seemed like the best option.</p><p>“The headmaster asked me to speak with you. It seems he is...concerned.”</p><p>“Oh, he’s concerned?” Lupin muttered bitterly. “Sent you to make sure I’m not caving under the pressure, did he?”</p><p>Severus knew he hadn’t treated Lupin well the last time they worked together. But in all those months he had spent subtly berating the man, even after going so far as to force him to resign, Severus had never seen Lupin like this. He had always been passive, spineless even. Open confrontation, no matter how restrained, was not his style. Perhaps the headmaster was right to be worried.</p><p>“Are you?”</p><p>“Of course not!”</p><p>Severus crossed his arms. If Lupin couldn’t handle being challenged, then he certainly could not handle what lay before him. “Really? Because you are looking even more sorry for yourself than usual these days. Bit of a give-away as far as spying is concerned.”</p><p>“Forgive me for not living up to your standards of subterfuge!” growled Lupin, voice rising steadily. “Things have not exactly been comfortable for me since you lost me my position at Hogwarts!”</p><p>“Don’t act pitiful,” Severus sneered. “You were a danger to everyone at that school! Your own actions proved that.”</p><p>“I doubt you are capable of feeling pity for anyone!” Lupin shouted.</p><p>Several moments passed as the two men stared each other down. There it was. Lupin had always acted as though he bore no grudge towards him, but Severus had always known that couldn’t be true. The man was just as capable of loathing as he was.</p><p>Lupin was the first to look away. He ran both hands through his steadily thinning hair in frustration. Severus suspected it was mostly at himself for losing control, betraying that carefully controlled composure to reveal just a hint of the anger and hatred that lay beneath. Severus knew the feeling all too well.</p><p>“When was the last time you had a full night’s sleep?” Severus asked before Lupin could open his mouth to offer some half-felt apology.</p><p>Lupin let out a humourless laugh. “When did any of us?”</p><p>“You are of no use to anyone if you don’t look after your health,” Severus replied sternly, as if he were addressing a struggling NEWT student rather than a fully grown man attempting espionage. He reached into his robes and produced a small, crystal vial. “Here.” Severus held it out to Lupin in his open palm.</p><p>Lupin eyed it suspiciously before gingerly picking it up between his thumb and forefinger. “What is it?”</p><p>“A simple draught of living death. It should give you at least eight hours of sleep tonight. Dreamless, of course.” Lupin continued to look between Severus and the vial with an anxious mistrust that could only come from the severely sleep-deprived. Severus let out a noise of disgusted impatience. “Take it tonight Lupin. Or do not. It is of little concern to me.”</p><p>With that Severus swept from the sparse, musty room, down the rotted stairwell, and out of that godforsaken house.</p><p> </p><p align="center">***</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Lupin must be practising Occlumency. Had to be. But for what purpose? Severus doubted anyone among the werewolves was a master Legillimens. And how could he have become so skilled so quickly? It just didn’t make sense.</p><p>Though his apparent talent for Occlumency wasn't the only thing about Lupin that was distracting Severus from today's meeting. A side effect of the time he had to spend teaching the skill to Potter was that his dislike for the two men in front of him had intensified to unbearable proportions. Every time he removed those memories, he felt lighter, emptier, more focused. But they had to come back. They always had to come back. And each time they did it was like experiencing them for the first time. More than once Severus had wished that swirling pool would swallow up his memories forever.</p><p>“I see little point in continuing, Headmaster. I think perhaps there is too much resentment between us.”</p><p>“I rather think you’ll find the resentment is mostly one-sided. You are far more alike than you think you are.”</p><p>Severus had to stop himself from rolling his eyes at the memory of Albus’ words. As he turned his focus back to the present Lupin was clearing his throat to begin his report. He must have taken the potion in the end as he certainly seemed more focused and his eyes were less bleary, though Severus suspected that the bags under them were a permanent feature now.</p><p>It did not sound as though his task was going well. Perhaps Severus had been too hasty in judging the difficulty of Lupin’s task. Changing minds had to be more challenging that simply spying and watching surely? He briefly considered what would happen if this was Dumbledore’s next request for him. Have you considered opening up a dialogue with the Muggle Prime Minister, my Lord? Severus smirked at the absurdity of the thought.</p><p>“Something to add, Snape?” Black challenged.</p><p>“As a matter of fact, I do.” Severus would rather the others think him rude than admit his mind was wandering. “Greyback’s request to join the next meeting of The Dark Lord’s inner circle has been granted. Seems he is moving up in the ranks. I will also be in attendance.”</p><p>“Of course you will,” Black muttered. Severus chose not to rise to the bait – this time.</p><p>Lupin, however, looked as though his interest had been piqued. “He has not made the rest of his pack aware of this, I don’t think. But it makes sense, many of the werewolves remain mistrustful of Voldemort following their abandonment by the rest of his followers after the first war. As for those who have joined the Death Eaters, their loyalty is to Greyback- not him.”</p><p>“Yes, it’s quite a bold move on Greyback’s part,” remarked Severus thoughtfully. “Non-humans are not usually permitted in the inner circle.”</p><p>Severus almost thought he could taste a mouthful of black leather, that was how spectacularly his foot had just ended up in his mouth. Everyone around the table was glaring daggers at him. He couldn’t help but meet some of their gazes.</p><p>Well, that was insensitive.</p><p>Probably agrees with his ‘Lord’ fully on that one.</p><p>Fucking arsehole.</p><p>“Nobody could accuse him of not being bold,” said Lupin, smiling a (fake?) smile. It was impossible for Severus to tell. Again, the only person projecting nothing was Lupin himself.</p><p>Arthur Weasley drew the meeting to a close shortly after that. Amongst the scraping of chairs, flurry of open conversation and Molly Weasley’s usual desperate attempt to return some normality to their lives by loudly demanding someone assist her with dinner preparations, Lupin slipped from the room. Severus assumed the man was trying to avoid him until he dipped back through the doorway and indicated for Severus to follow with a brief incline of his head. So, again he found himself traipsing tentatively behind Lupin up the groaning staircase he was certain they would fall through at any second.</p><p>“Severus, I must apologise for my behaviour last week. I was not myself.” It seemed as though some sleep was all Lupin needed to allow him to keep up his façade of politeness even when they were alone together.</p><p>“On the contrary, Lupin. You were probably more honest than you have ever been.” Lupin at least had the decency to look stunned before stammering to defend himself, but Severus held up his hand to stop him. “Please. Let’s not waste either of our time with apologies or excuses. The potion had the desired effect I take it?”</p><p>Lupin hesitated before he spoke, a conflicted expression on his face. “It... did. Thank-you. I’m feeling much better.” Excellent. No need for any further unnecessary interaction then. “In fact,” Lupin continued, “I purchased my own supply from a potions seller.”</p><p>“W-which potions seller?” asked Severus after what he supposed was a comical double-take.</p><p>“The one in Knockturn Alley,” Lupin answered warily.</p><p>Of course. That second-rate swindler was the only one with few enough moral scruples to sell a large quantity of Living Death to someone without approval from a Healer (which one was very unlikely to ever obtain).</p><p>“And just how often have you been taking it?”</p><p>“Ah...nightly?”</p><p>“Then you are either woefully ignorant or just plain reckless! Well? Which is it?” Severus demanded.</p><p>“Err-I know one can develop a tolerance but I thought...in the short term...”</p><p>“An increased tolerance will be the least of your concerns!” Severus was the one raising his voice this time. It was likely someone would hear him, but he paid that little mind. “Living Death has a long half-life – it builds up in your system!”</p><p>“I see...so I should skip tonight’s dose then?”</p><p>“Unless you wish to forgo the ‘living’ part and just have ‘death’ I would advise you do just that.”</p><p>“Right,” said Lupin, looking extremely alarmed. “Sorry.”</p><p>“I would eventually get over it, Lupin, but it would be quite difficult to explain to the headmaster why, after one week of my help, you end up dead,” Severus deadpanned.</p><p>Lupin blinked before his face broke into a poorly suppressed smirk. Which turned into a chuckle, then an actual giggle. Soon, Severus was genuinely starting to fear he was having some kind of breakdown as he watched Lupin double over in almost-hysterical laughter. Just when Severus thought he should go and get one of the others, Lupin righted himself and, between dwindling giggles, apologised to him again.</p><p>“Hah, sorry.” He wiped tears from his eyes. “It’s just that things have been very stressful – both out there and in here – and, well, it was just good to laugh for a moment.”</p><p>“Glad to be of assistance,” said Severus, raising one eyebrow. “If you’re quite finished?”</p><p>“You know?” said Lupin, his face fully at ease for the first time in months, “I think he’s right – Albus I mean – I know what I’m doing pales in comparison to you but...I think we’re the only ones with a vague idea of what the other is going through.”</p><p>Severus was ready to dismiss him instantly...but then, he had to admit he had seen a lot of himself in Lupin recently. The hyper-vigilance, the twitchiness, the irritability. It didn’t suit him.</p><p>And Severus also had to consider – this was something he always knew was in store for him, something he had prepared for most of his adult life. He had had time to fully come to terms with what he was entering in to. Lupin, on the other hand, had simply been picked last minute, an afterthought, purely because he was convenient. No wonder he was turning bitter.</p><p>Although their situations were indeed very different, Severus had to admit there were some similarities. Both of them were forced to confront the darkest part of themselves, surrounded by people they could easily have become, had things gone a little differently.</p><p>But you chose that life, you’ve nobody but yourself to blame for where you are now, Lupin didn’t have a choice like you did.</p><p>As usual, the thoughts he heard that were the most critical were always the ones inside his own head.</p><p>In another universe, Severus says all of this to Lupin, who places a supportive hand on his shoulder in sympathy – no – empathy. The two of them, for a brief moment, fully understand each other. Perhaps they even embrace. Past differences left long behind them.</p><p>Not this universe, however.</p><p>Instead, he cleared his throat after an awkward pause. “If you require a regular sleep aid, Lupin, I can supply you with something less potent you will be able to use nightly.”</p><p>“I wouldn’t want you to go to that trouble on my account.”</p><p>“No trouble. I shall be brewing it for myself anyway.”</p><p>Lupin simply nodded.</p><p> </p><p align="center">***</p><p align="center"> </p><p>If Grimmauld Place was a lion’s den, then marching into Malfoy Manor was, by contrast, a walk in the proverbial, peacock filled park. It made little rational sense. The danger here was very real. He risked it all every time he presented himself to the Dark Lord. Was he simply so stubborn that he valued his pride more than his life?</p><p>Partly. But lately Severus had come to realise that he felt little hatred for his ‘master’. What he felt was a great deal of fear, a small amount of respect and somewhere, buried deep, a sliver of admiration remained.</p><p>Hatred was the most difficult emotion to control, near impossible to block out altogether, and it was always the one Severus lost himself in.</p><p>Here, he was able to shut it all off so that he felt very little at all. He was able to take his place at the fine oak table with barely a second thought to the muggle-born family he’d just watched Bellatrix Crucio to within an inch of their lives. (Although he would feel it fully when he returned to Hogwarts and the haze of numbness faded, but he had his calming draught ready.)</p><p>If he wasn’t here as a spy Severus doubted very much whether he would have earned his place at the Dark Lord’s side. He had been as ambitious and power-hungry as the rest of them in his youth, but it was nothing compared to the drive he had now. Having nothing left to lose came with its advantages.</p><p>As promised, today’s set-up included the werewolf Greyback, who sat defiantly at the furthest end. Though The Dark Lord saw the usefulness non-humans possessed, he usually preferred to have orders trickled down to them through the hierarchy rather than lower himself to dealing with them face to face. And, unlike Lupin, the human part of Greyback was all but gone. He had embraced the wolf in him fully. His face had developed an almost snout-like quality and a permanent snarl seemed to be fixed upon it.</p><p>And, again unlike Lupin, there was no sickly tinge to him. Everything about Greyback exuded power. His leather coat strained over his heavy muscle, his powerful shoulders were too broad for Lucius Malfoy’s dainty chairs, and the hands that rested on the delicate wood were curled and claw-like. For some reason, Severus had an image of them wrapped around his tender throat.</p><p>“As you can see, we have an honoured guest with us this evening.” The Dark Lord’s gleaming eyes flicked between his followers. All appeared less than impressed by the werewolf’s presence; from Bellatrix, who was all but hissing with open hostility towards him, to Lucius, who was likely most concerned by the scratch marks those claws would leave on his table. “The werewolf Greyback has requested, on behalf of his people, to – ah – discuss terms? Though I believe I have made those quite clear.”</p><p>“My Lord,” Greyback began, in a voice as deep and growling as one would expect. (Severus was impressed to note that it quavered with fear only slightly.) “With respect, I have lost many of my kind to this war. Kin who I have personally turned and spent years shaping, showing them how strong they can be, how they need not live under the confines of wizards. We must know it has not been in vain.”</p><p>“Indeed, your dedication to increasing your numbers has been nothing but...admirable. Tell us, just how many infants have you overpowered this year?” said the Dark Lord lazily, the irony of the barb apparently lost on him.</p><p>Through his haze of numbness, Severus felt a far-off blaze of anger. His mind unwillingly went to Remus – not the adult one he was finding increasingly more sympathetic, nor the adolescent one he harboured so much resentment for, but the Remus he’d never met. The child who must have known so much fear, so much suffering, so much hatred, far too soon. He couldn’t stop his usually impassive face from twitching slightly.</p><p>“Not nearly as many as you promised!” snarled Greyback. Clearly, he was a being that did not appreciate being mocked. It was also clear that he overestimated The Dark Lord’s need for the werewolves if he was challenging him so openly.</p><p>The Dark Lord smiled but it did not reach those red eyes. That was actually a good sign for Greyback. It meant he would live. For now.</p><p>“If it is reassurance you seek, my servant, I am happy to provide this for you. But only once. You will find I do not enjoy justifying myself.” The anger and resentment in the room was palpable. Severus thought Greyback might defy all laws of the moon and transform into a beast right in front of them. But the Dark Lord paid it no mind as he continued. “Those who are loyal to me shall not be forgotten. As I have said, you and you people shall be able to live openly among us. There will be a place for you in our society. You will get what is owed to you.”</p><p>Greyback nodded as if satisfied but his clenched fists betrayed him. Severus stared openly at him and, just briefly, they made eye contact. A powerful rage came through to him as well as a desire for vengeance that was so very strong. So strong, in fact, that Severus thought only he himself was inhuman enough to feel such things.</p><p> </p><p align="center">***</p><p align="center"> </p><p>He hadn’t been able to see Lupin very often. Between his busy teaching schedule and the need to be cautious regarding how often he was away from Hogwarts Severus wasn’t able to be as involved with Order meetings as he should have been.</p><p>But it was as though that each time he had seen the man over the past few weeks he was withdrawing further and further away from the others. The regular sleeping draught – plus the odd nerve-calming potion – Severus was supplying him with was doing little to improve his temperament. It wasn’t unusual for him to glower through meetings and to quickly shoot down the more foolish suggestions. This morning he had already snapped at Kingsley for suggesting patrols of Knockturn Alley should be decreased, glared at Arthur for saying he thought he could slip some muggle tapping equipment into the Minister of Magic’s office, and positively growled at Nymphadora when she spilt a cup of tea onto his lap.</p><p>The headmaster had made one of his rare appearances today and, more than once, had given Severus a meaningful look from across the table whenever an incident like this occurred. He sighed inwardly. It seemed that simply palming Lupin off with potions wasn’t what Albus had in mind. He was going to have to talk to Lupin...about his feelings. His lip curled with distaste at the thought. He honestly didn’t know what Albus expected of him. Of the many skills that Severus Snape possessed, being able to provide a sympathetic shoulder to cry on was not one of them.</p><p>But, as Lupin threw down the interior plan of the Ministry of Magic in frustration for the third time, Severus realised he had to do something. The current situation just wasn't workable.</p><p>"Ah...Headmaster?” He never could seem to get out of the habit of addressing Albus as if they were in a staff meeting. “Could we take a short break? There is something I wish to discuss with Remus privately before we continue.”</p><p>It wasn’t an unusual request. Even within the Order of the Phoenix some things had to be kept secret to avoid the risk of information leakage. The reason everyone was staring at him was because it was the first time he had ever called the man ‘Remus’. He hadn’t meant to, it just slipped out.</p><p>Albus blinked once behind his half-moon spectacles before quickly covering his surprise. “Certainly Severus, I could use a chance to clear my mind as well. Sirius? Do you think we could use the time to pay Buckbeak a visit?”</p><p>Black glared at Severus, but he had no choice than to lead the headmaster upstairs to where the Hippogriff lay. Instead of slinking off to the man’s bedroom again, Severus guided Remus to the library at the back of the house.</p><p>Severus had only been here once before, but it was certainly his most preferred part of Grimmauld Place. He didn’t know why the rest of them insisted on using that claustrophobic little kitchen for meetings rather than this room. The velvet chairs, although covered in a thick layer of dust, looked much more comfortable than the ones in the basement. And while some of the subject matter was...questionable at best...some of the books looked like they could be rather useful. Perhaps it was the giant tapestry depicting Gellert Grindelwald magically fixed to the wall that put people off. He picked out a book titled Purity and Power: The Importance of Preserving Magical Blood and examined the cover.</p><p>“Well? What is it you need to tell me?” Remus barked. “Has Greyback become aware of my presence among the others?”</p><p>“Hmmm? No, nothing like that,” Severus replied, book in hand and still feigning distraction. “I just wanted to give you some time to get a hold of yourself.”</p><p>“Excuse me?!”</p><p>“Remus, what I’m about to say to you will be difficult to hear, but please know that it comes from a place of deep caring.” Severus began leafing through the pages absentmindedly. “You have become even more of an unpleasant presence at these meetings than I am.”</p><p>Remus narrowed his eyes. “Oh, I highly doubt that.”</p><p>Severus stopped, still holding onto a page mid-turn, and finally looked at him. “Even I have never come close to making Kingsley Shaklebolt cry.”</p><p>“The man was being ridiculous! How could he suggest scaling back patrols at this time?!”</p><p>Severus just raised an eyebrow at him before taking out his wand and pointing it at two of the armchairs. The explosion of dust that came off them made Remus sneeze, only adding to his irritation. Severus sat down on one of them and eyed Remus expectantly.</p><p>“Please, just tell me what’s going on with you so we can all get back to the task at hand.”</p><p>For a moment Severus thought Remus was going to scream at him, but he just collapsed heavily into the other chair with his head in his hands. “Dumbledore is...right of course,” he said eventually. “I am struggling.”</p><p>“Well that much is obvious,” Severus remarked. Remus let out a dry, angry laugh but didn’t elaborate. “Is facing what you truly are really so difficult?”</p><p>“I’ve never been under any illusion about what I ‘truly am’!” he barked. “The world insists I face it every day I assure you!”</p><p>“So, what’s the problem then?” Severus asked, his patience already starting to feel rather thin.</p><p>Remus huffed and turned away. After several moments of angry silence Severus was more than ready to admit defeat. ‘Very sorry Headmaster but I just wasn’t up to the task, now if I could go back to charming the psychopaths and the mass murderers?’ But then Remus let out a long sigh before speaking.</p><p>“I think...” he began, hesitating despite his anger. “I think my reasoned arguments aren’t working because I... Because I am starting to believe in them less and less myself.”</p><p>Severus said nothing. It seemed like the right thing to do. He wasn’t exactly the master of sensitivity and saying anything right now might break whatever spell was causing Remus to open up to him.</p><p>“How am I supposed to tell them things will get better without radical change? All my life, Severus, I have struggled. I don’t have much” - He gestured down at his patched-up robes - “and what I do have I’ve had to fight for, but compared them? Compared to them I’ve lived a life of luxury. Did you know I met a girl while I was out there?” Severus – of course – did not know that. He waited for Remus to continue. “Though you would be forgiven for thinking she wasn’t a girl at all, so feral she looked like a beast. Couldn’t have been more than 15 or 16, she should be one of your students right now...</p><p>“Anyway, we talked. Or rather we communicated as best we could. She told me that, once, when she was very young, she ran away from home on the night of the full moon. Couldn’t stand how much her transformations upset her parents. She positioned herself near this farm – way out in the middle of nowhere, you know? - thought she could live her life just killing chickens once a month. The farmer – he's a wizard himself so he’ll understand, won’t he? He comes across her that morning when he opens the henhouse, a little girl curled up among the innards, covered in blood, sated expression on her face.</p><p>“He puts two and two together pretty quickly and she wakes to him hovering his pitchfork over her chest. She’s a beast so he may as well put her down like one...except...he can’t do it. She looks like a human, an innocent...but he knows the truth. So, he does what any decent member of wizarding society would do.”</p><p>“He turns her in,” Severus stated, hoping if he says it firmly enough it’ll make it true.</p><p>“No, Severus, he does not turn her in.” A dark shadow passed over Remus. “He chains her up. For the whole month. Nothing to survive on but the entrails even the wolf in her wouldn’t touch. Her parents have no idea where she is. On the rare occasion he does visit her she begs him, tells him she’s sorry, that she just wants to go home. The only thing he tells her is that she’s a monster that needs to be put down.</p><p>“So, he waits until the full moon, stays to watch her transform but he just can’t stomach it, so he waits outside. Waits for the screams to become howls. But when he goes back in...”</p><p>“She escaped?” asked Severus.</p><p>“She’s escaped alright. Fool actually believed silver chains would hold her! But she doesn’t flee. When she wakes up the next morning, she remembers it all. The rage, the power, how good it felt for him to be the one who was afraid of her before she tore him apart in a frenzy. It’s the first time she’s killed a person, but she doesn’t feel any guilt. She knows then that she can’t go back to her family. All the hiding, all the shame, all the fearful looks they thought she was too young to pick up on – she knows now it’s because it’s all true. She is a monster and she belongs with her own kind.”</p><p>Severus looked at Remus for a long time. It was not so much that he was stunned – or even surprised – by his story. It was that he knew that whatever words he chose to say to Remus next would be important ones.</p><p>“I think I... can understand how she felt.”</p><p>“You?” spluttered Remus, “You think you understand?!”</p><p>“Yes,” Severus went on, undeterred. “Other people’s expectations of you eventually become your own in the end. If you let them.”</p><p>“Is this where you tell me it’s weakness of character that’s my problem?”</p><p>“There are many aspects of your character that are weak, Remus. Your inability to assert yourself, having a need to be liked so strong that you turn into a simpering doormat around your worst enemy, but in terms of you managing being a werewolf” - Remus looked up in surprise when Severus didn’t use some euphemism like ‘condition’ or ‘problem’ - “I have to admit that you have always shown a quiet strength in that.”</p><p>Remus contemplated that for a while. When he spoke again most of the anger had faded.</p><p>“If you were anybody else, I would say you were just trying to make me feel better but coming from you I know it must be true. The man who never sugar-coats anything – not even his potions!”</p><p>“Believe it or not, that was my attempt at sugar-coating.”</p><p>Remus laughed, his eyes softening for the first time that day. Although they quickly hardened again as he remembered his situation.</p><p>“You see what I’m up against, though? How am I supposed to convince people who have lived those kinds of lives not to turn to Voldemort?”</p><p>“By telling them the truth. That he is not the one who can bring them the change they seek. That he will abandon them the first chance he gets. Or worse."</p>
