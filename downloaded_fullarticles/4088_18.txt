  <em>"I stare at my reflection in the mirror</em>

  <em>Why am I doing this to myself? </em>

<p><em>Losing my mind on a tiny error</em>."</p>

<p> </p>
<p>I hate mirrors.</p>
<p>I hate how they let you judge. I hate how they show all your imperfections. I hate how they follow you around everywhere.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I began to notice mirrors, in all shapes and sizes, when I was young. I was around three years old when I first noticed that I could see my reflection in a glass of water. Four was when I noticed that well-polished silverware distorted your face, but you could still get a somewhat accurate reflection. Five was when we got the mirror.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It was a dumb gift to my father, Uncle Percy thought that it would be a laugh, but I hated it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It was an ‘Insult Mirror’, the mirrors that talk back to you. It was constantly telling me to brush my hair, fix my shirt, and put on some makeup.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I was five, let me remind you.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I had bigger issues at five, than a rude mirror.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Molly was sick, I had to go to ‘Muggle’ school, and my dad was never around.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I really loved my dad; he was my knight in shining armor. Sure he was missing an ear, sure he always smelled like smoke from his failed inventions, and sure he wore clothes that clashed horribly with his hair.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But he was my dad, <em>my</em> dad. He didn’t care if my piggy-tails were uneven, he didn’t care if there was a stain on my shirt, he didn’t care that my fingers were dyed blue, as it was my favorite color at the time and ever picture I drew was blue.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That period was known to my family as the blue period, for Freddie it was red.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Though whenever I went to hug my dad when he got home, whether from the shop or St. Mungo’s, he would pick me up and the stupid mirror would make a rude comment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>About <em>me</em>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A <em>five</em> year old.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The mirror made me so angry; all it did was comment about me, not Freddie who could be covered in mud –<em>Oh! Such a cute little boy</em>.-, my mother tired from her shift at St. Mungo’s and her makeup smeared all over her face –<em>The lovely woman of the house, looking good as usual</em>.-, or my father, in his…state –<em>Welcome home, don’t you look handsome</em>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It’s not hard for me to say that the mirror was happily smashed by a ball one day when Victoire –<em>Quite the beauty you are.</em>- was watching us.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I had been so happy, for weeks it was gone, never commenting on my appearance. It was out of my life for what seemed like forever.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Then it wasn’t.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Uncle Percy –<em>Handsome man, nice tie you got there</em>.- got dad another one, and every year the tradition began. Uncle Percy got dad a mirror; I found some way to get rid of it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My favorite time was the first one, smashing it with a ball.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I did get more inventive as the years went on, my plans got more and more elaborate, one year I was even able to smash it before my dad unwrapped it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Correction that was my favorite one.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I had a whole year of silence, no rude, sneering comments. No more unhelpful suggestions. No more of its outlandish presences.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But then the company came out with one that couldn’t be smashed, just in time for my dad’s birthday.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I had to resort to hiding it, finding anyway I could to make it disappear.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But it always found its way back, always, always, always.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>My dear, don’t you just look a bit overweight. My dear, put a bit more makeup on. My dear, those clothes aren’t for you, maybe something a bit less tight.</em>
