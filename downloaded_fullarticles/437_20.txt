    <p>As anyone can tell you, waking up with a cat on your face is unpleasant. As Rey in <em> particular </em> can tell you, waking up with an orange and white tabby cat butt on your face is <em> exceptionally </em> unpleasant.</p><p>“Gahhh!” she sputters, flailing her limbs as BeeBee chooses that exact moment to unleash her claws into Rey’s unsuspecting skin before springing off. Rey sits up, scrubbing at the loose cat furs still stuck to her tongue, glaring at the small beast out of the corner of her eye. “Do you never get sick of interrupting my sleep?” she mutters, socked feet sliding off the side of her bed to kneel at her trunk. The contents are a jumbled mess, the tangled robes putting up a tough fight until one set breaks free. </p><p>
  <em> Sniff.  </em>
</p><p>They’d do.</p><p>A plaintive <em> mrow </em>echoes from the other side of her bed, Rey glancing at the place where BeeBee is perched on a pile of quills and schoolbooks and parchment scrolls filled with research notes. She frowns, brushing the disgruntled, hissing cat away to reveal the calendar on top of the stack, eyes widening at the date. </p><p>At last, the day of Headmaster Skywalker’s surprise had arrived.</p><p>The whole school had been buzzing with excitement for weeks, theorising what new intrigue the… <em> eccentric </em> headmaster would bring to Hogwarts. Poe had insisted the headmaster had transported an ancient Egyptian wizard’s tomb to school for seventh years to practise their curse-breaking, but Rey grimly had to accept it was much more likely Kaydel’s theory that Luke had finally found a mooncalf which produced enough milk for his tastes and couldn’t wait to share the news. She's spent too much time trying to get the headmaster to support her independent study to get her hopes up. Still, a girl could dream. </p><p>Despite just waking up, the dormitory is already empty. Shit, she needs to get a move on if she wants to make her favourite part of the day—breakfast. </p><p>Rey flies down the stairs to the Great Hall, robes whipping behind her as she jumps the last trick step and bounds through the doors. Within seconds, she spots the beaming face of her best friend. </p><p>Finn slides to the side, Rey slipping into the seat he had saved for her. He grins, “I was worried there for a second. Not like you to be late for <em> any </em> meal.” Too busy loading her plate with sausages and toast to do much else, she rolls her eyes as she elbows him in the side. “What?” he gasps in mock indignation. “You know I’m right!”</p><p>“I <em> would </em> have been down here sooner if BeeBee hadn’t felt the need to smother me in my sleep,” she retorts, Finn groaning in response. </p><p>“Is that where she went? Poe’s been looking for her all morning.”</p><p>Something feels off. Glancing around, it’s quiet. <em> Too </em> quiet for a hall full of hundreds of teenagers—even without Poe. She turns to Finn and asks, “Has he not said anything yet?”</p><p>Finn shakes his head. “Nope. Haven’t even seen him yet. Guess Luke must be planning to tell us at dinner.”</p><p>Rey sinks her teeth into her kipper with more force than is strictly necessary. Of course he hadn’t. Why would the headmaster ever alleviate the suspense when he found it so much more humorous to just let them sweat over it instead? If she hadn’t met an <em> actual </em> troll, she would have thought Luke was one. </p><p>The crowd dwindles out slowly, Finn saying his goodbyes as he heads to Transfiguration, leaving Rey alone at the table. She lingers a few minutes longer, sopping up the last of the grease on her plate with a piece of bread before heading to the seventh floor for her own studies. </p><p>Three passes in front of a blank wall later, and her metal creations are waking up at her entrance into the room. They clamour around her in excitement; not quite Muggle and not quite Magic, the blending of wizardry and robotics gives each of her constructions their own personality and charm.</p><p>For weeks, she had charmed and transfigured and practised as much as she could because she could feel it just around the corner: the ability for her pieces to channel their power independently, to practice their own form of magic. Her pieces are alive on their own, none having reverted back to their inanimate state from the moment she had transfigured them. It’s almost unheard of, and now she seeks to push the boundaries even further, to enable her creations to transfigure themselves, to funnel her magic into their own power rather than rely upon her to shape and guide them.</p><p>Her research into theoretical transfiguration has pushed her beyond the education she could achieve at Hogwarts. Professor Holdo marched her out of her class late last year to demand the headmaster take Rey under his wing, to pass on the knowledge he had achieved in his five decades of academia. But while she was allowed to pursue the knowledge on her own, he resolutely refused to help, averse to any and all forms of bureaucratic work as he was. </p><p>Artoo beeps, calling her attention back to her task at hand. A circle of stones hovers overhead. Rey chose one of the simplest spells that first years begin with - <em> wingardium leviosa - </em> to test her theory out on. She already knows that when she uses her magic, Artoo can tap in and exercise some control over the spell, moving the rocks this way or that. But when she begins to transition some of her own magic out in the hopes that Artoo will maintain control of the spell—</p><p>The stones clatter to the ground. Rey growls. </p><p>“Do not fear, Mistress Rey! I am confident you will be able to correct whatever error you have made that has thus far prevented you from succeeding.” A vein in her forehead pulses. It’s too soon to give up, she’s only been at this for an hour. She lifts her wand, preparing to try again. </p><p>“And besides, not all of your creations can have the same refinement as myself. Why, Artoo’s design is quite subpar in comparison—”</p><p>That was it. She could only take so much of Threepio’s nattering on.</p><p>Threepio turns to Artoo after Rey storms from the room. “Well, how rude! And here I was just complimenting her on her skill for constructing me!”</p><hr/><p>The gargoyle springs to the side without a password, well accustomed to Rey’s visits. Another few steps and the door to Luke’s office flies open, the young witch barging in and pacing from side to side across the room. “Headmaster, you <em> must </em> teach me. How can you disregard one of the most significant breakthrough branches of magic in this century simply because, oh, I don’t know, The Real Housewitches of Worcestershire is on at the same time or whatever half-hearted excuse you’re going to give me today.” She throws herself into the overstuffed armchair across from his desk, continuing her rant, “The KnightLab programme in America is incredibly selective, and if I’m to have even a shot at continuing into their one-of-a-kind transfiguration programme as a graduate student, I <em> need </em> your guidance.” She pauses -- wouldn’t Luke normally have started arguing with her by now? -- and turns to the headmaster’s desk.</p><p>Where the Minister of Magic stands next to Luke.</p><p>Oh<em> —and she could not emphasize this enough— </em>fuck. </p><p>Leia’s amused smile spreads even wider. “Rey, wonderful as ever to see your boisterous charm,” she says. “What’s this about a graduate programme in America?”</p><p>Twisting in her chair to assume <em> any </em> position that was not teenage-temper-tantrum, Rey stutters, “M—minister. I didn’t see you there,” as she gets to her feet.</p><p>“That wouldn’t happen to be the programme run by Benjamin Solo, now would it?” Leia Organa asks. “And although I appreciate the respect, I’m not minister anymore,” she says with a wink.</p><p>Rey nods, cheeks still burning. “I understand. And yes Minister, it is the programme run by Master Solo.”</p><p>Somehow Minister Organa’s smile grows even wider. “Well, it sounds like you have a lot to speak about with my brother. It’s time for me to get on my way, I’ve finished my yearly pilgrimage to the school to convince my brother to remain headmaster another year rather than return to Muggle Wales,” she side-eyed her twin, “and his <em> hobbies. </em>But, I’m sure that I’ll be seeing you again very soon,” she says, heading out the door. </p><p>Before Rey can have a chance to recover enough from the embarrassment to even <em> think </em> to ask what all that was about, Luke’s hand is on her shoulder and he’s shepherding her to the door. “I’m nothing but a washed-up old man with nothing left to teach. In fact, a very unique opportunity to learn will present itself very soon.” They’re at the door, Luke not even <em> trying </em> to conceal his intention to toss her out. “But if after tonight you still feel you need something more to get into the graduate programme, I will help you. Now, I’ll leave you to your studies,” and with that, he shoves her out of his office.</p><p><em> Unique opportunity! </em> Rey fumes. Utter bollocks. What other excuses could he come up with to get out of teaching her? Come tonight, she was going to march right back and show him <em> just </em> how serious she was about pushing the boundaries of transfiguration.</p><hr/><p>By the time her second favourite time of the day rolled around, Rey has calmed down. Of course, Finn had to talk her out of marching back to Luke’s office and pounding on the door until he <em> had </em>to listen (Poe encouraging her to do so having earned him a glare from Finn each time), but all in all, she’s somewhat less aggravated than she had been at noon. Which couldn’t have anything to do with the soporific effect of the considerable amount of carbs she had practically inhaled at dinner. </p><p>All trace of weariness disappears when Luke stands up. Rey’s spine stiffens, grateful for the few inches of extra height she has on many of her classmates and she cranes her head to get an unobstructed view of the headmaster.</p><p>He taps his wand to his throat. “Is this thing on?” </p><p><em> Why </em> was it that when Luke had no children, he felt the need to curse them all with the worst dad jokes he could think of?</p><p>So caught up in contemplating—for not the first time—whether or not Luke might have been a failed stand-up comedian in a former life, she almost misses him say, “—the Triwizard Tournament. The representatives from Castelobruxo and Ilvermorny will be here tomorrow, so you only have a day to submit your names. And now, goodnight,” he says, and then marches to the exit. </p><p>Stunned silence. </p><p>He sticks his head back around the corner, adding, “Oh and by the way, the winner gets one thousand, six-hundred and fifty galleons.”</p><p>Chaos erupts. Everywhere people are talking over each other, shaking their friends, running to the professors’ table to get <em> some </em> kind of context around what had just happened. And Rey sits in the middle of the clamour in disbelief.</p><hr/><p>It’s hardly a question of whether. Mere minutes after the Great Hall clears she’s wandering, not knowing where her feet are taking her, and the voices start, and they’re louder than they ever have been before. Reminding her of how she<em> needs </em> the money, of the things that she could do with it, of the research she could undertake. She finally feels like she’s found her calling in this fusion of wizard and Muggle technology, and with a purse that big she could dedicate herself to the research in which she found meaning. She could start the journey to her graduate programme. Even Luke had told her to enter, hadn’t he, earlier today? What else could he have meant by that? It <em> would </em>be an impressive accomplishment to list on her application, particularly because Ilvermorny would be participating in the tournament and the transfiguration programme had close ties to the school. </p><p>And most of all, she would have something that was hers. <em> The Triwizard Champion. </em> Something no one could take from her. Something to show she did something, actually meant something. </p><p>She has a lot to think about. </p><p>“Rey?”</p><p>She looks up from her armchair, surprised by Finn’s sudden appearance. </p><p>“I haven’t seen you for hours. Where have you been?” His brow furrows. “Are you okay? You seem… distant.”</p><p>His concern snaps her back to attention. “I-I’m fine. </p><p>“Okay, I believe you.” He takes the seat next to her. “Don’t forget, you promised Poe you’d help him with his Animation charms tomorrow morning. We’re gonna have to get to bed soon if we want to stay awake in Ackbar’s History of Magic class tomorrow.”</p><p>She nods. Yes. That’s a good idea. He sighs, pressing her again, “Really though, are you sure you haven’t been working yourself so hard? I know how much your independent study means to you, but I’ve barely seen you since the school year started. I know you’re already working at Maz’s over Christmas, but can you at least take a break for Easter? Mom and Dad still haven’t let go that you didn’t spend the summer with us, much less that you haven’t responded to their repeated requests to adopt you,” Finn says with a wink.</p><p>“Easter…” Rey bites her lip. Application season will be in full swing and she’ll be preparing to present her thesis to the Department of International Magical Cooperation to compete for one of their coveted scholarships. She loves Finn’s family -- Mr. and Mrs. Fistroder have always showered her with love and hugs and kisses -- but… it’s his family, not hers, no matter how much she wants it to be. </p><p>Then again, he’s looking at her with puppy dog eyes to rival one of the Queen’s corgis and how’s she supposed to say no to that? </p><p>“Of course I’ll come, Finn.”</p><p>He smiles. “Thanks Rey. It means a lot. And I know we can be pushy, but you’ll always have a place at our house.” Another... <em> subtle </em> glance at her and he’s heading to bed, leaving Rey to wonder where the hours have gone.</p><hr/><p>She puts her name in the goblet first thing in the morning. </p><p>Of course, the headmaster hadn’t made it easy for her. No, why bother to tell his students what the goblet was, or where it would be, or even how to enter their names once they’d found it? After enough years finding new ways to sneak into the kitchen, Rey’s familiar enough with the castle to notice there’s something off about the third-floor corridor on the right-hand side; she lets herself in with a simple <em> alohomora </em>, but now she’s the one that has to distribute that information to every Tom, Ron, and Harry that wants to enter the tournament.  </p><p>As it turns out, the entire Castelobruxo delegation could count themselves among that number. </p><p>She’s just on her way to Potions when a gaggle of students in radioactive green robes flag her down. </p><p>“Hey!” calls one of the students (with remarkably good posture, Rey notes). “We’re looking for the Goblet of Fire. Your headmaster pointed us in this direction, said something about ‘but what if the real goblet is the friends we made along the way’ and then disappeared.” She shakes her head in disbelief, before extending a hand to Rey. “I’m Paige, by the way.”</p><p>“Rey,” she says, shaking her hand. “And I apologise, our headmaster can be quite… eccentric.”</p><p>Paige rolls her eyes. “With a director like ours, we’re already used to it. But back to the matter at hand, how do we get to the Goblet?”</p><p>Pointing in the direction she had just come from, Rey begins, “It’s quite simple once you figure it out. Go all the way down the corridor to the right—ignore the out-of-bounds sign, all of us do—then once you get inside there’s a Thala-siren sleeping wrapped around the goblet, and to access it to put your name inside you have to tickle the Thala—”</p><p>“Tickle it?”</p><p>Yes, I’m afraid Headmaster Skywalker finds this sort of thing quite funny.” She cranes her head, surveying the group. “Did your headmaster not accompany you on this trip as well?”</p><p>A short woman standing next to Paige snorts. “Director Tekka knows that we can handle ourselves. Although I do wish he had warned us that the staircases keep changing locations…” Her eyes light up. “You’re a Hogwarts student, and you’re the first one who actually knew where to go. Will you show us around for the rest of the day?</p><p>Spend time with a group of students from a school famed for its magical advances and connection with nature instead of toiling for hours in a musty dungeon while the ceiling dripped on her? It’s a dream come true. Unfortunately, the nightmare that is her four feet of parchment on the Wolfsbane potion in her backpack reminds her that she had to get to class or risk receiving a T on her assignment. “I’d love to, but I really do have to get to Potions.…”</p><p>“At Castelobruxo, even our second years have already learned how to brew veritaserum. We’d be happy to help you make up any material you miss, and more.”</p><p>Rey grimaces, thinking of Phasma staring her down when she will at this rate, inevitably, arrive late to class. “I’m sure you could, it’s actually more my professor that I’m afraid of.” A thought occurs to her. “I have classes for the rest of the day, but at dinner come and find me at the Gryffindor table. My friends and I would be happy to show you around then.”</p><p>In agreement, the group separates, allowing Rey to continue on to her classes for the day. </p><hr/><p>Hours later, she rejoins her new acquaintances in the Great Hall. Poe is already arguing with one of the sisters (Paige she thinks?) about, of all things, the appropriate penalty for temporarily maiming the opposing team’s Seeker, and so she seeks out Finn. He too is deep in conversation. </p><p>“Wow, and that’s really Leia Organa, first female Minister of Magic for Britain and primary organiser of the Rebellion?” Heart-eyes are almost visible in Rose’s face as she stares at the high table, sighing over each new hero she recognised. </p><p>“Yeah, she’s the Headmaster’s twin sister so she comes by fairly often. To the left is her husband Han, and further down the line you’ll see Gial Ackbar. Now, everybody knows that he’s a little batty—keeping a merperson out of water for long enough would do that to anybody, no matter the strength of Aguamenti and modified Bubble-Head charms used—but he knows more about magical history than anyone, probably because he’s older than everybody else here combined. And over there is—”</p><p>Rey tunes out Finn’s nervous prattling. Why hadn’t the Ilvermorny students arrived yet? The Tico sisters and their classmates had arrived hours ago, and it’s almost time for the selection of the champions. </p><p>A gasp from Rose makes her jump. “No! Is that—is that <em> Ben Solo?” </em></p><p>Rey’s eyes widen and she twists in her seat, frantically scanning the crowd. </p><p>Merlin. </p><p>It <em> is.  </em></p><p>She’s only ever seen his picture once, but that was enough to know it’s him. Taller than she could have imagined, with hair as dark as night. Energy crackles around him as he strides to the front of the room, every eye following his path and the students that trail in his wake. Even for those who don’t know who he is, it’s plain to see: this wizard radiates <em> power. </em> </p><p>The principal, the founder, the <em> everything </em> of the KnightLab is here, at Hogwarts! The leading theorist on self-animated transfiguration, the pioneer of artificial intelligence in magical creations. She can’t believe it. Her eyes shoot to Luke at the head table, who’s now standing to greet their guest. Their eyes meet across the Hall, Luke’s twinkling with mischief as they home in on her and just her.</p><p>He knew this and he <em> didn’t tell her? </em> Rey grits her teeth. Oh, there would be hell to pay for this. </p><p>The Ilvermorny students take seats at the Ravenclaw table, their blues finding a home with the ties and drapings of the students there though their crimson finishes show their newcomer status. Their leader crosses behind the High Table, taking a seat next to Phasma. </p><p>His eyes are brown. Deep brown, their dark light contrasting the sharp features of his pale skin that his thick waves of hair frame, a sculpture that is carved in near monochrome. He is so unlike anything she’s ever seen before and she feels something stirring deep in her chest. A sense of belonging, of connection. She <em> knows </em> this man, beyond her objective knowledge of his position and skill she just knows <em> him, </em> a knowledge of loneliness and searching for meaning, just like her—</p><p>“REY.”</p><p>She jolts. Finn’s looking at her with something between confusion and shock. “Rey, I’ve been saying your name for, like, an entire minute. You and that American bloke were just <em> staring </em> at each other, it was freaky. Do you know him or something?”</p><p>Still shell-shocked, Rey manages a nod. “You know the transfiguration programme in America? He runs it.”</p><p>Finn’s eyes grow wide. “That’s <em> him?” </em> He glances at the high table and Rey follows suit. Ben Solo is no longer looking at her, instead engaging in deep conversation with Professor Phasma. “Wait, but how does he know you then?” Finn groans. “You haven’t been sending him fan mail, have you?” </p><p>Rey blushes. “That happened <em> one </em> time.”</p><p>“One time for almost a whole year,” Finn says. “<em> You </em> try seeing your best friend simper over Jar Jar Binks endlessly and see if you can forget it.”</p><p>“Look, if you’d read the book about his heroics during the Battle of Naboo—”</p><p>“The book <em> he </em> wrote,” Poe butts in. “Important detail.”</p><p>She makes a non-committal noise, unwilling to continue the argument. Could she risk another look at the high table? Raising a hand to the side of her face, she peeks again.</p><p>...why were the ex-Minister, her brother, <em> and </em> her husband all looking at her?</p><p>Her cheeks burn and she focuses on shovelling food into her mouth instead. Nope, definitely couldn’t risk another look. </p><p>Thankfully, she doesn’t have to contemplate next steps for creating a new identity and fleeing the country for long. Clearing his throat, Luke stands and makes his way to the podium.</p><p>“As I’m sure all of my students have learned, the delegates from Castelobruxo and Ilvermorny have arrived, and we are delighted to welcome you to our humble home.” A smattering of polite applause follows his announcement. “Unfortunately, my dear friend Director Lor San Tekka was unable to make this exciting event, owing to the need to categorize all the types of sand found on the Castelobruxo grounds. I look forward to continued good relations between our schools. Next, I would like to introduce my nephew, Ben Solo—”</p><p>“His nephew?” Rey asks in shock.</p><p>“—who has attended as a favour to the British Department of International Magical Cooperation, and to the formal American delegate—”</p><p>A thin, washed-out man stands up, interrupting Luke’s speech. “The American delegation would like to assure all of the students that despite the numerous deaths and permanent injuries resulting from previous competitions, this year’s Triwizard tournament has been modified to ensure there will be absolutely no chance for potential lawsuits resulting from this competition.”</p><p>Luke clears his throat, “Thank you to Representative Armitage Hux of MACUSA for tending to those, ah, <em> important </em> bureaucratic matters. Now, concerning the selection of the champions—”</p><p>“—In addition, all champions will have to sign a waiver prior to their participation ensuring that in cases of permanent maiming, irreversible charmification, boils of unusual size, curses of any variety, and three hundred and ninety-four other circumstances there will be no legal action taken against my person, MACUSA, Ilvermorny, the American wizarding community, and all other affiliated parties.”</p><p>Narrowing his eyes, Luke turns to the still-standing man and asks, “Are there any other matters you would like to attend to at this time, Representative Hux?”</p><p>“That is all at this time,” the red-haired man says, sitting down.</p><p>“Then back to the matter at hand…” From the entrance, the ancient wooden goblet floats in, Professor Holdo guiding it to the front of the hall. The moment the goblet touches the floor, the blue flames glow burgundy, crackling brightly. “The Castelobruxo and Ilvermorny students have all already entered their names, as I hope my own students have as well. So, for our first champion, from Ilvermorny…”</p><p>The whole hall holds its breath, unsure of what the withered wooden goblet might do. </p><p>The fires brighten again, burgundy flames reaching for the starred ceiling, and with a crackle a piece of paper flutters down from the crest of blaze. </p><p>“Jannah Tezee!” </p><p>Ilvermorny students erupt in cheers, an athletic girl standing from their midst. </p><p>“Congratulations,” Luke says, and gestured towards a door off to the side of the high table. “Miss Tezee, please wait through there for the remainder of the champions.” As she heads for the exit, he lifts his hand again. “Now, for the Castelobruxo champion…”</p><p>Rose is practically vibrating with energy next to Rey, laser-focused on the Hogwarts headmaster, where a small piece of paper is landing in his hand. It doesn’t escape Rey’s notice that Finn had placed his hand on the small woman’s shoulder—something she’d have to follow-up on later that night, once they were back in the comfort of the Gryffindor tower.</p><p>“Rose Tico!”</p><p>“Yes!” Rose cheers, fists pumping the air. Dashing a few seats down, she pulls her sister into a tight hug before continuing on to the chamber off the Great Hall.</p><p>This was it. Throughout the evening Rey has been on edge, even more so after seeing her hero enter the room and now, as each champion is called. But now her heart is pounding in her chest, threatening to beat right out of her body given the slightest chance. This is the opportunity she needs, to stand out, to have enough coin for a graduate programme to be even considered <em> now, </em> rather than years in the future when she has pinched and saved every penny, to catch attention as deserving of a coveted position within a rigorous programme with more applicants each year than they knew what to do with.</p><p>The flames glow. </p><p>The paper falls. </p><p>Luke dips his head to read.</p><p>And then he calls out:</p><p>“Rey Niima!”</p><p>Her world stops.</p><p>Voices dim, nothing more than a buzz in her ear and there’s something fuzzy about the world, all the details blurring as she rises from the bench, taking first one step forward, then the next.</p><p>Where is she going? Oh yes, the chamber. Right. Have to walk to the front of the room, then turn left. Simple. She’s almost there now. </p><p>When she turns left, there’s only one thing she sees. </p><p>Ben Solo. </p><p>With a look of rage on his face.</p><p>In that moment it all floods back to her, the cheering in the hall, the entire Gryffindor table on their feet behind her, the knowing smirk on Luke’s face, and her own feet, moving without her conscious thought. </p><p>Maybe she was mistaken. He hadn’t looked like that before, had he? After the other champions had been called? Maybe it was just that the Scottish cuisine wasn’t agreeing with him, the beans giving him <em> really </em> bad gas. Why would some nobody from nowhere with nothing to her name, that he had never even <em> met </em>cause him so much anger?</p><p>As she passes the table he drops his eyes, glowering down at the plate in front of him. Hm. Her theory that dinner had done him dirty grows stronger. </p><p>At the end of her walk, she finally, finally passes through the doorway and out from under scrutinising eyes, joining Jannah and Rose as they await their instructions. </p><hr/><p>Throughout the lecture of the rules to the three teenagers (really, they are practically <em> children), </em>Ben Solo fumes. From his position against the wall of the chamber he can see everything, his uncle babbling as usual, the students’ bright eyes as they hang onto his every word, Hux spewing utter nonsense about the safety regulations they’ve imposed for this year. </p><p>But most of all just…</p><p>Her. </p><p>Her eyes are chocolate. So warm, their bright light is set in the sharp features of her tanned skin, all framed by soft hair pulled up in the most unique hairstyle he’s ever seen, a masterpiece painted in inviting browns and tans, a natural warmth radiating from her person. She’s so unlike anyone he’s ever seen before and he feels something stirring deep in his chest, has felt it from the moment he laid eyes on her. He <em> knows </em> her, despite knowing absolutely nothing about her. She’s just like him, he can feel that they are one and the same, knows that she feels the same loneliness and search for meaning, just like him. </p><p>She is the first person to look at him without fear or disgust in years. Of course, everyone always tells them how much they<em> admire </em> him, how much they <em> appreciate </em> what he had done for them. But under the surface they are all still terrified of him, and he could feel their fear in every unctuous word they speak to him. They tremble in the presence of a man who had lived undercover for years, at what he must have done to earn Snoke’s trust to get close enough to kill the villain that had terrorized America for half a decade. She is everything they aren’t, and he is desperate to keep her warm and kind and most importantly, <em> safe. </em></p><p>He grinds his teeth as Hux hands out the waivers, assuring the champions that they are perfectly safe, that this is all just a formality, all for their own protection. What a complete fucking joke. The real reason Hux had made an airtight waiver was because he is, just as Ben is, almost <em> certain </em>someone would be hurt in this international farce his father is helping put on, and his uncle (and Lor San Tekka, in his frankly feeble state as well) are just too stupid to see that. After all, Americans know blood and drama are what made the best ratings, and Hux’s family owns the station that has exclusive broadcasting rights of the proceedings…</p><p>There isn’t a chance in hell he’ll let her participate. </p><p>She’s bent over the paper now, no doubt trying to make sense of the legal jargon Hux had made sure was indecipherable to anybody but the most pettifogging lawyers. Oh, and that just makes his blood boil, the thought of Hux trying to trick this poor unsuspecting student (<em> Rey, </em> he turns over in his head), into signing her life away. Not while he was on watch. </p><p>He strides over, stopping mere inches away from her. “You’re not going to participate in the tournament.”</p><p>She looks up, blinking repeatedly. “Sir—I mean, Director Solo—”</p><p>...What. “You know who I am?”</p><p>“I’m so excited to meet you, sir. I’ve been completing an independent study under Lu—I mean, Headmaster Skywalker’s guidance on metallurgical transfiguration. I think I’m close to making a breakthrough on autonomous magical control of transfigured subjects, and so I’m planning on applying to your programme once I graduate—really, it’s such an honour to meet you sir.”</p><p>Beautiful, kind, <em>and</em> brilliant? There is absolutely no chance he’ll let her get hurt. “You can’t participate in the tournament,” he repeats.</p><p>“And why not?” she asks, her tone unreadable.</p><p>“Despite what that moron says, it is extremely dangerous and you <em> will </em>get hurt if you enter.”</p><p>She twitches, and he sees anger flash across her face for half a second. “I’m perfectly capable of handling myself, thank you.”</p><p>Shit. </p><p>Rey marches over to Hux, shoving the papers into his hands before turning to leave. </p><p>Ben stalks after her, hissing, “If you’re trying to get into my graduate programme this is <em> not </em>helping your case.”</p><p>She swivels on him. “You’re not the only person on the application committee, and after winning this tournament there’s <em> no </em> way they’d let you block my application. Just you try to stop me,” she says, marching off again.</p><hr/><p>From the other side of the room, Hux’s ears perk up at the conversation he had only half-overheard, piecing together the wrong meaning. “Ren doesn’t want this wisp of a girl to win the tournament because then she’ll be guaranteed admission into his graduate programme? Interesting…” he muses to himself.</p><hr/><p>From the <em> other </em> other side of the room, Han leans over, whispering in his wife’s ear, “Well <em> that </em> was interesting.”</p><p>Leia snorts at her husband’s grin. “Insulting Luke’s favorite student, with you for a father? Please.” Her eyes follow Rey as she storms out of the room. “He has good taste though—he gets that from me.”</p><p>Her brother appears behind them. “Seems Ben can’t keep himself out of trouble. Too bad, because Rey’s even more stubborn that he is,” he says with a sigh. “What a shame it would be if he met a British girl and decided it was time to come back home.”</p><p>Sharp brown eyes glint in the waning candlelight. “What a terrible shame indeed.”</p>
