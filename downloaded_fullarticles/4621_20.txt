    <p>The first time it happened, Graves thought he was drugged. The Painkiller Potions of the mediwizards must be warping his mind and making him hallucinate.  He hadn't known who it was at the time, just that when he woke up groggy and in pain and disoriented in the hospital room of Saint Katrina's Mediwizarding Center, he wasn't alone. Theseus was half-asleep in the uncomfortable chair next to the bed-- God, Thes. What kind of hell must this have been for him?-- but there was a slender figure with close-cropped dark hair and a pale gaunt face standing in the corner.</p><p>“Thes, who is that?” he rasped, voice used to wordless screams now struggling to produce words and meaning. His best friend hadn’t answered at first, the tight grip and the foreign obscenities-- <i>you sodding git, Perce, don’t you ever scare me like that again</i>-- overwhelming the barely audible question. </p><p>He had asked again and Theseus had glanced over his shoulder, lines of concern forming on his forehead. </p><p>“Perce, there’s no one here but me.”</p><p>“But…” And when he'd looked again, the slender shape was gone.</p><p>The next time Graves knew who he was. A slip of a boy out of the corner of his eye. The boy he'd never known, the boy he'd betrayed regardless. The boy he'd failed. Credence Barebone. Coerced and seduced by a man wearing his face and put down by Graves’ own Aurors. The very same Aurors who came to interview him. When had <i>Percival Graves</i> stopped and <i>Gellert Grindelwald</i> begun?  What had he known about the Obscurus and the Second Salemers? When they entered Credence shrunk back and pressed himself back into- <i>into</i> the wall, shoulders vanishing into the wallpaper.</p><p>“You know he's right behind you,” he’d snapped at the tactless bastard who’d muttered that really, Mary Lou Barebone would have done them all a favor if she would have finally snapped and killed the creature. </p><p>The Aurors had glanced behind them. <i>There's no one there, Mr. Graves</i> and nearly immediately after they departed, a mediwizard had come talking very gently about taking time to heal and Calming Draughts and understanding that the mind could scar as well as the body. </p><p>He stopped mentioning it.</p><p>Maybe he had gone insane. Maybe the pale face in the corner of his vision had finally accomplished what Gellert Grindelwald hadn’t-- at least not <i>entirely</i> managed. It didn't matter. The rest of faculties seemed unharmed-- besides the dreams and there were potions and brandy for that. Besides. A constant reminder of his guilt? Of his failure? Graves was fully capable of doing that on his own without the help of this shade who quietly dogged his steps, fading in and out but never remained gone for more than a handful of hours. </p><p>Graves saw him in the hospital, quietly watching, shrinking away when the Aurors arrived. Once, Tina Goldstein came to see him and he’d stepped out into the light as if he was about to speak, but her eyes swept unseeing over him.  He’d curled in on himself and vanished.</p><p>He saw Credence at MACUSA, too, when Picquery finally, begrudgingly let him return to his work. He spent an afternoon watching the boy drift through his office, examining books and magical devices in the tall glass-panelled shelves. Credence only dared approach the desk when Graves had gotten up to find a book. He could still see him, faintly reflected in the glass shelving and bent over the model of Magical Exposure Clock.</p><p>“It's a gauge for how likely the No-Majs are to notice us,” he said. “You apparently skewed that reckoning quite a bit.” </p><p>Credence jerked upright and vanished.</p><p> </p><p>The boy appeared in his home as well. It startled Graves every time he did it. His home was warded, spells interwoven with each other, buried deep in the very brick and hardwood of the brownstone. It hadn’t saved him, of course. There was nothing his wards could do when when their own Imperiused master invited a monster through the front door. </p><p>Graves was certain, though, he hadn’t invited Credence. His home felt wrong enough already. The brandy set on his end table was missing a snifter, a jarring asymmetry he caught himself on every time he reached for a glass. The photo of his sister cried upon seeing him. The avatar of his failure standing quietly in his living room did nothing to let him remember that this was his home.</p><p>He didn’t notice the books until he’d been home for two weeks. It hadn’t been a good day. They’d started to go through his memories in a Pensieve and frankly, whoever thought “reviewing memories from an objective standpoint” helped with the healing process had clearly never watched themselves be <i>tortured</i> in brilliantly precise third person. He’d come home late, rattled, ill-at-ease and all he had wanted was two-- fine, <i>four</i> fingers of brandy and a book to lose himself in.  Zoticus Pippins’ <i>The Development of the European Wizarding State</i> had always struck him as persuasive and surprisingly entertaining, despite its dull sounding title. </p><p>Gellert Grindelwald had apparently shared his opinion. Written in a cramped-but-legible hand in the margins of the introduction was a note: <i>cf. Demetrius Falco role of feudal wizarding advisors</i>. </p><p>The fascist son of a bitch had written in his books. </p><p>Silver-white flickered in his vision. Graves yelled, dropping the book as his wand snapped up by instinct to level at Credence Barebone’s face. </p><p>His hand was shaking and he sheathed it with a scowl. “What do you <i>want</i>?” he snapped at the boy. The <i>ghost</i> because that’s what he was. A ghost that for some reason, only he could see despite never having had an ounce of Sight in his life.  It wasn’t enough to be metaphorically haunted by his failure, he had to be literally and Graves was too tired and too old to appreciate the poetic irony of it all. </p><p>Credence stood silent.</p><p>“I don’t know what you want! Why are you doing this?” Graves gestured, encompassing-- this. All of this. Following him. Appearing. Bearing witness to the wreck of his life and his mind and his career.  “I fucked up. I lost. I let that fascist son of a bitch get the better of me and you paid for it. Maybe more than I did.” </p><p>Graves only felt like the living dead, after all. Credence actually was. </p><p>“I don’t understand.” He took a step towards the apparition, who shrank back an inch, foot slipping into the bookshelf. “I--I’m not going to hurt you. Hell, I don’t think I could if I tried. But I don’t know what you want, Credence. Do you want me to apologize? I do. I am...so sorry. I’m sorry we lost you. You never should have been allowed anywhere near that woman. I’m sorry you were deceived and I’m sorrier that it was by someone wearing my face. And I’m sorry we killed you. None of this should have happened to you.” </p><p>Credence looked at him for a nearly eternal moment before fading away. </p><p>Graves nearly screamed in frustration, alone now in this house that didn’t feel like home, no matter how many memories he had of calling Theseus through the Floo to wish him a happy birthday, drinking chilled Sancerre in the living room with his sister, pacing in the kitchen and eating scrambled eggs directly out of the pan as he looked over case notes. </p><p>He spent the rest of the night drinking and systematically burning every book that Gellert Grindelwald had written in. </p><p> </p><p>Caribou Island was only accessible by boat. That was the point, after all. Unplottable, thickly warded against Apparition and entirely disconnected from the Floo Network, accessing the island required a long and difficult trip from Agawa Bay, navigating not only the dense Lake Superior fog but also the shallow reef that ran along the south side of the island, a scant eleven feet below the surface.  </p><p>It was cold, wet, miserable and virtually inaccessible. Which was why it worked so well as a high-security prison jointly run by MACUSA and the <i>Societé pour la Réglementation des Sorciers Canadiens</i>.</p><p>Graves tucked his chin into his scarf as he stood on the deck of the run-about, watching the light of the lighthouse strobe across the greyish fog and blue slate water. Only the way the light refracted and bent around a body that shouldn’t be there made Credence’s appearance visible against the fog. </p><p>“I take you to the nicest places. I know,” he muttered.  Caribou Island slowly swam into view and he glanced at Credence. The boy had nearly backed through the wall of the hospital room upon seeing the Aurors. What would he do brought face-to-face with the man who had betrayed him? </p><p>Well, face-to-face was inaccurate, perhaps. Credence was dead, after all, and <i>Graves’</i> face had done the betraying. Still, dead or not, Credence deserved a warning. </p><p>“I don’t know if you control when you disappear. But you might want to,” he said. Credence, as always, didn’t answer, so he continued, watching the wake of the boat churn the water into thin trails of foam. “The place we’re going to. Gellert Grindelwald is imprisoned there. The man who stole my face. Who lied to you.” </p><p>Credence drifted closer and the movement was almost inquisitive. </p><p>“Why? Because he’s being a smug son of a bitch and MACUSA thinks showing him I didn’t starve to death in my own linen closet will ruffle his feathers. Or they’re hoping I’ll crack up in his cell and they’ll have a reason to make me retire. Take your pick.” Graves exhaled and watch a plum of steam rise from his lips. Credence watched too.  Did the boy miss breathing? Graves didn’t even know if it was possible to miss something so instinctive, but...how would you not?</p><p>The boat docked at the island. </p><p>“Last chance,” Graves told Credence before following the two Canadian Aurors who had accompanied him off the boat. </p><p>Credence followed and Graves wasn’t sure if it was bravery or being unable to run away.  Maybe it was both. </p><p> </p><p>“Percy. How terribly good to see you.” Grindelwald’s smile might have looked pleasant if he’d been nursing a coffee at a Viennese <i>Schanigarten</i>, but here, in the frostbitten interrogation room on Caribou Island, with his wrists shackled and thickly warded to restrain his magic,  it looked uncanny. </p><p>Graves wanted to break every single one of his perfect teeth. </p><p>“You’ll forgive me if I don’t return the sentiment,” he bit out.</p><p>Grindelwald tsked. “Percy. If MACUSA was desperate enough to risk sending you, shouldn’t you be more--” He stopped mid-sentence, face suddenly alight with a keen and nearly possessive interest. “My dear boy, are you still pining? Can you still call it out? Even now?” </p><p>Graves didn’t even register the motion. He saw Credence cringing back against the wall and then he was between them, his body a barrier and a statement. As if the dead needed any kind of protection that he could offer.  How quixotic. </p><p>“You were talking to me, not him.”  </p><p>Anger flashed across the other man’s mismatched eyes and his face went hard. <i>”Du bist en kleiner Dieg, nicht wahr?”</i></p><p>“I don’t think you have any room to be calling me a thief.”  Graves had no idea how <i>Gellert Grindelwald</i> could see Credence when no one else could or what he had stolen, but he wasn’t going to let that on. </p><p>“I wore that face too long for you to lie to me with it,” Grindelwald chided lightly. “You don’t know, do you?”</p><p>“What don’t I know?” Graves growled. The other man’s delight at knowing something Graves didn’t was insufferable. </p><p>Grindelwald spread his hands on the plain wooden table. “Since you brought me such an interesting little puzzle to chew over in my solitary hours, I’ll be generous. I’ll answer a question if you do.” </p><p>“Fine.” </p><p>“You ask first.”  Grindelwald gestured to him with regal magnanimity. Graves wanted to scream.</p><p>“Why am I a thief?” </p><p>“I seem to have spent too long in your head. Enough that some of my Sight seems to have bled over. At least when it comes to ghosts.” Grindelwald gave a Gallic shrug. “And then of course, you died. Which must have helped matters.” </p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Come now, Percy. Dying is a spectrum. You died a lot in my care. Not enough to stay dead, of course. But enough that I had to restart your heart.” There was nothing pleasant on Grindelwald’s  face now. “It got difficult near the end. You were so very stubborn.”</p><p>“What’s your question?” Graves’ hands had started to tremble and he put them behind his back to still them, keep them out of Grindelwald’s sight. </p><p>“No thank you? It’s a very rare gift I’ve gi--”</p><p>
  <i>”What is your question?”</i>
</p><p>Grindelwald’s smile was beatific. “Have you found my present yet?”</p><p> </p><p>MACUSA had torn New York City apart. The ports, the railways, the ruins of the Second Salemer Church. Tenement houses, the smoke-choked repair tunnels of the subway. Every office in the Woolworth Building on both the wizarding and No-Maj sides.  Graves’ home-- and no one dared to ask about the piles of scorched book spines in the heart. Or the empty bottle of brandy. </p><p>They’d found nothing. Maybe there was nothing to find. Maybe Gellert Grindelwald was entertaining himself by making them dance, even from his lakewater prison. Maybe he had misdirected them, sent them chasing hares while something worse happened unnoticed. Maybe they’d just failed. </p><p>Again. </p><p>Graves collapsed into the chair in his office.  It was full dark outside; he could feel the weight of the hour and its coldness even three stories underground. The Magical Exposure Clock still ticked calmly, unaware of any gift that might disturb its composure. </p><p>Silver shimmered and the boy stood in front of him, just on the other side of the desk. He was so much closer than he’d ever come before. </p><p>“Why are you here?” Graves asked in exhaustion.  “You heard him. Whatever you want, I can’t give it to you. I’m barely more alive than you are and hell, now I’ve got a piece of him inside me. My own Aurors couldn’t tell us apart even before. Now we must be nearly identical. </p><p>He leaned his head in a hand, fingers pushing into his hair and making it fall loosely to either side. The pomade wasn’t holding after the swamp fog of Caribou Island, the hours of searching. All he wanted to do was go home and get drunk enough that he stayed asleep through his nightmares.</p><p>For the first time in a month, Credence Barebone spoke.</p><p>“I don’t think you are.”</p>
