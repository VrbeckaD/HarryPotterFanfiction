<hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>They meet in a graveyard and it is, perhaps, ironic.</p><p>They meet in a graveyard and Albus Dumbledore is the most beautiful thing Gellert has seen in his life.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There is no beauty at Durmstrang.<br/>
<br/>
No, this is wrong. Its surroundings are <em> miraculously </em> beautiful: the midnight sun, the deep-frozen lakes, the way the scant light in the long winters bend over their secrets up here. The shape his <em> lumos </em> takes when he sends it dancing between the tall pines at midwinter. It’s a place for utter worship and darkest despair; it’s wasted on a school that is only interested in moulding servants from the dirt. They tell him Durmstrang shows tolerance for the dark arts and yet Gellert cannot fathom the reluctance with which his tutors treat the strongest, most desirable forms of magic.<br/>
<br/>
He has known from a very early age that the boundaries built by other people will never be enough for him, that they won’t hold him in place, never satisfy a mind or a heart like his. When he says this in the place claiming to be his home he is met with violence. At Durmstrang with silence, later with punishments.<br/>
<br/>
The old castle is set in its ways, shaped by a very particular sort of magician and steeped in a stoic, joyless form of magic that is efficient as Muggle armies but lacks a soul. The witches and wizards of Durmstrang do not burn, they are not <em> ignited </em> with the fervent, frantic possibility of magic that storms through Gellert whenever he lets it, the gorgeous flood of strength that rushes through his blood and moves his bones.<br/>
<br/>
Magic is the greatest joy he has ever felt and he could cry when he thinks about it, how his professors subdue the core of it all, silence the roaring excitement in opening yourself up to the elements, allowing your body to carry out the deeds of the world. They want to teach him spells for repairing chairs when he could be altering the way the wind moves. They give him homework on Muggle electricity when he wants to understand how a curse can interfere with the human heart. He’s told to refine his bodily movements, arrange himself around the idea of martial arts while Europe prepares to go to yet another war around them.<br/>
<br/>
“I am <em> wasted </em> on this!” he shouts at his Headmaster during his first year up in the north. “I can change the world!”<br/>
<br/>
They still have patience with him back then, he’s merely told to be quiet and learn how to stand in line. Like a feeble Muggle soldier marching off to war. So Gellert stands in line and thinks of freedom and boundless power, juggling hexes in his head.<br/>
<br/>
Later in his quarters when he’s cold he pulls the generated heat from inside the walls into his hands, shaking with the effort and the thrill, making mental notes of density and texture, a reminder to himself to study further how all matter is put together.  <br/>
<br/>
On his own he dives into the history books and he spots magical presence everywhere; he reads Muggle literature and finds that even the Muggles are obsessed with magical energy. Chemistry, physics, mathematics: there’s a scientific dimension even to magic and he’s not foolish enough to diminish it. Theology, poetry, philosophy; all of it deals with the power in that which cannot be seen, cannot be measured. He devours it, page after page, book after book. It saves his sanity for the first two years at Durmstrang, keeps him sustained, <em> breathing</em>.<br/>
<br/>
There’s no use talking to the others about it; he makes no friends at school. Quite a few of his fellow students seem to fear him or find other reasons to keep their distance. In his fourth year there’s a small group of three boys and a girl who approaches him - quietly at first, very discreetly because his reputation is carved into the heavy walls here. <em> We heard that you experiment with the dark arts</em>. As though it's his purpose to darken the magic he uses, as though he’s banal enough to seek only dominance or destruction. Gellert bites his tongue and explains. At first he actually tries to <em> explain </em> what it is that he means, what it is that he Sees.<br/>
<br/>
He explains that the Muggles will break the world in their foolish quests for powers never meant for them. That the air will be polluted and the oceans will turn black and that they were not intended for such arrogance, such ambition. That they ought to submit to their true masters the way humans have always submitted to their betters or died opposing them.  <br/>
<br/>
He explains that he doesn’t want for them to die. Not all of them, not necessarily even a <em> lot </em> of them. Most he believes will serve a true purpose somewhere.<br/>
<br/>
He explains the significance of the unexplained and unspoken - that the whole universe is imploding from the weight of it all and he wants to trace its roots to the corners of the earth, lift them up, consume them for himself.<br/>
<br/>
There <em> are </em> no corners to the earth, one of the boys corrects him. A dutiful boy. Such an ideal little wizard, stern and glum like the castle he’s trained in. It takes all the self-control Gellert possesses not to jinx the brat into oblivion.<br/>
<br/>
But the boy is not the only one, that is the way of them all. It’s a pattern he’s overly familiar with by now.<br/>
<br/>
Durmstrang picks them off one by one, grabs the living boys and molds them into a grey <em> nothing </em> .<br/>
<br/>
Gellert can’t even bother to find excuses for what he eventually tricks the brave little group of students into doing for him. They are too naive, too unimaginative to have the faintest idea even as he explains the experiments to them. They deserve their fates.<br/>
<br/>
When they expel him he argues halfheartedly for twenty minutes - he counts them in his head, wants to chronicle his achievements or lack thereof - that he’s never done anything lethal, that they were all giving consent, that his intention had never been to hurt.<br/>
<br/>
“Merely to improve,” he explains to Headmaster Frigg who looks somewhere above Gellert, at a fixed spot over his right shoulder. “I believe the source of our magic could be infinite.”<br/>
<br/>
“Nothing is infinite, Gellert.”<br/>
<br/>
“But you’re <em> wrong </em> about that! Look at the Muggles, look at what they accomplish with so little - imagine what we could do if we did not strive to contain our powers.”<br/>
<br/>
“Controlling is not the same thing as <em> containing </em> ,” Frigg protests but Gellert can hear the doubt in his voice. Nothing much, merely a shade of possibility that the old fool might see reason. A glint in the corners of his eyes, the way he opens his mouth and closes it again without a word.<br/>
<br/>
<em> Doubt.</em><br/>
<br/>
He keeps it in his chest as a trophy when he walks out of the castle for the last time. The Deathly Hallows look at him from the walls, a silent farewell to send him off.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It’s a long winter that year, almost <em> endless</em>.<br/>
<br/>
He travels to South Africa, to South America, to Iceland and Austria. Apparates wherever he can, takes a boat or a train to see the sights, packs books and treasures and sleeps at various inns along the way. Wherever he goes he speaks to the local wizards, asks about things worth seeing, people worth meeting. There’s an echoing freedom in him now that Durmstrang has disappeared - quite literally so, they have erased all memory of its location from his mind, removed themselves from his inner maps - and he can feel his own power expand, extract from one place to another almost at will.<br/>
<br/>
And he learns so much his head <em> sings.</em><br/>
<br/>
He learns of the eggshells that had trapped dark magic in Sardis after an earthquake had wrecked the ancient city. Muggles had excavated the old ruins to find still-breathing wards against the dark, its magic fading out into the mundane world but still there, tangible to those skilled enough to sense it. The medieval city in France where Muggle monks had concealed a whole community of witches whose magic had fuelled the entire society. He hears about legendary weapons forged before the dawn of civilisation and wands that have existed so long they pre-date the written accounts. When he learns about the Deathly Hallows - the first mention of them outside of old books takes place in a seedy pub in northern Iceland where a witch dealing in dragon eggs is trying to sell him one for over an hour - he knows that this is the path he must take now.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So finally, after two years of travels and legends, he stands in a graveyard in Godric’s Hollow and it’s summer, <em>finally</em> summer. His tunic is damp against his back, his scalp is hot under the wild mane of hair that he hasn’t seen any reason to tend to recently.<br/>
<br/>
“You look like a bloody lion,” Bathilda mutters that morning before serving him breakfast, moving closer as though wanting to sort out the strands, smooth him out. Nobody has touched him in a very long time; he holds his breath, waits for her to restrain herself and wonders if he would have liked it, being petted like a small child or an animal. She clears her throat, lowers her hands again.  <br/>
<br/>
“There’s a boy your age here,” she tells him instead. “Immensely clever wizard. You’d like him.”<br/>
<br/>
Gellert nods, hums something back while immersing himself in the Daily Prophet that his great-aunt insists on having in her home though it appears to have very little worth for a reasonably intelligent person. Muggle-compliant nonsense, outrageous gossip and meek articles arguing for or against pointless reforms that all agree with the Statue of Secrecy.<br/>
<br/>
Such high hopes for Britain and so far he is disappointed.<br/>
<br/>
And then, a short while later, Albus Dumbledore stands before him, all brilliance and naked power.<br/>
<br/>
“You won’t find the Hallows here,” he says levelly but his voice is thick with anticipation.<br/>
<br/>
“You know about the Hallows?”<br/>
<br/>
“Of course I do.”<br/>
<br/>
There’s something very young about him - Gellert is certain he isn’t much older but he’s never been young, not in his <em> heart </em> - but his eyes are ancient, worldly. That impression is interrupted by his voice, however, by the way he wears his emotions visible on his skin that looks almost golden in the heavy beat from the sun. They dance there, Gellert thinks hazily, dance like thestrals and he catches himself desiring to press a kiss to the other boy’s mouth to see if he tastes of it. <em> Kiss </em> him, like one would kiss a lover and oh, what a lover Albus would make! He’s made like a sculpture of an angel, something from an idealised painting, his body and face in painful, harsh symmetry and there’s such strength to it, to the perfect form. As if the power inside him has altered his outside, broken through the surface.<br/>
<br/>
He’s <em> shivering </em> with it, the kind of magic Gellert has sought all his life.<br/>
<br/>
Albus who suddenly talks without pause as though he has been waiting - he practically <em> bursts </em> with held-back ideas, complaints, theories and aggressions; he talks about his father and his mother, about Ariana, about Hogwarts and the backwardness of the wizarding world, the meticulously slow and erratic progress it has made over the years and how it will never be <em> enough </em> .<br/>
<br/>
“I know,” Gellert whispers into the humid air at the graveyard; he takes a step closer, then another one, his gaze fastened on Albus the whole time. “I <em> know </em> .”<br/>
<br/>
Albus looks at him, smiling crookedly and something in Gellert snaps into place.</p>
