          <div class="userstuff"><p>“Two isn’t such a scary number,” Harry had consoled after the Healer left their room. “We’ll make this work. I promise. We’ll <em>cope</em>. Ron and Hermione have two babies… She’s Deputy Minister. This is good news, love.” </p><p>Draco couldn’t reply at first. </p><p>Their positive pregnancy potion still sat, glowing a vibrant blue on the table in front of them.</p><p>~@~</p><p><em>Another baby</em>. </p><p>A newborn to deal with whilst Scorpius still hadn’t mastered a full-night’s sleep. Draco had hoped to return to university, perhaps gain a Potioneer’s Licence. Instead he’ll be changing nappies, running baths and singing <em>The Owl and the Pussycat</em> and all the while he’ll be <em>lonely</em>, waiting for that magical moment when Harry flooed back to him. </p><p>Twenty-four, and a stay-at-home father of two. This wasn’t the life Draco had dreamt of, or planned for. </p><p>Draco had known, of course. He’d known he was pregnant before their appointment, before their test. He’d known from the first bout of morning-sickness. From the moment his favourite coffee made him feel nauseated. But worst was the exhaustion: Draco felt like he could sleep for a decade and not feel any benefit. </p><p>True, they’d both been lazy about contraception. </p><p>It had taken months to get pregnant with Scorpius. Scheduled sex. Fertility potions that had scalded his throat and left Draco silently sobbing and venomously furious. Scans and specialists and consultation after <em>bloody</em> consultation. The idea that another baby could just decide to grow; unbidden, unplanned for, had seemed farcical. <em>Comical</em>. Yet here they both were. </p><p>It's not even one year later, and they’re back at the Paternity Department of St. Mungos; a new Potter-Malfoy growing, <em>flourishing</em> inside Draco. </p><p>“Your body was primed for pregnancy,” the Healer had said. “Still very fertile.”</p><p>Draco had watched as their Healer had cast their Sonograph Spell. Watched a the sparkles of blue-grey magic had twisted and twirled, forming into the image of their baby. </p><p>“Twelve weeks, or thereabouts. The size of a plum,” said the Healer, smiling. “Heartbeat is very strong. Let me give you both a moment to digest your news.”</p><p>~@~</p><p>“We’re going to be alright,” Draco said eventually. “Another baby Potter-Malfoy. Perhaps two isn’t such a scary number after all.”</p></div>
