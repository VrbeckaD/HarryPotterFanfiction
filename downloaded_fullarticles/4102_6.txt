    <p>
  <span>After the war had ended and the trial was over, Draco Malfoy was content in not having to see Potter ever again. He went on to study the medical practice and eventually became a full-on healer. He'd learned a powerful concealment charm and a notice-me-not so that the dark mark wasn't visible. Now, three years later, he was at the top of his field, but of course, Potter had to ruin that for him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco walked into the office when he was informed that he had someone in a room waiting for him. "My shift is almost over." He mentioned, trying not to sound like he was whining. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Just this one person," his partner, Pansy explained. She joined him in learning to become a Healer as well. "Then you can get out of here." She gave a wicked smile that was more of character for her than anything else she had done since their seventh year. "I hear that he's a special case." </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He was about to give her a few choice words when Haley Abernathy- head healer- walked in. "Healer Malfoy, Can you take the case?" He knew that it wasn't a question, it was a demand. He didn't dare question her, lest he gets written up.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Yes, Healer Abernathy." He seethed, snatching the file from her. As he walked to the room on the file, he looked it over. A curse wound, which he seemed to be the expert in. He rolled his eyes. The strange thing was that there was no name. Usually, it was right at the top of the paper, along with their age, allergies and blood type. This time, it was just blank. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The curse itself seemed extensive enough; it was designed to keep a wound open so that the victim would bleed to death, but if cut off fast enough, it could just be forced to be in one spot, like an arm or leg. Merlin forbids it actually be cut off at the torso because it could make its way inside the body then there's no way to stop it. When he walked in, still looking at the chart, he began his speech of, "Hello, I'll be attending to you today. My name is Healer-"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Malfoy?" He jumped slightly upon hearing his name. Looking up, his surprise was quickly dwindled by the overbearing irritation. His hair was still as much an unruly mess, but his skin looked slightly pale compared to its usual dark tone. His emerald green eyes still held the look that took Draco's breath away. It was like he was looking into Draco's soul with how sharp they were. The only thing really different was how well built he was. He bulked up well in the years, filling out his Auror robes in a way that made Malfoy's mouth water. His crimson red robes were cut off on his right arm, which had fresh cuts circling his flesh like a grotesque snake. From what Draco was seeing, every few minutes the wound would bleed again, in the path circling his arm and he would tense. This time, he let his head fall to the pillow he was sitting against. His face was darker around his cheeks and his knees were raised to his chest as he winced. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Potter? What are you doing here?" He looked up with a scathing look before his eyes flicked to the wound wrapping around his own arm. "Right." He felt himself getting warm from embarrassment. Of course, he would be here at a hospital so he could get help. Shaking himself, he walked closer, looking at the wound. Pulling up a chair, he looked it over. "How did this happen?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>With his other hand, Potter made some kind of vague motion. "The fucking Neo-Death Eater was attacking people, so I jumped in the way."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"That's the least logical thing to do." He mentioned, feeling Potter's eyes scowling at him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"It was either that or let this," he pointed to his arm, "Happen to a child." Draco kept his eyes on the wound, feeling foolish. He said something stupid and it was like their First year all over again. "Can remove this? It's kind of a problem." Draco watched as something that looked black went along the line of his wound, making it bleed again and Potter tensed as his head snapped back to the bed again, his cheeks turning a defined shade of pink. It was like there was something alive inside of his arm running through his arm. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Did you hear the curse that was being performed?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"No, or else I would know the counter curse." Draco rolled his eyes, looking at the wound still. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Have you tried to use any other counter curses to try and stop it?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"No, I just assumed I couldn't do anything and came here." Draco's fingers tightened with anger. He never had this problem before, but Potter just got under his skin. It was too late that he let go, though, because his hands were around the wounded arm, thumbs pressing into the wound. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Potter's eyes widened as he tensed, his mouth falling open as a strange sound fell out of him. Before Draco could process what that sound was, Potter pulled away, body raised in defence. Draco just hurt a patient. "Shit. Potter, I'm- I'm sorry. I don't know-" He put his hands in his hair, no doubt making a mess of it. He took a few deep breaths, trying t calm himself before turning to Potter, whose eyes were glassy as he held his hand to his chest spreading blood on his robes. "Can I just do this without the comments? I want to get out of here and I'm sure you don't like having your arm mutilated every few seconds." Potter held out his arm as Draco walked closer, but he kept his legs to his chest. He was almost acting like a frightened child. "Thank you." He pulled out his wand, trying a few counter curses but nothing seemed to work. When he noticed that Potter was paling, he went to the cabinet and pulled out a potion. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"What's this?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"A blood Replenishing Potion. You're losing a lot of blood."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Right." He took it with a shaking hand and drank it, the colour filling his cheeks again. Draco went back to trying everything he could think of. When nothing seemed to be working, he let out a frustrated sigh. Potter shifted and Draco gained an eyeful of what caused him to understand at once why he was trying to keep his knees to his chest. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"This may hurt," he warned, and Potter looked away. He pressed a thumb carefully to the wound and Potter's fist tensed and his face turned red. Realization dawned on Draco nearly instantly. "I'm going to be completely professional about this, Potter." This gained the attention of the attention of the other male, "Are you hard?" He reacted faster than Draco could process, jumping away from the bed and standing, pulling out his wand. Draco raised his hands to show that he wasn't armed and stood. "There's nothing wrong with that. It's a biological reaction. It may even be caused by the curse. I don't know that."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Potter raised his wand and Draco tensed, but all he did was point it at the door, which made it slam. He heard the door lock and realized that he was stuck in a room with Potter. "You-" His eyes were scanning the room as if trying to make sure he wasn't in danger, "You will tell no one about this."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"doctor-patient confidentiality. I'm legally not allowed to tell anyone. And if I do, who would believe me?" That didn't placate him, but he relaxed his shoulders slightly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Just... can you fix this so I can go home?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I have an idea of what it is now, so I think I can."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"So what is it?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"First, I have to know. Is it the curse that's making you like that or not?" It took a moment of Potter being pink in the cheeks before he shook his head, almost too short for Draco to see it. "Okay, so I believe it may be a bloodletting curse, for which, you'll need a potion and a spell to fix." Draco made a stupid move by turning his back to Potter. He hoped that he had enough Gryffindor in him not to attack from behind. He grabbed the right potion, then turned, instructing Potter to sit. When Potter drank the potion. Draco did the incantation and the blood stopped flowing in its tracks. "You'll need to stay here for a while so that the wound can be healed." He nodded stiffly, knees to his chest, not looking anywhere but the bed. "How long has it been like that?" Draco asked, pushing his luck.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Like what?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Masochism?" Potter turned a bright pink colour, eyes snapping to looking at the window opposite of where Draco was. "It's not anything to be ashamed of. I've dealt with this before." He lied. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Have you?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Sure. I've been working here for a year and a half. You learn a lot about a person when they're bloody or broken or have things where they shouldn't be." Potter turned even darker at that, keeping his eyes anywhere but Draco. To keep his hands busy, Draco began to wrap a bandage around the wound, though it wasn't necessary. The bandage was only there for wounds that were cursed not to heal. It was enchanted to numb the pain while it was on. Of course, it was spell activated, but Potter didn't know that. Making conversation- he didn't know why he didn't want to just leave- Draco asked, "So how are you and the female weasel?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Potter tensed for a moment, then looked down. "We broke up. She's with some Hufflepuff ponce now." </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Why?" He asked before he could stop himself. Potter looked up as if the heavens could give him the proper answer. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Similar interest."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Wouldn't that be a reason to stay together?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Similar interest in people." It all made perfect sense. The anger, the suspicion, the stalking, saving him, defending him. It was all his own confused way to work through his feelings. Or maybe it wasn't. Potter did believe that he was a death eater when no one else did. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You're bent." It wasn't a question. Draco knew the answer. "I would never have suspected," Draco tried, his voice high, "I mean, with how much the Weaslet was all over you and you her."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Potter shifted, looking quite uncomfortable. "Can I go now?" He asked impatiently. Draco nodded, reaching out to help him stand. He had lost a lot of blood and the replenishing potion only did so much. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I could help you, you know?" Potter's head snapped up to meet Draco's eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Help with what?" He asked eyes squinted in suspicion. Draco just pretended he hadn't heard the other man.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I mean if pain and humiliation really is a thing you like. I've had my fair share of kinks that people like." Potter flushed as he took Draco's hand as he stood. Draco took a deep breath. If he did something wrong, he could end up at the wrong end of Potters wand, or worse, fired for misconduct. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Steeling himself, he bit his cheek to keep from smiling a he looked up at Potter's face. Draco put a hand on Potter's hip, his thumb making a lazy path up and down the clothed skin of his hip. "Malfoy what are you-" When he roughly pressed his thumb into the patch of skin at Potter's pelvis, the Auror nearly crumbled and threw his head back. While Potter pressed against the bed, Draco stepped forward, pressing his body against Potter. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco could feel Potter's hard on pressing against his leg, so he pressed into it with his knee, sliding his thigh against it. Without warning, Potter grabbed the back of his hair and pulled him into a searing kiss of clashing teeth and escaped moans. With both hands, Draco squeezed his hips as hard as he could and Potter started to rut against his thigh. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco found himself shoving his hands into Potter's robes to dig his nails into the bare skin causing Potter to pull away and moan into the air. "Malfoy, I-I need-" Draco felt satisfaction knowing he had the power to bring the Boy-Who-Lived to this deprived state.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"What do you need?" Draco pushed his hips up against Potter as he reached up and scraped his nails hard against Potter, causing his eyes to roll back and his hips to falter. "Tell me what you want Potter."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Fuck me. Jesus Merlin fuck."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I don't think I should." Draco leaned down to Potter's neck, licking a stripe on the skin. He scraped his teeth against him and when he bit down roughly, Potter's hips snapped forward. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Potter was reduced to mumbling incoherently, the only thing Draco could make out was him occasionally begging. "Please, please, please." Draco felt his erection pressing into Potter's hip. Draco pulled away, pulling Potter to the window sill. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"If you want to stop, let me know." He ripped Potter's robes off revealing a round scar in the centre of his chest. He couldn't think about that now, as the only thing that he was really going to pay attention to was getting Potter out of his clothes, then getting inside of Potter. Before he actually had the chance to do much of anything past getting Potter down to his underclothes, Potter pushed back, dropping to his knees with a devious smile. Draco took off his shirt as Potter pushed the cloth of his pants down. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco threw his head back as wet heat encased him. His hand found Potter's head and he looked down. Testing him, Draco pushed Potter's head down further, watching the man's eyes flutter closed. Gripping Potter's hair, he used it to force Potter to take him all in until a gagging noise made him pull back. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He was taking in ragged breaths that made Draco's dick twitch, so he pushed Potter's head back down. He was amazed that Potter was so pliant under his hand. He shifted his hips up and all Potter did be brace his hand against the bed. Pulling Potter's hair tighter, he began to shift his hips forward and basked in the sounds that the other was making. He knew he was pushing it, but it became almost addicting to see what Potter would let him do. Draco began to push his hips harder, listening to Potter gagging on his dick. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He pulled completely away, listening to Potter rake in breaths. "Up." He pulled Potter by the hair as he stood, eyes half-lidded and face flushed. Potter pressed against the window as Draco stripped his completely, shoving his hips up to gain better access. Draco barely pulled out of himself enough to lock the door and close the curtain just in case. He was about to summon something he could use as lube but then had an idea. "Open your mouth." When Potter obeyed, he felt his dick twitch again. He roughly shoved two fingers in, wiggling them around. Potter moaned, making a noise as he pulled them out. He didn't waste time lowering his hand to the tight entrance. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Without waiting, he began to push his fingers in, watching Potter's face contorted in pleasure. Oh, if he could take a picture with his eyes... he could definitely invest in a pensieve just to watch this again. when he added a second finger, Potter tensed around him, his hands shooting to grab Draco's arms. "Do it. Just fuck me already." Draco grinned again. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You have to beg for it." He wrapped his legs around Draco, pulling him closer and wrapping his arms around his neck. He kissed Draco in a way that made the Healer feel like he was being devoured. Teeth and tongue became part of the kiss; a carnal display that Draco had never seen before in anyone, let alone his childhood rival. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Please, Malfoy." His voice was rough and strained, probably from Draco using his mouth as a fuck toy. Potter pulled away, crystalline emerald eyes locked onto Draco's silvery ones. "Please fuck me, Draco." He felt heat rise in his cheeks at the use of his name. It sounded so foreign coming from Potter. He pulled Potter to the hospital bed and lined himself with Potter. Grabbing onto Potter's hips, he pushed forward slightly. Potter liking pain aside, it was really dangerous to push it without enough preparation. Not to mention that they weren't using proper lube, but rather basically just water. "Draco, please-" His hips jerked forward, pushing himself into the tight opening. A loud moan ripped it's way out of Potter's chest and he tensed. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You have to relax, or I won't be able to-" He groaned as Potter's insides fluttered around him, before relaxing. Slowly- achingly slow- he pushed in until his hips touched Potter's. It took a moment of Potter breathing heavy and gripping the sheets in his hands so tight that his knuckles were pale before he nodded. Draco pulled out slightly and pushed back in. He rotated his hips in small circles until they slowly started to get larger. Potter said something so he leaned down to hear it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Harder." Draco pulled his hips out almost all the way, before shoving them in again. as soon as his hips touched Potters, he pulled out again. With rough, fluid motions, he fucked into Potter, listening to him moaning and gasping. He was rolling his hips as Draco pushed in. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He reached down, but Draco snapped, "Hands off." So he shot his hands up, grabbing onto the railing of the bed. He grabbed Potter, stroking him roughly. He wanted it to last much longer, but he was still technically on his shift and the longer they did this, the more likely that someone would come in wondering where he was. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He stroked Potter in time with his thrusts, making him writhe on the bed. With his other hand, he dug his nails into Harry's backside, causing his eyes to pop open as he arched his back, moaning out as he came, body twitching. Draco could only manage a few more thrusts before he was emptying himself inside of Potter with a groan, shifting his hips as he did. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>When he pulled out, Potter had his eyes closed and Draco watched as his come leaked out as his body shook. He grabbed his wand, cleaning up everything and helping dress Potter after putting himself away. He helped Potter stand, but it seemed his limbs weren't working correctly. He was shaking and couldn't stand straight. He walked with Potter all the way out to the street. Draco pulled out a card and the address of his flat. "If there are any..." He thought for a moment. What would the right word be? "Complications... feel free to contact me." Potter took it and apparated away. Draco walked back inside and signed out for the day gaining a look from his partner. "What?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I suppose it was a complicated matter, that patient." He took a slow breath. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Yea. It was a bloodletting curse that I couldn't figure out how to get rid of it."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Is that why he was so shaken as he walked out?" She looked at him with a lecherous grin. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Blood loss." She snorted and turned around, so he signed out. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"And I suppose those scratch marks are because of blood loss, too." He tensed as he looked at her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"How did you..." Her grin widened and he immediately knew that he had been played. "You are a foul, evil woman Pansy Parkinson." She laughed as he walked out.</span>
