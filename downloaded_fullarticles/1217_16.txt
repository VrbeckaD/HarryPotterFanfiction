The Ossuary<br/>
Essex County, UK<br/>
Just Past Midnight</p><p>It was over, it was over and she and the girls were still alive!  Amelia was still having a hard time believing that Voldemort was lying dead in the entryway in front of her, and all of his Death Eaters were lying beside him, just as dead.   She had sworn when she recognized Lucius Malfoy and his son Draco among the attackers, and several of them had been among the ones captured at the Ministry just a few weeks before, including the Lestrange brothers. There was no sign of Bellatrix though, which concerned her, that witch was far more dangerous than her husband or brother-in-law.  </p><p>It could have been very different if Harry and Auror Tonks hadn't appeared and turned the tide of battle because she'd been so worried about getting Susan and Hannah to safety that Voldemort's spells were starting to overwhelm her.  It could have been her and the girl's bodies laying there, after who knows how many hours of being raped and tortured?   She'd been at the scene of far too many attacks in the first war to have any illusions of what they would have done to the three of them.   She'd been ready to kill the girls herself to spare them that fate! </p><p>But Harry and her Auror had arrived, and it was the enemy who had been overwhelmed.   And now she had to talk to the young man, and find out how he knew they needed help.  The floo had been disabled and the alarm wards wouldn't have alerted him in any case, even if they hadn't been bypassed.  She still needed to find out how that happened!  But that could wait until morning, the first priority was making sure that Susan and Hannah were going to be alright, and then finding a place to stay for the night.  There was too much damage done to the Ossuary for them to be able to stay, at least until repairs were done.</p><p>"Shite!  Boss, I think you need to see this," Auror Tonks' voice cut through her thoughts, and Amelia turned toward where she was standing, looking down at one of the bodies.   As soon as she saw the unmasked face, she understood exactly what had her Auror so unhappy.   Corbin Yaxley was an Auror, second only to Rufus Scrimgeour in the chain of command, and they'd never even suspected he was a Death Eater!  That was a very likely reason they were able to bypass her wards since the codes to allow her Aurors access were a very closely held secret, and he would have been one of those who were in the know.   She and her Auror shared a look, they would need to examine every single member of the department to find out if there were any more moles, this could not be allowed to stand! </p><p>It was only when she was standing next to her Auror and Tonks bent down to remove the mask off of another corpse, Antonin Dolohov this time, that Amelia noticed the woman was completely nude under her robes, except for a collar around her throat.  It was immediately apparent why she and Harry had arrived together, and for some reason, after the excitement of the evening, and the relief at being alive and well, it struck her as amusing and she sniggered. </p><p>When Tonks looked up at her in confusion, she leaned over and said with a smirk, “Did you forget part of your uniform this evening, Auror?”</p><p>The woman looked down and saw that the robe had fallen open, and blushed furiously, starting to stammer something, but Amelia just waved it off, "Don't worry about it, although I'm sure there's one hell of a story to tell.  If the reason the two of you were able to get here so quickly is that you were already together, doing whatever, I'm not going to complain about the results.  Although I would ask that you cover back up, Susan already has a bit of a crush on you, and that's a bit more of a complication than I need right now." </p><p>"Uh, yes Boss, sure, no problem," Tonks said, straightening her robes so she was covered again. </p><p>"I am going to want to know about the collar though, Auror, because I want to make sure that whatever bond you swore won't interfere with your duties." </p><p>Tonks shook her head emphatically, "It won't, Madame Bones, I can swear to that.  It's something that I had to do, a Family Magic requirement, for my mum and me to be brought back into the Black Family.  Harry is the head of the family now and other than the obvious, which is completely consensual by the way, he doesn't give any orders at all." </p><p>Amelia nodded, “That sounds like him, from what Susan and Hannah have described over the years, the two of them were already practically hero worshiping him, and now that he's saved our lives...”</p><p>She trailed off as she realized that's exactly what happened, and what it would likely mean for all three of them.   Before Tonks could ask her a question, she said, “Tell me one thing, Tonks,”  and when the Auror looked at her, she continued in a quieter voice, “Is he any good?”</p><p>Whatever Tonks was expecting, that was apparently not it, the woman blinked in surprise, before a suspicious look crossed her face, “I'm sorry, Madame Bones, but what difference does that make?  As a matter of fact, he wasn't a virgin the first time we were together, and he's grown into an amazing lover.  Does that satisfy your prurient curiosity?” </p><p>Amelia was surprised that the woman actually was about to get angry, whether at the question, or the implied criticism of her Head of the Family Amelia didn't know.  Putting her hands up placatingly, she said, "The only reason I asked is that I realized that with Harry saving our lives tonight, the three of us owe him a life debt, and you know how those are repaid at the level of our Houses.  I wanted to make sure that Susan and Hannah would enjoy the experience, that's all." </p><p>For some reason, that seemed to amuse Tonks, and she was the one to smirk, “Just the two girls Boss, what about you? He saved your life as well, didn't he?”</p><p>She shrugged, “I doubt he'd be interested in my dried up old carcass, but if he wants me, I won't say no.”</p><p>Tonks chuckled, “I wouldn't worry about that, age doesn't seem to matter much to Harry, trust me!  As long as he likes the woman and she's willing, he won't turn you down.”</p><p>“Oh? He's been busy, has he?”</p><p>The chuckle turned into a laugh, “You could say that, but those aren't my stories to tell.  I will say that I have a very different picture of Molly Weasley than I had before, and leave it at that!”</p><p>Amelia froze in shock for a moment, giving Tonks a chance to slip away and join Harry looking at the other bodies, and by the time she had recovered, the Auror was all business.  They had identified Severus Snape's body among the dead.  Amelia groaned that was going to stir up a major shit-storm since everybody was going to remember Dumbledore's defense of the man at his first trial.   It might even be enough to get the old man bounced out of his multiple positions, which really wouldn't be such a bad thing, he'd had power for far too long. </p><p>By this time, the 'rapid response team' of Aurors had finally arrived, and her glare at Dawlish told him he wasn't going to enjoy the debriefing the next morning.  The battle had started nearly a half an hour before, and they were just now showing up?  That was absolutely unacceptable!  But she kept her anger under control and let them do their jobs, moving to Susan and Hannah while the Aurors gathered the bodies.</p><p>The two girls were looking remarkably calm, which surprised her, and she sat down next to them on the couch.   Putting up a muffling spell, she said: "You two did really well, I'm proud of you, I know it couldn't have been easy." </p><p>Susan shook her head, “Actually it wasn't that difficult, Harry had drilled us in fighting tactics the last week of school in the DA, using what he and the others had learned at the Ministry that night.  After all the training it was almost instinct, although I was very glad to see Harry show up when he did!”</p><p>Hannah nodded, “Damn right!  Even with all the training, I was starting to get tired and that wouldn't have been a good thing, at all!”</p><p>“How do you feel, knowing that you probably are responsible for a few of the deaths?  I know that even trained Aurors have difficulties the first time they kill someone.”</p><p>Susan frowned, “At the moment it doesn't bother me, Harry made all of us aware that stunning them doesn't work, they wouldn't be trying to stun us, after all.   I'll probably have nightmares though, but a cuddle with Hannah will help with that.”</p><p>Hannah moved closer, her arm around Susan, and her niece smiled, holding the other girl tightly.  Amelia wasn't surprised at just how close the two girls were, she remembered her days in the Sett quite well, and she'd rarely slept alone after her second year. But seeing how open the girls were about it was a bit of a surprise.  She didn't say anything though, just nodded in understanding.    But she did need to make sure they were aware of what was likely to happen.  Clearing her throat she said, "You know that we all owe Harry a life debt, don't you?  If he and Auror Tonks hadn't arrived when they did, we would have been overwhelmed." </p><p>Hannah nodded, “Susan and I were actually talking about it, and we're both kind of looking forward to it, we've both admitted to finding him attractive, and the way he brought Cedric back last year, and how he worked so hard to train us when Umbridge was causing so many problems, well, he's practically a Hufflepuff hiding in Gryffindor!”</p><p>Amelia chuckled, "I'm sure he would love to hear that you think he's loyal and hard-working enough to be a 'Puff, even though he did have the misfortune not to be sorted properly.  But, you really aren't worried about the life debt?" </p><p>Susan shook her head, "He's Harry, he'd never do anything to hurt either of us, and from a letter, I got from Luna, he's even able to satisfy two girls at the same time, and that's something we really want to find out for ourselves!" </p><p>Hannah giggled, “Especially some of the things that Luna told her they did together, I really want to try them for myself!”   Susan looked at her friend with amusement, shaking her head, and Amelia wasn't sure she really wanted to know, but if she was going to find out for herself she'd better ask.</p><p>"Care to explain that comment, Hannah?   It seems that Susan knows what you are talking about, and I'm curious since I owe him my life as well." </p><p>Hannah blushed a little and shot Susan a pleading look, and Susan said, “What Hannah was referring to, is that Luna was quite enthusiastic about the experience of being buggered.  She said that it was almost as good as the first four or five times he had her the regular way that night.   Hannah's always been fascinated with the idea, she's even got some 'interesting' toys from Lilith's that she has me use on her at times.”</p><p>"Putting aside the buggering, although this Luna is right, if it's done properly it's an amazing experience, but did she really say that they had sex four or five times in one night?  And there was another girl there at the same time?   He's got to be extremely powerful to have that kind of stamina." She paused, shaking her head, "He just killed bloody Voldemort, of course, he's powerful!  That was a stupid statement." </p><p>Looking over at Harry, she saw that the Proudfoot had finished interviewing him, and they were gathering up the bodies to transport to the morgue.  But now Harry was arguing with Dawlish, and knowing what the Auror was like, she dropped the muffling spell and stood up, walking toward them.</p><p>“...And I'm going to do it, I don't give a rat's arse what Fudge's orders are, you know as well as I do that he's going to be lucky to escape Azkaban for the shite Umbridge pulled on his orders!  And considering I just saved your boss's life while you were polishing Fudge's knob, who do you think she's going to back?”</p><p>Dawlish was getting red in the face and Amelia could see that he was about to go for his wand, which would be an incredibly stupid move on his part.  The arse was already looking at being suspended for the delay in responding, did he really want to make things worse?   Catching Harry's eye, she made sure he saw her drawing her wand and loudly said, “Auror Dawlish, stand down!  I don't know what you thought you were doing, but you need to remember, you currently work for me, not Minister Fudge.”  Lowering her voice, she said, “Lord Black, can you explain what is going on?”</p><p>Dawlish interrupted, "This kid was demanding that he remove You Know Who's head, as proof he is actually dead when the Minister gave a direct order that he be present for any announcement like that!" </p><p>Amelia stared at the man, her own temper rising, and she forced it down, holding out her hand, “Your badge, Dawlish, you are dismissed!   You can go see if the soon to be ex-Minister needs an arse kisser now that Umbridge is going to Azkaban, but you aren't working for me any longer!   You were already on probation for the attack on Dumbledore, let alone the mess with Hagrid, and now this?   Give me your badge, I'll have your belongings packed up and sent to you.”  When the man didn't move, she stepped forward, “Now, Dawlish!”</p><p>The man fumbled with his robes and managed to pull the badge off and handed it to her, before practically running out of the house.   She could see a few of the team smothering grins and deliberately ignored them, turning to the next senior, Proudfoot and said, “Auror Proudfoot, I need you to take a message to Senior Auror Hammer that I've dismissed Dawlish for cause, effective immediately, and will brief her when I arrive in the morning.”</p><p>He nodded and tapped his badge with his wand, activating the department portkey.</p><p>“Auror Tonks, take control of the squad and finish what needs to be done, I need to speak to Lord Black for a few minutes.”   Tonks nodded and started directing the team in preparing the bodies.  While she was doing that, Harry was standing over Voldemort's body and, with a quick cutting curse, removed the Dark Lord's head.  Leaving the body where it lay, he conjured a box and put the head inside it, casting a stasis charm on the box before shrinking it down and putting it in the pocket of his robes.</p><p>With a tired smile, he turned to her, “You wanted to talk to me Madame Bones?”</p><p>She chuckled, “I think, since you saved all of our lives tonight, not to mention killing the dark bastard, you can call me Amelia, Lord Black.”</p><p>“Harry please, I'm still getting used to the title, I've only had it a couple of weeks.  But what did you want to talk about, Amelia?”</p><p>"A couple of things, first of all, I'm acknowledging that Susan, Hannah and I all owe you life debts, and are ready to pay those debts in the time-honored manner." </p><p>He nodded, “That's something we can discuss this evening, we're all too tired to be clear headed, but I'm not rejecting the offer, just postponing it until we get some sleep.   What else?”</p><p>“How did you know that I was under attack?  I wasn't able to get a call out, and my alert wards only sounded in the Ministry, so how?”</p><p>He grinned, "I've got a friendly contact who was close to the Death Eaters, and she sent me a message as soon as she could this evening, which unfortunately was after the Death Eaters had left.   She's going to be thrilled that she's a widow since it was her husband who kissed the hem of Tom's robes." </p><p>Amelia's eyes widened as she realized what he was saying, her mind racing over the faces of the dead bodies, and she gasped, “You've seduced Narcissa Malfoy?  How the bloody hell did you manage that?”</p><p>“It wasn't that difficult, actually,” he smiled, not even attempting to deny it, “She despised her husband and Draco was an irritant to her for the last several years, and Lucius getting arrested and publicly identified as a Death Eater was the last straw for her.   Besides, she was very glad to renew her acquaintance with her sister and niece once I brought them back into the family.”</p><p>Amelia's lip twitched slightly in amusement, after what Tonks, Susan, and Hannah had said, the implied incest between Narcissa and Andromeda didn't surprise her in the slightest.  And considering that Andromeda was even older than she was, it looked like she was going to end up in Harry's bed after all. She did wonder how Arthur Weasley and Ted Tonks felt about things, though? </p><p>She just raised an eyebrow at him, “You have been busy, haven't you, Lord Black?”</p><p>He laughed, shaking his head, "You actually have no idea, and not just with what you are implying, although I'm not going to deny that I've spent a lot of very pleasurable time with different ladies.  There was a lot more than just that going on, which I'll be happy to sit down and discuss with you because part of it actually has an impact on your department.   </p><p>“But we can do that later, we need to get you three to a safe place, at least until the wards are repaired.   I've got plenty of room where I am staying, and the wards are practically impenetrable if you aren't given permission.   Not to mention it's under the Fidelus, so all of you will be perfectly safe for the time being.”</p><p>"Thank you, Lord Black, that was something I was concerned about, just let me tell the girls to pack up what they need for a few days." </p><p>Harry shook his head, “Don't bother, I'll just have my elves gather everything, we need to get going.”<br/>
Looking over at Susan and Hannah, who were cuddling on the sofa, talking quietly, he called, “Hey you two, we're getting out of here, you can snuggle later!”   </p><p>The two of them just smiled and nodded, walking over to Amelia and Harry, hand in hand.   Harry pulled out a metal ring from his robes and tapped it with his wand, concentrating for a second until it glowed blue.   Looking directly at Amelia he said, “Until I can get the three of you added to the wards, you'll need to travel with me, the wards recognize my signature and will let you through.”</p><p>Amelia nodded, that was fairly standard, but she was impressed that somebody Harry's age was already able to create portkeys, it was beyond most adult wizards and witches.  When the three of them were touching the ring, Harry gripped it, and Amelia felt the typical yank behind her navel and was pulled out of the ruined remains of her home.</p><p> </p><p>* * * </p><p>12 Grimmauld Place<br/>
A Few Moments Later</p><p>The four of them arrived into a mass of confusion, and Amelia scowled, her magic was rebelling against being wherever she was!  But then Harry whispered in her ear “Harry Potter's home is Number 12, Grimmauld Place,” and everything came into focus.  She watched the girls relax as Harry shared the secret with them as well, and felt herself relaxing as well.</p><p>The first thing she noticed, looking around, was the number of women coming into the entryway.  She recognized Narcissa and Andromeda of course and Molly Weasley, and she's seen several of the girls when she'd had to visit Hogwarts.  She was a bit surprised, based on what she'd heard, that all of the women were dressed properly, she'd almost expected to walk into a house full of nude women. </p><p>While she was looking around, and Susan and Hannah were greeting the girls they were friendly with, she saw Harry giving orders to several elves although she wondered what he was talking about when he told the oldest looking one that Regulus's last order was completed?  Whatever it meant, the elf sure seemed happy to hear it.  The elves all looked over at her and the girls before popping away.   </p><p>At this point, she smelled something delicious coming from the kitchen, and her stomach rumbled loudly.  Harry looked over and grinned, “Yeah, it has been hours since we ate, and fighting does build up the appetites, let's get you fed.”</p><p>Harry led them into the kitchen, where a woman Amelia didn't recognize was slicing up a loaf of freshly baked bread, and her mouth started watering at the smell and sight.  She'd always loved the smell of baking, even when she was a little girl, and she couldn't wait to get a taste.   She and girls were shown to seats, where there was a bowl of a thick beef stew sitting in front of each of their places.  She could see that Susan and Hannah were just as affected by the smells as she was, and all three of them were soon eating as fast as they politely could.  It was delicious!</p><p>As she was finishing, using a hunk of the bread to wipe up the last of the stew, Amelia looked up and saw Harry with his arms around one of the women she didn't recognize, although he called her Petunia, and she remembered hearing that was the name of Lily Potter's sister, but the way he kissed the woman made her doubt it was the same woman.    Movement next to her made her turn in her seat, and she saw Molly Weasley sliding into the chair next to her, a warm smile on her face.  “I'm so glad that Harry got the message in time to save you and the girls, we knew that Riddle was going to attack somewhere, but we couldn't find out where.  Snape was just as useless as Dumbledore, naturally, so we had to depend on Narcissa getting word to us in time.”</p><p>Amelia gave a tired smile, “I'm very glad she did, it got hairy for a few minutes there, but Harry and Tonks arrived just in time, fortunately.  But, I'm sorry if I'm being rude, but why are you and Ginny here and not the rest of your family?  I know why the girls and I are here, and I'm actually looking forward to it, now that I've had a chance to relax, but it seems out of character for you.”</p><p>Molly frowned, "I can see why you'd say that because you really never got to see my true personality.  It's a very long story, and we can talk about it later, but the Weasley family didn't like the fact that I have an extremely healthy sex drive, as does Arthur, and they put a geas on the two of us when we first got married, to make us behave according to their morals, the bloody arses!   It was only when Arthur's grandfather died a few months ago that it started to fade away, which made for several fantastic days and nights as we made up for lost time, by the way," she gave a quick grin, "But then we realized the massive life debts that the family owed Harry, both for rescuing Ginny, and then saving Arthur's life when Nagini bit him before Christmas.  The two of us, and Ginny, of course, discussed how to repay the debts, and this is what we came up with. Ginny is actually going to be the consort for the Potter Family, he's already chosen his Lady Potter, of course, and I'm going to belong to Harry until they go back to school in September. Harry agreed naturally, and here we are.  It's been a lot of fun so far. Especially when Harry had both of us while Arthur watched, I think I came harder that time than I had in ages!" </p><p>Amelia choked on her drink, “Arthur actually is fine with this? With you having sex with Lord Black?”</p><p>Molly shrugged, "Of course, the debt needed to be paid, and it's not like I've never had sex with another man with Arthur's knowledge before.  He's taken plenty of girls to bed when I wasn't available, it's not a big deal.   We both love each other, that hasn't changed, but we've both got almost 20 years of enjoyment that we missed out on!  Arthur won't be neglected, of course, Tonks took care of him while Harry enjoyed Ginny and me before the two of us played with her.  And when Fleur heard about what was going on, she and Bill agreed that she could join us for the summer as well, since Harry saved both Fleur and her sister's lives during the Tri-Wizard."    </p><p>Amelia just shook her head, “I'm sorry, this is far too much for me to deal with right now!  My brain is about to shut down from all the surprises.”</p><p>Molly smiled sympathetically, "I understand, dear, believe me, it came as a shock to Ginny and me as well, but you do get used to it fairly quickly.  But we can talk more in the morning after you've had a chance to get cleaned up and get some sleep." </p><p>"Yeah, a bath and bed sound like an excellent idea, it's been a very long night!"    </p><p>Harry must have been paying attention to the conversation, because she soon found herself climbing up the stairs, Susan and Hannah right behind her.  The girls seemed more excited than shocked, and Amelia wondered who the blonde girl was that they had been talking to?   She had looked vaguely familiar, and she had seen the name Luna Lovegood as one of the students who was at the Ministry that night, maybe that was who she was?</p><p>She had been so distracted by what Molly had told her that she was barely paying attention by the time they reached the bathroom at the end of the hall.   She just saw the huge tub and smelled the oils wafting from the steaming water, and started stripping out of her filthy robes.  It was only when she had lowered herself into the water that she realized Susan and Hannah were in the water, just as naked as she was.   Amelia was far too tired to even worry about it, especially since they would probably end up spending a lot of time naked around each other anyway.   </p><p>Right now, she just enjoyed the feeling of Petunia washing her, not even caring that the woman was just as nude as she was, it just felt so good.   Susan and Hannah seemed to be enjoying the feeling of Ginny and Molly washing them just as much, so she just let her mind wander.   It wasn't until Petunia helped her to stand, and started rubbing a shaving soap over the hair between her legs that she started to be aware of herself again.  </p><p>She wanted to object to Petunia touching her like that, but her hand felt very nice rubbing her, and it just wasn't that important, especially when she saw that Molly and Ginny were doing the same thing to Susan and Hannah.    </p><p>She idly noticed that all three of the women were just as hairless, and realized that Harry probably preferred the women like that.   It wasn't that big a deal to her, she'd had lovers in the past who liked her hairless, and it did feel nice.   But then Petunia shocked her by placing a kiss directly on her naked lips, and ran her tongue along her opening!  She hadn't been expecting that, and, judging from the gasps of Susan and Hannah, they hadn't expected it either.  But when Petunia kept licking her, it just felt too good to even try and stop the woman, and she just leaned against the wall and enjoyed the feelings!</p><p>She looked around and saw Ginny on her knees in front of Hannah, while Molly had her tongue deep inside Susan, who was already crying out happily from the experience.   It was interesting to see the girl who was practically her daughter having an orgasm, followed shortly by Hannah doing the same thing.  Amelia wondered where her sense of outrage was?  In ordinary circumstances, she would be objecting to having a woman she didn't know touching her so intimately, let alone in the same room with the younger girls, but she just felt a mild curiosity.     </p><p>It was only when she felt her own peak rapidly approaching, and the way her magic was dancing around inside her that she realized what was going on.   Accepting the woman's attention pleased Harry, and it meant that she was acting to satisfy the debt she owed.  Once she understood that she wasn't being controlled by an outside force, Amelia relaxed and let the orgasm was over her, removing all the memories of the terror and tension from earlier that night.  It was with a contented smile that she let Petunia help her out of the tub and dry her off, barely registering that Ginny and Molly were doing the same thing with the girls before leading them out of the bathroom, still naked.   </p><p>Petunia took her by the hand and led her out after the girls, and she saw the other four going into a room down the hall and shutting the door behind them.  She opened the door that Petunia had guided her to, and was mildly impressed that all of her personal belongings were arranged around the room the same way she had them at home.   But then she turned and pulled Petunia into her arms, and started kissing the woman, tasting herself on the woman's lips, something she hadn't experienced in a long time.   She was sure that she would get used to the taste again fairly soon, as well as the flavors of the other women in the house.</p><p>Leading Petunia to the bed, the two of them were soon entwined together, but Amelia was far too tired to do anything more than just some light kissing.  With a murmured apology, she commanded the lights to dim, and soon was sound asleep, her arms still wrapped around the other woman.</p><p>End Chapter One</p>
