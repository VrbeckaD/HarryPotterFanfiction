    <p>"Hello. My name is Dr. Hall. You can just call me Susan."</p><p>The thin woman in front of him had large rim glasses and brown hair that went down to her shoulder. She was young, perhaps in her late 20s. Fresh out of med school probably. This woman was going to be his....therapist. </p><p>Don't get him wrong, therapy would've been really great if it weren't for the fact he was in a institution for mentally ill people. </p><p>An hour or two ago, the Dursleys made him come here. The Dursleys left him in an asylum for the summer after his fifth year cause they didn't want to deal with him. Of course they did, the overdramatic wankers.</p><p>Harry didn't want to be a dick to the orderlies by tryin to run away so he was kind of stuck. Maybe he should've ran when he saw the sign. But..... well..... something complied him to come in without a fuss. He didn't WANT to try to leave. Maybe it was the way uncle Vernon looked at him when he tried to argue about it or the way aunt Petunia was glaring at him when he tried to reason with her. Who knows?</p><p>The paperwork is done and now the Dursleys are gone. His school trunk is now his room and now he's stuck in here. In this room, with this stranger. </p><p>"Hi." Harry said before adding in a weird sounding, "Suuuusan."</p><p>"Let's talk about why you're here. Your Uncle and Aunt already filled me in on some of your issues but I would like to hear from you." Susan had a pen in her hand and a notepad in the other. </p><p>"Um...well....to be honest I didn't want to be here. A-actually, I didn't want know I was going to be here? It just kind of happened." Harry shrugged awkwardly. </p><p>"You did look suprised when I first saw you come in here. Well, at any rate, is there anything particularly bothering you?" Susan asked. </p><p>Memories of Cedric's corpse, Sirius falling through the veil, and writing those horrid words over and over again on his hand filled his head. </p><p>"Nope." Harry said, perhaps too quickly cause Susan was giving him a strange look. </p><p>Susan wrote something down. "Well, we don't have to get into all of it right now. I was informed of some stuff already and we can get into all that later." She frowned and looked up from her file. "We can talk about more basic stuff right now."</p><p>"Basic stuff?" Harry questioned. </p><p>"Like, who your friends are, your favorite color, etc. Whatever you feel is important to tell me." Susan explained. </p><p>"Um...o-ok." Harry shifted on the red couch. What to tell her?</p><p>"My favorite color is blue. My best friends are Hermione and... Ron. I had no idea I would be here today." Harry paused. What else to say?</p><p>"I heard from your uncle you been going to a boarding school since you were eleven?" Susan asked. </p><p>"Uh yeah. I do." Harry wondered what he told her about it. </p><p>"It sounds like a lovely place, though it is rather quirky." She smiled, as if lost in thought despite Harry knowing she was focused on him. </p><p>Harry giggled. "Yeah. It's.....cool."</p><p>"What's your favorite subject?" She asked and Harry froze. </p><p>Ok...shite. He bit his lip. </p><p>"Um....well.....maths. I'm good at maths." That wasn't a class he had but screw it. He could muggle-fy his other classes later. </p><p>"How about your other classes?" She asked writing down on the paper. </p><p>"Uh ok I guess. My grades are fine." Harry shifted on the couch. He didn't know why but he felt very awkward suddenly. </p><p>"Do you get into any trouble at your school?"</p><p>"I sneak around at night and get into some fights b-but I've been okay so far." He said. </p><p>"Do you get into a lot of fights?" Susan asked. </p><p>"Uh...kind of? I-I mean.... I'm just defending myself most of the time. There's this guy named Draco at my school and he's kind of a dick." People often called what they had a feud but sometimes Harry was just trying to live his life and Draco would not bloody leave him alone. </p><p>"Why don't you like him?" She asked, writing down something. </p><p>"He's a racist bitch b-baby who thinks he's b-better than m-me and my f-friends j-just c-cause he's r-rich." Harry felt anger surge through him suddenly. "H-he's l-l-literally evil! I h-hate h-him!"</p><p>"Harry, breathe with me." Susan took an exaggerated breath and Harry followed her example. The anger slowly fizzled and Harry felt calmer. </p><p>"Sorry." Harry said sheepishly.</p><p>"It's quite alright. Would you like to move on or would you like to tell me why you think he's evil?" Susan was writing down something. </p><p>"Uh....let's move on." Harry rubbed his neck. "Oh, I'm vegetarian, which was probably a bad idea. I'm so skinny already but you know. Tasting meat recently feels wrong."</p><p>"I've heard you have been not eating as much lately. Is that why?" Susan asked, a curious look on her face. </p><p>"Yeah. Well that's why I'm not eating beef at least. I've been eating other food but it's been kind of rough for me." Harry was referring to the fact the Dursleys rarely gave him food. Though sometimes he didn't even eat that. He's been kind of feeling like arse the last few months. </p><p>Susan nodded empathetically. "Is the food too much?" </p><p>Harry shrugged cause he had no idea what she meant by that. </p><p>"Anything else you want to tell me?" She asked. </p><p>"I....uh like musicals. My aunt used to take me to a bunch when I was younger. Matilda was a good one." </p><p>"Do you like your aunt?" Susan asked. </p><p>Memories of Aunt Petunia and him singing and baking together, and memories of her screaming at him and forcing him to clean up after the family filled his head. A twinge of guilt went through him as he told her, "No."</p><p>"Why is that?" Susan asked.</p><p>"She...... doesn't like me." Harry said, trying to keep his voice matter of fact about it. </p><p>"I'm sure she likes you Harry. What makes you think she doesn't?" The therapist asked gently.</p><p>"Did you look through my trunk?" Harry asked, trying change the subject. </p><p>"One of the orderlies is unpacking it right now. Why? Is there something you don't want me to see?" The therapist asked. </p><p>"I.....I was j-just wondering." Harry asked, trying to be casual. </p><p>"Hmm." Susan wrote something down on her notepad. </p><p>Harry leaned over to see what Susan was writing. He caught the words, "possible anorexia", "anxiety ticks",  "possible black and white thinking", and "anger problems" before she caught him staring. </p><p>"Don't worry about what I'm writing. They're just notes for myself." Harry just sat back down and glared. He wasn't anorexic! Nor did he have anger problems!</p><p>"Well, it looks like our time is up. Jay?" A bigger man appeared next to Harry and he nearly jumped out of his skin. Jesus Christ who was this gorilla man?</p><p>"Can you show him to his room?" The gorilla man nodded and touched Harry's shoulder.</p><p>Anxiety flared inside of Harry and he screamed, "Don't touch me!"</p><p>Both Jay and Susan were startled by this outburst. Harry felt warmth spread to his cheeks as he muttered an apology. </p><p>Susan wrote something down before saying, "At 2 tomorrow, we'll have your next session. I hope you have a good evening Harry." </p><p>Harry just nodded. This was gonna be a long summer.</p>
