          <div class="userstuff"><p>Remus was thinking about getting a new set of robes for school. His family wasn't the best off financially, but his parents had said he could get a treat for once. He picked out some that he really liked. </p><p>"Why do you have girl robes?" James Potter asked. </p><p>Remus rolled his eyes. "They're not." He pulled down the tags at the back to show him. "See? Unisex."</p><p>"Maybe you need sex," James crossed his arms. "I just had it this morning."</p><p>"No, James. U-N-I sex."</p><p>James blinked and dramatically placed a hand over his heart.</p><p>"Wow. Um. Remus I'm flattered but you know I'm with Evans. And I can't do that to Pads either. Sorry mate."</p><p>"..." Remus sighed. He shouldn't even have been surprised anymore. </p></div>
