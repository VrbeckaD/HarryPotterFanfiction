          <div class="userstuff"><p>Severus sits, slouched, his sleeves rolled and head tilted back. Fingers, not his own, trace the length of his left arm: pads soft, unaccustomed to hard work. A nail catches on the Mark: wound fresh, barely healed. He hisses.</p><p>Regulus pulls his hand away. “Sorry,” he says. Smiles. It’s lopsided, like he doesn’t really know <em>how.</em> Then, “Did it hurt?”</p><p>Severus snorts. “It’s a burn, Black. What do you think?”</p><p>Regulus ignores the question. “Don’t call me that,” he says instead: absentminded. Like a reflex. Severus hears what remains unspoken. That quiet, <em>It reminds me of my brother</em>.</p><p>He sighs.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>“It’s risky, isn’t it?” Regulus says. “I mean, if we get caught—”</p><p>A laugh cuts him off: loud, grating. Rosier’s grin twisted and deadly. “What are you,” he asks him, “<em>six?</em> Scared <em>Mummy</em> will get upset?”</p><p>He looks at Severus, as if expecting something. Backup, most likely. But Severus remains impassive: <em>watching</em>. He stares at Regulus, at the scowl he sends Rosier, at the way his eyes flicker, the way his mouth turns, the way he takes hold of his left arm.</p><p>The way he battles with temptation: that latent longing for the wicked mirrored in all of them.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>Regulus’ scream is instinctive: mouth open even before the Dark Lord has finished the spell. Severus watches, fixated on the way he shakes: head dropped, hair a mess. His sleeve is cuffed, perfect, <em>perfect</em> skin scarred black.</p><p>
  <em>(Beautiful, if destructive.) </em>
</p><p>He wonders if this is what he’d looked like.</p><p>“When you said it <em>hurt,</em>” Regulus says, after, once they’re alone. He’s glaring, but even then. Even then: Severus can see the remnants of adrenaline; the way eyes sparkle with o<em>pportunity. </em></p><p>He smirks. <em>Teasing. </em>“Want me to kiss it better?”</p><p>Regulus’ glare deepens. “Bastard,” he says.</p><p>It almost sounds like, <em>yes.</em></p><p> </p></div>
