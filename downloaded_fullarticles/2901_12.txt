"It's something else that's for sure."</p><p>Marlene turned towards Hestia and asked, "How are you holding up, Hes?"</p><p>Hestia assured her, "I'm okay, Mar."</p><p>Marlene beamed, "I'm glad coz I don't like sad Hestia Jones."</p><p>Hestia teased, "Really? I like sad Hestia Jones better."</p><p>Marlene giggled. "Sad Hestia Jones is like a droopy bunny rabbit with large eyes and floppy ears, whereas happy Hestia Jones is like a perky kangaroo who could hop a marathon in seconds flat. Let's just say, I love happy Hestia Jones and sad Hestia Jones, but prefer the happy you."</p><p>Hestia grinned. "Okay, okay, I get it. No need to explain yourself."</p><p>Marlene whispered, "Come here you."</p><p>Hestia snuggled closer to Marlene and Marlene pulled her into a soft yet sweet kiss.</p></div>
