    <h2>Year 0</h2><p>Hera needed to get out. She didn’t know where exactly to go, but anywhere is better than here. The Dursleys didn’t seriously hurt her, but a lot of things that they did seemed to. She couldn’t really explain it, even things that others talked about their real parents doing. She had been in this cupboard for nearly three days, three days since the glass vanished from the front of that snake enclosure at the zoo.</p><p>She was hungry, but after the Dursleys had caught her stealing food another time they had installed a lock on the fridge. What she really needed was water. She was so thirsty. Her head had begun to feel fuzzy in the last half hour. She needed water.</p><p>She gritted her teeth. Anger coursed through her, it had always been like this. The teachers at school who had tried to intervene came back acting like nothing was wrong. She had fainted in school more times than she could count. And here she was, about to pass out again. She exhaled sharply through dry nostrils, she had to do something.</p><p>Then the cupboard door opened.</p><p>She was almost too shocked to believe it. She gingerly pushed against the wood. It swung open. She looked left and right down the hall, no one was there.</p><p>She crawled out of her cupboard, hoping this wasn’t some sort of trick by the Dursleys to punish her. She tiptoed to the kitchen and took a cup from beside the sink. She filled it from the tap and turned, giving one last look before she gave into the thirst.</p><p>She drained the entire cup’s worth, then went back for another, and another. She held a mouthful in her mouth just enjoying how cool and wet it was, and then she swallowed and it cooled her throat on the way down.</p><p>She looked out at the window overlooking the sink, the garden outside was bright with the moon. She looked up, it was full.</p><p>Her eyes seemed to focus in on it, and a comforting warmth flooded her body. She put the cup down. She ran to the door to the back garden, she needed out, again. This door sprang open too. She walked to the centre of the garden and sat down, looking up at the moon. She felt something when she looked at it. A sort of warm, sweet sensation. She remembered feeling something like it before, but she didn’t recall where.</p><p>She almost heard something, too. Some small whisper.</p><p>She didn’t know how long she stayed there looking up at the moon, drinking in the feeling. She fell asleep on the lawn.</p><p> </p><p>She awoke to the sound of her Aunt Petunia shrieking.</p><p>She was confused at first, where was she? This didn’t feel like her cupboard. This felt more like soft earth, grass, and the damp morning dew.</p><p>Then her Aunt charged out to her. She realised she was outside, and she was in trouble.</p><p>“Potter!” She hissed, dragging her back inside. “How did you unlock your cupboard?” Her Aunt’s hand clutched her painfully around her upper arm.</p><p>“Don’t know.” She said, squirming to escape the grip. She hoped that her aunt might think she had forgotten to lock it last time she was let out to go to the bathroom. She hadn’t forgotten though, it had opened by itself. She knew what that answer would get her though.</p><p>Luckily it seemed her aunt had concluded what she had hoped, and she was allowed to make breakfast for the first time since being locked in the cupboard. It was a Sunday, so she was to make bacon and eggs. The eggs always smelled good when they were cooking in the pan, but she always had to stop and take a long smell when the back bacon sizzled away. She hoped her aunt didn’t see her slip a piece of said bacon into her pocket to eat for herself after she was sent back to her cupboard with the slice of toast that they allowed her.</p><p>She finished cooking and was shepherded back to her cupboard. She savoured the bacon as she ate it, the texture was always a bit off, but she loved the taste. She ate it quickly to remove the smell and snacked idly on the toast, catching crumbs on a wet fingertip to eat just a little more and prevent her bed from being itchy.</p><p>Her mind began to wander, now the food was gone. why had she been outside last night? Why had she sat there in the garden drinking in the moonlight as eagerly as she had the water before it?</p><p>She scratched her head, on which sat her short red hair. Hair red. She sometimes wondered if that was where her birth parents had come up with her name. Hair Red. Haired, Hered, Hera? It was a strange name, she had never heard anyone called that before. She had even heard of some other Dudleys at school, but never a Hera.</p><p>Her aunt hated her name. Her name and her red hair. Although that might be because it just never seemed to grow. Her aunt had come home with a wig one day and declared that she would need to wear it to school the next day. She was absolutely dreading it, but by a stroke of luck her aunt seemed to misplace it overnight. Her aunt didn’t bring home anymore wigs, and Hera’s red hair stayed just as she liked it.</p><p>With her cupboard locked there wasn’t much to do. Her eyes may adjust quickly to the darkness, but that doesn’t find her anything to do. She was let out in the evening to go to the toilet and then she had to go back in.</p><p>She needed out again. The cupboard was too small. She felt a sick feeling in her stomach, she needed out.</p><p>The door popped open again. Hera opened it quickly and quietly and made her way to the back door, bypassing the sink and water this time. The back door opened too.</p><p>She looked up at the moon, still full, and felt the warm feeling flow into her. It seemed more than last night, she felt better, more energetic. She ran around the garden a couple of times but that only seemed to make her feel like she wanted to run more. So, she did. She ran until she was so very tired and collapsed in a star shape looking up at the moon.</p><p>She felt a cold wind blow across the yard. She didn’t mind though, it felt nice; she wasn’t cold at all.</p><p>She watched the moon for hours again, and fell asleep.</p><p>Her aunt dragged her back into her cupboard in the morning.</p><p>It was Monday, and she heard her aunt tell her uncle that they needed a self-locking mechanism for the cupboard. He couldn’t go and get it today, but he could on the weekend.</p><p>That night the cupboard door sprang open when she wanted it to. Her cupboard didn’t feel as stifling as it had the previous nights, but she knew she would still feel better outside. She made her way outside and drank once more from the moonlight.</p><p>There was a small black crescent on one side of the moon. She ran some, but not as much as the previous night. Then she laid down, on the final night of the full moon for this month and slept peacefully.</p><p>The next morning, she woke earlier than her aunt. That was surprising. Or perhaps not when she considered that she had gone to sleep rather soon after she got outside. She crept back inside, locking the door to outside, and she made it into her cupboard by the time the footsteps at the top of the stairs started.</p><p>She didn’t feel much like going out that night, so young Hera Potter stayed in her cupboard. She thought she should feel strange, but she knew that the moon would return to full in a month. That would be the time to stare up at it then.</p><p> </p><h2>Year 1 Chapter 1</h2><p>When the giant man named Hagrid arrived at the hut on the rock, she believed fairly easily that she was a witch. After how the moonlight made her feel, she knew that something had to be different about her, or everyone would be out on the lawns watching it.</p><p>She received her wand from Mr Ollivander for a mere seven Galleons. English Oak and Unicorn hair. He seemed almost disappointed for some reason.</p><p>A witch she might be, but that didn’t stop her from enjoying her favourite pastime. The castle was big, and she figured she wouldn’t really have time before breakfast to get back to her dormitory in Gryffindor tower and collect her things. So, for three days every month Hera Potter would pack a bag and make her way out to the grounds. She made sure she had a change of robes, her books for her first class the next day, and some food.</p><p>She had always been hungry at the Dursleys, but just recently she began to notice she got really hungry around the full moon. She usually managed to get some extra from dinner that night if there was something dry like sausages or a roast.</p><p>She made sure to leave her dormitory before the nine o’clock curfew, sometimes mumbling an excuse to the friends she had made. Like that she had to get to the library before it closed.</p><p>The feeling she got from the moon’s light hadn’t decreased in the slightest. It was stronger than ever. She thought it might be because Hogwarts was so far out of the city. She remembered overhearing her uncle watching a news report about how city smog was polluting the air and blotting out stars, he had said that that was ‘Labour party Hippy Talk’; he wasn’t here now. The moonlight seemed to soak even further into her, feeling better and better each time she lay down for a night outside.</p><p>she had made friends with some people. There was Hermione Granger, who she liked very much. She was smart and had big fluffy hair. She had become friends with Ron Weasley on the train there, he was funny, even if he did take some convincing that she didn’t have a lightning bolt shaped scar. Perhaps the comparison seemed unfavourable, but Ron was very funny, and Hermione could become a little annoying with her need for Hera to study too. There was also Neville Longbottom, although they hadn’t talked much, she still counted him.</p><p>She couldn’t tell them about her monthly excursions though. But she didn’t know why, for some reason she felt it would be bad if they found out.</p><p>And sometimes when she looked up at the moon, she could almost hear a whisper.</p><p>But the more she saw the moon, the more she felt there was something missing.</p><p> </p><p>She liked a lot of her classes. Potions was fun, if a little dangerous. She had been going well with transfiguration. Professor McGonagall offered her some extension work, she was nice. She didn’t like herbology much, it was so smelly in the greenhouses, and that only got worse when they brought out the fertiliser.</p><p>Soon it was time for their first flying lesson. She had been excited for this, and Madam Hooch was really cool, with windswept hair and yellow eyes. Neville had an accident while flying and dropped some sort of artefact. That blond boy picked it up. Her anger spiked, she didn’t like him. She batted the orb away as he waves it teasingly in her face and punched him on the nose. She had gotten detention and was forced to sit out the rest of her flying lessons, but it was worth it.</p><p> </p><p>Her eyes lit up when she saw the giant three headed dog inside the third-floor corridor. Her heart ached on their behalf, too, imagine being that size and being cooped up in such a small room. It was just like her cupboard. She launched herself into the room, hoping to grab the attention of the big dog. The heads tipped to one side (all the same side), as if contemplating something.</p><p>The whispers of her friends behind her telling her to come back fell on deaf ears. The three heads opened their mouths and Hermione let out a shriek, but she needn’t have worried, the only way Hera was in danger was of being licked to death. She scratched the three noses and hugged the three large snouts before saying goodbye and leaving, promising to return with treats.</p><p>Hagrid was horrified that the four of them had been sneaking around and found Fluffy. Ron was horrified at the name, but Hera, who was currently playing with Fang said it suited him.</p><p> </p><p>Christmas brought about an odd occurrence. Although it was not the full moon, she ventured out into the castle itself in her newly acquired invisibility cloak, and while she was dodging staff and prefect patrols, she happened upon a strange mirror.</p><p>But it did not show her, not as she was. She was older, perhaps her late teens? She had the same short red hair, though. She was surrounded by other women, all of them hugging. She saw Hermione’s bushy hair, and long red hair that she couldn’t quite place. The full moon behind them, or perhaps the image itself filled her with that same feeling, and she could tell her mirror self could feel it. From the looks of it, so did the others. She watched them longer, taking in the faces. One of them had a round face she could have sworn might have belonged to Neville’s sister if she hadn’t known he was an only child.</p><p>“Sisters?” she asked the air. Was that what this group was? Then she noticed the… familiarity with which they held each other; perhaps not. She saw herself crane her neck over to Hermione and press her lips to the other’s cheek.</p><p> </p><p>She returned the next night with Ron, taking care to describe the people in her reflection as friends. She wondered idly why Ron hadn’t been there, but pushed the thought from her mind as he described his reflection.</p><p>He did not describe a group of friends, or even what Hera had seen. He saw himself, alone, having accomplished all his brothers had and more.</p><p>She didn’t bring him the next night. But someone else came along.</p><p>Professor Dumbledore was there already. He explained that the mirror of Erised show your heart’s desire. He asked politely what she saw in the mirror, and she answered truthfully.</p><p>“I see myself, older, and surrounded by people.”</p><p>“Your family?”</p><p>“Not exactly, there’s Hermione, and some other girls I kinda recognise, but…” she said, stopping short of mentioning the kisses that occasionally passed between the people there; as well as the moon; that amazing, glorious moon.</p><p>“I believe what you desire is belonging.” He said.</p><p>“What do you see when you look in the mirror, Professor?” she asked.</p><p>“I see…” He said, starting quickly, then trailed off before continuing. “myself holding a pair of woollen socks.”</p><p>She decided not to push him any further.</p><p> </p><h2>Year 1 Chapter 2</h2><p>Her monthly outings continued, but she was annoyed when, in the process of relocating a dragon for Hagrid, that she got detention the night of the full moon. They were to go into the forbidden forest, which meant that the moon would be obscured sometimes. She couldn’t find an excuse that convinced Professor McGonagall to move her detention so she headed down with a full bag of food and the next day’s first lesson’s books, she figured she’d just split off from the party when they went back up to the school.</p><p>She, Hermione, Neville, and that horrible blond boy who she hadn’t bothered to learn the name of met at Hagrid’s hut for the detention. The blond seemed scared.</p><p>“There might be Werewolves in there!” he had said. Hera idly wondered what a werewolf was. But Hagrid said that there weren’t any in the forbidden forest. Their job was to find a unicorn that had been attacked. Hagrid lead the four students and Fang while carrying a crossbow. They had to duck behind a tree when a strange slithering sound echoed through the forest.</p><p>A horrible oily smell had just reached Hera’s nostrils when Hagrid pointed out some silvery reflective liquid on some leaves.</p><p>“That’s unicorn blood. The poor thing must be staggering around in pain.”</p><p>“That smells horrible.” She said. She felt a rush of sympathy for the unicorn, but that didn’t stop her from clasping her hands over her nostrils.</p><p>They moved on quickly, both Hera and Hagrid eager to find the beast and put it out of its misery.</p><p>They passed a herd of centaurs galloping through the trees. One stopped to talk to Hagrid for a few seconds.</p><p>“We know you track the slain Unicorn, Hagrid.” He said. “We wish you good fortune. As well as you, young one.” He said to Hera. The others students were a little confused, they had been there as well, yet the centaur had seemed to speak only to Hera.</p><p>They continued into the forest. After a series of splitting up, regrouping, etc. Hera, the blond boy, and Fang stumbled into a clearing.</p><p>In the middle of the clearing was the unicorn, and it was dead. They heard the slithering sound again, and a figure in a cloak emerged from the underbrush. It lowered its head to the wound in the unicorn’s side and began to drink. The blond boy took off screaming.</p><p>Hera looked down at the figure. How dare they? Whoever they are, making a mockery of this beautiful creature. She walked out into the clearing, the full moon shone above her.</p><p>She felt the change for the first time in her life.</p><p>The moon shone down on her, filling her with that same feeling. She felt her eyes change, they weren’t necessarily sharper or better, but different. Her nails split and claws pushed in through the nail beds. Her knees reversed suddenly, and she fell onto all fours. Hair was growing all over her, the same colour as the hair on her head. Bones cracked painlessly and muscles grew. Her face pushed out into the muzzle of a dog, no, of a wolf. She felt her brain change slightly, she could still think, but it was different, more pictures than words and slightly simpler.</p><p>By the time the transformation had finished she had instinctively shrugged off her clothes, and a large red and brown wolf stood where she had been.</p><p>The figure had been drinking this whole time, but then a howl left her throat. A howl of thanks to the moon.</p><p>Howls of other wolves went up around the forest, echoing her. She began to stalk towards the figure. It stumbled backwards.</p><p>Her sense of smell was incredible, she could smell Hagrid a little way off, stomping through the underbrush, the unicorn’s blood almost made her choke on her own bile, but the figure was strange. There was a scent that she had caught before, but couldn’t place from where.</p><p>She might have been more interested in the meat in her bag, but this figure was wrong. She needed to get rid of it.</p><p>She charged and leapt onto it, but it was too quick, a wand emerged from its cloak and a curse pushed her backwards. She turned back to see it. But it was gone.</p><p>She had chased it off, it wouldn’t hurt anyone else in the forest tonight, of that she knew. It suddenly occurred to her how very hungry she was. She didn’t take long to find her bag and poked her snout inside to drag out the roast beef she had taken from dinner. She though it was filling, but it could be better. She found some bacon further in, and that was a little tastier.</p><p>Her hunger had subsided a bit, and Hagrid would be here soon to take them back up to the castle. She sat like she had seen Fang do sometimes beside her clothes. Hagrid would be so proud of her for finding the Unicorn, and for chasing the figure off.</p><p>She heard him, Ron and Hermione approaching through the underbrush, it seemed the blond boy had found them too. She wagged her tail, eager for the praise she knew would be coming.</p><p>Hagrid burst through the trees.</p><p>“Hera? Where are ye? What ha…” He trailed off, taking in the scene with a large wolf sitting next to Hera’s bag and clothes, and the unicorn dead on the other side of the clearing. He levelled the crossbow at her. “Back!”</p><p>She tilted her head, why was Hagrid pointing that thing at her? He surely wasn’t going to- with a twang, he did. The bolt stuck in her side. She yelped from the pain, she needed to leave. She skidded around and threw a last glance back at the party before running of into the forest.</p><p>She ran. The wind whipped past her, she felt the same as when she was just staring at the moon, even though it was obscured by heavy leaf coverage. No, she didn’t feel the same. She felt better, she was free, this is what she had been missing.</p><p>There was something ahead of her, she saw it through the gloom. Perhaps the cloaked figure was back? She charged forwards and pounced. Her jaws closed around a rabbit. She shook it, putting it out of its misery quickly. Then she lay it upon the ground and began using her front paws to pin it in place while she used her teeth to rip its flesh.</p><p>She had eaten quite a bit previously, but the rabbit was so much better than the cooked meats. She felt the warm blood trickle down her throat and the small bones crushed against her teeth. The fur did tickle her mouth a bit though. She did not eat for long, the things she had brought from dinner had filled her quite a bit. She grabbed the carcass in her teeth and took off again, moving away from where she caught it.</p><p>She reached a large oak, next to a small pine. She dug under the pine, careful not to go too close to any roots. Her front paws scooping the soil out from the hole. When she was satisfied she dropped the rabbit in, and used her back paws to push the dirt over it.</p><p>She set off running again.</p><p>She caught sight of something dart off to the right. Curious, she altered her course to investigate. It turned out to be one of the centaurs that she had seen earlier, the one who had spoken to her.</p><p>She woofed at him. He turned, slowing, and waved.</p><p>“I see you have changed, young one.” He said. He turned and leaned down to let her smell him. “Was this the first time?”</p><p>She pondered for a moment, what did he meant by first time? Probably the first time she had changed into this form. She nodded, her ears flopping.</p><p>“I see you have eaten already, that is good.” He said. Then he saw the shaft sticking from her side. “Oh dear, was that Hagrid? He means well, and you will survive, but we should get you back to him all the same. Can you lead me?”</p><p>She nodded again, it was easy to know where Hagrid was, he and the three others were still calling out for her around the clearing. She started off at a slow trot, and he followed.</p><p>“I’m sorry I did not introduce myself earlier.” He said. “My name is Firenze.”</p><p>She yipped in acknowledgement.</p><p>“I am sorry we had to meet under such grim circumstances.” Firenze said. “And that your Lunarche was interrupted by… that”</p><p>She cocked her head and made a noise.</p><p>“Ahh, forgive me. I had forgotten you may not have been raised with your own in the old ways.” He said. “A Lunarche is the first full moon where you change.”</p><p>Hera nearly walked into a tree, watching Firenze’s story so intently.</p><p>“And the old ways, a series of myths and… cultures that we use. Before modern times, before modern wizardry, both our peoples drew upon the natural world for magic.” He said. He chuckled. “And if you believe the myths, we may be related, depending on your Patron.” he paused, but against realised that she didn’t know about any ’Patron’. He didn’t get much of a chance to explain, as they reached the edge of the clearing where Hagrid and the others were.</p><p>They had stopped shouting. Hagrid was digging a grave in the earth for the unicorn. The blond boy was leaning against a tree, and Hermione and Neville were sitting next to Hera’s bag and clothes, whispering.</p><p>“I told you, Hermione, I can’t think of anything that would have just left Hera’s clothes here without her.” He said. She was trying to get him to help her reason out the cause of her disappearance.</p><p>“There must be something, maybe she took them off?” Hermione asked. “What about anything like that?” Hera was about to leap out to them, show them she was still here, but Firenze extended a hand before she could.</p><p>“Let me go first.” He said, and walked out of the trees. He raised his voice. “Hagrid.”</p><p>“Sorry Firenze, got no time to talk.” He said, Hera could see from here that he seemed to be on the verge of tears. “I’ve lost a student, and I need to bury this before rodents start drinking from it.”</p><p>“Hagrid.”</p><p>“The blood needs to be absorbed by the trees to get rid of it.” He took a pair of shears from his belt and snipped off the tail, he moved to the mane and removed it similarly. He deposited it in his jacket.</p><p>“Hagrid. There is something you need to see.”</p><p>“The hair and horn need to be preserved soon-“ Hagrid glanced up. “I need to see something?”</p><p>“Before you do, please know that what happened was not your fault.” He said. “You had no way of knowing, and had the best interests of your students at heart.”</p><p>“What’re you talking about Firenze?”</p><p>Firenze beckoned to Hera, and slightly embarrassed at the blood from the rabbit dripping down her muzzle, she emerged from the forest. She sat down beside Firenze, lazily wagging her tail.</p><p>Hermione and Neville grasped each other. The blonde ducked behind the tree.</p><p>“Wha’? Its that wolf.” Hagrid said, confused.</p><p>“Yes and no, Hagrid. The moon is full.” Firenze said. “Young Miss Potter understands, I think, why you did what you did.”</p><p>She didn’t really understand, but he hadn’t seen her like this before (neither had she, really), and it was ok, she had forgiven him anyway.</p><p>“Hera?” Hagrid said, shocked. His face twisted in pain. “Yer a werewolf?”</p><p>She nodded. Her tail wagged happily. So, she was a werewolf, and that was what a werewolf is.</p><p>“Hagrid…” Neville hissed. “Where’s your bow?”</p><p>Hera saw his eyes glance over to it, on the ground a few meters away. He put his arms up and began edging towards it. Why was he going over to it? Why had Neville wanted to know where it was?</p><p>“I’m sorry, Hera.” Hagrid moved slightly further.</p><p>She realised what he meant, and lay flat on the ground. Head on the forest floor. Her tail very still.</p><p>“Hagrid what are you doing?” Hermione hissed, she had removed herself from Neville.</p><p>“Hagrid.” Firenze said. “Hera is in complete control. There is no need to execute her.” At the ‘E’ Word, Hera scrunched up her eyes shut.</p><p>She heard a crunch on the ground.</p><p>“Hagrid, she’s been good thus far, she was waiting here for us to get here.” Hermione said. Her footsteps approaching Hera. She opened her eyes and looked toward her. “I don’t think she’d hurt me.”</p><p>“I-“ Hagrid said, torn between wanting to protect three students, and to not kill one.</p><p>Hermione got closer, and Hera moved her head to meet the approaching hand. They met, Hermione cautiously stroking her furred snout. Hera liked the feeling, and her tail began to wag again. She didn’t get up, but did give out a whine when Hermione removed her hand from the snout. But then she began to pat her head, moving the hand down over her back.</p><p>“See Hagrid, Neville, she isn’t dangerous.” Hermione said. Hera opened her mouth slightly to lick some of the rabbit’s blood from her lower lips. “Did you have something to eat out there?”</p><p>Hagrid had paused in his way towards the crossbow, the blond boy had poked his head out from the tree, even Neville had begun to move to get a closer look at her.</p><p>“I believe you will be safe now, miss Potter.” Firenze said. “I will take my leave of you now. The night is far from over, enjoy your Lunarche.”</p><p>She whined as the centaur turned to leave.</p><p>“Do not worry, we will meet other again, most likely next month.” He said, and walked into the trees. “I will tell you more then.”</p><p>Content with that explanation, Hera turned back to where Neville was moving closer. He put his hand on her side and began to rub. It was very nice to have her friends patting her, her tail flicked back and forth quickly.</p><p>“Potter’s a werewolf?” The blond boy said. “And they’re still letting her go to Hogwarts? Wait until my father hears about this.”</p><p>Hera cocked her head to the side at the obvious threat. Then she caught a hint of scent. There was more meat here. She stood, disrupting the petting and walked over to her bag. She poked her head back in, probably getting blood on the inside fabric. And she pulled out a small string of sausages. Which she began munching on, but then she realised how rude she must be. She picked it up by the end and brought it back over to Neville and Hermione. She dropped it on the forest floor, and nodded her head upwards.</p><p>“You want us to eat?” Neville said, she nodded. He seemed hesitant, but Hermione picked up the opposite end that Hera had carried and snapped one off, she quickly removed the casing to remove the dirt, and offered the casing to Hera, she licked it off her palm. Hermione bit down on the sausage. Neville looked a bit green at the prospect of eating off the ground. “I’ll pass thanks.”</p><p>Hera picked up the sausages again and moved over to the blond boy, he tersely rejected the sausages too.</p><p>She brought them over to Hagrid. He seemed to be fighting back tears.</p><p>“I’m so sorry Hera.” He sobbed. He threw his arms around her. She rubbed the side of her head against his. She wanted him to know all was forgiven. He pulled back after a few seconds, she flicked her head to put the next sausage in the chain into her mouth. “And you’ve still got that ruddy arrow in you.”</p><p>He pulled out a great handkerchief and blew his nose.</p><p>“Sorry, but I gotta bury that unicorn.” He said, standing up. He moved over to the unicorn and used a small saw to remove the horn, and then rolled the unicorn into the pit. He used his feet to push the earth back into the pit, with some use of the shovel it formed a relatively flat patch of earth. “C’mon, we gotta get you all up to the castle.”</p><p>“Hera, I’ll take your things, ok.” Hermione said. She loaded her clothes into the bag and pulled it on.</p><p>They began to move back up to the castle, Hagrid leading the way, with Hera next to him, followed by the three others. Hagrid sent fang back to his cabin.</p><p>They had been walking for a few minutes when a white moth flew across their path. Hera woofed at it, and ran to chase after it. The party stopped, waiting for Hera to return. She did a few seconds later, without the moth, and they continued on their way up to the school.</p><p>When they emerged from the forest, Hera shot off running all around, every way she could. Being under direct moonlight again felt so good when she was like this.</p><p>The party didn’t stop this time, Hagrid said he was confident that she could see them across the field.</p><p>When they reached the doors, Hagrid gave a pained expression, and Hera trotted up to him.</p><p>“I can’t leave you here while I go get a teacher, but I think I might be able to take me with you. Now, you’re sure you’re able to control yourself?” he asked. She nodded, she had shown that his whole time, but it was ok. Hagrid nervously lead them into the entrance hall. “Everyone follow me. We’re going to visit Professor Dumbledore.”</p><p> </p><h2>Year 1 Chapter 3</h2><p>Hera listened to the tap-tap-tap of her claws against the stone floors. It was a funny sound, she hopped from one foot to another, she enjoyed hearing the happy sound echo around the deserted corridors.</p><p>The others walked alongside Hagrid. The blond boy on the opposite side of him from her, but Neville and Hermione seemed to have accepted that she wasn’t dangerous. Occasionally they would walk next to her, scratching or petting her.</p><p>Eventually they all reached a gargoyle set into the wall, Hagrid stepped up to it.</p><p>“Jaffa cakes.” He said, the gargoyle sprang to life and leapt aside. Hagrid gestured for the others to climb the staircase.  The blond boy raced up the stairs first, followed by Neville and Hermione. “You too, Hera.”</p><p>Hera also climbed, followed by Hagrid, and emerged into an office, presumably the headmasters. Portraits of old people lined the walls not covered in bookshelves, they seemed to all be sleeping. A number of small instruments puffed and twirled on desks around the room. There was a desk in the centre of the room. To the left was a perch with a large red and gold bird, it seemed to have woken recently and was now looking at their group of intruders.</p><p>“Hagrid?” The voice of the headmaster said from a passage behind the desk. “Is everything alright?” he emerged from the passage and took in the sight of the five of them there.</p><p>“Err… Not exactly Professor.” Hagrid said. “It seems that Hera Potter is a werewolf.”</p><p>“And this is her, I presume?” Dumbledore asked. “She is behaving rather well for one currently changed.” He noticed the bolt still lodged in her side. He waved his wand and a large silver bird rushed out of it, down the stairs out of his office.</p><p>“Firenze, one of the Centaur herd, said she can control herself.” He said. “it seemed to be true, so I thought you had better see.”</p><p>They continued talking for a time, but Hera found herself growing bored, so she went over to look at the bird. It watched her out of the corner of its eye. She quickly grew bored of that as well, so she started to wander around the room.</p><p>“Hera.” She heard her name, and her head turned to professor Dumbledore. “Can you understand me?”</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>“How long has this been going on, if you don’t mind me asking.”</p><p>“Firenze said this was a lune arc, I don’t know what that means but he said it meant the first time.” Hagrid supplied.</p><p>“That is strange, how could she have become a werewolf last month on the full moon?” Dumbledore said. “I know for certain that no werewolves, other than yourself now Hera, are in the area, and have not been for some time; so a bite is out of the question.”</p><p>“But she would have been in the castle last full moon, how would a werewolf get in here without you knowing sir?”</p><p>“It is possible certainly, but I have called Poppy to attend to Hera’s wounds, she will be able to tell us if she was treated for a bite last month.”</p><p>“I’m just so sorry, Hera.” Hagrid said.</p><p>“I’m afraid we will need to wait till the morning to question her further.” Dumbledore said, he flicked his wand and a large wicker basket appeared, covered in blankets and pillows. Hera looked at him, and he nodded. She gave a large yawn, opening her jaws wide, and stepped into the basket. She turned around a few times to get comfortable and lay down with the crossbow bolt sticking out into the air.</p><p>Dumbledore turned his attention to the other three.</p><p>“You have all been exceptionally brave in unforeseen circumstances, you each earn your houses fifty points.” He said, looking at Neville, Hermione and the blond boy. “However, I must ask you, both as your headmaster, and as myself, to not tell anyone outside this room about young Hera’s condition. We will be taking steps to minimise any future danger she poses to the school.”</p><p>“Of course not, sir.” Hermione said.</p><p>“Yeah, she’s our friend.” Neville agreed. Dumbledore turned to the blond boy.</p><p>“I don’t understand how you can let her stay here? Werewolves are dangerous.” He said.</p><p>“An understandable position, Mr Malfoy,” Dumbledore said. “but as she has not hurt any of you yet, I would ask you to not tell anyone all the same.”</p><p>Mr Malfoy looked like he was about to speak, but Dumbledore spoke first.</p><p>“I will be informing the school governors, including your father.”</p><p>“Fine.” The blond boy finally agreed.</p><p>“Thank you, for now I think the three of you should go to bed.” He flicked his wand and three quills began to write upon a length of parchment. When they had finished three strips, each containing the message tore off and floated over to the students. “These will make sure you are not placed in detention for being out during curfew, but they will work only for tonight, so you had best hurry back to your dormitories.”</p><p>The three left quietly, Hermione placed Hera’s bag net to the basket. Hagrid and Dumbledore discussed the situation quietly. Hera felt herself getting sleepy, but before she could fall asleep, the matron, Madam Pomfrey entered the office.</p><p>“You are sure she is safe, headmaster?” She said, slowly walking closer to Hera.</p><p>“Quite sure, Poppy.”</p><p>Madam Pomfrey easily vanished the bolt in Hera’s side, she flinched at the slight pain. But it quickly diminished as she felt her skin healing under the medical spell work of the matron.</p><p>“I have never seen a case like this, not even back in St Mungo’s” She said to Dumbledore. “Not in all my years has a werewolf come in that was able to control themselves. But then of course, they might not need to come in at all.”</p><p>“And Miss Potter’s record?”</p><p>“She hasn’t visited me at all this year.”</p><p>“Well, I think there is not much we can do until Hera reverts back to a human form.” Dumbledore said. “Thank you, Poppy.”</p><p>The matron exited.</p><p>“Thank you for bringing this to my attention, Hagrid.” Dumbledore said as a dismissal. Hagrid left with an apologetic glance at Hera. “Now it’s just the two of us, I will be watching over you until morning, if you wish to sleep.”</p><p>Hera settled back into the blankets, rather tired from the evening…</p><p> </p><p>When she woke, she was back to being human. Dumbledore sat in a chair next to her. He had apparently conjured a blanket for her to preserve her dignity.</p><p>“Professor?” She asked.</p><p>“Good morning, Young Hera, you had quite an adventure last night.” He said kindly. “I will be back in a few minutes if you would like to get dressed. Wishy!” A small creature wearing a white toga appeared with a pop. “Please take miss Potter’s dirty clothes to her dormitory, and bring a fresh uniform here.”</p><p>“Yes, headmaster Dumbledore sir.” It disappeared with another such pop. Only to reappear a moment later with a stack of clothes. It set the clothes on the ground and vanished again. Dumbledore returned into the passageway at the rear of the office.</p><p>Soon enough Hera was in the new robes and sitting in front of Dumbledore’s desk.</p><p>“How much do you remember of it?” he asked.</p><p>“I remember we were in detention in the forest, then I changed. Hagrid shot me.” She said, she remembered how she had felt no animosity after she had returned to the clearing. “Then I ran off, I met Firenze. Then we came back up here and Madam Pomfrey patched me up.”</p><p>“That is what Hagrid tells me happened. And that you were in control of your actions.”</p><p>“Yeah but it was weird, like simpler. I was a bit hungry at first, but I had some meat with me, and then I caught a rabbit.”</p><p>“Why did you have meat with you?” he asked.</p><p>“Well, before I came to Hogwarts I used to go out and watch the moon when it was full.” She said. “I liked how it felt, and I continued when I came here. I started getting really hungry a few months ago when I did it so I took some stuff from dinner to eat.”</p><p>“That is quite strange.” He said. “have you ever been bitten by another werewolf? Or perhaps even a large dog?”</p><p>Hera thought back, she couldn’t remember something like that.</p><p>“I don’t think so sir.”</p><p>“How odd, usually that is how lycanthropy is spread.” He said. “I have not heard of a natural werewolf coming into existence for some time.”</p><p>He paused.</p><p>“And you say you were hungry?”</p><p>“Yes, sir.”</p><p>“Hmm. It has been postulated that werewolf transformations burn a lot of energy, but no studies have been conducted due to a ban on research of the type.” Dumbledore said.</p><p>“Hmpf.” Said one of the portraits off to the side.</p><p>“Is there something you would like to contribute Headmistress O’Gryff?” Dumbledore asked.</p><p>“Yes, headmaster.” The curly haired woman said. She spoke in a thick Irish accent, and seemed a little annoyed. “I’m surprised you didn’t ask me immediately. Were we not talking about my lover over the Christmas holidays?”</p><p>“Ah, yes. She was a werewolf, was she not?” Dumbledore said. Hera’s breath caught in her throat. This headmistress had liked a woman? No, had <em>loved</em> a woman. She was one of those other people that uncle Vernon had raged at on the evening news.</p><p>“Yes. We had such fun, running across the fields.” She said. “What an odd sight we must have been, a Lion and a Wolf.” She noticed Hera’s look, and incorrectly identified it as confusion. “I was an Animagus, a witch who could become an animal at will. But even if I hadn’t it would not have mattered. She made sure she had plenty of food for when she transformed.”</p><p>“You haven’t told me of this before now?” Dumbledore said.</p><p>“I have, you forgot.” She said pointedly. “Or didn’t believe me, that poor boy-“</p><p>“Thank you, Aoife.” Dumbledore said pointedly. “Perhaps we have discussed similar things, and I shall shoulder the blame for that in time.”</p><p>“Suit yourself, Dumbledore.” She said, and walked out of her portrait.</p><p>“Very well, now there is just what to do with you tonight miss Potter.” Dumbledore said. “I would think it would be prudent for you to spend the nights of the full moon inside a small house outside of Hogsmeade, but with your control over yourself you would not be contained within the shrieking shack; nor for that matter would you need to be.”</p><p>“Can’t I just stay out in the grounds?” She said. She didn’t want to be confined to a small house. “I won’t hurt anyone.”</p><p>“I’m sure you won’t, but I will need to discuss this with the teachers first, to ensure that no one is able to slip into the grounds to interrupt you.” He said. “The less people who know about this the better. Please meet Professor McGonagall in the entrance hall at 8 PM.”</p><p> </p><h2>Year 1 Chapter 4</h2><p>She arrived back at the common room just as Hermione was coming down to do some early study. She dashed over and pulled her into a hug. Then looked around to make sure everyone in the common room was distracted.</p><p>“Thank you for trusting me.” She said. “I-“</p><p>Hermione cut her off.</p><p>“We should go talk somewhere more private, Hera.” She said briskly, but then added in a softer voice. “But you’re welcome.”</p><p>They left the Gryffindor common room and found their way to an abandoned classroom on the fourth floor.</p><p>“I’m sorry I didn’t tell you about me.” Hera said. “To be honest I didn’t even know until I changed last night.”</p><p>“It’s alright, Hera. Now that I know you’re not dangerous I’m fine.” She said. “and it was your own secret, I had no right to know.”</p><p>“Thanks, Hermione.” Hera said, and pulled her into another hug.</p><p>“Being very physical, lately aren’t you?” She chuckled.</p><p>“Oh, I guess so.” She said. Hermione’s face fell slightly.</p><p>“Professor Dumbledore said you couldn’t have been bitten last month thought, I’m a little confused.” Hermione said.</p><p>“We talked a little after I changed back…” Hera said. “A few months before coming here I started using accidental magic to break out of my cupboard to go sleep under the full moon.”</p><p>“Sleeping under-“ she stopped. Her voice began to tremble. “What do you mean cupboard?”</p><p>“It’s where I slept, but not anymore though,” She said. “The Dursleys moved me into the second spare bedroom when my letters started arriving addressed to ‘The cupboard under the stairs’.”</p><p>“I- Hera, I, That’s horrible!” She said, incensed. “A cupboard under the stairs is no place to sleep.”</p><p>“It’s fine, really, and I’m in a bedroom now.”</p><p>“That’s not the point, i-“ Hermione said, her face strained. “You need to talk to Dumbledore about this.” Hera looked into Hermione’s eyes and sighed.</p><p>“Okay, but I don’t know how to get into his office, so I’ll have to send a letter or something.”</p><p>“Thank you, and please do it; for me.” She asked.</p><p>“I will.”</p><p>“What’s your plans for tonight?” Hermione asked.</p><p>“There’s a small hut where I’ll be staying tonight, not Hagrid’s, a different one.” She said. “I’m meeting Professor McGonagall tonight in the entrance hall after dinner.”</p><p> </p><p>And she did.</p><p>“Hera.” She said by way of a greeting, rather stiffly. She looked around the entrance hall. “Do you have everything you need?”</p><p>“Yes, professor.” Hera said and they left the doors. The moon was not yet at its apex, but Hera could feel the light invigorating her. She followed Professor McGonagall. It was a while before she spoke.</p><p>“I’m sorry for my manners, Hera. I’m deeply sorry that this has happened to you.” She said, as if Hera had taken gravely ill.</p><p>“That’s alright ma’am, I’m fine.” She said.</p><p>“It’s a hard life you’re in for.” She said, and Hera wasn’t sure exactly what she meant by that. They reached a big tree on the side of a hill, and McGonagall waved her wand. A small stick levitated up to the unmoving trunk and pressed something there. The entire tree quivered.</p><p>“Whoa!” Hera gasped, and the professor lead her to the base of the tree. There was a small hole there, perhaps big enough for a student, but too small for a werewolf.</p><p>“This is the secret passage to the Shrieking Shack, it’s an abandoned house outside of the local village.” She said. “Follow the passage and go through the trapdoor, I’ll be here to meet you just after sunrise.”</p><p>Hera slipped down the passage and followed it to the end. She emerged from the trapdoor into a dusty kitchen. There was a fireplace over on one wall, a boarded-up door and windows on another. She sneezed, and looked around at the various wooden wreckage scattered around the room. It was very small.</p><p>She decided to reserve judgement until she saw the rest of the house, so she went upstairs, a large four poster bed was against one wall. This room was dustier still.</p><p>The time for reserving judgement was now over, she didn’t like it. But Dumbledore said she had to stay here, at least for tonight, so she returned downstairs and peered out one of the windows. The minimal moonlight made her feel slightly better, but it didn’t seem high enough for her to change yet. She pulled a book out of her bag. If she was stuck here, she might as well read.</p><p>She had been reading for about half an hour when she felt a tug in her mind.  She snapped her book shut, and pulled out the food from her bag.</p><p>The change washed over her again. Her bones grew, muscles too. Her legs became digitrade, she felt her ears ‘upgrade’. Her muzzle pushed out, and hair began to sprout. Before she knew it, she was the same wolf she had been the previous night.</p><p>Hera tore into the food she had brought with her, several raw steaks had appeared in front of her at dinner, and she tore into them now. It was far better than the roast she brought yesterday. She swallowed and left the remainder for now.</p><p>She padded over to the window, eager to let the moon’s light wash over her like this. She couldn’t see the moon itself, and that was disappointing, but there was still a sliver of moonlight coming in from on high. She tapped her leg. She felt as though she needed to run, but this hut was so small.</p><p>She charged up the stairs and around the bedroom. But running on this uniform wood, in a circle, felt odd, unsatisfying. She tripped down the stairs and fell in a heap. She turned to the door, if she could get out, she could run.</p><p>She walked up to it and began helplessly pawing at the doorknob. But her paws without thumbs found no purchase. She began clawing at the wood. She needed out, she needed to run, to see the moon. The door seemed to be made of diamond, for all the damage her claws did.</p><p>Out.</p><p>She walked over to the rest of her food and ate it quickly.</p><p>She moved over to the trapdoor she had entered through, it seemed just as hard as the door. And she couldn’t lift it. She began breathing faster. She needed to get out.</p><p>Out.</p><p>She charged upstairs and around again. It was no good. She could feel the energy humming inside her, she needed to run, to get out.</p><p>Out.</p><p>Out.</p><p>But there was no way out.</p><p> </p><p>She quickly changed back into her robes the next morning and ran with tears in her eyes as fast as she could down the passageway. She needed to get out of that house. She clambered out of the hole beneath the big tree before checking if McGonagall was there. She saw McGonagall heading up towards her as she emerged from the tree, she ran towards her. She had to talk to her, she couldn’t go back in there again.</p><p>“Miss Potter!” The professor screamed, and pointed her wand behind Hera. She felt something impact on her back and she tripped.</p><p>Hera turned over to see the tree quivering, just like it had the previous night. McGonagall reached her. She crouched down.</p><p>“What were you thinking? I told you very clearly to not leave the tunnel until I was there?” She said, then she noticed Hera’s tears. “Oh no, please; tell me what’s wrong. Did someone break in? Did you hurt them?” She gasped. “Did you… get out?”</p><p>The word brought a fresh bought of tears from Hera, her huge, wracking sobs made her lungs hurt.</p><p>“No!” She finally struggled out. “Please don’t make me go back in there again.”</p><p>“I’m sorry, Potter.” She said.</p><p>“No!” Hera screamed, clutching professor McGonagall’s robes. “No!”</p><p>“I… let’s get you to the Hospital wing, Potter.” She said, trying to affect a comforting tone.</p><p>The professor picked up the too small girl of eleven and carried her and her bag up to the Hospital Wing. On her way she waved her wand and a silvery cat streaked off into a corridor.</p><p>“Poppy!” She called out as they entered the Hospital wing. “It’s Potter.” The matron walked out of her office.</p><p>“Dear Merlin! What happened to her Minerva?” She said, Hera felt a strange feeling, but it passed suddenly. Then as she got slightly closer, added, “Apart from the obvious.”</p><p>“I have no idea, she just left the passageway like this.” She said. “Before I was there, too.”</p><p>“Alright, onto a bed please.” Madam Pomfrey waved her wand and a nearby bed adjusted itself into a sitting position. McGonagall lay her gently onto a bed. Madam Pomfrey looked her over. Tutted a few times. She pressed her fingers to Hera’s wrist for a few seconds. “Nearly one hundred.” She straightened up and waved her wand, the curtains around the bed closed. “How do you feel, Hera?”</p><p>“I- I can’t go back there.” She said. “It’s too small, I couldn’t run. It’s dusty. I couldn’t feel the moon.”</p><p>“Ah. I think I know what the problem is.” She said. “I think it was most likely a panic attack.”</p><p>“I’m not sure what you mean, Poppy.” McGonagall said.</p><p>“Indeed, you mightn’t, Minerva.” She said. “It’s a fairly recent term, relative to us. I have been doing research into Muggle Medicine in the summer.”</p><p>“Ah.”</p><p>“For a simplified explanation, when a person is placed in a particularly stressful situation, a variety of symptoms can occur, including shortness of breath, raised pulse, and dilated pupils.” She said, and gestured for the professor to take a look at Hera’s eyes.</p><p>“Ah, I see.”</p><p>“As for the situation itself.” Madam Pomfrey shook her head. “it is my professional opinion that miss Potter should never have been made to sleep in the Shrieking Shack in the first place. She was perfectly well behaved when I attended to her the day before yesterday.”</p><p>“The headmaster said it was for the best until he could talk to the governors.” She said. She turned her attention to Hera. “I’m deeply sorry that you had to go through that, Hera.”</p><p>Hera sniffed. They heard a knock at the curtain. Madam Pomfrey waved her wand and Dumbledore was allowed to enter.</p><p>“Minerva, I came as quickly as I could.” He said, then looked at Hera. “What has happened?”</p><p>“Headmaster if you will follow me into my office.” Madam Pomfrey said, and stewarded the two others out. “We will return shortly, miss Potter.”</p><p>Hera sat there for a few minutes, toying with the sheets and her bag, she was starting to feel a lot calmer now. She hoped silently that Madam Pomfrey would be able to convince them that she didn’t need to go back to the Shrieking Shack that night. She felt her heart trip with fear at the thought of that place.</p><p>Soon enough, the curtains pulled back again, and the three adults entered. She looked up fearfully.</p><p>“Don’t worry, Hera, we aren’t going to force you to stay in the Shrieking shack again.” McGonagall said.</p><p>“I can see now that that was a mistake on my part.” Dumbledore said. “Given your ability to control yourself while changed, we will be permitting you to have free roam of the grounds.”</p><p>“Thank you, sir.” Hera said, she smiled. “I- I can’t tell you how relieved I am.”</p><p>“I have organised a meeting with the school Governors tonight.” He said, smiling kindly back at her. “Would we perhaps be able to visit you in the grounds, so they can see you are in control?”</p><p>“Yes, of course!” she said.</p><p>“And Hera, I am very sorry that I did not understand what you were going through in there.” McGonagall said. “It’s taking a bit of getting used to, thinking a werewolf can control themselves when transformed.”</p><p>“Thanks Professor.” Hera said. The Hera paused. “Do you think other people will react like that?”</p><p>“It is overwhelmingly likely.” She said. “Even your friend Mr Weasley would perhaps be better off, no knowing.”</p><p>“Oh, ok.” She had been thinking of Ron specifically.</p><p>“I will meet you in the entrance hall at eight again tonight, Hera.” McGonagall said. “And if there’s nothing else, I think we should be getting down to breakfast.”</p><p>“Almost, Minerva.” Madam Pomfrey said. Then she turned to Hera. “I would like to meet me here tomorrow night, so I can assist you with strategies to prevent or recover from panic attacks by yourself.”</p><p>“Thank you, Madam Pomfrey.” She said. She was breathing easier, and she was feeling almost back to normal now. Perhaps it was just because she was very hungry?</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, Professor Dumbledore!” She realised. “Hermione made me promise to tell you that the Dursleys had made me sleep in the cupboard under the stairs until I got my Hogwarts letter addressed to me there.”</p><p>Both teachers froze, then Dumbledore spoke.</p><p>“I will deal with this, Minerva.” He said, an alien undertone in his voice.</p><p> </p><p>Dumbledore split off from them soon after they left the Hospital wing and she accompanied McGonagall down to breakfast.</p><p>Most of the school was there, already eating their breakfast. Hera rushed over to Ron and Hermione.</p><p>“Hi Hera.” Ron said in between mouthfuls of bacon.</p><p>“Hi Ron.” She said, and pulled up some bacon of her own.</p><p>“Hera…” Hermione said slowly. “How did you go with McGonagall’s lesson last night?”</p><p>“Wha-? Oh, that lesson.” She said, realising she was speaking in code. “Not good at all, we decided to switch to the method we were originally using for tonight’s lesson.”</p><p>“If you’re sure.” Hermione smiled.</p><p>“I’m sure.” Hera smiled back.</p><p> </p><h2>Year 1 Chapter 5</h2><p>Hera eagerly made her way to the entrance hall after dinner. The raw steaks had appeared in front of her again, and she was able to sneak them into her bag. She hoped she would have more of a chance to enjoy them this night.</p><p>Professor McGonagall was there to escort her out, and this time she led her over to the stone circle just uphill from Hagrid’s hut.</p><p>“I’ll be fine from here Professor.” Hera said, and looked up. The moon was shining down on her. The feeling that she had missed last night returned. She closed her eyes and breathed deeply.</p><p>“Good evening, Miss Potter.” She said, then added. “The headmaster told me that if he requires your presence with the governors that he will send up gold sparks.” Hera nodded, and sat down in the grass. McGonagall departed back to the castle.</p><p>Hera only had to wait a few minutes this time, but she didn’t have time to ponder if it was the effect of the direct moonlight, compared to the ambient moonlight in the Shack.</p><p>She took the meat out of her bag and felt the change. It felt easier than the previous night. Soon she was a wolf on all fours, snapping down the steaks.</p><p>She sat up and let out a howl at the moon. She felt it’s light within her.</p><p>She pushed her clothes over next to her bag, in the shadow of one of the standing stones. She turned suddenly, she smelt something on the air. An animal, small, furry. She shot off after it.</p><p>Something darted away in front of her, it was long and thin. She chased it into the forest, dodging trees left, right, and the occasional one below. She chased the thing and soon she was close enough…</p><p>She leapt, only for the thing to veer to the left, she scrambled to change course too, and just managed before tripping. She had lost ground, though. She ran.</p><p>She continued the pursuit, she could tell that the thin was tiring now, but she could run for hours. But up ahead, she saw a hole.</p><p>A burrow.</p><p>She ran faster, trying to catch the thing, she dived after it. It was too quick, I wiggled into the burrow before she could grab onto it. She growled angrily, and stuck her snout into the burrow, snapping at the air. She backed off.</p><p>Let it think it was safe for now…</p><p>She saw movement in the hole and her front leg shot into the darkness. Her paw landed on fur and skin. She moved it slightly, hoping to scoop the thing out of its burrow. She could feel it being dragged out, and she opened her jaws, hoping to tempt a foolish escape attempt.</p><p>She felt a sting on her forelimb, and let out a yelp. She batted at the thing and it stilled slightly. She managed to scoop it out of the hole, and saw it was a stoat. Her jaws clasped around its neck and she shook it.</p><p>It was delicious. She ate the whole thing, there was no leftovers for the trees this time, she pushed the bony carcass back into the burrow.</p><p>Her need for food and the hunt sated, she began to move towards the edge of the forest at a trot.</p><p>She saw gold sparks shoot up as she left the forest, and remembered that that was the signal that Dumbledore wanted to see her.</p><p>She took off running towards the sparks.</p><p>Eventually thirteen wizards came into view. She slowed as she approached them.</p><p>“This is the student, Albus?” said a red-haired wizard who reminded her of Ron.</p><p>“It is indeed, Ignatius.” The headmaster said. She reached them and turned on the spot a few times, before lying down. “As you can see, they are completely docile and in control.”</p><p>“Docile mayhap, but…” Said a black-haired wizard. “How can we know they are in control?”</p><p>“A reasonable question, Perseus.” Dumbledore said. “Would you like to ask them to do something?”</p><p>“How about…” the wizard paused to think for a second. “tap your paw on the ground three times.” She did so, and Perseus’ eyebrows raised. “Well, I am convinced.”</p><p>“Whether the beast is in control now makes no difference.” Said a wizard with long silvery blond hair, he looked a little like the blond boy, Mr Malfoy, from the forest. “The beast must be slaughtered immediately.”</p><p>“That is most unnecessary, Lord Malfoy.” Dumbledore said. “As you may be aware from your father’s tenure as a school Governor, he approved the education of a young werewolf on campus.”</p><p>“That is quite impossible.” Lord Malfoy said.</p><p>“I have the minutes from that exact meeting, and although the name of the student has been expunged for privacy reasons, Abraxas did acquiesce to the requests from the rest of the board.” Dumbledore countered. “And in that case the werewolf was not able to control themselves when transformed.”</p><p>This seemed to shut Lord Malfoy up, although he showed signs of grumbling.</p><p>“So, if that covers everything…” Dumbledore said. “Shall we head back up to the castle to vote?”</p><p>“Yes, I believe so.” The red-haired Wizard said.</p><p>“Very well, thank you for your participation, young student, you may go back to your running.” Dumbledore said. Hera yipped and turned, walking off to find a place to lie down.</p><p>She eventually settled next to her bag in the stone circle. She sent a last howl of thanks to the moon, and fell asleep, content.</p><p> </p><p>The next morning, Hera awoke after a restful night sleep. She dressed and made her way up to the castle. Although moon would not return to full for another month, she knew she could go back to her usual schedule when it came.</p><p>But there was also the matter of the Philosopher’s Stone. They had just been down to visit Hagrid after their last exam when he accidently let slip that Norbert’s original owner had gotten a few answers out of him about fluffy.</p><p>That confirmed it, someone would be going after the stone, and soon. They took their suspicions to McGonagall, but she only made them panic further, as Dumbledore had taken off for the ministry in London.</p><p>It was Hermione who figured it out. Lord Voldemort was responsible, Dumbledore was the only one he had ever feared, and he must be going after the stone that night.</p><p> </p><p>They ventured forth: Hera, Hermione, Neville, and Ron. Hera calmed fluffy, the cause of their canine connection now revealed (except to Ron), Neville knew Devil’s Snare. The flying keys were difficult, but with four of them led by the only competent flier, Ron, they managed to beat them too. Unfortunately, despite Ron’s stellar chess skill, both he and Neville were taken to set up a checkmate for Hera. Hermione went backwards from Snape’s logic puzzle, and Hera went forwards.</p><p>Quirrell was there, Voldemort’s presence on the back of his head was revealed. She saw herself in the mirror of Erised, still surrounded by the women, slip the philosopher’s stone into her pocket.</p><p>Voldemort Commanded that Quirrell take it from her. His hands closed around her neck, squeezing hard. Hera felt a shadow of her wolfish instincts well up from deep inside her. She kneed him in the groin, and his grip loosened for a second, allowing her to reverse their positions, she began beating his face, punch after punch.</p><p>He grabbed her arms as she was about to deliver a blow; she used the point as a pivot and dove towards his neck, blunt human teeth not nearly as effective as her fangs. But they still broke skin. Blood exploded into her mouth, she had hit an artery. Quirrell’s grip loosened again, and she resumed punching until he wasn’t moving.</p><p>She rolled off him and spat out the foul-tasting blood. As she lay there, Quirrell’s body crumbled to dust. She moved over, just as the spectre of Lord Voldemort exited the ashes. It passed through her and flew away.</p><p>Hera felt her vision fading, and while she struggled to hold onto consciousness, she could hear someone calling her name.</p><p>“Hera. Hera. Hera.” It was familiar, but panicked unlike she had heard it before. She passed out.</p><p> </p><p>“Hera.” Another voice, one that she didn’t recognise, called to her. “My brave little wolf.”</p><p> </p><p>She woke up in the hospital wing.</p><p>Dumbledore was there.</p><p>“Professor!” she tried to sit up in bed, but found that doing so made her head pound terribly. “Ow…”</p><p>“Ah, Hera.” He said. “You gave us all quite a scare. Madam Pomfrey wasn’t sure when you were going to wake up.”</p><p>“Is it all okay, sir?” she asked. “Voldemort didn’t get the stone, did he?”</p><p>“No, he did not, you did quite a good job at preventing that.” He smiled, his eyes twinkling slightly. “The stone is, however, to be destroyed.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Me and Mr Flamel have decided it is for the best.” Dumbledore said, solemnly. Hera’s face drooped into a frown. “Do not be sorry, my dear girl, He and his wife have enough Elixir to set their affairs in order before they die.”</p><p>“Oh, ok.” She wasn’t sure what she should say to that.</p><p>“Hera?” Dumbledore asked. “I don’t suppose that you saw anything strange happen to Professor Quirrell when he tried to hurt you?”</p><p>“No, nothing I can think of, Professor.” She said, and it was the truth, why would something happen? “Was something supposed to?”</p><p>“I thought perhaps…” he started. “Nevermind.”</p><p>“Is it about me, sir?” She asked.</p><p>“Yes,” he said, then seemingly resolved to explain his former hypothesis. “On the night your parents died, I believe that your mother died to save you, she tried reasoning with Lord Voldemort, offered herself instead of you. Lord Voldemort killed her.”</p><p>“And then he tried to kill me?”</p><p>“Yes, but I believe that you were protected by love.” Dumbledore said.</p><p>“Love?” she asked, not understanding in the slightest.</p><p>“Yes, love. I believed that your mother’s sacrifice had instilled a protection against Lord Voldemort into your blood.” He said.</p><p>“So that’s why he couldn’t kill me?”</p><p>“Perhaps, but the lack of any reaction in your encounter with Quirrell makes me doubt it.”</p><p>“But you said it gave protection against Voldemort,” she said. “That might not count for Professor Quirrell.” Dumbledore raised his eyebrows.</p><p>“Indeed, it might not,” He said. “I had expected it to, with Quirrell sharing body and soul with Voldemort, but perhaps not.”</p><p>They talked for a little longer. About why Voldemort was after the Stone, what the trick to the mirror of Erised was, and finally, what happened after Hera blacked out.</p><p>“I…” Hera screwed up her face, trying to recall the memory from when she had passed out. “I think there was someone calling to me.”</p><p>“Curious.” He whispered. Then brightened suddenly. “Well, you have been sent quite a few presents from your fellow students. I hope you don’t mind if I help myself to one of these ‘Every Flavour Beans’?”</p><p>“Not at all, I don’t really like them.” She said. He took a bean, popped it into his mouth, and grimaced. He declared that it was earwax flavour.</p><p> </p><p>She was up and walking around by the night she woke, but Madam Pomfrey didn’t want her to leave until she had been under at least 24 hours of conscious surveillance. Hera pouted at this, but accepted the helpful Matron’s orders.</p><p>Her friends had been allowed in to see her, which was a relief.</p><p>“Hera!” Hermione threw her arms around her neck. “You’re alright.”</p><p>“I know that!” She said, but still hugging back.</p><p>“Any clue as to when Madam Pomfrey is letting you out?” Neville said, hugging her too. Plainly the full moon was on his mind.</p><p>“Tomorrow. I can’t wait.” She said.</p><p>“Oh, cool.” Ron said, Hera turned her attention to him, only to find he was looking at her pile of sweets. “You don’t like Drooble’s, do you Hera?”</p><p>“Nah, take what you like.” She smiled.</p><p> </p><p>Everything was back to normal after their exams. But soon enough they would be packed and ready to leave. Dumbledore sent her an owl on the day that she was to leave  on the Hogwarts express that told her to come to his office instead of accompanying the other students in the carriages.</p><p>“Hera.” He said gravely. “I have been in correspondence with your Aunt and Uncle, and have firmly told them I disapprove of how you have been treated. I will be visiting in the next few days, and I will collect you on the day of the first full moon during the holidays, and returning you after the last.”</p><p>“Thank you, sir.” She said. Hopefully she wouldn’t have to cook breakfast every morning from now on.</p><p>“It is up to you whether I should reveal the reason behind these absences.”</p><p>She huffed, that warranted thinking about. If they did know it would probably be bad, but if they did, they might understand why it was so important she did. But if they know she could control herself they might just keep her locked up as punishment.</p><p>“I’m…” She thought a little longer. “I don’t think you should, sir.”</p><p>“Very well, Hera.”</p><p>Dumbledore then moved over to a fireplace, through some powder into it that made the flames turn green, and told her to step through.</p><p>She did so, and found herself stepping out of a fireplace inside the office at Hogsmeade station. She left and boarded the train to find her friends.</p><p>And although she had only experienced the full moon cycle once as a wolf, she knew that this was the start of something incredible.</p>
