    <p>This collection of minifics will most likely be updated each Monday. Each one is a standalone. They are in no particular order with reference to the canon timeline, as I hit a random word generator for something to use as a title and base the fic on that. I may choose to expand one or more of these into a full-length story at some point, but I don't know when or if that will happen. And of course, I don't own Harry Potter, etc., I just play with the characters and setting for my own enjoyment and promise to put them back neatly when I'm done.</p>
