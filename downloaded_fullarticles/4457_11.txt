He didn’t change his expression when his book was stolen, Sirius placing the bookmark in his page before the book was placed aside. Sirius was up in his face now, which wasn’t unusual, but Remus found himself trying to present himself from blushing.</p><p>“Please help me find a gift for Prongs!” Sirius asked, and Remus couldn’t avoid the puppy eyes being sent to him. Which seemed completely unfair because he could actually turn into a dog, but Remus knew he would’ve done it anyway. He couldn’t resist Sirius if he tried, and he knew it.</p><p>He sighed and smiled, shaking his head slightly. “You’re hopeless, Pads.”</p><p>No matter the insult, Sirius was grinning happily, realising he was going to be getting the help he asked for. He sat up slightly taller, looking at Remus and clearing waiting for Remus to speak to him. Remus was often considered the brains of the Marauder’s, easily patching up their pranks when they went sour, taking notes during classes (sometimes reluctantly) letting his friends copy, sometimes even helping them study.</p><p>Remus sat back slightly, still taller than Sirius even as he hunched over. “C’mon Padfoot, it’s easy. James is obsessed with one thing-“</p><p>“Lily Evans,” Said Sirius.</p><p>“-Fine, two things. Quidditch.” Remus scoffed, turning away slightly to stifle a yawn, shaking his head slightly before continuing. “Look, it’s a Hogsmade weekend. I promise I’ll go out with again so we can find a gift for him, yeah?”</p><p>Sirius was grinning still as he nodded. “You’re a genius, Remus Lupin,” and prompted to lean over and kiss Remus smack-bang on the cheek, before getting up and walking to the dorm door, most likely going to look for their other two friends. He turned back first. “Get some sleep, you’ve been studying too much.”</p><p>After he left, Remus groaned and hit his forehead with the book.</p></div>
