<p>Harry was walking back to the Gryffindor tower when he saw it, a
corn snake, the thickest part of it was about as round as his thumb
and it was only about a foot long. It was pale almost white, an
albino, but the pale yellow-orange markings along it’s back had
been charmed to a vibrant green.</p>
<p>Harry glanced around for the owner but the hallway was empty,
there wasn’t even the sound of retreating footsteps.</p>
<p>He dropped into a crouch next to the snake doggedly slithering
along the stones and hissed a quiet greeting, “<i>Hello, little
one, are you lost?</i>”</p>
<p>The snake lifted its head, looking as startled as a snake can to
be talked to by a human. The snake seemed to think a great while
before she answered in a prim tone, “<i>No. I am certain of my
way but I am cold. I would warm myself with your heat.</i>”</p>
<p>Harry held out his hand and the little snake slid into it, her
small little body was chilled from the stone floor. He stood and
leaned back against the wall, cupping the snake in both hands, “<i>Where
are you going</i>?” he asked.</p>
<p>The snake flicked her tongue, “<i>You would know my business
without even asking my name or offering your own? Are all humans so
rude</i>?”</p>
<p>Harry blinked and then grinned, “<i>No, just me
probably</i>,” he hissed apologetically, “<i>May I ask
what your name is?</i>”</p>
<p>“<i>You may,</i>” the snake said bobbing her head
slightly in something like a nod, “<i>Among my own I was known
as Little White. My human calls me something like Morning, it is not
a name I recognise or could pronounce in the proper tongue.</i>”</p>
<p>“<i>A pleasure to meet you, Little White. I am </i>Harry
Potter <i>but you may call me what you like,</i>” Harry
said.</p>
<p>Little White raised her head higher, turning her head this way and
that to get a better look at him.</p>
<p>“<i>Would you like any help?</i>” Harry asked again
now that the introductions were complete.</p>
<p>Little White flicked her tongue out furiously, “<i>It
appears I require no more help as it was you I was looking for, Hairy
Pot-Maker</i>.”</p>
<p>Harry winced, he really did not like the literal representation of
his name in parsel tongue.</p>
<p>“<i>I was headed to your nest,</i>” Little White said,
“<i>I thought perhaps I could do something, as hopeless as it
is to try and do anything with most of your kind. You are all
intolerably stupid. I am pleased to know you can at least manage the
true tongue.</i>”</p>
<p>“<i>Thank you?</i>” Harry said, grinning in something
between amusement and disbelief at this little snake’s cheek.</p>
<p>Little White regally dipped her head again, “<i>You are most
welcome, Hairy Pot-Maker.</i>”</p>
<p>Harry winced again, “<i>I would rather you didn’t call
me that. Really, anything else would be better.</i>”</p>
<p>“<i>Then should I call you raven-locked or emerald eye or
perhaps hearts-desire?</i>” Little White asked archly.</p>
<p>“<i>What?</i>” Harry blinked in surprise.</p>
<p>Little White shifted in his palms to a spot with more warmth, “<i>My
human calls you those things, amongst others in the silence of his
den. I do not understand ‘love’ and 'desire’. It
makes little sense to me. A snake seeks the company of other snakes
only to mate and then they separate. Yet you humans seem drawn to one
another often.</i>” she cocked her head slightly, “<i>Perhaps
it is your warmth, I can understand that. Human warmth is very
desirable, a pair of humans might share warmth together.</i>”</p>
<p>“…<i>So you wanted to help your human?</i>”
Harry asked, feeling a little flushed that someone, a Slytherin
someone, had a crush on him.</p>
<p>“<i>Yes. He is heart-sick for wanting you yet he will not
speak his desire. He believes you would be opposed, to the point of
anger or even violence.</i>” Little White said, watching him
intently.</p>
<p>“<i>I wouldn’t do that,</i>” Harry hurriedly
assure her.</p>
<p>“<i>I believe this of you</i>,” Little White said,
thoroughly unimpressed with him, “<i>Despite his wanting of you
I find it unlikely that you are worthy. My human is very warm and
provides fine mice for me. He calls me beautiful. I would not share
his warmth.</i>”</p>
<p>Harry’s brow furrowed, “<i>but weren’t you
coming to try and help him?</i>”</p>
<p>“<i>I have changed my mind,</i>” Little White said.
“<i>Put me down.</i>”</p>
<p>“<i>I could take you back to him?</i>” Harry offered,
mostly out of politeness.</p>
<p>Little White turned her head away, “<i>I would not have him
look upon you, ever again.</i>”</p>
<p>Harry felt a little dumbstruck. He was about to kneel and put the
little snake when he heard running footsteps and turned to look.
Malfoy was running down the hallway, his robes flapping around him,
his swept back hair falling down around his face. He had his wand in
his hand, doing what appeared to be a point me spell.</p>
<p>Malfoy zeroed in on Harry and his cupped hands immediately and
stomped over as if he wasn’t a flustered, faintly flushed mess,
“Did you find a snake, a white snake with green markings?”</p>
<p>Harry silently lowered his hands so Malfoy could better see.</p>
<p>“Morgana!” Malfoy cried in relief, he reached out to
take her and then pulled back as if he didn’t want to touch
Harry.</p>
<p>Before Harry would have interpreted that action in an entirely
different way. He felt a little dizzy.</p>
<p>Malfoy held his hand out, “My snake, if you please, Potter.”</p>
<p>Little White was flicking her tongue furiously at Harry, “<i>You
do not look at my human like that! I have decided and will not
share!</i>”</p>
<p>Harry glanced down at her, feeling a smile on his lips. He looked
back up, Malfoy was looking rather cute. He dropped his cupped hands
onto Malfoy’s warm palm, letting Little White slip down and
wrap around securely around Malfoy’s wrist. Harry curled one
hand around Malfoy’s tracing his fingers over the back of
Malfoy’s hand. He watched Malfoy’s face flush faintly, a
shiver going through his hand, the rest of him seemed to be frozen in
place.</p>
<p>Harry said, “I was was thinking-”</p>
<p>Little White lunged out, biting Harry’s thumb.</p>
<p>Harry jerked his hand back, mostly out of shock. The little snake
couldn’t really hurt him.</p>
<p>She pulled back, her body still raised high in warning, “<i>I
said No!</i>”</p>
<p>“Morgana! Why did you-! Don’t do that!” Malfoy
hissed looking a little panicked and telling Harry, “She’s
never done that before. You must have just startled her.”</p>
<p>“Right,” Harry said glaring at her. He smiled
at Malfoy, “As I was going to say, do you want to go out
sometime?”</p>
<p>Malfoy flushed even pinker, “What?”</p>
<p>“On a date,” Harry said, tempted to reach out and
touch Malfoy again but deciding against it, “I thought maybe we
could share some warmth together.”</p>
<p>Malfoy searched his expression and then hesitantly nodded.</p>
<p>Little White muttered, “<i>I’m going to shit in your
shoes.</i>”</p>
