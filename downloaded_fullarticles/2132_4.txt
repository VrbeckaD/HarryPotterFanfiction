<p>
  <span>It had been a little over a month since the final battle at Hogwarts.  Still, after all the losses, life continued to move forward. The restoration of Hogwarts was underway and Professor McGonagall’s decision to have students back the first day of September seemed to be a realistic goal.  True, life was moving at a slower pace, but it was moving </span>
  <em>
    <span>forward</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Are you almost done with that section Harry?” asked Hermione as she was looking through a collection of books in a corner of the school library.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes, I looked through all of them; they’re in perfect condition,” replied Harry.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Brilliant!  I’m almost done here then we can get them shelved,” she smiled.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Harry and Hermione decided it was best for them to stay at Hogwarts to assist with the restoration.  They both agreed that the Weasley family needed to stay together to mourn the loss of Fred. They knew that Mr. and Mrs. Weasley would be more than happy for the duo to stay at the Burrow, but Harry and Hermione agreed Hogwarts was the best option for them.  They did manage to go to the Burrow on weekends, thanks to Molly Weasley. She insisted they should take time away from their work to enjoy some home cooked meals and time with their friends.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Do you think we should leave tonight for the Burrow or wait until Saturday morning?” asked Harry as he placed the last inspected book on his stack. “I don’t really have a preference.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“You can leave whenever you like Harry.  We don’t have to go together every time,” Harry looked at his curly haired friend with a raised eyebrow.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“What’s wrong Mione?” She looked at him while squaring her shoulders.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Nothing’s wrong Harry.  I’m perfectly fine.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Really? Because you seem a bit… discombobulated.”  </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Discombobulated? Has someone been reading a dictionary?  Or do you have one of those Muggle calendars that gives you a word of the day?” snickered Hermione. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“First off, </span>
  <em>
    <span>rude</span>
  </em>
  <span>.  Secondly…it was a </span>
  <em>
    <span>thesaurus</span>
  </em>
  <span>; not a dictionary.  A very useful tool if you ask me.” He tried to hold in his laughter, but soon enough it escaped causing the friends to laugh uncontrollably.  After calming down from their laughing session, they both sat down on the floor for a much needed break.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Are you so bored with me that you are now reading reference books Harry?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Never.  I just finished my stack a while ago and picked up the book.  I’m glad to be here with you. This is important to both of us.”  Silence filled the space between the pair before Hermione turned her head to look at Harry.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m not looking forward to the weekend.  I keep imagining the looks on their faces when I tell them I’m leaving.  And so soon.” Hermione received news earlier that week that she will be able to leave the country. She had been working on a plan to go search for her parents.  Kingsley Shacklebolt and Professor McGonagall were able to secure her a Portkey that would take her to Australia in two weeks. Since international travel had been suspended, due to the fall of the Ministry, Hermione knew that this gift shouldn’t be taken for granted.  Unfortunately, leaving so soon would more than likely cause a problem between her and a certain group of redheads. Harry reached over to place his arm around the young witch.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“It’ll be alright Hermione,” whispered Harry as she laid her head on his shoulder.  “I’ll be there with you and besides,” Harry inhaled then exhaled, “I’ve decided to catch the Portkey with you.”  Hermione lifted her head to look at the green-eyed wizard.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“No, Harry! I told you this is something I can do on my own,” cried Hermione.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Shh!” Harry whispered loudly while placing his index finger against his mouth.  “We’re in a </span>
  <em>
    <span>library</span>
  </em>
  <span>.” Hermione let out a giggle despite herself.  She looked at him with a frown etched on her face.  </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I won’t ask you to come with me Harry.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“You don’t have to ask me.” Harry shrugged his shoulders. “I’m already going with you.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“What if I don’t want you to come with me?  Have you thought about that?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Tell me </span>
  <em>
    <span>Ms. Granger</span>
  </em>
  <span>.  If I had to leave to search for something…something </span>
  <em>
    <span>extremely</span>
  </em>
  <span> important would you help me try to find it?” Hermione narrowed her eyes at him. “Oh! Wait a second!  You </span>
  <em>
    <span>already</span>
  </em>
  <span> did!”  Harry shook his head.  “How could I forget?” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh…sod off Harry James Potter!” Hermione scowled playfully as she tried to stand.  Harry quickly grabbed her before she fully stood causing her to trip on her foot. As she fell back down, Harry caught her in his arms preventing her from falling face first onto the stone floor.  When he opened his eyes, his face was between two curtains of chestnut locks and a scent that he recognized only as Hermione. They stayed in that position for awhile; his emerald eyes looking into her chocolate brown.  Both of their cheeks showing a hint of pink as he reached up placing his hand behind her neck, slowly pulling her face towards him. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He wanted to kiss her but gave her the opportunity to turn away.  As luck would have it, the witch started to lower her head without needing his hand for assistance.  Harry kissed her deeply skipping over the idea of a chaste kiss. He then nipped her bottom lip to allow him entry into her mouth.  She parted her lips letting his tongue happily greet hers. A moan came from Hermione’s throat while Harry quickly moved her beneath him.  She spread her legs a little wider allowing Harry to settled in-between them. As she started moving her hips Harry let out a deep groan. The friction between them causing them to produce new sounds from each other.  He moved his mouth to place kisses along her jawline while moving his hands through her hair. A grin stretched across his lips as he heard her moan “Y-Yes Harry.” He was amazed how her small gasps were causing him to grow even harder.  His erection fighting to be released from under its denim prison.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I have been wanting to feel you like this...for a while now,” he told her.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh, Harry, I-I don’t know what to say,” she answered as the pink from her cheeks spread to her neck.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Nothing to say? My Hermione?” he smiled.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“How long?” she asked as she looked into his eyes.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I knew that night in Godric’s Hollow.”  He noticed the softness in her eyes as he continued.  “When we were at the cemetery. I knew that you were the only person I wanted there with me.  That morning when I woke up and you healed my wounds. I didn’t need anymore convincing.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>A tear fell from the corner of Hermione’s eye.  “This isn’t going to go well with the other people in our lives.” she said as she wiped the tear away. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Probably not...but I’m ready to live my own life.  One of my choosing.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione observed the handsome wizard above her for awhile, then a a grin stretched across her lips.  “Remove your t-shirt Harry,” she replied in a tone that demanded action.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Are you sure Hermione?” he asked.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Don’t make me repeat myself.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He raised to his knees to pull the shirt over his head.  Hermione reached out to rub his chest causing goosebumps to appear over his torso.  As he started to lean forward, Hermione placed her hand on his chest to stop him.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“‘I ready to live my own life too. I choose this.” She smiled lifting her arms above her head.  “Now me.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Harry mirrored her expression. “Why of course, lovely witch.”  Hermione’s plain white t-shirt had already ridden up her torso, so he teasingly started out slow pushing the hem of her shirt up.  He noticed her nipples pressing through the thin fabric of her nude bra, he realized that this was the most erotic thing that has ever happened to him.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Beautiful,” he breathed. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“You’re not so bad yourself, </span>
  <em>
    <span>Mr. Potter</span>
  </em>
  <span>.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He smiled as he returned to his original position; kissing her with all the passion he can summon.  He lowered his mouth once more kissing the scar that stretched down her neck. The angry mark that was left by Bellatrix Lastrange’s cursed blade.  As he continued his path down, he ran his tongue over her collar bone causing her to rub her core harder against his erection. The delicious connection brought about him pushing the cups of Hermione’s bra down and slipping her perky nipple into his mouth.  Sucking and licking to see what new sounds he can get out of her. “Fuck me!” she exclaimed. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Mr. Potter, Ms. Granger!” came a voice a few stacks down from their location.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Shite!” they both said, as they hastily got off the floor grabbing their discarded t-shirts.  They quickly pulled their shirts over their heads and straighten their clothes. Harry reached over to push a few stands of Hermione’s hair out of her face while Hermione reached over with an attempt to fix his messy black hair.  They smiled at each other while Hermione leaned forward placing a chaste kiss to his lips. As her eyes looked down a gasp left her mouth. “Here…you’ll need this,” she told Harry as she grabbed a book next to her. He looked at her with confusion until she lowered her eyes again.  As he followed her gaze his eyes widened and he grabbed the book quickly from her hand to place in front of his obvious hard on. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Over here, Madam Pince!” Hermione called out. She once again began straightening her clothes, but was interrupted when she heard Harry laugh.  A large grin spread across his face as he returned his gaze to her.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I told you a thesaurus is a useful tool.” he said.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione was a lovely shade of pink as Madam Pince turned the corner.</span>
