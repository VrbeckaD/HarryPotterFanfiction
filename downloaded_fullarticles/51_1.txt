          <div class="userstuff"><p>Lyra Malfoy had always dreamed of a great romance. An ironic fact considering that Lyra liked to consider herself an unemotional bitch who needed nothing or no one (save her friends of course).  Still a part of her, a great part of her, more than even she was willing to admit, <em>desperately </em>wanted a great, magical, whirlwind romance. The sort of romance that Jane Austen might write about or Nancy Meyers might make a film about. It was ridiculous and absurd and yet...sometimes it felt as though it was all she could think about.  </p><p>She wanted these things, terribly, but she was also exhausted. Dating was exhausting, men were exhausting, and up until recently, she had never even considered women to be on the table. Even then, she doubted herself. As a bi trans woman, she didn’t think she was exactly the most amazing candidate. Still, she forced herself to go out regularly. If for no other reason than so she could properly get sloshed and not have to spend almost every waking moment thinking about how she would much rather be with a partner right about now.</p><p>If she was honest, she wasn’t much for the clubs, but it felt, necessary somehow.</p><p>“Come out with me tonight darling,” her best friend Pansy had said. “It’ll be fun,” Lyra very much doubted it, but she supposed she could give it a try, it wasn’t as though she had anything else going on at present.</p><p>“Very well,” she said dragging herself out of bed.</p><p>Pansy grinned, “It’s going to be great,” she promised.</p><p>“Right,” Lyra said, stepping into her walk-in closet to find a dress. She didn’t know what she wanted exactly, but she knew she wanted something different she supposed. Her usual little black dress wouldn’t quite cut it tonight, she thought. <em>Green always makes me look good</em>. Eyeing the backless sparkling emerald dress she had in her closet for just such an occasion. <em>Eh, why not? </em> She pulled the gown off the hanger. <em>If nothing else, she would look stunning, </em>she thought to herself, quickly changing her clothes, and slipping into her heels.</p><p>Pansy smirked as Lyra threw together a quick smokey makeup look, and her favorite shade of red lipstick, and the two headed out the door, down to Pansy’s car.</p><p>“So where are you taking me?” Lyra asked.</p><p>“Don’t you worry darling, it’s a fabulous little club, you’re going to love it,” she promised. Lyra didn’t entirely doubt her friend, after all, clubbing with Pansy was usually fun, if for no other reason than to watch her at work. Pansy was a master class in flirting, and getting particularly beautiful women to snog her for the better part of the night. Pansy was, particularly fit, which meant that she could usually pull anyone she wanted to. </p><p>Pansy had a bad habit of being known as something of a womanizer. She would entice women into her bed, fuck them, then kick them out before they could ever become too attached. </p><p>Lyra wasn’t sure she could handle that kind of rejection.</p><p>“You just need a proper shag,” Pansy would always tell her. “You’ll think more clearly, you’ll be able to figure things out, trust me. I’m an expert.”</p><p>Pansy didn’t quite get Lyra’s dream of the great romance, and that <em>just having a shag </em>wasn’t exactly in Lyra’s wheelhouse. She needed something special, a connection, not something she thought she was going to find in some club.</p><p><em>Still</em>, she told herself. <em>Tonight isn’t about love or shagging. It’s about fun.</em></p><p>The club itself looked relatively new, it was only a few blocks away from Lyra’s flat, which was good in case she needed a quick escape. Pansy would likely end up in the loo in an hour fingering some girl and would probably forget she had even brought Lyra. Having a quick route home was always best.</p><p>It was quickly apparent however, upon entry that where Pansy had taken her friend was, not so much a club as she had expected, but, “A jazz bar?”</p><p>Pansy smirked. “You like jazz,” she said.</p><p>“Yes but…”</p><p>Pansy merely shushed her, there was a band playing currently, and she pulled them up a seat towards the middle. “There’s this wonderful sax player I’m absolutely mad for.”</p><p>Lyra groaned, as she took a seat, “Pans… a sax player? Really?”</p><p>“It’s not like that,” she argued. “I’m not mad for her in like, I want to taker her ‘round the back and shag her, I’m mad for her skills.”</p><p>Lyra snorted, shaking her head. “There’s no one you’re mad for you don’t want to shag.”</p><p>Pansy merely smirked, elbowing Lyra’s shoulder then and gave her a wink. Lyra could only laugh. Well, she supposed a jazz bar might certainly be a better place than some random club if she wanted to find someone more her type, or at least, more to her liking.</p><p>The current player ended, and a tall man with a very soothing voice came up to the microphone to announce the next musician. “Alright folks, the time has come, the woman of the hour, Ms. Hari Potter.”</p><p>Pansy grinned excitedly, applauding. Lyra clapped along with everyone else as the woman came on to the stage.</p><p>Suddenly, everything felt as though it had gone into slow motion. <em>Oh my god, </em>Lyra couldn’t help but stare, like a lovesick schoolgirl. She could feel Pansy side-eye her, but she didn’t care. She was not about to take her eyes off Hari for even a moment.</p><p>Lyra had never been particularly keen on jazz, but suddenly it was the only music she wanted to listen to for the rest of her life. Lyra stared at her, dreamily, barely sure what to take in first. She was fit, that was obvious, and she had shaggy black hair that seemed to slip into her eyes more often than not, which were brilliant and emerald. And she was currently wearing a red hoodie jacket with, presumably some Uni on it she wasn’t sure she recognized, and black trousers. What really stood out to her however was her hands. The brilliant sinew and veins that trailed up her arms that made Lyra’s breath catch in her throat. They looked somewhat rough and calloused, likely from playing too much.</p><p>“Well, what do you think?” Pansy whispered.</p><p>Lyra blinked, “She’s brilliant.”</p><p>Pansy grinned, “I knew you’d love her.”  </p><p>Hari’s set ended, far too quickly for Lyra’s liking, and just like that she stepped off the stage to roaring applause.</p><p>“We should go meet her,” Pansy said.</p><p>“Can we do that?” Lyra asked.</p><p>Pansy smirked, “I know the manager,” she replied. Lyra eyed her, <em>knowing the manager </em>was Pansy speak for, I fucked someone high up here and now I can do whatever I want. She grinned.</p><p>“Lead the way then,” Lyra replied. For once, Pansy’s master skills were paying off in <em>her </em>favor, Lyra thought as the two made their way towards the backstage area. Pansy moved first, clearly flirting with one of the security personell as Lyra merely stood off to the side, trying not to make herself known, as she eyed Hari. She was currently tuning a guitar, and it was all Lyra could do not to swoon. It didn’t help that it was rather warm in the back area, and she was feeling a touch lightheaded. Pansy made quick work of the security however, and moments later, the two women were standing in front of Hari Potter.</p><p>“Hi there, I just wanted to say I think you’re absolutely brilliant,” Pansy said.</p><p>“Thanks, mate,” Hari replied. Lyra was trying to look anywhere but at Hari, worried that if she actually spoke to the other woman she would absolutely say something so foolish and embarrass herself so spectacularly that she would absolutely have to throw herself into the Thames to recover. “And who might your friend be?” she asked.</p><p>Lyra sucked in a breath, forcing herself to look over at Hari, who was now standing, just inches in front of her. Hari’s eyes bored into Lyra’s own, and it was all she could do not to melt. “L-Lyra,” she stammered. Lyra groaned to herself, she didn’t stammer, <em>what the bloody hell is wrong with me? </em>Hari merely grinned a cheeky, perfectly adorable grin that made Lyra’s knees go weak.</p><p>“So you’re who was distracting me the whole set,” Hari said.</p><p>Lyra blushed crimson, “I… was I?”</p><p>Hari smirked, “Your dress kept catching the light and blinding me.”</p><p>“Oh,” Lyra’s face fell, and Hari chuckled.</p><p>“I’m kidding, of course,” she said. “You’re just so damn stunningly beautiful.”</p><p>Lyra blushed impossibly deeper at that. “T-thank you.”</p><p>“I just remembered, I…uh… have a thing,” Pansy said suddenly. “I should go. It was lovely to have met you Hari,” she said.</p><p>“Likewise,” Hari replied, never taking her eyes off of Lyra. Lyra looked over at her friend, somewhat nervously. Pansy gave her a big thumbs up and Lyra found herself trapped in Hari’s gaze. “You two aren’t together are you?” she asked.</p><p>“No,” Lyra replied, willing herself not to stare at Hari’s lips.</p><p>Hari grinned, “Good, because I’d feel just terrible if I had to steal you away from someone,” she said.</p><p>Lyra swallowed. “No no, very… single,” she said.</p><p>Harri smirked, leaning in towards her, their lips just millimeters apart. Lyra gasped. “There’s probably something I should tell you,” she said.</p><p>“You’re not straight are you?” Hari asked.</p><p>Lyra chuckled, “Bi, actually, but no that wasn’t it.”</p><p>“So you’ve never been with a woman before?” Hari asked.</p><p>“I… no, but that wasn’t it either,” Lyra explained. Hari merely gave her a look then and Lyra swallowed. <em>Now or never, </em>she thought. She always hated this part. It was sort of like ripping off a bandaid if said bandaid was also attached to a bomb. “I’m trans,” she said. “And I haven’t really had the opportunity to get any sort of surgery, and…” the floodgates had opened and Lyra could barely stop her mouth. Fortunately for her, Hari knew just how to stop her dead in her tracks. Before Lyra could get too far in her usual speech, Hari’s lips pressed against her own and Lyra fell silent.</p><p>Hari smiled against her lips, “Thank you for being so candid with me,” she said after a moment.</p><p>“You’re welcome,” Lyra replied, blushing again. Hari smirked.</p><p>“You’re so adorable when you’re embarrassed, has anybody ever told you that?”</p><p>“I’m not embarrassed,” Lyra replied. “I’m nervous. I’ve never snogged a brilliant jazz player before. Especially not one who looks like you.”</p><p>“Oh really? And what does me look like?” Hari asked.</p><p>Lyra shivered, “Bloody fit.”</p><p>Hari grinned, shoving her back against the nearest wall, eliciting a gasp from Lyra that was quickly covered by Hari’s lips on hers once more. Lyra moaned into Hari’s mouth, desperate for more.</p><p>“Don’t you have another show to do?” Lyra asked.</p><p>“Fuck the show,” Hari growled, kissing down her jaw, towards her throat. Lyra moaned, arching her back off the wall, while just outside she could hear the growing chants of, ‘Hari, Hari, Hari,’</p><p>“Your public will be very disappointed,” Lyra said, with her last two brain cells that were not currently desperately interested in Hari’s hand on her thigh.</p><p>Hari sucked hard on her throat, hard enough to leave a bruise and make Lyra’s legs tremble. “I’m marking my spot,” Hari whispered, and with that, she slipped away, grabbed her guitar and headed out on stage. Lyra wobbled in her spot, her legs trembling and her head spinning. Hari was a magnificent kisser, she noted vaguely, listening to her second number with whatever brain cells she still had left.</p><p class="p1">
