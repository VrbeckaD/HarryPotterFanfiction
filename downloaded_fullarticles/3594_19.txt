    <p>Eleven-year-old Tris Rain gripped the cart tightly. Platform 9 and ¾? She couldn’t believe her day had finally arrived! But her stomach twisted in anxious knots. Her parents smiled next to her. “It’ll be alright sweetheart. You can do it.” Her mother said eternally proud of her young daughter.</p><p>“I don’t know if I can,” Tris said timidly. Then she heard a voice give a greeting from behind her.; Turning around she saw a blonde teenager with a trunk of her own, wearing a bright smile.</p><p>“My name is Clarke.” Clarke extended her hand. Tris shook it back and saw Clarke had a white owl in her cart. “Is this your first time trying to get onto the platform?” Tris nodded timidly. “That’s alright, sweetie. All you have to do is walk straight into the wall between platforms nine and ten. Best to give a bit of a run if you’re nervous.” Tris looked wide-eyed at Clarke and Clarke responded with a slight chuckle.</p><p>“I was especially nervous my first time around too.” Just then a loud voice echoed through the platform.</p><p>“Hey, Griffin!” Clarke rolled her eyes.</p><p>“Hello, Raven,” Clarke greeted, “I don’t think they heard you in Liverpool,” Raven grinned in response.</p><p>“Who’s the munchkin?” Raven asked though her tone was light and joyful and caused Tris to smile.</p><p>“This is Tris, and she’s a little bit nervous about getting onto the platform. Care to go first?”</p><p>“No problem. My name’s Raven, kid and you’ve got nothing to worry about.” Just then Raven took her trunk and walked onto the platform, watching Raven disappear before her very eyes.</p><p>“Awesome!” Tris exclaimed excited, and Clarke smiled wide.</p><p>“Ready to give it a try?” Tris nodded enthusiastically. She took a deep breath before running straight into the wall. But she didn’t crash. Instead, Tris made it and she before her, in its magnitude, the Hogwarts Express. Clarke went after her, and her parents joined her.</p><p>“Good job, Tris!” Clarke exclaimed. “Now get your stuff on board and then get on yourself. Try to find some other first years to sit with. You’ll make your best friends on this train; I know I did. If you ever need anything, don’t hesitate to come ask for help.”</p><p>“Thank you, Clarke.” Tris gushed. Tris’s parents turned to look at Clarke.</p><p>“Thank you, Clarke.”</p><p>“My pleasure, ma’ams,” Clarke responded politely. “Now if you’ll excuse me, I must get on the train myself.” With that, Clarke left and boarded the train to Hogwarts.  </p><p> </p><p>Alexandria (Lexa) Woods exited the car and went to the trunk to get her things. Mercifully, she was allowed to stand up. The long car ride was killing her.</p><p>“Now, Alexandria,” Nia, her foster mother, said, “I expect you to behave and to keep your grades up.”</p><p>“Yes, ma’am,” Lexa said, not making eye contact with her. Ontari rolled her eyes. If only everyone at school saw how Lexa interacted with their foster mother, she wouldn’t be so feared. Though to be fair, she couldn’t really blame Lexa, not that Ontari would ever admit it.</p><p>“I better not get one bad report, or there will be consequences. Clear?” Nia’s eyes bore into Lexa and Lexa returned the glare.</p><p>“Crystal, ma’am,” Lexa said, not allowing to show Nia any weakness. Nia nodded before leaving Lexa alone to go speak with Ontari. Lexa made her way through the station, leaving Ontari back at the car and walked through the barrier and onto Platform 9 and ¾. She and Ontari were not friends. They were foster sisters, but they never interacted unless forced. No one knew of their connection at school, and both preferred to keep their home lives private. Lexa boarded the train, ready to start her fifth year.</p><p>Lexa Woods was unlike any other student. She not only garnered respect but also commanded it. Lexa, the youngest Quidditch captain in Hogwarts history, having ascended in only her third year, was the most talented seeker the school had seen in years. When her teammates started calling her ‘Commander’ rather than ‘Captain’ the title spread like wildfire and nearly all of the student body addressed her as such, not that she minded. Her elevated social status did not make her popular, though, respected and revered, but not popular. Lexa spent most of her days alone; not that she minded.  </p><p>When she received the letter that she’d been made a prefect, it was not surprising; though Nia did throw a small party for her and the other foster children in celebration of Lexa’s accomplishment. Nia was not a sadist; she just had high standards, and both positive and negative reinforcement were regularly used in her home.</p><p>Lexa delayed making her way to the prefect carriage. It sat at the head of the train, but she boarded at the end of the train, preferring to eye new students and take advantage of the ability to stroll the train. Once they departed, she wouldn’t be allowed to walk until the end of the train ride. The train ride for prefects was spent preparing for the upcoming year. The two Head Students would lead the discussion, and the upper-level prefects would give tips and advice to the new prefects as well as create schedules for patrol and other various duties. She made her way to the carriage just as the train was about to depart. She was still only the third person there, behind Head Boy Tristan Taylor and fifth-year Finn Collins.</p><p>Both Tristan and Finn played for the Hufflepuff Quidditch team as a beater and chaser respectively. Finn was a laid back, easygoing guy but a little too idealistic. He had great ideas but never thought any of them through too well. Finn attracted the attention of both men and women, and while he did not fancy the same sex, he was never disgusted by the attention some of the male students gave him. He preferred to be honest about his sexuality and let them off easy. Lexa guessed it was the floppy hair and genuine smile that turned on his admirers.</p><p>Tristan, on the other hand, was much harder to get along. He was fierce and straightforward. It did not stop him from being popular amongst the students, hence being Head Boy, but there was a reason he was a beater. Nevertheless, he was a nice enough guy and willing to help out others in his house. Though make fun of the alliteration in his name and you’d be cleaning bathrooms like a muggle for a week.</p><p>“Commander,” they both addressed as Lexa made her way into the carriage.</p><p>“Gentlemen,” Lexa greeted. “Good holiday?”                </p><p>“Yes, Commander. Yourself?” Finn answered and asked.</p><p>“Absolutely,” Lexa said, sliding into the far end of the carriage. She sat stiffly on the seat and neither student noticed the clenching of her fists. Soon the rest of the prefects filed in. Lexa could recognize most but knew the names of only the ones in her house or if they played Quidditch. Three Gryffindor prefects walked in, and Lexa knew two: fifth-year chaser, Harper Brooks and sixth-year keeper, Nathan Miller. She did not know the third prefect, other than she was a sixth-year. The second to last prefect to arrive was fifth-year Slytherin seeker, Clarke Griffin. Clarke was an exceptional student and an even more astounding seeker. While Lexa was no doubt the greatest seeker at Hogwarts, Clarke was a close second and games between the two were always intense.</p><p>Clarke greeted everyone before taking a seat. Lexa admired the blonde from afar. Lexa admired the blonde for her excellence in both sports and academics, but Clarke’s compassion and thoughtfulness made her stand out amongst the rest in Lexa’s mind. Not that she had a crush on the blonde. Lexa could never have a crush on Clarke Griffin. Only one person in the world thought Lexa fancied the blonde seeker and that person was wrong. Clarke met Lexa’s eyes and gave a small smile, and Lexa smiled in return, though turning a slight red at being caught.</p><p>“Sorry I’m late,” everyone turned to see Head Girl and Ravenclaw Quidditch captain and keeper, Anya Woods, enter the carriage. Anya saw Lexa smile at Clarke and her tinted cheeks. <em>Oh yeah. Lexa is crushing hard on Griffin.</em> Anya smirked in Lexa’s direction, knowing she had been caught. Lexa turned a darker red before schooling her features into their standard neutrality.</p><p>Despite the shared last name, Anya and Lexa were not related. Nevertheless, Anya was Lexa’s only friend. “Commander,” Anya nodded to Lexa, “Prefects,” she nodded to everyone else. “Let’s get started,” Anya said as she took her seat next to Tristan. “My name is Anya Woods, and I’m Head Girl as well as one of the seventh-year prefects for Ravenclaw.”</p><p>“My name is Tristan Taylor, and I am Head Boy as well as one of the seventh-year prefects for Hufflepuff.”</p><p>“Tristan <em>Taylor</em>?” laughed the fifth-year prefect from Ravenclaw. “Did your parents even think when they were naming you?” Lexa realized this was going to be a long train ride. Though most of the fifth-years were unaware of Tristan’s hatred towards anyone who made fun of his name, Lexa was lucky to have learned early on that there is no making fun of Tristan’s name. Tristan was bright, though, and he decided to wait to punish the unsuspecting fifth-year. Anya smiled slightly despite the prefect being from her own house, he would have to learn not to mess with Tristan.</p><p>“Moving on,” Anya said, “during this train ride we’ll discuss your duties for this year, answer any questions you may have, and set up a patrol schedule.”</p><p>Anya and Tristan pounded into their brains everything they needed to know to be prefects. Though it was not particularly difficult information, rather a lot of information. Near the end of the train ride, everyone felt confident for the upcoming year.</p><p>“Alright, fifth-year prefects get into your robes and patrol the train. Make sure everyone is getting into his or her robes. Sixth-years, you’ll be leading the new first-years to their common rooms after dinner.“ Anya looked around. “Any questions?” People gave various versions, both verbal and non-verbal, of ‘no’. “Very well then. Everyone dismissed.”</p><p>The prefects moved to leave. “Commander, a minute?” Anya asked. Lexa nodded and remained in the prefect carriage though decided to remain standing rather than sit again. One they were alone, and the blinds were drawn, and the room soundproofed and locked, Anya raised an eyebrow at Lexa. Lexa remained silent, unmoving.</p><p>“You were fidgeting, Lexa,” Anya said, and Lexa’s jaw clenched slightly. “Must I remind you?”</p><p>“No, Anya. I’m well aware of the stipulations, I am fine.”</p><p>“No, you’re not. But this time, I’m letting the lie slide because you don’t have to say you’re in pain, I’ll see it for myself.” Anya responded coldly. The two girls were in the midst of a stare down with neither willing to back off. Eventually, Anya won because Anya was right; Lexa owed it to Anya.</p><p>Four years previously Anya discovered Lexa’s secret on the first night at Hogwarts. Lexa had been in an abandoned part of the building crying. Anya, then only a third year, wandered up to the crying girl and attempted to comfort her. What it brought was a hiss of pain from the eleven-year-old. Anya took the girl’s hand and led her to the prefect’s bathroom.</p><p>“A friend of mine gave me the password. We’ll be safe in here.” Anya led her in and shut the door, preventing anyone else from coming in. “It’s just us now. Please, let me help you.” Lexa nodded her consent. Anya decided to start a bath for Lexa. Once the tub was filled, Lexa proceeded to get undressed. Remaining in her undergarments, Anya took one look at the abused and battered body of the eleven-year-old and swore she’d protect the girl.</p><p>However, Lexa proved to be quite stubborn, and finally, a deal was made. Anya would swear to never tell a single soul of what happened to Lexa, provided that Lexa never hid the abuse from Anya. Anya mentored Lexa into the intelligent and determined person she was today. Training her in every way possible so that when Lexa became a captain two years later, she would be able to lead her team to victory. Lexa owed Anya a lot, and so Anya held special privileges over the Commander. But even she did not know Lexa’s full story.</p><p>Lexa took off her blue button up and the black tee-shirt underneath, leaving her in just her bra on top. Her stomach and arms were covered in various stages of bruises. Anya schooled her features at the black and blue body in front of her. Only when she was alone would she allow herself to feel her emotions.</p><p>“Turn around, Lexa,” Anya ordered quietly, and Lexa swallowed. “Now, Commander,” Anya’s voice was deadly and Lexa nodded. Lexa was not afraid of Anya; she just could not handle the pity even though she never once received it from Anya since that day in the bathroom.</p><p>Lexa turned around and winced slightly at the gasp that left Anya. Anya cautiously placed her hand on Lexa’s back. Lexa’s back was similar in that it too was caked in bruises. But the scars marring Lexa’s back drew Anya’s attention. She’d seen the scars before, but her back was still raw. “What did she do to you?” Anya whispered, not knowing if she even wanted to know the answer.</p><p>Never once had Lexa ever detailed the abuse she suffered and Anya had only ever witnessed its remnants. Nevertheless, Anya could easily guess that Lexa was beaten and whipped recently, probably with some sort of belt or strap. Anya knew Lexa would not answer her potentially rhetorical question. Instead, she shuffled through her bag and gave Lexa the pain medication that Lexa never used but accepted regardless. Lexa proceeded to get dressed, buttoning up her white dress shirt and then removing her pants. Anya saw further abuse that ran up and down her legs. Scars and bruises coated the back of Lexa’s legs, and Anya willed herself to remain stoic. She knew Lexa’s hatred of pity and Anya would never force her to endure it.    </p><p>Once Lexa was dressed in her pants, socks, shoes, and dress shirt, she turned to face her mentor. “Don’t say it, Anya. I can’t have this debate again.”</p><p>Anya looked at Lexa carefully, eyeing how worn out the young fifth year looked. “Very well, Commander,” Anya said though reluctantly.</p><p>The long journey from both Nia’s house, as well as the train ride, must have been excruciating for Lexa and so Anya decided not to push her friend. Lexa continued to get dressed by tying her black and yellow tie with ease before placing the gray V-neck sweater over her head with the black and yellow trim guarding the neckline. Lastly, she put on the black robe with a yellow interior hood. Lexa gave a small smile that was reserved for Anya.</p><p>“You look nice, Lexa,” Anya complimented with a smile but her eyes were still sad.</p><p>“Thank you, Anya. Now if you’ll excuse me,” Lexa moved to leave but found herself blocked by the Ravenclaw girl. Anya did not even know why she moved in front of Lexa.</p><p>“Move, Anya,” Lexa ordered forcefully, slightly using her ‘Commander’s Voice.’ Anya was rarely on the other side of the voice, and she understood why people respected Lexa. Anya moved off to the side, allowing Lexa to pass.</p><p>“I beg your forgiveness, Commander,” Anya apologized sincerely. Lexa accepted with a small nod before leaving the carriage. Once the door re-shut, Anya sat down and put her head in her hands, silent tears streaming down her face. She tortured herself on if remaining silent was still the best course of action.</p><p>Lexa patrolled the halls and came upon a carriage filled with a mixture of years. They were Clarke’s friends, and they did not accept the Commander’s prestige in the school. Lexa took a deep breath before knocking and opening the door. The laughter stopped instantly and all eyes were turned towards the young prefect.</p><p>“How did someone as mean as you even get into Hufflepuff?” Fifth-year Ravenclaw Raven Reyes asked. “I thought you were all supposed to be kind and stuff. Right, Octavia?” It was a low blow dragging Octavia into the mess. Octavia was only a fourth year but the best chaser the school had ever seen. Making the team in only her second year, Hufflepuff benefitted greatly from her young and fresh talent.</p><p>Ignoring Raven’s taunt Octavia respectfully greeted Lexa with a quiet ‘Commander’. Lexa refused to put Octavia in an uncomfortable position to choose between her Commander and her friends. She understood why Octavia made no move to defend her, and Lexa did not desire it either. Octavia treated Lexa with respect and that was enough for the Hufflepuff Quidditch captain.</p><p>“Octavia,” Lexa nodded at her chaser. “We’ll be arriving soon. You should get into your robes,” Lexa advised.</p><p>“Yeah, we’ll get right on that, <em>Commander</em>,” Sixth-year and Gryffindor Beater and Captain Bellamy Blake sneered, Lexa’s title being used as an insult. Lexa refused the bait and instead left the carriage, continuing her duties.</p><p>As she was leaving, she ran into Clarke. Quite literally, actually, and it was only because of Clarke’s seeker reflexes that caused them to remain upright.</p><p>“You alright?” Clarke asked with a slight laugh.</p><p>“I’m sorry, Clarke. I did not see you there.”</p><p>“Obviously,” Clarke said with a playful eye roll. Clarke looked towards the carriage Lexa had just exited. “Did they give you a hard time?”</p><p>“It was nothing, Clarke. I promise,” Lexa gave not a smile but some sort of facial expression that warmed her features, and Clarke nodded in acceptance of her tale.</p><p>“Let me know if they do or say anything, Lexa,” Clarke requested.</p><p>“Don’t worry about it, Griffin. Maybe you should worry more about the fact that Hufflepuff is going to kick Slytherin’s ass for the third time in a row.</p><p>“Keep dreaming, Woods,” Clarke responded playfully before continuing in the opposite direction on her own patrol.</p><p> </p><p>Dinner was simple. Lexa sat surrounded by her teammates while Clarke sat around her limited friends in Slytherin. Sure she had her teammates, but they weren’t that close to each other. Most of Clarke’s friends seemed to be in Gryffindor with only a couple in Ravenclaw and even less in Hufflepuff. Lexa wished she could have eaten and left, but she was forced to remain and assist in any prefect duties that may arise. Mercifully, dinner ended, and Lexa made her way back to the common room, grateful she did not have to escort the first years.</p><p>She grabbed her things and made her way to the prefect’s bathroom before locking herself in and starting the bath. She slowly slid her body into the hot water and winced at how the water seemed to aggravate every cut on her body. She was able to relax and allow the hot water rinse off the memories of the summer. When Lexa finished, she made her way back to the Hufflepuff Common Room. She delayed returning so she would not disturb the bonding going on with the other fifth year girls.</p><p>As the Commander, she was unable to participate in her self-forced exile. <em>Head over heart</em>, she told herself. She did not return until a little after midnight when it was safe to retire to at least the Common Room. She remained there for a little more than an hour before allowing herself to head up to bed. When arriving, she saw that the others were almost ready for bed. She gave them a polite nod before drifting off into a dreamless slumber.</p><p> </p><p>Clarke, meanwhile, made her way to the Slytherin common room before she started her patrol. Patrol lasted longer as quite a few first years attempted to sneak around the castle to explore but then ended up getting lost. Not wanting anyone to get in trouble on their first night, she led them back to Ravenclaw common room with a stern warning about being out of the Common Room this late at night. Satisfied that her threats paid off, she realized her shift was over and headed back to her own dorm, falling asleep the second her head hit the pillow.</p><p> </p>
