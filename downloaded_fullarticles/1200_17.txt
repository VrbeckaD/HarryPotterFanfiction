    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p>A red headed baby screams in a hospital bassinet, fists clenched against the weak January sunlight. Around her ankle, like a noose, are words that haven’t yet been said, won’t be for another eleven years, written in the loose, looping hand of a boy who hasn’t yet been born.</p><p>
  <i>“What are you doing defending someone like him?”</i>
</p><p>Lily Evans cries despite the words, or perhaps because of them, as if she already knows what fate has planned for her.</p>
<hr/><p>James Potter’s words are scrawled above his heart, still raw and bloody hours after his birth, and his parents can hardly bear to look at them. Their long awaited miracle of a son, their gift from gods they weren’t sure existed anymore, and his words are terrible. </p><p>Perhaps they weren’t meant to be parents. Perhaps they weren’t meant to have a child of their own. Perhaps this child deserved better than them.</p><p>He squirms within the blanket, hazel eyes open wide, little coos leaving his lips.</p><p>
  <i>“I hope you’re not as stupid as you are rude.”</i>
</p><p>James Potter is a quiet baby, though he will soon grow into a bullhorn of a boy. </p><p>For now, he is content to wait on the world, watching the blurs of color and light pass him by. </p><p>For now, he is content to listen.</p>
<hr/><p>“Defending someone like him.” Petunia said while painting Lily’s toenails a bright purple. “That’s only half of it, what’s the other half?”</p><p>“Oh.” Lily covered her words with a hand, thoroughly embarrassed. “It’s none of your business. I think I’m done. I think I’ll go find some socks.”</p><p>“You can’t put socks on now, you’ll ruin my work.” Petunia frowned. “It can’t be so bad.” She sounded friendly, conspiratorial, and Lily sighed, pulling her hand away. “‘What are you doing defending someone like him?’ Oh, he sounds downright horrible.” She grimaced. “At least mine’s a proper gentleman. ‘A rose for my rose’.” She sighed, a dreamy look on her face. “Better than yours at any rate.”</p><p>“He isn’t terrible.” Lily groused, pulling her knees up to her chest. “I’m sure it’s just a misunderstanding. My soulmate would never-- he’d never be upset with me like that, that’s not how it works!”</p><p>“He’d have plenty of reasons to be mad at you if he wanted.” Petunia hissed. All she wanted was for Lily to admit her soulmate was best, that unquestionably, Petunia had “won”, whatever that meant. But Lily wasn’t one to give in to her sister’s whims, for better or for worse. “Between your freaky little accidents and that big mouth of yours.”</p><p>“You hate roses. You hate flowers! We both do!” Lily countered. Once, she'd felt like her sister was as similar as her reflection. That was far from true now. “You’re just saying it’s romantic because you want it to be, not because it is!”</p><p>“At least I don’t have to think too hard to make my words romantic.” Petunia smirked. “How do you suppose you’ll make yours anything but despicable?”</p><p>Something twisted in the pit of Lily’s stomach.</p><p>She didn’t know.</p>
<hr/><p>James lifts the edge of the gauze to see a string of cramped cursive letters carved into his chest and yelps in surprise before glancing yet again at the door. He’s never known life without the mystery of his words. His mother has told him not to look, and James, for all his antics and troublemaking, is generally an obedient child. But sometimes, his curiosity outweighs all else, and he finds himself in timeout, but he thinks his parents won’t begrudge him this.</p><p>Frank Longbottom from down the street’s words read “Franklin? That’s an old man’s name”, wrapped around his wrist like a bracelet. He’s already met her, actually -- Alice, whose uncle owns the ice cream shop in Diagon Alley. Their parents are making an awful fuss about it, and Frank’s far too embarrassed to say anything to Alice himself, so instead he talks to the James, the probably-cousin-by-marriage-somehow who haunts his footsteps, hoping to claim some teenage wisdom for his own.</p><p>Neil’s soulmate words, marching along his collarbone in a neat, happy line, say “You’re not half as bad as I thought you would be”. James asks if he’s heard them, and Neil laughs, tugging his Ravenclaw tie looser, a hint of a blush visible. </p><p>“Yeah”, he says, and James’ heart screams with joy for his cousin. “Yeah, I’ve heard them.”</p><p>Maybe his words will be so kind. Maybe his soulmate will see him and love him immediately, like Neil’s must. Maybe he will be so lucky as to be treasured. He already sees the way his classmates look at him, like he is something wild and dangerous, something, not someone. He already knows he must fold himself inward, that he must avoid taking up too much space. He is already branded a threat, a weapon, a liar, and he is only eight and a half years old. The half is important, but only just.</p><p>He reads them out in a thready, halting voice, and his heart sinks further with each one.</p><p>“I hope you’re not as stupid as you are rude.”</p><p>He understands why his parents didn’t want him to see them. He tapes the gauze back down, feeling sick to his stomach. Of course it would be him, of all the people he knows, to be fated to misery. Maybe it’s his lot, for being so much trouble. Maybe life has put him in the worst timeout of all.</p>
<hr/><p>In a corner of the local park, a sallow faced boy throws branches at bushes like they’re javelins and Lily thinks she has found her first real friend. He is dirty and mean and he’s got a bruise on the side of his head that Lily can already tell isn’t from falling down, but when she asks if she can throw a stick, he smiles and says “you look like you’ve got a good arm, give it a try”. </p><p>They aren’t her words.</p><p>It’s been on her mind lately, mostly because the opening line of Maisie’s welcome speech for the new boy was found on his wrist. (She thinks his name is Christopher but she’s honestly forgotten, in all the fuss about seeing him and Maisie as a unit, as two halves of a whole.) Severus, who has now changed pace to digging holes, goes to the same primary school as her, so maybe he was there when it happened, maybe he too got caught up in the magic of it. She asks and he shrugs, tells her his parents are soulmates and are plenty unhappy for their troubles, so he isn’t putting too much stock in his own, whoever she might be. </p><p>“Things don’t always work out.” He says sourly. “People don’t always work out. You can’t depend on them. You can only depend on yourself.”</p><p>He makes a leaf go from brown to vibrant green in a flash just minutes later and Lily’s eyes go wide. She hasn’t told anyone about fixing Petunia’s flowers. For a second, she wishes that her soulmate is, at the very least, someone like her. Someone who knows this mystery and loves it dearly.</p>
<hr/><p>One of James’ top four favorite places in the world was his aunt and uncle’s house, even when his cousin Neil wasn’t in it. If his Aunt Dorea wasn’t there, it immediately became his least favorite place in the world, but today he was lucky. She was bustling around the kitchen to find the package of biscuits she’d bought especially for him in the morning while he pretended not to sneak sips of her coffee. Very few adults, save for James’ own parents, had earned his respect as easily as she had. Even when he was a baby, any instructions she gave were carried out as expediently as James could manage, and she had taken full advantage.</p><p>“You’ve come straight from school.” She said, once she’d set the package down in front of him, and James paused in destroying the packaging to look up at her with the most innocent eyes he could manage. “Do your parents know you’re here?”</p><p>“I told Waffle to bring them a note when I got here.” James grinned. His uncle had despised the fact that Neil had named their owl Waffle. Served him right for coming home late from work. “So Amma knows, at least.”</p><p>“That’s good. So I’m guessing you’ve got something on your mind, then.”</p><p>Aunt Dorea’s graying hair frizzed about her head, flyaway strands escaping the bun tied at the back of her head, as she folded her hands in front of herself, trying not to point out the fact that her cup of coffee was now half gone already. James loved her more than anyone else in the universe for it. His uncle would’ve made a fuss about it from the second he spotted the cup.</p><p>“I saw my words.” James said quietly. “Lifted the bandage and read ‘em in the mirror.”</p><p>“I see.” Aunt Dorea sighed, brows knitting together just like Neil’s did when he was upset. He knew she knew what they said -- otherwise she would’ve asked. His parents were both as close to her as he was, closer than any of them were to his uncle. “And what did you think?”</p><p>“Maybe she’s joking.” James said, feeling the beginnings of tears brimming in his eyes. “Like maybe she’s just making fun.” He ran a hand through his hair, feeling rather silly for getting upset over someone he’d never met. “If she loved me, she wouldn’t call me stupid or rude. She’d say it nicer. Like that I’m a distraction in the classroom or something.” </p><p>“Is someone saying that about you?” Aunt Dorea asked, looking rather shocked. “James, that’s not right, sweetheart. If someone’s being rude to you, you need to speak up. Or tell your parents. Or I’ll go talk to them, they won’t be saying anything when I’m finished with them.”</p><p>James shoved a full biscuit into his mouth to avoid answering.</p><p>“Your words, though…” She tapped her fingers against the tabletop. “You know soulmates aren’t everything, right?” She reached over to brush his hair out of his eyes. “Your uncle and I aren’t soulmates and we’re happy together. We have our troubles, but everyone does.”</p><p>“Why? He’s mean.” James blurted out, before kicking the leg of the table in frustration. “Sorry. Amma says I have no filter.”</p><p>“He’s not mean, he’s just particular about how he likes things.” Aunt Dorea said with a warm smile. “He doesn’t understand that not everyone needs or wants to keep his standards. And that helps our relationship, because everything about a person does, in some way.” She tweaked James’ nose. “Someday, someone will find every reason to love you and appreciate you, and maybe they won’t be your soulmate, but that’s fine. Look for the person first, not the words.”</p><p>James nodded with a smile. Maybe the words wouldn’t matter so much at all. They still caused his chest to ache whenever he thought about them, but maybe it wasn’t the end of the world, to be disliked by the one you were fated to love.</p>
<hr/><p>“What are your words?” Severus Snape kicks his legs out hard, the swing he sits on jerking beneath him. His beady eyes glimmer with unabashed curiosity. </p><p>It’s not the first time he’s asked. It’s not the first time she won’t answer with the honesty he craves.</p><p>He guards his words with his life, and Lily lets him, because Severus is allowed precious few secrets to begin with, but he never seems to offer her the same courtesy. It’s almost as if he’s decided he’s suffering enough that her life is open for criticism, every detail she refuses to share immediately a sitting duck, waiting for the gunshot of his commentary. </p><p>This time, she’s frustrated. This time, she’s upset. So she says something she’ll regret and steels herself for the consequences.</p><p>“You didn’t say them.”</p><p>Severus’ brow creases. “Well, I could just say them now, and--”</p><p>“It had to be the first thing you said to me. Directly to me.” Lily says, and her heart aches in her chest, because someday her soulmate will look her in the eye and ask her why she’s wasting her time on someone who doesn’t deserve it.</p><p>And the thing that makes her sick to her stomach is that she already thinks she knows who her soulmate is talking about.</p><p>Severus glowers into the distance and Lily promises herself that next time she won’t rise to his bait. Next time, she won’t tell him things he doesn’t want to hear. </p><p>Next time, she’ll keep her mouth shut.</p>
