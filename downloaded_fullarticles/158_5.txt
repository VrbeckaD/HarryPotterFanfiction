    <p>Harry's POV</p><p>It had been a year since I defeated Voldemort and I was finally going back to Hogwarts. It wasn't that it had taken a year to rebuild, no, it had taken a year for everyone to recover. Some of us still hadn't. Some of us never would. But I still wanted to go back, no matter how much it hurt to see the places people I loved died. They'd want me to come back and be happy. So I am. </p><p>I stood before the bright red metallic paint of the Hogwarts express with Ron and Hermione at my side as usual. Despite all that has happened there's something amazing about the journey. It bring back long forgotten memories and waves of nostalgia. We boarded the train and weren't surprised to see that nothing had changed. Everything looked like it was in the exact same place, not even a single piece of dust had moved. Hermione, Ron and I all clambered into a cabin, Neville, Ginny and Luna soon joining us. We all had to squish together and press against the cold glass of the windows just to fit but it didn't matter because we were going back. The engine started; the urban greys and browns blending steadily into the dark &amp; light greens of the country. <br/>"Anything from the trolley dears?" That was enough to make us all grin and offer up our money for the sweet treats. </p><p>The journey passed quickly, filled with chocolate, laughs and Bertie Bots Every Flavour Beans. It was a push to get off the train with everyone leaving me squished awkwardly against Ron.<br/>"Ok I've not missed this," He said trying to push past the scared first years.<br/>"Are you kidding? This is great!" As I tried getting past, they looked up at my face and instantly let me through in awe. This earned me a stern glare from Ron and a laugh from me. As we all got off I could see the castle between the emerald fur trees, it's turrets still the same lovable grey. Me and Hermione shared a secret smile as we started the walk with all the gang back together.<br/>"Potter!" The voice I'd grown to hate came from behind me, making me huff out in annoyance.<br/>Oh, and he's back too.</p>
