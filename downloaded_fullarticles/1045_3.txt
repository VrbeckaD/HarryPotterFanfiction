    <h3>March 24rd 2005: Front page of the <em>Daily Prophet</em> newspaper</h3><p><strong>Potter Disappearance Mystifies Aurors!</strong><br/>
A <em>Prophet Exclusive</em> from the Quill of Millicent Bulstrode.  </p><p><em>“I’m afraid I don’t have any new answers for you!”</em><br/>
These were the words of esteemed Head Auror Gawain Robards during a press-conference yesterday. It has now been two weeks since Deputy-Minister Hermione Granger admitted that the star of magical Britain had vanished in mysterious circumstances whilst working undercover. </p><p>Despite almost continuous pressure from The Prophet credible facts about Potter’s disappearance remain remain few and far between. The whole matter seems shrouded in mystery. </p><p><em>“Just where is our hero?” </em><br/>
Indeed, it is hardly an exaggeration to say that shock and horror continue to ripple throughout the Wizarding world. </p><p>The disappearance of Deputy Lead Auror Harry Potter, War hero and Chosen One seems to have our Auror Department entirely perplexed. We here at the Prophet are entirely disgusted at their seeming lack of leads! </p><p>The public demands to know what steps have been taken to return out Saviour to us!</p>
