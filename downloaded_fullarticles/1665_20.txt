    <p align="justify">Privet Drive is as normal as they come; a straight street of identical houses with the same square garden in front and a driveway. It was a quiet street in a well-to-do area of Surrey so no one would suspect the disturbance that would happen that very same night.</p><p align="justify">A tabby cat had been watching a particular house all day, observing the coming and goings of the family inside. They consisted of a large man, who had left early in the morning for work and hadn't returned until the evening. A woman, tall and thin, who stayed at home; a mere simple housewife, and a squalling baby, larger than the average, who threw tantrums like nobody's business. No, the tabby was not impressed with this family at all. It sat vigil on their wall, ears twitching in annoyance every time the baby let loose a cry, which was more often than not.</p><p align="justify">And when darkness fell, it continued still, though now listening for sounds out of the ordinary. At the stroke of midnight it languidly stood, stretching, before jumping from the wall and morphing into a strange woman with a very severe look. She wore a sort of long cloak, velvet green, with a pointed hat to match, and small square glasses akin to the markings of the tabby cat's eyes. Her keen ears had picked up a disturbance in the natural sounds of night, and she turned just in time to watch an old man with a long white beard in similar attire slowly make his way towards her. With every passing of a street light, darkness followed; some sort of device he was using allowed him to put out the lights at every interval. Not a word was said until he had reached her.</p><p align="justify">"Professor McGonagall," he said kindly, bowing his head in acknowledgement.</p><p align="justify">"Professor Dumbledore," she replied in kind.</p><p align="justify">Nothing more was said between them as they both turned to watch the night sky. A few minutes more, and the quiet was broken by the sound of a low rumbling. Soon, the two strange figures were able to make out a point of light in the sky growing bigger and bigger until a black motorbike landed, carrying the largest man anyone would come to know. They waited until he clambered off the sleek bike, delicately holding onto a swathe of fabric. Only then did the woman deem it necessary to speak.</p><p align="justify">"Surely you don't mean for him to grow up here? They are the worst sort of Muggles possible! I have been watching them all day."</p><p align="justify">The old man, who usually carried a twinkle in his blue eyes, suddenly looked as if he had aged a decade. "I am afraid he must go to his last living relatives."</p><p align="justify">"So it's true? What they're saying about the Longbottoms and the Potters, and You-Know-Who? Is he really dead?"</p><p align="justify">"Come now, Minerva. You know my opinion on that name."</p><p align="justify">"Very well. V-Voldemort. Is it all true?"</p><p align="justify">The old man regarded the woman clad in green, taking in her devastated yet hopeful expression and the way she had stumbled over a man's name in fear when nothing else had ever shaken her.</p><p align="justify">"I'm afraid tonight is a tragic night indeed."</p><p align="justify">A hand flew to cover her mouth in shock, tears almost filling his eyes to the brim. She furiously blinked them back as the giant of a man approached them with the bundle of blankets, cradling them close to his chest. That was all the confirmation she needed.</p><p align="justify">"Any trouble, Hagrid?"</p><p align="justify">"No, Professor Dumbledore sir. Not a peep out of him all night."</p><p align="justify">"And the bike?"</p><p align="justify">"Got it from young Sirius Black. Tol' me to keep 'im safe and took off into the night."</p><p align="justify">The large man, Hagrid, carefully handed the bundle to Dumbledore, who peered into its depths. A baby slept peacefully in its folds, a chubby little fist clenching onto the fabric. A wisp of dark hair could just be made out in the shadow of the blankets, but the feature that drew Dumbledore's attention was the lightning bolt shaped scar on his forehead; an inflamed red, it had just been newly made. A shadow flitted over Dumbledore's eyes and was gone before McGonagall or Hagrid would notice. Bowing his head over the baby, he walked up the footpath to Number Four of Privet Drive and cautiously laid him down on the doorstep. With him, Dumbledore tucked in a letter in a heavy envelope, addressed to one Petunia Dursley in green cursive.</p><p align="justify">"Are you sure this is the right course of action, Albus?" McGonagall tried again after he had made his way back to them. "What of the Longbottoms?"</p><p align="justify">"The Longbottoms have also been taken care of. Tonight we grieve, but we should also join in on the celebrations, for it is also a night for rejoicing. After all, Voldemort has been defeated by none other than a babe."</p><p align="justify">"And that babe will grow up famous in our world. Both of them will grow up famous in our world. They are already calling Neville the Boy-Who-Lived."</p><p align="justify">"All the more reason for this path."</p><p align="justify">Dumbledore turned to Hagrid, who had broken out into sobs, and patted his arm comfortingly.</p><p align="justify">"There, there, Hagrid. This is not the end."</p><p align="justify">All three turned back to look at the sleeping baby on the doorstep one last time, Hagrid still leaking tears into his wild mane of a beard, before they took off into the dark.</p>
