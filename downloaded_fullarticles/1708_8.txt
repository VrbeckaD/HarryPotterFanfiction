    <p>After five years, they stopped having annual memorial services on the 2nd of May, though last year on the 10th anniversary they had met again, and simply celebrated it as a holiday with the Ministry running on a skeleton crew and Hogwarts classes cancelled. </p><p>This year, with May 2nd falling on a weekend, the Ministry had shut down on Friday to allow as many as possible to spend a long weekend at home, and today there were less than a hundred people total expect to show up in the underground Government Headquarters of Wizarding Britain and even fewer present before the sun came up, one of which was Kingsley Shacklebolt.</p><p>At noon he would be making a public address on the wireless from his office, reminding the country what they had fought for and won.</p><p>After checking in the Auror Office to make sure nothing dangerous was expected (they had twice had terror attacks from leftover Death Eater or Snatcher remnants on this date) the tall dark-skinned man made his way up to his office, working on paperwork from the past week that he had not gotten around to, approving budgets and minor official appointments and hiring plans for the newest wave of Hogwarts graduates. </p><p>The charmed window behind his desk showed the sun peaking around the mountains of Scotland when there was an urgent alert on his wall from the Department of Mysteries, one of the few departments that did not really follow normal working hours or holidays. Though he was not an expert on the more arcane theories of magic they tested and pushed the limits of down there, the current Minister of Magic knew that anything they considered to be an actual problem, instead of merely a curious result, was both important and urgent.</p><p>Finishing a form for Mrs Granger-Weasley, he left his office and took a lift down, running into a flying memo for himself on the way which he read on the way down.</p><p>
  <b>Minister: We have had a situation in the Death Chamber. We recommend you handle this personally due to the unusual and sensitive nature of the situation. Please come at once to my office.</b>
</p><p>
  <b>- Unspeakable Patil</b>
</p><p>Striding quickly down the dark hallway, faster than he had on this particular level of the Ministry than he had in almost 13 years, he reached the rotating room and clearly spoke his destination. Striding through the door in front of him, he reached the administrative offices and hurried the sounds of a yelling, an oddly familiar voice saying something about 'innocent' and 'Dumbledore' even before he opened the door, where three Unspeakables were holding a disturbingly familiar but utterly impossible wizard at wand-point.</p><p>"What in Merlin's Beard is happening here?!" the former Auror shouted over all four of them, even as he added his wand, closing the distance to the well dressed wizard and asking "Who the bloody hell are you?", anger lacing his words even as he was silently thankful Harry was at home under threat of his wife's infamous Bat Bogey Hex.</p><p>The grey eyed wizard looked at him and held up his hands, but did not drop his wand, "Kingsley, it's me... Sirius... what is going on? They said they were fetching in Minister... how long till Fudge gets here? Where is... is everyone safe?", his eyes wide and expression rather manic, though understandably so given the situation if he really was the man he appeared to be, who had been dead for nearly one and half decades. </p><p>Swallowing once, the Minister told the three Unspeakables to back away, edging closer and after calming down a bit explaining in his normal patient but commanding tone despite the absurd situation "It's been... a long time. Fudge is not the Minister anymore. And honestly, I don't believe you, so tell me something to change my mind", keeping his wand trained on the supposed Sirius Black, ready to disarm and stun him if needed and wondering why the hell nobody had done so yet. </p><p>The supposedly reborn Black nodded quickly, almost desperate as he started talking "Of course. We are part of... a group... together. We... when we meet the place is full of gingers, especially during school holidays. There's an umbrella stand at the door that the person who reintroduced us trips over, but the first time we met was on the Quidditch pitch", his eyes not leaving Shacklebolt's, pleading his case silently as he listed off as many facts as possible without compromising the security of the Order of the Phoenix. </p><p>"Bloody hell, it is you... how?" Kingsley finally responded, glancing back at Patil and her team. </p><p>"We were studying the Veil. It's most active today... for obvious reasons... and then right at 5:30 AM he just... walked out" she explained nervously, adding "About gave us all heart attacks, nearly made it out of the Department before we cornered him in here" </p><p>Nodding slowly, he made a quick decision "I will handle this personally, continue with your experiments and get me a report by noon Monday" he told the Unspeakables, before nodding at Sirius to come with him. "How are you feeling my old friend?" he asked as they made their way down the hall together. Unsurprisingly, Sirius responded with questions of his own "Is Harry alright, where is everyone? And what did you mean about Fudge not being Minister?"</p><p>As they got in a lift and traveled back up to his office to use the private Floo, Kingsley assured Sirius that "Harry is perfectly alright, at least as of noon yesterday when I last saw him... " but nearly had to clamp his hand over the younger man's mouth "But no, we cannot go see him right now. Listen to me... it's been over ten years since you went through the veil. Since you died" </p><p>That finally shut the old Marauder up, his eyes wide at the statement as he followed along and took a seat the private office, where Kingsley quickly explained a very condensed version of what had been missed... two more years of war, Harry winning, cleaning up the Ministry... finishing by saying "He's doing great now my old friend, you'd be impressed. But you can't go there just yet... he's an Auror and thinks you are dead.  You'd be cursed halfway across the Channel before we had a chance to explain anything", which Sirius could only nod in agreement. "And further, you need to go to St. Mungo's, get checked out. That will give me time to write to Harry and explain, and then we can meet up with him" </p><p>Giving a growl that would have worked in his Animagus form, the last remaining Black by both name and birth nodded "Yeah... yeah alright... I assume the fireplace isn't just for show?"</p><p>Kinglsey nodded, writing up a quick note and telling Sirius the procedure for Auror and other Ministry-related emergencies before sending him through the flames of the Floor Network, and taking a seat at his desk wondering how in Merlin's name he'd be able to explain this to his Head Auror, a man who in his own way was every bit as paranoid as Alastor ever was.</p><p>Rubbing his forehead, he looked up at a sudden and urgent knocking on his door, saying "Come in" and meeting the gaze of Terry Boot, one of three recently promoted Senior Aurors under Harry and in charge over the weekend due to not having any children. Closing the door behind him, he stepped closer to the desk but did not take a seat as the Minister leaned back in his soft leather chair. </p><p>"Yes, what is it?" he asked the younger man, who nervously replied "Honestly sir, I'm not sure you'll believe this... ", earning a humorless laugh as Kingsley interrupted "The bar for what I won't believe is set pretty damn high at the moment" before gesturing to continue.</p><p>Auror Boot nodded curtly, and said quickly and plainly "We've had four independent reports of some sort of attack on Hogsmead, three of which are in agreement as to who the perpetrator is... Bellatrix Lestrange... "</p>
