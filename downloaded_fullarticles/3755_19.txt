    <p>Hermione walked around the kneeling form in front of her and hummed, pleased at the sight.</p>
<p align="left">Somehow, she had managed to get THE Minerva McGonagall into her bed and from there, onto her knees before Hermione. Not only that, but Hermione could see they shared a certain kink. All she had to do was get Minerva to realize there was nothing wrong with it.</p>
<p>“Say it.” Hermione said from behind her. “You know you want to.” she practically sang. They both knew how badly she wanted to, but they also knew Minerva would never admit it.</p>
<p>Minerva shook her head, “N-No. It’s stupid.”</p>
<p>Hermione moved to stand in front of her and bent over the naked woman. She placed a finger under her chin and lifted Minerva’s eyes towards hers, their lips touching.</p>
<p>“Nothing my little girl wants is ever stupid.”</p>
<p>Minerva’s eyes shut and she shuddered.</p>
<p>“Y-you really shouldn’t say t-that.”</p>
<p>Hermione released her chin and stood, “Why? It’s true.” She ran her fingers through Minerva’s hair and murmured, “You are my little girl aren’t you?”</p>
<p>Minerva moaned, but refused to answer. Hermione’s grip in her hair turned rough and she yanked her head back, “Arent you?” she growled.</p>
<p>Minerva’s breathing sped up and Hermione watched the visible debate going on in the woman’s head. She placed a blindfold over Minerva's eyes, hoping it would make the woman relax and help her feel unihibited. Perhaps if she couldn't see Hermione...</p>
<p>“Just say yes, Minerva. There’s no one here but us. In this room, it’s just me,” she leaned down and whispered, “And my little girl.”</p>
<p>“Yes!” Minerva sobbed.</p>
<p>Hermione kissed her head and her grip relaxed as she scratched her scalp lightly, “Yes what?”</p>
<p>A tear slipped from the blindfold and fell down Minerva’s face as she whispered, “I’m your little girl.”</p>
<p>Hermione kissed the tear away and swept Minerva’s lips into a gentle yet dominating kiss. “I’m so proud of you.” She whispered. “I think my little girl deserves an orgasm. What do you think?”</p>
<p>Minerva moaned, “Please.”</p>
<p>Hermione bit her lip and pondered whether or not to push Minerva farther. On one hand, the woman’s posture was more relaxed after giving in, but on the other, she could see the toll it took on her. She pressed a button on the remote, turning the vibrator on its highest setting.</p>
<p>“Does my little girl want to cum?” she asked.</p>
<p>Minerva’s body jerked and she shouted, “Yes! Please!”</p>
<p>Hermione knew Minerva needed contact before she could cum like this. She particularly liked it when Hermione held her head against her body or when the brunette was behind her. Hermione chuckled, “Can you say, ‘Please let your little girl cum?’”</p>
<p>Minerva whimpered, and Hermione licked her lips at the sheer desperation in the woman’s posture. She was leaning forward, straining towards Hermione. And even though she couldn't see them, Hermione <em>knew </em>she had that pleading look in her eyes, the one that drove Hermione insane and made her give in to anything.</p>
<p>“P-Please...oh god.” She said and Hermione placed a hand in Minerva’s hair, but it wasn’t enough.</p>
<p>“’Please let your little girl cum.’” Hermione repeated and Minerva grit her teeth before visibly surrendering. Her body slumped, though it was still leaning towards Hermione.</p>
<p>Minerva licked her lips and let the words flow. “Please let your little girl cum.” She whispered and Hermione moaned.</p>
<p>“Good girl!” she said and pulled Minerva in close. She tangled her hand in the woman’s hair and allowed Minerva’s cheek to rest against her stomach.</p>
<p>“Mo-Hermione!” Minerva shouted and Hermione smirked.</p>
<p>She almost said it.</p>
<p>And that was enough to make Hermione cum.</p>
<p>Once the women had come down from their orgasm, Hermione untied Minerva and removed the blindfold. Minerva stood on unsteady feet, leaning heavily against her and Hermione guided them to the bed.</p>
<p>They lay together, Minerva with her head on Hermione’s chest and her arm around her waist. Hermione coo’d gently as she stroked Minerva’s hair.</p>
<p>“You’re such a good girl, Minerva. You’re so good for Mommy.”</p>
<p>Minerva released a cry of shame and pleasure, and she hid her face as much as possible. Hermione shushed her and they lay together in silence.</p>
<p>Once Hermione felt Minerva relax, she whispered, “I’m very proud of what you did today. Do you need to discuss it?”</p>
<p>Minerva shook her head and Hermione chuckled, “That’s okay. We don’t have to. But can you answer a couple questions for me?” Minerva nodded hesitantly.</p>
<p>“Did I make you uncomfortable today?”</p>
<p>A few moments of nothing and then a slight shake of the head.</p>
<p>“Good. Do you want what happened today to happen again?”</p>
<p>A longer pause and then a very slight nod.</p>
<p>“Last question. Do you like being my good girl?”</p>
<p>This time, Minerva trembled against her and nodded immediately.</p>
<p>“Good. Now be a good girl and go to sleep, okay?”</p>
<p>Minerva relaxed and nodded. “Goodnight, Hermione.”</p>
<p>Hermione smirked, “Ah she does speak. Goodnight, Minerva.”</p>
