    <p>“Stan the <i>man!</i>”</p>
<p>Stanley Uris startled, lowering his newspaper to look for the source of the voice. The train station was roaring, crowds of people swooping through, trains screaming by, loudspeakers blaring. Deep in the crowd, Stan caught a glimpse of a man with dark, unruly hair and glasses waving frantically. Stanley jumped to his feet.</p>
<p>Richie Tozier dodged through the crowd, his bright orange shirt nearly blinding Stanley.</p>
<p>“What the fuck are you wearing?” Stanley demanded before Richie nearly bowled him over with a hug.</p>
<p>“I haven’t seen you in <i>years</i>, man, and that’s all you have to say to me?” Richie said into Stanley’s shoulder.</p>
<p>Stanley felt his feet lift off the ground. “Rich!”</p>
<p>Richie let go and Stanley hit the ground hard, overbalanced, and fell back onto the bench. “Fuck you.”</p>
<p>“Yeesh, Stan, you look like shit!” Richie said as he adjusted his glasses. He plunked down beside Stanley.</p>
<p>Stanley frowned; he knew he looked grey. Work had taken its toll on him, the long nights and secrets weighing on him, body and soul. Stanley shrugged dismissively and picked up his newspaper from where it had fallen to the ground. <i>Tragedy at Hogwarts</i>, the headline blared. “You know how it is,” he muttered.</p>
<p>“Can’t say I do,” Richie said with a good-natured smile. “Isn’t that the whole point of working in the Department of Mysteries, Mr. Unspeakable?”</p>
<p>Stanley pointed at the newspaper headline. “Are you on this case, too?” he asked. </p>
<p>The line between Richie’s eyebrows deepened. “Yeah.”</p>
<p>The pair sat together on the bench, a bubble of silence surrounded by the chaos of the train station. Stanley was troubled by Richie’s quiet. Thinking back, he couldn’t recall a single moment during all their years together at Hogwarts when Richie wasn’t jabbering away about something inane. Stanley felt a pang of guilt and regret at all the growing up his friends must have done while he was holed up, away from life in the Department of Mysteries.</p>
<p>Stanley couldn’t bear the silence any longer. “Aren’t Bill and Beverly on this case, too?”</p>
<p>“No shit?” Richie smiled. “I knew Bill was, but Beverly?” He shook his head. “I haven’t seen her in a while, either. You two and your ambitions.”</p>
<p>“It’s not like none of us had ambitions,” Stanley murmured. “We all drifted in some way. That’s just adulthood.” He tugged nervously on his earlobe. “I mean, how often do you see any of the others?”</p>
<p>Richie shook his head again. “How’s Patty?” Richie asked instead of answering.</p>
<p>Richie had been the only one of the Losers to attend Stan’s wedding, though not through any fault of theirs. They had all had cases, busy catching dark wizards, Stanley supposed, doing their work as aurors. He was disappointed, sure, but it had been so long since they had all been together that he hadn’t really expected it to happen anyways.</p>
<p>Stanley looked down at his knees. “We’re alright.” Richie still felt like a best friend to Stan, and it was mortifying that he still had the urge to tell him what was really on his mind. Richie must have moved on by now, surely had his own friends to talk to, but here Stanley was, clinging pathetically to his childhood friend and longing to tell him all the ugly parts of his and Patty’s relationship because he knew Richie would understand. But Stanley said nothing.</p>
<p>Richie bounced his knee up and down. “That’s good, I guess.”</p>
<p>Stanley glanced at Richie, watching him stare at the floor, then sighed and glanced down at his watch. “We should get going,” he said.</p>
<p>Richie waited, a single briefcase dangling from his hand, while Stanley gathered his own things. He handed Richie a suitcase (“What am I, your slave?” “Fuck you, Rich.”), hefted his briefcase in one hand, and tugged his last suitcase behind him.</p>
<p>The two of them slipped through the barrier between platforms nine and ten and emerged into the nearly-silent platform nine and three-quarters. The platform, usually bustling with students and their families, had an eerie, abandoned air. If it weren’t for the five figures and their luggage standing next to the tracks, the platform would be empty.</p>
<p>“Eddie fucking Spaghetti?” Richie screeched. “Haystack? Is that you? You look sexier than I remember! What the hell are you guys doing here?”</p>
<p>Richie dashed forward with the two suitcases hiked up to his ribs, a grown man sprinting away like a child. Stanley found himself laughing out loud as he trailed behind him. The last time he had laughed like that, Stanley realized with a shock, was at his wedding with Richie.</p>
<p>“What the fuck are you wearing?” Stanley heard Eddie saying as he reached the group. </p>
<p>“Muggle clothes,” Richie replied, then yanked Eddie into a hug that lifted him off his feet.</p>
<p>Behind the pair stood Bill Denbrough, Ben Hanscom, Mike Hanlon, and Beverly Marsh. Stanley smiled and reached out for a handshake, but before a greeting could leave his lips, Bill had him in a bear hug. Stanley felt the others surrounding them. Mike’s arm around his shoulders, Beverly’s hair against his cheek, and soon they were all in a tight knot of a group hug, just like they had always done when they were kids.</p>
<p>Mike’s muffled voice emerged from within the bundle: “I missed you guys.”</p>
