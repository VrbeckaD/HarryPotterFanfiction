    <p>
There was pain in her head, and screaming, so loud it hurt her ears. Crouched down, Bellatrix struggled to cover her ears against the noise, but it didn’t help. The screaming continued. And she couldn’t breath against the weight.
</p><p>
Sobbing, she struggled to pull in enough air, dimly becoming aware that the screaming had finally stopped. It was worse than the last time her Master had punished her with the Cruciatus curse. Not just every nerve in her body burned but her head felt like it was on fire and there was a big gaping burning hole right behind her eyes where something was missing.
</p><p>
Even she, the most powerful of his lieutenants, couldn’t easily recover from that curse when he used it. The pain could linger for days. But this was worse. Much worse. She pushed against it, pulling herself upright, using the tree she’d fallen against as support.
</p><p>
Through blurry, aching eyes, she stared towards the empty space her Master had entered. He’d gone to deal with the Potter brat by himself, after dismissing the rat, leaving her with strict instructions to find the other brat the prophecy spoke of.
</p><p>She knew he’d punish her for disobeying him, but she would do the job she’d sworn to do as his loyal follower and keep Dumbledore’s pests away. The other brat could wait a few hours.
</p><p>
The light from the moon washed over the space, briefly revealing a small cottage before it disappeared again. She dimly remembered studying the Fidelius years ago and knew that only something more powerful than her Master could cause it to waver like that. Something had happened and she needed to get to her Master’s side to aid him.
</p><p>
Cautiously, she approached where she thought the cottage would be. Where her Master had entered and disappeared. When the cottage briefly flickered into sight again she stepped forward into it. She could feel it fighting against her, pulling at her aching head, but she pushed forward and through the weakened charm.
</p><p>
The door hung open, hanging by a single hinge. Her Master had obviously blasted it open. Stepping into the cottage, Bellatrix looked around, her wand raised. She quickly performed a Locus charm to find any living creature in the place. She wasn’t surprised to find it revealed nothing. Her Master must have already gone back to the mansion after dealing with the blood traitors. The Dark Mark floated high in the air as a sign he’d been there.
</p><p>But she was curious. What had he done to the Potters? Just killing them would be so disappointing. She needed to know that they’d suffered for defying him. Needed to see. She stepped further into the cottage.
</p><p>
Down a short hallway was a stairway leading up. At the base of the stair was a hunched over form.
</p><p>Approaching it, she pushed it over with a kick. Once it came to rest, staring up at her blindly was the pale, empty eyed face of Potter, his wand gripped tightly in his hand. There was no sign of injury but he was clearly dead. Her Master had obviously not considered him worthy of a more painful death. Nodding to herself in mild satisfaction, she stepped over him, with a crunch of glass, and onto the first step.
</p><p>
She took the stairs carefully, scanning for traps as she went. She could faintly feel the dark 'flavor' of her Master’s magic ahead. He’s performed something more intricate than his favorite curse. Whatever he’d done before he’d left was still staining the magic of the floor above.
</p><p>
A long hallway stretched forward from the upper landing. Three of the four doors she could see were closed. A red glow emanated from the fourth opening at the end of the hallway. As she passed each door, she blasted it open, the doors turning to sharp slivers, flying with enough force into the rooms to be lethal to any occupants, if they’d managed to hide themselves from her earlier search. But each room was empty, though obviously in use by someone.
</p><p>
She reached the final door. A crackling red shield blocked her way. She waved her wand, attempting to determine what it was. Unfamiliar runes floated in front of her. The Blacks had been noted Rune Masters in the past, but she’d never bothered learning more  than the basics. She wondered what her Master had done, what message he was leaving for Dumbledore, and those who would defy him.
</p><p>
She tried to look past the shield, getting as close as she could without touching it. Something vaguely cradle-like stood against the far wall. Between it and the door was another huddled form. The brat must be in the cradle, she thought, but what had her Master done?
</p><p>
As she peered into the room, she could hear noises outside. Unless she wanted to duel whatever pathetic thing had come to see what had happened to the Potters, she’d need to quickly finish her investigation and leave.
</p><p>Casting a shielding charm on herself, she stepped through door. As she passed through it, a wave of something painful engulfed her, unfazed by her shield. Her hair stood on end, and her magic screamed, like a living thing.
</p><p>Stumbling forward, she fell to her knees in front of the huddled form. The faint iron smell of blood, almost overpowered by the smell of burnt flesh, flooded her nostrils. The form shivered, like some dying animal. Reaching out, she touched it, pushing the dark red hair away from its face.
</p><p>
"Where is my Master," Bellatrix demanded, looking around the room, obviously the brat’s nursery. He wouldn’t have gone if the Potter bitch was still alive. She looked behind herself at the door. The wall on either side was charred, as if a large flame had been pointed at it. She followed it up to the ceiling. The flame had burned through the ceiling and she could see the moon through the hole.
</p><p>
Bellatrix turned back to the Potter bitch and poked her with her wand. Her cloudy green eyes stared up at Bellatrix. She struggled to speak. Bellatrix leaned forward to catch her words.
</p><p>
"Gone," Potter said, her voice barely audible.
</p><p>"Gone where?" Bellatrix said, raising her wand threateningly.
</p><p>
"Take her. Go!" Potter said, ignoring her question. "Yours now," she gasped. "Protector. Go!"
</p><p>
As she breathed out the words, Bellatrix felt another wave of something go through her, compelling her to obey. She tried to shake it off but something bound her to it. She raised her wand again and attempted to curse Potter.
</p><p>
But the other woman now stared blankly up at her. Gone to wherever dead dirty muggles went. Cursing all muggles, Bellatrix struggled back to her feet. Looking towards the crib in the corner, she detected a faint green glow. Forcing her feet forward, she found herself staring down at a silently crying baby behind a green tinged shield of some sort.
</p><p>It looked like the shield had touched it at some point, leaving a burn mark on the brat’s forehead. Her Master must have tried to kill the brat after dealing with its mother, she thought, though how this shield had protected it was a mystery.
</p><p>
Staring down, she felt herself compelled to reach through the shield and grab the brat. As soon as she touched it, there was an audible pop and the shield disappeared, leaving her with a smelly, loudly crying brat. Reaching down to pick it up, intending to silence it before it drew the attention of whatever was outside, her wand hand brushed against a small amulet pinned to the brat’s clothes.
</p><p>
In the brief second before blackness overcame her, Bellatrix felt the distinctive rush of portkey magic, pulling her away to somewhere outside of her control.
</p>
<hr/><p>
Albus Dumbledore was not an overly paranoid wizard. But he was cautious. When the alarms on the Potter cottage started wailing in his office he silenced them and quickly apparated to the edge of Godric’s Hollow. The Potter cottage, home to generations of Potter squibs, was at the end of a quiet street in the ancient Wizarding community. 
</p><p>Staring up at the giant green Dark Mark floating tauntingly above the cottage, he was horrified to see that the Fidelius he’d applied to it himself was damaged and just barely holding. Quickly applying a diagnostic charm, it was clear someone had been tampering with the Fidelius, though he couldn’t determine what had been done to it. But the tampering had weakened it enough that it wouldn’t last much longer.
</p><p>
Grimacing, he stepped through the shattered door, feeling the faint traces of Riddle’s work. Looking down the hall, he saw the body of James Potter. Stepping up to him, he again waved his wand.
</p><p>"Priori Incantatem," he said. James’ wand briefly glowed revealing he’d barely put up a fight, his last spell being Protego, before Riddle’s Avada Kedavra had killed him. He shook his head sadly. He’d warned all of the Order to not attempt to engage Riddle in a duel. As skilled as some of them were, none could stand against the so called Dark Lord.
</p><p>
Looking up the steps, he sighed, afraid of what he’d see. He slowly went up the stairs, alert for any traps Riddle may have placed there. In the back of his mind he caught the faint whisper of another wizard’s magic, besides the Potters and Riddle, but he couldn’t determine who it could be. It could be one of Riddle’s crowd or another Order member on a previous visit.
</p><p>
Walking down the hall, it was obvious from the shattered doors that someone with more power than finesse had recently been in the cottage. Someone trained to hide their magical identity. Riddle must have been accompanied by one of his Death Eaters he concluded, though who was still a mystery.
</p><p>
Reaching the nursery, he could feel a great work had been attempted but it wasn’t clear if it had succeeded. Lily Potter lay in the middle of the room, staring sightlessly towards the door. Turning, he could see that something had burned hotly, charring the wall, and burning through the ceiling, somehow without setting fire to the rest of the cottage.
</p><p>
Using a diagnostic charm he’d first learned during his brief infatuation with Grindelwald, he frowned. The unrecognizable runes glowed brightly, almost triumphantly, in the air. Whatever had triggered them, it had been fatal to at least one wizard. Hopefully Riddle, but more likely whomever had accompanied him.
</p><p>Though how the survivors of the runic shield’s destruction had gotten past the anti-apparition wards he’d placed on the cottage was a mystery.
</p><p>
Dumbledore turned his attention towards the crib, and one of the reasons he’d placed protection on both the Potters and Longbottoms following the prophecy being revealed. Riddle would not have shown any mercy to any potential threat. And from the looks of it, from the charred blankets and faint green glow, something unexpected had happened.
</p><p>
Looking down into the empty crib, he scratched his chin. Without knowing what had happened to Riddle and the Potter child, and no witnesses, his options were limited. He would have to bring in the Ministry, much as he disliked to involve them in Order business. Perhaps the Unspeakables would be able to find answers to his questions.
</p>
<hr/><p>
Even as Dumbledore and the Order increased the protective wards around the place they’d hidden the Longbottoms, the news that the self described Dark Lord, Voldemort, had attacked the Potters and had been defeated spread across wizarding Britain. Though the Unspeakables refused to detail how this had happened, whispered rumors claimed it had occurred when he’d attempted to kill the Potter child, who was now missing, and presumed murdered by Death Eaters afterward.
</p><p>
Dumbledore didn’t discourage this belief. The Unspeakables in the Department of Mysteries claimed Riddle was no longer on this plain of existence. Which was not exactly the same thing as being dead. He did not believe the conditions of the prophecy had been completed, so Riddle was likely to return at some future date to fulfill them.
</p><p>
In the meantime, the Order assisted the Ministry in hunting down the leaderless Death Eaters. Ministry aurors had already apprehended Sirius Black, after he’d killed Peter Pettigrew and some muggles, and had thrown him into Azkaban. And with Voldemort no longer to be feared, other members of Riddle’s inner circle were also in the process of being rounded up.
</p><p>A number of them had been captured when they’d attacked the Longbottom hiding place the week after the Potters died, and were awaiting trial, though one of Riddle’s most notorious disciples, Bellatrix Lestrange hadn’t been found and had not been seen since before the attack on the Potters.
</p><p>
Dumbledore was concerned with her disappearance, though given her known instability as one of the Noble House of Black, as demonstrated by Sirius Black betraying his childhood friends, it was more for the chaos she could cause in pursuing revenge than bringing the Death Eaters together under a new leader.
</p>
<hr/><p>
And over time the missing Potter child would become a legend. Part of the same mystery of the ultimate fate of Voldemort, only briefly remembered every Halloween as the sacrifice of the Potters was memorialized. And the subject of conspiracy theories whispered late at night in the Leaky Caldron and elsewhere.
</p><p>
Dumbledore encouraged the rumors that somewhere out there the child was being trained to face the dark wizard that had murdered its parents. It might even be true, he supposed.
</p><p>
The Potter properties had not passed to any other members of the family, however distant, and although the child’s name was not yet recorded in the Hogwarts Book of Admittance, the goblins refused Ministry access to the Potter lands and family vaults with a possible member still living.
</p><p>But someday the child would reappear and he did not doubt he would again have access to the Potter vaults to fund the Order. Some members of the Order had contributed more than others, and they were feeling the distinct lack of Potter and Black funds.
</p><p>
Until then, he would pursue other ways to find Riddle and prevent his resurgence. And soon the Longbottom child would be under his influence.</p>
