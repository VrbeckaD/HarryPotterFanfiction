    <p class="western">Zuko lay on the garden bench, in the backyard of number 4 Privet drive. The Dursleys were expecting <em>Important Company</em>, though not for some time yet. Petunia and 'Harry' had spent much of the week preparing the house to receive the guests.</p><p class="western">Despite his deficiencies in the art of manual labour, Zuko had cleaned windows, washed the car, mowed the lawn, trimmed the flower beds (<em>after</em> weeding of course), pruned and watered the roses, manured the garden beds and repainted the garden bench. It had been dried well before he'd turned it into a napping place.</p><p class="western">Now he lay, soaking in the sun, recuperating his energy, trying to rid himself of the sensation of unease that had plagued him for weeks, and wondering what Katara was up to.</p><p class="western">She'd only stayed for a week, careful to keep out of sight of the Dursleys; the waterbender turned fairy had gotten along surprisingly well with Hedwig considering the normal relationship between owls and fairies. Katara had told him she'd return, but he'd yet to see her in the five weeks since they'd said goodbye.</p><p class="western">She wasn't the only one he'd had no contact with. More than a month had passed, and he'd yet to receive a single letter since Nicolas and Perenelle had sent him a postcard from their new house in Canada the day Katara had left. (They'd been keeping in contact on the sly since he'd returned their stone several months prior, apparently not even Dumbledore was in the know about their most recent bout of faking their own death. (Something about him 'being an ass'.))</p><p class="western">Hedwig had returned from her various letter deliveries seeming harassed, but Zuko had no way to find out what happened to her on her flights. Flights which she wouldn't even be going on, if he wasn't capable of picking a lock with a liberated paper-clip and a pencil.</p><p class="western">Zuko continued to refuse to be ashamed of his eclectic skill set.</p><p class="western">He felt a prickle along his spine, the sense that he was being watched. He opened his eyes a fraction, looking through his lashes for the voyeur. There, in the nearby hedge, two large, green eyes.</p><p class="western">Moving fast, but not as fast as he had once been, he rose from the bench, crossed the distance between himself and his target, and ripped the voyeur from its hiding place.</p><p class="western">The creature he'd captured was demented looking, its eyes so wide they appeared crazed. Beneath his fingers Zuko felt a swell of magic, in response he shunted a needle of chi into the centre, like bending without fire. The magic fell apart, as it did for him when he wasn't careful while trying to cast a spell, and the creature began to scream.</p><p class="western">Zuko clamped his free hand around its mouth; across the garden Dudley made his presence known.</p><p class="western">“What the-”</p><p class="western">“Get back in the house Dudley!” In a few seconds, Zuko had gone from relaxed to under-siege. When he spoke, it was with the authority he'd mastered during his command of <em>the Wani</em>. Dudley scampered to obey.</p><p class="western">Zuko had no idea what this creature was, what it wanted, or how it had found him. It was possible it was a friend, but those who meant you well didn't tend to spy from bushes.</p><p class="western">Dudley waddled into the house, calling for his mother, Zuko hot on his heels with the creature. Petunia screamed when she saw it, bringing a soapy frying pan up, hefting it like a weapon, ready for use.</p><p class="western">Zuko slammed the creature on the sturdy dinning table.</p><p class="western">“Who are you, why are you spying on me, who sent you?” Zuko removed his hand from the creature's mouth.</p><p class="western">“Please mister Harry Potter sir, Dobby is here to warn Harry Potter sir.”</p><p class="western">“Warn me about what?” Zuko asked, as Petunia and Dudley waited nervously.</p><p class="western">“Harry Potter must not go back to Hogwarts.”</p><p class="western">“Why?”</p><p class="western">“There is a plot, Harry Potter. A plot to make terrible things happen at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.” Zuko noticed his 'relatives' flinching from the corner of his eye.</p><p class="western">“Then I have to go back, if I'm not there my friends will be in even more danger.”</p><p class="western">“Friends who don't even write to Harry Potter?”</p><p class="western">Zuko narrowed his eyes at the Dobby creature.</p><p class="western">“And how would you know that?” Petunia and Dudley shuddered in fear at the dark tone in 'Harry's' voice. Dobby squeaked, its eyes somehow widening further. It scrabbled in its filthy pillow case for a bundle of letters.</p><p class="western">“Dobby hoped if Harry Potter thought his friends had forgotten him, Harry Potter might not want to go back to Hogwarts!”</p><p class="western">So this had been what was upsetting Hedwig, Zuko snatched the letters and threw them onto the table.</p><p class="western">Then a horrifying thought struck him, the unease of the last few weeks dropping into his stomach, like a ball of ice-cold lead.</p><p class="western">“Katara. The Fairy that left here a few weeks ago, did you hurt her?” Dobby shook, Zuko shook him harder. “DID YOU HURT HER!”</p><p class="western">Dobby, screaming, scrabbled in its pillow case again, this time it pulled out a crystal vial, like the ones Zuko used in potions class. Inside, with barely any room to move, was Katara, her wings bent at odd angles.</p><p class="western">Zuko's hand wrapped around the vial with deceptive calm, he felt detached from himself as he spoke.</p><p class="western">“You are not to interfere with my mail again, and more importantly, you are <em>never</em> to touch her again. Get out.” Zuko shunted another burst of chi into the creature, a final warning, before releasing it. Glancing to Petunia he said “I have to get her to London.”</p><p class="western">Dobby disappeared with a pop, and Zuko rushed upstairs. He emptied out one of the Sunflower Café baskets, stuffing a small cushion inside, with great care he popped the holey cork from the vial and slid Katara out onto the cushion. With less care he wrote a rushed note to the Darlings.</p><p class="western">'She's been without Dust for weeks, captured by stranger, just found out PLEASE HELP HER'</p><p class="western">“Hedwig, take Katara to the Darlings, please, fly safe and fly fast as you can.”</p><p class="western">Hedwig made a noise of understanding and perched on the basket.</p><p class="western">“Hold on Katara.” He sealed the lid, and opened the window. Hedwig swept past with such speed, she was gone from his sight in seconds. Turning to his room Zuko ran a frustrated hand through his hair.</p><p class="western">“I have to get to London," he said to no one.</p><p class="western">Hastily, he pack a bag with two changes of clothes, a wallet of muggle currency, and a pouch of wizard coins, he added his wand as an after thought and raced downstairs.</p><p class="western">Petunia was waiting for him with a sour expression, he cut her off before she could rant.</p><p class="western">“I'm sorry I had to bring that thing in the house, I didn't think you'd want me dealing with it in the back yard, where the neighbours might see.”</p><p class="western">For a brief second, Petunia's pinched face gave way to an expression of fury.</p><p class="western">“A taxi will be here for you soon, it will take you to the train station.” Harry blinked at the unexpected kindness. “Just don't come back tonight, the Masons will be here.”</p><p class="western">“I understand.” Zuko took the chance to gather his missing mail from the table, and stuff it in his bag, before the taxi arrived. </p>
<hr/><p class="western">The trip to the train station was quite, save a very short discussion between Zuko and the driver.</p><p class="western">“You seem nervous, everything alright?”</p><p class="western">“I just found out a dear friend is in critical condition, she could die.” 'Or worse.'</p><p class="western">Katara had explained to Zuko about the Fairies of Neverland, and their relationship with Pixie Dust, the stabilising properties, and the horror stories of what happened to fairies who went too long without.</p><p class="western">The trip to London had never, felt so long. </p>
<hr/><p class="western">Michael was the only Darling in the Travel Store when Zuko finally arrived.</p><p class="western">“The other two took her to Neverland as soon as she arrived. Want to tell me what happened?”</p><p class="western">Zuko slid down a wall, it had been a long time since he'd last cried, but now his body trembled and his eyes stung. Katara was in this world because of him, had been captured because of him. If she died, it would be because of him.</p><p class="western">“There... there was this creature, it called itself Dobby. It's been stealing my mail since summer started, trying to stop me from going back to Hogwarts. It was trying to make me think no one cared about me, that, I don't know, that I had no one. It must have thought... I don't know what it thought. That Katara was trying to contact someone for me? Maybe?" Zuko sank his fingers into his hair, gripping the strands to tight it felt like they'd rip out. “She was stuck in a crystal vial for weeks. I should have known something was wrong, how could I have not known?”</p><p class="western">“How could you have known?” Micheal sat down across from him.</p><p class="western">“There are Spirits who tell me things, they could have told me.” Zuko felt sick, “but then, Katara doesn't have anything to do with 'my' Destiny, which is what they're interested in.” But maybe it would explain the sense of unease he'd been feeling.</p><p class="western">“I'd like to be able to tell you she's going to be alright.”</p><p class="western">“Please don't lie to me.”</p><p class="western">The duo sat in silence.</p>
<hr/><p class="western">Zuko tried to get his mind off Katara's condition by sorting through his mail. Half of the mail was the letters he'd sent, the rest had been sent to him. He had a dozen from Neville and Hermione, three from Ron, a few from various other acquaintances, and one from a man named Remus.</p><p class="western">Evidently, Remus had shared a dorm room with James Potter, and been prefects with Lily Evans, the man was offering more photos, and stories of Harry's parents during their school days.</p><p class="western">Zuko considered carefully, did he <em>want</em> to know about Harry's parents?</p><p class="western">He put the question aside for the rest of his mail.</p><p class="western">Ron had invited him to stay at his place for the summer, as had Neville, Hermione sent anecdotes about her summer school, and her research concerning the books the Spirits had made her read.</p><p class="western">
  <em>'I get the feeling you already suspected: It's the ring.'</em>
</p>
<hr/><p class="western">The second night of Zuko's stay, John returned with news.</p><p class="western">“Queen Clarion thinks Katara will be alright, they have her submerged in pixie dust, they're going to leave her there until she can get out by herself. From what I heard, Katara regained consciousness long enough to tell Clarion a 'Yue' had been 'keeping her afloat.' Whatever that means.”</p><p class="western">“Yue's a princess from our homeland, she turned into the Moon, they were friends.”</p><p class="western">Neither brother was sure how to respond to that. They'd been told, via the Fairies, about Katara's (and by extension: Zuko's) unusual background; but there were just some things that weren't easy to responded to.</p>
<hr/><p class="western">Zuko was staring unseeing at various travel brochures, when John spoke.</p><p class="western">“You should go home, we'll contact you if we hear anything, but at this point... no reason to waste time here.”</p><p class="western">Zuko nodded, the older man was right.</p><p class="western">John walked him to the train, and saw him off, Zuko continued to stare at the world, still not really looking at it. Somehow he managed to make it back to Privet Drive, Petunia stuck her head out of the kitchen when he entered the house.</p><p class="western">“You're back then.” He nodded in response, Petunia stood awkwardly in the doorway, as if she had something else to add, but didn't know how to phrase it, or make herself ask.</p><p class="western">“She's with healers now, they think she got there in time but... it's just a waiting game at this point, she'll get better or she won't.”</p><p class="western">There was still something else unsaid, he could see it, but he couldn't bother figuring out what it was, he waited for her to speak.</p><p class="western">“What... Who, is she?” The woman seemed genuinely curious. He contemplated how to answer.</p><p class="western">“Her name is Katara, she's a Fairy of Neverland, and she's my friend.”</p><p class="western">“And that... <em>thing</em>?”</p><p class="western">Zuko didn't bother to hide his sneer.</p><p class="western">“My contacts say it was something called a 'House Elf,' but according to them, what we saw was radical, and abnormal behaviour.” A silence stretched between them, uncomfortable and heavy. “Was there anything else?” He was sick of waiting.</p><p class="western">“The Masons commented on the portrait you sent us for Christmas, asked where we got it.” Zuko understood the question in her statement.</p><p class="western">“I made it,” her expression made it clear, she'd been afraid he'd say that. Petunia squared her shoulders, working herself up to say something she didn't want to say.</p><p class="western">“Mrs. Mason wanted one for her niece, would you...” as amusing for Zuko as it was, to watch the woman act like she was choking on an invisible lemon, he really didn't want to be dealing with people right now. In an uncharacteristic move, he took pity on the woman.</p><p class="western">“I have some wood left from Christmas, if I move some of the things around in the garden shed I should have enough room. Did Mrs. Mason have a subject matter in mind?”</p><p class="western">Petunia somehow managed to look relieved, without loosing an ounce of her 'choking on a lemon' expression.</p><p class="western">“Apparently her niece is very into...” Zuko wondered if his 'aunt' was in actual physical pain, “mermaids and dragons.” Petunia shuddered.</p><p class="western">“Oh I bet Vernon loved that.” The thought of the obese man finding out brought a small smirk to his face.</p><p class="western">“He doesn't know, Mrs. Mason approached me about it while the men were talking business, she's willing to pay for a picture a bit bigger than ours.” Then she mentioned how much Mrs. Mason was willing to pay, and Zuko felt his eyebrows shoot into his hairline.</p><p class="western">'At least it pays well, and it'll help me keep my mind off of Katara.'</p><p class="western">“I'll get started right away.”</p>
<hr/><p class="western">There was enough room in the garden shed for his work. Just.</p><p class="western">Before he even began to work on the wood, Zuko drew ink portraits of his designs, trying to find something that was just right. Which was much harder for someone he'd never met, than his companions from school.</p><p class="western">Added to that delay, Zuko spent several minutes cursing himself out, when he realised: every mermaid he drew bore Katara's face.</p><p class="western">In the end, he settled on a design depicting a mermaid, (still Katara,) and an old 'Eastern' dragon (Uncle Iroh), playing Pai Sho on a beach. Even if the game was unknown in this world, it was clear they were playing some kind of board game.</p><p class="western">He was finishing the final step of treatment, to protect the picture, when Petunia knocked on the shed door.</p><p class="western">“Just a moment,” Zuko called to let her know he'd heard. He'd established with her when she'd brought him lunch the first day of work, some steps required a very still environment, he'd let her know when it was safe to enter, or open the door himself.</p><p class="western">Four minutes later he opened the door to Petunia, holding a plate with a sandwich in one hand, and a letter in the other.</p><p class="western">“An owl brought this for you ten minutes ago... how's the picture?”</p><p class="western">Zuko accepted the letter, opening it as he replied.</p><p class="western">“Finished, you can send it to Mrs. Mason tomorrow.”</p><p class="western">Petunia responded, but Zuko had no idea what she'd said, the words on the paper drowning everything out.</p><p class="western">“<em>Harry, Got word from Wendy, Katara's up and about. She says she doesn't remember much about what happened. Clarion's going to keep her in N.L. until the healers are sure there's no side effects.</em></p><p class="western"><em>The girls send their love. Regards, Michael Darling</em>.”</p><p class="western">In the back of his mind, Zuko realised he now understood the expression 'weak in the knees,' as he dropped to the ground, flooded with relief. Petunia's startled squawk of 'Harry!' brought him back to his senses.</p><p class="western">“She's going to be alright, she's going to be alright!”</p>
