    <p>
  <span>Ron wasn’t a heavy drinker, but he gladly swallowed down a third pint of firewhisky late one Friday night, only hours after his best friend and little sister got married. He wanted to get drunk so he wouldn’t have to think about what they might have been doing.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He wouldn’t have been drinking if Hermione were there. He didn’t drink around her. But he didn’t think it would be appropriate to invite his ex-girlfriend to a drink on the second anniversary of their breakup. (Yes, he kept track.)</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He missed her, but even he could tell that she and Viktor were made for each other. But ever since they had broken up, their friendship had been different. They didn’t talk nearly as much, and they certainly bickered much less. He missed it.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>And Harry. Merlin, where did he start with Harry? They were still best friends, but something small had changed between them when he and Ginny got together. Maybe that was just Ron, though. They seemed happy enough together, so he had learned how to be fine with it.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He glanced up and down the bar. Nobody he recognized. Good. They wouldn’t see him trying to get drunk alone on a Friday night after the Boy Who Lived married his sister. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The door creaked open and a burst of laughter drifted inside. Ron was directly in front of the door, so he had to completely turn around to see who it was. And when he did, his stomach dropped.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>They weren’t his least favorite people (that privilege went to Voldemort if you could call him human) but they were pretty damn close. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Draco, look who it is,” Pansy Parkinson said, sitting on one side of Ron. Draco sat on the other.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Can’t quite tell, Pansy. Let me think for a second,” Draco said. He pretended to scrutinize Ron as if he were a painting. “Red hair, scruffy, getting wasted alone on a Friday night. He must be a Weasley.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Which one, though?” Pansy asked. “Can’t tell any of them apart.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Ron was almost happy to hear that Pansy and Draco hadn’t changed, at least. They were still the same spoiled brats who thought they were funny. It was comforting, in a way, to know that they hadn’t changed. And their teasing didn’t even bother him anymore. He wasn’t thirteen years old anymore.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco stopped laughing. Apparently, Pansy had taken the joke farther than he wanted. Or he just couldn’t think of anything to say, and he was upset that she got the last word.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“So, Weasel, why did Harry and Ginny rush the wedding? We’ve got bets going. I say Ginny was just too eager to have a whole bushel of kids like Molly. Pansy think she’s already pregnant and is just trying to hide it,” Draco said, grinning at Ron.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Anger surged through him. He didn’t doubt that they were making bets. Hearing Draco talk about his family like that made him want to cast all kinds of curses. He curled his hand around the wand in his pocket.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“She’s obviously pregnant. The little whore probably couldn’t wait to get her pants off for Harry. Plus, did you see how fat she looked at the proposal?” Pansy said.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You shut your mouth about my sister,” Ron snapped. "She's not a whore any more than you are, Pansy."</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He knew he would most likely regret losing his temper, but right now, he didn't care. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Excuse me?" she said, standing up. "What did you just say?"</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"You heard me," Ron said.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Yeah, we did. And you'll take that back because Pansy will never be like any of your family," Draco said.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Ron pulled out his wand and stood up. Draco did the same. "Make me," he said. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Hey, you two!" the woman behind the bar said. "Take it outside. I don't want to see this."</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Ron turned and stomped out of the bar, into the cold air. His thin jacket wasn't good protection against the winter at all, but right now, it didn't matter. All that mattered was putting Draco in this place.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>But then Draco walked out of the bar and Ron had a rare moment of self-awareness. He was generally pretty self-aware, just not when he was angry.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>But standing on the sidewalk staring at Draco, he deflated. What in Merlin’s name was he doing? He was a grown man, about to fight an old classmate because he couldn’t control his temper. While he quite enjoyed a good fight, he had to grow up at some point. Harry and Hermione and his family would probably be so disappointed if they found out. He wasn’t a kid anymore.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You still wanna fight me, Weasel?” Draco sneered, holding out his wand. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No, Malfoy,” Ron muttered. “Why do you still do this, though? What do you get out of tormenting people? It’s not going to make people like you. The only attention you get from it is negative.” He paused to take a deep breath to stop tears that were welling up in his eyes for some reason. “We’re not even in school anymore. You have nothing to gain from being a prick anymore.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Before Draco could respond, he turned and walked away, into the night. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Ron had no idea what came over him. It was almost as if he had channeled Hermione just to tell Draco off. Now he was left feeling lonely and empty again. Maybe he had too much to drink.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Either way, he had to get off the street. He really didn’t want to go to his cold, lonely flat. Maybe he could Floo to the Burrow, just for the night. Except then his mum would want to know why he was staying there. He also didn’t really want to stay at his childhood home right now.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He could Floo to Diagon Alley, maybe stay the night with George. He wouldn’t question anything. Yeah, that sounded like a good idea.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Ron turned and walked back to the bar. Pansy was nowhere to be seen, thank Merlin. But Draco was sitting at the bar, staring at his mug of butterbeer. His head shot up when Ron walked in.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Ron,” Draco said, grabbing his sleeve. “Can I… talk to you?” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Ron blinked at him. “Whatever you have to say, it better not take more than five minutes.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco sighed. “I’m…” He looked uncharacteristically unsure of himself. “I just wanted to apologize.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Ron scoffed and turned away, to the bartender. “Do you have a fireplace I could use? It’s an emergency.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The bartender sighed. “Through the back. Don’t dally in there or you’re out for good, you hear?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He nodded and rushed into the back, away from Draco. All he had to do was talk to George. That’d clear his head. </span>
