</p><hr/><p> </p><p>Rose Weasley-Granger didn’t like sadness. She disliked it when she saw people cry. She cried with people when they were hurt. A frightened or injured animal was cause for significant alarm. Hugo, her baby brother, barely ever made a peep as a baby or toddler because Rose was always right there to sooth him and make him happy. No, Rose really didn’t like it when people were sad. In fact, she <em>hated</em> it. She hated it so much, that it had become her mission in life to always spread love and happiness.</p><p>Hermione Granger, Rose’s mother, had told her this two years ago when she was eight. She had said to her, “Rose, you are a sweet girl who knows just what to do or say to fix a damaged heart. Thank you for always knowing when I need a hug.”</p><p>On that night, Rose had only known that her mummy was very sad because her daddy had stopped coming home. In fact, her daddy had just moved into his new flat where she went to visit every other weekend and one evening per week. So, Rose had wrapped her skinny arms around her mum’s waist and looked up at her with big eyes partially hidden behind bushy-brown fringe and whispered, “I love you, Mummy. I promise I will <em>always</em> come home.” The two Granger-Weasley females had shed tears together that night, but after their tears, they had shared silly stories that had them both laughing. Rose remembered the laughter more clearly than the crying. She had missed seeing her mummy laugh.</p><p>Now that she was two years older, though (and her daddy was remarried to her step-mum, Lavender), Rose understood better why her mum had been so sad. She was really proud to say that she had been a good girl for her mum and a helpful big sister to Hugo, and her mum wasn’t so sad anymore. In fact, her mum was happier than Rose had ever remembered her being and that made her feel good.</p><p>A shift in position and long fingered hands being run through pretty white hair brought Rose back to the problem at hand, however. The man on the park bench, looking so lost and sad, was the reason she was remembering both her mum being unhappy <em>and</em> why she didn’t like seeing sad people.</p><p>She wondered if she could make him smile like she made her mummy smile. Grown wizards tended to be harder to make happy. Slowly, she approached him.</p><p>“Hi,” she said softly, her brown eyes watching him closely. The man’s head snapped up, she had startled him. He glanced around quickly before letting his hands fall into his lap.</p><p>“Hey there,” he said kindly. “Are you lost?”</p><p>“No,” Rose answered. “My mum is talking to the little boy under the play house. He’s crying. Are you his daddy?”</p><p>Draco Malfoy felt a lurch in his chest where his heart resided. He knew his son was crying, but he didn’t know what to say to the boy. They had just come from visiting his mother’s grave. It had been a hard year for both of them, but especially Scorpius. How do you get over the death of your mother? Draco didn’t know. He was fortunate that his mother was alive and well. While he had never loved Astoria Greengrass romantically, they’d had a close friendship and a partnership that allowed them to raise their son together until her death just over a year ago. He missed her, but not like Scorpius did.  </p><p>“My name is Rose Weasley,” Draco was startled to find the little girl still standing in front of him. She looked slightly familiar: warm eyes, riotous vibrant red curls. <em>A Weasley,</em> he sneered internally. <em>No idea who she belongs to, though. </em>He tampered down his annoyance. She was just a little girl, after all.</p><p>“You should go find your mother,” he directed.</p><p>“My mum knows where I am,” she told him with a shrug. Then she disarmed him again. “You have such beautiful eyes, sir. I’ve never seen any that color before.” Her words shocked him absolutely. She reached out and he flinched slightly as she touched his hair. Draco wanted to pull away from her, but something made him hold absolutely still. “And your hair is as silky as it looks. What color do you call this? Do you charm it this color?”</p><p>He let out an incredulous laugh. “I don’t charm it.” He gave her a lopsided smile and his chest filled with warmth when she returned the gesture, dimpling in her left cheek. Merlin, she was adorable. Weasley or not. “Who’s your mum, Rose Weasley?”</p><p>“My mum’s name is Hermione.” Draco instantly knew this was true. Just as she said it, he brought up a picture of her mum at eleven-years-old. Except for the hair color, they were identical.</p><p>“So she is,” he confirmed before holding his hand out for the girl. “Let’s go find her and my son, shall we?”</p><p>Rose obliged happily, taking the man’s hand and pulling him to where her mum and Scorpius were hiding in the play house.</p><p>Little did she know, that by offering a smile to a sad-eyed stranger on the park bench, she was starting a journey that would fix numerous damaged souls</p></div>
