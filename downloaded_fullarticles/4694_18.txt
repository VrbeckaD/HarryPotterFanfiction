    <p>31st July 1986</p><p>A young woman stood within the cemetery of Godric's Hollow, her gaze locked on the marble grave that seemed to almost shine in the night, the grave that marked where Lily Evans Potter was buried. The young woman was attired in black spandex pants that hugged at her lower curves, accompanied by a dark purple, low cut shirt that left an ample amount of cleavage exposed, her dark hair hung freely, her hazel irises turned dark as her gaze narrowed.</p><p>"Sorry I'm late, but your grave was enchanted, appears that somebody didn't want certain magical creatures finding you." She chuckled as she took a tight hold of her shovel and set about digging up the grave.</p><p>Her movements seem to almost blur as her speed increased as she grew used the repetitive motions, ignoring how loose pieces of soil that struck her flesh began to sizzle and lightly burn.</p><p>"Man I hate churches; hallowed soil really is a pain." She muttered as she found herself getting lower and lower until finally.</p><p>THUD</p><p>She paused her actions and lifted her shovel up before lightly tapping the ground again and received a similar sound, a small smirk graced her lips, she turned and threw the shovel out of the hole, she lowered herself to a crouched position and began to wipe the top soil away, ignoring the pain as she saw the coffin. She pushed off hard and leapt out of the hole.</p><p>"Excuse me but what do you think you're doing?" Asked a rather aged voice, the young woman turned and was met by the site of a rather old man, his posture was hunched creating the illusion that he was shorter than herself, a small white beard adorned his face along with a small number of wrinkles, his attire consisting of a sandy coloured overcoat, a grey sweater beneath it with grey cargo pants.</p><p>The man turned to look from her to the hole before back to herself.</p><p>"Grave robber! Do you have no respect for the dead?" He spat, his tone seeming to ooze venom, she eyed him up and down, before her gaze narrowed to the strong heartbeat in his neck.</p><p>"You'll do nicely." She muttered, her gaze seeming to turn almost predatory as her irises turned a sickly yellow, the man himself found himself drawn to her eyes and quickly began to lose himself in them until his pupils were dilated and his posture became weak, her smirk grew.</p><p>"Just how I like them, weak willed, pity you're not younger, your blood will be so thin, oh well, I doubt she'll be too bothered about it." She sighed before turning back to face the hole and the coffin within it.</p><p>"What you waiting for? Wake up!" She called down, nothing happened, a frustrated sigh erupted from her lips, she jumped back down and flung the coffin door open, within lay the corpse of Lily Evans Potter, not a day of the last five years had affected her in the slightest, she wore a scarlet dress that she was buried in, a similar shade of lipstick upon her lips, her complexion deathly pale, not that it was a surprise, she appeared so peaceful, almost as if she was sleeping in the white interior of the coffin. Her hands crossed over her chest, her wand in her hand.</p><p>"Man that death curse really did a number on ya didn't it?" She sighed before lowering herself into a crouched position, her balance on the coffins walls unaffected by the change of position, she slammed her palms on walls of the upper end of the coffin, she leaned down. Stopping when her face was inches from Lily's, her irises turned scarlet.</p><p>"Your sirer commands you awaken!" She roared, her voice turning demonic as she focused all her power on Lily, her entire body flinched and seemed to tense, the young woman grew a small smirk, Lily's eyes snapped open, briefly glowing with a similar scarlet glow before they dimmed to their human shade of green.</p><p>Her eyes seemed to dart round in all directions, swelling with fear and confusion as she inhaled deeply and quickly before her gaze settled on the woman "You!" she gasped.</p><p>"Welcome back to the land of the living." She remarked before jumping out of the hole once again. Lily stumbled to her feet, falling against the walls of mud that surrounded her, dizzy and weak, she screamed in pain as the hallowed soil touched her flesh, scolding it, she pushed away from it, stumbling, fighting to maintain her balance, her wand slipping out of her grasp.</p><p>The dark haired woman's hand shot down and gripped the back of her neck before pulling her out of the hole and placing her on the ground, placing a hand on her shoulder to stabilise her when she began to fall in the direction of the hole again before pushing her into the man.</p><p>"Drink!" She commanded, Lily's eyes widened at the request but couldn't help how her gaze locked on the pulse beating in his neck, it was almost hypnotic the way it drew her in, her mouth slowly opening, her throat burning in desire, her body craving sustenance, so weak that she had to rest against the man.</p><p>"Drink, drink and you'll be strong again." She ordered, Lily couldn't resist any longer, she reared her head, her canines erupting into fang as her pupils expanded and consumed her irises and the whites of her eyes, black veins oozing out of the sides of her eyes before with incredible force she brought her fangs down and pierced the man's neck and began to drink, heavily and forcefully.</p><p>The taste filled her mouth, the taste of the delectable thick scarlet liquid; it slid down her throat with little effort. Her eyes closed as she savoured its taste, feeling her strength returning in bulk with every drop that nourished her body, gradually bringing her arms around her meal, her grip tightening as her strength returned. She continued to drink until not a drop was left, her grip increasing as she forcefully sucked at the wound, desperate for more of the delicious liquid, her grip tightening until the sickly cracking sound of the man's back being split in two brought her back to reality.</p><p>Her eyes widened in horror as she released her grip on the drained and broken body, it fell limply to ground. She stumbled back, her body shaking, her mind going into shock from what she'd done, her eyes reverting to their natural colour once again.</p><p>"Oh for god's sake Lilly grow up, if you're going to react like this to every kill you're in for one hell of a rude awakening." The other woman sighed, Lilly span on her heel to face her, her expression of horror hardening as her gaze became a glare.</p><p>"YOU! YOU DID THIS!" Lilly screamed as she charged at the other woman, pouncing on her, her legs swinging round her thighs and gaining a strong grip as her hands encircled the woman's neck, the sudden force causing her to fall into the grave, shattering the coffin with their landing, she gasped in pain as sharp pieces of wood pierced of her back.</p><p>Lily began to pull up the woman's head before slamming it down on the ground, repeating the process several times, ignoring the light smoke caused by where her sirer's body touched the hallowed ground.</p><p>"You did this to me!" Lily snarled, her pupils consuming her eyes once again, the dark veins returning.</p><p>"Yes I did." She admitted before bringing up her knee with incredible force and speed, Lily lost her grip and was rewarded with a powerful kick to the stomach, embedding her into the end wall of dirt surrounding them, she gasped as her body began to sizzle again "and the name's Dawn, remember it." She spat, rising to her feet before thrusting out her hand, gripping Lilly's neck with enough force that it began to bruise.</p><p>"Why?" Lilly gasped out, gritting her teeth in pain both from the grip and hallowed soil.</p><p>"Why? Simple really, like many creatures we vampires are seen as lower than humans and are denied basic 'human' rights and are even hunted because of it, the war came and an opportunity presented itself to fix everything, my sister had the gift of sight and knew what your darling children would grow up to be so I inserted myself, by turning you the mother into a vampire the saviour of the wizarding world would be half vampire and thus would help the image of vampires greatly and could even help us." Dawn explained.</p><p>"What…are…you talking about?...Saviour?" Lilly questioned.</p><p>"Your son defeated Voldemort and according to some prophecy he's the only one who can do it again, so he becomes the saviour of the wizarding world and half vampire, get it yet?" Dawn asked as she licked her fangs.</p><p>"He can't come back!" Lilly snapped.</p><p>"He can and will, he has made more than enough Horcruxes to do so, won't be easy but he will return." Dawn explained, Lily paled slightly at hearing the term Horcrux.</p><p>"I'll stop him!" Lily snarled, her pain turning to rage.</p><p>"If you like you may try, but no matter, he will return one way or another…but I still have need if you." Dawn stated.</p><p>"What?" Asked the redhead.</p><p>"Can't you feel it?" Dawn questioned.</p><p>"Feel what?" Lily asked her rage subsiding, Dawn pulled Lily out of the wall and placed her back on the ground.</p><p>"I made you Lily and as such you're a part of my clan as are your kids, I can feel them and their pain, their fear, I hear their cries for you, the killing curse put you into a coma, one only I could force you to awaken from, as vampires that curse would put us into a coma, we're already dead and you can't kill the dead but you can do things like that to them, I turned you and so you are loyal to me and would normally have to obey me, if I didn't leave you after you were turned, your independent and are only loyal subconsciously to me but that was enough for me to awaken you. Now normally I'd have left you in your grave, can't draw too much attention to myself or that your babies are half vampire, but their cries…I couldn't stand it, so I awoke you, now focus, listen to your instincts." Dawn instructed, Lily closed her eyes and did as instructed, it only took moments for it to hit her, the pain, the fear, her eyes snapped open, black, dark veins spreading from her eyes.</p><p>"How do I find them?" Lily snarled, her fangs fully extended.</p><p>"Simple, listen and focus, your connection to them is stronger than mine, you will be able to locate them, now go but know this I may just call upon you in the near future and if I do you will come and I will come to you should you need my assistance." Dawn explained, bending down and picking up the wand Lily had dropped when she was first lifted from the hole and handed it to her, Lily fled, her speed making her little more than a blur.</p><p>Dawn stretched out her muscles and brushed dirt and wood from her body, pulling out the odd spike and chucking it to the ground before leaping from the, tossing the corpse from Lily's snack into the hole before beginning to refill the said hole.</p><p>A/N Not the longest of chapters but still not ridiculously short, first time writing Harry Potter in…since 2013 when I lost updated Bloom Goes To Hogwarts, so please forgive I'm a little rusty or don't update quickly, twins come in the next chapter, probably will be a harem but don't hold me to it, I'm out of practice with lemons so don't know if there will be any, just a small warning, will most likely contain twincest dark, maybe grey Harry.</p>
