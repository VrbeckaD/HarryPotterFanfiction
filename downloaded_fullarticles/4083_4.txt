    <p>Once upon a time, in a faraway land, a young prince lived in a shining castle. He was throwing himself a glittering 20th birthday and everyone in the village was invited. But then, on that snowy April night, an old beggar man came to the castle and offered him a single white rose in return for shelter from the bitter cold. </p>
<p>Repulsed by his haggard appearance, the prince lied, saying the castle was full and they were out of room and turned the old man away. But the man warned him not to be deceived by appearances, for true beauty is found within. And when the prince dismissed him again, the old man's ugliness melted away to reveal a powerful white-bearded sorcerer. </p>
<p>The prince tried to apologize, but it was too late, for he had seen that there was no love in his heart. And as punishment, he transformed him into a hideous beast and placed a powerful spell on the castle and all who resided there. The villagers would not remember the castle or anyone who lived there. </p>
<p>Ashamed of his monstrous form, the beast concealed himself inside his castle, with a magic mirror as his only window to the outside world. The white rose the sorcerer had offered was truly an enchanted rose, which would bloom until his 30th year. If he could learn to love another and earn their love in return by the time the last petal fell, then the spell would be broken. If not, he would be doomed to remain a beast for all time. As the years passed, he fell into despair and lost all hope. </p>
<p>For who could ever learn to love a beast?</p>
