    <p>My name is Allison Rogers. As a longtime friend of Mister Black, I found myself much aggrieved when I learned that he had been captured for the heinous crimes of which he was accused.</p><p>Sirius Black was a complex individual, like a diamond's facets each competing to outshine the other...brilliant, talented, funny and often reflective; although, he presented as rash, quick to judge and often downright disagreeable...He was usually quiet as if he hadn't a care in the world, although, those closest to him would know otherwise...he seemed a grumpy so-n-so back when I knew him in school, even mean sometimes. <em>Unless</em> he thought you were worthy of his time and attention. I was one of the lucky few to escape Mister Black's notice (for the most part; he really only yelled at me. Still it hurt because he made you feel like you let him down)...I think James Potter and Lily Evans had an awful lot to do with that though. Being housed in Gryffindor tower with the wizdarding version of the Fab Four was always...<em>interesting</em>.  At any given moment, there was always some kind of drama going on. While some of us had great home lives, a good portion of us didn't, and one especially, didn't: <em>Sirius Black. </em>I had only come to realize this <em>after</em> he left Hogwarts, that he was merely a product of his upbringing; I had returned to visit with Lily and James and I had asked about the old gang, they told me that Remus and Sirius lived with them, but they were usually doing some kind of work for the Order, so they rarely saw them. </p><p>"I'll be sure to tell him that you asked about him," James said as he sipped on his coffee.</p><p>I heard Lily's chuckle as I locked eyes with my "brother."</p><p>"I believe I asked about the both of them?"</p><p>James nodded. "You did. But I know who you meant. We both do, don't we darling?" He smiled brightly as Lily rounded the chair and stood behind her husband and grinned at me. </p><p>"It'll make his day," she added.</p><p>"It's a bleedin' conspiracy..." I replied under my breath.</p><p>While still in school, I remembered having crossed paths with Sirius late one Saturday morning; he'd been leaning against a wall, completely still, as if he were concentrating on his breathing...He was visibly upset, that was easy to see, by the crumpled letter in his fist, his ridged stance, his clenched jaw and eyes. When I approached him and inquired if he were alright, the boy nearly bit off my head. They (his "family" ) must have been horrific toward him judging by his actions toward some individuals. I thanked all the gods that I knew that he had ever counted me among his enemies. Suffice it to say, I ran through the Common Room only to be stopped by James, who was nearly like an older brother to me...wasn't easy for him to catch me; I was in tears and I didn't want anyone to see me. Still he and Lily along with Remus managed to get the needed information out of me. Vexed, James, Remus and Peter went out in search of him and James having been the one to have located him first, made him apologize to me upon his return to the Common Room.</p><p>"Sorry I blew up at you," he said quietly upon reaching me in the Common Room, sitting on the sofa with Lily.</p><p>I couldn't look him in the eye; he had a way of peering into a bit of your soul and it unnerved a lot of people, me included. At the time, I didn't know that I looked at people in the same manner. Late that night, I got out of bed and wandered downstairs to the Common Room only to find him sitting before the fireplace staring at the fire. I must have made some kind of noise, because he looked away from the hearth and saw me staring at him with fear all over my face. He smiled and waved me down.</p><p>"Wotcher Rogers," he asked as he patted at the floor beside him. I shook my head and he produced his wand and levitated a pillow to the floor and then patted it as well. "Come on, I won't bite. I promise."</p><p>I sat next to him, pulling my nightgown over my legs as I brought them to my chest. "I couldn't sleep," I told him.</p><p>"Me either." He produced the crumpled letter that he had been in his fisted hand earlier that morning and held it out. I moved to reach for it, expecting him to withdraw it, but he didn't, he merely held it out. I took the parchment from his hand and uncrumpled it to read it.</p><p>The contents of the letter was horrific at best. I was from his parents and it reeked of malice and hate. Simply put, his mother spoke of her utter disappointment with him and his "bad attitude" and that if he didn't drop his so called friends and come to his senses, then he was well on his way to being disowned.</p><p>I felt awful for him and I rocked on my rear and knelled on my knees and held the letter to the fireplace. "This is poison, Sirius. You should burn it."</p><p>He nodded and motioned toward the hearth. "Do it," he said. "Please?"</p><p>I tossed the letter into the fire and together, we watched it burn. I turned around to face him and looked into his gray eyes. "You have friends here Sirius. People who really care about you." I hugged his neck and I felt his arms circle around me and as he wept; I could have sworn I heard him mutter than he deserved no one's compassion...it shattered my heart. And I wept with him.</p><p>I've never told anyone about that. Until now.</p><p>I feel that I need to tell you how all this came about...me penning Black's memoirs or his "tail," a pun, just so you know. It grieves me something terrible that this is what he wants to talk about...but I think that it's for the people who survived him...the ones he really cared about. I count myself blessed to be counted among those precious few.</p><p>I happened to be at my tiny flat in the Soho district of London when I read the headline and I distinctly remember reading the headline that practically screamed that Sirius had escaped the confines of Azkaban prison...I jumped up (scaring my cat and causing her to hiss at me) and squealed with elation. Not once did I think that he would <em>EVER</em> go after his best friend's child...he was <u>no</u> death eater! I knew that for a fact! I also knew that he <em>never</em>, <em><u>EVER</u></em> supported You Know Who...he fought them at every turn, didn't he? </p><p>How do I know this? </p><p>He saved my happy and oblivious Quidditch-playing arse on not one, not two times, but <em>three</em> times...apparently, someone wanted the Irish to lose the British Quiddich Cup? Anyway, each time after seeing to any injuries that I may have sustained, did he proceed to yell at me and then turn on James, Remus and then himself for shielding me like they did; why they didn't think I need to learn how to duel properly, he'd never know...That they'd rectify it as soon as my game schedule would allow. He said it was because he cared about me...again, I think James had everything to do with that...his parents had suggested that they make me an "honorary Potter", especially after the summer I spent with them when my Dad was trying to secure the World Cup for the Irish...let's just say that I learned a lot about a lot of things that summer and Quidditch was only part of it...And true to his word, they did teach me how to duel properly and I took to it like a duck to water.</p><p>I'd always known he was not guilty of the atrocities they accused him of when the Potters were murdered and just like always, no one listened to me...for what could a jock <u>possibly</u> know about anything?</p><p>I got to see him a few times though after his infamous prison escape. I happened to be in Hogsmeade with two other players from two other teams, on our way to Hogwarts for the purpose of recruiting while Sirius Black was at large and I was tickled pink every single time he was "spotted" and they were unsuccessful with his capture...my mates thought I'd gone mad!</p><p>We were near the edge of the village when this <em>very</em> large skinny dog walking toward us happened to cross our path. I remember it clearly: I stopped in my tracks and glanced over my shoulder doing a double take; the dog had stopped in the middle of the path lifting his head, his nose sniffing at the air as if he'd caught a scent of something. He turned around and headed in our direction and trotted past us. As a cat fancier, I was a little unnerved when the dog stopped, turned around and sniffed again as he passed us. Then, he spun and sat on his haunches and whined, lifting his paw and looking up at me with those sad puppy dog eyes...you know the ones...we've all seen them. I crouched down and held out my hand for him to sniff and then, he licked at it. I realized at once, what, or <em>who</em>  I was dealing with and it was all I could do not to react. I remember slowly pulling my other hand away for in my other hand was my lunch which I was eating as we walked up the path toward the castle. I gave him a piece of my minced meat pie and tried to continue on my way as a lure (Sirius always seemed to be hungry for proteins)...We had an appointment with the Quidditch teams at Hogwarts. The dog followed behind us.</p><p>We had our two hour talk with the school teams about sportsmanship, fair play and all that. We also urged them to come up with cool plays of their own, not just to copy the brilliance of House Teams before them. All the while, the dog was staring at one single player...even went up to him and put his head on the boy's knees, gazing up at him adoringly. Yes you guessed right, the boy was the Seeker for the Gryffindor team, Harry Potter himself and instinctively, I felt my heart fall to the pit of my stomach.</p><p>And that's when things started to click in my head. So, I took the train back to London taking the dog with me, telling him that he needed healing and that Harry would be alright...besides, he had Dumbledore and Lupin to look after him, didn't he?</p><p>The look on the dog's face was priceless when I mentioned Lupin...he actually did this kind of prancing dance as if he needed to go do his business...So, just in case, I found a bit of clothesline rope in a small box in the cupboard beneath my kitchen sink. Of course, he didn't have to "go" at all...but he did manage to pull me down the walkway so hard that I almost fell several times, nearly dislocating my shoulder.</p><p>It wasn't until I addressed him as "Sirius," did he stop and turned to face me, his ears flattened to his head.</p><p>Then, it was <em>my</em> turn to yell at <em>him</em>.</p><p>And you can bet, I really let him have it, right in the middle of Soho. People must have thought I'd gone round the bend screaming at a dog for worrying all of us...He lowered his head and walked past me to the front of my building and climbed the steps to the main door and waited to be let in. So, I took him back up to my flat and once inside, he materialized into Sirius Black in front of me.</p><p>Of course, I seen him transform before, but I had no idea of the deplorable state the poor man had been in for years and I think I fainted because the next thing I remember, I was waking up on my sofa and there were two bowls of left over soup on my table, each with a glass of ale, one of which had been partially consumed no less, and the black dog was laying on the floor by my side. "Don't like the soup," I asked.</p><p>The dog merely looked at me and lay his head on his massive paws and closed his eyes.</p><p>It didn't occur to me that his stomach wouldn't have been able to tolerate real food after having been served horrid gruel for twelve years.</p><p>And my cat? Well, she wasn't a fan of Mister Black at all...she stayed high up and did the "<em>Vulture-kitty</em>" thing from the top most shelf of my book case and of course, true to his nature as a dog, he stared up at her for hours on end, daring her to move.</p><p>I didn't see "Sirius Black" again for two years until he returned to his ancestral home in Whitehall. Our visits were short, barely enough time to catch up, as there were people all over the house, people constantly invading our privacy, but it was enough to put me in the family way...all it takes is once, my Dad had said to me. Penny is the light of my life and I thank Sirius everyday for giving himself to me thus allowing her to grace the Earth with her sweetness and beauty. As of his writing, she is five and is quite the handful...As a single mother, I certainly have my challenges! But honestly, I wouldn't have it any other way! As he was once the light in my life, she shines brighter...but perhaps I am just a tad bit biased?</p><p>Only when I wrote to him letting him know that I was pregnant, did he began sneaking out of number 12 Grimmauld Place and trotting over to my flat...and since everyone knew "Snuffles," they let him in the building, all the while fussing at him for running away again...He seemed distracted though and appeared visibly guilty of something that was never revealed to me.</p><p>When I learned that he had died protecting Harry Potter, I was devastated...I never got the opportunity to tell him all the things that I had longed to...he was always about seeing me through the pregnancy and making certain that I was comfortable and cared for. I was in my final trimester when he was murdered by Bellatrix LeStrange.</p><p>I curse her. <em>Every. Single. Day</em>.</p><p>So on his birthday some five years later after I put Penny to bed, I dug out my mum's old Ouija board and with two of my friends as well as my cat, after I lit every candle I had in the flat, I placed the planchette on the board and let her rip...I breathed in deeply...</p><p>"Sirius Orion Black the Third, if you're out there, please...let us know?"</p><p>We were met with silence...</p><p>I looked to my friends and tried again. "Siri?" (He always <em>hated</em> that nickname; I thought it might get his "attention".) Then I thought I heard a man's amused laughter, but since my friends didn't seem to hear it, I said nothing.</p><p>I lit a cigarette and took a sip of my wine then placed my fingers on the planchette again.</p><p>"Sir..."</p><p>The planchette began to move beneath the weight of our fingers and my friends and I looked to the other, wondering if any of us were moving it...</p><p>
  <em>"'S.U.P."</em>
</p><p>My eyes filled quickly. That was the very first thing he had ever said to me on the quad outside of school whilst I was enjoying a cigarette in peace, when James and he barrelled from out of nowhere and interrupted my solitude...</p><p>The planchette moved to "<em>hello.</em>" and then spelled out, "L.A.D.I.E.S."</p><p>"How do I know it's really you?"</p><p><em>"Y.O.U.R.A.L.E.I.S.C.H.E.A.P.</em>"</p><p>I burst out laughing. "Well, I can afford better now."</p><p>"<em>S.A.D.P.A.D.F.O.O.T."</em></p><p>"Aww. I'm sad too. We all are. It's not fair."</p><p>"<em>P.L.E.A.S.E.D.O.N.T.B.E</em>."</p><p>"I miss you guys...all of you..."</p><p><em>"J.A.M.E.S.S.A.Y.S</em>." The The planchette moved to "<em>hello</em>," and the planchette moved again to the letters: "<em>D.I.A.N.A." </em>after the hunter-Goddess who could talk to animals.</p><p>I smiled through my tears at seeing my nickname being spelled out. "Hey big brother..."</p><p>The three of us smiled. "What else do we want to ask," June asked.</p><p>I shook my head and shrugged my shoulders.</p><p>"Oh, I know! What's life like there in the great beyond," Kathryn asked as she took a sip of her wine.</p><p>"<em>F.U.N.N.Y.W.E.R.A.L.L.D.E.A.D.H.E.R.E</em>."</p><p>We giggled at the ghostly joke.</p><p>"<em>G.E.T.P.A.R.C.H.M.E.N.T</em>."</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"<em>G.E.T.P.A.R.C.H.M.E.N.T.N.O.W.N.O.W.N.O.W.N.O.W." </em></p><p>"<em>ALRIGHT!</em> Enough already!" I rose from the floor and since expediency seemed prudent, I trotted into my bedroom, having felt like I had moved through a warm patch of air and realized that I had walked through a spirit. Was it him? I had no idea, honestly. I was constantly walking through them at school, so I knew what it was..."You're a bleedin' ghost magnet," Remus had said to me once. "Well, m'mum's dead and I'd like to think that she's with me everyday," I had responded. "So, why not?"</p><p>"Sirius, did I just walk through you?"</p><p>The girls were watching me and my eyes fell to the planchette...it was moving on its own..."<em>YESYESYES" </em>And we all heard the maniacal laughter...and it was enough to frighten my guests straight away.</p><p>"Right. I'm done," Kathryn said.</p><p>"Me as well," June said.</p><p>Didn't take them long to get their things and vacate my flat as I sat on the floor with the board completely stunned. "Well shite! It was their idea to do this!"</p><p>Rolling my eyes, I picked up my glass with a huff, drained it and stood quickly; I nearly lost my balance.</p><p><em>Careful now</em>.</p><p>I looked to the board...it was motionless, but I was keenly aware that I had heard a disapparated voice...I hadn't gone loony and imagined it.</p><p>
  <em>I can't very well catch you if you fall, now can I?</em>
</p><p>His voice was as gentle as I'd ever heard it. I looked around the flat; obviously but no one was present with me; no males at any rate. And then, I felt a warmth surround me like an embrace. Hair tickled the side of my face and I turned to look at what I thought I saw from the corner of my eye: Sirius Black was smiling mischievously at me and then, he winked his eye. I bolted on my hands and knees to the other side of the room and felt my back against the cold wall and I closed my eyes. My cat had assumed her place on the top shelf, staring down at the ghost...he rose in the air so that he was eye to eye with her.</p><p><em>Boo</em>, he teased and she hissed at him. <em>I missed you too, Isis,</em> he said.</p><p>"This was stupid," I thought out loud. "How many times have I talked to the spirits at school? A lot!" I looked up to see that I was alone.</p><p><em>I'm sorry Pet. I didn't mean to frighten you</em>.</p><p>"Startled. You startled me. That's all."</p><p><em>Right</em>.</p><p>"It's true!"</p><p><em>Of course</em>.</p><p>"You're making fun of me...stop it."</p><p><em>Make me</em>, the ghostly voice teased.</p><p>I rolled my eyes and sighed. "Gods! Talking to you is like talking to <em>Peeves.</em>"</p><p>I was met with silence.</p><p>"Oh bother!"</p><p>I entered my kitchen and opened up my ice box and withdrew a small white bakery box, opened it and withdrew a small angel food cake with strawberries and a heavy-whipped cream topping. I opened up a drawer and withdrew a single unlit birthday candle and placed it on the top of the cake.</p><p>"Happy Birthday to you," I sang in a whispered voice. "Happy Birthday to you..." I sniffled.</p><p><em>OH STOP IT! </em><em><u>DON'T</u></em> <em><u>DO THAT</u></em><em>!</em> <em>I don't deserve it!</em></p><p>I held my head in my hands, tears streaking my face.</p><p>"I loved you," I said through my tears.</p><p><em>I know</em>.</p><p>I looked up into my living room, seeing nothing except my sofa and the windows behind it.</p><p>"You do?"</p><p><em>I loved you too</em>.</p><p>"Why didn't you ever say anything!"</p><p><em>You can do better</em>.<em> I've always known that</em>...<em>Reggie</em></p><p>"Well, he's gone as well, isn't he?"<br/><br/>I closed my eyes and buried my face in my arms and bawled my eyes out until my daughter opened the door to her bedroom and walked up to me, asking for a drink of water. I collected myself, asking why she was awake. She'd said that the doggie-man woke her up, wanting to play and I wondered how long he had been visiting her...I looked toward the whispy-looking specter who was smiling adoringly at her.</p><p>At least the ghost was aware of who the child was...She was <em>his</em>. <em>So precious...You know, she's the best thing I've ever done,</em> he said in his ghostly voice.</p><p>Sirius' specter floated in and out of my kitchen, the bathroom and the bedrooms as if he were keeping watch as we slept.</p><p><em>My people need closure. And so do you, Sweetheart. I want you to tell my story,</em> he whispered to me in my dreams sometime in the middle of the night.</p><p>I must have agreed to it at some point...</p>
