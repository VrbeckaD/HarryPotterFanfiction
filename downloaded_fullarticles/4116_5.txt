</p><hr/><p align="center"> </p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">The sun was setting over the small graveyard in Godric's Hollow, turning the small town into a sea of purple and pink. The air was heavy with a strange and cold magic; it was so thick even the non-magical folk felt it. The wrongness of the magic made the townsfolk twitchy, so most chose to stay indoors and away from the center of town where the magic was the thickest. It was nearly August and the temperature was high, unusually so this summer. Tonight even more so. All of this kept everyone indoors and unaware of what was about to occur. Everyone, but the aurors investigating the surge of strange magic in that area.</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>As the sun set the magic reached its peak, and the sky lit up in a blinding flash of light. Seconds later, when the light died out, Lily Potter nee Evans took a breath for the first time in nearly eighteen years. The strange magic clung to her like a second skin, making her own magic surge around her. Lily’s eyes opened slowly, they were terribly dry and she couldn't see a thing. Greedily, she breathed in air that tasted stale. The more of it she breathed, the harder it was to take another. Her pale hand tried to reach up and rub at her sore eyes, only be blocked by something hard covered in a fraying silk cloth. It was then that she remembered the events that lead up to her death. Her eyes widened as her breath quickened, with each breath it became increasingly hard to breathe. </span>

  <em>
    <span>"Lily, take Harry and go! It's him! Go! Run! I'll hold him off!"</span>
  </em>
</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>She remembered, even if she wished she didn’t, turning her back to her husband with her baby boy in her arms. He didn't have his wand. She realized as she barricaded the door of Harry's nursery and picked up one of Harry's small toys to make it a portkey. Only then she realized she didn't have her wand either. They’d gotten complacent, so sure in their security. In Peter Pettigrew. He betrayed them. Now her husband was dead and she and her son were sure to follow. Harry cried out pulling Lily from her thoughts. The door burst open and she dropped Harry into his crib and faced </span>
  <em>
    <span>him.</span>
  </em>
  <span> She spread her arms wide with only the thought of protecting Harry keeping her strong. Her husband was dead. Lily knew this as soon as the charm broke and the door burst open that James, her brave, </span>
  <em>
    <span>brave,</span>
  </em>
  <span> husband would be killed protecting them. She too, would die protecting her son, Lily told herself that if that was how she died she wouldn't mind. As long as he lived, she'd be fine with dying here. </span>
</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>Lily did die. She remembered it clearly, the high voice that hissed ‘</span>
  <em>
    <span>avada kedavra</span>
  </em>
  <span>’ and the flash of the green spell which she didn't even flinch away from or it would hit her son. And as his mother she'd never allow Voldemort to kill him. She would die before she let anyone hurt her son. She didn't look away from her killer in fear as the spell hit. She defied the horrible man standing before her even as she took her last breath.</span>
</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>If her mind had been clearer she would have questioned what she was doing alive inside her coffin. But Lily was scared and she was not thinking rationally. She was only thinking of taking another breath. She was starting to suffocate and it was causing her to panic again. The magic around her reacted to her heightened emotions and with a muffled pop dirt and wood flew up and away from her. She saw the night sky, the stars, for the first time since she went in hiding. Her lungs greedily drank in the fresh air. Heavy tears fell down her cheeks as she lay there, in both relief, because she was alive, and in despair because her husband and son were not.</span>
</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <em>
    <span>James! Oh I can't be alive without him! It’s not fair! </span>
  </em>
  <span>She thought as she desperately crawled from her grave and to his. Her hands desperately dug at the grass as she cried and cried his name.</span>
</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>"James!" Lily repeated over and over again just above a whisper, her throat was too dry; her voice couldn't be any louder. "James!" </span>
</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>The magic which had revived her and still clung to her listened to her desire and brought life back to James Potter. Lily who was unaware of the magic working around her was still attempting to dig him out. </span>
</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">
  <br/>
  <span>"James! Please James! I </span>
  <em>
    <span>need </span>
  </em>
  <span>you!" </span>
