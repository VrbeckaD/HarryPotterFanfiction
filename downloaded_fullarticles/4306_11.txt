    <p>There were four people sitting in comfortable chairs watching the world below through the mist.  They were watching a 15 year old teenager wandering around a deserted neighbourhood, trying to work off the anger he was feeling.<br/>
The woman wearing the yellow dress sighed “ That poor boy, is  there anything that we can do help him or change what is coming and prevent those who will die?”<br/>
“Helga, you know that there is little we can do circumvent or to change that boys fate. I agree with you that the path that the wizarding world is on is a dark one,” said the man in green.<br/>
“Ha! not that you helped prevent the path the world on when you were alive! Making it seem that you were against all Muggle borns learning Magic.  And that snake!  What were you thinking Salazar?! Leaving that thing in the School.”<br/>
“ Godric! You know I left the Basilisk there as protection for the school, not to kill the students there.  Any student that crossed the threshold was to be protected! No matter their background.  I just didn’t like all of our students families!  Some of those muggles were not worthy of having children in the first place let alone children with magic!!! There is nothing that we could do to prevent our legacy's from changing over time.  Do you think that I like that my heir is going around killing anything less than pure blood in my name.”<br/>
“Enough, both of you!  We have a guest.” the woman known as Rowena gestured over toward the woman coming closer to the group.<br/>
She was a small woman, dressed in black and purple.  She had short and spiked black hair around her pixie face.  She smirked at the four of them.<br/>
“So you want to change Harry Potter’s fate? You will only be able to do that with my help”<br/>
“An who are you?” asked Rowena<br/>
“Me? I’m Fate, but you can call me Dez.”<br/>
“Why do you suddenly need our help, if you are Fate, why can’t you note help him yourself.” demanded Godric.<br/>
“Harumph, unfortunately too many things are at play now.  I need to change to many things at once.  For my plan, to work, I need to use some of the magic you left in Hogwarts. I also would like you four  watching to make sure they will have all they need.”<br/>
“What exactly do you plan on doing?” asked Rowena<br/>
“I want to grab all the important people for all over the world.  Those that will do the most with the information, gather them together and give them books that show what really has happened and what could happen on the their current path.” explained Dez<br/>
“I have left to many things in the hands of someone whose intentions, while good, have caused more harm than needed.”<br/>
“Dumbledore” sighed the founders<br/>
“Yes, while his intentions are good and he is a good man.  Dumbledore has lost some perspective, forgetting the smaller details that while seem unimportant or worth the cost may not be what they seem.”<br/>
“We agree, he is a powerful wizard and and good man who has good intentions but does not always make the best decisions about how to achieve his goals.  We have watched him do his best with what he can change but does not actively go beyond his realm and worked of Hogwarts.” said Salazar.<br/>
“We are disappointed with what little he has done to change the prejudices and rivalries at Hogwarts during his tenure.”<br/>
“There is not always much he can do” stated Helga<br/>
“He could do more!!” Yelled Godic<br/>
“Yes, he could do more. But that is something that I believe that Dez is looking to fix or change.  To makes sure those who need to know, have all the information they need rather that take actions with only partial or no information.” Rowena said, looking at Dez thoughtfully.<br/>
“Yes, that is the Idea.”<br/>
“Now,where do you plan to get these books?”<br/>
“I hope that Lily and James Potter will help me create them and take them to the place we great for the gathering.  I need their love of their son to create the books and the magic that you have tied to Hogwarts to create a space between the worlds to bring them together.  A place that where they will be safe from time, and from those who would do them harm.  I think that a place like your room of requirement would be ideal.”<br/>
“Are you willing to help me do this?  To hopefully to change the path that the Wizarding world is on, to prevent deaths that may not be necessary.”<br/>
The four founders looked at each other,  each nodding in turn.  Helda turned to Fate and said<br/>
“We will help you of course, we dislike the way the world is going and dislike all the trouble Harry Potter has been through his short life.”<br/>
Dez jumped up and down with excitement “Wonderful!  I will go and discuss this with the potters and will return with them .  Are you also willing to watch over the gathering to make sure nothing goes wrong and that if there is anything needed you can provide?”<br/>
“Of course, as we were discussing, we watch over all of our students as much as possible, and for something like this we will happily make sure that they have everything they need.” agreed Helga<br/>
Good” Dex clapped her hands as she faded into the mists.<br/>
____________________________________________<br/>
A couple is sitting together on a couch.  The woman was crying and the man just holding her.  Lily and James Potter were discussing the life of their son, the one that they died to protect.  The were feeling helpless to watch the trials their son was enduring.<br/>
Dez slowly appears through the mists surrounding them, she looks down at the couple on the couch.<br/>
“I am sorry” she says,<br/>
James and lily look up, startled at being addressed.<br/>
Jame  asks “Why are you apologizing?”<br/>
I am Fate, but you can call me Dez. I am responsible for the fate of Harry Potter's life.<br/>
“ This is your FAULT?! Your fault for my son being sent to my sister!!! To not know that he is loved and his family would do and did anything for him???” yelles Lily.  She gets up and starts to stride back and forth mumbling about all the things that shouldn’t have happened to her son.<br/>
“Like I said I'm sorry,” Dex cried “the only thing that had to happen for him to be the savior of the wizarding world was for you to protect him.  Many of the other things he has endured, while have helped him to become the wonderful Man he is, were not  necessary.  It wasn’t my plan!  But I left too many things up to someone who was supposed to look after his interests.  It has gone far further than I wanted it too” looking chagrined... “but I have a plan to fix it!! I promise. I just need your help!”<br/>
“ You need our help?!  You are Fate, can't you just give him a break, to make things less complicated.  Hell just make so he can spend time with Sirius.  Is that so hard?  That alone would make him so much happier” cried James.  Not wanting to give much to the woman who had caused so much pain in his son’s life.<br/>
“ That is part of what I want to do, I want to get harry to spend more time with his godfather and Remus,  I also want to make sure the war ends so much sooner than it will right now.  To give them all information that will end the war and prevent deaths.  So that Harry ends up  where he should be and can do what he wants with his life without Voldemort standing in the way.  I also want to do something that will make up for some of the thing that have already happened to him.” she said very quickly, hoping that they were not going to keep yelling at her.<br/>
Lily and James just looked at her, breathing hard from anger at  what his woman had done or not done.  Like the Four Founders they asked<br/>
“ What are you going to do”<br/>
“ I am going to get Harry and his friends together with the important people in his life, those he would choose and those he may not like but are needed,  Give them books about his life. The past, the present and and the future, and hope that all the information contained in the books will give them the ability to fix what has happened and to plan for the future.”<br/>
“ What do you need us for, go do that”  James asked<br/>
“ To create the books I need you both to focus on the love you have for your son to pull these books together.  Then I will send them and you to the place the founders ae creating to wait for your son and guests.  I want you to explain what it going on.  The gift that I am giving you and Him to make up for my failure is time.  While he is in the pace reading the books, you will be there too.  You will be able to interact with him and everyone but I cannot send you back to him permanently.  It will just be for the duration of the time that everyone is in the space.  Once the books are read and the plane made.  You will return here, and be able to continue to watch, and Harry will return to his world to finish his destiny.”<br/>
“ We get to spend time with Harry” cried lily, with tears running down her face.  She would do almost anything to be with Harry again.  To be a family, just for a bit.  NO matter how it may hurt to be separated from him again. She looked at James with Pleading eyes.  He looked at her, his eyes wet with pain and sadness, but there was a small spark of hope.<br/>
He turned to Fate “ What do you need us to do?”</p>
