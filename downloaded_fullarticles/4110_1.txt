  <strong>The moment Snape has to raise his wand against McGonagall in Deathly Hallows…and hesitates.</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>Harry shouts at him, telling them the truth, daring him to say otherwise, and he can’t.</strong>
</p><p><strong>Minerva McGonagall steps in front of him, and for Severus, time stops.  Stops as he realises,</strong> ‘<em>My entire life has been leading to now.  Leading to the moment where I raise my wand against a respected Professor for the second time, what she must think, what they all must.</em>’ <strong>He sees Slughorn in the background,</strong> ‘<em>My old head of house, I suppose to him I</em><em>’</em><em>m just another student gone bad.  How many he must have seen go down this path, how many </em>I<em> have seen with the same fate.</em>’ <strong>He focuses on Harry,</strong> ‘<em>I have to protect him.  Save him because I failed to save Lily.  That</em><em>’</em><em>s why this has happened, that</em><em>’</em><em>s why he</em><em>’</em><em>s back and the war has continued.  I betrayed her, I killed her, I killed them all.  This is on me.</em>’ <strong>He looks to McGonagall once more,</strong> ‘<em>My choices have all been leading to this moment.  Where I wish I weren</em><em>’</em><em>t about to raise my wand again.  But I caused this, I must stop it, no matter what it does to me.  This is my penance.  Not my death, but this.  What they all must think of me.  What Lily must.</em>’  <strong>Severus raises his wand,</strong> ‘<em>And they</em><em>’</em><em>re all right.</em>’</p></div>
