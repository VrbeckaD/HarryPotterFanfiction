    <p>Sirius Black was falling. Only minutes ago, he was dueling Death Eaters side by side with his godson Harry James Potter. Then next thing he knew his deranged cousin came out of nowhere and hit him. Now he was falling and falling with tears in his eyes and an emptiness in his heart. <em> Harry my Godson. I’m sorry. Moony, Oh, Moony I’m so sorry you're going to be alone now. The last of the Marauders. </em>This was the thought that kept going through his mind. Then everything went dark as he turned into a dog.</p><p>                Newton Scamander was walking down the road trying to ignore the voice in his head when he saw a big black wolf-like dog fall out of the white light that appeared in the sky. Newt had a smile on his face when he saw the animal. Then he walked closer to it. “You are beautiful,” Newt said as he slowly walked closer to the dog. The animal opened its eyes as it turned into a human form. Newt was amazed. “You’re a,” Newt was cut off by a soft moan from the man. The man had black hair and grey eyes. His eyes were puffy and blood-shot as if he had been crying. His eyes were also haunted. He looked about to be 36 years old, but with his haunted eyes, he looked older. His clothes looked like either he was not from this time period or he was very wealthy. Newt was not sure. “Um, hello,” Newt said in a hushed voice under the night sky. The man looked at him with fear in his eyes as he looked into Newt's discount but kind eyes.</p><p>“You're,” he sighed. “You're going to turn me in arent you? I was being careful,” the man started to ramble for a few minutes before he looked at Newt who had an eyebrow raised.</p><p>“Why, why would I turn you in?” Newt asked confused. The man gave a cocky laugh and tried to sit up but he winced in pain. Newt was by his side and on his knees with his wand out as he checked him over.</p><p>“What year is it?” The man asked after a pause as he closed his eyes. Newt let out a dry laugh.</p><p>“You don’t know what year it is?” Newt asked with panic in his voice. The man nodded weakly. Newt heard him curse himself and muttered.</p><p>“Bloody Veil,” Then he passed out</p><p>                Theseus Scamander was in his study in his house writing his paperwork for the ministry when a frantic knock came on his door. Theseus sighed, got off his chair, and walked out of his study to his front door. Theseus was shocked when he saw his little brother Newton in the doorway. As usual, he was not meeting his eyes. However, he said two simple words that concerned the war hero: “Help me,” Newt walked slowly into his brother’s house. Theseus looked at the young man over his brother’s shoulder.</p><p>“Who is he?” Theseus asked in his demanding voice.</p><p>“I don’t know brother,” Newt said as he looked down at the man on his brother’s couch. Theseus raised an eyebrow.</p><p>“Well, brother he is a wizard so we don’t have to wipe his memory when we heal him,” Theseus said as he waved his wand over the man.</p><p>“He did not have anything that says who he is brother. He looked at me with fear and asked me if I was going to turn him in. I don’t know what he meant Thee,” Newt said while he took off his coat and put his case down on the floor next to where the man layed. Theseus hums and looked at the man who started to stir and shiver as if he was being attacked by a dementor.</p><p>“No, No. I’m innocent, please don’t suck out my soul. Please, I did not kill them. It was Peter, it was Wormtail, please,” the man yelled in his sleep. “Harry!” the man screamed as he bolted up-right and flashed his eyes around. The man stared at the Scamander brothers. He was breathing hard as he saw the worried looks of the brothers.</p><p>“Here you go,” Theseus gave him a glass of water. The man nodded thanks and gave a cheer and drank the water down. “Now, who are you?” Theseus demanded. The man sighed, thought for a moment before he said:</p><p>“Sirius Black and you are? And what’s the bloody year?” Sirius snapped at the brothers. Theseus looked at his brother and sighed.</p><p>“The year is 1927,”</p>
