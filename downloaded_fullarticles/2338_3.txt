<p>Harry and Ron walked down Grange Road. They were looking for Hermione's home.</p>
<p>All she told them was that it was a typical muggle home. Harry had the image of Privet drive.</p>
<p>Ron simply had no idea what it could possibly look like</p>
<p>. They were just walking and hoping Hermione would be outside waiting for them.</p>
<p>Suddenly, they heard screaming down the lane. Harry looked at Ron, “That's our Hermione.”</p>
<p>Ron nodded. The two of them walked down until they got to the house the screaming was in.</p>
<p>Walking up to the door, they heard her yell. “Mummy! Tony's being a bloody arse! He wants to scare my friends away!”</p>
<p>A male voice was heard, “I don't want to scare them away, Hermy. I want to tell them all about the precocious child you were!”</p>
<p>“Try it, You Neanderthal and I will break Jarvis.”</p>
<p>“Mummy! She's threatening Jarvis!!”</p>
<p>“Both of you, quiet down. Tony, no child stories. Hermione, NO threatening Jarvis!”</p>
<p>“Yes, Mummy.” the two echoed. </p>
<p>Ron looked at Harry, “She has siblings?”</p>
<p>Harry shrugged, “Can't be as bad as yours. No offense.”</p>
<p>Ron looked at him, “You got a point there, mate.”</p>
<p>Harry knocked on the door, and the two heard a scream, “They're here!”</p>
<p>They heard two pair of footsteps running toward them. Looking at each other, they had fear in their eyes.</p>
<p>The door opened, and both looked up. They saw a clean shaven guy who bore a slight resemblance to Hermione.</p>
<p>He looked them over, and yelled “Hey Hermy. I think your friends are here.”</p>
<p>Ron raised an eyebrow, “Hermy? We called her that once and she sent stinging hexes for a week!”</p>
<p>The guy grinned, “She hates it. Most of it is my fault. I keep calling her that. I'm Tony, her older and smarter brother.”</p>
<p>SMACK! “You're not smarter than me, idiot.”</p>
<p>Hermione stood behind her brother, arm slowly lowering. Tony rubbed his head, “Damn, girl. You hit hard!”</p>
<p>Ron nodded, “tell me about it.”</p>
<p>Tony looked at them, “Well, come in. No sense standing around here. You still gotta meet Mummy and Dad.”</p>
<p>Harry had not said a word, he had lost his train of thought upon seeing Tony. Ron noticed and whispered, “See someone you like?”</p>
<p>Harry nodded. Ron smirked. Luckily the siblings had their back to them.</p>
<p>They followed Hermione and Tony inside. Harry closed the door behind them, and everyone entered a bright and airy living room.</p>
<p>Harry admired the room and noticed an older couple sitting side by side on a love seat.</p>
<p>Hermione smiled at her friends, “I want you to meet my parents, Amanda and Howard Granger.”</p>
<p>Harry smiled at them, Ron just nodded. Hermione looked at her parents and pointed to Harry, “This is Harry Potter. The redhead is Ronald Weasley.”</p>
<p>Tony pouted at his sister as Harry and Ron greeted their parents.</p>
<p>Hermione muttered, “you introduced yourself at the door.”</p>
<p>Tony muttered, “And you made me look like an idiot.”</p>
<p>Hermione raised an eyebrow at her brother, and saw his eyes wander to Harry. She hid a grin.</p>
