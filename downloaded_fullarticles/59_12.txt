  <em>For this one it was a tumbler conversation, which I have marked with letters for a change of speakerÂ  <br/></em>
</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>K</strong>: How did Sirius become the best friend of Lilly and James? Lily has Snape the Death Eater friend, and Sirius has his little brother, Death Eater, and I want them to talk about it, and James has something to do with it, and I want it to end with Lily teaching Sirius how to drive a motorcycle somehow.</p>
<p>Like, I can't see Remus being a muggleborn, and Peter doesn't seem the kind of person, so how did Sirius get so into motorcycles?</p>
<p>He probably in part did it to anger his family, but that doesn't explain where he got the resources or guidance/knowhow, to one day enchant his own flying motorcycle so well.</p>
<p>So either one of his muggleborn dates taught him, (or possibly halfblood), or Lily did.</p>
<p>And I like the thought of Lily going out with Sirius to help him pick out the right bike, or introducing him to a mechanic, or maybe her one of her parents is the mechanic, and they all work together on the project.</p>
<p>After all, her parents were pretty proud she was a witch, so wouldn't it be cool if Lily did involve them in the magic of her life, in contrast to a lot of other magic muggleborn relationships portrayed (still mad at Hermione for erasing her parents memories, ok)</p>
<p><strong>E</strong>: I'm pretty upset not seeing parents being involved in their magic childrens live as much<br/>: (</p>
<p>I know Colins dad was pretty surprised and bought him a camera for pictures</p>
<p><strong>K</strong>: Also, I think there's a lot of potential things for Sirius and Lily to bond over potentially, particularly if Lily is game to the thought of pissing off pure blood fanatics by helping the heir to the house of Black learn about the muggle world, and blend in.</p>
<p>I remember one fic, where Remus commented that once out of school, it almost looked like Sirius would have to give in and learn to cook, but then he learned about the wonders of takeout from Lily, and that was that.</p>
<p>Just think of all the other things he could have learned from her too.</p>
<p>I mean we have next to no knowledge of Lily's character, so beyond having grades good enough to be head girl, what else could she have been up to?</p>
<p>Maybe James decided to try out a metal concert, hoping to impress her, and while it wasn't something she had tried before, they had fun. They brought Sirius along the second time, and he fell in love with the Genre, and found a way to blast it on the radio at home.</p>
<p>I want to know about Lily, and I feel Sirius and Lily could have been, and should have been good friends.</p>
<p>They both are close to James (though that happened much later for Lily), and Harry, and Sirius wants to piss off his death eaters family, and Lily would be an elegant way to get Sirius into Muggle subjects. Like his cannon motorcycle! I mean, not a lot of wizards go for flying motor vehicles, the only other one I can think of is Arthur and his car, so Sirius must have learned it from somewhere, and had to learn about the parts to enchant it correctly, so that it hasn't broken down in years.</p>
<p>That, or has Hagrid learned to give it maintenance, or Sirius did do maintenance on it in book five for him to be able to use it in 7?</p>
<p><strong>E</strong>: I wanted to think of a little crack moment of Sirius didn't understanding Mr Weasley obsession with a vehicle. ...until he got his own</p>
<p><strong>K</strong>: Sirius and Lily are bizarrely friends once the bullying stopped, and everyone is baffled.</p>
<p>James is pleased, cause clearly he has great taste in friends, but sometimes the nuances of what they get up to baffle him.</p>
<p>Why do they need a flying motorcycle? What's wrong with brooms?</p>
<p>And Sirius insists on his muggle hobbies and clothes having class, so he has tailored clothing, even if it's just jeans, and Lily, you have to help me pick a quality motorcycle, I want one that will last.</p>
<p>And it's exciting, because Lily too wants to work on a good quality motorcycle</p>
<p><strong>E</strong>: Sirius throwing out muggle slang</p>
<p><strong>K</strong>:People think Lily would get along with Lupin, but it's Sirius, who Lily is teaching slang, and enchanting a motorcycle with!</p>
<p>Who was the artist in the Marauders I wonder? Or at least, the one who mapped out and drew the map?</p>
<p>Like, I know they had to explore to get the dimensions, and Peter would have been very helpful at that (he is the smallest, Sirius might have been able to get away with it, but James wandering around as a deer in Hogwarts would have been noticeable, so he must have used the invisibility cloak, and maybe Lupin)</p>
<p><strong>E</strong>: Hnnn good question i wanna say Remus is, but twist Peter? Few things he was good at was drawing but it took mostly Remus and either Sirius or James to find out more of the tricky spells</p>
<p><strong>K</strong>: Peter and James bonded over exploring the castle. Sirius was good at charms, and Remus was good at research.</p>
<p>Peter still explores the castle, when he's pretending to be Ron and Percy's Rat</p>
<p>Peter could draw. He's horribly out of practice from years as a rat</p>
<p>Remus and Sirius did the math, and made sure the dimensions were right</p>
<p>Remus was the one to crack the names problem.</p>
<p>James found all the traps. He was better at Runes than most people thought</p>
<p>*and he knew some good shield spells</p>
<p><strong>E</strong>: Peter roams the hiding places he and James found. Sirius being absurdly good at math makes me grin.</p>
<p>I kinda wanted to know how they made it respond to certain people to be honest<br/>Did they had like pre-written messages in case Snape found it?<br/>What traits did a person need to have to have the map respond back?</p>
<p><strong>K</strong>: I would assume it only responds to people with magic, based on how filched couldn't use it<br/>They probably had some pre-written messages programmed in. Snape, definitely, teachers probably, and maybe they gave hints for the password, that Fred and George eventually decoded.</p>
<p>Or maybe they sent them on a treasure hunt, around Hogwarts, to learn the letters to the phrase they put in hard to find places or something</p>
<p><strong>E</strong>: Haha be very funny too see the twins be so invested in research of Hogwarts</p>
<p>Minerva for a moment thought they actually were being diligent</p>
