    <p>Chapter 1<br/>Harry Potter was waiting expectantly. Any minute now it would pass midnight and it would become his fourteenth birthday. Normally that was nothing to celebrate, not while living with the Dursley’s anyway. But for the past three years now he had finally begun to enjoy his birthdays. Why you may ask? Because of presents. Not because he was greedy or shallow, only caring for material things. But that he had two best friends, two people who cared about him, two friends that remembered he had a birthday and thought to give him something for it.<br/>  It was that very thing that made him excited when his birthday rolled around, after years of feeling disappointed by it. And so he was waiting.<br/>  At exactly 5 minutes past midnight, the owls came swooping down into his room. The first package was from Ron and contained boxes of various kinds of wizard candy. Mood candy that changes flavor based on your mood, flavored air, chocolate frogs, sugar quills and many more delectable treats. Harry opened up a can of flavored air and sprayed some in his mouth, tasting blueberry and then strawberry. <br/>  Next he opened Hermione’s gift. Inside was a set of enchanted quills, that each did different things. For example one changed color as you wrote, another only writes the words of a riddle until someone provides it with the right answer, and another could write secret messages that only you could see. <br/>  Harry grinned as he thought about his best friends and their gifts. But then having expected only two presents, he was surprised to find a third waiting for him with an unfamiliar owl. A letter came with the package so Harry opened it first. It was from Sirius Black, his godfather. <br/>Dear Harry,<br/>  How have you been? I have only just realized it was your birthday, which certainly shows how much a man can lose track of time on the run. I thought long and hard about what to get you. After all fourteen is an important age and I’ve missed out on your other birthdays except one. Your first birthday. I wish I had a photograph to send of you as a baby mashing cake into your face for your first birthday party but sadly all I have is the memory of it. I think you’ll like what I’ve sent you more anyhow. I know it’ll seem a bit daunting at first glance, but I really think if anyone can manage it, you can. Moony told me in a letter all about that full corporeal patronus you casted last year to protect us from the kiss, which I never thanked you for. So thank you. You are turning out to be as talented as Lily and James were. I won’t say what it is, but I hope you can enjoy and make use of the gift I am sending you as much as the firebolt I gave you for Christmas.<br/>From, <br/>Padfoot<br/>P.s. How are those relatives treating you? I only met Petunia and her husband once but they seemed to be a very disagreeable sort. </p><p>Harry laughed at the part about the Dursley’s being disagreeable. He didn’t know the half of it! Curiosity stirring inside of him, Harry gingerly opened the package. At first curiosity turned to confusion when he noticed it was a book, (something Sirius didn’t seem likely to give him), but then confusement turned to excitement and wonder as he read the title. Becoming Animagus: A How To Guide by William Gold. “Wow” Harry breathed in awe as he quickly cracked open the book to the first chapter and began reading.</p>
