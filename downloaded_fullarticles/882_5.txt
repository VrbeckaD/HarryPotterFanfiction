</p><p> </p><p>April 1998</p><p>The sitting room next to the kitchen wasn’t used often. It was small and more of a place for the family to sit before they took their tea in the dining room.</p><p>His body ached.</p><p>The sight of his mother withering on the floor at the end of his father’s wand while Voldemort stood over them laughing maniacally was playing over and over in his mind. He took a deep breath, trying to calm his shaking limbs as he slumped against the wall. Without much thought or effort, he slid down until he was sitting on the floor halfway behind the settee. The room grew dark as the minutes ticked away into hours, but he couldn’t summon the energy to stand. It was then that he noticed an odd noise. At first, he couldn’t place where it was coming from, and he shuddered when he realized it was coming from <em> her </em> prison below. </p><p>He had forgotten about her imprisonment. The terror that had engulfed his home had continued long after Voldemort had returned to find that Potter had escaped. Enduring it until the end was the only thing on his mind. In the darkness, he let his senses focus on the noise - it sounded like scratching. He thought of going down to see what she was doing, but footsteps echoed past his hiding spot and he froze in place. The sound of the scratching didn’t stop and he was too afraid to sneak away.</p><p>After days of punishment from the Dark Lord, the most elite of Death Eaters were summoned to the ballroom. Draco stood next to his father, head held high even if his body was sore from the many torture curses he had endured in a short span of time. She, the Mudblood, was filthy from the dirt floor of the cellar. Her hair was a wild, matted mess framing a very pale face. She looked sick, her lids swollen and the tip of her nose red. When he took in the sight of her hands, his stomach clenched, and he turned his eyes away. </p><p>Her fingers were raw with blood dried on the ends, and the nails were packed with dirt and broken in places. In his mind, he put the scratching sound together with the sight of her and realized she had been trying to dig herself out of her cell. With a cackle of laughter from the front of the room where the Dark Lord stood, the silence was broken, and many others began to laugh too. He brought his attention back to the girl that was being brought forth into their fray, and for a fleeting second, he felt pity for her. </p><p>“Kneel before me, Mudblood.” </p><p>When the Dark Lord made a request, it was not ignored. Draco mentally flinched when she did not do as she was told, and instead managed to stand taller, her form swaying and shaking despite her attempt to keep steady. The curse was upon her and everyone watched, no one shocked by the sight of the girl being tortured. Her screams were hoarse but shrill, and Draco thought he’d never be able to rid those noises from his mind. </p><p>He was taught, and excelled at, showing no emotion, but his mind only put the feelings in tiny boxes and locked them away. He always felt them, and they haunted him. A quick shudder betrayed his body, and his father glanced at him, a pale brow raised in question. Draco ignored the look and let the raised hairs on his arms slowly fade as the curse was broken and her cries died away. </p><p>It was then that the Dark Lord made his speech to his gathered followers. He walked around the group, explaining why they would keep the girl, how useless her blood was, but how important she was to keep alive . . . for now. Stopping in front of Draco he grew quiet. Draco locked his shields tightly together as he felt the Dark Lord slither effortlessly into his mind. He let his master wander freely in the darkest parts of his thoughts; that is all the sadistic bastard cared about anyway - knowing his followers were cruel enough to do what was demanded of them. To save himself from more wrath, he let the vile images of his hatred for the girl on the floor show blatantly. </p><p>Seeming appeased with what he saw, Voldemort retreated and spoke silkily, “Draco, your family has shown me how inept the Malfoy’s can be. However, your loyalty and hospitality are still appreciated. You have endured my displeasure enough for the moment. I feel as though a <em> gift </em> would help to lift your spirits and assist you to overcome how utterly useless you are.” </p><p>The wide smile the Dark Lord gave him was not reassuring, his grey teeth emitting an odour that reminded Draco of Filch’s mop bucket, but he inclined his head in respect. “Thank you, my Lord.”</p><p>“Take the girl, Draco. She is yours. Do as you wish with her, but do not let her out of your sight. If she escapes, I will no longer need the Malfoys.” </p><p>For a moment, a very short second, Draco almost opened his mouth in horror and stomped his foot like the spoiled child he was in his youth, but the glint in Voldemort’s eyes was enough to keep him firmly in line. He dipped his head again, and spoke clearly, “Thank you, my Lord.” </p><p>She was unconscious, her wounded hands bleeding freshly on the rug. The stark contrast of bright red blood spreading lazily over the pure white textile did not go unnoticed by Draco. His heart raced and he wrinkled his nose at the stench of her. He didn't want to help her, but he couldn’t keep her in his sights twenty-four seven in that condition. The thought to keep her broken did enter his mind - it would prevent her from running - but he couldn’t stomach doing it himself.   </p><p>Getting her cleaned up was the pressing moment of concern, then he could decide what to do with her after that. He could lock her in a room somewhere and have the elves feed her every so often, but she was too smart for that. He knew, without a doubt, she would do whatever she could to escape - another mission he was given that was impossible to complete. </p><p>He cast a quick cleaning spell on her hands and face, but it wasn't anywhere near strong enough. Levitating her up the stairs and down the hallway, he set her on the cushy rug next to his large clawfoot tub. After running the water in the bath, the room filling with steam, he knelt down next to her and cast, “<em> Rennervate </em>.”</p><p>Stirring slowly, she groaned as her eyes fluttered open. </p><p>“Granger, get up. You’re disgusting and need a bath.” </p><p>Flinching violently, her eyes shot open and she gasped when her gaze landed on him. He rolled his eyes at her, noticing that her face didn’t resemble fear, but of shock. She sat up and stiffened as she took in her surroundings. “Malfoy,” she croaked, “where am I?” </p><p>He didn’t feel bad for her, but he did pity the sound of her voice. He knew personally that the screams could wear a throat sore. “I’ve been ordered to keep you, never let you out of my sight, but I can’t do so with you looking and smelling like that,” he told her, his hand waving up and down her frame in a show of the problem. His nose wrinkled in disgust as her eyes filled with tears. </p><p>“Take a bath. I’ll get you some tea.” He rose to leave her in peace, grateful for some space to figure out what to do. She was a smart girl and he couldn’t simply lock her away. He needed to make sure that she would adhere to the limits he set. The Imperius Curse was an option, he supposed. If he did take care of her, though, maybe he wouldn’t have to worry about her trying to escape; maybe he wouldn’t have to fear for the lives of his family. If one thing was certain, Voldemort would kill him, his mother, and his father if somehow she escaped. </p><hr/><p>“Granger, you really are abominable at chess, aren’t you?” Draco asked just before he finished the game. “Checkmate.” </p><p>A light sigh echoed across the table, and he looked up to see his companion looking rather bored; he’d notice the look before, she often wore the same expression while he talked of Quidditch. It had been three months since her capture, and Draco had dutifully kept a very close eye on the witch. She was looking much better, having the ability to wash properly and eat plenty. They didn’t talk much though, and she frequently would sit in the window and stare out of it for hours at a time. </p><p>Draco was beginning to get restless. He at least had the ability to put a silent and invisible guard in the form of a house-elf in the room while he took some time away. Granger was essentially locked in his chambers. Sharing quarters was awkward to say the least, miserable at most. He had never had to share anything before. Even at Hogwarts, he was given full liberties by the other Slytherins, but this was different - she was different. </p><p>He attempted to goad her into heated discussions a time or two, but she’d merely scoff at him and lock herself in the loo for an hour or two. He expected them to fight, to hate each other, to be at one another’s throats like they were in school; he at least thought her competitive nature would be awoken with chess. When it hadn’t, he'd become frustrated. It wasn't like he'd asked to be her miserable prison guard. </p><p>Everyone in the house left him to his own defences as if he would somehow catch her dirty blood and spread it to everyone else. Even his parents regarded him coldly, but that was his fault for not keeping Granger locked in the cellar like the previous prisoners. Life over the past two years hadn’t been comfortable, but he was beginning to feel a loneliness that was rooted far deeper than it ever had been before. </p><p>“Get up,” he demanded, as he rose from his chair. </p><p>Her eyes raised to meet his own, and her face remained impassive. A slight twitch of her lips had him wondering if she were biting her tongue from a venom stained retort. Draco rolled his eyes at her lack of response and headed to the door. “Fine, if you want to sit in this room by yourself for who the hell knows how long, so be it.” </p><p>Before his hand had turned the handle, the scraping of the legs of her chair echoed across the floor. “Wait, you’re letting me out?” </p><p>He couldn’t stop the pull of his mouth as he turned and regarded her cooly. “I see that worked. Don’t get your hopes up, Granger, I only need a break from this room. I figured if you don’t try anything stupid, then maybe I’ll show you the library.” </p><p>She was by his side in three quick steps. The bounce of her curls left the scent of vanilla wafting beneath his nose. It was pleasant, and he looked down to note her eyes no longer held the look of boredom and disdain. Instead, they were bright and round, and it seemed like he could almost feel her magic humming. It was cute, he thought, and in absolute horror of the intrusive thought that managed to be released, he gripped his wand tightly and told her, “Seriously, no funny business. I have no problems stunning you and binding you up back in the dungeon.” </p><p>“Don’t be so dramatic, Malfoy,” she said, and at his narrowed eyes, she raised her hand and placed it over her heart. “I promise I’ll be good.”</p><p>As they stepped into the hallway, he suddenly felt edgy. He hoped there weren’t any rogue Death Eaters roaming the hallways. As it was late in the evening, he supposed they wouldn’t linger about, yet, he still had a nervous twitch in his gut. Just like the unwarranted feeling before, he was feeling protective over his prisoner. He would not dare let any of those foul, loathsome bastards hurt her - he didn’t even want one of them looking at her. </p><p>He was overwhelmed with these sudden emotions, and for a moment, he almost pulled her back into the room. Gripping her upper arm in his fingers, he pulled her to him and looked down at her face. His voice was firm, and he hoped it scared her. “This isn’t a joke. There are people here that will enjoy watching you hurt.” </p><p>She winced and looked down at where his grip was biting into her flesh, before looking back in his face - her brown irises were glassy yet her brows knitted together in determination. “Are you one of them, Draco Malfoy?” </p><p>Hearing her say his given name like that had him quickly loosening his grip. He shook his head but didn’t let go and began to lead her down the hallway. “I'm the only one you can trust.” </p><p>“And why would I trust you?” she bit out, her voice dripping in disbelief.</p><p>“Because my life depends on it, and you’re a noble Gryffindor. If you escape, I die. If you die, I die. You, literally, are the only thing that is keeping my miserable, shit-ass life here. Obviously, I’d rather not die, so I’ll do whatever I have to do to keep you safe.” </p><p>The words tumbled from his mouth in a rush, and he didn’t know where they came from. He locked his jaw and clamped his teeth together in an attempt to keep more words from coming out of their own free will. He watched her from the corner of his eye as she surveyed him. He couldn’t quite tell, but she seemed almost resolved by his response. Her body relaxed into his and they walked together easily. She was quiet after his confession, and they made their way to the library, thankfully, without distraction. </p><p>He pushed the door open and began throwing spells and charms up to keep them from being interrupted. She gasped behind him, and he turned sharply, wand held out defensively, on guard for an attack. When nothing immediately came, he swivelled around, double-checking they were alone. </p><p>Finally, he took note of the witch and saw the awe in her features. Her hands were covering her mouth that you could easily see was gaping wide open. Her eyes were wide scanning the shelves closest to her. He laughed lightly, something he hadn’t done in what seemed like forever. The carefree feeling that washed over him was unbridled but not unwelcome. He wasn’t sure how she was able to garner these types of reactions from him, but he quickly realized he didn’t want them to stop. She was a breath of fresh air in the darkness that had turned into his life. Ironically, she was the light in his muddy world. At that moment, he decided, <em>fuck it</em>, if they were going to be trapped together, he wasn’t going to be more miserable than he already was. </p><p>Lowering his wand he approached her and stood close behind her. Leaning down, he whispered in her ear, “Don’t forget to breathe.” </p><p>She turned to him, a watery smile lighting her face in a way that he’d never expected he could give to her. He stiffened, aware that she looked like she was going to hug him. When she turned her back to him as she began pursuing the shelves, he realized he was disappointed that she hadn’t. </p>
