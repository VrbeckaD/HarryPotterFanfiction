    <p>
  <span>At the beginning of the beginning, or</span>
  <span> perhaps even before that</span>
  <span>, Time was born. Time was a restless child, he just couldn't sit still. Then, Once upon a time (sorry), he found a rope. A line if you will, Time’s line. Time, as the curious child he was, gave a tug and watched in awe as the universe transformed around him. </span>
</p><p>Now, time wanted to see more, and he began pulling and Tugging at his line. He witnessed stars being made and burn out, he saw planets and rocks being formed, only for a bigger, better rock to knock them out of his sight. As he looked around, he saw a beautiful star, and there were lots of planets spinning around it.</p><p>It was his favorite star, Time decided, he then named it sun. Time was planning on naming the rocks to, but the only name he could come up with was earth and, let’s face it, that was a boring and unoriginal name. But, he really couldn't come up with something else, so he named the planet third from the sun, Earth.</p><p>As he was pulling at his rope, he decided that he would investigate Earth and on closer inspection, realized that he should have called it ocean instead. It was a beautiful planet full of water. A vast sea with sometimes an island. Deep in said water he saw something, Life. Life was the most beautiful thing Time had ever seen. She was a little girl full of energy that kept throwing minuscule creatures around. As Time kept tugging at his rope those little creations began to move and split to create more of it selves.</p><p>And then he heard a broken sob from behind him. A young boy was sat there. His pale skin clung to his bones and his filthy black hair stuck to his scalp and in his hands he held a minuscule little thing. It never moved again.</p><p>Death cried over the thing, never wanting to cause harm. Only when Life put her hand on his bony shoulder, was he shook out of his stupor. Life took the tears and, with them, created something better, something bigger. Death, looking at her in awe, gave her a hesitating smile and Life smiled back. But, when death went to touch their new creation, the little thing shriveled up and died. Life, not wanting her new friend to become sad once more, quickly created another one, an even better one. And so evolution began.</p><p>Life and Death kept tinkering with their species trough time and Time, when asked, would help. It took the 3 a long time to get something they where happy with, but Life, Death and Time all greatly enjoyed watching the dinosaurs.</p><p>Then, whilst trying to create something new, something that still resembled the dinosaurs but was something else entirely, Life’s hand shot out and she gave the being, a dragon as she called them, a bit extra, Magic. And so, the fourth and final sibling was born. Magic was a kind motherly person with a warm heart. She was also very generous, she loved to give ‘a little extra’ to some of the creatures her big sister created and did so with a lot of them, such as the basilisk, the chimera and the gargoyle. But, it wasn’t meant to be…</p><p>–</p><p>As Time watched out over the rest of the universe he saw something that made his hart stop, a meteor was headed towards earth. He tried to get there fast enough, he really did, but the projectile from space hit home and caused the extinction of the dinosaurs. Luckily, those with magic survived, as well as some others. Death, his sweet little brother, would be inconsolable as he reaped their souls, his great creation. Well, his and Life’s. But, with the great dinosaurs gone, evolution started once more…</p><p>-</p><p>Life and Death watched their new creation with pride, a human they called it. The strange thing about humans is that they are able to think. Because this was such a master piece, Magic decided that she would give only a part of them the gift of magic. And, to be honest, Time was interested how it would turn out. The four watched their wonder children shape civilization, saw them go to war in the names of different gods, in their names. They watched empires rise and fall, sometimes just to rise once more, others stayed dead. They gain names such as Mortes and Chronos, Hectate and Vivian.</p><p>It saddened the four that their wonderful creation caused so much harm, so they sent an avatar to earth, a prophet. They named him Merlin Emrys.</p><p>Time pulled Merlin all over the place, wanting him to be everywhere at once,</p><p>Life gave the wizard multiple creatures wanting him to cross breed them for more species,</p><p>Magic had him create spells and wards for other wizards to use</p><p>And Death asked him to help him reap souls, to give them a safe venture into the afterlife…</p><p>All four pulled their poor puppet from here to there, asking him to help there where they could not reach because mortals wouldn't let them.</p><p>–</p><p>Death watched eagerly as three human brothers came to a river bank. Whilst he did not like his job, humanity had caused a lot of death by the trees and in the forest so he thought it was time to punish some humans once more.</p><p>Imagine his shock when said humans pulled out a wand each and created a bridge that they could easily cross. Now, that wouldn’t do, he decided, his little sister was way to generous. And with all the strength he had he appeared before them. Because he couldn't kill them directly, Death chose the cunning way. He congratulated them for their magic and gave them a gift each.</p><p>The eldest asked for a wand more powerful than any in existence, so, with the help of his dear sister, he gave him one.</p><p>The middle brother asked for a way to return the dead, so he picked up a stone and gave it to him, imbued with powers witch create ghosts, shimmers of a person.</p><p>The youngest was smart and asked for a way to hide from him, so, with great reluctance, he cut of a part of his own invisibility cloak.</p><p>When the tree brothers traveled further, he easily claimed both the eldest and the middle brother. But he did not find the last one until he had grown to a great age. The last of the brothers greeted him as an old friend, instead of an enemy, witch greatly pleased Death, and so, Death escorted Ignotus Peverell to the afterlife himself, chatting away about unimportant things.</p><p> </p>
