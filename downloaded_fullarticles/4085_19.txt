    <p>Chapter One</p><p>The Return</p><p>It was with a heavy heart that Harry packed his trunk up in the dormitory on the night before his return to Privet Drive. He was dreading the Leaving Feast, which was usually a cause for celebration, when the winner of the Inter-House Championship would be announced. He had avoided being in the Great Hall when it was full ever since he had left the hospital wing, preferring to eat when it was nearly empty to avoid the stares of his fellow students.</p><p>When he, Ron, and Hermione entered the Hall, they saw at once that the usual decorations were missing. The Great Hall was normally decorated with the winning House's colors for the Leaving Feast. Tonight, however, there were black drapes on the wall behind the teachers' table. Harry knew instantly that they were there as a mark of respect to Cedric.</p><p>The real Mad-Eye Moody was at the staff table now, his wooden leg and his magical eye back in place. He was extremely twitchy, jumping every time someone spoke to him. Harry couldn't blame him; Moodys fear of attack was bound to have been increased by his ten-month imprisonment in his own trunk. Professor Karkaroff s chair was empty. Harry wondered, as he sat down with the other Gryffindors, where Karkaroff was now, and whether Voldemort had caught up with him.</p><p>Madame Maxime was still there. She was sitting next to Hagrid. They were talking quietly together. Further along the table, sitting next to Professor McGonagall, was Snape. His eyes lingered on Harry for a moment as Harry looked at him. His expression was difficult to read. He looked as sour and unpleasant as ever. Harry continued to watch him, long after Snape had looked away.</p><p>What was it that Snape had done on Dumbledores orders, the night that Voldemort had returned? And why. . . why . . . was Dumbledore so convinced that Snape was truly on their side? He had been their spy, Dumbledore had said so in the Pensieve. Snape had turned spy against Voldemort, "at great personal risk." Was that the job he had taken up again? Had he made contact with the Death Eaters, perhaps? Pretended that he had never really gone over to Dumbledore, that he had been, like Voldemort himself, biding his time?</p><p>Harry's musings were ended by Professor Dumbledore, who stood up at the staff table. The Great Hall, which in any case had been less noisy than it usually was at the Leaving Feast, became very quiet.</p><p>"The end," said Dumbledore, looking around at them all, "of another year."</p><p>He paused, and his eyes fell upon the Hufflepuff table. Theirs had been the most subdued table before he had gotten to his feet, and theirs were still the saddest and palest faces in the Hall.</p><p>"There is much that I would like to say to you all tonight," said Dumbledore, "but I must first acknowledge the loss of a very fine person, who should be sitting here," he gestured toward the Hufflepuffs, "enjoying our feast with us. I would like you all, please, to stand, and raise your glasses, to Cedric Diggory."</p><p>They did it, all of them; the benches scraped as everyone in the Hall stood, and raised their goblets, and echoed, in one loud, low, rumbling voice, "Cedric Diggory."<br/>
Harry caught a glimpse of Cho through the crowd. There were tears pouring silently down her face. He looked down at the table as they all sat down again.</p><p>"Cedric was a person who exemplified many of the qualities that distinguish Hufflepuff house," Dumbledore continued. "He was a good and loyal friend, a hard worker, he valued fair play. His death has affected you all, whether you knew him well or not. I think that you have the right, therefore, to know exactly how it came about."</p><p>Harry raised his head and stared at Dumbledore. "Cedric Diggory was murdered by Lord Voldemort."</p><p>A panicked whisper swept the Great Hall. People were staring at Dumbledore in disbelief, in horror. He looked perfectly calm as he watched them mutter themselves into silence.</p><p>"The Ministry of Magic," Dumbledore continued, "does not wish me to tell you this. It is possible that some of your parents will be horrified that I have done so - either because they will not believe that Lord Voldemort has returned, or because they think I should not tell you so, young as you are. It is my belief, however, that the truth is generally preferable to lies, and that any attempt to pretend that Cedric died as the result of an accident, or some sort of blunder of his own, is an insult to his memory."</p><p>Harry tentatively looked around the Great Hall noticing everyone!s somber eyes, the guilt he felt for Cedric's death a constant reminder that the lunatic who'd killed his parents had returned. He wished more than anything that his parents were here with him now. That Sirius would be given his freedom. But he knew that was too much to ask for. After all he'd been wishing his parents were alive since he was a toddler. Good things didn't happen to him.<br/>

<b> Godric's Hollow</b><br/>
Sirius and Remus had all but been sent home by Albus Dumbledore had all but thrown them out of the school stating a Harry would be fine. They however knew different and were determined to do anything to keep Harry safe even if it meant moving him from the school he loved. Neither of them had no idea why they'd felt drawn to Godric's Hollow that night, but as they made their way across the cemetery toward their best friends graves. What they found however shocked them.</p><p>Sirius saw the first, though he wasn't sure if he were seeing things after all nothing could bring back the dead. Lord knows he'd prayed for it enough when he'd been shut away in Azkaban for twelve years. Then again Voldemort hadn't been resurrected twelve years ago either. That's when it hit him, the rebirth Harry had mentioned the Priori Incantatem which had happened as the brother wands connected. Perhaps this was the result, as he turned to face his husband he knew Moony had come to the same conclusion. Sirius's thoughts were broken by Prongs talking.</p><p>"Padfoo? Moony? Is that you?"</p><p>"How do we know you are who you say you are? Lily and James have been dead for nearly fifteen years."</p><p>"Fifteen years? How's Harry?"</p><p>"Prove your his parents first." Remus stated softly not willing to let himself hope that his two best friends had been brought back to them. To Harry. If it turned out these people were Death Eaters it would devastate Harry.</p><p>James knew his best friends would probably react this way when they saw them after all up until two days ago they had indeed been deceased. He knew this had something to do with what happened in the graveyard with Harry with Harry and Voldemort. He would do anything if it meant he got to hold his son again. And he knew there was only one way that it would happen. Shifting into hid Animagus form in moments and in his place stood a majestic stag.</p><p>"It's really you?" Sirius cried out.</p><p>"It's really us Paddy. Where's Harry? Last we saw him he was escaping the Riddle graveyard. Please tell me my baby boy is safe." Lily cried.</p><p>"He's at Hogwarts for me. But we need to get there quickly. I'm supposed to be outside. And he... he can't go back to Petunia. Not now."</p><p>"He's been living with her. Why? Why wasn't he with you?"</p><p>"Peter betrayed you both Lils. I'm horrified to day I went after him instead of insisting on taking Harry from Hagrid that night. I caught up with him, but he ... he turned into his rat form after chopping off his fingerp, blowing up thirteen Muggles and yelling I was the one to betray you. I escaped Azkaban last year when I realised Peter was hiding as a pet rat to Harry's best friend Ron Weasley."</p><p>"It's not your fault Siri. We'll get you freed. Can we see Harry now?"</p><p>"It would beat if I transformed into Padfoot. harry knows me as Snuffles. Hopefully we can get to Kings Cross before the Dursleys."</p><p>"Let's go."</p><p>Remus and Sirius touched their best friends arms, Sirius being extremely thankful James had turned back into himself again during his explanation. By the look on his face the headmaster was in for a rude awakening when they returned to Grimmauld Place. With a swift twist the Marauders and Lily disaperated arriving at Kings Cross just as the Dursleys entered. Lily growled as she spotted her so called sister and her husband. James wasn't any better, Sirius quickly transformed into Padfoot as the small group approached Harry's torturers.<br/>

<b> Kings Cross</b><br/>
Lily was furious as she spotted her sister and her whale of a husband, she could tell Tuney wanted to be anywhere else but collecting her nephew. If she hadn't thought her son had been mistreated before she was positive of it now. A gentle hand touching her arm pushed the anger to the back of her mind, however she's be damned if she would allow her son to be sent back there Albus would just have to deal with it. Following behind James she couldn't help but feel a little bit of satisfaction at what was about to happen.</p><p>"Hello Tuney."</p><p>"L-Lily. J-James. What are you doing here?"</p><p>"Our son called for us and we were returned to him. The madman who killed us returned. We have been watching you and I'm disappointed you couldn't love my son, if the roles were reversed I wouldn't treat Dudley the way you treated my Harry. Remus has Guardianship papers you're to sign all your rights to Harry back to James and I. Then you'll pay back every penny you received from Albus. Do I make myself clear?"</p><p>"Sooner we get rid of the freak the better. Give me that."</p><p>Remus handed over the Guardianship papers to Vernon Dursley absolutely furious that these people could be so callous. The sooner they got Harry away from them the better. And Albus would have a lot to answer for. Ed always assured them Harry was safe with his relatives. Just what else had the meddling old man been keeping from them. Just as Petunia was finishing up signing over Guardianship Remus heard Harry's voice. He had been hoping to get to Hogwarts before the Express left.</p><p>"Mum? Dad?"</p>
