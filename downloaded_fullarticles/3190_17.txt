    <p>Harry smiled proudly at his crew. All eleven of them were bickering away.</p><p>Ron was arguing with Hermione over the amount of food he ate. Luna was trying to convince Neville that mermaids existed. Seamus and Dean were rowing over the best way to tie a reef knot. Alicia and Katie were yelling at Oliver and Angelina over a comment someone had made in the pub the week before and Oliver and Angelina were yelling back. Ginny, however, was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Harry frowned. It wasn’t like Ginny to miss an argument.</p><p>“Captain!” Ginny shouted over the arguments. She was standing in the doorway that lead to the communications room. “Come and see this!”</p><p>Harry walked across the gently rocking floor of the mess hall to where Ginny had a letter in hand. “What is it?”</p><p>“It came by messenger parrot two minutes ago. It’s from Bill.”</p><p>“What does he say?”</p><p>“Phlegm didn’t show up.” Ginny said, smiling.</p><p>“Don’t call her that.” Harry took the letter and scanned through it. “Send him a parrot saying we’ll do it.”</p><p>“Do we have to?” Ginny groaned.</p><p>“Yes! This is your sister-in-law to be!” Harry emphasised.</p><p>“It’s not like I got to pick her.” Ginny pointed out and sauntered of to the communications room.</p><p>Harry sighed, half from exasperation and half from- no. He had to think of other things. “Hermione!”</p><p>His navigator left her argument and came over. “What was Ginny doing with that letter?”</p><p>“It’s from Bill. Fleur didn’t arrive with her scheduled ship. He’s asked us to go and pick her up.” Harry explained. He didn’t like Fleur enormously, because of the way he had seen her treat the Weasleys and their house boat, but she couldn’t help it that she didn’t fit their way of life very well. Hermione didn’t like Fleur either, and this was evident, as a look of disgust spread across her face.</p><p>“And are we going to?”</p><p>“Yes. We set sail in an hour. Could you-”</p><p>“Plot a course? Yep. Are we taking Bill with us?”</p><p>Harry shook his head. “We’re going to pick her up as fast as we can. Bill doesn’t know why she didn’t arrive, but he knows she never got on the ship.”</p><p>Hermione furrowed her eyebrows. “Is the-”</p><p>Harry shrugged. “Supposedly.”</p><p>“Have fun telling Ron.” Hermione scowled and stalked off to her room, where she would draw a route across a copy of a map from the port the <em>Firebolt </em>was currently at and the port nearest Fleur.</p><p>Harry strode over to the head of the table and slammed his fist onto the wood. “Listen up!”</p><p>The arguments ground to a halt and everyone turned to look at Harry.</p><p>“We’ve got a mission.” Harry announced.</p><p>“But it’s four days until the wedding!” Ron protested.</p><p>“Well, if we don’t pull the mission off, there won’t be a wedding.” Harry said grimly. “We got a letter from Bill. Fleur didn’t arrive on her expected ship. He’s asked us to go and pick her up.”</p><p>The crew stared at him in shock.</p><p>“Fleur didn’t show up?” Ron gasped. “You don’t think she’s- I can’t say it.”</p><p>Harry ran a hand through his hair. “I think Fleur would have said if she’d decided the wedding was off. Besides, she loves Bill.”</p><p>“And you’re sure Bill hasn’t heard anything from her?” Dean checked.</p><p>“Yep.”</p><p>“Where does she live?” Neville asked.</p><p>“I’m not sure.” Harry looked at Ron hopefully, but he stared back blankly.</p><p>“Why are you looking at me?”</p><p>“I thought you’d know where Fleur lives.”</p><p>“No idea. GINNY!” Ron yelled. “She’ll know,” he told Dean as a side note.</p><p>“Ginny’s on watch.” Katie scolded.</p><p>“Oh yeah.”</p><p>Luna perked up. “I think I might know.”</p><p>“How do you know?” Harry wondered.</p><p>“I saw her point to it on a map once. I don’t know what it’s called, but I know where it is.” Luna stood up. “I’ll go and see if Hermione will let me look at a map.”</p><p>“What do we do if she lives on the south coast of France?” Angelina furrowed her eyebrow. “There’s no way we can get there and back in time for the wedding.”</p><p>“We’ll have to try.” Harry said firmly. “We can’t let Bill down and if we fail, it’ll be our fault the wedding isn’t on.”</p><p>“And Mum’ll kill us,” Ron groaned. “We absolutely <em>cannot </em>fail.”</p><p>Luna came skipping back into the mess hall. “It’s alright. She’s on our side of France. St-Jean-de-Monts, on the West coast. Should take a day and a half to two days to get there. Hermione would like to know when we’re leaving.”</p><p>“We’ll leave in half an hour.” Harry decided. “Someone send a parrot to Mrs Weasley and say where we’re going. Dean, have we got enough food to last us?”</p><p>“I’ll go and check.” Dean got up and ran towards his precious galley.</p><p>“We’re going to need new ropes for the fore sail’s halyards.” Alicia said. “Have we got any spare in the hold?”</p><p>“No.” Oliver shook his head. “I was going to get some more while the wedding was on.”</p><p>“We’ll go and get some more now.” Katie said to Alicia and they ran off to the ship builder’s in the port.</p><p>“We’ll ready the sails.” Angelina and Seamus headed for the deck, leaving Harry and Ron alone in the mess hall. Neville and Luna had vanished towards the hold.</p><p>“Will we ever get a normal week off?” Ron asked wearily, resting his head on his hand.</p><p>“I think we’ll probably have to retire first.” Harry dug his hands deep into his pockets. “I’m beginning to sympathise with your mum, and wish that Bill had got engaged to a British girl instead of a French one.”</p><p>“Hey!” Ron protested. “Fleur is absolutely-”</p><p>“Yeah, I know. Come on, we need to help. This ship will not captain or first mate itself, no matter how many potions Hermione pours into the water system.” Harry pulled Ron to his feet and they headed up the ladder to the deck.</p><p>“I bet we could find someone on the black market who’s got a spell for that.” Ron mused.</p><p>“Ron, as much as I would love that too, we agreed no more black market spells unless it’s life or death. You remember how the last one went.” Harry headed for the steering hut and Ron went to help Angelina and Seamus with the sails.</p><p>“How many copies of the map do you want?” Hermione asked briskly without looking up from her map desk in the hut. Her hair hid the map from Harry’s view.</p><p>“As many as you think we’ll need. It won’t take too long to get there.”</p><p>“About that, Harry.” Hermione sat up straight and looked him dead in the eye. “If the weather stays as it is, and I think it probably will, we aren’t going to get Fleur back in time for the wedding.”</p><p>Harry’s heart sank. “That’s not an option. We have to get back in time. We might just have to use some, you know.”</p><p>“Magic.” Hermione sighed. “I think you might be right, but, but Harry, what if Fleur refuses to come back with us?”</p><p>“We’ll deal with that if it happens.” Harry had a glimpse at one of the maps. “Hermione, are you all right?”</p><p>Her hands seemed more ink stained than usual, her eyes were weary and the lines drawn in the maps were pressed so hard they almost ripped thorught the paper. “I’m fine.”</p><p>“No you aren’t.” Harry folded his arms. “I know you better than that. And I know what’s bothering you.”</p><p>“If you know what’s bothering me, then what is it?” Hermione snapped quietly.</p><p>Harry, unperturbed, answered. “Ron.”</p><p>Hermione glared at him. “Harry, that’s not why I’m-”</p><p>“Yes, it is. Stop lying. I’m not blind and I’m not stupid.”</p><p>“But he is.” Hermione grumbled.</p><p>“Hermione!” Harry scolded.</p><p>Hermione gave him a glare and Harry walked out onto deck.</p><p>Luna and Oliver were winding up the anchor and Hedwig, Harry’s parrot, was flying off inland. Ron and Angelina were busy securing the main sail to the mast.</p><p>“Where’s Seamus?” Harry asked.</p><p>“I’m up here!” Seamus shouted from the crow’s nest. “I’m putting the new flag on!”</p><p>“New flag?” Harry was confused. “Why do we have a new one?”</p><p>“The one with the fireball got burned when we had that fight with Greyback. Dean drew a new one and Luna made it.” Seamus finished fastening the flag on and it unfurled in the wind. It was a lightning bolt. He peered over the edge of the crow’s nest to catch a glimpse of Harry’s face and nearly fell out he laughed so hard.</p><p>“Not funny!” Harry shouted and folded his arms crossly. “Put up a Jolly Rodger instead!”</p><p>Seamus groaned but followed the order. “Spoilsport!”</p><p>Dean ran up onto deck. “We’ve got all the food we need.”</p><p>“Good. We’ll have meals at the usual times.”</p><p>Alicia and Katie came running back with arms full of coiled rope. Within minutes, the halyards on the foresail had been replaced and it was strung up, ready to go. Everyone but Dean, who was cooking in his galley, and Hermione, who was still in her hut, assembled on deck and took their places on deck and up the rigging. Ron was standing nest to the rail, waiting for permission to signal one of the dock hands to untie the painter. “Captain? Are we going to leave port or not?”</p><p>“Hang on.” Harry turned to the steering hut. “HERMIONE!”</p><p>Hermione left the hut and handed Harry a map. “South by south east.”</p><p>“Leave the port!” Harry commanded. “We’ve got a wedding to save.”</p><p>“Really? Really?” Ginny looked like she couldn’t believe what she was hearing. “We’ve got a wedding to save? Oh Harry.”</p><p>“It was the best thing I could think of.” Harry walked into the steering hut, which had wall-to-wall windows on all four sides and the ship’s wheel in the middle, in front of Hermione’s map desk, next to a telescope. There was a compass stand on the right of the wheel and a lantern hanging from a rope in the ceiling. “Hermione, get Ginny to come and tell us when she sees France please.”</p><p>“Yes sir.”</p><p>“Don’t call me sir.”</p><p>“Thank goodness.” Hermione began to get up from her chair. “Do you want me to draw up the rota?”</p><p>“Can Oliver do it? If there’s someone else who can do his job,”</p><p>“Yep.”</p><p>Harry was left to steer his ship out of the harbour. He slipped into his usual mind frame when steering: he only looked at the buoys as they tacked into the English Channel and blocked out the sounds of joking from his crew. The wind was blowing at an ideal speed in the perfect direction and he didn’t have to worry about anything. Everything was peaceful and all was right in Harry’s world.</p><p>Then the rain began.</p>
