  <i> July 1975 </i>
</p><p>It's pouring by the time he reaches the Potter's house. His blood, his tears, his sweat is all running together and off his tired body. He can't bring himself to knock at the door, so he stands there, tears starting to swell back up into his eyes. </p><p>He's safe, he thinks, staring at the wooden door. All he has to do is knock, the Potters are good people. James said if he ever needed a place to stay, if he was ever in trouble all he has to do is--</p><p>"Knock god damn it," Sirius mutters to himself. </p><p>He lifts his arm to reach for the door and pain shoots through his side. Images flash of his mother shoving him down the stairs, kicking him. Sirius shuts his eyes and knocks as loud as he can muster. </p><p>He waits, it's late. He probably woke them up, they are very old, he should just go back home, beg for forgiveness, he won't get to eat for a while but at least he won't be a bother and--</p><p>"Sirius?" </p><p>Sirius looks up, he didn't notice the door had opened. Standing in front of him was the nightgown clad Mrs. Potter, a worried look on her face. </p><p>Sirius starts to cry, he can't stop himself, "please help me" he whispers and Mrs. Potter pulls him inside. </p><p>~ </p><p>"He doesn't have anything! He has to stay here! Where would he go!" </p><p>James is so loud. Sirius woke this morning to James downstairs yelling at his parents. Presumably about him, what else could it be about. </p><p>But if he shouldn't be here he wants to know. So he grabbed his little stuffed toy dog and snuck halfway down the stairs so he could hear the whole conversation, it wasn't going too well.</p><p>Mr. Potter's strong and stern voice carried better than James', "We would like nothing more than for him to stay here, James, but he simply can't. We have your cousin coming in a few days we need the guest room--"</p><p>"She's in the exact same situation as he is! How is that fair! He needs us, he needs me. He has to stay here." James lowers his voice, "Please, Father, I'll do anything."</p><p>There's silence then, guilt shoots through Sirius, he stands up to go pack up his bag when Mrs. Potter's voice catches his ear.</p><p>"He has to share your room."</p><p>"Is that all?" James says, disbelievingly.</p><p>"Yes." His mother says. "Youâ€™re right. He needs us."  </p><p>"Thank you thank you thank you" James cries, hopefully hugging his parents tightly. Sirius starts to tear up. </p><p>He makes his way back to the guest bedroom. He'll feel guilty when he's rested more. Right now he needs to go back to sleep before he passes out. </p><p>He's barely back in the bed before he hears the door creak open. He doesn't move, pretends to still be asleep. Whoever it is walks in and shuts the door behind them. </p><p>"I know you're awake, Padfoot." James' voice is soft, comforting. </p><p>Sirius doesn't move, he doesn't say anything, he's not sure he really can. </p><p>"I also know you heard all that so you can stop faking." </p><p>Sirius rolls over so he can see James, "Oh!" He says softly, "Prongs I didn't know you lived here."</p><p>James smiles, "Move the fuck over I'm coming to cuddle."</p><p>Sirius doesn't argue, just pulls the covers back so James, still in his pjs, can lay down next to him in the guest bed.</p><p>It's quiet for a few minutes. The boys just calmly laying next to each other in the morning light. Sirius closes his eyes and starts to drift off. </p><p>"So--" James says and it makes Sirius jump back awake, "Oop- sorry Pads,"</p><p>Sirius blinks, pushes back the adrenaline, "S'fine, whadda want" </p><p>"Do you wanna talk about what happened?"</p><p>Sirius groans and rolls over on to his back, long hair tangling in front of his face, "Do I have to?"</p><p>"Nah, I'll just tell everyone you went head to head with my 6 year old neighbor and she broke three of your ribs and your nose"</p><p>"She was a right bitch." </p><p>James laughs, "Oh and don't forget all the cuts, bruises, and that weird bite on your leg"</p><p>"The bite wasn't from my mum if that's what you're asking. I got into a fight with another dog." Sirius closes his eyes again, Merlin, is that really everything that happened to him.</p><p>"You're gonna have to tell me eventually." James says, matter-of-factly. </p><p>Sirius sits up, hurts himself in the process but glares at James nonetheless, "You know what James, I don't think I have to tell you what happened. She hit me, I ran away, I'm here now. Drop it." </p><p>James sits up too, gently pushes some of Sirius' hair out of his eyes, "You're right, I'm sorry, I don't need details. You're here now it's okay."</p><p>Sirius' resolve crumbles, James is so nice to him, he took him in he fought for him to stay and he just goes and snaps at him. Sirius starts to cry again, "I'm sorry--"</p><p>"Woah woah, it's okay I'm not mad. C'mon get up, we'll move your stuff in to my room and you can go back to sleep it's okay it's okay. You're okay Sirius."</p><p>Sirius sniffles, wipes away his tears with a fist, and gets out of bed to grab his bag. </p><p>James gets up too, waits by the door and watches Sirius pack what little belongings he brought along. All he has to his name are a few clothes, his worn down stuffed pup he's never been without, a couple of books, a couple of pictures, his wand and a pack of cigarettes James pretends he didn't see. </p><p>"Who's this cousin anyway? Is she hot?" Sirius asks jokingly, trying to lighten the mood.</p><p>James opens the door, "First of all gross, second of all her name's Marlene, she's our age, she's from America, and she wants nothing to do with you."</p><p>"Ahhh, you can't speak for her Prongs, American girls love me."</p><p>"You've never met one"</p><p>"So how could they hate me" </p><p>James gently pushes him away, "Listen to me, you can't get hot for my cousin. You're sharing a bed with me for the next few weeks." </p><p>Sirius looks at James and wiggles his eyebrows and James gently pushes him into his room with a laugh. </p><p>It's familiar, posters of quidditch players cover the walls, theres a big bright window next to a big bright bed, on the other end of the room sat a muggle record player, a gift one year from Remus who insisted James and Sirius listen to muggle rock. It's happy, it's safe, Sirius feels some of the stress leave his tired shoulders.  </p><p>James takes the bag out of his arms, "You can go back to sleep now." </p><p>"Thanks." Sirius mutters, crawling into James' bed as James starts unpacking his bag for him. </p><p>"What did you mean she's in the same situation as me?" Sirius asks with a yawn.</p><p>"Huh?" James says, looking up from his dresser.</p><p>Sirius curls up and closes his eyes, "Marlene." He mutters. </p><p>James smiles, "I'll tell you later."</p><p>"Mm'kay" Sirius mutters, drifting off to sleep. </p><p>~</p><p>"I don't understand why I have to fucking be here!"</p><p>"Marlene McKinnon you watch your language!" </p><p>Sirius looks at James with wide eyes and giant suprised smile from their perch at the top of the Potters' staircase where they can eavesdrop without being seen. Marlene and her father had arrived 15 minutes ago and James and Sirius had been promptly sent away so the adults could talk. </p><p>"I don't want to go to this stupid school what gives you the right to make me"</p><p>A man's voice, definitely not American like Marlene's replies, "I can make you because I am your father."</p><p>Marlene scoffs, "Yeah ok you leave for eight years and come back and suddenly you're my father again? Fuck you."</p><p>"I like her" Sirius whispers. </p><p>Marlene continues, voice getting louder, "Why can't I stay home with Matthew! You're not making him go back to school!"</p><p>"Sweetheart," Mrs. Potter pipes up, "Your brother is too old, you have two years left of schooling you can finish. You're behind."</p><p>"And Max and Maggie and Mallory?"</p><p>"Too young." Marlene's father replies. </p><p>Marlene sighs, "How is this allowed."</p><p>"We pulled some strings because we care about you, Marlene." Mr. Potter says, "What you've been through, you deserve a second chance. James will help you get acclimated he loves you."</p><p>"Haven't seen him for eight years either." she snaps, directing it at her father. </p><p>Her father sighs "You are a smart girl Marlene, you will flourish at Hogwarts--" </p><p>Marlene makes a gagging noise, James and Sirius erupt into silent laughter. </p><p>"Go ahead and set your things in the guest room, dear," Mrs. Potter says, "James is listening so he'll show you around"</p><p>James' eyes widen behind his glasses, "HEY" he shouts in response. </p><p>"Thank you for being so kind to me." Marlene says to James' parents before she makes her way to the staircase. Before she reaches the steps she turns around and looks at her father, "Matthew will write me every single week and if you so much as make my little siblings shed a single tear I will end you."  </p><p>"I love you my daughter." Marlene's father says bitterly before Marlene turns to walk up the stairs towards James and Sirius. </p><p>As soon as she sees them sitting there she smiles and runs faster up the stairs to hug James. She nearly knocks him over with the force of it, James laughs. </p><p>"Hey Marnie! Long time no see!"</p><p>Marlene lets go and gives James a good look, "I like the glasses." </p><p>James gently grabs a strand of her hair, "I like the blonde?" </p><p>Marlene beams, "Thank you!" She then turns to Sirius, Long blonde hair falling around her shoulders, "Marlene McKinnon" she says, holding out her hand. </p><p>Sirius takes her hand and kisses it with a smirk, "Sirius Black."</p><p>"Yuck." she replies, taking her hand back and picking up her bag, "So where to, Jimmy?"</p><p>James' cheeks turn bright red, "Oh no you're not--" </p><p>"JIMMY!" Sirius claps his hands together and starts roaring with laughter, "Why didn't that EVER occur to me! Oh my GOD." </p><p>Marlene smiles, "Yeah we all used to call him Jimmy? Not anymore?"</p><p>"Nooooo" James moans, sliding down the wall and sitting with his hands over his face. </p><p>"Jimmy Potter!" Sirius laughs, "How AWFUL."</p><p>James looks up from where he's curled up on the floor, "You've been here a half hour and you've ruined my life, Marlene" </p><p> "It's what I do." she smiles. </p><p>~ </p><p>He dreams about her again. </p><p>He's standing in the Potter's living room, James reading a book on the couch behind him when there's a knock at the door. Sirius makes his way to the door but it's slow. He feels like he's moving through syrup. </p><p>When he reaches for the door knob it's hot, he doesn't care, just wraps his hand around it and twists. The door swings open and standing there is mother. Wicked grin on her face, wand in hand. Sirius' heart starts to race. He tries to scream he tries to run he tries to move he can't. </p><p>"Blood Traitor!" She screams and her hand reaches up to grab Sirius--</p><p>He wakes up screaming, gasping for air. Sitting straight up he looks around the dark room. He's in James' room. James is passed out next to him, arms above his head, mouth hanging open, he's snoring. </p><p>Sirius shuts his eyes and clenches his fists. It was just a dream. She's not here. </p><p>He tries to slow his breathing, tries to do what James told him. In, hold for a while, out. It doesn't help, he needs a drink.</p><p>He climbs out of bed, his legs kind of wobble for a moment, and then he continues on down the stairs towards the Potters' kitchen. There's a light already on in the kitchen, Sirius wonders why, it's 3am, no one should be awake yet. </p><p>He walks in and looks around. Sitting at the table white-knuckling a coffee mug sits Marlene, hair tangled up into a messy bun. Sirius watches her for a moment, she's not asleep. She's shaking. </p><p>He clears his throat, trying not to scare her but it doesn't work, she jumps anyway, looking at Sirius with wide, surprised, brown eyes. They look like James' eyes. </p><p>"What are you doing?" Sirius asks quietly, not moving from where he's stood in the doorway. </p><p>"Drinking tea." She answers like it's the most obvious answer in the world. </p><p>Sirius rolls his eyes and makes his way to the sink to get a glass of water. </p><p>"What are you doing?" Marlene asks while he's filling up his cup. </p><p>Sirius turns around to look at her and takes a drink of water, "Drinking water."</p><p>Marlene doesn't smile, she lets her head fall and looks back into her tea. </p><p>"Can I join you?" Sirius asks. </p><p>"I don't care, man." Marlene sighs without looking up at him. </p><p>They sit there in silence for a while. Marlene just watching her tea, Sirius just watching Marlene carefully. He never did find out from James why she's here, why she's suddenly accepted to Hogwarts.</p><p>"Do you want to talk about something?" Marlene says, and Sirius realizes she's been watching him stare at her, he blushes a little. </p><p>"What are you doing awake so early? Not to knock the early bird, but it's way too early."</p><p>Marlene sighs again, she does that a lot, "I had a nightmare."</p><p>"Me too."</p><p>Marlene tilts her head a little, "'bout what?"</p><p>"Listen, sweetheart, you're cool and all but we're not that close" </p><p>Marlene frowns, "You know I thought we were getting somewhere but you just called me sweetheart, which I don't like, so you can fuck off back to bed." </p><p>"Harsh, to be honest." Sirius says. </p><p>Marlene looks at him expectantly, "Well?"</p><p>"Nah, I'm not leaving yet I have to finish my water."</p><p>Marlene doesn't sigh that time like he expected, she just looks back down into her tea again. </p><p>Great, Sirius pissed her off. James is gonna wake up in the morning and be mad at Sirius because Marlene is mad at him. He's gotta save it. </p><p>Sirius taps the table with his fingers, "So uh..." Marlene looks up, she looks exhausted, "Why are you suddenly here? Why did you get dropped off?"</p><p>Marlene smiles, "Sorry, sweetheart, we're not that close." She stands up and dumps her tea in the sink and walks out of the kitchen. Leaving Sirius kicking himself at the kitchen table. </p><p>"She didn't even drink any of her tea." he mutters to the empty room.</p>
