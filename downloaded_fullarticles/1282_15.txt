    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p>I was raised my whole life to believe in God, in Heaven. I...was not what my parents would have hoped. I did not believe in their book as I got older, however much I desperately tried to cling onto the fading belief in what I had been raised on.</p><p>But I liked to believe there was <i>something</i> out there. Something more, if unexplained.</p><p> I expected, hoped, to live a long life, die, and find peace in whatever came after. I got none of that. </p><p>I died early, for one, not even reaching thirty. It was a stupid death. An unintended casualty in the face of what our world was becoming. </p><p> </p><p>At the end of it all, I found myself in a field of white. Off-white grass and white sky, reaching further onward then I could ever truly comprehend. I wandered for a while, letting my hands skim over the tall, silvery grass. I don’t know how long I traveled, how long I stayed in that place. But it gave me time to mourn, I suppose. I never got to fill any of my dreams, never got to meet my best friend in person. Never dated, never lived alone, never, never, never.</p><p>A lived, and died, and laid to rest in a bed of regrets.</p><p>I suppose I should have seen this coming. I was never going to get my dreams, as simple as they were, anyway. What can I say? Depression was like a nose around my neck, always digging into my skin, sucking away what hope I could muster in my better days, always precariously being held in check by a cocktail of medications. </p><p>But it was over, and now I waited for whatever it was the dead had to endure. I was left with only solitude, for days, weeks, or perhaps only hours, or minutes. I honestly lost myself in my place of white, and time had no more meaning. But in all my wandering, in all my searching, I found nothing. I had walked unendingly, never tired or hungry, just walking as I brushed my hands over the white grass. I did not look back once, just moving forward.</p><p>I do not know why I did it. I do not know what had made me walk for so long without turning, or what changed my mind and made me turn. But I did.</p><p>And so I turned around for the first time and saw a tree. A tree that hadn’t been there before. It stood tall, branches reaching out in every way like the arms of a god to encircle the world. Leaves rustled in a breeze I did not feel, its trunk enormous, like I imagined those giant trees in California would be. It was, down to each rustling leaf and sprouting twig, (<i>shockingly</i>) white. However, within its branches, nestled between those white leaves, were dozens, upon thousands of brilliant red apples.</p><p>I knew the story. Adam and Eve, the Garden of Eden. I knew what happened when you ate of the fruit of the tree. I wandered over, gentle hand touching the roughness of the bark, and sat at the base of the tree. I ignored the fruit as long as I could, biding my time and enjoying the breeze I only now felt, until finally my silence was broken by a voice.</p><p>“Why do you not eat of the fruit?” I, admittedly, startle badly and clamber onto my feet in a rush. There was nothing before me, but just on the other side of the giant trunk was a shining figure of light. There are no defining features, nothing but shimmering, soft light. But I know this person is smiling at me, how I knew, I don’t know. But I knew, and I accepted this as fact.</p><p>“Are you God?” I ask, standing small before the figure. They cock their head, and chuckle. “No, not I.” My breath catches in my throat. “Is there a God?” I ask instead. “Do you believe in God?” They ask of me in return. </p><p>My voice comes out in a whisper. “No.” </p><p>I was raised on faith, it was part of me in the darkest corners of my being. The corners I struggled to overcome, toxic teachings and words still clinging to me even years later.</p><p> The figure grows brighter, and I feel as if a thousand suns have smiled on me. “Why do you not eat of the fruit?” The subject has changed, and I know I will find no more answers from them. I find comfort in what little I have already been given.</p><p> I ponder for a moment, on the question. “I’m afraid.” I say, the truth spilling from my lips softly. </p><p>“Fear not, no snake is here to trick you. Pick one, and live again.” </p><p>I blinked, startled. “Live again? Is this….is this reincarnation or something?” I blurt. They say nothing, only gesture to the tree. I turn my attention to the giant tree before me. I know I can’t reach a single red apple without climbing, but I find that when I focus on one apple, the tree itself lowers the fruit down for me so I may consider it. I search for a long time, before I decide on an apple. I walk around the tree, waiting for a pull on my heart to tell me where to go. It never comes, and I am left alone to chance. They are all perfect, all identical. Finally, I take one, dazzling red in this place of white, and walk back to Them. I hold it in my hands like something precious. “Will I come back here, when I eventually die again?” I ask, still staring at my reflection bouncing off the skin of the red apple. “This is not a place of death, but of rebirth. You suffered in life, and you will suffer again, before you face true death.” I look up. “Why? Why me? Is it like this for everyone?” They shake their head. “No. This both a gift, and a burden to bear. I can not say why you were chosen, but you have been, and all that is left is for you to move forward.” </p><p>There is silence. I roll the apple around in my hands.</p><p>“Will it matter?” I ponder aloud. “Which apple I chose?”</p><p>I can <i>feel</i> their grin. “Eat of the fruit, and be the tool of change.”</p><p>I take a bite, the sweet flesh giving away under my teeth and filling my mouth, and body, to bursting.</p><p>I am encased by blackness.</p><p> </p><p>This time, the blackness is suffocating, and try as I might I can’t move around to my satisfaction. I am trapped, but my mind is soothed by the occasional voices I hear murmuring to me in soft tones. I settle into my new existence, and try to sleep. It is a drastic change from the White Place, and I can’t say that I like it. The only saving grace is the warm feeling in my chest. It starts out as a tickle, an annoying one at that. But it grows, expanding slowly and filling my body with a warmth I couldn’t explain.</p><p>The darkness lasts for eternity, and I try my best to endure. But one day things begin to change, I am moved, shoved from my warm place in the darkness, and I am squeezed all around. It’s honestly terrible, the worst thing I have ever experienced. When I finally find the light, find the air in my lungs again, I cry out, I thrash. I try to see but I find my vision is terrible now, and I am encased in fear. I am passed around, I think, to giants who handle me gently as if I am made of glass. Something comes into my range of vision, and I realise it’s a face. Human in nature, and smiling so wide I fear their face may burst. This man, who holds me, has dark brown hair, and grey eyes. He is clean shaven, with a chiseled jaw. He murmured nonsense to me, saying ‘Ellie’ over and over again. I stop thrashing, if only to listen to him and figure out his looks. I’m handed to a woman next, also dark of hair, with a prettily pointed chin and bright blue eyes. They hold me close, and hover around me.</p><p>It’s about this time that I realize I’m probably a fucking baby again, and ew gross, that horrible experience was <i>childbirth</i>. God, I hope I forget <i>that</i> experience.</p><p>My next realisation is that I remember, I remember everything. My life, my death, the White Place. Well, that wasn’t supposed to happen, was it? What’s the point of reincarnation if you remember who you were the first time? I have questions, and this time there is no ‘Them’ around to answer them.</p><p>And so it goes, time flowing in its unending river, and I am powerless but to flow along with it. I eat (from bottles, thankfully), I sleep, and I roll around in my own filth until my new parents change me. I spend a lot of time sleeping, and when I’m not sleeping, I’m trying to gain control of my body. It doesn’t work very well, much to my frustration. My time passes, trying to gain a grasp of my new world. I discover that I’m now Ellie Croft, only <strike>daughter</strike> of Rick and Laura Croft. I find I was born in 1979, on January 11th, in London, Sutton specifically. </p><p> </p><p>Honestly, I find the whole reincarnation thing to be a bore. I’m in the past, the world is normal, and nothing is interesting. Being dragged to a church every week, much less a <i>Catholic</i> one sucks ASS tho.</p><p>I ‘develop’ fast for a kid, mostly because of boredom? My parents hail me as a tiny genius. I don’t fight them on it, and let them take pride in their only <strike>daughter</strike> kid.</p><p>I’m walking around like a pro by seven months, a bit early but I’m pushing myself as far and hard as my tiny uncoordinated body can go. It stuns my new parents, who brag and show me off to whoever wants to listen. As soon as I can walk, I get started on reading, hunting down whatever books my parents buy and forcing them to read to me whenever possible. It builds up an alibi, and by time I’m twelve months old, I get caught reading on my own, lucky just baby books, mostly because there wasn’t anything else interesting to me in the house. </p><p> </p><p>It’s a Saturday when it happens, both my parents are in the kitchen talking in low voices about something, and eating lunch well they’re at it, and I’m not interested enough to find out what. </p><p>Instead, I toddle away from my designated play area in the living room, and make my way to the bookshelf. On the bottom row is a collection of children’s and baby books, all placed just so my tiny hands could reach them at my pleasure. I figure I have a good half an hour before my parents are done, like usual, and while I have my own food to eat on the floor, I am in the mood for some actual reading. Most of the books are for babies, designed for actual one year olds. But there are a few slightly more complicated books, the one's my father reads to me before bed. </p><p>I shuffle through the books, before finally pulling out one I haven’t been read yet. ‘The Tiger Who Came to Tea’ is the title of the book, and a quick glance on the inside tells me it was written and published in 1968. I shrug, and take my book back to my play area. I settle on the floor, flip the book open, and shove a sliced strawberry into my mouth with my other grubby little hand. I settle into reading the little book, content that I’ll have it done and away before my parents are done with lunch, like always, considering how short the book was. It’s a cute little book, and I finish it in record time, rereading it and taking in all the details of the little pictures. I finish and start to get up and it’s as I’m doing that, that I turn and see my parents standing flabbergasted in the doorway. I stare at them for a moment, before looking to the book in my hands, and back to them. I hide the book behind my back.</p><p>My father opens his mouth first. “Elli baby, did you read that yourself?” He asks, but my mother shakes her head no. “She’s too young, Rick, she was probably just looking at the pictures.” She said. My father pushes on despite that, “Ellie?” he asks again. I gulp, and give a sheepish grin. He kneels before me, reaching around to gently prompt me to reveal the book. I’ve begun talking at this point, in simple sentences that astound my family. I think this is part of why my father is more inclined to believe I’d actually been reading. “It was good?” I try, clutching the book to my chest. “What’s it called Ellie?” he asks. I look away, and mumble it’s name. My father suddenly whoops, and picks me up from the ground in a smooth motion, swinging me around. I drop my book with a squeal. “Daddy!” I cry, but he’s laughing and not paying attention. “She’s a genius Laura! A genius!” My mother only stands in the doorway, watching with tears at the edge of her eyes. I notice that she slips back into the kitchen, well my father’s attention is on pestering me about my ‘new’ reading ability. I try not to think about her lack of affection compared to my joyous father.</p><p>I find myself under more scrutiny after that. My father brags and brags, and sometimes when they host dinner parties the adults ask me to read for them, bringing their own little books to test me. It’s like a party trick for them, and I indulge them because my father always gives me strawberries for my efforts. A cookie would have been more appreciated, but my father insists on fruit to keep me healthy. I don’t complain, remembering how rarely my parents would get strawberries in my past life, despite my love for the red berries.<br/>
I suppose I probably should have hidden my more advanced mind from my parents, been more careful, been a more ‘normal’ baby. But it’s boring, and I find I don’t have the patience for it. So I let them believe I’m a genius, and enjoy the fruit I get out of it all.</p><p> </p><p>Despite my new father finding out I could read on my own, I still found myself in his lap every night, listening as he read from whatever novel we were working on at the time. It was...strange, to say the least. Learning to love these two strangers as my new parents felt like an impossibility at first.</p><p>But ever so slowly, I come around. It starts mostly with my father, who picks me up and swings me around every chance he gets, who quickly picks up on our shared love of classic rock and plays the music for me every morning as he prepared breakfast, singing along in a relatively decent voice. My...Dad is the one who takes primary care of me, from preparing me in the mornings to feeding me, making sure I have a lunch, and dropping me off at an older woman’s home, who clearly runs a daycare, during the day until he gets back around 4pm with Mum. He picks me up every day, save weekends when I don’t have to go anywhere, and always asks about my day. He listens with rapt attention as I explain that little Robert Chapman is an idiot whose only good for being a trash compactor for the tomatoes I refuse to eat, because he colors outside the lines and rips pages in books, and Julia Moor isn’t much better because all she does is cry for her mummy and sleep. He treats me not just like a child, but also like a tiny adult. He listens when I say I’d prefer to wear shorts and t-shirts to the classic dresses, he explains things to me in plain and simple terms, and when my emotions get out of check he gives me space to calm down and ask me what’s wrong. Honestly, he doesn’t feel like the kind of parent one would find in the 1980’s. He’s beyond kind, understanding to a fault, and always eager to bring cheer to those around him. He is an intoxicating personality, and I find I accept him as a father, as a Dad, easier then I thought I would.</p><p>It’s my mother I have a harder time loving. Both of them work as teachers at the local school, but she has to take time off to go to the hospital all the time. She acts like she has to keep me at arm's length, despite the clear love in her eyes when she does deal with me and Dad. At first, I wonder if she ever wanted to be a mom at all, and was just going through the motions. I even expected a divorce.</p><p>Instead she dies when I’m four. Dad tells me it’s cancer, and when I lose my temper (that faint, constant warm feeling in my chest turning hotter and wilder, and I let it, taking comfort in its reflection of myself) about why she didn’t spend more time with us if she knew, he explains that my mum always knew she was going to die, and thought it would be easier for me to handle if she kept some distance. I throw a tantrum, which only stops when one of the windows unexpectedly explodes in the hospital, showering us with glass. The once boiling feeling in my chest is faint now, but lingering under my skin like a predator. I’m confused, but allow my Dad to fuss over me. I forget the window incident easily, and instead focus on trying to ease some of my Dad’s pain by being a good <strike>daughter</strike> for him. He puts up a strong front, but I can hear him cry sometimes, late at night when I can’t sleep. I never say anything, but I think he knows that I can hear him, because the next day I’m always extra attentive.</p><p>And so our lives go on. I put up with my mates at daycare, and later when I’m accepted into Primary school, I put up with my classmates too. I end up acting as some sort of extra adult in the classroom, taking care of those around me as best I can. I break up fights, sooth over crocodile tears, and share food when I can. I finish all of my work with ease, and impress my teachers left and right. It’s a good thing I do, because it grants me favor that I desperately need, because I staunchly refuse to wear the girls uniform. I’m a ‘model student’, and I suppose with so many other tiny hellions, it’s not a fight they want to have with their best student. I feel like it’s a false advantage, having my knowledge and using it in the classroom. I’m offered multiple times to skip into higher years, but I convince my Dad to turn down the offer. I do after all, have a bunch of snot nosed brats to take care of in my year. Besides, the extra snack and nap times are a blessing that the higher years don’t have. I tell him maybe next year, everytime it comes up. </p><p>I never end up skipping a grade.</p><p> </p><p>Growing up feels wrong. Oh being a child is fairly easy, settling into the routine is easy, but it’s the <i>fear</i> of it. Fear of puberty and my body further changing into something I don't want. It’s one of the only ways I rebel. When I’m 7, I make my Dad cut my hair short, feeling defiant and hateful of long locks. </p><p>The ladies at church hate it. They berate my father, scold him from a place of womanly indignation, for “doing that to you’re poor daughter, oh Mrs. Laura would be rolling in her grave to know!”. I admit I get….mad, when they do. Rage bubbles up, stretches out in my chest like a little waking dragon, and <i>oh</i> how I wanted to tear them to pieces. This man was my father, my <i><b>Dad</b></i> whom loves me and smiles softly when I’m excitedly gushing about having the same haircut as him. I breathe in as they nag and yell, as my father stands firm and tries to calm them, and I breathe out the anger, in my minds eye forming my spine into steel. </p><p>“I’d rather look like my Dad, than take fashion advice from <i>any of you</i>.” I loudly interrupt. “You must be HORRIBLE mothers and women-” my father is scooping me up and trying to shush me, already walking away, but I continue scolding them from over his shoulder- “if a haircut, WHICH GROWS BACK AND MAKES A CHILD HAPPY, makes you so mad! You should be more like Jesus, HE would love my hair and you know it!” </p><p>We leave behind scandalized women, their own children, hiding in the background, laughing. Dad never makes us go back. We try other churches, but slowly we stop all together. I see Dad reading suspicious books sometimes, and I know he goes out sometimes and comes back with more to read, often pamphlets and other hand-crafted things, all taken away into the bookshelf in his office. He never presses me on what I wear, and when he gets me clothes he takes me along so I can pick, and never says anything. He trims my hair when he trims his, and calls me his miniature. </p><p>We never talk about it. I don’t confess, and my father doesn’t press. I think he knows, but the knot in my throat and the fear of it stop any words from being said.</p><p>We leave it at that.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>By time I turn 11, the faint warmth in my chest is such a part of my everyday life that I barely notice it anymore. Just, I find it roars to life when my emotions do, but I soothe it as one might soothe a scared animal. I never question what it is, though I wonder. I figure it’s the remains of my reincarnation, and leave it at that. But my world is turned upside down again, one dreary day in February.</p><p>I had left the house early that Saturday morning, with my father’s permission, to go down to the bookstore. I have about five pounds on me, the sum of my savings, and I spend my day browsing the shelves for books for my own personal collection, which I had recently decided to make. I end up purchasing the first two books of my new collection: The Hobbit and The Fellowship of the Ring, with the intent on expanding to the rest of the series later when I had the money. I spend what little money I have left on a milkshake from my favorite diner, where I make pleasant conversation with the teenager behind the counter. I walk home alone, enjoying the sunny day and holding my books close to my chest, before I finally reach the flat my Dad and I live in, heading up and walking into our home without a care in the world. </p><p>“Dad! I’m home!” I call out, taking off my trainers in the entryway. </p><p>“Ellie, can you come into the kitchen?” His voice sounds tired, exhausted. I frown, calling back “Just a second!” as I run into my room to put my books onto my bed, and then I walk into the kitchen to where I’m startled by the sight of an older gentleman sitting at the table enjoying tea with my dad. I blink, clearly not expecting the guest. I look to my dad for instruction. He smiles sadly at me, and my heart sinks in my chest for reasons I don’t know. “Take a seat Ellie, let me get you a cuppa, alright?” I nod, and settle myself down into the nearest chair, trying not to stare at our guest.</p><p>The man, an older gentleman with gray hair held in a small ponytail, dressed in a nice gray suit with a blue tie. He smiles at me, and introduces himself. “Hello Ellie, I’m Professor Angus Cragg, and I have here an invitation for you from my school.” He said, handing over a letter. I take it just as my dad places a cup of tea and a plate of biscuits in front of me.</p><p>I look down at the address of the neat white letter in my hand. </p><p>
  <b>Ms. E. Croft<br/>

</p><p>I blurt out the words before I can think, “Is this a joke?” I say, looking up to my dad with wide eyes. He looks tired, but he shakes his head slowly no. I flip to the next page, and sure enough there’s the list of supplies I’m required to bring. </p><p>“Mr. Cragg here, has been explaining to me a great deal about how magic exists. You’re one of them Ellie, you’re a witch.” I gape at him, and twist around to look at Mr. Cragg again. “Prove it.” He immediately whips out a wand, and to my amazement, my plate of biscuits starts hovering.</p><p>I zone out for a moment, staring at that hovering plate. Hogwarts. The mythical school in Harry Potter, the book I was secretly waiting to be published. (I hated the author, but the books meant something to me once.) This didn’t make sense, this couldn’t be true. I thought my world was normal, was the same as before and I was just living in a different time than before. But no, I was clearly in the world of Harry Potter, I had to be. I faintly remember, back in the White Place, Them telling me to be a tool of change, was this what they meant? Faintly, I heard my name being called, and I snapped out of my daze.</p><p>“Ellie?” My dad was asking, staring at me with concern. The plate lowered back onto the table. I closed my eyes for a moment, breathing, before reaching out to pick up my tea. I took a long sip. “I’m ok. I’m fine. This is fine, everythings ok.” I mutter, much to what looks to be amusement on Mr. Cragg’s face. My dad rubs my back soothingly. “I know this is a lot to take in, trust me, I’m in the same boat as you Ellie.” My dad cracked a smile, and I gulped.</p><p>Then I remembered the warmth in my body, and it was a lightbulb moment. </p><p>“Wait, wait, is THAT what the warm feeling is? Magic?” I blurt out, turning to our guest. He looks at me confused for a moment. “What warm feeling dear?” he asks, frowning. “The warm feeling in my chest. It gets kinda...wild? Sometimes? When I get really emotional. I mostly got it in check though.” I say. Mr. Cragg’s eyes widen, and his mouth drops a little bit. “You can feel it? Your magical core? Astonishing! I’ve never heard of something like this before!” He gets excited, brown eyes twinkling. Then he humbles in the next moment. “Oh my, Mr. Croft, I would advise taking Ms. Ellie here to St. Mungo's as soon as it’s convenient, for a check up. It’s rather unheard of for something like this to happen, at least in my experience, and it may be best to get it check out to see if there’s any damage to her core.” </p><p>Dad blinked, and then nods determinedly. “Of Course, I assume this is a hospital you speak of?” he asks, and Mr. Cragg nods. “Yes, if you two are free today, I can take you. I have the whole day dedicated to introducing you two to the magical world. Why, we could even get her school supplies if you wish it.” He says. Dad nods, “That would be great. Best get it out of the way.” Then he turns to me, as I take another sip from my tea. “Ellie...why didn’t you ever tell me about this?” he asks softly. </p><p>“The warm feeling?” I ask in return.</p><p>“Yes”</p><p>“Oh, well, it’s always been there, for as long as I can remember. It doesn’t hurt or anything, so I figured it was normal.” I explain, shifting around in my seat. “Can I go put my shoes on, if we’re going to some hospital?” I ask. Dad nods, waving me off. I finish my tea in one big gulp, and grab the biscuits from the plate, shoving one into my mouth as I rush off back to the door.</p><p>My head is reeling, as I eat my biscuits and slip my trainers back on. Harry Potter...the wizarding world. I’m a muggleborn, and I get to go to Hogwarts.Then I get filled with dread, I have to go to Hogwarts. There’s going to be a war, people are going to die in the future. I might die, in the future. Cedric, Sirius, Lupin and Tonks, Fred...all casualties of the war that tugged at our hearts back when it happened in my last life, back when it was but words on paper and actors on a screen. How could I be expected to do anything about it? What was I going to do? Dumbledore probably wouldn’t want me messing around with his plans and his savior for the wizarding world. Wasn’t this a bitch? I sigh, shoving the last biscuit into my mouth. I suppose I should do something, but I’m not smart enough to know what to do. I suppose I’ll figure something out, but that can wait. There are errands to run. I get up, just as Dad and Mr. Cragg walk into the room, and a question pops into my head. </p><p>“Mr. Cragg?”</p><p>“Yes, Ms. Ellie?”</p><p>“What subject do you teach?”</p><p>“Well, I’m a halfblood. My mother was a witch and my father a muggle, which is a non magical person like your father. Anyway, because of this, I’ve always been interested in bringing both cultures together! I’m the Muggle Studies teacher, starting this upcoming year in fact, it’s a third year elective.” He explained, pride evident.</p><p>I nod thoughtfully. That would explain why I didn’t remember his name. I didn’t exactly have all the teacher’s names memorized. “Well, how are we gonna get there?”</p><p>Mr. Cragg smiled, “Why, by car of course!” He grinned. “St. Mungo’s is located in Central London, in an abandoned muggle building. Should be a breeze to get there. We could apparate, but I’m afraid not only is side-along limited to two people, but muggles like your father can’t. That and it’s generally rather unpleasant until you get used to it.” He explained. After that, we all climbed into Dad’s white Mini and took off for London, after a brief stop at the bank were Dad withdrew everything in my trust fund at Mr. Cragg’s insistence. It was an interesting ride, with Dad and I asking Mr. Cragg all sorts of questions about Hogwarts and the wizarding world. We learned of the classes I would be taking, of currency and the Goblins, and all about Diagon Alley. We also learned of the general distaste in the magical world for muggles, which was something Mr. Cragg was going to try to work out of his students. Dad wasn’t too pleased with everything we learned, but he seemed to be taking everything very well. </p><p>“What kinds of jobs were there in the Magical World?” I asked from the backseat. </p><p>“Well, there are all sorts of things. Working in magical shops or in the Ministry as an official. Auror’s are our version of police. If you’re good enough, there’s being a Quidditch player for any number of teams. Potions masters, Curse breakers, Healers, Dragon keepers, even being a teacher like me!” He smiled over his shoulder.</p><p>“What about in the animal field?” I asked, because animals. Obviously.</p><p>“Hmm…Well, I already mentioned Dragon keepers, but they’re also Magizoologist, who study magical creatures.” He mentioned. </p><p>“What about work like a non-magical vet?” I pressed. Dad chuckled from his place in the drivers seat, well aware of my constant desire to do anything related to animals. Mr, Cragg nodded thoughtfully. </p><p>“Already have an idea of what you want to be, hmm?” I shrugged. “Well,” he said, “I suppose the you could become a MagiKeep.” I blinked, cocking my head to the side. “MagiKeep?” Mr. Cragg nodded. “A Magical Keeper, think of them like a zookeeper. Sometimes, Magizoologists run into hurt or orphaned creatures, or particularly aggressive beasts. These animals are then collected and taken to ‘The Hub of Beasts and Magical Creatures’, or just ‘The Hub’ for short. It’s Magical Britian’s only ‘zoo’ so to speak. They’re taken care of, and are researched in captivity by less adventurous Magizoologists. Quite a fun place, actually.” He said, and I nodded happily. </p><p>I wanted a plan, a goal for this magical world. In my last, I hadn’t known what I wanted to be for a long time, and it caused me grief. This time, I wouldn’t make that mistake. A MagiKeep sounded cool, and it would allow me to be around animals, well, magical animals, as much as I wanted. Sounded like something to investigate at least.  “What do you have to do to become a MagiKeep?” I asked, but Mr. Cragg’s sheepish look told me before he even spoke that he didn’t know.</p><p>“I’m afraid I don’t quite know. I’ve always been more passionate about culture, myself.” He said. Before looking forward, and turning to my dad. “Right up here, Mr. Croft.” He said. It took a few minutes to find a parking spot, but then we all clambered out of the Mini and onto the sidewalk. Mr. Cragg handed my dad a ring, which I noted resized itself on his finger. “So you’ll be able to enter.” Was all Mr, Cragg said about the ring.</p><p>We ended up walking to a department store, red bricked and under renovations. The name said ‘Purge and Dowse, Ltd’. Wasn’t a very pretty name, now was it. Well I was making faces to myself, Mr. Cragg had apparently made small talk with one of the mannequins. Next thing I knew, we were walking through a window into St. Mungo’s. I gaped like a fish out of water. It looked like a regular hospital, all white and clean, except instead of nurses outfits, the wandering staff had on green robes. Personally, I didn’t really see the appeal of robes, when casual clothes were so much more appealing. Mr. Cragg lead us up to the reception desk, were a young woman sat working. She was blonde and green eyed, and her nameplate read ‘Cloreece Hapgen’. When we reached her desk, she looked up and smiled at us. “Welcome to St. Mungo’s, how can I help you?”</p><p>“This young lady here needs her magical core checked, please.” Mr. Cragg said. The woman, Cloreece, nodded. “Name and date of birth please.” This time it was dad who spoke up. “Ellie Croft, Janurary 11th, 1979.” He said. The woman wrote it down on some paperwork, and, as if to start up casual conversation, asked: “Ah, starting Hogwarts soon then?” </p><p>“Yes ‘mam.” I said, cheerfully, bouncing on my heels. Dad looked down fondly at me, though he still looked tired. I returned his smile, and knew we’d be having a long chat when we got home. </p><p>After being redirected to the waiting room, we all settled into chairs to await a healer. It didn’t take long before another woman, in green robes and hat, collected us and brought us all into a room. </p><p>“Now, what seems to be the problem?” She asked. </p><p>After briefly looking at each other, Dad motioned for Mr. Cragg to speak. “Ms. Ellie here described a warm sensation in her chest, that acted up when she got upset and whatnot. I was afraid it was something with her core?”</p><p>“Hmm...most strange. Alright, Ms. Ellie is it? Well, stand up right here, yes that’s good, now hold still.” With that, she waved her wand at me and I shivered, a distinctly different type of warmth invading her, poking and prodding at her own warmth before retreating. It was a rather unpleasant feeling.</p><p>“Well, structurally her core seems fine. Average size for her age, by the way. Most intriguing, though, as it seems her core is rather sensitive. You say you feel a warmth, dear?” She asked, looking me up and down.</p><p>“Yeah, it’s warm. Sometimes I think it’s like an finicky animal in my chest, acting up when I do. Does that make sense?” I ask, looking up at her helplessly. The witch nodded, and made a few notes at her desk. </p><p>“My best guess then, dearies, is that Ms. Ellie here is rather sensitive to magic. It’s not common, but occasionally children will come in for reasons such as this. Nothing to worry about, nothing at all.” She smiled. While there I had to drink a couple nasty potions, and let me say, I much preferred shots when it came to getting vaccinated. When it was done the nurse smiled again and quickly ushered us out, repeatedly assuring us that my core was no matter to be worried over. After that, we exited St. Mungo’s and got back into the Mini. Giving Dad a new address, this time for ‘The Leaky Cauldron’, we were off. </p><p>It didn’t take long for us to reach our destination. We walked in, and towards the back where Mr. Cragg taught me the combination to get in, and next thing we knew, we were entering Gringotts. I looked around in awe, taking in the large white building. It seemed like there were hundreds of Goblin tellers, lined up and taking customers. Mr. Cragg led us down the aisle til we reached an open teller, where he allowed Dad to take over. </p><p>“Just like opening an account in the muggle world.” He had said, right before allowing Dad to take control for the first time since entering the Wizarding world.</p><p>Dad walked up to the teller, me easily on his heels. “Hello!” He greeted cheerfully, though I could tell from the angle of his smile that he was working hard at appearing cheerful. “I’d like to open an account for my child.” He told the goblin, Sharppoint, from the nameplate. The Goblin scowled. </p><p>“Very well! I will need a drop of your child’s blood. Name?” He asked, as he pulled out a contract and a quill. Dad had paled at the request for my blood, so I stepped up to help. “Ellie Croft.” I didnt like the way it tasted on my tongue sometimes….today was one of those days. “E-l-l-i-e C-r-o-f-t.” I said, standing on my tiptoes to get a good look. He had long, boney fingers and a bald domed head. Pointed ears and wrinkly, grey skin. He was dressed impeccably though, in a white shirt and black vest, with a small black cloak over his shoulders. “Hand.” He requested, grumpily, holding out his own without looking up from his paperwork. Gathering my courage, an easy task due to Dad’s gentle hand landing on my back for support, I held out my hand and placed it in the long fingers of the Goblin. His grip became hard, holding my hand over the paper, before he took out a long, sharply pointed quill. Grasping my fingers tightly, he pressed the sharp quill into my pointed, and pressed down sharply, cutting across my finger. I flinched, and watched as a drop of blood fell down onto the paper, which resulted in some shimmering paper much to Dad and my amazement. Well we were staring at the paper, Sharppoint had bandaged my hand up in a flash, and released my hand. I pulled it back quickly, resisting the childish urge to ‘kiss’ it better. </p><p>“Alright, how much will you be depositing today?” This was Dad’s cue, who took out his bank envelope, and much to my surprise, handed over five hundred pounds. I gaped. “Dad! That’s too much!” I whispered furiously. Money was often tight for us, and I couldn’t imagine Dad giving up that much money for me in this new bank. </p><p>He looked down at me, eyes soft. “I’ve been saving that since you were a baby. It’s been yours your whole life, just waiting for you to be old enough to claim it. I didn’t think we’d be needing it this soon, but I’m afraid we’ll be living in different worlds now. And it will be used to purchase school supplies.” He explained gently. I flushed, looking away. Dad ruffled my short boyish hair, and we left it at that. </p><p>Sharppoint coughed, and we both looked up and focused our attention on him. “Your balance comes out to 165 Galleons, 15 Sickles, and 20 Knuts. Would you like to take any of it out today?” He asked. This is where Mr. Cragg came back in. “Yes, 65 Galleons.” He piped up. Looking at Dad, he nodded. “You’ll need it for shopping.”  He explained. </p><p>“Can I have the sickles and knuts too?” I asked. “That way it’ll be an even hundred in the bank, and I can buy extra books not on the list!” I explain, looking at Dad pleadingly. His grey eyes meet my grey eyes, and he sighed dramatically. “Alright. 65 galleons and the change, please.” He told the banker. </p><p>Sharppoint nodded. He left for a moment, but came back with a pouch. “First time account openers get a complimentary Moleskin pouch. It’s got anti-theft goblin charms in it, and it’s expandable on the inside. I would suggest not losing it, as it costs 5 galleons to replace.” He handed the pouch over to dad. “Your vault is number 1117. Here is your key.” He handed dad a large, gold colored key next. “Lose it, and you’ll need to shed blood for the test to get another.” The goblin gave a wicked grin, as if to hone the point in.</p><p>Dad attached the pouch to his belt, and shoved the key away into his pocket. We left after that, going on our shopping trip.</p><p>The first stop was to pick up a trunk. We followed Mr. Cragg to ‘Ambles Trunks’, and when shifted through the second hand trunks, we came across a nice, black trunk in good condition with brass fastenings. It looked nice, without wear and tear. We purchased it for 3 galleons, and Mr. Cragg shrunk it down for us. Then it was off, to the rest of our shopping.</p><p>We got the standard 3 robes, and 5 sets of under-robe uniforms. When asked about ties, Madam Malkin explained that each year she set a stock of ties to the school, to be distributed to new students once they discovered their houses. I rather disliked the pointed hat, and luckily it was optional, so we passed on it.<br/>
Then it was to the shops to get a cauldron, scales, phials, and a telescope. We even picked up a personal supply of potions ingredients, for independent brewing practice, at Mr. Cragg’s advice. The bookstore was my favorite shop. </p><p>As Dad and Mr. Cragg gathered my school books, I wandered around the cheap paperback section, looking for books to add to my new collection. I grab ‘Hairy Snout, Human Heart’ by an Anonymous Werewolf for 4 sickles, and turn my attention to the muggle book section. I find that the books in this section are a bit cheaper. I don’t question it, and grab the other two books in the Fellowship of the Ring series. I also find Ender’s Game, and Speaker of the Dead, two books from my favorite series (horrible author aside) in my last life. I grin, happy to have them back. It won’t be for a while until the next two books come out. Making a quick count in my head, I come out to 12 sickles and 6 knuts for the purchase of my books. I decide to cut it off there, and trot off to find Dad and Mr. Cragg. When I find them, they are looking over some books in the culture section. Looking closely, I can see my school books in their basket. I wander over, just as Mr. Cragg hands Dad a book on being a muggle parent in the wizarding world, which I can deduce from the title ‘Muggle Parenting in A Magical World’. </p><p>“I’m done Dad!” I say, as I step in beside him. He looks down, ruffling my hair. “Whatcha get, kiddo?”</p><p>“I found a book about a real-life werewolf! Aaand there was muggle section, for cheaper than the bookstore in Sutton, so I got the rest of Tolkien's books, and these cool sci-fi books, which is surprising, because apparently the authors American! Which isn’t bad, but really I’m excited to read them.” I babble, holding my books in one hand and gesturing with the other. Dad laughs, holding up his book. </p><p>“I get a fun new parenting book!” He says, and I snort. </p><p>“Like you need to know how to parent, you’re already pretty great.” I say, elbowing him gently. </p><p>“Well, never hurts to try to be better, now does it?” He says, and with that, it’s off to the counter to pay. The school books cost the most, each at least a galleon. When it’s totaled, it comes out to 15 galleons, 12 sickles, and 6 knuts. Mr. Cragg, as he’s done for all our purchases, shrinks them and places them in the bag he’s brought along.</p><p>“Wand then?” Mr. Cragg asks. </p><p>“How about a cat first?” I wiggle my eyebrows. Dad snorts this time. </p><p>“Ellie, I don’t know about that. Especially not in your first year. A cat is a lot of responsibility, and so many things will be changing for you.”</p><p>“True! But what’s a witch without a familiar?!” I complain, as we walk back out onto the street. “Black cats are traditional!” I cry. I turn to Mr. Cragg. “Right? Back me up here.” </p><p>Mr. Cragg looks amused. “Actually, it’s more common for students to get Owls. Much more useful, sending letters and whatnot.” I groan. </p><p>Dad looks thoughtful for a moment. “Owls for letters?” He asks, confused. Mr. Cragg nods.</p><p>“Absolutely. Been used for generations to send letters. Owls are both smart and magical, and most wizarding families have one. Faster than muggle mail, and owls can find anyone, even if only given a name. In fact, it will probably be the only way for the two of you to communicate during the school year. Of Course, the school provides owls for students use, however this is only for the school year but if you wish to send your friends letters during the summer, you’ll be out of luck. They’re also extremely easy to care for. Well food can be provided, most families let their owls hunt for themselves. Just open the window for them, give them a perch and water bowl, and you’re good.” Dad looks delighted with this new information. I am less than pleased, as I was quite set on a cat. Sure, I was a dog person, but cats were great too.</p><p>“This sounds like a sales pitch.” I complain, kicking the ground as we reach Ollivanders. I stop, breathing heavily as I stare at the shop. I was getting a wand, and finally was I going to know what kind of wand it was going to be. Back in my last life, everyone wanted to know their Hogwarts house, and well I did so as well, I also desperately wanted to know my wand and what it meant, the meaning behind it’s unique construction. I always wanted to know what it said about me.</p><p>Mr. Cragg stepped back, gesturing for Dad and I to go in. “Go on now, this is a family type of moment. I’ll wait out here. Don’t be surprised if a few things blow up, happens all the time.” He said. </p><p>Dad, predictably, looked a tad bit mortified. I grabbed his hand with my own, and pulled him along into the store.</p><p>Ollivanders was filled with small boxes, stacked one upon another, high up to the ceiling, in a rather precarious fashion. The room was casting long shadows, caused by the yellow lights. All in all, it was rather intimidating. An old man came out from the backroom only moments after the bell had rung, signaling our entrance.</p><p>Ollivander had wild, white hair, which stood up at all angles like he’d been electrocuted. He dressed neatly, in long black robes with a red vest and a cravat. </p><p>“Now now, two unfamiliar faces in my shop? Always a pleasure, to be sure, to see new families brought into our world. Your name?” The man greeted, a twinkle in his eye. </p><p>“Ellie Croft, and this is my dad, Rick.” I say, squeezing my dad’s hand tighter one more time before letting go and stepping forward.</p><p>“A good name, one I won’t forget. Now! Onto business shall we? Which is your wand hand?” He asked, walking over to a stack of boxes. “Right, sir.” He debated over two boxed, before putting them both back and pulling out a third box, and bringing it over. “Try this, Redwood with a dragon heartstring, 10 inches and quite rigid!” He said, as he pulled the wand out of the box. It was a pleasant reddish brown color, with a slightly darker handle. I reached out, and took the wand from him. Immediately I felt cold seep into my palm, tingling away as it reached for my magic. It wasn’t a pleasant feeling, and well I would have bet money on it not working properly, I gave it a wave anyway. </p><p>The box in Ollivander’s hand burst into flames. He didn’t seem even the slightest bit fazed as he dropped the box and pulled out his own wand, to put out the fire. </p><p>“No no, no good.” He said, ripping the wand from my hand and placing it on the counter as he wandered around his shop. “I have a feeling, Ms. Croft, that you’ll be a tricky customer.” With that, he started collecting boxes, gathering around six or seven before returning. One by one, wands went into my hand, each feeling different in my palm, and one by one each wand caused havoc in Ollivanders shop. </p><p>He looked positively gleeful, plucking the latest wand, Vine and Phoenix feather, from my hand. Slipping into one of the rows, Ollivander climbed onto one of the ladders in his shop, and plucked a black box from the tippy top of one of the stacks.</p><p>He came back rather confident. I would guess with each failed attempt he gained more insight into the witch or wizard. Opening the box, he pulled out a whitish wand, handing it over rather gently.</p><p>Immediately I knew this was my wand. It tingles in my hand, my magic rushing up through my arm to connect with the heavy feeling magic seeping from the wand. It felt amazing in my hand, the mixing magic swirling through my body as if it were dancing. I waved it, feeling the magic pour out of me for the first time, which immediately formed into shimmering grey sparkles. I was in awe.</p><p>Ollivander looked positively smug. “I knew it! This wand has chosen you, Ms. Croft. Alder wood, with unicorn hair. 12 inches, and quite bendy! Most curious in fact, that this wand should have chosen you.”</p><p>Still on a high from being chosen by my new wand, I didn’t worry when Ollivander called it curious. Dad however, was interested in finding out what was so curious about my new wand.</p><p>“And why is that, Mr. Ollivander?” He asked, his hand coming down onto my shoulder and squeezing gently.</p><p>“Why, the Unicorn that gave the hair for that wand was most peculiar indeed. The creature was on the brink of death, and in fact passed away right before my eyes. Only, after a few moments it came back to life, renewed and most willing to part with a single hair. Most curious indeed.” </p><p>I felt dread wash over me, as I gaped first at Ollivander and then at my new wand. The connection was obvious, and from the look in Ollivanders eyes I would almost guess that he knew something now, about me and my reincarnation. But he said nothing, and moved onto matters of payment with Dad, who agreed to also purchase a wand serving kit and a holster. I held onto my wand tightly, becoming familiar with the new feeling of my magic. It felt stronger now, and it was easier to sooth and reign in.</p><p>Putting on my new holster, I tucked my wand away, and walked back out onto the street with Dad, back to Mr. Cragg who had been patiently waiting for us. He smiled happily at me. “Well?” He asked. </p><p>With a flourish, I pulled my wand out and showed it to him, the light colored wood gleaming in the sunlight. “Alder and unicorn hair!” I declared for him, grinning. He clapped politely. He pulled out his wand, soft brown in color with a slightly darker handle. “Hornbeam and Phoenix feather!” He stated proudly. We shared grins.</p><p>After that, we all went back to The Leaky Cauldron, as it was getting later on in the evening and we were all quite hungry. Dad and Mr. Cragg both got Lamb and Pea pie, well I got a Steak pie. Together we had an enjoyable dinner, before we all headed back to our flat, where Mr. Cragg enlarged all our purchases, and kindly helped me pack everything away neatly.</p><p>“Now, we do still need a written letter stating intent to attend, which I will take back for you.” Mr. Cragg told us when we were all done. Dad nodded, and retrieved some of the nice paper and his favorite pen from his office.</p><p>I had a knot in my throat.</p><p>“Wait….can...Dad can I talk to you?” Time stilled, Dad put down his pen and looked at me. I followed him back into his office.</p><p>“Whatcha need, kiddo?” He asked, sitting down with me. </p><p>I tried to say it, I did, but words caught in my throat and instead I let myself be wrapped in my fathers arms.  He made small soothing noises, and waited patiently for me despite the guest we still had in the other room.</p><p>“I don’t wanna be Ellie at school.” I mumbled.</p><p>“Yeah?” Was all Dad responded with. </p><p>“Yeah.” I couldn't stop the tears, I really couldn’t. I cried into his shoulder, shaking, and he just held me tighter.</p><p>“It’s ok, it’s ok, I know.” Dad soothed. “It’s ok,  I know, I know, I’m not mad, it’s ok kiddo.”</p><p> </p><p>By time we came out, my eyes were red but dry, I was feeling lighter than ever and holding Dad’s hand tightly. I wrote a letter, and Dad wrote two of his own. </p><p>After that, it was time for our goodbyes.</p><p>“It’s been pleasant, Rick, El. Now remember, you can get a head start on reading, but you can’t mess with your wand or potions. You mustn't tell anyone about this, alright?” He said, looking straight at me. I gave him a playful salute. </p><p>With that, Mr. Cragg left our flat and disappeared. He had left with 3 letters. My acceptance letter  among them was sent signed in my name.</p><p>Ellias Laurence Croft</p><p>And with that, my introduction to the wizarding world was complete.</p>
