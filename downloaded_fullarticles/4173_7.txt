    <p>Two Harry Potters were in a disagreement of all disagreements. As the thunder clapped in the distance and as the lightning flashed, you could see the silhouettes of the two Potters. One was in his Gryffindor Quidditch Robes, broom in hand – his eyes tore away from the other Potter boy (just to tell these apart, lets name him Harry) to glance around just behind Harry’s head, searching the for the golden walnut that was the Snitch. But, after a moment, Potter’s eyes returned to Harry’s gaze of pure hatred. Harry was in his regular School Robes, wand in hand, ready to use any curse that came to his head at any moment. As he glared at Potter, he thought to use the Cruciatus Curse on this other Harry Potter. Even though they were both much older, they both looked eleven years of age.</p><p>“You’re WRONG!” Harry said, taking a swift step forward, sending Potter one step backwards, closer to the edge of the Astrology Tower.</p><p>“But I’m sure I’m –” Potter started, now entirely focused on Harry and not on his quest for the snitch.</p><p>“NO! Don’t even say anything – you fool!” he shouted, raising his wand. Potter flinched in fear, as if he knew of Harry’s plans. “FIGHT! FIGHT! I COMMAND YOU!” Harry screamed, making a quick change of plans. “<em>IMPERIO!”</em> he shouted, pointing his wand at his twin. Potter raised his broom above his head, about to bash Harry’s head in with it. “FIGHT!!!” Harry shouted again, and with a swift move of his wand, the broom came down. Lower and lower, closer and closer to Harry’s head, until –</p><p>“STOP!” There was a voice, and Harry’s focus on the curse was lost, and Potter stood motionless, his broom about a foot from Harry’s head. They both looked to the source of the voice – towards the door. There was a man with a fairly large nose and black hair and robes, on his knees, staring at the two boys, sobbing. Something appeared to be in his hands. He opened his cupped hands and Potter gasped audibly, as Harry just stared. The golden Snitch laid in his hands, both wings broken. The man looked up at the two Harry Potters, his black eyes searching, looking like they could pierce through theirs. “What – <em>what</em> have I <em>done?”</em> Severus Snape sobbed.</p>
