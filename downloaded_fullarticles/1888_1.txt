    <p>Andrew sat at the Slytherin table with Nicky, Kevin, and Renee. Professor Dumbledore’s beginning of term speech was full of nonsense and Andrew couldn’t wait to go have a smoke on the Quidditch pitch. His firewhiskey was also calling his name.</p><p> </p><p>The Great Hall doors opened with a creak, and a small, rain-soaked, poorly dressed kid stood there. He didn’t say anything just went to sit on the far side of Slytherin table and tried to brush the rain off of him.</p><p> </p><p>Andrew had never seen a more pathetic creature.</p><p> </p><p>The feast began shortly thereafter and Andrew chowed down on roasted chicken, gravy and mashed potatoes.</p><p> </p><p>He cast a glance down the table and realized the new kid (who couldn’t be older than fourteen) was looking at him. Andrew gave him an icy, dead stare and the kid turned away.</p><p> </p><p>After the feast, Professor Dumbledore wished them goodnight and everyone began filing out of the Great Hall.</p><p> </p><p>Andrew was sleepy, the train ride had been… obnoxious. Kevin had hounded him about this year’s Quidditch line up. Andrew has ignored him up to a point and then snapped when Kevin didn’t get the hint.</p><p> </p><p>So when Andrew went to his dorm and saw a still damp child pacing in front of the small fireplace at the center of the room he gave the kid another icy look.</p><p> </p><p>“The fourth year dormitories are downstairs, punk.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m a seventh year, actually, but if you need help getting to your dorm I’m sure I could arrange something.”</p><p> </p><p>“What the fuck is your name?”</p><p> </p><p>“Josten.”</p><p> </p><p>Andrew was part of the Sacred Twenty-Eight, the twenty-eight families that had been pureblood since time began. But he’d never heard of the Jostens which meant they were probably only half-blood. There was another thing too, Josten had a faint accent, it sounded like it was German but Andrew had never been good with telling accents apart.</p><p> </p><p>“Just don’t snore,” Andrew barked and took his wand and a pack of cigarettes with him to the Quidditch pitch.</p><p> </p><p>*~*~*</p><p> </p><p>Neil was exhausted. He’d almost missed the carriages because he fell asleep on the train. This was his mother’s dying wish, that he go to Hogwarts and seek Dumbledore’s protection.</p><p> </p><p>It was just past nine when an owl tapped on the window. He could tell it was for him.</p><p> </p><p>He opened the window, took the paper and read it quickly.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Mr. Wesninski, </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> I am glad you made it safely to the castle. I will offer you protection on one condition; try out for the Quidditch Team. Your mother communicated with me that it was your passion before she died. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Albus Dumbledore </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Order of Merlin, first class </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>The problem with trying out for Quidditch was that, unless he was very much mistaken, the person who had been so unwelcoming and so nasty to him was the Slytherin captain.</p><p> </p><p>Neil sighed and curled into bed.</p>
