He smelt divine, like vanilla essence. There were grains of sugar on his cheek and Harry gently kissed them away. </p><p>“Our anniversary isn’t till the eighteenth,” Draco replied, smiling. “Next Tuesday. But three years of putting up with me, love? That deserves a whole week of celebration.”</p></div>
