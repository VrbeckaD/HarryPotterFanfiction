    <p>Ok so </p><p>Marinette Dupain-Cheng:  <br/>https://goo.gl/images/7LwNYS</p><p>She is a normal (rather clumsy)  high school student with a secret... she is also a superhero called Ladybug. Oh and she has a HUGE crush on Adrien. She has a pair of red earrings each with five black spots on. These spots disappear every minute after she has used her lucky charm (one of her super powers) which helps to defeat the sub villains who are controlled by Hawkmoth (le papllion). When she is Ladybug, and when they have all disappeared she turns back into Marinette.</p><p>Tikki: https://goo.gl/images/qJngqf</p><p>Tikki is Marinette's kwami, Tikki allows Marinette to become Ladybug. When Marinette says "Tikki, spots on!" She is sucked into Marinette's miraculous (the earrings) and Marinette becomes Ladybug. It’s kinda hard to explain but tbh it won’t be too important! </p><p>Adrien Agreste: https://goo.gl/images/oRsHjH</p><p>Ok so other than the fact that he is absolutely gorgeous.... Adrien Agreste is .. well really famous. His father is incredibly high profile and equally strict with his son. Adrien really wanted to go to a normal state school instead of having home schooling. He finally gets his wish and ends up going to the same school as Marinette.<br/>He also has a secret... he is chat noir. Chat noir is Ladybug's accomplis, oh and he is totally head over heels for her. He also doesn't know that Ladybug is Marinette and visa versa. Annoying right!</p><p>Plagg: https://goo.gl/images/hKLMy4</p><p>Plagg is quite frankly adorable, just like Tikki. He is Adrien's kwami, and he absolutely loves Camembert! <br/>When Adrien says "Plagg, claws out!" Or for the French fans "transformez moi!" Plagg is then taken in by Adrien's ring (which is his miraculous) and he becomes chat noir. </p><p>Now some not so important characters although just as loveable (apart from Chloé)</p><p>Gabriel Agreste: https://goo.gl/images/a7VTCC</p><p>He is Adrien's father and very famous in Paris for his work in fashion (incredibly high profile person.) he doesn't like his son going anywhere unless he knows where he is and never lets him go anywhere without his bodyguard.</p><p>Alya: https://goo.gl/images/EyKDNR</p><p>She is Marinette's bestie and constantly trying to help her get with Adrien as well as running her ladyblog which is dedicated to everything Ladybug does, ironically she doesn't know that Ladybug is actually her best friend.</p><p>Nino: https://goo.gl/images/RY4FoK</p><p>He is Adrien's 'wingman' always by his side and trying to help him out! There isn't much else I can really say about him I mean he is great, charismatic and quirky!</p><p>Finally we have Chloé Bourgeois: https://goo.gl/images/DF5A26</p><p>She is the 'mean girl' always bossing people around. She likes Adrien quite a bit, but as you can see, he isn't too keen. She is rich and always gets what she wants from her father (the mayor) however recently there has been some character development. </p><p>That’s it for the intro!</p>
