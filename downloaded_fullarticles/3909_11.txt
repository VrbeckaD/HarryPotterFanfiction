    <p>It had been the most miserable birthday that Harry could remember.</p><p>Not only was all his school things, books, wand, broom, and all, locked in the cupboard under the stairs, Hedwig wasn’t allowed to fly so Harry and the Dursley’s by extension had to deal with her miserable hooting at night.</p><p>But that wasn’t the worst part, the worst part was that none of his friends seemed to care about him at all. He hadn’t receive a single letter from any one of his friends in all the time he’d lived at Privet Drive even though Ron and Hermione had sworn to owl him and made him swear to owl them in return.</p><p>And Dudley had heckled him about it any chance he got.</p><p>It was his 12th birthday and Harry sat on his bed alone with no one but Hedwig for company. He still appreciated her company. She was the only thing that reminded him that Hogwarts hadn’t been a dream he’d conjured up to escape from the Dursleys.</p><p>This day, Harry wasn’t allowed downstairs because the Dursleys were entertaining important guests, the Masons. He sat miserably on his bed, singing his own birthday tune.</p><p>“Happy birthday to me...”</p><p>He heard his aunt’s piercing falsetto laugh from the kitchen.</p><p>“Happy birthday to me...”</p><p>He heard the clanking of silverware. Harry never knew he’d miss Hogwarts and his friends so much that his heart ached.</p><p>“Happy birthday dear-“</p><p>BAM! Came a sound from the dinning room below.</p><p>“HARRY!” Yelled Uncle Vernon, causing Harry to scramble down the stairs, taking steps two at a time.</p><p>What he found in the dinning room shocked him.</p><p>Uncle Vernon’s face was completely red in contrast with Aunt Petunia who was chalk white like the Masons. They were all staring at the fireplace.</p><p>Harry turned to see what they were staring at...</p><p>There, in the fireplace, stood Draco Malfoy, immaculately dressed in dark green robes, mouth pulled into a hard frown. When Harry noticed him, the silver eyes narrowed at Harry, “why have you not been replying to my messages, Potter?”</p><p>Harry didn’t know what to say. His mouth opened and closed like a fish out of water.</p><p>“What are you doing here!” Vernon hissed, a blubbering mess of rage and confusion, “If you-“</p><p>Draco casually waved his wand in Vernon’s direction, silencing him, silver eyes never leaving Harry’s. A delicate white blonde brow arched, “well?”</p><p>“I- I didn’t receive anything,” Harry blurted turning pink. Was Draco allowed to do that?</p><p>Draco’s frown deepened, “then why didn’t you send Hedwig?”</p><p>“Uhhh,” Harry turned to stare at the Dursleys. Vernon’s face was still red as a tomato, mouth opening and closing rapidly, no words escaping. Dudley had hid under the table.</p><p>At that point, Aunt Petunia began shrieking obscenities and Draco finally turned to the Dursleys, voice low and menacing, “Silence, unless you’d wish to join your pig of a husband.”</p><p>Instantly, as if Draco said some spell, the room fell silent. He turned back to Harry, “pack your things; you’re coming with me.”</p><p>Harry hesitated, “all my things are locked in the cupboard.”</p><p>Draco waved his wand again and Harry’s things, all of them including Hedwig, burst into the room, “Come, Potter.”</p><p>Harry gathered his things and hurried obediently after Draco before he paused, “how are we going to get... wherever we’re going?”</p><p>Draco looked at him like he was a idiot, “floo, of course.”</p><p>Harry flushed, “floo?”</p><p>Draco sighed, “I always forget you were raised by muggles.” He reached into his pocket, taking out a grayish powder that filled his hands, “here, throw this into the fireplace and walk into the fire and say ‘Wiltshire.’”</p><p>“Where’s that?” Harry asked.</p><p>“My mansion,” Draco said causally as if everyone owned a mansion.</p><p>Harry took the powder from Draco’s hand and threw it into the fireplace. Immediately a greenish fire burned brightly.</p><p>Before Harry entered he turned back to Draco, “oh... uh.. could you give my uncle his voice back?”</p><p>Draco gave Harry a particularly nasty smile, “Don’t worry about them, I’ll take care of it.”</p><p>Before Harry could protest, he was pushed into the green flames and he shouted, “Wiltshire!”</p><p>Wherever Harry arrived, it was dark, bleak from the high ceilings to the flying chandeliers that barely seem to illuminate anything at all. A small elf-like creature was wandering to and fro, cleaning the dusty room when it spotted Harry and dropped its broom, gaping openly.</p><p>“Hello,” Harry waved awkwardly.</p><p>“H-H-Harry Potter! Sir! W-w-what are you doing here?”</p><p>Harry was about to open his mouth until a burst of flame behind him caught his attention, “Draco!”</p><p>“What?” Draco sniffed, looking quite pleased with himself.</p><p>“What did you do to them? I thought you weren’t supposed to perform magic outside of school! And in front of muggles!” Harry gasped.</p><p>“Don’t worry, Harry,” Draco drawled, “I obliviated the muggle’s memories.”</p><p>Harry gawked at Draco, “But uncle Vernon,” he began.</p><p>“I only obliviated <em>some</em> of the muggles’,” Draco smiled slyly.</p><p>Harry gaped.</p><p>“Draco-“ he began.</p><p>“What is the meaning of this!” Snarled a cold familiar voice behind him.</p><p>Harry turned to see Lucius Malfoy standing with a dark frown on his face.</p><p>Draco’s face contorted into an equally dark frown and he turned to Harry, saying quietly, “let’s go.”</p><p>“Draco!” Lucius began, “I received this letter about someone performing magic in a muggle only zone-“</p><p>Draco grabbed Harry and threw some more floo powder into the fireplace, a green fire erupted again.</p><p>“Draco-“ said Harry but Draco was already hauling him into the fire, “say the burrow!”</p><p>That was how Harry arrived in the Weasley’s home, still in his muggle clothes and very, very confused.</p>
