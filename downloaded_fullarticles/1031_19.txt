    <p align="justify">Chapter 1</p><p align="justify">He and Hermione circle the Great Lake with her arm in the crook of his. Ron hangs back but doesn’t seem bothered about the intimacy between the two of them – when Harry casts his head back every so often, Ron is only concentrating on making sure his wandpoint stays illuminating Hermione’s footsteps, lighting her path. It is autumn – September – but the grounds by the lake are slippery with mud, and they’ve chosen the circuitous path back to the castle from Hogsmeade. Harry had drunk because Ron and Hermione had drunk. They had sat in a booth in the nicest corner of the Three Broomsticks and in the absence of the need for secrecy they had let Luna and Neville and Seamus and Dean and Parvati filter in and out of the conversation as well. Parvati and Dean had danced and so Hermione, trying something new, or something, had stood up herself and dragged Ron up onto his feet too, and Ron had held Hermione’s waist and they sashayed for a few minutes to The Ministry of Mad Gits before Hermione’s face turned red with embarrassment so they stopped. They were like his parents, Harry thought – brought together more quickly because of the pall of death that was hanging – had hung – over them. God, he got maudlin when he drank.</p><p align="justify">Hermione looks over at him and smiles and raises her eyebrows. He smiles back and pulls her arm in closer. <em>Ron,</em> thinks Harry, <em>is growing, maturing, shedding his jealousy and proving himself to be a loving partner, because he’s not frozen the way that I am</em> – <em>when you die and then come back what makes you different from the walking dead?</em>  It's a thought he's been having lately, which crops up at odd moments. Looking out at the lake, he remembers the Inferi. The texture of their clutching, weeping skin. That’s probably what put it in his head.</p><p align="center">*</p><p align="justify"><br/>The next morning Harry wakes with a headache which he barely registers. At breakfast when he drops into his seat Hermione presses her wand to his temple, hmphs and rolls her eyes, casting something which takes the pain away instantly.</p><p align="justify">“Thanks,” he mumbles.</p><p align="justify">“Harry,” she says. It’s loud in the Great Hall but she’s louder. “You know that I’d come with you if I weren’t overloading with classes. I’ve read a great deal about th—”</p><p align="justify">He cuts her off with a finger to his lips which confirms that, yes, he may be insane.</p><p align="justify">“Don’t say it!”</p><p align="justify">“Oh, Harry,” she says. “It’s not just you who’ll be there, you know. Don’t tell me you’d rather be in History of Magic.”</p><p align="justify">“At least Binns never made us do – macramé,” says Harry. He’s trying to remember what sorts of things he spotted Oprah and her ilk doing on day-time telly at the Dursleys. “Trust falls. Turning trousers into a summer short.”</p><p align="justify">“You couldn’t pull off shorts,” says Hermione. “Your legs are too hairy. So don’t worry about it.” She leans forward, taking Harry’s empty plate in her right hand, and commences piling it high with breakfast foods. “If you don’t go to your mandatory therapy, Harry, “ she looks over at him significantly, “I will make you feel guilt.” She places his plate down in front of him with a thunk. “I will remind you of all the dead.” She lifts a fork and takes his arm, which is outstretched helplessly on the table, unclasping, with some effort, his hand which is clenched into a fist, and curls it back around the fork. “I will remind you that they would love to have survived the war.” She directs his fork-hand into a sausage, and she forces him to pierce it awkwardly. “They would have loved to go to mandatory therapy at 9.45 in the Astronomy Tower, which is in exactly half an hour, and don’t forget your trauma workbook.”</p><p align="justify">Harry lets out just one enormous sigh before the sausage enters the real estate of his mouth.</p><p align="center">*</p><p align="justify"><br/>Malfoy is there too. In Mandatory Therapy. At the Astronomy Tower. At 9.45. Where they – that is, Harry and Malfoy – had failed to respectively save and kill Dumbledore. The thought makes him think, <em>Look, at least this isn’t Occlumency class</em>. He’s always being tossed into some remedial class or another. Sorry my parents weren’t <em>dentists, </em>he thinks. They were <em>dead. </em>So of course I ended up with a shitty <em>brain</em>. It’s not fair to Hermione but there you have it – it’s something he thinks, on occasion.  </p><p align="justify">Inside the room – Trelawney’s old class room – there are nine chairs arranged in a circle. There are only nine traumatised people in the school? Harry thinks. Did the rest just die? The way he walks in he spots Malfoy from the back of his head. The little bastard would sit with his back to the door – showing off about how little trauma he has, thinks Harry. For his part, he heads towards a chair that will afford him a clear eyeline to the door, thank you very much.<br/>This will leave four chairs between Harry and Malfoy – a healthy distance. He drops into his, just as a wizard wearing a nametag which reads PSYCHOWIZARD emerges from behind a curtain behind which, Harry suspects, the PSYCHOWIZARD has stuffed all of Trelawney’s old things, to make way for the class. PSYCHOWIZARD. I’ll bet you are, thinks Harry.</p><p align="justify">Harry can’t discern if the two of them – the Psychowizard and Malfoy – have been occupying the room in silence waiting for a third to arrive, or if they’d been chatting right before he walked in. He can’t imagine Malfoy chatting lightly with anyone. Instead, Malfoy is just staring at his hands, palms up. He doesn’t look up when Harry opens the door and walks in, nor when he settles into his seat. Just stares at his palms – Harry catches the glint of three silver rings on his fingers. Bet he doesn’t bite his fingernails, thinks Harry. Showing off how little trauma he has. Arsehole.</p><p align="justify"><br/>Harry returns his attention to the approaching Psychowizard, who has been bee-lining toward Harry with an enormous grin on his face.</p><p align="justify">“Hey, Psychowizard,” says Harry. Malfoy’s head snaps up at that and he looks back down again but his eyebrows stay raised.</p><p align="justify">“It’s so, so nice to finally meet you. We had worried we would never meet you. My name is Bonython Buenamente.”</p><p align="justify">The Psychowizard holds out a hand and Harry takes it in his own and then for the hell of it pumps it firmly, double-clasping, deciding to put on a show of utmost sanity.</p><p align="justify">“Likewise,” says Harry. “So nice to meet you, Bonython. When you say we, though, what would you say you mean? Just because,” he jerks a thumb over at Malfoy, <em>“that</em> guy has met me.”</p><p align="justify">He feels a little manic, like he’s on Felix Felicis. That’s one thing about being getting older, one thing he’s learnt out about himself recently – that he knows how to simulate charisma, how to be likeable and blokey and jovial and natural and easy and breezy, and it mostly sort of works. He had discovered this on the night of his eighteenth. Ron and Hermione had taken him out in Soho or somewhere equally horrible. He had worn a hoodie and jeans and sneakers and the bouncer almost hadn’t let him in because of the dress code. Instead of a Confundus Harry had just palmed the guy a ten pound note and smiled and leaned in and said, “Can I go in now, yeah?” and the guy had let him. It had felt like nothing at all. They had danced for hours and then a girl had stood too close to Harry, while Harry waited at the bar for drinks – it was his round – almost like she was – trying to touch Harry, waiting for some excuse to brush against him under the guise of moving past him. Frustrated, annoyed, feeling crowded and overly warm, Harry had turned around and said, “Hey,” and the girl had said, “Hey”, and within fifteen minutes they had been making out and that’d been that. It was easy to lean in close to shout in her ear, and then to reach out like it was natural and play with her hair, and then to keep his hand on her shoulder, and then to curl one round the back of her head, and then to get her to open up her lips, et cetera, et cetera. That, too, had felt like mostly nothing at all.</p><p align="justify">Bonython looks bewildered only for a moment but then laughs.</p><p align="justify">“Don’t bring an attitude into this space, Mr Potter.” He’s two heads shorter than Harry but Harry knows, senses, that he’s fucked up. “I won’t let you disrupt the therapeutic experience for the others.”</p><p align="justify">“What others?” says Harry, receding into his seat and resolved to wait out the clock with his hands behind his head out-nonchalanting Malfoy.</p><p align="justify">The door opens then, and like a clown car emptying, seven students stride briskly into the room clutching their trauma workbooks to their chests.</p>
