    <p> </p><p>„Excuse me?!"</p><p>„Narcissa, please.... I beg you to listen to me. I can't sent Draco away, but if I kill you.... more precicely, someone who is looking like you... you can be safe.... Narcissa, if I will fail again, he will punish you, and I can't let that happen...."</p><p>„Lucius..." Narcissa had tears in her eyes, but maybe he was right.... No!</p><p>„You can't actually thinking this way..." she said and he cupped her face in her hands.</p><p>„I can think exactly this way.... we thought about the living Death, but he is mad enough to kill someone twice. Or tortured a corpse...."</p><p>„We?! Who else is involved of this?!"</p><p>„Snape and Draco..." he said and she stared in shock at him. „If he kills you..."</p><p>„Than he have a mother.... Narcissa, we don't have that much time...."</p><p>Narcissa was thinking. Maybe he is right...</p><p>She looked up at him and he kissed her. „I know I've done many things. Wrong things.... let me do this right...."</p><p>„Where shall I go?" she asked. It was more than a whisper and he whispered back: „Help them...."</p><p>She closed her eyes and he kissed her forehead. „I love you, Narcissa... maybe not in the way, you deserve it, but if anything happens... allow yourself to love...."</p><p>„Lucius..."</p><p>„I know that you never truely loved me... how could you... I don't blame you, Cissy..."</p><p>The door behind them opened and Snape entered. „We are ready. She have to leave. Now."</p><p>Narcissa sobbed and turned to Snape: „Watch over Draco...."</p><p>He nodded and she called an house elf and disapparated...</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Narcissa sent the house elf to a saver place and looked around. She stood in the middle of a forest and it was midnight. She closed her Eyes and concentrate herself....</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>„Lucius... you failed again.... your task was clear: Bring me a new wand."</p><p>Lucius stood there and looked down at his feet.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>„I warned you. Bring her in!"</p><p>He watched while Voldemort killed an innicent witch. But it has do be done...</p><p>No one screamed, or cried. Lucius looked at his son, who was as pale as ice....</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>„What are you doing out here?" Hermione asked and Harry said: „I need just a walk, maybe Ron came back and can't find us..."</p><p>„Okay... but don't go too far."</p><p>He nodded and moved on.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>After a few minutes he couldn't see the tent anymore and sat down....</p><p>He thought about Ron. He was stupid to left them... He looked up after a few minutes and looked straight into the silver eyes of a Patronus. A Dolphin.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The Dolphin looked at him and moved backwards and stood still in midair. He understood, stood up and followed the Patronus.</p><p>He didn't knew someone's Patronus was a Dolphin, but it couldn't be a death eater...</p><p>„Who's there?" Harry asked when the Patronus vanished infront of a tree.</p><p>„Someone you'll maybe know.... and I'm sure you wouldn't believe me...." a voice behind the tree said and Harry did not move and asked again: „Who are you? Show yourself..."</p><p>Narcissa stepped infront of the tree and pulled off her hood.</p><p>„Oh shit.... you... you are..." Harry searched for his wand, and remembered, that he hasn't a wand any more...</p><p>„Narcissa Malfoy. Yes...."</p><p>„What are you doing here? Who else is here?!"</p><p>„I'm alone. I swear...." Narcissa said and put back her wand as slowly as she could.</p><p>„I'm here to help."</p><p>„You?! Of course..." Harry said sarcastically, and Narcissa was about to say something, when they both heard someone apparating. Narcissa pulled him against a tree and pressed her hand at Harry's mouth...</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>„So Lucius killed his wife..."</p><p>„No you fool. The dark Lord killed that Bitch. He don't trust Lucius anymore.... maybe the Lord should have killed Lucius instead of that whore. I wanted to fuck her in her perfect arse..."</p><p>„You are married..."</p><p>„I don't care of my silly and ugly wife..."</p><p>„Here's nobody. Come."</p><p>the both Snatchers disapparated...</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Narcissa let go of Harry and both were looking at each other.</p><p>„What's going on here?" Harry asked and Narcissa said: „The dark Lord is angry... he ordered Lucius to bring him a new wand, after he crashed Lucius' wand, but he did not found a new wand. And he warned him not to fail... and he failed...."</p><p>„So.... wait..." Harry thought about Narcissas words and the older witch said: „The dark Lord has ordered to punish me if Lucius should fail... he sent me away.... I can help you... I only ask for trust...."</p><p>„You know, that's not that easy..."</p><p>„I'm aware of that. That's why, I was waiting for you. You are a the chosen one. Of course, you don't ask for that, but you are a Gryffindor..." Narcissa said and Harry said: Okay... I think we should go, and talk to Hermione."</p><p> </p><p>Narcissa nodded and pulled over her hood and followed hin.</p><p> </p><p>„Hermione. Can I talk to you? There's something.... I want to talk with you...." Harry asked and Hermione stood up: „Who's that?"  and Harry said: „Please don't burst out.... she helped me."</p><p> </p><p>Narcissa showed herself and Hermione immediately pointed her wand at her face. „What are YOU doing here?!! Harry, what is she doing here?!"</p><p> </p><p>„Do you ask that, because I don't have a wand in my hand, or because your friend here, is dead?" Narcissa asked sarcastically and Hermione lowered her wand a little.</p><p>„She is here for helping us." Harry said and Hermione asked sarcastically: „Oh really?! With what?! Insultings?!"</p><p> </p><p>Narcissa asked her for a talk in private.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>„Mione... please..." Harry took her Hand, and Hermione gave up after a few minutes and nodded and gave Harry her wand. Narcissa raised an perfect sculped eyebrow and did the same. They left Harry outside the tent....</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>„Why do you even think of the possiblity, that I could try to trust you?!" Hermione crossed her arms infront of her chest, and stared at Narcissa.</p><p>„Because, I left my husband, and my son behind.... because my husband gave me the chance to live... Ms Granger-"</p><p>„Don't Ms Granger me!"</p><p>„Hermione than! You can whether yell at me, or listen to me, and remember yourself, which house you belong, and try to trust me!"</p><p>Hermione looked at the older witch, scrutinized her, before she said: „I punched your son four years ago. Don't think, I wouldn't punch you, just because you're older... or a woman.... A Malfoy, is a Malfoy...."</p><p>Without awaiting an answer, Hermione left the tent....</p><p> </p><p>„Okay.... she can stay..." Hermione said.</p><p> </p><p>„We will transfigure the tent into two sides. If you are agree." Narcissa looked at Hermione, who nodded and Harry gave her back her wand and nodded...</p><p> </p><p>„Where's your friend by the way?" Narcissa asked and Harry told her about their fight.</p><p>„So... if the fight was because of the horcrux than he will come back. I'm sure. But we should sleep some place else. There were snatchers, when I was spoken to Mr Potter..."</p><p>They agreed and disapparated...</p><p> </p><p>Narcissa and Hermione casted some protection spells, while Harry build up the tent again.</p><p>They were now on a cliff nearby a sea, but it was beautiful.</p><p>Hermione wanted to talk to the older woman, but she saw her fighting against some tears, and let her alone...</p><p> </p><p>„Mrs Malfoy...?"</p><p>„If we weren't under attack, then I really hope it's important...." Narcissa said into her pillow the next morning and Hermione whispered: „It is important.... we want to visit Xenophelius Lovegood."</p><p>„That crazy guy from 'Quibbler'?!"</p><p>„Yes..."</p><p>Narcissa turned around and faced Hermione. „May I ask why?"</p><p>„Because of a symbol we found more than once, and Harry thought it's connected with the horcruxes...."</p><p>Narcissa sat up and asked about that sighn and Hermione showed it to her.</p><p>Narcissa took the book and touched Hermiones finger slightly and said: „I know what that is."</p><p>„You do?" Hermione asked and Narcissa said: „Give me five minutes and I'll be outside."</p><p>Hermione nodded and left the tent...</p><p> </p><p>Narcissa came outside and sat herself beside Harry and Hermione and said: „That symbol you found are the deathly hallows."</p><p>„The what?!" Harry asked and Narcissa asked whether they knew about the three brothers, and Hermione said: „Yes" but Harry shook his head: „No...."</p><p>„Wait a second...." Hermione said and searched in her bag. She found the book and started reading, while Narzissa pulled out her wand and draw the symbols into a stone between them....</p><p> </p><p>„You have the Elderwand, the Resurrection Stone, and the invisibility cloak...." Narcissa explained them and Harry said: „Are you absolutely sure, that you can help us?"</p><p>„Yes."</p><p>„You won't be able, to bath every day, nor sleep on a king size bed.... are you sure, that you are able to survive without house elfs?"</p><p>„Hermione..."</p><p>„It's alright, Mr Potter.... Ms Granger still doesn't trust me.... but let me make this clear... Hermione. We sleep above each other..."</p><p> </p><p>'Wow....' Harry thought, and looked at them both....</p>
