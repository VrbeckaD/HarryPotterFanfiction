    <p>Chapter One- Damon Salvatore</p><p>  Damon Salvatore walked through the park through a small village called Little Whinging. He heard crying it wasn't loud crying just sniffles he followed the sound and saw a tiny child with bruises all over her tiny body. He said "I shouldn't get involved" bright green eyes looked up at him and he was hooked. He walked over like you would a small animal she looked three years old he said "Hey beautiful what's your name." The girl whimpered "Fwreak" Damon growled and said "Hey now no you aren't pretty" the girl tilts her head to the side "Twat what's Uncle's cwall me" Damon Salvatore growled and said "Well angel do you want to come with me I'm a freak too us freaks need to stick together." </p><p>  Freak stared at the pretty man and said "No you's not a Fwreak" the man grinned "Of course I am" black lines appeared under his eyes and she squealed and jumped back. Damon was about to back up and she walked over slowly and touched under his eyes and hummed "You is not Fwreak you are perfect." Damon's eyes widened and he mumbled "Then you are to princess do you want to come with me I'll be your daddy" she whimpered "You want me really want me" Damon nodded "Yes I really want you" he held out his arms and she ran to him and he wrapped an arm around her frail body and lifted her up and kissed her head she tested the name "Daddy I like that." Damon's heartbeat quickened and mumbled "I like it to." </p><p>An hour later</p><p>  Damon looked at his princess really looked at her now that she was clean and healed he had slipped two drops of his blood into her juice to heal her wounds. She has tanned skin it looked like it was from having sunburn over and over his blood didn't heal that so her skin was now a caramel color. He ran his hand gently over her face and she purred in her sleep she looked like a princess when she wasn't all beat up she had dark red hair and green eyes. He lifted her bangs and saw a lighting bolt scar on her forehead that hadn't healed. He touched it and felt the evil and hissed veins coming underneath his eyes he growled "What the hell!" He needed to get her to a witch soon it didn't look like it was hurting her so he backed away from that Damon looked down at his caramel baby. He mumbled "I will kill them for you angel I promise" with that he left the hotel room with his new daughter sleeping on the huge bed covered in blankets.</p><p>  He backtracked to the park and followed her scent back to Privet Drive Damon sneered at the same houses over and over again he thought "how could anyone live here." He went to Number 4 Privet Drive he knocked on the door it was 10 at night and the house lights were still on. A woman answered carrying a large toddler who looked like a baby whale. She said "Hello how may I help you" the toddler whined "Mummy I'm hungry make fwreak make food." Damon looked disgusted he used compulsion and said "May I come in then you can make the piglet something to eat" she grinned "Of course you can" she walked away. Damon walked in and a far man came down the stairs he yelled "Who in the hell are you" Damon ran in front of him and hissed "My name is Damon Salvatore and I'm the freaks new guardian when I kill you and your ugly wife." He grabbed the huge man and growled "Now where are her parents" Vernon screamed when he saw the black veins under his eyes. He said "Her freak parents dropped her off her two years ago." </p><p>  Damon hummed "Interesting what's her real name" "Violet Potter." Damon hummed "I don't like that name I think I will change it hmm" and tore a chunk out of the car mans neck he spit out the blood "disgusting" He threw the body to the floor and the wife ran out and Damon hissed "Don't you dare scream" she stood in shock looking at her husband. He walked over "Where did my daughter stay!" She whimpered and pointed to the cupboard he roared "You put my daughter in a cupboard underneath the stairs!" He ran and snapped her neck and her body hit the floor. He picked up the fat child and he dropped him off in front of a neighbors house and went back and set the house a blaze he smirked and walked away happily.</p><p>  He was going to take Anastasia to adopt her here and then he was going to take her to America to adopt her there it should be easy. Damon walked into the room and she heard him and ran to him and cried "I thought you left me daddy!" Damon grinned down at him and cooed "I would never ever leave you ok" she nodded and Damon said "So your name is going to be Anastasia Evelyn Salvatore do you like it Eve or Ana for short" she grinned up at him and hugged his legs "Love Ana daddy" Damon grinned and rubbed her hair and mumbled "Daddies little princess."</p>
