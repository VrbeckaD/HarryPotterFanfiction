<p>chapter one</p>
<p>The entire wizarding Britain was in chaos when the goblins announced just that morning that the bank would be close for the day with no specific reason that was given. Just that the bank would be close for everyone. Unknown to the public knowledge several witches and wizards are summoned at the bank that day. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The goblins guarding the door  was all waiting patiently and excitedly. They all knew that today the fate of the entire wizarding world would change drastically. When the clock finally chimed twelve some witches and wizards passing by the bank was surprised when several unknown individuals apparated just outside the entrance of the bank and quickly ushered inside by the guards waiting for them. No one could figure out who are they as all of them was wearing a special cloak with hood to hide their identity specially made and provided by the goblins.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Once inside they were allowed to take the cloak off and all of them was rather surprise when the identity of their companions was revealed. Severus scanned the room they were in and noticed that everyone in there was a member of the Black family. Andromeda Tonks nee Black together with her husband Ted and daughter Nymphadora. There's also Bellatrix Lestrange nee Black with his husband Rudolphus. Narcissa Malfoy nee Black with her husband Lucius and her son Draco. And ofcourse the current Lord Black, Sirius.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>" What's this? A family reunion?" he commented icily then turned towards the goblin that ushered them here " I think you've mistaken. I have no part in this little family gathering,"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"I assure you Lord Prince, your presence here is just as important as anyone here. Much more important if I may say so myself," replied a voice from the doorway. Everyone turned to look at the doorway and everyone was shocked to find Lord Ragnok, the goblin king himself standing there.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>They all quickly bowed down and greeted him respectfully. Afterwards they were gestured to the seats assigned to them infront of Lord Ragnok's desk. Much to Severus and Sirius annoyance they were both seated in a small couch that their body was almost touching when they are sitting. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>" Now that we are all settled I'm quite certain that you were all wondering why all of you has been summoned here now despite the fact that the bank has been close for everyone today. But before we proceed It's a must that each of you take a certain potion so you could fully understand what we are about to discussed," explained the goblin king.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Everyone was quite wary and a bit curious as to what and why they need to take a certain potion. And as expected the potion master among the group was the one who react first.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>" What potion?" asked Severus suspiciously.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>" It's an antidote,"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"for what?" asked the potion master impatiently.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>" For a mind altering potion," replied the gobling king stiffly that made everyone in the room froze from their seats.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>" And what was that supposed to mean? that everyone of us here was dose with a mind altering potion?" hissed the Malfoy Lord angrily.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>" Unfortunately, Lord Malfoy that is indeed correct. But Lord Black and Lord Prince was also under the influence of some dark and illegal spells and potion aside from the one already mentioned earlier," Lord Ragnok informed them making Sirius and Severus stared at the goblin king in disbelief and horror. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sirius hadn't been feeling very well this past few days. The unusual headache he had been suffering this past weeks that caused him to had little to no sleep at all. The constant constricting of his chest that if he didn't know any better he would think he was having a heart attack. And then to make the matters worst he felt as though there is something inside of him that wanted to be freed. But what scared him the most was that he was constantly looking forward to their order meeting as it was the only time the Potion master comes to the headquarters or when he was bringing Remy's potion. He hate to admit it but Severus presence sooths him. His presence dampened the headache and chest pain. And calms down that thing inside of him that wanted to get freed. When he felt like he was about to explode from anger and devastation most of the time because of Albus Dumbledore and Molly Weasley just one look or one word from the potion master, Sirius would immediately calm down and ground his erratic magic. Not that he let anyone noticed. He felt like he need to hide this certain fact to anyone. He knew something was wrong. Something was going on. Unaware that the potion master beside him was also experiencing the same as he did. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>And now sitting here and finding out that almost all of the remaining members of the Black family was dose with mind altering potion and that he and Severus was as well under the influenced of several dark and illegal spells and potions snapped something inside of him and everyone was surprised when all of a sudden he let out a painful scream as he clutched both his head and chest tightly at the same time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Severus was beside him immediately holding the screaming wizard in his arm much to the shocked of everyone in the room. The goblin healer approached them intending to check on Sirius but quickly stepped back warily when the potion master's menancing obsidian orb snapped towards him promising pain if he so much as take one more step closer to them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The others hadn't even attempt to  make any sound or movement that would turn the furious potion master's attention to them. They were all aware how deadly he was, and seeing him now almost feral they were very much certain just one wrong move and they would be all dead in this room in just mere seconds. Though they were just as curious as to what was happening.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The healer turned to looked at their king inquiring on what he was supposed to do.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>" Lord Prince," called the goblin king. When the attention of the potion master was already focus to him he continued " Lord Black needs to be check by our healer. You do want your mate to get better aren't you?"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A couple of gasped was heard at the mentioned of mate but the goblin king's attention was solely focus on the potion master for now.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Severus brows furrowed in confusion as he looked down at the now unconscious Sirius in his arms. He really had no idea what was happening. It was just something deep inside him urging him to protect and take good care of this wizard in his arms right now. He eyed the healer for a while deciding if he wasn't a danger to his mate. 'mate' that word alone warmed his heart and calm something inside him. With one last glanced to Sirius face he turned to Lord Ragnok and nodded his agreement for the healer to check on Sirius. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>He gently laid Sirius on the couch where they were sitting earlier his head was settled on his lap as the healer rushed towards them and began casting spell after spell to scan the Unconscious Black Lord. Severus watching his every movement and willing to act if he sense his mate was in danger.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After a while the healer finally stepped away from Sirius " amazing. He was able to broke all the potion and spells that was on him," he whispered as he stared at Sirius in awe and a hint of admiration that Severus hadn't appreciated at all as he let out an angry growl snapping the healer out of his thoughts.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>" Lord Prince, I suggest it would be best if you take the potion now so you could fully understand everything that happened before your mate woke up. He would surely be devastated when he realized what happened," suggested the goblin king taking away the protective potion master's attention from his healer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>" I would like to know first what are the potions and spells we're under influence to,"  Severus demanded..</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lord Ragnok nodded his agreement  not at all offended by Severus action as he took some parchment from one of his guards. " Very well, to start with, Lord Black. The Klironomia syndetikó potion,<br/> and creature supressant potion Administer by Albus Dumbledore on year 1980," </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Everyone jumped in surprise when the vase and jars at the corner of the room explode all of a sudden. Severus clenched his fist tightly as he took a deep breath trying to reign his temper and magic. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>" I appologize for losing control, Lord Ragnok," </p>
<p> </p>
<p>" It's quite understable, Lord Prince. To continue, he was also dose with Lust and Love potion to James Potter. Administered by James Potter himself. As well as compulsion spell to Hate all slytherins. Compulsion spell to hate the black family. Compulsion spell to hate the dark families. Compulsion spell to hate Severus Snape. Loyalty spell to the light side. Loyalty spell to Albus Dumbledore. Loyalty spell to the House of Potter. Cast by Albus Dumbledore and James Potter. Mate bond binder and Memory Block cast by Lily Potter and Albus Dumbledore," Ragnok ended reading grimly as he face the furious and beyond shocked witches and wizards. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>" I assume that the same had been done to me," Severus much more stated than asked.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>" The first two potion mentioned earlier was the same administered by Albus Dumbledore the same year. Love and Lust potion to Lily Potter administered by Lady Potter herself. Compulsion to hate gryffindor, the Prince family, Sirius Black, Harry Potter. Loyalty spell to the light side, to Albus Dumbledore, Mate bond binder,Memory Block, and a spell to bind 70 percent of your potion ability all cast by Dumbledore and Lily Potter,"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Severus took Sirius' hands with his and gently brushed the unconscious wizard's knuckles. It didn't take a genius to understand everything. All of this was done to separate him and Sirius. What he don't understand was why? Then he caught sight of the vial of potion that was sitting innocently on the table. The antidote for the memory block and mind altering potion. Without any hessitation he picked the potion up then drank it in one go. The effect was abrupt as Severus suddenly clutched his head and chest tightly just like Sirius earlier but he didn't scream. He forced himself not to until he finally passed out.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The room was filled with tense silence as they all waited for Severus' erratic magic to calmed down. They had been feeling since Lord Ragnok listed all the potions and spells that was used to Sirius.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After a while when they were all certain that it was finally safe to move or talk the healer immediately rushed towards the two unconscious wizards at the same time Draco asked irritably "Can someone please tell me what the hell is going on?"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>" Indeed Lord Ragnok. Will you kindly enlighten us as to what is really going on?" Lucius agreed with his son not even reprimanding him for his language in favor of getting information.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>" All you need to do is take the potion, Lord Malfoy," replied the goblin king gesturing the potions on the table. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Everyone eyed the potion surprisingly it was Bellatrix who picked the potion from the table then everyone followed except for Draco as he was still just a baby at that time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>" Is it painful?" asked Nymphadora eyeing the potion in her hand warily. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>" It's not painful at all. You will only experience a mild headache and lightheadedness. It's painful with Lord Prince-Black because of the inheritance and creature supressant and mate bond binder," replied the healer as he was done checking on the potion master who now laid on the transfigured bed beside Sirius.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>All at once The three Black Sisters drank the potion together with their husbands and child. Just like with Severus earlier the effect was instant as they all found themselves assaulted with waves of memories over memories.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Afterwards they all sat in silence contemplating their newly regained memories. Andromeda now fully remembered. She wasn't really disowned as their parents fully accept Ted despite him being a muggleborn because he proved to them that he is worthy to be included in the Black Family. She as well recalled Sirius, and Severus getting married during the summer after their sixth year. Then he gave birth to a twin boys on april. And one of them was her godson, while the other one was Bella's.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As if on cue, Bella's anguish cry snapped them all out of their thoughts " my baby. Rudo, our baby where is he?" cried Bella as her husband held her in his arms. His face blank but anyone who knew him better could clearly see that he was about ready to kill someone, anyone. Prefferably the one who stole their son from them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>" We will find him love, I promise. If I had to torture all Dumbledore's men one by one just to know where they took him I will," swear The Lestrange Lord sincerely.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>" That won't be necessary, Lord Lestrange. For now I mean," the goblin king added when he saw the dark look the Lestrange Lord was giving him. " We know where the current Lestrange heir was placed,"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Bellatrix immediately snapped  towards the goblin king her eyes hopeful " where? please, where is my baby? Tell me so I can get him now," she asked eagerly</p>
<p> </p>
<p>" Dumbledore placed him to one of the families that was loyal to him, The Weasleys," replied Lord Ragnok.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>" Ronald Weasley," Andromeda stated immediately realizing who among the Weasleys he goblin Lord was talking about.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>" Weasley," Draco choked out then immediately raised his hand in surrender when his aunt Bella gave him a stern look daring him to say anything wrong towards the red head as she was fully aware of their animosity at Hogwarts. " Im not going to say anything mean, Aunt Bella. Not now that I know he's my cousin. But Im certain you will be having hard time convincing him of this. He hates all dark and slytherin," he explained</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That immediately dampened Bellatrix' hopeful mood. </p>
<p>" Draco,  did you really have to say that?" reprimand Narcissa sternly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>" I'm just telling the truth, mother. We all knew he's very close to Potter  they're practically brothers. I even thought at times that he cared for Potter more than his own brothers. Do you think he would abandoned Potter for someone Potter hated as much as he hate the Dark lord? Aunt Bella nearly sent Sirius Black to the veil last year, Someone Potter considered father figure. And if my memory serves me right he even crucio you for that Aunt Bella," explained Draco thoroughly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Bellatrix nodded meekly as she sat back morosely. Now that her memory was regained she felt very ashamed and guilty of what she had done. She and Sirius was very close before their memory was altered that's why Sirius made her godmother to one of the twins. She was devastated that her action would likely cause her son to not accept them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>" If that's the case Heir Malfoy there wouldn't be any problem as same as <br/>Heir Lestrange, his best friend Mr. Potter was also stolen from his real family together with his older brothers," the goblin lord informed them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>" Dear merlin!" gasped Narcissa in disbelief as she was the first to understand what Lord Ragnok was trying to tell them " they are Sirius and Severus' children right?" </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lord Ragnok nodded in confirmation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>" Bloody hell!" exclaimed Draco in shock at the same time a movement from the make shift bed alerted them that the two finally regained consciousness.</p>
<p>Severus was the first to recover and immediately got up ignoring his throbbing head and the vial of pain reliever potion the healer offered him. Instead he took one from his own pocket and gathered the now silently crying Sirius in  his arms. His husband. Dear merlin, all this time they were trying to kill one another when in truth they were really bonded mates. He coaxed Sirius to opened his lips and drink the potion as he whispered words of comfort to him.</p>
<p>Sirius heart was breaking. Everything that he had believed was just a lie. A made up memory to separate him from his husbands, to destroy their family. They stole their children. Oh merlin, their children, they need to find them immediately. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>He reluctantly pulled away from the warm of his husband's embrace. He looked at Severus' obsidian orbs that always seemed to made him feel treasured and love before and was glad that it was still the same until now. " Sev, our children and Caius. We need to find them," he said his eyes filled with unshed tears begging for his husband to do everything in able to find them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>" Of course, love. I would move heaven and earth just to find them. I promise soon we will all be together again," promise the potion master sincerely.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>" Lord Prince-Black, about your children we would like to inform you that we knew who and where they are now," the goblin king informed them quite eagerly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sirius and Severus immediately perked up at that. "Really? Who? Where are they? Can we get them now? Are they alright? Are they taken care of?" Sirius asked excitedly.  While Severus looked at his husband fondly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Of course you can get them now. The twins lived a simple but content life. But Im afraid your youngest lived a very hard life since he was a baby," Ragnok informed them sadly. That made Sirius froze in dread and  Severus tense as pulled Sirius in his arms once again hugging him comfortingly</p>
<p> </p>
<p>" Sev, our baby,"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>" Don't worry. We will going to get him, them now. We will going to love and take good care of them from now on," the potion master assured his devastated husband. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>He turned toward the Goblin king and asked " who are they?"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He noticed Ragnok hesitated for a while before answering that made him feel wary and apprehensive and later on found out it was for a reason when he heard the names the goblin king stated " Fred and George Weasley and Harry Potter,"</p>
