    <p>“Avada Kedavra!” the hooded figure yelled. There was a flash of green light from within the house, an upper corner of the house blew out in a shower of wood and plaster, and Sirius screamed. Who was it that had died? James? Lily? Harry? Who died because he could not run fast enough? He pointed his wand into the air and made a large swooping gesture, a tendril of tawny gold and ruby red shooting out of the end of his wand. When he looked up, there was a fiery gold phoenix shimmering in the sky. A request for help from any Order members in the area. Something that James had thought of. </p>
<p>He ran towards the house and he instantly felt the remnants of the broken Fidelius Charm. He could feel his throat  start to close up and hot tears start to stream down his face but he ignored it in favor of getting inside the house. </p>
<p>The first thing he saw upon entry of the ransacked house was his best friend’s dead body. It lay, crumpled, on the foot of the stairs. There were no obvious markings on his corpse, and you probably wouldn’t even be able to tell he was dead if not for the pale pallor of his skin and his glassy hazel eyes, staring up at nothing. Empty. Sirius took a deep breath, willing himself not to break down. There was a chance that Voldemort was still in the house, a chance that Lily and Harry were still alive, and he couldn’t risk their demise by breaking down now. But if Lily was alive… Why was the house so quiet? Surely…</p>
<p>He shot up the stairs like a bat out of hell. The entire upper floor seemed to be sagging in on itself, the walls breaking down. There was a shower of glass everywhere he stepped, making it impossible to walk without the crunching sound under his boots, like dead leaves. He shuddered inwardly at the term. Dead. His best friend, one of the only people that could keep him sane, once of the only people that could make life bearable for him, was dead. Why James?</p>
<p>The first room we went to was the nursery. It seemed to be the most damaged area of the house. He could feel a cold draft coming from the area of the house the nursery was in. Probably from the explosion, Sirius thought distantly. </p>
<p>He stepped into the room and was met with the sight of a pale body on the floor. Her auburn hair spread in a fan around her head. Her eyes were facing the ceiling. The shade of green was piercing, chilling him to the bone. Voldemort was nowhere in sight. He fell to his knees.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry Lily, I’m so sorry… I should’ve been here to protect you and Jamie and Harry… please, please forgive me Lils...” His shoulders shook with his sobs, and he held her lifeless hand in his, pressing the cold skin to his forehead. His tears made a trail down her arm, and he let the hand go, crossing them over her stomach and dragging a hand over her emerald green eyes. They fell shut, and Sirius felt lighter now that he wasn’t under their accusing gaze. </p>
<p>He rose to his feet. Perhaps he should cover their bodies. He knew they had a closet for spare sheets and blankets…</p>
<p>He was about to leave the room when he heard it. A sniffle. It was barely there, but he heard it. It was quickly followed by a wail. Could it be…</p>
<p>He walked toward the crib holding his godson slowly. And, sure enough, there he was. His vibrant green eyes were full of tears, and blood was streaming from a lightning bolt shaped cut on his forehead. How did one so young survive when James and Lily, two of the best wix of their age, died? He was only an infant, barely even able to walk yet, let alone survive what surely must have been the killing curse, or something equally as terrible. </p>
<p>He picked the child up and held him close to his chest, whispering what he hoped were soothing words, and running a hand through his unruly jet black hair. He smelled like blood, plaster, and his bubble gum baby shampoo. And something else. He smelled like his home, like broom polish and cleaning supplies and like baking bread. A fresh wave of tears ran down.</p>
<p>“I’m gonna take care of you, Harry. Don’t you worry,” Sirius promised the small child. “I won’t ever let anything bad happen to you. And I’ll avenge your Mum and Dad’s deaths...” </p>
<p>“Padfoo’?” the baby asked quietly. “Padfoo’ stay?”</p>
<p>“Forever.”</p>
<p>~-~</p>
<p>Sirius woke with a start, gasping for air. He had had that nightmare for the past six years. Six years when he should’ve been caring for his godson, making due on his promise to Lily and James and, more importantly, Harry. Instead, he had left him with the first responsible adult he found, gave up his motorcycle, and went off in search of Peter Pettigrew. The rat. The traitor. The reason his best friend was dead, and his other friend hated him. </p>
<p>Another dementor floated down the hallway outside of his cell and he shivered. It was hard to tell time in Azkaban prison. There were no windows, and no real light to speak of. It was always cold, so it was impossible to tell the difference between the seasons. It always seemed to stay below ten degrees.</p>
<p>The same nervous looking squib came with his watery bowl of stew. It consisted of random chunks of beef, something that looked vaguely like butter, and some green plant matter that he didn’t like thinking about. He downed it quickly, because he really was hungry. The stew was never filling, and he only ever got one bowl a day. That would help him tell time if not for the meals being so inconsistent. He always got one bowl a day, but it was only whenever they felt like making the trek inside the prison to feed him.</p>
<p>He placed the dented tin bowl onto the floor after he had drained it, wiping his mouth with the back of a grimy hand. </p>
<p>“Make yourself presentable, Black. You’ve gotta visitor,” the man said, hurrying down to the next cell over. Sirius almost didn’t hear him. Did he say he had a visitor? Since when did he get visitors? He had only gotten two visitors his entire time in prison, one being his mother telling him how proud she was of him- the incident had left him feeling ill for days-, and the other being Remus, telling him in that deathly quiet voice that he adopted whenever he was furious that he hated Sirius and hoped he rotted in prison. Remus had only ever heard Remus use that voice twice, and never against Sirius himself. Not even when he had almost made Remus a murderer by sending Snape out to the Shrieking Shack. Who could this visitor be?</p>
<p>He got the answer to his question a few minutes later when Minerva McGonnagal, of all people, appeared outside of his cell. She looked as stern as ever, but she had a softness in her eyes that Sirius had never seen before. She reached out and put a hand on the bar of his cell.</p>
<p>“Black? Can you hear me, Mr. Black?” she asked him quietly. Sirius swallowed and nodded, rising to his feet on aching knees. He placed his grimy hand over hers on the bar. Minerva didn’t even flinch, though he was sure she could have to wash her hands at least three times to get the dirt off. He cleared his throat.</p>
<p>“H-hi,” he whispered. It hurt to talk, after being silent for so long. His voice was barely comprehensible, little more than a rasp. “M-Minerva?” He wasn’t sure why he was asking. Maybe to see if it was really real, if his old teacher was really there, right in front of him, holding his hand and- was she crying?</p>
<p>“Yes, Sirius. It’s me,” she answered. Sirius used his free hand to wipe at the corners of his eyes. </p>
<p>“W-why… Why are you here?” he asked. It felt so strange to be having a conversation with someone again, if this could be considered a conversation. He realised how much he missed talking to someone. The only times he ever used his voice were to scream during his nightmares. </p>
<p>“The Wizengamot has opened your case. You’re getting a trial. Everything is going well, and from the looks of it you’ll be out in about a week, but they need your statement.”</p>
<p>“My… my statement?” </p>
<p>“How you plea. Usually they would let you out of prison and take you to a courtroom for this, but if you do turn out to be guilty they don’t want you to be a harm to the public. Now. Did you betray James and Lily Potter?” she asked.</p>
<p>“No! No, I would- I would never do that! They were my best friends, I wasn’t even the Secret Keeper-”</p>
<p>“What?” Minerva asked sharply. “What do you mean you weren’t the Secret Keeper? Mr. Black, if it turns out you’re lying to me-”</p>
<p>“I’m not!” he sobbed, feeling rather like a child. “It was Peter! Peter was the Secret Keeper! Not me! Not- I loved James like a brother, I would never do anything to- and I would never leave Prongslet without a family, I wouldn’t-”</p>
<p>“Sirius, please calm down! It was only a question, I didn’t mean to upset you-”</p>
<p>“I would never betray James and Lily Potter!”</p>
<p>“I know, Sirius, I know! But you must calm down before you hurt yourself!” Sirius felt slightly unhinged. He could feel his magic crackling in the air, a palpable force. He forced it down, trying not to get worked up. There were Anti-Magic wards on the cell. Minerva was right. If he tried to do any magic, accidental or no, it would probably just rebound on him and he would end up hurting himself. </p>
<p>“I’m going to get you out of here, Sirius,” Minerva promised fiercely. “I swear it. I have to go, I believe my window of time is up, but I’ll be visiting you every day until you’re free.” Sirius nodded and Minerva squeezed his hand. “Be strong, Sirius. I’ll see you soon.” She turned and walked away briskly, her stern expression practically daring any dementors to go anywhere near her. </p>
<p>Sirius went back to his corner of the cell and rested his head against his knees. It was going to be a long wait before Minerva came back.</p>
