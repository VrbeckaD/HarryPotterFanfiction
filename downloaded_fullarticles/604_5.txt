    <p>Hermione decided that she needed time away from the wizarding world in Great Britain. She was struggling to figure out a way to get away. With her parents’ memories permanently erased, Hermione had nowhere to go except the Weasley house and Molly, bless her, was occasionally overbearing. </p>
<p>Hermione didn’t know what she wanted to do, but she knew she wanted to help save magical creatures. Ever since she freed the Gringotts Dragon, the feeling of not doing enough was wearing down on her.</p>
<p>She put emphasis on Care of Magical Creatures studies, wanting to do something with magical creatures.</p>
<p>During one of her classes with Hagrid, he brought in Charlie Weasley for a visit. Charlie brought a Common Welsh Green baby dragon with him. He had borrowed her from the British Dragon sanctuary.</p>
<p>Hermione fell in love that day.</p>
<p>Barely three feet long, the week old dragon was the cutest thing ever and Hermione was then dedicated to saving their lives.</p>
<p>Also that day, she fell in lust with the tall, muscular, untamable Charlie Weasley.</p>
<p>Watching him light up over dragons is what first attracted her to him. A man with a passion was incredibly sexy to Hermione.</p>
<p>The fact that he was physically hot was just an added bonus.</p>
<p>After class, Hermione approached him to say hi.</p>
<p>“Hello Hermione!” he said enthusiastically, grabbing her and hugging her tightly, raising her a foot up off the ground.</p>
<p>Hermione squealed in delight and laughed when he set her down.</p>
<p>“What can I do for you?” he asked as he wrangled the dragon back into her crate.</p>
<p>“Well Charlie, I think I just fell in love with dragons. And I want to work with them. How do I do it?”</p>
<p>Charlie broke out into a huge smile and gave her some information, then made plans to meet her at the Hogshead later that night.</p>
<p>Hermione struggled to figure out what to wear that night. She wanted to look nice and not like a student, but didn’t want to look like she was trying too hard.</p>
<p>After trying on many outfits, she settled on a black knitted jumper and a dark pair of jeans.</p>
<p>Slipping into her trainers, she pulled her hair back with a scrunchie. </p>
<p>She appraised herself in the mirror before quickly leaving.</p>
<p>As an eighth year student, Hermione was granted certain privileges, one of which was visiting Hogsmeade whenever.</p>
<p>She made her way down the stairs to the portrait and quickly made her way to the village.</p>
<p>She recognized Charlie’s bright red hair almost immediately. The fact that he was seated with Hagrid and McGonagall also helped.</p>
<p>Hermione headed to the bar first and ordered a firewhisky.</p>
<p>Many nights during the summer were spent with a bottle at her lips with George for company. They had tried to chase the demons away with liquor but it never worked.</p>
<p>She still built up a hell of a tolerance to firewhiskey.</p>
<p>Hermione knocked the glass back and ordered another.</p>
<p>She took the second glass to the table.</p>
<p>“Hello Charlie. Professor Hagrid, Headmistress McGonagall.” She said with a smile.</p>
<p>Hagrid stood and engulfed her in a bone crunching hug. McGonagall politely nodded and Charlie broke out into an ear-to-ear smile.</p>
<p>Hagrid and McGonagall quickly made their leave.</p>
<p>Charlie slid to the end of the booth and stood, hugging Hermione.</p>
<p>When he released her, they took their seats, across from each other.</p>
<p>They quickly got down to business. Charlie told her about an internship program that accepted five interns every year at the sanctuary.</p>
<p>Hermione took out a notebook and quill and took notes. </p>
<p>Charlie gave her suggestions on how to boost her resume and write her essay.</p>
<p>He assured her that she would already be ahead of the competition seeing how she was the savior of the wizarding world. Hermione still wanted to properly earn her spot.</p>
<p>By the time the night was coming to an end, they were both eight glasses deep into fire whiskey and Charlie was regaling tales of his time on the reserve.</p>
<p>“So there I was, wrestling a Romanian Longhorn named Jessie. She was looking for a good spot to nest, but was getting dangerously close to the territory of a nesting Ukrainian Ironbelly. I had to convince her to nest somewhere else, otherwise we were at risk of fights and crushed eggs. So she’s pissy cause she’s full of eggs and just wants to rest. Like any other pregnant bird, snappy and full of mood swings. So I got my arms wrapped around her snout, trying to keep her from breathing fire when the fucking Ironbell, Rose, shows up!”</p>
<p>Hermione giggled as Charlie finished the tale of how he wrestled 2 dragons into peace, got them separated, and protected the nests.</p>
<p>Hermione decided that she wanted that desperately.</p>
<p>She appraised Charlie’s strong, scarred, muscular arms, his broad shoulders, and the undoubtedly chiseled body he was hiding under his shirt. Hermione, in her inebriated state, decided she wanted to lick everyone of those scars.</p>
<p>“Wow, what you’re saying is I should work on physical strength as well.” She slurred.</p>
<p>Charlie nodded, his eyes glazed over, “Yes. You will literally wrestling dragons. You won’t be touching the adults, but you will be dealing with the babies and they’re still very strong.”</p>
<p>Hermione ordered them another round, and downed her drink when it came.</p>
<p>“If you don’t mind, how the bloody hell are you able to drink fire whiskey as if it were water?” Charlie asked, genuinely curious. </p>
<p>Hermione chuckled, “Many summer nights were spent with George in the garden, trying to drink away the demons. Never worked, but I built up a hell of a tolerance.”</p>
<p>Charlie grimaced, “How’s he doing?”</p>
<p>Hermione shrugged, “Better. He abandoned the bottle right before I did. Never worked for either of us, so we quit while we were ahead. But he’s seeing a mind healer. A therapist of sorts. It’s a pilot program where they’re employing muggle techniques like talk therapy to help war survivors deal with their issues. It’s working very well so far.”</p>
<p>Charlie smiled, “Why do I get the feeling that this was your idea?”</p>
<p>“Because it was. I struck while the iron was hot and pushed forward many muggle ways while I was a star I’m still a star but people truly listened at first. Now they just approach me in the street to gush. But that’s why the ministry is using pens and paper.”</p>
<p>“I’m sure my father is thrilled.” Charlie replied with a deep bellied laugh.</p>
<p>The next few moments were spent in silence, each one staring at the other with hooded eyes.</p>
<p>“What happened between you and Ron?” Charlie asked, addressing the elephant in the room.</p>
<p>“Nothing, we fizzled out quickly. We each had different goals in life, I wanted to finish my education and Ron jumped into the Auror program. It would have never worked. Ron was in training almost immediately, while I rebuilt Hogwarts. That’s just how it ended up.”</p>
<p>Charlie looked relieved “Thank Merlin” he whispered to himself.</p>
<p>Hermione raised an eyebrow at him. “Why do you ask?”</p>
<p>“Because you’re a fascinating woman and I may or may not be infatuated. I didn’t want to step on my brother’s toes though.” He forced out.</p>
<p>She laughed heartily. “Are you trying to take me to bed Charlie Weasley?”</p>
<p>Charlie found his footing again, “So what if I am?”</p>
<p>“I might say yes,” Hermione said quietly.</p>
<p>“What will make you say yes?”</p>
<p>“Another drink. I won’t lie to you, you’re gorgeous and I’ve been wanting to sink my teeth into you all day.” she purred.</p>
<p>Charlie felt himself grow hard as he groaned and quickly ordered their 10th round.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, after heavy flirting and intense game of footsie under the table, Hermione found herself stumbling upstairs to Charlie’s rented room where they started snogging as soon as the door was closed.</p>
<p>Charlie was a rough, but attentive man, taking charge, but making sure she was satisfied.</p>
<p>He pulled away with a groan and looked down at the little witch, “As much as I want to do this, I want to do it sober. You’re not the type of girl to only be a one night drunken stand.”</p>
<p>“What about a tipsy stand? I have some pepper up potion in my bag.”</p>
<p>Charlie groaned again and nodded, “Yes! But you’re still not a one night stand. We’ll talk about it more in the morning when we’re sober. I’m gonna do right by you.”</p>
<p>“Until then, slightly lowered inhibitions are good,” Hermione said. She accioed the potion from her bag which also had an undetectable extension charm on it and handed a bottle to Charlie who downed it quickly.</p>
<p>Hermione followed and was quickly on him as the bottles fell from their hands with a dull *thud* on the floor.</p>
<p>Charlie pushed her against the door and wrapped her left leg around his hip, burying himself between her legs. Hermione moaned as he bit her bottom lip and thrusted his tongue into her mouth.</p>
<p>Hermione pulled at the hem of his shirt, and Charlie complied, pulling away so she could remove it.</p>
<p>Hermione stared in awe, he was beautiful. A chiseled abdomen, scars marred his skin, but it only added to his perfection.</p>
<p>He groaned and pulled her jumper over her head and quickly unhooked her bra, pulling it off her body.</p>
<p>He bent his head and circled his tongue around her left nipple.</p>
<p>Hermione gave a soft moan and let her head fall back, thrusting her chest forward.</p>
<p>Charlie growled and picked her up by her bum, wrapping her legs around his waist. He lips returned to hers as he carried her to the bed</p>
<p>He laid her down gently and crawled on top of her, balancing his weight on his forearms.</p>
<p>His lips moved to her neck and he kissed her sweet spot, careful not to leave a hickey.</p>
<p>Hermione pushed him off of her and straddled him as soon as he landed on his back. She kissed her way down his chest, tracing some of his scars with her tongue.</p>
<p>Charlie had a bright red happy trail that disappeared under the waistband of his jeans.</p>
<p>Hermione unbuckled his belt and unsnapped his jeans, yanking them and his pants down to his knees.</p>
<p>He was ready for her, rock hard with a bead of precum at the head of his cock.</p>
<p>Hermione quickly wrapped her lips around his cock and began to bob her head up and down, her nose reaching the mass of red curls surrounding his cock.</p>
<p>Charlie groaned and his fingers buried themselves in Hermione’s wild hair, her ponytail having come undone ages ago.</p>
<p>He stopped her suddenly, “Baby girl,” he gasped. “If you don’t stop right now, I’m going to cum and the night will be over for both of us.”</p>
<p>Hermione reluctantly crawled off of him.</p>
<p>Charlie quickly kicked off his shoes and schucked off his jeans.</p>
<p>He crawled on top of her and snogged her senseless until he separated his lips from hers and made his way down to the hem of her jeans. He paused to give her breasts some attention.</p>
<p>Hermione gasped as Charlie unsnapped her jeans and pulled them and her knickers completely off of her. Her trainers were tossed across the room and charlie separated her legs, burying his face between her thighs.</p>
<p>Charlie was a man who knew exactly what he wanted and took it. Hermione’s quim against his tongue was no exception. </p>
<p>Her back arched as Charlie circled his tongue around her engorged clit. She was already soaked and ready for him.</p>
<p>Unlike men, women had a quick recovery time, and he wanted to make her cum before burying himself inside of her warmth.</p>
<p>Sucking on her clit, he inserted 2 fingers inside of her sopping wet cunt and went to work, steadily bringing her closer to the edge.</p>
<p>She was on the edge then Charlie nibbled at her clit and made a scissoring motion, bringing her to a screaming orgasm.</p>
<p>Charlie removed his head from between her legs and moved his way up her body.</p>
<p>“Are you ready for this?” He whispered huskily into her ear as he rubbed his cock against her sensitive clit, making her moan.</p>
<p>“Yes!” she gasped, her chocolate eyes shooting open and catching his electric blue eyes.</p>
<p>Charlie lined himself at her entrance and buried himself inside her in one swift motion.</p>
<p>Charlie held still for a few seconds to control himself. He took a couple deep, deady breaths before he started thrusting in and out of her cunt.</p>
<p>Hermione gasped as he filled her perfectly and hit her G-Spot.</p>
<p>Hermione’s arms reached behind her as she grabbed the headboard to keep some semblance of balance as Charlie fucked her senseless. </p>
<p>Charlie crashed his lips against hers as he fucked her hard, one hand tangled in her hair and the other one wrapped around her waist, pulling her as close as he could to her body. His fingers dug into her flesh, undoubtedly to be bruises in the morning.</p>
<p>Hermione’s hands left the headboard and dug into his back, her fingernails leaving crescent moon shapes in his skin.</p>
<p>Charlie groaned as he buried his face in her hair, inhaling her vanilla scent.</p>
<p>“Fuck you feel so good, Hermione.” he whispered. “I’m thrilled I ge to have my way with you. Fuck you’re amazing.”</p>
<p>Hermione moaned and made to puush him off of her.</p>
<p>“I want to be on top,” she said, almost pouting.</p>
<p>“Bloody hell,” Charlie swore as he rolled off her.</p>
<p>Hermione climbed on top of him and slipped his cock easily inside of her.</p>
<p>She rolled her hips and charlie thrusted up into her.</p>
<p>As always with this position, he slipped out a few times. It resulted in a few giggles. No matter how into your partner you are, sex is always awkward and funny.</p>
<p>Charlie held on long enough to make Hermione orgasm again, following her only moments later as her cunt clenched around his cock.</p>
<p>They snuggled in each other’s arms in the post-coital bliss, Hermione’s body curled into his.</p>
<p>His arms were wrapped around her small form.</p>
<p>They drifted into a blissful sleep, no nightmares for Hermione, and no restlessness for Charlie.</p>
