    <p> </p><p>He calls her his Dragon Girl, when she bites him as she comes.</p><p> </p><p>—ooo—ooo—ooo—</p><p> </p><p>Earlier on, at the start, she had flushed hot with embarrassment, or turned away, or been tempted to shout at him, but he wasn’t Ron, he wasn’t saying it to pick a fight, he wasn’t driving the knife in a little deeper about how she wasn’t quite /normal/ and couldn’t be quite /right/, that she wasn’t Lavender, that she was a girl but somehow she wasn’t the right kind of girl, the right kind of girlfriend- All the things that pet names had secretly meant, that she didn’t realize. He was looking at her-actually seeing her- with such staggeringly honest awe that it made her want to shrivel up and die in a new, novel, and not completely appreciated way. She didn’t know how to cope, that was the thing. Hermione had always thought that, with as many coping mechanisms that she had built up to deal- an entire life built around just <em>dealing,</em> always researching and imitating and trying to be Better, but without a moment of relief before the next wave of socialization and stimulation and struggle crashed down and left her abandoned, without a compass, but determined to Do Right, as she- that she was just… That she would always be a little bit dirty, a little bit scarred, and more than a little bit scared.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Earlier on, when this hadn’t meant anything to anyone, when it had been her, alone in the darkness, after the screaming and the spell-fire had faded and the weeping had run her raw, when she was hiding in a classroom far away from the wailing where she could sit in silence and try to process what to do, because even now, as she felt like her chest was going to rip in half, she was trying to Do The Right Thing- Because she loved them all, and because she loved them she was trying, carefully, to pour her emotions <em>outward</em> instead of <em>inward</em> (she had read once about the rings of grief, read once about how to Be Supportive through grief, how you couldn’t pour your grief inwards towards the people who had been more deeply affected than you, you had to let them pour their grief out towards you, and you could only pour out, away from the wound, like a scarlet bullseye of bleeding grief-</p><p> </p><p>But she couldn’t, because [Fred, and his wild joy that made the room light up, literally, surrounded by his brothers and mother and father and sister and absolutely choking on their sorrow, Filled Up and Pouring, Harry standing with them, a Weasley as well, and as stricken as they because there lay Lupin too, the last of his father’s Family, the last member of his and Sirius’ family, Tonks too, all one family, all one breath, Luna gone to find her father, Neville to find his grandmother-</p><p> </p><p>Her parents, blithe and blind to what she was suffering, completely unaware now, the way that they had only <em>seemed</em><b> </b>to be for most of her life] she had nowhere to pour her grief to.</p><p> </p><p>She had been slumped against the wall in the dark, trying to Remember, trying to be Helpful, be Good, to be anything other than as useless as she couldn’t help but feel- and she was holding them at arm’s length she knew, which wasn’t the Right Choice. If she was Better she would know what the right thing to do and she knew she was fucking up now by not being there was but she didn’t know how to be better and no one had told her, and all she felt was useless-</p><p> </p><p>When He had slammed the door open, the doorknob bouncing off the wall with a crack so loud that it fired off her battle-reflexes, (they had kept her alive, the PTSD wasn’t Post yet, wasn’t a Disorder, was just traumatic stress that she was barely surviving through, that had been ramping up since childhood and all through the Chamber of Secrets and Pettigrew and Cedric, oh Cedric, and Sirius and running and hiding and all the time, barely Coping ahead of the rising tide and most of the time just behind it, mouth full of seawater that was rich with blood) startling her up so fast that she nearly went out the window. Panting, face shadowed against the weak sunlight cast inwards from behind her, a matted-haired mess with no identity but wand out and level, shield spell already glittering, humming, wordlessly blue around her body and-</p><p> </p><p>face to face with another face that she could actually <em>read</em>, because it felt just as full of grief and rage and uselessness as she did, with nowhere to pour it to-</p><p> </p><p>He had reached for her automatically, not meaning anything more by it, just to catch her before she fell and she had flinched- because flinching was what had kept her safe through her childhood as a muggle who was Different, long before magic, back when she was bullied for info-dumping and reading under her desk and forced to make friends who were not friends, just barely tolerated her, at the recommendation of her Mum’s Friend From Med School- and had barely kept her safe as a Mudblood in a world that she didn’t have enough status to be considered Eccentric in, rather than Weird.</p><p> </p><p>He froze, in a pose that she later learned that was just as much an instinct for him as flinching was for her; after years of soothing magically-inclined siblings with no control and explosive tempers, followed by as many years soothing magically-infused monsters with less than no control over being literally explosive. Hands up, palms open, no wand, no threat, not coming close to even be within lunging range, legs balanced and wide so that he was braced enough that he could deal with a sudden onrush of sparks or flame or anything else that might be coming his way-</p><p> </p><p>But almost not enough, as it turned out, to deal with a traumatized 17 year old flinging herself at him and hugging him awkwardly but roughly with enough force to slam him into the doorframe.</p><p> </p><p>It was all she could think of doing, because she had been able to hide from the Family downstairs but if one of its’ members was going to present itself inescapably in front of her, she would try to redeem herself through Showing Care, and hugs were Care- only to realize, belatedly, that she had never hugged Him before, never in all the years she had stayed over at the Burrow or at Grimauld Place or at the weddi- [she redacted her brain, she wouldn’t go there, was a mistake], that she might be asking for Care instead of Caring, that this might be Pouring Inwards instead of Out-</p><p> </p><p>But then he was stroking her hair and saying words about it being alright and shhh and let it out and she felt the cold lance of fear go through her ribs, pooling nauseatingly through her guts to ricochet back up her esophagus- and she was jumping away again, horrified at taking from him, at Pouring In-</p><p> </p><p>Only to recognize the look on his face again, even more strangely, mirroring the same emotion that she felt- of being so lost to grief that all she could do was try to Help, and that she was somehow still fucking that up.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>—ooo—ooo—ooo—</p><p> </p><p>The silence was tense for some reason that Hermione, as weary as she was, couldn’t begin to summon the mental bandwidth to try to unpack. Instead she stayed put, between Him and the desk she had stumbled back against, panting as her heart rate slowly began to subside.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Charlie Weasley stood in the doorframe, dust turning his normally vividly orange ponytail grey, less like a banked fire than one reduced almost completely to ash. Burned through. Which could also describe the rest of him- drained, half dead, swaying on his feet. Hermione was shocked that she hadn’t knocked him over in her, in retrospect, obviously Stupid hug (what good was Care from her), but-</p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry.”</p><p> </p><p>The words hung in the air like lead shouldn’t be able to, but still were that heavy.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione stared, mouth hanging open, internal monologue frozen around the leaden words like a spray of icy mist; half formed, weightless, impossible to see or to think through-</p><p> </p><p>Because they hadn’t been her words.</p><p> </p><p>Charlie was still talking, elaborating, as she desperately tried to kick her brain back into gear, to process what was happening because nothing even remotely like it had ever happened before, ever, and she didn’t have the habits, didn’t have the pattern coded, so she couldn’t figure out what the aim was-</p><p> </p><p>“-dispel errant magical residue so no early patronuses got through, and then I had to get outside the range of the anti-Portus charms and then I had to go back to get my broomstick and once I got back it was almost over and you lot were all here, you were doing your best, you did your best, if i had been here i could have helped, i could have helped, but i wasn’t there for Sirius and I wasn’t there for Lupin and I wasn’t there for- I wasn’t there for— for—“</p><p> </p><p>He was out of breath and panting, staring at her, tears rolling down his face.</p><p> </p><p>“Merlin, Hermione, I’m sorry, I shouldn’t be dumping this on you, you’ve handled enough shite-.”</p><p> </p><p>When this hadn’t meant anything to anyone, but the shock of being looked at, and seen, and <b>known</b>, had meant that it couldn’t mean nothing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>—ooo—ooo—ooo—</p><p> </p><p>Every time, with him, felt like burning. Sometimes it was a low, slow, banked fire that you warmed your hands at all night, sharing company with a friend. Sometimes it was a grassfire, racing through her as she danced in the heart of it, because despite the terror and the risk as long as the hare kept racing she would never burn [GNU Terry Pratchett]. Sometimes it was a torch in the cave-darkness, never having seen sun, the only point of light that kept reminding her of where she was, where she stood.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>But it started as a wildfire- not from an escaping spark from the burning-but-contained wreckage that Hermione had been holding onto with both hands, after That Sadistic Arsehole (which is how she privately thought of Voldemort, as she didn’t want to call him by his name or any of his creepier nicknames) had gone running through so many lives with a flamethrower. She was successfully keeping it from spreading into an emotional underbrush that had gone uncleared for seventeen years, allowed to build up trauma and grief and loneliness and abandonment and isolation. She knew instinctively that that forest- guarded, secret, defended- couldn’t help but burn, once touched. So she dealt with that blaze, all the time ignoring the storm coming towards her, the lightning sizzling in its heart, other than as a vague hope for rain.</p><p> </p><p>It started with owls.</p><p> </p><p>Ron, hollow eyed and ashen, yet still screaming at her for not having the right words, for not knowing the right way to soothe, [for not being Lavender, and because no-one ever would be again, because she was in a small plot in her family’s graveyard, and she hadn’t gone to the funeral because of the rage in Ron’s eyes] in the kitchen of the Burrow, the only home that she thought that she had, [she hadn’t Fixed her parents yet, wasn’t sure that she could, wasn’t sure that she could put their memories back together the way her parents had felt them because her versions were never Fixed, never Okay too heavy with confusion and frustration and pain] burnt scrambled eggs in the pan in her trembling both with the weight of the cast iron [her parents used nonstick aluminum] and with exhaustion [it had only been 3 weeks, this was Pouring Out, Mrs. Weasley deserved a rest but Hermione had never cooked for 12 before, never this many meals or dishes, only the food on the run that she had only belatedly remembered that Ron hated as well].</p><p> </p><p>Standing in the silence of Grimauld Place, not really a home either but Harry had stayed with his Family, with Ginny, and hadn’t made eye contact with her during the screaming, but had pressed the front door key into her hand, giving her a way out, but not ashamed of not being able to handle the pressure of standing up for her. Had stayed behind because Ginny didn’t even resemble ash anymore, wasn’t even smoke, was so pale that she might as well have become a ghost- but being a Brother. Her adoptive brother, still loving unconditionally, but still flawed.</p><p> </p><p>So she had started crying again, this time huddled in what had been Tonks’ and Lupins’ room, because it was the room that felt the most lived in, the most loved- with the only photos of Teddy still with his parents that she’d ever seen on the nightstand and Hermione made a mental note to send them on to Harry when she awoke in the morning, for the memorial, but now she was too tired and too drained and all she could do was huddle up on their bed, hollow-eyed, and let the numbness overtake her, swallowing her down into the rough nothingness of sleep-</p><p> </p><p>And there was a tapping at the window.</p><p> </p><p>She awoke in the grey quiet of the dead house, mummified in blankets she had felt too Ashamed to crawl under properly. Unsure of how much time had passed, only that she was Ashamed for having taken even the edge off her grief in sleep when so few others could [everyone grieves in different ways but that doesn’t stop you feeling like your way is somehow the weakest], she went to the window to find a bedraggled, scorch-charred screech owl who looks as soul-weary as she feels. He hops onto the ledge, extends his leg, and then huddles, head under wing, to sleep. He doesn’t move when she closes the window behind him, too weary to hop. She has to carefully maneuver his tail feathers away from the lip as she lowers the window quietly, trying not to wake him.</p><p> </p><p>Putting aside the question of how an owl could be authorized under the Fidelius charm to ponder for another time [Does the sender have to be authorized? Or just the receiver? Or both? She’d love to experiment but she doubts anyone would be willing to participate in them with her], she unrolls the parchment, a scrap really, to find the ragged missive, clearly dashed off so quickly that the shaking is undisguised, in handwriting she’s never seen before but she knows on sight (the scorch marked bird really did help)</p><p> </p><p>“Sorry for “saying sorry for shite I didn’t do”, again, but he really is being a complete prat and while you must be the foremost expert, this is fucking absurd”.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione stares at the scrap, baffled for a moment- for the bird to have gotten here this fast, Charlie must have overheard Ron yelling, and gone straight to the roost where all the family birds now slept [Hermes, Pig, -not Hedwig, with a pang-, Errol, Fleur’s silvery Argent, Bill’s lean, golden Aten] and scrawled this on the first scrap of paper he could find, knowing both that she wouldn’t be in the room anymore by the time he tried to interfere, and that she wouldn’t have wanted anyone to.</p><p> </p><p>And they hadn’t spoken, really, since the not-so-useless hugging, because she hadn’t known what to say to his apologies because he didn’t need to make them, because he and she both needed a purpose and something to protect and, much to her confusion, he wasn’t trying to protect her. So they had sat silently in the room, Hermione crying silently, and Charlie with his head in his hands, sharing the quiet. Which had fed into a whole lot of sitting and sharing the quiet, because she didn’t know what to say, and neither, apparently, did Charlie.</p><p> </p><p>A feeling she can’t identify pops in her chest, somewhere between gratitude, relief, and misery; she knows from habit that this is probably pity, that this is someone trying to ease the tension and return everything to the way that it was before she was hurt, but… She very rarely is apologized to, in the process; Ron and Harry and Ginny and Lavender and Mrs. Weasley and her Mum and everyone always assume that a few kind words and a whole lot of denial make everything right- and it usually does, Hermione’s just grateful that she hasn’t been kicked out of the group yet, like she has so many times before [and her heart seizes, is that what happened? is this the only apology she sometimes gets? when she’s no longer welcome back and they’re making the polite noises that mean that she can never go home, and she wonders if it would be that bad, if she hadn’t been expecting this the whole time]</p><p> </p><p>And then she turns it over;</p><p> </p><p>“Do you want to talk?.”</p><p> </p><p>And she stares, because neither Ron nor Harry nor Ginny nor Luna nor Neville (her only real friends, and maybe she’s not being fair enough to Luna, she’s always been empathetic, but she prefers to draw things out gently and slowly like dilution and this is lancing a wound, this is stabbing at the heart to let it drain and people always get mad when she does that so it’s alien to have it done to you, and she knows why Neville would rather avoid, and maybe even Harry to an extent, because who wants to think about his family with a family like that ) ever ask that, and it’s not like she and Charlie did much talking either-</p><p> </p><p>She’s still standing there when Errol arrives, clearly having lagged behind more from the age of the bird than from the distance between writing the messages.</p><p> </p><p>“Or I could stuff him in Norberta’s feedbin, if that’s better”</p><p> </p><p>And standing there, smiling for the first time in what feels like years, until a second before alone in the grey, there’s a wind rising through the trees, and some embers start to roll.</p>
