    <p>Meet Aine Blackwood - A Force</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Gellert,” Aine pleaded, “Please allow me to come with you. No one has ever seen me so I can easily pose as the girlfriend of whoever you impersonate without raising any flags,” she explained, laying her hands on his vest.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He shook his head, “I won’t put you in that kind of risk, my love,” he added, “Also, I am going in as a high ranking MACUSA auror. How do you propose to be allowed near someone like that?” He ran his hand through her curls, an arrogant grin crossing his lips.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That sounds like a challenge, Grindelwald,” she replied, raising her brow, “If I am able to go to New York, now ahead of your plan, and procure such a position, will you let me join? You know this task is going to gain some attention,” she pointed out.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He gave her skeptical glance, visibly running her proposal through his mind.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Aine chose to add another point in her favor, “Darling, having a girlfriend will assuage any thoughts that you might not be who you are impersonating. Everyone thinks you and Dumbledore are in love, that fool still is anyway.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her comment caused another grin on Gellert’s lips, “Alright, leave now and if, when I arrive, you have become someone in MACUSA who ranks high enough to work with me, then you shall,” he leaned down and placed his lips to hers, letting them linger there, making sure she would want him while they were apart.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She pulled back, “You don’t have to do that, you know, I’ll want you no matter what. Even if we didn’t share a kiss before I leave,” Aine shot him a wink, “I’ll see you in New York, my love,” she turned and left without another word, making sure he would want her, in her own way.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Aine Blackwood got off the boat in NYC, breezing through customs, and heading straight for MACUSA in the Woolworth Building. She entered the organization like she owned the place, marching straight through to the President’s office.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She reached it, with surprisingly, no obstacles, opened the door, and began. “President Picquery, allow me to introduce myself. I am Aine Blackwood, an auror from London. I would like to work in your department of aurors,” she laid out her entire hand. She knew Grindelwald would choose the position of an auror because, to him it was ironic, and it was the best way to gain what he was after.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Seraphina Picquery was surprised by this woman, who had burst into her office with such confidence. “Do you have any references or a resume?” she asked, the only reply she could think of.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Aine handed her the information, doctored by a friend, before adding her last play into the equation, “I am aware that you were recently forced to demote an auror due to some policy breaking, so I know that you could use me. And, I am very good,” she smiled, “Catching dark wizards and witches is something I was born to do.” If Gellert could see her in this moment, he’d say something to the effect of ‘this is why I fell for you.’ Aine dismissed thoughts of Grindelwald to say focused on her task. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Picquery looked over the paper, Aine had created with magic, before looking back at the woman, “This all looks very good, and you’re right I do need you. I am willing to take a chance because we are up against dark forces right now. You’ll work directly with our best, Percival Graves. He is on assignment, but will be back this evening,” she stood, “I’ll guide you to your department and you can take the rest of the afternoon to get acclimated before he arrives.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Aine gave a simple nod in reply before following her new boss into the depths of MACUSA.</span>
