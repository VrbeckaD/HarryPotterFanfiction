    <p>The girl ran through the Louisiana woods, terrified.</p><p> </p><p>She was free of the Lab, yes, for the first time on her life, but she had no idea where she was going and the Bad Men were sure to be behind her.</p><p> </p><p>Where was she?</p><p> </p><p>It was nighttime but still warm, warm enough for her not to freeze to death in her hospital gown.</p><p> </p><p>Was this what the outside was like?</p><p> </p><p>She barrelled through the undergrowth, trying to stick to the softer parts because of her poor bare feet when-</p><p> </p><p>“Hello there, human.”</p><p> </p><p>El stopped and gasped as an enormous blond man appeared like a shadow in front of her.</p><p> </p><p>Summoning all the power she had, El wrenched the man’s arm so that it broke.</p><p> </p><p>There was the sickening hollow sound of a crack, and as it reverberated in the air, the man started to growl angrily.</p><p> </p><p>The man did not say a word, merely snapped the bone back into place.</p><p> </p><p>He flexed the arm stiffly, not broken any longer.</p><p> </p><p>“Now that’s not very nice…” he said in a dangerous voice.</p><p> </p><p>The man looked angry and a pair of fangs snapped downward out of his top guns, a livid white against the red of his mouth.</p><p> </p><p>El froze, terrified, as the expected trickle of blood ran from her nose and down her chin. He power was to be used sparingly, she knew that much.</p><p> </p><p>The man’s face softened a little, then he frowned, taking in her bare feet, shaved head and hospital dress and, presumably, the fact that this human-looking child had just broken the arm of an ancient vampire from eight feet away, without touching it.</p><p> </p><p>“My name is Eric Northman,” the man said, considering the tiny figure.</p><p> </p><p>He dared to step a little closer.</p><p> </p><p>“What is your name, human?” he asked gently as the dangerous-looking teeth retreated into his jaw with a clack. “Assuming that’s what you are…”</p><p> </p><p>He took in a deep breath through his nose.</p><p> </p><p>“You don’t smell quite human…” he muttered thoughtfully. “And breaking people’s arms with your mind isn’t exactly normal behaviour, I have to say…”</p><p> </p><p>He looked expectantly at the girl.</p><p> </p><p>She said nothing.</p><p> </p><p>“Name?” Eric prompted helpfully.</p><p> </p><p>Eleven gingerly stumbled forwards and showed Eric her arm.</p><p> </p><p><b>011</b>, read the tattoo.</p><p> </p><p>“What does this mean?” Eric asked, slightly impatiently.</p><p> </p><p>She pointed to herself.</p><p> </p><p>“Eleven?” Eric queried. “You are named ‘Eleven’?”</p><p> </p><p>She nodded.</p><p> </p><p>“And you don’t speak?” he clarified.</p><p> </p><p>She nodded again.</p><p> </p><p>“Well that’s refreshing,” Eric said cheerfully with a chuckle.</p><p> </p><p>But the chuckle soon tailed off. They could hear the thrum of an incoming helicopter.</p><p> </p><p>El looked panicked.</p><p> </p><p>“Bad Men!” she gasped, almost in tears as she squinted frantically at the sky.</p><p> </p><p>“So…you <em>do</em> speak?” Eric said slowly, trying to wrap his head around the little girl.</p><p> </p><p>Awwww, the <em>poor</em> little girl.</p><p> </p><p>“Come on,” Eric muttered, taking pity upon the shivering not-quite-human. “I’m sure my progeny would have a fit if she saw what you were wearing, lets get you safe and we can talk some more.”</p><p> </p><p>Not waiting for an answer, Eric sprang into action and Eleven had to stifle a scream as, in an instant, the man had swept her into her arms and leapt into the sky.</p><p> </p><p>They didn’t fall back down again.</p><p> </p><p>She was flying!</p><p> </p><p>Perhaps this man had escaped from the Lab too? Was he different like her?</p><p> </p><p>In flight, he turned to grin at Eleven and she managed a smile back.</p><p> </p><p>Friend.</p><p> </p><p>After a short while, they were flying over a more urban area. El marvelled at the lights and was so enthralled, she was almost disappointed when the leather-clad flying man began his descent. </p><p> </p><p>They landed in the parking lot of a building with no windows and El became afraid.</p><p> </p><p>“Lab?” she asked warily as Eric sauntered ahed clutching a pair of keys.</p><p> </p><p>“No, it’s not,” he said, stretching his arms wide like a showman. “This is my bar.”</p><p> </p><p>“Bar?” asked the girl with a furrowed brow.</p><p> </p><p>Eric smirked.</p><p> </p><p>“Come on, Number Eleven,” he said brightly. “Safety lies inside.”</p><p> </p><p>Slowly, Eleven followed the man with the invisible wings inside his…<em>bar.</em></p><p> </p><p>This place was different from the Lab <em>and</em> the forest. Eleven wondered why the ceiling needed so many metal poles to keep it up.</p><p> </p><p>She settled herself fugitively on one of the bar stools, wondering why the room was so red.</p><p> </p><p>“We’re closed for tonight,” Eric explained. “So that’s why it’s empty.”</p><p> </p><p>El nodded politely.</p><p> </p><p>“What would you like to eat, small human?” the man asked.“…I’m sure Ginger may have some snacks…”</p><p> </p><p>The man sped away like a blur and, after a loud rummage in another room, triumphantly produced a packet of Eggos.</p><p> </p><p>“Here, try these,” he said. “Nice for humans!”</p><p> </p><p>He smiled encouragingly.</p><p> </p><p>She did, she liked them.</p><p> </p><p>Eric grinned.</p><p> </p><p>“Can you get them out of the packet with your mind?” he asked interestedly.</p><p> </p><p>Eleven paused…then slowly closed her eyes as another Eggo rose in a laboured way out of the packet.</p><p> </p><p>El’s nose began to bleed.</p><p> </p><p>“Aaahhhh,” Eric said, a tissue suddenly in his hand. “Interesting. That…may be a problem here.”</p><p> </p><p>El looked at him in confusion.</p><p> </p><p>Why?</p><p> </p><p>“Let me get you some clothes,” Eric said. “Then I’ll explain.”</p><p> </p><p>He was beginning to realise that whoever these “Bad Men” were, they were unlikely to have told Eleven about the Great Vampire Revelation.</p><p> </p><p>Who were these Bad Men? And who was this girl?</p><p> </p><p>In but an instant, Eleven was holding a red Fangtasia T-shirt.</p><p> </p><p>“For you,” Eric said, amused at her bewilderment. “A present.”</p><p> </p><p>“Present?” Eleven repeated quietly, this time as a question.</p><p> </p><p>Eric nodded kindly. Eleven immediately went to yank her gown over her head.</p><p> </p><p>“Whoa! Hold it!” Eric said quickly, grabbing hold of her skinny wrist. “I usually <em>enjoy</em> watching a woman undress, but you seem a little <em>too</em> young. How about you go into the <em>bathroom</em> and change?”</p><p> </p><p>Eleven looked at him blankly. Had she taken meaning from any of that?</p><p> </p><p>“How old are you anyway?” Eric asked suddenly.</p><p> </p><p>“Old?” asked Eleven with massive eyes.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes,” said Eric gently. “How many years?”</p><p> </p><p>Eleven shrugged.</p><p> </p><p>“You?” she asked.</p><p> </p><p>“Over one thousand years,” he said casually.</p><p> </p><p>“One <em>thousand?”</em> El asked, agape with wonder.</p><p> </p><p>Eric chortled with laughter.</p><p> </p><p>“No a word of a lie,” he promised, hand over his still heart.</p><p> </p><p>Before El could repeat the word ‘lie’ in awe, they heard a helicopter pass overhead.</p><p> </p><p>“Bad Men!” El said with terrified shining eyes. “They’re coming!”</p><p> </p><p>“They won’t get you,” Eric said confidently.</p><p> </p><p>“But <em>yes!”</em> El said urgently, almost beside her little self with fear.</p><p> </p><p>Eric considered this poor little creature. You know, he could do with a new quest.</p><p> </p><p>“No, Eleven,” he said with a strange intensity. “They won’t.”</p><p> </p><p><em>“Why</em> won’t?” Eleven challenged back.</p><p> </p><p>“Because I am Eric Northman…” said the vampire, straightening to his full and rather impressive height.</p><p> </p><p>He grinned at the human.</p><p> </p><p>“…And<em> I </em>can be a bad man too.”</p>
