    <p>Narcissa scrolled through the usernames of the people who had viewed her profile. She hadn't gotten one message since she had signed up on the dating/friendship site this summer, she figured it was probably because she listed herself as married even though she had listed herself as wanting only friendship. She sighed lightly and leaned on her elbow, not minding the way she looked, as she was in a secluded area of the library mostly hidden by dividers.</p><p>Today she had finally decided to take the matter into her own hands, she was tired of having to look through books and webpages all the time, she wanted to interact with someone, even though it would be through a machine. She had first browsed the profiles of people who had spiked her interest, but most were eliminated instantly as they were interested in romance, the others probably wouldn't be interested in talking to her. Defeated, Narcissa stopped looking and went to her pretty bare profile; she did not want to give away too much, to see what she could alter to perhaps attract someone's attention. About 15 minutes into fruitless rereading, she noticed something she had not seen before- a button that brought her to a list of usernames of people who had viewed her profile.</p><p>There were quite a few more names than she had expected, hence proving to Narcissa that her profile was not interesting enough for someone to message her. Most of the listed names only appeared once or twice, although she did notice a name that showed up fairly often: Bearhug. She smiled briefly, they were currently logged on, so, before she lost her nerve, Narcissa sent an icebreaker message:</p><p>NarcissusPoeticus: You've been stalking my profile for a while now. Why?</p><p>It took so long for Bearhug to reply Narcissa had nearly logged off the computer.</p><p>Bearhug: I'm not sure...</p><p>NarcissusPoeticus: Do you have time to talk?</p><p>Bearhug: Yes</p><p>NarcissusPoeticus: Do you want to talk about any subject in particular?</p><p>Bearhug: Not really.</p><p>Narcissa was trying to think of something else to write. She certainly didn't want to end the conversation there. She had decided to take a quick look at Bearhug's profile when Bearhug sent another message:</p><p>Bearhug: Your status says you're married with a child, how come you have so much time to talk?</p><p>Narcissa was not surprised by that question. There's a section on someone's profile that says when a user is logged in, and most likely almost every time Bearhug had gone to her profile she would see her as "logged on."</p><p>NarcissusPoeticus: My son goes to a boarding school and, frankly, things aren't very nice at home right now.</p><p>Bearhug: Ah</p><p>Truth be told, Narcissa didn't want to go home to the Death Eaters, ever, which is why she spent most of her time away from home when Draco was at school. Her home had gone to the dogs. Usually she went to different parks or the wizarding libraries but one day, whilst on one of her outings to avoid the Manor, she had accidentally walked into a muggle library. She had been secretly delighted to have access to much different reading material. She had found it fascinating how muggles lived without magic and found what they thought of the magical world hilarious, but entertaining. It took her a of couple weeks but she finally found the courage to sit down at a muggle computer. After a couple of days of learning how it worked, she had decided to try it as an outlet, and it worked.</p><p>She scanned Bearhug's profile to try and get the quiet, as it turns out, woman, to talk some more. Her profile was bare, she was a woman from Japan and she was 38. That was it.</p><p>NarcissusPoeticus: Do you have any family?</p><p>Bearhug: A mother, 2 sisters and an incredibly large extended family. And you, do you have anyone else besides your husband and son?</p><p>NarcissusPoeticus: Two sisters.</p><p>Narcissa hesitated before typing, Bearhug had not given much information about her sisters, but she wanted to give more, needing the outlet. She figured it would be safe to talk to someone through a machine who lives almost on the other side of the world and that she will probably never meet.</p><p>NarcissusPoeticus: One is estranged and I fear the other is losing her sanity.</p><p>Bearhug: I'm sorry.</p><p>Just as Narcissa was about to type some more, Bearhug typed:</p><p>Bearhug: I'm sorry, I have to go bring my little sister to her doctor's appointment. Talk to you this time next week?</p><p>NarcissusPoeticus: Can we talk sooner?</p><p>Bearhug: I don't know if I'll be able to get to a computer sooner but I'll see if I can.</p><p>Narcissa sighed as she watched Bearhug's green online symbol turn red. She dreaded going home, but didn't have anything else to do to waste time. Perhaps she could write to Draco when she got home?</p>
