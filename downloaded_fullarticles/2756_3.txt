    <p align="center">All his life as far as he could remember the only thing that Severus wanted was to be happy. Sure he had his best friend Lily who was in fact his only friend in this miserable place called Spinner's End. But those happy moments with Lily seemed to be always over shadowed by the bad. Now you'll find yourself asking why this boy who should be happy but was instead miserable would be his home life.</p><p align="center">The reason is his father. You see Severus's father, Tobias Snape, was a very  cruel drunk and when he's not saying hurtful things in a drunk stupor he's acting out on beating poor Severus. Now your wondering why Severus's mother isn't doing anything to stop this the truth is she died when Severus was three years old. The only thing that he could remember about her was her smile and a gentle lullaby she used to sing to him along with a few stories she told about her time in Hogwarts and the adventures she had with her Pokémon. There were also her worn old books she had from being a Hogwarts student that Severus poured over and corrected but Sadly all her Pokémon had died as well all except for two, a Froslass and a Petilil, both are quiet young but they brought so much joy to a boy who no longer knew what his mother looked like and not know the true joy of being well loved and cared for.</p><p> </p><p align="center">If your wondering why Severus other relatives didn't take him in its because he had none on his father's side and his mother ran from her's so to be honest Severus really didn't know if his relatives even knew about him or if they all died. But well get into that later into the future for now lets focus on the present. Severus and Lily along with the two Pokémon where playing when suddenly a creature that Lily had never seen before landed right in front of them. "What is that" whispered Lily in awe. "That's a Mandibuzz its a Pokémon" said Severus as he noticed the Pokémon carrying a card, "Hey Lily take a look at this" Severus showed her the card.</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">
