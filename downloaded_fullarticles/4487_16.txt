    <p>Flowers had always been a passion for Remus. His father owned a small flower shop in his hometown and Remus remembered all the times his father took him to the shop with him, teaching him all the small tricks he had for the best flowers. Remus remembered one day he was playing with a rose and starting plucking it’s petals off, he was around five. He reminisced how his father sad him down and told him how flowers had lives inside them as we all do and how Remus was taking the beauty of it by doing something like this, it was fun for Remus but what good did it do to have a petalless rose? After that he didn’t even step on grass if he didn’t have to.</p><p>When Remus moved to the big city, he had the intention of having a small place and sell beautiful flowers to beautiful people. Each flower had their own meaning, the same flower could mean a thousand different things. Remus had sold the same flower for a wedding and for a funeral, that’s what he loved about flowers. They were beautiful the way they were but the meanings people gave to them made them divine. Having a flower shop in the city wasn’t the best paying job but he loved what he was doing and he was getting by just fine. </p><p>After preparing a bouquet for a woman around her 40s so she could take it to her mother, he decided to sit down for a bit. The lunch break was over so he thought there wouldn’t be many people coming until rush hour. He sat down at his chair and started reading his book from where he left off. </p><p>It hadn’t been 15 minutes when he heard the familiar chime of the bell above his shop’s door. He lifted his head up to say hello but choked on his words when he saw the person who walked in. He was shorter than Remus, had shoulder length black hair. He was wearing a leather jacket on top of very skinny black jeans that were ripped at the knees and a white t-shirt. Remus felt his jaw drop as the stunning stranger took of his Ray-Bans and gave him a smile.</p><p>“Hello,” he said. His voice was smoke filled and as he looked around Remus saw a tattoo around his shoulder climbing up to the back of his neck. He swore under his breath and smiled back.</p><p>“Hello,” he said as he put down his book and stood up. “What can I help you with?”</p><p>The stranger turned his gaze on him and licked his lips before speaking again. Remus wasn’t sure what was going on right now but if this gorgeous man didn’t stop looking at him the way he did, he was going to die. He could feel his cheeks go red as he looked at the man with grey eyes. </p><p>“I would like to buy a single red rose please,” he said with a slight smirk on his face. Remus nodded and he passed by his <em>customer</em> to get to where the roses were. He smelled like what dreams were made of, he held his breath to keep himself from burying his head where his tattoo ended.</p><p>“Will this be all?” he asked trying to hide his senseless lust as well as he could. “Is there a colour your girlfriend likes?”</p><p>“Oh, no no,” he laughed and Remus thought the world peace was finally achieved. “It’s for my mother. I want to present it to my mother as she mourns the loss of my presence under her roof.”</p><p>“Oh,” stuttered Remus. That was a weird information to share with a florist but he prepared the rose, cut off the thorns and gave it to apparently rebellious man. “It will be 3 pounds.”</p><p>The black haired man took out the money from his pocket and put it in Remus’ hand, his hands were so cold it made Remus shiver. </p><p>“Thanks,” he said with a grin and left the shop, leaving behind a flabbergasted Remus and he felt thankful for skin tight jeans as the family disappointment walked out to disappoint his mother one last time.</p><p>Remus spent the next three days hoping that his gorgeous customer comes but after that he lost hope and cursed at his own luck. </p>
