    <p>It started as hushed whispers followed by brushing of noses and kisses behind sealed bed curtains. It was all for run really, until it started escalating and Albus found himself in his best friends lap, kissing him with tongue and everything. It was already the third time this week that they had found themself in this position and it was only Tuesday night. </p><p>He felt Scorpius’ hand slip underneath the back of his sweater and felt chills travel up his skin at the cool touch. He tightened his fingers into Scorpius’ hair and kissed him harder. Scorpius in turn gripped Albus’ hips and attempted to pull him closer, grinding their hips together. That’s when Albus realized there was a tent straining in Scorpius’ trousers.</p><p>Excitement flickered inside him but before he could go further, or try to do anything about it, Scorpius pulled away breathlessly, his hands slipping from Albus’ hips to his chest in attempt to push him away.</p><p>“Are you okay?” Albus asked, his own breathing short and erratic. Scorpius had never pushed him away like that before.</p><p>Scorpius sat back, shifting his trousers to try and suppress or hide his problem, “I... I think we should maybe stop.”</p><p>Albus cocked his head, giving Scorpius a confused look, “What? Why?”</p><p>“Because,” Scorpius started hesitantly. Before he could explain Albus spoke up again.</p><p>“Is it Rose?” His voice was quiet, almost begging Scorpius to deny it.</p><p>Scorpius turned away, barely nodding.</p><p>Albus felt his stomach fall and his skin itch, but he wasn’t sure why. “Are you going to ask her out... again?”</p><p>“Well, not exactly. It’s more like she’s asked me out. To Hogsmead next weekend,” He explained almost guiltily.</p><p>“Oh,” Albus squeaked. He slowly climbed off of Scorpius’ lap, moving to lean against the headboard next to him. “That’s great,” he tried but the tone of his voice betrayed him, and it was obvious he didn’t think so</p><p>“Yeah...” Scorpius tried to ignore Albus’ disappointed tone. He then turned to Albus hopefully, “I can say no.”</p><p>Albus cast him another confused look, “Why would you do that? You’ve fancied her since year one. Now is your chance.”</p><p>Scorpius eyed Albus up and down for a moment, “Yeah... No, why would I?” He chuckled awkwardly, fiddling with his hands as he slouched back against his headboard.</p><p>“So you’re telling me, no more of... this,” Albus mumbled, gesturing between them.</p><p>An apologetic frown covered Scorpius’ face, “Probably. Is that okay?”</p><p>“Oh yeah,” Albus replied quickly, “It’s totally fine, ‘cause I’m not - <i>you know.” Gay.</i> He wanted to say, because he definitely <i>wasn’t gay.</i> Nope.</p><p>Scorpius caught onto what he meant, “Oh yeah, no. That’s... fine yeah.” He didn’t sound as convinced as Albus had.</p><p>“Great,” Albus shifted, “Well, I probably have some homework to go to, or something,” he coughed awkwardly and climbed off Scorpius’ bed. “I’ll be in the library,” he mumbled.</p><p>He cursed to himself as he snatched up his backpack, not even sure if the right assignments or books were inside. He couldn’t deal with this right now. Albus wasn’t build to deal with emotions and thoughts very well, and he was already confused enough about why he enjoyed kissing Scorpius so much, he didn’t need Scorpius to remind him about how stupid those feelings were. He needed a distraction - and what was a better distraction than homework?</p><p>He made it to the library in record time.</p><p>••••</p><p>Albus tried not to watch as his best friend huffed over his robes. He was sat on his bed, his arithmancy book resting on his lap as he attempted to study. It was Saturday, it had been four days since Scorpius had called their... <i>thing</i> off, whatever it was. Whatever kissing and cuddling with your best friend platonically was. That was the longest they’d gone without physical contact like that since they started experimenting and fooling around with each other at the end of their sixth year.</p><p>Scorpius, who was standing at their mirror, glanced back at him, a curious look on his face, “Aren’t you coming down to Hogsmead?”</p><p>Albus furrowed his brows as if Scorpius was daft, “You know I don’t care for Hogsmead.”</p><p>Shrugging, Scorpius turned and stepped closer to Albus’ bed, “Yeah, but I figured you’d want a change of scenery, get out of the castle for a bit...”</p><p><i>‘So I can watch you snog my cousin?’</i> Albus wanted to retort with, but instead he simply said, “I want to get a start on the essay for Arithmancy.”</p><p>He couldn’t be bitter - he didn’t even know what to be bitter about, it wasn’t like he actually fancied Scorpius. They were just friends and that’s all they would ever be. He knew from their fourth year that somehow Scorpius would end up with Rose anyways. Even though Scorpius was openly bisexual, he still wouldn’t choose Albus who was straight. <i>Was he though? Albus couldn’t figure it out.</i></p><p>Scorpius gave him an uncertain look, knowing that starting homework early was very uncharacteristic of Albus, “That’s not due till next month... Even <i>I</i> haven’t started it.”</p><p>He couldn’t be gay, no. Harry would think he was even more of a disappointment than he already is, the Slytherin Squib. He’d always thought he’d marry a woman - he’d never even thought about guys that way. However, now that he did think about it, Isaac Carlton had nice hair and Sean Thomas-Finnegan had nice hands... <i>Hands?</i> You don’t even look at <i>girls’</i> hands. Hair, maybe. But not hands. <i>Scorpius also had nice hair and hands...</i></p><p>“I - I,” he stuttered, “I don’t want to procrastinate and fall behind this semester.”</p><p>Another wary look was shot Albus’ way. “Okay. I’m not going to stop you from trying to have good study habits, but I have to admit it’s rather shocking,” he smiled, attempting to joke with Albus but the other boy barely cracked a smile, his mind too preoccupied with other things. </p><p>Scorpius took the lack of response as his cue to leave. “I’ll find you when I get back and you can help me with that essay, yeah?” He smiled hopefully.</p><p>Albus nodded, “If you’d like.”</p><p>“Great,” Scorpius beamed, then rested his hand on Albus knee for a short moment before turning away and saying good bye.</p><p>Albus was left to brood and overthink his emotions. He definitely wasn’t going to start that essay.</p><p>••••</p><p>It was around midnight when Albus glanced up to see the Giant Squid slowly swimming past the common room windows, it’s massive eye staring directly at him. It was a rare sight, everyone usually flocked to the windows in awe as it passed.</p><p>But right now, no one was jumping up to see it as they were all asleep in their dorms. Albus would’ve gotten up had Scorpius’ head not been resting on his arm, the blonde passed out asleep.</p><p>The two had been studying for their potions exam when about forty-five minuets ago Scorpius began dozing off. Albus hadn’t moved since the moment his best friends head hit his arm and he didn’t have any plans on moving soon. Even when he had started getting cold, he accio’d a blanket for them.</p><p>His arm was starting to get tingly but he was willing to have it go numb before he woke up Scorpius and ruined this peaceful moment. Albus wasn’t trying to hide the fact that he’d been staring at his best friend and admiring the clam expression he held as soft breaths escaped through his slightly parted lips. His soft blond hair hung haphazardly in front of his eyes. He had showered before they began studying around eight o’clock, and his hair had dried in its natural fluffy state that Albus loved.</p><p>Albus gently reached his free hand up and softly combed his fingers through Scorpius’ hair, pushing it out of his eyes. His heart fluttered with fondness for a moment before it was quickly replaced with a sinking feeling in his stomach.</p><p>
  <i>Oh Merlin, maybe he did fancy Scorpius. It would make sense.</i>
</p><p>He quickly pulled his hand from Scorpius’ hair and glanced back up at the windows to see the last of the squid swimming away. He could feel his heart pounding in his chest but he couldn’t decipher if it was out of excitement for being so close to Scorpius, or dread for the fact that he was definitely crushing on his best friend and had probably been for a while.</p><p>He couldn’t like Scorpius though, he was with Rose now, officially. They had gone on a few dates to Hogsmead - inviting but not <i>really</i> inviting Albus each time. They had also both written to their parents announcing their relationship. That had made Albus sick, especially when Ron didn’t reply with a Howler like he had hoped.</p><p>Next to him, Scorpius shifted at Albus’ sudden jerk. He must not have been sleeping to heavily because he groaned softly and shifted back into a sitting position, rubbing his hands over his face.</p><p>“What time is it?” he mumbled.</p><p>“Dunno,” Albus avoided eye contact, staring ahead as he tried to will his heart to slow down. It didn’t seem to be listening.</p><p>Scorpius reached down to the floor where his wand had fallen and noticed Albus’ change in mood since before he fell sleep. “What’s the matter?”</p><p>“Nothing,” he replied shortly, barely glancing at Scorpius before turning his gaze to his lap awkwardly.</p><p>He could feel Scorpius fondly rolling his eyes next to him as the blonde shifted, pulling one leg under him as he turned to face him, “Al, don’t lie to me. Am I not your best friend?”</p><p>Albus actually turned towards him this time, his insides fluttering at Scorpius’ sleepy-puppy dog eyes. The blond yawned, a cute sound escaping his mouth as he tried to cover it with his hand and Albus knew he was fucked. He definitely fancied Scorpius, why else would he find a yawn cute?</p><p><i>‘It’s you, you’re what’s the matter,’</i> Albus wanted to say. “It’s just, there’s someone I think I fancy, but I can’t fancy them, so I’m very conflicted,” he answered honestly.</p><p>Scorpius gave him a curious and almost proud look, “Really? Who is it? Why can’t you fancy them?”</p><p>Dodging the second question he replied, “I can’t fancy them ‘cause they’re already taken.”</p><p>Still oblivious, Scorpius sighed understandingly, “Ah, I see.”</p><p>“Shall we head to bed? It’s got to be rather late,” Albus quickly changed the topic.</p><p>“Oh yes,” Scorpius suddenly remembered his intentions of checking the time. With a wave of his wand he informed Albus that it was nearly half past midnight.</p>
