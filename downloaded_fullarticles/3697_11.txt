  <em>Somewhere on the road to Bree</em>
</p><p>Why,oh why,had Dumbledore sent me here? I couldn’t see ten feet in front of my face,it was wet,it was fecking <em>foggy,</em>and I only had 140 galleons,a few changes of clothes,a water skin,and a Scroll of Alimentary Conjuration to my name. The one good thing about the situation was that the Sun was barely above the horizon,so a long day was ahead of me.</p><p>———</p><p>The situation improved as the day went by. </p><p> </p>
