    <p>Sounds of frustrated noises echoed with a slight curse.</p><p>“I lost again.” Harry lamented staring at the table dejectedly, the pieces sitting on the board remained in place, however, his pieces were mostly gone with the other’s pieces taking up most of the board. It had been a pleasant game of strategy reminiscent of chess back in his own world; having played various matches with his friend Ron, losing every single time, he had learned a thing or two about planning and using different methods to achieve victory. He scowled slightly and sighed, giving an apologetic glance to his opponent. “Sorry. I thought this time I would have been able to give you a better challenge.”</p><p>Robin hummed nonchalantly. “You did better this time around. You’re steadily learning.” The tactician informed, pleasantly.</p><p>“You think?” Emerald hues hopeful.</p><p>“I do,” Robin responded, idly. “You’ve got the knack for adapting when the pushing comes and quick to analyze the field. As a tactician, it is my job to come up with different strategies to ensure victory on the battlefield with the Shepherds and applying them in an effective, diligent manner. Of course, I’m merely one person with a finite possibility down the line. When in battle just about anything can happen, no matter how many strategies one comes up with there is still a chance that all can go wrong. Remember there is no such thing as a full proof plan but that does not mean you can’t come up with backups if one plan fails.”</p><p>Oddly that provided some comfort even with the ideas and thoughts dwelling in his mind to counteract Robin’s strategies and fought back with all his might, revealing how tenacious that Harry could be when push came to shove. It brought him some relief that despite difficulties with the games shared between them, that his own tactics were not wrong or horrible rather need tweaking and development. Games were far different from that of an actual battle being on the field might be under pressure of a fight and the weight of not only his life on the line but the weight of those whom he fought beside and the many innocence’s, perhaps that had been why he rather than Ron had been brought into this strange mess; having the nerves and the understanding of war to endure the duties thrust upon his shoulders. Not that it had been pleasing to be snatched away from his home and brought into a war against his will, nevertheless, his pride would not allow him to turn away from those that needed to be helped. The role had been that of a summoner and tactician leading the group of heroes from realm to realm to fight against this strange… force which threatened the balance of all their homes. Everyone was involved in the fight.</p><p>Nevertheless, did not stop him from desiring to do something more than merely provide orders in battle while forced onto the sidelines unable to help in battle. His duties as summoner gave the rest of them a boost in power through combat against the dark forces, his own magic from his home proved to be useful and intriguing to others.</p><p>It brought forth his own inexperience in battle after witnessing their strength time, and time again. Pumping his own desire to grow stronger, fighting with them rather on the sidelines, his powers as summoner prevented him from moving to the field with them forcing him into a supporter position, why that was? No one seemed to completely understand the role of the Summoner and what came with that duty. It had been irritated to be forced to watch as his… well, Harry still did not know whether to call them friends or allies, fight while being able to do nothing other than provide orders and support. It sucked. Honestly.</p><p>Harry curled his fingers by the hems of the white robe. “I feel like there is still a lot that I need to learn.”</p><p>“You say that like that’s a bad thing.” Robin astonished lightly. “There isn’t anything wrong with wanting to learn, to grow stronger and better.”</p><p>“And yet, I can’t fight along with you guys in battle,” Harry remarked, bitter.</p><p>The tactician’s eyes softened. “You are our summoner and you do a lot for us. Let us worry about the battle.”</p><p>“Still not happy about it,” Harry responded.</p><p>“Somehow…” Robin laughed sheepishly. “I’m not too surprised.”</p><p>A long drawn out sigh passed from his lips. It had been nice that the man had been trying his best to raise and put his worries aside, however, he had never been the type to simply allow others to fight his battles preferring to jump straight into the fry. It had been a rough transition from fighter to what he was doing now.</p><p>“I’m sorry.” Harry’s head shook. “I know that you’re trying to raise my spirits, and all it’s just… hard. I’m so used to fighting.”</p><p>Robin’s lips twitched in understanding. “It must be hard forced to be idle while others are proactive in combat.”</p><p>“It is.” Along, insufferable sigh in agreement. “I hate it. I want to do more.”</p><p>A humourful laugh erupted from Robin’s throat. “Don’t despair. When I first joined the Shepherds all I thought I could provide were my tactics in battle, sure I could wield a sword decently and cast thunder magic but overall, I was leagues behind everyone else. Just as you are now. It might seem like a long road, trust when I say I know exactly where you are coming from. As each battle had been thrown at us my resolve to stand as their equal bolstered, the desire to be a true member of the Shepherds. So, I did what was necessary; I trained. Swordplay and magic. Putting my all into my training, and forging bonds with them.”</p><p>“Forging bonds?”</p><p>Robin’s smile became wistful. “Yes. It sounds rather corny, doesn’t it? But that’s what Chrom always said. That the bonds between us would deepen and grow stronger. At first, I thought it had been a bit too naïve, but time and time again proved me wrong; that bonds are not only important but helps in times of need.”</p><p>Apart of him agreed full-heartedly that it had been cheesy – bonds, building them with people whom Harry did not truly know yet the other part of him disagreed pointing out how far he pushed himself for their shake; trying to lighten their load from each battle. There had been little more during battle which Harry could do thus did tedious labour, cleaning weapons and even cooking; little things that truly mattered at the end of the day. It eased their load no matter how small of things were and helped the group to have a chance of respite after battle. It struck him odd at how quickly he started to warm up to them, usually takes quite a bit of time before allowing himself to be cosy to others. Time and time again had taught him to keep his guard up and be wary of those with ulterior motives, however, most of them came to ensure that their worlds would not be subjected to slavery and destruction. For that, maybe putting aside his wariness would be ideal.</p><p>It would not be easy. His stubbornness had a habit of butting in at the wrong times though same could be said of his shyness as well making a rather bad combination.</p><p>“I could always ask Chrom to give you a pep talk,” Robin suggested, eyes twinkling madly with amusement.</p><p>Harry gawked. “Please don’t. Much as I like Chrom, he isn’t exactly erm… good with words. Unless when it’s needed.”</p><p>“That’s true!” The tactician howled a laugh. “He does have a habit of stuttering and putting his foot in his mouth often. It’s a sight to behold, truly.”</p><p>“Here I thought you two were friends.” Harry teased, mouth twitched into a smile.</p><p>“We are.” Robin’s eyes continued to dance. “But I’m not above teasing.”</p><p>“You two sound really close.” Watching them from the sidelines seeing the way Robin and Chrom interacted with one another the two were always on the same wavelength knowing exactly what the other had been thinking on and off the battlefield, in a way Harry felt rather envious. While his friendship with his friends back home was not something to sneeze at, in a way it resembled the friendship that they had.</p><p>Robin blinked and flushed briefly before responded blithely. “Ah, well yes. Many of said that about us and I quite agree; Chrom’s and my friendship is something that I hold dearly. I wouldn’t be where I am now without him.”</p><p>“Because he found you?”</p><p>“That’s a reason yes,” Robin confirmed, honestly. “He… was there when I was alone; barely knowing anything other than my own name barely able to fight and yet he encouraged me. Pushed me to grow stronger, to fight by his side and protect Ylisse despite the urges from Frederick. In fact, believe it or not, he once thought of me as a spy and threatened me on numerous occasions. And now? He’s one of my closest and trusted allies; even if he is… eccentric.” He added, laughing.</p><p>Harry snorted. “That’s one way of putting things. Frederick’s pretty damn persistent.”</p><p>“I know.” He drawled sardonically with a glint of empathy. “Frederick does mean well but…”</p><p>“He goes a bit overboard?” Harry supplied.</p><p>The tactician coughed, sheepishly. “That’s one way of putting things; yes.”</p><p>“Well,” Harry felt his mouth beginning to curve into a large smile. “I think I know exactly who to send Frederick after now.”</p><p>Robin almost cried. “Harry!”</p>
