<p>07:12 AM – Good morning my dear followers! The whole world is holding its breath today as Prince James and Princess Lily are set to meet again. The 21-year-old royals have attracted a worldwide fanbase after their previous seven - and very memorable - encounters. I’ll keep all of you up to date on this exciting day!</p>
<p>07:18 AM – First of all, a quick summary of the events that have preceded this day. After the scheduled reunion was announced, a so-called Jily Royalty Fest was set up by the devoted fans of the young royals. (Jily is a combination of the first names of Prince James and Princess Lily.) These fans have gathered in front of the palace, sleeping in tents and right now they happily await the scheduled balcony scene at two o’clock this afternoon.</p>
<p>07:31 AM – Excited squeals fill the grounds in front of the balcony as the doors to the balcony are opened. Cleaners make their way on the balcony, leisurely sweeping the floor.</p>
<p>07:45 AM – Perhaps some of you are unfamiliar with the history of the previous events at which Prince James and Princess Lily were scheduled to meet. Prince James, heir to the British throne, has met Princess Lily of Ireland a total of seven times so far.</p>
<p>8:01 AM – Ten years ago – both young royals were 11-years-old at the time – the first encounter between Prince James and Princess Lily took place. Accompanied by their parents and Princess Lily’s sister – Princess Petunia, the heir to the Irish throne – they opened an exposition at The British Museum: “<em>Great Britain and Ireland: A United History</em>”.</p>
<p>8:04 AM – The three young royals were scheduled to open this exposition ten years ago by cutting the ribbon with a large pair of scissors. However, Prince James managed to cut a hole in Princess Lily’s mint green dress.</p>
<p>8:11 AM – “It was the beginning of a turbulent relationship between the two royals,” argues Bathilda Bagshot, author of <em>A Peek Inside The Palace</em>. “The Irish queen has had to deal with quite a few tantrums after that incident.”</p>
<p>8:32 AM – I have just spoken with three lovely ladies who were one of the first to set up their tent in front of the palace. “We’re just so excited,” said Alice Prewett, her blond hair wrapped up in a messy bun on top of her head. “It’s what we’ve been waiting for ever since the last meeting,” agreed the tall Marlene as Mary MacDonald – president of the Jily Club – reveals that she has a feeling this may be the most exciting encounter between the pair of royals yet!</p>
<p>8:59 AM – The Jily Club believes in the possibility of a romance between Prince James and Princess Lily. “They complement one another,” says Mary MacDonald, the previously mentioned president of the Jily Club. “You can just tell that they would make a great couple!” The Jily Club has thousands of followers all over the world, although no exact numbers are known.</p>
<p>9:23 AM – We have just received word that the private jet of the Irish royal family has landed at Heathrow Airport.</p>
<p>9:51 AM – Princess Lily was greeted by a large group of photographers and by – amongst others – our King and Queen and Lord Sirius Black, best friend of Prince James. Prince James will join the party at Gryffindor Palace where tea shall be served.</p>
<p>9:56 AM – Princess Lily is wearing a charming mint green dress from Madam Malkin’s Couture Collection. Madam Malkin and her team describe the dress as being soft ivory and layered with a transparent mint green fabric. The dress has subtle applications around the neckline.</p>
<p>10:14 AM – “Princess Lily looks absolutely divine,” says fashion designer Molly Weasley. Her popular collection of Christmas jumpers swept Great Britain by storm a mere four months ago. She even designed Prince James a personal jumper. “I received a very kind note from him,” says the beaming woman, currently pregnant with twins. “Apparently he is a great fan of my jumpers.”</p>
<p>10:45 AM – The car carrying the royal party just entered the gates of Gryffindor Palace. The crowds went wild as they caught a glimpse of the beautiful young royal. Signs went up, saying: WELCOME TO OUR FUTURE QUEEN and MARRY PRINCE JAMES, all carried by members of the Jily Club.</p>
<p>10:59 AM – We await the arrival of Prince James at the royal palace. He is on his way home after spending four months in military training.</p>
<p>11:24 AM – Prince James has arrived, waving at the crowds and grinning broadly as he eyed one of the signs: KISS THE GIRL!</p>
<p>11:33 AM – While the royal party enjoys their tea inside of the palace’s walls, I will keep all of you entertained with the story of the second meeting of the young royals!</p>
<p>11:44 AM – Prince James, Princess Lily and their families were invited to the wedding between Prince Lucius of Germany to the lovely Lady Narcissa Black. Although, Princess Lily’s family has always been regarded to be an outcast among Europe’s royal families – the Irish royal family was not recognised till the 1900s and is, therefore, relatively young – they were invited to attend this prestigious event. The wedding ran smoothly until the young Prince James stepped on the trail of Princess Lily’s dress and, as a consequence, the teenage princess broke her arm as she attempted to break her fall.</p>
<p>11:57 AM – After a very short tea break, Prince James and Princess Lily are on their way to St Mungo’s Hospital to open the new children’s wing, built with the help of countless Irish workers.</p>
<p>12:04 PM – While we await the royal couple’s arrival at the hospital, I will briefly review the fifth encounter between the young royals.</p>
<p>12:13 PM – The Irish royal family invited Prince James and his family to attend Princess Lily’s 16th birthday. Princess Lily – apparently set on revenge after Prince James’ antics during their previous encounters – pushed Prince James into the icy lake, yelling something about a giant squid.</p>
<p>12:41 PM – Princess Lily and Prince James have arrived at St Mungo’s.</p>
<p>12:51 PM – Prince James has thanked Ireland for its “enduring support”.</p>
<p>12:56 PM – Princess Lily has declared the children’s wing of St Mungo’s Hospital to be opened.</p>
<p>1:01 PM – The young royals will now chat with a few of the young patients before they will return to Gryffindor Palace.</p>
<p>1:05 PM – In less than an hour, Prince James and Princess Lily will appear on the large balcony of Gryffindor Palace to wave at the crowds.</p>
<p>1:11 PM – If it had appeared packed before, the area in front of Gryffindor Palace is now stormed by people who hope to catch a glimpse of the young royals.</p>
<p>1:15 PM – If one were to wonder why Princess Lily and not her sister, Princess Petunia, opened St Mungo’s Hospital with our heir to the throne today, it is all related to an unfortunate event at the third meeting between Prince James and Princess Lily.</p>
<p>1:19 PM – At this event, Prince James and Lord Sirius Black accidentally crashed into the painting painted by Princess Petunia for the anniversary of the friendship between Ireland and Great Britain. Princess Petunia has refused to see Prince James – or Lord Sirius Black, for that matter – ever since.</p>
<p>1:44 PM – Prince James and Princess Lily are on their way back to Gryffindor Palace. Slightly behind schedule.</p>
<p>1:58 PM – The young royals just passed the crowds, waving enthusiastically.</p>
<p>2:02 PM – One member of the Jily Club has just passed out. According to Madam Pompfrey – head nurse of St Mungo’s Hospital – everyone should drink as much as possible when in the crowds in front of the palace. Dehydration combined with the stress of seeing the royals in real life may cause light-headedness.</p>
<p>2:08 PM – No sign of Prince James and Princess Lily as of yet.</p>
<p>2:11 PM – Loud cheers and screams fill the area in front of the Gryffindor Palace as the balcony doors are opened. It cannot be long now.</p>
<p>2:14 PM – The King and Queen have emerged on the balcony, closely followed by Prince James, Lord Sirius Black and Princess Lily.</p>
<p>2:15 PM – “Absolutely worth the wait,” says Alice Prewett happily. The girl is holding up the sign Prince James had enjoyed earlier: KISS THE GIRL. “It’s a quote from Disney’s <em>The Little Mermaid</em>,” explains the 24-year-old.</p>
<p>2:17 PM – What on earth…?</p>
<p>2:18 PM – Too excited to type. Crowds have gone mad.</p>
<p>2:19 PM – For any of you out there at work or otherwise preoccupied: PRINCE JAMES JUST KISSED PRINCESS LILY!</p>
<p>2:21 PM – The young prince has his arm wrapped around Princess Lily’s waist now. The princess blushes elegantly as she places one of her hands on Prince James’ upper arm.</p>
<p>2:24 PM – The Jily Club has started to sing <em>The Little Mermaid</em>’s “Kiss The Girl”.</p>
<p>2:28 PM – The royal party has left the balcony after Princess Lily pressed a final kiss on Prince James’ lips to please the crowds – or was it to please herself?</p>
<p>2:45 PM – The impossible has happened. Although, if we had previously listened to the Jily Club we may not be as shocked.</p>
<p>2:59 PM – Mary MacDonald, President of the Jily Club, is in tears: “These are happy tears,” she adds hastily and then smiles widely. “This is what we have been waiting for. Finally, they are together.”</p>
<p>3:29 PM – But are they really dating? Prime Minister Albus Dumbledore remained awfully quiet when asked about THOSE KISSES. “We know as much as you do,” said the bearded man. “But they did seem awfully happy, don’t you think?”</p>
<p>3:38 PM – “There has always been chemistry between the pair,” Batilda Bagshot informed me exclusively. “If one looks back at their previous encounters, you will note there was always something there.”</p>
<p>3:51 PM – Alice Prewett has just reminded me that one woman foresaw the happenings of today. The Cornish psychic Sybill Trelawney has often been believed to be a fraud, but predicted a wedding between Prince James and Princess Lily on a Summer’s day.</p>
<p>4:21 PM – Sybill Trelawney is unavailable. Typical.</p>
<p>4:56 PM – Word has just arrived that the private jet of the Irish royal family has returned home. However, PRINCESS LILY REMAINS INSIDE OF GRYFFINDOR PALACE’S WALLS!</p>
<p>5:10 PM – Minerva McGonagall, Dumbledore’s private secretary, has neither confirmed nor denied that Princess Lily will be staying with the British royal family for an extended period of time.</p>
<p>5:22 PM – Lord Sirius Black has just left Gryffindor Palace. When asked about his thoughts, he smirked and said: “I just really want a hamburger right now.”</p>
<p>5:27 PM – As the black sheep of the Black family, Lord Sirius Black never has anything useful to report.</p>
<p>5:29 PM – Lord Sirius Black just flashed me the finger.</p>
<p>5:38 PM – No more news regarding THOSE KISSES is expected for the day. Thank you all for your attention, your royal correspondent Rita Skeeter.</p>
<p>7:48 PM – FINAL UPDATE: In tomorrow’s newspapers: an EXCLUSIVE interview by Rita Skeeter with an insider at court. "Those kisses on the balcony were certainly not the last,“ reveals one of Prince James’ most trusted confidants.</p>
