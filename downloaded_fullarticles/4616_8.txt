    <p>Clean the wound.</p><p>I had done so with great care, having examined each of the eight separate indentations to make sure there were no teeth points buried in the holes.</p><p>Rub in the anti-venom and blood coagulant.</p><p>Mr. Potter shivered uncontrollably whenever my fingers moved over the wounded area, the junction between his neck and left shoulder. The salve stopped the bleeding entirely. As the blood coagulant dried, the skin around each wound puckered with fury. The risk of infection was ever-present. There's nothing more poisonous than saliva, whether it belongs to a human or a vampire.</p><p>Administer the cleansing potion.</p><p>It was difficult, but not impossible, to get enough of the Canis Capellum down Potter's throat to constitute an entire dose. I managed to get six ounces into him by holding him in a seated position, and rubbing his throat to induce him to swallow. I had demanded a full pint of blood from Le Clair before allowing Illumina to take him away to distant safety. He was reluctant until I explained that Mr. Potter's guardian would demand far more than a pint of it when he found out what had happened. A pint would give me enough to make a week's worth of the potion. I made Illumina promise to send me a pint every week until further notice. </p><p>Keep the patient level and calm to reduce heart rate.</p><p>After giving Potter the Canis Capellum, I stretched him out on my bed. He looked impossibly thin and small on the massive, black covers. His shivering died away. He lay immobile, too still for me to feel easy. His expression was a troubling one– he was caught somewhere between agony and bliss. </p><p>Keep the lights dim and the distractions few.</p><p>I had banished both Hagrid and Dumbledore in order to work as quickly as possible. In the distance, I had heard the Headmaster arguing with Madam Pomfrey at the end of the corridor that led to my private quarters. There was barely enough light for me to work by, but it had been enough. The fire behind the black screen cast shadows and flickers upon the quiet bedroom. There wasn't a sound but the crackling of the logs on the hearth, and Potter's strange, intermittent gasps for air.</p><p>Wait for signs of returning consciousness, and then administer the restorative draught.</p><p>Ah, the hard part. Nothing to do but repeat the procedure twice a day until the little brute opened his eyes and recognized his surroundings. It wasn't that this list of instructions had done me any good last time I had used them. I had spent eight long weeks beside Illumina's bed, hoping, praying, promising whatever gods would listen that I would give my all for her to survive this ordeal. She had survived, surely, though the gods had exacted their own devious price at my lack of specificity on the conditions of her survival. </p><p>Clean the wound.<br/>
Rub in the anti-venom and blood coagulant.<br/>
Administer the cleansing potion.<br/>
Keep the patient level and calm to reduce heart rate.<br/>
Keep the lights dim and the distractions few.<br/>
Wait for signs of returning consciousness, and then administer the restorative draught.</p><p>It was easy enough to tide myself over with the promise that when The Boy regained consciousness, I would be free to throttle him back into unconsciousness. But after hours, and days, and finally a week wore on with hardly a sign of life from him, I believe I finally began to worry. It's very hard to keep an angry grudge continually fed when the object of your baleful emotion is lying against your chest, breathing unsteadily, heart barely beating. An occasional delirious whimper was all I had to go on. </p><p>Dumbledore taught my classes in my absence, because I was afraid to leave Potter alone, even when necessary. I ate beside Harry, slept beside him, and waited. And waited. It occurred to me that perhaps I should have been keeping a proper medical journal that would relate my findings to other healers who wanted to know how to treat patients with similar bites. I kept track mentally of what was going on, but never put quill to paper.</p><p>1 November: Patient who can best be described as a barely-adequate, sixteen-year-old specimen, is suffering from a vampire bite that he received while sticking his scrubby nose into his Potions Master's personal business. The offending vampire donated his blood to the cleansing potion only when threatened with the incandescent wrath of patient's werewolf guardian, leaving attendant entirely unsure who he should cheer for if a confrontation between the two parties should play itself out at a later date. </p><p>2 November: Patient's condition remained stable and unchanged. There were the expected primary indications of vampirisis. His irises turned red. His canine teeth lengthened, and he salivated when suitable prey (attendant and others) approached him. All senses were extremely sensitive. As yet he has not exhibited the secondary indications: he can digest human food (broth being the only thing I could get down his throat) and his skin remains warm to the touch.</p><p>3 November: Patient's condition worsened. His skin grew cold to the touch, though his heart continued to beat. Thankfully, his body continued to process the food and medication that I have managed to get down his throat.</p><p>4 November: Patient's condition improved guardedly. His skin was clammy yet, but not ice-cold. He smelled horrendous. I remembered how horrible Illumina had smelled, and how distressed she was about it. What a trivial thing to worry about, all things considered. </p><p>5 November: Patient began performing wandless magic in his sleep; a very respectable Patronus appeared several times. There was the sudden apparition of 300 plus roving fancies. But the real show-stopper was the Norwegian Ridgeback dragon drawn out of thin air. I had to employ the services of the gamekeeper in order to rid my quarters of the beasts The Boy had conjured. Once the bedchambers and living quarters were cleared, my knees were knocking so badly that I had to sit down and listen to my heart for a full quarter-hour. Hagrid found it necessary to remain in my quarters for another two hours, watching the patient as he slept. I drank three whisky-straights and I’m not quite sure when I fell asleep, except that I awoke in bed with Harry curled around me. </p><p>6 November: Harry spoke in his sleep, asking for Mr. Weasley. My attempts at a Legilimens spell met with mixed results. I couldn't concentrate on the images because they were too random and fleeting. I would prefer not to allow Mr. Weasley into my inner-most private quarters, but upon hearing that Potter was asking for him, the Headmaster insisted that I allow Mr. Weasley to see my patient.</p><p>7 November: That would be today, technically, though it's very early morning. Is it Saturday again?</p><p>I saw no point in writing any of this down. A week had already gone by; a week of waiting; a week of spending every waking moment by the side of Harry's bed, formerly my bed; now our bed; a week of sleeping with Harry lying on my chest, feeling his skinny body shudder with interior cold. </p><p>One thing was certain– today would begin with a bath. Yes. It was high time this child smelled better.</p><p>I wondered if I had done the right thing as I lowered Potter into the tub. Not just in caring for him. There was no doubt in my mind that I would live long enough to regret saving his life. But I was more presently concerned with the morality of stripping him naked and bathing him. </p><p>I was trying to keep my eyes on his face even though I knew the simple fundamentals of this task required me to stare at his entire body. Even bedraggled, frowzy, and downright unpleasant, the boy was beautiful to behold. Mother Nature could be a vindictive bitch when the mood took her, but in Mr. Potter's case, she had been extraordinarily kind. My heart caught in my throat as I stared at him. I was jealous and covetous in equal parts. I hated myself for the thoughts that possessed me, thoughts of how I might play this doctor/patient situation to my advantage, how I could parlay my care of him into having my way with him. Maybe I could even convince him that it was part of the cure for what had happened?? </p><p>What kind of depraved individual had I become, to be capable of thinking of sex with a vulnerable sixteen-year-old in my care? How many times had I seen the looks that passed between my father and the patients I knew that he had been intimate with? How many times had I despised him so thoroughly for taking advantage of their trust, for abusing his position of power and dominating them in their ignorance? </p><p>I usually tried to avoid thinking of Mr. Potter beyond the realm of master and pupil. In that realm there was safety for both of us. With him lying naked in my grasp, it was hard not to think of him as human, entirely human. Harry was so beautiful in ways I never expected him to be– not in a feminine way, but in a stubborn and unbreakable masculine way that so amused me and made my heart light. The more he fussed and contorted when I tried to wash him, the more determined I was that he would bend to my will. Was this what Lily had seen in James? Had I had misjudged the dynamics of their relationship? I had always presumed that James had been dominant over Lily, that he kept her isolated like a precious bauble or a Ming vase that he wanted for himself. Had it been the other way around? Had Lily captured James, the wild animal, and possessed him in order to subdue and thereby control his fearsome nature to her own advantage?</p><p>Harry writhed again, bringing my mind back to my task. I was reaching him on a certain level– that gave me more delight that I thought possible. After a week of fearing for his life (well, three or four days at least in the fearing for it) I was thrilled to be getting a reaction from him. I washed him thoroughly at least twice, and decided I should repeat this process again tonight. I should repeat these baths twice a day, though perhaps those of the basin variety might be safer. </p><p>Having finished my task, and deciding to linger longer would endanger both of us, I pulled Harry out of the water, letting him hang dripping on a levitation spell while I stared around the bathroom aimlessly. Not having planned further ahead of improving his scent, I had forgotten to bring an extra robe for him. I pulled my own off the door and bundled him inside for the trip back to the bed.</p><p>I emerged into the bedroom to find Dumbledore standing there smiling at me. He was instructing the small army of house elves about how to change the sheets on the bed, what spells to cast to make them soft to sensitive skin, what folds to use that would keep the material from creasing and bruising the patient's tender skin. He had also brought a tray of food for me. </p><p>"Ah, Severus," the Headmaster said benignly. "I wondered how long it would take you to decide Harry might use some soap and water."</p><p>I nodded in greeting and lay my bundle down on the clean bed. Albus nudged me with a flat package. I glanced up at him as he lifted the top of the box. Inside was a pair of pajamas. I didn't have to wonder who they were meant for.</p><p>"I took the liberty of sending for them. Has he spoken today? Called for Mr. Weasley again?" Dumbledore asked.</p><p>"No, sir. Not yet," I replied. I spent an inordinate amount of time drying the wild locks on my pillow, not wanting to venture into dressing Harry in front of the Headmaster lest my desire for my patient become wholly evident.  </p><p>"Would it be imprudent of us to allow Mr. Weasley to visit nonetheless? His presence might spark Harry back to us," Albus suggested. I sensed from his tone that no would not do for an answer. </p><p>"As you wish, sir," I replied.</p><p>"Capital. He is waiting outside." Dumbledore headed in the direction of the door. </p><p>"Can I dress the patient before you return?" I called. Mr. Weasley was already poking his head through the opening door.</p>
