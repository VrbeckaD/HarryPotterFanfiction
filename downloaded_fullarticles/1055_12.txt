    <p>
  <span>Harry Potter thought that once he died (for real this time) he’d finally get some rest, but no it can never be that simple for him. Instead of that peaceful afterlife with his loved ones he ends up reincarnated and as a girl to top it all off. Well it wasn’t so bad, he-er she did get a sibling this time, a twin sister.</span>
</p>
<hr/><p>
  <span>Inko smiled at her sleeping babies, little Izumi and Izuku. She hadn’t expected to have twins, but she took it in stride and besides Izumi and Izuku were such good babies. They hardly ever cried and always slept through the night. Mitsuki tried to hide it, but Inko could tell her best friend was a bit envious at how easy-going the twins were, Katsuki was a willful child (Inko could tell he was going to be just like his mother), rarely ever sleeping through the night and much preferred to through his food around then eat it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Noticing her babies were awake, she scooped them both up. “Hungry?” Izumi nodded her head ‘yes’ while Izuku mumbled her baby talk. Inko smiled, “then let’s get some food in you two.”</span>
</p>
<hr/><p>
  <span>“Wets pway hero!” Katsuki exclaimed, grinning excitedly along with Izuku who was nodding her head frantically in agreement.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No thanks.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Pwease sister!” Izuku pleaded, using her best kicked puppy look. “Pwease pway hero with us!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Izumi shrugged, “alright.” She was never very good at saying ‘no’ to Izuku (or Katsuki if she were honest), but that was perfectly fine by her. Izumi would do anything to keep her beloved twin sister and friend innocent of the worlds problems for as long as possible. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>~</span>
  <em>
    <span>Thank you sister!</span>
  </em>
  <span>~ Izuku said through their magical twin bond.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hurry up! Wets pway!” Katsuki yelled impatiently.</span>
</p>
<hr/><p>
  <span>~</span>
  <em>
    <span>We aren’t quirkless</span>
  </em>
  <span>~ Izumi said through their connection. ~</span>
  <em>
    <span>Our mental connection proves that.</span>
  </em>
  <span>~ Izuku nodded, hugging her twin. ~</span>
  <em>
    <span>Come on let’s go to those woods and I’ll teach you some magic.</span>
  </em>
  <span>~</span>
</p><p>
  <span>
    <span>That got Izuku’s attention, ~</span>
    <em>
      <span>really!?</span>
    </em>
    <span>~ Izumi nodded and Izuku let out a squeal of happiness.</span>
