    <p>
  <em>***Must read Rage I first***</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>Harry. </em>Just the thought of him made his heart kick into overdrive. He never thought he would become a love-struck fool like the people he saw holding hands as they walked down Diagon Alley, but now, he was one of them. Ever since The Daily Profit ran the article proclaiming Draco Malfoy as Harry Potter's secret lover, their relationship was no longer a secret that needed to be resisted, and Draco found himself falling deeper in love with him, every day.</p><p> </p><p>To his dismay, he discovered that Harry was a huge fan of public displays of affection. He never cared about the barrage of cameras that would flash as he held his hand in public while out on a shopping trip. At first, Draco was alarmed by this behavior and would quickly move his hand away.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“No one wants to see that,” he’d insist.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Who cares what they want? I love you. I don’t care who knows it.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Draco would blush at this response and slowly, over the course of a few months, got used to Harry’s public affections, even relished in them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>He left for France Wednesday evening, parting from a reluctant Harry with a soft kiss. His French chateau was in a dilapidated state, needing numerous renovations, and he'd been putting this trip off in light of his hot love affair. The initial plan was for Harry to meet him in France via international portkey on Friday evening, but those plans quickly fell through. He received an urgent owl from him Friday morning, explaining that a huge case had come up, forcing him to work through the weekend. As he was the head auror, he could not abandon his team. He apologized profusely in the letter and detailed all the naughty things he would be doing to Draco, once he returned home. Harry still made love to him, three or four times a week, with a tenderness he had never experienced in his life, and he found he enjoyed his new role as the bottom, even craved it. With Harry, it just seemed right. It was the natural order of things.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>The manager of his property, Gabriel, was a severely handsome, short frenchman. He had dark hair, light eyes, and a delicious blush staining his cheeks, whenever Draco was around. He was on the skinny side, but toned with sinewy muscles. Draco often though he would make the perfect bottom, but never engaged with him when he was married because he was too close to the family. Astoria knew Gabriel well. If he was not with Harry, he wouldn't think twice about bending him over his French balcony and fucking him until he screamed loud enough for all of Paris to hear.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>As it is, Draco had to behave. He was tempted, with Harry being so far away and not having been a top for many months, but he was not tempted enough to be unfaithful. He was, however, grateful to Gabriel who, in the past, had informed Draco of an underground gay BDSM club in Paris. Draco pretended to be offended by the information, back then, while still married to Astoria, but he always visited the club on the rare weekends he was in France.</p><p> </p><p>By the time Saturday night rolled around, Draco was a pent up ball of sexual frustration. When Harry was around, Draco’s dominant side became quiet and subdued, but it never totally vanished. It was a part of him the same way his platinum hair and grey eyes were.</p><p> </p><p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It wasn’t that the sex wasn’t enough with Harry. To the contrary, the sex with Harry was incredible. He enjoyed being crushed by Harry’s larger body, fucked into the mattress until he screamed, being filled, to the point of bursting, with his raw power.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>When he was left to his own devices, however, it was a different matter. This was so rarely the case as he was hardly ever apart from Harry. Still, when he was left alone, he couldn’t help visions flashing into his mind of ropes and chains, of a screaming voice protesting his hard thrusts.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>They would sometime creep up in his dreams, but he would roll over, cuddle against Harry, and forget all about them. The problem with these dreams and fantasies is that they often involved Blaise, whom he now hated. Blaise did not deserve to star in his sex dreams, after his despicable betrayal. It was only because Blaise had been, so often, a vital part of his dominant experiences.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>And so, it was with the intention to garner fresh fantasy material that he dressed in his best night clothes and prepared to go to the muggle club,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><em>Le Donjon,</em> or The Dungeon. He wore all black, as was his custom. A fitted black V-neck shirt and too-tight black trousers contrasted sharply with his platinum hair and porcelain skin.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Everywhere Draco went in France, he was ogled at, openly, by both men and women. Most Frenchman were short and Draco towered over them with his lithe 6’1 frame. Paired with his white-blonde hair and grey eyes, Draco was an exotic tourist who probably starred in their fantasies. <em>Le Donjon</em> was no exception.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>The first floor of the establishment was a normal muggle gay club, dark with laster lights,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>pounding music, and gyrating bodies grinding up against each other. Men with spiked collars and black leather masks danced provocatively in cages, suspended above the dance floor. The whole club was BDSM themed. Draco relished in all the eyes that stared at him in pure lust, as he slowly walked through the crowd. Some were daring enough to run their hands on his body and grab his ass, on his way to the bar. Draco did not mind. He was not planning on fucking anyone in this club, above ground or below. There was no harm in being touched.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>He knew Harry would be hurt if he ever found out he had come here, but as he was planning to remain completely faithful, he did not see the harm in engaging his retinas with a little domination/submission action. Harry did not need to be exposed to this part of himself. He was too pure for this darker side of Draco.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>The owner of <em>Le Donjon</em> greeted Draco like an old friend when he arrived at the bar. Draco was thankful he was always there on Saturday nights, otherwise, it may have been difficult to gain access to the underground. The owner made him an old fashioned and Draco paid for the drink with four hundred dollar bills, silently communicating to him what he really came for. He was sure to always bring muggle money with him whenever he ventured into the muggle part of France. He was sure he overpaid, but it was just money. He had more. Nothing could replace the love and trust it inspired in people, such as the owner of this nightclub. It was the reason he was greeted so warmly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>He personally led Draco to a heavy black metal door that was guarded by an oversized bouncer and was immediately let through. They descended a long, dark, staircase that was lit softly by dark red light. There was a small foyer at the bottom with a hostess who greeted them enthusiatically.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Bienvenue dans le donjon souterrain, où tous vos fantasmes deviennent réalité. N'oubliez pas qu'il n'y a pas de règles ici dans le métro. Nous espérons que vous serez en sécurité et que vous profiterez de votre soirée.”</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Welcome to the underground dungeon, where all your fantasies come true.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remember, there are no rules here in the underground. We hope you will be safe and enjoy your evening.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>A pile of condoms glistened in glass in front of her like an obscene candy bowl.  Draco had an idea of what they were used for but found the idea of putting synthetic muggle plastic on top of his dick, distasteful. He thanked merlin he did not have to live like that, as he was a wizard and could simply cast protective charms, wandlessly, not that he would need them tonight.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>The minute he walked through the door to the dark dungeon, he closed his eyes in blessed relief to focus on the sounds. There was soft French music playing in the background. The loudest sound was a scream of severe pain following the harsh crack of a leather whip. Beyond that, Draco heard the groans and grunts of many different patrons who were no doubt, being reamed by a hard cock or fucking someone, in turn. He heard occasional screams of ecstasy and the sound of flesh slapping flesh.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Underneath those, he heard his favorite sound of all, the faint rattling of chains.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Draco sighed deeply. He had no idea how much he missed this side of himself, until this very moment. He finally opened his eyes, but it made little difference. The dungeon was mostly dark at the entrance, but the sounds permeated his soul. He could see shadows moving at the far edges of the rooms and knew there were multiple passages that led to more secluded rooms, for a more private experience. All these rooms were free to be observed or participated in, by any patron who was both lucky and rich enough, to gain entrance.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Draco followed the sounds of the rattling chains to a secluded room down a narrow passageway. The observers in the room were mostly cast in shadow, but he could tell there were at least ten men in the room. The sexual scene being preformed was lit by a single red light from overhead.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>He was sure to pause at the entrance, as it was also lit by a red light and anyone who entered or exited could be seen clearly. He wanted to be seen and ogled. He wanted them to imagine him fucking them hard, until they screamed. Though he could not see them, it made his cock stir, knowing that they were imagining themselves bent over in front of him, taking his thick cock deep inside their hole.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>It was obvious that Draco was a dominant in the BDSM world. Though he was lean, he was also tall, and his calm mask of indifference gave off an intense sexual energy of authority and control. He imagined it was his auror training that did it, or maybe it was because his ethereal good looks inspired lust in every sex.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>He walked slowly to the empty couch in the center of the front row and sat down gracefully. The front row was mostly unoccupied, save for two men sitting in chairs at opposite ends. Sitting further back insured anonymity as it was cast in complete darkness. The front row was dimly lit by both, the bright red light that shined over the sex scene, and the light from the entrance. Draco did not mind being seen by these muggles. He relished in it. He took a sip of his drink and observed the scene before him. His cock hardened like a lightening rod.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>A young man was bent over a small rectangular table. His wrists were chained down at the end of it, fully extended downwards, and his ankles were chained apart on the opposite end. He was completely naked and soaked with sweat. He was being penetrated at both ends. A tall, burly dark haired man was ramming into him brutally from behind while another shorter man stood in front, feeding him his cock. The chains rattled loudly against the metal legs of the table as the man behind him thrust forward at a relentless pace, slapping his flesh loudly. He was grunting with each thrust. Suddenly, the man in front of him, pulled out, rapidly stroking his cock to reach orgasm, and blew his load all over his face, groaning loudly. The chained man closed his eyes tight against the onslaught and cum splattered the floor beneath him as it dripped down his chin. This seemed to trigger the man behind him to reach orgasm, as well. He pulled out of him swiftly, removed the muggle plastic enclosing his cock and shot his load all over his ass. When he was done, he smacked his ass, hard, and left the room.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Draco was in heaven. This was exactly what he needed, fresh fantasy material. He imagined it was he that was reaming the smaller man, chained to the table. How he longed to be the cause of those rattling chains.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>A night club worker in short black shorts and only a bowtie sprang forward, to clean him. He used a wet wash cloth to wipe off all the cum and offered the chained man water to sip through a straw. When he was done, he rested his head on the table, turning to observe his audience. He immediately locked eyes with Draco.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>His look almost made Draco forget he was in a relationship. It was a desperate, pleading gaze. Draco knew what it meant. He wanted to be fucked by Draco and fully expected it to happen, as the submissive was extremely handsome with a slight muscular build. Most of the observers eventually became participants, if they liked what they saw. The chained man looked a lot like Harry with black wavy hair and light eyes, though his frame was much smaller, the way a perfect submissive should be. The man did not break eye contact with Draco for several minutes, while he recuperated. Draco wanted to stroke his cock through his trousers at his gaze. He knew he could pull his dick out and wank, as most behind him had been doing, but he felt it was undignified to do so. He would wait until he returned home. He maintained a calm, politely disinterested expression, as he looked back at him, and sipped his drink, daintily. It only spurred the tabled man on. He licked his lips obscenely at Draco.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>In the past, this had never been a problem, as he usually became a participant. Many approached him for sex at this club and he was only too happy to oblige, that is, if they did not mind being chained and whipped. That type of treatment was too much for a wizard, even for Blaise. He was very picky, when choosing a parter, and almost always chose someone who looked like Harry, now that he thought about it. He did not count these muggles as part of his sexual exploits, as he did not even know their names. Only Blaise and Harry registered as true sexual partners. This was just his fantasy world.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>The chained man mouthed “please” to Draco, and Draco had to close his eyes against it. He was excruciatingly hard and tried to focus his gaze elsewhere. Unfortunately, his eyes landed on a glass cabinet against the wall that held different styles of whips. This man was, apparently, game for all types of submissive exploits, from the right type of dominant.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Draco was sorely tempted but held his ground. He promised himself he would not cheat on Harry, even if it was not possible he would ever find out. Draco would know and the guilt would eat him alive. This was Harry’s biggest fear, that Draco would cheat on him with some submissive bloke, and he loved him too much to have that fear realized.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Fortunately, after a few minutes, a man of medium build and inconsequential looks strode forward. He was dressed like an investment banker and wore a gold metal band on his ring finger. He whispered softly to the submissive and stroked his hair gently. Draco could not hear what was being said, but he saw the chained man nod to him and the investment banker began to disrobe. He went to the glass cabinet and withdrew a gag that he tied around his mouth and a long leather whip. He stroked the leather over his ass softly for a few moments and then cracked it once over ass, with modest strength. The man on the table moaned behind his gag and Draco saw his cock harden, as it was poking out from the back end of the table. The man continued whipping him gently and the chained man’s cock started leaking pre-cum on the floor.</p><p> </p><p><em>Oh gods. </em>The tabled man made the perfect pain slut. He was loving every second of it. He thought he might die if he did not take over and whip him, himself. The man of modest looks was being too gentle with him. Draco could tell the submissive wanted more.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>His cock was tenting his trousers and a large dark spot had already formed. Suddenly, an attractive Moroccan man with large lips stood up from the far chair and approached him. He paid him no notice, even when he knelt in front of him. He just continued to observe the scene up front and sip his drink. The man looked up at him, waiting for permission, but he pretended he was not even there. He bent his head to mouth his large, hard cock through his trousers. Draco drew in a breath but did not stop him right away. The pressure was incredible. When the man went to unbuckle his trousers, he finally put his drink down.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>He grabbed the man’s head with both hands and smashed his face down on his clothed cock, hard, thrusting upwards, then threw him aside. Standing up swiftly, he left the room.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>It had become too much to endure. He knew that if he stayed another moment longer, he would cheat on Harry. He would face fuck that attractive moroccan man until he choked and gagged on his thick cock. He would grab the whip from that mediocre looking man and crack the soft leather on that ass the way the submissive truly craved. He would fuck him so hard that his chains would rattle and break the legs of the table. He would make him scream loud enough to be heard, from all the way upstairs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>He practically ran up those stairs, before he could change his mind. He barreled through the crowd, desperate for fresh air and sense. He needed to remember himself before he became slave to this smaller, significantly darker, part of himself.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>When he finally got out onto the street, he pushed his dick down and took a few deep breaths of the cool air. He forced himself to focus on Harry and he eventually started to calm down. He walked all the way back to his chateau, needing to clear his head.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>When he arrived home, his erection had subsided. Everything would be fine. He would go home early tomorrow and settle into Harry’s warm embrace. He would forget all about this and everything would return to normal.</p><p> </p><p>_______________________________________________________</p><p> </p><p>Sunday morning came and Draco was eager to go home. He needed Harry, badly. He gave a few last minute instructions to Gabriel and disapparated to the international portkey station in the wizarding part of Paris. There was still so much more to be done at the chateau and he would have to return the following weekend, but he refused to visit France, without Harry in tow. He would not make it through next time, as a faithful man.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>He had to wait. The next portkey to England was not for another hour. He sighed as he thought back to the previous night. He crossed his legs to stave off an erection and decided to sharpen his French by reading the local newspaper. He needed something to take his mind off those haunting visions. Going to <em>Le Dongon </em>last night turned out to be a terrible idea. It had awakened dormant, dominant feelings in Draco that he was ashamed to feel.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p><p> </p><p>After about fifteen minutes, a young handsome French wizard sat at Draco’s side. He began speaking to him in rapid French, complimenting his crocodile shoes. Draco was clearly too fashion forward to be straight, even in France. He then asked Draco what he did for a living. When he said that he was an auror, his eyes widened, but it was not enough for him to leave. They chatted back and forth. The man could tell he was English and complimented his perfect French accent with a handsome, suggestive grin.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It took Draco all of two minutes to realize this young man was gay and heavily hitting on him. He noticed no ring on Draco’s finger and assumed he was available. The young frenchman told him that he was going to the men’s room, and would he like to accompany him?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Draco just stared at him blankly, with a flat expression. The man stood up and walked to the bathroom that was not far away. He rose his eyebrows suggestively at Draco and walked through, letting the door close softly behind his perfectly round ass. Putting down his paper, Draco took this private moment to grasp his hair, pulling painfully. He was being tempted, yet again. <em>Gods, </em>would there be no end to these heavy temptations? He had completely forgotten how much more sexually liberated France was, compared to England. Fucking that attractive man in the bathroom was no longer an option, with Harry in the picture, but he definitely considered it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>He did not make it this far, only to fail forty-five minutes before he was going to see Harry again. He was being driven mad with lust in this god-forsaken country. He grabbed his trunk and walked far away from the spot so that the man would not be able to find him again.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>_________________________________________________________</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>When he finally arrived at Malfoy Manor, he was thankful that he arrived in one, faithful piece. It came close, too close, to not being the case.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Honey, I’m home!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>He grinned at his corny greeting. He heard rushed footsteps and Harry burst through the parlor. His face broke into a large, handsome grin as he embraced Draco, crushing his bones. Draco was instantly assaulted by his familiar oaky scent. He melted against his warmth and his strong arms. He instantly felt better and memories of the weekend quickly quieted, dipping lower to his subconscious where he would not have to think of them again.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Harry inhaled him deeply.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“<em>gods, </em>I missed you so much. Please don’t ever go away for so long, again.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Draco privately agreed not to. Harry released him to give him a soft kiss. It was meant only to be a kiss of greeting but it sparked the fire of lust Draco had been feeling all weekend and he practically raped Harry’s mouth with his tongue. He wrapped his hands around his neck roughly and kissed him all over his face, licking and sucking back towards his ear, whispering “I need you.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Harry instantly fell down on his knees and unbuckled Draco’s trousers quickly, pulling out his cock. He sucked him right down to the hilt, self-inflicting his gagging reflex. Draco sighed in relief at the blissful feeling of Harry’s warm, wet mouth and began stroking his hair, down to his cheeks, lovingly. This was all he needed. He just needed his Harry again. That’s all it was. He was just missing him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> His hot mouth. His suctioned cheeks.</span></p><p> </p><p>Harry sucked his cock with increased skill and precision, pressing down on the underside of cock with his tongue, and back up to lap around the head of his cock. He sucked rapidly and massaged his balls at the same time. His blowjob skills had significantly improved since the start of their relationship. After only a few minutes, Draco felt his orgasm upon him and grabbed Harry’s hair to warn him, but he ignored it and increased his sucks until Draco groaned through his orgasm, cumming right in his mouth. Harry gave his balls a light squeeze to milk him completely.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was a lot of cum, five days’ worth. Some dripped out of his mouth onto the floor. Harry didn’t swallow every time, but when he did, it was huge turn on. He swallowed it all, looking up at Draco and licking his lips.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Draco grinned dazedly at him. His love for him him surged inside his body. It seemed preposterous that only last night, only an hour ago, he considered cheating on him. He could never do anything to jeopardize this.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I’m preparing roast and potatoes for dinner.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Harry, I love you so much.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Harry rolled his eyes and chuckled.</p><p> </p><p>“You always say that when there’s roast and potatoes.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Draco chuckled, remembering that Astoria used to say the same exact thing. He marveled at the fact that this too, seemed like a marriage, already, but it was so much better than what he had before. Draco felt like the luckiest guy on the planet to have this comfortable domesticity with Harry. He congratulated himself for resisting those stupid temptations from the weekend and vowed to never think of them again.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>__________________________________________________</p><p> </p><p>That evening, as Draco showered, Harry lit the bedroom with soft candlelight, after disrobing. He took massage oil from the drawer and placed it on top of the nightstand. When Draco came out, he smiled at the warm sight. Harry’s naked body on display, with his broad shoulders, huge cock, bulging muscles, and piercing green eyes, always made him swoon. This was love, he thought. This was so much better than anything that could be found in a dinky dungeon.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I thought I could give you a massage before bed. You seem tense today.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Draco smiled and nodded at him. He did not notice he was tense or behaving in such a manor to reveal it, but perhaps, it was subconscious.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Draco lay naked on the bed, on his stomach. Harry drizzled the oil over his skin and gently messaged the back of his whole body, from his trapezius down to his feet. Draco moaned in pleasure throughout. It reminded him of the very first time they had sex in Turkey. Draco gave him a massage just like this, before he took his virgin hole, for the first time. When Harry worked back up towards his ass, he moved his oily fingers inside the cleft, across his hole and dipped his fingers inside a few times. He groaned as he squeezed the firm glutes in his palms.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“You have the most perfect ass and its all mine. I’m the luckiest guy in the world.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>He rubbed his naked, erect cock across Draco’s hole, but he did not enter. Draco loved every second of Harry’s tender worship, but he needed to be breeched. He needed that sharp burning sensation to fully bring him back to being Harry’s Draco. He pushed his ass up high and moved it slowly around, teasingly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Harry slid down Draco’s legs and wandlessly cast a cleaning charm at his hole. He licked his hole up and down slowly, from his perineum to above his hole and down again, while Draco moaned freely under him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He kissed and sucked at his entrance, with abandon. That secret spot was so sensitive, full of nerve endings, and every single one fired with pure pleasure. His cock began to harden to full mast under Harry’s ministrations, especially when he began thrusting his fingers inside, opting to prepare him the manual way, instead of using magic. He pushed down on his prostate and lapped the rim with his tongue, moaning throughout, almost triggering Draco’s orgasm.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>When Draco started shaking, he stopped and flipped him around so that he could enter him face to face. He kissed Draco on the mouth and thrust his tongue inside. The cleaning charms insured he did not have any remnants of Draco’s taste from his previous activity.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He tasted only Harry, and he tasted just like home.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>He put one hand around the back of Draco’s neck, boring into his eyes,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and used his other hand to guide his cock to its target. Draco spread his knees, high and wide.</p><p> </p><p>He groaned in pleasure when he was breeched. He had long grown accustomed to being Harry’s bottom and relished the initial sting of being entered. Harry slid all the way in and stilled. Kissing Draco, he put both hands behind his neck, and then buried his face in his chest.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“<em>Oh gods</em>. You’re so tight, baby. I missed this.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Draco missed it too. Being crushed by Harry’s body, surrounded by his warmth, breached by his thick cock, was a heady sensation that made his head swim. Harry’s constant kissing only drove him to greater heights as he plunged inside, slowly. When Harry started moving faster, thrusting in and out, he moaned freely, no longer caring how he sounded. There was no shame to be had between them anymore. Draco did not have to hide. He knew Harry loved his noises, having been subjected to his quiet sex habits, in the beginning.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Faster and faster Harry drove into him, angling purposely at the place he knew his prostate to be. Draco felt pleasure paralyzing every cell in his body. He was lost in a sea of desire, no longer thinking of anything, only feeling. Little electric shocks made him shake and shiver every time Harry hit his sweet spot. Harry, feeling dangerously close to the edge, already, used one hand to stroke Draco’s cock to completion. It only took ten firm strokes and Draco was shooting his thick load all over his own stomach. Harry moaned at the feeling of those tight inner muscles clenching around him and buried his head in Draco’s armpit as he pounded into him, hard, for another full minute, holding the back of his neck for leverage. He shouted through his own orgasm as it tore out of him and filled Draco to the brim with his cum, pumping in shallow strokes, long after it was over. Finally, he went limp, leaning his whole weight on top Draco, trying to catch his breath. Draco didn’t mind. He could fall asleep with Harry’s cock inside him. That feeling of fullness that Harry gave him, his heavy weight resting on top of him, was the best feeling in the world.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Harry kissed him sensually, one last time and sighed, resting his head on his chest.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I wish I could stay buried inside you, forever.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Smiling, Draco realized they were starting to reflect each other’s thoughts. Sleep was fast upon him as his travel had drained him of all energy. Though he had grown accustomed to bottoming, it still always hit him with a powerful wave of exhaustion, once it was over. He rested his eyes for a moment and quickly fell asleep.</p><p> </p><p>________________________________________________________________</p><p> </p><p>The next day, at work, Harry went down to the atrium for lunch in an unconscionably good mood. Draco had fallen asleep with his cock still buried inside him, right after sex, and he glowed with pride knowing he tired him to the point of passing out. Draco wanted to work through lunch so he went to grab them both a bite to eat to bring back to his office.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>He had been in a good mood for months now, but the only thing that was able to sour his mood was the off-chance that he would run into Blaise at the ministry. Harry did not know why it boiled his blood, just to see him. He was the one who won Draco and Blaise had lost. He could not name a single reason to hate the man, but his hatred burned strong, even after all these months of having Draco wrapped around his arms.</p><p> </p><p>After he picked up lunch, he was standing in a long line to pay, daydreaming of last night’s intense lovemaking, when he was suddenly followed in line, by none other than Blaise Zabini.</p><p> </p><p>“Daydreaming about your vanilla sex, Potter?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Harry startled and Blaise began to chuckle softly. He bristled at his rude comment.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Wouldn’t you like to know? How’s married life with Pansy? Did she dye her hair blonde enough for you yet?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Blaise huffed, indignant. Harry wanted to bait him further.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“You know, I should probably be thanking you. If it wasn’t for you, outing us to the public, Draco and I would never be where we are now, so, thank you Zabini. Good man.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Harry smiled warmly at him, mocking him. He knew Blaise had to miss Draco every single night he was apart from him. The platinum haired man was like a siren, and his call would make any man crash their ship into the sharp rocks and happily plummet to their drowning deaths, just to be near him. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Blaise leaned close, now, whispering vehemently, but softly enough, so that no one around them would hear.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“And where’s that Potter? Having boring sex, by candlelight, no doubt, every single night?”</p><p> </p><p>He laughed softly. It was a cruel sound. Harry hunched his shoulders as a defensive move. His pulse quickened. </p><p> </p><p>"I know him better than anyone, Potter. I know the deepest, darkest corners of Draco you will never reach. He’ll never fuck you the same way he fucks me. He probably isn’t fucking you at all. He’s hiding himself from you and one day, he will tire of the mundane sex you have to offer. And guess where I’ll be? Waiting, patiently, for him to remember his true self and come back to me, where he belongs.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Harry’s heart sank at his words. Blaise was hitting his most sensitive spot, his deepest insecurity about Draco since he saw him with Blaise in the pensive, six months ago. He swiftly collected himself, however.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“In your dreams, Zabini.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry quickly paid for the food and went upstairs, back to Draco’s office.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>___________________________________________________________________________________</p><p> </p><p>Lunch in Draco’s office was a quiet affair. Draco tried to engage him with discussion about a new case, but Harry was only half-listening. He could not get Blaise’s words out of his head. He was shaken by their interaction. Their conversation played on a loop in his mind driving him closer to the edge. Suddenly, he interrupted.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I think you should tie me up and fuck me, tonight.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Draco’s eyes widened.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Not exactly on topic, Harry. What’s gotten into you? You’ve hardly been listening to me. Did something happen downstairs? You’ve been in a strange mood since you brought us lunch.”</p><p> </p><p>He did not want to tell him what Blaise said. He wanted him to think it was his, independent idea. Besides, Draco would just dismiss it and insist that Blaise was just trying to get under his skin. While that may be true, it did not change the fact that he was haunted by his cruel words and he was afraid he might end up being right, in the end.</p><p> </p><p>Harry could not allow that to happen. His love for Draco lived in every molecule of his body. He often daydreamed of marrying him and could not wait to spend the rest of his life with his blond angel. He planned to propose at the one-year mark, and this needed to be dealt with, before then.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Nothing happened, but it’s something I’ve been thinking about, for a while now. Please Draco. I want you to do it to me, no holding back. I want to see your dominant side. You always hide it from me. I love you and there’s no part of yourself that I wouldn’t accept.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Draco internally scoffed at that. He remembered Harry’s face inside that pensive when he let his dominant side out, with Blaise. Harry was horrified and disgusted. He could barely speak afterwards, shell shocked as he was. Harry was not suited for that kind of treatment. He wasn’t broken, sick, and twisted enough to enter the BDSM world. He was good, honest, and brave. Draco could never chain him up and whip him. The whole thing was absurd, and he would never even consider it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Harry, what’s this about? Are you unhappy with our lovemaking?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>I thought last night was lovely.”</p><p> </p><p><em>Yikes</em>, Draco had called their sex <em>lovely. </em>Harry suddenly started to panic, internally. Blaise was right. Draco thought their sex was boring, vanilla and ‘lovely.’ He would soon tire of it. He needed him to think their sex was dirty, raucous, and desperate. <em><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em></p><p> </p><p>“No, I’m not unhappy, but I’m insisting on this. I want you to be rough with me. Punish me the way I know you like to.”</p><p> </p><p>“Punish you for what? Being the perfect boyfriend? You’re being silly Harry.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Harry started getting angry now. He had forgotten the way Draco viewed him, in light of their happy honeymoon phase. He had lost track of his initial hesitancies about Draco who only saw him as the wholesome hero, not a naughty boy who deserved daddy’s punishment. He was stupid enough to get lost in the feeling of being buried deep inside him, flying high on his love. Draco had not topped him in months, and he remembered that being the top was his natural disposition. Draco always insisted on being the one entered with Harry, and he was only too happy to oblige. He was only now, realizing the significance of that. He had forgotten about it completely because Draco had told him he loved him, and it washed all his doubts away. Now, they were resurfacing with a vengeance, in light of his conversation with Blaise.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“What the fuck, Draco. Why do you refuse to do it to me? It never seemed to be a problem to do it to Blaise!”</p><p> </p><p>“Why are you bringing up Blaise, all the sudden? You haven’t mentioned him in months. Listen to me, Harry. I never want you to compare yourself to that codswallop. He’s dead to me. You and I are completely different. Can’t you see how much I love you? I never even came close to feeling about him, the way I feel about you. You’re everything to me, everything I could ever want. The sex is wonderful, as is. I don’t want it any other way. Please, let’s not fight about this.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry huffed, crossing his arms. He was going to lose Draco to Blaise or some other submissive bloke, at this rate. He felt helpless.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Draco came around to Harry, standing above him, and bent down to kiss him softly on the cheek.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I love you, baby. Please don’t be this way.” Draco looked at him pleadingly and Harry felt weakened by his silver eyes. He stood up, sadly, kissed him softly on the lips and left his office, resigned to defeat.</p><p> </p><p>_____________________________________________________________________</p><p> </p><p>That night, Harry lay awake on Draco’s bed with his body turned away facing the wall, huddled against the far edge. He was still thinking about everything Blaise had said. His eyes prickled when he imagined Draco leaving him. Maybe he would catch him drilling the hole of some submissive prat who loved every second of Draco’s verbal degradation. He never heard it being directed at him, and that was the problem. He only heard flowery words of love from Draco. It would never be enough to keep him. Harry sighed, closing his eyes against the memory of that pensive. It suddenly sharpened in his mind. He remembered Draco’s body, flushed crimson, sweat dripping from his face, as he reamed into Blaise who was tied down to the bed, blindfolded. He had been fucking him for hours. He remembered Draco’s degrading words to Blaise like it were yesterday.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Oh, yea. Such a good little whore. You’re my property, aren’t you. Could tie you up any way I want. My little bitch boy. My sweet baby boy. Look how good you take it. You like how I pound you? Yea, take it. This ass belongs to me. You’re just a cock hungry slut, aren’t you. Always begging for my cock. I love how you beg. Oh, you take it so good, baby. That’s why I give it to you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No one takes it as good as you. You feel so good inside. So wet. Oh fuck, you’re gonna make me cum again soon. My little cum slut. Your hole was made for my cum. I wish you could see how good it looks overflowing out of that tight little hole. I could fuck this little bitch hole forever. Squeeze my cock with that hole…Oh yea, that’s it. That’s a good boy. My sweet baby boy.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>He felt a hand stroking his arm, startling him out of his reverie. Draco placed a soft kiss on the back of his shoulder. He could feel Draco’s hardness behind him, but he ignored it. Draco pulled him to lie flat on his back and Harry, too sad to resist, allowed it, but he kept his head turned away. Draco’s hand stroked his stomach and dipped lower to grasp his completely flaccid cock. He stroked it for a while, but it refused to rise to the occasion. Dipping his head underneath the green silk comforter, he began to suck.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Harry moaned, despite not being in the mood. Draco’s cock-sucking skills were unparalleled. Harry hardened to fullness within seconds and it was no small organ. He was far bigger than most men, but Draco engulfed his cock to the hilt, without gagging once, and swallowed. <em>Show off. </em>Harry burned with anger at Draco’s expert skills that far surpassed his own and wondered if he had gotten so good at sucking cock from his fifteen years of experience with Blaise.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>It did nothing to flag his hardness however, as Draco continuously deep throated him, with the intent to make him fall apart at the seams. Harry pulled the covers off to get a better look. When he saw Draco’s bobbing blond head working over him, his eyes prickled again at the thought of this no longer being his reality, in the near future. His orgasm was quickly approaching, in any case, and Draco suddenly released him from his mouth.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Harry locked eyes with him and saw that Draco’s pupils were completely blown to black. Only a thin sliver of silver surrounded the rim. He looked down and noticed his hard cock was leaking pre-cum already. The sight was too much bare and only caused him pain. He looked away as Draco grabbed his wand from the nightstand, cast preparation charms on himself, and promptly sat down on Harry’s cock, engulfing him to the hilt.</p><p> </p><p>Draco moaned and leaned forward to kiss Harry but he kept his head turned away. He seemed to pay no mind and kissed his neck, instead, as he fucked himself slowly onto his cock, languidly and lovingly. Harry could hardly stand it. This was not what Draco really wanted. He was pretending like it was the best feeling in the world, when it should have been Harry fucking himself on Draco’s cock, instead. His leaning over meant that Harry’s cock was not fully engulfed to the base. Harry could last for hours in this position, with him fucking himself slowly onto it. He had before, and this seemed to be Draco’s intention because he kept his pace slow. He refused to do that now.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Keeping his head turned, he pushed Draco’s chest up to sit straight backed onto his cock instead, so that he was now buried completely. Gripping his ass with both hands to control the pace, he began moving his body quickly back and forth to bring himself to a quick orgasm. He put his feet flat on the bed and thrust upwards, hard and fast, gritting his teeth. In under a minute, he forced his orgasm out and shot his load inside Draco, before he even had the chance to cum, then pushed him off.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Draco settled back on the bed next to him and Harry turned his body away, once more. He heard Draco’s breathing even out, indicating that he was asleep. Harry was not so lucky. He stayed awake all night, trying to think of new ways to keep his blond dragon at his side, forever.</p><p> </p>
