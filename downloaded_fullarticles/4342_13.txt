  <u> <b>18th of December 1994</b> </u>
</p><p>Fred’s brother was an idiot. He had just spent fifteen minutes complaining about how hard it was to find a date for the Yule Ball. Fred sighed and met Angelina’s eyes across the table. Angelina was great. He pointed to himself, to her, and mimed dancing. She said yes.</p><p>Ron wailed and stomped away with Harry at his heels. George and Lee laughed.</p><p>“Now we all have dates!” Lee was excited. “What took you so long anyway mate?”</p><p>Fred shrugged. “I could have asked someone Christmas Eve and gotten a date.”</p><p>“Right-o Brother.” George snickered. “Angelina’s fit too.”</p><p>“Yeah.” Fred stared off towards the Slytherin table as he tried to sort through what he knew about her. “She’s a wicked chaser. Always helps me with astronomy.”</p><p>“Whoa there. Don’t say anything too wild and inappropriate there, mate. It might get around.” Lee cracked up. “No, but really, I think you two will have fun together.”</p><p>“Looking forward to it.” Fred grinned. It was just a dance with his friend. How could it not be fun?</p><p align="center">

Fred wasn’t sure why it wasn’t fun. It had been fun. It had been great fun. He got to laugh at Ronnie’s dress robes. He nailed his Whoopee Cushion charm on several unsuspecting people sitting down. He got directed to the of-age students spiked punch, and he got to dance like crazy with George, Lee, their dates and some other friends. Except they had peeled off one by one and then Angelina had dragged him down some random corridor. She was just staring at him.</p><p>“Um.” Fred stared at his shoes. “Did you have fun tonight?”</p><p>Angelina smiled. “I know how we could have more fun.”</p><p>“Really.” Fred squeaked. He coughed and tried again. “Really?”</p><p>She leaned forward and kissed him. He kissed her back. Because that is what you are supposed to do. He didn’t like it. He didn’t think it was awful or anything. It was just, lips on his lips. He thought he would like it more based on how everyone talked about kissing.</p><p>Angelina pulled back and smiled. “This was nice.”</p><p>“Yeah.” Agreeing was probably best. He smiled at her, then glanced away, towards the flickering sconces on the wall.</p><p>“We should…would you want to go to Hogsmeade together?” Angelina bit her lip. She sounded a little nervous, which Fred found peculiar since she was always so confident. She should be too. He always thought she was the best chaser of the girls.</p><p>“Sure.” He wasn’t sure why he said that. But he figured he was supposed to. They had a month until the next Hogsmeade weekend anyway, so he had plenty of time to figure out whatever was going on. “We could get some food?”</p><p>“That’d be great!” Somewhere in the distance, they heard a set of running feet. She glanced down the hallway. “We should go back. Snape is removing points like a crazy person if he catches you.”</p><p align="center">

Fred sighed and glanced around Madam Puddifoots. This date was not going well. The whole past month had a little odd. They had held hands walking to class. It was fine but sometimes Fred wanted his hand back. And Angelina had kissed him again once. He figured since he didn't dislike it everything was fine. Then when they were with friends and all talking and laughing he knew he really did like her. It was just when they were alone that everything was off kilter.</p><p>Angelina had already he couldn't talk Quidditch strategy for next year. She said that as much as she loved him she didn't want to talk about Harry's unjust life. She said that if they were to be eating treats she'd rather not hear about the candy that makes you vomit he was planning with George.</p><p>"Fred, come on you always have such great stories!"</p><p>Fred glanced around the room. There were some giddy Hufflepuffs in the corner. "I'm guessing you don't want to talk about homework?"</p><p>Angelina groaned. "Look, Fred, I know you haven't been on a date before. But" she sighed. "I like you. You're normally so funny! Just relax." She bit her lip. "Have you heard Burnt Bottom Cauldron's new song? They’re a bit underground but I love their music."</p><p>"No." Fred scanned the room again. Cassius Warrington was there was some Ravenclaw. That wasn't going to work out. "Lee listens to them I think. And George. He needs music to fall asleep."</p><p>Angelina followed his gaze. "Do you...do you have a crush on Sofia or something? If you don't like me you don't have to pretend Fred."</p><p>"Who? What? I like you." He did. Which was why he didn't understand why this was going to horrifically wrong. She was a good friend.</p><p>"Sofia Singh." Angelina tilted her head and stared at him. "She's on the date with Cassius...do you..." She trailed off. "Are you?"</p><p>"Am I what?"</p><p>She shook her head. "Nothing. I'm just being silly. Have you been following the Cannons? I know they're a Weasley favorite?"</p><p>Fred grinned. "Want to know a secret?" He lowered his voice. "They’re only my second favorite team. Don't tell Ronnie. My favorite are the Ballycastle Bats."</p><p>Angelina squealed. The rest of the date went well.</p><p align="center">
  <u> <b>24th of February 1995</b> </u>
</p><p align="left">Everyone cheered as the contestants dove into the water. Then they all stared at each other.</p><p>"Does this mean we just stare at the top of the lake for an hour?" Alicia asked.</p><p>"Guess so." Angelina sighed.</p><p>"The dragons were more fun to watch." Fred continued.</p><p>Lee began announcing the most ridiculous of commentaries. Everyone cracked up. Fred let his mind wander. He watched the crowd and landed on Cassius Warrington. He had watched Cassius enter his name in the goblet of fire. He and George had been joking, but Cassius, who had reached the age of majority just a few weeks earlier, was dead serious. He marched up there with such strength and confidence. Fred knew he would have done well. He wondered how watching all of the past few months had been, wondering what could have been.</p><p>"FRED!" A yank on his arm shook Fred out of his thoughts. Angelina looked pissed. The past month had continued like the previous. They held hands and kissed sometimes. It was okay.</p><p>She dragged him off to the side.</p><p>"Why do you keep staring at Cassius? What the hell Fred?"</p><p>"I was just wondering what he thought about all this. Since he entered the tournament and all. More seriously than George and me. Does he want the glory? Is he watching the tasks wondering how be could have fared? Does he want to know how Hogwarts would react to a Slytherin Champion?"</p><p>"I entered my name too."</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"I entered my name too, Fred. In the goblet. You could have asked me any of that. Asked me about how I felt. I was pissed at first if you were wondering. But the more I see the events and with Harry’s involvement the more I think the honor isn't worth it. But I bet you never even thought of asking me. You just don't like me do you?"</p><p>"I like you." Fred tried to protest.</p><p>"Yeah, maybe, but you don't want to date me. Fuck Fred. I'm more annoyed about the fact that my boyfriend would rather date Cassius than me then I am about not getting the glory."</p><p>Fred’s stomach lurched. “I don’t have a crush on Cassius.”</p><p>She sighed. “Look, just think about what I said. I like you, Fred. I want this to work out. Let’s just talk in a week or something.”</p><p align="center">
  <u> <b>3rd of March 1995</b> </u>
</p><p>Fred had spent the week ignoring everything. George had put some fireworks in Fred’s porridge and he didn’t even notice until they went off. He knew he deserved the singed eyebrows.</p><p>After potions, he and Angelina walked to the inner courtyard. They sat on a bench and looked at each other.</p><p>“Have you thought about what I said?”</p><p>Fred groaned. “I just don’t know why you think I don’t like you. Of course, I like you.”</p><p>Angelina looked disappointed. “It’s not that I think you don’t like me. It’s just…how do you like me?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Exactly! You like me more as a friend. That’s fine.”</p><p>“No..I…”</p><p>“What do you like about me? Or doing with me?”</p><p>“Umm.” Fred thought. “Quidditch. You’re smart.”</p><p>“Okay. I think we should break up. I like you, Fred, I really do. I hope we can be friends. I mean it, too. It’s just I was talking with Alicia you know, and she’s right. I am a strong independent black woman. I don’t need a man who doesn’t like me for me. I deserve better than that. I don’t need to get dragged along while you figure yourself out. I can be fierce on my own.”</p><p>“You talked to Alicia?” Fred’s stomach knotted.</p><p>Angelina looked up in surprise. “Well yeah, she’s my best friend Fred. Like you talked to George about everything.”</p><p>“I didn’t talk to George.”</p><p>Her eyes bulged. “Shit Fred. I didn’t think you were so. Look, it’s okay Fred. If you like guys or whatever. You take all the time you need to figure it out.” She looked at his face. “Actually, you know what, ignore me. I’m acting crazy.”</p><p>“I’m not. I don’t.”</p><p>“I mean, I still think we should break up. If you want to talk in a couple of months, or years, whatever, just let me know? I need a little time, but I’m here for you.” Fred stared at her. Angelina leapt forward and wrapped him in a hug. “You’re a great friend Fred.” Then she walked away.</p><p>Fred slid down to the ground. He stayed out there until the cold had sunk into his bones, trying to process what had just happened.</p>
