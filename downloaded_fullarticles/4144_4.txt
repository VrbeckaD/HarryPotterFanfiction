    <p>Voldemort scowled as yet another owl spelled only to go to Potter remained on his desk, the owl refusing to deliver it thus proving that it wouldn't get through. The more generic ones without such heavy secrecy spell work had all left and been bounced by the mail re-direct ward. Normally this latest modification to the spell protections on the letter would have gotten through just such a redirect ward. The fact that it didn't work meant that he would have to use even older methods if he was going to get the meeting he needed for the answers he had to have. Damn his grandfather to hell and back for this mess!</p><p>After the mess with this Gaunt-Potter marriage contract was sorted out, something he had been warned about by Severus, he would have to see what else he was missing. The remainder of the meeting would need to be used to discuss the supposed Prophecy and the control that Potter was obviously under by the old coot. Ruby eyes gleamed at the thought of possibly getting Potter onside, or at least neutral. He also wanted a word about some of the mental bleed through he had been receiving since the firm confirmation of their joint mind link in the minor Ministry confrontation.</p><p>Severus would just have to play messenger <i>after</i> they had a little <i>talk</i>. A quick summons and three hours later the Potions Master understood that he had one chance to get this right to avoid the death of a traitor. He would be gifted to Potter as a go-between and bodyguard as a gesture of good faith with the request that he did his best to maintain his place as a spy until Potter graduated. As a part of the transfer and binding Severus would relive Potter's memories to help him understand his new master.</p><p>Upon arriving back at the school he wasted no time in summoning his godson and sending one of the Slytherin Prefects to fetch Potter. The presentation <i>had</i> to be done right and he wasn't certain that Potter had been schooled in the proper procedure to keep the magic from backfiring on them.</p><p>"Professor?" Draco asked in puzzlement once they were in the man's office.</p><p>"I need you to walk Potter through the ritual to receive a messenger and acceptance of a message from an enemy house with gift. The Dark Lord ordered this and I would rather not be punished repeatedly as he stumbles through the acceptance," Severus said quietly. His lack of official emotionless mask told Draco they were talking as family rather than teacher and student.</p><p>"Are you the gift?" Draco asked, pale. It wasn't an uncommon tactic at the time the method was used if only to ensure private communication between lords or slip a spy into the other household.</p><p>"Yes," Severus said simply.</p><p>"I will use this opportunity to offer an end to our rivalry. I may have already lost mother and father and I don't also wish to loose you," Draco said firmly, drawing deeply on his pureblood upbringing to stay composed.</p><p>"Both are still alive but I understand your concern. As a last task before delivering myself and the message to Potter I am to inform you that your task has changed. You are to free Potter in so much as he either goes neutral or joins the dark if possible. I am also to warn you that because your mother and aunt forced me to make an Unbreakable Vow to aid you in your task failure will not only kill me but you will be required to take my place. If you can convince your mother and aunt to end the vow the punishment for it in the first place will be less," Severus informed his godson with a deep sigh of regret.</p><p>"They did <i>what?</i>" Draco whispered in pale shock.</p><p>"You are not being blamed for their actions. You were expected to fail your original task as it was meant as a lesson so that you understood what you were getting into as well as a punishment for your father's mess at the ministry last year. The Dark Lord has finally become more stable now that he is taking steps to address an outstanding magical contract that was until recently impossible to fulfill. The task was changed to keep it from killing me in case Narcissa and Bellatrix refuse to release me from the vow. The Dark Lord was... displeased to discover the three of us had risked my inside position by making the vow," Severus explained quietly.</p><p>"I'll try," Draco promised firmly.</p><p>"That is all I can ask for," Severus sighed just before Harry arrived, escorted by the 7th year Slytherin Prefect, who was promptly dismissed.</p><p>"You wanted to see me sir?" Harry asked warily.</p><p>"May I?" Draco asked, wanting to go first. Severus nodded his consent and retrieved the official message wrapped in green and silver ribbon bearing the seal of the Gaunt family pressed in the wax from his desk drawer.</p><p>"Potter, I wish to offer a truce between us. Will you accept?" Draco offered quietly, once more holding out his hand as if they were again heading to Hogwarts as first years.</p><p>"On the condition you tell me what the hell you've been doing all year and that you stop sabotaging my potions," Harry said firmly.</p><p>"I have been trying to do something that the Dark Lord ordered. My orders have changed and it was apparently meant for me to fail the other one in the first place as a lesson. It was in two parts, kill Dumbledore and get a raiding party into the school. My new task is to help you with whatever Uncle Severus brought for you. I have to help you through the official presentation before we know anything else," Draco answered honestly, his head held high. "I am willing to show you what I was doing to get them past the wards and help you destroy it as a show of good faith."</p><p>"What happens if I screw up the presentation?" Harry asked warily.</p><p>"Uncle Severus will be punished and have to try again," Draco answered honestly.</p><p>"You have your truce and I appreciate the help with the presentation thing," Harry informed him with a sharp sigh. The two young men nodded to each other and turned to face the Potions Master.</p><p>Severus moved around the desk, official parchment in hand and knelt in front of Lily's son. Harry was shocked into immobility long enough for the older man to start reciting.</p><p>"Harry Potter, Heir of House Potter, I come to you as a messenger from House Gaunt. Will you hear the message?" Severus' rich voice intoned formally.</p><p>"Say yes," Draco urged quietly.</p><p>"Er, I... Yes?" Harry stammered. In response Severus handed over the parchment and braced himself to re-live Potter's life.</p><p>Harry cautiously accepted the sealed parchment and opened it at Draco's urging. The message outlined the request for a temporary truce and a meeting to discuss matters with a promise of safe passage. It outlined the gifting of Severus as a gesture of good will. A single word would signal acceptance of the gift which would trigger the memory transfer.</p><p>"I am obviously missing something here," Harry started only to notice Draco tensing and looking at Snape with worry, only to hastily change what he was going to say. "Not that I am rejecting anything. I just need some clarification before I can answer."</p><p>Draco relaxed marginally before explaining. "I would need you to read me the message but from what Uncle Severus told me of my own new task something happened to make the Dark Lord need to talk to you really badly. I think he is trying to get out of having to fight you but I don't actually know. He might be angling for an actual truce or he might be looking for a proper alliance or even just trying to figure out if someone tricked him into going after you and your parents. What I do know is that giving you Uncle Severus means its serious and he won't risk breaking any offer of safe passage he probably gave you."</p><p>"I accept, <i>~truce~</i>," Harry said quietly, accepting both the gift and the message in the spirit in which they were given. The parseltongue word triggered the memory transfer and the only thing that kept Severus from collapsing under the onslaught with a choked gasp was the fact that he was already kneeling. Draco gently stopped him from interrupting the memory transfer as they watched Snape focus through the pain of the process.</p><p>"You are never going back to those <i>blasted</i> muggles again!" were the first words out of Severus' mouth after the transfer ended.</p><p>"Uncle Sev?" Draco asked cautiously.</p><p>"Go get your message journal Draco. I need a word with Harry and the journal will give us a faster way to talk to your father," Severus ordered. Draco uncertainly obeyed.</p><p>Professor?" Harry asked softly.</p><p>"Severus," the man corrected with a sigh as he stood but failed to retake his normal seat behind the desk. Severus instead chose to stand at attention with his hands clasped behind his back before his newest master. "I am now your bodyguard, servant, and go-between Mr. Potter. Whatever else may happen and whatever has happened in the past you may now count on me as one of your allies. I rather hope that one day your appallingly Gryffindor habits will allow us to actually become friends but I know my own actions may have forever put that option out of reach. I ask that you do not use serious blackmail against me if at all possible nor demand that I call you master. It is your right in any case but I have... poor memories of such instances. I also ask that should you need to punish me in the future that you not use a belt or the crucio spell, again poor memories. I do not wish to over react and accidentally harm you if I cannot hold my own reflexes."</p><p>"The trigger really gave you copies of my memories?" Harry asked in dread, ignoring the little speech he had just been given for the moment.</p><p>"Yes," Severus admitted, swallowing bile at the reminder of the contents of those memories. "Now that I am aware of the other circumstances involved in most of our past interactions I feel I must apologize and submit myself for discipline. Even just as your teacher I should have recognized there was something wrong and helped you. I allowed my past to blind me and I am truly ashamed of my actions."</p><p>"<i>All</i> of my memories?" Harry persisted. His eyes held not only the weight of painful knowledge but also power that would frighten even Albus Dumbledore.</p><p>"All of your memories," Severus agreed quietly, well aware of what was bothering his new master. "To be frank while the full knowledge of your yearly adventures terrified me and the knowledge of your home life enraged me, your... experiments relieved me. It showed that you weren't Dumbledore's puppet nor are you a fanatical defender of his policies. Although the fact you out argued the hat to go into Gryffindor over Slytherin and subverted several of your classmates, including the <i>Weasley twins</i>, was a bit of a shock."</p><p>"Potions?" Harry asked suspiciously.</p><p>"We will need to get you the beginner books and basically start over. How you managed an E on your O.W.L. I will never know. After drilling you in certain things you never learned or never learned properly we can likely bring you back up to your year level <i>provided</i> you don't hide anymore. We will need a public excuse for my change in attitude towards you, presuming you don't want my new position public knowledge immediately. I presume from your memories that as long as you are safe and <i>not</i> at the Dursleys over the summer you don't really care where you reside?" Severus asked cautiously. He was very firmly ignoring exactly how sore he was from the memory dump and the echoes of pain that came from the remembered trauma that Harry had already needed to live through for years.</p><p>"A lost bet usually works pretty well and yeah, I don't care for the Dursleys. Umbridge?" Harry asked, becoming more comfortable with this less abrasive version of the Potions Master as they talked civilly. Though it really did help that he didn't actually have to spell anything out for the other wizard.</p><p>"Lucius. Frankly, no matter the consequences after finding out about the quill she needs to be dealt with. She has put you all at risk and earned either a Dementor's Kiss from the Wizengamot or being torn apart by enraged parents. Her actions are unacceptable," Severus said darkly just as Draco returned with his message journal.</p><p>"What did I miss?" Draco asked with open curiosity as he dashed into the room and handed over his message journal.</p><p>"Plotting how to explain my changed attitude to the school and Dumbledore," Severus answered absently as he took the never out quill that came with the journal and dashed off a quick message to Lucius Malfoy. The quick reply had him smirking and returning the journal to his godson.</p><p>"I think we should go with a lost bet but what the bet was is still up for debate if we even go with a bet," Harry explained, unconsciously drawing the blond's attention to how much more relaxed he was now compared to when he had first arrived. "Nothing has been decided except that I accepted the truce to sort out stuff with the Dark Lord and that Professor Snape is mine now, like you said would happen."</p><p>"I just requested Lucius come to Hogwarts immediately to help with certain outstanding issues. Issues such as the fact that Umbridge was apparently forcing your classmates to use a <i>blood quill</i> during her detentions last year," Severus growled in obvious displeasure at the woman.</p><p>Draco gasped in shock before backing away from Harry and starting to babble. " I swear! I didn't know! I was just trying to get your attention! I didn't actually want you <i>tortured</i>!"</p><p>"Well... that's something at least. We're pretty sure she would have found a way to do it anyway and aren't we trying a personal truce in any case?" Harry offered, not really sure why Draco was panicking. He was more upset with the pink bitch over the <i>firsties</i> having to use the blood quill. Draco had just been his mostly normal annoying superior self last year and the had gotten him good a couple of times in retaliation already.</p><p>Draco nodded frantically and breathed a sigh of relief when Harry dropped it, returning to his discussion about the fake bet.</p><p>"So I was thinking a bet either with the twins or with Draco? Maybe that I could sneak into the lab after curfew and brew a potion from next year before leaving it in your office as proof and you were impressed? Or I made a bet with you about something? Maybe get you an ingredient that you can't normally get? Something from a Basilisk or other snake? Or I traded showing you the Chamber of Secrets for something and it impressed you?" Harry brainstormed.</p><p>"Perhaps we got into an argument and I accused you of not actually knowing where the Chamber was so we made a bet that if you could show it to me I would reduce my name calling and baiting you into snapping at me? Sadly the harassment that usually results in you getting extra detentions is actually a form of sneaky protection so that has to stay. At least with you aware you can do homework or read and dash over to sudsy cauldrons if anyone comes or pretend to be re-copying things out of a book for your detention. Incidentally, giving me cheek will be better for getting a detention should you need it rather than a potions mishap or sabotage," Severus pointed out.</p><p>"But you've never been to Salazar's Chamber?" Draco pointed out tentatively, trying to help.</p><p>"But I have Mr. Potter's memories of the Chamber... we really need to harvest that Basilisk at some point. The ingredients will be worth a fortune per half a foot of the beast. It will also allow us to set up an emergency fund separate from anything else you might own in case someone else gains or has control of your vaults," Severus pondered thoughtfully.</p><p>"Vaults? As in plural?" Harry asked in shock, eyes wide.</p><p>"Yes, Mr Potter, <i>vaults</i>," Lucius drawled as he stepped into the room, having flooed into Severus's quarters and walked to the man's office moments before. "I take it something is more amiss than we knew with Mr. Potter's situation judging by his question."</p><p>Severus snorted in a mix of derision and disgust at what was now blatantly obvious to him.</p><p>"Father I don't think he knows about his family," Draco answered for the other two, glancing worriedly over at his former rival. "The memory transfer hurt Uncle Severus bad enough that he looked like he was under a crucio. The first thing that he said when he came out of it was that Harry wasn't going back to his relatives, ever, then he sent me for my message journal."</p><p>"He wasn't taught a damn thing except the basics of muggle school and how to act as a general house elf who is under regular punishment for no reason," Severus practically exploded. "Lucius, <i>'Tuny</i> had him and they <i><b>starved</b></i> him nearly to <i><b>DEATH</b></i>! On a regular basis no less! Without magic as strong as the Dark Lord's he wouldn't have lasted the <i>first year</i> in their poor excuse for care. His book list and other wizarding learning materials were either sabotaged, left off the list, or simply not taught to him. He has <i>less</i> knowledge about our world than a new muggleborn student who barely glanced through the orientation materials."</p><p>The mouths of both blonds dropped open in horrified shock as Harry stood off to one side uncomfortably looking at the floating preserved ingredients that Snape kept on the shelves in his office.</p><p>"He has absolutely no idea what he has done," Lucius whispered in horrified shock.</p><p>"Potter?" Draco asked his father, mouth dry.</p><p>"And Dumbledore. This... changes <i>everything</i>," Lucius breathed.</p><p>"It changes nothing," Severus countered continuing over the beginning objections of both Malfoys and Harry's sharp look. "Without documentation they will simply say he failed whatever test he is given on purpose. He needs to see the goblins. They are a neutral power and if his accounts have also been tampered with they will already be angry enough at the thieves to help more than usual."</p><p>"His education will still need correcting and I noticed you said nothing about Heir or Lordship training. Must I presume that he had nothing there either?" Lucius pointed out.</p><p>"Yes," Severus agreed curtly. "With Mr. Potter's permission I recommend having the Dark Lord present for our business with the goblins, the documentation, and deciding what needs to be rectified first. If we are lucky they can also use the meeting to sort out whatever the Dark Lord wanted to discuss so urgently."</p><p>"And how exactly are we going to manage that with me being basically under 24 hour guard?" Harry asked sardonically.</p><p>"The DA," Severus answered simply.</p><p>"Why in hell would I drag them into this?!" Harry demanded, eyes narrowed in anger.</p><p>"His defense club from last year? ... that could work," Draco nodded thoughtfully, eyes watching Harry in gleeful calculation. "If I insult the group as a whole... make it a challenge to his skill as a teacher..."</p><p>"Their O.W.L.s speak for themselves," Harry cut him off sharply.</p><p>"We can tell the twins, Longbottom, and Lovegood what we are actually doing," Severus pointed out. Harry glowered in response, still not liking the idea.</p><p>"The idea is that I challenge your club into getting you to Gringotts for an inheritance test, something you should have already had anyway. It would be an open challenge in front of the teachers so no one can say they didn't know what was going on. It will be harder to stop it if someone is playing puppet master with everything you were supposed to have learned already," Draco pointed out reasonably.</p><p>"The suspected traitors can suddenly find themselves in detention or banned from helping. I would be designated as the person to certify success or failure on behalf of the school and staff so that I could be there at the bank and return with you openly. It would also allow us, should we choose to do so, to leak or flat out announce your results. Such would make it impossible for anyone to deny you your heritage as is being done now," Severus pointed out.</p><p>"Considering someone is using your Wizengamot seats. The very seats that are trying to force laws through about you being restricted to Hogwarts or the muggle's residence without a permanent escort. An escort with the authority to order you to kill and force you to do so. Not that the wording of the supposed law is that obvious but its dreadfully obvious when one reads between the lines. It is especially true in conjuncture with the companion law that will legally list anyone with the Dark Mark as <i>rabid cattle</i>," Lucius explained with tightly controlled anger.</p><p>"Not only was I unaware that I had a voice in the Wizengamot but I <i>did not</i> authorize any of that," Harry spat darkly, mirroring Lucius' anger.</p><p>"Of course you didn't but your magical guardian might have," Draco pointed out reasonably.</p><p>"He is unaware of any guardian but his muggle relatives. I don't want to speculate on if he even has one to avoid prejudicing any tests on guardianship the goblins might have him take. I am hardly familiar with their procedures except when it comes to commissioned potions," Severus pointed out carefully.</p><p>"Fair enough. As to getting me to the bank... <i>if</i> Draco can talk the twins into helping I'll allow it but I have to be openly against it to keep Dumbledore off me. Getting the rest of the Slytherins involved or making it so that at least half the school, preferably those raised muggle, join me in getting tested would add to it. I might even offer up a forfeit for managing to get every last teacher and student tested, barring Dumbledore, Hagrid, and Trelawny. Of course I'd let everyone who had an inheritance test already get away with presenting a copy of that older one but a new one is better," Harry smirked. His sly refinements had the other three looking at him in surprise.</p><p>"That is an excellent idea! As a gesture of good will on behalf of House Malfoy to House Potter House Malfoy offers to pay for a basic health exam and an inheritance test at Gringotts for every student 5th year and above," Lucius offered with a smirk.</p><p>"No hard feeling about Dobby? You practically gave him to me with his dangerous stalking in second year after all," Harry inquired curiously.</p><p>Lucius failed to stop a bark of laughter that sounded like low tone bells as his friend smirked at him knowingly and his son stared in shock.</p><p>"No, no hard feelings. Though you might want to bind him to you properly now that you've admitted that you knew he was a gift," Lucius pointed out as he forced his chuckles into submission so that only a smirk remained.</p><p>"Why is he so... erratic?" Harry asked carefully.</p><p>"He needs to be treated as a good worker when he does things well rather than as an equal. They are actually closer to being brownies like the elves in the old muggle story about the shoe maker. The situation is symbiotic and the reason he is getting worse right now is because he isn't grounded by a link to a wizard or a magical family. The magical bond helps regulate the magic so that their lives don't simply pour out of them like water. Working is important to them, almost to the point of being a religion for them," Severus explained, knowing exactly where Harry was coming from. "The kick Lucius gave him was more play acting than a real kick, especially with how extra durable house elves are because of how their magic is."</p><p>"Ah... that makes a lot more sense," Harry said nodding in understanding. "Dobby!"</p><p>Dobby happily popped in and before he could start praising Harry he noticed the Malfoys. In keeping with his role of rescued house elf he pretended to be somewhat cowed by their presence.</p><p>"Now to bind him to you properly Dobby first needs to know that you were treated as a traitor house elf ever since you were smaller than an elfling. He also needs to know that we still don't know who arranged for that and that you don't know how to be a wizard master to an elf because you are still learning to be a regular wizard like a first year already knows. Once he understands this he or you will try to feel the other with just your magic and let the two magics just look at each other. It will happen quickly after that as the magic often has more say than the elf or the wizard. Dobby will receive the same memory transfer that I did," Severus instructed, aiming half his words at Dobby.</p><p>Dobby was shocked at the meaning behind the Potion Master's words and it just increased the little elf's resolve to bond with his Mister Harry Potter sir. Their magics practically leapt at each other, trying to look closely at the other and causing the bond to form spontaneously.</p><p>"Dobby has an old coot and some muggles to kill," Dobby said angrily after processing the memories without the backlash Severus had needed to suffer through. He caught his tired master before Harry could stumble and levitated him into Severus' arms. Nodding approvingly he returned to the kitchens with plans to corner both Kreacher and Winky and speak to them about a <i>proper</i> elf bonding with his master. He would leave his non-elf targets alone for now because he knew that Harry didn't want him actually committing murder just yet on his behalf. On the other hand making Dumbledore and the DA traitors very uncomfortable was well within his rights as Harry's elf.</p><p>"A nap, I think, then we can join dinner," Severus said thoughtfully even as Harry dropped off in his arms.</p>
