    <b>• Part One: Fantastic First Dates •</b>
  </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> "And then," Newt says, choking on his laughter, barely able to get the rest of his story out. "As luck would have it, the monkey grabs a hold of Tina's cloak and starts shaking her all about, trying to take it off of her. Well, I had to do <em>something</em>, of course. Defend her honor."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> "What chivalry! He's your little knight in shining armor, Teenie," Queenie giggles, clapping a hand over her heart and delighting in the way it makes both Newt and Tina blush and cast their eyes to the floor.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> "Oh yeah, <em>my hero</em>," Tina laughs, rolling her eyes. "You know, you didn't have to <em>stun</em> the monkey, Newt! That guard looked so suspicious…I'm surprised we didn't get thrown out of the zoo."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> Queenie raises an eyebrow, looking back and forth between the both of them.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> "I didn't <em>stun</em> him! It was a simple freezing charm, most commonly used to tame Cornish Pixies," Newt says, a little defensively.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> "Since when does a freezing charm make soap bubbles come out of someone's ears?" Tina teases. </span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> Queenie clasps her hands to her mouth to stifle another round of giggles.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> "It…well…<em>alright, </em>there <em>might </em>have been a bit of an accident on the ship coming over here, and perhaps now my wand's gone a bit faulty…but my intentions were true, I assure you," he explains, smoothing out his waistcoat and offering Tina a small smile.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> Without warning, Queenie gasps and playfully smacks her sister on the arm.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> "Tina, you're so bad!" she laughs, mouth hanging open in shock.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> Tina's eyes grow wide, cheeks reddening as she realizes what Queenie must've just overheard inside her head. </span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> <em>Faulty wand…uh oh…I hope that's not a euphemism for his—</em></span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> Newt cocks his head to the side, clearly confused, staring back and forth between the two of them as he waits for one of them to explain what he'd just missed. Queenie opens her mouth, her complete lack of a filter making her all too eager to share every detail of her sister's dirty mind with poor, unsuspecting Newt, when Tina aims a swift kick at one of her shins from under the dining room table, and Queenie immediately shuts up.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> "Ah— Ow! At…um, freezing charms," Queenie lies, rubbing her leg and shooting a pointed glare at her sister. "Yeah, Tina's terrible at them."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> "Uh huh, I sure am," Tina mumbles with fake enthusiastic agreement, shuffling leftover potatoes around on her plate and thinking the word <em>sorry</em> really hard at her sister. </span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> "Oh, well that's alright," Newt says, offering Tina an encouraging smile, completely oblivious to the Goldstein sisters' silent exchange. "You're quite good at repair spells, though, if today was any indication. <em>Much</em> better than I am. My pocketwatch fell out of my jacket and was smashed to bits, but Tina mended it for me in a heartbeat. I'd wager you could have my wand performing at full capacity if you gave it a go—"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> "Oh my god," Tina whispers, blushing bright red and hiding her face in her hands.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> "Not that I <em>expect </em>you to tinker with my wand, or anything," Newt backpedals, mistaking Tina's embarrassment for irritation, worried that he'd somehow offended her and that his intended compliment had backfired. The last thing he wants is for Tina to think he's just using her for her handiwork, after all. "With how finicky and complicated wands can be, I imagine it would be quite hard—"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> Tina shoots Queenie a desperate look, shouting <em>help me</em> inside her head.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> "Newt, honey," Queenie says gently, pursing her lips together to keep from bursting out laughing. "Tell me more about what you and Tina got up to today! I want to hear all about it!"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> Taking Queenie's cue, Newt launches into an animated tale about their exciting city tour: a lovely stroll through Central Park, admiring the beautiful spring flowers that had just started to bloom, playing with friendly dogs that ran rampant through the park chasing tennis balls and fetch toys, taste-testing pastries and cappuccinos at all the local cafés, touring the Met and whispering criticisms and comparisons of no-maj vs. wizarding artists to one another when the tour guide wasn't looking, wondering how in the world muggles could possibly be interested in art that just stays still all the time. </span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> He makes wild gestures with his hands, smiles earnestly, and laughs loudly as he recalls even the smallest of details…details that Tina herself had forgotten as the day had gone on. But Newt had captured everything in his memory, right down to the way she prefers her coffee, and her favorite flavor of pastry. They'd already done so much together, it was hard to believe that Newt had only been there for a grand total of two days. As she watches him, Tina thinks back to the moment Newt had first arrived on her doorstep, holding his fantastic case filled with all manner of magical creatures in one hand, and the letter he'd written her, detailing the time and date of his arrival, clutched in the other. (Apparently, the Royal Star Steam Co. travels faster than the post.)</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> Without word or warning, he'd handed her a worn and beaten journal with bits of yellowing parchment sticking out at odd ends, filled with scribbled-out passages and brightly-colored ink blotches: his original, one-of-a-kind, handwritten manuscript. <em>Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</em> had finally been submitted for publication, he'd explained, but he was far too excited to wait for the official printed copies to hit the shelves of Flourish and Blott's, so the moment Obscurus Books had given him back his original manuscript, he'd rushed off to purchase tickets and boarded the first ship setting sail for America.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> "I hope that's alright," he'd said, worrying his lower lip. "I suppose I just…got a bit carried away in the excitement of it all, and I didn't want to keep you waiting on the copy I'd promised you the last time we saw each other. I'd imagine…months would go by and you…well, you'd probably have forgotten all about me by then."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> "I would never forget you, Newt," Tina sighed, grinning at him like an idiot and determinedly ignoring Queenie's unmistakable bought of giggles issuing from the kitchen. "But I could never keep your original manuscript. It's far too—"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> "Oh goodness, you're absolutely right. Of course you'd want a fresh copy. Not this battered, unintelligible dribble I've brought you," Newt apologized, lowering his eyes in embarrassment and reaching out to take back his book.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> "Precious," Tina finished, arms wrapped around the worn leather, clutching it close to her heart and cradling it like an occamy egg. "I was going to say that it's far too <em>precious</em>."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> "Oh," Newt sighed, looking thoroughly relieved, the tips of his ears growing red.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> They stood there like that for a long while, just staring at one another; Tina in the doorway of her apartment, Newt awkwardly shifting his weight from one foot to the other in the hallway, until Tina finally snapped out of her reverie and welcomed him inside.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> His arrival had been most unexpected. </span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> Unexpected, but by no means <em>unwelcome</em>. </span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> The moment she saw him standing there with his bright, hopeful eyes, his tousled ginger hair and sun-kissed freckles, and his adorable, sheepish grin, all of the feelings she'd been fighting so hard to quell came rushing back. Even after several months spent apart, it felt like no time had passed at all. And in just two days, they had already done so much together.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> Tina smiles as she watches Newt, ignoring the little tickling sensation at the back of her mind that means Queenie can hear everything she's thinking, can practically <em>feel</em> every emotion she's feeling as they all bubble up to the surface. For once, Tina doesn't fight it, heart swelling in her chest each time Newt's smile grows impossibly wider. She tells herself that it's okay to feel this way, to let herself be happy. That she <em>deserves</em> to be happy. Out of the corner of her eye, Queenie gives her an encouraging smile.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> "It was truly lovely," Newt finishes, catching Tina's gaze and holding it for a moment too long. "But not nearly as lovely as the company."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> Tina's face grows hot as she stifles an embarrassing giggle-snort, chastising herself for <em>giggling</em> about a <em>boy</em> like a schoolgirl with a crush. </span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> An incredibly charming boy. </span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> Who just told her that she's lovely. </span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> <em>Oh my god.</em></span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> "Thank you, Newt. I had a lovely time with you, too," she says quietly, bowing her head to avoid looking directly at him.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> Newt mumbles something unintelligible, a soft blush creeping into the curves of his cheekbones. His eyes roam the dining room, pointedly avoiding the entire corner in which Tina is sitting, and taking a sudden, intense interest in a small tear in his waistcoat.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> "Well," Queenie says, breaking the silence and popping up from the dining room table with far too much energy for a person who'd spent the whole day in a cramped little office. "It's getting late. I should go to bed. Got another long day tomorrow. Which reminds me…are you going into work tomorrow, Tina?"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> "Oh, um. No, actually. I requested some time off this week so I could…you know, since Newt's here, I thought I should…show him the sights," Tina finishes rather lamely.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> Queenie hums thoughtfully in response, mumbling a mischievous <em>I'm sure you will</em> under her breath as she clears the table with a swift flick of her wand, and then bids them both goodnight, sweeping from the living room and leaving a deafening silence in her wake.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> Tina opens her mouth several times, poised on the edge of a potential new conversation topic, and then closes it. Newt picks incessantly at the hole in his waistcoat, making it worse. He could fit his whole hand in there now, if he tried. And so he does. And now he's trying to shake it loose, flailing all about, and Tina is laughing at him, pulling out her wand, and releasing him from the unforgiving fabric. Within seconds, she's mended the hole, and his waistcoat looks as good as new.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> "Thank you," he says with a small, embarrassed smile. "I must remember that spell."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> Tina smiles and nods, waiting for Newt to say something else, so that the silence won't keep stretching on. They're both grown adults, for God's sake. After everything they've been through together, it shouldn't be <em>this</em> hard to strike up a conversation with him. After all, they'd talked all day long, and had a wonderful time of it. </span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> But then, Tina supposes, that's because they'd been constantly on the move, running from one exhibit to the next, surrounded by all things bright and beautiful, enveloped in the bustling crowds of New York. They'd had a never-ending supply of people and things <em>to</em> talk about. But <em>now</em>…well…here they are, sitting at her dining room table, well past a decent hour in the evening. </span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> Just the two of them. </span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> Tina's eyes flicker to her bedroom door.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> This is entirely new territory. </span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> This is…<em>a courtship?</em></span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> Tina has a brief moment of panic as she wonders whether or not Newt actually has an interest in pursuing her romantically, or if he just views her as a friend. After all, it's not like they've known each other very long. Two days spent chasing down obscurials, magical creatures, and a wicked criminal masquerading as her asshole coworker, followed by several months and a whole ocean apart hardly qualifies as the start of a good relationship. </span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> But then, she reminds herself that this man sitting across the table from her had travelled halfway across the world just to deliver the original, handwritten copy of his prized book to her, because he couldn't wait another few weeks or months or however long it might have taken for the official printed copies to be published. </span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> Tina chances a look over at him, hoping for some kind of a sign. Newt meets her gaze almost instantly, and his lips curve into the most glorious, goofiest smile that Tina has ever seen. Her heart soars and she can't help but beam back at him, feeling a prickle of warmth beneath the apples of her cheeks.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> Yes, this is<em> definitely</em> new territory. </span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> Well, she knows one thing that might help loosen them both up.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> "Nightcap?" Tina asks before her brain can thoroughly think it through, hopping up in a bouncy imitation of Queenie.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> "Oh! Erm, yes, alright," Newt agrees hesitantly. He's not much of a drinker, per se, aside from the occasional two fingers of scotch in an heirloom snifter while he scribbles notes in the margins of his manuscript, but he'll take any excuse to stay in her company a little while longer.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> "Have you got butterbeer, by any chance?" he asks, thinking fondly of his school trips to Hogsmeade.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> Tina spins around on her heel.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> "Oh, um. No, sorry," she says, regretfully. "That's a British drink, right? I've never had it myself, but I hear it's delicious."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> "It is! Tastes like butterscotch candies," Newt says with a reminiscent smile.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> "Mmm, that does sound good," Tina says. "But I'm pretty sure it'd have to be imported, and with the way things are now, it's hard enough to—"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> "Right, yes, of course. I'd imagine it would be rather difficult to obtain <em>muggle</em> liquor right now, let alone a specialty drink made by our kind," Newt says thoughtfully. "Yet another backwards law, in my opinion. Doesn't seem to matter if you're muggle or magic, this country has a bad habit of banning people from doing as they please."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> "Yeah, I suppose we do," Tina laughs nervously.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> "I'll just…go and see what we <em>do</em> have, then. Um…why don't you head into the living room and make yourself comfortable? I'll be out in just a sec," Tina says, making a beeline for the kitchen cabinets. </span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> Newt nods in agreement, and wanders out into the living room. His brows furrow as he surveys the seating arrangement, staring back and forth between an armchair and a loveseat for an inordinate amount of time before finally settling onto the far end of the loveseat, hands poised on the ends of his knees as he waits for Tina to return. There's a bit of clinking, a small shatter, and a murmured curse as Tina repairs a broken teacup, and then a few moments later, she returns, holding two elegant crystal goblets, and a bottle of—</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> "Honey wine," Tina says, holding up the rose gold bottle. "Elf-made, I think. Queenie got it from a guy at work who's sweet on her. I doubt she'll mind if we have a little taste."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> "I would be delighted," Newt says, eyes widening in slight trepidation as Tina fills his glass to the brim. </span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> They sip their wine slowly, the silence cut only when Newt splutters and coughs.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> "Oh god, is it really <em>that </em>bad?" Tina asks, concerned.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> "No, no, it's quite good, actually," he assures her, banging a hand on his chest. "It just went down the wrong way!"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> "Oh," Tina says, laughing in relief.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> Newt notices that Tina is still standing, shifting her weight from one foot to the other, one hand holding onto her wine glass, the other weaving through her short, wavy, brown hair, twisting and untwisting a lock…the same one, he remembers with a little flip of his heart, that he'd tucked behind her ear the day he'd sailed back to England. </span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> Not wanting to look foolish, Newt decides that he should probably be standing as well. He pops up from the loveseat and paces back and forth, finally settling into a little nook between the wall and the fireplace, resting one elbow upon the mantle. </span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> As the honey wine swims through their veins, the two of them finally start to loosen up a little, reliving their tour through the art museum, and giggling madly as they recount all the jokes they'd made about the no-maj passersby.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> "And do you remember the one," Tina says, clutching her stomach as she buckles over in laughter, nearly spilling her third glass of wine. "With the lime green bowler hat? I mean, <em>come on</em>, did he get dressed in the dark or something?" </span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> "He must have! It was atrocious," Newt agrees, chuckling quietly. "Oh, we're being so catty, but I quite like it."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> "Me too," Tina admits, blushing slightly as she remembers the way Newt had leaned in close to whisper in her ear, making her laugh so hard and so loud that all the surrounding no-majs had given her dirty looks. Normally, she would care about something like that. Normally, it would make her feel self-conscious. She hated breaking rules and disrupting courtesy, but with Newt there, she found that she hardly cared. It was like the rest of the world had fallen away, and it was just the two of them, sharing this fantastic secret that was theirs alone.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> "You're so easy to talk to," she says, smiling to herself. "Well, no, actually, you're not. I mean, I <em>love</em> talking to you, it's just that normally, you make me kind of nervous. So, you know, the liquor helps."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> Tina pauses for a moment, replaying what she'd just admitted in her head. </span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> "Oh god. Um. Not that I <em>need</em> liquor to talk to you. You're great on your own. You just…well, you make me feel a little…" Tina trails off, that familiar old blush creeping back into her cheeks.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> "Nervous?" Newt asks with a soft lilt to his voice, caught somewhere between intrigue and concern. </span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> Tina splutters, choking on the sip of wine she'd taken to try to avoid any more word vomit.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> "I meant that in a good way," she amends, but no explanation that makes any kind of actual sense comes to mind.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> "I make you nervous in a good way?" Newt teases, an impish smile reminiscent of the Cheshire Cat spreading across his face as he reads between the lines and works out what she'd accidentally confessed.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> "Why do I make you nervous, Tina?" he growls softly, his voice like finely aged whiskey curling around every syllable of her name, savoring it like a delicacy. </span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> Newt delights in the way it makes her weak at the knees, smiles even wider when her breath audibly hitches and she bites her lower lip. He doesn't quite understand why, but somehow, her admission of nervousness had momentarily quelled his own, giving him the push he needed. He sets his wine glass down on the mantelpiece, runs his fingers through his hair, and fixes her with a coquettish smile, his hazel eyes lighting up at the sight of her, wide-eyed and lost for words.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> Tina splutters, swallowing thickly and licking her lips in anticipation as he saunters toward her, a wicked glint in his eyes. He's fire and mischief and beautiful and impossible and adorable and sexy all at once, and <em>how the hell</em> does this walking contradiction of a man manage to pull that off? </span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> <em>This is it</em>, she thinks. He's going to kiss her, and <em>oh god</em>, there isn't enough alcohol in the world to calm her nerves right now. She's been dreaming of this moment for months now, replaying every possible scenario (and, thanks to crippling anxiety, every possible avenue of failure) in her head, musing over what his lips might taste like, how soft they'd probably feel pressed against her own. God, the things Queenie must've overheard these past few months…</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> A wave of panic and excitement floods her chest, heart thundering, palms slick against her wine glass as she struggles to keep hold of it. He's coming toward her, loosening his bowtie and tugging on the collar of his white button-down shirt until it's upturned slightly, like he just <em>knows</em> she's been dying to grab a hold of it and pull him flush against her. </span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> And then the tip of one of his boots catches on a snag in the carpeting, and he's stumbling, flailing like a baby giraffe learning how to walk, knees giving out as he topples over, and crashes face-first onto the floor. </span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> Tina bursts out laughing; a loud, bellowing roar that rattles her ribcage and makes her spill wine all down the front of her blouse. She sets down her glass and sprints toward him, offering a hand to help him up.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> "Oh, Newt, honey. Are you alright?" she asks, giggling uncontrollably, all of the tension and anticipation of kissing this ridiculous man gone, replaced with the comfortable notion that he's just as nervous and clumsy as she is. </span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> It's humbling, really. And in a way, entirely, perfectly <em>them</em>. </span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> Newt, meanwhile, doesn't seem to share this sentiment. He lies on the floor, sighing in exasperation, surrendering to gravity and rotten luck.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> "Right, well," he says, his voice muffled by the fluffy rug. "Just what I needed, wasn't it? Face full of carpet."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> "Not one of your more graceful moments," Tina admits with a sympathetic smile, laughter fading into a lighthearted sigh as she grabs a hold of Newt's hand and pulls him up off the floor. "But, if it's possible, you just got even more adorable."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> "You think I'm adorable?" Newt asks softly, and Tina tenses as she feels his breath sweep across her neck. It's in that moment that she realizes just how close he's standing, their chests nearly pressed together as he hovers a mere whisper above her. She chances a look up at him, his eyes bright and hopeful as he stares down at her with a vulnerable intensity. She feels his fingers twitch against her wrist, and remembers that they're still holding hands. Tina bites her lower lip, and Newt's eyes follow her every movement.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> <em>If ever there was a redeeming first kiss moment</em>, Tina muses<em>, this would be it.</em></span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> "Well then, I suppose I should…erm," Newt quavers, swallowing back several months' worth of <em>what-ifs</em>, spent wondering what <em>could have been</em> if he'd just—</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> Kissed her. </span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> He should have kissed her. </span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> And he's <em>known</em> that he should have kissed her from the moment he'd boarded that ship. But just as he'd reached forward to gently cup her face in his hands, his nerves had gotten the better of him, and after a few seconds' hesitation, he'd simply tucked back a loose lock of her hair, fingertips ghosting over the side of her face in a dulcet caress. </span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> He'd made it halfway to the boarding ramp when he finally convinced himself to double back, resolute with every intention of…well, <em>asking</em> if he could kiss her, honestly, as he didn't want to be impolite and just assume…</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">
    <em> So sorry, but how would you feel if I—</em>
  </span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> But the tears glistening in her eyes made him feel like he'd just swallowed his own heart, and he'd faltered, falling back on something safe and familiar, forgoing romantic spontaneity and using the publication of his book as a flimsy excuse to come back and see her at some indeterminable time in the future. </span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> And now, here he was, many months later, arriving on her doorstep unannounced, and he couldn't even manage to uphold his end of the deal. He thinks of the tattered mess of leather-bound scribbles he'd given Tina in lieu of an actual published book, of how keen and desperate he must have come across, and a furious blush creeps across his cheeks.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> Still, the way she's looking at him just now…perhaps this isn't as one-sided as he'd feared. His eyes dance over her every feature, drinking her in; her eyes, alight with wonder, lips curved into a euphoric smile. His eyes linger, as they so often do, on her lips; soft, full, lightly reddened from the wine. He wonders if, like the wine, Tina's lips taste of wildflowers, honey, and cinnamon. He's so close, he could just—</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> Tina's eyes flutter closed, lips forming a perfect pout, and Newt's heart stops.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> "I…erm…it's getting late," he says with a heavy sigh, fumbling with his pocketwatch and pretending to check the time. "I should probably head back to the, er…hotel. Go to bed, as it were."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> "Mmm," Tina says, smile wilting as Newt steps back out of her personal space and begins to collect his things. </span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> He's all talk, he knows, wavering from foolhardy bursts of confidence to waxing and waning uncertainty in a manner of seconds. He tells himself that it just isn't the right moment, that it needs to be something <em>bigger</em> and <em>better</em> than midnight in the middle of Tina's living room after a few glasses of wine. That a woman like Tina deserves fireworks, and candlelight, and, if he thought he could actually manage it, the moon on a string. He's been planning this moment in his head for months, and it needs to be perfect.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> "But I should very much like to see you tomorrow, if you'll have me?" he asks with a tentative, hopeful smile.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> <em>If you'll have me.</em> </span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> An electric shiver runs down Tina's spine at those words, but before her mind can wander into unseemly territory again, she quickly dismisses that train of thought.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> "I would be delighted," she says, smiling brightly. "Meet me outside my building around 9 o'clock? We can stop by Jacob's bakery for breakfast."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> "Oh!" Newt exclaims, perking up at the mention of his dear friend. "Does he…I mean to say, did the memory spell—"</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> "No," Tina sighs, heart breaking a little as Newt's cheerful expression wavers. "But Queenie and I are regulars! We're in and out of there all the time…well, her more so than me. He…he knows us only as his loyal customers now. But he seems happy."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> "Of course." Newt smiles wistfully. "All is as it should be, I suppose."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> "Still, I thought you might like to see him," Tina says, offering him a small, encouraging smile.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> "Absolutely. It's not often you get a second chance at a first impression," Newt says, pulling his jacket up around his shoulders as he prepares to take his leave. He inclines his head in a small bow. "Well then, Miss Goldstein, until tomorrow."</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> "Goodnight, Newt," Tina says, memorizing the affectionate smile he gives her, right before he turns on his heel and twists out of sight. Tina stands there for a moment, watching the spot he'd just vanished from for a bit longer than she'd care to admit. After a few moments, she sighs and shakes her head, plunking down onto the worn, cozy cushions of her favorite armchair, and making a never-ending checklist of all the reasons <em>why</em> the ever-charming Newt Scamander makes her so nervous.</span>
