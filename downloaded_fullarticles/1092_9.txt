    <p>He dialed with a shaking hand, biting his lip against the pain. That woman had done a number on his shoulder with those freaky fingers of hers.</p><p>His adrenaline was already at heart-attack-inducing levels when it spiked again.</p><p>The streetlight just zapped out.</p><p>“Damnit, Roy, answer the phone!” He pleaded.</p><p>“I’m going to have to ask you to put the phone down, sir.”</p><p>Startled yet again, Hughes whipped around, shocked to see Sergeant Ro-</p><p>Wait. </p><p>That’s not Maria Ross. </p><p>When he pointed out the discrepancy, he watched in growing horror as the being in front of him swiped their hand over their cheek, somehow moving her mole, to become an <em>exact replica of Ross.<br/>
</em></p><p>Hughes was having a really hard time keeping down his panic now, and the second and third nearby streetlights going out wasn’t helping. </p><p>Nothing prepared him for the horror of seeing his wife’s face on that monster when he whipped around, knife barely glinting in his tight grip. </p><p>He froze. </p><p>He was going to die. He knew it. </p><p>What if that <em>thing</em> became him? What if it got close to Gracia, to Elicia?</p><p>
  <em>‘Oh, God, please no.’</em>
</p><p>Just as that terrifying thought shattered his world, the creature with his wife’s face grinned a sickening grin that had no place on Gracia’s face. It moved to pull the trigger...</p><p>...and was blown backwards by a flash of red light. </p><p>Clearly, the blood loss was starting to get to him. </p><p>
  <em>“What is it this time, Hughes?”</em>
</p><p>The voice came from the receiver still in his slack grip.</p><p>“R... Roy?” He mumbled. </p><p>
  <em>“Hughes? What’s going on? Why aren’t you calling from a secure line?”</em>
</p><p>Hughes glanced at the phone, somehow still in his hand. </p><p><em>‘Huh</em>. <em>Guess that blast wasn’t Roy.’</em></p><p>With a great effort, Maes pulled his mind back to his present predicament. The abomination was getting up. </p><p>“Roy, it’s a transmutation circle, the whole damn country. It’s been set up from the star- ngh!”</p><p>He was interrupted by the bullet that wedged itself deep in his shoulder, the one the first woman had already sliced. He glanced up to see the creature approaching, having recovered from the blast and grown incredibly angry, her more-than-likely-stolen firearm aimed at him again. </p><p>
  <em>“Hughes! Where are you?!”</em>
</p><p>Maes could hear the panic in Roy’s voice, but he couldn’t bring himself to feel the same. Belatedly, he realized his arm holding the phone had dropped. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw a burst of flames.</p><p>“Roy?”</p><p>Another bang and another pain, this time in his hip. With a cry, Maes fell, hitting the wall of the phone booth on his way down. </p><p>
  <em>“HUGHES!!”</em>
</p><p>Maes opened his eyes, briefly wondering when he had closed them. He needed to answer Roy before it was too late. </p><p>“Office... East... Park... Phone...”</p><p>
  <em>“Hang on, Maes, I’m on my way.”</em>
</p><p>The man listened to the beep of the dial tone as he tried getting his thoughts back together. He lifted his head up to see more flashes of light like before, but not all of them red. His brow furrowed. </p><p>
  <em>‘If that blast wasn’t Roy, who is that?’</em>
</p><p>Before he could determine the identity of his savior, a searing pain erupted in his side. Looking down, he watched as the long, black fingers slid out from his stomach. </p><p>“Hurgh!”</p><p>He coughed, the wet, body-shaking variety, tasting iron on his tongue. </p><p>
  <em>‘Damnit, Roy. If you try to come, you’ll get yourself killed. Wish I could have said goodbye to my girls first.’</em>
</p><p>Then the world turned black. </p><p> </p><p>*****</p><p> </p><p>Roy wasted no time.</p><p>“Lieutenant, Hughes needs us!”</p><p>The woman, having burst into her superior’s office at his earlier worried yelling, displayed her guns always on her, holding out a hand, waiting for her superior. </p><p>The Colonel himself tore open a drawer, snatching a pair of his gloves and his wand, before taking his subordinate’s offered hand and apparating to the area Hughes described. </p><p> </p><p>*****</p><p> </p><p>When Dumbledore knocked on the door of Number 4 Privet Drive, he was livid. The very air about him crackled. </p><p>Why was he there only four years after dropping off the Boy Who Lived? Because of the report from Arabella of course. </p><p>He had asked the kind, elderly squib to spy a little on the Dursleys, just to keep an eye on Harry, and she agreed. Once she moved into the neighborhood, it hadn’t taken too long before Petunia had managed to scare off another babysitter, and when she did, Mrs. Figg was ready to fill that spot.</p><p>Imagine her horror upon finding evidence of abuse on the scrawny, underfed, bruised, black-haired savior of the wizarding world.</p><p>She had sent an owl to Dumbledore immediately, and the man managed to arrive minutes before the Dursleys were scheduled to return. Dumbledore had taken one look at the small, quiet child and rage boiled in his veins.</p><p>He had a few quiet words with Arabella, before thundering over to the Dursleys, who had just arrived home.</p><p> </p><p>*****</p><p> </p><p>Harry wasn’t sure what was going on.</p><p>The nice cat lady across the street was watching him because it was Dudley’s birthday, but she seemed to be afraid of him. He knew he scared people, like the Dursleys, and when people got scared, they got violent, so he tried to be smaller, never uttering a peep. It didn’t seem to make her feel better, as she kept glancing out the window, much like his aunt.</p><p>Then the old man came.</p><p>Harry immediately didn’t like him. He was okay with the Dursleys because he knew exactly how far they would take the abuse. He was okay with Mrs. Figg because she had cats, and no one with pets could be mean, and she wasn’t that scary anyway.</p><p>He was not okay with this new man.</p><p>He radiated anger and power and scared the little boy senseless.</p><p>And now he was being told to go with the man. What was he supposed to do?</p><p>The young boy glanced at the bag in the man’s hand and let out the first noise he had uttered since arriving at the cat lady’s house.</p><p>He let out a quiet sob.</p><p>Because there, in the bag the man held hostage, was his blanket, his little, blue blanket with his name stitched into a corner. His aunt told him it was the blanket they had found him on the porch in, and she refused to wash it or even touch it. She almost seemed scared of his blanket.</p><p>Now this strange man had his blanket. He’d never get it back; he’s sure of that. The only reason the Dursleys let him keep it was because they were afraid of it.</p><p>With reluctance, the boy took the offered hand, vowing to get his blanket back at all costs, before the hand gave a slight tug, and the boy was sucked through a straw.</p><p>When he could breathe again, the boy fell to the ground, his stomach hurting.</p><p>“Are you alright, Harry?” the man asked him.</p><p>Harry nodded, standing up. Aunt Petunia was never happy if he couldn’t get up. He didn’t want this man to be unhappy with him. He was older than Aunt Petunia, but he was much scarier.</p><p>Nodding, the man led him further into the room they had landed in. Now that his stomach had settled, the curious boy looked around, noting all the odd trinkets and books on the shelves. Fearful of being reprimanded for looking, he quickly glanced at the man who had somehow brought him to this new place, and his fears were confirmed when he saw the man was frowning at him. Hoping to avoid a beating by the new man, Harry quickly looked at the floor, trying desperately not to cry.</p><p> </p><p>*****</p><p> </p><p>Dumbledore had no clue what to do.</p><p>Yes, he was a headmaster of a school for children, and yes, most people said he was very good with kids.</p><p>However, he’s not entirely positive he’s even laid eyes on a child below the age of seven in the past decade. He was a little out of practice where smaller children were concerned. He needed to find another relative of the boy. He glanced down frowning in thought at the small child. Perhaps sensing he was being observed in his gazing, the boy glanced up at him before quickly turning to stare at the floor.</p><p>Merlin, this was going to be difficult.</p><p>He glanced down at the bag in his hands, all the boy’s meager possessions fitting nicely in a small canvas bag.</p><p>Dumbledore felt like cursing something, or rather, someone, namely the Dursley’s.</p><p>He pulled out the blanket and motioned for Harry to follow him. Noticing how the boy glanced back and forth between him and the blanket with worry, he realized the boy was afraid he would do something to his comfort item. Upon reaching the bedroom, he placed the blanket on the bed, the bag on the floor and turned to Harry, conjuring a small table with parchment and muggle crayons.</p><p>The boy gasped, staring between the conjured items and the man questioningly.</p><p>Dumbledore smiled, answering the questioning look with a simple answer of, “Magic,” before leaving the boy to his own devices while he found family to take the boy.</p><p> </p><p>*****</p><p> </p><p>Harry stared in fascination at the new table and coloring utensils the man had magicked into being. He sidestepped the table, skirting around it until he reached the bed. Snagging his blanket, the boy found a nice corner, and simply sat there, holding his blanket, waiting for the man to come back.</p><p> </p><p>*****</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>‘Ah ha! Iolanthe Peverell had a squib sister!’</em>
</p><p>Dumbledore was faithfully perusing the Potter family line, despite his hesitation to allow Harry to grow up in the wizarding world, as the Evans family line had dried up, ending only in Petunia. He refused to count her as an option any longer. He thought he had a decent lead with the Fleamont line, but the last Fleamont he could find had died of an illness along with her husband, leaving her son, Alphard Fleamont, to be lost in the muggle social services, and thus, difficult to find.</p><p>Now, however, he had a lead with the Peverell line, having gone back further, and was researching the branch of the family from Iolanthe’s sister. To his delight, he found one last living relative.</p><p>
  <em>‘Now, let’s go find Mr. Hughes.’</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>*****</p><p> </p><p>When Dumbledore began approaching his target’s office, he started flicking out the lights with his Deluminator. The plan was to intercept the man on his way home from his office, introduce him to Harry away from prying eyes, then hopefully leave Harry with much better caretakers.</p><p>The plan started falling apart when he noticed the man he was looking for being held at gunpoint in a phone booth.</p><p>When his attacker changed their appearance in a flash of red light, Dumbledore knew he needed to act <em>now</em>. He could hear a little of what was being said, and it was made obvious the man would have difficulty defending himself now. Setting down the Boy Who Lived and nudging Harry behind his robes, he pulled out his wand, firing a stunning spell at the attacker. Unfortunately, the attacker was back and firing that muggle weapon before the wizard could get to him, as Harry was starting to panic. He was worried the boy might run away while he was distracted. Quickly, he called Fawkes to him. He whispered a quiet spell at the boy, asking Fawkes to take the sleeping boy somewhere safe.</p><p>Now assured of Harry’s safety, the wizard began attacking the shape-shifter in earnest, careful of the wounded soldier nearby.</p><p> </p><p>*****</p><p> </p><p>“Hughes!”</p><p>To Roy’s horror, red liquid was trickling down his chin. Internal bleeding was difficult to fix quickly.</p><p>With a roar, flames exploded around the attacker, burning her to a crisp. Quickly, wand in his left hand, he ran to Hughes’ side, dropping to the ground in front of his comrade, followed quickly by his loyal lieutenant.</p><p>”<em>Vulnera Sanentur!” </em>the Colonel gasped, seeing the state of Hughes’ side and shoulder, quickly closing the wounds as best as he could. His healing magic was better with burns, for obvious reasons, but at least Maes’ life was no longer in danger.</p><p>At least that was what he thought until something speared him in the side.</p><p>Recovering from his shock, he followed the long, thin blade to see its origins were the fingers of the lady he had burnt to death.</p><p>
  <em>‘Wh-what?’</em>
</p><p>He snapped his fingers again and again, even as he continued his and Maes’ rudimentary first aid, while Hawkeye moved to help fight off the other assailant.</p><p>It was with extreme difficulty, but eventually, they managed to kill their adversaries. Exhausted and so very done with the day, Roy’s patience was having a tea party with his sanity somewhere on Mars.</p><p>“Who are you, and why are you here?” Roy asked, his wand trained on Dumbledore in his left hand, his right hand raised to snap.</p><p>Dumbledore ignored him until he was sure the hulk of dissolving flesh on the receiving end of his wand would not recover. Looking up, the man raised his wand loosely in the universal sign of, ‘I’m not going to attack you so please do the same.’</p><p>“My name is Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, and I’m here with an offer for Mr. Hughes, but that can wait for later. Is everyone alright?” His bright eyes flitted about between them.</p><p>“What kind of offer?” Roy asked, deftly stepping between the newcomer and his best friend, only stumbling slightly. Out of the corner of his eye, he could see Hawkeye tending to Hughes’ injuries.</p><p>He wasn’t expecting a phoenix to fly down gracefully, dropping a sleeping child in the stranger’s arms before alighting on his shoulder. He couldn’t help but stare.</p><p>“Sir, I suggest we take this elsewhere. Both you and the Lieutenant Colonel require medical attention.”</p><p>Roy glanced behind him to see Hawkeye holding up a clearly unconscious Hughes. Movement in front of him caused him to whip back around faster than advisable in his state. As the world spun a bit, his balance left to join his patience and sanity for their tea party on Mars. Leaning on the side of the phone booth to keep from falling, his wand fell from his shaking fingers. A hand on his side in pain, he realized the spur-of-the-moment, hasty first-aid he had performed for himself did not help as much as his adrenaline-filled body had led him to believe. His side was still bleeding profusely.</p><p>“Lieutenant, I…”</p><p>Roy never got to tell her he was about to pass out, because he was interrupted by the blackness that swallowed his vision and thoughts.</p>
