          <div class="userstuff"><p>Belen Petrakis didn't know what he was <em>thinking</em> trafficking a Cerberus. He'd trafficked everything from Teumessian Foxes to Stymphalian Birds. All these creatures were a snap compared to the Cerberus he was ordered to take to Britain. It was just a puppy, but it did more damage than a Manticore and had a bigger bite than a Chimera. It chewed on <em>everything,</em> and what it didn’t chew… he didn’t know that much pee could come out of any creature. He was going to smell of urine and dog shit for months.</p><p>The worst part, was when the buyer saw what she had ordered, she bought the Teumessian Fox instead. Now, he was stuck with this thing that hated him.</p><p>Belen decided to take one last stop in a village called Hogsmeade in Scotland.</p><p>He collapsed at a table in the Hog’s Head Inn and contemplated his life. Then, the largest man he’d ever seen strolled into the bar. He was so enormous; his head brushed the ceiling.</p><p>“Evenin’ Aberforth,” said Hagrid. “Jus’ me usual today.”</p><p>Aberforth grabbed a bottle the size of a small child from under the counter and popped the cork. Hagrid took the bottle which looked normal sized in his massive hand.</p><p>“Thank yeh,” he rumbled and took a seat just two tables away from Belen.</p><p>Belen eyed Hagrid as he gulped back a large swig of whatever was inside.</p><p>“What are you lookin’ at?” Hagrid asked.</p><p>“Nothing.”</p><p>“Well, since yeh seem ter be doin’ nothin’, hows about a game of Backgammon?”</p><p>“Don’t have much money,” Belen lied.</p><p>“Oh, now there must be somethin’ yeh could gamble.”</p><p>An idea popped into his head and he grinned.</p><p>“Well… I just so happen to have a Three-Headed Dog. He really is—”</p><p>“All righ’!” said Hagrid, eagerly digging into his pocket; he slapped his bet on the table. “Let’s play.”</p><p>Belen purposely threw the game, though Hagrid was rather good at it and probably would’ve lost anyway.</p><p>“HA!” Hagrid bellowed. “I WIN!”</p><p>“You win,” Belen agreed. “Just let me go get him.”</p><p>Belen ran upstairs and opened his trafficking case; he dragged the beast’s crate out. It snapped, growled, and snarled like usual.</p><p>“Skasmós!” Belen growled and rushed back downstairs.</p><p>“Here!” he said, breathlessly. “It’s yours.”</p><p>Hagrid lit up like a child on his birthday. He took the beast out of the cage and held him up like a baby.</p><p>“Hello!” he cooed (an odd sound to hear from a giant man). “I think I’ll call yeh… Fluffy!”</p><p>Belen stared incredulously as the Cerberus, now called ‘Fluffy’, barked, yapped, and drooled all over this man. Three tongues licked Hagrid’s face, making him giggle.</p><p>“He’s perfect. Yeh sure you’re all righ’ partin’ with ‘im?”</p><p>“Yep!” said Belen quickly. “You won him fair and square!”</p><p>After paying the barkeep, he rushed back upstairs and felt as if a weight was lifted off his shoulders. Thank, Zeus, God, and all the other gods and saints that <em>that</em> nightmare was over.</p></div>
