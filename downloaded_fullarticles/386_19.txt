  <em>Present day, June. </em>

  <strong><em>The most dangerous lies are the lies you tell yourself</em> </strong>
</p><p> </p><p>Ron’s chest rose and fell in an even rhythm next to Draco in bed. Clothes were scattered all over the soft, carpeted floor, leaving a telling trail of what they had done. Ron’s Auror’s robes were tossed in one corner, his dirty dragon skin boots in another. Then followed trousers, socks, belts, boxers, shirts… before it all ended by the feet of the bed. They were both stark naked; Draco’s body ached from having Ron’s hands on him earlier, gripping and groping every inch he could find. The hour was late and the stillness in his dim bedroom should have been soothing. It wasn’t. Draco couldn’t relax, couldn’t give in to the tiredness currently residing in his body. He turned to his right and watched Ron’s peaceful, sleeping face, eyes raking over freckles, lines and wrinkles in the pale skin. He paid attention to every little detail, noticing how Ron had more freckles on his nose than anywhere else. They seemed to gather on the tip, fighting for space, then going across the nose in both directions, continuing down his cheeks. The blush from the sex they’d had was still visible there even though it had been thirty minutes, at least, since it ended. Then were the lines. The wrinkles. Some were from laughter, some from time.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>They had a year left until they turned thirty, yet Ron seemed to have aged a lot the last three years. He looked older than twenty-nine. Draco noticed the dark, purplish circles under his eyes.</p><p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Sleep deprivation.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>
  <em>Stress.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Draco wanted to reach out and touch. Ron’s red lips were still slightly swollen from kissing, the bottom lip chapped. He had a tiny cut in the right corner of his mouth. His eyelids were lilac. His red hair was tousled, fringe stuck to one coppery brow. Something twitched inside Draco when he looked at him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Which was ridiculous.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>He refrained from touching.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>
  <em>He’s not really yours.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em>
</p><p> </p><p>Weasley may come here on the regular, but fucking Granger was the one he’d married. Draco absolutely despised her. He had always despised that woman, but now he loathed her more than ever. He loathed her all the way down to the wedding band on Ron’s left ring finger. Draco always tried to avoid looking at it and pretend Weasley’s wife and children didn’t exist. In his bedroom with the expensive dark interior or in the rest of his large flat, they didn’t.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>It was supposed to have been just sex. Draco knew what he was getting into when they got involved with each other.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>For a while, it was okay too. It was good. Then Draco realised he was in hell. Especially when he saw Ron smile. When he saw him laugh. When he felt him. When he took his breath away. When they breathed the same air just an inch from each other…<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Stop it. He’s not really yours.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em>
</p><p> </p><p>As he watched Ron sigh in his sleep and he moved a little, Draco decided he had enough. He turned in the bed so his back was facing Ron. It took a few seconds, which seemed like a lifetime, until Ron’s arm unexpectedly curled around Draco’s waist and Draco felt the warmness of Ron’s body against his own. It comforted him more than he would have liked to admit. Ron snuggled up close and buried his face in the nape of Draco’s neck. The coppery stubble on his chin was itching him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“I know you stare at me,” Ron whispered tiredly. “Go the fuck to sleep.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Shouldn’t you be going?” Draco hated how his voice sounded at the question. It sounded… <em>whiny. </em>But it was getting close to midnight. The clock on the wall opposite the bed quietly ticked closer and closer to a new day. Ron never stayed. He was usually always in a hurry.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>
  <em>In a hurry to get home to her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em>
</p><p> </p><p>“What, thought you wanted me here.” Draco felt exasperated at the slightly amused tone in Ron’s voice. In fact, he could almost feel him smile.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“You never stay.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Ron sighed and started placing kisses along Draco’s white skin.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Thought I’d stay tonight…” he said in the low voice that always made Draco weak and trembling. “It’s your birthday…”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Yes, Weasley. State the obvious.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em>
</p><p> </p><p>Draco turned to lie on his back. When he did so, Ron seized his chance to climb on top of him. Their bodies pressed together, chest against chest, belly against belly, groin against groin… Draco could feel everything. Ron had too long toe nails, which was hurting him a little. Overall though, Ron was enjoyably heavy, despite the difficulty Draco had to breathe with his weight on him. In the not-quite-darkness of his bedroom, he could see Ron smile slightly when their eyes locked into each other’s.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Ron’s eyes were so fucking blue. Draco didn’t need light to know that they were. They were like the ocean, or the sky on a happy, lazy summer’s day when not a cloud was in sight. Draco caught himself wanting to drown in them. Something danced in them when Ron was happy and they always darkened when he was angry or sad.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>When they were children growing up to learn to hate each other, Draco always hated Ron’s eyes. Of course, back then, he hated everything about the red-haired boy in the hand-me-down-clothes, who grew up in the countryside and lacked both table manners and money. He had always found excuses to hate Weasley. He had too many freckles. He couldn’t play Quidditch. He was a Muggle-infatuated blood traitor. Probably a little in love with Potter, too.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>If somebody told Draco when they were both in school together that he on his twenty-ninth birthday would lie like this in bed with Weasley on top of him, who was smiling and kissing his nose, Draco would probably hexed them. But here he was now in exactly that position, letting himself be kissed by the same red-haired boy, now grown into a man. It was a strange thing, how it all had turned out.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Hope it’s okay…” Ron continued in the same hushed voice, “Need to go early tomorrow morning though…” He sleepily captured Draco’s lips in another warm, lazy kiss and rolled his hips a little, which sent waves of want through Draco’s body despite him feeling both knackered and spent. Draco buried his fingers in Ron’s red curls, marvelling over how soft his hair always was. He watched Weasley’s eyes slip shut as they continued to kiss, the air sticky and warm in the tiny space between them. Draco’s hands moved over the redhead’s back, across the surprisingly soft skin and he wondered to himself how many freckles he had there. Ron angled his head to the side, to get into a better position for kissing, and Draco’s mind drifted away from the freckles on Ron’s pale skin, to tiny freckled faces and ginger hair. A pair of blue eyes much like Ron’s. Another set of brown, similar to Granger’s. Ron was the father of two children. His daughter was two years and his son nine months old.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>
  <em>You didn’t just have your second kid, Weasley. You’re lying.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em>
</p><p> </p><p>Suddenly Draco felt disgusted.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Weasley, get off me.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Surprised, Ron moved. He remained close however, sharing pillow with Draco. With his weight not on top of him anymore, Draco felt like a piece was missing. He didn’t feel whole.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>He hated himself for it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>
  <em>You’re not supposed to have those kinds of feelings.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t they miss you?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Draco never spoke their names. Ron didn’t either. Under Draco’s roof, names were reduced to <em>her </em>and <em>them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em></p><p>“There’s a workshop I have to be at tomorrow,” Ron said. “For my job. I’m supposed to be at the hotel right now, but I decided… I wanted to come here instead. Be with you.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“What if Potter tells her that you’re not there? If she goes looking for you?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“She won’t.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Ron never talked much whenever Draco brought this up. He avoided the subject as much as he could and if Draco said or asked anything, he always kept his answers short. Or, he closed up like a clam. Got angry.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>They lay together in silence. After a few minutes, Draco felt Ron snuggle closer again, burying his long nose in the crook of Draco’s neck.</p><p>“Tired…” Ron breathed. “Long day… Shit day.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“You should go back to sleep then.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Draco felt Ron nod, his hair tickled as he did so. Ron’s hair smelt faintly of burning timbers. Draco didn’t ask why. He simply lay still in the dark, feeling the other man relax once again, against him. He started snoring a little, but Draco didn’t push him away. He gazed up to the ceiling, body tense while restless thoughts ran through his mind.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Three years.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Draco didn’t know how much more he could take.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p align="center">

  <em>Three years earlier, October<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <strong> <em>The worst kind of sad is not being able to explain why.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em> </strong>
</p><p> </p><p>“Go to sleep… Please, why the <em>fuck </em>won’t you go to sleep? Just fucking sleep!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The ginger-haired baby in Ron’s arms had been crying for three solid hours. She was red-faced and angry, no matter what Ron did, his daughter wouldn’t calm down. Her loud screaming was hurting his ears, his arms ached from carrying her around and his eyes were red-rimmed from the crying he’d done on his own.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“WHAT AM I DOING WRONG?!” He shouted helplessly at her to which the baby responded with more crying.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Rose was two months old and Ron was certain she hated him. She always cried whenever he handled her, always content in her mother’s arms. It made Ron insecure and angry, he was scared of her, not knowing what she fucking wanted. Why didn’t babies come with a bloody manual?!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Mummy isn’t here you little shit! You’ll have to deal with me!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Ron yelled louder. The child got quiet, momentarily startled, before she broke out in high-pitched cries again.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>A pang of guilt hit his chest hard like a Bludger.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Shh…” he whispered into her baby-scented red locks. “I’m sorry for yelling. <em>Sweetheart…”</em> The murmured words were drowned by the child’s screams.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>There was no use.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Ron felt utterly defeated as he surrendered, summoning his Patronus.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>
  <em>I can’t do this.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em>
</p><p> </p><p>It took twenty minutes, but when Ginny finally showed up, Ron wanted to throw his arms around her. He had never been more relieved seeing his little sister. However, he was still carrying Rose who screamed frantically, so all he managed when Ginny showed her face was looking something between terrified, desperate and gratified.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Ron, what the hell?” Ginny frowned on the threshold of the sitting room, eyes going from Ron, the baby and the mess the room currently was in. Things were scattered everywhere: bottles, wipes, blankets, nappies… The table was turned over too.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Ginny, please,” Ron breathed from the far end of the long room. He stood by the window, knees wobbling, almost collapsing. He was dead on his feet. “I can’t do this, I need help. She needs a woman. I think.”</p><p>
  <em>She needs her mum. She fucking needs her mum.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em>
</p><p>He didn’t want to say that Rose hated him. She <em>must </em>hate him anyway. There was no other explanation.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Ginny was in front of him in a flash, grabbing baby Rose from him and holding her tightly over her shoulder. She placed a delicate hand on the back of the baby’s head to support her, the other on the tiny bottom.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Shhh… It’s okay, darling, auntie’s here now…Ron, where’s her dummy?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“I don’t know!” Ron whispered in panic. His hair was standing in all directions and he was dizzy.</p><p>Ginny shook her head and sighed. Rose was still crying. She stroked her back, whispered soothingly to her while walking across the sitting room, eyes scanning for the dummy she had requested. She found it lying underneath a grey cushion in the sofa. Ginny picked it up and stuck it into the small child’s mouth. Rose took it and began sucking.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“How long has she been crying?” Ginny asked when Rose had quieted enough for them to have a conversation in a normal tone.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Couple of hours… She wants her mum.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>
  <em>She always fucking does.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em>
</p><p>“So where’s Hermione, then?” Ginny looked at him, worried, her brown eyes large. Ron knew that she knew but asked anyway. This wasn’t the first time.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>He shook his head. Ginny opened her mouth to say something but right then Rose started crying again, having momentarily been calmed down by the pacifier.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Have you fed her? Do you have any bottles in the fridge? I think she might be hungry…”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>A half hour later, Rose was fed and slept soundlessly in Ginny’s arms. They were still in the sitting room. Ron had left them alone and was out on the balcony, sitting on the cold concrete floor and smoking what he believed was the third cigarette of the evening. He felt nauseated, given he couldn’t remember when he last ate and his head throbbed. He trembled; it was bloody cold out. He shouldn’t be sitting out here without a coat or cloak or something to warm him. He didn’t have his wand to cast a heating charm either.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>As if she could read his mind, Ginny soon appeared by the glass door. She had a blanket in her hands and he shot her a weak, grateful smile.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“I put Rose down in the cot,” she informed him when she stepped out, sitting down next to him and pulled the blanket around them both. Then she frowned when she saw what he was holding. “Since when are you a smoker?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“I’m not,” Ron said quickly, stubbing the cigarette out against the balcony rail. Then he tossed it over the edge before turning to her. “Thank you, by the way. Dunno what I’d do without you. Rose would still be crying, that’s for sure.” He stared blankly into the October night. No stars in the sky. Ginny squeezed his arm.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“This needs to stop. I can’t keep coming over, Ron just cause you can’t handle your own child. And you need to either sort things out with Hermione or get a divorce. Where is she?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“The fuck should I know.” He put his face in his hands. He could feel the familiar burn behind his eyelids and knew he wasn’t far from starting to cry.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>
  <em>You can’t cry in front of your sister.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em>
</p><p> </p><p>Ron didn’t know what to tell Ginny that she didn’t already know. They had been over this before. It was always the same: Hermione and Ron had a fight, she stormed off for hours at the time and he never knew where she was, he was left with a baby who screamed her head off at the mere sight of him and he struggled for hours before finally giving in and sending a Patronus to his sister. It was good to have Ginny, she was female and babies seemed to have some sixth fucking sense towards women. That’s what it felt like at least.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Ginny leant her head against his shoulder. “It’ll be alright, you know. Maybe you should go to mum and dad’s for a few days?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“No, wouldn’t do any good,” Ron said, looking up. He pulled a face. He could already hear their mother’s voice in his mind. She would want to know what <em>he </em>had done wrong this time that had his wife in tears and their baby upset.</p><p>
  <em>Yeah, because it’s always my fucking fault. No matter what happens.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em>
</p><p> </p><p>Having a newborn should have been the happiest time in their lives. Rose was planned and wanted. They were twenty-six years old; it was about time they started a family. Ron had longed for her, or at least, that was what he had thought. When she was born, and they were in the hospital and the Mediwitch held her up to him, smiling and presenting the baby as his <em>daughter </em>and he saw the blue eyes and vivid red hair… He didn’t feel it. The instant joy. All colour had drained from his face during that moment and he had felt like he was going to faint.</p><p> </p><p>His first thought was that she was ugly. She looked like a wrinkly, reddish alien with a too large head. When he took her in his arms from the smiling Mediwitch, his daughter had felt like an unfamiliar weight that didn’t belong there.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p><em>’She looks like you…’ </em>Hermione had sighed happily from the bed in the hospital room. <em>’I’ve read somewhere babies look like their fathers at first so the fathers could bond with their children. Recognise them as theirs…’</em></p><p><em>’Am I this ugly?’</em> Ron had asked, shocked. Hermione had only laughed then and taken the baby from his arms. She thought he had been joking.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Hermione had looked so blissful holding their child. Like this was the moment she had been waiting for all her life. Ron had muttered something about wanting to get some air.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>He had stepped out from the room, closing the door carefully behind him. His pulse had been high and he had felt stressed out, not sure whether he wanted to run home and hide, puke or pass out. The Mediwitch that had been in their room holding up the baby to him, <em>his </em>baby, was in the corridor too.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p><em>’Am I supposed to feel like this?’</em> He’d blurted to her before he could stop himself.<em> ’Am I supposed to feel this… this…’<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em></p><p><em>’Scared?’ </em>She had offered with a small smile. <em>’It’s normal, Mr Weasley, I assure you. It’s terrifying becoming a parent. Everyone goes through that. But soon everything will fall into place, and you get to know your child.’<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em></p><p>He had nodded silently. But he must have looked like shit, because she walked up to him and put a hand on his shoulder as if providing some sort of comfort.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p><em>’Look, I know it must feel strange. I imagine it must be weird being a father. We women carry the children for nine months; we develop a relationship to them pretty early on while they are still tiny embryos. It’s different for men. But I know it will be all right, especially once you get home and get settled in a familiar environment. Hospitals are a bit weird.’ </em>She had winked<em>. ’I can give you some pamphlets on parenting if you’d like?’<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em></p><p>Ron had shaken his head. <em>’No, it’s okay. I, uh, I figure it out. Probably… Thanks though.’<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em></p><p><em>’Let me know if you need anything.’</em> She had said, squeezing his shoulder before letting go. Ron had gone out then, breathing in the faint late summer’s air. Rose had been born in the middle of the night in August. It was light out and he could hear the birds already chirping in the distance. A scent of flowers hung in the air too.</p><p>When he came back, his mother had been there, hovering over the hospital bed, cooing over her grandchild.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>
  <em>’Oh, look at that. She’s just beautiful. She looks just like Charlie did, when he was a baby…’<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em>
</p><p> </p><p>Ron had felt his whole world shatter at the words.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>
  <em>She looks just like Charlie.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em>
</p><p>
  <em>She looks just like Charlie.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>She looks just like Charlie.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>She isn’t mine.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em>
</p><p> </p><p>Not that Ron thought Hermione was sleeping with his brother. He knew she didn’t. Nonetheless, the words from his mother had stung. It was as though she had confirmed his inner worries and fears that he hadn’t known he had. Ron had been so confused inside the sanitised room, it had just felt so overwhelming. After several hours of constant waiting and trying to be there for Hermione while she was in pain, it was suddenly all over and he, they, had that alien-like stranger together and he was convinced it was something wrong with him now because he didn’t feel <em>it. </em>The love. The sheer joy. And then when his mother said that Rose looked like Charlie… It had been a little much. But just like always, he had forced himself to smile and pretend the words hadn’t gotten to him. Nobody had seen his pain then and Ron knew they wouldn’t understand either.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>He had tried telling himself back then too that it had only been a few hours and he would feel that happiness of becoming a dad soon, but it didn’t stop. Rose still felt like someone unknown when they got home, and now, two months in, that hadn’t changed. Everybody had congratulated him. Harry had clapped his back, grinned and said ’well done, mate. A daughter, that’s huge, Ron!’<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Yeah.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>
  <em>But why don’t I fucking feel it then?!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em>
</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t as though he hadn’t tried. Ron really had. He had pushed himself in making an effort to get to know her, because she was his daughter for Merlin’s sake. He had wanted her just as much as Hermione.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Rose did all the usual baby stuff: eating, crying, crapping herself. Puking. But while doing all that, Ron quickly noticed how attached Rose was to her mother. Rose cried almost immediately when Ron tried holding her, which didn’t improve the bond he was desperately trying to have with her. Whenever he brought this up with Hermione, she just impatiently brushed it away like it was nothing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>
  <em>’For heaven’s sake, Ron, I’ve carried her for nine months! Babies are more attached to their mothers in the beginning. I’m a living safety and food machine for her; I breastfeed, which provides both food and comfort, she’s used to my heartbeat… We’ve read about this in the baby books!’<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em>
</p><p> </p><p>Ron knew they had. Hermione had forced him to read with her, about the baby’s development in the womb week by week, all about babies development after they were born and he had come to every meeting with the Healer for Hermione’s pregnancy check-ups… Everything Hermione had wanted him to do, he had done. And now… Everyone kept telling him everything was so bloody normal all the time. Rose’s constant crying when Hermione wasn’t around was apparently just so. Normal.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Except she didn’t cry when others held her. When their families came over to see Ron and Hermione's child soon after they got home from the hospital, Rose seemed so content and happy in their arms. His mum had a good hand with children, considering she raised so many of them. It was no wonder Rose seemed so at peace when she held her. She didn’t say anything either when Bill held her and Percy, George, Ginny… Everyone. Eventually Charlie took her, rocking her like he had done nothing else than rocking babies in all his life. Their mother had sighed happily once she spotted that.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>’Oh, Charlie! You look perfect! When are you going to have children of your own, dear?’<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em>
</p><p>Charlie had only smirked before turning to Ron.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>
  <em>’Congrats, little brother. She’s the spitting image of you.’<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em>
</p><p><em>’Mum says she looks like you,’</em> Ron had answered without thinking, almost wincing at the sour tone his voice had held. It had felt childish, and he hadn’t meant for it to sound like that. He didn’t want to <em>feel </em>like that.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p><em>’Nah, mate,’</em> Charlie had said, grinning.<em> ’All you. She has your eyes.’</em></p><p>Then Charlie gave her to Ron. It took two seconds. Then she fucking cried again.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>
  <em>She hates me.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em>
</p><p> </p><p>With babies came sleep deprivation, Ron found. With sleep deprivation came irritation. Irritation led to fighting. Ron and Hermione had always been good at pushing each other’s buttons ever since they were kids. It was fine, most of the time. Or, it used to be. But ever since Rose came into their lives, their fighting was ten times more bad than it used to be.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Hermione expected so much of him. She wanted him to clean, cook, buy groceries, help with Rose… Ron tried his best doing everything, being there for her. She had squeezed out their baby, she needed rest. He was the other parent, it was self-explanatory he should be there and help out; Rose was as much his child as hers. He <em>wanted </em>to do everything right with every ounce of his being.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But it was as though nothing he did was good enough for her. She didn’t like the way he cleaned their flat. He missed vacuuming a spot. He didn’t put the spatula back in the proper place. He forgot to buy things in the shop. He didn’t buy the <em>right </em>things in the shop. It made him feel angry and like nothing he did mattered to her. She only saw faults and not his efforts. That he really fucking tried, so hard. She never said ’thank you’. Never showed that she was happy with anything he did. Never showed she cared about him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Maybe he was being a whiny git. But Ron wanted to hear he was wanted, loved and appreciated. He wasn’t asking much. A warm smile, a hug, something. Instead, all they did was fight. Ron couldn’t help but snarl back when Hermione complained. It didn’t take long for them to start arguing after that. Hermione stormed off on the days it was really bad.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Some days he did that too. Or he was chucked out.</p><p> </p><p>It was on one of those days he had walked into a random, small pub to drown his feelings of hurt and inadequacy with Firewhisky. Little did he know that it would lead to him having his life even more screwed up than it already was.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">

  <em>Present day, June</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Draco didn’t know when he finally fell asleep. All he knew, as he bleary-eyed lifted his head from the pillow, was that Weasley stood before him putting on his dishevelled clothes back on his thin body. He could see his ribs stick out beneath the pale skin. Ron was so thin despite devouring food like no one else Draco had ever seen. Come to think of it, he seemed thinner than usual.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Hey.” Ron’s face lit up once he noticed Draco was awake. He finished buttoning his creasy shirt before shuffling over to kiss him on the lips. “Slept well?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Draco didn’t answer. The clock on the wall in front of him told it was six am. On a Saturday. He blinked, then groaned, letting his head fall back onto the soft pillow.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“It’s too early to wake up.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Yeah, I know,” Ron muttered, sitting down beside him. “I need to go. The workshop thing I told you about.” He bent down to put on his socks. Draco watched his back from his lying position. Even with the shirt on he could see his spine through the thin material. He had seen Ron naked last night. Hell, he’d seen Ron naked a lot fairly often these days. He knew he was thin.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>
  <em>I just never realised how thin.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em>
</p><p> </p><p>Had he always been that?</p><p> </p><p>“Weasley, you do eat well, right?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Ron looked up from what he was doing, slightly bewildered. “Yeah, why?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“You look a bit… underfed, that’s all.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Ron was quiet for a moment, looking at him strangely. Then his face suddenly broke out in a wide grin and he actually started to laugh.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“You need your eyes checked, Malfoy.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Draco scowled and sat up properly. “I’m serious,” he said, looking Ron in the eye. “You’ve lost weight.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Probably work. Been a lot to do lately.” Ron shrugged, his expression turning serious. “Besides…” he added, stopping what he was doing to kiss Draco’s cheek, “I love you and all, but we don’t really have that kind of relationship where we worry about each other like that, do we?” He chewed his lip. “I mean… we don’t really have a relationship.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>
  <em>So what is this then? What am I to you?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em>
</p><p>
  <em>You said you loved me. Twice now.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Draco wanted to scream at him. Weasley seemed to have forgotten what subject they had briefly touched just last night. He knew there was no use reminding him. Not now.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Ron said things sometimes, then acted like nothing had happened.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>
  <em>I want you to leave her and be with me.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em>
</p><p>
  <em>Cause Salazar knows, I do love you.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em>
</p><p>
  <em>I really, really, really fucking love you.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em>
</p><p>
  <em>You selfish bastard.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em>
</p><p> </p><p>The words always seemed to get caught in his throat whenever he wanted to express them. He couldn’t say the three words back. He brushed away the wild, flaming red hair from Ron’s brow instead with gentle fingers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Draco desperately wanted to freeze time so Ron could never leave.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>
