    <p>The storm brewed wildly, lightning lighting up the dark sky before the blackness enveloped the earth once more. </p><p>An otherworldly roar echoed across the sky, followed by screams from various people who attempted to flee from the mysterious creature which started attacking their homes. No matter how hard and recklessly they fought back, the creature was invincible against their swift moves and killed them in a millisecond. </p><p>One couple was one step ahead of their people. </p><p>A mother held on to her wailing child as her lover fought off the raging beast. The black creature roared and slashed at the man again. </p><p>“Take our daughter! Run away! Go!” The man shouted to his wife. </p><p>The woman hesitated, not wanting to leave him with that animal. But he wanted her to flee, to keep their daughter safe. </p><p>She quickly ran to the side and started for the safest place she could find for the child. The infant continued to wail and flay her arms around, and her mother soothed her to keep her quiet as she ran. </p><p>Coming across a tent, the woman searched for a place to hide the child until her eyes landed on a hole. Determination filling within her, the woman rushed towards the hole and placed the child in there. She then took a handwoven basket and a few blankets on her side. </p><p>She stopped when she heard her daughter wail quietly from the chaos outside. Looking around, the woman shushed softly to the child and took her small hands. </p><p>The infant whimpered and reached up to her mother with her hands. The woman kissed her on the forehead and stared into her eyes one last time. She placed the basket and blankets over the baby girl, doing checks to make sure they are secure. </p><p>When she did, she rushed back outside, only to find the houses of her people in complete destruction and her beloved gone. The creature now stood over the lifeless body of her lover and turned around to face her with its teeth stained with blood. </p><p>The woman glowered at the creature and started off in another direction. </p><p>As she expected, the monster snarled hungrily and followed after her. She sped across the forest, leading that thing away from her already despaired village, away from her daughter. As she expected, the creature gained on her, its footsteps pounding in the damp dirt from the storm. </p><p>She stopped at a clear area in the woods, just as the creature caught up with her. When she turned around, she faced it again, more brave and daring than she had been before. </p><p>The monster snarled, baring its teeth underneath the now appearing moonlight. </p><p>“Come on! Come on and get me!” The woman yelled at the top of her lungs. </p><p>The monster instantly leaped at her and opened its jaws wide for the kill. </p><p>Her screams resonated across the forest, for only a moment before they stopped. Silence once again filled the atmosphere, apart from a few birds chattering across the sky. </p><p>*****</p><p>In a hidden valley, different realms, the variety of cities, nestled behind the mountains of the island. The storm had passed over the cities, leaving behind only muddy paths and droplets of water to flow away from the leaves. At that moment, the streets were empty, lights out for the evening, not one person awake and disturbed. </p><p>All except one. </p><p>He sat up in a flash on his bed when he heard something. Something very faint...</p><p>A cry. A wail belonging to a youngling. </p><p>But he must be imagining things, could he? That’s impossible...</p><p>He was about to lay down again, only for the cry to reappear. </p><p>There’s something calling for him to find them. </p><p>And there’s no way he’s going to ignore it.</p>
