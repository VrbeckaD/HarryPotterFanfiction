    <p>Sirius woke with a pounding headache and an ache all over. The main place that hurt was his arm. It burned. It felt like someone had bitten his flesh off. He barely even had enough energy to open his eyes, but as his mind came closer to being conscious, he began to recognize that people were talking. “..ed an alternative?”</p><p>“No! I’m just saying it wasn’t smart! Especially with the developments that Dumbledore is planning on making in the plan. Look at the dude’s arm! There is a huge chunk out of it. That’s where most people have their tattoos, especially when they're in a gang."</p><p>“Okay. Well, next time someone comes to your doorstep at 2 in the morning, half-conscious and barely making any sense you just shut the door in their face.”</p><p>“That’s not what I’m saying. I’m saying are you sure you should be letting him stay?” Sirius slowly opened his eyes and glanced around. He was laying down on a leather couch in a living room. There were two black leather chairs across him, and in between there was a glass table. The dark oaked floor had a white rug under the table and the walls were painted a creamy sort of white. All the extra furniture was a deep brown or black. In the corner, there sat an ordinary chair with a sheet of paper above it that read "Teddy's Timeout Space." And behind that was a set of stairs going to the upper level.</p><p>There were two men about his age in his line of sight, and there was another person that he could feel standing behind him. </p><p>“Why wouldn’t I be? If he’s in that state, what else could I have done?” The tall one snapped. He had scars that were wrapped around his arms and wound up into his shirt sleeve. He had a particular scar that ran from his right eyebrow down to the left corner of his mouth, crossing over his nose. His eyes were a gorgeous shade of amber. His arms had several tattoos that seemed to merge together. He couldn't tell what they were at this distance.</p><p>“Oh, I don’t know, an ambulance?” The other replied, rolling his eyes. He was only slightly smaller. He had jet black hair and deep brown eyes, a pair of glasses and broad shoulders. He had only two visible tattoos, one on his forearm and one on his bicep. Also too far away to tell.“The only reason you didn’t was that you find him hot and interesting.”</p><p>“Shut up.”</p><p>“Boys, stop fighting. This is ridiculous. Remus has already tended to him, when he wakes up, we’ll just send him on his way.” A feminine voice said from behind him. The two men turned to her. </p><p>“Babe-”</p><p>“Wait.” Remus said, cutting him off, meeting Sirius’s eyes. Sirius watched as a woman with fiery red hair came into his line of sight. She had emerald green eyes and freckles that dusted over her nose and onto her cheekbones. She was unmarked other than the word "Prongs" on her left wrist. Suddenly, all eyes were on him. </p><p>Sirius had to fight down the bit of panic that raced through his mind. His mind was used to bad things happening when all the attention was on him. Sirius tried his best to keep his eyes open and not let himself fall back into unconsciousness.”Well, are you going to say something or keep staring at him all weirdly?” The woman asked. Then, she sat down on the floor with her legs crossed. “Do you remember what happened?” She asked, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear. Sirius tried to sit up but found it difficult, his head whirled at the amount of energy for the motion.</p><p>She gently put a hand on his shoulder, trying to gently lay him back down, but Sirius flinched and she quickly removed it. “Can you understand me? Parlez vous Anglais?” </p><p>“Yeah,” Sirius said, his voice hoarse. “Yeah, I can. And I do.”</p><p>“What’s your name?” The tall one asked immediately.</p><p>“Remus, be kind.” The woman scolded.</p><p>“Sirius.” He answered.</p><p>“Yes, I’m serious.”</p><p>“No. That’s my name.” </p><p>“Your name is Sirius?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Sirius?” The one with the jet black hair said, a huge grin on his face.</p><p>“Now’s not the time for a pun, James.” Remus sighed. “How did you get here?”</p><p>“I walked, obviously.” </p><p>“Okay, why are you here though?” James asked.</p><p>“I guess I just chose to pass out here? Fuck if I know. You were the only house I had seen in five minutes and I wasn’t about to let myself bleed out on the road.” Slowly, his voice grew more and more normal. He began to sit up again, but his head spun just the same. The woman reached over slowly and helped set him up properly, keeping her hands very steady and visible.  “Sorry.” He whispered.</p><p>“It’s fine.” She whispered back.</p><p>“You don’t have asthma do you?” Remus asked bluntly.</p><p>“No? Why?” </p><p>“Good.” He took out a carton of cigarettes and opened it, handing one to James. </p><p>“Hey, not here this is a rental. Also, Teddy’s here.”</p><p>“Ah, shite.” Remus grumbled, shoving it back in his pocket. Did they have a kid? </p><p>“Teddy?” Sirius asked.</p><p>“My kid. He’s about five.” Why did that name sound familiar?</p><p>“Oh. Well. I better be going. Places to go. People to meet. Thanks for letting me bleed on your couch.” Sirius said, beginning to stand up. The only problem with that was as soon as he did so, his vision blurred and a shooting pain ran up his foot all the way to his hip. The room darkened and he had to use the couch’s arm for support to remain standing. </p><p>“Sirius, honey, sit down.” The woman said, gently pushing him onto the couch. He gave no protest and let himself fall back into the couch cushion. “We need to take him to a hosp-”</p><p>“No.” Sirius said before she could even finish the statement. He said it so boldly that he could see it took her by surprise. Everyone looked at him again. Remus sent him an analyzing look.</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“I… I can’t.”</p><p>“Why <em> not </em>?” Remus pressed harder. Sirius glanced at his arm. There was no way he could tell these new people that he had just gotten out of the grips of the Death Eaters. “Who are you hiding from?”</p><p>“I… I can't tell you…”</p><p>“<em> Why </em>?” Remus kept pressing. </p><p>"Remus, give the guy a break," James said, glancing nervously at Sirius who was currently burying his head in his hand.</p><p>"Lily, James can you go check in on Teddy?"</p><p>"Re-" Lily started to say, but after he gave her a look, she sighed and squeezed Sirius's shoulder. </p><p>Sirius would be nervous to be alone in a room with the Head of the D.A., but apparently there was a kid upstairs, and based on all the things he's heard about the D.A., they would never let a kid go through what his parents put him through. </p><p>Sirius's earliest memory was of him standing in a crib, crying. He heard screams and yells echo off the walls and slip under through the crack between the door and the floor. He remembered the way the door was thrown open before quickly being slammed shut. The way Andromeda came right up and picked Sirius up, telling him he had to stop crying. Telling him over and over "shhhh, the televisions just too loud. Shhh, don't let your mama come up here." </p><p>The burden of having a photographic memory was the fact that he could still see her panicked, scared, and broken face. Her mournful eyes. To this day he still wondered exactly what it she saw down there.</p><p>She was only ten years old. </p><p>"Sirius?" Remus asked, a look of concern in his eyes. He was sitting in front of him, his chair turned backwards and his arms crossed on top of the back of the seat. Up close, he could see his eyes had little gold flecks in them with a light greenish-brown rim. His eyes looked almost like honey. The tattoos on his arms were of flowers, a wolf, the sky, the moon, the woods, and a quote here and there. </p><p>"Hm?"</p><p>"You okay, mate?"</p><p>"'Course, why?" </p><p>"I've only said your name three times." </p><p>"Oh. Sorry,"  that was one thing Sirius had to get better at, not spacing out and getting lost in his thoughts. It was his survival mechanism back home, but out here that wouldn't work here. "Sorry."</p><p>"So, Sirius. Got a last name?"</p><p>"'Course I do, what kinda question is that?"</p><p>"What is it?" Sirius remained silent. "Who are you running from?"</p><p>"Bad people." </p><p>"How bad?" </p><p>"Bad enough to where I should probably get going soon." Remus nodded. </p><p>"We'll move in the morning, then." </p><p>"How are you so calm about this? Why are you letting me stay?"</p><p>"You have no wire, no phone, no way to communicate. Your alone, can barely stand, and have the look."</p><p>"What look."</p><p>"A look only others who have it will see it. I guarantee you see it in me too." Remus stood up and shoved the chair back against the wall. "If you need anything, ask for Lily. I'll be occupied." Remus turned the corner and started climbing up the steps two at a time. "Get rest, maybe you'll be able to move by yourself in the morning."</p><p>"Wait!" Sirius called. </p><p>"Yes?" Remus said, slightly annoyed. </p><p>"How long have I been out? What's today? And what time is it?"</p><p>"You've only been out about 20 hours. It's nearly 10.30 now. Oh and don't play my games." With that, he disappeared. <em> Games? </em>Sirius thought, looking around. Then he caught a little beam of light reflected off a big black surface, which he mistook for part of the cupboard. Under was about 10 games and two controllers. He couldn't tell what system from this distance, but he didn't care. </p><p>Sirius shook his head lightly and carefully laid back down, curling up into a half-protective ball and letting himself slip back into unconsciousness. Maybe when he woke up it wouldn't feel as if a nail was being hammered into his brain.</p>
