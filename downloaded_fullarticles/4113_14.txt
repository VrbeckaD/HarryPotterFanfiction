<p>Chapter 1</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Another stop Hermione? Really?!”</p>
<p>Her eyes glance upwards at Ron, already lugging away his cart and passing Harry beside the Hogwarts Express sign. Harry trots a bit slower, as if trying to wait for her, but her situation isn’t helping at all. Her parchment case had opened again. Well actually, it had broken again and the writing filled loose papers were threatening to spill out. She's left to maneuver everything rather uncomfortably with her elbow to close the case, as her hands are already full of oversized textbooks.    </p>
<p>“I could get a step up with some help,” Hermione muttered, to no one in particular. Wishing she‘d grow a third arm she hauls the case on top of her cart, and pressed the two parts close with her elbow against the cart’s handle. Her wand is tucked safely on her biggest suitcase. The train horned again, signaling it was close to departure. She stole a quick glance around. The place was filled with running students and nerve-wracked parents. Nobody was looking. She could steal a quick moment and make a non-verbal incantation without anybody noticing. </p>
<p>Nonverbal spells, albeit not illegal, weren’t regarded as a noble ability amongst the magic community, if you weren’t a very powerful and recognized wizard. They had been initiated by a group of Dark Wizards in the beginnings of the Wizarding World. Hermione had found a book by accident in the Library during her fifth year and the subject had interested her so much, she began to practice all the methods and had even managed to do simple charms during the first months until she became quite decent at it. She never did it in public, even though she found the whole stigma against them stupid and meaningless. Besides, it was an easy incantation and her arms were hurting. </p>
<p>“Accingatur vinculum”, she whispers and automatically feels the stretch of magic in her body. Even with such simple spells, using nonverbal incantations always gives her a thrill up her spine. Instantly, a small belt appears from between the two packages, entwining itself tightly around them. Her wand popped off from one of the edges of the carriage and slithered along to Hermione’s hand. </p>
<p>“Needs an alarm, this one, eh mate?” Ron murmurs to Harry when she finally caught up with them. They had already reached the line to the train and had saved her a spot.  </p>
<p>“I would have been faster if I had some proper help, thank you very much,” she says, a bit winded from the short sprint. </p>
<p> “We ain’t going to last you forever Hermione. You might as well start brewing a cloning tonic before you get lost and left in Hogsmeade.” Harry, in his very neutral 'I'm a friend of both of ya' don't drag me into this' keeps a smile on his face, amused at the usual bicker of the two while Ron kept on.</p>
<p>“If that were to happen, I’d clone three of me, thanks”, she says huffily. </p>
<p>“Not one of me, then?” asks Harry, mocking a frown at not being acknowledged for support. </p>
<p>“Not one of you, boy”, she replies, “given that Mr. Potter was also too busy to help.” She takes two quick steps ahead of them and boards. </p>
<p>“He’s just picking the right side, love.” interjected Ron. </p>
<p>She frowned at ‘love’ and was about to say something, but the welcoming guard, a tall, lanky old man with colored patches on his jacket directed them to their seats.  </p>
<p>~~</p>
<p>Sixth Year. </p>
<p>Hermione had assured her parents as best as she could of her safety after returning to the Wizarding World. She also tried the lessen as much as she could the gravity of the impending war and the fact that she was probably going to participate the most. ‘I’ll be all right. Our side is very strong. We will win.’ she had told them. Hasty words to a bleak outcome. Ecstatic smile, constant chatter about classes, N.E.W.T.s, and comprehensive lists about materials and books all helped in her in keeping distracted and an effort to maintain some resemblance of normality.</p>
<p>Ginny had asked for one too and she had happily obliged. The more work the merrier, she thought.</p>
<p>Hermione couldn’t manage to think through what might happen to them in the coming months. Especially Harry. In the months closest to the start of classes he had become quieter, more anxious. Any surface was there to tap, any opportunity taken to be in solitude. One night, while they were staying at the Weasley’s for a campfire, she went for him, pretty unimpressed at his weak excuse of going in to put some dishes in the washer. She had walked all over the cottage, peered into Ron’s room, and found him scribbling furiously on a black journal. Two hard knocks on the wooden door, and his pen went flying at his surprise. But he did show it to her, almost completely full with passages, lengthy descriptions of dangerous situations and strategies of possible battles and escapes depending on their location and volume of people.</p>
<p>“I want to be ready, Mione”, he had told her in a hushed voice. As if the Dark Eaters themselves were roaming in the hallway. “It’s not me. It’s not just me that’s at stake if this war starts. Everyone is involved. It’s Ron, and, and Ginny and the family and you and your family, and the Order-“</p>
<p>She tried to calm him down. Perplexed that he was realizing this at this point in time and unsettled that his words had also uncovered a small visage of naiveté on her part. Because there was no Order of the Phoenix, no spell, no power could ensure the safety of anyone of their friends and family, their acquaintances, their enemies. Not even the ghosts of those enemies. Her heart raced, disturbing her. Everyone is in danger, she had realized that night. But really, realized. She focused on her best friend. And tried to get him to explain his tactics illegibly scribbled on that notebook, while thinking at the same time how in the world they were going to destroy Voldemort. </p>
<p>~~</p>
<p>'Anything that was going to happen they couldn’t be more ready', Hermione thinks, taking out her Pithagorean Arithmancy book and scampering the memory away with the sways of the racing train. Because now, they are together. </p>
<p>“Frog tongue ‘Mione?” She swears she felt a drop of spit land in her collarbone as Ron offered her an eaten piece of green chocolate. Her eyes flicker from the melting chocolate in his fingers to his chewing cheek. “No, thanks”. Ron, who hadn’t gone off his joking mood, presses on. “You need to get some fat in ya, ‘Mione, for when were conquering the world.” Harry tenses slightly beside her but keeps looking for a packet of sweets.  Ron could be so dense at times. </p>
<p>“A wand doesn’t need to get fat, Ronald.” </p>
<p>“Yeah, but you’re arm does, with all that flicking and moving you’ll be doing.” He demonstrates his point by flailing his own arm all around himself.</p>
<p>“Say something, then”, Hermione says with exaggerating excited eyes, ‘Why don’t you go and give me some of yours- she reaches out and touches the lower side of his arm, squeezing the fat there firmly and tugging down. “Could spare some, don't ya' think?.” </p>
<p>He yelps and drops his chocolate. “Hermione I’m only teasing! Look what you’ve made me do.” Harry was laughing, albeit trying to hide it under his mouthful of sweets. </p>
<p>“He speaks”, She noted, taking the opportunity. “Or, he laughs.”</p>
<p>He smiles sheepishly at her, “Frog tongue?” </p>
<p>‘You too, huh’, She narrows her eyes at him, insistent on her subject. “Full, thanks... You’ve been quiet all morning Harry. It’s something the matter?”</p>
<p>He looks down again, pensive. “Is something the matter”, he whispers. Ron had given up on finding his candy tongue and sits again, looking at Harry. After a long minute, though, he smiled at them. “Just, you know, our last year and all.”</p>
<p>Ron chirped before Hermione could interject. “Yeah, it’s cruised by, hasn’t it? This last six?”</p>
<p>“Right past”, Harry says, looking at his hands again. </p>
<p>“You reckon the Headless Caddie will miss us, Harry? We sure gave him a few laughs.”</p>
<p>“Nah. He’ll probably find some other student to throw his head at.” </p>
<p>“What about –“ he lifts his legs on the front seat, grazing Hermione’s skirt with the edges of his shoes. </p>
<p>“Oi, Ron!”</p>
<p>“How about that moaning myrtle? She pretty fancied you for a bit, didn’t she? I’d warn you to stay away from the ladies toilettes this year Harry lest she cut up some of your hair and try to make her own Potter.”</p>
<p>Hermione rolls her eyes, giving up on talking about more serious matters. They should, she knows, but Harry's laughing again. Distracted for a moment from himself and what he usually thinks. She gives her friends a small smile and pitches in. </p>
<p>“Excuse me - interrupts the truck lady - would any of you like any snacks?”</p>
<p>Ron’s eyes lit up.</p>
