  <strong>He really had to jinx it, didn’t he.</strong>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s2">Everything was going well. Just a few hours ago, they had defeated Voldemort. Harry, Ron, and Hermione and were just taking about how tired they were, and how they just wanted to sleep in a real bed. But with his stupid, annoying luck, everything goes wrong.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s2">They were just helping to fix the castle. While the Hermione was attempting to teach her friends to cast </span>
  <span class="s3"><em>Tempus</em>, </span>
  <span class="s2">a spell to tell the time, something went horrible. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s2">“No Ron, your supposed to swish, flick, and </span>
  <em>
    <span class="s3">then </span>
  </em>
  <span class="s2">swish. Otherwise, it’s just </span>
  <em>
    <span class="s3">Wingardium Leviosa </span>
  </em>
  <span class="s2">all over again.” Said Hermione</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s2">“Hermione!!!” Ron complained, “That’s </span>
  <em>
    <span class="s3">exactly </span>
  </em>
  <span class="s2">what I’m doing!!! It just won’t work!!”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s2">“That’s because your British Ron!” Hermione explained, “You’re </span>
  <em>
    <span class="s3">supposed </span>
  </em>
  <span class="s2">do it with your </span>
  <em>
    <span class="s3">normal </span>
  </em>
  <span class="s2">accent! Not an American one!”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s2">“Well, it doesn’t matter!” Retorted Ron</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s2">“Does to!”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s2">“Does not!”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s2">“Does to!”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s2">“Does not!”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s2">After a little more bickering, Hermione leans in and kisses Ron, to shut him up.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s2">It definitely worked.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s2">Then it happened.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s2">While his two friends were arguing and snogging, Harry had attempted to cast </span>
  <span class="s3"><em>Tempus</em>.</span>
  <span class="s2">But something had gone wrong. Suddenly, lighting struck in the dark and gloomy sky. Then, the wind started howling. But it wasn’t a normal howl. It sounded like something different, with more meaning. Almost as if it could stop time itself.....</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s2">The three friends shared a terrified look, and then everything went black</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s2">Harry was trying to ignore the spiders in the cupboard, and get some sleep before Dudley’s birthday the next day. When we stared to fall asleep he heard thunder and the terrified screams of the Dursley’s. Then, everything went black</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s2">All over England, the same thing happened to witches, wizards, and their families.</span>
