</p><p>
  <em> My Darling Draco, </em>
</p><p>
  <em> It’s been one month since that bottom feeder has left and the villa is terribly lonely. Tell my favourite nephew I would love for him to spend the summer hols with me. He’s more than welcome to bring that precious girlfriend of his and the Potter boy. Please tell the Minister and her husband, and the Potters, to rest assured the children will all be in separate rooms and all activities will be chaperoned, and I won’t take no for an answer. I intend on spoiling my nephew rotten, and I know that his stubborn teenage self won’t go anywhere without his friends. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> XOXO, </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Daphne </em>
</p><p>
  <em> P.S. (Not for children’s eyes) </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Now my questions for you, my wonderful brother-in-law. How long have you known my husband was bent? Seriously? So cliche. He left me for a pool boy named Mauricio. It’s just tragic. I should have known. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Now you. PLEASE tell me you are done mourning my sister. It has been almost three years. Astoria will be shedding tears of pity from above if you’re not using your cock. Also, I better see your arse here to wish the children off. If you send them by Portkey, unchaperoned, I will hex you. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Kisses. </em>

  <em> Daphne, </em>
</p><p>
  <em> I miss your delusional nonsense. For your information, my resigned celibacy is suiting me just fine. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> I will tell the children about your invitation if you promise to come home after this summer and take over Meadow Hall, as it’s your sworn duty as the eldest Greengrass. I’m currently managing both estates, raising a child by myself, and busying myself with a research project for the DMLE as a consultant. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Also, your next letter better include a birthday gift. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Yours, </em>
</p><p>

</p><p>
  <em> Draco, </em>
</p><p>
  <em> You’re a damn liar and you know it. Additionally, Meadow Hall is so big and old and cold, and England is so...English. I’ve gotten used to my sun-kissed glow. You should try it some time.  I shall come back to hire someone to manage the estate and alleviate your burdens, Lord Malfoy. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Tell those children to come and enjoy summer on the Amalfi coast, and hopefully, we can get your skin to turn a slightly darker shade of pale. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Oh, and your gift is that we are still family. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Always, </em>
</p><p>

</p><p>
  <em> Daphne, </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Sounds like a cop out. We’ll talk more about your responsibilities in person. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> The Granger-Weasleys and Potters have allowed their children to stay with you. See you on 24 June. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> I still expect a birthday gift. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Yours, </em>

</p><p>
  <em> See you then. </em>
</p>
<hr/><p>With a loud popping noise, Draco and Scorpius Malfoy, Rose Granger-Weasley, and Albus Potter arrive in front of a modest, cliffside villa overlooking the sea.</p><p>“Quaint,” Draco said with mild amusement. “I remember it being bigger.”</p><p>“Dad…” Scorpius cast a judgmental, sideways glance at his father.</p><p>“It’s gorgeous,” Rose gasped. “Not over-the-top. It’s the perfect blend of charm and opulence. Not too big either.”</p><p>“What are you all talking about? You’re missing the best part—<em> sun </em>.” Albus dropped his bag, extended his arms and looked up to the sky soaking in the warmth. “Oh, fuck Scotland. I’m not going back. I swear to fucking God. I’m so sick of the Highland weather. I’ll stay here and worship this heavenly body.”</p><p>“Well, thank you,” a sultry voice came from the front door. A tall, svelte, middle-aged woman with medium length blonde waves, wearing a chic, cream-colored halter jumpsuit smiled at her guests. “Are you all going to enjoy the gardener’s work or are you going to come inside?”</p><p>While the two Malfoys ran up to greet their relative, Albus and Rose held back for a beat.</p><p>Albus leaned into his cousin and whispered suggestively, “Scorp’s Aunt Daphne sure is something else.”</p><p>“Shh, you perv,” she replied with a scoff. “She’s our host for the summer. Let’s get to know her a little bit before you reveal that your brain is a literal rubbish bin.”</p><p>“Rose. Al. Come here and say hi to Aunt Daphne,” Scorpius called them eagerly.</p><p>The cousins walked up the walkway to the large glass and wood doors.</p><p>“Hello Darlings,” she reached down and kissed them both on their cheeks. “My have you grown.”</p><p>Albus couldn’t tell if he had imagined it, but he swore her lips lingered on his cheek for a bit longer than the average greeting. Instead of letting himself get rattled by it, he replied, “That we have, Mrs. Zabini. You’re looking even more stunning than the last time I saw you.”</p><p>“Considering that was my sister’s funeral, I would hope so.” She gave him a wink.</p><p>Rose and Scorpius couldn’t help but look slightly mortified as they followed Daphne into the house. Draco, on the other hand, clapped his hand on Albus’s shoulder. “Alright, Albus. Don't you think she is out of your league?”</p><p>Albus shrugged, “Hey, I’m just reading the room.”</p><p>“You used to be such a sweet kid,” Draco snorted and mussed the boy’s hair. “What happened?”</p><p>“Come on, Draco,” he cast an air of familiarity that most teenagers don’t carry with adults. “I’m the spawn of Ginny and Harry Potter, and a Slytherin. I was destined to become an arsehole at some point or another.”</p><p>“Very true,” he smirked in response.</p><p>“Alright darlings, the house is much less formal than what you’re all used to.” Daphne knew that Rose and her family lived in the Minister’s Mansion, the Potters lived at 12 Grimmauld Place, and of course, the Malfoys resided at the Manor, all of which were designed for traditional entertainment. “On this floor, are the kitchens, dining, open living room, and grand balcony. Bedrooms are on the third floor. Lastly, the ground floor you’ll find the study, game room, swimming pool, and terrazza.”</p><p>Rose admired the mix of Mediterranean architecture mixed with modern accents. Daphne’s art collection was eclectic yet tasteful. It was evident that the Greengrass heiress was a student of the world and didn’t limit her tastes to wizarding standards. “Mrs. Zabini, your home is lovely. Thank you again for inviting us.” Rose couldn’t hide the fact she was in complete awe.</p><p>“No more of this ‘Mrs. Zabini’ talk. It’s Daphne. Just Daphne. But, if Scorpius plays his cards right, maybe one day you’ll also be calling me Aunt Daphne.” She gave the two teenagers a wink.</p><p>“Aunt Daphne!” Scorpius exclaimed in embarrassment.</p><p>She didn’t dignify her nephew with a response. Instead, she continued walking and lead them upstairs. “Why don’t you all change. We’ll have lunch outside, and you can jump into the pool afterward.”</p><p>The teens murmured with excitement. Draco leaned into his sister-in-law, “Are you trying to get all the cool adult points?”</p><p>“I don’t know what you’re talking about.” She flipped her hand dismissively. “Rose, this is your room.”</p><p>“Thank you, Mrs—I mean, Daphne.”</p><p>She smiled as the girl kissed Scorpius and disappeared behind the door.</p><p>“Scorpius, this is your room,” she pointed to the next room.</p><p>“Daphne…” Draco said pointedly. “Are those the rooms with the adjoining bathroom?”</p><p>“No different than the Heads dormitories,” she remarked devilishly. “And we both know they will be getting their letters any day now.”</p><p>Scorpius kissed his aunt’s cheek as his father stood in stunned silence. “You’re brilliant, Aunt Daph.” He gave his father a cheeky shrug of the eyebrows and walked into his room.</p><p>Daphne skipped a door, then gestured to Albus, “This one is yours. I figured you might want a little space from them.”</p><p>“Thank Merlin,” Albus sighed in relief. “They are so loud. Like a troll fucking a banshee.”</p><p>Draco raised his eyebrow in a questioning manner. “Do I want to know?”</p><p>Albus clapped his hand on Draco’s shoulder in the same condescending way the Slytherin alumnus had done to him earlier. “Draco, when a teenage boy likes a teenage girl, and they go to a boarding school with very little supervision, not to mention they blatantly abuse their authority as prefects...” The young man enjoyed watching the elder grow uncomfortable with the conversation, and continued, “well, they shag all over the school, and very loudly at that.”</p><p>Daphne snickered, “Sounds like two other prefects I knew.”</p><p>“Shut up, Daphne,” Draco interjected scornfully.  </p><p>“How is Pansy these days? Still trying to get back in your good graces?” she snickered wickedly.</p><p>Draco captured Daphne in his arms. She laughed and squirmed as Draco instructed, “Albus, go to your room and get ready for lunch. I need to talk to my sister-in-law.”</p><p>“Yeah, alright. I’m pretty hungry.” Albus replied nonchalantly as he walked into the room that would be his for the rest of summer.</p><p>After being shoved into the master suite by Draco, Daphne said, “Okay, I’m going to put on my swimsuit. Go to your room and change.”</p><p>“Don’t be such a prude. Just change in there,” He motioned to the expansive wardrobe.  “and I’ll change out here.”</p><p>Placing her hands on her hips disapprovingly. “Don’t you think I’ve dealt with enough hiding in closets?”</p><p>He laughed at the jab at her ex-husband. “Have you heard from Blaise?”</p><p>“Oh, just got the final papers.” Mirthfully, Daphne snickered as she entered her expansive wardrobe. It was easily the size of one of the guest bedrooms and held fine clothing by sought-after wizarding and Muggle designers. “I’m going to be loaded.”</p><p>“You’re already wealthy.” Draco opened his suitcase and found his swimsuit and a casual button-down to match.</p><p>Shimmying out of her jumpsuit, she hollered, “Oh, but now I don’t need to dip into Scorpius’s inheritance. I can bleed the Zabini family dry.”</p><p>“Fair enough,” he replied while tying the drawstring of his trunks.</p><p>Daphne paced through her wardrobe inspecting the various swimsuits and sighed. “I’ve missed you too, <em> Drakeypoo </em>.”</p><p>“If you call me that again, I will hex you, or at the very least, reveal some horribly embarrassing secret,” he sat on the edge of the bed waiting, rather impatiently. “You’re a terrible influence and you really shouldn’t let the kids in on our secrets. Can we have some semblance of maturity?”</p><p><em> “I’m </em> a terrible influence?” She scoffed. “I could easily list all the times you convinced me to do something ridiculous, like when you asked me to call my elf to bring us alcohol during the Yule Ball…”</p><p>“Are you dressed yet?” Draco huffed, annoyed to be reliving his teenage antics with one of his oldest friends.</p><p>“Done.”</p><p>Daphne comes out wearing the tiniest white bikini, heeled espadrilles, and a sheer robe with a vibrant, swirling print of blues, greens, and black. Draco just gives her a look. "You're wearing that?"</p><p>“Like it? It’s Pucci.” She runs her hands down her sides and gives him a wink, "I'm forty-four, never had children and look like this. I'm going to wear whatever the hell I want.”</p><p>Draco pinched the bridge of his nose, “You do know that there are teenage boys who will see you. Granted one of them is your nephew, but your boob could easily pop out, and that's all he'll see. Boob. Not 'my aunt's boob' but boob.”</p><p>She shrugged, “That’s what the cover-up is for.”</p><p>“And will you keep the cover-up on when you’re in the water?”</p><p>Daphne bit her lip with a telling grin.</p><p>He sighed and instructed, "Turn around. How bare is the backside?" She turns around and lifts the long chiffon fabric, and he feels a twinge in his gut. "Cover it up. You look too much like your sister from that angle. Let's not confuse my senses."</p><p>She patted him on the cheek, “You’re too funny. You know Astoria had the nicer bum, and I have the nicer legs. My goodness. You really do need to get laid.”</p><p>Draco groaned, “I do not need to get laid. Let’s just eat already. All your chatter is making me cranky.”</p><p>“Would you say...<em> frustrated </em>?”</p><p>“Oh, shut it.”</p>
<hr/><p>When they made their way down to the terrazza, the teenagers were already in the pool engaging in a splashing war.</p><p>“Scorpius, Albus, Rose,” Draco called. “Did you put on your sun repellant potion?”</p><p>Daphne gave him a sideways glance caught somewhere between disbelief and disgust. “You’re a right mother hen, aren’t you.” Draco’s eyes replied with a daggered stare which only brought a smile to her face. “There he is. The scowling Draco Malfoy we all love.”</p><p>As the kids climbed out of the infinity pool that looked out to the coast, Draco was awaiting them with towels and a potion bottle of his own concoction.</p><p>“So will I still get a tan or is this stuff going to bleach me to Malfoy Glow number one?” Albus looked suspiciously at the bottle.</p><p>“Al!” Rose scolded her cousin, though she had the same thought. “Um, thank you Mr. Malfoy but my mum sent me with factor fifty.” She took her wand out of her holster and summoned it from her bag.</p><p>The two Malfoy men looked confused, but Daphne went on to explain. “Muggle sunscreen. Comes in a variety of levels to protect you from burning but you can still tan. Honestly Draco. You need to get out. Literally. You’re almost translucent.”</p><p>“Yeah, I’ll use that when you’re done, Rosie,” Albus told her. “I’d like to look at least a shade darker than the Bloody Baron.”</p><p>Daphne smirked at the young man and noticed the way the rivulets of water dripped through the channels of this lean, toned abdomen. “Albus, do you play Quidditch like your parents?”</p><p>Draco cast an incredulous look in her direction.</p><p>Potter ran his fingers through his wet fringe and pushed it out of his face. “No. I’m a bit more grounded. I prefer Muggle skateboarding and gardening.”</p><p>“Interesting…” she tapped the side of her chin. “Are Muggle sports and activities becoming more popular at Hogwarts now?”</p><p>“Actually, Aunt Daphne,” Scorpius started while rubbing in the potion, “We have a fitness center, and physical education is now a required course. Can you get my back, Rose?”</p><p>Rose nodded in response.</p><p>Daphne grimaced, grateful that she never had to exercise much beyond stair climbing while at school. Pitying the kids, she said, “Sounds arduous.”</p><p>“Incredibly,” Rose added, “but,” she said with a sigh, “I’m half Weasley. If I have any goals of looking like my mother at her age, I need to start now.”</p><p>“Oh come on,” Albus said defensively smearing the cream on his arms, “my mum’s not fat.”</p><p>“But she was a professional Quidditch player until Lily was born and still works out with Uncle Harry three times a week. She knows what awaits her without working out.” Rose huffed. “Aside from Dominique and Victoire, <em> damn veela genes, </em>and of course Lily, the rest of our cousins are little…you know…” she puffed out her cheeks alluding to their plumpness.</p><p>“Rosie,” Albus rolled his eyes with annoyance, “You’re a fucking twig. I don’t think there is a chance in Hell you’ll ever get fat.”</p><p>“Well, I think you will look beautiful no matter what,” Scorpius whispered in her ear before placing a little kiss on her lobe.</p><p>“And Rose,” Draco added, “You’re almost the spitting image of your mother with the exception of the hair. Thankfully your strawberry blonde curls are much <em> much </em> tamer than hers,” he couldn’t hold back a little chuckle, “If you take after her, you’ll be more than fine.”</p><p>“Oh, have you been eyeing the Minister, Draco?” Daphne said with playful accusation.</p><p>His cheeks flushed slightly at the accidental admission. Trying to cover his tracks, he sputtered, “Granger is just aging well. Anyone can see that.”</p><p>Daphne smirked and let her silent reply unnerve her brother-in-law. Draco clicked his tongue and rolled his eyes defiantly, refusing to dignify Daphne with a response. The teenagers passed each other looks, unsure how to break the awkward silence.</p><p>An audible grumble came from Scorpius’s gut. That got everyone’s attention. He asked his aunt, “So...lunch?”</p><p>The party of five ate and laughed while sitting around the glass and wrought iron table, drinking sangria and Italian delicacies. Her elf set out a lunch of antipasti with locally cured meats fresh cheese, pickled vegetables, and olives. The first course followed by linguini with prawns, and a final course of pan-seared branzino finished with blistered tomatoes and capers.</p><p>When they had their fill, the house elf returned with a bottle of limoncello and five small ceramic cups. Daphne took it upon herself to pour for her guests. “Thank you, Twinkie. You may go now.”</p><p>Draco choked on the lemon liqueur and sputtered, “Twinkie! You can’t be serious.” He laughed somewhat indignantly, “Oh, do you also have an elf named, Leather Daddy? What about Bender?” The usually composed Malfoy patriarch erupted into hysterics. Daphne was not amused. His laughter was contagious; it didn’t take long for Scorpius, Rose, and Albus to join in. “Who named the elf? Please tell me it was Blaise. Oh, that tosser was planting hints right under your nose. Did he also buy that David replica in the garden? Oh, and the Atlas? That abstract black marble statue in the hall? It’s a dick, isn’t it?”</p><p>Daphne crossed her arms; her lips pulled thin, unamused with his antics. Everything was fun for a little while, but he had struck a nerve. She flipped her hand abruptly, urging him to desist. “Kids, why don’t you jump in the pool. The grown-ups need to talk.”</p><p>Suddenly aware of the change in mood, they complied without any resistance.</p><p>“Daph, come on, I was just—“ Draco looked into her eyes and saw they were starting to gloss over with tears. He swallowed hard, hating himself at that moment. “Oh, Daph. I’m so sorry. Come here.”</p><p>She gracefully fell into his lap, threw her arms around his neck, and began sobbing. Daphne had kept a cold demeanor through the whole ordeal—the discovery of the affair, the confrontation, the divorce proceedings, everything. But here, in the company of what was left of her family, she let the barriers down.</p><p>“It’s okay. Let it out.” Draco kissed the top of her head and rubbed circles gently on her back. “The tosser didn’t deserve you.”</p><p>“But I loved him, and I gave him the best years of my life,” she choked.</p><p>“Your best years of you are still ahead of you,” Draco said with some uncertainty. They were the same age and had his own apprehensions about growing older.</p><p>“Liar,” she sniffed and wiped her eyes. “Look at us. You became a widower at forty-one, and I’m divorced. Why don’t we get the happily ever afters?”</p><p>He suddenly felt a heavy weight on his chest. “I don’t know, Daph...” Laughing caught his attention, and he saw Rose and Scorpius sharing a private conversation and kisses. They were lost in their own world, and this made Draco beam with pride. “‘Happily ever after’ isn’t the same for everyone. Despite all the shit I’ve been dealt, I have him.”</p><p>“You’re so lucky you have Scorpius,” she said, finally sitting up. “ Blaise was apparently more interested in fucking boys than making them.”</p><p>Draco wanted to snicker but knew the jab was half-hearted and didn’t warrant a verbal reaction. He and Astoria had always hoped that Scorpius would have a cousin, but it never happened. “You know he’s your blood too.”</p><p>“I know,” she said wistfully. “He has her smile.”</p><p>“And her kindness,” Draco said plainly, trying not to look mournful.</p><p>“Maybe you and I should just get married,” Daphne uttered casually.</p><p>Trying to process her words, he responded, <em> “What?” </em></p><p>“Neither of us want to start over. Let’s just get married and be a family,” she said as it were the most natural solution to their problems.</p><p>He took her hands, “And ruin this? Come on Daphne. You know that is ridiculous. We’ll be a family no matter what. You’ll get through this, and one day you’ll move on.”</p><p>“Oh, like you?” She accused.</p><p>Draco removed one of his hands from hers and ruffled his hair. “Okay. Yeah. I’m scared to move on too.” He couldn’t enumerate his fears. There were just too many.</p><p>Woefully she asked, “Then what do we do?”</p><p>“How about, we set little goals for ourselves?” He suggested.</p><p>“Such as?”</p><p>“By the end of this summer, we start viewing ourselves as just that. Ourselves. Not a divorcee or a widower or a single father or an heir or heiress. Just,” he pointed at her, “Daphne Greengrass,” and then pointed at his own chest, “And Draco Malfoy.”</p><p>“That’s an attainable goal,” she said thoughtfully. “And by the end of this year, we would have gone on a date and shagged someone.”</p><p>Draco paled at that thought. “A date, maybe...but sex…”</p><p>“Good, god! Who are you?” Daphne howled indignantly. “Draco, I adore that you loved my sister and were beyond faithful, but she’s gone now. You need to find that old part of you.” She began to point at his chest repeatedly. “Find. That. Confident. Pussy magnet.”</p><p>He turned the tables on her, “Then you be sex on legs that had everyone and their dad wanting you. Did you really do Adrian and his dad in the same night?”</p><p>“I’ll never tell,” she said with a wink. “Why is it that we never had sex with each other?”</p><p>“We knew how utterly disgusting we were,” he retorted plainly.</p><p>“Ah, so true,” she snickered. “So tell me...how’s Granger looking these days?”</p><p>Draco shot Daphne an evil glance and grabbed her by the waist. In a flash, he Apparated them to the pool’s edge. “What was that Daph?”</p><p>“No!” she squealed. “You wouldn’t!”</p><p>It didn’t take much more than a little shift of his weight, and they fell into the pool, splashing the teenagers.</p><p>Daphne was the first to surface and began swimming to the edge. As she emerged and stripped off her robe and sandals, sunlight glinted off her hoop earrings and caught Albus’s attention. He tilted his sunglasses down and saw dewy, sun-kissed skin, long legs, full hips, a flat stomach, and an outrageous rack. Daphne Greengrass was every teenage boy’s wank fantasy. It didn’t matter she was the same age as his parents. She was fucking hot and just looking at her gave him a mild boner. At that moment he realized the summer could prove most interesting.</p>
