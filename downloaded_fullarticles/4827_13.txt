          <div class="userstuff"><p>James has Teddy pinned to the wall, hands gripping his biceps, <i>grinding</i> against Teddy's cock.</p>
<p>Teddy pushes against him, his cock trapped in his pants. He's about to say something to encourage James but he doesn't have to.</p>
<p>"I know you." James kisses Teddy's lips then begins his descent. "There's nothing you love more than getting your cock sucked."</p>
<p>"That's not entirely true," Teddy says, pouting, but gasps when James pulls down the zip and frees his aching prick. </p>
<p>Then nothing.</p>
<p>He looks down at James who has an eyebrow raised, mouth tantalisingly close to where Teddy wants it most.</p>
<p>"All right," Teddy says, surrendering to his need, "you're right."</p>
<p>James grins and gives Teddy a stroke. "You know what I love most?"</p>
<p>Teddy lets his head fall back as James takes him into his mouth and starts to suck. His hand cradles Teddy's sac, his fingers squeezing just so.</p>
<p>"Fucking me," Teddy breathes out. "With your mouth, your hands, your perfect dick."</p>
<p>James chuckles again. "Perfect, is it?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yeah." Teddy can already feel James inside him, Teddy scrabbling at the wall, legs spread wide, as James slams into him, the sound of flesh on flesh echoing through the room. </p>
<p>James takes Teddy deep, moves a finger back to Teddy's hole and, as soon as he slips inside, Teddy's lost.</p>
<p>"Fuck," he says through gritted teeth as his balls tighten, come bursting into James's mouth. James sucks and licks and sucks until Teddy's weak in the knees.</p>
<p>"What brought this on?" Teddy asks, breathless, though he's not complaining. </p>
<p>"Fucking blacksmith," James says, rolling his eyes, knowing how ridiculous it sounds perhaps. "All sweaty, muscles flexing, pounding that anvil...."</p>
<p>Teddy brushes James's bottom lip with his thumb. "I was more interested in the sword swallower."</p>
<p>James laughs. "Of course you were."</p></div>
