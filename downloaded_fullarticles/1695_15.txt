          <div class="userstuff"><p>Thomas Burke was a veteran Auror, having joined as soon as he'd graduated from Hogwarts 20 years ago. He'd seen a fair amount of disturbing and grisly crime scenes, and during the war, the deaths had become extremely gruesome.</p>
<p>He had <i>never</i>, in his entire life, seen a dead body as <i>bizarre</i> as the one in front of him.</p>
<p>The most feared wizard of this generation, the leader of the Death Eaters, You-Know-Who himself, was lying on the floor of the Potter residence, chock full of holes and giving off a slight odor of urine. He'd clearly bled out, and based on the wetness of his robes, had also been peed on.</p>
<p>Thomas sighed. "So, Mr. Potter, just to be perfectly clear, you're saying a <i>deer</i> did this?"</p>
<p>James Potter looked at him. "Technically, it was a stag, but yes. A stag just appeared out of nowhere when Voldy here came in and just… impaled him. Right through the eye into the brain. Felt nasty… I would imagine. Because I was totally frozen in shock right over here."</p>
<p>Thomas could feel the beginnings of a headache coming on. "Where did the urine come from?"</p>
<p>"The stag peed on the body before it ran away. I don't know where it went," Potter replied. "Anyway, is that it?"</p>
<p>Thomas considered his options for a moment. He was pretty sure Potter was hiding something, but to be perfectly frank, he didn't much care. You-Know-Who was finally dead, Thomas was tired, and from the way Potter was anxiously glancing at the stairs, he wanted to see his family. "Yeah, that's it," he said. "Have a good evening, Mr. Potter."</p></div>
