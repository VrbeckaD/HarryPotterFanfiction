    <p> <i>Three brothers ventured out on a journey to the unknown. While on their journey while traveling along a lonely winding road at twilight the brothers reached a river that was too deep to wade through and too dangerous to cross. However these were no ordinary brothers. They were trained in the magical arts, so when they encountered the river each brother just simply raised their wands and conjured a bridge to cross the treacherous waters. As they journeyed halfway across it, the brothers were stopped by a mysterious hooded figure.</i></p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Death spoke to them. He was angry that he had been cheated out of three new souls, for travelers usually drowned in the river. But Death was cunning. He pretended to congratulate the brothers upon their magic and said that each had earned a prize for having been so clever to evade him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>So the eldest brother, who was a combative man, asked for a wand more powerful than any in existence; a wand that must always win duels for its owner, a wand worthy of a wizard who conquered Death! So Death crossed to an elder tree on the banks of the river, fashioned a wand from a branch that hung there, and gave it to the eldest brother.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Then the second brother, who was an arrogant man, decided that he wanted to humiliate Death still further, and asked for the power to recall others from Death. So Death picked up a stone from the riverbank and gave it to the second brother, and told him that the stone would have the power to bring back the dead.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>And then Death asked the third and youngest brother what he would like. The youngest brother was the humblest and also the wisest of the brothers, and he did not trust Death. So he asked for something that would enable him to go forth from that place without being followed by Death. And death, most unwillingly, handed over his own Cloak of Invisibility.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Then Death stood aside and allowed the three brothers to continue on their way, and they did so, talking with wonder of the adventure they had had, and admiring Death’s gifts. In due course the brothers separated, each for his own destination.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>The first brother traveled on for a week or more, and reaching a distant village, sought out a fellow wizard with whom he had a quarrel. Naturally with the Elder Wand as his weapon, he could not fail to win the duel that followed. Leaving his enemy dead upon the floor, the oldest brother proceeded to an inn, where he boasted loudly of the powerful wand he had snatched from Death himself, and of how it made him invincible.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>That very night, another wizard crept upon the oldest brother as he lay, wine-sodden, upon his bed. The thief took the wand and, for good measure, slit the oldest brother’s throat.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>And so Death took the first brother for his own.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p>
 Saddened by the news of their recently deceased brother, the two youngest arranged a funeral for their poorly arrogant and combative eldest brother. In the end, the turn out was just that, the two youngest brothers. When the youngest walked up to his brothers grave he kneeled next to it. As he placed his hand upon the newly patted soil he spoke with much grieve.
</p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p>
 "I wish I had better memories with you my eldest brother, I will always love you."<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>
</p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p>
 All his other brother could do was stand there and watch him in his act, not thinking of his brother in this time.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span class="Apple-converted-space">
    <em> </em>
  </span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Meanwhile, the second brother journeyed to his own home, where he lived alone. Here he took out the stone that had the power to recall the dead, and turned it thrice in his hand. To his amazement and his delight, the figure of the girl he had once hoped to marry, before her untimely death, appeared at once before him.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Yet she was sad and cold, separated from him as by a veil. Though she had returned to the mortal world, she did not truly belong there and suffered. Finally the second brother, driven mad with hopeless longing, killed himself so as truly to join her.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>And so Death took the second brother for his own.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p>
Having to bury another sibling, his only one left, was a hard thing to do to say the least. He stood above both of their graves, he thought it’d be best for them to be buried aside each other as they were close.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>
</p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p>
The youngest brother contemplated on words to say, it had to been him as once again he was the only one that showed up. After a few minutes of thinking he finally spoke.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>
</p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p>
 "Brother, I wish I had more time with you as well. I wish both of your lives didn’t end in greed. I vow to not let mine end the same way."<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>
</p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p>
He said his goodbyes and journeyed off with those words still in his heart.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>
</p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>But though Death searched for the third brother for many years, he was never able to find him.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p>
Death looked frantically for 60 years in search of the youngest brother. It had been so easy to find the other two, so why not this one? Death never forgot about him, always missing the one man he somewhat considered a friend and a kind soul who held no greed in his heart. In the mist of his search, he was never able to find him.
</p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It was only when he had attained a great age that the youngest brother finally took off the Cloak of Invisibility and gave it to his son.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p>
The youngest brother took off his cloak that he had been gifted by death. Feeling that it was time and as he knew his own son was ready to live without him. As he hand the cloak to his son he looked up at him from his kneeled position and smiled.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>
</p>
<p>
"Son, may you live a wondrous live filled with love and walk your days with heart that has no room for greed." The youngest brother smiled at his son as he looked past his shoulder a familiar shadowy figure that he once knew.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>
</p>
<p>
"I’ll always love you."
</p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>And then he greeted Death as an old friend, and went with him gladly, and, equals, they departed this life. </em>
