    <p>The night was cold and the drizzle was persistent as Hermione stepped out from the noisy, packed pub, pulling her grey woollen coat tightly around her as her body adjusted from the balmy heat of drunken bodies pressed tightly together to the chill of the night’s air, waving one last time to her colleagues as the door swung closed behind her. She stood for a moment watching her breath fog in front of her, considering if she should just turn around, go back inside and have one more drink, to postpone the inevitable loneliness of the night, but she knew that she could not avoid it forever and her feet were tired from a long day at work.</p>
<p>With a sigh, she stepped down from the doorway and into the street and began to make her way home, the shouts of laugher and bad singing from those inside still ringing in her ears. She could have apparated and been home in a second but instead she shivered from the chill in the air, wrapped a scarf tightly around her neck and hugged her arms around her body to keep warm.</p>
<p>The miserable weather and the cold bite to the air seemed to have discouraged people from venturing outside and Hermione saw very few people on the streets, those who were, hurried along with heads bowed against the wind, disappearing down side streets which led to their homes as quickly as possible. She was startled by a laugh and looked up to see a couple ahead of her, arms wrapped around one another, seemingly impervious to the rain and the chill, so caught up in each others eyes. The girl grabbed her boyfriend’s face between her hands and pulled his lips down to meet her own. She smiled sadly at them, thinking how lovely it was to be in love and how she couldn’t remember the last time she had looked at anyone with such tenderness and joy.</p>
<p>She hurried across the busy road and made her way onto the quieter residential streets, lined with houses with curtains drawn or obscured from view with tall hedges. Her flat, sensible, work shoes made very little noise of the pavement and it made her feel strangely cut off from the world around her.</p>
<p>It was as she passed the park, the one she walked across every single day on her way home from worked enjoying the bustle of the loud children, that the feeling that she was not alone crept up on her. There was no single moment that caused her to think this, no snap of a twig, no figure spotted out of the corner of her eye, no strange shadow falling across her path. But it was a thought that she could not shake, like eyes boring into the back of her head. She itched to grab her wand out of her coat pocket, but the street was a muggle area and she would not allow herself to be the next story in the Daily Prophet of a breach of the Statute of Secrecy, she would never live it down at work. She tried to brush it off, reminding herself that she prided her ability to be logical and rational, but it did not matter, she just knew.</p>
<p>Her breathing shallowed and the hairs on her arms stood up on end, every nerve tingling with panic. Should she run? Would that let them know that she was on to them, prompt them to chase and catch her. She was not in an approved apparition zone and, even with her panic, was not willing to risk the paperwork and scolding that would come if she chose to apparate just because she felt something. She glanced at the houses as she walked past, could she knock on one of the doors and ask if they would let her in? But they might reach her before she reached the door, and she did not know what she might be bringing to an unsuspecting muggle’s doorway. No, that option would not do.</p>
<p>“You have ridden a dragon, you have faced Lord Voldemort, you are not some scared little girl,” she hissed at herself, “so for goodness sake, <em>get a grip</em>.”</p>
<p>She shook her head, as though to shake away the feeling of discomfort and continued on with a more purposeful stride. It lasted for no more than five seconds until the creeping sensation of wrongness was upon her again, boring into her back. She gazed into the darkness of the park across the street, one of the swings was swaying silently back and forth, was it the wind or had someone brushed past it as they walked parallel to her, hidden by the bushes that lined the fence that separated the area from the street.</p>
<p>Her focus fell to the entrance to the park which was just ahead. If someone was in there and wanted to get to her that is where they would do it, the more she considered it the more she was convinced that someone must be stood just outside of the pool of illumination from the street light ready to grab her as she walked by. Her hand slipped into her pocket and felt the comforting solidness of her wand and she thought about what she should do.</p>
<p>She would continue to walk, she resolved, until she reached the gate, at which point she would run, she was only one street over from the house, it would be a short sprint to the door and the safety of the wards that surrounded it. If it was a muggle just trying their luck on an unsuspecting passer by then they would simply grow a little confused and wander away. If it was something more menacing then she had been researching some new hexes recently and was itching for an excuse to try them out.</p>
<p>She was seconds away, six more steps and she would be there. She took her hand out of her pocket, leaving her wand inside and took a couple of deeps breaths to ready herself.</p>
<p>Three.</p>
<p>Two.</p>
<p>One – <em>and run.</em></p>
<p>She didn’t allow herself to look to her left into the park as she passed, knowing that if she saw a figure there it would stall her and cause her to slow. The slapping of her feet against the concrete and her breath hitching as she ran was all she could hear, she did not know if there was anyone following her, but knowing what could happen when you were caught, it was not a gamble that she was willing to make.</p>
<p>She was so close when it happened. She was on her road, could see the front door of Number 12 Grimmauld Place unveiling itself, pushing the other houses aside as it settled into place, only ten meters ahead of her. She was so close, almost safe.</p>
<p>A tall, dark figure stepped out from behind the last of the tall trees that lined the pavement and stood still, arms out to his side ready to catch her.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>----------</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry was sat in the kitchen of Grimmauld Place enjoying a dinner begrudgingly prepared by Kreacher while he completed writing a report that he needed to present to the Minister of Magic the following morning. Not quite the exciting Friday nights that he had envisioned when picturing his ideal adulthood, he though wryly as he spooned more pumpkin soup into his mouth and scratched out a sentence half way down the page.</p>
<p>The fireplace behind him roared with green flame and Harry looked up from the parchment he was reviewing to watch his best friend step out of the hearth, brushing soot from his shoulders as he did so. Kreacher, grumbling, popped up behind him seconds later with a dustpan and brush to sweep away the pile of ash that collected around him, tripping Ron as he tried to step forward into the room. “</p>
<p>Kreacher you bloody menace, at least let me get out the fire before you assault me!” Ron grumbled, as he caught himself and managed to remain upright.</p>
<p>Harry heard Kreacher grumble something about blood-traitors before he shuffled away once more.</p>
<p>“Ron!” Harry exclaimed happily, ignoring the exchange and getting up to pull his friend into a hug, “I didn’t know you would be back this weekend?”</p>
<p>Hugging him back, Ron grinned, “Our match against the Wigtown Wanderers was postponed as they’re now 21 hours deep into playing the Magpies and apparently there’s no sign that its going to end any time soon. Coach postponed it to next week instead, so free weekend!”</p>
<p>Ron had been the Keeper for the Appleby Arrows for the past six months, having worked his way off of the reserves bench after three years of hard training. Since that time, his residence at Grimmauld Place was sporadic and with little notice of when he would be there, often opting to stay in whichever town the team were playing in to party with his teammates instead. Harry was thankful that Ginny, second chaser to the Hollyhead Harpies did not seem so interested in partying as hard and managed to be back most nights without any negative affect upon her career. Harry missed having Ron with him at work, they had completed two years of Auror training together before Ron had decided it was not the job for him and had been offered a place on the team.</p>
<p>“That’s great,” Harry grinned, “Ginny’s got a match tomorrow, maybe the three of us could go and watch?”</p>
<p>“Oh, I invited Melissa to stay too, hope you don’t mind.” Ron said flippantly as he sat down at the table and helped himself to the bread roll that was on Harry’s plate.</p>
<p>Before Harry could respond the fireplace roared again and Melissa stepped into the room. Kreacher, livid at the further intrusion into his evening, appeared again and began furiously scrubbing at a spot of soot on her shoe.</p>
<p>“Kreacher,” Harry snapped, “leave her alone, so and polish some silver or something!”</p>
<p>With a huff, Kreacher disappeared.</p>
<p>Ron snorted as the house elf left and announced, by way of introduction, “Melissa Green, Harry Potter.”</p>
<p>Harry smiled and stuck out his hand to shake adding, “Sorry about Kreacher he gets a bit over the top sometimes, I’ve given him about fifty-seven socks by now and he still refuses to leave so we’re stuck with him!”</p>
<p>Harry recognised the star-struck expression that adorned Melissa’s face and quickly withdrew his hand while she remained frozen in place, he cleared his throat awkwardly.</p>
<p>“Right, well, that went great.” Ron muttered standing back up and cramming the last of the bread into his mouth, he took his girlfriend by the shoulders and turned her towards the kitchen door, “we’ll just nip out of a bit of air and let her brain catch up.” He grinned at Harry, as he slipped an arm around her waist and steered her out of the room.</p>
<p>As they made their way to the front door it swung open and Ginny stepped inside, broom over her shoulder and kit bag in hand.</p>
<p>“Ginny, this is Mel-” Ron started, but she dropped her bag to the ground and held up her hand in protest.</p>
<p>“Ah, ah! You know my rule dear brother; I won’t bother learning their names until they last at least three months.” She smiled an insincere smile in the direction of Melissa and picked up her bag once more, making her way into the kitchen, “Hope you last!” She called over her shoulder leaving them alone in the hallway once more.</p>
<p>“Well that was my sister,” Ron shrugged, “the Harpies are an apt team for her given how she is one. Come on, I need a smoke.”</p>
<p>He wrenched open the door in frustration and made his way into the street, Melissa following mutely behind, cheeks burning red.</p>
<p>“I didn’t do very well in there did I?” She sighed as she watched Ron light a cigarette and take a deep drag.</p>
<p>“It certainly could have gone better.” Ron agreed as he took her hand and pulled her towards him, she laughed and pressed herself against him, kissing him lightly, enjoying the taste of smoke on his lips, “But don’t mind them, once they know you, they’ll love you.”</p>
<p>He stepped away and took another deep drag of the cigarette before passing it to her. The night was quiet and Ron stood with his face pointed up to the moon, enjoying the peace. It lasted only a few seconds before a persistent slapping sound pierced the silence, he frowned and stepped out into the street to work out where it was coming from, it was only his Keeper reflexes that stopped the woman from barrelling into him as he caught her by the arms.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>----------</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hermione let out a shriek of panic and dismay as hands tightened around her upper arms, her fists came up and hammered against the broad chest of her attacker as she tried to pull away but the grip held her tight.</p>
<p>“Mione?” A familiar voice broke through her panic, “Hey, Hermione, relax its just me.”</p>
<p>As her captor began to laugh she stopped and looked up to take in Ron’s face grinning down at her. She paused for a moment, catching her breath and feeling her heart pounding in her chest.</p>
<p>“Ronald-<em>fucking</em>-Weasley!” her fists came up once more and battered against his chest, “You bloody scared the hell out of me!” Tears pricked in her eyes as she tried to control her breathing.</p>
<p>“What the hell were you running for?” He chuckled, “The most exercise that I’ve seen you do before now is hefting books in the library.”</p>
<p>Hermione’s cheeks reddened as the ridiculousness of the situation sank in, she scolded herself for being scared of a fake stalker. She realised how closely she was standing to Ron and that a woman was stood nearby watching them, her cheeks reddened even further and she stepped back out of his grip. She smelt the smoke and relief surged through her.</p>
<p>“Are you smoking again Ronald? You promised your mother that you would quit last Christmas, she is going to be very disappointed in you.” She snapped, using Ron’s hesitation to her advantage she barrelled past him and into the house, casting a lingering glance to the woman as she passed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>----------</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“So, who’s the woman?” Hermione asked as she entered the kitchen, throwing her coat over one of the wooden chairs after extracting her wand from the pocket.</p>
<p>“The newest floozy.” Ginny offered.</p>
<p>“Her name is Melissa.” Harry supplied, rolling his eyes at his girlfriend’s comment.</p>
<p>Hermione said nothing further as she flicked her wand at the kettle and watched as it rapidly boiled, but her mind ran through the usual checklist that it seems her mind will not let her escape.</p>
<p>
  <em>Taller than me, but still a head shorter than Ron, he’d be pleased with that, she can still wear heels when they go out. Sleek hair, much more manageable, bet she can just roll out of bed in the morning. Blonde too, like the last two, it seems Ron is developing a preference there. Curvy hips, Molly will say they look like childbearing hips, that will be a point in her favour. Intellect, to be determined.</em>
</p>
<p>Hermione snorted quietly to herself as, so far, he had set the bar low in that respect, it seemed the average quidditch groupie did not have a lot of time to crack open a book between matches.</p>
<p>This would be the fifth woman that Ron had paraded before them in the last year following their break up Hermione realised. Every time a new woman followed him through the fireplace with her big adoring puppy dog eyes Hermione could not help but feel a twinge of frustration as she marked herself against them. With her own critical eye, it was rare that she ever measured up.</p>
<p>As Ron and Melissa re-joined the room, Hermione attempted to participate in the conversation but she found she was unable to focus and so, after ten minutes of forced politeness, she made her excuses and escaped to her room.</p>
<p>“I am not jealous.” She reminded herself as she climbed the stairs.</p>
<p>“I am better off without him anyway, the break up was as much my idea as it was his.” She assured herself as she stepped into the shower.</p>
<p>“Its <em>good</em> that he’s moving on, Ron is my friend, of course I want him to be happy.” She insisted as she climbed into her cold bed, alone.</p>
<p>They had tried to make it work. For three years following the end of the war, they had clung to each other desperately in their grief and pulled each other through it and out the other side. Or so Hermione had thought, but it seemed that some wounds had been thinly papered over as they celebrated their victories and buried their dead. It was only as Ron began his Quidditch career and began leaving for weeks at a time for training and matches abroad that Hermione realised that she had not forgiven him for leaving them in the forest, and every time he left her heart broke all over again. After one too many arguments the couple realised that they did not have the fight in them to continue and decided to go their separate ways.</p>
<p>A task that was somewhat difficult given they both technically remained living in Grimmauld Place. For once, Hermione was thankful for the frequency in which Ron left.</p>
<p>For a year or so, Ron had remained single, but it seemed the attention and delight of the women that surrounded him was irresistible and, once he had given in to their pull, there was no going back and since then Hermione had bitterly endured his ability to move on when she did not seem to be able to do the same, burying herself in her work and little else.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>----------</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It was the middle of the night when a sound roused Hermione from her sleep, she grabbed her wand and with a small flick she groaned as read the numbers, five AM. She stilled and listened trying to place the sound that she heard, Walburga was not screaming as so it was unlikely to be an intruder she concluded. A rhythmic squeaking sound invaded the quiet of the house and a moan soon followed. Hermione grimaced, finally placing the sound.</p>
<p>“Oh for goodness sake Ronald,” She snapped, “Learn to cast a bloody silencing charm.”</p>
<p>She swung her legs out of the bed and shoved her feet angrily into her slippers, unwilling to lie in bed listening to her ex-boyfriend and new girlfriend going at it in the room above her. She made her way down stairs, resolving to make a cup of tea and wait them out. As she got to the landing she could see a light already shining through the crack beneath the kitchen door. Satisfied that she would have someone else who had been woken that she could complain with, she hurried into the room.</p>
<p>Harry was pacing the floor, an owl sat on the kitchen table pecking at some crumbs that had been left over from dinner, as Harry read the letter that had been delivered. Hermione could see the stricken look upon his face and concluded that it was not the final member of their trio who had awoken him so early.</p>
<p>“Harry? What’s wrong?” She asked, placing a hand on his shoulder, ignoring the indignant hoot of the owl, expecting a treat.</p>
<p>Harry turned to face her, distraught, angry and frustrated.</p>
<p>“There’s another one Hermione. Another witch is missing. I don't know what we're going to do.”</p>
