    <p>He remembers seeing white. Pure, beautiful white wings. Wings that enveloped him. They were small, so very small. Not the average wingspan but small, nonetheless. But they were white, pure, and so, very beautiful. Something that pure in the darkness of the Magical world. He does remember the warmth of the wings. A soft voice calling to him. Telling him to fight the venom that Nagini had injected into him. He remembers smelling the scent of iron and copper. His blood pouring from his neck. The voice that had called to him shook and cried. And, then he was enveloped in those pure white glowing wings. And, then, he was plunged into darkness. The next time he woke, it was a month of him being put on a stasis by the Healers, in order for his body to recuperate and heal.</p><p> </p><p>After healing up, Severus was thrusted into doing physical therapy the Muggle way. It was annoying but it helped his body and his wings. His wings…they were dangerous to anyone who dared tried touching his wings without his consent. Many found their fingers getting sliced off or cut into by his wings. His deep dark black wings may look soft and inviting, but they would turn into sharp blades. He was a renowned Death Eater and Spy and his reputation of using his wings as a weapon in battle had put fear in people. He would never let anyone touch his wings, unless they were his mate.</p><p> </p><p>His mate…</p><p> </p><p>That’s a good question. Who was his mate? Severus never bothered trying to connect to his soulmate. He knew he had a soulmate somewhere, out there. But he was too busy playing Spy for both the Dark Lord and Dumbledore—and protecting that ungrateful pretty green-eyed boy.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Flashes of green eyes staring at him. Mouth curling up in a smile at him from a distance.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Severus shook his head. No, he would not think of Potter like <em>that</em>. The boy was a nuisance to him. He’d tried protecting the damn boy for so many years. The boy was a constant danger to himself. But one question that had always stood deep, in the back of his mind. Where was Potter’s wings? James and Lily both had wings. James a deep dark brown, and Lily a light pastel red. He’s heard of some Witches and Wizards not being born with sometimes, but it was a rare case though. With the stories he’s heard, Wizards and Witches without wings were considered nothing but human with no magic. Sometimes, their own family would end up abandoning those without wings. It was harsh, what the world had come into, but it was starting to get better in the Magical world with those who were born without wings.</p><p> </p><p>He’s never seen Potter’s wings before. Not that he remembers seeing them. Not even once. No one can conceal their wings that long. Your back would start to hurt, and it would feel as if a bone was tearing right through you, if you haven’t let your wings out. Severus had gone for almost an entire month of not releasing his wings to stretch them, until it became to unbearable. It was something he’d rather regret. His wings had ended up slicing his entire back; steel feather blades cutting through his back, pushing through the flesh. Shivering at the sour memory, Severus turned his attention back at the students that were now gathering in the Great Hall.</p><p> </p><p>After he was released, Minerva had offered him the position of Headmaster. If he didn’t take it, Minerva herself would take the position. No, he will take the position. They needed someone who can protect the castle and students from anymore attacks and he can punish unruly students, who simply, cannot follow rules. Sitting at the head table, Severus noticed that a certain green-eyed boy sat a couple seats down from him, next to Minerva. He glanced over to the boy, taking in the boy’s deathly pale appearance. The dark circles under his eyes. The way the boy hugged in on himself. Severus wonders if the boy was simply having nightmares and could not sleep? He would have to check with Potter later. It was a month into the school year, and Severus had offered a position for Potter. A position for Defense Against the Dark Arts. The seventeen-year-old boy had accepted the position. He was probably one of the youngest DADA professors at Hogwarts, but that didn’t stop on how good the boy was at learning and taking all the information for the class, in order to teach the unruly children.</p><p> </p><p>“Hmph.” Severus huffed, taking his cup of tea to his lips, sipping it slow.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>His back ached and was sore as hell, he thought. Harry shifted his back, almost groaning in pain at the sensation. It’s been a while since he let his wings out, but he didn’t want to do it in the presence of others. His wings were…well, rather small. Because of his living situation and life when he was still with the Dursley’s, his body remained skinny, short and small. Which resulted in his wings being short, small and well, rather messy and fluffy like his hair. It was annoying. He’s never had anyone groom his wings for him before. Not Hermione. Not Ron. Not anyone. Maybe except that one and two times when Luna Lovegood had cornered him, forcing him to bare his wings to her, so she can groom and take care of his wings</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>“You shouldn’t have to hide your wings, Harry.” Luna said, as she smoothed a brush over his messy fluffy wings. “Just because you’re small and your wings are small, they are beautiful and pure. No one has white wings and you’re the first. White wings are considered pure, holy light. One day, when you meet your mate, they will love all of you and will never judge you for being small and having small wings.” Luna smiled over Harry’s shoulder. “Therefore, try to bring your wings out, Harry. When the light from the sun and moon shines on these wings, they glow, and I can see magic seeping out of them. Truly beautiful.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Darkness surround you, Harry. It’s not an evil and bad kind of Darkness. But I think it is your Mate protecting you.” Luna murmured in her strange, slurred and dazed voice. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Your Mate is strong and powerful. Tall and dark. Very dominant. His wings black as the night, eyes pool of darkness. He’s waiting for you to shine brightly in his world of Darkness.” Luna hummed with a smile, making Harry feel warm and safe as she ran the brush over his wings. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“He’s waiting for you to fill his sky with bright little stars—yours is the biggest and brightest and soon, you will fill his darkness with tiny baby stars.” Luna giggled. “Babies…Stars…”</em>
</p><p> </p><p>After the war, Harry had started to seek Luna out to groom his wings. He felt safe with her in order to groom his wings for him. He could do it himself, but he couldn’t reach certain parts of his wings that needed help, and he always ends up pulling out his feathers by mistake. He never liked having anyone touch his wings. It was because during his abuse when he was still Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon, they would torture him by pulling at his wings. They would step on the bone that connected to his back, slightly twisting his wings, making him scream in pain. Because his wings were small, they weren’t strong enough to support him to be able to fly. It was unfortunate but it is what it is. Harry couldn’t change that. And with his wings being small, he didn’t have to worry about the heavy weight of his wings pulling at him.</p><p> </p><p>His mind somehow, wondered to a certain, tall, dark and dominant Headmaster with very black beautiful wings. His back—his wings shivered in delight when he thought about the dark winged Headmaster of Hogwarts. Severus was powerful and strong. Yes, so very strong. Powerful to protect him and strong to protect their future flock—</p><p> </p><p>Snapping his mind back, Harry shook his head. No, he can’t think of Severus like that. He wasn’t sure if he would like the old Potions Master to be his mate. He didn’t want the older man to ridicule him and make fun of his wings. Nope. No. Not happening. But still…that day in the Shrieking Shack, when Harry had cried over Severus—the moment, when Harry laid a hand on Severus’ neck and head, his wings sprouted out from his back, blinding white light engulfing the entire shack. Golden swirls of light circled around them until the white light disappeared. Leaving Harry in shock at the feeling. He didn’t know what that was. But somehow, he felt complete just being by the Professor.</p><p> </p><p>And, when Snape had been unconscious and was put in a stasis sleep for a month, Harry visited every day. His wings shivering in delight whenever he was next to the Professor. Harry would take Snape’s hand into his and felt their magic connecting. Somehow, what had happened at the shack, Snape’s wound had started to heal immediately, but the scar will always still be there on his neck. Every time, Harry was away from Snape, his heart would feel so heavy. Like a hole deep within his soul was missing. And whenever, he was near Snape, that feeling disappeared.</p><p> </p><p>“Harry, what’s wrong, dear?” Minvera asked, eyes concerned.</p><p> </p><p>“Nothing.” Harry shook his head. Alright, he shouldn’t dwell on things too much, or else Minerva will get even more worried about him. “Just thinking about my next lesson.” He gave the older woman a soft smile to reassure her.</p><p> </p><p>Blinking, the Gryffindor’s Head can only nod.</p><p> </p><p>Really, now, his back was really starting to ache. Maybe he should cut his last class of the day and head back to his own private room, so he can let his wings out. Sighing, Harry packed his notes up, holding them in his arms and made his way to his next DADA class to teach. As he made his way out of the Minerva’s office, the windows shook violently, before they exploded. Harry and Minerva didn’t have time to react, when someone grabbed Harry and flung him out the window.</p><p> </p><p>“Harry!”</p><p> </p><p>Eyes widening in horror, he could only stare up at a Death Eater mask that was right above him, as he was falling and falling. He could hear Minerva screaming and sending a Patronus to whoever it was.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>Something about Potter would make the perfect mate, his mind supplied. His black wings twitched in response, as if they were agreeing with his mind. Severus pinched the bridge of his nose, sighing in defeat.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>The boy was small.</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>And perfect.</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>The perfect One.</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Mate. Mate.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Severus growled in anger at his mind.</p><p> </p><p>Suddenly, Severus felt something breaching the castle. He could hear the screams of the castle—screaming in horror and for help. Snapping up from his seat, Severus was about to Apparate to the location that the castle supplied, when Minvera’s Patronus came bounding through the doors.</p><p> </p><p>“Severus! Death Eater! Attack on Harry!”</p><p> </p><p>Eyes widening in horror, Severus thought of beautiful green eyes.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Harry!</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Mate!</em>
</p><p> </p><p>He immediately Apparated to the grounds of the courtyard of the castle. He heard students screaming in horror, and when he turned around, the scene before him woke up the anger and something dark inside of him. Harry was laying on his front, struggling to get the Death Eater off his back. It looked as if Harry was locked in a spell to immobilize him.</p><p> </p><p>“How dare you kill our Dark Lord, Chosen One!” The Death Eater screamed. “I will end you now! I will rip your wings out from your back, so you can never use them again!” The Death Eater ripped down the back of Harry’s robes, before he used his wands and pointed over Harry’s back.</p><p> </p><p>And then…</p><p> </p><p>Severus saw <em>them</em>.</p><p> </p><p>Pure, <em>white</em> glowing wings springing from Harry’s pale back.</p><p> </p><p>Then, he heard something he would never, ever want to hear from anyone—least of all, from Harry. The boy screamed in horror; eyes glazed green eyes wide in fear.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>No!!! </em>Don’t touch them!” Harry yelled in despair. “<em>Don’t touch them! Don’t touch them! Don’t rip them out! Please!”</em> He cried brokenly, as the Death Eater gripped his small wings. Then, he looked up at Severus, eyes contacting his. The look in Harry’s screamed for him.</p><p> </p><p>And something dark and primal broke free from inside of him. Something that was waiting for so long. Ever since the Shrieking Shack.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Mate! Mate! Protect Mate! Mate is hurt! Protect!</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Protect!</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>PROTECTPROTECTPRO—<strong>KILL! KILL!</strong></em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>MATE IS HURT! <strong>KILL ENEMY!</strong></em>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <em> </em>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <em>KILL ALL!</em>
  </strong>
</p><p> </p><p>Wings flaring behind him, Severus let out a dark, deep primal growl; his vision turning red. Everything around him stilled, as Severus Disapparated and then, Apparated in front of Harry and the disgusting Death Eater. Whipping around, Severus slashed his wings on the Death Eater. Slicing the Death Eater, the Death Eater let out a muted hollow sound as blood seeped from his mouth with his chest being sliced open. Severus snapped around as his hand shot and took a hold of the bleeding Death Eater.</p><p> </p><p>“How <em>dare</em> you!” Severus howled in anger. “You will <em>die</em>, now!” Flaring his wings over Harry, blood dripped from the tips of the feathers, landing on Harry’s pure, white wings and pale skin and his face. Severus squeezed the Death Eater’s neck tightly, hearing the bones cracking.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>“Stupefy!”</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Severus felt the stung on his back. Hissing, he whipped around, still holding the Death Eater, as his red vision saw Minerva and other Professors. He threw the limp body away from him and kneeled down to his Mate. His Mate was crying hysterically. Beautiful green eyes leaking tears. Severus growled softly at his Mate, before he heard someone step up to him. He let out a warning growl, using his body and wings to shield his Mate. His Mate wrapped his arms around his waist, pressing his pale face into his chest. Severus wrapped his wings and arms around his Mate, still growling at the others before him.</p><p> </p><p>“Calm. Calm, Severus.” Minerva gently said, raising her hands up as well as dropping her wings low, as she shifted closer. She glanced down at his Mate, which resulted in him covering his Mate with his large black wings. “Is Harry okay?”</p><p> </p><p>Scooting back with his Mate, Severus let out another warning growl.</p><p> </p><p>Touch Mate, you will die!</p><p> </p><p>“…Hurts…It hurts…” His Mate muttered painfully, before his beautiful Mate cried out.</p><p> </p><p>Swinging his head back down to stare at his Mate, Severus let out a soothing purr, and before he could get a chance to react, he felt something come over his mind, knocking him out. And he heard his Mate crying in horror for him.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>“Severus! Mate!”</em>
