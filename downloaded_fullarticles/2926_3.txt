    <p>"Hey Remus, wake up."</p><p>"Sirius, please go back to bed!"</p><p>"Remus, it's important!"</p><p>       At these words, Remus Lupin shot out of bed. He hoped that Sirius was okay. Surely he wouldn't wake him up if it wasn't important, right? Sirius knew that Remus had stayed up until midnight to work on his Transfiguration essay. Remus was absolutely exhausted. For the past three days, he had been procrastinating writing this essay. Now, with the full moon only two days away, he was feeling absolutely horrible. Migraines were squeezing his brain and Remus felt more tired then he had ever been in his life.</p><p>       Luckily for him, Remus had the support of three amazing friends. They had learned of his lycanthropy at the end of their first year, and they perfected being animagi in their third year. Now, in their fifth year, the four boys were closer than ever. They were called The Marauders, and they were respected and feared among their peers. Their pranks were legendary, and nobody was safe. They never let anybody see their vulnerable side. Speaking of vulnerable, Remus was worried about Sirius. He looked up at Sirius, who was leaning over him. His eyes were wide, and Remus was starting to get very worried.</p><p>"Sirius? Are you alright?"</p><p>"Remus! Penguins are the only birds that can swim but not fly! Isn't that odd?"</p><p>"Sirius Black, I am going to best you in hand to hand combat."</p><p>       Remus was mentally groaning. If there was one thing that Sirius loved, it was to annoy him. It didn't matter how he did it. Sirius had hidden his chocolate stash, taken his favorite book, and shrunk his favorite sweater. Sirius absolutely loved to watch Remus get angry. Of course, Sirius always found a way to get back into his good graces. He would buy him chocolate at Hogsmeade, make his bed while Remus was brushing his teeth, and even carried him back from the Shrieking Shack on occasion. Even though they constantly bickered and annoyed each other, Remus and Sirius truly cared for each other.</p><p>    Sirius was quite happy with himself. Remus was doing that adorable thing where his nostrils flared when he was annoyed. His eyes were still sleepy, and he was blinking furiously. Sirius knew that Remus was exhausted, but he was selfish. He hardly got to see this side of Remus. Sirius absolutely loved this unguarded, sleepy side of Remus. He hardly ever got to see Remus like this. He was an early riser, always ready for class before Sirius had even thought about getting out of bed. The two boys were day and night, but they still got along quite well. Sirius firmly believed in the saying "opposites attract." </p><p>       Sirius was very attracted to Remus, that was for sure. He didn't know if it was his intelligence, his oversized sweaters, his gentle personality, or any of the other many qualities Remus had, but Sirius was gone from the beginning. He and Remus were always close, but Sirius hadn't realized until this year how much he actually noticed Remus. The boy was very lanky with long limbs. His eyes were an amazing brown color and were full of knowledge and wisdom. You could tell that he had seen things that no fifteen year old should see. Sirius knew that there was something special about Remus, even if Remus himself couldn't see it.</p><p>       Now, looking down upon Remus, Sirius studied him in the moonlight. A few freckles dusted his nose and his cheeks. His pale skin seemed to glow in the light of the moon. His brown hair, desperately in need of a cut, was messy and spread all around the pillow. A little bit of fringe hung down in his face and Sirius longed to reach his hand out and brush it back. Remus' eyes fluttered tiredly, but the annoyance in them was still clear.</p><p>"Sirius, I will not be able to stop thinking about that. That's so odd!"</p><p>"I know right!"</p><p>"Ugh. Sirius, please go back to bed so that I can try and get a little bit more sleep."</p><p>"Night Remus."</p><p>"Night Sirius."</p><p>       As Sirius walked back to his bed, he had a frown on his face. Telling Remus that thing about the penguins had not been his plan at all. He had something serious that he wanted to talk to Remus about. He knew that Remus would let him talk and not judge him, but he had chickened out at the last minute. Now, as he laid down in his bed, he could hear Remus beginning to snore. He would not be able to get back to sleep. Not after that horrible dream he had. Maybe someday he would work up the courage to finally talk to Remus. Not tonight though. Tonight he would let the werewolf sleep.</p>
