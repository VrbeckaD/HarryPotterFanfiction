  <strong>this takes place directly after Avengers. Some characters may seem OOC but I promise it will all make sense. Also this may go with out saying but as far as storyline goes HTTYD, ROTG, Wreck-It Ralph, Harry Potter Book/Movie 1 and onward are all clearly AU</strong>

    <u>Chapter One: A Final Chance</u>
  </strong>
</p>

<p>As the blue light faded Thor looked to the one he still considered a brother. “I am saddened that it has to be this way, Loki. You are to remain here ‘til father decides your punishment.”</p>
<p>Thor then removed the cuffs and muzzle and led the surprisingly silent trickster into a white room. There was little to be seen: a bed, small desk with a single chair and a plain door that led to a small bathroom, in reality it was just a fancy cell.</p>
<p>Loki sat on the edge of the bed and glared at Thor. The thunder god shook his head and touched a tiny symbol on the far wall. At once a pale golden glow encased the room.</p>
<p>“Consider yourself lucky your magic is still available. Yet know this force field prevents any and all means of escape,” Thor stated before leaving. Once alone Loki’s glare faded and he lowered his head into his hands.</p>
<p>Letting out a sigh, he picks his head up to show calculating green eyes, Loki used his magic to prepared letter, he nearly gagged at the sap inducing words. The letter glowed faintly before separating into four sections. With a wave of his hand the words were replaced with a simple and identical note. The illusion would make sure only when all four were in their rightful hands and together would the true letter be readable.</p>
<p>“Search them out, deliver my message.” Loki whispered as the glow around the notes increased before vanishing from his sight. “So it has come to this has it? Perhaps I should check on them. After all, it has been a long time.”</p>
<p>The raven haired god then lifted his right hand and another illusion faded into existence. It showed a tall man, in his left arm he held a small babe. Clutching his pants on the same side was a small toddler of two. Holding the man’s right hand was a child of four, the boy’s other hand held that of a six year old. The depiction of a perfect family.</p>
<p>Loki stared at it for a moment, giving a small scheming grin before lowering his hand, dispelling it. “I swear, we will be reunited. No one messes with what’s mine,” he vowed softly. One would think he was worried about these individuals, if not for the cold look in his eyes.</p>
<p>At that same moment the notes had found their targets. One in a small bag, another the pocket of a pullover hoodie, the third on top of a small dresser, and the fourth nestled in a small tattered blanket. Each on the very planet that the two princes had just left: Earth.</p>
