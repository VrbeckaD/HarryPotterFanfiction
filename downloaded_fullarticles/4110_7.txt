  <em>August 16, 1991</em>
</p><p>Charlie Weasley was running late. He had promised his best friend, Tonks, that he would meet her when she got off of work at a muggle coffee house. He noticed the patrons looked rather exotic for muggles as he entered the unfinished building filled with pub tables and a large bar with shiny copper equipment.</p><p>"Wotcher, Charlie! Over here!" Tonks shouted from a corner, her bright hair fitting in with the other patrons.</p><p>He meandered over to the table, and she pushed a cup towards him. "Hot Chocolate," she said with a smile.</p><p>Charlie ignored the drink and gave his friend a one-armed hug. "Gods, I missed you."</p><p>Tonks laughed. "Already, you've only been in Romania for two months." She hugged him back before leaning back to look at him. "How's the family?"</p><p>"Alright, Mum's a right mess. Her little Ronnikins is off to Hogwarts, and in a year there won't be any more little birds in the nest." Charlie said running his hand through his hair. "Finally, calmed her down enough to visit you." Tonks laughed, and Charlie pointed at her. "Don't laugh, the only way she agreed to me going to London today was by promising to bring you round for supper tonight. I still almost didn't make it, I think she might try binding me to the property if I'm not careful."</p><p>"Well, you are her ickle Charlie after all," Tonks said morphing into Molly Weasley for a moment and pinching his cheeks.</p><p>The burlier wizard playfully pushed her away. "If you keep morphing into my mother, she'll try to get you to marry me."</p><p>Tonks quirked an eyebrow. "I don't think I'd hold your interest."</p><p>"What is that supposed to mean?" Charlie asked as he sipped his drink.</p><p>"I'm not a dragon." Tonks teased making her hair spikier and changing her eyes. She took a long pull from her coffee. "Anyway, I asked you here for a reason. I think we need to be looking towards the future."</p><p>"Are you trying to make an honest wizard out of me, Tonks?" Charlie said innocently. "I might go for it, you know? Though I expect you to kneel down and that rock better be huge."</p><p>"You are going to have to do better than that to fluster me, Weasley. I just got done training with a man that hexed me 67 times today," she morphed her face into that of Alastor Moody. "For yer' own good, lass. Constant Vigilance, Nymphadora. Pretty Aurors aren't a long-lived bunch." She changed back as Charlie stopped laughing and wiped the tears from his eyes. "He brought up a good point though. I want you to come with me while I set up my will."</p><p>

</p><p>Atticus Scamander sat at his desk in his shirtsleeves and trousers, his robes thrown over one of the reception chairs. He tried to blow his thinning blond fringe out of his eyes; it was currently too long stay in place and too short to stay tucked in his braid. He stroked his neatly trimmed Van Dyke and picked up a note attached to a tin of biscuits.</p><p>
  <em>Thank you for your help. I will keep you posted if any new developments arise. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Behave yourself, </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Bunny</em>
</p><p>
  <em>P.S. Please find cookies enclosed, Mom and Trixie have been stress baking. </em>
</p><p><em> </em>Atticus opened the tin and looked inside. “It looks like Aunt Queenie and Trixie have outdone themselves again.” He said to himself before summoning the tea service.</p><p>Atticus Scamander had been an active partner in Bones, Scamander, and Tonks for almost a decade. The practice was thriving, and his work was made more fulfilling in having the opportunity to partner with his childhood friend, Edward Tonks.</p><p>His parents, Newt and Tina Scamander, were proud of his accomplishments. His parents wanted the best for him and often asked if he was seeing anyone.</p><p>Atticus wasn’t on the market though, it had been almost five years, and he felt like he had better things to do with his life than chase after romantic entanglements. He had important things that needed his attention, including reversing the biggest action of the International Statue of Secrecy that had ever been issued on an individual.</p><p>Despite being uninterested, he acknowledged that conversations generally centered around the topic of dating and mating. And it wasn't like he was a leper. He was relatively attractive in the right light in a bookish old-fashioned sort of way. In fact, three of his boyfriends, often accused him of being charming and debonaire. Of course, the fourth had accused him of being a blood-traitor poofter with the personality and sex drive of a flobberworm but that bastard was a poncy falandering git anyway.</p><p>Atticus chuckled to himself. He scanned the biscuit tin and pulled out his favorite. He poured and fixed his tea, and dunked his biscuit. He looked up from selecting a second sweet as he heard arguing coming from the corridor.</p><p>“Nymphadora, I don’t think this is a good idea. I mean we aren’t even twenty yet, why do we need wills? Ouch!” A man’s voice said.</p><p>“Oi', don’t call me Nymphadora. And it is a brilliant idea, the last thing your Mum needs is to worry over how she is going to pay for funeral services when the Reserve notifies her that you’ve been eaten up by some dragon.” A girl hissed.</p><p>A moment later a knock sounded on the door. Atticus swallowed his bite of biscuit. “Who is it?” He called out, and the door pushed open to reveal a shock of violet hair on a pixieish witch.</p><p>“Wotcher, Atti. Do you have a minute?” A young woman in Auror robes asked.</p><p> “Hello, Dora.” He replied with a smile. “I am afraid your Dad is off with your Mum on a..” He shifted uncomfortably, “long lunch break. You might not want to go home right now.”</p><p>“That is convenient then because we wanted to talk to you.” The young witch walked in dragging a slightly taller and barrel-chested red headed man.</p><p>“Dora, this is unnecessary. I’m sure the Reserve will take care of things if something happens.” The man hissed.</p><p>“Shut it, Charlie!” Dora growled before smiling sweetly at her Dad’s law partner. “Atti, Charlie and I,” she indicated herself and the red head that was currently staring at him. “We are both going into dangerous careers, and we were wondering if you could help us each set up a will and a trust. If something were to happen…” She stopped as her voice cracked.</p><p>Atticus stood up and crossed to Dora. He had known her most of her life, so it didn't surprise him when she rested her head on his shoulder as he wrapped her in a hug. “Listen, poppet. You are doing the right thing. It never hurts to be pro-active.” He squeezed her shoulders. “Best case, you can have a good laugh about who you left your hot plate and collection of chocolate frog cards to when you were 18.”</p><p>Dora laughed and playfully pushed him away. “You always know what to say.”</p><p>“Must be how I can get away with charging clients 50 galleons an hour,” Atticus said with a wink.</p><p>The young man, Charlie, started pulling Dora towards the door. “We are sorry for taking up your time, Sir.”</p><p>Atticus chuckled. “Don’t worry, lad. Friends and family are free,” he pretended to cover his mouth and stage whispered. “Otherwise our offices would be much nicer. Please have a seat.” He motioned towards the guest chairs and moved his dress robes.</p><p>Charlie and Dora sat across from his desk, and Atticus sat on the corner of the monstrosity. “So let's start with basics, my name is Atticus, and what I can do for you is draw up three documents, a living will, a last will and testament, and a trust. Now, I’ve known Dora since she was a babe but I am afraid we haven’t been introduced.” He stood and extended his hand to Charlie.</p><p>“Sorry, Charles Weasley.” The man mumbled before shaking Atticus's hand. An action he held for too long as he stared at their joined hands. Atticus gave him a bemused look and gently broke the handshake.</p><p>“Right then,” Atticus said trying to lessen the awkward tension. “So Dora and Mr. Weasley, what I need from you are a list of your possessions, a list of any land you might own, your Gringotts account information, and a person or a list of people you would like to execute your wishes in the case of something happening. This person will need to be notified that the will is in place and that they will be in charge of executing it if something happens. Now usually for people your age a parent is set..”</p><p>Charlie jumped up. “My parents can’t know about this! I barely just talked my Mum around to…”</p><p>Atticus stood up and helped Charlie back into his seat. “Charlie, can I call you, Charlie?” The man nodded the tips of his ears coloring slightly. “Charlie, it doesn’t have to be your parents. It can be anyone of age that you trust, in fact, I would recommend you each do a list naming each other as a possible executor plus two other people. That way if you have a falling out with someone, you can just strike their name from the list, and you will not have to worry about finding a replacement or upsetting your dear old mum.” The counselor gave a reassuring smile to the young man. <em>He's a bit shy, but I'm sure he has a bright future ahead of him. I'm glad Dora has him, she deserves good friends.</em> He thought cheerfully before being interrupted by the very same witch.</p><p>Dora raised her hand to get the older wizard’s attention. “Yes, Dora,” Atticus said turning to her.</p><p>“Not to change the subject, but those wouldn’t happen to be Christmas biscuits? Like the ones you bring over on Christmas Eve?” Dora was sitting up very straight trying to see into the tin. Almost on cue Charlie’s stomach grumbled causing Atticus to laugh and Charlie to turn a unique shade of red.</p><p>The older wizard smiled. “Well, it isn’t Christmas, but they are biscuits.” He passed the tin over to her.</p><p>“Oi,’ I haven’t seen any of these before. What’s this one?” She held up a heart-shaped biscuit.</p><p>“That would be a shortbread heart with blackberries. They are my favorite so leave me at least one.” He said with a smile and then pointed to the dome-shaped biscuit she had pulled out. “That would be a chocolate rugelach. There are two other kinds of shortbread, some date pinwheels, some molasses cookies, and some plum and apricot hamantaschen as well. Please take as much as you like, I was just going to share the leftovers with my friend, Jacob, this weekend.”</p><p>Charlie was gazing intently at Dora and the tin of biscuits. Dora caught his eye and then looked at Atticus sheepishly as if remembering what her mother would say in this situation. She daintily took a biscuit. Atticus shook his head. “If you are going to ask about the biscuit tin and then request biscuits, you better finish the job properly.” He summoned two plates and overfilled them with sweets. He then handed them to his guests. “You are both just starting out. You are supposed to take advantage of the free food thrust upon you by your parent's friends. That is how this works.”</p><p>The young Auror let out a giggle and took the plate. Accepting Atticus’s little speech as permission to enjoy eating, Dora inhaled a piece of rugelach. “Oh my god, these are amazing.”</p><p>Charlie took the plate Atticus offered him and blushed slightly at the kindness. Timidly, he took a bite of a molasses cookie and gave the barrister a brilliant smile. “Thank you.”</p><p>Atticus smiled back. "You are quite welcome young man. Any friend of Dora's is a friend of mine, we are family afterall."</p><p>The young Auror squealed at this. "Does that mean I can call you Uncle Atti?"</p><p>"You used to, Nymphadora." He said with a smirk as the young witch's hair flared red.</p><p>_____________________________________</p><p><em> </em>Charlie walked into the Burrow with Tonks. He was dazed and holding two plates of biscuits. He walked into the kitchen and set the plates on the table. He felt slightly guilty that he and Tonks hadn't left any of their favorites on the plates. He had two molasses cookies burning a hole in his pocket but they had been...magical. <em>Could biscuits be magical? My mother is the best cook I know, better than any house-elf and I am hording biscuits from an old bachelor's care package.</em> He thought.</p><p>Tonks looked around the kitchen and dining room. "It looks like everyone is in the back garden." She hopped up on the table in a small act of rebellion. "Seems like it is just us, hippogriffs." She said with a bemused look. "You ok, Charlie? You've been awfully quiet. You looked like you were afraid Atti was going to eat you." She let out a light laugh. "I know lawyers have a scary reputation, but they don't have anything on dragons."</p><p>He looked at her intently for a moment. "I wasn't expecting that." He grumbled and went about making tea.</p><p>Tonks pulled a shortbread heart from her pocket and broke it in half handing him one side. "What were you expecting?" She asked causing him to blush. Tonks stared at him in disbelief. "Oh come off it, Charlie, it was just Atti."</p><p>"You said he was one of your Dad's friends. You never mentioned he was charming or handsome. He is just so...so..." Charlie frowned as he was at a loss for words.</p><p>"Were we meeting with the same wizard? Did you Portkey out with a time-turner when I wasn't looking?" She teased. "It's Atti. He's not handsome, an adorable sweetheart definately, but he's just a regular bloke. He rides a muggle bicycle to work and hikes on the weekend. He grabs a pint with my Dad, when they think my Mum doesn't know. He plays golf with my Dad and his muggle friend, Jacob, just so he can see how far he push the limits of appropriate muggle attire."</p><p>Charlie pouted. "He wasn't what I was expecting, I've never met anyone like him before. You should have warned me."</p><p>"Warned you? Warned you about what? That he makes bad jokes and is good at his job. Or that Scamanders are as worse about feeding people than Weasleys?" Tonks took a bite of shortbread. "Not that I am complaining, I have eaten my fair share of Atti's care packages. Once Mrs. Scamander sent him an apple struddel when my Mum was away at a conference. Don't tell her, but Dad, Atti, and I had struddel and ice cream for dinner two nights in a row."</p><p>Charlie stared at her dumbfounded. "Scamander? As in Newt Scamander?"</p><p>Tonks looked at her friend as if he had gone mad. "Yeah, he's Atti's Dad. Come on Charlie, the name of the firm is Bones, Scamander, and Tonks."</p><p>"On top of everything else, he's a Scamander? The son of my childhood hero?" Charlie said as he dropped the half biscuit Tonks had handed him and scrubbed his face with his hand. "And you let me just blush and stammer in front of him like a lovesick school boy? What must he think of me? Fuck!" He heard a femine gasp. He turned and paled as he saw Ginny staring at him wide-eyed.</p><p>"Charlie!" Ginny admonished. "Mum said we are never to use that word."</p><p>The second oldest Weasley boy forced a smile and scooped up the youngest Weasley in his arms. "How much for your silence?" He asked showing her the biscuits on the table.</p><p>"First pick and one of the one's you're keeping in your pocket." The little girl said with an impish grin.</p><p>He relunctantly handed her a molasses cookie. "Not a word of this to anyone." He said holding out his pinkie.</p>
