    <p>
  <span>Diggle stared up at the two men who had taken Deadshot down, the two vigilantes that had made the police force of Starling City so busy. And had started to take down the most corrupt men and women of the city. One was his recent boss, Oliver Queen, and the other, the man who had come back with Queen, Harry Potter.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The two men looked very different than they had looked this morning, when Diggle had driven Oliver to the building and tower that housed Queen Industries. Oliver had been hungover or... not. He supposed this was where both of them were going at night, expertly avoiding Diggle’s sight and hearing. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The Hood. The Devil. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The two were clearly making a ruckus in Starling City, taking down criminals as a team. And now, they had saved his life.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Their hoods were down, the material hanging loosely at their backs. Oliver’s bow had been put down in the haste to grind up whatever it was that had Diggle’s life. Harry’s eyes were glowing slightly red and Diggle watched as the man took visible deep breaths, calming down. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He looked around himself more now, taking in the one computer on the table and the arrow rack on the other table. There was an old looking trunk on other side, a trunk that looked familiar to him the more he looked at it. He had helped Oliver to bring it into the mansion when Queen had first gotten home from the hospital.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Now everything made sense. Queen being too aware of the exits of each room they were in, the way he moved, the way he wouldn’t talk about what happened to him on the island. It was like Oliver had undergone a huge behavior change while on the island and Diggle had seen through it at least a little. But to see him now… No one would guess that Oliver Queen, the self-proclaimed party boy, millionaire, and the guy who liked to bring home girls every night, was the Hood.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Oliver Queen stood very still as he leaned against the table where the computer was, like a predator sizing up prey. Harry stood next to him but he was a lot more relaxed, his shoulders loose and his eyes back to their normal green. Diggle shivered at the memory of seeing the guy in action just a few hours before, seeing the man’s eyes fully glow red. Seeing the man’s red power whip about the assassin called Deadshot, trying to bring him down. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>There was nothing human about that.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You alright, Diggle?” Harry finally questioned, raising an eyebrow. “I think Oliver got the cure to you in time.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Diggle stared at the two of them, his eyes still wide in disbelief. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I would have helped you with the pain but most people are scared of me, the first time around,” Harry offered, shrugging a little. “Oliver was, if that helps.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Oliver tipped his head towards Harry, his eyes narrowing. Harry grinned and then turned around, typing something into the computer while Oliver continued to stare at Diggle.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You clearly don’t need a bodyguard,” Diggle finally said. “You’re a murderer. You two are the vigilantes.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Diggle-”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No, you two murder people! Why’d you bring me down here anyway? All you’ve been doing is killing people!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I thought…”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“We thought,” Harry corrected, reaching out to put a hand on Oliver’s shoulder. Oliver’s eyes closed briefly and Diggle could swear he leaned into the touch. Diggle’s eyes narrowed at the touch, filed that information away for later. Oliver and Harry might have been closer than he had originally seen. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“We thought you might like to--”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Might like to what? Join you? You kill people!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“For the good of the city,” Oliver argued in a calm voice, at equal volume. He wasn’t even raising his voice, wasn’t shouting. He really thought… </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Diggle’s heart sped up, his hand dropping to the gun holster at his hip. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m just with him to watch his back,” Harry offered quietly. “It would be nice to have another person on the team.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No. No, I’m not joining you.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Diggle took a step back, still clutching his side as it was still sore from where the assassin shot at him. He hastened up the stairs, out of Queen’s and Potter’s lair and walked out of the abandoned warehouse.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Diggle was not that surprised to see Queen and Potter coming into the diner a few nights afterward. Carly was waiting on a table next to his and walked over to stand by his table to say hi to the two men. Diggle could see Oliver’s new bodyguard behind him and his lips twitched up into a small grin when he saw the harried look on his face. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Hello, Diggle’s sister-in-law Carly,” Oliver remarked, holding out his hand. “I’m Oliver Queen.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I know who you are, both of you,” Carly said with a glance to Potter.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Carly shook Oliver’s hand while Diggle watched as Harry sat down in the bench opposite his, his green eyes looking the menu over. “It’s nice to meet you, Carly.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Oliver sat down next to Harry and Diggle watched as Harry rattled off an order. Carly nodded in answer and took off to get the order made.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You’re not eating?” Diggle questioned, turning to look at Oliver.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“He’s eating,” Harry remarked, shrugging and his eyes narrowing. “If I have anything to say about it.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Oliver looked at Harry and some thought was exchanged between them, something that Diggle didn’t have any hope of identifying. Oliver finally nodded and turned back to face Diggle. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The next morning, Diggle sat down on his couch and turned on the tv, tuning to some random news channel while eating some breakfast. The two vigilantes were all over the news lately and no one had seen their like before. The archer and the guy who looked like the devil come alive.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Oliver Queen and Harry Potter. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Oliver all outfitted in green, green hood, green suit and green fletching on his arrows. Harry all outfitted in red and black, a mask that covered most of his face and defining features like the scar on his forehead. Though all the police had was two sketchings of the two men, an arrow, and nothing else.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The crime rate of Starling City had already gone down so much, with their presence and Diggle hadn’t seen their like before. He wondered what Harry was, who he was and if he actually was a demon, like people were calling him. He hadn’t seen Harry be upset about the name that the news had started to call him. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Maybe… No. They killed people. But then again… Diggle sighed and shook his head. He had long been looking for a… purpose in life after leaving military and protecting rich assholes wasn’t cutting it. Perhaps joining Oliver and Harry would be it.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p>
<p>
  <span>A maid showed Diggle to where Oliver was in the Queen mansion, leaving him in the doorway of the living room. The sun shone through the floor to ceiling windows opposite him and shone on the two men embracing right in front of them. Harry had his arms wrapped around Oliver, one around his back and one at his neck. Oliver meanwhile had his arms around Harry, a white knuckled grip, as far as Diggle could see. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The two were so close that Diggle couldn’t see any space between them, no open air, as they kissed. Diggle cleared his throat, turning around to give them privacy as they straightened up. He snorted at the thought as Oliver and Harry were not at all straight. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>So they were closer than he had first thought. He didn’t remember seeing or reading in the news and gossip magazines about Queen being bisexual. It was all girls but he figured that Oliver and perhaps Moira Queen would have probably kept that quiet. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You here for the bodyguard position?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Diggle turned back around, seeing Oliver and Harry turn around too. They looked at him with expectant eyes, Harry with loose shoulders and a relaxed stance while Oliver was more rigid. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“‘Cause the new guy just quit,” Oliver finished, his lips twitching up into a small grin.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry elbowed Oliver, amusement in his eyes. “That’s because you scared him off.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I did not,” Oliver retorted, shrugging and turning to Harry.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes, you did.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Did not. Some people just don’t have the stamina anymore.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry rolled his eyes and raised an eyebrow. “Dig?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes, I came to join you two.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Not the bodyguard position?” Harry questioned, sparing a glance at Oliver before turning back to Diggle. “Neither of us really…”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Not the bodyguard position. The other one.”</span>
</p>
