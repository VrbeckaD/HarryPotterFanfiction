    <p>“James?! Is that you?!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>The curly-haired man turned around, to see a figure in blue running towards him.</p><p> </p><p>“(Y/N)!” he yelled in surprise.</p><p> </p><p>He closed the remaining distance between them, opening his arms for her incoming embrace.</p><p> </p><p>“I can’t believe you’re here!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>James could feel her excitement through her tight hug. They stayed in each other’s arms for a second; it was a much welcome warmth compared to the brisk New York City weather.</p><p> </p><p>“How have you been, love?” He asked, seemingly reluctant of letting go when he felt her arms retreat.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m doing well! It was hard at first, but I’m adjusting to the new environment.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Well, it seems you’re adjusting too well. I almost didn’t recognize you. You don’t even sound British anymore! They’ve converted you into a Yankee!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“How dare you, Potter!” she exclaimed, with faux anger. “I am very much British. I still drink tea, instead of that horrid coffee, and my accent is perfectly British!” she argued, with a big grin.</p><p> </p><p>James laughed. “Just jesting, love. You know riling you up was my favorite part of the day.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah right, Potter.” (Y/N) scoffed. “I remember you would always come bother me only after you were told off by Lily.” she reminded him, not realizing the slight falter in his smile. “How is she by the way?” She looked around trying to find a redhead nearby. “Is she here with you?”</p><p> </p><p>“No, she’s not here. We’re not on speaking terms right now.” He avoided her concerned eyes, choosing to look at her scarf instead. “Or I guess I’m not on speaking terms with her at the moment.”</p><p> </p><p>“What happened?” she asked, slowly reaching for him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>He stared for a moment at their hands, watching as (Y/N)’s small gloved hands gently squeezed his.</p><p> </p><p>“She told me she thought of me as a brother, nothing more than a good friend. That we would annoy each other to death with how different we are in the long run.” His brows furrowed at the memory of the words. “All this time, I thought I had a chance once I won her over as a friend. And that she didn’t see me as the annoying twat I was back in Hogwarts. I never thought she would see me as a brother of all things.”</p><p> </p><p>“James, I’m so sorry.” She squeezed his hands again, making him look up. “I didn’t know.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Anyways,” James spoke, with a sudden forced smile that didn’t go unnoticed by (Y/N), “what are you doing tonight? We should celebrate our fated meeting!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>(Y/N) decided to go along with his sudden change in mood, knowing he didn’t want to dwell on a certain redhead.</p><p> </p><p>“I actually was on my way to the market, to buy ingredients for dinner.”</p><p> </p><p>“You? Making dinner?” he said, with an amused grin.</p><p> </p><p>When she rolled her eyes at his teasing question and responded with a nod, he burst out in genuine laughter. He paid no heed to the pointed glare from (Y/N) as he gained the attention of confused wizards nearby. There was no trace of the heartbreak on his face that was there just seconds ago.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry,” he breathed, wiping away a tear from his cackling. “It’s just that, I remember you swore you’d never to cook again after almost blowing up the Hogwarts kitchens making biscuits. You were banned from any kitchen since then.”</p><p> </p><p>“And I remember you agreeing never to bring up that incident again, after I threatened to introduce my knee to Potter Jr.” she said with a not-so-amused smile.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, leave Potter Jr. out of this.” he argued, before adding. “Also, I told you to stop calling my penis Potter Jr. The lads still make fun of me for that nickname.”</p><p> </p><p>“How about Potter mini then? It’s descriptive and informative.” (Y/N) teased, while walking away from James and towards the market.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey! Nothing about Potter Jr. is mini!” James pouted.</p><p> </p><p>“So then, Potter Jr. it is then!” she cackled, racing off in the direction of the market before he could stop her.</p><p> </p><p>James chased after her. “Wait, come back! I’m open to other suggestions!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
