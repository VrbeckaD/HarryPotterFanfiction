    <p>Harry hated potions. As he sat in front of a steaming cauldron, brewing an age reduction potion, all he could think of was how much he hated potions. Snape's sneering face appeared above Harry cauldron.<br/>
"Careful Potter." Snape spat, grabbing the jar of Leech juice Harry was about to dump in his cauldron. "It's Dragon blood, not Leech juice. Five points from Gryffindor." Snape swept off to taunt Neville Longbottom about his potion. Harry growled at Snape's back grabbing the Dragon blood and adding it to his cauldron. Still angry, Harry continued on his potion, carelessly throwing ingredients into it. Snape looked over just as Harry throw a whole Erumpent horn into his cauldron.<br/>
"Potter, NO!!!!" Snape shouted diving for cauldron as everyone else took cover. There was a great explosion and when the smoke cleared all the students came out.<br/>
"Where is Professor Snape?" Asked Pansy Parkinson, looking for the Potions Master. Harry peered over what was left of his desk. All he saw was a pile of black robes. He was about to panic when the robes moved and a six-month-old Snape crawled out dress in only a nappy. Harry jumped back and gave a straggled half scream.<br/>
"What's wrong Harry?" Hermione Granger asked looking over the smothering rubble and gasping.<br/>
"POTTER! WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?" Draco Malfoy screamed causing baby Snape to start to cry.<br/>
"Now look what you've done Malfoy." Hermione scolded Draco picking baby Snape up from the floor and shushing him.<br/>
"I didn't mean to make him cry Granger, I'm just not used to seeing my Godfather as a baby. Now give him to me you filthy Mudblood before you drop him." Draco hissed, snatching Snape from Hermione.<br/>
"I didn't know Snape was your Godfather." Blaise Zabini commented following Draco from the classroom.<br/>
"Not many do." Draco responded leading Blaise and Pansy from the dungeons.<br/>
"Hey, Malfoy." Ron Weasley screamed after him. "Where do you think you're going?" Draco turned on the Gryffindor, glaring.<br/>
"To the Headmaster's office, Weasel." Draco spoke in a calm voice as not to disturb the baby in his arms. He turned and continued on his way.<br/>
"We better go too." Harry told Ron and Hermione. "We don't want him making up stories." He explained as he ran off to catch up with the Slytherins. As soon as the six students made it to the gargoyle that guarded the office it jumped aside to reveal a moving spiral staircase. The Slytherins hesitated before climbing on and riding to the top. When they reached the door Pansy knocked.<br/>
"Enter." Dumbledore said from the other side and Blaise opened the door for everyone.<br/>
"What may I do for you, Mr. Malfoy?" Dumbledore asked before looking up and realizing Draco wasn't alone. As soon as Dumbledore spotted baby Snape and the Gryffindors, he stood and came around his desk.<br/>
"What do we have here?" Asked Dumbledore taking the baby from Draco and gently bouncing him in his arms.<br/>
"Potter turned Professor Snape into a baby sir" Pansy informed Dumbledore.<br/>
"I didn't do it on purposes." Harry stated, "I don't even know why my potion exploded sir. I would never do that to Snape."<br/>
"Professor Snape Harry." Dumbledore corrected, "I am sure this was an accident. Miss Granger could you fetch Professor McGonagall for me. Miss Parkinson could you fetch Madam Pomfrey. Thank you, ladies." Dumbledore dismissed the girls. "Would you gentlemen please have a seat." Dumbledore motioned to the four chairs in front of his desk before sitting back behind it. He placed baby Snape on his lap before flicking his wand and dressing Snape in black footed pajamas. Just as the boys settled the girls returned with McGonagall and Pomfrey.<br/>
"Ah, Poppy, Minerva, it seems we have had a bit of a potion accident." Dumbledore stated, motioned to baby Snape who was now playing with Dumbledore's beard.<br/>
"Oh, my," Pomfrey exclaimed, "Who is the unlucky student?" She asked not realizing the baby was Snape.<br/>
"I believe the one who had the accident was Mr. Potter but the child I am holding in Severus." Dumbledore politely answered.<br/>
"Mr. Potter is this true?" Asked McGonagall.<br/>
"Yes Professor but I didn't mean to. The potion was fine, then Snape shouted and dove for my cauldron. Next thing I knew the smoke was clearing and Snape was a baby." Harry explained looking sad.<br/>
"Professor Snape Harry." Dumbledore corrected again. "Did anyone else see what happened?"<br/>
"I think I saw Harry add the Bicorn horn whole but that wouldn't make the potion explode." Hermione answered. Draco had a piece of parchment out and was sketching away at it with a pencil. When he was done he approached Harry.<br/>
"Which horn did you add Potter?" Draco demanded, shoving the parchment at Harry. He grabbed it and saw two drawings. The first was a straight horn with a spiraling ridge on it. The second was a spiral horn. Harry frowned as he pointed to the first horn knowing it didn't look right. Everyone in the room gasped.<br/>
"But how did an Erumpent horn make into a classroom?" Hermione asked in her know-it-all's voice, "They are highly dangerous as they contain Exploding fluid. As such the Ministry has classified them as a Class B Tradeable Material. We would never work with such things in class. Someone must have slipped it in and switched it with Harry's Bicorn horn." Hermione stated.<br/>
"Thank you, Miss Granger." Dumbledore told Hermione. "Well, it would seem that someone wishes our young Mr. Potter harm. We shall look into this. In the meantime, I will contact Professor Slughorn and ask if he will fill in for Professor Snape until he can resume his classes. Poppy could you go down to the potion classroom and make sure nobody else has been harmed. Thank you. Minerva, could you please escort the students to the teacher's lounge until I can continue with this. And take Severus with you, my dear. Dobby the House-elf can watch him while you finish your classes. Just leave him in the lounge too. Thank you, dear." Dumbledore dismissed them handing baby Snape to McGonagall. She led them from the office and down to the teacher's lounge. With a wave of her wand the door opened. McGonagall motioned them in before herself.<br/>
"Now I have to get back to my class before it ends." McGonagall started handing baby Snape off to Dobby. "I expect you all to behave until Professor Dumbledore come for you." She said giving them all a stern look before heading out. As soon as the door closed Harry collapsed onto the nearest couch.<br/>
"Are you well Harry Potter, sir?" Asked Dobby.<br/>
"I'm fine Dobby, just had a rough day." Harry responded.<br/>
"Why are you talking to it, Potter?" Sneered Draco.<br/>
"Because he is my friend Malfoy." Harry returned Draco's tone.<br/>
"It is nothing but a servant Potter."<br/>
"Dobby is no servant, Dobby is a free elf. Mr. Harry Potter sir freed Dobby from you and your dreadful father. DOBBY IS A FREE ELF!" Dobby was crying by the end yelling at the boy that made his life hell not too long ago. This upset baby Snape who started crying.<br/>
"Now look what you've done Malfoy." Harry hissed pulling both the crying house-elf and baby on to his lap and quieting both.<br/>
"Dobby is sorry Harry Potter sir." Dobby sniffed, pulling a tissue from inside one of his socks and blowing his nose.<br/>
"It's OK Dobby, I know you didn't mean to." Harry said still rocking baby Snape in his arms. It didn't take long for both Dobby and baby Snape to calm down. Harry smiled and quietly chatted with his friends.</p>
