Once or twice was enough, but it was all in vain<br/>
Time starts to pass, before you know it, you're frozen<br/>
But something happened, for the very first time with you<br/>
My heart melts into the ground, found something true<br/>

You cut me open and I---"</p>

    <strong>Prologue</strong>
  </p><p align="left"></p><p align="left">
    <span>The repairment of Hogwarts began from the courtyard. Some thought it was symbolic; others thought that it was the most damaged part of the castle. Whoever thought what, they all seem to catch themselves from staring at the spot where </span>
    <em>
      <span>everything </span>
    </em>
    <span>ended. They would sigh to themselves, relieved and pained at the same time, turn back to their own designated jobs. Everyone chose to help fix the school whereas three students chose to clear up the docking shed. </span>
  </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">
    <span>The Golden Trio, penned by the </span>
    <em>
      <span>The  Daily Prophet, </span>
    </em>
    <span>had chosen this exact spot for a specific reason. </span>
    <span>Headmaster</span>
    <span> Professor Severus Snape died at this place after being killed by one of his masters, Voldemort. He was a dour man, held together by secrets and grudges, but yet had a heart strong enough to be loyal to two masters. How many lies that man had to tell to keep everyone alive? How many deaths he had to see to keep up the facade of a cold-blooded killer? How could be so emotionless after killing Dumbledore even though---as everyone found out---the old man ordered him to do it? </span>
  </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">
    <span>And what did he get in return after all his sacrifice? </span>
    <em>
      <span>Nothing. </span>
    </em>
    <span>He got something after he died: posthumous Order of Merlin First Class award but that didn't mean anything if the person is dead! Knowing Snape, if he was alive, he wouldn't even accept the award. </span>
  </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">
    <span>He deserved <em>something better</em> but they didn't know <em>what</em>. </span>
  </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">
    <span>As she cleared up the blood splatter on the wooden walls of the shed, Hermione Granger wiped tears from her cheeks. No matter how many times she swiped or freshened up her face, tears kept on rolling. She tried to hide it from the two boys who avoided a certain area but they knew. </span>
  </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">
    <span>Harry had finally shown what the memory was about after everything settled down. As if the missing puzzle pieces settled down in its rightful places, everything started to make sense to Hermione. Why everywhere they were in trouble, he was there. He was not there to sabotage them, he was there to protect them without giving himself away. </span>
  </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">
    <em>
      <span>What misunderstood guy</span>
    </em>
    <span>, Hermione thought, and she turned around to face the spot where the professor had died. </span>
    <em>
      <span>To have both Dumbledore and Voldemort control your life</span>
    </em>
    <span>. </span>
  </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">
    <span>Hermione was sure that if Professor Snape had survived, he wouldn't want to do anything with the medal. It would be a slap to his face or that's what Hermione thought so. Or do, if she was in Professor’s shoes. </span>
    <em>
      <span>I would go live in a remote area after the whole ordeal, </span>
    </em>
    <span>Hermione mused. He would probably hate people fretting over him, him being so shut off from the people around him. </span>
  </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">
    <span>Harry has convinced McGonagall to bury Severus Snape at Godric’s Hollow, right next his mom. Some people who was not aware of the true nature of the professor was scandalized by this gesture but Harry, Hermione, and Ron cleared his name through a press conference, having the acting Minister of Magic Kingsley Shacklebot view the memory in front of Wizengamot members and press. To say people were in shock was an understatement. The next day the profit of the </span>
    <em>
      <span>Daily Prophet</span>
    </em>
    <span> skyrocketed to an all time high, surpassing the record when they release the return of the Dark Lord during the end of fifth year. </span>
  </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">
    <span>“Hogwarts is not going to be the same anymore." Ron stated, wiping the sweat from his forehead. Harry placed his hand on the redhead’s shoulder. </span>
  </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">
    <span>“No, it’s not.” Harry agreed, looking up at the castle, his hair slicked to his forehead by sweat. His nose was covered with rubble dust, his green eyes bright against his tanned skin. He glanced at Hermione and Ron then smiled. </span>
