    <p><b>Fandom:</b> Eureka<br/>
<b>Character(s):</b> Jack Carter, Nathan Stark</p><p>
  <b>Table angst/hurt/comfort</b>
</p><p><b>Prompt:</b> bullying<br/>
<b>Rating(s):</b> PG </p><p><b>Sentence:</b><br/>
Jack could not abide by bullying, not from children and certainly not from adults who should know better, so he put Nathan on notice to mend his ways, or answer to him.</p><p>-------</p><p><b>Prompt:</b> tears<br/>
<b>Rating(s):</b> PG </p><p><b>Sentence:</b><br/>
Jack waited until Zoe's sobs had softened before wiping away her tears and kissing her forehead, wondering who would comfort him if ever he broke up with his secret boyfriend.</p><p>-------</p><p><b>Prompt:</b> hospital<br/>
<b>Rating(s):</b> PG </p><p><b>Sentence:</b><br/>
"Slow down, Jack," Nathan ordered as they raced to the hospital after hearing of Zoe's accident because she was going to be fine, and he didn't want either of them to end up as patients too.</p><p>-------</p><p><b>Prompt:</b> caring<br/>
<b>Rating(s):</b> PG slash</p><p><b>Sentence:</b><br/>
Nathan spent too many years not caring about the Sheriff, Jack Carter, and now at the last moment of his life while standing in the time chamber waiting to reset the photon, he knew he cared too much.</p><p>-------</p><p><b>Prompt:</b> tissue<br/>
<b>Rating(s):</b> PG </p><p><b>Sentence:</b><br/>
Nathan understood the fragility of the human body, made of tissue and bone, and knew Jack was hurt far worse than he let on when he fell into the crater caused by Fargo's latest blunder, so perhaps it was fortunate Nathan was also a medical doctor.</p><p>-------</p><p><b>Prompt:</b> desperation<br/>
<b>Rating(s):</b> PG slash</p><p><b>Sentence:</b><br/>
Jack could see the desperation in Nathan's eyes, knowing how much it must have cost the proud man to admit to being wrong, but Jack was still determined to make him wait another day before forgiving him for kissing Allison when he should have been kissing him.</p><p>-------</p><p><b>Prompt:</b> alone<br/>
<b>Rating(s):</b> PG slash</p><p><b>Sentence:</b><br/>
Nathan never truly knew what it was like to be alone until he felt his body slowly delete from time, leaving his mind or soul wandering the universe, and he never knew what it was like to feel completely alive until he was brought back and held in Jack's strong arms.</p><p>-------</p><p><b>Prompt:</b> help<br/>
<b>Rating(s):</b> PG </p><p><b>Sentence:</b><br/>
Jack sighed as he glanced around another destroyed laboratory, seeing the tension in Nathan as he berated the errant scientist, but as much as Jack would have liked to stick around just to say, 'I told you', he could see the clean-up crew approaching and he didn't want to get roped in to help.</p><p>-------</p><p><b>Prompt:</b> hug<br/>
<b>Rating(s):</b> PG slash</p><p><b>Sentence:</b><br/>
They say a hug is worth a thousand words, and that was never truer than in a town where most of the people spoke in technical jargon far above his understanding, so Jack accepted the hug from Nathan after helping to bring him back from oblivion without saying a word.</p><p>-------</p><p><b>Prompt:</b> No!<br/>
<b>Rating(s):</b> PG slash</p><p><b>Sentence:</b><br/>
Jack was getting fed up of saying no all the time to Zoe's requests and to all the scientists that wanted him to look the other way while they worked on dangerous projects irresponsibly, so it felt great to finally say yes when Nathan asked him out on their first date.</p><p>-------</p><p><b>Prompt:</b> leave me alone<br/>
<b>Rating(s):</b> PG </p><p><b>Sentence:</b><br/>
There were times when he simply needed to be left alone to process whatever disaster had befallen that day, shutting his office door and turning off his cell and computer, so when the door opened uninvited the words, 'Go away', were on his lips until he saw it was Jack and said, "Hey" back at him instead.</p><p>-------</p><p><b>Prompt:</b> betray<br/>
<b>Rating(s):</b> PG </p><p><b>Sentence:</b><br/>
He let Zoe believe he was the bad guy, the one who worked too hard and broke up their family, as he didn't want to see the disappointment in her eyes when she realized it was her mom who had betrayed them both first.</p><p>-------</p><p><b>Prompt:</b> friends<br/>
<b>Rating(s):</b> PG slash</p><p><b>Sentence:</b><br/>
They had been frenemies for so long it seemed strange when he realized that term no longer applied and they were actually friends, just in time to take it to the next level - if Jack was willing.</p><p>-------</p><p><b>Prompt:</b> sick<br/>
<b>Rating(s):</b> PG slash</p><p><b>Sentence:</b><br/>
Everybody panicked whenever Jack took a sick day when he wasn't actually sick of anything other than how he was treated, hoping SARAH wouldn't go all BRAD on them and destroy the town, but fortunately Nathan had a sure fire way of raising Jack's spirits... and other things too, he thought lasciviously as he headed to the Bunker.</p><p>-------</p><p><b>Prompt:</b> breath<br/>
<b>Rating(s):</b> PG </p><p><b>Sentence:</b><br/>
Every breath hurt as his cracked ribs and smoke-abused lungs rebelled against the act but Jack could hear Nathan's voice frantically calling for him above the rubble of what was an off-site laboratory, and though it hurt like crazy, Jack drew in a breath and yelled back.</p><p>-------</p><p><b>Prompt:</b> hiding place<br/>
<b>Rating(s):</b> PG </p><p><b>Sentence:</b><br/>
When he wanted to avoid any of the shenanigans happening around the town Jack disappeared off to Sheriff Cobb's old place that he and Allison had modernized before she gave up on their marriage, and where no one knew where to find him except Nathan, who always came bearing gifts of beer and pizza, and a smug smile.</p><p>-------</p><p><b>Prompt:</b> melodrama<br/>
<b>Rating(s):</b> PG </p><p><b>Sentence:</b><br/>
Despite all the brainiacs Eureka still had its fair share of petty crimes and melodrama as befitting any small town, but as Jack prepared to leap into a wormhole he wondered if any other small town cop ever had to deal with universe ending catastrophes too.</p><p>-------</p><p><b>Prompt:</b> passing out<br/>
<b>Rating(s):</b> PG slash</p><p><b>Sentence:</b><br/>
"I didn't faint. I passed out from... tiredness," Jack proclaimed, because he was damned if he was going to admit that seeing the man he loved alive after believing Nathan dead for so many years had short circuited his brain so completely.</p><p>-------</p><p><b>Prompt:</b> still alive<br/>
<b>Rating(s):</b> PG </p><p><b>Sentence:</b><br/>
Nathan took a deep breath, letting it out slowly as the world came back into focus, ending the time loops that would have destroyed their universe, and laughed as he saw the relief and joy at being alive reflected back from Jack's eyes.</p><p>-------</p><p><b>Prompt:</b> soulmate<br/>
<b>Rating(s):</b> PG slash</p><p><b>Sentence:</b><br/>
Very few people were born with a soulmark so he knew his marriage was doomed from the start, and yet Nathan never expected to find his soulmate was a headstrong man wearing a Sheriff's uniform, and he never expected to fall in love with him so deeply once he gave them both a chance.</p><p>-------</p><p><b>Prompt:</b> secrets<br/>
<b>Rating(s):</b> PG slash</p><p><b>Sentence:</b><br/>
Keeping secrets was just part of the job and Nathan was very good at his job but recently he found himself hating keeping any secrets from Jack, especially when those secrets put him into grave danger, so for the first time in his life he quit a job just so he no longer had to keep secrets from the man he loved.</p><p>-------</p><p><b>Prompt:</b> healing<br/>
<b>Rating(s):</b> PG </p><p><b>Sentence:</b><br/>
Nathan had witnessed the healing power of the artifact first hand, watching as the mess of Jack's blasted chest healed without a scar, and as he held Jack in his arms years later with Jack's blood flowing through his fingers, he wished it was still alive, knowing he would have to place all his faith in human surgeons instead.</p><p>-------</p><p><b>Prompt:</b> apocalypse<br/>
<b>Rating(s):</b> PG </p><p><b>Sentence:</b><br/>
Jack had battled against the end of the world and even the end of the entire universe so often he barely blinked when he heard of the latest apocalyptic situation, leaping in again to save the day while silently wishing certain scientists could refrain from hitting the shiny red buttons, and another one in particular could leave his giant ego behind when he went to work each day.</p><p>-------</p><p><b>Prompt:</b> drunk<br/>
<b>Rating(s):</b> PG </p><p><b>Sentence:</b><br/>
It was a well known fact Jack was a lightweight but happy drunk with just a couple of beers enough to get him relaxed, so Nathan armed himself with a couple of six-packs of Jack's favorite brew when he went to apologize later that evening, knowing he would be forgiven. </p><p>-------</p><p><b>Prompt:</b> reassuring<br/>
<b>Rating(s):</b> PG </p><p><b>Sentence:</b><br/>
Jack never found it reassuring when one of Eureka's mad scientists said 'nothing can go wrong' because in his experience it always ended in tears, so as he nodded his head he mentally prepared himself to save the town or the universe again.</p><p>END<br/>
