    <p>Here’s the thing, right.</p><p>Loki loves all of his children, despite what everyone else may think. He loves them, birth defects and all.</p><p>The problem is, well, he is the Prince of Asgard. Oh, he won’t delude himself into thinking he’ll be the heir—Odin has made his bias clear—but he is a prince, and he has an image to uphold.</p><p>Besides, they’re his children. They will be fine.</p><p>And anyway, it’s not like he forgot about them. He makes an effort to visit them, once a year at the least and everyday if he could.</p><p>It’s just, again, he’s a prince. And princes have responsibilities, and upholding them is Loki’s number one priority.</p><p>But being a father is a very close second. So when he finds out he has another son, well.</p><p>It looks like it’s time to use those secret pathways again.</p><p> </p><p>Loki remembers Lily, not that he could forget, even if he tried. He doubts anyone would be able to forget meeting a ball of spitfire who could literally spit fire.</p><p>Because, ladies and gents and nonbinary pals, Lily Evans was a witch. Keyword here is was, because now she is dead.</p><p>Her husband is dead, too, but that’s less important, Loki thinks. He never liked James Potter that much anyway, not the least because he was also in love with her.</p><p>But he isn’t a petty bastard, because of course he realizes he and Lily would never be able to marry. For one, he was a prince, as mentioned above, and the Prince of Asgard at that. It is his duty to marry a woman of noble blood and carry on the royal line.</p><p>And two, he was a god, albeit one with a lowercase g, and Lily was mortal, no matter how Muggles would perceive Magicals like her otherwise. It would be the worst kind of pain watching his wife die.</p><p>Besides, Odin would never approve. He’ll no doubt separate the two of them, just as he did with Loki and all of his children. They could hide their relationship, but Lily deserved better than a husband who she only sees once or twice a year.</p><p>So Loki is bitter, but he’s also logical, and he sees how happy the Potter kid makes her, so he withdraws gracefully from the competition.</p><p>They marry on a Thursday. Loki is pretty sure it was that Black’s idea.</p><p>Fuck. Him.</p><p> </p><p>That should be the end of it, except, oh ho ho, the Potter kid was infertile.</p><p>Loki secretly thinks it’s due to all that pureblood inbreeding, but he doesn’t say it. Potter is already distraught enough, and Loki isn’t that big of a dick.</p><p>Besides, it’s not he hates the kid. He is the god of mischief (among other things), after all, and the Marauders were up to all kinds of mischief in that school of theirs.</p><p>The point is, Lily and Potter want a child, and Loki is the only other guy they trust with this job.</p><p>Well, there’s the rest of the Marauders, but Black and Lupin are so gay for each other it hurts his eyes and Pettigrew wants to save his virginity for that someone special.</p><p>Loki will spare you the details, but the end result is that Lily is pregnant. The mediwitch happily announced that they should expect a healthy child by July.</p><p>Finally, Loki thinks. Now I can go back to Asgard and never think about—</p><p>“Loki, would you like to be this child’s godfather?”</p><p>He is not crying, okay. He’s just allergic to, er, that shirt.</p><p> </p><p>Of course, Loki is not the primary godfather—that honor goes to the Black kid—which was expected. He is a prince, as emphasized twice now, and he cannot be expected to drop everything to take care of the child, if the need arises. Black, however, certainly can. And he and Lupin would make some damn fine parents, if the situations calls for it.</p><p>Because Lily and Potter and Potter Jr are not allowed to die, no matter what some bloody prophecy said.</p><p>But he is a god, and he cannot interfere in the affairs of mortals. He cannot provide the former two any help, but the latter, his son, he can protect.</p><p>Loki visits the first of August, 1980, and casts a spell he hopes would never come into effect.</p><p>In the meantime, he admires the boy, who looks eerily similar to him. Perhaps some would compare his black hair to Potter’s and his green eyes to Lily’s, but if they were to put Potter Jr and Loki side by side, there will be no denying who the real father is.</p><p>Loki thinks a god’s clone should have a god’s name, and is fully prepared to give the new parents some advice, except Lily beats him to the punch and tells him the child’s name.</p><p>Harry. James. Potter.</p><p>How utterly plain.</p><p> </p><p>Fortunately or unfortunately, the spell comes into effect.</p><p>Loki was away, celebrating Alfablot in Asgard, but he came as soon as he was able to sneak away.</p><p>The cottage was destroyed. Everyone was gone.</p><p>“Are they dead?” He asked the empty space.</p><p>Hel appeared, looking dreadfully pale and thin, “Lily Evans and James Potter are,” she intoned. “but Harry is not.”</p><p>She disappeared then, as quickly as she came, because even though she can leave her own damn realm anytime she like, she is the Queen of Niflheim and therefore has a responsibility to her subjects.</p><p>That, in this case, being the reapers and the trillions of beings that have died since the beginning of this cycle.</p><p> </p><p>Harry is ridiculously easy to find, mostly because they share the same blood. Loki, who did not allow himself to properly mourn until he makes sure his damn son is safe, is outraged when he sees that Harry has been left with the Dursleys.</p><p>Lily hate—strongly disliked her sister and the man she chose to marry, and so does Loki. He remembers the hopeful Petunia who had written to Dumbledore begging to be admitted into Hogwarts, only to turn into a petty girl once rejected. Loki understood the bitterness of seeing a sibling become more favored by their parents, but he does not understand why she would dedicate her life to despising and punishing Lily for it. Loki resents Odin for his bias, but he would never think Thor was at fault. The great oaf was just…too naïve to have a mean body in his body. Similarly, Lily had never been anything but nice to Petunia, even at her worst moments.</p><p>It’s all about perspective, Loki had learned. Petunia had allowed her anger to twist her into an unpleasant woman who settled with the first man to give her the time of the day, whereas Loki had allowed his jealousy to fuel his ambitions. And he became <em>great.</em></p><p>For while Thor may excel at combat, there is no one in Asgard better with magic than Loki; by the same vein, Lily may have been recognized as the smartest witch in her generation, but Petunia could’ve became an award-winning astrophysicist.</p><p>But what’s done is done, and the present situation is that Harry is in imminent danger.</p><p>Because of a boy brawling loud enough to shatter several eardrums.</p><p>Loki quickly turns invisible while Petunia hurries into the room, looking appropriately ragged for a new mother. She scoops up the baby and cuddles him to her bosoms, rocking him gently until he settles, cries changing to soft snores.</p><p>On a table opposite of the room, Harry makes a gurgling sound that Loki (and Lily and the Marauders) have learned to mean that he’s hungry. Petunia only shushes him.</p><p>“Be quiet, boy. You’ll wake up Dudders.”</p><p>Loki shuddered. Dudders. What a horrifying name.</p><p>Satisfied that her boy is now asleep, Petunia leaves, presumably to also catch some sleep before Dudders awake with another need. Loki reappears, and approaches the basket Harry has been placed in. He’s swaddled loosely in a thin blanket, and blinks curiously up at Loki before a heart stopping smile spreads across his lips.</p><p>“Lo-lo!” Harry says, and Loki cannot help but grin back.</p><p>“Hi, little one,” he says quietly, making sure to not wake Dudders and bring Petunia or, Odin forbid, Vernon into the room. “Are you hungry?”</p><p>Harry makes an affirmative sound, so Loki wiggles his fingers and conjures up some baby food and a spoon. He feeds it to Harry gently but insistently, pushing in the food that spilled over Harry’s mouth with his fingers. Harry burps a little when he’s full. Loki laughs.</p><p>And for a moment, he’s so, <em>so</em> very tempted to bring Harry back with him to Asgard. But common sense hits just as quickly, and Loki pushes away the thought when he remembers what exactly happened to the other children he brought to Odin.</p><p>Outside, Dawn breaks out over the hills, spilling rays of sunlight through the window and across the wooden floor. Loki knows that soon, the people of Asgard will wake and someone will question the presence of their prince.</p><p>He cannot stay here forever, but oh, how he wishes he could.  He would be happy to stand, for eternity, in this small room, watching his son fall asleep while gripping his index finger in his tiny fist.</p><p>But he’s a prince, and he has duties, so he does the best next thing.</p><p>“Hel,” he summons softly, “can you take care of him, please?”</p>
