    <p>This was it, I thought, this was going to be my last school year at Hogwarts. My mother had brought me to Kings Cross and I was now boarding the Hogwarts Express for the last time at this station.</p><p>"Kinda sad, right?" Layla asked as she looped her arm with mine. Layla was one out of two of my best friend. </p><p>I nodded, "I'll miss riding the train with you guys."</p><p>The two of us brought our luggage onto the train and went looking for a department. </p><p>"Kori! Layla!" we heard an all too familiar voice call out and we looked behind us to see Florence, the third person in our trio, stick her head out of one of the departments.</p><p>We turned around and made our way to her, which wasn't all that difficult since we were very early. "Pixie!" Layla yelled happily and nearly suffocated our smallest friend in a bear hug. </p><p>"Love you too," Florence mumbled against Layla's chest. I laughed and brought mine and Layla's trunk into the department.</p><p>As Layla had finally released our friend, I gave her a quick hug and the three of us sat down. "So, what were you up to in the summer?" Layla asked, "Any demigod stuff happen?"</p><p>Florence and I exchanged a look, "Maybe?" I answer and Florence is suddenly very interested in her dark green fingernails. "There could have been a war," she mumbles.</p><p>"What?" our pink-haired friend exclaimed, "And you didn't bother to send an owl, 'Sorry if we don't come back next year we could be eaten by a Hellhound'?"</p><p>I lift a hand, "Hellhounds don't attack daughters of Pluto."</p><p>"That's not the point," Layla grumbled. She knew that Florence, or Pixie to us, was a daughter of Demeter and that I was a child of Pluto although she was not a demigod herself. </p><p>"Well, I couldn't write," I say, showing a new scar on my right hand that went along my arm, "broken hand."</p><p>Layla's gaze now fixed on Pixie but the brunette girl was luckily saved by our department door opening. Eleanor Heart stuck her head in the department, "Any place left?" she asked.</p><p>Pixie and I nodded quickly and Eleanor opened the door wider so that her brother, Carrick, could enter behind her. The two Heart twins had been on the Quidditch Team with me last year. They were both known for being amazing beaters and incredibly beautiful.</p><p>Both of them had piercing blue eyes, black hair, and high cheekbones. They were also both tattooed on their arms but they hid that with spells from the Professors had Hogwarts.</p><p>The two sat down and Carrick smirked at Layla, "Nice hair."</p><p>Layla's hair had been blonde when I first met her in our first year, then over the holidays she had died it red and after the next break, she had another hair colour again. She just loved changing the colour and style of her hair and now it was trimmed to her shoulders and coloured pastel pink. </p><p>"I'd say the same to you but it looks like you haven't seen a hairdresser in a while," Layla replied. </p><p>Eleanor laughed at the face her brother pulled. "I told him he should go before school begins again but he was too lazy."</p><p>"I wasn't lazy. I was training my voice," he replied as we felt the train start moving. Carrick wanted to become a singer after he finished school and 'training his voice' was his excuse for everything.</p><p>Layla looked at him sceptically but then brightened up, "Anyway, I'm really excited. Are you going to try to get in?" she asked.</p><p>"Get where in?" I asked and I could see that Pixie was looking as confused as I was. </p><p>"Sometimes I wonder which of us is really muggle-born," Layla said with a sigh. "The Triwizard Tournament! It's now nearly been 15 years that Harry Potter won the cup."</p><p>Pixie locked at us, "You're not really planning on trying to enter, are you?"</p><p>"I'll try." the twins spoke in unison.</p><p>Layla lifted her hands, making the sun that came through the window shine on her dark red coloured fingernails, "I definitely won't. I have no death wish."</p><p>The group looked at me now. "Of course I will." I gave them a strange look, "Did you really think I wouldn't sign up to something reckless where I could die? Do you even know me?" I feigned hurt as I laid my hand against my chest.</p><p>"It's a shame really." Leyla said, "You'll be so busy with that stuff, you won't even have the time to sneak out on an MCR concert with me."</p><p>"I promise to sneak out on the one in August," I told her. </p><p>"But that's next year!" she cried.</p><p>Carrick spoke up. "Even if none of us is chosen as Champion, Hogwarts will be so full that it will be difficult to get away."</p><p>"Trust me," Pixie told him, "If there's a Layla, there's a way."</p><p>"Like when she convinced Trelawney that the tea leaves said we'd all die if the Divination classes won't be cancelled for three weeks." I piped up.</p><p>We laughed and Layla had to laugh too, that was maybe one of her favourite achievements and there were many. Kori and Pixie often joked that she was probably related to Aphrodite and Athena.</p><p>As we had calmed down again, our department door was opened, "Car for anything of the trolley, dearies?" the Trolley witch asked us. </p><p>We quickly ordered what we wanted and then made ourselves comfortable in the department again.</p><p>After a while of eating and joking around, we started to play truth or dare. "I dare you to eat this bean," I told Carrick and handed him a baby blue bean of my package of Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans. </p><p>He took it and inspected it before putting it in his mouth. He grimaced and spit it into a plastic bag we were using for our candy wrappers. "Soap!" he screeched and stuck his tongue out. </p><p>His sister laughed at him and then turned to Layla, "Truth or Dare?"</p><p>"Truth," she answered.</p><p>Eleanor thought for a moment. "If you had to sleep with anyone of last years Quidditch team, who would it be?"</p><p>"Seth?" she asked, "Or Aiken, I don't know. Last years Quidditch Team only had good-looking people in it."</p><p>"I'm offended that you didn't choose me," Carrick told her. "Does our love mean nothing to you?"</p><p>"You let Kori get hit by a badger last year. That's a minus point." the pink-haired girl replied.</p><p>Carrick gasped, "I would never."</p><p>"No, I actually I have to agree," Eleanor said, "If I remember correctly, you were too busy ogling the enemy."</p><p>"Well, who can blame him," I said. "The Gryffindor players are pretty hot."</p><p>Pixie smirked and elbowed me, "Does that mean your finally over your long-time crush?"</p><p>I hid my face in my hands, "I don't know what you're talking about."</p><p>"Ooh, do tell." Eleanor encouraged my long-haired friend.</p><p>"It was about three years ago..." Pixie started.</p><p>"...when our little Kori here met an, what did she call it?" Layla asked Pixie.</p><p>"Absolute Goddess." Pixie nodded. "She also said she was the most beautiful human being she's ever seen."</p><p>"You know, when they first met they tried to kill each other." Layla explained, "And thus, this little nut fell in love."</p><p>"Does she know?" Eleanor asked her.</p><p>Pixie shook her head hard enough for her long brown locks to fall all over the place, "She's too much of a chicken to tell her."</p><p>"I hate you guys," I muttered as I hid my face in Pixie's hair. </p><p>Little did I know that my four friends shared a knowing look and came to a silent agreement that would change my life.</p>
