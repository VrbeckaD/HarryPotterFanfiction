    <p>After Harry sent Hermione back through the purple flames to see to Ron and get help, he took a moment to brace himself for the confrontation to come with a deep breath. His shaking hand squeezed around the chilled glass of the smallest bottle as he brought it up to his face to glare at uncertainly. Harry took a step back from the table and spun around towards the black flames that led to certain danger.</p><p>"Here, I come," He murmured as he yanked the stopper from the top. He swallowed the meager contents in one go, and almost immediately it felt as if all the blood in his body had turned to ice. Harry shuddered as he sat the tiny bottle back on the table. He willed himself to walk into the ominous flames.</p><p>Harry tensed a bit as he took the first step inside the archway on instinct, but the black fire held no temperature and, indeed, didn't feel like anything at all.</p><p>The boy took a few more steps and came out the other side, not to see Snape, as they had suspected, but instead, <em>Quirrell</em> was standing there in front of the Mirror of Erised. The man didn't make a single twitch or quiver. He stood resolute, smiling a disconcerting kind of smile, his arms held firm behind his back and his chest pulled up.</p><p>"<em>You!</em>" Harry gasped out. He felt his jaw drop a little despite himself. They had been so <em>sure</em> it was going to be Snape!</p><p>Quirrell's smile widened, becoming something unnervingly predator-like as he turned away from the mirror, "Me. I wondered whether I'd be meeting you here, <em>Potter</em>."</p><p>Harry frowned at the inflection of his surname. Shaking it off, he replied, "But I thought- Snape-"</p><p>"Severus?" Quirrell laughed, his voice oddly sharp and chilled, "It's funny, <em>Potter, </em>that you would assume it to be <em>Severus</em>, considering-... well, I couldn't blame you. Severus does seem the type, doesn't he? You certainly aren't aware of your circumstances as far as can be told. No. It is rather useful the way he swoops around like an overgrown bat. Next to him, who would ever suspect p-p-poor st-stuttering P-Professor Quirrell?"</p><p>Harry's brow furrowed. What in <em>Merlin's name</em> was going on? Listening to this man monologue was like listening to one half of a telephone conversation. He was absolutely nutters! Still, Harry pressed forward, attempting to stall and get some more information at the same time. Perhaps if he could keep Quirrell talking until help arrived he'd make it out of this chamber alive.</p><p>"But Snape tried to kill me!"</p><p>"No, no, no. <em>I </em>tried to kill you. Your friend, Miss Granger, accidentally knocked me over as she rushed to set fire to Snape at that Quidditch match. She broke my eye contact with you. Another few seconds and I'd have got you off that broom. I'd have managed it before then if Snape hadn't been muttering a countercurse, trying to save you. Though… I suppose I must thank both of them for that with what we've found out, hm. Might've ended up the same as that Halloween night. Then where would we be?" Quirrell's smile turned into a smirk as he gave the boy a once-over.</p><p>Harry shook his head in disbelief, "What are you talking about? Snape tried to… save me?"</p><p>"Of course," Quirrell drawled irritatedly, "Why do you think he wanted to referee your next match? He was trying to make sure I didn't do it again. Funny really… He needn't have bothered. It was that very instance that gave us the revelation, you see?"</p><p>"What… what revelation? <em>Us</em>?" Harry breathed out, green eyes wide. He suddenly was filled with a cold throughout his veins that had nothing to do with the potion he had just taken. Something was horribly wrong. He could just feel it.</p><p>"<em>Let me… Let me speak to the boy…" </em>Came a horrible muffled and breathy voice from somewhere near Quirrell though his lips hadn't moved at all.</p><p>"Master, your strength is-" Quirrell tried to interject.</p><p>"<em>I have… strength enough for this…"</em> the whispery voice interrupted. Even so sickly sounding, that strange, horrifying voice held command with absolute certainty of obedience. Quirrell didn't disappoint, and quickly turned his back to Harry. Slowly, the man unwrapped the stinking purple turban from his head.</p><p>The fabric fell to the floor and Harry stood rooted to the spot. His eyes widened in horror as the back of Quirrell's head was slowly revealed. Entirely too soon the last of it was dropped, and Harry let out an involuntary gasp.</p><p>There, on the back of the man's skull, was an entirely different face. It was incredibly pale, so much so Harry could tell it wasn't due to the lack of sun under the turban, but rather like the skin had been grafted there with the face itself. Instead of a nose, it had two vertical slits where one <em>should </em>be, giving an awfully similar resemblance to a snake. Gradually, Harry's verdant eyes slid up to make eye contact with the… thing. Sharp red eyes gazed back, looking Harry over as much as Harry had been looking over it.</p><p>"Harry <em>Potter…"</em> It whispered, a lazy smirk tipping onto its non-existent lips, "I wondered... if you would follow us... down here. Ever the Gryffindor... Severus must be so disappointed."</p><p>"Who… what <em>are</em> you?!" Harry's voice rose in pitch slightly, ignoring the comment about his Potions Professor. This was <em>not </em>normal. Even for the Wizarding World, he just <em>knew</em> it.</p><p>Those keen red eyes narrowed into a tired glare, "I am Lord Voldemort… boy… and now that I know… <em>exactly </em>why you survived that Halloween night… and I was torn from my body… I have no need to bother with killing you… Unless, you stand against me...?"</p><p>None of this was making any sense, whatsoever. Harry's breath came a bit quicker. He really did seem to have the worst possible luck. With a wary look and sweaty palms convulsing nervously over the handle of his holly wand, Harry attempted to keep the madman talking. <em>Surely</em> someone would come for him soon, "What are you talking about?"</p><p>Voldemort inclined Quirrell's head a fraction and smirked again, "Why, the secret to your survival… of course… Dumbledore has likely told you that it was… the love of your mother that saved you… He's always been a sentimental old fool…"</p><p>"We… we've not discussed it, actually," Harry frowned with mild bewilderment, "There's not been reason too, really."</p><p>Quirrell's shoulders shrugged, and Harry couldn't help but think how weird it was to watch a body turned away from you move for a face on the back of it's head. He shuddered, and Voldemort continued, "Ah, well… I'm sure that's what he <em>will</em> tell you… should you ask… It seems however, that the matter was... " Voldemort grimaced as if the words physically pained him, "<em>Partially</em> my own error… It remains to be seen if… your father knew anything about it, of course, or… if your mother had committed line theft without his knowledge…"</p><p>"Wha- <em>line</em> theft?" Harry glared. He didn't really know what that meant, but he didn't appreciate anyone accusing his mother of a crime. Especially the man that <em>killed</em> her, "How dare- What are you even trying to say, you-you snake face?!"</p><p>Voldemort smirked in response to Harry's fiery exclamation and rather poor insult, "Yes… Line theft… You see, it appears your father is not… who I had assumed… When my followers enter into my service, young Harry… they sign a magical contract that puts them entirely under my… care… However, my Inner Circle… well, they receive a few provisos to that contract… One of those provisos, is the agreement that their heirs… will not be harmed or killed by me unless… actively going against my will…"</p><p>A fresh wave of dawning horror swept over Harry as he assimilated that information, and Voldemort rasped his cold, high laugh as the boy's face began to show comprehension of where this story was headed.</p><p>"No… that's not-"</p><p>"I'm afraid so… you are indeed the son of one of my Inner Circle… not James Potter… and when I went to kill you that night, I went against contract... and my curse rebounded on to myself in retaliation… as you were much too young to actively go against me…"</p><p>"But everyone says I look <em>just like</em> Dad!" Harry argued vehemently. His voice rose in pitch a little hysterically, but he refused to acknowledge it, "They say I look 'just like James', except my eyes!"</p><p>Quirrell's head nodded, and Voldemort gave Harry a mocking smile, "Yes… curious that… that you look <em>just like</em> Potter… Now that I know the truth, I can see that you… look only superficially like the man… I know that the contract is the only way I would have been… cast from my body… and with out those horrendous glasses... James Potter was no follower of mine, and Lily Potter… Well… she would never have been either… There was one, however, from my Inner Circle… one who begged for your mother's life."</p><p>Harry's breath became trapped in his throat, and his sweaty hands trembled as the face of the Dark Lord gave this bit of information to him with a malicious grin. Why would one of Voldemort's followers ask him to spare Harry's mother? It didn't make any sense. He couldn't be the son of one of Voldemort's followers. He just couldn't.</p><p>"Mmh… Yes, I can see you're having trouble… believing me… He asked me to spare her, young Harry… because he was in <em>love</em> with her," Voldemort sneered at the word, looking quite peeved at having to say such a thing out loud. The sneer turned back into that malicious grin as Harry began to shake his head violently, "Indeed… I did <em>try </em>to spare her, you know… Lord Voldemort always keeps his promises… but the infuriating woman refused to stand aside… Knowing now what I do, I'd change all of that, but… well, I had been mislead… Oh, yes… Severus was quite mad for the girl… I should have known when he came to me…"</p><p>"<em>Snape</em>?!" Harry almost shrieked. He could feel himself turning green at the thought, "<em>Snape </em>was in love with <em>my </em>mother?!"</p><p>Harry felt as if his entire world had been turned upside down and shaken vigorously. None of this could possibly be true. It just couldn't. That bitter, greasy git, could not possibly be Harry's father. No, his father was James Potter, and that was the end of it. Voldemort was <em>obviously </em>unstable in several different ways. This was just one of them. It <em>had</em> to be.</p><p>An amused smirk curled one side of that pale, lipless mouth, "As I said… But that's neither here nor there… No… The real question, is whether you will choose to honor… your father's original loyalties and remain among living… or whether you shall choose to nullify the contract… allowing me to eliminate you now as I had tried to mistakenly… all those years ago… This time without consequence to my person."</p><p>'<em>There certainly aren't a lot of options left for me,</em>' Harry thought ruefully. All the information stuffed into his head in a short amount of time and the high stress of the situation was beginning to wear at Harry, starting a migraine behind his left eye. He pinched the bridge of his nose to help stave it off. On one hand, Harry could help this madman, and hope that the assistance of the Stone would in some way heal a bit of his obviously shredded mind… He could either pledge loyalty to his parents' murderer… or he could die here in this chamber for real this time. And what if the man was lying all together? What then?</p><p>"I am <em>not</em> a patient man, Harry…" Voldemort hissed out pointedly, glaring with those penetrative crimson eyes.</p><p>Harry bit back the urge to inform him that he wasn't really a man at all right now, patient or otherwise.</p><p>Erring on the side of caution was Harry's best bet of survival, he concluded. If he was going to do this though, he was going to get something in return. There was no way he was going to help this murderous psychopath without some reparations being made. That just wasn't on.</p><p>"Alright… I'll help you… I'll swear to uphold the loyalty and the contract conditions, but only if-if I get my own personal contract in return," Harry glared, standing up as straight as he could manage. He might be acting on Slytherin instinct, but he'd see to it that he kept his cloak of Gryffindor bravery wrapped around him for this.</p><p>The snake-like face looked disturbingly pleased at this news, red eyes glittering almost greedily, "Of course… you shall have the same contract as my newest followers…"</p><p>Harry shook his head. He steadied his shaking hands by pressing them against his sides, "No… I mean, I want to look over it first. And I want to add some conditions. I want to be there when you question Snape about… about whether or not he knows… and I want a test to know for sure… and… and I want you to get me out of my Aunt's house."</p><p>Voldemort's face blanked, but Harry could tell he was a bit confused, "Your Aunt…? James Potter had no siblings…."</p><p>"My mother's sister… a muggle," Harry frowned, wondering why this was being discussed at all really, "I live with my muggle aunt, her muggle husband, and their muggle son. They hate me, and I… I don't want to go back. That's one of my conditions."</p><p>Quirrell's head tilted back and Voldemort's face became vaguely murderous. Those serpentine nostrils flared alarmingly as he hissed venomously, "That… goes without saying… Magical children should not be left with <em>muggles…</em> If your father's loyalty hasn't wavered you will… be returned to him… if I am forced to kill him for disloyalty… We shall find some other lodging for you… I will have the contract quickly… Now, you must hurry… uphold your end… Time is running out…"</p><p>Harry nodded, and stepped closer to Quirrell, taking care to keep out of arm's reach as he came up to the mirror. Wary green eyes slid from Voldemort's terrifying visage to look at their reflection. The image of a pale and shaky boy stared back at him. The mirror seemed to waver, then, after a moment, his reflection smiled mischievously as it stuck one hand into it's trouser pocket. Harry watched as his grinning reflection pulled forth a small glowing red stone, winked, and placed it back into the pocket. As it was replaced Harry felt the object being pushed into his <em>actual </em>trousers, and took a sharp intake of breath. What a creepy feeling. He was going to have nightmares about mirrors for ages.</p><p>Slowly, he turned to Voldemort. This was it. No going back after this. Harry frowned, now more glad than ever that Hermione couldn't have followed him to witness it. Oh, Merlin, what would his friends think? The promise of escaping the Dursley's and not being killed was a weighty price though. And perhaps he could convince the man to take a less violent path to victory this time? Merlin, this kind of optimism surely bordered on insanity. This <em>had </em>to be worth it in the end, though.</p><p>He hoped fervently that it would be as he pulled the Stone from his pocket with clammy shaking fingers, and held it out for Voldemort to take in one of Quirrell's creepy backwards facing hands. Yuck.</p><p>"Yes… <em>finally</em>... " Voldemort rasped as he plucked the Stone from Harry's outstretched hand. With another predatory grin, the wraith regarded Harry, "Your contract will be waiting for you after you return from the Infirmary… As soon as you sign it, it will return to me… you will have to make as if… you are returning to the <em>muggles</em>, but… I will have you retrieved before you make it there… Then we shall proceed with the rest of your… <em>conditions…</em>"</p><p>Harry nodded nervously before he caught the full meaning. He froze and gave Voldemort a look he knew likely advertised his fear, "Th-the <em>Infirmary</em>?!"</p><p>Voldemort smirked, "Well… we wouldn't want anyone to know you… gave me the Stone <em>purposefully</em>… would we…? Quirrell will make it look as if… you were overpowered, and… stun you… I will place a block on these memories until you receive your contract… Sweet dreams, Harry…"</p><p>Harry yelped as Quirrell whipped around, a satisfied grin on his pale, oddly small looking face and his wand in hand, "Hold still, <em>Potter. </em>This won't hurt much. <em>Stupefy!"</em></p><p>And everything went black.</p>
