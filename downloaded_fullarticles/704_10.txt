</p><p> </p><p>Chapter One: A Lonely Company</p><p>
  <em>They are standing outside of Flourish &amp; Blotts in Diagon Alley. The beautiful weather is unprecedented. For the past few weeks it’s been non-stop rain and thunderstorms. Today, the sky is blue and clear of any clouds. The sun shines luminously and the air feels crisp and cool, not hot and humid in the least. It isn’t too cold or too warm out. It isn’t as crowded as usual. Harry looks over at Draco. They smile at each other, and Draco’s blonde hair shines in the sunlight where it catches. His eyes are two mercurial pools of silver, so vibrant and bright. It seems that sunny weather compliments him well. They fall into step beside each other, moving at a somewhat leisurely pace. There isn’t a whole lot that they have to accomplish today, as they are pretty much done solving their most recent case; a string of robberies among the shops in Diagon Alley, in which wards were not recognizing a threat at all. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Draco says something but Harry is so lost in thought that he misses it. He turns his head toward the other man, asks him what he said. Draco opens his mouth to speak, but is struck by a spell so hard his entire body lurches from it. Someone has struck from an unknown location. Harry steps forward to right his partner, surveying their surroundings, on high alert. But the damage has already been done. He feels wetness on his hands from where he is holding Draco, hears a slick, tearing sound. He looks down and is horrified to see that the other man is bleeding profusely, his limbs detaching themselves from his body in slow motion, as if someone is taking a pair of invisible scissors and cutting them off of him.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“No!” Harry yells, now directing his wand at his partner and trying every healing spell he knows. Nothing helps, so he tries to cast a stasis spell, which also fails. It seems as if magic is just bouncing off of him now. Other bystanders have taken notice and there is a panic among the crowd. “Stay with me Draco, you’re going to be okay.” Draco is staring up at him with horror in his eyes. Blood begins to pour from his mouth and he chokes on the words he is trying to say.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Draco’s arms and legs are now completely torn from his body and he crumples in Harry’s arms. Harry can barely hold on, as there is too much blood and he can’t get a proper grip. The air is thick with the scent of it, and Harry thinks he can even taste copper. He feels sick as dread pools in his heart and stomach. This can’t be happening, he thinks, this can’t be real. He sends a Patronus out to the other Aurors for backup. Draco has stopped choking and stares blankly ahead as he finally slips out of Harry’s arms to land harshly on the blood soaked pavement. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Harry stands in shock, staring down at his partner, in pieces on the ground, thinking almost hysterically how Draco would be livid to have so much blood in his hair. It curls with the dark, wet, thickness of it, giving it the appearance of being slicked back, much like the way he used to wear it back in the early days at Hogwarts. Harry swallows once, and then lets out an animalistic scream. Suddenly, a wizard in dark grey robes appears before them, places his hand on Draco. Harry looks up and in a flash the wizard disappears with Draco and all of his detached limbs. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Draco!” Harry yells, beside himself with grief, “no!” </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Harry,” someone says in the distance.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Nonononononononononono!” He is frantic, turning around in circles. The sun feels suddenly much too bright, much too hot, and he finds that he can barely breathe-</em>
</p><p>“Harry.” Harry awakes in a tangled knot of sweat soaked limbs and blanket. He gasps for air, unceremoniously untangling himself before searching around for his glasses. His heart is pounding in his ears so loudly that he barely registers the voice of the person sitting next to him.</p><p>"Harry..." Ginny's voice is soft as she repeats his name again, but there is a tired and weary edge to it. It's too dark for him to make out her face but he knows she isn't happy. She sits next to him in the bed with her knees drawn up, arms wrapped tightly about them. She rubs sleep from her eyes. She doesn't act concerned, only sighs with little patience.</p><p>"A nightmare? Again?" The bite to her words sting him for just a moment. Behind his eyes there are momentary flashes of platinum hair, a smile, and then smooth pale limbs being torn apart. He shudders. It’s more of a memory, but he doesn’t feel like correcting her. There isn’t a point in doing so, not anymore.</p><p> "I think maybe you should talk to someone Harry, it's been a year and you haven't made any progress-"</p><p>He cuts her off then, much too angry. "You know that isn't true. I finally have a lead-"</p><p>"Emotionally." She interjects loudly. "I'm not talking about the case, Harry. Although that is something else altogether we need to discuss."</p><p>"What is there to discuss?" He scratches at his head, voice growing much too loud for their bedroom. "I have worked tirelessly and now for the first time in a year I may have a lead on his killer. I hardly think there is anything wrong with that Ginny, he deserves justice." He works hard to temper his voice and calm his nerves.</p><p>"Progress all made without the consent of the ministry, if I have to remind you."</p><p>"The ministry....made things difficult." He finishes blandly. There is a stretch of tense silence that lasts several moments before his wife tries again.</p><p>"Harry...I know he was your partner, and I know you want justice for him. But do you think he would have wanted to see you like this? Beating yourself up, obsessing over this case, having nightmares almost every night....Do you think he would have wanted you to be in this much pain for this long?"</p><p>"I won't be able to live with myself if I don't avenge him. I should have stopped it in the first place and I didn't." Harry says honestly. The guilt he feels is bone deep, drenched within every aspect of his being. There are things he can't say to his wife. Things that make the burning pain even brighter, more palpable. </p><p>"We have been through this a thousand times Harry, what happened was absolutely not your fault. Do you hear me?" She is reaching out to him now, fumbling slightly in the dark until her hands are caressing his face. Harry understands that he should feel comforted by his wife's words, her tender touches. But all he feels is desolation. </p><p>"I hear you." He answers with a sob. This is not the first time she has said this and it won't be the last. Pain hits the back of his throat like acid and he struggles to keep the tears from falling. His wife would never understand his plight. If she did, she would surely leave him. </p><p>"Please, see someone." She begs quietly.</p><p>"I will," he lies, "just give me time to chase this lead and when this is all over, I will see someone." She sighs with relief, retreating back to her side of the bed. Harry feels much better when the weight of her arms, her stare, and her presence have left him.</p><p>"Tomorrow starts my ovulation week." She says, already getting lost in the warm embrace of sleep.</p><p>Harry says nothing. He settles down and plunges head first into another nightmare.</p><p>***</p><p>The next week trickles by without much excitement. It feels slower than usual for Harry, who works almost obsessively on the lead he has, desperately trying to make a tricky incantation work properly. It is proving frustrating, but he is so close he can almost taste his revenge.</p><p> After the war, the wizarding world was left in chaos. Aurors worked tirelessly to wrangle Deatheaters and copycats alike. By the time Harry finally finished his training, he only caught the tail end of all of that. The fun cases, the ones that used to get his blood pumping and adrenaline going, seemed to have died along with his partner. An era of mind numbingly boring peace followed. Apart from the case he had secretly been working on for the past year, Auror work consisted of dealing mainly with petty crimes and corporate greed. As a result, work is agonizingly slow most days. This week was no exception, despite Harry feeling like a rubber band about to snap.</p><p>His nightly routine remains almost the same, save for the fact that this week Ginny is ovulating. This means that after dinner, they retreat to the bedroom. Harry lays in silence as his wife bobs along on top of him. She is beautiful in the pale moonlight. Harry knows he should be captivated by her beauty, that he should feel at least some kind of attraction to her. She is lovely, pale smooth skin glistening, perky breasts bouncing delicately, and long, fiery curls cascading down her shoulder. Her eyes are closed, mouth formed in a slight "o".</p><p>But Harry feels nothing. The only thing that finally allows him to harden beneath her and reach his completion are thoughts of a man who died long ago. Harry remembers the weight of a hard body pressed against his. He thinks he can still smell him; the earthy, spicy scent of sandalwood and a hint of something entirely unique. The minty, sweet heat of his breath. He can feel tight, lean muscles on his fingertips. Taste chapped, full lips against his own.</p><p>Once he has finished, he fears, very briefly, that these memories will one day fade into nothingness. The thought is so devastating he chokes back a sob. Ginny quietly climbs off of him before laying in the bed, legs propped up with the hopes in aiding his little swimmers to her waiting egg. Harry wonders if she feels anything anymore, if she enjoys their sex or if it's the idea of a baby that keeps her going. He doesn’t even know if she has been having orgasms lately.</p><p>Harry thinks a baby may help make him feel anything other than the misery haunting him day to day. He is excited at the idea of making a tiny little human that he can love unconditionally. Someone he can help mold and shape into a proper wizard or witch someday. His mind often drifts off with thoughts of a future daughter or son. But they have been trying for so long, the idea seems almost unreachable. Both have been cleared by mediwitches, and both have used magic to aid in conception, but to no avail. They have been told that these things take time, that there is never any guarantee. Harry and Ginny don't talk about it much, only continue to try month after month.</p><p>On Wednesday afternoon, Harry refuses yet another potential Auror partner. He works so well on his own that Kingsley has sort of been letting him slide by, but now he warns him that it has been long enough that he should be moving on. He needs a partner, according to Kingsley, and he will have to settle on one soon enough before his patience wears thin. It’s not that Harry doesn’t want another partner, it’s just that he doesn’t want another partner. No one could ever replace Draco, and Harry knows this to be truer than anything else he has ever known. And none of this is fair, really, but he nods along and makes a promise to Shacklebolt that he knows he’ll never be able to keep.</p><p>Friday night is pub night. He and Ron and a few of their other guy friends meet up to drink and talk about nonsense. His mind wanders the entire time, but he still manages to smile and nod and laugh at the appropriate times. He has it down to a science, and really, only those closest to him would be able to tell that he is still hurting, that he hasn’t moved on. He comes home too late and much too drunk, which causes a fight between him and Ginny when his dick doesn’t manage to get hard enough for them to have sex. They fight about the same things; Harry’s inability to move on, his flaws, all the things he does wrong. She looks at him with so much hurt, casts a sobering charm on him, and fucks him mechanically without a word. He barely looks at her, keeps his eyes closed and focuses on what it feels like so he doesn’t disappoint her <em>yet again</em>.</p><p>On Sunday, Harry and Ginny have dinner with the Weasleys, as is also their weekly routine. Ron and Hermione sit next to them at the table. Molly fusses over Harry, joking with Ginny that she doesn't feed him enough. Harry supposes that maybe his appetite hasn't been the same as it was, but it's nothing to really be all that concerned about. Hermione gives Harry a sympathetic look, and he wonders what that is all about. Ron shovels food in his mouth at top speed. They are joined by Ginny's other siblings and their children. Hermione touches her own swollen belly as she watches the kids play. He sees the look of sullen jealousy on his wife's face. Just another typical Sunday. </p><p>Harry should feel at home here. He should be grateful for the family he has. But his mind is racing with thoughts of the case. In this moment he finally realizes what he has been doing wrong, why he hasn't been able to get the incantation right. The incantation is ancient, rooted in deep, dark, and highly illegal magic. Harry needs to have dark feelings to use it. It is possible that he needs to direct his feelings of revenge toward locating the dark wizard that killed Draco, rather than simply casting clinically and hoping for the best. These spells are fickle at times, highly connected to the emotions behind it, much like unforgivables. He can barely contain his excitement-</p><p>"Isn't that right, darling?" Ginny's hand is on his arm. Everyone at the table is looking at him expectantly. It isn't hard to fake a smile as he responds. </p><p>"Absolutely, sweetheart." And then, after barely a minute, "I've just made a breakthrough in the case, can I be excused?" Cheers erupt at the table, but Harry doesn't miss the sour look on Ginny's face.</p><p>"Honey, can't it wait? We are with family..." she begins.</p><p>"No way!" Ron says eagerly, "let him go Gin, we need this... Alright, mate. If you get this right, tomorrow is the day!" She has no choice but to nod, fighting back the tears Harry knows she will cry later this evening. But it still won't stop her from coming to him for the sex neither of them enjoys, to chase the dream of the baby neither of them can conceive. </p><p>***</p><p>Harry sits anxiously at his desk, staring at his hands. Today in particular is one of the slowest days Harry has ever encountered. He waits with bated breath for his lunch time, as that will be the moment he finally takes down Draco's killer. He is 100% sure he has pinpointed the dark Wizard's location and there is a thrill coursing its way through his veins. Thinking of Draco is difficult though. It hurts with a raw, unhinged type of pain Harry has never experienced before. It makes this moment bittersweet.</p><p>"Don't worry," he says aloud to no one in particular, and yet a very specific someone at the same time, "I'm going to get him this time. I haven't forgotten you." He is attacked by a litany of emotions in this moment, each tethered to a specific memory. </p><p>Harry looks over at the empty desk on the other side of his spacious office, the one that used to belong to Draco. He tried to keep it as intact as possible but eventually he couldn’t take the weird looks and sympathetic glances anymore, so he had allowed the desk to be cleaned out. He regrets this now, as he can barely remember how it used to look. Draco was a messy partner, so his desk was always cluttered and filled to the brim with paperwork. The paperwork was his so-called “least favorite” part of the job, yet he was so infuriatingly <em>good at it. </em>His notes were always succinct, neat, with the right amount of detail, and always grammatically correct. He was always the one to complete it for them when they were partners, under the guise that Harry was too slow, or not detailed enough, or whatever other excuse. But Harry knew the truth, he just wanted to spare Harry the trouble. He was selfless in small ways like that, ways he would never care to admit to Harry out loud. Unbidden, Harry suddenly remembers the day he and Draco were forced to work together.</p><p>
  <em>The first thing Harry begrudgingly notices, as Draco Malfoy comes sauntering into his office as though he owns the place, is that he is absolutely beautiful. He is tall and lean, blonde hair falling just above his ears in pin straight strands. His eyes are molten silver, with a dangerous glint that makes him appear almost ethereal. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Malfoy looks him squarely in the eyes and says, “Potter, I hear that your Auror partners can’t keep up with you?” His eyes sparkle with mirth, the corner of his mouth tilts up in a crooked grin. Harry has trouble understanding…is he…making a joke? With him? Kingsley walks in behind him, shaking his head apologetically at Harry, making it a point to knock softly on the doorway, as if that will somehow teach Malfoy manners.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Now now, Malfoy, no need to be crass. There are just…creative differences.” Kingsley says, without really explaining anything. Harry sighs. So another one of his partners has complained about him. Harry thinks that really these people are jealous of him. And not even necessarily jealous of him, but perhaps his name and the fame that it brings, or his raw, natural talent. The fact that they would only ever be second best when it came to their partnership. Harry excels in this field, and it isn’t anything he will ever apologize for, or tone himself down for in order to make another person feel worthy. He sacrificed way too much in the war to be dumbing himself down in such a manner. Others simply need to keep up, although that is easier said than done, apparently.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“And you think what…that Malfoy…?” Harry directs his question at Kingsley.</em>
</p><p><em>“Malfoy recently graduated top of his class, and already has surpassed his own partner, three years his senior, in many aspects. I think that, perhaps, the two of you could form a complimentary partnership.” Shacklebolt looks almost desperate, the air hanging thickly between them as he presses his lips together in a thin line. Give him a chance, his eyes seem to say, because we are running out of partners for you and we are desperate</em>.</p><p>
  <em>Harry thinks for a moment. He hasn’t spoken to Draco Malfoy since the trials, in which he spoke out on his behalf. He knows Malfoy has ever since set out to prove himself, scoring nothing but E’s and O’s on his NEWTS in eighth year, where he kept mostly to himself, and most recently graduating with top marks as an Auror. He had taken a small break between graduating from Hogwarts and going into Auror training, which, Harry suspects, was spent working tirelessly to get back in good graces among the Malfoy inner circles. He imagines what it might have been like to train alongside of him, but shakes himself of the thought.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“What about our….history?” He asks simply.</em>
</p><p>
  <em> "Surely we are both over that bullshit from school?" Malfoy answers, another smirk on the tip of his lips. And Harry laughs, shocked and delighted at the same time. He watches Malfoy’s lips break out into a full on grin at that, and thinks, okay, maybe he could give this a shot. </em>
</p><p>Harry snaps out of his flashback with tears in his eyes. He remembers the way their partnership soon proved to be unparalleled in the Auror world. Malfoy was dedicated, had worked so hard to erase his past wrongdoings. Despite the fact that he wasn’t well liked to begin with, he was so good at what he did that he soon commanded the respect of the other Aurors. Not to mention he was a fantastic partner; intuitive, reliable, and selfless. They were so good together, they were almost unstoppable. Draco's smile could disarm him in an instant. He remembers the skillful and strong way that he fought, his unwavering sense of justice…</p><p>"Alright mate, are you ready for this?" Harry wipes the tears furiously from his face and squares his shoulders before turning toward his red headed best friend. Ron stands tall and clean cut in the doorway. He has been instrumental in helping Harry with the “case,” mainly because he is his best friend but also because, in Ron's own words, "the blonde git had really started to grow on me." Harry clears his throat briefly and nods his head.</p><p>"Yeah." He says it with determined resolution. </p><p>They lock eyes momentarily before springing into action. They had been planning their course of action for so long that both men know exactly what they need to do. Lunch time was just beginning, which gave them one hour before anyone would notice they were gone. They were not exactly authorized for their mission, but they each still did have permission to work on the case. They would just need to tell the story of how the wizard was apprehended a little differently from the truth.</p><p>Harry really doesn't care what happens to him after the fact. His tunnel vision is trained solely on vengeance. He is not thinking about how this could possibly ruin his career or even his life if the ministry were to investigate his actions too deeply. He feels a bit bad that he has dragged Ron into this, and his one regret would be if his best friend suffers any negative consequences. But they could throw Harry in Azkaban for the rest of his life and it wouldn’t matter to him in the slightest. He wouldn’t change his intentions right now for anything else in the world. Something very precious was stolen from him and he is going to do everything in his power to avenge it.</p><p>Their strides are wide and feet land heavy as they trudge out of the ministry and into the open air. It's sunny out, with the sky clearer than it has been in a really long time. Neither man stops to appreciate this fact. For Harry, it’s much too painful to think about the last time the sky was so sunny. Instead, they Apparate to an empty alleyway. </p><p>Harry lands a little shaky on his feet. Ron clamps a hand on his shoulder to help steady him. He speaks, probably to fill the awkward silence between them as they wait their few minutes for the incantation spell to pinpoint and send them to their desired location. </p><p>"Okay then. I'll ransack the place and see what I can find. You take him down. I know you want your vengeance, Harry." Ron's eyes are searching Harry's, and in the bright clear light of the day it's too much. Harry looks away.</p><p>"Here’s what is going to happen. He will put up a fight, and you'll have no choice. It's what we will say either way. I'm with you mate, 100%. I want to see that fucker pay for what he did." Ron finally removes his hand from Harry's shoulder and Harry releases the breath he hadn't realized he was holding. He is secretly thrilled by Ron's words. Harry has never wanted anything more than this. Well, maybe one or two things, but both were too painful to think about. </p><p>His wand lights up, signaling that the incantation has worked and they have about 30 seconds before being transported to the killer's exact location. If Harry succeeded in casting correctly, the bastard shouldn't see them coming and none of his wards should stand a chance. Harry's insides are burning with anticipation. He feels the familiar tug behind his belly button and then...</p><p>Everything happens much too fast. Harry finds himself standing inside of a small cottage in the middle of nowhere. A fireplace is burning, and soft yellows and oranges accent the walls. It smells of hot cocoa and it feels too hot and stuffy. It looks much too….homey to belong to a cold blooded killer. For a brief, terrifying moment, Harry wonders if perhaps there is a family -wife and children or even a family pet – also present within these walls. That would certainly make things… complicated.</p><p>"<em>Fuck!</em>" Harry turns toward the gruff voice and finds himself face to face with none other than Draco Malfoy's killer, a dark wizard by the name of Augustus Dresden, who is scrambling to vanish documents that are strewn about on the floor. He is dressed in tattered old robes, with salt and pepper unkempt long hair, long beard and mustache to match. He is tall and thin, but appears almost a bit yellow, like he has been sick with some kind of horrible disease for a very long time. His dark, beady eyes are darting between Harry and his documents, sweat breaking out on his forehead as he works tirelessly to vanish it all.</p><p>Harry hesitates, swallows, and then begins hurling spells toward him, all easily deflected. He curses under his breath. He has no idea where Ron is. He remembers how powerless he was to help Draco when he had been hit by Dresden’s cutting curse, wonders if it will be the same this time around, wonders why he didn’t train better for this part. At this time it seems that Augustus is only concerned with vanishing his documents, and not so much at attacking Harry.  Harry is fuming at how easily the wizard blocks his spells. He notices now that all of the documents are gone. Harry is livid, that could have been amazing evidence for his case! </p><p>His anger builds until he can feel his own magic in the air around him. This has happened a few times before, one of those times helping him to defeat Voldemort. The magic feeds his rage and vice a versa until he is nearly unstoppable. His magic cackles in a thick, palpable sort of way around him, like the static of electricity in the air right before lightning strikes on unsuspecting victims. His body strums to life as it courses shockingly through his veins. Harry is not sure how to control this gift he has, but he is happy it is happening now. Fueled by his anger, Harry finally says the words he has been wanting to say without a second thought. He aims his wand with perfect precision, feels the words with every fiber of his being, and more importantly, <em>wishes </em>them with all his might and power.</p><p>"Avada Kedavra!" He watches the life drain from Augustus's shocked face. His veins are thrumming with energy as he slowly comes down from his high. Yes, this feels just as good as he has dreamt for so long. This is perfect, this very moment right here-</p><p>"P-potter..." The voice is so faint that Harry almost believes he imagined it. He whips his head around, only to be met with the most beautiful and horrifying sight he has ever laid eyes on. Well, second most horrifying, anyway. </p><p>Draco is <em>right there</em>, sitting on the floor, chained to a tiny corner of the living room. He is emaciated, with dark circles under his eyes, and long blonde hair that reaches down past his shoulders, but he is <em>alive</em>. He is dressed in semi-formal robes that don't seem to really fit snug enough. He is gorgeous, yet so fragile it tears Harry's heart apart.</p><p>"Are you real?" Draco asks, reaching a chained arm out toward Harry as if he were a lighthouse out at sea. Harry doesn't have a chance to answer before the blonde man promptly loses consciousness. Harry barely makes it in time to catch him. He is simultaneously ecstatic to be touching the other man and appalled at how little he weighs. He casts enervate several times, but it doesn’t seem to do much for him. Damn his shitty medic skills!</p><p>In this moment Ron finally comes rushing over. "Good job mate, that was so fast! I've found nothing though, this case is going to prove a bit difficult for us--<em>shite</em>!" He stops dead at the sight before him. Harry is stood shaking like a leaf, holding a very tiny and very unconscious Draco Malfoy in his arms. They stare intently at each other before the red head finally asks-</p><p>"Is he alive?" To which Harry nods and lets out a slight sob. "How?" But Harry only shakes his head. </p><p>"I've cast an enervate twice now and it hasn't woken him. He is breathing but it's very shallow.” Harry is so worried and terrified that now that Draco is actually alive, he is just going to die on him again. </p><p>"Let’s get him to St. Mungo's right away," Ron starts. "Merlin almighty. How can this be? You saw him get ripped apart that day." Harry cringes at the memory. He shuts his eyes and squeezes Draco a little tighter.</p><p>"Harry, this is some kind of crazy dark magic..." Ron almost sounds as though he is in awe. Harry isn’t sure how he feels about that.</p><p>In an instant, both men Apparate to St. Mungo's. There is no time to deal with the mess they have left at the cottage. </p>
