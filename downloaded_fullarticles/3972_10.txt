<p>Lacy here peoples. As promised, this is the beginning of Heidi Lily Potter: Book Two. I decided, with each book, I'm gonna put a prologue at the beginning, just to catch everyone up on what's happened so far with Heidi. Sound good? Okay! So here we go!</p>
<p>Heidi Lily Potter is Harry Potter's younger sister by a year. As easily guessed by that one sentence, her life is anything but easy. She and her brother are being raised and cared for by Sirius Black, Remus Lupin and Nymphadora Tonks Lupin. Last story we watched as Heidi dealt with her brother going through his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.</p>
<p>Heidi's year was by no means a cake walk since she was living at the school along with their guardians as Sirius was one of the teachers. And it seemed every time Heidi helped her brother do something that was against the rules, she got in trouble.</p>
<p>Now it's Heidi's first year. She has to be sorted, make friends and try and deal with having Gilderoy Lockhart as a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. The wall paper would make a better teacher, according to Sirius.</p>
<p>But those what be the only problems she faces. No, there's something dark stirring within the school. Something sinister and it once again seems to be revolving around Harry. Heidi's question: Would they ever have a normal year at school?</p>
<p>Let's find out, shall we? Hit the shiny next button and sit back for one hell of a ride.</p>
