    <p>
  <span>Peter Pettigrew squeezed his way through the Leaky Cauldron, making an attempt to slip through the crowd without much success. He squeaked as he managed to push his way into Diagon Alley. He never did very well in crowds, they made him nervous. His eyes darted around the opening to the alley. He couldn’t spy his parents anywhere. Of course he’d lost them as soon as they arrived. He sighed and plopped down on a bench as he searched for any sign of them. He knew that if he continued walking, he’d just get himself more lost. Staying put was the smartest thing to do. That was what his parents always told him. Stay put and they’d find him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It was to be Peter’s fourth year at Hogwarts and he couldn’t wait. He loved school. Not the classes, as he tended to fall behind in almost all of them. Not the sports or clubs, as he never fit in with those or enjoyed them. He didn’t even particularly like most of the other students, as they would mock and belittle him. He really just missed his friends, Sirius, Remus, and James. Even when everyone else hated him, the three of them stuck by his side and would stand up for him. They made him feel important and cared for. They were a group that included him, who didn’t toss him out. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Just the thought of seeing them again made Peter feel warm and happy. He wondered if any of  them were coming to Diagon Alley at the same time as he was. He hoped so. He leaned against the bench, keeping an eye out for anyone he knew. He didn’t see his parents or his friends, but he spotted a young girl walking alone. She seemed to be lost and scared, wide eyes desperately searching the area. Her dress was yellow and decorated with beautiful, pink flowers. Peter watched as she wandered around, fingers fiddling with the bottom of her dress nervously. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She seemed to notice Peter staring and approached him slowly. She took a seat on the bench, her hands folded in her lap. She appeared to not be much younger than Peter, with brown hair falling to just her shoulders. Peter flushed when she sat beside him, not entirely sure how to react.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Are you lost?” He asked eventually, voice high-pitched and naturally whiny. She didn’t even look over at him. “Uh, hello?” He frowned when he was still met with no response. He looked down at the ground, not liking to be ignored.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He felt a tap on his shoulder and glanced up to see the girl peering at him through deep, green eyes. He stared at her, confused. She had made it pretty clear that she didn’t want to talk to him. He watched as she pulled out a sheet of paper and began writing. She smiled and handed the parchment over. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Peter took it and read it aloud. “Hello, my name is Wendla. I am Deaf. What’s your name?” He looked up, blinking. “Deaf?” He asked. “Like, you can’t hear?” When he was met with a blank stare, he assumed that he was correct. He accepted the writing utensil that Wendla handed to him and wrote his response. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“My name is Peter. I’ve never seen you before. Do you go to Hogwarts?” He wrote down before passing the paper back. He studied her as she read it, noticing how her eyes lit up and she smiled. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She looked up at him and nodded, putting the pencil back to the paper. “Yes! I’m muggleborn. I think that’s what you call it. This will be my first year. I was homeschooled before, but I managed to convince my mother to let me go to Hogwarts.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh, that’s really cool!” Peter wrote back. That would explain why he’d never seen her before. “What year are you going in to?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Third, I think.” Wendla smiled. “Although, if I don’t find my mother soon, she might think it’s too dangerous for me to go.” She pulled her lip in between her teeth. “She’s a bit overprotective.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Peter shook his head as he read. “She shouldn’t keep you from Hogwarts!” He insisted. “You can learn so much there!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I really want to go! I’ve never met anyone like me.” She explained, almost running out of room on the page. “I don’t even know anything about magic, really. My mother hasn’t let me use even a single spell.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Then how do you learn?” Peter was genuinely confused at this point. “If you’re home-schooled, but aren’t allowed to use spells, are you learning anything at all?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Mama taught me what some of the spells are.” She explained. “But she skips over the ones she thinks are too dangerous and she doesn’t tell me how to perform any of them. It’s really frustrating.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I can imagine why. Maybe if I see you at school, I can help you catch up? I’m not very good at magic, but I’d like to help!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’d love that! Tha-” Wendla looked down at the paper with a frown. She’d completely run out of space with which to write. She smiled at Peter and placed the tips of her fingers on her chin before outstretching her arm towards him. He blinked and watched as she repeated it. It took several more times for him to understand that she was attempting to show him sign language for thank you. He lit up and grinned. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You’re welcome!” He said aloud, despite knowing that she couldn’t hear him. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Peter!” A voice from the right called his name. He turned around to see his mother coming towards him, his father on her heels. “Where have you been? We’ve been looking everywhere for you!” She was using that baby voice that she always used when addressing him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I was right here, Mom.” Peter explained. “I got lost, so I found the nearest bench.” He was barely able to get the words out before he was swallowed by a smothering hug.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“We were so worried.” His father insisted. He glanced at Wendla. “Who is this?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“She’s…” Peter looked between her and his family. “A friend.” He said eventually. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>That seemed to pacify his parents. “Well, we need to look for your supplies.” His mother took his hand and pulled him to his feet. “Say goodbye, Peter.” She tugged him down the street without another word.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Peter looked behind himself at Wendla and waved to her with his free hand. He grinned as she smiled and waved back.</span>
