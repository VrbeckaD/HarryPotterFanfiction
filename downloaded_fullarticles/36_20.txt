    <p><em>When I close my eyes I see a great big dog, and eyes that sparkle green, like wet grass. I see pale skin like that of a ghost’s, and can hear the hissing of a snake. I can feel the Christmas spirit as sharply as I do the winter snow, and yet I always wake up sweating through my pyjamas. There are terrible screams, too, with words that I would never catch myself uttering aloud</em>.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>I prefer to keep my eyes open, even if it leaves me feeling very, very tired.</em>
</p><p> </p><p><em>Today, I had a pasta dish that Father said had wine in it. I didn’t like it very much, but ate it all because I forgot to come down for lunch in the afternoon. I’d accidentally fallen asleep in the library, after reading all morning. Dobby had found me a new book, you see</em>...</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>... A young Draco finishes the <em>Y</em> in ‘Malfoy’ with a flick on the tail. He licks his lips, pleased with his work, and stands up to show his father.</p><p> </p><p>It’s late in the evening, and he’s eight-years-old. The night before, he’d had Mother read him the start of Dracula again, even though it usually kept him awake for hours, afterwards. He quite liked the idea of writing about his days in a journal, and had done so as soon as he got his hands on an empty notebook that morning.</p><p> </p><p>He’d written about his dreams, and his nightmares. They’re usually just flashes of stuff, like brown hands and dark corridors, but they still make him uncomfortable. Draco hopes that writing about them will get rid of them, cause he’d prefer to have a satisfying night of sleep every once and awhile.</p><p> </p><p>“Father,” Draco says, staring up at the man. “I’ve finished my journal log.”</p><p> </p><p>“Show it to me,” he replies, looking up from the newspaper in his hands. Draco shuffles up onto the lounge beside him, and places the diary onto his lap. “It’s very long.”</p><p> </p><p>“I have a lot to say.”</p><p> </p><p>“Indeed,” his father says, sounding amused. His eyes dart across the paper, lip curling at some parts, before finally shutting the book with a strange look in his eyes. “I thought you were going to write about your day.”</p><p> </p><p>Draco fiddles with his small hands. “I was going to, but my day was <em>bore</em>-ing! So I wrote about my dream last night.”</p><p> </p><p>Lucius tilts his head, opens the book up again, and reads it over once more. “This is from your dreams? Not those books you insist on getting read to you?”</p><p> </p><p>He nods.</p><p> </p><p>“Well, then.” His father pauses, and doesn’t speak for a long, long time. “That’s... alright. The only criticism I have is that you forgot to date it.”</p><p> </p><p>“Huh?”</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Pardon</em>,” Lucius corrects, absently. “You need to put the date at the beginning of each log, otherwise how will you know when you wrote it? Like today..” he trails off, and taps his wand on the paper. Ink sinks into the page. “is December twelve.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry, I forgot.”</p><p> </p><p>His father nods, and reaches out to run a hand through Draco’s white hair. “It’s very promising, otherwise.”</p><p> </p><p>Just as Draco goes to reply, the fireplace roars and his mother steps out, not a single hair out-of-place. Magic, he supposes, is good for even little things like that. “Hello, darling. Lucius,” she says, “My dinner went on longer than I expected. I hope I haven’t kept you both up waiting.”</p><p> </p><p>Draco climbs onto her lap as soon as she sits down, despite being almost nine now. He’s never really bought into the whole ‘growing up thing’ - he’d much rather stay young forever, because then he’d never get called a baby for actually liking his parents.</p><p> </p><p>“Our son was just showing me his first diary entry.” His father leans forward to look at Narcissa better. Draco’s whole face is starting to feel heavy. “He wrote about his dreams. I thought you said they had stopped?”</p><p> </p><p>That didn’t sound right, he thinks. Draco doesn’t remember any other dreams - they’d only started recently. His mother starts rubbing his back, making him yawn.</p><p> </p><p>“They had.” Their voices sound too quiet, but not in the whispery way. More like Draco was underwater, and couldn’t make out their words. “At least he’s not waking up screaming, anymore. Perhaps—“</p><p> </p><p>Draco’s mother was always so warm. He cuddled closer to her chest, let out a content hum, and fell asleep. He seemed to be doing that a lot, lately.</p>
