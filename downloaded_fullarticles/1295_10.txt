          <div class="userstuff"><p>Hermione yawned and stretched in a luxurious bed. Her hand accidentally found a warm body next to hers. Becoming fully awake, she picked up the black silken sheets finding herself arouse.<br/>
On further inspection, she saw a diamond ring on her finger.  She bolted upright and tried to think of what happened the night before.<br/>
<i>I must remember. What did I do?</i> she glanced at the stranger who she had supposedly married.<br/>
<i> Not to bad looking. A bit older…” </i>her thoughts trailed off as she glanced around the bedroom. <i> Apparently well off.</i></p><p>
  His hand stretched and pulled her a bit closer to his sleeping form. She stifled a yelp.  She was frantically trying to remember what the hell happened to her to wind up like this.<br/>
Not that she minds marrying the strange, good looking older man next to her. She wished that she could remember the marriage ceremony.<br/>

“Mrs. Gold, you are overthinking the situation.” His voice rumbled as he was starting to wake up.
</p><p>
 “You have magic. How did we…” her voice tapered off as he kissed her.
</p><p>
  “I didn’t hear any complaints last night, love. We had a bit too much to drink. And yes, I have magic. I come from the Enchanted Forest and living in your world due to a curse. My real name is Rumplestiltskin.”
</p><p>
 Hermione’s eyebrows furrowed suspiciously. “Did I make any deals with you?”
</p><p>
 “No, dearest. We found each other. You are my soulmate, apparently.”
</p><p>
  She huffed, pushed the sheets away from her body when she got up, she felt a pull of magic.
</p><p>
  “AH, yes then there’s that.”
</p><p>
 Hermione looked at her wrist, seeing an intricate Scottish knot rune.
</p><p>
 “I assume you have one as well?”
</p><p>
  Rumple causally showed his wrist off. “We need to be in complete approximately to each other.”
</p><p>
 “Well, this is making things a bit difficult. I have a job at the ministry of magic!”
</p><p>
 “Couldn’t you transfer here? And open up a potions/library shop next to mine?” Rumple suggested as he stretched out the kinks.
</p><p>
  She flopped back on the pillows, allowing him to snuggle up to her. “You do have a library?”
</p><p>
 “Let’s get dressed, dearie and I’ll show you what I have.”
</p><p>
  They showered, dressed as he covered Hermione’s eyes. “I want to surprise you, my dear!”<br/>
Hermione let him show her the way blindfolded by his hands. “I hope its…” she was amazed at his library, which covered an entire room.<br/>
“Plus, there’s more.” He touched a book that leads to a secret room full of books as well.
</p><p>
 "All right, you convinced me! Where am I exactly? I need to get back to London.”
</p><p>
  “You are in Storybrooke, Maine. And if you need to Floo back to your place, here is a fireplace.”
</p><p>
  Hermione thanked her husband and kissed him before she left to gather her things.
</p><p>
  Rumple stared at the fireplace a part of him hoping she’ll come back.  When the fireplace turned green and out stepped Hermione, along with, a cat carrier.
</p><p>
  Rumple’s eyebrows curiously rose as she let her kneazle cat, Snowy out. “I couldn’t leave him behind. Losing my cat Crookshanks last year really hit me hard.”<br/>
Snowy sniffed the place over and went over to Rumplestiltskin. He head-butts his hand and rolled over to his side.<br/>
“Well it’s settled, we’re staying,” Hermione announced watching the kneazle bond with her husband.
