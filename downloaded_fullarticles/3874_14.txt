  <span>The first written account of using </span>
  <span>medicine</span>
  <span> and </span>
  <span>entomology</span>
  <span> to solve criminal cases is attributed to the book of </span>
  <span>Xi Yuan Lu</span>
  <span> (translated as </span>

</p><p> </p><p>Millicent Bulstrode scooped up the edges of her camel skin coat and squatted next to the body with a frown on her usually solemn face. She tilted her head from one side to the next, her jet black hair shifting along her back as she took in every detail.</p><p> </p><p>Using a pen, she gently lifted the ugly knit tea cozy away from the face of the old woman and grimaced at the look of pure suffering the woman's visage seemed to have been frozen in.</p><p> </p><p>She let the tea cozy fall back into place, straightening up and taking a careful step back. Her booty covered low heels made no mark on the threadbare rug as she walked the grid, taking in the minute details of the scene. Finally, she signaled to one of the baby faced officers and he flipped open a small notebook and began to read from it.</p><p> </p><p>"Martha Cadogan-Leftage. Squib. 98 years old. Retired school teacher at the Squib school…"</p><p> </p><p>"St. Marcel's" Millicent corrected absently.</p><p> </p><p>"St. Marcel's." The officer echoed, subtly rolling his eyes at the officer standing next to him. "Only child of parents Lubinia Privance -Cadogan and Uther Leftage of the Gatsing-Leftages. No kids of her own. Just ten cats and one parakeet. Last seen alive yesterday morning on her usual walk around the hamlet when she noses into everyone's business."</p><p> </p><p>He flipped a page of the note book. "When the shop girl didn't see her come in for her usual pack of ciggies and scratch cards, she came round and found her like this. Scared the poor girl summat awful."</p><p> </p><p>Millicent took in the desperate sprawl of the body, the clawed hands, broken and bloody fingernails, the jagged scratches at her face and throat as if she were trying to claw at whatever was in her throat and chest. This poor woman had met a horrible end.</p><p> </p><p>She glanced at the tea service that had been knocked over in her final throes, her sharp eyes devouring every detail.</p><p> </p><p>"Have forensics take the tea set as well."</p><p> </p><p>"Why?" the officer asked baldly, only to flush when she looked at him. "I mean… for what purpose madam?"</p><p> </p><p>She nodded at his look of chagrin. She often encouraged her underlings to ask questions as she'd rather have them they ask her for guidance than bumble ahead in error.</p><p> </p><p>"There are no marks on the body. That rules out stabbing, strangling, being shot with a gun. That leaves asphyxiation, spell work or poison. Tea was also set for two so that means someone was with the victim between the time she was last seen and the time she was discovered. That person is either a witness or our killer. The tea set may give us some clue to their identity."</p><p> </p><p>Both officers nodded with new understanding, writing ferociously in their little notepads. Millicent suppressed a smirk and looked back at the body.</p><p> </p><p>A scuffle outside drew her attention to the window and its lace trim and she pulled the handmade lace aside,  cursing under her breath.</p><p> </p><p>"What the hell are they doing here?"</p><p> </p><p>The officer guarding the gate was trying in vain to stop two Aurors from entering the crime scene, their blood red dragon skin robes vibrant in the English sun.</p><p> </p><p>"What are you doing here Potter?" Millicent raised an eyebrow, striding towards them with her hands shoved into her pockets. "This is Muggle Affairs business."</p><p> </p><p>Potter pasted a barely polite smirk on his stupidly handsome face, making it look more condescending than attractive. But then again she'd always been turned off completely by his tendency to be a douchebag.</p><p> </p><p>"A murdered Witch makes it Auror business."</p><p> </p><p>With that declaration, Potter shouldered his way past the guard to meet her in the middle of the unkept garden. Apparently the old woman had been more interested in what happened in other people yards than her own.</p><p> </p><p>His redheaded menace, Weasley, shoved in a step or two behind. "Yeah Bully, "He sneered, "We have seniority."</p><p> </p><p>Millicent gave him a flat once over. She'd hated that name since Hogwarts but the last ten years had given her a much thicker skin. That sort of thing just rolled off her now like water off a duck's back.</p><p> </p><p>"Weasley… " she sniffed. "Still tucked under Potter's ball sack like a good little toady? I thought  that you'd have been promoted to cock warmer by now?"</p><p> </p><p>The guard at the gate hacked into his fist, trying poorly to cover a snort as Weasley went lobster red. Potter grabbed him by the robes and yanked him back as he tried to lunge forward but it looked to be a struggle to keep him in place.</p><p> </p><p>"Now listen here you snake fucking bitch…" Weasley snarled, his mouth looked rabid with covered in that much spittle.</p><p> </p><p>"Ron!" Potter snapped, grabbing his partner with both hands and yanking him back a few steps further. "Calm the fuck down mate."</p><p> </p><p>"Yes Ron." a new voice came from the corner of the house, it was charmed to be unisex and unidentifiable. "Calm. The. Fuck. Down."</p><p> </p><p>An Unspeakable came around the corner of the house, the voluminous robes and shadowed hood at odds with the riot of colour that was the garden.</p><p> </p><p>Both Potter and Weasley froze.</p><p> </p><p>"Herm…" Weasley began before Potter slammed a hand over his mouth.</p><p> </p><p>Millicent hid her shock behind her practices Slytherin façade. Granger was an Unspeakable. She looked at the shadowed hood, trying to reconcile the bookish know-it all with the menacing figure that stood before her.</p><p> </p><p>The figure seemed to glare at the red head from beneath the cloak. "Weasley, I warned you that the next time you tried that shite, I would obliviate you back to nappies and let Molly deal with you all over again."</p><p> </p><p>Weasley looked apoplectic while Potter looked suitable chastised on his friends behalf. "I'll take him to the Oblivators myself, Crow."</p><p> </p><p>Weasley sputtered some more, peppering Potter robe with spittle at the very suggestion, staring agog at this longtime partner and friend.</p><p> </p><p>"See that you do." Crow nodded. "What is your purpose here Auror Potter? Muggle Affairs was called in to investigate this case."</p><p> </p><p>Potter cleared his throat, all business, while the red head still sputtered stupidly behind him. "We got a call from the Magical Legacy Archive. The victim was the last of two very old and venerable lines, both which are in danger of fading away. They were concerned about line theft.</p><p> </p><p>Millicent raised an eyebrow. "Line theft? The victime was a squib. The line would have automatically jumped to the next magical relative once she was passed child bearing age."</p><p> </p><p>Potter nodded, "Usually yes, but some of the old families had a clause in their legacies. 'Nam postquam Res'."</p><p> </p><p>"After the Fact of the Matter?" Crow translated. "I thought that was outlawed in 1753, after one of the royal family married a squib and wanted his children to inherit her fortune."</p><p> </p><p>Millicent rolled her eyes. Trust Granger to pull information about obscure and outdated legal clauses out of her arse. She should have been sorted into fucking Ravenclaw.</p><p> </p><p>"Well, then…" she said before they started a study group right there in the bloody garden. "First things first. Is this my scene or not?"</p><p> </p><p>She looked at Crow who nodded. "Yes, Muggle Affairs has jurisdiction. I'll be in touch for updates."</p><p> </p><p>She looked at Potter. "I'll take it up with Legacy and see if their concerns pan out."</p><p> </p><p>Potter nodded, albeit reluctantly. <br/>  </p><p>"Okay then…" Millicent clapped her hands together. "… if you would all please bugger off and let me do my job that would be fantastic."</p><p> </p><p>Potter scowled, finally grabbing his still gibbering partner and turning on his heel, no doubt side-apparating straight to the Obliviators. Crow turned the hood to face her.</p><p> </p><p>"Do the Obliviators need to pay you a visit as well Bulstrode?"</p><p> </p><p>The voice was deep and menacing but Millicent smirked in the face of it. "Mum's the word, Unspeakable Crow. We of the Snake House know how to keep a secret."</p><p> </p><p>She could practically hear Grangers raising a skeptical brow. "For a price of course?"</p><p> </p><p>The former Slytherin smiled coquettishly. "Don't worry Crow. It won't be too bad. I don't want to wake up one day snatched from my bed and shoved through the veil in my nightie."</p><p> </p><p>It was telling how Granger didn't automatically deny that that kind of thing happened. Maybe the girl had grown some teeth after all.</p><p> </p><p>"I'll expect your report." Crow finally said and apparated away silently.</p><p> </p><p>Millicent stared at the spot where the hooded figure had stood for a few moments before turning and stomping back into the house. She had a case to solve.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>
