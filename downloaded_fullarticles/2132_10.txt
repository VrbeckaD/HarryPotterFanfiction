    <p>“Sweetie?” Bellatrix heard someone say, it sounded as if they where standing over her, opening her eyes she saw that she had been right. She was now looking into her beautiful better half.</p><p>“Why are you waking me up at this unholy hour muddy?” she asked, holding a stern look.</p><p>“Unholy hour? It’s almost two, were you really planning on spending the entire day in bed?” Hermione asked her.</p><p>“I hadn’t, but now that you mention it,” Bellatrix turned on her side looking away from Hermione, “Gonna take a quick nap.”</p><p>“Un-believable,” she heard the girl say on the side of the bed. Visualising the smile that was most definably on her face, she turned back on her back to face her.</p><p>Suddenly the bedsheet started to levitate up and wrapped around her.</p><p>“Hermione, what are you doing?” she yelled out before her hands where restrained to the side of body. She couldn’t get to her wand so she was at the bidding of whatever Hermione had planned for her. but it couldn’t be that bad she though. How she had end up with a literal angel was still beyond her.</p><p>‘how had it happened,’ she suddenly though, a sharp pain suddenly shot through her forehead.</p><p>“Arggg.” She yelled out.</p><p>“Are you okay?” Hermione asked, concerned as always.</p><p>“Just a headache,” she told her not wanting to interrupt the morning that she had planned for them. They had always had fun when they were together. She honestly couldn’t remember a time that they had been apart.</p><p>Being floated into their kitchen was something that she hadn’t experienced yet, but she liked it. She wondered if she should ask Hermione if this could become her preferred form of transport. Floating in a blanket, laid out like a Roman empress.</p><p>Before she could ask, Hermione had placed her in a chair and released her.</p><p>“Would you like some pancakes?” she was asked.</p><p>“You know that I’m always up for some packsacks, pet.”</p><p>“that’s good, I made some earlier…”</p><p align="center">-</p><p>“Who’s she talking to?” one of the new guards asked.</p><p>“Oh her,” the old guard said, “Lestrange? When Voldemort was defeated something snapped in her. I’ve been told that she vacated her mind, wend into complete denial and started seeing faces and hearing voices. About five months ago she started mentioning Hermione. We think that she is talking to a made-up version of late Minister Granger.”</p><p>Looking back at the prisoner, he felt a slight amount of pity for her. before he remembered the myriad of people that she had tortured or killed. “Serves her right.”</p>
