    <p>~*~*~Chapter 1 ~*~*~</p><p> </p><p>Draco knew that it was a mistake to have come back to Hogwarts.  He was among only a small group of his fellow Slytherins from his former class who had either wanted to return… or been allowed.  Many of them had fought on the losing side during the war and so weren’t welcome.</p><p> </p><p>He had definitely been on the wrong side, but McGonnagal had personally come to the Manor to invite him to return.  She’d stood up for him at his trial…</p><p> </p><p>She and Potter…</p><p> </p><p>He shoved a hand back through his white-blonde hair and cursed as he pulled his book-bag a little higher onto his shoulder and continued on toward the dungeons and his potions lesson.  He’d thanked McGonnagal when she’d come to offer his return to school but then he’d fully intended to ignore it and return to his hiding (and there was no other word for it) in the Manor, only planning emerge when the world had stopped flashing pictures of a certain Savior at every turn.  Hell, he’d even considered the horror of leaving England for some backwards place like America just to be completely away from it.</p><p> </p><p>But then his Mother had stepped in.  She’d begged him to return to school.  She’d cited all of the various hopes and dreams that she’d had for him.  She’d told him that he had a responsibility as a Malfoy to complete his education and make something of himself.  She’d even cried.</p><p> </p><p>His mother was more manipulative than any creature he’d ever known… except she did it out of love, which made it ten-times-worse.</p><p> </p><p>Sighing to himself, Draco turned and started down the corridor toward a class that he knew was going to be complete torture, when he was stopped in his tracks at the sound of a struggle and an all-too-familiar voice shouting out right before a door slammed shut. </p><p> </p><p>~Ignore it Malfoy.  Ignore it because it’s not your bloody business and you have more important things to do and you shouldn’t get involved and-~</p><p> </p><p>His feet apparently operated independently of his internal, very <em>logical</em> thoughts, however, because he was already heading to the door, wand out.  He didn’t hear anything but any idiot planning to attack someone would know to put up a silencing charm.  He tried the handle but found that the door had also been locked.  A quick alohomora and he was inside…</p><p> </p><p>He hadn’t even known that it was possible for someone’s blood to run cold while simultaneously burning with rage, but apparently it was…</p><p> </p><p>Nott, Zabini and Bulstrode had hold of the Savior of the Wizarding World and had him shoved against a wall.  Nott was grinning maliciously and had his wand under the other man’s chin while Zabini caressed his hand along Potter’s cheek in an almost-gentle way, though the expression on the handsome Wizard’s face was anything but kind.  And Bulstrode was caressing her hands along his chest in a way that sent shivers down Draco’s back, her eyes absolutely filled with hatred and bloodlust.</p><p> </p><p>Hearing the door open, Zabini turned his head, lifting his wand in preparation for an attack.  At the sight of Draco, however, he smirked and said, “Well well well… and here I thought anyone who pushed their way through that door would be one of Potter’s loyal followers.”  He turned back to Harry and nuzzled his cheek almost affectionately as he said, “But instead, we get the Ice Prince of Slytherin, come to get a little revenge for dear-old-daddy.”</p><p> </p><p>Nott laughed and leaned forward to bite at Harry’s neck, though not in a way to draw blood or hurt him.  In fact, it was almost a lover-like nibble.  “Well, maybe not <em>just</em> for dear-old-daddy hmm?”  He turned his head to look at Draco while he ran his free hand down Harry’s chest and stomach, purring, “After all, we all know how much you’d <em>love</em> to have this one on his knees for you, right there Dracy?”  He laughed harshly and slid his hand down to Harry’s cock, squeezing through his trousers and causing the other man to gasp and… what the hell… moan?  “Mmm… well you’ll never find him more ah…” Nott looked at his cohorts and grinned, “interested.”  He smirked and looked back at Draco, “<em>Begging</em> for it in fact, aren’t you Potter?”</p><p> </p><p>Mouth hanging open like a fish out of water, Draco simply stood there and gaped.  He didn’t <em>mean</em> to play guppy, he just… <em>why</em> wasn’t Potter fighting back?  Sure he was struggling a little, moving around, but he wasn’t actually fighting them.  In fact he looked-</p><p> </p><p>Draco felt his blood run cold as he said breathlessly, “W-what did you do to him?”</p><p> </p><p>Bulstrode grinned and glanced back at him with a vicious look in her too-small-eyes, smirking as she said, “Oh don’t worry Draco, he’ll enjoy every <em>minute</em> of what we’re about to do to him.”  She shifted forward to rub her hips against Harry, yanking his shirt open and running her tongue along his chest in a way that had Draco’s skin crawling in sympathy.  “Mmm… won’t you Potter?”</p><p> </p><p>Draco watched as Harry closed those far-too-green eyes and gave his head a hard shake before he began to struggle against the men holding him, bringing a knee up to slam into Millicent’s stomach and sending her reeling backward.  “Get off me,” he finally said, though not in the snarling shout that Draco would have expected, “Get off!”  In fact, his attempts to remove his attackers were weak at best and his movements sluggish.   His eyes slid back open and locked onto Draco and there was something in them…</p><p> </p><p>And Draco had finally seen enough.  He lifted the wand that had fallen to his side in his shock and from one second to the next, he was doing what no sane Slytherin with an ounce of self-preservation would do.  He was hitting his former friends with hexes, knocking them back off of Potter, and rushing forward to grab the other man around the waist before yanking him out of the room.</p><p> </p><p>Draco tried to figure out what the hell to do now that he’d done this because obviously there was something wrong with the Boy Who Lived and he needed to get help… not to mention he needed to find somewhere to hide before his former-cohorts ripped him apart.  He thought about trying to take him to the potions classroom but before he could turn in that direction, the door he’d slammed behind him was bursting open and Nott was rushing out.  He cursed and fired a hex over his shoulder before hissing, “Come on Potter!” and racing down the corridor and away from their pursuers. </p><p> </p><p>Running without a specific destination in mind, Draco kept going, clinging to Potter who was half draped over his shoulder, and trying to think of somewhere to go to get the damned bane of his existence safe.  It didn’t help that the other man was stumbling and seemed barely coherent.  Cursing low in his throat, Draco managed to hit Bulstrode with a Patrificus Totalus which caused the other two to stumble over her prone form.  Turning a corner, Draco raced down a hallway and past several sets of doors, trying any of them until he finally found one that opened.  He raced inside and shoved it closed, snapping the lock shut before falling back against the door.  Breathing as though he’d run a race… which essentially he <em>had,</em> he was trying to think of what in Merlin’s name to do next when he heard the pounding of footsteps in the corridor outside.  Fuck fuck fuck!!!</p><p> </p><p>“C-cloak,” came a husky voice from nearby.  Draco jumped at the sound only to realize that Potter, who’d fallen to his knees beside him, was speaking.</p><p> </p><p>“What?” Draco hissed, his back still against the door.</p><p> </p><p>“My… cloak… in my pocket… Put it… round us… should-“</p><p> </p><p>Draco was already moving.  He shoved his hand into the chosen one’s trouser pocket… and felt his face flush when he felt the side of a considerable arousal brush his hand when he did so and heard the other man suck in a breath.  He put all that to the back of his head and felt around in what felt like an undetectable extension charm until his fingers came across something silky.  He snatched it up and yanked Potter forward and under a desk slightly down the aisle before he flipped the cloak open and spread it over them both, checking to make certain that there was nothing showing before huddling close to the man who never seemed to <em>not</em> cause him trouble…</p><p> </p><p>He was just in time because seconds later the door burst open and footsteps rushed in.  He heard a frantic search as their pursuers checked under every desk and actually put a hand over his own mouth and Harry’s when Blaise’s dark face appeared in front of the desk where they were hiding, checking for them.  He was so close that they were almost nose to nose, close enough for Draco to make out the slight hint of discolouration where Blaise had fallen and smudged the powder he wore (bloody fop).  Draco held his breath his hand tightened over both his own and Harry’s mouths, praying that the cloak worked as well now as it had when he’d caught Harry wearing it before… </p><p> </p><p>And then in the next second the dark skinned Wizard was gone.  Blaise rushed to the next desk and the next before shouting, “They’re not here, let’s try the next room!” and rushing out with the others.  Draco didn’t dare to breathe until the door slammed behind them, his hand still over his and Harry’s mouths as he listened to the echo of the footsteps rushing away down the corridor…</p><p> </p><p>Right up until he distinctly felt the sensation of lips caressing along his palm and turned his head to see Harry-Savior-Of-Us-All-Potter… sodding <em>nuzzling</em> his palm where it lay against his mouth…</p><p> </p><p>What the actual fuck…</p><p> </p><p>Draco’s silver eyes widened in shock and he turned to Potter to see that there was only a hint of that Dragon’s green around the edges of his blown pupils.  His expression, what Draco could see of it behind his own pale, slim fingers, was almost… hungry.</p><p> </p><p>And it was around the time that he realized this fact that he also realized he still had his hand there was rather enjoying the nuzzling more than he should…</p><p> </p><p>Quickly yanking his slender hand down (from his own mouth as well, <em>damn</em> but he was smooth) he quickly rubbed his tingling palm against his trousers and said in a shaky voice, “They’ve… they’ve gone.  But we should probably give them a few moments before we-“</p><p> </p><p>He didn’t get a chance to finish saying what their next move would be because from one second to the next he was laying under an invisibility cloak with his arms full of a moaning Harry Potter who seemed to have no other desire in this life than to stick his tongue down Draco Malfoy’s throat.</p><p> </p><p>For a second he just laid there, silver eyes wide with shock and lips unmoving beneath the apparent desperation of the other man’s… and then his brain caught up with the rest of the situation and he gasped into Potter’s mouth, shaking his head slightly as he tried to lift his hands between them to ward the other man off.</p><p> </p><p>Except that Harry took his gasp as an invitation and his tongue slipped between Draco’s lips the second that they parted, instantly making itself at home by teasing and caressing along his own with a lithe certainty that tasted entirely too fucking delicious.  The gasp turned into a moan and for a second, just a second, Draco melted against the man whom he’d been in love with for years.  His hand slid up and his fingers twined into those untameable black curls which were even softer than he’d dreamed, a soft whimper of pleasure escaping him before he could stop it…</p><p> </p><p>And then he remembered that this was Harry Sodding Potter, Boy-Who-Lived-To-Hate-Draco-Malfoy… and there was no logical reason whatsoever that he’d even <em>touch</em> Draco, let alone snog him senseless.</p><p> </p><p>Pushing his hands forward, he managed to get them between himself and Harry and pushed him back gently but firmly.  They were both panting as though they’d been racing through the corridors again and Draco had no doubt that his own pupils were now as blown as Potter’s, his lips no doubt just as kiss-swollen, his face just as deliciously flushed and-</p><p> </p><p>He gave himself a firm mental shake and quit starring at the far-too-tempting image Potter presented as he scrambled backward, dislodging the cloak from them both as he tried to get his feet under him and said, “P-Potter what… what do you… have you gone bloody mad?!  What’s-“</p><p> </p><p>Potter whimpered and tried to follow him, gasping, “Draco… Gods… Draco <em>please</em>…” as he scrabbled at Draco’s shirt and tried to pull him right back into him.</p><p> </p><p>Seriously… what the <em>actual</em> fuck?!?!</p><p> </p><p>Trying desperately to ignore the way that hearing his first name on Harry’s lips affected him, Draco managed to push himself to his feet and back away until he felt a desk hit him in the ass and nearly toppled over it.  Pin wheeling his arms in a rather undignified fashion, he managed to keep his feet under him and said, “I… Potter what is wrong with you?  Have you… no, no stop, stop that!” he suddenly shouted, eyes wide with horror when he found Harry, who’d also gotten to his own feet, pursuing him and trying to yank on his shirt and pull him right back into his body.  “Potter!  What in the name of Merlin’s saggy tits do you think you’re doing?!”</p><p> </p><p>“So hot…” the suddenly-insane-Savior gasped, his hands pushing aside Draco’s every attempt to stop them.  “Need… need to feel you… need to touch you Draco <em>please</em>… Gods please touch me <em>please</em>!” he begged.</p><p> </p><p>Right.  So Draco had fallen asleep in class and was having a very <em>vivid</em> wet dream.  It wasn’t like the dragon-eyed-boy hadn’t featured in every bloody wet dream he’d had since he’d started having the damned things, but still, this was new.  It was so tactile, so unbelievably <em>real</em>, so-</p><p> </p><p>Harry’s hands managed to grip his shirt and give it a good yank, splitting it open and sending buttons pinging and ponging around the room and Draco gave a shocked gasp as lips were suddenly on him, working desperately from the base of his now-very-askew-tie and down along his chest hungrily.</p><p> </p><p>Fuck fuck fuck!!</p><p> </p><p>Closing his eyes against the pleasure and swallowing over the mountain currently lodged in his throat (not to mention the erection that was trying to take over every ounce of bloodflow to his brain) Draco managed to get hold of the other man’s shoulders and push him back, saying, “Potter you… what… this isn’t…”</p><p> </p><p>And then he remembered what Nott and Bulstrode had said, <em>“…well you’ll never find him more ah… interested. Begging for it in fact, aren’t you Potter?”</em>…<em>“Oh don’t worry Draco, he’ll enjoy every minute of what we’re about to do to him. Mmm… won’t you Potter?”</em></p><p> </p><p><em>Feralis Concitatio</em>… a curse favoured by rapists.  It made the victim more than just willing, it made them <em>desperate</em> for sex.  Even the vilest and most disgusting of people would be acceptable because all that mattered was sating the need for pleasure and coupling.  Draco only knew about it because his Godfather had warned him a few of the Snatchers favoured the curse back during the war and wouldn’t really care that he was a Malfoy and marked to boot.</p><p> </p><p>He’d never taught him how to remove it if you got hit though…</p><p> </p><p>Moving sideways along the table to try to get away from Potter’s desperate hands, Draco licked his lips and said, “O-ok Potter it’s… look it’ll be alright.  You just need to… you’re not exactly yourself right now.”</p><p> </p><p>“Draco,” Harry begged, now yanking at his own shirt since Draco kept pushing his hands away to stop his attempts to remove Draco’s.  He was following the blonde step for step, staying as close as possible so that there was no room for Draco to catch a breath. “Draco <em>please</em>… please I… I need you,” he begged.</p><p> </p><p>Licking his lips and closing his eyes against what that sight and those words did to him, Draco said, “I… you <em>think</em> you need me Potter but,” he managed a weak laugh, “<em>trust me</em>, you’ll not exactly be feeling the same once that curse wears off.  In fact you might just try to kill me… then yourself… then probably me again, aye?” </p><p> </p><p>Harry had now yanked his shirt and tie off and was back to trying to get to Draco’s clothes.</p><p> </p><p>Trying to hold his shirt together, Draco continued to scrabble backward and said, “It’s a curse Potter.  A truly vile curse, ok?  It… it’ll be alright.  We just need to get you to hospital wing or… or even one of the Professors or mmph-“</p><p> </p><p>His words were cut off because he suddenly found himself pinned against the wall with a hungry set of Gryffindor lips moving against his own while a body he’d dreamed of for so-fucking-long writhed against his in all the best ways.  A soft whimper escaped him and Gods help him, he melted into that fucking kiss again.  Lips opening with a soft sound of desperation, he allowed Harry’s far-too-talented-tongue to duel with his own.  Surely for just a moment it was alright… it wasn’t like he’d ever get to know what the man tasted like any other way… it couldn’t possibly be so bad to-</p><p> </p><p>He cursed himself for a vile, disgusting thing and yanked his mouth away, trying to push the other Wizard away from him (though even he had to admit, it was a weak damned attempt and he knew it).  “Potter you… you’re not in your right mind,” he half begged.  “I… we <em>can’t</em>.  You <em>hate me</em> remember?  I’ll… I’ll get the Weaslette… Ginny… we’ll… we’ll get her and-”</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t hate you…” Harry said, trying to get closer.  “Never hate… Gods please… please I don’t care about a curse… I don’t <em>want</em> Ginny I just…” his hands were pulling at Draco’s shirt, managing to get it down off his shoulders until it was hanging at his wrists by the only buttons left to the bloody thing.  “Gods please help me Draco… so hot…” his eyes looked pleadingly into Draco’s and his expression was one of near-pain as he begged, “<em>Please</em>… I need you…”  He slid in against the blonde again and began to kiss along his bared chest, down along his stomach, “I’ll make it so good for you… <em>please</em>…”</p><p> </p><p>Draco was fast losing all of his ability to think straight.  The only thing he could focus on was those lips and the heat of the body pressing against his.  A body he’d wanted for so fucking long and never been allowed to have… The man that he loved and could never touch and he wanted <em>him</em>…</p><p> </p><p>And he also knew, thanks to Snape’s little lesson on the <em>Feralis Concitatio</em> curse, that Harry’s blood would be boiling inside of him.  It would be screaming at him and making him literally <em>hurt</em> with the need to feel someone else inside of him.  Because that was the way that the curse worked.  And the longer you denied it, the more it ate away at you until you could literally die unless you gave in to it and, thereby, the disgusting creature who’d put it on you.</p><p> </p><p>“Need… need to get… hospital… counter-curse I-“ Draco tried, his voice going softer and huskier by the second as Harry’s hands kept roaming his chest and down along his hips, across his ass.  His head fell back against the blackboard behind him and he tried knocking it again a second time, tried to keep his wits about him as he said, “Even… your friends… someone… <em>help</em>…”</p><p> </p><p>He wasn’t sure if he was talking about Harry… or pleading for the last of his own willpower because in the next second he was catching hold of the sides of Harry’s face and yanking him up so that he could find that delicious, oh-so-perfect mouth again…</p><p> </p><p>He rationalized to himself that he was helping Harry…  If he didn’t give in to his need then he’d die a very painful death.  He rationalized that this was all <em>not</em> his fault… <em>he</em> hadn’t put the damned curse on the Savior…</p><p> </p><p>And then Harry’s hand slid down into his pants and all rationalization disappeared from his mind as the first wave of exquisite pleasure danced through him at the sensation of Potter’s strong, callused fingers wrapping around his cock.  He jerked and moaned into Harry’s mouth, his hips rocking forward of their own volition as he cried out in pleasure. And Harry drank his cries like a man drowning, his tongue moving hungrily against Draco’s as he licked and nuzzled him while his hand stroked an already rampant need even higher…</p><p> </p><p>“Please Draco,” Harry moaned into his mouth, “No one else… don’t want… never wanted anaone else… just you…”</p><p> </p><p>The song of a siren could be no more beautiful to Draco’s ears.  No one else.  Just him.  <em>He</em> was all that Potter wanted.  <em>He</em> was all that the beautiful, all-too-perfect man needed. </p><p> </p><p>And even though it wasn’t real, in that moment, Draco could pretend that it was…</p><p> </p><p>“Harry…” Draco whimpered as his mouth moved desperately down the other man’s throat.  “Gods Harry… please…”</p><p> </p><p>He didn’t even know what he was pleading for anymore. </p><p> </p><p>Harry told him seconds later by dropping to his knees in front of the blonde.  His hand slid out of Draco’s pants but before Draco could even manage to mourn the loss of sensation, his trousers were being undone and slid down his slim hips.  He gasped when the cold air danced over his throbbing cock, some sense returning with the cold shock of sensation and he opened his mouth to say that they needed to find someone who could remove the curse or <em>at least</em> get the damned git to his annoying little Gryffindor girlfriend-</p><p> </p><p>When those far-too-delectable lips were suddenly wrapped around Draco’s cock and all thought of allowing <em>anyone</em> else near Harry at that moment became an anathema to his very existence.  His knees went weak and he would have fallen if Harry’s large, warm hands hadn’t been cupping his ass and kneading it.  He was holding Draco up so that he could work his cock with his mouth as though it were the most delectable thing he’d ever tasted and sweet mother of Merlin, <em>how</em> did a heterosexual man like Potter learn to do <em>that</em> so fucking well?! </p><p> </p><p>Draco’s hands scrabbled for purchase and he finally managed to grab hold of the chalk tray just to keep himself upright.  He looked down through lust-heavy-lids at the sight of Harry on his knees, working his cock hungrily as he hollowed out his cheeks and sucked hard, drawing him in deeper and bobbing his head back and forth…</p><p> </p><p>No sight had ever been more erotic.  He damned near burst in Potter’s mouth then and there, just from the gorgeous image the Boy-Who-Lived made.  His hips thrust forward against his will and he whimpered as Harry only seemed to purr in approval and work his cock harder.  Letting go of the chalk rail, he shoved one hand back through his own white-blonde locks while the other slid down to the back of Harry’s head, spreading chalk dust through the midnight locks as he caressed them almost lovingly.  He felt himself growing nearer and nearer to the edge, knew one more hit to the back of that throat would-</p><p> </p><p>And then suddenly the delicious wet heat was gone and Harry was standing before him again.  He gasped in shocked dismay at the abrupt end but then Harry’s mouth was on his again, and sweet Gods the taste of his own precum mixed with the indescribable flavour that was Harry Potter only made him that much more delicious. </p><p> </p><p>“Fuck me Draco,” Harry purred into his mouth.  “Please… <em>please</em> fuck me…” he begged.</p><p> </p><p>Draco didn’t even know when he had managed to do it, but he realized that Harry had managed to kick off his shoes and trousers when he felt the other man’s big hand suddenly wrap around Draco’s cock and rub it deliciously along another hard, thick length.  He almost screamed in pleasure at the delicious frot and Gods but not a single one of his fantasies had <em>ever</em> done Harry Potter justice.  He thrust into that evilly perfect hand, wrapping his own fingers around Harry’s to increase the delicious friction of their cocks together…</p><p> </p><p>And then moaned into Harry’s mouth, “Fuck it,” before he pushed the shorter boy forward against the nearest desk.  He laid Harry back over it and came above him, his mouth never leaving those perfect, wicked lips.  Harry moaned in approval and instantly wrapped his legs around Draco’s hips, hands scrabbling at his back and blunted nails digging in.</p><p> </p><p>Finally ripping his hands free of the wrists of his shirt, Draco tossed it away somewhere behind him.  Slipping a hand between them, Draco encouraged Harry’s legs higher along his hips before he teased a finger along the other man’s entrance…</p><p> </p><p>And whimpered, panting against Harry’s neck at how wet and open he found it.  Disgusting spell thought of everything… it even ensured that the victim was lubed and stretched…</p><p> </p><p>Draco’s head fell forward against Harry’s chest and he tried one last time to find a good, decent person inside of himself that probably never existed in the first place.  “Harry… I shouldn’t… <em>we</em> shouldn’t it’s… curse… wrong… so fucking wrong I-“</p><p> </p><p>And then his head was being lifted up from Harry’s chest by hands that were surprisingly gentle considering how scrabbling and desperate they’d been only minutes before.  He looked down into hungry, but surprisingly determined eyes as Harry said huskily, “I want it to be you… I always wanted it to be you Draco…”</p><p> </p><p>A lie brought on by the curse… words Harry Potter would never speak to Draco Malfoy in his right mind… yet everything Draco had ever <em>ever</em> wanted to hear.  He looked into those dragon’s eyes for a moment longer, seeing everything he’d ever wanted reflected in their depths…</p><p> </p><p>And then slid inside his enemy, and into the only home he would ever want again…</p><p> </p><p>Harry’s body tightened around him in welcome and the other man’s head slid backward on a moan of ecstasy.  The legs wrapped at his waist tightened and Draco watched as his head fell back in pleasure, the long line of his neck so taut his Adam’s Apple danced beneath his skin.  Draco ducked his head to run his tongue along the length of that delicious neck, feeling a primitive desire to gently bite or suckle at it, to mark the other man as his own so that all the fucking world would know that Harry James Potter <em>belonged</em> to Draco Lucius Malfoy…</p><p> </p><p>But he managed to hold himself back from that and instead just nuzzled and licked while he let Harry get used to the feel of him inside.  Not that that took long as the Gryffindor was apparently just as impatient in this as he was in everything else.  He began to whimper and shift beneath Draco, his hands sliding down to the globes of Draco’s ass and squeezing hard.</p><p> </p><p>It was all the encouragement Draco needed.  He pulled back and then thrust home again and within seconds he’d set up a rhythm that had them both panting and gasping and moaning in between desperate kisses at every inch of skin they could reach.  Their bodies molded together as though they’d been made for one another and it was as though Draco just <em>knew</em> how to angle his hips to find that perfect spot inside of Harry to have the other Wizard shouting his name.  The muscles in Draco’s back and ass flexed with every thrust and the way that Potter’s body surrounded and squeezed him had him nearing the edge in an embarrassingly quick period.</p><p> </p><p>Holding himself above Harry with one hand, Draco slid the other between them and caught Harry’s cock in his long fingers.  He began to pump him in time to the rhythm of his thrusts and watched as Harry writhed beneath him like a finely tuned instrument being played by a master musician.  He cried out for more, faster, harder and Draco gave him everything he wanted.  He pushed his unexpected-but-desperately-wanted-lover to the very edge, thumb teasing over his tip and dancing through the precum there as he urged him toward the edge that Harry needed and they both wanted…</p><p> </p><p>And then Harry suddenly screamed, “Draco!!” and hot fluid burst forth, coating both of their bellies.  Draco felt Harry’s muscles tighten and spasm around him and it was all it took before he cried out Harry’s name in a guttural, barely human voice and followed him right over the edge, pouring himself into the only man he’d ever wanted to be with…</p><p> </p><p>And as the sweat slowly dried on their bodies, as the roiling need slowly cooled… Draco could only think that even when he died for this, as he surely would once Potter was back in his right mind… he’d die happier than he ever imagined he possibly could…</p>
