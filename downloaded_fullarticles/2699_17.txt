          <div class="userstuff"><p>He lay on the floor in the middle of the bare room, staring up at the ceiling where paint peeled and cracked. An acoustic guitar held gently across his chest, cold wood soothing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>"I was wrong to say I loved her</em>
  <br/>
  <em>I was wrong to think I'm right</em>
  <br/>
  <em>But when I told her it was over</em>
  <br/>
  <em>My darling I had lied</em>
  <br/>
  <em>I've been running from my demons</em>
  <br/>
  <em>Afraid to look behind</em>
  <br/>
  <em>I've been running from myself</em>
  <br/>
  <em>Afraid of what I'd find"</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>From down below the Order of the Phoenix members stopped their discussion, listening silently as the music floated down. </p>
<p>Even Severus Snape did not say a word.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>"But how am I supposed to love you</em>
  <br/>
  <em>When I don't love who I am</em>
  <br/>
  <em>And how can I give you all of me</em>
  <br/>
  <em>When I'm only half a man</em>
  <br/>
  <em>'Cause I'm a sinking ship that's burning</em>
  <br/>
  <em>So let go of my hand</em>
  <br/>
  <em>And how can I give you all of me</em>
  <br/>
  <em>When I'm only half a man"</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p><em>"</em>Harry" Bill Weasley mumbled, closing his eyes and leaning back in his chair, running a hand through his red hair.</p>
<p>Sirius Black half rose, clenching the table, a look of understanding crossed his face as he listened to the pain filled lyrics.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>"And now I'm stuck in this hotel room</em>
  <br/>
  <em>By cold neon light</em>
  <br/>
  <em>I've been waiting for an answer</em>
  <br/>
  <em>But it don't come tonight</em>
  <br/>
  <em>And every bottle I had stolen</em>
  <br/>
  <em>It laid shattered on the floor</em>
  <br/>
  <em>What's broken can't be whole, anymore"</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ron Weasley sat up, eyes wide, jumping to his feet and darting towards the bedroom door. Hermione Granger's soft hand kept him from running to his friend.</p>
<p>"He needs this. He needs to let it all out" realisation plastered upon his face, he let out a sigh and sunk back down, his heart going out to his friend.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>"But how am I supposed to love you</em>
  <br/>
  <em>When I don't love who I am</em>
  <br/>
  <em>And how can I give you all of me</em>
  <br/>
  <em>When I'm only half a man</em>
  <br/>
  <em>'Cause I'm a sinking ship that's burning</em>
  <br/>
  <em>So let go of my hand</em>
  <br/>
  <em>And how can I give you all of me</em>
  <br/>
  <em>When I'm only half a man"</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ginny stuck her head out of the door, Fred and George copying from across the landing. A tear slid down her face as she listened to the lyrics, the twins strong arms wrapping around her.<br/><br/><br/><em>"No one can ever hurt me</em><br/><em>Like I hurt myself</em><br/><em>I'm made out of stone</em><br/><em>And I'm beyond help</em><br/><em>Don't give your heart to me"</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>His sleeves were rolled up as he smoothly moved his fingers across the strings. Red lines lay patterned upon pale skin, some faint yet other deep and bold.</p>
<p>
  <br/>
  <em>"Cause how am I supposed to love you</em>
  <br/>
  <em>When I don't love who I am</em>
  <br/>
  <em>And how can I give you all of me</em>
  <br/>
  <em>When I'm only half a man</em>
  <br/>
  <em>'Cause I'm a sinking ship that's burning</em>
  <br/>
  <em>So let go of my hand</em>
  <br/>
  <em>And how can I give you all of me</em>
  <br/>
  <em>When I'm only half a man"</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He took in a shaky breath, letting the music finish, leaving a heavy silence to rest in the air. Slowly he sat up, setting the guitar down beside him. His elbows rested upon his knees that curled up, hands running through his dark locks, head bowed into his arms, tears falling from emerald eyes and silent sobs shook his body.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"I'm <em>Only half a man"</em></p>
<p>He whispered to himself, a choked sob escaping his lips.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Even the most feared Dark Lord stopped his pacing, feeling the melody wash over him and the pain that followed. Even Tom Riddle had one last inkling of emotion for the boy he knew he would have to kill, his greatest enemy. Even he felt a tiny pinch of remorse for the boy who was going to loose everything.</p>
