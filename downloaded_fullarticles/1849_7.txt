          <div class="userstuff"><p>“Oh, I’m being so <em> stupid!</em> Someone slap me,” Hermione huffed to no one in particular. </p><p>“I’ll do it.” </p><p>Hermione turns harshly towards the voice. Fred. She fixes him with a <em> look </em>. “Well go on, then.”</p><p>Fred’s in front of her now, giving her a sly smile. “Close your eyes, Granger.”</p><p>Hermione’s glare only ceases as she lets her eyes fall closed despite herself. She breathes in deeply and readies herself for <em> something,</em> although she’s not quite sure what. She feels Fred move closer, then there’s a warmth spreading over her face, turning her cheeks pink. He was kissing her. Fred Weasley was kissing her. </p><p>Hermione gasped and, with a hand on Fred’s chest, she stepped back. </p><p>“Fred!” </p><p>“Yes, Granger?” That smirk was back, and Hermione had to resist the urge to punch Fred right in the mouth. She took a breath and forced a calm but firm expression onto her face. </p><p>“Fred. You can’t just kiss someone without their consent. Especially since- Nevermind. I thought you knew better than that.”</p><p>Fred looked taken aback. “Fuck. Hermione, I’m sorry. You’re right, of course. I should never have done that without asking. I don’t know what came over me. Not that that’s an excuse. I can’t believe I did that to you. You-” </p><p>Fred looked down in surprise at the hand Hermione had placed on his arm. </p><p>“You’re rambling.”</p><p>“I’m sorry.”</p><p>“I know. And I’ve forgiven you.”</p><p>Tension immediately fell from Fred’s face, and he gave Hermione a small grateful smile. A moment of silence passed between them. Fred cleared his throat. </p><p>“So,” he said, apprehension written on his face. </p><p>“So,” Hermione repeated. </p><p>“I have to ask. Did it at least make you feel better for just a second? Or was it completely awful since I caught you by surprise?”</p><p>“Oh, Fred. I never said that. I’d just prefer you ask next time.”</p><p>“Next time? There’s going to be a next time?”</p><p>Hermione gave his arm a light squeeze before letting go. She gathered her books and turned to leave, but after only a few steps, she paused. She sent Fred a wink over her shoulder, laughing as his cheeks pinked. “We’ll see, Freddie. We’ll see.”</p></div>
