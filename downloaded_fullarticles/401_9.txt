          <div class="userstuff"><p>This is all Weasley’s patronising fault or maybe that bigot Malfoy’s. Either way Hermione had enough of the patronising pleasure that she could count to ten and tie her own shoelaces by the time she started Juniors. As the only black person in the picturesque Kent village her parents had chosen to raise her, hell the only black person she'd seen outside trips to London, Lenny Henry, and American telly her parents wouldn’t have approved of, at eleven she’d had her fill of small minded racist middle and upper class Brits and half wished her parents had left her in the Central African orphanage they’d found her rather than subjecting her to a Kent Grammar. </p><p>One of the major positives of finding out she was a witch was that the Wizarding world didn’t seem to care much about skin colour. So to find out she was part of another minority, alternately hated and condescended to was a kick in the teeth. To experience both sides of that on the train to school had her stewing. All that had been going through her mind when the Sorting Hat dropped on her head was the furious thought that she would prove that she wasn’t some kind of pet chimpanzee, so it shouldn’t have been a surprise that the hat promptly yelled “Slytherin” without any consultation.</p><p>Slytherin was the one House she had dismissed out of hand. It had a strong emphasis on ‘Wizarding tradition’ dating back to its founder and while the Wizarding world cared little for skin colour, there weren’t enough black Wizarding families in the UK that she could pass herself off as half-blood successfully and <em> Flourish and Blotts </em> had been lacking in books about Wizarding Africa. So she would have to admit to being muggle raised which meant she was a target of the ‘traditionalists’ and their purity agenda, whose House she had just been dropped into. Joy.</p><p>That her time at Hogwarts wasn’t going to be pleasant was made clear their first night. The password for their common room was “purity” in September and changed to “mudblood” in October. The only rules their Head of House, Professor Snape, had were don’t make me notice you and don’t get caught. When the other girls refused to share with a mudblood, the prefect shoved her trunk at her and told her “Find somewhere more suitable for your kind.” Then shot a stinging hex at her face when she didn’t move fast enough.</p><p>The unused room she found after a sleepless night exploring the depths of the Slytherin dungeons and dodging curses was small, damp smelling and dusty. The room was far back in the Slytherin dungeons at the end of one of an unused corridor, to Hermione the many unused corridors and rooms hinted that once there were far more students at Hogwarts than the 40-50 students a year of the current population. The door was, like the common room door, a slab of stone that opened with a password originally the unimaginative “Salazar, greatest of the Hogwarts Four” but she changed that to “Invicta” for her home and herself. Containing, just a broken desk and chair, so far out of the way, and with nothing worth anything to any other Slytherin she thought the room a good compromise. Not risking the wrath of Professor Snape for being caught outside the common room after curfew and shitty enough that the rest of her Housemates could justify letting the mudblood have it rather than risk their Head’s attention themselves. Not a good enough compromise that she wasn’t going to spend every moment she could out of the dungeons or that she wasn’t going to research how to protect the room and herself from her House.</p><p>Not that being out of the House was a protection she quickly learnt. Slytherins, especially lone first years, were the target of hexes and jinxes from the other three houses and being outside the welcoming arms of Slytherin just kept her Housemates’ curses legal. Slytherins were also always considered to be the instigator by every  teacher other than Professor Snape, even if it was three seventh years against one first year and the teachers aren’t inclined to reward a student who already knows too many curses for being well read. So she doesn’t earn points for Slytherin by knowing the answers, just loses them for fighting which Professor Snape berates her for in their common room. Making clear that in his eyes it is her muggle heritage that is responsible for her inability to learn. Then turns a blind eye as the House takes their frustrations out on her except to remind her not to make him notice her by going to the Hospital Wing. It is her responsibility to work out how to undo what her Housemates have done to her, without missing lessons, being caught out after curfew or fighting in the corridors.</p><p>She doesn’t try to help Ron with the levitation charm. She’s still the first in the class to successfully cast it but Professor Flitwick prefers to wait for a student he hasn’t taken points from three times this week for fighting and who doesn’t permanently have her nose on a book of offensive spells to congratulate. Instead she glares at the current littlest Wesley when his whirling arms put his wand too close to her face and buries herself back in <em> Scrivener’s Curses, Hexes, and Jinxes for the Discerning Wizard </em>. She would really like to be able to pick up her Transfiguration textbook tonight rather than doing her homework with a library copy again.</p><p>She did successfully cast the spell and Ron is still sore about a mudblood doing better than him and a Slytherin to boot but “Slimy Snake” hissed at her back without a curse or hex to follow up is a positively friendly interaction for Hermione so she doesn’t end up crying in a bathroom. She does skip the feast though, the peace of the unused classroom she finds and an apple she grabbed at breakfast far more appealing than sitting at one end of Slytherin table and watching the rest of her House eat but not eating herself because they won’t let the filth touch anything but scraps and she will not lower herself to eating their scraps. </p><p>So she still doesn’t know about the troll but no one goes to find her. Instead she trips it over a banister, she’s very familiar with the tripping jinx, and drops its own club on its head with the levitation charm when it doesn’t stay down. Making sure your enemies stay down was the first lesson Slytherin taught her. The second was curse faster than your opponent, never be caught without your wand in hand and something disabling on your lips. A troll’s hide is tough but even they don’t survive a three story drop followed by a club to the head from four stories.</p><p>Not that there are points. Professor McGonagall paled to learn that a first year was capable of killing a fully grown mountain troll and Professor Snape was forced to notice her again. She loses twenty points from Slytherin for not being at the feast, McGonagall, and gets detention for a week with Filch, Snape, plus another lecture, and following curse the mudblood session, in the common room.</p><p>Detention with Filch is the best thing that happens all term. Filch threatens violence and medieval torture devices but the worst he ever does is drag her around by her ear and Hermione has endured far worse at her Housemates’ wands. In detention she cleans and discovers places students rarely go and where the kitchens are. House elves are something she has to look up when she has time but right now it means eating more than a piece of easily transportable fruit for lunch and dinner.</p><p>She’s holed up in one of her secret places during the first Quidditch match enjoying the quiet of the mostly empty castle but not willing to risk a more trafficked area. The only people who find her outside classes now are the Weasley twins, vicious bastards that they are. So she misses Quirrel jinxing Potter and Snape trying to save him. No one distracts Quirrel, instead Potter plummets to the ground breaking his back and skull. Higgs catches the snitch. Slytherin celebrates loudly and publicly, both their win and Potter’s injury. </p><p>Rumour, so persistent even an outcast like Hermione knows, has it Potter will survive but he won’t play Quidditch again this year if ever. Her Housemates’ glee makes her more of a target and she’s back to losing points for fighting and catching Professor Snape’s attention. “Idiot girl”, “know-it-all” he hisses when he has to acknowledge her in public. “Muggleborn” that sounds more like mudblood and “simpleton” in the common room before he lets his House punish her for existing. </p><p>She continues hiding, studying and waiting for Christmas. Resorting isn’t a thing, you belong where the hat places you. If the school hates your house and your house hates you for your upbringing, well maybe you deserve to be hated, says British Wizardry. After all you always have your head in a book of hexes or curse and you’re always starting fights. Change yourself, or don’t because we’ll always know you’re a slimy snake who can’t be trusted. She could hope to change schools but Durmstrang doesn’t take muggleborns and she doesn’t expect that Beauxbatons would be any more welcoming to a Slytherin muggleborn. That and she suspects there were compulsion charms involved in her parents acceptance of their magical daughter and her education. Compulsion charms that mean their response to letters saying everyone hates me and my Head of House lets them physically hurt me is to tell her to try harder to make friends and brush off a mountain troll broke in to my school and nearly killed me.</p><p>Christmas holidays come on far too slowly. A dragging slog through getting up an hour before curfew ends, washing in an unused bathroom and leaving the common room to survive the less lethal curses of the rest of the school until just before curfew when she returns to her House. They then rush by far too fast. A boring magic free blur of church, social visits and family, none of whom may know where she goes to school or what she learns at school. Her parents allowed her to buy three magical  books, on the history and traditions of magic in Africa and specifically Central Africa, and for the first time to see and hold copies of their records, everything that they know about her life before they adopted her aged two.</p><p>It is with mixed relief and anxiety she boards the train back to Hogwarts, her precious records safely stored at home. It felt like she was missing a limb to lock her wand away in her trunk and use no magic but it had been nice not to have dodge spells every waking moment and sleep in a heavily spelled room. She packed a sleeping pad and sleeping bag, this time. While the elves could provide her a bed and now clean the rooms in the Slytherin dungeons she uses, she is very aware it is only the lack of value that keeps her room hers. She can’t out cast a seventh year but people would notice if a Slytherin slept in empty classrooms always and that would draw Professor Snape’s attention to the people who prevent her from remaining in the room as much as it would on her. He may not like her, he may hate her for her upbringing but he doesn’t want to have to deal with her.</p><p>Back to dear old Hogwarts and the lovely tradition of Gryffindors ganging up on a single Slytherin and cursing them. She manages almost a week before anyone properly notices her, she doesn’t count friendly cursing of any old Snake as noticing her. </p><p>January marks Potter’s return to classes for the first time since he fell, she vaguely notices. He walks slowly and is clumsy in a way he hadn’t been before but he’s always surrounded by a ring of Gryffindors. Until their first Potion’s class of the term. Snape rearranged the class seats to account for Potter’s absence, moving her partner to work with the newly single Wesley and leaving her alone in a back corner that he never goes near. Weasley is ready to work with Potter again but Snape orders him to the back. “Granger, assist Potter.” Snape hisses paying attention to her in class for the first time in months. </p><p>Potter is obviously uncomfortable in close proximity to a Slytherin. She’s not happy to have her brewing time interrupted. Under Snape’s lax supervision she’s long since stopped following the curriculum and brewing what appeals to her. Still she wordlessly prepares Potter his ingredients as the instructions call for quickly then ignores him. At the end of the lesson Potter has failed to brew the required potion. He fumbled the crushed snails adding them too fast and didn’t stir in a clean figure of eight pattern but Snape didn’t come to their corner so she counts the lesson as a success until he drops his bag trying to pick it. Immediately Snape is at their corner, vanishing the remains of her mild abrasion lotion and glowering at them both, “Detention with Filch, Granger.” He orders. “What did I tell you to do?” She assumes it is a rhetorical question. “Assist Potter, you imbecilic child. Help him pack his bag and carry it to the next class for him.” He turns and sweeps away. Potter looks mortified but if all Snape wants of her is to act as Potter’s servant then it’s a step up from what he normally wants so she packs his bag noticing his notes are unreadable and carries it up to Gryffindor tower, taking a circular route. Along the way something makes her stop and give him copies of her notes. She bleeds for her impulse but she’s bottled as much lotion as she could use before Snape vanished it and Potter smiles at her when he sees her on Monday.</p><p>For the Spring term every time Snape saw her and Potter in the same room and she wasn’t toadying for him, he would hiss in his strangely carrying whisper “Asist Potter, imbecile.” The insult to her intelligence changed but the insistence didn’t. The Gryffindors objected and the other teachers looked at her suspiciously but after a month of Hermione carrying his bag and giving him a copy of her carefully written notes every lesson the Gryffindor and Slytherin first years shared and walking him to class then running off to her own when they didn’t the teachers got used to it and assumed his ready mudblood servant would adapt for his injuries as they didn’t. The Gryffindor first years got bored of hexing and jinxing her with the few offensive spells they knew but the older Lions didn’t. Vicious the Weasley twins might be they didn’t compare to the Carrow twins once the dungeon door closed.</p><p>It was strangely nice. The other Houses didn’t hex Potter or seem to want to harm his stuff so while she was serving him she didn’t get hexed in the corridors and after a month of serving him she didn’t lose points when other Slytherins hexed him and by default her. She had to run around twice as much as other students getting to her classes on time, do twice the work in potions and herbology, and provide notes for him but this term was better than last. She was disappointed to see his slow improvement.</p><p>“Granger.” The last day of the spring term. “I can say I still need your help next semester.” Potter said very quietly.</p><p>“You think Weasley could withstand that.”</p><p>“It wouldn’t be a lie.” Potter got quieter with each word . “I couldn’t carry my bag all day and potions...” He trailed off. She nodded, barely, and they separate, her for the train, him back to the castle.</p><p>Easter holidays are the same strange mix. She’s used to watching her back for curses and having her wand ready at a moment. To not use magic for a month feels like an amputation, especially now she’s studying for exams which aren’t marked blind and every Slytherin knows you need to be twice as good as a Gryffindor for the same mark. This time it is with more relief than anxiety she steps on the train back to Hogwarts.</p><p>The normal routine of helping Potter prepare ingredients, carrying his bag and taking notes returned as soon as she got back to Hogwarts. He’s better than he was a month ago, steadier on his feet and quicker to walk. She can feel her freedom in the halls slipping away from her but there are some Slytherin tendencies in Potter and he keeps falling over his feet in front of teachers just enough that she’s carrying his bag right up to the last day of term. His fine motor control of his hands doesn’t improve as fast, he’s still fumbling his cutlery over on the Gryffindor table when she gets back for the Summer term and she can see his frustration in June. He’s not pretending not to be able to make the fine motions required for Charms. She’s got another year of taking his notes and preparing his ingredients at least.</p><p>“Do you know Nicolas Flamel?” The question is asked as she trims both their plants in Herbology.</p><p>“The Alchemist?”</p><p>“I guess.” Potter shrugs. “Something’s hidden in the castle. Something to do with this,” he gestures to himself and nearly knocks the watering can off the table, “and Nicolas Flamel.”</p><p>“He taught Headmaster Dumbledore.” She might not have much respect for the man  or his lauded Lions but she keeps that inside her head. “Created the Philosopher's Stone.” Seeing Potter look blank, “turns lead into gold and produces the Elixir of Life. Worth trying to kill the Boy-Who-Lived over.”</p><p>“The person who did this.” Potter doesn’t bother gesturing. “I think they’re the person killing unicorns,” he trails off and then “the person who gave Hagrid the dragon’s egg.” She continues trimming their plant, he doesn’t seem to need a response. “Ron thinks it’s Snape.” He shrugs, she lets him come to his own conclusions but Snape seemed unlikely to her unless his defeated but not destroyed Dark Lord wants the stone.</p><p>And life continues. Hermione studies, mostly how to survive Slytherin House and African traditions but incidentally for her exams, she assists Potter per Snape’s hissed instructions, let’s Malfoy’s laughter that the mudblood has found a master roll off her back, and curses Urquhart so badly Farley can’t fix it and he spends two nights in the Hospital Wing. He gets the lecture this time.</p><p>She carries Potter’s bag out to the large tree he wants to lounge under after their last exam and is about to leave when he grabs her hand. “He knows how to get the Stone.”</p><p>“Snape.” Weasley injects but they both ignore him.</p><p>“We’re going to stand.” Potter says like the little hero he is.</p><p>“You’ll die. You’re a first year.” She spits. “You’re a Lion. Tell someone, they’ll believe you.”</p><p>Potter looks at her, his too slim and small body calling her on the lie. “Tonight. The out of bounds corridor. Will you come?” She shrugs and leaves but she thinks he knows that means yes. Behind her she can hear Weasley spluttering about telling the slimy snake.</p><p>Potter doesn’t seem surprised to see her half hidden in an alcove but Weasley does. Fluffy is asleep already, some part of her mind takes the time to scream about keeping a Cerberus in a school but that’s reflex she already knows this school doesn’t care about the safety of a quarter of its students, finding out it doesn’t care about the other three quarters isn’t that big of a surprise.</p><p>The Devil’s Snare they land in burns.“Sprout” Potter mutters beside her. Fire comes easily to her. A simple ignition spell is the only one she can cast wandless and her first instinct when something unseen grabs her. Devil’s Snare doesn’t like and is very vulnerable to fire. The ignition spell on its own would have done the job but when combined with the nice fire hex she’s been studying it disappears in seconds. Weasley looks scared. Potter doesn’t.</p><p>The next room is filled with flying keys. “Flitwick.” Potter says as he spots the key. Weasley catches it. “Don’t have the grip.” Potter tells him when he suggests Potter fly. The door opens to a chessboard. “McGonagall.”</p><p>“Granger?” Weasley asks.</p><p>“I don’t play.” She replies.</p><p>“Me then.” Wesley squares his shoulders and plays them across then sacrifices himself in the penultimate move. The cushioning charm she casts might have been against the rules but she’s seen enough blood, mostly her own, this year. Weasley sounds hurt not dead as he’s dragged from his horse.</p><p>The door on the other side opens to a foul smelling room with another mountain troll. This time, already dead. Potter doesn’t have a teacher to attribute. “Quirrel.” She says stepping around the troll while part of her gibbers in remembered fear.</p><p>When they enter the next room, it’s to a collection of potion bottles and fire that springs on both sides. “Snape.” They speak simultaneously. It’s a logic puzzle that she solves easily with only enough for one person to go forward and one back. Hermione is not a Gryffindor and easily concedes to Potter’s desire to go forward and for her to go rescue Weasley. She knows healing charms and carries healing potions, he doesn’t.</p><p>She sends him through then rescues Weasley and puts him together enough that they can get out of the gauntlet. When they meet the Headmaster, not rushing in the way he implies he is, she lets Weasley do the talking and Dumbledore send her back to her common room. She does make sure Weasley makes it safely to the Infirmary first with a list of what she’s done to him and samples for the Matron she’s never met before descending to the Snake Pit.</p><p>Potter is confined to the Infirmary and she to detentions with Filch outside classes for the last week of term. Apparently preventing Potter from getting injured by being the boy hero this world wants him to be was implicit in “Assist Potter.” More than two words were needed for the extent of the responsibilities Snape was giving her. Weasley doesn’t talk to her so she’s reliant on the rumour mill to find out if Potter succeeded as well as nearly dying.</p><p>The End of Year feast is celebrated in green and silver at least to start. She is there, dragged by her ear by Farley, sitting at the end eating a meal exactly as she likes it thanks to the house elves to her House’s displeasure when Dumbledore announces last minute points. Weasley, Potter, and inexplicably Longbottom receive points for their part in preventing Quirrel from taking the Stone. She doesn’t get any but that wouldn’t fit with Dumbledore’s goal of giving his Lion’s the cup. Watching her Housemates anger and disappointment is it’s own reward. Potter seems indignant but his protests are ignored by the surrounding Gryffindors.</p><p>She meets Potter at the Gryffindor entrance and carries his bag and trunk down to his train carriage with her own. “Looking forward to summer?” He asks as she turns to leave.</p><p>She shrugs. “Muggle raised. Not casting magic or even being around it is odd.”</p><p>“Oh.” Potter looks glum. “I have to go back to my Aunt and Uncle. They’re muggle.” She winces in sympathy, they shake hands and she leaves him with a carriage of Weasley’s to protect him on his way home, dodging a friendly jinx from the Weasley twins. It wouldn’t have even hurt.</p></div>
