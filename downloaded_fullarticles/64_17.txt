</p><p>Remus blinked away the flash of light and tried to remember when he had ended up on Division Street. Just as he started to question himself a voice started to answer. </p><p>“Alright, so you were leaving class-” </p><p>“How do you know he’s a student?! You can’t say that!” </p><p>Two men, dressed in matching slim black suits, black ties, and black sunglasses in their hands were bickering in front of him….Did he know these men? Did he die? Maybe he needed to change dealers…</p><p>“Are you a student?” the one with drool-worthy chiseled cheekbones and a messy bun of ebony locks on top of his head was questioning him with piercing gray eyes. Remus simply blinked as he looked down to see if the rest of him was as gorgeous as his face. </p><p>“S, you’re an idiot, you just erased his memory! He can’t remember if he’s a student right now!” This man’s face was obscured by his hands and Remus’s gaze returned to the pretty one. Maybe they were angels?…Poorly trained angels?</p><p>“Are you angels?” </p><p>The two men turned back to him and S’s face softened while the other one gripped his hair and groaned. S took Remus by the shoulders who very much appreciated the improved situation. “Look, you uh…you’re just on your way home and you saw uh…” S turned to the other man and Remus got to admire his long neck. Yes, this man was definitely not from this world. </p><p>“….you saw a UV test,” the wild hair man answered. “We’re testing UV lights as a way to clean the subways and you caught a flash of the light. I promise this won’t permanently affect your eyesight, so long as you return home and rest.” </p><p>“Yes, and make sure that tomorrow you head to Sultan’s Market for lunch at 1pm, sharp,” S finished. </p><p>Remus heard groaning in the background but kept his eyes on S. He would definitely do whatever he said, and nodded in understanding, still not having gained full function over his tongue yet. </p><p>“You’ll remember? 1pm? Sultan’s market?” The gray eyes were wide and hopeful, and Remus wanted to stay here with him, but he had to go home right? And sleep? He had an important lunch date tomorrow. </p><p>“Come ON S, let’s go before M has our heads!” </p><p>S gave Remus’s shoulders a light squeeze, walked a few steps backward, and finally broke eye contact when he turned to follow the other man back down into the subway. <br/><br/></p><p>Remus felt like he had broken out of some sort of trance as his feet began to carry him home.  He was hungry, and could really use a falafel right now, but he’d have to wait for Sultan’s Market to open tomorrow. </p></div>
