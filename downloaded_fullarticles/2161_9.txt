    <p class="western">"Be polite, all right? This is my mum and dad."</p>
<p class="western">Marcus sneered. "'Course I will. I'm not fucking stupid."</p>
<p class="western">"And don't swear. Mum doesn't like it." Oliver turned the car into the driveway of a stone-built semi-detached house; a quite unremarkable home sitting in the middle of a middle class neighbourhood on the outskirts of Perth.</p>
<p class="western">"Going to be a bit of a bugger to 'ave a conversation, then," Marcus retorted. "Wot with me being so fuckin' foul-mouthed an' everything."</p>
<p class="western">"You're not funny." Parking behind his dad's battered Ford Focus, Oliver switched off the engine. Nerves jingled in the pit of his stomach. "Right then, let's get this over with."</p>
<p class="western">Moments later, bags in hand, he led Marcus slowly across the gravel to the house. His mind was still racing with all the things that could, and probably would go wrong. "Don’t insult Muggles, either.”</p>
<p class="western">"Merlin, Wood, what else? Don't breathe? Don't grope your arse?"</p>
<p class="western">Oliver knew Marcus was leering at his bum – he could <span>feel</span> his eyes – but he didn't look around; instead, he kept his voice neutral and said, "Don't call me Wood. They'll think it's weird."</p>
<p class="western">"Wot am I meant to call you, then, <em>Wood</em>?"</p>
<p class="western">"I don't know." <span>He couldn't keep the frustration out of his voice – why had he ever suggested this?</span> It wasn't too late to turn back; they hadn't reached the front door yet. "How about my name?"</p>
<p class="western">"But 'Wood' <span>is</span> your name."</p>
<p class="western">"For fu-" Oliver began to turn to vent his annoyance at his boyfriend, when behind him the front door of the house opened and his mum was standing, tall and respectable, dark curls edged with streaks of grey escaping from the neat twist of hair pinned at the base of her neck.</p>
<p class="western">She was smiling and peering at them over the top of a pair of half-rimmed glasses. "Oliver, you're home!" She hurried towards them, and Oliver turned to face her, wiping the irritation off his face and murmuring a silent prayer.</p>
<p class="western">"Hiya, Mum." The words were smothered as she pulled him into a tight hug, and he had to push her away, red-faced and protesting. "Mum, stop it."</p>
<p class="western">"Ach, be quiet." She turned to Marcus, who was looking far too amused for Oliver's liking "And you must be Marcus." She extended a hand, which Marcus shook politely. "Oliver's told us so much about you."</p>
<p class="western">Oliver cringed. "Mum…" But she wasn't paying him any attention.</p>
<p class="western">"It's lovely to meet you, Mrs Wood." Oliver heard the politely spoken words, and he looked at Marcus in surprise. His boyfriend was smiling at his mother. "Ollie's told me so much about you, too."</p>
<p class="western"><span>Ollie? He'd what? What the fucking fuck? </span>He was glaring at Marcus, hoping to sear him with his gaze. His mum, traitor that she was, had hooked a hand into the crook of Marcus's elbow and was leading him into the house.</p>
<p class="western">"Bring in Marcus's bags, won't you, Oliver," she said over her shoulder, and Oliver saw that Marcus had left his bag lying on the ground. “You can tell me all about your journey up here. Oliver said it’s the first time you’ll have used Muggle transport. I hope it wasn’t too traumatic for you. We just like to make sure that Oliver learns to appreciate Muggle ways.”</p>
<p class="western">“Oh, no, Mrs Wood, it was fun.”</p>
<p class="western">Oliver stared incredulously at the back of Marcus’s head. <span>Fun?</span> Marcus had moaned from the instant they’d left the flat to get a taxi. Tried to cajole Oliver into Flooing at least part of the way up the Scotland, but Oliver knew from past experience that his mum would find out. She always did, and it really wasn’t worth the grief. The only way he’d finally managed to get Marcus to shut up was to drag him into the toilet during the flight to Edinburgh and show him just what Muggles got up to. The same again in the back seat of the hire car. He hoped to Merlin that his mum didn’t find out about that.</p>
<p class="western">Marcus twisted his head around and gave Oliver the full benefit of his crooked tooth grin. "You coming, <em>Ollie</em>?" he said, turning away before Oliver could even mouth an obscenity at him.</p>
<p class="western">Oliver followed them into the house, laden with both their bags, and heard his mum chattering away, telling Marcus all about the house and the improvements they'd made. Oliver could only imagine what his boyfriend was thinking – he was certainly making a show of feigning interest – but it was unlikely he was finding the Muggle residence even remotely impressive. It was a far cry from most Pureblood homes; his parents had tried to keep it as inconspicuous as possible, both of them enjoying the simplicity of the Muggle lifestyle, and so, apart from the odd cleaning charm and heating spell, the house was like any other in the area.</p>
<p class="western">"And this is the kitchen," he could hear his mum saying as she led Marcus through the magnolia painted hallway, past the bottom of the stairs, and through the door at the back. "Would you like a cup of tea?"</p>
<p class="western">"That would be great, thank you."</p>
<p class="western"><span>Thank you?</span> Oliver dropped the bags onto the floor with a heavy thud and they both turned around. His mum tutted. "Be careful!" she chastised. "He's like a bull in a china shop," she informed Marcus, and he nodded.</p>
<p class="western">"He's just the same at the flat."</p>
<p class="western">"I am not. He's bloody lying."</p>
<p class="western">"Oliver! Don't be so rude. Apologise this instant."</p>
<p class="western">Marcus smirked, and Oliver bit the side of his cheek to stop himself from making things worse. "Sorry," he muttered.</p>
<p class="western">"S'alright," Marcus said. "Mind your language in front of your mum, though."</p>
