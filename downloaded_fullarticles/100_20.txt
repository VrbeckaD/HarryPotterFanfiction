          <div class="userstuff"><p>“Potter, pass the pumpkin juice.”</p>
<p>Harry reached over and passed the jug to Draco, he dropped his head to his arms and tucked himself away as if it would help lessen the heat. If only the damn enchanted ceiling didn’t do so bloody well at mimicking the Merlin-<em>damned sun</em>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“How is the pumpkin juice warm already? Don’t they use charmed tableware?!”</p>
<p>“Quit talking Draco, your hotheadedness is adding to the heat.”</p>
<p>“<em>You want to say that to my face, Zabini?</em>”</p>
<p>“Fine. <em>Shut the fuck up, Malfoy.</em>”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry laughed under his breath; tensions were running high with the weather. He and the rest of the school started the day in agony until Dumbledore had announced non-compulsory robes in the wake of this maddening heatwave. It was barely spring, but the weather seemed to have a mind of its own.</p>
<p>Harry was quick to fold the arms of his button-up, taking advantage of the lax dress code immediately to adjust his sleeves. He had even tried with wearing his tie, but far too quickly, its knot became a noose. Eventually, it was entirely undone and hanging carelessly around his shoulders, until the fear of losing it kicked in during a game of early morning Quidditch. Which the tie then haphazardly shoved its way into his pants pocket.</p>
<p>He itched to dip into the Lake, and the day had barely begun. Or he wanted to at least find a way to shed more layers without it being socially unacceptable.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Morning, Harry. How are you feeling?”</p>
<p>“I wish I wasn’t, Tom. It’s getting unbearable. All the cooling charms in the world couldn’t save us.” Harry’s reply was muffled and stilted. The less talking he had to do, the better.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Tom was quick to catch on and only responded with running a hand through Harry’s hair. The feeling of Tom’s magic sliding over him as he cast another cooling charm over Harry’s own was <em>heaven</em> in this hell. Harry hummed in pleasure and nuzzled further into Tom’s palm, Tom’s light chuckle music to his ears.</p>

<p>Ron’s eyes tore themselves away from the neighbouring House. He leaned forward to whisper across the Ravenclaw table, “Wow, you were right Gin. Eight Sickles says it’ll take them the day to figure it out.”</p>
<p>Hermione met his stare while gathering her hair into a bun and scoffed, “Don’t be ridiculous, Riddle is smarter than that. Ten says it’ll only take four hours.”</p>
<p>“<em>Please</em>,” Ginny’s eyes rolled so hard Ron thought they’d surely fall out, “Harry’s keener with these sort of things. I bet Tom won’t even catch on until Harry points it out. I’m all in. One Galleon says they’ll <em>both</em> know by dinner.”</p>
<p>Incredulous, Ron asked, “Where did <em>you</em> get money?”</p>
<p>“Unlike you, I have applied myself and started a tutoring business within my House.”</p>
<p>“A tutoring business? Gin, don’t get me wrong, you’re smart and all but what on earth are you teaching them?”</p>
<p>“I teach them how to assess consideration and risks carefully to achieve one’s goals or rewards.” She replied, gathering a sheet of parchment to use as a hand fan.</p>
<p>Hermione’s gaze sharpened, her brain working a mile a second. “Ginny…what you just described sounds a lot like gambling. Are you teaching your fellow Slytherins how to <em>gamble</em>?”</p>
<p>Ginny’s smile was far too sweet, “What gave you that idea? Besides aren’t we betting right now?”</p>
<p>Hermione patted Ginny’s arm, a certain amount of pride shining in her gaze, “I knew you were my favourite Weasley.”</p>
<p>“Wait-what?! But Hermione-”</p>
<p>“May the best Witch win!”</p>
<p>“<em>But-</em>” Ron sighed as he watched Hermione and Ginny shake on it.</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p>Tom, for the life of him, couldn’t fathom what Harry’s friends were up to.</p>
<p>But he knew it wasn’t anything <em>good</em>.</p>
<p>In the Common Room, Ginerva had taken one look at him and started laughing so hard she’d fallen off the couch. He had asked her five times what was so funny and eventually resolved to send a mild stinging hex her way and walk out. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>They hadn’t spoken since. Harry was a bit bitter with him because of it.</p>
<p>Even if he said otherwise.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Tom, I’m sure she has a reason for laughing this morning. Maybe it wasn’t even at you,” Harry brought it up anew on their way to Runes.</p>
<p>“Harry if it’s bothering you so much I will apologise and speak to Weasley-Number-Seven during lunch.”</p>
<p>“I really wish you wouldn’t call her that.”</p>
<p>“Harry!” Granger called out from the front of the class door, and she was another one acting <em>oddly</em> today.</p>
<p>After breakfast during Herbology, she kept pointing out Harry’s lack of tie and then quickly moved on to the fit of his clothes. Which then put her attention on Tom, where she proceeded to comment on <em>his</em> clothes.</p>
<p><em>Yes,</em> he was slightly offended.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Are you both sure something isn’t different with you today? I just can’t put my finger on it but <em>goodness</em> something seems distinctively off about your attire.”</p>
<p>“Granger, you’re acting like you’ve never seen someone without their over-robes on, what has gotten into you?”</p>
<p>She blushed scarlet in a way that had Tom almost writing it off as embarrassment but quickly realised it was <em>frustration</em>. Her eyes kept glancing at the muggle watch strapped to her wrist.</p>
<p>“Hermione, Tom’s right, you’re pretty nit-picky today. Are the non-compulsory robes throwing you off?”</p>
<p>She sighed in defeat and wandered into the room, muttering something that sounded eerily like, “<em>How dense could they be! Unbelievable!</em>”</p>
<p>Harry tenderly touched Tom’s forearm and whispered, “I’m a little worried about ‘Mione today. I’m going to sit with her this class and talk to her.” His eyes held an apologetic sentiment but a sharpness that promised Hermione wouldn’t be acting like this after their chat.</p>
<p> </p>

</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“And I had no luck with her the entire class. She must just be in one of her moods.”</p>
<p>Harry sighed, his arms crossed. He and Ron made the trek to Care of Magical Creatures together as they usually did, splitting from Hermione and Tom who opted for Divination. Today it was especially unbearable to walk down to Hagrid’s hut.</p>
<p>“Mate, trust me. No need to worry. I know what’s up with her, and it’s nothing you want to hear. In fact, just ignore everything she’s talking about until the end of the day.”</p>
<p>“That’s oddly specific, Ron.”</p>
<p>“I’m just looking out for your best interests.”</p>
<p>“<em>Oh, Merlin.</em> What have you done?”</p>
<p>“Really, Ginny was the one who started it.” Ron’s hands had gone up in a clear, ’<em>don’t look at me</em>’ gesture.</p>
<p>“This can’t be good.”</p>
<p>“You’ll probably laugh when you figure it out.”</p>
<p>Harry shook his head, “If I survive it.”</p>
<p>“No-no. This one’s good.”</p>
<p>“<em>Right.</em> Well, whatever. I’m just not going to think about it.”</p>
<p>Ron clapped a hand on Harry’s shoulder and grinned, “That’s the spirit!”</p>
<p>“Ugh, please avoid touching me today. I’m literally dying from the heat.”</p>
<p>“Really? I don’t think it’s that bad.”</p>
<p>“Of course you don’t.”</p>
<p>“I resent whatever you’re implying.”</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p>“Well, Hermione, you hate to see it, but clearly I’m the best Witch. Your four hours are well over!” Ginny sat beside Ron, they were having lunch with the Gryffindors it seemed.</p>
<p>“It’s like you’ve both forgotten I exist.”</p>
<p>“Hush, Ronald-” Ron made to interrupt, but Hermione quickly continued.</p>
<p>“Ginerva, you claimed they would both know by dinner, and there’s still plenty of time till then. Closest to the bet upon time wins.”</p>
<p>“Hm, spoken like the truly desperate.” Ginny reached for the cucumber-slice sandwiches in favour of the heavier lunch items, the sun had hit full levels of <em>obnoxious</em> around twelve. She was barely holding on.</p>
<p>“Harry’s catching on that somethings up. You were pretty obvious about it 'Mione.”</p>
<p>“I was not obvious!”</p>
<p>“Oh no, did she blow it?”</p>
<p>“Nah, but Harry did ask me a few questions.”</p>
<p>“If I was so <em>obvious</em> <em>THEN HOW HAVE THEY NOT FIGURED IT OUT YET</em>?”</p>
<p>“You’re lucky we’re sitting with the Gryffs, Hermione. That level of shouting is normal talking volume for them.”</p>
<p>Ron spluttered, “What? Gin, come on! Why bring my House into-”</p>
<p>“You’re talking a big game for someone who isn’t even in the same year as them, Ginny. You can’t subtly point them in the correct direction when you don’t see them all day.”</p>
<p>“Oh ho <em>ho</em>, but you’ve forgotten Ms Ravenclaw Prefect.<em> I’m in their House</em>. Harry and I have Quidditch practise again this afternoon. Riddle likes to beat me at chess in the Common Room. I’ve got <em>plenty</em> of time.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>

</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Hey, Gin.” Harry started to raise his arm for a wave and quickly gave up.</p>
<p>“Good afternoon, Harry. You’re looking about as fed up with the weather as me.” Ginny was frowning and had made an effort to don her Quidditch jersey and mandated legwear. Her arm and knee pads nowhere in sight.</p>
<p>“Yeah, it’s impossible. But Quidditch practice stops for no one, and we’ve just started training. Also, you’re a champion for wearing gear, but I wasn’t going to force anyone today.”</p>
<p>Harry made a sweeping gesture at his own gearless and jersey-less self. On his way from Arithmancy, he deemed it too much effort to go to the dorms to change, deciding instead to allow practice in whatever they wore that morning.</p>
<p>“I can see that. You’re looking cute today Harry, is that a new shirt?” Her tone sounded teasing as she swiftly started to remove the unnecessary gear and shuck it off to the side of the field.</p>
<p>Harry paused mid-step, having been about to work his way towards the centre of the pitch. He glanced at Ginny eyebrows raised, “Not you too.”</p>
<p>“No need to sound like a wounded animal. It was just a compliment,” Harry swore, in that moment, Ginny’s grin was shark-like.</p>
<p>“Ha-ha. Funny Gin. But no, it’s not new. Hermione had been going on about my clothes all morning, and Ron made it seem like you were all in cahoots about something.” Harry’s eyes narrowed in suspicion, “Is there something on my shirt? Did one of you charm it?”</p>
<p>“In ch-<em>what</em>?”</p>
<p>“In <em>cahoots</em>, it a muggle-you know what nevermind. I’m dropping this conversation.”</p>
<p>“But-wait, but Harry! Aren’t you curious about your shirt?! Aren’t you dying to know?!”</p>
<p>“Nope. Don’t care.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>

<p> </p>
<p>“Tom,” Harry’s hand raised to push back his drying hair. Tom couldn’t believe Harry had decided to fall off his broom and into the Lake.</p>
<p>And hadn’t invited Tom to watch. The audacity.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Tom could almost picture Harry swimming to shore with a smile on his face, lifting himself out of the water, clothes sticking to his body in all the right ways <em>and dripping wet</em>. He felt tempted to obliviate all those that were there to witness it. But Dumbledore would be suspicious. Tom could dream.</p>
<p>He had stumbled across Harry on his way from the Library to the Dorms. By then, Harry had charmed his clothes dry but felt “disgustingly like Lake ick” and was headed to take a shower. Tom had deigned to wait for him in the room, their fellow classmates slipping off to dinner.</p>
<p>“Harry, you’re a mess. Come here.” Harry had slipped back into the shirt he had worn earlier, he must have deemed the drying charm enough. The button-up seemed oddly loose around his shoulders, causing his collar to sag.</p>
<p>Tom’s hands reached to adjust Harry’s collar, and he was hit suddenly with the urge to pull Harry close. Didn’t surprise him, really. With the images of wet Harry fueling him from before. Not one to deny himself, Tom’s careful work of Harry’s collar fell apart immediately when he tugged Harry near to inhale the scent of his skin. Tom burrowed his face to the side of Harry’s neck but found himself pausing.</p>
<p>Harry’s hands had been working their way up his chest and had stopped on his shoulders, “Wait. Tom?”</p>
<p>“Hm?” Something was off. Harry’s was a scent Tom was intimately familiar with, but it seemed different, and he couldn’t place his finger on it.</p>
<p>“Is that my shirt?”</p>
<p>“Of course it’s your shirt, love, what kind of question is that?”</p>
<p>“No-no. Are <em>you</em> wearing my shirt?”</p>
<p>“What?” Baffled, Tom pulled back and glanced down at his shirt. Yes, it <em>was</em> a little more snug than usual, and the arms had seemed a little short this morning (easily fixed by rolling up his sleeves) but he hadn’t thought anything of it-oh.</p>
<p>
  <em>Oh.</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry was wearing his shirt. That’s why Tom couldn’t identify the odd scent coming off Harry’s collar. It wasn’t Harry’s scent because it was his own. <em>Because Harry was wearing Tom’s shirt</em>.</p>
<p>They had switched after waking up together this morning and hadn’t even realised it.</p>
<p>Tom glanced back up at Harry whose face had gone scarlet. Decidedly not do to the heat.</p>
<p>“I’m going to kill them. They knew all day. I’m going to murder them.”</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p>The Slytherin table was alight with laughter as Ginny bowed and raked in the Galleons made from her bet. Hermione and Ron were both incensed to see she had also made the bet with her army of Gambling Students.</p>
<p>Harry held his head in his hands in dismay and Tom didn’t help with his stupidly pleased smirk.</p>
<p>How Tom and Harry hadn’t noticed the betting board in the Common Room was beyond them.</p></div>
