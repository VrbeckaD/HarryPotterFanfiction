    <p> </p><p>May, 2000</p><p>Appointment with the Headmistress of Hogwarts. Meeting with the Minister. Discussions with Squiresome Publishers.</p><p>Severus groaned and rubbed his forehead as he looked over the day's agenda. He was positive that Minerva was going to offer him a teaching position at that hazardous excuse of a school - though from what he heard, she apparently had whipped it into some shape after she inherited the position from Albus - and still, he would have to think of a decent enough excuse for her to not owl him daily.</p><p>Meanwhile, the pesky meeting with the Minister couldn't seem to get out of his regular news. Ever since he arrived, the buggering invite had been sat on his table, and today was as good a day as ever to pay the visit, he figured.</p><p>Squiresome Publishers was nothing new. Hopefully, it wouldn't take more than an hour so that way he didn't have to listen to Griggs' criticisms or praises or whatever the hell the inane wizard wanted to remark to him this time.</p><p>Chuckling as he took a sip of his morning coffee, Severus thought of the irony. Never would he considered this homecoming if it meant his days would only be more occupied. Hopefully, this nonsense would die down within the next few weeks - when everyone had made their greetings and offers, and he had said his goodbyes and declines.</p><p>Summoning a mirror, he scrutinized his appearance as he thought of all the reunions which would be taking place. A haircut was needed, and as soon as possible. A man his age should never have hair this long. It was about collarbone length, and while he had similar in his younger years, the growing wrinkles between his eyebrows and around his eyes disagreed with it. Yet was he really a man who would look decent with short hair? As far back as he could remember, it had never been shorter than his shoulders... If it got cut any shorter, he might remind himself of his father, and that was a thought which caused his nose to wrinkle. Shoulder length would do just fine, he reasoned. </p>
<p></p><div>
  <p>Or perhaps he wouldn't get it cut at all. No one would think any differently of him with a few more inches. No one thought anything of him now anyways.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>He liked it that way.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>

  </p>
</div><div>
  <p>He tread lightly as he entered Hogwarts' gates, observing the familiar-yet-not grounds with an air of indifference. While his days of schooling had never particularly held positive memories for him, Severus couldn't bring himself to hate the place now, contrary to what he might have thought twenty-five years ago. Perhaps he had grown up, or perhaps he was merely too tired to hang onto the extremities of his youth. Either or, Hogwarts was a well-rounded school with a teaching staff that would not include him in the upcoming year.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Which were exactly the words he told Minerva McGonagall when he sat opposite of her peering gaze from behind the Headmistress' desk. Her exasperation was palpable, yet he had to admit that the old witch still did have the same Gryffindor spirit </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Severus," she began for what seemed like the thousandth time, "you have to realize that the Potions curriculum here at Hogwarts is incredibly fast-paced and demanding. Even a highly-skilled potioneer such as yourself would have a challenge keeping up with the number of classes and students. I understand that becoming a professor is not as exciting as your travels, but it would be equally, if not moreso, rewarding," Headmistress McGonagall explained with a smile weathered down by the fast-paced and demanding nature which she spoke of.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>All of her words did nothing to stop his shaking head. "It's not a challenge that I seek anymore, Minerva. Trust me when I say that it is not the boredom which I grow weary of when thinking of myself as a professor, but the lack of it. I've aged, I've explored. Now, I merely want to continue my research."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Our Potions Master has a private laboratory connected to his chambers-"</p>
</div><div>
  <p>He couldn't hold back his smirk at how her head lifted slightly with confidence when she saw the opportunity to bargain. She really was clueless.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"I have my own private laboratories," Snape cut in.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"With access to very limited and rare ingredients and equipment," McGonagall continued as if she was never interrupted.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Which I'm sure that I could get my hands on just as easily," Severus replied as he stood from the overly-plushed chair. Even though it was her office now, Albus' influence still lingered.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>The witch threw her hands up in defeat. "Is there anything that I can do to convince you to teach? I knew that you'd be difficult to persuade, but by the way Albus spoke, he made it sound like you wanted to be busy!”</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Did he actually say that?"</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Do you know me to waste my own time?" she questioned as she pressed her lips together.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Well by your insistence at the moment," he mocked a contemplative expression, "I would say yes."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>She leaned back in her chair before chuckling heartily and shaking her head. "You haven't changed at all," McGonagall said - this time with a real smile.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>He shrugged. "I have never found a reason to."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Ah, that's how I truly know you've been amiss from the UK for all this time," she sighed. "Everyone and thing change so rapidly here, I'm afraid I have quite the time keeping up.” </p>
</div><div>
  <p>By the look of her office, he didn't doubt her words. The usual prim and perfect Professor McGonagall had been transformed into the cramped and cluttered Headmistress of Hogwarts, and while he oh-so-badly wanted to remark about how the stack of parchment on her desk seemed a little too high, he kept his mouth shut.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Instead, he fiddled with the small feline figure on her desk. "You should try to retire soon also, Minerva. It truly is a one-way trip to insignificance." </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Oh, please," she scoffed and snatched the figurine from him. "You have practically been on a trip for twenty years already."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>He walked across the office and opened the door. "The amount of aching joints I have would surely argue that point."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Was trekking through Saratov last year not the adventure you wrote about in your latest, then?" she smirked.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"I do not lie in my writings, if that is what you're implying."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"I'm simply suggesting that you're susceptible to... literary embellishment." She was prodding, and it was working.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>He narrowed his eyes and tried to conjure all the annoyance he felt, but he couldn't bring himself to maintain the glare towards the old witch. "I regret that Lily ever revealed myself to you."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Me too, Severus. It is sometimes so difficult to hold my tongue around other Headmasters and Mistresses bragging about their former students' successes, when I can't mention how my own is the famous <em>Half-Blood Prince</em>," she giggled.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"I never wanted to use that damn pseudonym,” he grumbled. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"It is a bit dramatic, but you fit the title. I'm not surprised Griggs pushed you to choose it."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Yes..." he lingered, disagreeing with her entirely, but not bothering to refute. "Well, do try to continue holding your tongue. The last thing I need now that I'm back home is fame."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Perhaps that can be an invention of yours in the future," McGonagall proposed. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"What?” </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"A tongue-holding potion."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Possibly." Snape was not going to mention how it was already invented some hundred years ago. Oh, Minerva.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Or a chronic ache relief potion," she suggested. "I'm twice your age and yet don't experience half the pain as you seem to."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"You're twice my age?" he replied in mock disbelief as he carefully placed himself on the other end of the open door. "I would have thought you were at least quadruple my time." </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Snape knew what was coming by the offended gasp he heard as the door slammed shut on his face, missing his nose by a mere centimeter.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Turning on his heel down the twirling staircase, Severus had a lightness in his step which he hadn't felt in months. He had missed these small verbal fisticuffs with Minerva.</p>
</div><div>
  <p><strong>X</strong> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>One reunion down, one more to go for the day, Severus calculated as he trudged through the Ministry doors. Contrary to how he knew Minerva’s intentions, he didn’t have the foggiest of what Albus wanted. Maybe just to bid hello, or maybe the Indonesian law enforcement had found out his real identity and wanted Albus to deport him there so he could be imprisoned - you never really knew with the wizard.  </p>
</div><div>
  <p>But he hoped Albus was in the dark about Indonesia. Merlin, it happened in the 80s. Couldn’t they let it go by now? It was one damn plant.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Do you have an appointment with the Minister, sir?” asked a redheaded boy with an awfully large nose up in the air as if he alone was the sole protector of the Ministry Floo fireplaces.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Unfortunately.”</p>
</div><div>
  <p>“I see...” he murmured with suspicion. “May I inspect your wand?”  </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Severus held out his wand, and the redhead snatched it from him, casting a detection charm.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>When his past spells and locations appeared before them, he furrowed his brow. “It seems that you’ve recently been out of the country, for what purpose?” </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Travel,” he drawled.  </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“To where?” </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Hell if he remembered. “Within the year, or ever?” </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Within the year is sufficient.”</p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Mainly Russia and Uzbekistan. Though I did spend a few weeks in the States.”</p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Why?” the young man asked with a look of surprise. Severus didn’t blame him - he knew he didn’t appear a cultured man. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Because I could,” he snapped back. “Do <em>you</em> not get many days off here?” </p>
</div><div>
  <p>The redhead puckered his lips, and shoved the wand back to Snape. “You’re clear. Use the fireplace furthest for the Minister's office.” </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Marvelous."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>He accepted his wand with a sharp tug before walking through the confusingly long route of Floo systems. Hungary’s system was much simpler - a suggestion which he would mention to Dumbledore. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“He’s waiting,” the guard bit back due to his slow pace. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>With a roll of his eyes, he threw the powder and stepped into the place.  </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Severus Snape!” a jolly voice greeted him as he appeared in an incredibly peacocked room. Blues and greens decorated the office, with various portraits and artifacts clamored upon the walls. How tacky. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Albus,” he spoke calmly, holding out his hand for a polite shake.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>He gave a quick shake and a pat on the back before gesturing for Severus to sit.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>“You’d be shocked at the difference between your warm welcome and the interrogation I received from your loyal lapdog.”</p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Shocked? No, I'd expect nothing less from Percy.” Albus took a seat before unraveling multiple candies from their wrappers, popping them in his mouth. "He's a rather loyal fellow." </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Hufflepuff?” </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Gryffindor.” </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Severus snorted. “Hogwarts Sorting appears less adept by the year.”</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Dumbledore frowned, making his cheeks puff out with the sweets still in his mouth. “I assume that means you declined the Headmistress’ offer at a teaching position.” </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Yes," he crossed his arms, "I had to have the rather unfortunate discussion with her this morning since you planted the seed in her mind.”</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Dumbledore shrugged. “I'm not to blame for what people believe.”</p>
</div><div>
  <p>“You’re the Minister.”</p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Of magic, not mind control.” </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Hmph. Muggles would argue that they're the same."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"A Muggle expert today, are we?" He raised an eyebrow before waving his hand to Summon a piece of parchment, "Shall I owl Minerva and tell her that while you declined being her Potions Master, you're more than able to perform as the Muggles Studies Professor?"</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"You won't make me feel guilty," he sighed, thinking of all of the strings he would have to pull and connections he would have to owl, "I'm finding a perfectly acceptable replacement in lieu of myself."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Good," he Vanished the mocking parchment, "she's far too prickly with Slughorn's retirement. Maybe you should come into contact with him again -  since apparently you two have much in common now."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Snape sat straight up in his seat. "I am <em>nothing</em> like Slughorn."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Quite right. He's almost ninety years old, while you're barely forty. Planning on dying early?" A venomous glare. "Oh, I'm only kidding. Enough of this serious talk already - my life is far too filled with dire decisions as of late. Tell me, how are you faring in London?"</p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Terrific, I haven’t stepped a foot in the city for years.” </p>
</div><div>
  <p>His smile fell, and Snape smirked. “I thought that’s where you purchased a house?” he inquired with a tilt of his head, flopping his hat to the side. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“No, I changed my mind last minute. I’m living in the West Country now." Severus explained with a tap of his finger, "It's much quieter.” </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Dumbledore raised his eyebrows. "Must be quite expensive. Quiet costs a hefty sum nowadays."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"What's your price?" he quipped.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Enough of that." Albus scolded with a wag of his finger, "I have to talk. I'm in politics."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Severus pointed a finger right back at the wizard. "But that also means you can be bought.” </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"So is that what you are doing with your spare time? Investments?"</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"How do you figure?" Severus shifted uncomfortably under his full gaze.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"I'm merely curious," Dumbledore tented his fingers under his chin as he observed him, "since Severus Snape has relinquished the Half-Blood Prince, does he have something else to focus his attention towards?"</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Why do I feel as if you meant to say some<em>one</em> instead?"</p>
  <p>“Minister!” A voice called from outside the door with a quick knock, “Sir, the press are going to be here in a matter of minutes to get your opinion about the Wizengamot decision - oh, you’re not supposed to be having a meeting right now!” </p>
</div><div>
  <p>A frizzy-haired girl emerged hurriedly in the room struggling to balance a rather large pile of papers with the drink she had in her hand, and was shocked to see that the Minister was not alone. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“I'm not?” Dumbledore asked her innocently, and looked back at Snape, who rolled his eyes at the dramatics.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>“No!” she replied frantically, blowing bangs out of her sight. “I never schedule meetings on weekdays!” </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Dumbledore looked at her with a pointed expression. “I could have sworn it was on the agenda.”</p>
</div><div>
  <p>She held up the paper, which Severus assumed was <em>the agenda</em>. “It’s not!” she hissed. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Dumbledore squinted his eyes as if he were truly trying to read it from twenty feet away. “No, no, no. I see it right there,” he confirmed with a nod. “Yes, it reads ‘Meeting with Severus Snape.’”</p>
</div><div>
  <p>She brought the paper down, narrowed her eyebrows to double-check, and then groaned. “Albus!” she yelled and crumpled it up. “Stop making unauthorized changes to the agenda!” she threw him a disapproving look before walking out. “And you better be done and out here in five minutes!” </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Dumbledore turned back with a mischievous grin. "She's been working for me just under a year, and still, I feel she doesn't know me at all."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Your assistant?“</p>
  <p>“Speechwriter.”</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"She looks too young," he replied, focusing on the door which was slammed shut a moment ago.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>“She is. Only nineteen, I believe, but the head upon her shoulders holds more than anyone I know.” </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Severus tried his best not to get offended at that remark, but failed. Dumbledore noticed, of course.</p>
  <p>“Not that I was taking any credit away from my shining Slytherin.”</p>
</div><div>
  <p>He harrumphed. “I am not <em>your</em> Slytherin. Nor am I <em>shining</em>. Unlike your coddled and attention-seeking Gryffindors, I take pride in being self-taught and not seeking fame for all I care to know.”</p>
</div><div>
  <p>“And what it is you care to know these days?” </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“<em>Not</em> idle chat,” he replied shortly, uncrossing his legs to stand. "Which I'm disappointed to have met with you here today. Honestly, I would think you have more to do than wasting time. Your little agenda seems booked, so why am I here?"</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Because it's been over a decade since we've seen each other," Dumbledore's grandfatherly eyes softened, "and I wished to invite you to the Minister's Ball this weekend."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Albus! Get out here now!" the voice from the other side of the door sounded in a tone far too exasperated.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Dumbledore immediately stood with him. "Consider <em>The</em> <em>Daily</em> <em>Prophet</em> your savior this time, Severus, but next time we meet I'd like to have a proper conversation."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>The Minister slipped on a long blue sparkled hat before stepping out. "Goodbye, lad," he said with a wink as Severus saw a camera flash accompanied by the chorus of journalists.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>
    <strong>X</strong>
  </p>
</div><div>
  <p>He would have to decide about the Minister's Ball soon enough if he wanted to maintain his bare minimum amount of politeness. Severus debated on attending, but what would be his reasoning for being invited at all, at least in the public's view? Albus and Minerva would be the only people in attendance who would know his noteworthiness other than Lily, and surely people would question why the two-decade missing Severus Snape had decided to make his reintroduction into society at the limited and highly sought-after Minster's Ball.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Tired from his interactions with both those elders, he canceled his meeting with Griggs, who was, in the most simple terms, extremely pleased, considering that he forgot about it and planned on a cards game tonight anyway. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Today had gone, for the most part, exactly as he expected. Nothing had changed, and he found it disturbing how easily all memories of England and Scotland came flooding back to him now that he was immersed in it once again. Leafing through his papers for the second time, he stumbled upon a letter from Lily.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>He was surprised by how much restraint they showed already. He had expected himself to be inviting her over the moment he returned. Flicking it open, he brought out his glasses to read the little neat print.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>
    <em>Sev,</em>
  </p>
</div><div>
  <p>
    <em>YOU'RE BACK! I know it's only been a few days and you've probably barely settled in, but... what do you say about me cooking a little "Welcome Home" dinner tomorrow night? (You better say yes!)</em>
  </p>
</div><div>
  <p>
    <em>You can properly meet Harry after all this time! Merlin, when was the last you even saw him? When he was only a few days old? I'm so excited, Sev! I know we've been writing practically every week for all these years, but seeing you is going to make me cry. It's heartbreaking! I've become old while you've been off becoming every woman's dream romance!</em>
  </p>
</div><div>
  <p>
    <em>James has been going crazy from the number of times I've cleaned the house preparing for you, so the first thing you better say when you walk in is "Bloody hell! What a clean house!" or else it'll all have been in vain. Oh, and use the back door when you come. Harry broke the front door the other day when dueling his friend. It's a long story, but what my son lacks in grace he makes up with talent. Maybe you can duel him one day and teach him a few of your tricks. (<u>NO</u> DARK ARTS ALLOWED IN MY HOUSE, SEVERUS!)</em>
