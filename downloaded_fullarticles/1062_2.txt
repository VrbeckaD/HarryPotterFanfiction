    <p>Prologue</p><p>Artemis Prince was technically the firstborn of the Prince family; she had presided over her brother's Bonding and the Wiccaning of his daughters back in December. It had been fun planning her brother's bonding; the conversation after the Wiccaning with Luna had been full of pitfalls. For a Ravenclaw, that girl was too quick, of course. Luna was in her brother's year with Colin. So they had graduated last June, Luna had gone on to take over the Quibbler and probably to continue her mother's charms research.</p><p>Artemis wanted to be a potioneer for St. Mungos just like papa, she planned to take over as Head of Slytherin and Potions Mistress when papa finally became Headmaster but that might take a while.</p><p>Despite Luna's assurances that she'd given up on Hermione during the trial, she couldn't help being jealous. The cool platinum of the bracelet on her wrist made her look down, it was beautiful…</p><p>At first glance she'd thought it was silver, however, silver could taint potions and burn her dad. A Ravenclaw would know that, so the bracelet was platinum instead. It had a moonstone shaped in the form of a full moon. The face of the full moon bore the horn of Artemis, on either side of the full moon where the moon phases that had come before and then after. The other phases were created with pieces of moonstone and onyx.</p><p>It was the most beautiful thing she owned, and she never took it off. Artemis could only hope to that Luna could come to love her… if she couldn't it would break her heart.</p><p> </p><p align="center">XoooooX</p><p> </p><p>Luna took off her spectacles; the frames were in the shapes of half-moons. They were her mother Demeter's glasses, she didn't normally need them but for reading, she did, so she'd kept the frames and replaced the lenses. They made her feel closer to her mother.</p><p>Courting…</p><p>Never in her life had she imagined having to do that, loving Hermione and knowing the girl would never love her back had made that an impossible dream.</p><p>She had always wondered who was cursing, hexing and jinxing her tormentors in school, yet she would never have guessed it was the friendless Slytherin daughter of Professors Prince and Lupin-Prince.</p><p>Artemis Prince was so shy, it was almost heartbreaking and yet she was still a Slytherin Prefect. She seemed cold, remote and yet she had the ability to plan a beautiful bonding for her brother and a Wiccaning for her nieces.</p><p>The delight in Artemis' eyes when Luna had said she wanted to see if they could both learn to care about one another. Who in this world could she find that would love her as Artemis did? No one, Artemis was brilliant and took after her father Professor Prince, wildly talented at magic especially potions and she lived in the library almost as much as a Ravenclaw or Hermione.</p><p>She wanted to make Artemis smile more because she had a beautiful smile…</p><p>It had been a few days after the trial and it was time to speak to Artemis' fathers. Artemis was still underage and if she was serious she had to request permission to court her. It had originally been enough to agree to date her but a girl like Artemis who had been teased and tormented deserved more then to be treated as if she were a casual fling. Luna wanted to do this properly, as a descendant of Ravenclaw she could Bond to whomever she pleased.</p><p>Right now, she was sure she wanted Artemis to be the consort of Lady Lovegood. The Lovegood estate was unusually because it was entailed upon the female line rather than the male, thus only the senior-most female would inherit. When her mother died, her family estate was held in trust for her. Her father Xenophilius was the elder son of a younger son of the House of Malfoy, making her and Draco second cousins. It wasn't discussed openly because her father had been disowned for bonding in defiance of his uncle Abraxus Malfoy.</p><p> </p><p> </p>
