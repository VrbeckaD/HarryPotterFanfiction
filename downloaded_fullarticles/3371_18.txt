    <p>Pansy squealed with sheer utter excitement and delight as a large package wrapped in delicate soft black paper with a stunning silver bow was handed to her by one of the most poised, handsome and well-behaved owls she had ever encountered.</p><p>A smile beamed from ear to ear as she slowly makes her way to her bed, placing the package down gently.  </p><p>Two months and 13 days she has been waiting and now it finally has arrived.</p><p>“Open it then” says Daphne Greengrass, her Slytherin room mate and long term friend “you’ve been going on and in about it forever” she says smiling </p><p>It’s true Pansy had been talking about the arrival of this package, ever since her family had visited a gorgeous wizarding town in Italy, just out of the fashion capital Milan.  </p><p>She remembers distinctly walking  down the cobbled street that shimmered and gleaned in the sunlight.  The town oozed class and style, but it wasn’t cold, it was warm inviting and completely intoxicating. Filled with beautiful immaculately dressed  people sipping their short blacks or enjoying a gelato.<br/>
Shops lined the cobbled streets offering cloaks and robes of distinction and class, but there was one shop that had captured her completely Madam Bellance’s  La Bella Figura.<br/>
Standing bold against the other shops Madam Bellance’s  La Bella Figura transported you to a world of luxury and finery.   A wide marble staircase swept you up to a floor filled with some of the finest and most expensive clothing, shoes, fragrances and accessories in the world.<br/>
Amazing fabrics that felt like water caressed her finger tips beneath the immense chandelier. It was heavenly, the ideal place to find the perfect outfit for the mid-year Ball  at Hogwarts.<br/>
It was here that Madam Bellance one of the most voluptuous and beautiful women Pansy had ever seen, convinced, rather easily if she’s honest, her and her mother that none of the exquisite gowns here, despite being one of a kind would suit Pansy as well as something made just for her to suit her personality and femininity.  Something spectacular for such a special occasion like a Ball.<br/>
Pansy had no idea what to expect but she trusted Madam Bellance implicitly, especially given the time Madam said it would take to craft the perfect garment.  </p><p>Butterflies flutter excitedly in her belly as she slowing pulls at the ribbon of the parcel.  She’s never usually so eloquent and patient with the packaging of presents, but a package like this deserves utter respect. </p><p>She gasps as she pulls back the flaps of the parcel. Sitting beautifully in the box is a dress but not just any dress the most gorgeous dress Pansy has ever seen.  </p><p>Smiling broadly, she gently holds up the dress, eyeing off every stunning detail.<br/>
Form fitting with a low cut front and back, low enough to seduce but not too low that it would be deemed scandalous or cheap.   The material shimmers and moves like it was alive.  Black with fine trace elements of green and silver that dance with the movement of with dress, like the scales of a snake.  Magic is embedded into every delicate thread, the allure of the dress was completely hypnotising. There was no doubt that she would steal the spotlight of the Ball in this dress.  </p><p>“It is beautiful” gasps Millicent</p><p>By now her other roommates had come to see the dress she had been talking about since her trip. </p><p>“It is gorgeous” says Daphne </p><p>“You’ll look great in it”. says Tracey</p><p>Pansy couldn’t help but smile, happiness swelling in her chest, this was the exact reaction she had hoped for. if they react like this to her just holding the dress, imagine their reaction to when she actually tries it on.   </p><p> “Actually” the sly grin on Tracey’s face has Pansy narrowing her eyes  “it would look great on Daphne too, wouldn’t it Millicent?” </p><p>“What?” says Pansy her mouth agape in shock </p><p>“What do you mean by that? asks Daphne still smiling </p><p>“Well yes, the dress would look on you too” says Pansy </p><p>An uneasiness churns in Pansy’s belly,  she has the distinct feeling that she is being set up for something but she isn’t quite sure what.  </p><p>“It would and I don’t have a dress for the Ball yet” says Daphne</p><p>“Well you’re not getting this one” </p><p>“Care to wager on that?” says Tracy  mischievously</p><p>“You wouldn’t dare?” gasps Parkinson </p><p>“Wouldn’t I?” she says giggling along with her fellow friends </p><p>Pansy can only stare open mouthed at her roommates who are now giggling mischievously. Her brain struggling to formulate thoughts, her pulse quickens for the unknown.  </p><p>It was a long standing tradition, as far back as Salazar Slytherin himself,  in the House of Slytherin to place wagers and dares with fellow housemates, all in the name of fun.  Of course, for the wager to be fun something had to be on the table to win, and when a dare was cast you had no option to accept or face the consequences, which normally included a vile of the truth serum,  Veritaserum, and therefore total public humiliation as the whole Slytherin House has the opportunity to fire questions at you, and with the likely return of You Know Who, it wasn’t safe either.<br/>
There were rules of course you could not dare someone to cast an unforgivable, force someone to conduct a sexual act or let other students from other houses in on their little game.  </p><p>Pansy swallows hard. Tracey still had not forgiven her for making her streak through the common room in just her bra and underwear and Millicent was still very upset at Pansy when she lost her dare and had to drink your ginormous goblets of bat blood soup from Honeydukes.  How was Pansy to know Millicent was allergic to the sweet and would spend three days tied to the lavatory. </p><p>She shifts uncomfortably, her mind ticks over wondering what the three witches could have conjured up.  Whatever it was she was not going to give up this dress.  Would she be willing to run naked through the Great Hall to keep the dress, the answer was yes, Merlín she would even kiss Crabbe, or a bloody house elf to keep the dress.<br/>
Whatever scenario she imagined them dating her  she couldn’t imagine failing this frock was to important to her plus her mother would kill her, it cost a small fortune too. </p><p>“And if I win?” ventures Pansy</p><p>“You keep the dress of course, and get to anything else you like’ says Daphne leaning against Tracey a look of sheer delight imprinted on her face </p><p>“Fine” huffs Pansy crossing her arms defensively it’s not like she had any choice in  the matter. </p><p>The girls laugh menacingly, they look at each other wondering who will the one to tell Pansy her dare </p><p>“You have to be nice to Granger” blurts our Daphne </p><p>“For a month”</p><p>“No, until the ball” chips in Millicent earning her a deadly stare </p><p>Words escape her as she stares into their bright eyes shining with fresh tears of laughter. Her own eyes wide in disbelief, she could not believe the dare they had bestowed upon her.</p><p>“You have got to be bloody kidding me? That’s impossible she’s a...”</p><p>“That includes not picking on her -“ </p><p>“But her hair”  protests Pansy </p><p>“Maybe even defending when others do” </p><p>“But she’s annoying, everyone picks -“</p><p>“Helping her” continues Daphne ignoring Pansy’s protests </p><p>“Oh this is just ridiculous” huffs Parkinson flapping her arms to her side </p><p>“Basically Pansy Parkinson you just have to be a nice person to Hermione Granger, or you could -”</p><p>“Or what” exclaims Pansy, any other dare would be better and easier than this </p><p>“You could hand over that gorgeous dress now” laughs Daphne falling backwards on the bed laughing until tears begin to roll down her cheeks </p><p>Pansy let's get fingers slowly trace along the material, the feeling seduces her senses.  This dress means the world to Pansy. </p><p>Fine” she huffs “I’ll be nice to Granger.” says Pansy</p><p>“Brilliant” says Tracey clapping her hands “I’ll let the boys know” </p><p>“The boys?!  What in Merlin’s name have the boys got to do with this?”</p><p>“They’ve got bets going on whether you would take the challenge and be able to do it” smiles Tracy sweetly “most of Slytherin has”</p><p>A dull blow hits Pansy in the stomach as the magnitude of this dare sinks in.  It would be her against a good portion of the Slytherin House wanting to win their side of the bet.  She flops herself in the bed defeated and deflated this was not going to be easy. She needs a plan of attack if she is going to get through these next six weeks.  </p><p>“I think you can do it” says Millicent in an failed attempt to console Pansy if her laughter was anything to go by </p><p>“Shut it Bulstrode”</p>
