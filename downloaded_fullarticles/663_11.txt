  <em> "Run along to Hogwarts now... or stumble, as it were. I shall be seeing you again... very soon." </em>
</p><p>Thank Merlin his voice didn't betray him; the Dark Lord was perilously close to losing his composure when he Disapparated. While Harry dragged himself back to Hogwarts, Voldemort collapsed onto the bed in his chambers and cast off his robes with a blast of magic, covered his face with a pillow, and screamed.</p><p>
  <em> What had he just done?! </em>
</p><p>Sweet Salazar, every inch of that boy must have been catered exactly to his tastes -- he hadn't even seen Potter fully nude, yet, and he found he couldn't wait. The way his nemesis <em> looked </em>at him, the way he'd gone to his knees feverish with the desire to please him --</p><p>And. The way he'd taken him in his mouth so readily. <em> Oh Merlin. </em> No one had <em> ever </em>done that on the first try.</p><p><em> Beautiful, </em> Harry had said, breathless, and moved to put his mouth on him.</p><p>There had been so little urge in this new body for physical acts, since his resurrection, that Voldemort had nearly worried it lacked the function. Now, he ached in the most pleasurable of ways, just <em> remembering </em>what had just happened. He groaned into the pillow, reaching to take himself in hand.</p><p>He sank into a meditative trance, stroking himself slowly as he used his perfect recall to bring up every sensation of Harry's mouth around him; every enthusiastic minute of that experience. Every <em> moan </em> the boy had made around him, when he stroked his cheek, tugged at his hair, <em> praised him. </em></p><p>Before he could climax just from the memory, Voldemort stopped, breathing harshly in the dark room. "You've done so well," he murmured into the pillow, reliving. Harry had. He'd done <em> so </em> well. To borrow a word he hadn't used in a long time: <em> fuck. </em></p><p>And then.</p><p>"Climb into my lap, Harry," he murmured, rephrasing the question as an order. (Because he knew Harry <em> would. </em> He <em> had.) </em></p><p>Oh. Oh <em> Salazar, </em> the sounds the boy made then. That <em> gasp, </em> alone, was making his cock twitch.</p><p>Harry Potter, golden child of the Light, had never experimented beyond the most basic of acts. had never -- <em> "nngh." </em> -- had never even <em> fingered </em>himself before. He'd... he'd shied away from Voldemort's fingers, thinking the Dark Lord was about to --</p><p>Was about to --</p><p>
  <em> to plunge deep into that tight hole without preparing him, and hear him scream in agony and clench mercilessly around his cock, oh yes, yes, that would have been the greatest thing -- </em>
</p><p><em> "Feels weird," </em>Harry had groaned, instead, as he took each finger so well, trembling like a leaf in Voldemort's lap.</p><p>He bit down on the pillow to muffle his snarl, toes curling against the sheets, as he brought himself right to the edge again and stopped. Voldemort would not rush the reenactment, would not come until his boy did.</p><p>The first touch to Harry's prostate, the way it had sent him into a convulsion, squeezing Voldemort's fingers -- the way he'd <em> cried, </em> the more he pleasured him, <em> "please, I can't --" </em></p><p><em> Please I can't please I can't please I can't </em> he would never tire of that trio of words, so strained, so desperate.</p><p>He'd been so good for him. "Remember this feeling," Voldemort groaned. "It will be even better when I -- hah -- when I take you." (He'd wanted so badly to take him right then, not to wait, not to tease. Whatever had stayed his hand was not here in his imagination.)</p><p>Harry had <em> screamed </em>for him, had come apart with utter ecstasy writ upon his face -- Voldemort was coming, again, spilling onto his hand, his stomach, with a low moan into the pillow that sounded particularly obscene even to his own ears.</p><p>He flung the spit-sodden pillow off the bed and lay gasping for breath, chest heaving in the aftermath of his orgasm. This. This was something he'd gone without for far too long. How had he forgotten how good it was?</p><p>Voldemort didn't bother to clean himself up. He let his mind slip into slumber without moving a muscle, and if he dreamed, he did not remember.</p><p> </p><p>He couldn't stop thinking about it.</p><p>Every time Harry let his mind wander it was going back to Room Thirteen. To the way he'd knelt and swallowed that massive, perfect cock, not even caring that it belonged to his mortal enemy. To the feeling of Dark Lord's hand in his hair. To the --</p><p>"Harry, mate, seriously, wake up already. History's over, we're going to dinner." Ron snapped him out of his reverie for the third or fourth time that day. "You've been spacing out a lot lately. Are you all right?"</p><p><em> Very good, Harry, </em> the memory of Voldemort purred in his ear.</p><p>Harry went very red. "Yes, I'm alright. Erm. I need to use the loo. Don't wait up for me." Thank Merlin for loose-fitting robes and an unpopular toilet near the History of Magic classroom, because Harry's erection wasn't going anywhere on its own.</p><p>Nobody was present to notice his 'situation' in the corridors; nor was anyone there in the loo when he bolted into the stall furthest from the door and sank down against the stone wall, dropping his satched against the door. Harry hurried to unfasten his belt and tug down his tenting trousers and pants. Godric, he hadn't even touched himself and he was this hard?</p><p><em> Lean forward, </em> the memory told him, and Harry took a wide stance, bracing himself against the wall with one arm, holding the other hand up in front of him. What had Voldemort said? "...Oleum," Harry whispered, and in a blink, his fingers were slick with that same warm oil. His cock twitched, interested, at the sight.</p><p>His legs were shaking already, but Harry refused to let himself crumple into a heap until he finished. He grunted, reaching around to slide his fingers over his arse and slather the ring of muscle there in conjured oil.</p><p><em> I'll tell you how to do this to yourself... </em> He slipped his fingertip in, just a little, and bit back a groan. It would only feel weird until he found that spot again; he just had to open himself up a bit...</p><p><em> ...so you can get used to it... </em> Harry rocked his hips back onto his finger, panting as he slid in the second beside it. In retrospect, it would've been best to use a bed for this; but he wouldn't have made it all the way to Gryffindor Tower in his earlier state, and especially not now.</p><p><em> ...before our next meeting. </em> He scissored his fingers, stretching open to fit the third in, and then --</p><p><em> "Sweet Salazar," </em> Harry gasped, knees buckling. "That's good, it's so good --" he muttered under his breath, eyes rolling back. Even the lightest of touches to the firm little bundle right there was electrifying him.</p><p>
  <em> So good it hurts, is it not? </em>
</p><p>"More," Harry moaned, "more --"</p><p>
  <em> You're close, aren't you, Harry? </em>
</p><p>"I'm gonna --"</p><p>
  <em> You've been so good for me today. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> "Oh --" </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Remember this feeling. </em>
</p><p>"I can't --"</p><p>
  <em> It will be even better when I take you. </em>
</p><p>Harry threw his head back, pressing his cheek against the stone wall. His cock was weeping sticky, clear precome. <em> "Please," </em> he sobbed.</p><p><em> What a lovely sight you make. </em> Harry pressed hard on his prostate and moaned again, louder, lips moving to mouth the Dark Lord's name.</p><p><em> It will be even better when I deflower you, </em> Voldemort's voice promised.</p><p>Harry came, clenching around his fingers without meaning to. The wall, the floor, the discarded clothes at his ankles -- all spattered with white. When his vision stopped being blurry around the edges, he wiped his hand on his leg and cast Evanesco several times, blinking away the spots.</p><p>Then, eventually dressed, he staggered to the sink to wash his face.</p><p>Six more days until the next Hogsmeade weekend. He could do this.</p><p> </p><p>Harry could not do this.</p><p>He'd actually penned a letter begging Voldemort to <em> come fuck him immediately, he needed it </em> so bad, <em> please -- </em> and burnt it, vanishing the ashes. Twice.</p><p>Now it was Thursday, and Harry was more desperate than he'd ever been for anything in his life. He snuck out of the Tower after curfew under the Cloak, leaving Ron a note that he'd be in the Room of Requirement in the morning so please cover for him, and took the passage underneath the Whomping Willow to get to the Shrieking Shack.</p><p>Once there, safely outside of Hogwarts' wards (and wasn't that a thought), he cast his Patronus, which flickered a bit with his conflicting emotions, and hissed a message to Voldemort in Parseltongue. The stag, its antlers a bit spikier than usual at a glance, faded through the wall; he hoped it would send the message properly.</p><p>(He could only imagine what it would be like if the message were translated to English, and someone else was in the room when Voldemort received it.)</p><p>Now, he just needed to Apparate through this wall, and he'd be out. What had the Apparition teacher been telling them? Determination, Destination, something else -- three Ds. Harry knew he wanted <em> one </em> D, very badly. If he could just get <em> outside, </em> literally four feet to his left -- it couldn't be much different from the incident with the roof, years ago --</p><p>He spun on his heel and felt as if he were floating in darkness, moving in a rush of wind. When he opened his eyes, he was leaning against the other side of the Shrieking Shack. <em> Yes, </em> he'd done it!</p><p>Compared to getting out of Hogwarts, getting into Hogsmeade was a walk in the park, and yet every step he took, running down the hill to the outskirts of the village with his cloak fluttering in the breeze, his stomach clenched, nerves warring with need.</p><p>Several feet from the Hog's Head, Harry realized he'd forgotten to change out of his school robes. Could he just... sneak in? Under the Cloak? He didn't have enough skill at Transfiguring clothing to prevent himself from losing his robes entirely in the process.</p><p>Luckily, he didn't have to wait long before a large wizard threw the door open, giving Harry an opportunity to slip into the bar behind him and sneak over to the stairs with no one the wiser. Room Thirteen was just upstairs, now -- Harry swallowed thickly, trying to control himself. What if Voldemort hadn't gotten his Patronus? What if he hadn't arrived yet? What if he wasn't going to bother --</p><p>A tall figure in a grey hooded cloak opened the door to the Hog's Head and drew several Galleons from his sleeve, setting them on the counter in front of Aberforth. "Room thirteen, for the night," the man huffed, sounding... out of breath.</p><p>Harry's stomach jumped. He was <em> here. </em></p><p>Voldemort -- it must be Voldemort, Harry was certain of it -- ascended the staircase at such a pace he might well be gliding; Harry stayed close behind him under the Cloak. At the door, the Dark Lord rolled his shoulders, leaning against the frame with the key in his hand, and muttered to himself, "...better get here soon... can't wait much longer."</p><p>He unlocked the door and entered the room in a flash, closing the door behind him. Harry bit his lip, weak in the knees. Now he had to open the door...</p><p> </p><p>Voldemort was a practiced liar of the highest sort, and yet he would not have believed himself for a minute had he said he wasn't counting down the days until the date of the next 'meeting' in the Hog's Head. Who could blame him, really, when the first had been so productive?</p><p>He wasn't the only one driven to distraction, either -- that much was obvious enough, when he found himself drawn into the boy's mind whenever he retired to his chambers. Harry... Harry was <em> desperate. </em></p><p> </p><p>The Dark Lord might have been facilitating their connection a bit in hopes of getting more out of it. <em> Might </em> have been savoring every sound that came out of Harry's mouth as he fucked himself on his fingers, coming untouched every time. Was <em> certainly </em>getting stirred up by the way the boy had begun to moan his name when he came, as if he knew -- or wished -- the Dark Lord were there with him.</p><p>So when the gleaming silver shape of a stag Patronus materialized into his office late Thursday night, just as he was getting ready to reach for Harry's mind again, he was almost prepared for it.</p><p>It wasn't quite a stag, though, he noticed in the first few seconds. Harry's Patronus had been documented in detail by those servants and spies who had seen it in combat already -- and this one was different. Vaguely frightening. Its antlers were thorny, pointed, angled to <em> impale, </em> and its eyes were the slits of a viper's. When it opened its mouth to deliver its message, Voldemort saw, only partly surprised, that it had a forked tongue and a row of gleaming fangs akin to a Basilisk.</p><p>Prey turned predator. A beast of inverted nature.</p><p><em> "I can't wait any longer," </em> the Patronus hissed in Harry's voice. <em> "It's driving me mad. Fuck me, </em> please, <em> I need it -- Room Thirteen." </em></p><p>He was left reeling with the intensity of the lust that plea invoked, when the stag faded away. A lesser wizard could have Splinched himself Apparating with such haste to Hogsmeade from the opposite side of the country.</p><p>"Room thirteen, for the night," he told the barkeep, overpaying for it (he would overpay a hundred times as much if he'd been asked to) and ascending the steps in a fervor.</p><p>"Harry'd better get here soon," he murmured, pausing for breath at the door. "I can't wait much longer."</p><p>He had only just gotten into the room and begun to ward it when the door opened again, seemingly on its own. Voldemort had cast off his cloak already; he froze, surprised, and interrupted his spellwork to aim a Stunner at the doorway.</p><p><em> "-- fuck wait it's me --" </em> hissed a voice, nearly slamming the door in the haste to close it. With a sound like the shifting of fabric, Potter emerged from underneath an invisibility cloak, wild-eyed. Ah, that made more sense.</p><p>They stood there a moment, watching each other. Harry had neglected to change out of his school robes; he was leaning back against the wall, red-faced and disheveled. The green in his eyes had been reduced to a narrow ring around wide, lust-dilated pupils. He was breathing heavily just looking at Voldemort.</p><p>The Dark Lord didn't hesitate in crossing the room and trapping Harry there, looming over him; not when he was rewarded with the boy's breath hitching like that, with the quiet hissed 'yes' that escaped his lips.</p><p><em> "Harry," </em> he breathed, <em> "it is so good to see you." </em></p><p>He tangled the fingers of one hand in the boy's hair and pulled, tilting his head back, to claim those reddened lips with his own.</p><p> </p><p>Harry hadn't kissed anyone like this before. Had, at best, considered the whole experience 'wet' in an unattractive way. Now he knew he'd just been -- kissing the wrong person, before.</p><p>(Ironic, wasn't it?)</p><p>He groaned into the Dark Lord's mouth, shuddering at the heat of the invading tongue and the grip Voldemort had gotten on his hair, and lifted trembling hands to the front of the man's robes, clutching for balance. If this was what kissing was supposed to be like, he'd been misled. They certainly didn't show snogging in the mags.</p><p>Merlin, he needed <em> more. </em> Harry wrapped his arms around Voldemort's waist, taking a more aggressive approach now. Voldemort tasted like both wine and grapes, sweet and tart and faintly alcoholic; Harry had no idea what <em>his</em> mouth tasted like, but soon they would probably taste the same.</p><p>Harry suppressed a whine as Voldemort pulled his mouth away -- <em> "Haven't finished... warding the room," </em> the Dark Lord gasped out, clearly as reluctant to part as Harry was. <em> "Can't skimp on... security... wait a moment longer --" </em></p><p>So engrossed had he been in the sensation of lips and tongue and teeth against his own, Harry hadn't realized how much he'd needed to breathe, but now that he had free access to air again, he nodded dazedly through shuddering breaths of his own, supporting himself just barely on shaking legs. <em> "Where do you... want me?" </em>he panted, looking around the room. The chairs from before were still there, by the fire; but now Harry took notice of the rest of the room, where before he'd been utterly distracted by the Dark Lord's presence and not even thought about it.</p><p>There was a large bed on the opposite side of the room, for example, with large pillows and dark sheets; Harry worried his lip between his teeth, thinking about what they might do there.</p><p>Because he had come here to be fucked, and he hadn't forgotten <em> that </em>, no matter how pleasurable snogging had been.</p><p>Voldemort, it seemed, agreed. <em> "The bed." </em></p><p> </p><p><em> The bed, </em> he'd said, not at all prepared for the sight Harry made sitting at the end of it, still fully clothed, with his hands in his lap and his lip in his teeth. How he could still look so innocent with that pretty red mouth and that flush on his cheeks, Voldemort didn't know. Perhaps Harry would <em> always </em>look innocent, even after he'd taken that from him.</p><p>Even after he'd been inside him, seen and felt the honey-sweetness of his ecstasy -- tasted the salt of his tears, of his skin, the faint bitterness of his ejaculate --</p><p>Voldemort resolved to set up a wardstone for this, for the next time, so he would not have to make them wait while he cast the necessary spells. It was agony to wait, to restrain himself, when he had Harry <em> right there, </em> watching him with such desire in his eyes.</p><p>Finally, <em> finally, </em> the last spell was in place, and the Dark Lord could say and do the things he wanted to so badly. He pocketed his wand, rolling his shoulders to ease the tension of his vigorous spellcasting, and took several steps toward the bed, loosening his tie and shedding clothes layer by layer. Harry was visibly entranced by each movement, hands coming up to fumble at the knot of his school tie; he gazed open-mouthed at the expanse of bare chest exposed as Voldemort unbuttoned his shirt with a gesture, shrugging it off entirely in his haste to feel Harry's skin against his own.</p><p><em> "I have longed for this," </em> he confessed, unbuckling his belt. He stood over Harry now, the fire casting his shadow dramatically over the boy and the bed. His nemesis had angled his head up to look at him, utterly failing to undress himself and seemingly having forgotten the task at all.</p><p><em> "Me too," </em> Harry breathed, <em> "I've been unable to think of anything else." </em> He worried the tie between his fingers and blinked, realizing his lack of progress. <em> "Will you, um, will you undress me?" </em>He blushed again, averting his gaze down to Voldemort's crotch, and bit his lip at the sight of tented, damp fabric.</p><p>Voldemort leaned in, trailing his hand down the side of Harry's neck. It drew a shudder and a gasp from the boy, and he could feel the way his pulse raced under his skin at the touch. It was tempting, so tempting, to just Banish Harry's clothes off entirely -- but no, he restrained himself again, because the expressions that crossed his face as the Dark Lord gently took off each layer by hand, that growing impatience, were a far richer reward.</p><p>And when he got to Harry's trousers, the way Harry stiffened, flinched, the way his breath stuttered at the brush of knuckles against his stomach --<em> sublime. </em> He was <em> nervous, </em> again; he laid a hand on the Dark Lord's forearm, stilling his movements, and undid the trouser buttons himself, tugging the material down over the curve of his arse. "I'm," Harry panted, slipping out of Parseltongue in the heat of the moment, "I've been imagining this and... I've been lying the other way. How do you... how do you want me?"</p><p><em> Every way, </em> Voldemort thought immediately. <em> "Either way," </em> he said aloud. <em> "I had envisioned you on your back, first, however, that I might take you in my mouth. Would you like that, Harry?" </em></p><p><em> "Oh," </em> his boy gasped, shifting on the bed. "I hadn't even thought of that. Ah... okay, I'll climb up..?"</p><p><em> "Allow me," </em> Voldemort purred, lifting Harry bodily and moving him up into the middle of the bed. He tugged off his shoes, his socks, his trousers. The pants left underneath were washed-out white; it was such a contrast with the rest of his garments that the Dark Lord almost laughed. <em> "Remind me," </em> he murmured thoughtfully, hooking a finger under the waistband, <em> "to buy you black silk underwear, later." </em></p><p><em> "I'd -- never be able to wear it,” </em> Harry gasped, watching the last of his clothing be dragged slowly down to expose him. <em> "Mmh, I'd get distracted knowing where it came from." </em> He lifted his hips, facilitating the stripping-away of the garment, and Voldemort pulled it off without further ado, relishing how the boy spread his legs once they were freed of the fabric.</p><p>He slid a hand up one leg, kissing up Harry's thigh; the scrape of his teeth over the soft skin was intoxicating for both of them, going by Harry's soft sounds. He pressed his face into the crease at the juncture of leg and hip, breathing deeply of his boy, and savoring the way it made Harry moan again, pawing ineffectually at the back of his head. "Oh," Harry breathed, "I --"</p><p><em> "Do you remember," </em> Voldemort spoke against his skin, tasting the clean sweat gathered so near Harry's most sensitive places with the end of his forked tongue, <em> "what you said to me, when you first glimpsed my cock in person?" </em> He heard the way Harry exhaled sharply at the vulgar word, felt the way his erection twitched where it lay against his cheek.</p><p><em> "Beautiful," </em> the Dark Lord quoted, and moved to take Harry down to the root in one motion, swallowing around the boy's throbbing member without hesitating. Harry's toes curled, and he fisted his hands in the sheets, groaning as if pained. It was easy, so easy, to do this to him, to wreck him with only his mouth -- wordlessly, Voldemort conjured oil in his free hand, reaching to slick up the ring of muscle as he pleasured him.</p><p>Harry's back arched at the intrusion; it was easier, Voldemort noticed with relish, to penetrate him digitally than it had been the first time. He pulled off of Harry's cock, licking at the bead of precome welling up on the end, to smile at him. <em> "I see you've been practicing as I suggested." </em></p><p><em> "I have," </em> Harry groaned, <em> "I've been -- fucking myself on my fingers, ah, like you told me to --" </em></p><p>Voldemort's forked tongue licked a stripe up his shaft, teasing one tip into the slit on the head. Harry made a sound like a shriek, thighs tensing. <em> "Don't -- I'll -- I'll come," </em> he cried, <em> "oh please --" </em></p><p>Working him open now with his finger, the Dark Lord didn't reply, and most certainly didn't oblige the boy's request not to wring him dry. He slipped the second finger in just in time to brush up against Harry's prostate. Harry let out an obscene, intensely erotic noise, arching off the bed as he came, and the Dark Lord continued to stretch him through his orgasm, enjoying every second of his boy's reactions while he swallowed down every spurt from his cock.</p><p><em> "Such a good boy you are," </em> he purred, <em> "preparing yourself for me every day as though I might appear and fill you right then." </em> Harry moaned, throwing an arm over his face. <em> "And I would have, too," </em> he added, slipping the third finger inside. <em> "You would have been so tight for me..." </em></p><p>Bless his refractory period, Harry was already plumping up again. <em> "Please," </em> he sobbed, <em> "fuck me, fuck me, put it in --" </em></p><p>And damned if that didn't make his cock twitch with interest more than anything else he'd done so far. <em> "All right," </em> the Dark Lord agreed, pulling his fingers out and spelling them clean. <em> "I will." </em></p><p> </p><p><em> I will, </em> said that voice, low with lust. The two words struck Harry like a gong -- <em> I will I will I will </em> <b> <em>I will</em> </b> <em> . </em> He curled his toes into the sheets, gone taut with the intensity of his renewed need. How was it that he could come, and then want this even more than before?</p><p>Weight shifted on the mattress around him now, hands pressing down at either side of Harry's waist, knees digging in below his arse. <em> "Harry," </em> Voldemort murmured, just as the blunt, broad head of that cock slicked against his oiled, sticky hole. It was so <em> big </em>, he could already feel it just from the head.</p><p>He'd just come, but his erection was almost fully hard again with anticipation. And...</p><p><em> "I'm scared," </em> Harry admitted in a quiet voice, shuddering as it pressed against, into him, little by little. His breath was coming faster, nails digging into the sheets. <em> "I'm scared it's too big it won't fit </em> <b> <em>please</em> </b> <em> --" </em></p><p>The Dark Lord shushed him, running one hand up his thigh. <em> "I'll take care of you, Harry," </em> he promised, breath hot against Harry's skin, and the insistent pressure continued, slowly, so slowly, coaxing its way in.</p><p> </p><p>Oh, his boy was shaking in his arms, now, gone tense the minute he began to slide into him. The Dark Lord sighed happily against Harry's neck, waiting for the moment to push in deeper. <em> "Relax, Harry," </em> he breathed in his ear, <em> "I'll fill you up so nicely. You'll be so good and tight for me, yes..." </em></p><p><em> "Ah," </em> his boy gasped, trying so valiantly to let him in. Voldemort knew he could have taken his time, opened him up with one more finger, but <em> it had been Harry who asked him to fuck him, </em> hadn't it?</p><p><em> "You asked me," </em> the Dark Lord reminded him. <em> "You asked me, so you'll take it, won't you?" </em></p><p>As if in answer, Harry let out a little sob and relaxed again, just enough that he could ease himself in a little more. <em> "Hurts," </em> his boy gasped, <em> "so big, please --" </em></p><p><em> "Yes... that's right," </em> he groaned, watching Harry's face with satisfaction as he worked his way in deeper, shallow thrusts in and out to slick his way. <em> "You're just the right fit, Harry. Ah, yes... I did so enjoy seeing you come apart in my arms last week. And this will be... even... better." </em></p><p>And he pulled out a little, adjusted his angle, and thrust in again --</p><p>Harry arched his back with a shout, legs coming up to cross ankles behind the Dark Lord's waist. He was a <em> sight, </em> like this, a fever dream -- open mouth gasping for air. Voldemort moved his arm away from his face so he could see the way his boy strained and thrashed, threw his head back, moaned and begged as he continued to fuck him open.</p><p><em> "I could take my time with you," </em> the Dark Lord supposed, rolling his hips in just such a way as to get his boy's hands on his shoulders, his insides tightening just right around the intrusion. <em> "Oh... I could have you for hours, Harry, what do you think?" </em></p><p><em> "I..." </em> Nails dug into his shoulderblades, clinging, and he was almost all the way in now, very nearly. <em> "I can't... ah! Can't wait so lo-ong --" </em></p><p><em> "Mm." </em> He leaned closer, pressing his mouth up against Harry's ear, and confessed, <em> "Neither can I." </em></p><p>Then he was there, in to the hilt, his boy squirming and pulsating around him like he'd been made for it, and for just a moment, the Dark Lord went silent, merely breathed deeply through the sensation, the utter completion he'd been waiting for. <em> "Oh darling," </em> Voldemort breathed, and <em> that </em> had Harry moving just right, gasping, <em> "oh my darling boy --" </em></p><p><em> "V --" </em> Harry convulsed, breath hitching in a sob. Sweet Salazar, he was so perfect. The Dark Lord shivered, closing his eyes against the intensity of his pleasure.</p><p><em> "You can say it, Harry," </em> he moaned, pressing a kiss to the juncture of his head and neck, just under his ear. <em> "Do you like it? Do you feel me inside you, Harry?" </em></p><p>He hadn't touched his boy's erection at all since bringing him off the first time; and Harry was even harder now, he could see, sticky lines of precome dripping off the end of his shiny pink cockhead and onto the puddle formed in the hollow of his navel, glistening invitingly.</p><p><em> "I like it," </em> Harry cried, <em> "I love it, please, I --" </em></p><p><em> "What do you need, darling?" </em> the Dark Lord asked against his skin, dragging himself halfway out to rub against Harry's prostate a little more. The broken sob it earned him was so wonderful.</p><p><em> "F-fuck me, take me," </em> came the plea. <em> "V-Voldemort, please --" </em></p><p>Pleasure coiled deep in his gut, heat pooling like lava underneath his skin. <em> "Oh, yes," </em> he gasped. <em> "Yes, my Harry, I </em> <b> <em>will</em> </b> <em> --" </em></p><p>There was nothing that could have stopped him, then. The Dark Lord paid no mind to composure any longer as he pulled out nearly all the way and thrust in hard and deep, faster, harder, chasing the edge of that cliff. It was him and his boy, him and Harry, yes, <em> "Harry," </em> he growled, <em> "Harry --" </em></p><p><em> "Yes," </em> his boy was shouting, <em> "Please -- more -- more -- </em> <b> <em>my lord</em> </b> <em> --" </em></p><p>Oh, that did it. Voldemort hissed something without words, hips stuttering, and dug his teeth into Harry's shoulder. His boy <em> screamed </em>, clenching around him so tight, flooding the space between them with white, and the Dark Lord followed him, spilling deep inside Harry with a gasp.</p><p>He was sure that, if he had not been on top, he would likely have blacked out for a moment. The moment of his release seemed to stretch out endlessly before him, until he remembered how to breathe. Now, with the snapping of that taut rope between them, Voldemort found himself utterly exhausted, and pulled out of Harry with a satisfied sigh before lying down on the bed beside him.
