    <p>Walking down the path to Hogsmeade through light snowfall, hand in hand with his boyfriend of almost two years, was so perfect that Scorpius just had to laugh. It was either that or burst into tears.</p><p>“I still say it’s magic.” He glanced at Albus.</p><p>"The snow? It wasn't me this time!" Albus said.</p><p>Scorpius giggled. “And here I thought that you’d found a way to multiply the power of your spells by... infinity...”</p><p>"I'd probably have mentioned that. Once or twice. Or, you know, all the time." Albus grinned.</p><p>“Probably.” Scorpius squeezed his hand. “But I mean it. I think a spell was put on the castle back when it was built or... maybe on the whole region... So that there’d always be snow for Christmas. I mean... it hasn’t missed a single year in ages, has it?”</p><p>"I don't think so..." Albus said. "We could ask your dad if it always snowed in his time, too. And if it did, maybe you actually discovered something that's missing in <em>Hogwarts: a History</em>!"</p><p>“A lot of stuff is missing, according to your aunt. I mean… the Minister.” Scorpius shrugged. “I’m really looking forward to seeing Dad. And Laura.”</p><p>"Me too," Albus agreed. "I can't wait to see what kind of surprise your dad has for you."</p><p>"I hope it's a book," Scorpius said, speeding up a little. "Come on, we're running late."</p><p align="left"> </p><p>…</p><p align="left"> </p><p>They ended up waiting in The Three Broomsticks for almost half an hour before Draco and Laura entered, beaming and with snow in their hair.</p><p>“Sorry, boys,” Draco said as they sat down across from them. “I was showing Laura the shops and...”</p><p>"It was awesome!" Laura exclaimed. "Though Zonko's was nothing compared to your uncle's place, Albus."</p><p>Albus grinned. "Told you."</p><p>“Did you go to Scrivenshaft’s?” Scorpius gave his father a meaningful look.</p><p>“Oh yes,” Draco said, quickly taking a long, slightly wrinkled brown paper package out of one of the colourful shopping bags. “They just got it in yesterday.”</p><p>“Dad!” Scorpius rolled his eyes and quickly grabbed it, trying to hide it under his cloak.</p><p>Albus leaned in closer. "What was that?"</p><p>“School stuff,” Scorpius said, almost knocking his butterbeer into Albus’ lap.</p><p>"Right..."</p><p>Scorpius was saved as Laura asked: "So how are you boys doing? Is it true that you're staying at school during the holidays to <em>study</em>?" She wrinkled her nose.</p><p>“Yeah,” Scorpius said, squirming a little. “I have a test in three weeks. I... I missed one of my OWLs this summer.”</p><p>"One of your owls? I thought you only had Zarina," she said.</p><p>“O.W.L,” Draco clarified, smiling. “Those exams I told you about. Scorpius was very well prepared, but he always gets a bit... nervous...”</p><p>"He managed to Vanish himself when he was practising for his Transfiguration exam," Albus said, rolling his eyes. "After my turn, the examiners came up to me and asked where he was. I couldn’t imagine Scorpius not showing up for an exam, so I got very worried. We went looking for him all over the castle, but he was nowhere to be found. Lily and I were freaking out and Professor McGonagall was getting ready to send an owl to Draco when Scorpius suddenly materialised right on top of two first years in his favourite sofa in the common room.”</p><p>Scorpius blushed and sank down in his chair as the others laughed. “It was an accident,” he muttered. Rose had been convinced he did it on purpose to get more time to prepare, but he really didn’t. In fact, he still wasn’t sure exactly how he’d done it.</p><p>“Anyway,” Draco said, smiling, “McGonagall let him attend the class based on his performance during the year and he’ll do the test now, along with two students who were too ill with Dragon Pox, and the Hufflepuff Keeper who was having her collarbone regrown.”</p><p>"The Hufflepuff what?" Laura asked, frowning.</p><p>"It's a position in Quidditch," Albus explained helpfully. "The wizarding sport everyone is so obsessed with. Even though the players get hurt all the time."</p><p>"Not all the time," Draco interjected. "I played Seeker for a couple of years and I never got injured."</p><p>Scorpius began relaxing again as he watched his boyfriend and father in a good-humoured argument about the dangers and benefits of Quidditch, with Laura looking on with obvious bemusement.</p><p>"I guess your father was better at getting hurt than I was," Draco teased. "But never mind that. I promised you a surprise, Scorpius. Well... both of you, actually." He reached into his pocket and got out a little rectangular black box. He put it on the table.</p><p>“What is it, dad?” Scorpius asked, reaching for the box. “Can I open it now or…?”</p><p>“Not here,” Draco said quickly. “But you don’t have to wait until Christmas morning either. Just… Do it somewhere private, okay?”</p><p>Albus frowned. “Is it…” He lowered his voice to a whisper. “Is it something illegal?”</p><p>Draco shook his head. “No. Just… A bit unusual. Some might not find it appropriate. But considering what you two have handled in the past…” He shrugged.</p><p>Scorpius hesitated, then picked up the box and examined it warily. “Uhm… thanks…” he said.</p><p>Laura laughed. “Don’t look so scared. You and Albus will know what to do.”</p><p>“I hope it will make your Christmas more enjoyable. Give you something to take your minds off studying for a bit.”</p><p>To Scorpius’ relief, Albus looked as apprehensive as he felt. He took his hand and squeezed it under the table.</p>
