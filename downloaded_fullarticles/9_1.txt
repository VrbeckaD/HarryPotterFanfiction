</center><p> </p><p>"Happy birthday, Lucius," Hermione said with a smile. </p><p>The dining room table was glittering with a massive array of candlesticks, the lit candle of his cake barely visible amid the ornate table setting.</p><p>Lucius Malfoy, his long blond locks shimmering with each flicker of warm light, blew out the flame and leaned back in his chair while the house-elves busied themselves with serving the dessert. He was seated at the head of his table. There was a regalness to him — a decadence in the way he lounged with his arms sprawled out over the edge of the chair, and gaze idly roamed over the decorated space. Decorated for him.</p><p>"You remembered." </p><p>His eyes trailed over her — over her sweet smile, soft chin, and down her bare throat that revealed the plunging neckline of her emerald silk dress. He had always told her that silk was made for her, accentuating her sloping curves and emphasizing her luminous ivory skin. Of course, on this night more than others, she dressed to please. </p>
<p></p><div>
  <p>"Yes, I remembered," she said teasingly, leaning her head toward his hand as he twirled a finger through her cascading curls, tied neatly in pigtails. "You only sent yourself a three-tier cake and had the house elves remind me of it on five different occasions." </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Can you blame me?" Lucius said, his lips curling into a slight smirk as she rolled her eyes. He reached for her hand, his skin warm against hers. "It is a big one after all." </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"It is not! You’re turning forty-eight!" She laughed as Lucius gave her a playful glare. "Anyway, I have a gift for you." </p>
</div><div>
  <p>His eyes lit up as she slipped a square box toward him. It was wrapped in silver paper and tied with a black velvet bow. On the corner of the box was a hand-drawn heart with a large L in the centre. Lucius took his sweet time unwrapping his present, his eyes lingering longer on her clavicle and neckline than it did on the gift. Hermione's warm smile remained, entirely used to his ogling. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>He lifted the first item from the box — a delicate, transparent black bra with an elegant dark green lace trim. The bra appeared impossibly small and fragile in his large hands, and he could see Hermione's patient stare through the fabric as he lowered it and moved onto the rest of the gift — matching knickers and an underbust corset. The bones of the corset were visible under the thin fabric, and his brow lifted with an air of intrigue as he envisioned it on her, squeezing and accentuating Hermione's exquisite curves. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Do you like it?" Hermione asked. Though her face remained still, her voice betrayed her concern. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"I'd have to see it on you to know for sure," Lucius said, pushing the box back toward her. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Hermione’s lips tensed at his words which were clearly not as approving as she'd like. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Change into it now, if you would, and meet me in my study. I have a gift of my own… for myself." </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="center">

</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Hermione felt like a bit of a fool navigating the empty hallways of Malfoy Manor as she followed his orders. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>She was all but naked in the utterly see-through bra and knickers, the latter of which seemed to hug her cheeks and show off most of her bare bottom. The corset dug into her waist and squeezed at her ribs, but she had to admit the cleavage that the underbust created was so ample and feminine it mesmerized even her as she scrutinized herself in the mirror.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Her leg hitched up and she walked a bit wonky on her way to his study. This was not intended to be worn for walking. Or anything, really, except for Lucius Malfoy to tear off with his teeth before promptly devouring her. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Hermione pushed the heavy door of his study, the heat of the room blanketing her as she took several steps in. The study was larger than most libraries and housed several hundred books on magical history, the dark arts, and a handful of texts of Hermione’s choosing. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>The back of the large black leather couch, which sat in the middle of the room facing away from the entrance, flickered with the light of the roaring fire. It occluded her ability to see the desk, where Hermione would find Lucius writing letters and reading books. On nights when Lucius was prone to melancholy, he would have her sit at his feet under the desk and pleasure him until his spirits were lifted.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Oh, you should see it —"</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Hermione froze, her heart stopping with the rest of her. She had not expected to hear voices. As far as she could tell, there was no one in the fireplace he could be Floo’ing.  </p>
</div><div>
  <p>She took a step backwards, angling her body toward the door.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"It's alright," she heard his voice call out. "Come here, girl." </p>
</div><div>
  <p>She paused, her eyes anxiously lingering on the back of the leather furniture. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"I said come here, Hermione. Now."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Her hands moved to cover herself as she took slow and wary steps toward him. His desk, and then his face, came into view as she approached. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Come to me, my darling," he said, pushing his chair back and patting his lap in invitation. She glanced around for the source of the sound and nearly jumped out of her skin — lingerie and all — when she discovered that the room was occupied by another. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Lucius —" she breathed as she took a step back.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Her eyes remained glued to the couch and on the dark eyes of Lucius' guest: Severus Snape. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Snape, with his ice-white skin and stringy black hair, sat calmly with his hands folded primly in his lap as if he’d been invited over for afternoon tea. Had she not heard Lucius speaking to him, he could have been a statue. Nothing moved, nothing that was, except his eyes which wandered openly down her near-naked form. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>It was like a bucket of ice water had been poured over her head and she was made to stand in place and endure it. She hadn't seen her old Potions professor since graduating Hogwarts many years ago.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Tsk," she heard Lucius say from behind the desk. "You know better than to call me 'Lucius' when we're in private. And I won't tell you again, girl, come here or I'll drag you here by your hair."  </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Hermione could feel the cold skin of her fingertips against the flesh of her breasts, all blood draining from her extremities as her body broke into an embarrassed panic. Still, she took the necessary steps to reach Lucius' desk. He took it from there, grabbing her by the waist and pulling her into his lap where his previously cold gaze melted into a look of warm appreciation. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"My sweet," he whispered into her fringe as he pressed a kiss to her forehead. Balancing her small form on his thigh, Lucius reached for her wrists and drew them away, unshielding her body from his view. His — and Snape's. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"I told you I have a gift for myself."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Snape? You... want to be with Snape?" </p>
</div><div>
  <p>She felt his lips curve, twisting into a smirk as he pressed another kiss to the top of her heated cheek.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Something like that," he murmured before he pressed two fingers under her chin. He lifted her face to his and pressed a delicate kiss to her lips, tasting the frightened embarrassment on her skin. "But I don't do anything without my girl." </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"But — "</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"You said it yourself, just last week, that you wanted to try being with two men, did you not?" </p>
</div><div>
  <p>She had. She fully and intensely regretted it now, but during a silly game of Veritaserum or Dare, Hermione had admitted her fantasies, many of which she was hardly conscious of as they spilt freely out her mouth and into the world for Lucius to gobble up.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Yes, but —" </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"And you yourself admitted to having a, what was it, <i>crush</i> on your dear Potions Master during your sixth year? Don't you want to earn that O you so desperately craved?" </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Lucius, please!" </p>
</div><div>
  <p>She buried her face into his chest as she hid from the world and all its humiliating facts. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Hermione winced as she felt Lucius' hand snake into her hair and squeeze, forcefully urging her head back. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Lucius, is it?" he said, his voice a threatening growl as he stared down at her.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"I'm sorry," she murmured back, "<em>Daddy</em>." </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"That's better."  </p>
</div><div>
  <p>He released her, his nails mindlessly opting to scratch at her scalp that still stung from his grip mere seconds ago. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Anyway, I would not do anything without your consent, and you may use your word as always — though it would be a pity to send our dear friend home without properly fulfilling that fantasy of yours..." </p>
</div><div>
  <p>As he spoke, he ran the back of his hand down her throat, over the rounded slopes of her cleavage, and gently rubbed into the sheer fabric of her bra. He watched as her nipple — which was delightfully taut already — tightened and hardened even more at his touch. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Look at me." </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Her gaze lifted to his face, his eyes keen as they watched her facial reactions — the subtle wince in her features when his thumb and index plucked and pinched at her nipple. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"What do you want, my darling?" </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"I... <em>oh</em>," she moaned as his fingers trailed down her body and his fist pressed between her legs. "Yes, yes, please." </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Please what?" </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"I want it..." </p>
</div><div>
  <p>His hand lifted from between her legs and gripped her jaw instead, holding her in place and forcing her to glance up at him.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"What do you want, Hermione? Be specific now, dear, we don't have all day." </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"I want you — you and S-Snape..."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"To what?" </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"To f-fuck me, Daddy, please." </p>
</div><div>
  <p>As the words escaped her lips, his mouth claimed hers with a hungry kiss and a sense of relief that transferred between them. Lucius pulled away and she felt a forceful thrust as he pushed her off of him.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Present yourself, little girl, so our guest may see what we are working with."  </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Hermione's face flushed crimson at his words.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"What do you think, Severus?" Lucius asked, trailing behind as he manoeuvred her. He lifted her wrists and pressed her palms against the top of her head to give Severus a clear view of her torso and squeezed her already constricted breasts up even higher. With a quick thrust, Lucius forced his knee between her legs, encouraging them apart. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"She's come together nicely, Lucius," Severus' voice caused a long shiver to drag down her back. She'd carefully averted her gaze, taking note of the elegant marble floor beneath Snape's feet. "I would not have thought she looked like that under her school uniform..." </p>
</div><div>
  <p>She didn't know why, but the prospect of looking Severus Snape in the eyes as he inspected her like cattle made her want to crumble to pieces. She was burning with humiliation as Lucius himself peered down at her, inspecting her form. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>He'd seen her naked. He knew what she looked like. They fucked like rabbits, rampantly and obsessively. Yet now, even with the look of blatant appreciation, she wanted to curl into herself and hide. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Oh, you foolish girl. You haven't removed your hair!" </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"But — but you said you prefer it trimmed." </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Her voice came out mild and meek, as small as she felt under her Daddy's disapproval.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Yes, but we have a guest, girl," Lucius sighed, turning to glance over his shoulder. "What do <em>you</em> think, Severus?" </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Remove it," Snape's sharp voice snapped as he leaned back into the leather, crossing one leg casually over the other. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Lucius grabbed her by the hair and guided her to the centre of the room. With a graceful tug, he drew her backwards until the backs of her knees touched the hard cold chest. It sat a foot or two away from Severus’ and served as a coffee table and discreet storage unit for a few of their many toys. He slowly pulled her back, the sensation causing a painful tug at Hermione’s scalp as she scrambled to catch herself. She fell back with a thud, her bottom hitting the hardwood as - with a gentle push against her shoulders, she was made to lay down - her body on full display to both men. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>The sound of her whimper passed her lips, an instinctive plea of mercy as Lucius’ fingers hooked into the tops of her knickers and he pulled them down. Hermione fought so hard to squeeze her legs together, her hands automatically drifting down to cover her now bare cunt - bare, except for the thin layer of trimmed hair. </p>
</div><div>
  <p><em>Trimmed perfectly for Lucius’ liking</em>, Hermione thought bitterly.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Severus," Lucius' voice snapped from between her legs as his hands pried her knees apart.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>In an instant, she felt the cold grip of Snape’s hands curling around her wrists. Darkness flooded her vision as the Potions Master loomed over her, his black eyes glaring down at her like she had crafted the worst brew he had seen and displeased him yet again. Despite having graduated from Hogwarts years prior, the look still reduced her into a quivering mess that ached for his approval. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Lucius deftly placed a binding charm on her knees, disabling them from moving as they remained pressed against the corners of the chest.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Daddy, no, please,” she whimpered as she felt his fingers draw up between her thighs. She tried to squeeze her legs together but it was a futile effort as the enchantment held her forcibly in place. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“What is it, girl? You don’t want Severus to know how wet you are, already? Would you like him to take a look at you — in this state?”</p>
</div><div>
  <p>She bit her lower lip to keep the moan from escaping her lips as Lucius slowly parted her lips. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Hermione sucked in a breath when the enchantment hit her, causing a sharp sting to radiate from the tip of his wand onto her sensitive skin. Though the pain was not inherently pleasant, it was the vulnerability of it that made Hermione squirm. Her hips curled as her mind struggled to understand whether she wanted to lean into Lucius’ hands or away, as with each second she was forced to endure this she felt her clit throbbing with hunger. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Her breathing grew deeper as Lucius’ wand slowly made its way down from the top of her pelvis, over the fleshy skin, and moved its way down her sensitive lips. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>She tried to free her wrists from Snape’s strong grip. The harder she tugged, the tighter he squeezed as he lifted her wrists over her head and pinned them to the sides of her face. She could smell him with each deep breath she took — the sweet symphony of burnt organic materials, fresh herbs, and smoke. His hair brushed against her lips, soft as feathers as he stood mere inches from her face. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>She couldn’t look him in the eye in this state, yet she had no qualms turning her head toward his constricting touch as her lips brushed against his wrist. He let his thumb run over her lips, parting them as they sought the warmth of her mouth. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>She sucked another gasp as Lucius pinched her outer folds, tugging as he carefully and meticulously removed any remaining strands. Her back arched when his fingers slipped between her folds, gliding over her clit as he pinched her skin once more. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>It was impossible to prevent the soft whimper that passed her lips and coated Severus’ thumb as the tip of his finger explored the inside of Hermione’s lip. He pinched and tugged on it, in synchrony with Lucius’ plucking of her pink petals. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Just enchant her,” Lucius called from between her legs. Had he not been pinching at her skin and casting a warming hair-removal charm onto her privates, Hermione may have forgotten he was there at all as Severus’ finger slipped out of her mouth. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Come, tell me if this is adequate for you.” </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“No!” Hermione squeaked to herself as the men ignored whatever protest she made. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Severus swiftly cast a similar charm on her wrists as had been placed on her knees, preventing her from fleeing. It held her in place, shackled against the chest as the two men huddled around her thighs, carefully inspecting her to their liking.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Hermione wanted to die from the mortification. She could see Snape bent over to take a closer look at the treat that Lucius was offering him. </p>
</div><div>
  <p><em>So much for ‘never look a gift horse in the mouth'…,</em> Hermione thought.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Oh God, Daddy — please!” she cried out as Lucius’s fingers drifted south, reaching between her cheeks and forcing them apart. Her body slammed hard against the chest as she struggled against her binds.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Now, now, little girl — we have to make sure it’s all to his liking,” Lucius said as he parted the cheeks of her bottom further.</p>
  <p>Hermione wanted to fade into the chest — dissipate into the air from the humiliation that shone through her bright and red. She was trembling when the men decided that her body was pruned to their liking. Her eyes were shut tight to the point that the corners of her eyes ached from muscles tensing and squeezing. She sought to escape the world and its embarrassments. That was, until, her thighs tightened and released against the sweetest sensation.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>It was a kiss. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>A warm, wet kiss placed deliberately between her parted legs. Open-mouthed and full of suction.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Oh, oh my... ” Hermione breathed.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>The second kiss was even wetter as his tongue lapped against her throbbing, utterly exposed clit and trailed over her bare lips. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Her gaze drifted down and she could see her hardened nipples bouncing as her body shuddered from his hungry licks. Between the two slopes of her breasts, between her parted legs, was the blond head of Lucius Malfoy. He was barely visible, save for his eyes which occasionally peered up to take note of her more-than-pleased reactions as his pink lips pressed against her own.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Her eyes nearly rolled to the back of her head, a delirious wave of pleasure settling through her. She let her head fall to the side and another hard shiver cascaded through her when she saw Severus sitting mere inches from her. His eyes were its own kind of ravenous as they watched his friend feast on her body. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Hermione let out a cry of protest when Lucius’ lips lifted — the sound of her disapproval quickly overshadowed by another of her sounds: a deep-throated moan, when she felt the unfamiliar feeling. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>It was cold, like fresh satin that sat outside on a winter’s day, as it hit her hypersensitive skin. Lucius’ lips were pursed together as he attentively let out a cool stream of air through his lips, coating her wet cunt with a shiver-inducing sensation. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Look at how <em>drenched</em> you are,” he whispered as he slipped a finger between her glistening, parted lips. They trailed down and disappeared into her entrance. “I knew you were a dirty little slut, but I had no idea you’re a whore for attention too.” </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“I could have told you that,” Snape said, his eyes trailing from where Lucius’ slick fingers pumped in and out of her, up to her face which blossomed with yet another bothersome blush. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Hermione glanced at her old Potions Professor as each thrust of Lucius' fingers filled her with desire and stripped her inhibitions away stroke by stroke. Snape’s shoulders were moving. Though the dark fabric of his clothing somewhat masked his movements, the gentle sway of his hair gave it away. Her half-opened eyes trailed down to the source of the movement and what she saw made her cunt squeeze around Lucius’ fingers.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Snape was grinding his palm against the hardened bulge of his trousers, soothing his raging cock as he watched her half-naked form be filled by Lucius’ fingers — kissed by Lucius’ mouth. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Hermione released a deep moan. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>It was absurd how turned-on she was by it all. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Really?” Lucius said, “Tell me more about how naughty our girl was.”</p>
</div>
  </div>
