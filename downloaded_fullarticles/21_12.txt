    <p>“And now… Team Two. Uchiha Itachi. Akui Ryuji. Togami Haruhi.” </p><p>Itachi categorizes everyone in his life. </p><p>It is hurtful to say, but only two people are currently in a circle he labels as “safe,” and they are Sasuke and Shisui while his parents and a small scattering of clan members stay in his “trustworthy” circle. These are the people that he will show his back to, but only to Sasuke and Shisui will he show his most vulnerable state. </p><p>He loves his mother and father dearly, but they never really understand him, always holding him on a pedestal so high that he wouldn’t be able to communicate with the people who put him there. </p><p>It’s always about the clan. </p><p>When he went to the Academy, he thought that he could escape from the spotlight he had, but it has only become worse. Kids continued to whisper about his family as he walked by in the hallways and the teachers would see his family and his genius before they saw him. Uchiha Itachi, who likes to play with his little brother and who likes sweets from the shop down the street. </p><p>A handful of students are “acquaintances,” all consisting of other clan kids who still treat him as if he is a walking uchiwa, but saw him as a rival. </p><p>Then there are the people who were in “the background.” It is more malicious for him to say, but these are the kids and the people along the street that he couldn’t be bothered with. They are not a threat to him, nor are they people he would expose his neck to, but they are people of the village, and he will protect them all the same. </p><p>These lists are mean and cruel, but Itachi can’t help it. His paranoia forces him to create lists that he can fall back on when he walks beside classmates. </p><p>But there are two people who did not fit into any category. </p><p>Akui Ryuji and Togami Haruhi. </p><p>Akui Ryuji is the adopted son of the Daimyo’s advisor, always going to class in fancy silks and leather that he painstakingly changes out of when they have class spars. There are rumors that he is a Yamanaka orphan, a bastard child that was lucky enough to be picked up by a wealthy couple that wanted to do nothing more but spoil a child that they couldn’t have. His platinum blond hair and his pale blue eyes give it away, always peering around him with a look of disgust, taking in the dusty, mucky desks and the leaking roof above his head. </p><p>Togami Haruhi could not be any more different. An orphan with unruly red hair and the greenest eyes that Itachi had ever seen. When he had first seen her hair when they met years ago, he was tempted to reach out and yank it in an unfamiliar burst of childish curiosity. He had never seen locks of fire before. She sparred with him on occasion during class, always getting beat to the ground by his outside training, but she never looked at him with cold eyes. She always asks the same thing after every fight they have. </p><p><em> “Are you alright?” </em> </p><p>As if he was the hurt one. </p><p>Itachi turns his head to his new teammates, watching as they bicker underneath their breaths as the students around them buzz in excitement, forehead protectors gleaming in the artificial lights above. They talk at rapid speed, arguing so quickly that their words seem like the hums of bees. </p><p>Itachi is never able to wrap his head around the two, always at each other’s throats, never agreeing on anything, yet they stuck to each other’s side the entire time. Itachi has seen them in Konoha before, or across the courtyard at school. They’re always together, and he wonders how two people who couldn’t stand each other’s presence could rely on one another so much. </p><p>The girl pauses to tuck a strand of wild, red hair behind her ear and stops. The two of them suddenly sense eyes on them and they stop their bickering to stare right at him, meeting pale blue and green with black. They’re just as unrelenting as Itachi. </p><p>They do not hide their steady gaze even as they continue to whisper to each other, and a small pang of hurt pricks Itachi’s heart. He is the first to break the stare, and looks down at the hem of his shirt, gripping the fabric in his hands. He felt happiness at that moment, the two of them are the same age as he is, and they’ve never looked at him as if he was a rival, or an Uchiha. He isn’t sure that they even look at him at all. They’re too busy looking at each other. </p><p>He hopes — their bonds with each other are already too strong — there’s no hope for him to enter their circle. </p><p>But as his new teammates, he guesses that he has to open up his “trust-worthy” circle to complete strangers.</p><hr/><p>Their sensei is a man by the name of Minazuki Yuuki, one of the first Jounins that pass through the door to cheerfully pick them up. </p><p>Itachi learns that the man is happy-go-lucky, likes training and going on casual dates with women while he doesn’t like natto and pickled plum. </p><p>But there is a tenseness that he catches while the man looks at all of them. </p><p>“I’m Togami Haruhi,” the only girl says easily. “My hobbies include running and spending time at the owlery.” A strange combination. <em> A desire to get away from situations?  </em>Itachi thought, analyzing the information. “I have a lot of things I like, unlike a certain someone.” An elbow makes its way into her stomach, but instead of wincing she easily dodges it and a smile appears on her lips. “My dislikes are xenophobia, bullies, and annoying snakes.” She dodges another jab. </p><p>“My name is Akui Ryuji. Why you — “ She wriggles out from underneath his hand. “I <em> hate </em> annoying people, especially irritating <em> lions</em>,” Akui speaks immediately after Haruhi, attempting to hold her down with one arm while she giggles. Haruhi easily breaks out of his hold and grabs him into a noogie. </p><p><em>An inside joke?</em>  Itachi thought silently, growing even tinier against these two forces. Inside jokes indicate closeness and familiarity. He doesn't think that he even has one with Shisui. All of their conversations are weighed down by the seriousness of the clan. </p><p>His small introduction of <em> Uchiha Itachi. My hobbies are training and visiting traditional teahouses. My most favorite thing is my little brother, Sasuke, and my goal is peace</em>, is easily overshadowed and unheard.</p><hr/><p>Minazuki lets them go with the warning that they have a test next week, and Itachi hasn’t seen his two teammates since. He’s in a teashop with his younger brother beside him, a plate of dango placed in front of him. Sasuke’s swinging his legs on the bench, easily telling Itachi about everything that happens to him throughout the day. It is then when he hears two familiar bickering voices. They’re together again. </p><p>Their voices rise like water on a stove, igniting the streets with liveliness and energy. Itachi turns and catches sight of Haruhi and Akui. The sunlight catches her hair and it makes it look like her head is surrounded by living fire while Akui’s eyes grow even paler in comparison to all of the light that surrounds them. Haruhi has a scroll tucked underneath her armpit as they talk loudly enough that Itachi is able to hear from his spot. Akui’s eyes meet his from across the street and he raises his eyebrow. The girl in front of him stops and turns around, filling their vision with each other. Instead of shying away and ignoring him like what he expects, embracing her alone time with Akui and Akui alone, Haruhi grabs the protesting blond’s hand and drags him to the teahouse. Itachi watches as the boy drags his feet but does not fight back. </p><p>“Hello, Itachi-san,” Haruhi says with a smile as she stops in front of them, ducking underneath the fabric flaps that hang over the restaurant. Sasuke grows quiet by his side. “May we sit here?” </p><p>They’re not excluding him, rings in his head loud and clear. </p><p>“Of course.” Akui takes a seat beside her and waves over a waitress in the corner of his eye. He orders two teas, meaning that he knew Haruhi’s order instinctively. Itachi blinks wide black eyes at her. “And Itachi is fine. We are the same age.” </p><p>Haruhi’s smile grows and she sits down, placing the scrolls on the table. “We’ve been meaning to find you. Ryu and I were going to go to the Uchiha Compound after this to find you, but —  we dug up all of the information on Minazuki-sensei.” After a pause, she follows with, “For the exam.”  </p><p>Itachi’s eyes grow wide at that. He has asked his father about his new teacher, but his dad only scoffed, telling him that Itachi would have been better suited with an Uchiha teacher, and his sensei was a fool. </p><p>Itachi decides to keep this information to himself. </p><p>Akui unravels the scroll in front of him that has their teacher’s face on it. </p><p>“Are you alright with Sasuke staying here?” Itachi asks before things go too far. His little brother looks at his teammates with wide eyes, hints of awe and jealousy mixed in with onyx hues. He doesn’t want Sasuke to be sent away, but he can see the wary glance Akui sends at his brother. He can also understand the discomfort their presence can command. Haruhi moves and suddenly the blond winces. <em> Did she just kick him underneath the table? </em> </p><p> “Hmmm.” Haru holds a finger to her chin almost animatedly, eyes shut before she turns them to Sasuke with a smile. “I’m not sure! Sasuke-kun, can you be trusted with <em> serious </em> ninja business? This is all valuable information, we would only let the best of the best know this!” </p><p>Itachi knows that Akui catches his surprised expression, noticing the way his lower lip gently drops in surprise as he stares at the girl in front of him as if she had grown another head. Everyone ignores Sasuke, an action Itachi doesn’t quite know is a negative or positive yet, but Haruhi fully addresses him, smiling at Sasuke, treating Sasuke as if he was another child off the street. </p><p>Her kindness towards his little brother is something that Itachi never ends up forgetting. </p><p>“Of course I can! I can do anything!” Sasuke exclaims at her, looking almost indignant that this<em> big kid </em> considers even for a second that he wasn’t. But his confidence lasts for a second before he grows wary and tries to hide behind his big brother, trying to shrink underneath his large collar. </p><p>Haruhi smiles gently, eyes growing soft before she states, “I guess Sasuke-kun has proven himself worthy then.” </p><p>Akui snorts underneath his breath before he leans over to the table and gets to work. </p><p>“Our sensei just barely made Jounin in the last year and what he said was true. He hangs around the bars a lot and attempts to talk to a lot of women — most of it unsuccessful. From what we gathered, this is half because his mother is pressuring him to get married soon, and because he just likes women, but he’s also pathetically single.” </p><p>The blond shakes his head and points to the scroll. “He’s twenty-six. One-hundred and seventy-seven centimeters tall, blood type O; he’s allergic to yuzu. His teammates are still alive but they do not talk anymore, and… he’s known for being petty. He is extremely jealous of shinobi who have better talents than he does and is known for failing students who have shown better potential or skill than him.” He knits his eyebrows at this, turning those blond arches into a deep V over his eyes. </p><p>This information makes Itachi raise his own eyebrow. </p><p>Their team formation is built upon the three strongest students in his class, with Haruhi being Head Girl and Akui and Itachi frequently switching places for Top Boy. Itachi made it at the top of the ranks at their graduation, just barely beating the boy in front of him by a hair's breadth. Akui has always been better at theory and concept than he is, but Itachi is better at practicals. </p><p>Haruhi sees the worry on Itachi’s face. </p><p>“But you’re the head of the Uchiha clan and Ryu is Akui-san’s son. The council will be doing a lot of protesting if Minazuki-sensei fails us.” She is quick to comfort him. </p><p>“But…” Itachi’s eyebrows knit further, his head fogging up with this new information. “What about you?” Clan-less, parent-less, in debt, Haru is at a considerably worse position than they are. </p><p>Haruhi looks at him as if she has seen him for the first time. Her grin is genuine. </p><p>“I will sponsor her,” breaks in Ryuji before Haruhi can say anything. “Team formations can not be broken, even if one student does not show as much potential as the other. In Konohagure’s case, it really is ‘sink or swim together.’ But in any case, if Minazuki-sensei attempts anything, I will tell my father about this.” </p><p>Haruhi looks like she’s about to laugh. Another inside joke. Akui’s eye twitches in irritation. </p><p>“Oh…” Itachi looks at her. “In any case…you have my support too, Haruhi-san. I am not sure if I can convince my father, but I will try my hardest.” </p><p>“Thank you, Itachi, and just Haru, please.” </p><p>“...Haru-san.” </p><p>She seems exasperated but amused and Itachi might see why Akui sticks around her. She talks to you as if she can only see you; when her full attention is on him, it is as if Akui is not sitting beside her. The discussion goes to how they will execute their exam next, with Sasuke breaking in every now and then when Haru invites him into the conversation. </p><p>When they finalize formations that they have taught in the Academy, Haru reaches over and plucks Akui’s empty teacup before he can stop her. </p><p>She glances down at it and turns to him. </p><p>“Looks like you’re going to be burdened in life,” Haru says off-handedly, tilting the cup to show him the mass of brown at the bottom of the ceramic. </p><p>Ryuji hits her in the back of the head and she laughs it off, shaking her curls before placing his teacup down. </p><p>“Tea-leaf reading?” Itachi whispers, almost to himself. Haru does not seem like the superstitious sort. </p><p>“Sorry, it’s a... class that we used to take together — “ Haru tries to explain, waving her hand. Maybe they took a tea ceremony class together, he thinks. It would explain their familiarity with one another, even if it was not ideal. Ryuji is aristocratic in every sense, from his clothes to his speech to his mannerism, but there is a sort of elegance in the orphan in front of him too. A tea ceremony class is not off the table. </p><p>“It’s a load of rubbish and I don’t know why you still try.” </p><p>“Does it...work?” Itachi tilts his head. Some of his aunts did palm reading as a thing to giggle at during clan parties, but they never took it seriously.</p><p>Haru admits with a sheepish smile, “It’s a pretty dumb subject if you ask me, but looking back on it… It’s pretty amusing just to see what comes up. My first reading said that I was going to die a painful death.” Black eyes widen. “But I’m still alive, aren’t I?” </p><p>“Not if you keep running off without thinking,” Akui mutters underneath his breath, but clear enough for the three of them to hear it. </p><p>“Do you want me to read your leaves?” Haru says. “Just for fun. Though I can’t guarantee that they’ll be accurate.” </p><p>Itachi has never been invited into something like this before, even if it is as strange and obscure as fortune-telling. Maybe he'll be fated to die a painful death too. </p><p>Now that they're teammates, maybe they'll die together.</p><p>“Sure…” He pushes his cup into her hands. </p><p>“Hm…” She looks down at his cup and Akui peers over her shoulder. Akui has dismissed the subject, yet he looks at the cup as if he is analyzing— he recognizes the art as well. Itachi fiddles with his hands underneath the table. Sasuke creeps closer to her as she seconds tick by. She looks up at him. “It says here that you're going to fall in love easily, Itachi-kun.” </p><p>“Nii-san won’t do anything as reckless as that!” Sasuke interjects, breaking the tension in the air. </p><p>“Yea? What if Itachi-kun falls madly in love tomorrow? What are you going to do, Sasuke-kun?” she teases. </p><p>“I’ll fight them!” </p><p>He highly doubts that and she knows, and instead their conversation moves to weekend plans. </p><p>Itachi doesn’t show it, but he feels strangely light about this, his heart lifting like a bird in flight. She asks him about his thoughts frequently and Ryuji jumps in to put in his two-cents whenever he feels as if his opinion is needed. For the first time, even if it is abnormal, Itachi feels like any other boy out with his friends.</p><hr/><p>They end up passing the exam with flying colors, and their red-faced sensei can’t do anything to object when they all had strategically brought the fight out of the training ground and into the middle of the marketplace where anyone could witness their skill versus his word. </p><p>Haru suggests that they go get dessert to celebrate and turns to Itachi to ask what he would like to eat. </p><p>His answer is quick with no hesitation. <em> Dango</em>. His teammates do not protest and they go off together.</p><hr/><p>The next few weeks of Itachi’s life are occupied by D-ranks that he takes to silently. Haru is unsurprisingly the best at them, gardening, cooking, babysitting, and cleaning as if she had been doing them for years. Itachi considers her past, and he undoubtedly recognizes his privilege. Maybe she <em> has </em> been a gardener, cleaner, a babysitter. Their teammate, on the other hand — </p><p>“Have you ever held a broom before, Akui?” she prods. </p><p>“You damn Toukou!” He swings his broom and she meets it with her own broom handle, clashing as if they were sword fighting. “You know that I’m not used to this stuff!” </p><p>Itachi pauses from his own sweeping. Akui is in a whole different world than they are, one of nobles and easy luxury, and so his mannerisms are often things that Itachi can not explain. Slandering Haru by calling her a potter was possibly one of the strangest on the list. It could be a slang term that he is not familiar with, or pottery is a hobby she did not mention. </p><p>“Itachi-kun looks like he’s doing alright, and he's the clan heir.” </p><p>Akui looks like he wants to say more, wringing his hands as if he wants to strangle the girl in front of him before he huffs and turns on his heel. He stomps off to their sensei, maybe to ask for permission to murder the girl, but they both know he is using the space between them to defuse. </p><p>“Please do not pit me against Akui-san, Haru-san. I do not want to antagonize him,” Itachi says simply, blinking at Haru. These past few D-ranks have allowed him to be closer to the girl, and he hates to admit that he yearns for her presence. He enjoys going on missions and to team training if he knows that she will be there. His isolation from his peers has made him desperate, but Haru breaks down those walls well, as if she understands him — as if she knew the remedy for loneliness. But his relationship with Akui still remained at a plateau at the origin point. They talk through Haru as the messenger, and he has yet to be closer to the boy.</p><p>Itachi silently wonders if Akui is jealous of him — if he hates the boy for stealing Haru’s attention. Itachi did not go into a team quietly; he had done his research. Akui’s only friend throughout the Academy was Haru. The two boys have struggled for the title of Top Boy for a while, toppling their scores back and forth like a scale, Itachi just wants to wait. He wants Akui to just say that he hates Itachi, that he hates other geniuses, that he hates D-ranks and he hates shinobi. Yet his life choices say the opposite. He is a shinobi despite grimacing at the thought of the job description, and he is friends with Haru despite their antithesis and his envy. He desires to be seen. </p><p>“He knows my intentions behind what I say,” Haru says this with confidence, arms crossed. “And I think it’s good for him to know his weaknesses. He’s rich but knowing some basic manual labor can’t hurt him.” </p><p> The boy beside her stays silent. He holds in his opinion. </p><p>“What’s on your mind?” Haru asks not even a beat later. </p><p>“Huh?” Itachi lowers the broom in his hand as he looks at her as if he was a deer in the headlights, like he was caught doing a crime. Itachi was not an easy person to read, his own father often slipped through the cracks of his exterior. </p><p>“You’re thinking hard about something,” the girl replies easily. “I can tell because you get this certain look.” She answers his questions without his voice. “It’s the, you know — downturned eyes, small frown.” </p><p>Haru doesn’t say that she has seen that expression on her own face too many times. </p><p>“How are you…” he starts. He shakes his head as if to get water out of his ears before looking at her again. “Why are you and Akui-san friends?” </p><p>Maybe he can get to the bottom of this, he can find the formula. </p><p>“Hm?” Out of all the questions, this was one Haru did not expect. She tilts her head at him, an invisible question mark floating above her head. Her head turns slowly like a puppet on a string, staring out at the door Akui had left open. </p><p>She waits and ponders her second for a while. Hands tighten around the handle of the broom. Itachi does not want a thought out response, he wants an honest answer. </p><p>“We met in a tailor shop. We were both getting our robes fitted and he struck up a conversation,” she eventually says. </p><p>She looks at Itachi and sees that he is not satisfied. </p><p>“We’ve been through a lot together,” she tries to elaborate. To Itachi’s surprise, she’s not joking— her words are the truth. She speaks softly and clearly, genuine. “We haven’t always been on the same page or the same side — “ Same side of what? “But we have experiences together that can not be replicated anywhere else. Honestly, we still have a lot of differences that make us enemies at most points, but we still stick together.”</p><p>Her answers have only given him more questions. </p><p>“I…” His mouth opens and closes. “I don’t quite understand.” She is painting him to be a bad person, and yet she sticks around him. Akui is also at his kindest when he is around Haru. He pays for her desserts with his never-ending wallet and they often do reconnaissance together after training. </p><p>“You’re worried about where you stand with him, right?” She steals the words from out of his brain again. Maybe she was the secret Yamanaka, always reading his mind, going into his head. Yet she still evades his big question. “You shouldn’t worry so much about him, he doesn’t deserve that type of attention. He’s a difficult person to get along with. He has a lot of complicated and conflicting emotions and beliefs, and I don’t agree with a lot of them, but…” This is a moment that Itachi can not begin to understand. “He’s trying to learn from his upbringing and it’s not much, but...” </p><p>Haru is not speaking to him at this point, her eyes growing distant. She talks as if she was trying to convince herself. </p><p>“We’re both working toward becoming better friends. We’re really trying our hardest to be good to each other — “ She looks at him and Itachi mentally wonders if he had really <em> seen </em> her before. She has always been the beacon in their classroom, her hair making her pop out among a sea of blondes and brunettes in the Academy, but now the Uchiha can’t help but commit her large, doe-like eyes to memory and the curve of her jaw and the cheeks full of baby fat. “That includes you too, Itachi-kun.” </p><p>Itachi does not know what to take away from this. His question is unsolved. Yet her response makes him run through one thought in his head in laps. </p><p>
  <em> She’s including him too.  </em>
</p><p>Later on, she excuses herself when Minazuki-sensei tells her to work on cleaning the female bathroom and Itachi goes out into the courtyard where Akui angrily sweeps leaves as if he is pummeling a face. </p><p>The Uchiha walks up to him slowly and the blond in front of him tenses, a coiled wire. Instead of advising him or holding up airs, Itachi simply lays the dustpan in front of them and squats down to hold it properly. </p><p>“I’ll hold the dustpan if you sweep,” was all he said. </p><p>Akui exhales like the dragon he is, but does not say another word. They clean up in silence.</p><hr/><p>Their first real mission is a quest to hunt down a ninja cat, a ninneko with special whiskers that are an ingredient in a medicine only made in Sora-ku. </p><p>Itachi is familiar with the castle of Nekobaa and Tamaki and the abandoned city that surrounds it. The Uchiha clan has used it for generations to store weapons and other inventions they have, but Itachi watches the reactions of his teammates as he walks behind them. Akui keeps his eyes trained on the floor, attempting to dodge the cats that try to brush up against him as if they carried the plague, disgust marring his face. Haru easily accepts any cat into her arms and watches their surroundings with awe, pointing out things to Ryu if they had caught her attention or if they reminded her of something. Itachi wants to speak up to them, mention that the restaurant they’re standing next to has good sashimi, or that the cat currently in Haru’s arms is a nefarious hog for affection. Immediately after meeting up with Nekobaa, they’re given cat headbands that let them speak the cat language and a picture of their target. </p><p>Haru easily puts hers on while Akui stares at it like it’s going to rob him at knifepoint. </p><p><em> Cute</em>. </p><p>Minazuki loudly announces that they are going to split up in two groups, breaking Itachi’s stare. He opens his mouth slowly, his heel lifted and his fingers forward in his teammates' direction, but his intentions drop as soon as it comes. </p><p>“Ryuuji-kun and Haru-chan will go together while I’m with Itachi,” their teacher states, and before he could get out another word, they’re off. </p><p>Deep within the nekonin’s warehouse, large crates and bags tower over them, creating fortresses wherever he looks. Minazuki-sensei feels as if this is a good place to recuperate and he sends Itachi to look for his teammates. </p><p>It didn’t take long — Itachi follows the sound of arguing that he can recognize from a mile away, but they’re so far that even Ryuji, their sensor, doesn’t recognize that he’s there. </p><p>Itachi doesn’t know what comes over him that causes him to lie in wait, listening to their conversation. </p><p>Haru whips a senbon from out of her sleeves and lays it flat on her palm like she is going to serve it on a platter. The two of them stare at it intensely and Itachi attempts to narrow his eyes to get a better look at what they’re doing. He squats behind several crates and holds his breath so he becomes completely silent. </p><p>“Point me: the target,” she states easily, almost as if to command the needle in her hand. The needle begins to spin wildly like a compass, and Itachi’s eyes flash wide open from his place, hitching the gasp that almost escaped from her lips. Akui is not surprised by this, and familiarity even sparks through his eyes as they watch the needle. The needle finally stops, settling down and Haru points in the distance. </p><p>“The cat’s there.” </p><p>Itachi’s eyebrows furrow so much that they’re nearly touching. When Itachi was paired with Haru on tracking exercises, she had never shown him this ability before. She stays by his side as they hunch over different scents, hairs, furs, or anything else their teacher had left behind to uncover their target. </p><p>A Bloodline limit? Multiple clans have been lost in the war, and if Haru came from a tradition of trackers, no one would have looked twice. If she always had the ability to track in this way, how come she had never used this in front of him? </p><p>Itachi follows them quietly, and he’s not surprised when they’re led directly to their target, drinking away at catnip alcohol and laying sprawled, completely wasted. </p><p>Akui can only take one more step further before he grimaces and clamps a hand over his nose. </p><p>“That cat reeks!” He complains, looking at Haru as if he couldn’t believe she would actually go in to capture him. </p><p>“If you don’t want to go I can just do it.” </p><p>“And leave you and Uchiha to take all the credit?” His voice leaks with disdain. Akui’s voice comes out comically nasally from the finger pinched on the bridge on his nose. “As if, Togami.” </p><p>“Well, we’d be taking all the credit because we’re doing all the work…” her voice trails off. Before the boy in front of her opens his mouth to protest again, she drops her voice low, her expression serious. “Seriously — <em> Draco </em>.” Itachi furrows his eyebrows at the unfamiliar sound, a word he has never heard before. “If you don’t want to do anything, I can take care of it. Honestly.” She sounds the most earnest Itachi has ever heard. </p><p>The blond’s face reddens with incredulousness. Haru sighs as if expecting this. </p><p>“Ryu, wait — “</p><p>“I’ll show you! <em> Accio! </em>Cat!” </p><p>Itachi can’t hide his gasp this time when their target is suddenly moving as if lifted by an invisible hand and is thrown through the air. </p><p>“Ryuji-kun, stop!” Their sensei shouts from his own hiding spot underneath the crates that they’re standing on. </p><p>Yowls suddenly fill the air as the cat screams before slamming into Ryuji’s awaiting arms. The tabby cat barrels into Akui’s chest then immediately drops when claws sink deep into the blond’s face. The cat dashes past Itachi and he doesn’t hesitate to go on the chase. Akui sinks to his knees with his hands pressing on his face as cries of pain ring from the boy’s lips. </p><p>Itachi hears a, “Sorry, but you deserve it,” in the background before Haru hones in on the cat and catches up to him. His neck cranes forward as he catches the sight of his teammate on the crates above his and she looks down to shoot him a smile. Before long, Haru breaks away from him, speeding up and catching up to the space between her and the ninneko. </p><p>A breath leaves Itachi’s mouth. Haru has always been the fastest kid in the Academy; nearly neck and neck with him but always a hair's breadth ahead. </p><p><em> We need to do something about his mobility… </em> he thinks, lungs growing heavier with every breath <em> but first… Those whiskers enhance his spatial perception</em>. Kunai slide into his fingers and he waits for the moment right when the cat leaps and launches a handful into the air. Paws and fur slip easily through sharpened metal, but Itachi planned for this. He takes his own leap into the air and prepares to launch two more kunai until the cat’s back paw knocks against a falling kunai. The Uchiha falters in the middle of the air, eyes growing in size as the sailing metal drives nearer. His arms grow heavy against his body. </p><p>“Shit!” Haru calls out from above him on a metal pillar. His head lifts up to the sound of her voice. Her kunai clashes into the stray one that was about to hit him. </p><p>Itachi drops into a roll into the ground, gasping when he rises then releasing a yelp when he sees his blond teammate fall through the air. </p><p>Ryuji’s body slams against the cat again, but this time his arms are wound tightly against the struggling ninneko. Red light seemingly encompasses Ryuji’s hold, lulling the cat into a peaceful sleep. A hand reaches up to rub Itachi’s eye, blinking away any dust that could’ve made him hallucinate the red light. That was no jutsu, and he wishes in that second that he had activated his Sharingan, focusing so hard on the soaring boy that he strains his eyes. </p><p>“Ryu!” </p><p>Then he drops like an anvil, screaming when he sees the upcoming pit he’s falling into. His grip on the cat grows tighter and he clenches his eyes shut, awaiting the eventual impact and bracing himself for a few broken bones. </p><p>A string weaves itself around his leg and <em> yanks</em>. Ryuji slams into the side of a large wooden box, a large <em> oof </em> leaving his mouth when all of the air in his lungs get knocked out. Itachi’s shoulders slump when he confirms the safety of his teammate and he sighs lightly. </p><p>“Thankfully I made it in time,” he mutters to himself as he pulls on the string to bring Akui up. </p><p>When he raises the blond boy to eye-level his expression is anything but happy.</p><hr/><p>The sun sets by the time they walk back from Sora-ku, taking advantage of the empty road and the gentle silence that is carried with it. Their sensei is several kilometers behind them, taking care of loose threads of their mission report and lingering behind the den of the cats. </p><p>Itachi purposefully lingers behind his two teammates as he’s always done. This time, however, they weren’t speaking. Their voices would normally fill the space they occupy, whether it be from arguments, casual conversations, or Haru checking up on his family. She states that he had gotten his negative attitude from his father, and Itachi wonders why she keeps such a gentle concern for them if that were the case. </p><p>Haru elbows Akui in the stomach forty minutes into their trek back to Konoha. </p><p>“Ow!” his bandaged arm wraps around his middle. “What the — You better have a good reason for that!” </p><p>“Don’t you have something to say to Itachi-kun?” she interrupts. </p><p>His mouth closes in an instant. Itachi holds his hands up in surrender. </p><p>“You don’t need to do anything, Akui-san — “ </p><p>“No, no. Itachi-kun.” Haru holds out her hand to silence him but she stares deeply at their pouting, bandaged, teammate. “He has something to say.” </p><p>It looks as if Akui wants to stomp his feet in frustration at that moment, but he forces himself to exhale and close his eyes. He turns to Itachi and gives him a short, shallow bow. </p><p>“Thank you.” He catches the look Haru gives him from behind Itachi’s shoulder. “Tch. Don’t think you’re so much better than me, Uchiha! When you’re down and beaten, it’s going to me who will save <em> you</em>.” His finger pokes Itachi in the chest, but his eyes are so wide in that moment they can see their own reflection in his black irises. </p><p>“Can’t you say thank you normally?” Haru grouses by his side when they start moving again. “Itachi did something nice for you! Would it kill you to not treat your friends like crap?” </p><p>“He’s not my friend!” </p><p>“I was just trying to do my mission!” Itachi tries to explain, but Haru starts glaring at him too. </p><p>“Don’t make me punch you too, Itachi-kun,” she states, holding up her fist threateningly, but the corner of her lips lift up in the briefest hint of a smile. Akui huffs beside her, but he decides now to open his mouth. Against himself, Itachi falls into a laugh. </p><p><em> Friends, huh? </em> </p><p>“Woah…” Her fist gently falls. “It’s just — I’ve never seen you with that kind of smile before!” The expression she gives him almost makes him want to blush. He’s glad that it’s sundown, his skin is already tinted with a soft orange. </p><p>“Be more observant, Togami.” Akui starts to walk ahead of them. “You obviously have never seen his face when he eats dango.” </p><p>“I — “ He tries to defend himself. </p><p>Haru falls into a small fit of giggles and runs as she agrees with Akui. They bicker and talk a bit more, inviting Itachi into the conversation and letting him speak whenever he feels like it. Eventually, silence falls upon them again, but Itachi notices now that they’re walking so close to each other that their shoulders nearly brush.</p><hr/><p>He wonders what kind of history they have to get them to this point. </p><p>They’re not best friends, he summarizes, but they know everything about each other. Itachi doesn’t have enough fingers to count the number of times they’ve slipped into that strange language of theirs, easily caught the other’s slip up during battle, or when they stared at each other with such familiarity, the Uchiha wonders if they’re old gods, experiencing several millennia together before dying and being reborn as his teammates. </p><p>They’re something strange. They have similar quirks and mannerisms, the same extreme sweet tooth that Itachi shares with his dango and their tarts. Yet on other days it seems as if they’re on such different sides of the coin that he spends all day splitting up their arguments. </p><p>Their sensei won’t do anything about it. Their once happy-go-lucky sensei slowly burns into something more sinister, looking at their growing progress with a side-eye. </p><p>Itachi wonders if they’re the same person, born, died, then reincarnated as two people.  </p><p>He looks at them setting up for their spar, meters away from where he sat on the plush grass as their sensei stood tall, observing. </p><p>It was the same thing again. </p><p>“Scared, Togami?” </p><p>“...You wish.” A large smile snakes its way into her lips. They both hold their kunai up to their faces before bringing it back down.  </p><p>“Begin!” </p><p> Their strange traditions used to bother him, always the outsider. To the clan. To the village. To his team. </p><p>“Itachi, you’re up next.” He pushes himself up off his feet, giving a nod to Akui as he stalks past him and up to the empty training field where Haru waits for him. </p><p>He slips into the beginning stance. </p><p>“Ready, Itachi-kun?” she smiles. He nods. </p><p>“Begin!” </p><p>He ends up winning just by a hair’s breadth and they form the seal of reconciliation. </p><p>Akui walks up to them with his hand on his hip after their sensei walks off after the training is done, probably to vent to his friends, probably to find more women to bother with his desperate advances. </p><p>“Dango?” Akui says, not even as a question anymore. They both nod and walk off in the direction of the teahouse. </p><p>He hopes — No, he knows that the good thing is that he can start new traditions with them.</p><hr/><p>“Haru-san?” </p><p>She looks up from her paper bags, a bouquet clasped firmly in one hand and several food bags in the other. She brightens when she sees him and he feels his own smile slip onto his face at her enthusiasm. </p><p>“Itachi-kun! It’s nice to see you!” </p><p>He tilts his head. “We saw each other yesterday,” he says, voice confused. And the day before that, and the day before that. They spend nearly every waking day with one another, jumping from training to missions to mission report debriefing. He knows that he sees his team more than he sees his own family at this point, a fact that has gotten Sasuke grumpy like a kitten every time he comes home late. </p><p>She huffs with a tired, but amused expression on her face. “I can still mean it, Itachi-kun.” </p><p>His heart grows warm when those words leave her mouth. </p><p>“Is Akui-san not with you?” he says instead. They’re usually attached by the hip.</p><p>“No.” She shakes her head hard enough to fan out her curls. “He’s visiting his parents today. In the capital city.” It almost slips from his mind that the Daimyo was a part of Akui’s life. He has gotten so used to seeing the Akui in front of him. Grouchy, germaphobic, but not what he initially expected. He looks down at the flowers in her hands, bright and strategically arranged. They’re Yamanaka standard.  </p><p><em> I remember you</em>, it reads as he recalls the flower language. </p><p>It’s the day of the end of the Third Shinobi War. </p><p>“Are you…” he starts out. “Are you going to pay your respects?” </p><p>A look of knowing falls on her face, her smile growing wistful. She turns and a strand of her hair falls over the side of her face like a curtain. </p><p>“Yes, do you want to join me?” </p><p align="center">. . .</p><p>“Forgive me for asking…” he begins as she places the lit incense in the holder. The steam wafts up like water in a river, winding, twisting, then disappearing. The smell gently reaches his nose. She tucks a strand of hair behind her ear and turns to look at him. “Are your parents buried here?” </p><p>She reaches into her bag and produces several oranges, standing up straight. </p><p>“I don’t remember my parents.” A lie, he recognizes. “And besides, they’re not buried in Konoha. I would know.” They’re surrounded by rows and rows of graves and tombstones, young and old, rich and poor. A good chunk of them are still new, barely several years old and both of them know exactly where it came from.  </p><p>“Are you...praying for everyone?” </p><p>She begins placing oranges and other offerings at the base of the altar but doesn’t answer him. Instead, she pulls out several desserts and finishes it off with her bouquet. </p><p>Haru didn’t strike him as the spiritual kind, but he can understand her generosity. She pulls out a folded leaf last, but Itachi can smell what it is from here. </p><p>“Dango?” she asks, holding it up to him. </p><p>“I — “ He looks the other way to sway his temptation. “You should offer it up to the spirits.” </p><p>She laughs at that. “It’s alright, most of it is courtesy. They’re not going to be eating it until after it grows old, and dango just doesn’t deserve to be treated like that.” Haru talks as if she knows exactly what the spirits do, where they go, every step they take. She gives him a smirk. “And even if it weren’t — I’m sure the spirits can handle not having a plate or two of dango.” </p><p>He glances at the leaf in her hands at the corner of his eye, lips thinned out and resolve wavering. </p><p>“No…it would be impolite of me,” he finally says, even though the look in his eyes said anything but that. His voice was strained, as if it physically hurt him. </p><p>“If you say so…” Haru sighs dramatically, shoulders sinking. “I guess I’ll eat this dango all by myself…” she trailed off, glancing at her teammate at the side of her vision. Itachi does not move from his spot, but his face changes to one of ultimate betrayal, like she has told him she is going to become a missing-nin right this second. To edge him on further, she slowly unwraps the leaf, dragging on the seconds as soft crinkles fill the air. She takes one out of the packaging, raising it by its bamboo skewer as slow as a flower petal falling off the tree. </p><p>“Stop.” His hand is placed on top of her as she raises the dumpling up to her mouth. Instead of faltering, she falls into a fit of giggles at the indignant expression on his face. “I’ll do it.” </p><p>“Let’s go somewhere else to eat,” she says, finally. </p><p align="center">. . . </p><p>On the outskirts of the cemetery is a park, then a forest, and beyond that is a large cliff overlooking the woods that decorated the skirts of Konoha, going as far as the eye could see. Haru settles here easily, draping her legs over the edge as if there weren’t a thousand meters meeting her blow. The Uchiha sits beside her, close enough for their hands to brush when they both reach for another stick of dango. Comfortable silence fills the air with the wind whistling in their ears like a gentle siren’s song, not even strong enough to stir up the leaves from the trees. </p><p>Itachi’s train of thought goes from the multitude of offerings Haru has bought for this day, going from the cemetery to the people buried underneath their feet. He remembers the day Konoha held the funeral, his father’s arm wrapped protectively over his shoulders and the stirs of the clan over Hatake Kakashi’s eye. He thinks of the Iwa-nin he tried to save on the battlefield, the same one that tried to kill him when he recognized who he was — what village he hailed from. </p><p>He looks at the girl beside him, casually chewing on the bamboo skewer as she stares endlessly at the tops of trees. An orphan, undoubtedly a product of war.  </p><p>“Haru-san...can I ask you something strange?” Itachi hears his own voice without willing it. </p><p>“Sure thing,” she said easily, bouncing the skewer between her index finger and thumb. “Go ahead.” </p><p>“What is...the meaning of life?” </p><p>The skewer nearly falls out of her hand. Her eyebrow raises far above her bangs as her lower lip drops in confusion. </p><p>“Huh?” </p><p>A soft exhale falls from his lips before he twists his head down to stare down at his lap. He notices how small his legs look from here. His knees are tiny and he’s barely eight. Itachi is<em> minuscule </em> compared to the forest, the world, the universe. </p><p>It would be so easy. </p><p>“I don’t know,” Haru says truthfully beside him, voice soft but her words ring like they are everlasting. He expects that. Haru is more intelligent than most people give her credit for, always inquisitive and he can’t ignore that air of otherworldliness that exudes from her person. He doesn’t know what she knows. </p><p>The boy next to her (so physically close, yet worlds away) gazes down at the side of the cliff. </p><p>“When I was five...I tried to commit suicide,” he suddenly admits.  </p><p>“Itachi — !” she gasps out, voice cutting off like she lost air. The curls of her hair whip around her face when she snaps her head towards him. </p><p>“I met with one of the Sannin, Orochimaru, and he said...there was no meaning in life." Dark eyebrows furrow tightly. "I thought...if there was no meaning in life…” White knuckles wrap tightly around his own skewer, tightening the skin around his hands until she can almost <em> hear </em>it. “It made me wonder why I should try. But halfway down the cliff, I thought...I didn’t want to die anymore…” Redness starts peaking out at her waterline. Sweat drips down the nape of his neck at the worried look she’s giving him, guilt bubbling in his stomach at the thought of making her upset. His voice is small, carried away in the breeze that rustles the wind. “Ah...but don’t worry. I don’t think like that anymore. The birth of my younger brother has made me really happy recently. He really has saved me.” </p><p>“Itachi...I’m…” He’s too ashamed to look at her at this point. Black bangs hang down his face, curtaining his eyes from her view. He doesn’t know what came over him. He had never told anyone this before, not his own parents, not Sasuke, not Shisui. </p><p>She sighs. “Itachi, I’m so happy.” </p><p>Faraway, a flock of birds take flight out of trees and take soar towards the sun. </p><p>Now it was his turn to be confused. “Huh?” His head lifts up from their fetal position and he turns to look at her. Silent tears are streaming down her face at this point, but her smile is genuine. It is sad, with tears falling into the lines on her face, but her intentions weren’t hidden. </p><p>“I’m happy,” she finally says, “I’m happy that you’re here, and healthy, and you’re still in front of me. Nothing has made my day more than knowing that you’re still here.” </p><p>He turns to look at her in the eye, pupils blown wide by the genuine<em> love </em> that easily came from her words, that she easily gave him. </p><p><em> Something blooms in his chest</em>. </p><p>“Can I hug you?” she asks next. </p><p><em> A side of him says there’s no purpose, but then he thinks…in a rare moment of selfishness...even if </em> [花に嵐] The moon is often hidden by a cloud. Flowers are often scattered by the wind<em>, the bloom in his chest is incomparable to any other feeling. It’s worth it.  </em></p><p>He doesn’t recognize his own voice when he comes to stutter out, “Y-Yes.” </p><p>She nearly gets a jumping start, crashing into him so hard he almost tips over. Skinny arms wrap around his neck tightly and he doesn’t know how he comes to wrap his own arms around her waist. They’ve been close before, nearly skin to skin during spars, but this was unfamiliar to him. He feels his cheeks redden. She presses her face in the crook of his neck and the tracks where her tears were sink into the fabric of his shirt. </p><p>“Can I tell you a secret, Itachi-kun?” Her whisper is so close he feels the warmth on his cheek and the base of his neck. </p><p>“I — Yes.” His arms tighten. </p><p>“What Death wants more than anything else in the world is for you to come to him, willingly or unwillingly. He’ll pull every trick in the book to make it happen.” A shudder runs down his spine. “If that is Death...then life must be your ability to go on for as long as you possibly can...doing whatever it is that makes you happy.” </p><p>
  <em> The meaning of life...doesn’t have to exist. </em>
</p><p>“Haru-kun…” He pauses to gulp silently. “Do you ever have…” He doesn’t need to continue. Instead, she releases the hold she has on him and leans back on her knees. </p><p><em> Rushing in to save Akui recklessly, shielding Minazuki-sensei without a thought. Choosing high up spots. Do you do this on purpose? </em> </p><p>His own death years ago almost meant nothing to him, but the thought of Haru at the end of the ravine, bones cracked unnaturally, eyes blank, made him nearly want to clench his chest with fear — with a sickness. </p><p>“I admit that I had a moment where I told myself...<em> I am ready to die </em> .” A gasp slips from his lips. “But it never got to a point where I felt that I wanted to die.” She looks up at him and he feels himself slipping into a world of emerald green. “That’s why...I’m truly sad that you had a time in your life where you felt like you had to resort to Death. Itachi-kun...please know that I am your friend...so if there ever is a moment where you feel helpless in any way...I will <em> always </em> be here for you.” </p><p>
  <em> He holds on to his emotions gently.  </em>
</p><p>
  <em> (Physically close, and now a little bit closer.)  </em>
