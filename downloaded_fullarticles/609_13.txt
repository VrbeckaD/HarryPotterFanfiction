    <p align="justify">In a moment of utter terror, the world slows down. Narrows.</p><p align="justify">Around Harry, curses are thrown and people are screaming, the cold winds ever present around Azkaban ripping on his clothes.</p><p align="justify">And yet, he only sees Zabini, hurled in the air by the curse Harry had casted, the curse that had been meant for the man next to Zabini, who is now laughing at Harry.</p><p align="justify">A Cushioning Charm passes Harry, preventing Zabini from breaking his neck as his body hits the ground, limp and lifeless. Draco dashes after his own charm, toward Zabini, his blond hair a patch of light in between all the gray.</p><p align="justify">Harry, knees trembling, makes a decision.</p><p align="justify">„Retreat! Everyone, retreat!“ He sends some red sparks flying, before looking at Draco. The Slytherin has an arm slung around Zabini's body. Their eyes lock for a moment, Harry nods and with a pop, Draco disapparates.</p><p align="justify">Before Harry follows, he throws another look around – just in time to watch Sam and Terry spin into darkness, Sam's hair like a raven's wing in the storm.</p><p align="justify">Only one missing.</p><p align="justify">„Ron!“</p><p align="justify">Ron Weasley is dueling two wizwards at once, his wand whipping through the air, firey hair wet with sweat.</p><p align="justify">Harry sprints toward him and catches one of the wizards by surprise, stunning him. The other sends a dirty look Harry's way, before grabbing his companion's arm and vanishing.</p><p align="justify">„Let's go,“ Harry shouts into Ron's ear and before the fuming ginger can protest, Harry is pulling them into the airfree darkness of apparation.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">St. Mungo's is already wide awake when Harry and Ron arrive, both panting, adrenalin still pumping through their bodies.</p><p align="justify">Harry catches a glimpse of Sam and Terry only a few metres away, talking to healers. Terry seems a little wobbly, but both are standing on their own feet.</p><p align="justify">„Where's Zabini?“ Harry asks the healer approaching them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">„They won't let me in,“ Draco says, pale face now almost translucent, his expressive eyes wide. He's waiting in front of a closed door, the door to Zabini's room.</p><p align="justify">„Did they say anything? Will he be alright?“</p><p align="justify">Harry's heart is pounding in his chest painfully and he's just staring at Draco, infinitly grateful that he's alive and well.</p><p align="justify">„Yes. He will be okay.“</p><p align="justify">Harry exhales. „Thank Merlin.“</p><p align="justify">He wishes he could go over, wrap his arms around Draco and bury his head in that silver hair. But Draco doesn't want the public to know about their relationship, so he can't do that. In moments like this one, it breaks Harry's heart.</p><p align="justify">„What about the others?“ the Slytherin asks.</p><p align="justify">„They should be okay.“</p><p align="justify">Ron rubs his face. It's smeared with dirt and sweat. A rather ugly cut adorns his left cheek.</p><p align="justify">„A bloody mass-breakout.“</p><p align="justify">Harry just nods and Draco's face shutters, his eyes dark.</p><p align="justify">„This is a disaster,“ he says and Harry can just silently nod.</p><p align="justify">When they've all been floo-called out of their beds in the pit of night, none of them had been prepared. Harry, who had slept at Ron's, since Hermoine had been on a business trip Draco apparently wasn't invited to, had insisted to come along and, really, Harry is glad he did. None of them had had any idea what they'd walked into.</p><p align="justify">The first time the idea had been introduced to slowly replace the dementors guarding Azkaban for schooled wizards, Harry had been all for it, even supporting it publicly.</p><p align="justify">But, apparently, they just weren't there yet. They'd done it too quickly, too carelessly. Because now, more than a dozen criminals are on free foot again and it's partly their fault.</p><p align="justify">A healer exits the room.</p><p align="justify">„He is stable. I'm optimistic that he'll be able to leave during the day, but for now, he's sleeping. You can visit him, if you like, just be quiet,“ he tells them.</p><p align="justify">Draco is the first one in the room, Harry close on his heels.</p><p align="justify">His throat constricts as he sees Zabini in the white hospital bed. This is Harry's fault. It was his curse that sent Zabini here.</p><p align="justify">„Don't blame yourself,“ Draco says quietly.</p><p align="justify">Harry can't look at him. Shame is washing over him.</p><p align="justify">„How can I not? It was my curse.“</p><p align="justify">Lightly, Draco brushes the back of his hand against Harry's. Now the Gryffindor does look at him, even though guilt is still burning in his stomach.</p><p align="justify">„You didn't mean to hit him. No one blames you.“</p><p align="justify">„Is everyone okay?“</p><p align="justify">Sam comes in, carefully, voice low so she won't disturb Zabini's sleep.</p><p align="justify">The Slytherin looks a little dishevelled, her long hair tousled and her face bare of makeup.</p><p align="justify">„Yes. What about Terry?“ Harry asks her.</p><p align="justify">„He's alright. Just some lingering stunner that slipped through his Protego. The healers are giving him some pepper-up, I think.“</p><p align="justify">Harry nods. At least they all made it out alive.</p><p align="justify">The sharp clicking of heels on the floor announces the arrival of Pansy Parkinson. It amazes Harry that she, at four in the morning on a Tuesday, looks ready for a photo shoot. Why in hell is she wearing makeup?</p><p align="justify">„I've heard,“ she says, everyone looking at her in mild surprise. „I come in early on Tuesdays to work in the lab. Some plants I need are only blooming in the early morning hours. How's Blaise?“</p><p align="justify">All of that is fired in such rapid speed that Harry has trouble keeping up.</p><p align="justify">„He'll be alright,“ Draco says, gently. He's probably sensing an unease in Parkinson that Harry can't see.</p><p align="justify">Pansy nods, looking at Blaise and taking a deep breath. Draco puts a tentative hand on her back and Pansy leans into it, smoothing one hand over Draco's hair, then pressing her forehead against his shoulder for a moment.</p><p align="justify">Pansy straightens her back again and lets go of Draco, looking at Sam now.</p><p align="justify">„Please tell me you made those wankers pay.“</p><p align="justify">Sam shakes her head, expression dark.</p><p align="justify">„Not really, I'm afraid. After Blaise was hit, it was over. Terry was hardly able to stand and I had to get him out of there and... we let them escape.“</p><p align="justify">„Fuck,“ Pansy says, the curse coming from the heart and Harry can only silently agree. What a huge fuck-up.</p><p align="justify">He looks at Draco, who avoids his gaze.</p><p align="justify">Pansy is looking at him now as well, taking his hand again. Harry tries not to be jealous that she can.</p><p align="justify">„Draco, love,“ she says, her voice full of sympathy.</p><p align="justify">Draco gives her a sharp look, but Harry can see right through him.</p><p align="justify">If one of them is allowed to feel bad about this outbreak, it's Draco.</p><p align="justify">Harry's curse that hit Zabini had been meant for someone else, someone who, of course, managed to dodge it, laughing as he was spinning into the darkness with another wizard.</p><p align="justify">Someone named Derek Connor.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Pansy tries not to let her worry show too much. Nothing unsettles Draco more than when Pansy is worried about him. It makes him defensive, she knows. But the look on his face is worrying. Derek sodding Connor is running free again and Pansy has a bad feeling that he won't just take his freedom, pack his things and move to Australia to get away from them.</p><p align="justify">Afterall, Derek had always meant trouble and if there is one thing he doesn't seem capable of, it is letting go of Draco.</p><p align="justify">Potter is clenching and unclenching his fists, looking at Draco and obviously dying to go hug him, comfort him. But Draco won't let him.</p><p align="justify">It exasperates Pansy, but she's been through worse with Draco. Way worse.</p><p align="justify">„I should go home,“ the Weasel says, looking at his phone. „Hermoine heard and she wants to floo me.“</p><p align="justify">Pansy hates to admit it, but the Weasel actually grew up quite nicely. He's still tall, but not as lanky anymore. A slight slouch to his shoulders has remained, but he carries himself with confidence and his biceps really are worth a glance or two.</p><p align="justify">„I'll see you at the Ministry,“ Potter says and the two guys hug.</p><p align="justify">Weasel nods at the rest of them, then leaves the room with long steps.</p><p align="justify">Pansy crosses her arms and looks at Sam. She seems quite a bit shaken by the events and Pansy can't blame her. Out of an impulse, she puts her hand on the girl's forearm and squeezes lightly.</p><p align="justify">Sam looks at her with a faint smile.</p><p align="justify">Pansy isn't sure if they could already be called friends, after only knowing each other for a month, but sometimes, it's scary how alike they are. It almost feels like Pansy can read the other girl's thoughts at times.</p><p align="justify">„I have to get back to the Ministry,“ Pansy says.</p><p align="justify">Draco gives her a small nod.</p><p align="justify">„Take care,“ she tells him and he smiles at her, fondly. Sometimes, it's easy for Pansy to recall why she used to crush on him a little in Hogwarts, even though she always suspected that she doesn't have quite the right equipment to woo the blond.</p><p align="justify">Still, she loves Draco as much as she loves Blaise, even when she was dating him. If Pansy is really honest, the blond git might even be her secret favorite. It scares her at times that she is quite sure she'd die for Draco if she had to. It's not very Slytherin of her and she knows that, especially as a woman and as a Slytherin after the war, self-preservation is key. Which is why Draco is, and will remain, the only exception to the rule.</p><p align="justify">„I'll see you soon,“ Sam tells her and they smile at each other. They always do. Pansy kisses her cheek and leaves the room, wondering how the hell she is supposed to be concentrating on brewing sleeping draught now.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">„Are you okay?“ Harry asks when he can't take it anymore.</p><p align="justify">Draco hasn't said a word since they left the hospital together and Harry is worried. He can only imagine what must be going on in Draco's head right now.</p><p align="justify">„Yes.“</p><p align="justify">„Come to mine,“ Harry says, impulsively. „Drink something. Calm down a little.“</p><p align="justify">To his delight, Draco complies. They've been dating for a month now, yet Harry feels like Draco wants to keep him at arm's length.</p><p align="justify">In the quiet kitchen of Grimmauld, the rush of the tab is loud as Harry turns it on, feeling Draco's presence even though the blond doesn't make any noise. Harry hands Draco a glass of water.</p><p align="justify">„We'll catch him soon. He won't get away,“ Harry says, putting as much conviction as he can muster in his voice.</p><p align="justify">Draco nods, not looking at Harry. His hair threatens to fall into his face again.</p><p align="justify">„Hey,“ Harry says, his heart breaking a little. It always does around Draco. Harry didn't know that being in love means you're more or less constantly hurting. It's weird, really, how readily he accepts it.</p><p align="justify">„Come here.“</p><p align="justify">Draco looks at him, eyes silver in the light. Harry opens his arms and Draco sets his glass down, letting himself be pulled against Harry's chest. His arms snake around Harry's body as he rests his head against the brunet's chest.</p><p align="justify">Harry hums and breathes in Draco's scent. He isn't quite ready yet to admit that it smells like home.</p><p align="justify">„You don't have to be afraid,“ he whispers and that draws a chuckle from Draco.</p><p align="justify">„You know that I am.“</p><p align="justify">„But I'll protect you.“ Harry is tracing circles on Draco's back.</p><p align="justify">„I'm a better wizard than Derek is,“ Draco says, quietly. „You don't need to protect me.“</p><p align="justify">„I know. And still, I will. Always.“</p><p align="justify">Draco sighs shakily and presses a little closer.</p><p align="justify">Harry drops a kiss into his hair, letting his lips linger, his hands running down Draco's back. He loves the curve of it and how perfectly Draco fits in his arms.</p><p align="justify">Draco draws back just a little and lifts his head, tilting his chin up. His eyes are shining and his lips slightly parted. Harry has come to know this expression as Draco's <em>I-want-to-be-kissed</em> face and it's hands down his favorite sight in the world.</p><p align="justify">Harry smiles, then leans down, locking their lips. They kiss softly, sweetly. It took a while for Harry to teach Draco that. There had been lazy afternoons with movies and popcorn on Harry's couch when he'd kiss Draco and Draco's mouth didn't match Harry's slow pace. Harry had taken the blond's face into his hands.</p><p align="justify">„No,“ he'd said and Draco had blinked at him, confused and a little embarrassed.</p><p align="justify">„Like this.“</p><p align="justify">And he'd shown Draco how to kiss slow.</p><p align="justify">Until then, Harry had hardly ever minded the fast pace Draco seemed to like best, but after that, he's fallen a little more in love with this idiotic Slytherin, who is just <em>so</em> good at sweet kisses, it turns out.</p><p align="justify">Between endless kisses and caressing hands, Draco had asked, face so close that Harry could count his lashes: „Why kiss like this?“</p><p align="justify">Harry hadn't been offended because he already knew that Draco loved it.</p><p align="justify">„Because I like kissing you.“</p><p align="justify">Draco had seemed sceptical, so Harry had leaned forward and kissed the frown from his face.</p><p align="justify">„You're like a teenager, Potter,“ Draco had told him and Harry had rolled his eyes, laughed.</p><p align="justify">„For you? Always.“</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When Harry pulls back now, Draco's face is more open and relaxed. He rests his forehead against the blond's.</p><p align="justify">„Harry?“</p><p align="justify">„Yeah?“</p><p align="justify">„Can I sleep here tonight? I just... don't want to be alone.“</p><p align="justify">Harry looks into Draco's eyes and sees that vulnerability that Draco lets him see so rarely and there it is again, his heart breaking a little.</p><p align="justify">„Of course. Do you want to sleep in my guest room, or...?“</p><p align="justify">Draco just gives him an incredulous look.</p><p align="justify">„I'm sleeping in your bed.“</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The first few moments of waking up are often Draco's favorite part of the day. It's that state of total relaxation when you don't know yet what day it is, what time or what happened and all the things on your To-do-list that demand your attention.</p><p align="justify">Today, the disorientation is more intense than usually. The bed Draco's sleeping in is soft and plush, but smells very faintly of dust.</p><p align="justify">There is a warm body curled around his back and Draco holds his breath. The jolt of panic is quickly replaced whith a giddy, warm feeling swirling through him, warming him from inside out and making him flush.</p><p align="justify">Harry sighs, still asleep, and pulls Draco's body closer. Draco has trouble breathing and laughs at himself for that. It's ridiculous, the way Harry gets to him. A big hand is trailing down Draco's side, resting on his hip and Draco's breath catches.</p><p align="justify">He's still a little amazed by this heat, this sweet pain curling low in his belly that Potter seems to awaken so easily.</p><p align="justify">Draco shifts and Harry's breathing changes. He nuzzles Draco's neck. Harry always does this – smelling his hair. Draco used to find it weird, but now... he really likes it.</p><p align="justify">Kisses are pressed to his neck and Draco feels himself smiling,</p><p align="justify">„Hi,“ Harry murmurs in his ear and Draco laughs.</p><p align="justify">Just to be safe, he turns in Harry's arm. This way, he can smile at him and he won't be freaking out for no reason.</p><p align="justify">Harry's face is surprisingly close to Draco's and he kisses him as soon as Draco smiles up at him. They both don't taste very good this shortly after waking up, but Draco finds he doesn't really care. Harry leans back, pulling Draco with him so that Draco's sprawled over him. He's running his hands over Draco's back and Draco thinks he could get used to this. Oh, he defnitely could.</p><p align="justify">Harry kisses his neck and Draco tilts his head to the side to give him better access. It's something Derek liked to do as well, but Draco pushes the thought away. Harry does it better and it really isn't important anyway.</p><p align="justify">When Harry flips them arond, Draco yelps. He's still not quite used to how strong the Gryffindor is, but he knows now that not many things are a turn-on like Harry manhandling him is.</p><p align="justify">„Do you think they can wait a little longer for us?“ Harry asks, already kissing his way down Draco's chest.</p><p align="justify">It takes Draco a moment to realize that Harry is talking about work.</p><p align="justify">„I'm sure they'll understand we need our time to recover from the – ah – horrid events... yesterday.“</p><p align="justify">It's hard to form words when Harry is dragging his mouth down Draco's belly, his hands stroking his thighs.</p><p align="justify">„They definitely will.“</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">After being blown by Harry bloody Potter, Draco needs a moment of recovery from <em>that</em> rather than from swinging his wand at criminals.</p><p align="justify">And yet, reality comes back all too quickly, destroying the glorious golden haze Harry left him in. Despite the wonder Draco still always feels when Harry gives him head (and not even after Draco'd done the same to him), today the warmth and liquid feeling don't last long. Everything leads back to Derek, somehow.</p><p align="justify">„You always look so surprised,“ Harry tells him after Draco has crawled up again, resting his head on Harry's chest and wiping his mouth.</p><p align="justify">„Hm?“</p><p align="justify">Harry's hands card through Draco's hair, which is still a total mess (Harry always has his hands in it when Draco sucks him and Draco doesn't plan on telling him that it's quite sexy).</p><p align="justify">„When I give you a blowjob.“</p><p align="justify">Draco huffs. This is something he's not so fond of – Harry's tendency to call him out on things he does in bed, as if he wants to analyze him. Draco doesn't like it.</p><p align="justify">„If it bothers you, you don't have to do it,“ Draco says, aware he's being childish.</p><p align="justify">He doesn't even have to look at him to know Harry is rolling his eyes.</p><p align="justify">„Draco.“</p><p align="justify">Harry saying his name like this makes his chest tighten.</p><p align="justify">„I just didn't take you for one to suck dick, is all.“</p><p align="justify">„I'm into men. I feel like the chances that I do are rather high, don't you agree?“</p><p align="justify">Draco never knows how to explain things like that to Harry. It seems like the Gryffindor lives in a completely different world when it comes to such matters.</p><p align="justify">„Yes, but... you seem to -“</p><p align="justify">Draco trails off. He's not sure whether he should really say this. Sometimes he doesn't know what's offensive and what isn't. This might be risky. He doesn't want Harry to get angry at him.</p><p align="justify">„I seem to...?“</p><p align="justify">Harry nudges Draco's head with his chin.</p><p align="justify">„Enjoy it?“</p><p align="justify">Draco's glad he can't look at Harry's face.</p><p align="justify">There is a pause and Draco ducks his head, sure that it was a mistake to say that.</p><p align="justify">„Of course I do. Don't you? I mean, don't you enjoy giving blowjobs?“</p><p align="justify">Draco blinks. He's never been asked that before.</p><p align="justify">To his chagrin, Harry shifts and tugs at Draco's shoulder until he sits up and they can look at each other.</p><p align="justify">„I do,“ Draco says, cheeks warming. <em>If it's you</em>, he silently adds.</p><p align="justify">„Good,“ Harry says, some of the lightness returning to his voice. „Draco...“</p><p align="justify">This tone, Draco does not like. It's almost always followed by uncomfortable questions and he feels like this was enough for one morning. Plus, the way Harry studies his face makes him twitchy and awakens the urge to run and hide in him.</p><p align="justify">„You know that... you never have to do anything just for me, yeah?“</p><p align="justify">Draco's eyes flick up at him.</p><p align="justify">„I know.“</p><p align="justify">But even Draco realizes, at least partly, that that's not really true.</p><p align="justify">With Harry, everything is different and Draco is starting to see the amount of things that had been so, so wrong with Derek. And yet, it's hard to break patterns, unlearn things that are engraved in your brain.</p><p align="justify">„I'm not sure you do. I feel like you somehow think that you <em>have</em> to please me, but if it's the other way around, you're surprised.“</p><p align="justify">Harry has this way of voicing things in a way that Draco has to stop and think that, well, if he says it like that, it really does seem stupid. Not fair.</p><p align="justify">Harry pushes Draco's hair behind his ear, then lets his hand linger, fingers tracing over Draco's cheeks.</p><p align="justify">„I'm not Derek, Draco. I never want you to feel less than me.“</p><p align="justify">Draco looks at him and, as always, Harry's rugged beauty takes his breath away.</p><p align="justify">„I know you're not Derek,“ Draco says finally.</p><p align="justify">They haven't talked about him. But Draco starts to think that maybe, Harry isn't as oblivious as he often seems. That he picks up on more things than Draco would like him to.</p><p align="justify">Draco leans forward and kisses Harry.</p><p align="justify">The Gryffindor hums against his lips.</p><p align="justify">„We should get ready for work,“ Draco says and has to laugh at Harry whining. He tries to pull Draco back into bed and Draco hesitates.</p><p align="justify">„I need to get to work,“ he says softly, putting his hands over Harry's on his waist, looking at him. Rationally, he knows that the Gryffindor is just joking. Draco could just swat his hands away and leave. And yet, his body is programmed to go still, wait. It's something Draco only notices now.</p><p align="justify">Something in Harry's expression shifts. He sits up and kisses Draco, letting go of his waist.</p><p align="justify">„Me too.“</p><p align="justify">Draco gets to shower first and he hesitates quite a while, raised wand hovering over the lock of the door. He wants to lock it. It's been a habit from... before and now the urge is even stronger, after Derek.</p><p align="justify">Draco takes a deep breath. If he wants to lock the damn door, he fucking will. Merlin.</p><p align="justify">With a click, the door locks and Draco steps into the shower.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The Auror Headquarters resemble an especially busy, rather uncoordinated beehive. Pansy has been run into by three people on her way to the office and she really does try her best not to get annoyed. Sam is there leaning against her table, coffee in hand and talking to Terry Boot.</p><p align="justify">„Parkinson,“ Archer says and Pansy drops her documents on his desk.</p><p align="justify">„I doubt that it'll help you all that much, but here's all that I could find in case of spell usage.“ Archer nods and waves her off, leaving the office with the papers in hand.</p><p align="justify">„Find anything helpful?“ Sam asks her as Boot returns to his own desk.</p><p align="justify">„Not really. Except that one of those wankers is a really powerful one. He's casting spells I've never heard of. You should watch out for him.“</p><p align="justify">Sam nods, pushing her long hair back.</p><p align="justify">„That must be Flint. He's tough. And dangerous, to be honest.“</p><p align="justify">„Did you catch any of them yet?“ Pansy asks, mirroring Sam's position.</p><p align="justify">„No,“ she sighs, adjusting her blouse. She looks tired, Pansy thinks. They probably all are.</p><p align="justify">„What about Derek Connor?“</p><p align="justify">Sam's dark eyes watch her knowingly.</p><p align="justify">„The other Aurors are working his case. Archer thinks that we're too... <em>involved</em> to be professional when it comes to him.“</p><p align="justify">Even though Pansy knows that to be true, she'd rather have Sam on the case. And Potter, to be honest. Among all members of the new generation of Aurors, they are the most competent ones. Plus Draco and Blaise, of course. But Pansy doesn't want either of them near Derek.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Draco spends half of his morning being interrogated by Hermoine, who is anxious to know every last detail of what happened at Azkaban. Even though Draco understands her natural curiosity and, of course, her worry about Ron, he can already feel a headache arising from her relentless questioning.</p><p align="justify">„I'm sorry for grilling you like this,“ she says when the corners of Draco's mouth are starting to point downwards. „It must be difficult for you, knowing Connor is free again.“</p><p align="justify">Draco almost laughs at this. Difficult. That's one word for it.</p><p align="justify">„I'll be fine,“ he says and wants nothing more than to leave the office. Maybe get some coffee and work on his new project.</p><p align="justify">Hermoine gives him a wry look, brushing back her frizzy curls. Sometimes, Draco really wonders how this extraordinary woman ended up with Ron Weasley, of all people. She's so much more... refined than he is. And, in Draco's opinion, more attractive too, even though he knows that it's probably mostly her intelligence he finds intriguing.</p><p align="justify">„Draco, if I was you, I'd be terrified.“</p><p align="justify">„Is that supposed to make me feel better?“</p><p align="justify">She sighs and, to Draco's surprise, reaches out to pat him on the back. Draco tries not to flinch, but Hermoine notices anyway and draws her hand back.</p><p align="justify">„The Aurors will catch him soon, I'm sure.“</p><p align="justify">Draco touches his brow, then pushes his hair back. It's now a little longer than shoulder-length and he keeps thinking about cutting it. He's feminine enough with a short haircut already, and yet... Draco like his longer hair. How it feels under his fingers, how it softens his features a little. And Harry seems to like it too.</p><p align="justify">„If Harry doesn't blow up their whole quarters first,“ Draco says dryly, then bites his tongue. Hermoine just shoots him a look of complete understanding.</p><p align="justify">„One can only hope,“ she says, her gaze on the moonstone she's examining. „Harry always was a little hot-headed.“</p><p align="justify">Draco knows she's right, even though to him, it doesn't really feel like it. After Derek, <em>hot-headed</em> takes on a whole new dimension.</p><p align="justify">And Harry is always so gentle with Draco. Sometimes, it infuriates the blond – as if Harry'd think Draco is fragile, which he really isn't. But it's also difficult because Draco doesn't know what to do with it, how to deal with all those feelings that are swirling in his chest when Harry acts like that.</p><p align="justify">„He's working on it,“ Draco says in Harry's defense.</p><p align="justify">„I know. He wants to be better for you.“</p><p align="justify">Hermoine's words and the knowing smile on her face throw Draco.</p><p align="justify">„What? No, I have nothing to do with it.“</p><p align="justify">„Yes, you do. Look, I don't want to inflate your ego, but you really make Harry strive to be better. It's been quite a while since I have seen him trying so hard. Since the war... he's always carried this anger and I never felt like he cared much to fight it. I think he thought it was righteous. But now, with you, he doesn't want to be like that anymore.“</p><p align="justify">It takes Draco a moment to process that. He's rather used to bringing out the worst in people – it's strange that Hermoine says it'd be the opposite with Harry.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When Draco leaves the Ministry in the early evening, Harry is still at the headquarters and probably will be there for some more hours. Afterall, they've come in pretty late and the Aurors are drowning in work.</p><p align="justify">The cold of London's December is cutting through Draco's coat, making him shiver.</p><p align="justify">He slips through the door of his favorite café – small and with wooden tables and little plastic flowers in vases for decoration. The coffee isn't the best Draco's ever had, but the hot chocolate is exceptional and so far, he's never run into anyone here that he knows</p><p align="justify">The waiter knows Draco as a regular by now and just smiles at him, asking: „The usual?“ Draco nods and sets up his laptop.</p><p align="justify">He hasn't told anyone about this and he's rather convinced he'll take this secret to his grave.</p><p align="justify">Draco writes.</p><p align="justify">It's nothing special and he wouldn't let anyone read it, but he finds that nothing clears his head like dipping into another world, transforming his twisted feelings into words and making up characters, who each get a little of Draco's baggage and a little of their own.</p><p align="justify">Sipping his hot chocolate and fingers flying over the keys, time passes all too quickly.</p><p align="justify">On his way home, Draco decides to stop by Diagon Alley to buy the new potions book that just came out yesterday and is supposed to include no less than five newly developed recipes. He'll definitely have to discuss it with Pansy as soon as she gets hers.</p><p align="justify">Draco keeps his head down and curses his characteristic blond hair – not for the first time. It's such an unsual color, it makes most people turn their heads and as soon as they do, their faces harden at the sight of the wayward Malfoy-offspring, who somehow wormed his way out of prison.</p><p align="justify">As a kid, Draco loved sauntering through Diagon. There is so much to see and he'd almost always met some friends with whom he could marvel at the newest broomsticks or pet the strangest animals.</p><p align="justify">Now thought, he can't really enjoy it anymore – not with so many people throwing dark glances at him.</p><p align="justify">Despite his hurry to leave the famous alley again, he risks a glimpse at the window of Quality Quidditch Supplies.</p><p align="justify">He pauses. Looks a little more closely.</p><p align="justify">A smile is playing around the corners of his mouth.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When Harry gets home this day, he is beyond tired. They've worked their asses off all day, running solely on coffee and yet, Harry feels like they're still at square one. It frustrates him to no end that he can't go after Derek, even though the rational part of his brain understands that it might be for the best.</p><p align="justify">Grimmauld Place is empty when Harry arrives and his heart sinks a tiny bit. It's not like Draco would be here every night, but his visits have become more frequent and the house is starting to feel lonely whenever the Slytherin isn't around.</p><p align="justify">Harry toes off his shoes and rubs his hands, trying to chase away the First-of-December cold. Just as he's contemplating whether he's got the energy to cook up some pasta or if a bowl of cereal will have to suffice, there is a tentatitve knock on the door.</p><p align="justify">Harry breaks into a smile. Only Draco knocks like this.</p><p align="justify">When Harry opens the door, the blond's cheeks are rosy from the cold and his hair a little messy from the hat he's probably just taken off. He's carrying a rather large shopping bag.</p><p align="justify">„Hey.“</p><p align="justify">Harry kisses him hello, Draco's lips cold and a little chapped.</p><p align="justify">„Can I come in?“ Draco asks, eyebrow raised and Harry hastily steps aside to let him enter.</p><p align="justify">„I was just about to make dinner,“ Harry says, heading back to the kitchen. „Have you eaten yet?“</p><p align="justify">„No, dinner sounds good.“</p><p align="justify">Draco follows him, his steps almost soundless. Harry knows no one who is able to move as quietly as Draco.</p><p align="justify">„How was your day?“ he asks, setting up a pot on the stove.</p><p align="justify">„Alright. Yours has probably been busy?“</p><p align="justify">Harry rolls his eyes and sighs.</p><p align="justify">„You can say that. Everyone's acting like Voldemort'd be back and no one's getting shit done.“</p><p align="justify">„I have something that might make your day a little better.“</p><p align="justify">Harry turns to Draco, smiling in anticipation. He can think of quite a lot of things Draco could do to make Harry's day better.</p><p align="justify">He's surprised when the blond holds the shopping bag up.</p><p align="justify">„Here. It's for you.“</p><p align="justify">Harry frowns in cofusion and looks into the bag. There is something like a big, rather flat package in there. He pulls it out and studies it. It takes him a moment to recognize it for what it is.</p><p align="justify">„An advent calendar?“</p><p align="justify">„Yes.“</p><p align="justify">Harry stares at it. There are small, drawn Quidditch players flying over a Quidditch pitch with Christmas decoration. The numbers on the small doors are moving, constantly switching places.</p><p align="justify">Harry's heart is too big for his chest. A huge lump is clogging his throat as he stares at the calendar.</p><p align="justify">„You don't like it?“</p><p align="justify">Draco sounds disappointed and Harry looks at him, still not able to speak.</p><p align="justify">Anxiety is clouding Draco's features now as he shifts his weight, playing with the hem of his jumper.</p><p align="justify">„Of course, you don't have to use it. I can take it back to my place, if you don't like it. It's probably been a stupid idea, I just -“</p><p align="justify">„Draco.“</p><p align="justify">The tone of Harry's voice makes Draco stop. His pale eyes are huge, fixed on Harry.</p><p align="justify">„Yes?“</p><p align="justify">„I... thank you. It's great.“</p><p align="justify">A careful smile is tugging at the corners of the blond's mouth.</p><p align="justify">„So you like it?“</p><p align="justify">Harry blinks. Speaking is still tricky. „I love it. I really...“ He trails off. Takes a deep breath. Draco seems confused, if not anxious anymore.</p><p align="justify">„It's nothing,“ he says. „I just saw it in the window and then... I thought of you. It wasn't really expensive, don't worry.“</p><p align="justify">Harry shakes his head, not sure what he's saying no to.</p><p align="justify">„It's not nothing. I've never had one. This is the first time anyone's ever...“</p><p align="justify">Now Harry feels stupid. It's just a sodding advent calendar. A sweet gesture, for sure. One that should make Harry smile. He should hug Draco and then snog him senseless, then get back to his pasta. It shouldn't be that big of a deal.</p><p align="justify">And yet, for Harry, it counts more than Draco could possibly fathom.</p><p align="justify">The Slytherin's features soften and for a moment, there is something like pain displayed on his face. It disappears as he comes closer, lifting a hand to cup Harry's cheek.</p><p align="justify">„I'm glad you like it,“ he says simply and now Harry manages a smile.</p><p align="justify">„I really do.“</p>
