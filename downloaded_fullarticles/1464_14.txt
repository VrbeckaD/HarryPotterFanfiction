    <p>The bed was as comfortable as Harry remembered it. It looked just the same as it had a year before, just a bit more dusty because of the battle. The Gryffindor Tower hadn't been damaged. It was just a bit dirtier. The Fat Lady had let Harry in without a password, she smiled at him and told her friend Violet, that “this is Harry Potter, I always knew he would turn out special, always predicted it and always supported him.”<br/>
Harry sighed as he lay himself on the bed, even up here he could hear the constant chattering of the survivors down in the Great Hall.<br/>
Survivors, Harry thought, that is what they were. They weren't happy, everybody had lost someone, a friend, a relative, but they had survived.<br/>
And, Harry mused, one could work with that.<br/>
Just as he closed his eyes, he heard someone the door to the dorm open.<br/>
“Harry?”, someone whispered.<br/>
Harry held his breath. How often had he imagined to hear her voice in the past few months ? How often had he closed his eyes and had seen her pretty face in his head?<br/>
“Harry? Are you awake?”<br/>
Harry sat up and there he stood.<br/>
“Ginny”, he breathed.<br/>
She was even more beautiful than she had been in summer. She was just perfect. Her hair was dusty but still shined and her eyes were puffed and red from crying, but she was still perfect to him.<br/>
“Would... would you mind if I join you?”, she asked.<br/>
Harry shook his head and made room for her in his bed.<br/>
They sat there silently for a few minutes. Harry wanted to say so much to her, he didn't know where to begin.<br/>
“It's really over, isn't it?”, Ginny asked finally.<br/>
“Yes.”<br/>
“We won.”<br/>
“Yes.”<br/>
“Doesn't feel that way, though.”<br/>
“No, it doesn't.”<br/>
Suddenly there were tears in Ginny's eyes.<br/>
“Fred, Tonks, Lupin a-and Colin and God knows how many others”, she sobbed.<br/>
“I'm so sorry, Gin-Gin.”<br/>
“Don't”, she said. “You saved so many others. We would all be dead if not for you. You're a hero.”<br/>
Harry didn't respond. He didn't feel like a hero.<br/>
Ginny sobbed a few minutes, than she took a deep breath. The tears were gone, for now, at least.<br/>
“Will you hold me?”, she asked him. “Until I fall asleep?”<br/>
Harry smiled. There wasn't anything he would love to do more. “Sure.”<br/>
They lay back down.<br/>
“Can you promise me something?”, Ginny asked.<br/>
“Anything.”<br/>
“Don't ever run of like that again. And never, ever scare me with playing dead.”<br/>
Harry chuckled. “I won't, Gin-Gin.”<br/>
“Gin-Gin?”<br/>
“Thought I'd try something new.”<br/>
“I like it.”<br/>
Harry inhaled smilingly. Ginny still smelled like flowers, he noticed. God, he had missed her scent. He breathed in again.<br/>
“I missed you”, he whispered.<br/>
“I missed you, too”, Ginny mumbled already half-asleep.<br/>
Harry fell asleep after that with a small smile on his face. He wasn't happy, but he had survived and so had Ginny. Together they would regain their happiness and build a new life.</p>
