    <p>A/N this is a revised and edited version of Grim's child. Revision 11/13. </p><p>Parts taken from Shadow's child. Thank you heavily for inspiring this story. </p><p>Harrison's POV </p><p>He ran into the shack, ducking through the door just as my mother looked outside.  He grinned as he panted, his mother hadn't seen him. If she had, the whole manor would know by now.</p><p>With an easy grace, Harrison walked towards the bathroom and stripped. Stepping into the shower stall, he turned the hot water on high, letting the water droplets cascade down my bare skin. </p><p>He stayed in the shower for almost an hour, just soothing muscles in the heat and comfort of the steam building around him. </p><p>Almost too soon, he thought, he stepped out of the shower and covered myself with a towel. Turning he caught a fleeting flash of something. Harrison fully turned to face the mirror. He saw the steam clear to reveal his reflection.</p><p>It had been a long time since Harrison had seen my reflection. He had spent the last three months in Remnant on a mission with Ozpin, his huntsman and friend. At first, his huntsman didn't want to bring him. With Glynda Goodwitch's absolute refusal to keep an eye on him his hand was forced. </p><p>Honestly, Harrison didn't blame her few of the hunters trusted him because he was a hound. In the world of Remnant, there are two kinds of people. The humans and the Faunus. </p><p>Amongst the Faunus, there are a special kind that looks and acts the exact same. Until threatened that was. They are the faunist that have Grim blood within them. Grim are dark creatures that are neither living nor dead.</p><p>He was able to travel between earth and remnant due to the large amount of Grim blood that was in his veins. Oz still didn't know where that had come from because both of his parents had been human. </p><p>Then again Harrison's earliest memories were of running with a Beowulf pack until Oz destroyed the pack and rescued him.</p><p>When Harrison had returned to earth two years after my rescue he found out he had been missing since he was three. The only reason why my mother cared was because the Potter's were looking at marriage contracts. </p><p>Harrison couldn't remember his biological father and he was the youngest of the triplets. For the longest time, he couldn't understand why my mother hated him. </p><p>The oldest brother Raiden took pity on him one day and said, "You are a squib. This means you can't use magic. Mother will never want a squib and when Father gets back he will throw you out. You should just go back to whatever hole they found you in." </p><p>So that's what he did. Harrison disappeared for months on end to do his work in Remnant. When he turned 15 he would finally be allowed to attend Beacon Academy as a student.</p><p>The large hunter-huntress training academy had been around for hundreds of years training the best and the brightest. Even as Ozpin's prized student and Hound he had to follow the rules. At least for the most part. Like any teenager, he tended to be a little rebellious. Goodwitch blamed Qrow's influence. </p><p>Harrison's access to the school consisted of training rooms and Ozpin's office. Connected to his office were two bedrooms with a shared bathroom. </p><p>Oz lately had been overprotective. Harrison hadn't been allowed out of the school much even when the moon wasn't at its peak. Then their mission he wasn't allowed away from the huntsman's side.</p><p>With that, he stepped away from the mirror and moved towards the wardrobe. Stepping inside, he quickly dressed into a worn, patched and frayed old black cloak, as well as a pair of muggle black jeans and black t-shirt underneath. Chuckling as he moved towards the door of my shack, thinking.</p><p>When Harrison arrived at the dining hall, his brothers, Damien and Raiden, were already there and sitting with their mother. His face became unreadable, aura cold, and deceptive, his eyes became blank as they came closer to my family.</p><p>He was completely emotionless, and it was an incredible thing to watch if one had seen him only seconds before.</p><p>When Harrison took my seat at the end of the table, his brothers sneered at him. Ignoring them, he focused on eating. His mother seemed to be happy about something, and when they were all done eating, the three brothers turned to face her.</p><p>"Boys, I have great news," she said, her eyes shining in glee. </p><p>The two boys, Damien, and Gabriel, one of which she thought would be Slytherin's heir, were excited. He simply looked bored. </p><p>"Your father is returning. He should be reborn tonight and will be home tomorrow morning to see you. All of you." she added with a sneer, looking in his direction.</p><p>On the outside, Harrison congratulated himself on looking completely emotionless. On the inside, he had frozen stock still. He cursed inwardly, his father was coming back.</p>
