    <p>Petra Andel was a slytherin in her fourth year at hogwarts, she was tough and didn't have many friends, even though there was always this boy around her. Rafael Solano, Jane thought that was his name, he is a griffindor so she doesn't know why they were always together. First because griffindors and slytherins don't usually get along very well and second because he seemed to be Petra's only friend.<br/>
Jane was also at her fourth year at hogwarts but she was sorted to Ravenclaw House, she had some friends, not many but mostly because she was a little introverted. She was aware of Petra's existence since her first year at school, when they had potions together (a class that they still share and Jane sucks at), but never really talked to the blonde. She used to just watch her from afar in class. Jane wasn't sure what but she thought that there was something so compelling about Petra, the way she laughed when she saw a hufflepuff falling to their feet, or the way she smiled proudly whenever a teacher (most frequently snape) complemented her work, maybe even the way her eyes closed a little when she was paying too much attention and the way she removed her hair from her face whenever it bothered her vision. Jane was done just watching, she didn't know what she wanted with Petra but she knew that she wanted something and she was confident that she was gonna take it. But not now, Jane thought to herself, now she was fine with just watching.</p><p>- Jane? Jane, are you even listening to me?? - a voice woke her up from her thoughts, Lina's voice.</p><p>Lina was her friend since she was little, they were very different but got along really well. They came to Hogwarts together but were sorted into different houses, Lina was a griffindor, what didn't shake their friendship that much, they were always together when they could.</p><p>- Um yeah sure, i mean, i am. - Jane babbled.</p><p>- Then what was i talking about? </p><p>- You were saying...? - she tried to think about something quick but everything that came to her mind was Petra's golden gorgeous hair. - Okay sorry, I wasn't listening.</p><p>- I knew it - Lina snapped </p><p>- Of course she wasn't listening, she was too busy staring at that slytherin girl like a fool again. - a voice from behind them said.</p><p>The girls turned around, not so surprised to find out who was the owner of the voice.</p><p>- I wasn't staring at noone, Michael, I was just lost in my thoughts. I have a lot of work to do! - jane lied, she could feel her cheeks burning from embarrassement. She ran her eyes to the spot where Petra was before just to make sure she hadn't heard Michael, but the girl was no longer there.</p><p>Michael was also a friend of jane's, not as close as Lina but he was surely one of the closest. They met shortly before the Sorting Hat cerimony, chatted a little bit and were sure they would be in the same house but the Sorting Hat seemed to not agree that much with it, since Michael was now a Hufflepuff.</p><p>- Oh sure Jane, i believe you. - Michael mocked her.</p><p>Jane was about to say something that she would regret and probably make a fool of herself but, luckily, she was stopped by the sound of bells announcing to students their next classes.</p><p>- I don't need you to believe me, what i need is for you to give my quill back so i can run to Charms before Prof. Flitwick realizes i'm not there. - She snapped, her hand now open in the boy's direction, waiting for the object.</p><p>- Oh sorry, i forgot about that. Here. - he said as he handed her the quill, watching her quickly run up the stairs and disppear.</p><p>- You know she has a lot of other quills, right? - Lina said, laughing at the ridiculous way Jane excused herself. - She didn't need you to give it back, she was just embarrassed.</p><p>- I know, she doesn't even have Charms now. - Michael laughed too, he loved to tease Jane, they may have been friends for only 4 years but he thinks about her like a sister.</p>
