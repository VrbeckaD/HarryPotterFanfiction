    <p>it’s embarrassing, really. harry had told the department plenty of times that he didn’t want to be featured on any of the posters. but kingsley, the bastard, had promised that harry could skip the next three events he’d normally expect to play a big role in hosting if he’d pose for a promotional campaign for a program hermione developed to help at-risk wizarding youth and discourage crime.</p><p>the posters, of course, are everywhere, including around the ministry, which is just objectively silly. harry can’t walk anywhere without seeing himself. it hasn’t been this bad since he was a teenager.</p><p>he steps out of a lift on his way to visit hermione at her office and jumps when greeted with yet another poster.</p><p>“you know, you’re not very intimidating,” draco says, and harry jumps again. “case in point.”</p><p>“piss off,” harry says, righting his robes. “have you defaced any of them yet?”</p><p>“not yet,” draco replies, “why, d’you want me to?”</p><p>“if it gets them taken down, yes,” harry says, and then he adds, “actually, even if it doesn’t, yes. they’re ridiculous.”</p><p>“they’re not even very good,” draco says. “kind of clash with the whole point of hermione’s program, don’t they? the point isn’t to intimidate kids off the streets. it’s to help them.”</p><p>harry blinks. it’s not an uncommon occurrence these days, but it still startles him when he and draco are on the same page, or draco and hermione.</p><p>“good thing i failed at looking intimidating for the photographs, then,” he says mildly.</p><p>“oh, yes, i’m sure it was very intentional,” draco replies, grinning, and harry elbows him.</p>
