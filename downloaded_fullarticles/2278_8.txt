    <p>Halfway into the school year, Sirius comes to the conclusion that he’s in love with Remus Lupin.</p><p>He knows he shouldn’t be letting himself get distracted with feelings, considering it’s his first year at the school and he’s always had a sort of personal rule against getting involved with someone he works with, but Sirius finds himself glancing across the hall through the little window in the door during class far more often than he should.</p><p>“Hey,” he’d said earlier after knocking lightly on Remus' door and opening it without waiting for a response. “Do you have a whiteboard pen I can use?”</p><p>It was Remus' free period, and he was sitting at his desk, looking fantastic, marking essays with a red pen and Sirius had wanted Remus to stab him in the throat with it.</p><p>Alright, a bit of an extreme reaction, but he stands by it.</p><p>“Did you somehow manage to lose all of them?” Remus had asked dryly. “That’s impressive, I could have sworn I gave you one last week.”</p><p>“You know, I only had the one, and I used it so much that it dried out really quickly. I’m very hands-on when it comes to writing on the board.”</p><p>“I didn’t think there was any other way to write, you kind of have to use your hands.”</p><p>Sirius, caught a bit off guard at the casual way Remus was talking about using hands – sure, the conversation was innocuous enough, but his <em>tone</em> – had sputtered something about how he had to get back to his class, to which Remus had smoothly replied that maybe he shouldn’t leave them unattended so much and tossed him a whiteboard pen. After barely managing to catch it and completely failing to get a handle on the color of his face, Sirius had practically sprinted back into his own classroom and proceeded to spend an hour talking about Macbeth to uninterested teenagers.</p><p>He’s still thinking about the way the morning had gone hours later, falling into uncharacteristic silence during lunch in James’ classroom.</p><p>“What’s wrong with you?” Peter asks, kicking Sirius lightly under the table.</p><p>“Did Remus destroy your confidence again?” Lily says between bites of sandwich.</p><p>“<em>Lily</em>,” James almost gasps, his tone reproachful. “We can’t talk about that here, he eats lunch with us.”</p><p>Lily looks around the classroom in an exaggerated motion. “What? He does? I don’t know about you, James, but I don’t see him here right now.”</p><p>“He didn’t destroy my <em>confidence</em>,” Sirius interjects. “He’s, I don’t know. Hot.”</p><p>“So are you, why doesn’t he get all flustered like you do?” James asks.</p><p>“It’s because he’s a top,” Peter says nonchalantly.</p><p>“How do you know that?”</p><p>“Have you seen his hands? You’re lucky he’s not a bottom, Sirius, I don’t know what you’d expect to come of that.”</p><p>“Who’s not a bottom?” Remus says from the door, finally making an appearance, and Sirius nearly chokes.</p><p>“CONOR VANCE,” James shouts over Sirius' coughing.</p><p>“Hmm,” Remus begins, taking the chair between Peter and Lily, “I might have heard something different, who knows.”</p><p>“What?” Sirius croaks, eyes watering. He takes a drink of water and then manages, “How would you know about Conor Vance’s sexual preferences?”</p><p>“Why did you say it like that?” Peter says under his breath. “You sound like a robot.”</p><p>Sirius stops wheezing long enough to glare at Peter but lapses into a coughing fit when he tries to speak again.</p><p>“Are you done?” Remus asks, eyebrows raised, once Sirius finishes almost dying.</p><p>“I’m dead,” Sirius replies, dropping his head on the table harder than he was intending. “Ow.” James laughs.</p><p>“Clearly not, you’re still talking,” Remus says.</p><p>“No, I’m definitely dead.”</p><p>“Do you need me to resuscitate you?”</p><p>“Oooh,” Lily says under her breath, sounding like a fourteen-year-old.</p><p>Ignoring her, Sirius turns his head so that he’s looking up at Remus, cheek pressed against the table. “Oh, <em>absolutely</em>.”</p><p>Remus opens his mouth, a slightly amused expression on his face, when there’s a knock on the door and the moment is lost.</p><p>“Hey, sorry to interrupt,” comes a voice from the door. Sirius sits up as McDougal leans in through the slightly opened door, looking like he came directly from the gym. “McGonagall wanted me to make the rounds, apparently there’s an emergency staff meeting today? Dumbledore wants to talk about something.”</p><p>“Why didn’t they just send out an email?” Peter asks flatly.</p><p>“Pete, you know more than any of us that the chance of us reading an email about an urgent staff meeting while eating lunch and therefore free of responsibility is slim to none.”</p><p>“Uh, what the fuck is that supposed to mean? Do elaborate, <em>Remus</em>.”</p><p>“Why did you say my name like that? You don’t read emails.”</p><p>“It takes you three months to remember a single student’s name!”</p><p>“Do – do any of you have any questions about the staff meeting, or can I go?” McDougal asks from the door. “I still have to go talk to the science department.”</p><p>“Yeah, we’re good, thanks Gregor,” James replies over Remus and Peter’s bickering.</p><p>“Cool,” McDougal replies before jogging down the hall, presumably towards the science department.</p><p>“<em>Gregor</em>?” Sirius asks. “That’s his name?”</p><p>“What’s wrong with it?”</p><p>“I don’t know, it’s weird.”</p><p>“Your whole family are named after constellations and shit, don’t get cocky.”</p><p>Sirius points at James threateningly, both of them trying not to laugh. “You’d better be careful of the road you’re heading down, <em>Fleamont</em>.”</p><p>Lily kicks everyone out of the classroom (“It isn’t even your room!” Sirius had protested) a few minutes before the bell is supposed to ring, citing that she wants a little bit of time alone with James.</p><p>“Do you think they’re gonna fuck?” Peter asks as they walk down the hall. James’ classroom is on the other end of the building from Sirius and Remus' rooms, and Peter’s in a different wing altogether because he has an actual lab, so they have a little bit of a walk ahead of them.</p><p>“Probably,” Remus replies casually. “They’ve been together forever and they have fifteen minutes. Time restraints and a forbidden location. Looks like they’re spicing it up.”</p><p>“Kinky,” Sirius says.</p><p>“Do you think so?” Remus answers, looking straight ahead, and the way his voice sounds makes Sirius want to be choked.</p><p>“Yeah,” he replies instead, keeping his tone light. “Love a quickie.”</p><p>“Okay, well, I think that’s my cue,” Peter interjects, making a left turn down a different hall so that he can head towards his classroom. “Make good choices, you two.”</p><p>Sirius pauses, watching Peter walk away for a moment before realizing that Remus is looking at him instead. “What?”</p><p>“Nothing,” Remus replies, then starts to head down the hall again. “Are you coming?”</p><p>“I don’t know, am I?” Sirius rushes out after a beat, deciding he doesn’t give a fuck.</p><p>“Maybe so,” Remus says, and Sirius has to physically force himself not to ask Remus to slam him against the wall.</p><p>“Oh,” he says instead, sweating.</p><p>Sirius spends the rest of the afternoon far too distracted to actually teach and decides to maintain the pretense of having the class do work by making them read passages aloud to pass the time. He’s fully aware that the kids hate it and think it’s embarrassing, but to be honest, he has other things to think about at this point.</p><p>There’s a knock on his door after his last class is over. “Come in,” Sirius calls, not looking up from his laptop, and the door opens a second later.</p><p>“Hey,” Remus' voice says, and Sirius very quickly redirects his attention. “I didn’t know you wore glasses.”</p><p>“Oh, just for like, looking at the computer screen, my doctor said I was straining them. My eyes, I mean. Anyway, they make me feel old.”</p><p>He might be reading too far into this, but Remus is looking at him in a way that makes his stomach feel tight and fluttery and Sirius wants to kiss him. Remus is laughing a little when he says, “Aren’t you twenty-three?”</p><p>“Yeah, I just don’t like them,” Sirius manages. He’s impressed with his own skill at maintaining some level of dignity at this point, when Remus is just there, looking like <em>that</em>.</p><p>He doesn’t really look any different from how he does every day, he’s consistently tall and curly haired and wearing stupid ties and being Welsh, but Sirius thinks that Remus could show up wearing an outfit made from garbage and he would still want to get absolutely wrecked by him.</p><p>“I like them,” Remus replies. “You look good.”</p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p>“You’re welcome.”</p><p>There’s a brief moment of pause, during which Sirius contemplates leaping over his desk and just going for it. He decides against that, instead saying, “Anyway, what did you –” at the exact moment that Remus begins, “So, I was wondering –”</p><p>“Yes?” Sirius says after both of them stop.</p><p>“You sure you don’t want to go first?” Remus asks.</p><p>“I’m sure.”</p><p>“I was…wondering if you –” Remus pauses, runs a hand through his hair, then clears his throat and continues. “Do you want to do something? Later. Like, come over or something.”</p><p>“Oh,” Sirius says, a little shocked, then realizes that the way he responded with just that single word makes it sound like he doesn’t want to. “Yes,” he adds quickly.</p><p>It sounds rushed and desperate and he hates himself.</p><p>Remus doesn’t seem to notice Sirius' intense deliberation over his choice of words, instead just smiling immediately and beautifully as soon as he replies, and Sirius is in love with him. “Really?” Remus asks.</p><p>“Yeah, I’d love to,” Sirius replies softly. “We could go get something to eat after the staff meeting.”</p><p>“Oh, shit, we have to go to that.”</p><p>“We’re definitely already late at this point.”</p><p>They end up running through the empty halls of the school, reaching the conference room on the other side of the building about eight minutes later than they were supposed to. Peter raises his eyebrows suggestively when the two of them slip into the room, flushed and breathless, Remus pointing out a small table off to the side of the main one.</p><p>“Sorry,” Sirius says to the room, whispering to Remus, “What?”</p><p>“There’s no space at the big one, come on.”</p><p>Everyone’s piled their bags around this table, prepared to leave as soon as Dumbledore decides to free them from this impromptu hell of a meeting. The man himself is rambling about some kind of parents’ night that he wants to do in hopes of fundraising for new lab equipment or something. Sirius isn’t listening; this sounds like it has nothing to do with his department and definitely wasn’t worth calling a staff meeting over but rather than pay attention to Dumbledore’s speech, he’s very focused on the tiny table he’s sharing with Remus and the fact that their knees just touching each other underneath it.</p><p>They listen to Dumbledore for approximately two more minutes before Sirius decides to just fucking go for it and, before he can lose his nerve, puts his hand on Remus' thigh.</p><p>There’s a notepad on the table to keep up the pretense of them taking notes and paying attention. Sirius writes – nearly illegibly, since he’s had to use his left hand – <em>ok?</em></p><p>Remus, fighting a grin, says under his breath, “Yeah, you’re great,” with his eyes still at the front of the room.</p><p>Sirius admires his professionalism and decides in turn to be super professional himself, walking his fingers along Remus' leg and pausing with his hand on Remus' belt buckle.</p><p>“Bold move, Sirius,” Remus says in a tone that sounds as though he’s commenting on a choice in shirt, not Sirius contemplating how to undo his belt without making any noise.</p><p>“Shut up,” Sirius hisses. Remus raises his eyebrows, looking amused.</p><p>“Are you telling me what to do?” His tone is smooth and cocky and insufferable, and Sirius wants to suck him off.</p><p>“Maybe I am, do you have a problem with it?”</p><p>Snape starts coughing loudly at the front of the room and Sirius takes the opportunity to deftly unbuckle Remus' belt, the hacking wheezes disguising the telltale jingle of metal.</p><p>“Possibly.” Remus looks down at the table and noticeably sucks in a breath when Sirius puts his hand down the front of his pants, noting with a hint of satisfaction that he’s already half hard.</p><p>“And why’s that?”</p><p>“I don’t know,” Remus continues, looking up and shifting the way he’s been sitting so that his chin is propped up on his left hand and he looks slightly more attentive. “Maybe because you’re the biggest sub I’ve ever seen.”</p><p>“I am <em>not</em>, you hooked up with Emmeline Vance, and because James did too, during uni, I know for a fact that she’s at <em>least </em>on the same level as me.”</p><p>“No, she’s a brat, you’re a sub, there’s a differen – <em>fuck</em>,” Remus replies, stopping mid-explanation to put his hand over his mouth when Sirius wraps a hand around his dick.</p><p>“I’m sorry, what was that? What’s the difference?” Sirius asks, a grin on his face as he starts to move his hand and Remus shuts his eyes.</p><p>“Maybe,” he says after a beat, visibly trying to maintain composure, “maybe I was wrong.”</p><p>“That’s the hottest thing you’ve ever said to me. Wrong about what?”</p><p>“Maybe you are a brat.”</p><p>Sirius leans in closer and says right into Remus' ear, “Do you want to do something about that later?”</p><p>He thinks if they weren’t in the middle of a meeting he would’ve immediately kicked the table away and gotten into Remus' lap when Remus replies, his voice rough, “Fuck, Sirius, of course I do.”</p><p>Dumbledore ends the meeting and Sirius immediately takes his hand away, feeling slightly guilty but also relieved that Remus didn’t come, because he would’ve had no idea what to do after that. Remus hastily gets his pants back in a dignified position and they’re forced to sit at the table for a few more minutes as their coworkers come up and retrieve their bags from the vicinity.</p><p>Eventually, mostly everyone has left the room and the two of them are still sitting there, neither of them saying anything. After another moment, Remus turns to Sirius and says, “Do you still want to come over?”</p><p>Remus has a mouth that looks like it was the star in every wet dream Sirius has ever had, and he wants to get fucked more than he’s wanted to in his entire life.</p><p>“Absolutely,” he says, and follows Remus out the door.</p>
