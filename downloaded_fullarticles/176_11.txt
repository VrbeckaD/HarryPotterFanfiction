The thestral kept nosing until Draco realized that it was eating his hair. He laughed and didn’t mind. </p><p>“Why are you so happy?” Harry asked. He lay on his back in the middle of the gray clearing in the forest. </p><p>“Because we’re alive,” Draco said simply. He didn’t try to stop when the corners of his mouth lifted like a lilting sparrow, stumbling through the air. “I’m alive.”</p><p>Harry spread his limbs in a star-fished angel through the grayish grass that had begun to grow here. “I died here,” he said softly. </p><p>“No,” Draco said. He stayed sitting, his toes and fingers kicking up must and growth into the cloudy green light. A breeze ruffled through the forest and Draco closed his eyes into it and breathed. The thestral continued to eat his hair. He didn’t mind. “You lived here.”</p><p>Harry rolled onto his side and smiled into the earth. “We’re alive.”</p></div>
