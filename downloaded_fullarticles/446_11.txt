    <p>A little bell rings above the glass door as Sirius steps into the bookshop. He’s been here before, many times, but it’s still an impossible maze to him. Sirius doesn’t mind it, though; he quite likes this place. It’s nice and quiet.</p>
<p>Tall, wooden shelves line all the walls, books unevenly stacked throughout, like the person stocking them didn’t really care much, or was in a rush. More shelves are strewn throughout the middle, oddly spaced, with no labels indicating what kinds of books you can find there.</p>
<p>Sirius navigates the wild maze of shelves, trailing his hand along the spines of the books littering the shelves. He’s looking for something on Astronomy, and some old fantasy book James asked for, but which he’s definitely not gonna find.</p>
<p>He’s so focused on the books, it takes him a second to realize he’s bumped into someone. “Oh, sorry!” says Sirius, jumping back a bit.</p>
<p>The boy he’s just knocked into snaps the book he’s holding shut, and turns to face Sirius. “All good! Can I help you find anything?” The boy asks, smiling lightly.</p>
<p>This boy is no older than Sirius, sandy blond hair falling over one eye. He’s wearing the cutest forest green sweater, with light wash jeans. A nose ring draws Sirius’s eyes to his face.</p>
<p>A flush spreads over Sirius’s cheeks when he realizes he’s taken far too long to answer a simple question. “Sorry,” he responds. “Ah, where do the Astronomy books live?”</p>
<p>The other boy looks around for a second. “All over the place. My mum owns this place, and she can’t organize to save her life,” he jokes, fiddling with the lanyard around his neck.</p>
<p>“Say that to my face, kid!” A woman calls. Sirius looks over in the direction and smiles.</p>
<p>When Sirius turns back to face him, the other boy is shaking his head, still smirking. “That’s her. She’s really nice, just never grew out of the catty-middle-school-girl phase,” he says, loud enough for his mum to hear, probably.</p>
<p>“Rude!” His mum replies. The boy rolls his eyes, and beckons for Sirius to follow him.</p>
<p>“C’mon, I’ll help you find the books. Should be in aisle nine, but I can never know for sure…” he trails off, leading Sirius away.</p>
<p>When they find the (maybe) right aisle, the other boy bends down to the bottom shelf, reading along the spines. “Ah, here they are! Astronomy, chemistry, biology, all that jazz. Most of these are diagrams, though, and you don’t look like someone who really needs picture books…”</p>
<p>The boy rambles on, as Sirius stoops down as well to pick out a book. He finds one with a semi-intriguing cover and pulls it out, flipping through, looking at the detailed diagrams.</p>
<p>“I like the diagrams, helps me find the constellations in the sky. How much for this one?” Sirius asks, passing the book between his hands.</p>
<p>The other boy takes the book from Sirius, looking at the bar code on the back, feigning thinking. He pulls a sheet of stickers out of his messenger bag, discreetly sticks it over the bar code.</p>
<p>“Looks like this one’s free!” The boy says, showing the now-covered bar code to Sirius. The sticker over it has “free” written in pen.</p>
<p>“Oh come on, I can’t just take this for free,” Sirius laughs lightly. “It’s brand new!”</p>
<p>“Mhmmm…” the boy says, opening up the book and pulling out a pen. “You got a name, star boy?” He asks, pulling off the pen cap with his teeth.</p>
<p>“Uh— it’s Sirius. Like the star,” Sirius replies nervously, biting his cheek to hold back the grin that wants to come out.</p>
<p>“Of course! The brightest star,” the boy smiles, writing something down on the navy blue inside cover. He hands it back to Sirius, capping the pen and smiling. “I’ll see you around, yeah?”</p>
<p>Sirius’s eyes widen, and he smiles. “Yeah, I hope so.”</p>
<p>The boy smiles at Sirius one last time, winking, before turning away. Sirius grins and makes his way out of the little bookshop, going through the maze once again, finding himself feeling fond of the long trip through the shelves.</p>
<p>Once he’s back home, lying on the bed, Sirius opens the cover.</p>
<p><em>Nice to meet you, Sirius. I’m Remus</em>.</p>
<p>… followed by Remus’s phone number.</p>
