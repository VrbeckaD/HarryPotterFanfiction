She enjoys partying, drinking and boys, often getting herself and others into trouble just for fun. Although somewhat flirty with other males, and willing to make out with those who catch her eye, she is not necessarily promiscuous, considering she is still a virgin, and intends to remain one for as long as she can.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">She had a reputation at Ilvermorny for being someone who you did not want to pick a fight with, especially after she broke a girl's arm in the third year. Basically, Rory is not all talk: not only can she shoot out hilarious and seething comebacks, but she packs a mean punch. Otherwise known as a fighting beast.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Rory finds most information useless unless it teaches her how to become a better witch or hunter. Despite this, she still uses what Sam calls "Rory-logic". Rory-logic mostly just entails trying to find loopholes in everything in order to rationalize doing something unreasonable, or when Rory tries to justify something that makes little sense.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">As stated by once by Agilbert Fontaine, the headmaster of Ilvermorny, Rory understands her duties better than most people twice her age and experience, hence even at the start of her time at the school, looking beyond her smart ass behavior, she was still quite mature in that regard.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Like Dean, Rory has very powerful protective instincts. She cannot stand to sit back and see people get hurt, always trying to do something to help wherever possible, even if for a complete and total stranger. She is extraordinarily devoted to helping innocent people and protecting those that cannot protect themselves. Most often, this protectiveness is directed towards Sam and Dean, although she has shown to be protective over others, including Jody, Castiel, Charlie, Kevin, and of course, Bobby.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Rory can be very sarcastic and sharp-tongued at times. She always has a smart ass comment ready whenever someone says something antagonistic to her, and always bites back with a witty insult. She doesn't hesitate to speak her mind, and can be extremely stubborn in her opinions. Although Rory is not necessarily conceited, she is very aware of the fact that she is beautiful. She is rather proud of her body. She also takes pride in her hair. Also, although she has become much more practical, she can still be somewhat vain at times about her appearance, taking pride in how she looks. Rory can be friendly and warm, not shying away from meeting new people, and has considerable skill in social interactions.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Rory has trouble trusting herself when it comes to her magic, given that her mother was a very powerful but dark witch, Rory believes that that could be part of her blood, and often second guesses herself when casting. Though the top of her classes at Ilvermorny and excelling in most of her classes, Rory has no self-confidence in her abilities. She's always afraid her mother's nature will become her own.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Rory can't cook, sing, dance, sew, and can some times be considered a aloof.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">After being told that Bobby Singer is not her biological father, Rory sets up a series of walls, blocking her heart off from more pain. Having been told by her biological father, a long time friend and someone she looked up to, Rory resents Dean Winchester slightly, a lot, having been lied to for many years.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">

</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western"><strong>Patronus:</strong> Wolf - Wolf Patronuses see their casters as part of their pack, and they are ready to defend them at any cost. Wolves have incredible instincts; they will attack all Dementors in the immediate vicinity and hunt down any stragglers remaining at a distance. No Dementor should cross a wolf Patronus – they are fierce protectors and loyal to their casters beyond any other guardian.</p><p class="western"><strong>House</strong>: Wampus</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">
  <strong>Magical abilities and skills:</strong>
</p><p class="western">Rory proved to be an extremely talented, intelligent and powerful young witch. Even before she began her education at Ilvermorny, she practised some simple spells which all worked.</p><p class="western"><strong>Magical aptitude</strong>: At Ilvermorny, Rory was usually the first to master any spell, and was capable of using spells beyond her educational level.</p><p class="western"><strong>Non-verbal and wandless magic:</strong> Rory became highly skilled at non-verbal magic in her sixth year, being the first to succeed at it in her Defence Against the Dark Arts class and quickly becoming so good at non-verbal incantations that she did not need to say the words aloud for a wide variety of spells. Rory was known to have practised wandless magic in her years at Ilvermorny. She did not need the aid of a wand or magical instrument for a wide variety of spells.</p><p class="western"><strong>Duelling:</strong> Rory demonstrated her fighting ability on numerous occasions, showing remarkable duelling skill for her age.</p><p class="western"><strong>Defence Against the Dark Arts:</strong> Rory was skilled in this subject, she believed, for herself, it was the most needed, thinking that it could help her protect herself against her mother's influence.</p><p class="western"><strong>Charms</strong>: Until she began studying Arithmancy in her third year, Rory's favourite subject was Charms, and indeed some of her most impressive magical feats were charms.</p><p class="western"><strong>Potions</strong>: Rory is able to identify potions and their effects quickly after having only read about them. She was the only one in her sixth year class who understood Golpalott's Third Law, without need for further explanation and was able to compose an antidote containing fifty-two ingredients, including a chunk of her own hair.</p><p class="western"><strong>Transfiguration:</strong> Rory seemed to be particularly talented at Transfiguration. She was the first in her class to succeed at transfiguring a match into a needle in their first lesson, long before any other student. She could also vanish objects, which is one of the hardest spells taught at Ordinary Wizarding Level.</p><p class="western"><strong>Dark charms:</strong> Rory was not known for her ability to cast Dark magic and the extent of her ability within this magical discipline is truly unknown (however, one would assume given her borderline genius status that she was no slouch). Rory always fears this extent of her magic given that her mother was known to be an incredible witch, but an incredible witch that excelled in Dark magic, and was well known for being an 'evil' witch.</p><p class="western"><strong>Apparition</strong>: Rory was the first in her class to Apparate successfully as she had achieved Apparition twice in that time and passed her test on the first attempt.</p><p class="western"><strong>Study of Ancient Runes:</strong> Rory was gifted in translating ancient runes into English.</p><p class="western"><strong>Herbology</strong>: She has great talent in this field as well. She was particularly skilled in spells related to magical plants.</p><p class="western"><strong>Logical thinking and intelligence:</strong> Rory had a mastery of logic that most wizards lacked. Rory is noted to be a borderline genius.</p><p class="western"><strong>Muggle Studies (knowledge):</strong> This was one of the subjects Rory chose to take in her third year, as Rory was raised mostly in the muggle world, she knew a great deal about Muggles already. She was seemingly good at it because she could bring another point of view to the classroom and the lessons. She achieved a score of over 300% on her final exam in third year.</p><p class="western"><strong>History of Magic:</strong> Rory was very interested in the history of the wizarding world from a young age. Even before starting at Ilvermorny, she bought several books and learned them by heart, including Ilvermorny: A History.</p><p class="western"><strong>Care of Magical Creatures</strong>: Rory's favourite subject as she finds it comes in handy with the hunter life, she has a lot of skill interacting with animals.</p><p class="western"><strong>Healing magic:</strong> Rory had some basic skills with Healing Magic. She had knowledge of Mandrake's Healing properties in her second year.</p><p class="western"><strong>Alchemy (theory)</strong>: Rory had read a book containing information on Alchemy and the Philosopher's Stone in her first year. In her sixth year, she easily understood Golpalott's Third law.</p><p class="western"><strong>Flying:</strong> Rory had inherited his mother's talent for flying. She showed immediate command of a broomstick in her first year, that on top of her upfront and confrontational personality made her a naturally good Beater.</p><p class="western"><strong>Indomitable will:</strong> Being a Winchester, Rory possesses an unbreakable spirit and though not above depression, she has never truly given up on any task.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">
  <strong>Items:</strong>
</p><p class="western"><strong>Car: </strong>Bobby's 1971 Chevrolet Chevelle</p><p class="western"><strong>Wand:</strong> 11 inch, English Oak with dragon heartstring and amethyst top and bottom </p><p class="western"><strong>Broom:</strong> Siberian Arrow</p><p class="western"><strong>Cat</strong>: Kronk – Maine Coon (Kronk was hexed in Rory's first year at Ilvermorny, and now believes himself to be a dog)</p><p class="western"><strong>Magical Supplies</strong>: Stored within a trunk which usually sits in the bottom of her closet. Filled with potion equipment.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western"><strong>Pairing:</strong> Paul Lahote</p><p class="western"> </p><p> </p>
