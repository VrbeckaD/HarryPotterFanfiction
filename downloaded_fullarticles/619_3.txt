    <p>It has been a few years since the war had been over. Hermione had taken a job at the ministry in the Department of Mysteries specializing in ancient ruins and wards. Hermione has been throwing herself into work, trying to forget about everything. She had not spoken to Harry or Ron in a while, that is why it came as a surprise when her assistant told her that Harry was waiting for her in her office.</p><p>‘’Harry what a surprise, what brings you here?’’ She walks over to him and gives him a hug; it has been too long.</p><p>‘’It has been so long I thought I stop by; you look good Hermione.’’</p><p>‘’Why do I get the feeling you didn’t just step by for pleasantries?’’</p><p>‘’I wanted to invite you to dinner at my house tonight, there are some things I want to ask you.’’</p><p>Hermione had no clue as to what he was talking about, but she doesn’t have any plans tonight.</p><p>‘’Sure, why not, is seven alright? I still have some work that needs to be finished.’’</p><p>‘’That sounds good, I will leave you to it then. I will see you tonight.’’</p><p>Harry walks out of her office and Hermione goes about her day. She leaves the office a little early, that way she has enough time to get ready. From the money she was rewarded after the war she bought a very nice studio apartment in muggle London. She could live the rest of her day’s like royalty without having to work. But her passion to learn never left her, that is why she started to work at the ministry.</p><p>Hermione arrives at Harry’s, he renovated Sirius’s old house and has been living there ever since they finished school. Harry much like Ron went on and became an Auror. She knocks on the door and Kreacher opens it.</p><p>‘’Master is waiting for you in the dining room’’</p><p>‘’Thank you Kreacher, I know my way.’’</p><p>She walks through the corridor towards the dining room but when she walks in something makes her freeze. Harry is sitting in a chair near the fireplace but there next to him on the ground is none other then Draco Malfoy. Harry is reading the daily prophet and simultaneously petting Draco’s head. Hermione notices that he is wearing a very thin silver collar. But the most curious thing about this all is that Draco is supposed to be in Azkaban with all the other supporters of Voldemort. </p><p>‘’Good evening Harry, you didn’t tell me you had another guest.’’<br/>
Harry puts down his paper and Draco as if awakened from his peaceful state of mind turns his head so fast she fears he mid give himself a whiplash. He stares at her with a petrified look, then he looks down at the carpet and she can almost see the blush on his cheeks. Harry stand up from his chair and gives her another hug.</p><p>‘’Sorry I didn’t tell you before, but I was afraid you wouldn’t agree to meet otherwise.’’</p><p>‘’Why did you want to meet then Harry?’’</p><p>‘’Let us take a seat, we’ll discus this further during dinner’’</p><p>Kreacher had prepared the table with all sorts of foods. They take a seat and as before Draco sits down on the floor besides Harry. ‘’Alright now can you please tell me what this is all about? I thought Draco is supposed to be in Azkaban last I checked…’’ Hermione sees Draco stiffen a bit and without saying anything Harry strokes his hair. It seems so natural it unsettles her a bit. </p><p>‘’Well he was but a while ago Kingsley approached me, saying that because of the war by law we were allowed to claim our rewards. I thought he was talking about the money we received, and I told him so. But her was talking about a different reward. I could claim one of the death eaters in Azkaban. The idea was off-putting in the least and I told him he had gone completely bonkers. He gave me some books and papers and told me to think about it.’’</p><p>Harry takes a sip from his wine before continuing. ‘’After reading all that he gave me I gave it a chance, I went back to the ministry and I started the process. I didn’t know how it would go and I didn’t know who I would claim. I went over to Azkaban a few times and Malfoy caught my eye, a few months later and we find ourselves in this situation.’’</p><p>Hermione looks skeptical for a moment ‘’And he just accepted it, I highly doubt that…’’</p><p>‘’We had our struggles but being in Azkaban for so long took its toll on him. It may have taken him some time to get used to the situation, but it is a lot better then that place. There are still some things we have to overcome, but we will get there.’’</p><p>‘’But now the million-galleon question, where do I come in?’’</p><p>‘’Draco, why don’t you take the lead?’’</p><p>Draco looks up at Hermione ‘’I know this is all a shock to you and you certainly don’t ow me anything but… but…’’ ‘’Go ahead Draco, it’s alright.’’ ‘’But I wanted to ask you if you could do the same for my mother as Pot… Harry did for me?’’</p><p>‘’Let me get this straight, not only did you spring this all on me in one night. But above all else you want me to claim your mother, Narcissa Malfoy?? Have you both completely lost you bloody minds?’’ Hermione stands from her place at the table getting ready to leave them, but Harry stands up to.</p><p>‘’Hermione please hear us out? And if you still think us crazy, you can leave, and we will never talk about this again alright?’’ Hermione lets out a huff and sits down again.</p><p>‘’It’s been 5 years and I’m not aloud to visit her. She cannot survive much longer in there Hermione; I can feel it. I know what it is like, I still have nightmares. I don’t know anyone that would be able to help me and then Harry mention you.’’<br/>
‘’And you want my help, help from the filthy mudblood?’’</p><p>‘’I shouldn’t have said that, I – I’m so sorry’’</p><p>‘’Okay, let me think about it and read everything Harry was given by Kingsley. I’ll let you both know by tomorrow. ‘’ Hermione wishes them good night and leaves through the floo.</p><p>XXX</p><p>Hermione took the day of, that way she could place all her focus on the researched that lay ahead of her. She reads for hours upon hours, if she decided that she would claim Narcissa Malfoy that would mean she would take on a slave of sorts. But it is up to her and decide what that would entitle precisely. She had seen the desperate look in Draco’s eyes, she did really feel for him.<br/>
She made her decision; she steps into the floo and goes over to Harry. Upon arriving she saw Harry sitting in the same chair as before. He puts down his paper before looking up. </p><p>‘’I will help you Draco, I will go to Kingsley and tell him I would like to claim my reward. I will claim Narcissa Malfoy’’</p>
