          <div class="userstuff"><p>Draco’s hand froze in mid-air, holding the package. He stared at the card with wide-eyes.</p>
<p>“Everything okay?” Harry asked, but there was no reply. He frowned and leant over to read it. ‘From Mrs Weasley to Draco Malfoy’</p>
<p>Draco put the card down slowly then turned to Harry. “Could this be a misunderstanding?”</p>
<p>Harry laughed. “What you talking about? It’s a Christmas present for you.”</p>
<p>“But- I didn’t- why would they send me a present?”</p>
<p>Harry rolled his eyes. “I don’t know, <em>Malfoy</em>, maybe ‘cause we’re dating?”</p>
<p>Draco glared at him. “Very funny.”</p>
<p>“Open it.”</p>
<p>Unsure, Draco started to unwrap it. He had a pretty good guess what it was, and though he didn’t want to offend the Weasleys or hurt Harry, he knew he couldn’t fake liking some ugly ass jumper-</p>
<p>The wrapping paper came off, and Draco blinked. It was a jumper, indeed, but far from ugly. It was a brilliant deep green colour, with a silver ‘D’ on the front. Harry bumped into his shoulder, grinning.</p>
<p>“I knew you’d like it.”</p>
<p>Draco coughed and folded the jumper. “It’s okay.”</p>
<p>“Ron and I thought a snake with a Santa hat would look great on the back but Mrs Weasley said it’d be too far.”</p>
<p>Draco raised an eyebrow. “Well, never thought I’d say that, but I agree with Mrs Weasley.”</p>
<p>“Still,” Harry reached for his present with a smirk, and Draco had a bad feeling. He pushed the wrapper off and showed the piece of cloth to Draco, pouting “It’s a shame we don’t have matching jumpers.”</p>
<p>Draco nearly went bind. It was a bright red jumper with a golden ‘H’ on the front, and on the back was a huge Gryffindor lion, wearing a Santa hat.</p>
<p>He stared at his now childishly giggling boyfriend and with a straight face said, “You’re not wearing that in my presence.”</p></div>
