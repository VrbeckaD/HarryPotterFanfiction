    <p align="justify">"What are you doing, Luna?" Hermione asked when she saw her friend trying to cast a charm in the hidden corner of the library.<br/>
<br/>
"I'm just trying to learn a new magic spell. The description seemed simple, but it didn't work for me."<br/>
<br/>
Hermione looked at the open book on the table: Useless, tricky, and quirky charms. The open page was full of a series of simple spells, most of which didn't work exactly as you first thought. For example, there was one that made the caster able see through the walls, but it actually did nothing but blow a huge hole in the nearest wall. There were, however, far more harmless, but equally cunning magic spells. Surely Luna tried one of these.<br/>
<br/>
"Which one did you try?" Â Hermione asked.<br/>
<br/>
"Here!" Luna pointed out "The hug charm."<br/>
<br/>
Hermione read the instruction, in which the author clearly said that the spell would cause the caster to be hugged, but it didn't say that it is the spell itself that will do it. Suddenly, she understood what the trick was in this and what was the strange feeling that made her look behind the shelf where Luna was hiding.<br/>
<br/>
"I can help you with that," she said chuckling.<br/>
<br/>
"Will you help me learn it?" Luna's eyes flashed.<br/>
<br/>
"No!" Hermione shouted, then embraced her.</p>
