    <p align="justify">As the golden-yellow sun rises over the tiled temple rooftops in the morning and begins to bathe Rome in its soft, warm light, Remus tilts his face up toward the sky with his hands clasped behind his straightened back while he trails behind his escort along the winding pebbled road beside the river.</p><p align="justify">The water looks extra clear today, and briefly he wonders if his escort will allow him to stop for a swim on their way back to the villa. He will have to be on his best behavior for certain. For now, he follows the fragrant aroma of spices and freshly baked pastries into the forum at the heart of the city.</p><p align="justify">It is still quite early, but the forum is already beginning to buzz with the activity of vendors setting up their tented pop-up stalls while others carefully arrange their goods and wares on tables for the daily market. Here, there is a little bit of everything being sold— vibrant bolts of luxurious silk billowing in the breeze; pretty beads, gemstones, and gold glistening in the sunlight; hens clucking in their cages. Remus takes all of this in, watching the merchants beckon shoppers to their booths with enthusiastic sales pitches, the group of women trying on bracelets, a young servant selecting a cut of lamb from a butcher before slipping it into his basket— all of it having its own part in the hustle and bustle of everyday Roman life.</p><p align="justify">Coming to the marketplace in the mornings is one of the few little indulgences Remus is permitted as a servant, never mind that he must be accompanied on every trip by his master’s slimy councilor, Severus— a man whose sour personality is blatantly reflected on his sallow, hook-nosed face. Nevertheless, Remus attempts to make the best of this time by steadfastly ignoring Severus and pretending as if he is not there breathing down his neck while he samples perfumes and admires the sparkling jewelry.</p><p align="justify">Remus purchases an apple for a snack with his meagre allowance and stumbles upon a merchant selling instruments. He stops to admire these for a moment, and with a quick glance over his shoulder, realizes he has managed to lose Severus in the crowd. He turns, anxious of whatever punishment may await him if he strays too far away from his escort, but the crowd is thick and he is unable to spot him.</p><p align="justify">Across the courtyard, there is a sudden uproar of men hollering at one another. Remus peers through the gathering crowd but can only make out the figures of two dark-haired men shoving one another. One of them lands a punch on the other, eliciting simultaneous gasps from several onlookers, then the crowd surges forward. Someone jostles against Remus, causing him to fall to his hands and knees and drop the apple. He can only watch with a frown as it is kicked away and rolls across the dirty ground, then quickly becomes scooped up by a goat’s hungry mouth— though he is less concerned about the wasted money and more worried about the lashing he may get for returning to the villa with scraped knees and a soiled tunic— it will not reflect favorably on his master.</p><p align="justify">A man cuts through the crowd and kneels beside him there in the square, one hand outstretched as people continue past him toward the ongoing altercation, and Remus, with his wide eyes tilted upward to study the man’s seemingly kind enough face, warily accepts the help. He slips his hand into the man’s much larger one and allows himself to be pulled to his feet.</p><p align="justify">“Thank you, sir,” Remus says, dipping his head in gratitude, feeling quite warm under the gaze of his rescuer. He is a tall, towering man, and rather strikingly handsome with his long, dark hair half pulled back and framing a refined face that still looks a bit rugged due to his unshaven chin. He is dressed in a finely styled toga and red sandals, obviously an aristocrat, and Remus feels a bit at odds standing beside him. In fact, he should not even be talking to this man at all. “Apologies for my clumsiness.”</p><p align="justify">“There is no need to apologize,” the man urges, and gives Remus’s shoulder an amiable squeeze. “Are you all right?”</p><p align="justify">Brushing off his tunic, Remus nods. “Yes, fine. I only lost my food. And my escort, I am afraid.”</p><p align="justify">The man purses his lips and looks to the fruit cart, then leads Remus along with a firm yet gentle hand on the small of his back. He plucks up another apple from the display, then turns and offers it to him with a friendly smile.</p><p align="justify">“I cannot pay for it, sir,” Remus says and shakes his head, but the man only fishes a coin out of his purse and flips it to the merchant with a flick of his thumb, then ushers Remus back out of the crowd with his hand resting again on the small of his back like a large, hot brand.</p><p align="justify">“Consider it a gift,” the man replies, shrugging one shoulder. “A thank you.”</p><p align="justify">“A thank you for what, sir?”</p><p align="justify">“For gracing me with your beauty today.” He says it so simply and so calmly, as if it is common knowledge, that Remus cannot help but blush furiously. He is not used to these kinds of commendations from important men. Despite his master lavishing him with praise, he lacks the gentleness and warmth, not to mention the good looks of this stranger.</p><p align="justify">“Thank you again. You are too kind.”</p><p align="justify">“Your knees.”</p><p align="justify">“Pardon?”</p><p align="justify">“You are bleeding. Here.” He leads Remus to the fountain at the center of the marketplace and with a gentle push, has him sit upon the edge. Remus glances around cautiously while clutching his apple, unsure if he should make a run for it or accept the help, but the man drops to one knee before him and touches the side of Remus’s leg tenderly.</p><p align="justify">Remus flinches at the unfamiliar graze of the man’s rough fingertips on his skin, and he watches him warily as he works a thread of his own toga open and rips two long strips of fabric off with his bare hands. Carefully, he dips the cloth into the fountain’s water and wipes the dirt and rocks from Remus’s knees, cleans the specks of blood from his shins, then wraps each strip around the wounds and ties them securely with a knot.</p><p align="justify">“That will have to do for now,” he says, looking rather satisfied with his handiwork. “What is your name?”</p><p align="justify">“Remus, sir.”</p><p align="justify">“I noticed you admiring the instruments. Are you skilled with any?”</p><p align="justify">“Yes, sir. I sing and play the lyre.”</p><p align="justify">“And how old are you, Remus?”</p><p align="justify">“Seven and ten years,” Remus responds.</p><p align="justify">“Seventeen and not a hair on your chin yet.” The stranger moves his hand to tug at the edge of Remus’s tunic, his thumb sliding delicately over the embroidered border. It’s a subtle detail, something that would normally go unnoticed unless one looked closely, but the understated elegance of it surely tells this man that Remus belongs to someone with enough money and power to not only have his own servant, but to dress him well.</p><p align="justify">“And nor will there ever be, sir,” Remus says, keeping his head down and feeling guilty for not taking more pride in his position. He is lucky, really— most boys his age do not have half of the luxuries he has been afforded. He has a roof over his head, fine clothing, a warm bed, hot meals. He knows he should be grateful; he is certainly privileged, regardless of whether or not this is the life he would have chosen for himself, if he was ever to be given a choice, nor is it the life his mother would have wanted for him before her passing. “My master plans to keep me soft. So that my voice will not deepen further and for… aesthetic purposes.”</p><p align="justify">The man is silent for a moment. There is no misjudging what Remus has said— it is not an uncommon practice, and it is the undeniable truth of his position in his master’s home. Without that protection, he would be an orphan on the streets. </p><p align="justify">“When?”</p><p align="justify">“After my birthday next. In Spring.”</p><p align="justify">“And to whom do you belong?”</p><p align="justify">“I—”</p><p align="justify">“<em> Remus! </em>There you are!”</p><p align="justify">Remus snaps his head up to see Severus rushing toward him through the crowd. One of his normally beady dark eyes is purple and swollen shut, and Remus guesses he was one of the men involved in the altercation across the courtyard.</p><p align="justify">“What happened to you?”</p><p align="justify">“Never mind what happened to me, what is going on here?” He looks to the stranger with an annoyed huff. “<em> You. </em>Why am I not surprised?”</p><p align="justify">“It seems I have found your ward, Severus,” the man says, smirking. “Do not tell me this boy is yours.”</p><p align="justify">“This boy belongs to Emperor Voldemort.”</p><p align="justify">The man seems taken aback for a moment, with his jaw slack and his eyebrows raised, but he promptly schools his features after seeing Severus’s cruel smirk.</p><p align="justify">“Pity. I was just thinking I would like to buy him.”</p><p align="justify">The man’s words cause Remus to jolt upright, and he casts his eyes to look over at him again, admiring the haughty smile on his lips. The idea of leaving the care of the emperor and working for this handsome stranger is enticing. He certainly does not seem the type to be overtly callous to his servants as Voldemort is. Perhaps he would even be kind? Tender? Affectionate? Would he also want to take Remus as a lover? The very thought of it makes him blush.</p><p align="justify">“You will have to take that up with my master, then. Make an appointment. Now, I encourage you to go collect James from the guards,” Severus says, straightening his toga. “He has been arrested for assaulting the emperor’s councilor. Pay them a fair bribe and you can have your idiotic friend back.”</p><p align="justify">Remus watches as the stranger releases what sounds like an irritated yet amused sigh. He stands and turns to face him, and with a slight bow he takes Remus’s right hand, his thumb lightly brushing over the knuckles. “A pleasure to meet you today, Remus. Good day. And have your nurse look over those scrapes, would you?”</p><p align="justify">“Of course. Thank you again, sir.”</p><p align="justify">“Please,” he says, waving a hand in the air. “You may call me Sirius.” He then turns to Severus and plasters another cocky smile onto his face. “I would bid you a good day as well, Severus, but to be quite honest, I absolutely loathe you and would rather see you floating facedown in the Tiber.”</p><p align="justify">Remus knows better than to laugh at the quip or at Severus’s ever reddening face, but it is in that instant Remus immediately adores this man. <em> Sirius, </em> he repeats in his head while he watches the man turn on his heel and walk confidently across the forum, completely ignoring Severus’s inane babblings as he takes Remus’s wrist and yanks him to his feet. <em> Sirius, Sirius, Sirius. </em></p><p align="justify">Biting into the crisp, pink apple, Remus follows Severus through the crowd and out of the marketplace. He glances over his shoulder for one more gander, only to find that Sirius is looking back at him. He raises a hand in a parting gesture, and with a contented grin, Remus waves back at him.</p>
