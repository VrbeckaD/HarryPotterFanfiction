    <p>Draco has always been ghost-like ; in a way. Be it the shockingly white hair, stoney eyes, or perpetually sneering expression, something about him seemed supernatually charged.</p><p>But now, he's even more so, floating rather than walking through the halls he once strode down confidently. 
He looks so similar to a dead man, that he'd put the castle ghosts to shame.</p><p>Perhaps he is a dead man. Life isn't just the simple fact of being alive - it's more than that. Much more. Draco's never lived for the more.</p><p>A hushed voice in passing firmly grabs Draco and drags him out of his own thoughts.</p><p>"Deatheater."</p><p>It's a whispered fact, spoken like an insult. </p><p>The fifth year calling Draco that is akin to Draco barking a "Ravenclaw" back at him. They're both descriptions, just descriptions. </p><p>Words don't have weight behind them. </p><p>Words don't have weight behind them.</p><p>Draco knows all too well how much the truth can hurt, so he'll keep fuelling his forged fantasy- he'd rather loose touch with veracity than confront his demons. </p><p>
  <em>Words don't have weight behind them.</em>
</p><p>The quite literal dark tunnel he'd started to tire from walking down opens up to a burst of light at the end, making for a disgustingly fitting metaphor</p><p>If Draco truly was a ghost, stepping out into the warm sunshine would prove much more difficult. </p><p>If he had to guess, he'd say being in the sun, feeling it's warmth reach right through his bones, touching his soul and igniting a fire within his very core, would be the closest thing to living for<em> more </em>he can imagine.</p><p>It's strange in a way; Draco was raised with having the best of the best, expensive, luxurious spreads of toys and entertainment, and yet, nothing can compare with the joy he feels, just sitting by the lake, staring at the glistening water stare back up at him.</p><p>But this time, when he sits to enjoy the small pleasure, two people stare back at him.</p><p>"Malfoy?" </p><p>"Potter?"</p>
