    <p>Sirius grinned as he and James levitated their beds down the hall. James had figured out a while ago that the 'No students out of bed' rule had a loophole. If you levitated your bed down the halls, then <em>technically </em>you weren't breaking any rules since you weren't out of bed.</p>
<p>"Oi! James," Sirius called as they turned down another hallway. "Where're Moony and Wormtail?"</p>
<p>"Moony didn't want to risk getting in trouble and Wormtail wanted to come with, but he he fell asleep in the common room." James stopped and Sirius looked back at him and stopped as well. Minerva McGonagall was walking down the hallway towards them.</p>
<p>"And just <em>what</em> do you think you're doing?" She asked furiously, stopping in front of them and glaring down at them.</p>
<p>"Why professor," Sirius smiled innocently up at her, "We're just taking a midnight stroll."</p>
<p>"Back to bed. The both of you."</p>
<p>"But professor," James protested, "We <em>are </em>in bed!"</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall shook her head. "You <em>know</em> that's not what that rule means!"</p>
<p>"Let me put it this way. The 'no students out of bed' rule only applies when students are actually <em>out</em> of bed, so <em>technically </em>Sirius and I aren't doing anything wrong!"</p>
<p>Dumbledore rounded the corner just behind Professor McGonagall.</p>
<p>"I see you two have figured out the loophole," Dumbledore smiled at James and Sirius. "Minerva, would you come with me? I have some business to attend to."</p>
<p>"But- but- but the students!" McGonagall spluttered. "Out of bed!"</p>
<p>Dumbledore smiled again. "Well, Minerva, as James so rightly discovered, they are not out of bed. Now come, I must speak with you." He said and turned and walked down the hall. James and Sirius smiled at Professor McGonagall and floated away back down the hall. McGonagall stood there for a second, dumbstruck.</p>
<p>"Those boys never fail to amaze me." She muttered to herself.</p>
