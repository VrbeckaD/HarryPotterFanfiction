    <p>Phoenix Rising<br/>
(Scenes from Harry Potter and X-men Apocalypse)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Fifth year at Hogwarts started with increased tension.  Harry nearly getting expelled over the summer and now nearly everyone at Hogwarts was sneering at the Boy Who Lived because he’d claimed Voldemort had returned, and except for his closest friends, no one believed him.  The new Defense Against The Dark Arts Professor was some Ministry hag sent by Minister Cornelius Fudge to spy on Dumbledore.  The sodding fool thought the Headmaster was after his job, which was utterly laughable.  </p>
<p>Harry was having visions inside his head, and they only got worse as the school year progressed, but it was nothing compared to what his best friend was going through.  Hermione Granger was having visions of her own....which eventually caused her to go to Harry with her concerns.  Her magic had been all over the place lately, and it seemed as if her spells were increasing with power as the year progressed.  It was very disconcerting and eventually Harry and Hermione went to Professor Mcgonagall and shared their concerns.  </p>
<p>The Deputy Headmistress brought her findings directly to Dumbledore, and while the Headmaster was reluctant to believe what Madam Pomfrey’s scans were detecting with Miss Granger’s magic, there was no way to independently verify if his theory about her magic evolving was correct.  Harry in turn, was having odd dreams about strange artifacts.....a necklace with a large S, a diamond tiara looking thing, a cup that had a Badger on it, a ring with a black stone with runic markings on it.....he told his dreams to Hermione, who in turn shared her concerns with the Deputy Headmistress.  As Harry’s dreams progressed, it was Hermione who made the connection that Harry’s mind was somehow linked to the Dark Lord’s, and at the beginning of Christmas break, in the library at Grimmauld Place.....Hermione Granger discovered how the Dark Lord Voldemort had managed to cheat death. </p>
<p>Horcruxes.......sitting with Harry and Sirius in the library.....Hermione shared her discovery.   Sirius called an Order meeting and within a few hours, the group had discovered that one of the horcruxes was within the walls of Grimmauld Place, hidden away by Kreacher.  The elf shared the story of how his Master Regulus had allowed the Dark Lord to take Kreacher to a dark cave and how Kreacher had taken his Master back to that very same cave....how Master Regulus sacrificed himself to retrieve the locket and how he’d bade his loyal house elf to destroy the filthy evil locket.  </p>
<p>With tangible proof, Hermione was able to discern that the other horcruxes were most likely items that belonged to the other Hogwarts Founders....since Tom Riddle would see himself as heir apparent to Salazar Slytherin, he would likely covet other items from the Founders that held significance.  The Lost Diadem of Rowena Ravenclaw, the Cup of Helga Hufflepuff, Tom Riddle’s family ring that Dumbledore remembered him wearing from sixth year on.....one by one the group profiled and plotted and by Christmas, with Kreacher’s help, they had located and retrieved all the horcruxes save one.....Nagini.  </p>
<p>Harry had realized that during the dream he’d had over the summer, when Voldemort had killed the Muggle caretaker at old Riddle Manor, he’d most likely made his snake into a horcrux.....but the shock came when Hermione realized that Harry himself was most likely a horcrux....due to his ability to speak with snakes and the extraordinary power he held for being so young.  When Dumbledore mentioned the Prophecy that Trelawny gave before Harry was born, Hermione guessed correctly that Voldemort would likely send one of his followers.....or perhaps his familiar to retrieve the orb.  So a trap was set for the end of Christmas break, and with the Sword of Gryffindor concealed within his robes, Arthur Weasley decided to take charge guarding the Prophecy.  </p>
<p>Sure enough, late one night Nagini slithered into the Department of Mysteries and attacked Mr. Weasley, but he quickly took the sword and slashed it through the air, slicing off the snakes head.  Dark magic swirled from the snake as it disintegrated, and soon the Aurors were there to take Arthur to St. Mungos, where he was treated for his injuries.  </p>
<p>A few weeks after school resumed, there was a mass breakout of prisoners that were locked away in Azkaban.  Bellatrix Lestrange, Rodolphus and Rabastan Lestrange, Antonin Dolohov, Corban Yaxley....and several others were set free.   The Daily Prophet, along with Minister Fudge blamed the mass breakout on Sirius Black, but most people knew better.  It seemed that in securing his loyal followers release, the only thing Voldemort succeeded in doing was confirm that he well and was truly back.  </p>
<p>Hermione’s magic was growing stronger by the day, and over Easter she was having a hard time regulating her powers.  She was becoming increasingly frustrated and concerned for her well being, so Harry went to Dumbledore and begged him to help his best friend.   Harry, along with Ron and Hermione had started a clandestine defense club in their spare time....teaching anyone who wanted to join how to properly defend themselves against Dark magic.  When they were caught by Umbridge and the Inquisitorial Squad a few weeks after Easter, Dumbledore had to vanish from Hogwarts before Minister Fudge could have him arrested.  </p>
<p>During detention, Umbridge had all the members of the DA write lines with a blood quill, the Dark Magic scarring their hands painfully.  In the secrecy of Gryffindor tower, Hermione was able to heal the red scars with her magic.  Harry was increasingly astonished by his best friend’s powers, and promised her that together, they’d figure out exactly what was going on.  </p>
<p>OWLS came soon after, and every fifth year student was studying voraciously for their exams.  On the day of the final Defense exam, loud explosions could be heard throughout the hallways of Hogwarts, and in a flash of sparks and fire, George and Fred Weasley lit up the Great Hall with an impressive demonstration of fireworks courtesy of their new joke shop, Weasley Wizarding Wheezes.  Outside cheering his friends on, Harry was taken down by a strong vision of Voldemort holding Sirius in the Hall of Prophecy......the vision of Sirius being tortured scared Harry into action.  Trying to access Umbridge’s Floo to contact his godfather, Harry realized too late that he’d walked into a trap.  Umbridge and the Inquisitorial squad captured them, and it was only by some sly cunning from one singular brilliant witch and a coded message to Professor Snape, that they’d managed to escape Hogwarts and fly to London on the back of Thestrals.  </p>
<p>Once they’d reached the Ministry, Harry with Hermione, Ron, Ginny, Neville and Luna Lovegood managed to find their way to the Hall of Prophecy.  When Harry reached the aisle where his Prophecy was located, he looked for Sirius, but his godfather was no where to be found.  Suddenly, the six students saw shadows converging on them, men with cloaks and silver masks had surrounded them.  Grabbing the Prophecy off the shelf Harry moved quickly to his friends. </p>
<p>Harry moved to the forefront and spoke to the lead masked man.  “Where’s Sirius?”</p>
<p>“You know, you really should learn to tell the difference between dreams and.....reality.”  Lucius Malfoy waved his wand and his death eater mask disappeared, revealing his face.  “You saw only what the Dark Lord wanted you to see.  Now hand me the Prophecy.”</p>
<p>“You do anything to us, I’ll break it.”  Harry stated firmly. </p>
<p>Behind Lucius Malfoy a cackling laugh could be heard reverberating through the Hall.  “He knows how to play.....itty, bitty, baby.....Potter.”   Bellatrix Lestrange snarled at the Boy Who Lived. </p><p>Slowly Neville moved forward.  “Bellatrix Lestrange....” Neville said emotionally.  </p>
<p>“Neville Longbottom is it?  How’s mum and dad?”  Bellatrix taunted while Lucius just rolled his eyes. </p>
<p>“Better now that they’re to be avenged.”  Neville lifted his wand and pointed it directly at Bellatrix, causing the witch in question to raise her wand in response. </p>
<p>“Let’s everybody just calm down, shall we?  All we want is the Prophecy.”  Lucius said trying to diffuse the situation.</p>
<p>“Why did Voldemort need me to come and get this?”  Harry sneered. </p>
<p>“You dare speak his name?”  Bellatrix yelled enraged.  “You filthy half-blood!”  </p>
<p>Lucius held Bellatrix back.  “It’s alright, he’s just a curious lad, aren’t you?”  Lucius admonished.  “Prophecies can only be retrieved by those about whom they are made.  Which is lucky for you, really,”  The six friends moved into a circle as the Death Eaters moved in closer to their position.  “Haven’t you always wondered what was the reason for the connection between you and the Dark Lord, hmmm?  Why he was unable to kill you when you were just...an infant?  Don’t you want to know the secret....of your scar?  All the answers are there, Potter....in your hand.  All you have to do is give it to me, and I can show you everything.”</p>
<p>“I’ve waited fourteen years.”  Harry started. </p>
<p>“I know.”  Lucius offered with feigned sympathy.</p>
<p>“I guess I can wait a little longer.....now!  Stupefy!”  Harry yelled as his friends all yelled out stupefy, hitting their targets.  </p>
<p>The six friends ran through the Hall of Prophecy away from the Death Eaters, but they got separated.  Hermione was pinned down by Dolohov, who had her cornered....before he could get his spell off, Hermione silenced him but she couldn’t stop the streak of purple flame as it headed her way and hit her in the chest.  She squeaked an “oh” before she fell to the floor in pain, Dolohov leaving her for dead.  </p>
<p>Elsewhere in the Department of Mysteries, Harry found his way to the death chamber and was stopped by Lucius Malfoy and his cohorts.  Lucius held out his hand and snarled, “Give me the Prophecy now....or watch your friends....die.”</p>
<p>Harry looked around and saw Neville being held by Bellatrix and Ginny, bleeding and being gripped tightly by Rookwood.  Ron was on the ground and Luna was lying next to him, with one of the Lestrange brothers pointing a wand directly at her and sneering.  </p>
<p>Harry held out his hand and placed the Prophecy in the outstretched hand of Lucius Malfoy, who gripped onto it in triumph.  Suddenly a flash of light found Sirius Black standing behind Malfoy...... “Get away from my godson.”   Sirius reeled back and punched Lucius in the face, knocking the blonde man down and shattering the Prophecy for good measure as it fell out of Malfoy’s hand and broke on the floor.  </p>
<p>Soon, more bright lights filtered into the room as Nymphadora Tonks, Remus Lupin, Alastor Moody and Kingsley Shacklebolt entered the Death Chamber and the battle broke out in full.  Luna and Ginny took cover with Neville and Ron as they watched Sirius grab Harry and crouch down behind the stone wall guarding the veil. </p>
<p>“Now listen to me, I want you to take the others and get out of here.”  Sirius instructs Harry. </p>
<p>“What?  No I’m staying with you.”</p>
<p>“You’ve done beautifully, now let me take it from here.”</p>
<p>As Sirius finished his comment, Lucius appeared with Dolohov directly behind him.  Harry and Sirius dueled the two Death Eaters and Sirius managed to defeat Dolohov while Harry shouted out ‘expelliarmus’, disarming Lucius.  </p>
<p>“Well done, James.”  Sirius bellowed as he knocked out Malfoy quickly, not watching as Bellatrix caught him unaware as she yelled out “Avada Kedavra.”  </p><p>Harry watched in horror, as Sirius fell through the veil, and he screamed in rage as Remus tried to hold him back, but Harry finally managed to pull away and raced out of the Death Chamber after Bellatrix.  When he caught up with her, he yelled out ‘Crucio’ and watched as the mad witch fell to the ground crying out in pain.  Harry reached her and pointed his wand at Bellatrix, but soon the Dark Lord whispered in Harry’s head, taunting Harry, as Bellatrix whimpered in fear. </p>
<p>“You’ve got to mean it, Harry.   She killed him, she deserves it.   You know the spell Harry.”</p>
<p>Suddenly Voldemort appeared next to Harry and Bellatrix started to cackle in glee.  Harry, shaking his head clear, moved to disarm the Dark Lord, but Voldemort waved his hand and Harry’s wand fell to the ground.  </p>
<p>“So weak.....”</p>
<p>At that moment, Dumbledore appeared out of the floo in a swirl of green flames.  “It was foolish for you to come here tonight, Tom.  The Aurors are on their way.”</p>
<p>“By which time I shall be gone, and you......shall be dead.”</p>
<p>Both Voldemort and Dumbledore flashed their wands in a swirling pattern causing both Harry and Bellatrix to be pushed violently out of the path of their duel.  Sparks erupted and magic crackled like energy into the air, leaving both Bellatrix and Harry stunned, watching the duel in awe.  Both wizards were evenly matched and it seemed as if neither one was able to get the upper hand, until Voldemort vanished in a cloud of dust.  Soon after, Harry started to flinch in pain and writhe on the ground, causing Bellatrix to once again, cackle in glee.  </p>
<p>The fellow Order members came out of the Death Chamber and into the Ministry’s Atrium with the Death Eaters, magically bound and silenced.  The floo’s started to come to life as the Minister of Magic and several Aurors entered the atrium, astonished at the scene.  Bellatrix was quickly bound and silenced as all present watched the boy who lived writhe on the floor.....not understanding what was happening. </p>
<p>Dumbledore knelt next to Harry and whispered words of comfort, while Harry struggled with the Dark Lord, who had invaded his body and mind.  </p>
<p>“It’s over Harry, you’re finished, you’re mine now.”  Voldemort taunted. </p>
<p>Harry struggling, said aloud on a gasp.   “You....will never win.”</p>
<p>“And why is that?”</p>
<p>“Because you’re alone.....and I.....am..........not.”</p>
<p>As soon as Harry finished those words, a portal opened in the atrium to the astonishment of all who were there.  More astonishing was whom exactly was powerful enough to break through the Ministry wards like butter.  Hermione walked through the portal, eyes glowing like lightening and her aura radiating a blinding power that was felt by all who were standing there.  Dolohov squirmed against his bonds, but Remus grabbed onto the Russian tightly and snarled.  </p>
<p>As soon as Hermione cleared the portal, she stood there.....dressed in black dragonhide that had been magically conjured to cover her.  Inside Harry’s mind, Hermione appeared and stared down Voldemort.  </p>
<p>“Let....go......unleash your power Mi.......no fear.”  Whispered Harry both in his mind and in the atrium. </p>
<p>Hermione looked over at Dumbledore, then took in the startled looks of the witches and wizards before her and breathed out a heavy sigh.  Moving her hands out, her magic glowed and encased both herself, Harry and Dumbledore as everyone gasped in astonishment at the display of pure power.  Once the barrier was placed.......Hermione’s eyes glowed white and she levitated above her friend....and as her power swelled, additional smaller portals opened in the air between herself and Harry....showing four items floating in the ether.   A locket, a cup, a tiara and a ring.  </p>
<p>Harry looked up and flinched in pain trying to hold off Voldemort and screamed loudly....... “unleash your power!   Let go Mi!  Mi let go!”</p>
<p>Hermione Granger, sixteen-year-old Gryffindor witch, pulled her arms outward from her body with a high-pitched scream.....a Phoenix cry, and her aura exploded outward into raw elemental flames, the force of which....even with the barrier, could be felt within the entire atrium.  The pressure and power was tangible, and those present couldn’t take their eyes away from the display of raw, elemental magic.  </p>
<p>Inside Harry’s mind, Voldemort screamed at the force of the witch’s magic as Harry’s body arched off the ground...his back bowed at an impossible angle....then suddenly, Voldemort was thrust from Harry’s body and his body pulled into the air.....his rage palpable as he screamed in horror, watching his remaining horcruxes being destroyed to ash by the elemental power of the young witch.  </p>
<p>Harry’s body slumped, horcrux destroyed, and Dumbledore encased them into a protective bubble.......shielding them both from the pressurized heat emanating within the magical enclosure. </p>
<p>Voldemort, enraged and vengeful, started firing off hexes and curses, one more powerful than the next at the young witch, but her aura could not be breached.  In a display of his own heady power, Voldemort pointed his wand and a steady stream of magic was unleashed.....the Dark Lord desperate to break the hold the young witch had on him.....his body suspended mid-air.</p>
<p>When he’d realized he couldn’t break away from the force of the witch’s power, Voldemort enclosed his own protective barrier around his body, trying to shield himself and possibly apparate away.  Seeing this, Remus mumbled, “He’s getting away.”</p>
<p>Dolohov chuckled and Bellatrix cackled madly, as they watched their master’s attempt to escape.  What none there anticipated, was the pressure increasing within the room, many gasping as the pull of magic became almost too much to bear.  Hermione’s eyes whitened again, and her core flashed white as streaks of lightening attacked Voldemort’s shield, bringing it down instantly, her Phoenix cry echoing through the halls of the Ministry....as Voldemort’s wand burned to ash.</p>
<p>Dumbledore nodded once, holding Harry, who was still unconscious in his arms.  “All is revealed.”</p>
<p>The Phoenix cry was heard again, as Hermione’s aura expanded in power......twice as large as before.  Voldemort’s screams could be heard, as his corporeal body turned to ash being bombarded by the elemental fire of the Phoenix.  </p>
<p>When the Dark Lord was completely vanquished and the battle won, Hermione’s power began to fade until she was standing there, elevated.....a large sigh emanating from her mouth.  Appearance changed, Hermione’s hair was now a long auburn red and her eyes were a piercing blue.  Lowering herself down to the ground, she instantly vanished the barrier surrounding Harry and Dumbledore as everyone present watched with expressions that ranged from fury, fear, awe and wonder.  </p>
<p>“Harry.”  Hermione whispered, gently touching her best friend’s face.  </p>
<p>“Miss Granger,” Dumbledore nodded, “that was most impressive, I take it your magic is no longer unstable.”</p>
<p>“No sir.”  Hermione sighed, looking up at all the faces that were watching the scene closely.  Minister Fudge took that moment to come forward and assert himself.  </p>
<p>“Dumbledore, what is the meaning of this?”</p>
<p>“Perhaps we might table this discussion for a more appropriate time Cornelius.”</p>
<p>Fudge’s face started to turn red.  “I don’t think you have the right to make that call, Dumbledore.  And perhaps you might explain Miss Granger’s sudden display of power?”</p>
<p>Hermione rolled her eyes, and Harry...who was now fully awake...smiled softly at his friend.  Helping Harry to his feet, Hermione took a step back with her best friend in tow.  “Perhaps it might be best to worry about getting the Death Eaters back in Azkaban....where they belong.”  Hermione snarled, looking over at Dolohov venomously.  </p>
<p>Bellatrix, in a fit of anger, managed at that precise moment to escape her bonds and grabbed for her wand....pointing it directly at Hermione and Harry.  But before she could finish shouting Avada Kedavra.....Hermione’s hand swept out and in a burst of flame, the former deranged Death Eater, right hand to Voldemort, was instantly turned to ash.  </p>
<p>Fudge looked at the young witch apoplectically and made a motion for the Aurors to come and take her, but Hermione flexed her hand and froze everyone in the room.  Looking at the Minister, she snarled hatefully.  “This is all your fault, you pathetic idiotic man.  You’ve allowed Lucius Malfoy to manipulate you, allowed Delores Umbridge to torture students at Hogwarts.....when I’m done with you, you’ll be lucky not to end up in Azkaban yourself.”  Hermione held Harry close to her body, and in a flash of white heat.....they were gone.</p>
<p>The Minister stood there dumbfounded as Dumbledore and the members of the Order of the Phoenix smirked in glee at the Minister of Magic being firmly reprimanded by a sixteen-year-old witch.  Then Dumbledore cleared his throat while Cornelius flushed angrily and waved the Aurors forward.  Dolohov, Yaxley, Rookwood, both Lestrange brothers were petrified and their wands taken.  Lucius Malfoy stood there in the atrium, unapologetically, as he sneered at the Minister.  Cornelius looked at the blonde man angrily, until Dumbledore whispered something into the man’s ear.  The Minister looked over at the former Headmaster of Hogwarts and nodded reluctantly.  Dumbledore then smiled widely and walked over to each of the captured Death Eaters....murmuring a spell underneath his breath.  When he was done, the Aurors took those who had escaped Azkaban back to their rightful home.  </p>
<p>Dumbledore then approached Lucius Malfoy and smirked at the blonde man.  “It would seem Mr. Malfoy, that we have a bit of a problem.  You were caught red-handed as it were, attacking children and openly engaging in Death Eater activities.  As such, it is doubtful that even with your considerable influence, you’d be able to weasel your way out of a stay in Azkaban.”  The blond man said nothing, nor gave any of what he was thinking away.  “So, I have a proposition if you will.”  At this Lucius Malfoy’s countenance changed from stoic to slightly wary.  </p>
<p>“And just what sort of compromise did you have in mind, Dumbledore?”  Lucius sneered haughtily.</p>
<p>“Well, one of two options really.  I can either remove your memories of tonight and you return home to your wife, or.....you can agree to take an unbreakable vow to not reveal any of what you’ve seen here this evening.”</p>
<p>Lucius’ eyes raised in interest.  “I take it you didn’t give my brethren in arms the choice?”</p>
<p>Dumbledore smiled genuinely.  “I’m afraid not.  All of them have been returned to Azkaban and there they will stay.  You will have no worry that word might get out to their family members of your willingness to cooperate.  I assume there are no other active Death Eaters we need to worry about?”</p>
<p>Lucius looked at the old codger with something akin to hatred mingled with respect.  “Thoros Nott and Walden McNair as well as Travers, Goyle and Crabbe Sr. are active followers, although none were tasked with attending here this evening.  If you were to leave them alone, I would be willing to cooperate.”</p>
<p>Dumbledore nodded.  “You have our word, isn’t that right Cornelius?”  Dumbledore looked to the man who was staring at both him and the Malfoy Lord with open dislike.  He went to say something, but heard a voice clearing their throat behind him.  </p>
<p>“You might want to listen to Dumbledore, Minister.”</p>
<p>Cornelius turned around, his eyes widening at the newest member of the party.  “Professor Snape, what are you doing here.”</p>
<p>Severus smirked and gave both Dumbledore and Lucius a quick nod.  “I’m afraid it would be in everyone’s best interest to bring these unfortunate incidents to a swift resolution.  I’m not sure if you are aware as of yet,” Severus’ smirk widened a bit, “but Delores Umbridge....your Ministry plant at Hogwarts, had been administering Veritaserum to the students as well as utilizing an illegal blood quill as part of her detention practices.  Unfortunately for Miss Umbridge, she’s had a run in with the centaurs and no one can seem to locate her currently.”</p>
<p>Cornelius’ eyes widened comically and he blustered out angrily.  “And how in Merlin’s name, did Delores end up with a herd of centaurs?”</p>
<p>“Apparently she was planning on using the cruciatis curse on Mr. Potter, but Miss Granger intervened.  I have it on good authority she led Delores to believe that Dumbledore had some kind of secret weapon hidden within the Forbidden Forest.  She and Mr. Potter, led Umbridge to the forest where the centaurs were located.  Delores attacked Ronan, one of the herd members, just as Miss Granger anticipated she would.  I’m afraid they didn’t take to it kindly and are now calling for war.”</p>
<p>Dumbledore and Lucius smirked together, causing Snape to roll his eyes in disgust.  Fudge just looked like he’d been stupified.  Looking back at Dumbledore, Fudge sighed out in irritation.  “It would seem that perhaps you might need to take up your old post again, Dumbledore.”  Dumbledore to his credit didn’t say anything, but his eyes were twinkling like mad.  </p>
<p>Lucius considered all the evidence before him.  He was unhappy with the turn of events, but understood that Dumbledore was extending an olive branch.  The Malfoy family was powerful, and as such there was a good chance Lucius could worm his way out of Azkaban, but claiming the imperius twice would do him no favors within certain Pureblood circles....and he didn’t want to be branded a blood traitor.  His sister-in-law was gone.....not too distressing, but Narcissa would be heartbroken.  It was regrettable, but not enough to seek vengeance on her behalf.  He did have one question however.</p>
<p>“I just have one question before I decide on which path to choose, Dumbledore.”  At Dumbledore’s nod, Lucius continued, “How is it possible that Miss Granger is a Sorceress?  She has no magical lineage as far as I’m aware.”</p>
<p>Dumbledore smirked widely and steepled his fingers, before he nodded to Severus, who cast a muffliato over himself and the Malfoy Lord.  “Miss Granger was given to her Muggle parents as a babe.  Her Muggle mother is a squib, and her magical family left Miss Granger with them when they went into hiding during the first reign of Voldemort.”</p>
<p>Lucius visibly flinched at the use of the Dark Lord’s name.  “And her parents?”</p>
<p>Dumbledore looked at Lucius over the rim of his glasses.  “Marlene McKinnon and Fabian Prewett.”</p>
<p>Lucius nodded once, considering the new information.  The girl was a Pureblood and a member of the Sacred 28.  A powerful member....he smirked inwardly and nodded once to Dumbledore.  “I will choose to take the unbreakable vow.  I suspect Miss Granger is as of yet, unaware of her true lineage.”</p>
<p>Dumbledore nodded.  “She suspects and due to her obvious change in appearance will understand sooner rather than later, she is remarkably bright.  It will be shared with her over the summer.  Muriel Prewett, as the head of the family, was aware that Fabian had sired an heir.....but her loyalty to me and the Order....well, she was encouraged to keep it confidential until we could discern what happened to the child.”</p>
<p>“Very well.”   Lucius nodded at his friend who bowed his head in turn.  “Severus will be the bonder and you will let me know when Miss Granger is aware of her heritage.”</p>
<p>Severus glared at his oldest friend.  “Already plotting Lucius?”</p>
<p>Lucius smirked.  “It would seem that fate has smiled on the Malfoy family this day.  You have always been aware Severus, that my support of the Dark Lord was more at my Father’s insistence.  Now that Abraxas is dead, as well as his master....there is no longer any reason for myself nor my family to feel threatened.  I have one other request however.”</p>
<p>Dumbledore looked over at the blonde with amusement radiating from his eyes.  “I am not surprised Lucius.  What is it?”</p>
<p>Looking over at Fudge, Lucius grimaced.  “Fudge needs to be replaced as Minister.  The man is far too easy to manipulate and I’m unsure how one might go about securing his allegiance after this debacle.  Miss Granger’s safety as well as her family would be compromised if Fudge were to stay in power.”</p>
<p>“I’m surprised you care at all for Miss Granger’s well being, Lucius.”  Severus dead-panned. </p>
<p>“I’m just being practical old friend, for the greater good and all that.”  Lucius stated in that bored tone of his, that Severus knew was a front.  Lucius wasn’t a stupid man......far from it and he’d find someway to maneuver his son and Miss Granger together.  The thought made Severus groan inwardly.  </p>
<p>Dumbledore nodded once and held out his right hand, which Lucius clasped with his right one and Severus performed the bonding.  </p>
<p>“Do you Lucius Abraxas Malfoy swear on your magic, not to reveal what has transpired here this evening.”</p>
<p>“I do.”  Lucius intoned back.  </p>
<p>“And do you swear on you magic not to reveal Miss Granger’s true heritage, powers or actions that have been taken here this night in defense of her friends.”</p>
<p>“I do.”  Lucius smirked.  </p>
<p>“And do you swear on you magic, not to reveal any of the actions carried out this night when it becomes knowledge that Miss Granger is in fact a Prewett heir.”</p>
<p>Lucius’ smirk was gone, his eyes narrowed at his friend, but he nodded again.  “I do.”</p>
<p>“And do you swear on your magic, that you or any member of your family, will not seek out in retaliation against any of those who have fought here this night.  That you will protect Miss Granger-Prewett with your magic and your life.”</p>
<p>Lucius smirked openly at his friend, who knew him too well sometimes.  “I do.”</p>
<p>At that, the magic swelled and corded around both Dumbledore’s and Lucius’ wrists before disappearing.  When the vow was done, Lucius took a step back and bowed.  “Gentleman, if it is all the same, I’d like to return home to my wife.  I’m sure I can count on your discretion, as to making sure that my participation in tonight’s festivities is a moot point.”</p>
<p>“Most assuredly.”  Dumbledore nodded once and watched as the Malfoy Lord floo’d back to his Manor.  Looking over at Severus, who simply sighed, Dumbledore hoped that he’d made the right decision in letting the elder Malfoy go.  Things were going to change shortly and Dumbledore had no doubt that once Hermione Granger’s heritage and powers were widely known, every wizard in the Wizarding world would be vying for the witch’s hand.  At least with Lucius Malfoy, her safety would be assured....he’d just made sure of it.</p>
