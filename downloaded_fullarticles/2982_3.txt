</p><p align="justify"><em>Dance, dance, little bird. My arms are gladly opened for you.</em> »</p><p align="justify">This little song, Ginny Weasley could not stop herself from humming it. Did she know where it came from? Of course. Did she turn red only at the thought of its lyrics coming out so loud? Oh, yes. Each time, she begged her brain to forget. Each time, the melody found its way back to her. It remained there during shower time, at breakfast, during Monday's Potions class as well as Transfiguration on Wednesday. At night, before retiring in the arms of Morpheus, Ginny would always fall into the same memory pieces…</p><p>Birds spinning around this young woman with bright hair.</p><p>Leaves tickling her nose, those from the sapling behind which Ginny was hidden to enjoy the show.</p><p>This feeling, like rising from ashes after years of darkness.</p><p>The sudden arrival of the butterflies. Shocking.</p><p>And there it was, Luna Lovegood's laughter, sounding so outstandingly well-balanced to her ears.</p><p align="justify">« <em>She is there, finally.<em></em></em></p><p>
