    <p>There are a lot of questions about what happens when you die. Do you go to heaven? Hell? Are you reincarnated instead into flowers and dogs and new human beings? Do you just cease to exist?</p><p> </p><p>There are also lots of ideas and suppositions of alternate realities and universes. Is that every time you make a choice the present reality splits off? Is time truly linear, or does it loop back on itself? Can rifts in the space-time continuum truly occur?</p><p> </p><p>Lots of heavy questions, some that we may never really know the answers to. In this instance, in this reality, time, death and one’s sense of self are all mixed up. For our entertainment, of course.</p><p> </p><p>In some timelines, Petunia Dursley has awful aim with a frying pan. In this reality, her aim is true.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Nurse Williams watched as her patient’s face became more mobile, eyebrows scrunching together and nose wrinkling as they began to wake. Her patient looked so young, lying there on the hospital bed.</p><p> </p><p>“Whu…what happened?” The voice was raspy and somewhat childish. Understandable, as the boy <em>was</em> a child, and had just woken up after being unconscious for a day.</p><p> </p><p>“Hello Mr. Potter, I am Nurse Williams. You are at Guy’s Hospital in London. Do you remember what happened to you?” As she spoke, she checked his chart again and then the machines beeping beside his bed. Everything looked fine, though she moved to dim the lights when she saw him wince and squint.</p><p> </p><p>“I…” he trailed off as he settled his gaze on his knees, gripping the covers as she raised the bed and helped position the pillows behind him so he could sit comfortably. “…who is that? What happened?”</p><p> </p><p>Nurse Williams traded a glance with the mild-looking man who was sitting in an uncomfortable looking chair, out of the way of the examination that was occurring.</p><p> </p><p>“Mr. Potter, I will let Mr. Barry explain while I go and get your doctor. Everything will be fine.” And with that Nurse Williams beat a hasty retreat. The poor dear, having his life flipped around in such a way!</p><p> </p><p>Back in the hospital room, Mr. Barry coughed and engaged in a staring contest with the small boy on the bed. After what seemed like an age, but was really a few seconds, Mr. Barry rose from his chair and came to stand by Mr. Potter. Mr. Barry was an average looking man, with brown eyes and hair and faint lines around his eyes and thin lips. He wore a grey suit with a yellow collared shirt underneath and carried a brown briefcase, of which he had left under the chair.</p><p> </p><p>“Mr. Potter, my name is Mr. Barry. I will explain what has led us to this point and then I will try my best to answer any questions you may have. Before we begin, I will say that I am sorry that things have gotten to this point and that I will try my best to help you and I will be keeping your welfare in mind.” Mr. Barry waited for Harry to acknowledge his words, receiving for his efforts only a bewildered look from the young boy.</p><p> </p><p>“Well, yesterday in the afternoon you were transported to this hospital after receiving a blow to the head from a frying pan wielded by your Aunt. A neighbour happened to witness the incident and called 999. The ambulance and the police arrived at the same time, and your Aunt was taken into custody while you were taken to the hospital. After questioning your Aunt, your cousin and your neighbour, and taking into consideration your state of being, the family court has appointed me as your guardian for the interim. Your uncle would have been considered, but when he was told about what had occurred…well, his reaction was unseemly, and it was decided that it was better that he not have any ability to make decisions on the behalf of your welfare.”</p><p> </p><p>At this point in his monologue, Mr. Barry checked to see if the boy was following along. The child looked slightly overwhelmed with the information but managed to tilt his head slightly at the pause. Taking it to mean that he should go on, and not wanting the young boy to move his head too much, Mr. Barry with a small nod continued explaining what had occurred to his young charge.</p><p> </p><p>“You were unconscious from the time the ambulance came till today. The doctor has told me that they have given you several tests and concluded that you have a mild concussion, and luckily no internal bleeding, but you probably can feel that bump on your forehead, it’s a bit bruised. We’ll let the doctor examine you, but hopefully, you will just need some rest to get better.”</p><p> </p><p>Mr. Barry stopped speaking then, and the room became silent once more. His young charge seemed to be thinking over Mr. Barry’s words, his hands sporadically smoothing out the blankets laid over his knees. Finally, he looked up at his temporary guardian, a tight look caused by pain or the concern of the unknown settled on his skinny face.</p><p> </p><p>“Will I have to go back to Aunt Petunia after all of this?” His voice was quiet, a slight anxiousness revealed in the wavering of his voice when saying his Aunt’s name.</p><p> </p><p>Before Mr. Barry could answer, a knock was heard on the door. The door opened soon afterwards and a doctor stepped through the door, a clipboard his hands and a harried look on his face.</p><p> </p><p>“Sorry for taking so long, Mr. Potter was it? I am Doctor Bradford. I just want to know, considering the situation, if you would like Mr. Barry here as I examine you, or if you would like for me to tell him your results afterwards?”</p><p> </p><p>Mr. Potter looked away from Mr. Barry and shrugged his shoulders. “Err…you can tell him afterwards, I guess.”</p><p> </p><p>Mr. Barry gathered his suitcase from under the chair. “That’s quite alright, I will be just outside working on these forms here. We will talk later after you get some rest, and when I have more information for you, if that is alright with you Mr. Potter?”</p><p> </p><p>“Alright, I have nowhere else to be anyways.”</p><p> </p><p>Mr. Barry smiled at the small amount of personality shown with that answer and moved towards the door. Just before he moved out of sight, he made sure to make eye contact with the boy.</p><p> </p><p>“We will do our best for you Mr. Potter, do not worry.”</p><p> </p><p>Mr. Potter managed a small smile of his own at the reassurance and turned his head to listen to the doctor as Mr. Barry closed the door behind him.</p><p> </p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>Harry Potter was finally left alone in his room. Dr. Bradford’s examination had been quick. He had been worried when Harry had stayed unconscious for so long for no discernible reason, but there had been no internal bleeding and Harry’s skull wasn’t cracked. Dr. Bradford wanted to do a few more tests just to make sure everything was okay, but he believed that Harry was on the mend and only had a mild concussion. The hospital would keep Harry overnight, run the tests in the morning, and then if everything checked out well Harry would be left in the care of Mr. Barry.</p><p> </p><p>Harry sighed and shifted on the hospital bed, trying to get more comfortable. He was honestly confused. He almost couldn’t believe that Aunt Petunia’s aim had improved so much that she had been able to hit him. He knew he had been taking a risk provoking Dudley, but he didn’t think it would lead to landing himself in the hospital, and Petunia at the police station! What would the neighbours say? She must have taken a leave of her senses to try to hit him in such a public way. The Dursley’s would be the highlight of the gossip reel for the neighbours for days!</p><p> </p><p>Knowing that someone had witnessed his Aunt’s attack, he knew that Aunt Petunia couldn’t really hide her actions in this particular case. Yes, the neighbourhood may believe that he was just a hoodlum, but normal people didn’t go around hitting their nephews with heavy frying pans, especially nephews who were just shy of their birthday…<em>'Mr. Mason and his family would have heard what happened by now; I guess Uncle Vernon is not getting that deal'…</em>and with how his family reacted to his presence usually, he understood somewhat that the police would probably suspect that his safety wouldn’t be assured if he went back to the house on Privet Drive.</p><p> </p><p>All of that was understandable and explainable, although having been unconscious on his birthday sucked, obviously.</p><p> </p><p>What wasn’t explainable, however, was the man named Jon taking residence in his head.</p>
