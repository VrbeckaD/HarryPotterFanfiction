    <p>Walburga and Orion Black had a reputation, as did most of the wizarding families. Some known for valiant bravery, some for perseverance and hard work, some for an unmistakable need to discover and expand their knowledge. The Blacks, likewise, had a reputation, a more sinister one, yes, but a reputation nonetheless. For years they and their associates were simply regarded as the ‘Dark Families’ — a title which extended to the likes of the Averys, the Malfoys, The Lestranges and so on. It wasn’t until the second wizarding war broke out that they were labelled as violent and evil, sure, after the rise of Grindlewald the wizarding community knew where their loyalties lay, and it was most certainly not with the muggles and muggleborns, but they were never regarded with such malice and hatred until they were forced to act upon their prejudices during the reign of Lord Voldemort. Subsequently, prior to this reign, their reputation was not one of bigotry and animosity, but one of established etiquette and proper demeanour. </p><p>It was never difficult to spot a member of a ‘Dark Family’ between the forties and eighties, just look for the dark, expensive, and embellished clothing, emphasised by the straight backs and perfect posture. When they spoke, a string of old-fashioned phrases accompanied by an unwavering, perfect pronunciation would slide out and curl around the thoughts of their avid listener, the words cycling in the addressee’s mind, leaving them with a sense of unease and diffidence about their own character. </p><p>The ‘Dark Families’ often discomforted people, if not intimidated them, for their association with the dark arts was not only implied but heavily pronounced in their general manor. But, their morality in magic aside, the way they composed themselves caused others to often shiver at the thought; their savage natures concealed by posh accents and fancy words, alongside perfectly tailored clothing with detailed markings was an awful thought to yield. Staring into the eyes and hearing the voices of these pure bloods, who have known nothing but elegance the entirety of their intoxicating lives, is quite a frightening concept for the beholder. Inadequacy would be inspired in the average wizard simply by their evident wealth, but the addition of the knowledge that they behold the secrets to more dark magic than the ministry could ever wish to control is a terror-invoking assessment, which would consequently leave many borderline distressed in their mere presence. </p><p>It was quite a reputation, one not easy to replicate without the bloodline, and one certainly not easy to grow out of with the bloodline. </p><p>But every family has one black sheep, one who embodies all of the traits lost in the progression of formality over the years, and combines them all into their very own character. A character which lacks all of the features shared by the rest of the flock. A character which would never be thought to be associated with the rest of the flock. A character which is rejected by the rest of the flock and rejects them in return.<br/>
In the case of the Blacks, this black sheep was the son, the first son that is, of Orion and Walburga Black. Except, there was one small divergence of the normality in this trend of one bad egg with this son, the divergence being that this bad egg managed to inspire some others from the same batch to turn rotten too.</p>
