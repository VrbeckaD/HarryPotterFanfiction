          <div class="userstuff"><p>Our story starts in Albus and Scorpius Potter's house, Scorpius is talking to Albus about his drawing skills.</p><p>Scorpius told him, "You could do well if you took a class or two in wizard art."</p><p>Albus said, "I prefer muggle art, it's more interesting to draw an animate object in an inanimate way."</p><p>Scorpius smiled. "You're a talented artist, Al. I say follow your dreams."</p><p>Albus responded, "Drawing is just a hobby. My dreams revolve around you and our beautiful daughter Lyra."</p><p>Scorpius stated, "Don't put your dreams on hold for us."</p><p>Albus took his hand and reassured him, "I want nothing more in life than you two, Scorpy."</p><p>Scorpius grinned. "Well, it's too bad that I bought you an easel then. Guess I'll have to return it."</p><p>Albus gasped. "You bought me an easel?"</p><p>Scorpius replied, "I did, but if you're not that serious about your art then I'll just return it."</p><p>Albus shook his head. "Can't let a perfectly good easel go to waste. I never said I was giving up on drawing altogether, just that it'll take a back seat for a while."</p><p>Scorpius beamed, "Well, I'm glad to hear it. I think this easel is high-end or something."</p><p>He handed him a bag.</p><p>Albus took the easel out and sighed. "This is the highest quality easel there is, how did you find this?"</p><p>Scorpius shrugged. "I have connections everywhere."</p></div>
