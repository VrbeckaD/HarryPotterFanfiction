  <strong>Potions Classroom, The Dungeons, Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry, Scotland </strong>
</p><p>The room was silent except for the sounds of students working on their potions. Not many ‘eigthth’ year students returned to Hogwarts, those who were still alive anyway, after the final battle but there were enough to have relatively full classes. Hermione Granger had jumped at the chance to finish her schooling, dragging both Harry and Ron with her. She knew that they all could have easily started jobs at the Ministry the moment the war ended but they needed some normalcy for a while. They deserved a <em>normal </em>year at Hogwarts, as did everyone else in their year. </p><p>All of the professors, Slughorn in particular, seemed to want the students to have a healthy transition back to the castle. So that’s why the students of a NEWT-level Potions class were brewing a family tree potion, something that seems more apt for a class of First years. If Professor Snape was teaching Potions instead of Defense Against the Dark Arts, they would be brewing something meant for their ability level. </p><p>Professor Snape had hardly survived the final battle, he seemed to have died right in front of Harry, Ron, and Hermione, so it was a surprise to everyone that he decided to keep teaching at Hogwarts. He didn’t keep it a secret that he hated the majority, if not all, of the students and without the war he didn’t need to keep reporting to both Voldemort and Dumbledore. Maybe he actually did enjoy teaching and just kept that secret from everyone. Merlin, along with the rest of the Wizarding world, knows that the man is capable of keeping them.</p><p>The potion was simple; mix all the ingredients together, add a piece of the brewers hair when done and then put a droplet on a piece of parchment to see the brewers family tree back at least three generations, depending upon how much potion is put into the piece of parchment. Hermione’s parents were off in Australia, not knowing they had a daughter at all, while all of her other family were either dead or didn’t remember who she was. Both of her parents were only children and their parents were as well. </p><p>Hermione looked down at her potion with a sigh. The murky beige liquid seemed to be mocking her, just asking her to put a piece of her hair in it. She didn’t have any blood family left so why even bother? The only family she had left, Harry and the Weasley’s, wouldn’t even show up on the piece of parchment. But Harry was in the same boat as her and he was still diligently working, so she would do the same. </p><p>She took a singular piece of curly hair and tugged, hissing in pain when it was pulled from her scalp. She dropped it in the cauldron and quickly moved her hand away as the liquid began to hiss and steam just a little bit. The potion swirled around in the cauldron and slowly shifted from its original murky beige to a solid cream color.</p><p>Hermione looked around the room to see where everyone else was at. Harry and Ron seemed to be at the hair pulling stage, judging by them gritting their teeth and dropping something into their cauldrons, Ginny seemed to be where she was as did the Slytherins in the other corner of the room. Dean, Seamus, and Neville seemed to be messing around, all silently laughing about something one of them had whispered to the others. Professor Slughorn was at his desk, reading what looked like a copy of one of the textbooks for their class. </p><p>“Hey, ‘Mione” Ginny whispers from across the table, nudging Hermione’s foot underneath the table with hers. </p><p>“Yeah?” Hermione whispered back. </p><p>“Have you put yours on parchement yet?” Ginny asks. </p><p>Hermione shakes her head ‘no’. </p><p>“Have you?” She asks. </p><p>“I’m about to. Let’s do it together, shall we?” Ginny asks with a partial smile on her face. </p><p>Hermione nods and moves her stack of parchment to right next to her cauldron. Out of the corner of her eye, she sees Ginny doing the same. Hermione grabs a pipet and carefully puts some of the potion in it. She moves the pipet out of the cauldron to on top of the stack of parchment before looking back up at Ginny. It takes her a few more seconds before the redhead is looking back up at her. They nod their heads at each other and drop some of their potion onto the parchment. </p><p>Hermione, not needing to see her parents’ names appear on her parchment, looked across the table at Ginny. She seemed to be enamoured by her own piece of parchment, watching the names appear slowly in black ink. It was as if someone was writing the names right there on the parchement and Hermione would be lying if she said that the magic behind it wasn’t fascinating. </p><p>She, now wanting to see the magical writing close up, looked down at her own piece of parchment. Hermione gasped loud enough to draw attention from everyone sitting around her. </p><p>“Hermione? What’s wrong?” Ginny asks, a concerned look immediately taking hold of her face. </p><p>Hermione wanted to respond but she couldn’t form the words, they died in her throat as soon as she thought of them. </p><p align="center">

</p><p align="left">The rest of the family tree was being filled in but Hermione didn’t get to see it, as Ginny had grabbed the piece of parchment. Harry and Ron had also walked over during the time Hermione was looking at it, both of them crowding around Ginny so they could also read what was on the parchement. </p><p align="left">The three of them all looked up at Hermione within seconds of each other, their eyes as wide as saucers. They all shared a look with each other before turning their attention back to their friend. </p><p align="left">“D-did you-“ Ron started. </p><p align="left">“No, I didn’t know Ronald. Which is why I’m as shocked, more actually, than the three of you” Hermione snapped, clearly not in the mood for incessant questioning. </p><p align="left">Before anyone else could say anything, the bell marking the end of the period sounded. Potions was their last class of the day so now Hermione is going to be stuck with the three of them, not so much Ginny, questioning her for the next few hours about what the parchement says. </p><p align="left">“For homework write a four inch essay on why you think I assigned this particular potion!” Slughorn shouts out to the class as they begin to clean up. </p><p align="left">Ginny puts the piece of parchment back down next to Hermione before returning to her station to clean it, as do Harry and Ron. Hermione bottles up some of the potion and magically cleans out the rest, just like the rest of her classmates do. She gathers all of her stuff and, luckily, is the first out of all of her friends to leave the classroom. </p><p align="left">She sighed, feeling tears rush to her eyes. Her feet began to bring her to the library, the once place she knew that she could find solace in at a time like this. Harry and Ron won’t follow her due to their immense dislike towards such an academic atmosphere after classes and Ginny knows to not bother Hermione when she goes to the library anyway. </p><p align="left">She would have to do some research on this ‘Eva Fawley’ woman. Maybe she would have some of the answers that Hermione now needs. </p>
