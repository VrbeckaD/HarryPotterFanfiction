  <em>New starts. Two hearts; growing closer, loving more. A new year with new memories to make. Let’s open the door. </em>
</p><p align="left">January. The first month of the year. A time where everything seems fresh, like a blank canvas that will soon acquire the strokes of an artist’s paintbrush. Resolutions are also made; goals that one wishes to achieve, though many never see the finish line, abandoning their wishes after futile attempts. At least they tried though, right?</p><p align="left">“This year, I think I will try to eat less sweets,” Draco informed the man whom he was currently tangled with.</p><p align="left">It was well past midnight, but Harry and Draco still remained on their sofa, so close together it was as if there was actually only one person occupying the space. They had a lovely view of some fireworks that lit up the sky at the stroke of midnight, seeing them through one of the large windows that had made them both fall in love with this apartment as soon as they had seen it.</p><p align="left">Harry glanced up at the other man, who he happily called his boyfriend, and gave him a knowing look. “You say that every year, Draco. Will you really go through with it this year?” he asked.</p><p align="left">Draco shifted his gaze down, locking eyes with two beautiful emeralds. “I’ll continue to say it each year until I buckle down and go through with it,” he said, a non-serious tone tinting his speech. “However, I probably will not,” He added, giving Harry a glimpse of his pearly whites in the form of a dazzling smile.</p><p align="left">This caused Harry to laugh softly, shaking his head in amusement as well. “I’m sure you will not. You have too big a sweet tooth.” Returning a smile, Harry leaned up and pressed his lips to Draco’s, just as he had done an hour ago when their clock informed them that is was now a new year.</p><p align="left">“To another year,” Draco whispered, as if he were making a toast. Though while there were no drinks, there was he and Harry. Their lips were the wine glasses, touching in a toast to love.While Draco may not keep his promise of eating less sweets, and Harry may fail at whatever resolution he decides, they both knew one thing they certainly could keep: each other. They would have each other for this year, as they have for the past five. Through the good and the bad to come, each man would be there to help his boyfriend and to love his boyfriend. That is something they can keep, without having to speak it aloud on New Year’s Day.</p><p align="left">Another smile formed on Harry’s lips as the kiss ended, eyes locked with Draco’s as he nodded his agreement, “To another year.”</p>
