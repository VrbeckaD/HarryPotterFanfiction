    <p>          "Hold on, dear. We're nearly there," a masked woman said in a kind tone as she held the mother-to-be's hand.</p><p>          "Push, the last push!" one other announced.</p><p>          The birth mother was beautiful with lush and almost sparkling skin and a tint of yellow among her blue eyes. As circumstances commenced, her child was not a love child and motherhood as she knew it would be short lived. The feelings of anger welled in her as she screamed in agony while it seemed like pin needles mercilessly scraped their way through her core. The lights burst at once; the walls cracked; birds in all directions dropped in a motionless chaos. The head midwife knew it was time to put up a protection spell for herself and the others. With one last gasp, an infant emerged.</p><p>           "A girl, it's a girl," was heard in less than whispers and mischievous gasps.</p><p>          "No," the mother choked out trying to reach for her baby, "It can't be! GIVE ME MY CHILD!"</p><p>          A pale hand came from the darkness and spinelessly struck across the woman's face.</p><p>          "No," was stated in a simple hiss. His voice was controlled as well as controlling. In a slither of words he spoke, "For your last request, as you did do me a great service," the woman flinched expecting the worst, "name her."</p><p>         "Harley," the young mother forced out along with a single tear. Her voice was involuntary as if the utter of words were brought up from her chest by her ferrel soul. "Please, name her Harley."</p><p>         A flash of green light shot from the pale mans wand and the woman ceased. "Remove the revolting creature," he motioned at the healers. Turning towards the child, the man said, "She is to fulfill my deeds. Raise her as you wish and when the time is near, I will come."</p><p>         The masked group made deep bows and prepared their retreat.</p><p>         "Keep her intact." Slinking a black hood over dark, sleek hair. The lead adversary continued, "she has a purpose."</p><p>***</p><p>         It was after lunch at Malfoy Manor, Harley Jay (wink wink) and Draco Malfoy were out doing whatever it was that Draco wanted to do. Harley thought she was a common girl but even her look said otherwise; with long, deathly dark brown hair it was almost to the point of gentle waves down past her shoulders. Her eyes were a light brown, but if you looked at them closely there was a distinct yellow around the black pupil making them shine green at certain angles and tiny speckles of blue wouldn't be mistaken when noticed. Her skin was, well, perfect in everyone's eyes. It was always soft without effort and almost shinny, although she thought that she may have imagined that. Her freckles were light, stretched across her cheek bones and shoulders. She really wasn't horribly slim and skinny and it was fairly obvious that she did a fair amount of activity quite often, in her case, beating Draco in a broom race although he wouldn't admit it.</p><p>         "Draco, honestly, you're a month older than I and have equal chance of making the team in our first year, which is slim to none. Give it up already."</p><p>        "But really, come on, I look like a proper Quidditch Player like this," he said as he jumped on his new broom.</p><p>         "You really have high hopes, dontcha? By the way, your mother wanted me to deliver this to you," she handed him a box.</p><p>         "Ah, new broom kit," the boy smirked. "I'll only be impressed when the compass can steer me away from muggles on my travels." The Broomstick Servicing Kit came with all a young players needs: handle polish, twig clippers, a broom care book, and the mentioned compass which indeed was just a  brass clip-on compass that had no particularly magical qualities, although Harley got ideas on a couple of enchantments she could perform.</p><p>         Harley rolled her eyes; AS IF he was allowed on adventures, or anything fun by that matter. Honestly, looking back at her childhood, the Malfoys kept Draco under lock and key but never cared what Harley did already knowing she knew nothing else but to stick with the young blonde. They never expressed their opinion for or against any action that she took. Harley just chose to stay with Draco because that's all she ever did and all she thought she would ever do.</p><p>         Harley decided to move on with her day and let Draco polish his broom handle another thirteen times by himself. On the other side of the mansion was where Dobby, the house elf, would go to pick his weeds that he called flowers. She sat on the nearby bench and reached into her bag to grab the book 'Saucy Tricks for Tricky Sorts' and started reading about rainbow hair colouring charms. She had already finished 'Powers You Never Knew You Had and What To Do With Them Now You've Wised Up' last week and wanted something a little bit more silly this time.</p><p>         'Besides', she thought, mischievously, 'Draco's hair would look quite nice in a sequence of blues and purples.'</p><p>         Harley started to have one of her moments, the heartbreaking kind that stops you in your tracks. Her parents never looked for her, never wanted her, and probably never will unlike Draco who was wanted and had everything he needed plus more. Narcissa hated her questions on the subject. The Malfoys had never even actually adopted her so she was more like off the radar, you could call it. Known about, but no real records of her birth or life. She thought she was too different, never the "daughter" that they wanted. Draco conformed but Harley just couldn't bring herself to be just like him. She wanted more than stability. Harley needed adventure, she wanted to learn every skill and meet every creature. She had been a burden upon her birth, one that didn't deserve their love. It wasn't like she was neglected, the Malfoys filled her Gringotts vault, and she appreciated everything they gave her. She couldn't help but to feel like just an orphan, and she'll never be good -or even as bad enough- as Draco. </p><p>         She tried to distract herself. 'OK, focus. You only have a couple more months until you turn twelve, and you finally, finally start something real, something productive." You see, Harley wasn't interested in the many shops to spend more money in or the lovely events that the Malfoys attended. Instead, she was practicing magic. Not the accidental-episode-of-emotion-that-an-underage-child-experiences. More like self taught, never let the Malfoys know, wandless magic. Magic that she noticed she could control at a very young age. She started reading about ancient and even recent cultures that never used wands in the first place; that from a young age, they started honing their skills. She figured if they could do it, why can't she? The question wasn't how for a witch or wizard, it was when.  Harley decided years ago when she found she could control her senses that her time to make something useful was the present. The concept of waiting until you're eleven seemed completely counterproductive in her eyes. In a wand-bearing society, the only thing they know is to start magic when you are at school with your brand new wand. She learned from Dobby to find the loophole. The trick was that the Ministry had complete leniency with underage magic; I.E. the trace, so she utilized that fact and started practicing about three years ago. Harley owed it all to Dobby because without a mentor, it would have taken her much longer to than if she was on her own. The only problem with this was that the Malfoys could never know she ever spoke to Dobby as a friend. She doubted that she would get in any trouble, but Dobby? He was never so lucky in avoiding Lucius' wrath.</p><p>         Harl considered them all tricks, household chores done in a flash, levitation of objects. Dobby even help her consciously levitate herself, if she was still enough. Speaking of Dobby, *Pop* he appeared in front of her.</p><p>         "It's time for your lesson, Miss Harley," he said in a squeak.</p><p>         "Dear Dobby, I wish you could just call me Harley." He almost tripped on himself and desperately looked around for something hard to hit himself with for her kindness. "Stop! I only said I wished you could, not that you have too!" of course, Dobby was never allowed to address anyone at the house without the proper suffix or title, or Master for and of the Malfoys.</p><p>         "Calm down dobby, it's OK, it's OK. May I look at the cut on your arm?" She asked seeing as the bandages were dirty and falling all over the place. "You've gotta try to keep it clean, I know it's hard, but every time you get dirty water on it, it takes longer to heal."</p><p>         Dobby dared say nothing. Harley knew he wanted to, but to be appreciative of her efforts might give him a panic attack. He never stated, but she thought Dobby felt that he wasn't worthy of care or happiness. She reached into her bag and found her random strips of cloth that she cleaned and saved to put on the injured little elf. She never used new ones or the Malfoys would likely punish him for having too clean a rag upon his injury. Gently unwrapping the ones on Dobby's arm she inspected it.</p><p>         "Dobby, do you trust me?"</p><p>         He shook his head furiously.</p><p>         "Yes, Miss Harley. Dobby trusts Miss Harley with Dobby's life," he said fondly.</p><p>         "Alright, let me try something." She put her hand above his tiny arm, "Tergeo," she whispered. Small amounts of the dirt and grime seemed to drift away and she and Dobby looked at each other wide eyed, "I told ya, Dobby! I told ya I could do it!" She said as Dobby did a little happy squeal. Harley spoke a little louder and more confidently, "Tergeo." With that, the last bit of gunk and blood slivered to the ground and disappear. "Well," she said fairly pleased with the results, "It's looking better this week so this time when you need to punish yourself, please, try not to... run.. into sharp things."</p><p>         Last week he had accidentally left the Malfoy's laundry unfolded for a night and every article of clothing was wrinkled and unprepared in the morning. So Lucius let Dobby know to rewash everything and then punish himself extra when he was done. Harley tried to suggest calmer ways for Dobby to punish himself, but in the end, Dobby decided to hit himself with the fireplace stick, multiple times, and cut open his arm in the process. She hated it, but even with that much anger, she never lost control of her powers. She just had no say in the matter; Dobby was bound to the Malfoys for life.</p><p>         "There, all patched up for you, does it look ratty enough?" She asked as she snuck in a nice arm rub for comfort to him. Dobby looked down with a nod and Harley knew she saw a smile. "Perfect. Now, I do know that Narcissa told you to finish scrubbing every window before doing anything else today, so we had better postpone that lesson until you have more free time."</p><p>         "Miss Harley, Mrs. Malfoy said finish them by dinner time," he said almost excitedly, "So right now Dobby has time and Dobby will still have enough time to finish the windows," he said in an almost pleading tone.</p><p>         "Alright, since that is what she said, we can practice for an hour." Dobby almost jumped for joy at this; he really did enjoy helping Harley, even though he never said it. She was the only one kind to him in his entire life.</p><p>         They worked on manipulating another's actions and Dobby was the perfect test subject. Harley was able to lift Dobby's arms at this point, and needed to refine her ability.</p><p>         "Try bending Dobby's elbow and wrist, try pointing with Miss Harley's fingers very directly to aim Miss Harley's efforts," he said.</p><p>         She did so, failed, and backed up to concentrate.</p><p>         "Hold on," Harley said closing her eyes. She thought of the sky, the trees, the ocean. She imagined Dobby closing her bedroom door after he had collected the best flowers he could for her vase. The way that Draco saved the most fancy of pastries for her from all of his many family outings, and let her borrow a broom so they could race up and down the fields. She lifted up her hand, fingers spread, she wanted Dobby to sit on the bench. She imagined him walking backwards and using his good hand to stabilize his efforts as he took a little hop to scoot his behind back, then opened her eyes.</p><p>         "Miss Harley moved Dobby perfectly and most gentle." Dobby said beaming at her, maybe a little to the left of where she wanted him to be. She had done it though, intentionally manipulated all of his muscles to move as she was commanding them to.</p><p>         Harley started, "This is where I would be complementing you saying how you are such a great teacher," Dobby started getting uncomfortable, "but I won't, don't worry." the elf sighed in relief. "Now," Harley continued, "this lesson is over and you need to get to your windows. But, I happen to know that in my room, under my bed, is a sewn together outfit that might fit you. I certainly don't want it in my room, so if you can make sure to take it out of my room, and maybe keep it among your things, I will be unopinionated in the matter."</p><p>         Dobby's eyes grew, "You mean...." He trailed off.  Harley hinted, "I mean that you can decide what to do with it, after you take it out of my room." Jumping up Dobby started looking around nervously and excited.</p><p>         "D..D..Dobby must be off Miss Harley... Lesson....Miss Harley did a good job..." *poof* he was gone. </p><p>***</p>
