    <p>He opened his eyes, slowly looking around. He was lying on dark, smooth floor, wearing a long, navy blue coat, red hoodie, black trousers and also red shoes. He felt, as always, opaque pain on the right side of his body, just where his skin was stripped out, revealing raw meat. He often kept it in transparent patch, but now he couldn't feel it. He looked at his right hand. As remembered, it was whole metal, mechanic, red like blood. He smiled a bit. If he has that, nothing bad will happened.</p><p>He stood up, bracing his body with arms. He looked around once again. That was... something. He didn't really know what, but the room he was in was kinda big, had a lot of space to use. Dark floor he was lying at just a moment ago, was actually dark-wooden planks, and walls were painted on white, a bit grey, color. There wasn't any furniture, which was probably the cause of roomy feeling. Plus, there were a door. Big, dark-wood, with old-like knob. He walked towards it, catching it, and pushing down. Door opened right away, slowly, calmly, without any noise.</p><p>Right at the time he went out, he stopped and grabbed a pistol from holster on his hip, and pointed it on the person who was coming out of a room on the left. Suddenly, he realized, that there is another person, coming out of room on the right. He cursed silently and crossed his arms the way his red hand was pointed on this second person. Second after that, one of them, tall man with bald skull and not so good white shade of his skin, with cyan robes all over him. And there was this man, the tallest, whole in dark, black suit, or maybe armor, and helmet with a mask in shape of a skull. And with a long, shiny thing that started to glow with red laser. Oh, and this bald man right at the moment he saw others, put out something that looked like a... wand? A small grin appeared on Tord's face. Does this idiot really thinks that wands work?</p><p>'Who are you people?' asked Tord, looking around, on their faces. None of them reacted with any more than looking at him back. 'Ok, impolite people as I can see. So I'll repeat. Who are you?'</p><p>'Not your problem'. said calmly person in black, lifting his laser a bit. His voice sounded like he needed some device to breath or talk.</p><p>'Wow, rude.' said Tord in the same pitch. 'But I guess, it is now. And it's your, not mine problem, you see, I am the one who can kill you in the matter of seconds.'</p><p>That's right; his hand could launch little rockets, which always reached their destination. But probably they didn't know that. Person in black twisted his head a little.</p><p>'With that thing? I don't think so.' he replied.</p><p>Tord's sight was suddenly catched by a slow move with third man's hand. He pointed a gun at him with more aim than before.</p><p>'I wouldn't do it if I were you.' he said hostilely. 'So who the fuck are you?'</p><p>Still, none of them seemed like talking.</p><p>'Alright then, scum!' he said angrily. 'I'll start if that's so hard for you, god damn! I'm the Red Leader, but oh, here you go, you both can call me per Tord. I won't mind. Now, that's your turn!'</p><p>'I'm Voldemort. And I wouldn't suggest you to talk to me that way.' finally, pale man speaked, with rough, sharp voice. 'You understand?'</p><p>Tord laughed 'No, bitch. I don't. Even more, I think, that you need a bit more of respect towards others. Or at least towards me. And you?' without waiting for a response from a bald man, he turned his eyes on a man in whole black.</p><p>'Vader.'</p><p>'Not so talkative, huh? Sure. Sure. Alright. Who puts their weapon first?' Of course no one wanted to volunteer. They looked at each other with a warning. Tord sighed loudly. Voldemort looked at him with murder in his eyes. 'Alright. Shame on me.' He slowly put his gun down, the same as the hand. Other two seemed to mellowed out a little bit, but still looked at each other. 'Just put those weapons down, for fuck's sake!' suddenly shouted Tord, stomping his feet on the ground.</p><p>Voldemort looked at him with sarcazm, smiling badly. 'A kid in adult's body, isn't it?' Tord raised his eyebrow with gibe. 'If you say so... but, well, y'know, I wouldn't pay you attention on me right now.' he said, then quickly took step on the side. Vader leaped out of his place, pointing his laser sword to the Voldemort's chest, heart. Everything happened in absolute silence, just calm buzzing when he flicked his saber. When it looked like it will take less than second to Voldemort to fall dead on the floor, he raised his wand right prior to the red laser. It slid from some kind of field around it, and Vader has lost his concentration, at least that was how it looked like. Then Voldemort swung his wand, moving his lips, but without any voice coming from them. From the tip of it, bright, sick-green light came out, obviously targetting Vader. He let out from his lungs little groan, then lifted his hand so fast, that it became only softened black spot. Light stopped, millimeters from his palm. Green shined all over him, wobbling. Voldemort took one step back, widening his eyes.</p><p>'What?! That's impossible!' he screamed, then swung his wand once again. 'Avada Kedavra!' Another green beam flashed, targetting Vader. He let out a subdued scream, then put his second hand to the first one. Second... spell, stopped, exactly on the same place when the first one did. Vader lowered his head, his shoulders lifting and falling regularly. Voldemort's face became furious, he lifted his hand to send another spell, but stopped suddenly. Vader twisted his head slowly, looking right on the light he held in place by some unbelievable force. Tord's eyebrows went so high, that they hid in the caramel hair he had, styled to remind people of the devil. But right now, he thought, that this person in black seems right now more to be the devil than him. He smiled. Then Vader sighed, and gustily shoved his hands on the side. Green light hit the floor, but it just spread harmlessly, not even causing the dark planks to suffered at any point.</p><p>'Ok I think that's enough' he said, putting his hands up in the sign of surrender, and stepping a bit forward. 'I think you both showed your best... Put that down, Voldemort.' He said, when saw bald man to rise his wand once again, but suddenly freezed.</p><p>'You can't tell me what to do.'</p><p>'Yes, I can't, indeed. But no need to fight, y'know? Right, Vader, you won't attack me on my back, I hope? I just wanna talk.' he said, with the same tone, as he felt steps behind him, and saw red light, when his body made a shadow from it. There was a few seconds of silence, then... louder buzzing. Red light slid slowly to the handle Vader was holding. Tord smiled widely. 'Thank you!' he said loudly, looking around. This room was pretty the same as the one he came out of. Or maybe a bit bigger. 'So, if we already know, who we are... Tord, Voldemort, Vader... Two names starting on "v" by the way, that's interesting...</p><p>'You talk too much.' said Vader, crossing his arms on his chest.</p><p>'I agree.' agreed Voldemort, looking at both men with anger.</p><p>'Jeez, alright.' murmured Tord, rolling his eyes. 'And you two act like some kind of moving statues... Or at least you, Vader. Voldemort's more talkative, or maybe impulsive? Nevermind. Ok so what is the place we're actually at?' Nobody answered. All of them looked a bit confused at this time.</p><p>'I have no idea.' said finally Vader, shrugging.</p><p>'I think I recognize some of these... But can't place it anywhere in my memory.' said Voldemort, suddenly calm.</p><p>'Same, guys...' murmured Tord, squinting. 'so what are we gonna to do now, when both of you are kind of chill...' He couldn't end his sentence at all. Every of them saw a screen, which appeared in the center of the room, without anything, not a noise or light. It just appeared. From nothing. They looked at each other, at least that was how it looked like. You can't really tell when Vader's looking at something. 'Hey, something's appearing here!' shouted Tord, coming closer.</p><p>'Very irresponsible, coming closer to a thing you don't know anything about.' said Vader softly, but followed him. 'You see anything in here?'</p><p>'No... But... wait...' he tried with all his will to see anything, but there just wasn't anything. 'No, nothing...'</p><p>'I see.' said suddenly Voldemort, standing right behind Tord and next to Vader, who looked at him for a second. 'Just a blink. Here.' he lifted his pale hand, putting it closer to the screen. Vader could only sigh, before Voldemort touched it. And then, it blazed with warm, orange light. Tord turned and looked at Voldemort with a stare. 'What?'</p><p>'Have you just touched something absolutely unknown?' He said, then smiled very widely. 'I love that! So, what...'</p><p><em>'Three demons'  </em>They shut up and looked at the same time on the screen, which still remained black. <em>'Met together at once...'</em></p><p>'What the...' murmured Voldemort, silenced right after by Tord.</p><p><em>'From different worlds, but... how similar to each other...'</em> voice was coming out of this screen, which slowly started to turn grey. <em>'How come? Same thoughts, same desires... same... incredibly dominant personalities. If there's something they want... It... will... happen, no matter the cost in other people...'</em></p><p>They looked at each other hesitantly, or at least Tord and Voldemort did. In each face there was precarious glint, even in dark, kind of red lens of Vader. The voice continued. </p><p><em>'Yes, indeed. Darth Vader, dark lord of the Sith. Ruthless, dangerous. Left his friends, his past life to reach to power... What a coincidence!'</em> screen flashed into an image, or images, two, fusing into one. There were two faces; One, crying, with ginger hair and beard, shiny blue eyes, second with three faces, one dark-brown haired with sad, green eyes, another ginger hair and purple eyes, and also light brown, with absolutely black eyes. Tord's fists quivered, he felt something crawling down his back, causing shivers. He felt unstoppable fury wanting to escape from his body. <em>'Not only same dominants... but traitors, too...'</em></p><p>'Shut up! How do you know that, fucker?!' shouted Tord, trying to hit the screen, but Vader reacted at time, catching his red hand in strong grasp. Carmel-haired struggled a bit, but realized, that it leads to nothing. He gave up on trying to crash something, but still sent adverse glances to this thing, that have just showed his old friends.</p><p><em>'So weak they once were...'</em> the voice continued like nothing happened, but Tord could swear, that he heard girding note in it, barely audible. <em>'While Voldemort caused suffering to others from very, very young age! Even before he was born...'</em></p><p>Vader glanced at Voldemort, whose face turned a bit red. Something strange, but at the same time so similar surrounded them, melting into the one with the Force Vader realized he let out.</p><p>'You gonna talk more or tell us what is happening?!' Tord couldn't resist any longer 'Shut up and tell us, why the fuck are we here! I don't need to know anything about them! I don't care! And I can bet they don't either!'</p><p>Voice stayed silent for a longer while, while screen suddenly turned black. But not the black they have seen before, no. That was... something else. More dangerous. But Tord stayed on his place. </p><p><em>'As you wish.'</em> right now it was obvious, that the voice is gird. <em>'That's a competition, if you insist to know. Competition, to who can destroy, break human's mind into pieces... And turn it to good, little whore on that person's every command.'</em></p><p>Tord raised his eyebrows.</p><p>'And why do you think any of us will join it, huh?'</p><p>
  <em>'Because you like it? Because all three of you enjoy to make other people suffer... Because all of you gets arousal, when thinking on other person, who will do anything you wish and tell them to do?'<br/></em>
</p><p>Silence told more words that it could've been ever spoken.</p><p>'Yeah...' murmured Tord, looking at Vader and Voldemort. They both looked at themselves, then at Tord. Shrugged at the same time, and nodded. Tord let out a little laugh. 'So, let's say we do it... What do we get?'</p><p>
  <em>'Self-pride when you will beat others... or endless shame when they beat you.'</em>
</p><p>'You can't stand a chance against me.' said Vader suddenly, Tord and Voldemort looked at him with amusement.</p><p>'You sure?' asked silently Voldemort, raising his eyebrow. 'I wouldn't be...' his voice automatically lowered the temperature in this room, or whatever that was.</p><p>'Yeah, me too.' added Tord, then laughed. 'Alrighty then, ms. dark voice coming out of nowhere! Where are our victims?'</p><p><em>'Right behind you.'</em> it answered immediately. They three turned at once. Actually, there were three people, kneeling on the ground, with wide opened eyes, all tied up on the wrists and ankles, and a gag in their mouths, with drops of saliva coming down their chins. When they saw that Tord, Vader and Voldemort turned around, they tried to move back, but couldn't at that point. Tord laughed more, then turned to tell something to the screen once again, but frozed. There wasn't any screen. Or anything else. Just he same room... but with a couch, wide, divided into three colors; first black, then red, then green.</p><p>'Let's see...' muttered Vader, coming closer to the tied ones. 'They're all men.'</p><p>'I like men too.' said Voldemort, dismissively. Tord turned slowly back to them.</p><p>'Who doesn't?' he asked, then looked at Vader. 'You?'</p><p>'No. Just saying.' replied man in black, then came closer to the first person. He had long, dark hair falling on his shoulders, tearful cyan eyes and boyish body. He was naked, as all of them. Second one had blonde, messed up hair and green eyes, while the third one was most muscled of all them, with bald head and scared, dark eyes. 'I want this one.' Vader pointed at the third one.</p><p>'I wanna this!' said Tord loudly, jumping to them, intentionally pushing Voldemort a bit, and reaching to the blonde one. He grabbed his chin and lifted it, forcing the boy to look him in the amber eyes. He smiled widely, evil.</p><p>'I don't need to choose to get them on their knees.' said Voldemort calmly, coming to the first one. 'So I guess, let's go to our rooms, and do... our best, huh?'</p><p>'Absolutely.' said Tord, nodding. Then he reached to kneeling boy and caught him, putting up, like a bride. His face turned bright red. 'See ya in... how long you think?'</p><p>'I can do that in an hour.' said Vader, looking closely to the man he chose. 'Or even less.'</p><p>'Well I need more.' said Tord, raising his eyebrow. 'I felt that, whatever that was. This... thing, coming from both of you. I don't have any kind of that magic, y'know? I want... five hours. How does that sound?'</p><p>'I could do the same time as Vader, but... We're not running anywhere, are we?' murmured Voldemort, then came closer to his victim and crouched, dissolving ties on boy's ankles. 'Come'</p><p>They came to the room Voldemort came out of, dark-haired boy stumbling many times, then door closed and there was no more sound. Tord looked at Vader.</p><p>'Good luck, I guess?'</p><p>'I don't really need your luck.'</p><p>'Ah, fuck you.' carmel-haired turned and went to his room, slamming the door. Vader looked at his victim, kneeling, bonded, with scared sight and lonely tear coming down his round, sad face. Then, suddenly, he turned around and took a few steps to his room. </p><p>'What are you waiting for? Do you think I am going to carry you?' Muffled words came out of scared's man mouth. 'You have ten seconds to come here, or your buttocks will hurt as it never did before.'</p><p>Bald man widened his eyes, then looked around, scared of what can come next. He knew there is no other choice for him, so he slowly moved his knees, trying to move forward. But it still clearly took him too much. When he entered the room before Vader, suddenly felt firm pressure on his back, then felt on his face, groaning through the gag. Vader pushed him deeper into the room, letting of the door, which slammed hardly on the frame.</p><p>
  <em>So the fun begins...</em>
