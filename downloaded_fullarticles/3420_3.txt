    <p>It was a peaceful July day at the Locksley house. Robin and Regina Locksley were enjoying dinner at their home at 108 Mifflin Street with their three children: Henry Daniel, age 17, Roland Nicholas, age 16, and Danielle Marian-Robin, age 10. Danielle would turn 11 on the 25th of December, 2019. The family was enjoying a quiet dinner when an owl landed outside the front door, causing everyone to turn their heads towards the source of the noise. Robin grabbed his bow and arrows and said, “I’ll go see what’s up.”<br/>
Regina nodded as her husband kissed her on the cheek before going to find the source of the noise. Before Robin could even step outside, the brown owl flew into the house and landed on the kitchen table. Robin pulled an arrow out of his quiver and aimed at the owl when Danielle shouted, “Wait! Don’t kill it Daddy!”<br/>
Robin hesitantly lowered his arrow as the owl gazed at him. Regina suddenly noticed the owl had a scroll in its claws. Regina took the scroll from the owl and skimmed the contents of the letter. She scowled a little but handed the letter to Danielle, “It’s for you.”<br/>
Danielle took the letter from her mother. She rarely, if ever, got mail, let alone via owl, “What does it say?” asked Henry.<br/>
“Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Ms. Danielle Locksley, 108 Mifflin Street, Storybrooke, Maine, USA.<br/>
Dear Ms. Locksley,<br/>
We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment. Term begins on September 1. We await your owl no later than July 31.<br/>
Yours sincerely,<br/>
<em>Minerva McGonagall</em><br/>
Headmistress<br/>
P.S. I am aware your 11th birthday is not until the 25th of December. I am making an exception to the rule so that you may start the term on time with your peers.” Excitement filled Danielle as she finished reading the letter.<br/>
Regina furrowed her brow and took the letter and list from her daughter, “So it does exist,” whispered Robin softly.<br/>
“Robin, you can’t possibly believe that this is real!” shouted Regina to her husband.<br/>
“I don’t know Gina, it looks pretty official,” said Robin looking at the letter himself, “IT has a raised seal and everything.”<br/>
“This is a town with magic, Robin, I’m sure any prankster could make it look real,” scolded Regina.<br/>
“But what is it is real Mom?” pleaded Danielle.<br/>
“Danielle Marian-Robin Locksley!” shouted Regina and Danielle cowered slightly. Regina glanced over at Robin, “Kids, wait here while I have a conversation with your father. Robin a moment,” Regina motioned towards the stairs.<br/>
Robin followed his wife obediently hoping to incur less of her wrath, “Well, what are we waiting for?” asked Henry to his siblings as the three of them quietly dashed upstairs to the outside of Robin and Regina’s room. They were clearly having a heated argument.<br/>
“Come one Robin, the boys are probably playing a prank on Danielle since she has magic. You know they’re both obsessed with those books!” shouted Regina.<br/>
“You think they actually managed to get an owl involved?” asked Robin.<br/>
“I don’t know. Maybe Gold or Zelena helped them,” said Regina perturbed.<br/>
The three siblings listened to their parents argue, “Okay Gina, enough with the fire balls,” they heard Robin say. They all glanced at each other nervously, knowing the situation was serious. Regina rarely actually threw the fire balls, but certainly created enough of them when she was angry.<br/>
“Maybe Danielle can transport in?” whispered Roland.<br/>
“Too risky,” said Henry.<br/>
“You know I can hear you three out there,” said Regina.<br/>
The three siblings looked at each other before running or transporting back downstairs. A few moments later, Robin and Regina emerged from upstairs. Regina came over to Danielle and laid her hands on her daughter’s shoulders, “Honey, I’d like to speak with you in private.”<br/>
Danielle nodded as Regina transported them into Danielle’s room, “Mom, please you have to let me go!” begged Danielle.<br/>
“I’m telling you, honey, it’s nothing more than a giant joke,” said Regina firmly, “I’ve read all those books to Henry and Roland before you were born.” The two women suddenly heard a crash and they both turned towards the source of the noise, “What the heck was that?” asked Regina. Danielle shrugged her shoulders, “Stay here while I see what’s going on,” Regina whispered. Danielle nodded apprehensively and Regina left the room. She slowly descended the stairs, carefully listening to her husband’s voice and another voice, “Whoa there fella, put the arrow down,” said the strange voice. Regina walked over to her husband as Robin slowly put the arrow down, “That’s good.”<br/>
“Who…who are you?” asked Regina hesitantly, ready to perform magic on a moment’s notice. This man was rather large and quite frankly, a little intimidating, even for a former Evil Queen.<br/>
“The name’s Rubeus Hagrid mam,” said Hagrid holding out his giant hand for them, “You must be Robin n Regina Locksley. Rumor had it that Marian wadn’t yer wife anymore,” said Hagrid sadly.<br/>
Robin cleared his throat, “Well yes, Marian passed away several years ago, when Roland was one.”<br/>
Hagrid turned to Henry and Roland and stated, “You both can’t be Danielle. Where is the lass?”<br/>
“Right here,” answered Danielle, hesitantly coming down the stairs.<br/>
Hagrid smiled warmly, “Pleased to meet ye Danielle. Anyways, we figured ye all would be a little confused, considerin yer on this side of the pond,” began Hagrid, “McGonagall figured you’d ‘ave sum doubt, so she sent me o’er to confirm.”<br/>
“Told you it was legit,” said Robin nudging Regina. She glared at him slightly.<br/>
“Now, I’m not very familiar with the American wizarding world n most of this stuff is from Diagon Alley…”<br/>
“Wait a minute sir,” said Henry, “If all of this is real, does that mean you know…Harry Potter?” he asked excitedly.<br/>
“’Course I know Harry!” stated Hagrid proudly, “In fact, his daughter will be startin at Hogwarts this year too.”<br/>
Henry’s face lit up with excitement and Regina chuckled, “My dear son is a big fan of the books.”<br/>
“I see,” chuckled Hagrid, “Well, McGonagall has arranged e’erything. Considerin we ‘ave to ‘ave yer owl in by next week, I can drop off yer reply to McGonagall meself. All yer family can join ya.”<br/>
“Wait, how did you get here exactly?” asked Robin.<br/>
Hagrid led the family outside and pointed to a giant motorcycle, “That.”<br/>
Henry and Roland’s faces lit up once again, “Do we get to ride that Mom?” asked Roland excitedly.<br/>
“Well, yer not gettin there any other way,” said Hagrid mounting the bike, “Don’t worry, you all will fit, just hold on tight.” Henry sat down behind Hagrid, then Roland, Danielle, Regina, and lastly Robin at the rear.<br/>
“You know how much I’ve always wanted to fly?” asked Robin to Regina enthusiastically.<br/>
Regina smirked at him, “Yeah, I sort of have an idea.”<br/>
“Alright everyone. Off te London. Next stop: Diagon Alley!”</p>
