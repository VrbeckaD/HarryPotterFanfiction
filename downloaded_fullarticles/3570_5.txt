</p>
<p align="center">you are staring at yourself in the mirror</p>
<p align="center">at remus lupin</p>
<p align="center">the boy turned werewolf</p>
<p align="center">you will tell yourself you do not need anyone</p>
<p align="center">what you have is already inside you</p>
<p align="center">.</p>
<p align="center">no one had really ever known the details of how it began</p>
<p align="center">no one had ever asked</p>
<p align="center">they had found you bleeding in the backyard and rushed you off to st. mungo's</p>
<p align="center">and that was the end of it</p>
<p align="center">[so they didn't know]</p>
<p align="center">.</p>
<p align="center">they didn't know how the wolf had truly shown itself to the young wizard</p>
<p align="center">fascinated by the glinting intelligence in the wolf's eyes</p>
<p align="center">it filled you with a kind of pounding fear that seemed to light every part of you aflame</p>
<p align="center">.</p>
<p align="center">everything after that was a blur</p>
<p align="center">you didn't really know what had happened.</p>
<p align="center">/\</p>
<p align="center">those nights you came alive with a sense of fear and adventure and most strangely…</p>
<p align="center">you felt love.</p>
<p align="center">…</p>
<p align="center">for the wolf inside of you</p>
<p align="center">you should hate it for transforming you into this…</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>creature.</em>
</p>
<p align="center">but you don't.</p>
<p align="center">.</p>
<p align="center">you never do.</p>
<p align="center">.</p>
<p align="center">why?</p>
<p align="center">.</p>
<p align="center">you push it away</p>
<p align="center">you try to hate the monster inside of you</p>
<p align="center">but all you end up doing is hating yourself</p>
<p align="center">[well, maybe that is what you deserve</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>freak. monster. worthless. creature.]</em>
</p>
<p align="center">.</p>
<p align="center">the flame inside of you is growing</p>
<p align="center">it wants to be seen by your ever-averted eyes</p>
<p align="center">soon you will finally see it and it will blind you with its roaring light</p>
<p align="center">/\</p>
<p align="center">you are growing more attuned to the wolf's feelings with every day that passes by</p>
<p align="center">it matters no more if it is full moon or not</p>
<p align="center">you are hearing the wolf speak in your mind</p>
<p align="center">its soothing voices awakes some primal rage inside of you</p>
<p align="center">.</p>
<p align="center">you roam free that night</p>
<p align="center">you are letting go to the wolf on those moonlit days</p>
<p align="center">you are coming alive</p>
<p align="center">.</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>wakeupwakeupwakeup</em>
</p>
<p align="center">a million billion trillion different voices</p>
<p align="center">hissing snaking roaring mewing barking speaking</p>
<p align="center">in your mind</p>
<p align="center">the wolf is speaking to you</p>
<p align="center">the wolves are howling at the moon</p>
<p align="center">.</p>
<p align="center">you fall in love with the wolf</p>
<p align="center">and you fall in love with yourself</p>
<p align="center">you cannot hate yourself anymore</p>
<p align="center">it is not what you deserve</p>
<p align="center">you can understand that it was never your fault now</p>
<p align="center">.</p>
<p align="center">you run free that night</p>
<p align="center">you don't care anymore</p>
<p align="center">you don't care about hating about thinking about staying</p>
<p align="center">you are running and it feels so</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>free</em>
</p>
<p align="center">you are free</p>
<p align="center">and that is the best part of it all</p>
<p align="center">.</p>
<p align="center">for one night you leave behind your daily fears</p>
<p align="center">you forget the past and throw away your future</p>
<p align="center">you embrace the</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>right now</em>
</p>
<p align="center">you are screaming and howling and you love the feeling</p>
<p align="center">you are not holding back anymore</p>
<p align="center">.</p>
<p align="center">you embrace the inside of your heart</p>
<p align="center">the snarling terror</p>
<p align="center">the primal rage</p>
<p align="center">but the unspoken love</p>
<p align="center">the barking laughter of young pups</p>
<p align="center">it overtakes the faults of the whole</p>
<p align="center">.</p>
<p align="center">embrace yourself</p>
<p align="center">stop running in circles</p>
<p align="center">chasing your own tail</p>
<p align="center">you are yourself and no one will change that</p>
<p align="center">you are your evils and your goods</p>
<p align="center">you are the wolf</p>
<p align="center">but you are also the human</p>
<p align="center">each has its evils</p>
<p align="center">and each has its beauties</p>
<p align="center">.</p>
<p align="center">embrace the wolf</p>
<p align="center">embrace yourself</p>
<p align="center">feel the fur upon you</p>
<p align="center">and you fall apart inside as you accept who you are</p>
<p align="center">but you crumble and then you rise inside</p>
<p align="center">you are resurrecting into yourself again</p>
<p align="center">.</p>
<p align="center">the darkness of your so called disease runs in your very veins</p>
<p align="center">it runs deeply in your soul</p>
<p align="center">and it is not wrong that you would never change that</p>
<p align="center">that will never be wrong</p>
<p align="center">.</p>
<p align="center">you are waking into a new you</p>
<p align="center">you are waking into a future into which maybe you won't be so hated anymore</p>
<p align="center">maybe you won't be so despised</p>
<p align="center">.</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>if you want to change the world, you have to start by changing yourself.</em>
</p>
<p align="center">.</p>
<p align="center">you are changing but yet you are still the same</p>
<p align="center">you are still</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>you</em>
