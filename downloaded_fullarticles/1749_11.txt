    <p>The wind whispered angrily at Remus’ face as he ran through the forest and the trees stood as the only witness to his plight. Breathing heavily and close to tears, the werewolf could do nothing but hope he was nearly there, yet the darkness seemed never-ending and stretched further than his wolf enhanced vision could see.</p>
<p>“Please, please, please!” He begged, his voice nothing but a hoarse whisper that was too weak to resist being stolen by the breeze. His feet, having been bare, were rubbed raw to the point where Remus was sure he was bleeding.</p>
<p>Excited howls filled the remaining silence, sending cold shivers down the young man’s spine. He pushed on faster, pressing his toes into the ground for more force. The noises surrounded him and he knew they were close. Nausea rolled in his stomach and bile was almost crawling up his throat at the thought of the others. He could still feel Greyback’s hands on him and the scent of his tyrant alpha lingered.</p>
<p>There! He could see it! A dry sob escaped Remus as he made the last push towards his destination. The sinister sounds were too near - there wasn’t enough time for a decent extraction plan. The werewolf was beyond caring; at least he had gotten here, he could easily make something up quickly.</p>
<p>Remus had built up too much momentum to stop properly, however. He instead crashed loudly into a door, surely disturbing the occupants of the house. He tried to steady himself, though now that he had stopped moving so vigorously he could feel the sharp stings in the soles of his feet and the slow, deep ache in his chest. He had gotten so focused on trying to breathe that he hadn’t noticed the door open.</p>
<p>“Do you have any idea what time it is? My son is trying to sleep.” Raising his head, Remus found himself looking into the emotive green eyes he hadn’t seen for almost six years. A slight intake of breath alerted him that he had also been recognised.</p>
<p>“Lils, who is it? Can’t they wait till the morning?” Hazel eyes joined verdant and, like their companion’s, they widened in surprise. “Lupin? What in Merlin’s name are you doing here? Didn’t you go mental?”</p>
<p>Remus, now sufficiently recovered for his task, heaved panicked words from his mouth as if expelling them from his lungs. “They’re coming. You have to go. Find somewhere safe.” Everything hurt, but he could only think of the Potters - they needed to be safe.</p>
<p>“The fuck?” James Potter pushed himself in front of his wife, hostility bleeding into his posture and expression. “You really did lose it. Get off of my property.” He readied his wand - when had he gotten that? Remus asked internally, reprimanding himself for his lack of concentration.</p>
<p>“Please,” he pleaded. It wasn’t the approach he’d wanted to take; the attack wasn’t meant to happen for days, he should have had time to prepare, to warn them! “It’s Greyback, he’s coming. His pack are already close by. You have to leave and find Dumbledore.”</p>
<p>Whilst suspicion clearly endured in the eyes of James, Lily Potter gasped lightly at the mention of the infamous wizard. She gripped her husband’s arm tightly and pulled. “James…” She started. </p>
<p>He tried to shake her off, but Remus wasn’t surprised to see her remain in place just as strong. She was never one to listen when told to back down. “Lily, he’s a stranger who shows up in the middle of - ”</p>
<p>Cut off by a blood-curdling howl, Remus instinctively crouched into a defensive stance, preparing to fight off his former packmates. His gaze searched the shadows, looking for the predators he had reluctantly become so intimate with. “Get inside.” He warned lowly, his voice suddenly taking on a dangerous undertone. Without waiting for any form of response, he pushed out and, catching James in the chest, pressed them all inside the Potter house.</p>
<p>It was a testament to the severity of the situation that neither of them resisted him, they simply moved to let him in. “Go check on Harry.” James said to Lily quietly as his wand was still poised for action. She nodded and rushed up the stairs to see to her son’s safety. </p>
<p>Remus went further into the house, a little dumbfounded at the heat of the air. He hadn’t felt the warmth of a proper home in a long time. After spending so much time in the wake of his expulsion living with a pack of lycanthropes who had considered themselves more wolf than human, insulated walls and a soft carpet felt like walking into a palace.</p>
<p>Photographs lined the walls and Remus couldn’t help but smile at the dancing image of two people so incredibly in love. His gut twisted at the thought of someone wanting to destroy something so pure. They were such a beautiful family; their history together catalogued proudly on their front room wall, displaying for every visitor their love for each other, school friends, and - most recently - their little baby son. Remus decided he like these photos very much.</p>
<p>The other images caught his interest. Ones containing a man with a soft body, whose features were too small and sharp for his face, creating a vaguely timid, mousy look. This was a man that Remus recognised.</p>
<p>Seeing this man laughing and smiling in the home of the Potters froze the blood in his veins. This was the Dark Lord’s pet, he realised. He remembered sitting by Greyback’s feet - an act of submission that amused the sadist to no end -  and looking across at the face of a man with too much power. He’d barely registered other person, the Dark Lord having an aura that was as captivating as it was intimidating. What had been noticeable about him was the way the Dark Lord had looked down at him with disdain and how he stuttered out an address with a low, barely audible pitch, so unlike the usual companions of the evil Remus knew.</p>
<p>“Who is this?” He picked up a frame containing a photograph of the man and showed James who had taken his place by the window, pulling back the curtain every now and then to glance outside.</p>
<p>The wizard looked confused for a moment. “Who? Pete? Don’t you remember him from school?” </p>
<p>“You can’t trust him.” Affronted, James sputtered out protests, all of which Remus ignored. “Greyback and the Dark Lord, he was working for them, or something. He gave them your address.” </p>
<p>“No. Pete would never… he wouldn’t. He’s one of my best mates.”</p>
<p>“Look, I don’t care if he’s your best friend, brother, whatever. The fact is that he was - ”</p>
<p>“Little wolf!” It came as a teasing yell, almost musical in its mocking tone. “Come on out, pet.” The familiar nickname smashed through Remus’ confidence and he trembled in panic. “Why did you run? Did the puppy not want to be good? You know what we do to naughty puppies, pet.” </p>
<p>James’ skin had taken on a sickly pallor. “What’s he on about?”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter.” Joining his former schoolmate by the window. Remus took a glimpse outside and his brow furrowed in uncertainty. “Why are they just standing there?” He was right; gathered at the treeline was the pack of werewolves that had made Remus’ life an almost literal hell for six years. They remained there, prowling up and down as if they really were animals on the hunt.</p>
<p>Hurried footsteps approached them and Lily reappeared with a tiny bundle in her arms. “I’ve sent a patronus to Sirius. We should go to his flat and figure out what to do from there.” James nodded in confirmation and advanced  towards his wife. He took the load from her arms carefully and Remus’ heart clenched at the adoration in his eyes as he whispered calming words down at his son as he gave a confused whine.</p>
<p>“James, Lily, there’s someone coming.” The other man warned lowly. “Shit, shit.” He closed the curtain roughly and dragged himself towards the other two. “I think it’s Voldemort.”</p>
<p>The witch cursed and checked for herself. “How did he find out where we are?” </p>
<p>“Does it matter!? We have to go.” Remus seized Lily’s arm, but in a sudden, painful flash, they were blown back as a large portion of the front wall was ruptured violently.</p>
<p>Remus heard Lily coughing harshly through the high pitched ringing in his ears as she expelled tiny particles from her lungs. “James? Harry? Are you okay?”</p>
<p>The reply came in the form of a laugh that could only be described as malevolent. “Why bother asking, dearest Lily, when you know they’ll be dead in a few moments? Do you cave pain?” His voice washed over them and hearing it was like being caressed by death.</p>
<p>“Lily,” Remus gasped out, his ribs screaming at him as he shifted to a more upright form.</p>
<p>Black robes appeared in his line of vision. “Aren’t you Greyback’s toy?” The Dark Lord asked in disgust. “I could kill you and put an end to your miserable excuse of an existence. However, your master has expressed a desire for your return.” He crept back over to Lily who had crawled towards her husband and son. They seemed, thankfully, fine if not a little battered going by Harry’s angry cries and James’ quiet assurances.</p>
<p>“How sweet,” Voldemort said in a saccharine tone, “say your goodbyes, mudblood.” He lifted his wand towards Lily’s body and , as he prepared to utter the fatal curse, she threw her arm out at Remus and clutched his forearm.</p>
<p>Not knowing what her plan was, the next moment passed in a twisted burst of nauseating blurs of green and red. It was as if his stomach had been pinched and tugged ruthlessly. He was helpless to stop it. It was terrifying, but sudden as, with a sharp crack and a heavy drop in his belly, his sight was almost immediately surrounded with new surroundings.</p>
<p>It was all too much for Remus. As soon as the unfamiliar walls stopped spinning, he collapsed to the floor and retched hard. He couldn’t comprehend what had happened. That was Voldemort! The Dark Lord had held a wand to their heads and they were still alive!</p>
<p>For a moment all that filled the air was Remus’ gagging, Harry’s terrified shrieks, and James’ attempts to quieten him. </p>
<p>“James! Merlin’s tits, mate, what the fuck did they do?” A foreign sound - someone new. Remus’ head spun. For years he had been around the same faces and the same scents, with barely any variation. All these new sensations made his skin feel like it was vibrating. Everything was in overload: the noises were too loud, smells were too potent, colours were too bright. A long whine escaped him as his adrenaline crashed.</p>
<p>Ignoring everything around him as he laid his head on the ground, all Remus could think about was how he wished he wasn’t too late.</p>
