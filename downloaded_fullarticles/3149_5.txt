    <p>When Vernon and Petunia Dursley were unable to find a sitter for their eight year old nephew while they took their son on a day trip to London, Jason Todd seized his chance. London wasn't Gotham (nowhere was Gotham) but the streets were the streets, and he knew how to live on them.</p><p> </p><p>Some three years later…</p><p>The Robins, a group of homeless kids and teens who were less “gang” and more “family”, were incredibly startled when a large brown owl swooped into their main safehouse one morning and dropped a letter, of all things, on their leader's head. Well, where his head would have been if he'd still been there when it landed. </p><p>Crystal, thirteen and untrusting and Jason's best student in projectiles, threw her pen through the air like a dart, hitting the bird at least hard enough to concuss it. They all watched it fall, wary and suspicious. Lulu, whose proficiency in explosives was terrifying for anyone, let alone a ten year old¹, darted forward to check it over. Trusting her, Jason turned his attention to the letter. He'd thought there weren't any themed… anyone, villains or heroes or otherwise, in this world, but maybe he'd been wrong…?</p><p><em>Mr. H. Potter,</em> read the letter, and underneath that his precise location, down to the room where they all sleep. His eyes narrowed. How the fuck did someone manage to connect that name to him? And<em> how do they know where he lives?</em> More importantly, how much do they know about his family?
</p><p>
Jason uses his knife to flip over the envelope and examine the seal (an <em>actual wax seal,</em> what the fuck) holding it shut. A coat of arms divided into fourths and centered on an <em>H,</em> each quadrant dedicated to an animal -- a snake and a bird on the right and two noticeably different but otherwise unidentifiable four-legged creatures on the left. Underneath is a legend, rendered illegible by size.</p><p>What the fuck.</p><p> </p><p>The next day, another owl pecked at the closed window of their new main safe house. TK, who was closest, peeked past the curtain and swore. Loudly. Lulu leaned on her brother’s shoulder to look out as Jason, the only other person currently in the safe house, jerked abruptly into wakefulness. </p><p>“How the fuck?” she breathed. Jason rolled upright and made his way over, silent but quick. The bird pecked at the window again, with a distinct air of impatience. One beady eye fixed itself on the twins. TK dropped the curtain. </p><p>Upon seeing the owl, Jason swore as well. Then he shooed the other two away from the window, murmuring to them “don’t kill it this time, okay?” Both twins pouted; they’d eaten owl the night before. It was a rare treat, since it wasn’t often they got fresh meat.</p><p>Jason opened the curtains and then the window, extending an arm to the bird. Testing a theory. It didn’t hesitate to land on his arm and stick its leg out expectantly. As he’d thought, then. (Who in their right mind would train owls as messenger birds?)</p><p>With his other hand, Jason took the envelope from the bird. It was identical to the first from the name on the front to the contents.</p><p>
  <em>”We await your owl…”</em>
</p><p>
With the twins' help, Jason fished out a sheet of notebook paper and penned his reply.
</p><p>
<em>Deputy Headmistress McGonagall,...</em>
</p><p> </p><p>¹Jason wasn't the one who taught her that. Jason was not in the business of teaching small children to build bombs.</p>
