  <em>February 1996, Hogwarts, Scotland</em>
</p><p>"Ready?"</p><p>Harry Potter had never been less ready in his life. He gulped and nodded.</p><p>"Go on, then. Have your part in my amazing success."</p><p>If it was going to be a success. Harry stuffed the owl feather into the small vial and watched it dissolve in the pink liquid. It turned lilac.</p><p>"Are you sure it's safe?" he asked hesitantly, lifting the vial to his lips.</p><p>"Safe enough. Drink up."</p><p>The potion tasted a bit like burned scrambled eggs. And butterbeer. And... chilli? It was tastier than Harry remembered, but still not even close to something he would consume willingly. However, he didn't have much time to ponder the taste; a warm bubble erupted in his stomach and licked its way up into his throat. Warmth became scorching heat and he coughed, grabbing at his throat...</p><p>"Ca--"</p><p>The horrible burning disappeared, leaving light tingling in its place. Feathers sprouted from Harry's skin and his mouth turned into a beak. He didn't have arms anymore, but wings. Robes ripped across his rounded middle, glasses slipped down what used to be his face.</p><p>Harry Potter was now a beautiful, brown owl. Except he kept his usual size.</p><p>"I'm pretty sure owls don't grow this huge."</p><p>Harry was sure too. But as a six feet tall owl, there was nothing he could do but hope he wasn't going to stay that way forever. Madam Pomfrey was sure going to figure something out. How were they going to explain it to her, though?</p><p>He found himself wishing for a Time-Turner like Hermione's, to go back in time to the summer and convince himself he didn't really need that glass of water.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>August 1995, 12 Grimmauld Place, London</em>
</p><p>The first thing he saw was a cloud of smoke. Then a worn, grey trainer and a skinny calf resting against the edge of the kitchen table. If Harry had been a little less sleepy, he would've realized that the person definitely wasn't Mundungus Fletcher.</p><p>"Hey Dung," he said, pushing past him to the cupboards.</p><p>"Hey Walter."</p><p>Harry stopped with his hand halfway up toward the cupboard. Something was wrong.</p><p>"I'm not Walter."</p><p>Or at least he wasn’t when he was going to sleep this evening and surely his name couldn't have changed. Harry rubbed the scar on his forehead to make sure he was still himself. The gesture woke him up.</p><p>"I'm not Dung."</p><p>A small cough followed. Harry turned around to look at the source of husky, but most probably female voice. He saw a piece of parchment, skinny fingers and - after a few nervous movements of the parchment in the smoke - the rest of the person.</p><p>She reminded Harry of a stick insect. Every part of her body was long, impossibly skinny and brown. Deep set, huge eyes squinted at him suspiciously. And she looked young, around his age, too young to be in the Order. </p><p>"Right," he mumbled. "Who are you, then?"</p><p>The girl removed a small, black pipe from her mouth and held out her right hand.</p><p>"Catherine Grayson. And you're Harry Potter."</p><p>Harry decided it was unnecessary to ask where she knew him from. He took the hand and shook it. The forearm above it was wrapped in a slightly bloodied rag.</p><p>"Are you..." he stopped, unsure how to phrase his question. "This isn't a regular house."</p><p>"I've noticed."</p><p>Harry pinched the inside of his hand. The girl was still there. A young witch he didn't know was at 12 Grimmauld Place and she seemed perfectly real. He reached backwards for his wand but obviously, it was still laying on his nightstand, upstairs.</p><p>"So." Catherine fell back onto her chair. "Why are you awake at 2am?"</p><p>"I wanted a glass of water-- No, what are you doing here?"</p><p>Should he call Sirius? It was his house, after all. </p><p>“Waiting for Sturgis. He’s in a meeting.”</p><p>“Sturgis Podmore?” Harry frowned, cautiously stepping closer. “You know him?”</p><p>“Quite well. He’s my uncle.”</p><p>They didn’t look related, Harry thought. Sturgis was quite small, blond and full of smiles; Catherine was tall, dark and brooding, and something about her face reminded Harry of the sphinx. His thoughts spun out of control, jumping from the labyrinth to the graveyard, disappearing in a merciless flash of green. He gasped and shook his head to get rid of the image.</p><p>“Potter?”</p><p>Harry realised he’d closed his eyes; when he opened them, Catherine was standing next to him, getting a glass out of a cupboard.</p><p>“You’re in London,” she said, pouring some tap water into the glass. “Safe. Sit down and drink your water.”</p><p>It was a sensible piece of advice. Harry accepted the glass and sat down in one of the chairs. Were his thoughts really so obvious? Was he going to experience something similar back in Hogwarts… let’s say, in Potions class? He imagined Malfoy and Snape making fun of him and winced. This had to stop.</p><p>“How long have you been having nightmares?” Catherine asked. She’d put out her pipe and was now rubbing it against her t-shirt.</p><p>“Why do you think I have nightmares?”</p><p>“The things you’ve been through are a good enough reason.”</p><p>Catherine grabbed a backpack from under the chair and started to go through its pockets until she fished out a wooden box. She opened it and produced a small bottle full of pink liquid.</p><p>“You can have it if you want,” she said, pushing the bottle across the table towards Harry. He raised an eyebrow.</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>“A Dreamless Sleep Potion. An updated version.”</p><p>“Never heard of it.”</p><p>“Plausible. I invented it. The screw is also a glass. Drink one before bed until the nightmares disappear.”</p><p>Harry cast a proper, distrustful look at the bottle. How could he know it was safe? He did have nightmares and they were unpleasant, but if the alternative was death as a result of drinking someone’s failed experiment, Harry preferred the sleepless nights.</p><p>“It’s safe,” Catherine spoke, a hint of amusement in her voice. “I test everything on myself.”</p><p>“I’ve just met you, it’s not very reassuring,” Harry muttered. A door upstairs opened and he could hear hushed voiced and steps. Catherine’s pipe disappeared in the pocket of her backpack.</p><p>“Cathy? Professor Snape will be here in a moment, he wants to… Oh.” Sturgis Podmore entered the kitchen, his head as usual a proud design of an experienced thatcher. He smiled brightly. Harry barely responded, too terrified by his announcement. “Hi Harry. I see you’ve met my niece.”</p><p>“Yeah." Harry stood up, clearing his throat. The last thing he needed now was bumping into Snape. “Uh… I think I’m finally getting sleepy…”</p><p>“You should be.” Sturgis nodded. “It’s pretty late.”</p><p>"It was nice to meet you,” Harry said, more out of desire not to offend Sturgis. Catherine was pleasant enough, but she lacked the warm cordiality of her uncle or the Weasleys. In fact, she reminded him a bit of Mad-Eye Moody, and given that the only version of Moody he knew was a Death Eater in disguise, it wasn’t a welcoming thought.</p><p>“That’s okay." She snatched back the bottle. It went in the same pocket as the pipe. "See you at school, Harry.”</p><p>“Sure. Bye.”</p><p>“Put a jacket on,” Harry heard Sturgis grumble as he walked around the table to get to the door. “It’s cold in here.”</p><p>There was a sigh.</p><p>“Nothing’s cold after Alaska, Sturgis.”</p>
