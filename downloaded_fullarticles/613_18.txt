          <div class="userstuff"><p>Harry awoke with a groan as his bunkmate jumped to the ground in a frantic hustle, he must’ve overslept for class again. The room smelled of warm and stagnant morning breath with undertones of body odor. Cramming a bunch of Gryffindor teen boys into one room was bound to create a disgusting cocktail of smells, but really anything beats living in a cramped broom closet.</p><p>Now that Harry had been rudely forced awake, rather than snoozing his alarm clock for ten more minutes he decided to put an effort into making himself look moderately presentable for his Divination course. Harry normally woke up roughly ten to fifteen minutes before the class started and rushed his way through the cold stone hallways to the other side of the castle. He just had little to no interest in Divination magic even if the professor was interesting enough to hold his attention. Harry didn’t have the so-called ‘Third Eye’ that one truly needs to possess for this course to hold any lasting worth. Harry would rather be putting his efforts in courses like Defense Against the Dark Arts but that comes later in his education. </p><p>Harry moved his stiff legs to hang off the side of his bed pondering on whether he wanted to change his undergarments or not. He ultimately decided against searching through his cluttered bedside-closet. Peeling off his sweaty nightwear he haphazardly dressed in his school uniform that had a lovely brown stain adorning the collar. Ron had kindly given him an ever so dramatic rendition of his latest failed potions assignment that had coffee spewing from his mouth. </p><p>Lovely. Harry had thought to himself. He was a slob at times but this was a bit too embarrassing. Aside from Professor Trelawney’s unorthodox teaching methods in the Arts of Divination course, Harry had found himself glancing over at his desk partner more and more often days passed. </p><p>Luna Lovegood, a girl with bright eyes that only seemed to accentuate her aberrant sense of style. Harry often wondered how she could get away with her various fandangles that she liked to add to her Ravenclaw robes. As odd and divergent from the average Hogwarts’ scholar, as she is, Harry found her alluring. Out of pure interest in her character or something else, he couldn’t quite pinpoint the origin of his attraction.</p><p>After coming to terms with his underwhelming appearance in the cracked mirror of the boy's dormitory, Harry started his now routine walk to his class, now only having about ten minutes to make it to the other side of the ancient citadel. The stone walls and assorted floor-to-wall glass windows made the hallways of Hogwarts unnaturally cold during the Winter semester. Snow has yet to mask the school grounds, Harry is not sure he’ll be able to pull himself away from his warm bed for this Divination course once the white crystal snow decides to fall. Harry grumbles to himself while rubbing at the goosebumps that have formed on the top of his wrists. </p><p>With heavy breaths, Harry opened the heavier wooden door to the classroom. Professor Trelawney glanced at him briefly before continuing to pass out teacups and dishes of tea leaves to each desk couple. </p><p>Apparently we’re doing some tea nonsense today? Great, I definitely won’t be able to stay awake today.</p><p>While muttering negative nothings to himself he manages to make eye contact with the aforementioned Ravenclaw. Harry’s heart pulled tightly somewhere deep in his chest, cheeks warming up. It felt like Luna was staring through him, not looking at him, maybe analyzing him? Whatever was happening was making Harry feel exposed in an odd way. It always felt like Luna knew exactly was going through Harry’s head despite them not being well-acquainted outside of class.</p><p>“Harry? Come sit, we have an interesting assignment to explore today. Did you read the homework packet?” Luna chirped while grabbing at Harry’s icy hands and pulling him to his assigned seat situated immediately to Luna’s left. Luna’s lingering touch left Harry feeling dizzy.</p><p>“U-um” fuck, his voice certainly just cracked. Harry wondered why he was so nervous, it’s just Luna, weird, strange, and lovely-</p><p>Harry might be whipped.</p><p>“I’m sorry, I forgot to read the packet. Today was supposed to be a lab, wasn’t it? I completely forgot. I couldn’t detach Ron from my side yesterday, he was next level clingy. I couldn’t find the time to do the reading.” Harry faked a laugh in an attempt to hide the fact that he is going through some kind of internal turmoil over his feelings for Luna Lovegood. </p><p>“Oh, I see. That Ron kid is something else, huh?” she giggles quietly in her soft voice. Fuck, maybe she’s kinda cute. “Well, today we’re attempting Tessomancy, predicting the future by use of tea leaves. The leaves can be very vague but it gives the curious querent a glimpse into their near future. I think it’s pretty neat…” she trails off a bit at the end of her thought.</p><p>“Today’s lab is supposed to be short, so let’s attempt taking a glance into your future? If that’s okay. I’m wary about meddling in predictions of my own. I’d rather stay ignorant.” Luna says as she places some of the loose black tea leaves at the bottom of the teacup. She moves Harry’s hands to sit on either side of the teacup and explains “In order for this to work properly, I need you to focus on a clear and concise question in your head to ask the leaves.” </p><p>A clear and concise question? Harry thinks to himself for a moment. He decides on asking what the next four years will hold for him in the way of major events. Harry knew he was destined for ill-fated circumstances, so he wasn’t really worried about what he might see, rather, he was interested in seeing if anything positive may be awaiting him. </p><p>“Okay, I have my question” Harry confirms and Luna begins pouring the hot water in a swirling motion from the teapot that Professor Trelawney had left on their desk. </p><p>“As the water cools, you’ll need to continue thinking about your question while you sip, but you should leave just about one tablespoon of water at the bottom.” With that Harry blows at the steaming liquid, Luna’s stares and her glowing demeanor is proving to be quite distracting. With unsteady hands, Harry sips at the tea trying to avoid swallowing any of the loose black tea leaves. The tea doesn’t taste much of anything, just like sipping hot water, not that Harry really minded. It just feels a bit awkward to be doing something like this as a lab. </p><p>Professor Trelawney was going on about something at the front of the classroom while carefully observing the students work their way through the lab. No one really listens to her, she’s always saying something. She makes a comment in the direction of Harry and Luna. </p><p>“You both are doing so well, truly natural-born seers I am sure.” The comment feels more directed towards Luna, but it is nice to hear words of affirmation. Harry doesn’t hear many good things about his wizarding skills outside of this course. Professor Trelawney might be too kind. Nevertheless, Harry was thankful for the kind words and Luna’s face seemed to be beaming from the compliment so that’s a plus too.<br/>
Gosh, why do I keep thinking like that?</p><p>Harry had finished drinking most of the liquid and looked to Luna for further instruction. Luna turned the page of the homework packet to make sure she was following the directions correctly and with a self-reassuring hum, she explained the next step.</p><p>“Okay, from here you need to hold the cup in your left hand and swirl the remaining liquid three times from left to right” Harry followed Luna’s instructions, “Then you need to hold the cup upside down above the saucer for about a minute, and remember to concentrate on your question as well.” Harry’s hand is shaking slightly from lactic acid build up in his bicep from holding the cup in place for a minute. “Okay, please rotate the cup upside down three more times before turning it upright with the handle pointed south which is in the direction of the classroom exit according to Professor Trelawney.”</p><p>“Damn, this is quite a process. I hope I am doing okay.” Harry laughs again trying to fill the awkward air with something other than stares and lab instruction. </p><p>“You’re doing fine, don’t worry too much,” Luna reassures Harry and his chest does that thing again. These feelings are new and confusing and sudden. Harry really doesn’t know what to do. He looks down at the bottom of the teacup but can’t really make out anything, in particular, it just looks like a bunch of soggy tea bits. With a shrug, Harry looks over to Luna for guidance in deciphering whatever the tea leaves are trying to tell him. </p><p>“Interesting…” Luna trails off again to herself. “I can make out a few different things, but don’t take my word for anything. I’ve only done this a few times.” She tries to explain and Harry gives an awkward “It’s okay, don’t worry about it” in response. </p><p>“Okay, so I see a sorta cross which could indicate that trials and suffering await for you” although the content is seemingly dark Luna delivers the information blankly with no indication of concern or worry. Almost like she already knew. “I also see something that resembles a sun, pretty straightforward, but it usually indicates happiness or the feeling of being content in something. So it’s a bit confusing, it appears you will suffer at some point in your future but you will, in the end, have happiness.” She says matter-of-factly.</p><p>“Somehow I feel a little bit relieved by that, to be honest, I was expecting worse. At least I know I have something to look forward to at the end of whatever bad things come my way.” Harry tries to fake a smile but his effort falls through.</p><p>Luna looks to the cup again, “I also see something here on the edge that looks like an angel” she shows Harry and continues her explanation, “an angel indicates the possibility of a growing love that will last indefinitely, I think that is pretty positive. It seems you’ll meet someone who will treat your heart kindly.” Luna’s eyes look sad at that, Harry can’t help but wonder why. Something deep inside himself urges him to say something, anything, why does he always stand around and wait for things to come his way. He should start acting on things he’s passionate about, start taking chances without thinking too much about what is expected of him. Enough with the prophecies.</p><p>Harry turns his body in Luna’s direction, heart racing, and a blush deepening on the highpoints of his cheeks. Without thinking he grabs her hands while keeping his gaze on his bouncing knees. Harry slowly lifts his chin, adjusting his glasses to make eye contact with Luna. Her facial expression hasn’t changed. She wears the same curious and bright exterior. </p><p>“Luna I-”</p><p>Harry’s left elbow makes a graceless scrap against the teacup and its soppy contents seep into the front of Harry uniform slacks, promptly decorating them with an unattractive wet pattern. Face flaming with embarrassment, Harry stands with his eyes directed at the floor as he makes a quick race for the exit of the classroom.</p><p>“Harry, please wait!” Luna tries but is met with the disappointing slam of the classroom door. Luna has an idea of what Harry was intending to ask but it seems as though the question was not in the cards for this universe. Luna’s heartaches, she knows she can never be anything more than she already is to Harry. </p><p>-End-</p></div>
