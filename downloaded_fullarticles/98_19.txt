    <p>Micah was laughing at him. </p><p>It had become normal these days to hear the laughter of the man who sat beside him. He never imagined therapy could be so hands-on in all his life. </p><p>The Blood Drinker’s Clan was what Draco would call a <em> Hot Mess </em>. </p><p>Literally. Just no other way to go about it. It was a mess, and he’d spent the last six hours sitting in Jean-Claude’s study beneath the Circus with one of his three boyfriends seeing to each and every pard member. Gabriel had to have been a worse leader than even Voldemort. At least Voldemort’s followers could defend themselves.  </p><p>All of them had crawled on their hands and knees toward him the moment they entered, and more than a few tried to go for his crotch or straddle his lap. Some even offered themselves for stress relief, Harry had to spend a good half hour each convincing them that the three men in his life was enough, and no, please don’t cry because that didn’t mean he thought they were unworthy. He thought they were all important to him. He told them that. He wanted them to be happy and <em> healthy </em>. Micah hadn’t helped him one bit. He just sat there trying to conceal his laughter, but his eyes. Those damn beautiful chartreuse leopard eyes were filled to the brim with laughter. Harry felt that he had left the pard more confused than ever. </p><p>Nathaniel Graison was the youngest in the pard, and had no concept of saying no. Harry told them they were free to go about their lives, and that he was always available to them should they be in need. Gregory had taken to him well. He still lived at Harry’s house with Stephen who came and went often enough.</p><p>It was March, the mass winter was slowly evaporating, and in its place spring had arrived. It was new and fresh and somehow because a groundhog didn’t see its shadow last month it meant they were getting an early spring. </p><p>Harry didn’t understand it. Draco had spent an hour trying to explain. Harry would never get it, and once again Micah would roll around laughing out of nowhere. Harry was beginning to think the man had a bad sense of humor if he thought Harry was funny. </p><p>He assured everyone he wasn’t that funny. </p><p>The only thing Harry had managed to accomplish through each of the sessions with his pard members was to ask them what their dream was, and get them thoughtful. Most of them didn’t have an answer. Some of them were completely confused, and one of them quite literally shoved a hand down his trousers as if they couldn’t get anymore obvious. Micah was still laughing. Harry took the manila folder and whacked him over the head as the door cracked. One in particular named Zane liked rubbing up against him, and Harry had spent an hour trying to keep the man’s hands to himself. Oh, and his mouth. </p><p>“My my,” Jean-Claude purred. “It is nice to hear such laughter in my office.” </p><p>“I’m sorry! “ Micah hollered as he doubled over. “It’s hilarious to me that,” he took a gulp, “that Harry here can still turn red when he’s propositioned.” </p><p>Jean-Claude folded his arms over his gleaming white chest, his frothy lace making him look like the devil without a disguise. His curly black hair folded around him with an elegant grace that Harry didn’t even bother asking how he managed anymore. Harry would never know. “It is a dashing sight I agree.” </p><p>“Look, I get the cuddles and all, and I’m okay with that, but I don’t want someone shoving their hands down my trousers or trying to sit on my lap.” Or Merlin forbid, suck his cock. He didn’t need that right now with how horny he was.  </p><p>One look at Micah’s face and anyone would think he was a beautiful and angelic man with the most delicate features. Until they got to his wide shoulders, perfect V, and if they were really lucky a glimpse at his fine cock that even when flaccid you knew was a big boy. </p><p>Micah was perfection in a box, and if he was perfection you can imagine what Jean-Claude standing there too was like. A stately marble of masculine loveliness, and how he did it with froth, lace, and long perfect hair, Harry would never know. His midnight eyes always stared as though they were digging through you. </p><p>Edward was away on business. He was the one who came and went. He always popped around though, even made a stop when Valentine’s day came, Harry had made him a personal armory. </p><p>Lately, the three of them had been spending more time together, curious about the phenomenon of power that coursed through them at odd times. Sometimes, whenever Harry touched Micah or Jean-Claude a strange burn would settle between them. Electricity, wind, and a flame would burn hotly as if dancing through their veins. Until they understood it, they all agreed to abstain from sex. Including Harry and Micah, which wasn’t easy when the wereleopard lived with him. Jean-Claude was still working on discovering what the power really meant. </p><p>It reminded Harry of the Priori Incantatem that he and Voldemort had cast in his fourth year. The rolling golden power circling them, except no one was coming out of wands and Harry wasn’t trying to get away alive. </p><p>“It is to be expected, mon Amour. I did warn you of their obsessive need to please their newest Nimir-Ra,” said Jean-Claude in what he must have thought was a kind face, but instead it just made him look devious. “Gabriel had them trained, and not in the way of defense.” </p><p>Nimir-Ra meant Queen of the leopards. Micah was the Nimir-Raj, but not officially. He had unfinished business and his own Pard to protect. But, he was always by Harry’s side helping him where he could. Why Harry had been given the feminine title, he was never going to understand; but all the leopards agreed that Micah was Harry’s Nimir-Raj. </p><p>Harry’s only direct order was that they were not allowed to hurt anyone, unless it was self defense, or star in any of Raina’s films without his expressed permission. When pushed on the subject, Harry finally came outright and stated that anyone found doing so would be severely punished. </p><p>It seemed that outside of prostitution and working for Jean-Claude at Guilty Pleasures most of the pard had been forbidden from getting jobs. Most couldn’t even drive. All of them had been clearly dependent on Gabriel and others. Harry had promptly enrolled all interested in driving school and covered the costs of it. He’d also bought the house that once belonged to Elvira Drew for his pard members, and most of them had taken up residence there. It helped that there weren’t many of them. The wereleopards were a rare bunch, as the virus wasn’t as contagious as the rat and wolf variation. </p><p>Nathaniel switched between Harry’s house and the Circus, much like Stephen and Gregory. All three danced at Guilty Pleasures, and so it made the most sense. Teddy had also taken to Nathaniel and vice versa. </p><p>Speaking of Teddy, he was visiting his grandmother for a few days. Harry had been leery about it at first, but Andy had called up crying and saying that she’d been missing him. Micah, Edward, Jean-Claude, and Harry had debated the finer points of allowing it before coming to an agreement. Hermione, who had gone back to Britain to see her parents before the spring semester began in college, promised to pop in to check on them. Harry fire-called them every evening like clockwork and if he couldn’t you bet Micah was there or even Nathaniel and Draco a time or two. Andy had been stunned when she saw Micah for the first time when he sent a leopard stuffed animal through the Floo for Teddy who had been missing it. </p><p>Jean-Claude sashayed closer with an eye gazing sway of his hips. The sensuality of it was such that the crackling buzz of power began to hum, causing all three to go quiet as it bounced like a ball between them. </p><p>No sex was hard to live by these days, Harry thought; aware of the brush down his arm from Micah. It also didn’t help that all of the pard members liked to cuddle him and rub against his thighs, even when they weren’t trying to be sexual. </p><p>Micah let out a low snarl that he didn’t mean, and Jean-Claude’s eyes turned more vampiric as Harry drew back and gripped a hand to his bicep while folding his arms across his chest in resistance. Jean-Claude had likened them being able to touch a few months back to whatever power this was being so new, and Harry’s need for them being great enough to dampen it. He wasn’t sure that truely covered it, but they were running with it. </p><p>Edward had thought the whole situation was downright hilarious. He hadn’t been any help. He wasn’t in on the power situation that was going on between them, but he sure enjoyed torturing them. </p><p>It was sad that the last time Harry had actual sex was with a fully transformed werewolf. Jean-Claude and Micah liked to pick on poor Jason these days for it. Who knew that Micah could be just a little bit vengeful at the idea that Jason had taken Harry while fully transformed. </p><p>“I am going to gather that the pard can smell you,” said Micah with a deep breath. “God knows I can.” He looked away at this. Harry shifted in his seat, and tried not to jolt when Jean-Claude reached out to touch both of them. </p><p>Harry let out a breath. “It’s a good thing I have the dead to raise tonight,” he said checking the time with smoky white rings of wandless magic. He stood right then, and shifted to gather his things. He was aware of the heavy eyed stare from both men, and how Micah leaned forward to press his nose to Harry’s shirt and not quite his skin. If only to get some smell off him. He sighed longingly, and pulled back. </p><p>It was almost midnight and St. Patrick’s Day. He was meeting Larry at Foretree Cemetery. He was dressed all in green. If Jean-Claude couldn’t have him, Jean-Claude had decided that he would dress him, every day. In his own way, no matter what. </p><p>He was in a pair of tight clover green hip-hugging jeans with a nice boot-cut for his dragon hide boots that gave him good incline, and a lighter green snug long-sleeved shirt that sometimes seemed to shimmer and it had white criss-cross ties up and down the arms to the shoulder with tiny green eyelids. Jean-Claude insisted it enhanced his frame. Harry thought it was silly. Micah only laughed at them both.  </p><p>It wasn’t Harry’s style as he preferred simple, but Jean-Claude has become obsessive compulsive lately. He was feeding more and more on the energy at his club because a time or two, he’d knocked Micah and Harry out with a strong wave of lust if he lost even a modicum of his six hundred year control. He had a black belt around his waist with all his hidden goodies of weapons and the like.</p><p>Micah reached for Harry’s soft salt and pepper gray jacket. He brought it to him to smell for a moment before sighing again and handing it over. </p><p>“I better go too before we kill each other,” Micah grunted. </p><p>“I’ll drop you off.” </p><p>Jean-Claude pursed his lips. “I hope I get an answer back about this phenomenon.” </p><p>“We do too,” said Harry quietly. Micah started adjusting the collar of Harry’s jacket if only to have something to do. Both were careful about not touching each other too much as it brought great stress to both of them. It was manageable at first, but then it would build causing a rush of power to overwhelm them. </p><p>All three stood in a strange triangle, Jean-Claude’s fingers were digging into his bicep. Harry took a breath as Micah let go and he quickly pecked Jean-Claude on the chin. </p><p>It was as much as they dared, and even that caused a humming vibration across their skin, so much so that Jean-Claude took a deep human breath, his eyes closing. “Go, mon Amour, mon Chaton!” </p><p>“Go feed at your club.” Harry made to lay a hand on Jean-Claude only to pause when the power began to sizzle. He drew back apologetically. </p><p>Jean-Claude could only nod as he clenched his jaw, and he remained standing in place as Harry and Micah swept passed him.  </p><p>The air current didn’t subside until Micah and Harry stepped outside into the midnight black, and Micah spent his time fishing through the radio stations looking for something and at the same time nothing. Micah swept a hand through his soft brown hair. Harry side-eyed him as he kept most of his gaze on the road. </p><p>Harry was soon turning into the drive, and both of them reached to kiss only to stop halfway. Micah stared into his eyes. “Sorry.” </p><p>“Don’t be,” Harry whispered kissing the man on his slightly crooked nose. You’d never notice it unless you were up close. He had a broken nose that was still trying to fix itself. Harry didn’t know the exact circumstances of how it came about just yet, but he was waiting on Micah to tell him. “I’ll be home later.” </p><p>“M’k.” Micah slipped out, and jogged up to the house with his keys in hand. Harry had made copies for all of his men so that they would have an easier time coming and going. Harry watched him from the back. He was wearing a deep green jumper, and since it had been laundry day he’d borrowed Edward’s jeans. Harry sighed and backed out of the drive, and swirled down the lane. </p><p>He shut off the radio, and settled back. He had some raising to do. Larry was providing the chickens. Two and a half hours later, Larry was sheepishly rubbing his red hair as he apologized to Harry. </p><p>“You are so lucky that I know magic,” said Harry waving his hand causing the splashing stain of blood to vanish. Jean-Claude, with the way he’d been lately, would have a field day if he saw Harry bloodied. He might also become a bit ravenous as there were times when Harry was around that Jean-Claude would hold his breath. </p><p>Larry had accidentally let the chicken loose with its head cut off causing it to do a merry dance around the headstone spraying everyone with blood including the cranky lawyer, which had been the best part. “I am so sorry!” </p><p>“I should make you go home and change, but I’m in a right mood,” said Harry, waving his hand making the blood vanish from the black clothes Larry had on. </p><p>“I have noticed you’ve been more sarcastic lately,” said Larry as he helped Harry pack everything away. </p><p>“No kidding,” Harry sighed. </p><p>He was only thankful that there hadn’t been anything going on the past couple of months otherwise he’d have to deal with Dolph and Zerbrowski too. Dolph had witnessed Harry being carried out by a partially shifted Micah, naked with only a shirt for modesty. Beside him had been Jean-Claude and Edward. Oh, Harry meant Ted Forrester, a bounty hunter. He never did explain why he was mostly naked to the police, and he wasn’t about to. Richard and Jason had ran off into the woods so they weren’t questioned. Garroway was rather nice about it, probably because seeing Harry without much clothes on got his Papa Bear instincts running, and decided not to talk about it or mention it. He was probably ashamed for not having noticed the scheme Aikensen and Titus were pulling either. Harry silently thanked him for it. </p><p>Yeah, Harry’s life became complicated in such a quick way, and to think December had been so full of hot-sex. </p><p>But then January arrived. Harry had tried to have sex with Micah only for the power to pulse to the point that they couldn’t stay touching without burning or jolting the other. He tried to do the same with Jean-Claude only for both of them to end up swept in a current that terrified them. </p><p>Oh, and then there was February. All things love blooming in the air, but not for Harry. He, Jean-Claude, and Micah had sat around the office in Guilty Pleasures staring at each other and not moving as the energy flew like a lasso between the three of them. Harry had hoped for a lap dance, but Jean-Claude had actually been too terrified to move.</p><p>At first, Harry didn’t see this as any big deal. He went without sex for twenty-three years, and had been more than fine with it. But now? Heh. </p><p>Edward was not really the flowers and roses kind of man, and since he thought the situation between Harry, Micah, and Jean-Claude was funny enough he went along with it as if he was involved. So, no sex from the only one who could give it. </p><p>Edward had sent him a nice 9mm Ruger SR9C semi-automatic with a note telling him that it wouldn’t kill two in one, and to make use of it. It had silver coated glazer rounds accompanying it. He still didn’t understand why there were was an emerald green flat-stoned rock in the envelope, but kept it anyway. He had placed it on a shelf with one of the white feathers that Edward had given him as a souvenir of roasted immortal chicken. </p><p>“Just frustrated these days.” </p><p>Larry turned to him in concern. “It’s not me is it? I know I’ve messed up a bit-’ </p><p>“Not you at all, believe me,” said Harry clasping his shoulder. “You’re doing great. You’re able to raise three and sometimes four zombies a night. I wouldn’t even be able to manage four these days. Careful with Bert, he’ll put you to work.” </p><p>Larry grinned. “Really?” He looked proud, and Harry thought he should be. He tilted his head thoughtfully. “You want to talk about it?” </p><p>Harry shook his head. “Nah. It’s okay, but thanks Larry. I don’t think you really want to hear about personal details.” </p><p>“I don’t mind, really!” </p><p>“You know I like men?” Harry asked carefully as they walked across the rolling hills of the cemetery. It was called Foretree because of all the tall ash trees. It was nice that the city had tried something new and preserved most of them or transplanted them as best as they could. “Some don’t care for that.” </p><p>“I kind of gathered that. I don’t care.” </p><p>“Most don’t these days. Most are more interested in the supernatural, and if they have rights then why not the rest of the populace? Hopefully.” Congress seemed to be more and more in debate lately about what was considered a right and a privilege. Harry didn’t even think these things should be up for discussion. It was common decency after all, but since when has the world known decency?</p><p>Like the magical world, the supernatural world didn’t really look at gender too hard. Most of them could boast a good amount of fluidness, and because of the initial cruelty of entering that kind of world they had to cling to something. A lot of ways to get around the whole children aspect, they also didn’t use religion as a backbone and an excuse. </p><p>“Only the narrow minded out there will still have issue. So, you want to talk about it?” </p><p>“Nope because then I have to think harder about it, and it’ll make me miserable!” </p><p>Larry laughed and was about to say something when Harry’s cell rang. He sighed, and part of him wished Draco had never given him the damn thing. He used it for business only, no pleasure calls as Edward warned him that cells weren’t safe. </p><p>“Hello?” He asked, flipping it open. </p><p>“Harry?” </p><p>“Bert? What are you doing up at two in the morning?” Harry asked once again bringing up smoky rings to check the time. </p><p>Larry arched an eyebrow. “Do we have another?”  </p><p>“Money never sleeps, Harry. I need you to come to the office and look at something I left on your desk. Once you’ve done that come talk to me.” </p><p>That made no sense. “What’s with the secrecy, Bert?” </p><p>“Just do it, and I’ll explain.” </p><p>Harry sighed. He had hoped to get home and crawl in the warm comfy bed next to Micah. Most of winter had evaporated, but there were still some shivery damp nights, and sometimes Harry thought the beginning of spring was worse than winter because of the false warmth in the day and frigid temperatures at night. “Okay. You better have good coffee brewing if I’m going to be there.” </p><p>“Already on.” As they hung up, Larry arched an eyebrow. </p><p>“Come in now? No one’s there!” </p><p>“I have no idea. If this is another multi-millionaire wanting something sketchy, he can forget about it.” </p><p>The two of them parted for their own vehicles, and Harry headed to Animators. He was pleased to see the entrance was lit up even if it was empty. Craig had left, and it would be a few hours before Mary came on for her morning shift. He grabbed his Christmas mug that was still in his office once he got upstairs, eyeing the flat yellow envelope on his desk with trepidation. He filled the mug and tasted the coffee. It wasn’t too bad. Bert was kind enough to get them good coffee considering their nightly work hours. He wanted them at their best after all. </p><p>Harry sank down, hands on either side of the envelope. What on earth could be in it? Well, he’d never know until he looked. He broke the seal, and pulled out a plethora of photographs. It was a large stack of 8x10 glossy photographs. He began to flip through them as he settled back with a cross of his legs. The first picture was of a hill that had been scraped open by a bulldozer. A skeletal hand reached out from the raw red earth, and in the next showed someone had tried to carefully scrape away the dirt, showing a splintered coffin and bones to one side of the coffin. </p><p>A newer body. Someone had dug up a cemetery, Harry thought with a roll of his eyes. He could read the underlying layers of what was going on already. Someone wanted this land for something that wasn’t a graveyard. </p><p>More plowed up red earth revealed a large boneyard. It was almost artistic, Harry thought as he flipped to the next to see one skull with pale hair still clinging. It’s jaw was unhinged and it looked like something Harry would see in a haunted attraction. A dark stained cloth wrapped around the corpse in a remnant of a dress. He spotted at least three femurs next to the upper half of a skull. Unless the corpse had three legs, Harry was looking at a real mess. </p><p>Nothing but photographs, nothing else to explain why Bert thought it was so important. Surely, this could have waited until noon? </p><p>Harry smelled money. Some rich guy wanted this cleaned up as soon as possible. But, would that even be possible? If this was sacred ground it would be illegal. If this boneyard belonged to an old family it wasn’t allowed to be relinquished without permission. </p><p>If there was one thing Harry had learned in his short amount of years animating, was that rich business people didn’t like hiccups, they didn’t like to wait. It sounded judgy, Harry tried not to be too judgy about things, but it was hard when Harold Gaynor left a nasty aftertaste in his mouth. </p><p>Maybe it was a Native American burial ground? All those were sacred, they weren’t allowed to be disturbed. As soon as it was uncovered whoever was digging had to step away, and could no longer touch it. </p><p>Maybe they needed Harry for confirmation of what they were, but surely they could get an anthropologist. He’d heard there was a famous one in Washington at the Jefferson Institute who would gladly come out and put the puzzle together. She would probably cost less too. So, it wasn’t Native American. </p><p>He slipped the photographs back into their place, and stood with his coffee. He tucked the envelope under his arms and headed out to Bert’s office. </p><p>Bert’s office door was wide open, which was new. He sat behind his desk, drinking coffee, and shuffling papers around. Bert glanced up and smiled, motioning Harry closer. Harry was already on guard because Bert was never pleasant unless he was up to something. </p><p>His thousand dollar suit framed a white-on-white shirt and tie. His grey eyes sparkled with good cheer. His snow-blond hair had been freshly buzzed. He looked like what Draco might look if he let himself go a bit. The expensive suit hid all his flaws. At least he thought so. </p><p>“Have a seat, Harry!” </p><p>Harry placed the envelope of photos down. “What are you up to, Bert? If this is a sacred ground, no amount of money will see it disturbed.” </p><p>“It’s already disturbed. Did you look at them?” </p><p>“Yes?” Harry sat down carefully as though there were nails beneath his chair. </p><p>“Could you raise them from the dead?” </p><p>Harry sipped at his coffee. “How old are they?” </p><p>“You couldn’t tell from the pictures?” </p><p>“High gloss is not reality. I might have been able to tell if you’d sent me normal photographs. You sent me prints that are worthy of being in an art museum. I’d have to be there.” </p><p>“Around two hundred years.” </p><p>Once upon a time, Harry would have flat-out said no because the age would require a human sacrifice, but ever since Harry had raised an entire cemetery with one human sacrifice, he was sure that he could do it without it. He wasn’t about to kill an elephant for bones though. “Most couldn’t…” </p><p>“Your powers must have grown because you didn’t include yourself,” Bert pointed out with satisfaction. </p><p>Harry sighed. “Yeah, I can. But, I didn’t see any headstones in the pictures. Do we have any names?” </p><p>“Why?” </p><p>Really, Bert. He was the idiot who started the company with just him and Manny. “How can you hang around a bunch of zombie-raisers for this many years and know so little about what we do?” </p><p>His smile slipped a little, the glow on his face was starting to fade. “Why do you need names?” </p><p>Why didn’t he want to give them? “You use names to call the zombie from the grave. Names are more important than you might think, Bert. It’s not just something that the living call one another and differentiate each other with. It’s part of the identity of that single person.” </p><p>“Without a name you can’t raise them?” </p><p>Harry felt like he was playing a game of Word Trap. “Maybe.” It was always safe. </p><p>“So, you can?” he pushed. </p><p>“Maybe. Maybe John could do it?” </p><p>Bert shook his head. “They don’t want John.” </p><p>Harry sighed, and finished the coffee. Over so soon, hm? “Who’s they?” </p><p>“Beadle, Beadle, Stirling, and Lowenstein.” </p><p>“Law firm.” Harry deadpanned. Of course. Law firm. If they didn’t have names, no one could claim liability if they rose something that shouldn’t have been risen. “Lay it out for me, Bert. No stalling.” </p><p>“Beadle, Beadle, Stirling, and Lowenstein have some clients building a plush resort in the mountains near Branson. A very exclusive resort. A place where the wealthy country stars that don’t own a house in the area can go to get away from the crowds. Millions of dollars are at stake.” </p><p><em> Boo for them, </em> Harry thought. “What’s the old cemetery have to do with it?” He had a feeling he knew, but he wanted to hear Bert say it. </p><p>“The land they’re building on was in dispute between two families. The courts decided the Kelly’s owned the land, and they were paid a great deal of money. The Bouvier family claimed it was their land, and there was a family plot on it to prove it. No one could find the cemetery.” </p><p>“They found it?” </p><p>“They found an old cemetery, but not necessarily the Bouvier family plot.” </p><p>Diplomacy. “So they want to raise the dead and ask who they are?” </p><p>“Exactly.” </p><p>Harry guessed he couldn’t see anything too bad about it. Unless one of the lawyers tried to get him to lie when it came out Bouvier. “I can raise a couple of the corpses in the coffins. Ask who they are. What happens if their surname is Bouvier?” </p><p>“They have to buy the land a second time. They think some of the corpses are Bouviers. That’s why they want all the bodies raised.” </p><p>All? Harry’s eyes widened. “You have to be kidding.” </p><p>He shook his head, looking pleased; because Merlin, how much was he going to get for this?  “Can you do it?” </p><p>Harry said nothing for a moment as he took the envelope again, and began to flip through them. “Bert, they’ve screwed this in every way possible. It’s a mass grave, thanks to the bulldozers. The bones are all mixed together. I’ve only read about one case of anyone raising a zombie from a mass grave. But they were calling a specific person. They had a name.” Harry sighed. “Without a name it may not be possible.” He thought he might be able to do it though. Maybe. </p><p>“But, you’re different, Harry. You have your kind of magic. Are you willing to try?” </p><p>Harry sat the stack on top of the desk as he stared at nothing. He wasn’t sure if he could, but it would be a good chance to try, and since Teddy was with Andy he wouldn’t have to worry about leaving him. </p><p>“I’ll try.” </p><p>“Wonderful.” </p><p>“Raising them a few every night is going to take weeks, even if I can do it.” He hesitated. “Maybe with John’s help it would be quicker.” He hated to offer John. Ever since he’d taken the man with him to see Guys and Dolls, John thought they were something, but Harry had been playing an avoidance game since then. </p><p>He was not interested in John Burke. </p><p>“It will cost them millions to delay that long,” said Bert. </p><p>“There’s no other way to do it.” </p><p>“You raised the Davidson’s entire family plot, including Great-Grandpa. You weren’t even supposed to raise him. You can raise more than one at a time.” </p><p>Harry shook his head. “I was showing off, and a little pissed at their remarks about how young I look! I don’t like being told I can’t do something that is my profession, so I did them one better, brought them all back. I figured it’d save them some money.” Lately, his age had been a bit of an issue. A lot of people thought he was sixteen or seventeen. No way did he look like he was a twenty-four year old man who could raise the dead.  </p><p>In fact, one woman had gone so far as to tell Harry that his face was too full and youthfully lush to be anything but a teenager. He still had that soft edge. Harry was like a slim willow tree, and exactly five, five, five with a point five because Harry wanted it there to sound good. He could get to five foot seven if he had the right boots. </p><p>Micah might look more feminine from the neck up, but Harry just looked young and his large almond green eyes often threw people off. Every woman asked him what kind of contacts he was wearing because no way could his color be normal or inherited. It had to be magic. </p><p>“You raised ten family members, Harry. They only asked for three.” </p><p>“Yeah.” </p><p>“So you can raise an entire cemetery in one night?” </p><p>“You’re crazy.” </p><p>“Can you do it?” </p><p>Death took no prisoners. It did not really matter how you died, Death’s only motivation is to collect when it came due, and when Harry had raised Harold Gaynor’s entire family cemetery some of them had been even older than two hundred. He wasn’t about to use a human this time though. Maybe he could borrow some power?  </p><p>“I don’t really know,” he answered finally. “If I had names, I could do it easier even with the mess.” </p><p>“That’s not a no,” he said eagerly. </p><p>“They must have offered you a bundle of money.” </p><p>He smiled. “We’re bidding on the project.” </p><p>“What?” Harry wasn’t sure he heard that right. </p><p>“They sent this package to us, the Resurrection Company in California, and the Essential Spark in New Orleans.” </p><p>“So what, the lowest bid gets it?” </p><p>“That was their plan,” said Bert smirking. </p><p> “What?” Harry asked carefully. He looked so happy with himself. </p><p>“Let me play it back to you. There are what, four animators in the entire country that could raise a zombie that old without a human sacrifice? You and John are two of them, and I’m including our once colleague Anita Blake, but she’s dropped off the radar, and then there’s Phillipa Freestone of the Resurrection in this.” </p><p>“Sounds right.” </p><p>“Could Phillipa raise without a name?” </p><p>“I don’t have any way of knowing that. John could. Maybe she could.” </p><p>“Could either she or John raise from the mass bones? Not the ones in the coffin?” </p><p>Harry sighed. “I don’t know.” </p><p>“Would either of them stand a chance of channeling enough power to raise the entire graveyard?” Harry hated it when Bert looked at him as though he were covered in money. He had this look of pure pride and glee that reminded him of a small child. </p><p>Harry thought about it logically.  “Anita could, but if she’s disappeared then she won’t be available. John couldn’t do it. I don’t think Phillipa is as good as John, so no, they couldn’t do it.” </p><p>Bert grinned like a wolf, and Harry should know. He’d gotten really comfy with wolves lately. “I’m going to up the bid.” </p><p>“Up the bid?” Harry laughed. “Seriously?” </p><p>“Nobody else can do it. Nobody but you. They tried treating this like any other construction problem. But there aren’t going to be any other bids, now are there? There is only one Harry Potter-Black after all. I’m going to take them to the cleaners.” </p><p>“Greedy.” </p><p>“You get a share of the fee, you know.” </p><p>“I know. What if I try and can’t raise them all in one night?” </p><p>“You’ll still be able to raise them all eventually, won’t you?” </p><p>“Yes.” He took the overdue Christmas mug. It had been made by Teddy, and so Bert had no problem with letting him keep it. “But, I wouldn’t spend that check until after I’ve done it. I’m going to go and get some sleep.” </p><p>“They want the bid this morning. If they accept our terms, they’ll fly you up in a private helicopter.” </p><p>Harry nodded. “Sounds like fun.” Maybe it would be a good idea. He could get away from the constant buzzing for a couple of days. “I’m going to bed.” He was up and heading for the door, and then he stopped. “Let me take Larry with me.” </p><p>“Why? If John can’t do it, then Larry certainly can’t.” </p><p>“Maybe not, but there are ways to combine power during a raising. If I can’t do it alone, maybe I can get a boost from our trainee.” </p><p>He was thoughtful. “Why not take John? Combined, you could do it.” </p><p>Harry rolled his eyes. “I doubt he would enjoy being pushed aside for me, again. You’d hate to face him and tell him that.” John’s only contention was that Harry was better than him at raising, and three times now Harry had been chosen over John if only for his skill. “Is this why we’re meeting in a cloak and dagger style? So you can save face?” Not to mention the man was still a bit persistent. John was as straight as the day was long, but he made an exception for Harry. </p><p>Why he did was anyone’s guess. </p><p>“No. Of course not, time is of the essence.” </p><p>“Right. You can’t face John Burke with yet another client that wants me over him. Give me Larry. It’s easy and simple. Besides, he’d learn a lot and may one day be better than me. It’s time you treat him like he can be.” </p><p>And if he had to deal with corporate lawyers and their shitty tactics, then Harry wanted the friendliest face he could find. Larry would do just nicely. </p>
