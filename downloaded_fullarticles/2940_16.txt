    <p>mornings in paris didn't seem to excite me anymore. opening my bedroom window, i could see the enormous eiffel tower which; didn't fascinate me anymore when i had been looking at it since i was born.</p>
<p>i tried searching for my diary underneath my clothes in my light mint coloured wardrobe, however it seemed to me that someone had run their hands there too, making my clothes look messy, not as arranged as they looked last night.</p>
<p>"ugh, mother," i groaned silently and rolled my eyes. i took my wand from my unmade bed.</p>
<p>"accio diary," i casted the spell and immediately, my diary flew inside from out of my bedroom. i believed it was in my parents' bedroom.</p>
<p>i wondered what were they curious about. maybe it was because of their decision of moving to england, leaving france. they knew that i loved beauxbatons, and that i loved my best friends here.</p>
<p>i took my silver quill and started writing a new entry for today. i called my diary 'lacie.'</p>
<p>'dear lacie..'</p>
<p>and it was just right at that moment when my parents called me downstairs for breakfast.</p>
<p>the three of us, gabriel delacroix; my father, elizabeth james-delacroix; my mother and i; helaine delacroix sat at our dining table in our huge manor, enjoying our breakfast quietly.</p>
<p>"we read your diary last night, helaine," gabriel broke the silence. i stopped chewing my pancake, but then continued to do so. i was annoyed, but i wasn't someone to go off my temper easily.</p>
<p>"so..?" i said calmly, as i arched my eyebrow towards them. though my father was a very famous french dark wizard, i was never scared of him. </p>
<p>"i know, we both in fact know that you love beauxbatons so much. you can still visit the school on weekly basis, chérie," gabriel said, convincing me. </p>
<p>i didn't understand why would we have to move. france was okay. my father was well-known here. why would we have to move to my mother's hometown?</p>
<p>"we made a deal. papa agreed that when it's our 18th marriage anniversary, we'd move to england. a fair deal, isn't it?" elizabeth caressed my hand and i just stayed quiet. </p>
<p>i looked at them both, eyes were already teary. they knew that i was scared of meeting new people. they knew that i always had trouble making new friends. leave the fact that i would have to speak english from now on, because i never spoke french with my parents, therefore i was already used to it.</p>
<p>"we promise that hogwarts would be amazing, chérie," gabriel smiled apologetically as he looked at me. i tried to carve a smile, a half-sincere one to not worry them.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>as i was walking downstairs to the kitchen, i saw a letter with my name on it, on the ground in front of the front door. i took it and took out a piece of paper from the envelope. on top of the paper was a school's logo, hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry.</p>
<p>'Ms. Delacroix,<br/>
we are delighted to let you know that your request to to transfer from Beauxbatons to Hogwarts is accepted.'</p>
<p>i stopped reading the letter when i felt a hand holding my shoulder calmly.</p>
<p>"i was in slytherin when i was in hogwarts, because your grandfather was in that house too," the familiar voice made me turn my body to see my mother, elizabeth smiling sincerely as she looked at me. she had greenish eyes but i had brown, inheriting it from gabriel. i inherited her chestnut brown locks while gabriel had caramel coloured hair.</p>
<p>"y-you never told me you were in hogwarts," i said, twitching my lips. she grinned as she patted my head. "that's because you never bothered to ask, darling."</p>
<p>we both sat on the couch as we read the letter together. i folded back the letter and looked at her, there were many questions in my head that i felt like i was going to explode anytime.</p>
<p>"how does hogwarts look like?" i asked as i rested my hand on her thigh. "it isn't floral-themed like beauxbatons. it's gothic, kind of. but it's homey," she answered. i was already unpleased by the word 'gothic.'</p>
<p>"do you think i'd do great there, mama?"</p>
<p>"of course you will. my princess will always do great anywhere she'd be placed at," she said, leaning in to kiss my forehead as i looked again at the envelope, sighing.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>the manor of james, or the manor that my family would live in from now on, didn't look disappointing. i toured the manor and was satisfied that i would now spend my life here. </p>
<p>as i stared at the chandelier while laying on my queen sized bed, i remembered that tomorrow would be the day that i would become a hogwarts student, officially. my parents convinced me that i would be fine there, but of course; i was nervous. </p>
<p>hours passed by, and without realising that i had been to deep in my thoughts, i drove off to dreamland.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>many students had filled in the hogwarts express train. the faces were unfamiliar, making my palms sweaty as i gripped my trolley.</p>
<p>three platinum blondes walked near my family, and i had no clue of who they were. surprisingly, my parents did.</p>
<p>"ah, lucius malfoy!" gabriel shook the hand of a tall man with long platinum blond hair while elizabeth hugged the platinum blonde and black haired woman who seemed to be shorter than her.</p>
<p>"the delacroixs. welcome to united kingdom," the man or lucius, smiled at the three of us. "and who's this over here? it's been so long since we met, gabriel," lucius patted my shoulder as he looked at my father, waiting for an answer.</p>
<p>"this. this is my princess, helaine delacroix. i believe that she's the same age as draco?"</p>
<p>i was confused about who my father was referring to, but then i forgot about the existence of another platinum blond haired guy, who was already looking at me; slightly smirking. his face was proud as he looked at me.</p>
<p>"well, well then. seems like helaine has just made a new friend," lucius pushed the boy to greet me. he smirked as he held out his hand. his green eyes glistened as he looked down to me.</p>
<p>"i'm malfoy. draco, malfoy."</p>
