          <div class="userstuff"><p>Graceful, and flawless--perfection is the only thing you strive for, how arrogant you must be, filling that head with that ego inflated from all that praise--</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But I know better, I know better than to believe that act of yours--acting like a <em>perfectly innocent star-student prefect</em>--</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Tom Marvolo Riddle--Lord Voldemort, I know how you really are, I didn't <em>survive for nothing</em>--</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Average, I worked to stay average and not draw attention <em>and yet</em>--you took attention to <em>me, why?</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Irritating, <em>you're so</em> <em><strong>irritating</strong></em>--calm down, I need to calm down cause my temper lead to gaining your attention from that duel--</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Falling--I'm falling for you, <em>but why?</em> <em><strong>Why?</strong></em> Why <em>you</em> of all the people I could fall for why <em>you?</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>Flowers</em> --I'm coughing up <em>flowers</em>--<em><strong>why am I coughing up flowers--</strong></em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hanahaki Disease, that's what it is, this <em><strong>thing</strong></em> making me cough up flowers for <em>you--why?</em> <em><strong>Why do I love you?</strong></em> Because with these flowers means you don't love me too, you won't ever love me back either--I know, you can't love after all--</p>
<p> </p>
<p>With all these flowers I cough up, it's something to say that <em>I've had enough--</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Red Spider Lilies, bunches upon bunches of the flowers for my love for you, no matter how unrequited it is, and <em>will be--</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>You found them--no no</em> <em><strong>no NO--you weren't supposed to find them--all those flowers of my feelings--</strong></em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ah--you don't know they're coming out of my lungs because of <em>you--you think--you think it's because of someone else--</em> well, it doesn't really matter because I know you won't love me back--</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em><strong>It's worsening--</strong></em> whole bunches of red spider lilies covered in blood coming out my mouth from my lungs--<em>take the surgery, Harry, they keep saying--</em> I know, <em>I know,</em> but part of me--<em>part of me doesn't want to, because part of me wants to keep those feelings,</em> <em><strong>those feelings even though they're the cause of all this pain--</strong></em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>Confess,</em> you tell me to <em>confess</em> to who these flowers are for and if they reject-- <em>get the surgery and forget about them--</em> it's so ironic, how you're telling me to <em>forget about them</em> when that person is <em>you--</em> so I just smile at you and walk away-- <em>even if it causes more flowers to bloom in my lungs--</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Collapse--I collapsed in the Great Hall, coughing up numerous bunches of red spider lilies coated in blood--you took me to the Hospital Wing <em>yelled out my name</em> and to <em>hold on--</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>I'm lying on the cot in the Hospital Wing, you keep telling me to just confess and if they reject, to get the surgery so I don't suffer anymore-- <em><strong>but what am I supposed to do when these flowers come out of my lungs because of you?</strong></em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>You're crying-- <em>not sobbing,</em> but your eyes are glassy with tears-- <em>I can feel my heart and lungs clench in pain--</em> you're hurting from me not confessing like I'm hurting because I'm not confessing--</p>
<p> </p>
<p>'I love you'--<em>Harry what are you doing? You're supposed to confess to whoever is giving you those flowers in your lungs--</em> 'I am confessing Tom! Because these flowers in my lungs is because of you! I love you but I <em>know</em> you can't love me back so--'</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lips smashing--the last of the flowers growing in my lungs come out--<em>blood free red spider lilies--</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Apologies and comforts murmured, relief that everything's going to be okay--</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now I'm in your embrace and you're in mine--and my love isn't as unrequited as I thought--because <em>you can love now--</em> and it's <em>me</em> that you love--and for now, that's all I need.</p></div>
