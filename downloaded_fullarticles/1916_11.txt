    <p>For billions of years eight powerful deities watched over the earth their names, Life, Death, Fate, Time, Matter, Motion, Light, and Darkness. They watched as the earth changed and species died before finally the humans came. They were by far one of the most entertaining species to ever exist on the planet, they constant fought and argued with each other. All of the deities were thrilled, at last they had a species that could not only entertain them but almost understand them for this species was sentient. Unfortunately not all of the deities were still willing to perform their job as the guardians of earth. Once the first powerful civilizations began to rise Darkness decided to try and cause the humans to kill as many of each other as possible. She whispered lies in the ears of powerful people and used her power to make them believe her lies. It led to the deaths of thousands.</p><p>The other deities had to act. They banded together and created a prison for her in the center of the earth where her influence would barely be able to reach the surface of the earth where the humans resided and they trapped her inside of it. Her influence became limited but still she caused trouble, the other deities were having to work constantly to prevent her causing a major war. After a century though she seemed to go dormant, all the threats stopped and the deities grew bored once more, believing Darkness had finally fallen into an eternal slumber. They all debated what to do about it before finally reaching a decision. They would grant random humans the ability to manipulate the world like they were able to and those that gained the power would be able to pass it onto their descendants.</p><p>Death gave humans the ability to cause harm and kill, the magic of hexes, jinxes and curses. Life's contribution to the massive spell was the magic of healing, the ability to restore the body and strengthen it. Just as she too gave, protected and nurtured life.</p><p>Time's contribution was one of the most complex ones, the ability to alter the laws of reality. The magic of enchanting and charms, the power to cause objects and people to ignore the very rules that govern the planet. Fate gave gifted humans a small part of her own power, the magic of the mind, to see the future and even read others thoughts. Matter made it so that humans would be able to change not only themselves but the things around them, the ability to change matter, the magic of transfiguration.</p><p>Motion thought humans to be pathetically slow and so gave them a way to change it, she gave them the ability to teleport through a variety of methods, the magic of apparition, floo, and portkeys. Light gave them the power to purify, purge and protect, the magic of undoing other magics, cleansing them away and keeping them at bay. As the magic of the spell poured through the land many changes occurred that they hadn't expected.</p><p>Plants and animals were changed and altered making them magical and bringing forth the very first potion ingredients and magical creatures. However the worst part of the unforeseen changes was when Darkness, whom they all thought dormant, piggybacked off of their spell, gifting mortals the magic sacrifice but also changing the other deities gifts, adding a darker spectrum appear to all of them. Of course the deities were furious but little could be done but to sit back and watch, the damage had been done. For a good while they were truly entertained, the humans were certainly interesting and when those that received the gift discovered their magic, it was amusing. They invented spells to control the magic and magical sticks to harness it. Rather ingenious though it was by no means the best solution. If they'd taken the time to master magic without either spells or the sticks it would've enhanced their potential one hundred fold.</p><p>However all things whether good or bad must come to an end. Fourteen hundred years after they gave humans magic those without it began hunting them and those with it went into hiding. One of the most interesting of these magicals, a man by the name of Merlin, killed himself in a ritual to hide the magical world. Non-magicals could literally no longer see magic due to his ritual, whenever they saw it unless it was completely shoved in their faces they would believe it a hoax or just to have not happened at all. The magical world stagnated and the non magical world was just as boring as before. The deities were bored out of their minds once more. But finally something interesting happened, Fate gave a two part prophecy one of which was particularly attention grabbing.</p><p>The Chosen approaches,</p><p>Born as the seventh month dies,</p><p>To those who have thrice defied a Riddle,</p><p>They shall be marked by their rival,</p><p>Powerful beyond understanding,</p><p>Wielding Knowledge Greater than Any,</p><p>Undefeatable in their power,</p><p>Unstoppable in their rage,</p><p>The Chosen will come.</p><p>The one approaches,</p><p>Born with power,</p><p>Bound by a servant,</p><p>Feared by a friend,</p><p>Power bound and body frail,</p><p>Cast unto his blackest days,</p><p>Pain and suffering he will know,</p><p>Gifted knowledge by mercy's will,</p><p>Assisted by one long thought gone,</p><p>He shall rise from blackest hell,</p><p>Greater than any before him,</p><p>Fear and vengeance he shall sow,</p><p>Love and devotion he shall grow,</p><p>The God of gods,</p><p>The King of kings,</p><p>He shall rise.</p><p>Interestingly enough when the prophecy entered the mortal world only the first half was revealed, a rare though not unheard of occurrence. Unfortunately the man who heard the prophecy was of the worst sort, a manipulative old man who thought he always knew what was right. A man who thought that in pursuit of fighting the darkness he was justified to wield the very power he opposed. The Headmaster of Hogwarts, the Head Warlock of the Wizengamot of Britain, and Supreme Mugwump of the International Federation of Wizards, Albus Dumbledore. Yet long ago all the deities had agreed to only interfere in world threatening situations, and so they simply watched.</p><p>Dumbledore chuckled to himself as he helped himself to one of his many lemon drops. His plans were going perfectly, Peter Pettigrew was on the fast track to becoming the Potter's secret keeper. Once he did Dumbledore believed Pettigrew would somehow convince Lily and James to trust him to watch the twins for an evening before welcoming Voldemort into their home. That had always been Emma's problem, she was too hasty in her decisions and her terrible fear of death would only enhance that, the prophecy would be set in motion within a week. If things went well then Emma would kill the spare twin and somehow temporarily kill herself in her attempt to kill the other. However he doubted he would be that lucky, he would probably need to separate the twins the old fashioned way, through subtle lies. It wasn't ever hard to know who the chosen one was, Harry's magical core was so large that it was scary. Of course he would need to bind the child's magical potential before he put him into an environment that would him easy to manipulate.</p><p>The last thing he needed was the boy discovering how to wield his magic. No, the boy needed to be a soldier, a tool. What Dumbledore wanted was a pawn, someone who would sacrifice themselves in their killing of Voldemort so that he could have free reign of the wizarding world. Luckily for him the child seemed to be just about average in intelligence meaning his plans wouldn't be spotted by someone in a million prodigy. Yes, his plans were coming along quite nicely. All he had to do was wait.</p><p>Little did Dumbledore know that the Potter twins were anything but average intelligence wise or magically. Both were geniuses and precocious but they chose to hide it. Well not really, Harry decided to hide it and instructed his sister to do the same. His reasoning was simple he did not trust Dumbledore. He had seen the man many times but by the time he was one he had already formed a conclusion on him and viewed him to be an arrogant old man that was eager to improve his own status. It did help that the fool talked to him when he was only several months old, boasting of how he was the smartest wizard ever and of how he would use the war to his own advantage, the poor chap. So when his sister began to talk he instructed her to do the same as he did and hide her intelligence. Harry worried occasionally when he looked into her eyes, they were filled with something he didn't like. There was love yes but it didn't look like the kind you'd have for family. Her eyes betrayed love to the point of obsession and a deep happiness and what seemed to be lust when he was alone with her. Though how or why a two year old was capable of lust was beyond his understanding.</p><p>He may have ditched her and worked on his plans alone had it not been for the fact that she was extremely powerful magically and intelligent to boot, like a copy of Harry except it was a version where everything was toned down significantly, except the looks that is. By the age of four you could tell they would both be ridiculously attractive when they were older. It helped that she was also clearly loyal to a fault when it came to him. They both read books and learned, observing their parents and those that visited them. They'd sneak out of bed when they were supposed to be sleeping, stealing their parents wands and practicing spells they found in books from the library. Both of their cores were still developing but they still showed remarkable skill when it came to casting spells, Harry in particular. One of the first important spells they cast was the magical potential test at the age of three.</p><p>Flashback- Third Person</p><p>"Hey Holly come look at this one," Harry called softly to his sister. They had to be sure to stay quiet, they'd have some very confused parents if they got caught reading thick spell books when they supposedly just mastered pictured books, gullible fools. Holly came walking over from the shelf she'd been searching curiously.</p><p>"What did you find this time?" She asked excitedly. He was typically the one finding spells they could try and he only bothered pointing them out of they were interesting. She quickly sat down beside him and peered over at the book.</p><p>"It's the spell that was mentioned in the book we read last night, the one that reveals a rough estimate of what your magical index rating currently is and will be at fourteen and twenty one, the incantation is magicis potentia," Harry explained quickly. Holly smiled eagerly.</p><p>"Together on three?" She asked. Harry nodded. Holly raised a wand but Harry merely raised a hand. He'd discovered on his second birthday to cast spells, he could simply channel his magic into his hands to cast it, it removed the need for a wand movement. Holly had been able to cast without moving a wand but she still had to hold one. Neither could yet silent cast.</p><p>"Three, two, one, Magicis Potentia," They said together. Harry's eyes widened as he looked at his numbers. Nine Hundred ninety nine trillion, nine hundred ninety nine gazillion and just an infinity symbol. That couldn't be right, the average was two hundred for an adult, his parents were around in the three fifty. Hell he'd heard his mother say Dumbledore's was five hundred. He looked over at Holly's to make sure the spell wasn't faulty, four hundred, six hundred, and nine hundred. Exceptionally high numbers yet still in the realm of possibility, after all whenever he activated his natural magesight Holly appeared around their parents level of brightness and they both had ratings around three hundred and seventy five. Well as best as he could tell they were around the same, he wasn't sure given that he was still mastering and experimenting with his magesight. It didn't help he'd only discovered it a few months before, to say it was disturbing when various objects and people began glowing would be an understatement to say the least.</p><p>"Harry look my predicted MIR is really high! What are-" Holly looked over at his numbers and her mouth fell open cutting off whatever she was going to ask. Holly looked from his predicted MIR to his face before she doubled over laughing. "Oh Merlin Harry, your face right now, it's priceless, I always told you that you were way more powerful than me," Holly said as she sat up. He simply gave her a glare.</p><p>"Can I borrow dad's wand? I want to try the spell with a wand, it's the only thing I can think of that we did differently and clearly something went wrong for me," Harry said after a minute. Holly just shrugged and tossed it to him. He quickly cast the spell again and glared at the numbers that floated from the wand tip, they were the same as before.</p><p>"Harry, you always seem to know everything except when it comes to things about yourself, you can guess what pretty much everyone around you is going to do because of how observant you are but I swear when it comes to you thinking about yourself its like you intentionally think less of yourself. It's not me who has magesight and it's not me that can cast spells without a wand, is it really that hard to believe that your numbers are that high?" Holly reasoned logically. Harry laughed at what he assumed was her idea of a joke.</p><p>"Oh no, not at all, it's perfectly reasonable that my magical core is larger than every other magical core on the planet put together, that makes totally sense," He said sarcastically. Holly snorted slightly.</p><p>"Whatever, even if the numbers aren't right the idea is the same, clearly you won't be running out of magic in any duels anytime soon," Holly argued. Harry had to admit she had a point. Even if the exact numbers were off it didn't matter. Unless he started running around creating rituals that used ridiculous amounts of magic he would probably never need to worry about taking a break to allow his core to recharge. Chances were he would be able to do many rituals and spells on his own that were normally done by a group, other than that the numbers simply meant that he would never need to worry about his magical core running low in a fight.</p><p>"I will admit you have a point," Harry grudgingly admitted. Holly smiled slightly, it was a rare moment when her brother was wrong about something. Then again pretty much every time he was wrong about something it was concerning himself. He always was doing that, underestimating himself. She had yet to see a spell he cast fail and he did it wandlessly! He was three years old and was running around with magesight, wandlessly casting spells, and yet he seemed to think himself simply above average. There was a reason she never disobeyed her brother, he was powerful but what made him so great was his ridiculous intelligence. It was that deadly combination that caused Holly to truly believe Harry could do anything and that combination that ensured Holly would follow him to the ends of the earth. Holly knew she was smart but sometimes talking with him made her feel like an idiot, the way he seemed to simply know everything and seemed so uncaring about it. She stood up and wandered off towards the shelves of the family library once more, Harry already lost back into the books.</p><p>Voldemort looked at the wards the so called greatest wizard of the age, Albus Dumbledore, had put up around the house and sneered in disgust. Dumbledore was growing old and his body was weak as was his magic, more and more of it was going into his body to keep the doddering old fool alive. If it weren't for that dreaded wand of his then she would've easily defeated him the first time Dumbledore had challenged her to a duel. With the Fidelius charm on the house rendered useless by her, soon to be dead, servant, Wormtail aka Peter Pettigrew, the house was pathetically easy to breach. There were anti-apparition, anti-portkey, and anti-floo wards that she left in place since she didn't want anyone stopping her from doing what had to be done. The prophecy was clear, even if it was only a part of it that she possessed. A child born from those who had already defied her three times would be born as the seventh month died, said child would have the power to be her equal. At first she had doubted this but the line of being marked by their rival solidified it for her, for you could not be someone's rival unless you were at least equal in power to them. The final line she knew of the line of being destined to wield power only cemented that view. Best of all there were only two children born as the seventh month died and they happened to be twins. Both potential threats to her conquest in one place.</p><p>Voldemort flicked her wand, easily shattering the intention and anti-trespassing wards. She walked up the pathway and the door swung open to reveal Wormtail himself. Frankly the man was delusional. He was a coward, an idiot, untrustworthy, and useless yet he thought himself worthy of joining her death eaters. She would enjoy torturing him later. "Where are they Wormtail?" She asked in her soft, melodic voice. She had always loved the innocent beauty and voice she possessed, it was such a great contrast to her evil deeds. She had used it well, acting sweet and innocent to gather information or to pretend to befriend someone only to later use that information or friendship to her own , she had never stooped so low as to use her body however, she would never mingle with those filthy weaklings who were so much lower than herself, whether they were purebloods or not.</p><p>Wormtail bowed low, "They are in their room, the first door at the top of the stairs, both children are sleeping master," He said as he bowed. Voldemort nodded, a faint smile touching her lips. Soon she would be safe once again, the strongest force in the world once more.</p><p>"Excellent, return to Lucius's manor to await further instructions," Voldemort ordered as she walked past him. He wouldn't be going there to await instructions in the slightest, she had ordered Bellatrix to be waiting for him there. Voldemort only hoped he would still be sane by the time she arrived to join in the fun, their screams were never as entertaining once their minds snapped. Voldemort walked up the flight of stairs her servant had gestured to and saw the door he had said had the child who was supposedly her rival. 'I wonder which one of them it is?' Voldemort mused in her mind. She activated her magesight as the she pushed open the door. It was the easiest way to tell which was most likely her rival, their core would be the larger one. The moment she looked inside the room she had to hold back a scream as her eyes burned. She flicked off her magesight, her eyes zeroing in on what caused the stupidly large amount of magic to almost blind her. There, on the bed, the boy was fast asleep his sister pressed up against him, her arm draped over him protectively. The girl's own bed on the other side, completely untouched.</p><p>It was difficult to tell which was the source of the magic that had filled the room so completely but she was sure it was the boy. He seemed to be brighter even without her magesight on. It was lucky that those with magesight could not see themselves for surely the child would've blinded himself when he unlocked it. There wasn't a doubt in her mind that he possessed magesight, even with his eyes closed she could sense the magic centered in them. She looked at them both closely. The boy was handsome in every sense of the word despite being only eight and she was sure it would only increase with time. The girl was clearly extremely pretty but comparing her looks to that of her brother was like comparing the light of a flashlight to the light of the sun. Simply being in the same room as him made her wand to bow down to the child, she felt like she was in the presence of a god. 'I can't kill him,' She thought. It wasn't just that she truly believed she couldn't kill him, she also didn't want to. She wanted to serve him, to be his, to be owned by him, to help him in any way that she could. The girl though she had to die. Even asleep it was obvious she was in love with her brother. Her body language was screaming it. The way her arms were wrapped around him, the way she pressed her body against his, and the slight smile on her lips as she slept. Voldemort doubted the girl was even aware of it and even if she was it was unlikely that the girl knew how obvious it was.</p><p>The girl was a threat. She, Lord Voldemort, was the one that would be with him some day, she would make sure of it. Immediately she began to make plans. She would kill the girl and take the boy far away temporarily halting the war so that she could teach him and give him time to age. If at eight he was already so ridiculously powerful soon he would be completely unstoppable. That would work. If she endeared herself to him once he rose to power she would be one of his favorite servants. She couldn't make a move on him for a long time yet though, that annoyed her. She wasn't concerned with their age difference but he was simply too young, she had been in her seventeen year old body since she was, well, seventeen. She had long since discovered a way to use her horcruxes to halt her aging. Perhaps by the time the boy was around sixteen she would, hopefully, be able to successfully convince him that it was a slave's job to pleasure their master. If he didn't want her then she would deal with it but oh how she wanted to be his. She was momentarily jealous of the girl laying next to the boy before shrugging it off. It wasn't like they had slept together, they were eight for Merlin sake.</p><p>Voldemort raised her wand and aimed it at the girl, "Avada Kedavra," she whispered and watched as the green light of the killing curse flew towards the girl. A slight smile formed on her lips just before it hit the- suddenly a tendril of magic shot from the boys hand and intercepted the killing curse. Thinking quickly she flicked her wand towards him and cast the most powerful magic binding spell on him that she could hoping to stop whatever he was doing, the boy's sister had to die, she had to! She then realized that his eyes were still closed, he was doing it subconsciously. Her eyes flicked back to the magic intercepting her curse just in time to see it shape into a catapult before launching the curse straight back at her, the catapult hitting the girl on the forehead as it did so. She saw a lightning bolt shaped scar appear on the girls forehead just before the killing curse flew towards her so quickly she had no hope of dodging it. She felt the curse impact her as her body turned to a shade, her robe and wand falling to the floor. 'Fuck!' She thought in anger and annoyance. She had underestimated her future master and in doing so it had cost her dearly.</p><p>'Perhaps it would be in my best interest to wait before I resurrect myself, I can perhaps get Dumbledore to lower his guard, and best of all it will give, what did Peter tell me his name was? Ah yes, Harry, time to age,' Voldemort thought to herself already thinking of how she could best use the situation to her advantage. After all it wasn't often one found themselves accidentally becoming a ghost capable of possessing people. She began debating between several decent plans. She could observe and protect her future master while she waited for an ideal opportunity to present itself or she could go into hiding, a safer option but she would prefer to be closer to him. There was always the choice of possessing someone until she could come back to life properly. That would work. She could possess Bellatrix in order to speak to them, she did need to inform her death eaters of her new plans after all. Ideally she would then find someone else to possess that allowed her constant access to Harry's life. 'Then again with that meddling fool so close to the Potter family who knows what's going to happen when he finds out about this, I will need to wait and see,' Voldemort reasoned before she flew away, going through the walls of the house thanks to her new form as a shade.</p><p>Lily and James both arrived home a mere ten minutes after Voldemort had left their own and arrived to find the door ajar. They both looked over at each other, fear and panic in their eyes before they darted inside and quickly looked around, wands drawn.</p><p>"No signs of a fight," Lily observed immediately. James simply scowled. The lack of evidence for a fight and the fact that something had clearly happened both pointed towards Peter as a traitor. Lily winced slightly, already knowing what James was thinking. They both ran up the stairs and saw the door was open as well. They stepped into the room fearing the worst and immediately breathed a sigh of relief upon seeing both of their children sleeping soundly. Lily smiled slightly as she saw Holly laying with Harry again. It was a running joke at this point, she'd been doing it since she was two and hadn't stopped since. Whenever they were sent to bed she'd lie in bed pretending to be asleep and the second Harry fell asleep she would sneak into his bed, soon they would soon have their own rooms and that would put an end to it.</p><p>"Lily, look," James breathed as he pointed at the floor. She looked down and gasped, there sitting on the floor was the wand and robe of Voldemort, there was no mistaking them, the wand in particular. They both just stood there staring at the items in shock before Lily came back to her senses.</p><p>"Go floo Dumbledore, I'll talk to the kids," Lily instructed briskly. James nodded as he was snapped from his shock by the sound of his wife's voice. He left the room, running for the floor as Lily sank to the floor beside Harry's bed. She reached an arm out slowly and shook them both awake. Harry sat up swiftly, eyes wide, immediately fully alert while Holly yawned and sat up, rubbing her eyes. Lily immediately noticed a small lightning bolt shaped scar on Holly's forehead while Harry appeared untouched. Lily wasn't sure what it was but she was sure there was something special about Harry. Whenever she was in the same room as him she seemed to be drawn to him yet there outwardly seemed to be nothing different about him from any other kid that would cause it. If anything he should've slipped into the background, he was quiet and rarely spoke more than a few words at a time yet when he spoke she heard a confidence and power not present in any other person she'd spoken to. When he spoke she wanted to obey.</p><p>"Harry, Holly, do you remember anything odd about tonight? Something different than normal?" She asked softly. She made sure to watch Holly's face and not Harry's. She tended to give more away than he did. She wasn't sure of it but at times it seemed Harry had a near perfect mask of sorts that hid his true emotions. He smiled and laughed and frowned but there were times it seemed to be slightly less than genuine. But just like with the attention he seemed to gather, not just from her but everyone else, she couldn't place a solid reason for it. Holly however just seemed confused at her question.</p><p>"No mum, I have a little bit of a headache for some reason though," Holly said, frowning slightly. Inwardly Holly smirked as she saw the robe and wand laying on the floor, just as Harry had predicted Voldemort had came for them that night and just as Harry had promised she was safe. If anyone else had told her they were going to protect her from the woman who had killed hundreds of people and was greater than Albus Dumbledore in power she would've laughed at them. But when Harry said it she had treated it as it was, a fact. Just like every other time, Harry had kept his word. She was safe, though she felt some sort of mark on her forehead. It was shame that Harry had told her to actually go to sleep when they were told to for once, she would've liked to see the so called dark lord's face when she realized Harry was better than her in every way.</p><p>Lily smiled sadly before conjuring a mirror and showing her daughter the scar on her forehead. "It will scab over but it reeks of magic, I doubt it will heal completely," Lily said slowly. Holly merely nodded, she could feel the magic in it but she didn't mind, it was Harry's magic, a small piece of him constantly touching her was perfectly fine by her.</p><p>"I didn't see anything either," Harry said abruptly. She looked into both of their eyes for any sign of deceit but she couldn't see any though once again something seemed to be telling her they weren't telling the truth.</p><p>"What caused the scar?" Harry asked, causing her to jolt from her thoughts. Lily paled slightly as the graveness of the matter sunk in due to Harry's comment. Voldemort herself had been mere feet from her children before one of her them managed to stop her.</p><p>"Voldemort, Harry, she did it," She whispered, gesturing towards the robes and wand on the floor. Harry and Holly merely nodded pretending to be scared silent. Lily was still unnerved by their nonchalance at times, they had never once even flinched apon hearing the name Voldemort spoken whereas even most full grown adults nearly pissed themselves when it was spoken. Then again Lily and James had never been one to fear a name, they had always said it so she supposed it was only natural her children weren't worried by it.</p><p>"Does that mean she's finally dead mum?" Holly asked eagerly. Before Lily could respond a voice sounded from the doorway.</p><p>"For now Holly, for now," The voice said mysteriously. All three of the room's occupants turned towards the sound of the voice to find Albus Dumbledore himself standing in the doorway. Lily's eyes flicked back to her kids to see if the implications of what Dumbledore had said had occurred to them but it didn't appear to have.</p><p>"Come Lily, let us leave Harry and Holly to talk while we have a discussion of our own," Dumbledore said serenely. Lily quickly nodded and walked over to the door. The last thing she wanted was to worry her children with talks of Voldemort on day returning.</p><p>"We'll be back in a little bit guys, be good," She said as she shut the door. She turned to Dumbledore.</p><p>Harry and Holly waited until the sound of footsteps faded before they began to talk, with each sitting on their own bed facing each other.</p><p>"Holly, I'm sure you know by now, both from the vague hints Dumbledore had given us unintentionally and from my explanations of what he is planning, that I am not going to be staying with you any longer," Harry began softly. Holly scowled.</p><p>"I don't want you to leave! We've done everything together, we grew up together, we hid our intelligence from mum and dad together, we even learned magic together, I want to grow up with you for a lot longer," She protested heatedly, though luckily she still remembered to keep her voice down. Harry gave her a tired smile.</p><p>"I know Holly but it will be good for you to get a little independence, if my suspicions are right Dumbledore will even teach you magic," He said teasingly. Holly practically squealed, she loved learning magic. A moment later though she frowned.</p><p>"Won't you fall behind if you're not learning with me?" She asked curiously. Harry rolled his eyes at her.</p><p>"Holly we both know it will take you roughly three years to catch up to me where I am now, and I learn at like ten times the rate you do, I won't be able to learn any new magic until probably around my eleventh birthday where I'm going but I can still easily stay ahead of you," He said in a voice filled exaggerated confidence. Holly laughed lightly.</p><p>"That's true, wait your eleventh birthday! How long are you going to be gone for!" She asked in shock. Harry grimaced.</p><p>"I doubt I'm coming back, if I am it probably won't be until the summer after our first year at Hogwarts," Harry admitted. Holly just sat on her bed in shock. Six years. He would be gone six years. Seven years until she could see him again.</p><p>"But why?" Holly whispered. The question wasn't addressed at Harry. She even knew the answer. But Harry answered anyway.</p><p>"Because as you know Dumbledore knows I'm the one who can truly defeat Voldemort, he will send me somewhere where I'm either force fed his views and beliefs by the spoon full or a place where he tries to make me timid and afraid. Either way his end goal is to get me to follow his every order. Little does he know I have a weapon up my sleeve, my wandless magic," Harry answered with a slight smirk. He didn't mention the fact that Voldemort hadn't done what he expected her to do. Despite being asleep he could still remember the magical changes going on around him. He'd felt as moments after Voldemort had entered the room her magic had become almost submissive to his. How she'd chosen to attack Holly instead of him. He didn't mention that Voldemort had put a binding on his magic that would take him two years to break given his core was still hard to wield due to its immaturity or that during said two years he wouldn't be able to use magic of any sort, wandless or otherwise.</p><p>"Harry, I know I've never told you before but, you know how I feel about you don't you?" Holly asked after a minute. Harry mentally rolled his eyes. Please, she slept in his bed, believed whatever he said as gospel and believed him to be the most powerful thing ever. He knew how she felt she thought of some kind of god and she was in love with him. To an obsessive degree. No doubt if they were about six years older she'd be trying to sleep with him every night as well.</p><p>"Yes Holly, I do," He said softly. Holly seemed to hesitate for a moment before speaking again.</p><p>"How do you feel about me?" She asked shyly, blushing slightly. Harry bit his tongue. His sister was definitely pretty and would surely grow into a very beautiful woman one day. She was also funny, kind and smart but how did he feel about her? He wasn't sure.</p><p>"I don't know Holly, ask me again when I come back, I'll have an answer for you then," He answered quietly. Holly nodded and looked down in disappointment. 'At least he did not outright reject me,' Holly thought optimistically. Suddenly their door swung open to reveal Dumbledore, James and Lily.</p><p>"Hey kids, we have some bad news for you," Lily began, totally obvious to the conversation that Holly and Harry had been having twenty seconds prior.</p><p>Five Minutes Before-</p><p>"Do you truly believe she will return Albus?" Lily whispered. He merely smiled at her sadly.</p><p>"Let us go downstairs so James may participate in our conversation before we begin," Dumbledore said softly. Lily nodded and they both walked downstairs in silence. They walked into the living room and Lily sat on the couch beside James while Dumbledore sat in one of the arm chairs across from them.</p><p>"To answer your question from a minute ago Lily, I am absolutely certain that Voldemort is not gone, Holly is undoubtedly the one of the prophecy, she has been marked by the dark lord," He said, his voice full of quiet confidence. Inwardly he was gleefully cackling. Things had gone even better than he had hoped Holly hadn't died but this was much better. He had instantly seen that Harry's magical core was bound already. A mark on his magic that no one without magesight could see, while Holly had a scar on her forehead tainted with Harry's magic. What had happened was obvious to him. Harry's magic had protected his sister and somehow killed Voldemort. But it made it look like Holly was the savior. Originally he had planned to keep the boy close and train him but he could make what had happened work. He could train the girl, make her into a decent backup plan and place the boy in an environment that would make him timid and weak. When he needed Harry he could simply unbind his magic, teach him enough to be a decent threat to Emma and sit back and watch as they killed each other.</p><p>"So you want to train her," James finished for him. It wasn't a question but Dumbledore nodded anyway.</p><p>"Yes but that is the least of our worries for now I fear," Dumbledore said slowly. Lily and James shot him confused looks.</p><p>"What do you mean Albus?" Lily asked confusedly. Dumbledore gave her another sad, and very fake, smile.</p><p>"Well, word will undoubtedly get out about what Holly accomplished here tonight, your family will be hunted more actively than ever, not only by remaining death eaters but also by reporters and well wishers who want to harass and stalk you. I suggest you move Harry somewhere else for a while so he can avoid the stress of having to deal with it all. Unfortunately Holly cannot hope to avoid it given her celebrity status and my need to train her." Dumbledore finished simply. James seemed to be nodding in agreement but Lily looked outraged.</p><p>"I absolutely refuse to leave my son with anyone but myself simply because you believe he can't handle a little stress. If nothing else he can stay in our home, it's under a Fidelius charm for goodness sake, Peter may have told a few death eaters but it's not like the public knows about it," Lily reasoned logically. Dumbledore instantly became annoyed. He'd had to cast almost twenty compulsion charms on Lily to convince her to move to the smaller house they were staying in currently rather than remaining in the Potter family where Emma would've never stood a chance of being able to reach the Potter twins. Lily was exceptionally stubborn. However he wanted Harry gone that night which meant unless James and Lily both turned around for some reason he was going to have to do this the old fashioned way, with lots and lots of lies backed by logic that only made sense if you believed his lies.</p><p>"I am afraid Lily that when Voldemort arrived and saw the wards she tore down the Fidelius charm, I would recast it but alas it can only be placed on a building once, we also need to remember that Harry will most likely become bitter and jealous of the attention Holly receives, if we tell him it is so that he is not bothered by people he will accept it, don't you want him to have a normal childhood?" He reasoned. He saw Lily looked completely unmoved until he mentioned a normal childhood but then her eyes flashed.</p><p>"Very well Dumbledore, I will allow it simply because you are correct about me wanting him to have a happy normal childhood, and it is true he wouldn't have that if he was forced to stay at home all the time to avoid swarms of people," Lily agreed reluctantly. Dumbledore smiled at her genuinely. 'Ah it is so nice when one of my plans comes together,' He thought happily. Meanwhile Lily was having thoughts of her own, 'Normal childhood my ass, he wants Harry out of the way for some reason.' Lily wanted to put up more of a fight but she couldn't. James was the Lord of a Most Noble and Most Ancient House, if she tried to go against his wishes for the kids he could simply file a divorce and easily gain control of their kids only to then send Harry somewhere anyway. If the matter reached the Wizengamot Lily knew she didn't stand a chance, she would never more than mildly respected by the wizarding world due to her blood status.</p><p>Not that she believed James would take it that far. On his own at least. With Dumbledore influencing him Lily wasn't sure how far James would go. No, it was better if she didn't put up a fuss so she could do the little things she could to help Holly resist whatever Dumbledore was planning. Otherwise she wouldn't be able to do anything.</p><p>"I believe it would be best if we take him to a new home tonight otherwise someone may be watching the house and see where he goes, I was thinking you sister may be a good candidate to be his guardian," Dumbledore explained. Lily bit her lip but nodded.</p><p>"Fine, I don't like saying goodbye so soon but you're right it's best if he leaves tonight," Lily said softly. James rose to his feet.</p><p>"How long are we sending him away for?" James asked quietly. Dumbledore sighed.</p><p>"Long enough for him to have a complete childhood my boy, a complete childhood," Dumbledore said.</p><p>"We better go tell the kids," James murmured. Quickly, Lily, James and Dumbledore went up the stairs and headed towards the children's bedroom.</p><p>"James, Lily, I believe it may be wise to not tell Holly where we're sending Harry, the fewer people who know the better," Dumbledore advised. James and Lily nodded before they opened the door leading to the children's bedroom. They saw both of their kids look at them in surprise before Lily cut in.</p><p>"Hey kids, we have some bad news for you," Lily began softly. Holly looked at her mother in confusion though inwardly she was practically crying. 'Of course Harry had to be right again. Why could he not be wrong for once,' Holly thought sadly. Harry too looked at his mother with a look of fake confusion.</p><p>"What is it?" Holly asked despite already knowing the answer. James sank down on the bed and sighed.</p><p>"Well, you see Holly, now that Voldemort is finally gone alot of people, both good and bad people are going to come looking for us, we want Harry to be able to have a normal childhood so we're sending him to someplace safe," James said. Holly looked confused again.</p><p>"Why can't I go with him? Don't you want me to have a normal childhood to?" She asked in confusion. 'It is just like Harry said, Dumbledore convinced them to separate us and made them think I am some kind of chosen one that he needs to train. I hate them! I hate them all! It took Dumbledore five minutes to convince them to get rid of Harry, clearly they did not put up much of a fight,' Holly thought bitterly.</p><p>"I am afraid Holly that your chances of having a normal childhood are gone, word will get out that you somehow defeated Voldemort and people will harass you, not only that but I fear Voldemort is not gone forever, when she returns it will be up to you to defeat her so I wish to train you," Dumbledore said wisely. Harry mentally applauded the old man for this extremely well thought out lies. It was true that people would harass them and it was true that Voldemort world return but he had no intentions of using Holly to kill her when the time came. No, that job would fall down to Harry. It was an excellent reason for why she couldn't go with him though.</p><p>"But, but, I don't want Harry to leave!" Holly shouted in anger. 'I never will get over how well she plays the part of a normal seven year old,' Harry thought with a mental smirk.</p><p>"When am I going to have to leave and when am I coming back?" Harry asked softly. 'I wonder if I was right about that too..' He thought curiously. Lily's next words confirmed that he was.</p><p>"You need to leave tonight, I'm afraid we don't know when you'll be able to come back, perhaps after your first year at Hogwarts," Lily said, wincing heavily at the end. Dumbledore had said as much in the living room even if it was only implied. Holly immediately looked depressed.</p><p>"Cheer up Holly, I'm sure you can come visit me," Harry said trying to sound cheerful. Truthfully he knew no one would be allowed to visit him. Dumbledore would want him isolated to make sure he could control everything that went on in Harry's life.</p><p>"Actually my boy, I'm afraid she won't be able to visit you, the risk is too great that someone will follow her and find out where you will be staying," Dumbledore interrupted. 'So I am going to a non-magical household... Aunt Petunia's?' Harry reasoned quickly. If Dumbledore was going to try to hide him the wizarding world he would want a muggle family and that was reinforced by the fact he was mentioning Harry's safety, a good sign the location probably didn't have wards. It also fit with where he expected Dumbledore to place him, a place where most children would become obedient and frail. His so called aunt and uncle hated him with a passion and would undoubtedly neglect him at the very least, possibly even abuse him.</p><p>That would be perfect for Dumbledore's plans. An attention starved child who was afraid of his own shadow after years of abuse. A kid like that would be easy for Dumbledore to wrap around his finger. 'I can survive two years of the Dursleys, after that my magic can protect me,' Harry reasoned calmly.</p><p>"Goodbye Holly," He said as he ran forward and wrapped his arms around his sister. She hugged him back just as tightly.</p><p>"Bye Harry," She said sadly. Dumbledore flicked his wand and Harry's clothes quickly flew into a suitcase that Dumbledore conjured.</p><p>"Excellent, I will be taking you to your home for the next few years so you may wish to tell your parents goodbye," He said as he stepped out into the hallway. Harry moved to the left and hugged James who hugged him back just as tightly.</p><p>"Harry, remember that we love you and if you need anything we will always be there for you," James said as they both let go of each other. He walked over to Lily who crouched down so they would both be level with each other. She pulled him into a hug.</p><p>"Harry, I'm sorry, I don't know what Dumbledore is planning but I couldn't stop him with James backing him, but whatever it is Harry don't you dare give in," Lily whispered quickly before she pulled back slightly.</p><p>"James is right, don't forget we love you and we're here you," She said as they broke apart. 'Wait, she seriously knows Dumbledore is planning something?' Harry thought in shock. That hadn't been something he'd seen coming. Then again he probably should've expected it. He could never explain how it happened but for some reason pretty much any girl who could be useful to him just magically became drawn to him and they all seemed to become at least slightly more intelligent and powerful when it happened. They would want to serve him, to do what was best for him. It would make sense that because of that Lily somehow saw through Dumbledore's lies.</p><p>"I love you too," He whispered before walking out into the hallway where Dumbledore was waiting for him.</p><p>"Ah, Harry my boy, done saying your goodbyes?" Dumbledore asked serenely. Harry nodded and Dumbledore led him down the steps and out the door of the house before taking his arm and apparating them to wherever he was going to be living for the next seven years.</p><p>AN: Hey guys I hope you enjoyed the chapter, I'm aware it was kind of slow moving towards the end but it set the scene for where things are going and gave you alot of information on what the characters were like.
