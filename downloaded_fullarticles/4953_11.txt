    <p>The week had been horrid. Harry had had detention with UmBitch and he cursed quill all week. Anyways he was going to go crazy. This is how Harry found himself on the seventh floor that Friday evening standing across the hall from the room of requirement. He checked the empty halls to make sure he wasn't seen before he walked by the hall three times while thinking of the training room.<br/>
“Well look who I got here, if it isn't the famous Harry Potter.”<br/>
When Harry turned around Malfoy was there. How had he gotten in? Malfoy wasn't able to do it before. At least Malfoy hadn't caught him during one of the meetings, but it was over anyways. The prat would tattle to UmBitch and the one thing that kept him sane would be gone.<br/>
“Malfoy”<br/>
“This room, wow. I can get you in so much trouble Potter.” Malfoy was just going to run off to UmBitch couldn't he just get it over with.<br/>
“Go on run off to Umbrige like her pet, it's not like you could do anything by yourself.”<br/>
“I'm not her pet, Potter.” Malfoy spat. “I was actually planning on doing things by myself but now that you mentioned it running off could be fun…” maybe he wasn't completely fucked but what horrible thing did Malfoy have planed that Malfoy didn't even need it. Malfoy started to turn away heading to UmBitch for sure. It was probably better that that he got in more trouble with the Ministry rather than owe the son of a death eater, but that nagging heroic voice in his head was shouting at him telling that if Malfoy walked away now he wouldn't be the only one in trouble. If there was one thing Harry Potter was it was heroic.<br/>
“Wait,” Harry half shouted “what do you want?” Malfoy turned and smirked at Harry. At this moment Harry regreted not paying attention when Petuina dragged him to church trying to take the freak out of him because he would have sworn Malfoy was possessed by the devil. That smirk…<br/>
“I'm going to give you a lesson in economics, try to be as smart as a first year and understand. I know it may be…” couldn't he just get on with it and stop patronizing him? Ugh the prat.<br/>
“I can understand, just tell me what you want” Harry snapped at Malfoy.<br/>
“As I was saying before you do rudely interrupted me I'm going to give you a lesson in economics. There are three types of things things that you can use to trade money, which I have mountains of by the way. Resources like food and clothing, and on the higher end rare books and magical artifacts. And last but not least services where one uses their knowledge connections or skills to accomplish something for the other, or perhaps they just give time.”<br/>
“What do you want, Malfoy?” Harry said exasperated. He didn't appreciate Malfoy’s economics 101 at all. At least he was able to stop himself from interrupting Malfoy aging; it probably wasn't good to annoy Malfoy right now.<br/>
“Despite you abysmal intelligence I doubt that know what you can offer better than you.” Well at least he would get the chance to choose what what would happen and what Malfoy got, how bad could that be? This was a much harder task than he initially thought. What did he have that the rich prat didn't? There was the cloak but he would never give that away, though Malfoy did say connections.<br/>
“I could ask dumbledore…” Harry offered.<br/>
“Don't want anything to do with him.” Malfoy interrupted. It was probably good Malfoy did because honestly Harry had no idea where he was going with that. He really had nothing else that he was willing to give, he had money but Malfoy wouldn't care. Maybe their rivalry could give him something.<br/>
“I could throw the next…”<br/>
“Quittage is weak, besides if you got in trouble you would be kicked off the team.” Malfoy cut him off again.<br/>
Malfoy had mentioned things in that most annoying lesson of common sense, it might be useful as a cheeklist. Money, no. Food/clothing, easily bought.  The only artifact he had was the cloak, so agin no help. Services, his friends and acquaintances probably couldn't offer the the things that Malfoy would want. Now time maybe he could use that…<br/>
“An hour where I have to do what you say.” Harry practically blurred out<br/>
“Interesting.” Malfoy drawled out.<br/>
“You can't deliver me to Voldemort.” Harry stated. Why was he only now thinking of these things, all these kinks in his offer that could get him killed.<br/>
“But I could deliver you to Belatrix who would then most likely take you to the dark lord, no?”<br/>
“No not that either.” Harry said.<br/>
“Well then that isn't really you doing anything is it?” Malfoy was smirking through his words.<br/>
“No.” Harry said<br/>
“ An hour of anything would easily be enough to buy my silence, vertasum you to see if you have anything of value, the wrap you up in a nice bow and give you to Voldemort guaranteeing me a high position when he takes over.” Harry paled. “ but your not ok with that, smart, well not smart just not completely stupid. So an hour isn't enough.” Malfoy stoped speaking<br/>
“Well what then.” Harry said ever so timidly.<br/>
“Since you obviously can't think for yourself, what you want to offer is three hours with the stipulations that one. One: no permanent harm can come to you. Two: you will not be subject to excruciating pain. Three: you will not be subject to any injuries that would require treatment to heal Four: you will not be forced to commit a crime. Five: that you cannot be commanded to retrieve any valuable of yours.” Malfoy finished. It was actually a really good comprehensive list. Which either meant he had something truly horrible planed that didn't need any of those things or that he wasn't going to be a complete prat about catching Harry. It was probably the former, but what choice did he have?<br/>
“Ok.” Harry said.<br/>
“Next Saturday, not this Saturday, as in eight days, two to five here come here without your wand or knives or swords or that sort. You will not speak of our arrangement before or after it has happened otherwise I'll assume that you want me to get you in trouble.” Malfoy stated. Just as he was about to agree to Malfoy's terms Harry stoped, what was there to prevent Malfoy from backing out of this the moment he got what he wanted?<br/>
“How do I know that you won't just get me in trouble anyways?” Harry asked.<br/>
“I swear upon my magic that I will not inform anyone of Harry Potter’s use of the room of requirement or anyone else associated with Harry Potter’s use of the room of requirement. Nor will I inform any of the properties of the room of requirement until Deloris Umbridge No longer works for hogwarts. As long as Harry Potter does what I say for the three mentioned hours and does not speak of what happens to a living soul. So mote it may be.” Malfoy recited the pledge fluidly and glowed a bit as the magic bound him to his vow. “Well I'll be going now, bye Potter.”<br/>
Harry stood there half frozen with a sinking feeling in his stomach as Malfoy opened the giant door and disappeared from sight.<br/>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
Harry Potter was exiting class Monday when he was sunddenly pulled away from the group with a hand over his mouth to keep him from screaming. What the hell?! Malfoy turned him around. Makes sense. Malfoy thrust two potions into Harry's hand.<br/>
“I want you to take theses to granger and tell her to test what they are. One is a modified calming drought and the other is vertasium. Tell her to not mess with them and tell you the specific properties. Do not lose them and bring them on Saturday, can you understand that.”<br/>
“Fine, but why?” Harry sneered at Malfoy.<br/>
“Don't want any misunderstandings.”<br/>
“Why Hermione.” Harry asked.<br/>
“Because she is the only friend of yours that is half comment.” Malfoy paused “Oh and if you want to be parinoied bring tea and water otherwise I'll have those” Malfoy then took off leaving Harry with the two potions.<br/>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
“The frist one is a mild, well not quite mild, that also slightly enhances nerve endings. It really shouldn't work but it does. it is incredibly potent for the first five minutes, but the potency fades quickly. It lasts at half strength anywhere from ten to thirty five minutes depending on the panic levels of the drinker, from then on the effects are barely noticeable and fade in less than ten minutes. It has no lasting side effects. The second is simply vertasum. One drop and you you have to answer truthfully. Two and you have to answer. Three will put you in a daze. Six and above will cause damage.” Hermione finshed<br/>
“Hmm.” Harry thought.<br/>
“Harry.” Hermione waited but Harry was still looking away and distant. “Harry!” She half shouted at him.<br/>
“Yep, that's me.” Harry grinned weakly at her.<br/>
“What's this about?”<br/>
“Nothing at all.” Harry said<br/>
“You know you can trust me with anything.” Hermione paused and waited for Harry to answer her. “Right?” She pressed.<br/>
“Of course.”<br/>
“Here are your potions. Just know I'm always here for you.” So Malfoy was telling the truth. Who would have figured, not Harry.</p>
