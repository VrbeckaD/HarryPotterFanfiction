    <p>Chapter One<br/>
Death watched his master and his family they had all been reincarnated into this world. Severus felt the chill first he looked and saw death and grabbed his youngest son Harri while Sirius grabbed the five year old twins Cole and Caleb. Severus said "who are you and what do you want." Death looked at his two year old master he said "I have come to warn you of a virus that will happen in 15 years." The doctor in Severus wanted to know what kind of virus but this thing had appeared in his living room. Death said "I have been with Harrison since he was born into  this world watching over him I am death and he is my master you have no need to fear me." Sirius hummed "technically we do I mean your death so" Severus looked at his husband and said "how are you not a blond" Sirius looked at his husband and pouted "jerk" Death cleared his throat.</p><p>   Harrison sat in his papas lap the whole time Death talked to his parents the twins had fell asleep because of the boring conversation. Sirius mumbled "I knew something was going on when the kids were babies  they always had toys in their cribs in the morning I just assumed we did it the night before with the twins or one of the twins gave Harri the toys in the middle of the night." Severus sighed "focus love they and we have magic big deal but death is going to tell us about this virus" Sirius nodded and looked at the entity. Death said "the dead are going to start to walk in 15 years and you need to be ready" Sirius said "the dead like zombies why I mean your death can't you like not let it happen" death grunted "I can't change fate or Destiny but I can help you and your family survive I need you to train your son's to protect themselves with and without magic" Severus said "why are you helping us or telling us this you could have waited" death grunted "you wouldn't be able to build a safe zone if I had waited" he waved his hand and several trunks appeared "in these there should be everything you need but I would still buy mundane things you will need it."</p><p>    A month later<br/>
Severus looked at the land and said "it's perfect" the retailer said "are you sure sir" shocked Severus blinked "yes is there something wrong with the land" Sirius was holding Harrison while Cole and Caleb ran around chasing each other he mumbled "it is cheap a million for 1000 acres is a cheap price" the realtor said "it's cheap I agree with you there it's just it's by a prison so no one wants it too risky." Severus hummed "we aren't going to be here much we are going to build a summer home here" Wendy nodded "It really is lovely in the fall also all the tree's changing colors if there wasn't a prison nearby the land would have sold very quickly" Sirius said "well it's ours now" Severus nodded and Harrison cooed when Cole said "look at me Harri" his twin said "no Harri look at me" Harrison giggled cutely Wendy cooed "they are going to be heartbreaker's when they grow up" Sirius and Severus said at the same time "don't remind us."</p><p>  3 years later<br/>
Severus walked into the dojo and watched his youngest perform Katas the master said "next week we will start Heian Shodan well done my students" he looked at Severus and said "Severus-san" five year old Harrison looked at his father and ran over to him telling him about his day and what he had learned. Severus chuckled "ok my little Bruce Lee we have to go pick up the little Chuck Norris's from kick boxing next week you have gymnastics I have already gotten the lesson plan from Master Hojo since you won't be in class." He buckled him inside his carseat and got into the front seat he said "how was class" Harri pouted "a boy said I shouldn't be there because I'm too pretty" Severus coughed and patted his chest and grunted "how does a five year old know that word anyway did you tell him off princess" Harri grinned "of course I did" grinning with pride "and I kicked his butt I laid him flat on his back." Severus chuckled "of course" handing him a juice box.<br/>
Severus pulled up to the curb and frowned when the twins rushed into the car "go papa go" at the same time. Severus groaned at his 8 year old twins the tan skinned boys were troublemakers where ever they went. </p><p>   He looked and their teacher Miss Steven's was covered in blue and black Paint tapping her foot. Severus couldn't stop himself but he laughed and covered his mouth whatever she did it must have been bad. Severus got back 20 minutes later after being yelled at by the woman "what did she do" Cole said "she bad mouthed gay people papa and we are the only ones with two dads so we took offense" Caleb continued "so we filled a balloon with paint and put it above her door and ran" his brother nodded Severus smirked "I'm not praising you but good job I don't even want to know where the paint came from" he drove off going home for an update on the house from his husband.</p>
