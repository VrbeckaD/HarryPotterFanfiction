    <p>Jacob was 3 years old and he was alone. He wandered around the mansion with his little legs, exploring the place. His voice echoed around the house.</p><p>Jacob was 4 years old and he was still alone. He had a mini broom his uncle gave him for his birthday. He spent most of his days outside, flying on the broom. He tried to fly as high as he can, but the broom could only get 5 feet off the ground.</p><p>Jacob was 5 years old and he was still alone. He spent most of his time in the library. He liked reading books about charms and transfiguration and creatures, and he couldn't wait for the day he could finally go to Hogwarts.</p><p>Jacob was 6 years old and he was a big brother. The baby was red and wrinkly and cried all the time. She had silver hair, in contrast to Jacob's jet black hair. When the baby opened her eyes, a reflection of Jacob's blue-green eyes were staring back at him.</p><p>"Jacob, this is your sister. You are a big brother now, so you have to take care of her." says mum.</p><p>Jacob was no longer alone.</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Jacob was 6 years old and hadn't been sleeping well. Jade's cries had been keeping him up all night. It certainly didn't help that her room was right beside his. Mum usually came to calm her down, but this time for some reason mum wasn't there yet.</p><p>Jacob got up from his bed and went out from his room. He entered Jade's room and walked up to her crib. Jade's silver hair is unruly, and her face was as red as the day she was born. He tried touching her hand, and she immediately grabbed one of his finger, not letting it go. He didn't have the heart to pry those little fingers away, so he just let her. He tried to tidy her hair using his other hand, moving the hair out of her forehead, and he realised that she was running a fever.</p><p>"Jacob?"</p><p>Jacob was startled and he immediately looked behind him to find his mum standing by the door.</p><p>"She's running a fever, mum."</p><p>Mum sighed and walked to the crib. Jacob removed his finger, and mum bent down to pick Jade from her crib.</p><p>"Yeah, she's sick, Jacob," said his mum, looking sadly at the baby. She turned to look at him and smiled weakly. "You can go back to your room now. I'll take care of her. Thank you for being a good big brother."</p><p>Jacob was 7 years old, and he had lost count of how many times Jade has gotten sick. "Babies are fragile, Jacob. It's okay." said his mother. Jacob had started reading a book titled "Babies 1-3 years old: what to expect" in the library. It wasn't supposed to be this often.</p><p>Jacob was 8 years old, and he couldn't remember the last time his sister was healthy. She was always in bed, with a few days of her being cheery, laughing, babbling at him ("Jay! Jay!"), then she was back in bed again. Jacob had started to spend a lot of time in his sister's room, reading books to her. She loved stories that involved dragons.</p><p>Jacob was 9 years old when he found out that his sister was cursed. His parents were talking with the healer in his father's study, and he wanted to know what they were talking about. Luckily, he had spent years exploring the mansion and he knew that one of the air vents carried sounds from his father's study. He crouched down, and placed his left ear next to it.</p><p>"...It's getting worse." said someone he didn't recognise. Maybe it's the healer.</p><p>"Is it really the curse?" said his father.</p><p>"Yes, something like this tends to resurface after several generations. I'm so sorry."</p><p>He heard his mum sobbing. "I'm sorry, it's all my fault".</p><p>"How long does she have left?"</p><p>"We don't know, it varies. Most usually don't reach 10 years old, however."</p><p>Jacob ran from the air vent to his father's study. He didn't know how he managed to open the doors since they were locked, but he blasted open the doors. "What do you mean a curse?" he yelled angrily.</p><p>His father was enraged by his impoliteness, and dragged him upstairs to his room. He hit him, told him that he was impolite and it was unbecoming of an heir to a pureblood family, and locked him in his room. Late at night, his mother quietly came into his room and sat on the edge of his bed. Jacob was covering his face with his blanket. He was sobbing quietly. He tried to stop, but he couldn't. Boys weren't supposed to cry, according to his father.</p><p>Mum stroked his head and said nothing. They stayed like that for a while until Jacob calmed down a bit. Jacob took off his blanket and moved to sit next to his mum.<br/>
"What do you mean it's your fault?" Jacob asked quietly, looking downward, not having the courage to look into his mum's eyes.</p><p>Mum took a long time before she answered. "My ancestor was cursed. One of her children had white hair, and the child died when she was 7 years old. It sometimes reappears in one of the family members," she paused. Jacob is now looking at her, and she continues. "The last person who had it was my great aunt. She died when she was 6 years old."</p><p>Jacob knew that boys shouldn't cry, but he couldn't help it. He spent the remaining of the night being hugged by his mum.</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Jacob was 10 years old and he started reading about curses. He read about his family's curse, and he found out that the youngest victim was 4 years old and the oldest was 11 years old. It pained him knowing that Jade might not get to go to Hogwarts. Whenever he was not reading, he spent his every waking time with his sister. He did whatever his sister told him to. He decided that if she couldn't live long, he's going to make her life as happy as possible.</p><p>He lent her his mini broom one day, following her around as she flies, and she was the happiest Jacob had ever seen her. She could say his full name now, and he was so proud of her. He kinda missed her calling him Jay, though. "Jacob, I wanna ride a dragon one day! I'm gonna fly so high!" she said in-between laughing.</p><p>Jacob didn't know how to make that a reality. He knew that the nearest dragon was being kept in Gringotts, but there was no way the goblins would let them borrow it. Maybe they can go to Romania for their next holiday? But was Jade strong enough to travel? Or maybe they could hatch their own dragons? He knew that dragon breeding was outlawed by The Warlocks' Convention of 1709, but his father knew ways around the rules. However, dragons took a long time to grow and he didn't know whether his sister had time...</p><p>Jacob was 11 years old and he needed to leave for Hogwarts. He didn't want to go, he didn't want to leave Jade alone in the mansion. She was 5 years old now, they didn't know how long she got. Why would he want to spend months being away from her when she could pass away any second while he was in school? However, his father forced him to go. "How can you be our family heir without any education?!" he yelled. Jacob told him that he didn't care about being an heir at all, and he was slapped.</p><p>When he went to tell Jade that he was going to leave for Hogwarts, she started crying and wouldn't let go of him. He picked her up and brought him to his room, and that night they slept together. He left before she woke up, unable to say goodbye.</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Jacob was 11 years old and he was sorted into Slytherin. He received a letter from his father saying that he was proud of him (it was actually the first he had ever said this), and from his mum saying that Jade was getting weaker.</p><p>Jacob tried to make the best of his school years. He excelled in charms, transfigurations, and potions. He flied really well, and he was promised a position in the quidditch team next year. He slept through history of magic, but his ears perked up one day when Professor Binns mentioned "the cursed vaults" in passing.</p><p>He stayed behind that day to ask him more about it, but the professor said that it was only a myth. You see, Jacob had not given up on his independent study about curses since he came to Hogwarts. Jacob spent a lot of his time in the library to read every possible book he could about curses, but he had never heard about the cursed vaults.</p><p>The next time he came to the library, he asked Madam Pince if there was any book he could read about the cursed vaults. She said there was, but he couldn't read it since the book was inside the restricted section. That night, he sneaked into the restricted section to search for that book. He found a book about that mentioned the cursed vaults, and the only sentence that stuck to his mind was that anyone who managed to open it could find whatever they wanted inside the vaults.<br/>
Whatever he wanted...?</p><p>Now, whenever he was not in classes, he spent his time researching the cursed vaults. One day, he found an unused room in the corridor. He converted the room to be his hideout, filling it with various informations he could find about the cursed vaults. He refused to believe that they were only a legend. It was the only thing that prevented him from breaking down in between all those letters from his mum, telling him that Jade's condition was deteriorating every single day.</p><p>Unfortunately, by the end of the year, he still hadn't managed to find any vault.</p><p>When he came home at the end of the year, Jade was unconscious. His mum told him that she had been gradually getting worse, and that she hadn't woken up for three days now. Jacob spent the night next to his sister's bed, berating himself for being a useless big brother.</p><p>He was woken up by Jade the next morning.</p><p>"Jacob...?" she said quietly.</p><p>Jacob immediately opened his eyes and looked at his sister. "Yeah, Jade, it's Jacob. I'm home. How are you feeling?"</p><p>"Good," she said, but Jacob couldn't help but notice that she looked dangerously pale. "How was Hogwarts?"</p><p>"Boring without you."</p><p>Jade smiled, and Jacob realised how much he missed her.</p>
