    <p>The halls of Hogwarts was flooding with students who were franticly trying to get to their classes. Thomas however, one of the fifth years, were on his way to the great hall. He was ordered by Albus himself yesterday to practice some cleaning spells after breakfest this morning. Dumbledore knew Thomas have had some problems with his "social skills" and therefor decide he should have some time to practice by himself and possibly with some of the teachers as well.<br/><br/>Thomas was well on his way when he caught the glips of one of his teachers, his teacher in Potions Severus Snape. Thomas had always been on his guard when it comes to Snape but he hadnt bothered to worry about him.<br/><br/>He had soon found his way to the great hall where he had been ordered to clean. He was happy to help out and more than happy to skip some classes because of it. His first move was to move all the plates, forks and knives to the kitchen area leaving that up to the other maids.   Afte he had moved the plates he went on to clean the tables, using his want to lift some rags and rubbing them on the tables.<br/>"This isnt so hard" he said to himself, or so he thought. "Well i would expect so, its only tables".<br/>He dropped everything including his wand and froze completly in shock. Then he turned around only to see Snape standing in the massive doorway that leads out to the hallways. "P-professor Snape! Dont you have c-classes to attend to...?" Thomas said with a slight voice crack as he watched the taller, raven haired mad approach slowly. "I was informed you had cleaning duties as assigned by Dumbledore, and i was accuired to help." he said in a slightly annoyed voice. His casual resting bitch face watching him closely.<br/>Thomas frowned slightly as the thought struck him, "I am perfectly capable to do this on my own thank you" he replied with slight sass.<br/>Snape mearly grunted in reply and looked at Thomas as if he just said the stupidest thing.<br/>"I think we both know a student of your caliber could need assistance with...most things" Snape teased but in his casual serious voice and ways. "But your...magical skills aside, i am sure you are aware of tonight ball. That is why i am here to assist you in decorating and cleaning and such..". "Oh, that i nearly forgot. I guess i could need an extra pair of hands" Thomas agreed, picking up his wand he dropped. He used slightly more time than normal due to his wand having rolled under one of the long tables and once he got back up he watched as Snape looked unamused at him and carried on with his decorating.<br/><br/>After many hours of trail and error, banners falling down here and there, as well as ontop of Snape, they were finally finished. The Great hall was decorated in multiple colors and various festive banners, sparkley orbs, tapestry and silly string looking decor splayed out on the tables. "This doesnt look half bad, what do you think?" Thomas asked, slightly sweaty and at the same time pleased with the outcome.<br/>"Hm..indeed it looks pleasent." Snape mumbles, although not being a man of showing feelings he was deep down pleased with this as well. Thomas had, after spending this time with Snape, a much more positive feeling towards him now. He was not sure in what way, but he was scared as well as glad it was in a way he had never felt before.<br/><br/><br/>-Only moments before the ball begins-<br/><br/><br/>Thomas had helped his dormmates out with their clothing as well as them helping him. "Thanks guys, i believe im ready to go now, what do you think?" He asked his friends and awaited their response while posing just for laughs. They all laughed together and headed down to the great hall.<br/>Being a fifth year had its benefits, such as being allowed to drink during the ball. Which was exactly what he was going to do.<br/><br/>After Dumbledore had announced the ball had begun most student had started getting rather noisy, so Thomas and his friends decided to go out to the hall and have a good time there talking about memories and other silly things they have done on past balls. As well as drinking of course. Turns out that wasnt rather smart... </p><p>-Mearly 1 hour after they started to drink Thomas was already in on a bet he soon would regret. Or would he?-<br/><br/>"C'mon do it! Its not that risky you wuss"<br/>"Yeeaaah, i mean we all know you have a thing for him, i bet hes wasted as well Tommy!"<br/>They were all trying to convince him to do a dare they came up with after they found out he had gotten help from Snape to decorate the great hall. That dare was to hit on him.<br/>"Fine! Fine...but if i get in trouble you can aaall bet im gonna take it out on you guys!" He threatened half seriously.<br/><br/>Thomas wandered over to the table surrounded by teachers having a casual conversation, allthough he could not seem to spot Snape, he decided to ask McGonagall. "Professor McGonagall? Have you seen Professor Snape? I have some questions about this potion we are working on..." he asked rubbing his arm. "Why yes i believe i saw him wall to his dorm" she said before returning to her previous conversation.<br/><br/>Thomas then proceeded to Snapes dorm, knocking on his door before taking a step back. Some footsteps approaching the door before it opend, a slightly annoyed Severus Snape peaked out and looked down at him with a frown. "What do you want, there is a ball just downstairs..." he hissed. "Well i didnt see you at the staff table so i thought you'd want company!" Thomas said cheerfully.<br/>In response Snape only closed thw door on him, before he managed to do that Thomas was already squeasing inbetween the door and into Snapes room. "C'mon! We can have fun right! I even brought some mead~" he said gesturing to a bottle he pulled out from a pocket inside his robes. "What is this? Are you drunk?" he questioned and stepped closer just to smell his breath to confirm. This made Snape think for a second, he started to debate in his brain and decide to take action. He sighed, "How much did you drink Thomas...".<br/>Thomas only smiled in response as he stumbled around the space between Snapes desk filled with half empty potions and papers and his bed. That made Snape make up his mind. "You know what...i know you wont leave by yourself so... yes, i would like a drink." He said, forcing a smile.<br/>"Really?! Oh we will have so much fun you and i! Here, take a sip its delicious!" Snape agreed with a nod and took a sip of the flask.<br/><br/>Not only 30 minutes after Snape was as good as wasted, surprisingly he doesnt seem that way. But the way he was talking gave it away, as well as the light red in his usually pale cheeks. "-and then after she noticed the practicly jumped out of her seat and fell backwards onto Hagrid!" Thomas said before laughing and falling back on the bed. "Ah, that is amusing indeed" Snape agreed slightly chuckling. He, as well, lays down on his back on the bed, relaxing after the semi heavy drinking. Thomas turn to look at him and blushes slightly but just enought for Snape to notice. Thomas then on impulls leaned over to give him a peck on the cheek. At that point it felt like the world was standing still for the both of them. Thomas started blushing alot more, his cheeks feeling as if they were on fire. Even if that was from the booze or not he knew he got a feeling in his stomach he had never had before. Snape broke the silence, "What...was the reason for that...". It went silent again. Out of pure stress and probably beimg drunk as well, Thomas dove in for another kiss and without warning Snape stopped him. It was a moment of awkward staring right before Thomas felt a hand snake up his back and up to his neck, which soon pulled him in for a kiss. He was surprised as well as glad, glad he wasnt the only one who wanted to engage in this and surprised the man who DID engage in it was Severus Snape, the most feared teacher at Hogwarts.<br/><br/>The kiss laster for several minutes and evolved into full on making out. Both of them drunk out their asses and possibly about to do something they will regret dearly. Inbetween kisses, "S-snape...why are you...what is this...". They continue for a while before Snape finally decides to pull away. He suddenly had his usual serious face on. "Thomas...".</p>
