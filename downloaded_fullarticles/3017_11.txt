    <p>The day before, Sirius Black had decided that he was finally alright.</p><p>For the first time in his life, Sirius felt like things had actually berin looking up for him; that he might possibly be able to be happy. Yes, Sirius was okay at that moment. How could he not be? Everything was perfect. The common room was empty save for the Marauders, and Sirius was the only one of them still awake.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Peter had fallen asleep studying for the Potions test that he was bound to fail because, let's be honest, Peter was absolutely <em>rubbish</em> at potions. (Even more so than Remus, and Remus had once managed to melt his entire cauldron and his half of the table before Slughorn could contain whatever 'potion' he had concocted.) James had fallen asleep, glasses askew, on one of the comfy chairs beside the sofa in the Gryffindor common room after pining after Evans for an hour and a half. That left just him and Remus, who were residing on the sofa in front of the fireplace. Remus had dropped his head on Sirius' shoulder about forty minutes before and was snoring softly. Sirius had leaned his cheek against the top of taller boy's head. He never wanted to move from this position.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span> </p><p>It was all so simple that Sirius felt like he was just any other teen and not a complete and utter disappointment of a son. Like he wasn't a fifteen year old forced to have the emotional maturity of a fifty year old. It reminded Sirius that he was here, and this was real; that he had friends that loved him and wanted to spend time with him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Sirius has always been the last one awake, although most of the time Remus only fell asleep about twenty minutes before Sirius did. At first, it was because he felt too vulnerable when he closed his eyes. He felt like at any second he would feel the familiar sting of the Cruciatus curse, and not be able to move for hours. After years of being hexed for not paying attention, or for just closing his eyes in the middle of the day, Sirius grew very weary of sleeping in front of others. He knew that none of the Marauders would hit him with a unforgivable (pranking was completely different, however), he knew he was being silly, but it was nearly impossible to not get anxious about dozing off. He finally managed to get better throughout the years, as he is rarely around his own parents anymore. Now, Sirius liked being the last one awake because he could observe how beautiful Remus was without fear of anyone catching him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Sirius could look at the delicate, pale eyelashes, and the slightly chapped lips that were open the tiniest bit, showing Remus' naturally straight teeth. He could observe the bigger details, like the fact that Remus' face lightly flushed when he was sleeping, so his cheeks and nose, and the freckles that were littered across them, had a rosy tint that you could only see if you tried to— and Sirius was trying to. He could memorize the curve of Remus' nose and the sharpness of his jawline and cheekbones, just the beautifully proportionate face structure. He could finally tuck the curl that managed to fall on Remus' forehead at the beginning of the day behind Remus' ear for him as long as he did it so delicately that he didn't cause the werewolf to stir.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>He knew it was rather creepy, but Remus just looked so damn pretty when he slept, and watching him sleep made Sirius feel like Remus was his, like he and Remus were a married couple that got to fall asleep and wake up to each other every morning. It gave Sirius a rush of euphoria and peace, and he wanted so badly to be able to hold that feeling forever.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>The day before, Sirius Black had decided that he was finally going to tell Remus how he felt— he just wasn't quite sure how exactly that was yet though.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>He was painfully aware of how his cheeks slightly flushed every time Remus smirked at him after he'd made one of his infamous sarcastic remarks. In fact, the first time Sirius' feelings shifted from platonic to something more was very memorable in his eyes. It was third year when it happened. He remembers James droning on about Lily, and Remus coming up with one of his wittiest remarks to date. Remus, like usual, had his nose tucked into a book, but then the book leaned down and Remus was smirking at Sirius. His own reaction was embarrassing, and he hated thinking about how that smirk had made him retreat to the bathroom for a second to think about unpleasant things such as his grandmother naked. Sirius has liked to argue to himself since then that things have gotten a lot more under control, as now most of the blood flows to his cheeks and not to— well, a lower part of his body.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Sirius also knew of how his heartbeat quickened every time Remus reached for something causing his shirt to ride up slightly, revealing his ever-so-perfectly flat stomach. Sometimes when it was hot, Remus would leave his robes in the common room, and undo his tie, leaving it to hang loosely around his neck. He'd have the first few buttons of his shirt undone, and his sleeves rolled up. Those were the days when Sirius was quietest, as he couldn't look up for too long without wanted to instantly hound Remus with confessions of his undying love.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>He was familiar with the feelings of desire to hold Moony's hand and steal kisses between classes. He was also no stranger to the urge to take Moony to Hogsmead and buy him all of the chocolate the village had to offer, to wear Remus' jumpers, and to give Remus his leather jacket everytime he got cold. The thing Sirius was most painfully aware of, however, was that these things that he felt toward his friend were things that a normal fifteen year old wouldn't.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>The day before, Sirius Black had decided that he needed to figure out when the best time to tell Moony that he had not-so-normal feelings for him would be.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>He knew that it needed to be soon, as he wasn't sure he could last much longer without spontaneously combusting. Sirius was scared, though, because he had absolutely no idea how Remus would react, and Sirius knew that he wouldn't be able to handle ruining his friendship with Remus. It was nearly the end of fifth year, so he'd have around two more years of constant contact with Remus if things went awry. Not to mention, if things became awkward with him and Remus, then things would be awkward with all of the Marauders, and he’d lose the first true friends he’d ever had. Sirius knew how much of a risk it was to confess his feelings for his younger mate; he couldn't stand the idea of ruining the dynamics of the Marauders. Sirius was uncomfortable with the thoughts of his friends picking sides between Remus and himself, as he knew that James would probably pick him, and Peter would follow, leaving Remus alone. But the thing was, Sirius <em>had</em> to do this, so he might as well be prepared with the whens and hows.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>He’d thought about coming clean while Moony was in the hospital wing, so he couldn't escape, but figured that he shouldn't put that kind of stress on Remus immediately after a full moon. Remus also wasn't the most pleasant person for a few days before or after a full moon, although no one could honestly blame him for that.</p><p>He’d thought of enchanting the stars on the ceiling of the great hall to ask Remus out, but decided that it was seemingly impossible and tried again. Sirius may have been decent at transfiguration, but he figured that it wasn't the most rock-solid plan he could come up with. There were too many variables with that idea.</p><p>Sirius was so desperate that he even began pondering<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>the idea of writing Remus a sappy love letter, but then again, that didn't fit his punk rock aesthetic. (Although, Sirius wasn't sure how dating a bloke would fit into that aesthetic either, but when the bloke in question was Remus Lupin, Sirius decided it was worth risking. Besides, Remus was totally punk rock, no matter how much he refuses to say so.)</p><p>  After brainstorming for at least an hour, Sirius finally concluded that he would just talk to Remus alone like a normal person would. Honestly, how hard could that be? Sirius and Remus had had plenty of —intense conversations, if you will. The worst that could happen would be Remus freaking out and then the whole group would be fucked. Yeah, how hard could it be?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>The day before, Sirius Black had decided that he needed to stop cutting.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Sirius recognized that this was probably easier said than done, but he also recognized that it needed to be done. Sirius had his reasons to stop anyways, it wasn't like it was a spur of the moment decision, it was more of a 'i've needed to do this for years, but i think today's finally the day' type of decision.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>For starters, Sirius didn't want to worry Moony about problems as mundane as his own when Moony was a fucking werewolf and still on this earth. He knew that if things went okay when he admitted his feelings to the lovely Moony, eventually there might be an instance where Sirius can't wear sleeves or trousers, and if one should arise, he didn't want there to be any fresh cuts. The previous scars would always be there, there wasn't a spell on earth that could get rid of them as far as Sirius was aware, but he didn't want to raise concern about new cuts.</p><p>Sirius also figured that it would be nice to be able to get undressed, or wear shorter clothing rather, around anyone, not just Moony. He knew that he couldn't very well just run around with fresh cuts on his arms though. Sirius just missed going to the pool, or being able to roll up his sleeves during the summer or just on a regular school day in concentration. He also wanted share clothes with Moony all of the time, but he couldn't do that if he didn't stop cutting. You can't just expect people to ignore giant cuts on your arm and not ask how they got there.</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>The day before, Sirius Black had finally begun to get his life in order.</p>
