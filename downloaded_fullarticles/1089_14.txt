    <p>Fire and ringing, that’s all the man heard as he got to his feet. However, instead of the sun on his face, he saw a man with a gun pointed at him. “Die you monster,” the man with the gun said to the other as he held up his hands in surrender.</p><p>“Please don’t do this. I’m not a monster. Let me go please,” the man with the sandy-graying hair and amber eyes said as he stared right at the gun.</p><p>“I don’t think so. You are a monster,” with that the man fired his gun and a silver bullet came out hinting the older man in the shoulder.</p><p>“Dad!” a voice of a child called as he ran over to his father. “Dad? Dad?!” the boy called to his father. However, he did not say anything for a while.</p><p>“Your dad’s dying kid. I think you have to find a new one, one that’s not a monster,” he laughed and walked out of view.</p><p>“Dad? Dad? Wake up, please. I need you; I can’t be alone please, I need you,” the boy cried as he shook his father trying to wake him, but his father did not wake. Tears fell from the boy’s eyes and his hair turned from blue to red.  Then the boy yelled out in anger and rage as the little wolf inside came out. “Noooooooooooooo!” he called as tears fell from his eyes and held his father close. “I won't leave you. I can't leave you. Dad, Dad? Help, help me, please! Someone, please!” the boy called but the fire was all around them and got closer and closer to the boy and his dead father. The boy closed his eyes and waited, for the fire to kill him too so he can be with his father as well as his mother. “Don’t worry dad. I will see you again,” he whispered as the fire burned everything around him and soon that’s all he could see.</p><p>              Edward “Teddy” Remus Lupin woke with a scream so loud that it woke his father and everyone in the house. “Teddy?” Remus John Lupin called as he ran into his son's room in the middle of the night. “Teddy. Are you ok? What happened?” Remus asked as he sat down on his bed with the rest of Teddy’s family in the doorway. “I got this. You guys can go back to sleep,” the others nodded and walked out of the room.  Teddy was shaking with his hair a dull gray. While tears poured out of his eyes. Remus sighed and took his nine-year-old son into his arms.</p><p>“A……. A……man, man came…. came, he set the house on fire killing everyone, everyone and then found, found you, he………….” Teddy trailed off as more tears came out of his eyes and started to cry. “I, I………” he tried again but failed as Remus pulled his son into his arms.</p><p>“Its ok cub. It was just a dream. I’m right here. Harry’s still here as well as his family and Sirius. Do you want to get some hot cocoa?” Remus asked with a smile while his son nodded, and Remus wiped the tears from his eyes.</p><p>“Thanks, dad….um………….” Teddy cut off as he got out of his bed and this is when Remus saw that he was wearing Tonks’s Hufflepuff scarf around his neck while he slept. Remus smiled warmly and took his son’s hand as he wiped the tears also from his eyes. Soon father and son walked out of the room to have a midnight snack. Remus smiled at his son who took a drink from his mug and listened to his father as he told him stories about his time at Hogwarts.</p>
