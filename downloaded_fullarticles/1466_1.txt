    <p>
  <span>A lot can be said in the defence of public transport unless one has actually had to rely on it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The rail replacement bus, for instance, is an almost mythical creature that few can claim to have used, let alone seen. The unoccupied seat on a full night bus leaving Camden can never be trusted.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Some unlucky commuters dared to use the Piccadilly Line from Osterley to Cockfosters one Saturday in July. They tried to hold their breath the entire time, but by Holborn, gave in and took an ill-advised deep breath. It was ill-advised because their noses just happened to be pressed into the hairy armpit of a large construction worker and they promptly passed out.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Having one’s own car was, in this current economic and ecological climate frowned upon as Not A Good Thing. But Hermione Granger was a rebel.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yeah, baby. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She was known for breaking rules and conventions in society all the time. Hell, she even fought a war as a teenager. If she wanted her own car, then by Merlin, she’ll have one.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione pulled her Toyota Camry into the parking lot of Patricia’s (</span>
  <em>
    <span>please, call her Trixie</span>
  </em>
  <span>) apartment building. Being the amazing friend that she is, she offered to give Patricia’s (</span>
  <em>
    <span>seriously Minny, you can all me Trixie or even Trix</span>
  </em>
  <span>) boyfriend a lift to New York City from Boston.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She had met Patricia (</span>
  <em>
    <span>Minny, only my mom calls me Patricia</span>
  </em>
  <span>) the same way most women meet in a male-dominated environment - they shared a lunch table and bonded over a love of wine, pasta, and The Great British Bake Off. According to Patricia (</span>
  <em>
    <span>Do not call me Pat, okay?</span>
  </em>
  <span>) this was enough to ask Hermione for the favour, which she was more than happy to do seeing as how she was making the trip anyway.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It’s just over 4 hours away. Surely it won’t be a hardship, especially if this boyfriend is up for some carpool karaoke. Hermione had a playlist ready to rock.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Patricia (</span>
  <em>
    <span>oh my Gawd Minny, stop it!)</span>
  </em>
  <span> was standing in the parking lot wrapped around a tall man and was currently snogging the ever-loving Morgana out of him. Hermione winced as she pulled up next to the couple as they seemed to be trying to re-enact the old Spice Girls hit </span>
  <em>
    <span>When Two Become One</span>
  </em>
  <span> right there in public. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Disgusting.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione felt it in everyone’s best interests if she put a stop to this awful, public indecency charge waiting to happen, and leaned on the hooter.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The couple sprung apart and Hermione finally saw the boyfriend’s face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remember that July Tube trip from Osterley to Cockfosters? That was suddenly seeming far more appealing than the next four hours of her life.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Minny! You’re here!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Patricia swung from Draco Malfoy’s hickie littered neck. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione wanted to sink under the steering wheel but reminded herself that she was an adult and that meant being civil when needed. She also made a mental note to reward herself with the most expensive bottle of wine she could afford when she got to New York.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This is Minny?” Draco’s eyebrows couldn’t seem to settle on an expression and hovered midway up his forehead.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah baby,” Patricia gave him a peck on the cheek. “Minny, this is my boyfriend, David Malone.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione choked on some spit and nearly bit her tongue. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Patricia turned back to Draco and kissed him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m gonna miss you baby.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Another kiss.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Text me on the way.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Another kiss.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Call me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Another kiss that soon went from PG-13 to flirting with an R rating.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione may have accidentally leaned on the hooter. “Sorry. We should leave now, or we’ll be stuck in traffic.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She popped open the boot of the sedan and thankfully Draco understood that it was his cue to load his luggage into it, which consisted of one battered, dark blue suitcase, a duffel bag and a metal briefcase. With one last, lingering kiss, Draco finally broke free of Patricia and climbed into the passenger seat of the car.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Minny.” His smile dripped with mockery. “Shall we go?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione grit her teeth and guided the car out of the parking lot and onto the road.</span>
</p><p>
  <span></span></p>
<hr/><p>
  <span>They had been on the road for about half an hour when Malfoy suddenly spoke up.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s killing you, isn’t it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What is?” Hermione was doing her best to feign ignorance.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The fact that you have so many questions and I won’t answer them.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is that so?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You are dying to know what I’m doing in America with a Muggle girlfriend. You want to know why I’m going to New York and why I needed the lift.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione kept her eyes on the road, almost trying to imagine he wasn’t there. “I have no idea what you’re talking about.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh come on Granger. If you were a cat, you’d have died of curiosity ages ago.” He leaned back into his seat and stretched his legs with a grimace. “You couldn’t have chosen something with a little more space?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t have passengers in my car often enough.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The silence stretched along with the kilometres as they drove. Malfoy dug out a packet of M&amp;Ms from one of his pockets and began to pop them, one by one, into his mouth.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His good mood worked on Hermione’s paranoia. Surely he was up to something nefarious? That was the only reason he was in such a pleasant mood. She could deal with Malfoy being mean or angry or quiet. A chipper Malfoy was an unknown creature and one she felt needed to be handled with caution. But he was right, the smug bastard. Hermione was slowly spiralling into imagining all sorts of scenarios about his presence in the States. Was he a fugitive from the law? Had his family kicked him out? Was karma just bored and decided to mess with her? This whole situation had her off-kilter and she didn’t like it one bit.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So, why are you in the States?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Forty-eight minutes and twenty seconds. I owe myself a tenner. I really thought you would hold on until at least an hour had passed.” He popped another M&amp;M into his mouth.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione side-eyed him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t look at me like that,” he scoffed. “I’m not about to start throwing curses around. Look, I came to the States for some education, realised Muggle girls are a lot of fun and now I’m heading to New York to take over the family business. I don’t like public transport, I’m still on apparition restrictions and I never got a Muggle drivers license. Happy?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This has nothing to do with my happiness, Malfoy. I’m just relieved you realise the futility in cursing the driver.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Malfoy huffed. “Look, I’m trying to be nice. Humour me and play along, will you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nice? How does one navigate a conversation with someone when nice had never before been an option with them? </span>
  <span>Careful Granger, for here be monsters. Of sorts. Some sort of reptile, surely. Right? On the other hand, maybe being an adult meant giving someone else the benefit of the doubt. But did Malfoy deserve it?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fine. Just keep the insults to a minimum and we should get along just fine.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Evidently Hermione’s sub-concious thought he did.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It took four songs including a spirited sing-along to AC/DC by Malfoy before he spoke up again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What’s your story?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think the more important question here is; when did you learn all the lyrics to Shook Me All Night Long?” She gave him a sideways glance.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That is neither here nor there, but five points to Gryffindor for trying to dodge the question. </span>
  <span>Come on Granger. Remember, I’m trying to be nice. Also, I’m bored. Maybe your prattling will make the time pass faster.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You can’t seem to help yourself, can you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Excuse me?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You just have this way of insulting me while making it seem like a compliment. That’s offensive.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Malfoy rolled his eyes. “I’m starting to regret asking.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, no. You asked. So I will prattle all the way to New York. See, this is being nice too.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione then launched into a long-winded story of why she was in the States and what her plans were. She got a special joy when repeating verbatim conversations she’d had with Patricia making Malfoy wince.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The kilometres kept rushing by.</span>
</p><p>
  <span></span></p>
<hr/><p>
  <span>“That’s ridiculous. Only a hopeless romantic would want Bergman to stay.” Hermione pulled the Camry into the parking lot of a Waffle House just off the interstate near New Haven.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So you’re saying you’d rather be the First Lady of Czechoslovakia than have amazing sex the rest of your life?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m saying I can’t believe you’ve actually watched Casablanca. And the two are not mutually exclusive.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh please, only someone who hasn’t had great sex will agree to that.” Malfoy pushed the door to the Waffle House open and waved her in ahead of him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ve had plenty of great sex,” she exclaimed walking in.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The hostess at the door choked on her greeting and simply led them to a nearby booth.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Malfoy slid in across from Hermione, a glint in his eye. “You won’t know that you’ve had great sex until you actually have it. Right now, you’re assuming the mediocre shags you’ve sighed through have been great. You haven’t got a decent baseline of reference and that is why you’d rather be the first lady than have decent sex.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re disgusting.” She put up the menu to block out his smirk.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Soon the waitress came over for their order.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Just some coffee and the pancake stack,” Malfoy ordered.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is your pastrami sourced locally?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The waitress shrugged.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What about your bread? Is it baked on the premises?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It gets delivered in the mornings, that’s all I know.” The waitress looked as if she was trying really hard not to roll her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So you aren’t sure of the source of the food in your kitchens?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A farm, probably.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But is it a local farm? You know what, nevermind. I will just have the chips - I mean fries.”  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The waitress took Hermione’s order in-stride, while Malfoy worked hard not to gape.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So, why did you break up with Ron? Was it the bad sex you were having?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t be vulgar, Malfoy.” Hermione crossed her arms. “The sex was fine. We just wanted different things. Besides, the success rate of school romances is so low, I’m surprised anyone marries the person they dated in school.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Malfoy smirked. “It’s the name, Granger. Anyone with a name that makes you wince, is not a good name for sex. Think about it; </span>
  <em>
    <span>Oh Ron, right there...Ron.</span>
  </em>
  <span> Makes you feel dirty afterwards, and not in a good way.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not discussing this further with you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ergo, never had great sex.” He leaned back as the waitress brought their coffee.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione ignored him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span></span></p>
<hr/><p>
  <span>Malfoy had finished his food and was sipping his second cup of coffee, watching Hermione as she worked out the bill, splitting it precisely.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You owe $7.25,” she said, counting out her change for the bill fold.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Malfoy pulled out a ten-dollar note, dropped it on top and stood to leave. He waited for Hermione to finish and ushered her back to the car, the sun having set long ago.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You know,” he said, watching her over the top of the car as she unlocked it and was climbing in. She paused at his words. “Objectively, you’re an attractive woman.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione frowned and climbed into the car.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That is weird on so many levels.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Malfoy settled into the passenger seat. “I don’t see why you think that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Malfoy, you spent most of our childhood insulting my appearance and now, suddenly you’re telling me I’m attractive.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Objectively. You know, based on society’s norms and standards. You’ve fixed your teeth, grown into your curves and somehow, well, okay, not completely conquered your hair. It's impressive.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re shameless.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Which leads me to conclude that ultimately, we cannot be friends.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione pulled out of the parking lot and back onto the interstate. “So what you’re saying is that we can’t be friends because you find me attractive? Not because I’m Muggle-born, or a former member of the Order, or even smarter than you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ve grown as a person, Granger. My views of the world have changed. Exhibit A: my Muggle girlfriend. Exhibit B: avoiding the wizarding world. I can’t be prejudiced anymore.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Unless it’s against attractive people.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, you can’t be friends with someone you want to have sex with.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You want to have sex with me? First off, that’s cheating on your girlfriend and secondly, what makes you think I want to have sex with you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, Granger, you’re missing the point. I don’t want to have sex with you specifically. It’s just that, as a good looking woman, I can’t be friends with you because, in the long run, the physical attraction will lead us to sex and kill our friendship. See, attractive people are always thinking about sleeping with other attractive people, ergo, they cannot be friends.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You need to get your head checked.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I stand by what I said.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione sighed. New York was a big city and even though they had a tumultuous past, it would have been nice to know at least one other person there. “It really is a pity you allow yourself to be ruled by your cock.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why’s that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re the only person I know in New York and it’s preventing us from being friends.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Malfoy was quiet the rest of the way.</span>
