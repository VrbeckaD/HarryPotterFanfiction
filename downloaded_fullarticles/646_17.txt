    <p>Caelum Malfoy Potter was not the most popular of kids. In fact, he wasn’t popular at all. When his years at Hogwarts first began, he had been thrilled. He thought of it as an opportunity to meet new people, to mingle and make friends who could actually understand his peculiar ways. Muggle school had been difficult for the boy. He had been the outcast. No one had allowed him the opportunity to actually indulge in a conversation with others of his age, his colleagues had always just ignore his presence with hidden sneers of distaste. Hogwarts would be different though, or so he had thought. <br/>	The eleven year old boy believed he was going to meet others on the train that would lead him to his new school but he was wrong. No one had sat beside him, he had had to face the journey all by himself. The next hopeful thought arrived during the sorting ceremony. When the magical talking hat shouted “Slytherin!”, Caelum felt his heart beat with glee. Surely he would make friends just by sitting beside someone at his house’s table. He didn’t. In fact, not even his roommates gave him a chance. When he approached the three boys who were chatting excitedly on the floor of what was to be his room, they stopped talking to release the word “freak”. He had never thought of himself as a, how hey had put it, “freak” but his mind was to be changed. Due to his famous surnames, the nature of his birth was well known at Hogwarts and that seemed to have made him, automatically, someone no one wanted to be around. Yes, Caelum Malfoy Potter was definitely not the most popular of kids.</p>
