          <div class="userstuff"><p>Our story begins shortly before Dudley Dursley and Piers Polkiss's wedding. Dudley is with his best man, Harry Potter.</p><p>Dudley said, "Thanks for agreeing to this madness, Harry.</p><p>Harry smirked. "I'm your cousin, I had no choice in the matter."</p><p>Dudley gasped. "Are you serious?"</p><p>Harry assured him, "No, Dud. I chose to be here for you today."</p><p>Dudley smiled. "Even after all of the er, ah; eh..."</p><p>Harry guessed, "Bullying?"</p><p>Dudley nodded.</p><p>Harry reassured him, "It came from a place of love." He held his arm out and asked, "Shall we?"</p><p>Dudley nodded.</p><p>He hooked his arm through Harry's and they took their place by the altar.</p><p>Harry grinned. "Don't be so nervous, at least you're not playing the bride's role."</p><p>Dudley laughed.</p><p>Soon, the wedding march began and Dudley saw Piers looking more dashing than usual. He winked at him as he passed.</p><p>Piers beamed, "Looking handsome, Dud."</p><p>Dudley whispered, "You too."</p><p>Their officiator was Mrs Figg who was delighted to hear about the two bullies' hearts melting.</p><p>Mrs Figg cleared her throat and began, "Ladies and gentlemen, witches and wizards; thank you one and all for attending this momentous occasion."</p><p>The guests clapped.</p><p>Mrs Figg went on, "First, the vows. You may go first, Dudley; dear."</p><p>Dudley recited, "I've always liked you because we're so alike. At first, I thought you were just another bully in my gang, but as time flew by; I realised you were different from the rest of the gang. I felt a love for you that I had never felt before and that scared me because I didn't think you would love me back. But, for once in my life I was wrong."</p><p>A few laughs came from the guests.</p><p>Dudley went on, "And I'm glad I was wrong because look where we are now."</p><p>Mrs Figg turned to Piers and told him, "It's your turn, dear."</p><p>Piers smiled. "I want to keep it brief, so all that I really need to say to you is this; I love you more than I've ever loved anyone else and I'm glad you were wrong too."</p><p>Mrs Figg declared, "I now pronounce you husband and husband, you may kiss the groom!"</p><p>Dudley pulled Piers into a soft, sweet kiss to cheers from the guests.</p></div>
