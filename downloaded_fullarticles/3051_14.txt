    <p>The woods behind Sirius’ small cottage were his favorite place in the world to spend his free time.  Not for any particular reason, mind you.  The air was simply fresher out there.  The trees were quite treelike, in both appearance and nature.  The ground was, well, usually pretty solid even after a good rain, unless you found yourself walking too close to the marshes a few kilometers away.  Then it was a bit soggy and might ruin your favorite pair of boots.  Everything was serene and peaceful and smelled of moss, juniper, and just a hint of wet earth.  What wasn’t there to like?</p><p>That favoritism in no way had anything to do with the fact that it also happened to be the very place he’d first seen his love-at-first-sight in a chance encounter one afternoon during a stroll, whereupon they’d shared a fleeting glance through the bushes on opposite ends of a streambank and he had thus returned every single day post hence, searching for the gorgeous bronze-skinned man with bright amber eyes and a head full of messy, honeyed curls.  Certainly not.  That would be mad.</p><p>Sirius awoke early Wednesday morning to the sun’s golden rays peeking through the curtains in his usually dark room, and the obnoxiously loud squawk of several birds directly outside the window.  At least, he thought they were birds.  It might have been squirrels screaming from the power lines.  Definitely a woodland creature, of some sort.  It was hard to tell them apart when he was still groggy and half-asleep. </p><p>Grunting out a displeased protest of sorts, he rolled over and burrowed himself even deeper beneath the thick duvet.</p><p>The peace had lasted all of five minutes before the phone on his nightstand started to buzz.  Reaching out blindly from the darkness, he attempted to shut the thing up quickly and go back to bed.  After six straight fails and a spilled glass of water later, Sirius begrudgingly sat up, rubbing the remnants of sleep from his eyes.</p><p>Of course, by that time the phone wasn’t even ringing anymore.  Since he had a pretty good idea of who it was that was pestering him at nine fifteen on a weekday, and why, chances were the git would call back soon.  If he was correct, he had about ten minutes to get up, find something clean from the pile of crumpled clothing items littering the floor, and place the kettle on the stove.  If he was lucky, he might even get to eat something, too.</p><p>After exactly ten minutes on the dot Sirius was busy nursing a steaming cup of much-needed coffee, running through the last minute edits he’d done on his laptop the night before when the vibrations started to hum on the kitchen table.  Without even looking at the caller ID on the screen, he clicked the green button and placed the phone up to his ear, heaving a sigh into the receiver.</p><p>“Good morning to you, too, mate,” the voice chirped sarcastically, “and it’s good to know you didn’t fall into a hole and break your leg while chasing after your hallucination.  Or get eaten alive by a bear.  A short text last night would have been nice so I know you’re not dead or something.”</p><p>“We’ve been over this, Prongs,” Sirius drawled, frowning as he squinted at the computer screen.  What in the seven hells was he thinking last night?  Was irreverent even used properly in that sentence?  Closing the laptop’s lid, he ran his free hand down his face.  “It wasn’t a hallucination, I actually saw him.  And I’m not going to get eaten by a bear.  There aren’t even any wild bears left in the British Isles.  They’ve all been hunted off long ago.  Short of an attack by a group of rabid Pine Martens, I’m quite safe from death by mauling.”</p><p>“Well then the falling thing,” the man snapped, voice going farther away for a moment as the sound of background noise slowly trickled in.  A baby cooed and squealed right next to the mic and he had to pull the phone away from his face to protect his eardrum from permanent damage.  “For all I know, you could be lying in a ditch somewhere unless you tell me that you’re safe and sound each night.  You know how I worry.”</p><p>“Sorry, mum.”  Taking a loud slurp of coffee, he set it down, leaning back into the chair with a smirk.  “I’ll try harder to be more considerate of your feelings in the future.”</p><p>James sniffed dramatically.  “See that you do, young man.  I have enough stress in my life with Harry getting into everything he sees and attempting to kill himself on a daily basis.  I’d like at least one of my children to act like the responsible adult he pretends to be.”</p><p>“Pretends,” Sirius gasped, pulling a piece of long hair over his upper lip and squinting at the reflection of himself on the side of his cup.  Definitely not a good look for him.  “I take mild offense to that!  Why, just last night I stayed up until half past three finishing the revisions on my latest chapter.  I’d say that’s tons responsible.  You should be praising me, not reprimanding my poor decision making skills.”</p><p>“I rest my case.  If you didn’t waste your days frolicking through the forest looking for a clear figment of your stunningly active imagination, you’d have plenty of time to finish all of the work you need to at a proper hour.  Just because you’ve decided to hermit yourself out in the middle of nowhere like a crazed mountain man doesn’t mean your agent won’t still kick your arse for missing your deadlines.”</p><p>“My agent is a git, anyhow,” he announced, grinning when it caused the other man to growl in response.  It was perhaps his favorite jab, seeing as how James was the one who begged to be his sodding agent, in the first place.  “He sets all of these ridiculous deadlines when he knows very well I work better without constraints.  The prat.”</p><p>“I only do that because <em>you</em> can’t be bothered to-“ James’ voice crackled as the line was riddled with static.  When it finally cleared, his tone had gone from irritation to mild panic.  “No, no, Harry.  Give it back to daddy, please.  Harry!  Stop!  No, don’t throw daddy’s ce-“</p><p>The call ended abruptly. </p><p>Sirius set the phone back on the table and rose to his feet, stretching arms high above his head and twisting his spine until it gave a satisfying pop.  Shuffling over to the fridge, he pulled out some milk, deciding on a quick bowl of cereal to kick-start the morning.  After all, breakfast was said to be the most important meal of the day.</p><p>With his stomach happily filled with both caffeine and nourishment, and his hair pulled back into a messy ponytail to keep it out of his eyes, he grabbed his bag of necessary provisions, slipped on his boots in the entry, and left the house. </p><p>The stream that bordered one edge of his property line sat a stone’s throw away from the front door, surrounded on both sides by a thick smattering of tall trees.  That was the place he’d first seen his mystery man, now four days and twenty-two hours long past.  Not that he’d been ardently counting or anything.</p><p>It was a safe assumption to make that following the bank either direction might bring him back into contact with said beautiful stranger, slim though the chance might have been.  After all, the forest branched out for thousands of acres all around his small plot of land.  Campers and hikers, even hunters, were commonplace in those parts.  Despite that, he was still determined to try.</p><p>The weather was mild as he trekked to the edge of the burn, gazing out into the cold, dark water, careful not to get too close to the drop-off.  The stream itself was probably a good meter below where the ground suddenly inclined into a deep ravine, and though it was the beginning of June and thus the warmest time of year they saw, slipping and falling in was perhaps the least pleasant thing he could think of doing right then.  Short of being chased starkers through the woods by a swarm of angry bees.</p><p>Trickles of wind danced their way across the trees on the opposite shore, the slight breeze rustling leaves as the branches swayed in tandem.  Sunlight peeked small shafts of light through their gaps and openings, fiery rays splayed out, igniting everything that they touched.  It was captivating to behold, the picturesque scene reminiscent of one from a fairy tale in a children’s book. </p><p>A red squirrel broke the fragile serenity when it bounded through the foliage and scampered up the side of a large aspen, disappearing into the safety of its branches.  Seconds later, a golden eagle swooped down with a sharp cry, snatching up a harvest mouse in its talons and flying off with its prize.</p><p>Sirius followed the water downstream along the high bank at a leisurely pace, grey eyes scanning the surrounding area for signs of human life.  At one point, he broke through a dense cluster of bushes and startled an entire mob of roe deer grazing in a clearing.  A few let out sharp barks of surprise as he pressed himself precariously close to the edge of the ravine to avoid being trampled on while they scattered every which way, some even leaping across the three and a half meter gap to the other side with enviable grace.</p><p>He stopped for a rest now and then to catch his breath, leaning back against the trunks of trees to guzzle icy sips from his canteen and watch the stream slowly trickle past.  The occasional bird flitted by, but otherwise, the afternoon was woefully uneventful.  Another quiet summer day in the middle of the forest, with nothing and no one around for kilometers, save for the wildlife and various rare species of fern.</p><p>Perhaps Prongs was right and he was just wasting his time chasing around figments.  Merlin knows he had better things to do than traverse the same small patches of wood up and down for hours on end in a futile attempt to chance another run-in with a bloke he’d only seen once in his life.  And for a few seconds, at that.  If his mate were around, he’d tell him to stop acting like a lovesick twat and go finish his manuscript before he fell even further behind schedule.</p><p>Just as he made to give up and go home, a lilt of quiet laughter floated in from around the bend.  It might have been wishful thinking on his part, but he followed it to its source, peering around a grove of juniper trees and beaming when his hunch proved accurate.</p><p>A ray of sunlight broke through the canopy and shone down on the man from behind, highlighting his tawny curls like a halo around his head.  He was sitting at the bottom of the hill on a slight plateau above the water, dangling bare feet over the edge into the gentle current.  Dark lashes fluttered low over his eyes as he swept them back and forth, flipping through the pages of a well-worn paperback and laughing quietly under his breath.</p><p>Sirius couldn’t help but be entranced as he shuffled closer, torn between wanting to call out and break the silence or bask in the ethereal sensation a bit longer.  As luck would have it, he didn’t have to decide, the crunch of a branch beneath his booted foot snapping the amber gaze straight up with a jolt of surprise.</p><p>Something odd flickered across the man's handsome features, hardening them into a look of pure contempt.</p><p>“Sorry,” Sirius mumbled, stumbling out from the obstruction of foliage with a sheepish quirk of the mouth.  “I didn’t mean to interrupt your concentration.”</p><p>“I was about done, anyhow,” the other replied tersely in a rolling Welsh accent, retrieving a bookmark from the grass and placing it delicately between the pages. </p><p>He gathered up the rest of his things into a bag and made to rise to his feet but Sirius stopped him before he could so much as move his legs.  “What were you reading,” he blurted out, gesturing toward the novel in question still sat in his lap.  “If you don’t mind my asking.”</p><p>A beat of silence passed where it appeared he was highly considering the pros and cons of responding.  Something in his tone of desperation must have won out, in the end, because the man’s lips pursed in irritation but he huffed out a quiet “A Moveable Feast,” and made no other move to leave.</p><p>Sirius grinned in relief.  “Hemingway.  A classic.  I’m partial to The Sun Also Rises, myself.  Little bit older, but still a good read.”</p><p>“Ah.”</p><p>“Isn’t that cold,” he asked, taking a step closer.  “The water, I mean.  I know it’s like nineteen out right now, but you couldn’t pay me to-“</p><p>The next thing he knew, he was plunging headfirst into the stream. </p><p>It wasn’t too deep, about waist height, so when he was finally able to, he stood up, breaking through the surface with a splutter and coughing the ice from his lungs.  His return was greeted with the sound of raucous laughter, blinking owlishly over at the other man who was already on his feet, watching the whole spectacle with a sparkle in his amber eyes.</p><p>“I don’t know, you tell me,” he murmured, pulling the skin of his lower lip between his teeth to stop it from blooming outward into a giant smile.  The corners of his mouth still sat quirked on either end, giving him a sort of coy expression that did terrible things to Sirius’ heart.</p><p>“S’alright,” he breathed, pushing the hair back from his eyes.  The fall must have claimed the tie, because most of it now clung to his cheeks and throat, dripping trails of freezing water down his burning flesh.  “Not something I’d do again, I think.”</p><p>“Enjoy the rest of your swim,” the man told him with a wicked smirk, turning on his heel and waltzing into the forest without so much as a second glance.  He hadn’t even bothered to bring along a pair of shoes, so his bare feet were covered in grass and leaves by the time he finally disappeared from sight.</p><p>Sirius stood there in the frigid cold for a moment longer, shell-shocked and shivering, trying his best to produce coherent thought. </p><p>Despite the fact he’d made a complete arse of himself in front of the single most beautiful person he’d ever seen in his entire life, he couldn’t be bothered to care.  Not when the sound of melodic laughter still played on repeat in the back of his mind, turning his knees wobbly like a newborn fawn.</p><p>It didn’t even matter that it was at his own misfortune, it was still reserved just for him.  As he gazed dreamily at the last place the man had been, an idiotic grin splitting his face, the only thing he could possibly think about now was finding him again.  This time, he’d get the conversation to last more than just a few quick sentences.  After all, he hadn’t even remembered to ask for a name.</p>
