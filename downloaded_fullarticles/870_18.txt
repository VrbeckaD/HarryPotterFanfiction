  <span>It had been an enjoyable Christmas work party —festive music, mulled wine, ridiculously tiny appetizers— until Jordan from IT had interrupted Harry and Ron’s conversation.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey fellas, you know Draco from Accounting?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ron choked on his drink. Harry nearly dropped his.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Jordan, mate,” Ron said. “Did you just get chills too? Let’s go find a heater.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco cleared his throat. “Harry.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Draco.” Harry was running low on small talk. “You look well.” He hadn’t meant to say that.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I- Thanks, so do you.” Draco was blushing and trying hard to hide it. Harry remembered how he used to do that. He’d witnessed it for three years.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“When did you start working here?” Harry asked, wondering how he’d missed his ex walking around.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A couple of weeks,” Draco said and took a large swig of wine before adding, “Had to find something else after Astoria’s dad fired me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh. So you’re…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Divorced.” Draco winced. “At twenty-five.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And what about the baby?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco’s face lit up. “Scorpius? He’s almost two now, giving both me and Astoria cheek and sass whenever he can. We’re co-parenting, and we’re still really good friends, luckily.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m glad,” Harry said. “Always better when things end friendly.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He hadn’t meant it as a jab, but the look on Draco’s face ensured him it landed just the same. “I’m sorry, that was-”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s fine,” Draco said. “I was an idiot for leaving you the way I did.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“True,” Harry laughed. “Still, I understand the situation. It took me a while, but I got over it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco nodded solemnly. “I understand. I’ll uh… Leave you to it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Where are you spending Christmas, Draco?”</span>
