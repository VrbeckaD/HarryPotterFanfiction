    <p align="left">Â </p><p align="left"><b><u></u></b>It was the last day of October, a cold cloudy night. The children were finally in bed after a long day running through London. It was silent in Wool's Orphanage, which was something that didn't happen often. Mrs Cole, a skinny and sharp-featured woman, was walking towards the entrance because she had just finished looking after the children that weren't even a year old. After an exhausting day, She just wanted to go home as soon as possible when she heard a knock on the door. Why would somebody go to the Orphanage to ask for candy? She didn't like the concept of this tradition anyway and it was soon to be midnight, so who would go out this late? It took her a while to get to the door.<br/> "Isn't it a little late..." she stopped talking when she realised nobody was on the door. But looking down, she noticed a box filled with blankets and some blue eyes staring directly into hers.<br/> This wasn't something unusual, it actually happened quite often at Wool's Orphanage but all the other children had cried when they were found. Mrs Cole took the box and noticed a piece of paper which said<br/> "Chara<br/> Born: 2rd May 1927"<br/> Looking back at the child, she wondered why someone would want to get rid of such a beautiful baby. The little girl didn't seem difficult to handle either, a stranger had just picked her up but she still wasn't crying. Mrs Cole was always interested in the reasons why parents would leave their child behind but they never found out.<br/> After informing the Matron about the new arrival, Mrs Cole went upstairs with the child that still wasn't making any noise, to put her down with the other young children. There were only a few cribs left and she decided to put Chara next to the only child that also never seemed to cry. Tom Riddle. He was born here in the orphanage and Mrs Cole had helped. It was one of her worst memories, Tom's mother died after birth and Mrs Cole still thought of her pale face sometimes.<br/> Now that her shift was truly over, Mrs Cole finally stepped out of the door into the cold foggy night and noticed that it was extremely dark outside, she looked up to see the moon but there were too many clouds.<br/> She may be very exhausted because of the children but she really enjoyed working at Wool's Orphanage.</p>
