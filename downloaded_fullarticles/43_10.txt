    <p>May 1979</p>
<p>Had it been up to Remus, he wouldn't have chosen to spend his evening in a bar like this. In all honesty he wouldn't have chosen to spend his evening at a bar at all. The loud, crowded room made him itch to get away. He knew logically that there were no Death Eaters there, but the fear still crawled up the back of his neck and sunk its teeth into him. It was ever present.</p>
<p>He knew he was being ungrateful. How often did he get to spend time with his dearest friends anymore? And here they all were, sitting at a booth in a musty bar. Not the ideal place, maybe, but definitely the ideal people. James had one hand draped on his wife's shoulder and the other clutching a beer. Lily sipped gingerly on her gin and tonic, she had vowed to slow down on them earlier in the night but the straw had seldom left her lips. Sirius was telling them an elaborate story from the last time he had been in a bar and he watched as a fight broke out. Remus wondered idly if Sirius had been in the fight and was trying to keep Lily and himself from scolding him by hiding his involvement. Peter was squished next to Remus laughing drunkenly at Sirius' retelling. While Sirius was a good storyteller, Remus wasn't sure he was being particularly funny at that moment but Peter had been bought a birthday rum and coke by each of his friends and then bought another few for himself. He would probably have trouble remembering the story in the morning.</p>
<p>Remus stared into his scotch glass, trying to keep his mind on his friends in front of him and not the friends they had lost, not the possibility that there could be Death Eaters in the bar waiting to strike. Lily reached across the table and put her hand on top of his.</p>
<p>"Are you alright Remus?" She asked.</p>
<p>"Peachy." He gave her a tight lipped smile. Lily remained unconvinced, but didn't push it further.</p>
<p>"We're okay here, Moony." James jumped in, tearing his eyes away from Sirius to see what his wife had been worried about. "It's a shitty, college bar. The only trouble we are going to find here is trouble that we want to get into." James laughed, winking at Remus which caused Remus to chuckle slightly. It felt comforting to have his friend know what was on his mind and be able to remind him that he was safe.</p>
<p>"And what kind of trouble is that, dear husband of mine?" Lily questioned with raised brows, resting her head on her chin.</p>
<p>"Oh, you know," James gestured vaguely, "lady trouble. But them, not me obviously."</p>
<p>"Obviously." Lily repeated with a laugh, taking another sip from her drink and kissing James on the cheek swiftly. "Anyone here catching your eye?" Lily asked Remus, scanning the crowded bar.</p>
<p>"Oi, it's my birthday!" Peter let out. "I should be the one trying to find a girl."</p>
<p>"By all means, Wormy, go and find one." Sirius barked in a laugh. "No one is stopping you."</p>
<p>"What about you Sirius, are you going to try to find another girl?" Lily asked accusingly, still hurt on behalf of her friend, Marlene, who Sirius had consistently blown off in favor of one night stands.</p>
<p>"Look, you're my best mate's wife, so I'm going to let the constant reminders of my mistakes with Marlene go as a favor to him. But I need to tell you that she isn't exactly a walk in the park to be with." Sirius defended, taking a long drink from his gimlet.</p>
<p>"You're 'best mate's wife'?" Lily repeated in shock. "That's all I am to you?"</p>
<p>"You're a gem, Lil, I swear it, but I've let a lot of your big headedness slide because of the love James has for you." Sirius countered laughingly, finding immense amusement in the reddening face of Lily. James sat awkwardly in between the two of them as he was wont to do.</p>
<p>"Big headedness?!" Lily bellowed, knocking her glass slightly with her emphatic hands and spilling the liquid on the table. "You're one to talk about big headed, you pompous-"</p>
<p>"I'm going to get a drink." Remus announced as Lily and Sirius went at it in a half-joking, half-serious manner in the background.</p>
<p>He stood at the bar for a few minutes, waiting for the bartender to notice him so he could get another scotch. He had been trying desperately to mind his own business despite the hustle and bustle around him when a short, curly topped head popped up next to him.</p>
<p>"What's your drink?" She asked excitedly. Her eyes were slightly glassy and her skin shone with sweat. Her button nose was a bit pink on the end and her full lips stretched into a smile. Her hair was an absolute mop on the top of her head, it appeared as though she had attempted to pull it back but the brown curls were hell bent on doing whatever they wanted.</p>
<p>"Why do you ask?" Remus countered quietly, she let out a drunken giggle. She was using the bar for support to stand and her blue eyes were drooping slightly from fatigue. He could tell from the sight of her that it had been a long night.</p>
<p>"I'm going to buy you a drink." She retorted with a smile.</p>
<p>"Shouldn't I be buying you a drink?" Remus asked with a raised brow. The woman in front of him got a playful look in her eyes and leaned into him slightly.</p>
<p>"I'm very progressive." She laughed. Remus couldn't help but laugh along as well, not because she was particularly funny, but her laugh was infectious, it went on like bells tinkling softly in the wind. "You have to tell me." She said through breaths. "Or else I'm going to order for you, it won't be what you want, but you'll have to drink it anyway to be polite."</p>
<p>"Is that how this works?" Remus chuckled. She nodded rapidly and he out a small: "Oh, okay."</p>
<p>"You've a nice smile." She said suddenly, raising her hand and putting it on his shoulder. Remus knew she was very drunk, but the compliment still squeezed his heart slightly.</p>
<p>"Are you trying to flatter me?" Remus tried to joke, but his voice was nervous. He didn't know why this beautiful woman had chosen him to talk to, and flirt with at the bar. He knew if she had seen Sirius and not him, he would be left in the dust. "I'll have a scotch." He finally conceded.</p>
<p>"A simple drink." She noted, raising a hand to wave the bartender over.</p>
<p>"For a simple man."</p>
<p>"I like men to be uncomplicated." She shot back at him, giving him a grin that Remus would have been willing to pay a million galleons to see. His heart was beating wildly both in awe of her and in shame of himself. He had to get away, he knew he wasn't good enough, he knew he was dangerous and bad and he needed to be far from this woman who didn't know what he could be.</p>
<p>The bartender handed her two glasses and she left some money on the bar. She turned around and leaned her back against the alcohol covered wood and put the small, plastic straw between her lips. "What's your name?"</p>
<p>"Remus,"</p>
<p>Her eyebrows shot up. "Remus? You don't meet many of those any more."</p>
<p>"Was there ever an overabundance of Remus'?" Remus laughed, sipping his drink. "What's your name?</p>
<p>"Eleanor." She responded, a smile never leaving her lips. "But I really prefer Nora."</p>
<p>"Nora." Remus played with the name on his lips, unknowingly leaning closer to her. The alcohol and her smile mixing together to make him forget, even if just for a moment, who he was and all that was wrong with him.</p>
<p>It was a brief moment, where he was just a man and she was just a woman - a progressive woman, who bought him a drink and thought he had a nice smile - and their eyes were saying all of the words their mouths couldn't, and they were drunk and smiling at each other. There was no war. His friends weren't dying or being hunted. He wasn't worried about what stage the moon was in. She didn't know about any of that. She had just chosen him because something drew her to him and for just a moment, he didn't care whether or not her being drawn to him was because she didn't know anything about him. He only cared that she was here.</p>
<p>"This band is shit." She finally muttered, after the two had been staring at each other for an unnecessarily long amount of time. Remus hadn't really noticed the band yet, but now that he was listening, it really was a shitty band. "But I think we should go dance anyway."</p>
<p>And despite all of the emotions that had been rushing through Remus moments earlier, that offer brought him back. There was nothing he could pursue with this girl. He would only hurt her and put her in danger. He could provide her with nothing. He needed to get away from her lest he dig himself deeper into a pit of guilt. "I really should get back to my friends." Remus puffed out, knowing he was doing the right thing, but disappointed to leave this magnetic woman.</p>
<p>"I get it." Nora nodded once. "It was nice to meet you, Remus."</p>
<p>"It's not because of you, please know that." Remus scrambled, he didn't want her to feel rejected. "I want to, but it's my friend's birthday and he'll be mad if I get to dance with a beautiful girl while he sits in the booth all alone." He was trying desperately not to hurt her feelings. He could never explain to her the depth of the danger he put her in, so he hoped this excuse would be enough. Nora smiled a little at him, seeming to halfway believe him.</p>
<p>"Well once you set him up with someone, come find me." She instructed, giving his free hand a squeeze and disappearing into the crowd as quickly as she came. Remus felt his body go lax the moment she left, she had filled him with something he'd never felt before. Maybe a sense of confidence? He couldn't tell. He could almost swagger back to the table in a frighteningly Sirius-type manner after meeting Nora. He tried to shake her from his memory by downing the scotch and buying himself another so that he wouldn't have to nurse the drink she had bought him and he could just move on.</p>
<p>Once he reached the table again, he noted Lily and James' absence, and the arrival of two young, very pretty ladies. He sat next to Sirius who had a short blonde tucked beneath his arm while Peter was comparing the size of his hands with a girl who had her jet pulled back by a red headband.</p>
<p>"Oh, Remus!" Sirius greeted, sliding over to offer his friend some room. "I was wondering where you ran off to. This is Penelope and Deborah." He introduced. "This one's trying to convince me to join in the dancing, but the band is shit." Sirius laughed, pointing to blonde who Remus wasn't sure was Penelope or Deborah. Remus laughed lightly at his friend's comment of the band.</p>
<p>"Where did Lily and James run off to?" Remus questioned.</p>
<p>"Well Lily loves shitty music, so they're dancing." Sirius responded.</p>
<p>"Oh come on now Sirius, you know it was James who suggested dancing."</p>
<p>"Alright, the man loves his wife I suppose. Love makes you like weird, rock, love bands I guess." Sirius finished his drink and looked at the girl next to him. "I suppose we can go dance, love, come on." They stood from the booth and as they passed, Sirius put a hand on his friend's shoulder. "Gotta keep the women folk happy." He laughed quietly, obviously very giddy to be getting a dance with this girl. Remus' eyes returned to the booth so he could have a seat and was met with Peter and the girl with the headband kissing very passionately and rather sloppily.</p>
<p>So here he was now, alone. He heaved a sigh and went to stand at the bar once more, hoping that being closer to the alcohol would cut down on his wait time between glasses. He sat at a stool and sipped quietly to himself. It didn't take long for the stool next to him to become occupied. He glanced next to him and saw Nora, her eyes now looking a little red and swollen, but a smile still plastered on her face.</p>
<p>"I promise I wasn't trying to avoid you. It seemed the birthday boy found someone. Well everyone in my party did, except for James I guess, but he came here married so I don't think that counts." He was drunkenly rambling now and Nora put a gentle hand on his arm to stop him.</p>
<p>"It's okay." She laughed. "I believe you." She took a cigarette out of her purse and lit it at the bar, taking a long drag from it. "I had a few things to deal with anyway."</p>
<p>"'Deal with'?" Remus asked with a chuckle. "Should I be scared?"</p>
<p>"Very," Nora nodded, brushing away the curls that were falling in her eyes. "I'm a dangerous woman."</p>
<p>"You know, I'm inclined to believe you." Remus sucked in a breath. The alcohol was hitting him hard and he was exhausting himself by focusing so hard on not looking and speaking like a fool. "I'm sorry I didn't try to find you, but dancing is just not my thing."</p>
<p>"Nah, mine either." Nora waved off. "I just wanted to suggest something because I didn't want to stop spending time with you."</p>
<p>"And just talking was out of the question?" Remus asked.</p>
<p>"I don't know, men are thick sometimes and I wanted to make a move so you would know I was interested." She said bluntly. "But I guess sometimes you just need to say it."</p>
<p>"Well...I…" Remus struggled to find words.</p>
<p>"I think you should probably run far away. I just ended this weird thing with this guy I was sleeping with and I basically ruin everything I touch. So if I were you, I'd get the hell out of here." She shook her head and laughed. "Sorry, I'm already a pretty up front person but the alcohol and loneliness doesn't help."</p>
<p>Perhaps, Remus thought to himself, if she really was just looking for some attention without commitment then maybe he could allow for a connection between the two of them. Just for the night, he could stick around. All of his friends were coupled off, and if he was never going to see her again, there really was no harm done. She would sober up eventually and realize she'd made a mistake by talking to him, and if they only talk then that wouldn't be taking advantage of her lack of sobriety.</p>
<p>"What do you do?" Remus asked.</p>
<p>"I'm a student. Studying English. I want to be in publishing, and discover the next great author and all of the cliche shit." She answered.</p>
<p>"Do you write your own stuff?"</p>
<p>"I'll write a poem here or there, but I'm not one of the greats." She admitted.</p>
<p>"Write me a poem right now, on the spot." Remus requested, leaning in closer to her. His head spinning from the drinks and from her. The cigarette still burned in her hand, though she'd only touched it a time or two. The smoke circled around them, bringing them closer together within the cloud.</p>
<p>"Hmm," Nora furrowed her thick brows together, deep in thought as she looked deep into Remus' grey eyes. "The drinks are cold. The night is long. Should I tell this mysterious stranger about my thong?" She puffed out, causing Remus to begin laughing from deep in his belly. "Was that a good one?" She asked.</p>
<p>"Emily Dickinson would be very proud." Remus nodded through his laughter.</p>
<p>"What do you do?" She offered him her lit cigarette that was trailing ash on the bar now. Remus wasn't someone who smoked but he took it just so that he could brush his fingers against hers and put his mouth against it.</p>
<p>"Bit of non-profit work." He answered vaguely, unable to find a way to say that he worked for an underground wizard organization that fought to keep the evils of blood supremacy at bay.</p>
<p>"You know there is no sexier way to tell me you're unemployed than framing it as 'non-profit work'." Nora laughed, putting her hand on Remus' shoulder.</p>
<p>"Tell me another poem." Remus insisted.</p>
<p>Nora chewed on her lip for a moment. "Here we are surrounded by a cigarette fume, I wonder if there is a hot way to ask him to make out with me in the bathroom."</p>
<p>Remus' eyebrows shot up. He was silent for a long moment, thinking of all of the possible consequences that could happen if he indulged this. But Nora didn't want to wait for him to comb through each one, so she took his collar in her hand and practically dragged him to the women's bathroom, where she locked the door behind her and immediately jumped up onto the counter bringing Remus' lips to hers.</p>
<p>The two lost track of time in that bathroom, ignoring all of the bangs on the door and just drunkenly ravaging each other through giggles and gasps. Remus comforted himself knowing that in the morning, she would be back in her dorm, probably making up with that boy she had talked about earlier. He could enjoy her for a while, but she would never be a constant in his life. And he was going to be okay with that, even if kissing her felt like heaven on earth.</p>
<p>Eventually, Nora pulled away for a moment and sat very still. Remus' shirt was halfway unbuttoned, and his collar was extremely lopsided. Her hair had come out of the ponytail it was in and was flying a thousand different directions. Her jacket had been taken off and discarded on the floor while part of her black bra poked out of her half on tank top. She shot off the counter and lunged for the toilet, where she emptied the many, many drinks she had had that night. Remus held her hair and rubbed her back while she let everything go and then sat next to her once it seemed like she was done.</p>
<p>"That was not very sexy, was it?" She asked after flushing the toilet for the third time to make sure it was all really gone.</p>
<p>"Not really." Remus agreed with a laugh. "But everything else was."</p>
<p>"I need to go home." She sighed with regret. "This is my sign."</p>
<p>"Do you want me to walk you back?" Remus offered. Nora shook her head slowly.</p>
<p>"I'm gonna get a cab." She then got up and went to her purse, pulling out a pen. "But," she grabbed his hand and wrote down a number on it "call this number. It's my dorm building. Just ask for Nora and someone will come get me. I want to hear from you again."</p>
<p>*******</p>
<p>For weeks Remus had been dreaming about running into Nora again. Of course, he could have called her dorm like she had asked him to, but that was far too risky. He knew their time at the bar was a one time thing, and the longer he went without seeing her, the more he would forget her.</p>
<p>Besides, Sober Nora would realize that Remus wasn't worth her time, and that rejection was extremely difficult to face.</p>
<p>So he was left to simply dream until enough time had passed where he didn't remember her face anymore, and the dreaming became very difficult. It was taking longer than he had hoped to get her off of his mind, but it would happen eventually, he knew.</p>
<p>His solution was to take more missions with the Order. He loved his friends dearly, but Lily and James' love was nearly insufferable when he was trying to forget that he was alone. His current mission was a rather boring one, he was having a meeting with a correspondent at a local university on what to look out for in Death Eaters, and how to best protect the large number of students who were vulnerable to an attack.</p>
<p>The meeting was long, and Remus had to dodge around questions regarding the Magical World that had nothing to do with the safety of the students, but eventually it finally came to an end. He would be returning every day for the rest of the week to continue with training, and to observe and see if there was any suspicious activity already present on campus.</p>
<p>Remus should have seen it coming from a million miles away. He should have known, but he was still shocked when he saw Nora walking on the same path he was with a load of books in her hands and a bag over her shoulder. She was clad in a black t-shirt and yellow overalls. Her hair was haphazardly tied up in a yellow bandana, and before Remus could avert himself, she was walking right towards him determinedly. Pretend you don't remember her. Remus told himself, but, Merlin, she looks like sunshine.</p>
<p>"Oi," She called at him, her face set in disapproval, "You never called me."</p>
<p>"I-uhhh-erm," Remus scratched the back of his neck uncomfortably.</p>
<p>"I-I-I...bullshit." Nora mocked. "I met you in a damn bar, why did I think you were any different than the sleazy men I'd met before?" Nora huffed.</p>
<p>"I am different." Remus said without thinking, he then cleared his throat and shook his head at himself.</p>
<p>"I mean I guess it was just drunkenly snogging in a bathroom, but I don't know, I thought it was special." Nora bit the inside of her cheek and kicked a patch in the ground with her foot. "What are you doing here anyways?"</p>
<p>Remus chuckled slightly, realizing her blunt nature from the first time they met was not alcohol induced at all, that was her natural state.</p>
<p>"I have meetings with some of the faculty." Remus responded almost automatically. "Work stuff." Nora was silent for a moment, drumming her fingers on the books she was carrying.</p>
<p>"Okay, I'm sorry for attacking you like that. It's not been an awesome year for me dating wise and, I don't know, that was unfair of me to put it on you." Nora huffed quietly, Remus could have laughed at the begrudging way she gave her apology.</p>
<p>"I don't have a phone." Remus offered up, not sure where these words were coming from. He simply could not pursue anything with this woman, and yet here he was. He wanted to slap himself. He wanted Sirius to slap him. This was ridiculous. Unacceptable. But she was like sunshine, if sunshine were blunt and a good kisser.</p>
<p>Nora's features softened at his admittance and she smiled softly at him. She held out her books for him to hold as she dug in her bag for something. She handed him a little, white coin purse that jangled loudly. "Now you don't have an excuse." She grinned, taking her books back and ripping a corner out of a page in her book and writing her phone number in small font. "I've got to get to class, but I'm serious. Call me."</p>
<p>And she was gone in a moment, leaving Remus with a number, some change, and a smile.</p>
