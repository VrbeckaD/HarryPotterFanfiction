    <p>There were stars falling from the indigo sky. They paved away across the endless canvas of blue with their own streaks of oranges, whites and purples tailing behind them. And that's all they were meant to do. They were never supposed to touch our atmosphere. We were never supposed to exist too close to them. But, alas, one made it down. A sparkling blue lake surrounded by small houses in nowhere, England. It had reflected the whole cosmos, and of course, the falling, burning star.</p><p>
  <ins>Some mornings, the blonde boy woke up crying without knowing why. That sort of thing happened now and again.</ins>
</p><p>Now, a bright, bustling city. London. The heart of it, in fact. Tall towers, old churches, morning traffic, but no snow. It's the middle of summer, and the air is the kind of itchy warm that hugs your skin.</p><p>
  <em>And as for the other green-eyed one, he suffered the same. Whatever dream was that he had, he could never remember it.</em>
</p><p>Not a city. A room. It was cluttered, with fliers, and all sorts of stationary. His desk was even worse, covered in letters and books and late snacks he kept for himself, and sometimes for his owl. And though it was a sunny morning, the room was dark. It's blinds shut all the way, the green-eyed boy wanting to prolong the start of his day.</p><p>
  <ins>But… </ins>
</p><p>A smaller room, though much cleaner. The curtains were shut, but they still emitted a warm, pink light from it. The blonde boy welcomed it, even as he awoke from something so shakening. Works were stacked on shelves. Neat and organised. A wand lay near his bedside table, and a small, yellow diary sat next to it.</p><p>
  <em>But…</em>
</p><p>
  <ins>The only thing that did last when he woke up, was a sense of loss, which lingered for a long time afterwards.</ins>
</p><p>A train station. He's still in a daze. He got up, dressed, ate breakfast, left his apartment, and was on the scheduled train he was supposed to be on, but he still felt as if he were dreaming. The train was absolutely crowded, as it always was. The green eyed boy stared out the window of one train, looking out to the trains passing by his, the railroads, the town, the people. He wondered if anyone of them were part of wizardkind. Or maybe it was just him. Little did he know, the blonde boy was doing the exact same. They were looking… searching… </p><p>
  <em>For something or someone.</em>
</p><p>
  <ins>He was consumed by this feeling. Ever since that day…</ins>
</p><p>
  <em>The day…</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>A star fell.</strong>
</p><p>And there it was again. The falling star. Marked across the sky like a rebellious river. Five years ago. But yesterday as well. One boy was watching the star from the roof with his family. It passed right over him, as if to send him a message of importance. As if to remind him of something that hadn't happened yet. What could it be? What had he forgotten? Or who? </p><p>And the other one. He was renewed and his previous self at the same time. He was not with his family. He was by himself, at least, that's how he felt. But seeing that star inch it's way across the sky towards him, and only him, he felt as if everything else melted away. His tears had either dried or continued to fall. He couldn't tell. He wasn't sure of anything anymore.</p><p>So there you have it. They must've been special, the two of them. They had to be some way. Even if they do not remember it. Time was twisted for a reason. Fate was entangled for a purpose. Surely. But the story isn't spoiled yet. It hasn't even truly begun, either. And despite what you think, the peculiarities, the romances, the friendships, the story hangs on that star that's being described to you now. It was… </p><p>
  <em>It was almost like…</em>
</p><p>
  <ins>Like he was seeing something out of a dream.</ins>
</p><p>
  <em>Nothing more or less…</em>
</p><p>
  <ins>Then a breathtaking view.</ins>
