    <p> </p><p>“Alright Harry,” the stare of Luna’s light blue eyes traced with millions of silver freckles falls onto Harry absently. “Truth or dare?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>The trunks are pushed back to free some space, but it’s still incredibly crowded in the room. The air is not that stale due to the high ceilings, but it’s so hot that little droplets of sweat roll down the necks and temples. Neville refuses to let them open the window, because Mrs Augusta Longbottom says, September wind is the most dangerous of all: you won’t even register the moment fever hops onto you. Behind the window the dark sky is nothing but a steady velvet drape, and millions of diamond pecks are placed so haphazardly, so chaotically on it, you wouldn’t be surprised if it’d turn out a child once grabbed handful of these sparkling pieces and threw them down, bursting into bright laughter. But each and every has its own place and is so big you wouldn’t believe it, so solid and fierce, so cold and beautiful, so blatantly important, and so heartbreakingly empty. No cloud hides them now, no light disturbs the sacred meaning of the night.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>And yet, not even one person feels how small they actually are, too preoccupied with people, whose gazes are soft and dizzy from the consumed drinks and lips hurt from never ending smiles, in the room that’s dim from the last breaths of the fire, living the life they finally can afford. Finally.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Dare,” Harry says after a long second and licks his lips. His t-shirt sticks to his back and glasses are constantly sliding down his nose. He hopes Luna makes him go outside and feed some mysterious invisible friends of hers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>The corners of Luna’s lips curl up in the slightest and her eyes roll up slowly, probably breaking through the ceiling and taking her high above the Earth to consult with the stars.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Meanwhile, everyone in the room begins to shout and thoughtfully share their own bright idea of how to humiliate Harry this time.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Skinny dipping with the Giant Squid!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“A lap dance!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Go steal another bottle of Firewhiskey from Filch’s study!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Y’all are weak,” Parvati snorts and opens her mouth to add something, but then Luna starts speaking again.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Write and send a love letter to the first person you fell in love with.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Ginny’s right there, her side pressed up against his, the smell of her hair, of her warm freckled body swallowing Harry up. Her lips curl into a smirk as she shoots a curious Cheshire-esque glare in Cho’s direction, who’s cheeks are a little darker than usual, but her smile is a little self-satisfied, too. Lavender bites her lip, Ron, Seamus and Neville make a lovely imitation of a hyena pack.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Very funny, boys,” Hermione rolls her eyes and crosses her hands on her chest.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“This is going to be either teeth-rottingly cute or fucking embarrassing,” Neville shrieks, and then Ginny’s fingers are suddenly in Harry’s hair, her warm brown eyes trying to catch his gaze.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Oh Merlin, get a room!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Harry knows he’s under Veritaserum, so he couldn’t lie to himself as well, no matter how much he tries. Harry also knows it’s not going to be Ginny’s name on the letter.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>He finally looks up and meets Luna’s eyes, so light they remind him of The Moon’s reflection in two giant poodles. They’re cool and calm, and yet, the panic trying to rise up in his chest is put down with the surprising amount of sympathy in them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“You can do it somewhere else,” she says slowly, breaking the eye contact and opening her sixth or seventh bottle of Butterbeer.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Harry nods, mainly for himself, and finally turns to face Ginny. She’s wearing a little concerned frown, and Harry gives her a lopsided grin and a quick peck on the lips before standing up.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“He’s fucking plastered,” Dean snorts as Harry walks towards his bag to get a quill and a piece of parchment.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“So what if I am,” Harry asks over his shoulder without a question in his voice.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>He’s followed with series of giggles and honest to god barks, and when Harry closes the door and hides himself under the Cloak, the smile immediately falls from his face, but inside, his soul doesn’t nag anymore. He breathes out with an ease and then takes a deep breath, savouring the much cooler air of the Hogwarts’ corridors.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>When Harry gets out of the building, he already feels small. He suddenly wonders if the sky would swallow him up and leave nothing in return, no one to face the blushing rise of the next day. It’s not black anymore, like it looked from the tower. It’s so deeply blue Harry feels he could drown.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>The softest autumn breeze smells like slowly rotting leaves and warm earth, and Harry lets it kiss away the heat on his cheeks and neck. The grass tickles his ankles, his head is dizzy, and every single tree sounds different under the gentle touches of the wind.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>The boy sits by the lake, where the strong smell of water and seaweed approaches the forest symphony. Millions of grey licks of waves wink at him from the surface of the Lake, although now <em>it</em> is one to be black. So black Harry could reach down to its waters and never wash away the stains on his skin. So back Harry could use it to write the letter. So black Harry could drown himself in it, and his sorrow and guilt would dissolve completely.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> <b>Dear Draco,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b> </em>
</p><p>
  <em> <b> </b> </em>
</p><p>
  <em> <b>they gave me Veritaserum, so I can’t make myself believe you weren’t the first one. That you weren’t one at all.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b> </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <b>Fuck. Shit.</b>
</p><p> </p><p>Harry rubs his eyes with his thumb and index finger. Takes a few deep breaths. Tries to sober up a little. The letters are wobbly and the flow of his words is even worse. He’s not in the right condition to <em>write</em>, let alone starting all over again and again.</p><p> </p><p>
  <b>This is not the best way to start a love letter.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b>
</p><p>
  <b> </b>
</p><p>
  <b>Fucking mother fuck.</b>
</p><p> </p><p>He groans. Maybe it’s the wind, but something in the Lake groans too. Harry shivers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>
  <b>I was dared to write and send a letter to the first person I fell in love with. The person I’m currently in a relationship with was sitting next to me, and she probably still thinks I’m writing to her. The point is, I would’ve been, if I were 1 — sober; 2 — smart; 3 — a dirty rotten liar. But I’m drunk and stupid and under Veritaserum, so I can’t write to anyone but you.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b>
</p><p>
  <b> </b>
</p><p>
  <b>I’m sitting by the Lake right now, because I remember how often I saw you here, alone.</b>
</p><p> </p><p>Not sneering. Not smirking or teasing. Long legs stretched, ankles crossed, pale fingers holding a quill. A little crease in between eyebrows. In the end, he was the second-best student, he studied a lot. And staring at him while he was concentrated and focused was sometimes better than bickering...and fighting.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>
  <b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>And how awful many times I saw the shade of your eyes in the mirror of its waters. I’ve never been the one to see your eyes up close often, but there were few times.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b>
</p><p>
  <b> </b>
</p><p>
  <b>And now you’re not here at all.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b>
</p><p>
  <b> </b>
</p><p>
  <b>I was mad at first when I learned you transferred to Beauxbatons after the war. Then I changed my mind because I had to move on. It’s a good thing. Loving you was not.</b>
</p><p> </p><p>Stupid, desperate and hopeless. Illogical, even. Fucking ridiculous.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>
  <b>I hope you’re happy there.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b>
</p><p>
  <b> </b>
</p><p>
  <b>Oh fuck.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b>
</p><p>
  <b> </b>
</p><p>
  <b>You have no idea how many times I’ve tried to remind myself<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>that you were a terrible person, the one that didn’t deserve to live, to love and to be loved, but I couldn’t. Again, I’m not a dirty rotten liar. And now I wish you happiness.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <b>You did terrible things, but you had no choice. He would end your family. You loved, and that was what you did all those things in honour of. I don’t care if you think otherwise, if you hate yourself, if you think you don’t deserve anything good as well. I don’t care if you don’t feel guilty at all too. I don’t.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b>
</p><p>
  <b> </b>
</p><p>
  <b>But I’ll let you know, even a year ago, I couldn’t make myself hate you. I mean, sometimes hated you a little because you were a git, because you acted like a complete wanker and made people feel bad for things they couldn’t change, etcetera, but. . .no. I could never hate you. Those things are not enough to hate.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <b>In the end, why do I know I loved you?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b>
</p><p>
  <b> </b>
</p><p>
  <b>You were always in my head, but never in colours that don’t exist. I have proofs now, you’re not a bad person. I can’t write what exactly made me develop those feelings towards you (sometimes I don’t think I know either), I don’t really want to reveal myself, in the end, my dare is to write to my <u>first</u> love, not to my <u>current</u> one; but you can trust my Veritaserum-poisoned self, I loved you.</b>
</p><p> </p><p>Harry stops writing again and lets himself fall back onto the cool ground, grabbing fistful of grass. His eyes are wide open, his chest rises and falls like he’s been playing Quidditch for four hours.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Not even one star moves, but it feels like they’re breathing. Harry wonders what would they smell like. Probably they don’t, they’re stones after all. But he doesn’t want to agree on that.</p><p> </p><p>
  <b>This is probably the worst letter you’ve ever received. I know it doesn’t make sense, and to say it’s ill-structured would mean to say nothing at all. But I can’t write anyhow else. I can’t write as freely as I’d want to—</b>
</p><p> </p><p>The boy pauses and bites his lip. Yeah. Right. He can’t lie. He’d like to write a proper love letter. To celebrate the first person who broke his heart. He decides to not cross the sentence to avoid spreading more dirt.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>
  <b>but it’s still something.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b>
</p><p>
  <b> </b>
</p><p>
  <b>I hope you’re doing well. I hope you’re doing great and that you’ll never have to come back to face people that don’t know shit. I hope you don’t have nightmares but I know you do. I hope it’ll be better soon.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b>
</p><p>
  <b> </b>
</p><p>
  <b>I hope I never see you again.</b>
</p><p>
  <b> </b>
</p><p>
  <b>Best wishes,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b>
</p><p> </p><p>Harry hesitates. He can’t write a wrong name. He can’t leave it like that. Writing something like “Anonymous” feel stupid.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Harry. Harry James Potter. James. Jamie. Jem. </p><p> </p><p><b>Gem</b> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>The ceiling is too far from being as beautiful as the night sky that he stared at for thirty more minutes before sending the letter, but Harry still can’t look away. It’s comforting after a round of nightly nightmares, leaving him all panting and breathless on sweaty covers of his bed. He doesn’t need to think much to remember who he’s just dreamt of.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Those thirty minutes were a mistake. He should’ve frozen his ass out and gone inside, immediately. He should’ve come back, gotten rid of the letter, tugged Ginny close and been lulled into sleep, surrounded by people he treasures the most.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Instead, Harry let his mind take him back to places he’s long forgotten. He let the night touch the secret chords he wished to forget.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>It’s true, he hates thinking about his stupid crush. His obsession with Malfoy had never supposed to be what it was. An obsession with a vain, self-centered, cruel pure-blood. The Boy Who Lived and a Death Eater’s son. Later a Death Eater himself.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>But even though Harry knows Malfoy took the mark, a part of his heart always refuses to call him a Death Eater. He was forced into this, and Harry should have thought better two years ago, he should’ve known this, he should’ve done something. Tell Dumbledore, tell anyone, stop this fuckery. He was a <em>child</em>. Harry’s stupid Hero complex and yet he’s never made any effort to save the person he admired so much. Harry knows for sure he shouldn’t feel sorry, it’s fucking ridiculous. Still.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>As if he’s ever been good with telling his heart what to do.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>The white light of the morning is dull, and it feels odd after the clearance of the night. It’s probably an aluminum-grey day, with watercolour smears of clouds above endless forests, but there’s a lot to admire in this particular kind of a day too. Especially in September, when all the leaves make a serious competition to Shishkin’s palette, thousands, millions of shades of brown, yellow, green and red. Under the sky of perfect baby blue they’re soft and almost creamy, under the bright blue of a sunny day they’re almost blinding in their retrospective; and this metal grey sky makes its own gloomy, stoic, yet melodramatically poetic charm when you look at the never-ending pano from the Gryffindor tower. It’s a much common view in October than mid-September, but some days are an exception.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>This day won’t be an exception in any other way. He’ll come down to the Great Hall, have a breakfast, kiss Ginny on her adorably chapped pink lips, lie in her lap in the Common Room, write his Potions essay, play chess with Ron or a game of poker with Seamus. Or maybe a couple of games.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>He suddenly feels sick to the guts. He often does, these days. He’s so fucking tired. Inside, there’s that lingering feeling of a trap. He’s like a tensed string, frantically waiting for a catch, ready to snap at every second, with every fiber of his being. It makes him weaker. More paranoid. It’s exhausting. He wants to have a rest.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>The Mind Healer he used to visit quite often in summer said it was okay. But now he doesn’t have his Mind Healer, she said he was ready; she said he was better. He doesn’t need to save the world any more. It’s time to focus on himself.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>He should focus on himself. He should make this day decent. He should keep fighting his apathy, caused by the constant tension inside. Quite a paradox.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>But it’s Sunday. He Accios a glass, fills it up with Aguamenti, swallows the water quickly and falls asleep again.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>“Mate? Mate, you okay?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>There’s a cool hand on his ankle, and Harry swears into his pillow, pulling his knee up to his chest.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Ron snorts.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“ ‘m fine, just sleeping,” Harry mutters, though it’s not entirely true. He’s woken up two times already, and this was just a nap that wouldn’t last long either.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Is five in the evening.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“And?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Dunno,” Harry can see him shrugging awkwardly. “Thought you were hungry. Gin’s worried.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Why?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“She uh,” Ron probably twitches uncomfortably. “She—“<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Didn’t get the letter?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Nothing but silence follows Harry’s bitterness.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Anyway, thanks for checking up on me,  I’m coming.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Ron exhales, and there is an unmistakable gratitude in the sound. Harry feels sorry for him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>***<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>The thought of getting an answer strikes Harry when he’s shoving the second piece of treacle tart into his mouth. The boy just frowns a little, still chewing, and then relaxes, because come on. The letter was atrocious. Draco will probably read it with an honest to god pitiful expression on his face, wondering what kind of “a fucking imbecile” would call it a love letter, and throw it away.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Not like Harry gives a shit.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“There you are.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>A faint sound of flowing fabric, a wave of citrusy shampoo and sweet late spring flowers blossom perfume, a radiating ginger silhouette — and Ginny’s right next to him, brown eyes still concerned, just like they were the last time Harry met them with his own.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Ginny’s comfort, Ginny’s peace, Ginny’s blissful safety of passive existence Harry’s trying to reach. Ginny reminds him of his mother. Of Molly, too. How many nights passed next to her, how many breaths stolen from her, how many heartbeats Harry counted while his head lied on her chest. It was good, having Ginny by his side. Good. Nice. Fine.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Harry lets a smile touch his sugary glistening mouth.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Hi, Ginny.”</p><p> </p><p>The smile grows sillier and wider when he sees her overcoming her own thoughts and finally giving in. She sighs and shakes her head a little, warm fingers cup either side of Harry’s face, and then her lips cover his. The bows inside Harry’s stomach don’t relax, his shoulders are still tensed, no white noise in his head; it’s clear, and right now he feels Ginny Weasley with every fiber of his being.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>On Monday and Tuesday Harry looks through the window and sees how beautiful autumn’s last breaths are. Grass greener and greener under the beaming sun, but with a different green, not May-fresh or June-popping. It’s a kind of green you can find pressed in between the sheets of your heaviest book. This exact hue is escorted with ochre-yellows, with tea-oranges, with crimson-reds, if you trace the trees with a quick glance. And no swirl of white up the endless blue of the sky.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Wednesday reminds him of Sunday, although the picture in Harry’s head was only a presumption. V-formations of birds tremble in the distance, and the sky is completely grey, like a worn-out, one thousand times washed white sheet.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I mean, I would totally bang him,” Lavender sighs dreamily at the sight of their new DADA teacher when they all are having breakfast in the Great Hall.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“No offense but you would bang anybody,” Seamus snorts, and the whole table follows. Ron’s mug is darker than the bowl of beet salad in front of him, which makes Hermione and Ginny laugh even harder.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“As if <em>you</em> don’t have your eyes for him,” Lavender strikes back and grins when red blush spreads over Seamus’ cheeks and he looks apologetically at Dean.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Honey, sugar, love of my life, you know she’s joking, right?” he mutters weakly, though Dean seems to have absolutely no problem with that.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“It’s okay love, I find him totally bangable too,” one more round of laughter follows after that.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>And when Harry’s eyes reach the familiar spot at the Slytherin table, now taken by some sixth grader he doesn’t know, it shows. His eyes turn into glass and his smile, still spread on his lips, looks as if it’s made of wax.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>After classes, when the air is cool and humid, and slowly begins to fall into softer shades of lilac, Harry, Ginny, Luna and Neville are making their way into the forest. Luna wants to find the bushes of blackcurrant, the tea of its leaves is her favourite. Harry falls behind her and Neville, taking his time and breathing deeply, head free of thoughts, and Ginny sticks to his slow wandering steps. Looking at the leaves from the ground is different. The darkening veins of trees form giant nests for trillions of creatures, their cries and whispers mixing with the symphony of wind and their steps.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Did you get an answer?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Ginny’s voice sounds out of place. Anyone’s would. With an exception of maybe Hagrid’s. Or Luna’s. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Huh?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Ginny clears her throat. Harry still doesn’t look at her, but not because of fear or reluctance. He’s too drowned in watching.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Your dare. Your love letter. Did you get an answer?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“No. I don’t think I will.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>They fall into cool silence after that, until Luna starts rambling excitedly somewhere near them. Harry picks up the blackcurrant leaves one by one and his fingers still smell like them when he’s falling asleep that night.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p> </p>
