<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em>A triage of spiraling red lights shot past her head, ruffling her unruly black hair. Azalea Potter spun around, a curse glowing at the tip of her wand, only to watch in shock as the spells hit three of the most important wizards in her life, pushing them back into and beyond the Veil of Death. Sirius Black was clinging to his wand, hand outstretched towards her. Remus Lupin was doubled over, gasping for breath, staring at her sadly through his tears. Severus Snape just looked resigned as he grabbed as he grabbed onto the two men and gazed at her pleadingly.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>"Look after them." It was simple, and spoken like an order, and with that, there were gone. Her godfather, her uncle, and her father figure (step-uncle, really, but still) were just gone. No bodies for her to take home and bury, nothing. With a shriek of pure rage and pain, causing dread to fill those who heard it, Azalea Jaime Potter turned back to the fray, casting various Severing Charms, uncaring of where on her targets they hit. </em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p>With a jolt, Azalea sat up in her desk chair, groaning softly and rubbing the sleep from her eyes. Glancing at the large grandfather clock bathed in the light of the dying fire and full moon, she noted it was nearing three in the morning, only to bit back another groan. <em>I hate the so-called Witching Hour,</em> she thought bitterly, heart heavy as she gazed at an old photograph on her desk, depicting Severus Snape and his wife, her Aunt Petunia, Dudley, herself, Sirius Black, and Remus Lupin on her fifteenth birthday. It had been a blistering hot summer, and all of them were sporting both a tan and a sunburn. In front of her was a letter from her best friend, Hermione Granger, who had been doing research since the skirmish that had cost her the three wizards, fifteen years ago. A particular paragraph kept jumping out at her.</p>
<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em>The Veil of Death is not, much as the name suggests, instant death. It’s a portal to what I suspect, in my collaboration of various stories, is another world. I cannot tell if it a single world or if it is many worlds, as accounts vary. One person says that the land is so black, the air so poisonous, that it is like the very personification of the darkest magical arts. Another says that the trees are made of the brightest silver and the leaves are made of the purest gold. Yet another one claims of seeing the lushest hills and greenest greens with an abundance of crops and forests. The final account I assessed before writing this letter speculates that, upon multiple trips, these are all different lands within one world, having claimed to track travelers in these lands. I do not know for certain, as this author is also reputed to have multiple personalities, while others claim she is schizophrenic. However, I will trust her judgement to a point as she is the only one to have made multiple trips. And every account concurs that, barring injuries, illnesses, and whatnot, the portal itself will not kill you. But unless you have half your body physically anchored on this side of the Veil, one cannot return. There is, barring events that happened after their arrival on the other side, a very good chance that Severus, Sirius, and Remus are still alive.</em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p>Running her fingers across the descriptions of the lands, something tugged on her memory – stories told by an elderly Hobbit. But rather than dwell on that and what it could mean, Azalea focused on what her Aunt’s reaction would likely be. She could still remember the day Severus proposed. Petunia had refused until she knew her son and niece would be loved as well. It had been surprising to see that Severus had gotten “proposal gifts” for them as well, claiming he wasn’t asking just one person to be allowed into the family, but rather he was asking all three of them allow him into the family. She and Dudley had been given matching lockets, sturdy and clunky looking things with a thick chain, decorated with an oak leaf, a five-point gradient pint azalea bloom, and a dark purple petunia bloom, all in tiny precious gems. The two of them had cherished the lockets, never taking them off, as they were enchanted to repel water, dirt, and mud.</p><p>When Azalea had broken the news, Petunia had nearly shut down, barely surviving to take care of herself. She had slowly returned in the years since, but was still a shadow of her former self. The news that her husband may still be alive, though out of reach, should cheer her a little, if not motivate her to follow. And Azalea would let her Aunt walk through the Veil if it meant her happiness.</p><p>A prickling of magic dancing across her shoulders and down her spine – like a cold wind slipping under a cloak - caused her to sit up in alarm and look out the open window to the balcony beyond. Stars danced merrily where they had on place to be, before coalescing into one ethereal being. A woman, with near ebony black skin, rich black hair sparking with a fine diamond studded covering, and crystal blue eyes now stood on her balcony, looking both as if she belonged, and sorely out of place. Azalea’s eyes took in the simple gown that glowed as if made from pure starlight, before widening as a breeze stirred the still air, lifting her riotous curls before they settled once more to trail lovingly across her cheekbones and arms, stark against her pale skin.</p><p>"Hello, Child of Magik. I am Varda, Queen of the Valar. I, along with my husband and our siblings, have been watching you since Mother Magik first brought you to Arda, to the arms of the Baggins family. Frodo has not forgotten you, nor have you, I suspect, forgotten him." She smiled gently, pale brown lips turning upwards as Azalea’s gaze drifted to her desk, landing on an old, still portrait of a curly haired, leaf eared youth, with cerulean blue and a bright smile. Below that was a foreign inscription that she could tell you with certainty meant <em>Family is by Choice</em>. "Yes, Yavanna is quite fond of him. We all are, honestly. Frodo, and his uncle. He’s a strong lad, but he needs you. But war is brewing, his strength will be tested, and I know we have no right to ask you this, but would you be willing to come to Arda? Permanently? Take a moment, and consider this. Are you truthfully content here?” Azalea wanted to blurt out that yes, actually, she was perfectly content, but as she gazed a Frodo’s portrait, she couldn’t. She hadn’t returned after the skirmish in the Department of Mysteries, having not wanted to taint her favorite Hobbits with her burgeoning war ways, but it sounded like they were about to learn these ways whether she went or not.</p><p>“Is my presence required, or will it just be beneficial?” She could feel Varda’s gaze on her bowed head, and refused to look up.</p><p>“It would be beneficial. Extremely beneficial. Frodo will be in need of your brand of strength and belief. However, I must warn you. When we asked Mother Magik for permission to as you this, she told us it would be your last trip. You would be unable to return.” Emerald eyes snapped up to meet crystal clear, only to glaze over as a twenty-five-year-old memory made itself known.</p>
<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em>"One day, Childe, the time will come for you to make a decision. Do you want to stay in a world that would see you dead, young, or will you leave, taking your nearest and dearest, to live in a world where you can prosper and live a long life? It is not a decision that can be made now, as you may find enough to keep you here, despite knowing your fate."</em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p>At five, when she had been told this, she had not understood what the woman meant, with her old wisdom and youthful face and sad eyes. Nor had it made any sense at the end of the war when she was twenty-five going on fifty, and gazing at those who survived, starving and exhausted, perhaps now, five years later, things were a little clearer.</p><p>The war against Voldemort had taken a lot out of everyone. Her little Army was nearly decimated, looking rather emaciated and exhausted. The regular civilians were still trying to find their missing loved ones, with little hope. The remains of the Death Eaters were trying to gain their freedom, and the Ministry was being rebuilt from the ground up. Five years later, they needed a scapegoat for everything. Azalea had done all she could to raise funds for war relief, donating her time and gold to the rebuilding efforts, though she did her best to stay out of politics. But everyone was insisting she marry, and, before her medical file was leaked, insisted she have an heir. Now, they claimed she was a warmonger, that she could have ended the war much sooner. Her Army was hunted, in hiding with the exceptions of herself, the Weasley Family, and the Ribald Clan, keeping in contact via enchanted journals, courtesy of the Weasley Twins. Knowing she only had thirty-nine left in her Army, in her nearest and dearest, she gazed determinedly at Varda, spine straight. Varda nodded from where she now sat across from her.</p><p>“We, the Valar, only have one request. You and yours build a community. A magical community. An open one. But only after everything has settled. Mother Magik has confessed that she plans to leave this world, abandon those left here, before they kill her. You and yours respect her, and we want you to teach our people the same, so that we may welcome her fully.” Azalea smiled sadly.</p><p>“We can do that.” A hand grazed her cheek softly, and she closed her eyes, leaning into it.</p><p>“Thank you. Now,” Varda stood gracefully, backing away towards the balcony, “I will return in seven nights to take you directly to Frodo Baggins. Before I leave, let me say: your friend there has some good resources at her fingertips. All accounts she relayed to you are correct, and they all lead to Arda. Your uncles and godfather are alive, though tensions are, as I mentioned, rising, everywhere. Oh, and please find a way to destroy the Veil. It has been in tact for far too long. I shall see you in a week, Daughter of James and Lily.” Varda left much the same way as she had arrived, in a swirl of foreign stars. Before she could gather herself, a soothing trill sounded from behind, and she relaxed, leaning back and closing her eyes.</p><p><em>&lt;Ease yourself, chicklet. Things will work out as they should, and seem better in the morning light. Mother’s gift will follow you and those who go with you. Trust in that.&gt;</em> Her chair swiveled around as she turned to face the two phoenixes perched behind her desk. One was Fawkes, who had trilled softly in his sleep, sensing her mild distress at only having a week to prepare. The other was her beloved Hedwig, once a snowy owl, returned to her as an Ice Phoenix. After the year on the run, when she had managed a major victory over Voldemort, though unable to finish him, Azalea studied to become a Warlock, to be able to finish the job. The final stage to becoming a full Warlock was for a phoenix to accept a bond. Both phoenixes had appeared that day, and she enjoyed not only the healing ability of a Fire Phoenix and the fighting boost of an Ice Phoenix, but the companionship and conversation the two brought with them.</p><p>Azalea acknowledged her longtime friend’s words with a nod, but instead of taking the hint to return to sleep, she pulled several clean sheets of parchment her way and started to write. First order of business was to decide who she could not live without, those who would understand and support her even if there were unwilling to follow this time, and those she would just leave letters for.</p>
<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em>Petunia, Dudley, Ron, Hermione, Draco, Neville, Luna</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Molly, Arthur, Bill, Charlie, Percy, Fred, George, Ginny, Fleur, Tonks, Gerontius, Adamanta, Isengrim, Hildigard, Isumbras, Hildigrim, Isembold, Hildifons, Isembard, Hildibrand, Belladonna, Donnamira, Mirabella, Isengar</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Poppy, Minerva, Pomona, Filius, Cedric, Viktor, Gabby, Seamus</em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p>Thirty-nine people left, and only seven that she knew would follow without a single trace of doubt. Oh, she knew all of them were loyal to her and to each other, but she did not feel she had the tight to ask them to upset their lives and their businesses for her. Not with another war in the future. Shaking her head, she also drafted a series of letters to be sent to Skeeter “after her death.” She could see it now, <em>The Tragic Story and Sordid Details of the Girl-Who-Lived</em>, or something as corny. But it was a chance to sow discord, and she owed the woman that much. On the back of the lists, she started another draft, to be sent out to those she wouldn’t talk to personally.</p>
<p></p><blockquote>
  <p><em>It started twenty-five years ago. I was visited by someone who called themselves </em>Mother Magik<em> and taken to visit a new world. I was taught how to travel on my own, with the stipulation that I could only stay a total of a month in that world per year. I made friends, and learned new things. Now, this world faces war, and my friend, Frodo, is at the center of it. I am going to go help him, by the request of the Gods and Goddess of that world, as well as Mother Magik herself. But I will be unable to return. This is my last trip, and I always knew it would arrive. But Mother Magik has said that I may bring people with me (or rather, to a point, have you follow behind me). But this goes beyond a war, which I could never ask you to join. No, Mother Magik wants a new community, a magical community, in this world. Should the war be won in the favor of the Free Races of Middle Earth (I'll tell you more about that later on), this will be our task. Our final task.</em></p>
  <p>
    <em>Magic, in this world, is not feared by those without, though it is misunderstood by the misinformed and ignorant. Our laws here would have no effect on us there. Heedless, of your decision, because I cannot ask you to fight someone else's war, I will be going. If you choose to follow, thank you. If you choose to stay, then my opinion of you will not change.</em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p>It was only a draft, and she needed to add more to it, most definitely, but it was a start, and a start was all she needed. She turned to her account ledgers, and Hedwig trilled a laugh as she disappeared in a flurry of snow, only to bring back her account manager, Griphook, to sort out her will.</p>
<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em>The Last Will and Testament of Azalea Jaime Potter</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>I, Azalea Jaime Potter, being of sound mind and body, proclaim this to be my last will and testament.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>First, I would like all of my properties to be renovated into orphanages and schools for those under eleven, as well as secondary schools for those who either cannot go to Hogwarts, or wish not to go. My fortune and accounts, with the exception of the contents of Vault 1313, Vault 1314, Vault 1315, Vault 1316, Vault 1317, and Vault 1318, will go to the upkeep of these properties, and the salaries of the staff. These properties, and the hiring of the staff, will fall under the purview of Griphook of Gringotts.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>The contents of Vault 1313 go to Hogwarts. The books are all copies that I have found in my combined libraries, and after making sure they were not personal, I hereby donate them to the Hogwarts Library. Please take care of them. The brooms are for Flying class, and there is a standing order from Quality Quidditch Supplies for a new set every five to ten years. Please, use these well.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>The contents of Vault 1314 go to the Weasley Family, plus married members. You deserve this after all you have done for me since I returned to the Wizarding World. Hermione, there is a full bookshelf with copies of books that both myself and Hogwarts already had. Enjoy, and I'm sorry, everyone, for leaving like this.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>The contents of Vault 1315 go to the Ribald Family. I found that one of my family's personal vaults contained these building materials, and I thought that, if anyone could get any use out of them, you could, with your wide range of skills. Thank you.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>The contents of Vault 1316 go to Neville Longbottom. There are clippings from every plant in every greenhouse from every property, all under the proper Stasis Charms, with identification and instructions as given by the caretakers of the greenhouses. Even if you already have them, I thought you could use these.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>The contents of Vault 1317 go to Luna Lovegood. I hope you find every creature you have ever told me about, and so many more besides. Live life to its fullest, and follow your dreams.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>The contents of Vault 1318 go to Draco Malfoy. Thank you for growing up, cousin, and thank you for believing in me when I didn't. I'm so sorry for everything I have ever said or done.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Second, I return my shares in Weasley Wizarding Wheezes to Fred and George Weasley, split evenly between them. My shares in Belladonna's Apothecary are to be returned to Belladonna Ribald. The remainder of my shares are to be sold off.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Third, I would like to officially end the Potter Line. The ladyship dies with me, and I swear, on my honor, there are none left who have enough relation to claim the line.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Signed, Azalea Jaime Potter</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Date: 7 October 2010</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Witnessed: Griphook</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Date: 7 October 2010</em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p>With the Will written and witnessed, she no longer had to worry about taking care of that. She just had the letters to finish up, and then had to get everything into Griphook’s custody.</p><p>"I will bring this by in a few days with everything else to be handed out or mailed after the reading. I promise, I will not change the will at all." Griphook nodded, before allowing Hedwig to return him to the bank, and Azalea took a moment to stretch out her back and shake her hand, warding off the impending cramp</p><p>From there, it was time to start a to do list for the next week.</p>
<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em>Get a new trunk (living space versus multiple compartments, talk to G. Ribald)</em><br/>

    <em>Get a new pack and tent (war means travel, Middle Earth means walk or ride)</em><br/>

    <em>Linked Mailboxes (Gred and Forge?)</em><br/>

    <em>Talk to House Elves (follow or find new families?)</em><br/>

    <em>Gather Petunia, Dudley, Weasley Family, Hermione, Draco, Neville, Luna (talk with them first)</em><br/>

    <em>Talk to Ribald family during trunk issue</em><br/>

    <em>Find Fleur and Tonks (talk)</em><br/>

    <em>Send letters to Poppy, Minerva, Pomona, Filius, Cedric, Viktor, Gabby, and Seamus (ASAP)</em><br/>

    <em>Get the letters for Skeeter (release over time)</em><br/>

    <em>Brew War Packs<br/>
</em>
    <em>Put together First Aid Kits<br/>
</em>
    <em>Pack</em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p>It was a fairly short list, with plenty of room for additional items, but it was enough to settle her mind enough to start arguing the pros and cons of living spaces versus multiple compartments. She needed versatility, something for a long term staying, like multiple compartments, and a tent for short term staying. But the ability to carry passengers in a living space (not able to be done in a collapsed tent) to pass unnoticed might be useful. But a somewhat quick access to her clothes, books, potions cabinet, writing supplies, weapons, armour, camping gear, and such would be useful. Maybe Gerontius had an answer, but that would have to wait.</p><p>The gentle song of the early morning birds pulled her attention to the sunlight streaming in through the window, and she stood once more, twisting and stretching to work out the kinks from sitting down so long. She would start with the trunk, as that had the possibility to take the longest, but first, she needed to change out of her nightgown.</p><p>Standing in front of her mirror on the inside of her wardrobe, Azalea’s eyes traced the tattoos marking her as a Warlock - a Wizard with a focus on battle magiks. She was the first Witch to complete the training, to the extreme shock (and dismay) of the other Warlocks. She no longer needed a wand for most things, though she had needed a custom one made for her higher power core once she achieved Warlock status. The core had been a feather each from Hedwig and Fawkes, bound with their willingly given blood, while the wood had been a sturdy Iron Oak that had been particularly stubborn, with a feathery design. As she picked up her brush, her eyes moved from the tattoos - the black warlock marks and the colorful phoenix bonding marks - to the scars accumulated through her life, and in the war. To her, they were a testament of her strength, of what she had been through.</p><p>Slowly, she pulled the brush through her waist length hair, before Dutch Braiding it, the thick queue heavy against her back. She then pulled on a pair of black leather trousers, followed by leather boots of the same color that went to mid-calf. A dark green, high collared vest followed, leaving her arms bare as she tightened the ties that held it shut. The back was decorated in gold and silver embroidery, forming two phoenixes. On her belt, she placed a money pouch and a pouch containing extra armour discs. She slid her golden Army Medallion into the holder on her vest, brushing her fingers over it with a sad smile.</p><p>Her arms were left bare, except for plain black leather bracers around her wrists, showcasing the black lines of her Warlock tattoos and the bright swirls spreading out from the two phoenixes that were branded onto her sides, one fire, one ice, that were the marks of her bonding with Hedwig and Fawkes. She adored those marks the most, especially since it meant she was never too hot nor too cold; she was always kept comfortable, no matter the weather. The result was intimidating enough to keep the dissenters quiet and the fans as bay.</p><p>Once her wand was in a thigh holster and various daggers were stowed around her body, she quickly floo’d to the Leaky Cauldron, not bothering to eat or grab a cloak.</p><p>**</p><p>"Morning Azalea!" Tom’s bright greeting through the quiet and mostly empty bar brought a tight smile to her face as she mentally added him to the list of letters. Tom’s family had long been loyal to the Potter family, and that had been very helpful during the war. "Would you like a breakfast?" As always, he seemed quite eager to serve something up, and she felt a pang of regret.</p><p>"Not right now Tom. I will eat on my way back through, though. I promise." She placed a few Galleons in the tip mug, and smiled at him. "I have a meeting to get to, though."</p><p>"Then I’ll not be keeping you. Hurry along now. I’ll see you when you come back through, and I’ll make sure there’s a Treacle Tart and Firewhiskey waiting!"</p><p>With a distracted "Thank you!" over her shoulder, Azalea stepped into the back alley and opened the gate to Diagon Alley. Thankful it was still early enough for the street to be rather quiet, she strode quickly towards Ribald’s Trunks, her long legs making it easy to arrive at her destination.</p><p>"Good Morning Gerontius. How’s your father today?" Gerontius Ribald, current owner, looked up, his greying curls flying out, from the register and smiled.</p><p>"And a wonderful morning to you too, Azalea! Father, well, this appears to be one of his better days, thank you for asking. Now, how may I help you today?" Gerontius swept his dark blue eyes over her outfit, and raised an eyebrow. "And may I say you look wonderfully dangerous today? I don’t think I ever congratulated you on achieving Warlock status. It’s a good look for you."</p><p>"Thank you, Gerontius. I was wondering if you could do a custom job, but have it done in a few days. I was thinking several compartments, at least ten, if not a couple more, and all of them magically intense. Expandable wardrobe, potions cabinet with storage space, library, and a filing cabinet to begin with. Now here’s where things will get tricky. I’m planning on traveling. I also want a compartment that is a room for my knitting and sewing, as well as a similar compartment to house my woodworking and metalworking. If they have to be two separate compartments, that’s okay. Then one that can hold all my weapons and armour, though I would prefer it to be a room as well, for the sake of keeping it all safe. Another compartment for camping supplies, and an extra compartment, preferably with an Expansion Charm of some level for miscellaneous items." Gerontius frowned at the parchment he had been taking notes on.</p><p>"You said you were traveling? Tell you what, I just mastered a new technique. Listen, I can do all of this, and throw in a living space that has access to all the compartments from within, as well as a kitchen, a room that can mimic any outdoors area you want, a bedroom and bathroom, a living room, and a dining room. I can add extra rooms as well. Up to you. And I can do this all today, most likely, barring any mishaps. The base cost would be one hundred Galleons, but I also have to figure in the extra labor, the various algorithms and runes to get everything done properly, as well as adding all the charms and wards to it. May I ask your help in powering everything, that way it only recognizes you and won’t open unless you give them access?" Azalea smiled at Gerontius.</p><p>"That sounds perfect. I think I would want a bedroom and bathroom, a living room/dining room combo, a full kitchen, a potions room, three different craft rooms - go ahead and separate the wood and metal - the room that mimics the outdoors, a library, a potions room, and, if possible, three large greenhouses. I would also like a way to hide and carry it without much trouble, and not just the Self Shrinking method. Maybe something like a cloak pin?" She absently summoned some parchment, pulling a stick of charcoal out to start sketching several possible layouts. Gerontius poked his wand at several of the sketches, moving them around, and Azalea started writing down proposed room sizes.</p><p>"Certainly. How about you join me when I create the rooms so that you can tell me how you want them, and we can take care of the materials then? Belladonna is able to run the shop today, so I can work directly with you and not get side tracked."</p><p>"Sounds good. Shall I let you get started on the calculations? I need to make a few stops before I can help. My pack from the war is beyond repair, as is the tent."</p><p>"Oh, go ahead, go ahead! It will take me a couple of hours to figure out exactly which runes will work best for what you want. Each design requires different configurations, after all! Come back after lunch, and we can finish it all up then. Have a good day, Azalea!" With that, Gerontius was lost in his runic work, and Azalea just chuckled and left the shop, waving merrily at Gerontius' oldest daughter, Belladonna, a Slytherin two years behind her, dodging people as she made her way to Burnett’s Sports and Outdoors. Hearing the chime of the bell over the door, Azalea drew in a breath to steady herself. Last time she had been in here was just after graduation, and things had been really tense then. Cynthia Burnett bustled forward with a tentative smile.</p><p>"Lady Potter, I am so glad to see you in a better time. How may we help you today?" Azalea released her breath, relaxing, and gave a genuine smile to the young woman.</p><p>"Cynthia, I’m glad that this is a better time for shopping. My pack and tent were destroyed in the final battle, and I’m getting ready to do some traveling, explore the world, learn new things, that sort of stuff, so I was looking to replace them. I was thinking a good hiking pack and tent combo, nice and simple, easy to overlook, but still not too modern. I really like how you’ve been integrating the non-magical technology into the magical tents, particularly for the easy of putting things together, but I really like the solidity of the older tents." Cynthia nodded.</p><p>"Of course, Azalea. I completely understand. So, a Hiking combo, you said? I assume you want Undetectable Expansion Charms on them, the pack particularly, as well as Weather Repelling charms, Insect and Animal Repelling Charms, and Feather Light Charms? What kind of wards, if any?"</p><p>"Yes, to all of those charms, but only the basic Anti-Theft Charms instead of wards. I’m planning on warding the area around the campsite instead of the tent itself, and other than that, it will always be near me, so a simple Leash Charm will take care of that. I was also wondering about bedrolls and hammocks. If the weather is nice, I wouldn’t mind sleeping under the stars themselves."</p><p>"Those actually come with the Backpacking Combination. Backpacking, I don’t know if you know, can actually take several days, while hiking is normally a single day. If you’re traveling like I suspect you will be, I would actually suggest the Backpacking Combination. Would you like leather or canvas?" Azalea looked up from where she was examining the Backpacking Combination, noticing the Mix and Match option.</p><p>"Leather pack, canvas tent, leather base for the bedroll, canvas hammock, if possible. All in browns." Cynthia nodded, and lined up the four items. The pack was rather simple, with a main body, two side pockets, and a front pocket, a place on top for the bedroll, a place on bottom for the tent, and a metal frame that would help even out the weight. The hammock would fit neatly into one of the side pockets. Once the charms were in place, Azalea looked around the shop further. "Do you happen to have mess kits, clothesline, clothespins, soaps and the like?"</p><p>"Of course, Azalea. Right over here. Now, as a reminder, that tent is not furnished, but I can switch it out for a furnished tent."</p><p>"Don’t worry about it, Cynthia. I still have most of the furnishings from the first tent." <em>Lie, but I will be furnishing it with stuff from the properties, same with the trunk.</em> She went through and grabbed a cast iron mess kit that doubled as cookware for a single person, a canvas bag of clothespins and thin rope, a collapsible washboard, and several bars of the two types of soap, one for laundry, hair, and body, and the other for dishes. She also grabbed matchbooks and flint-and-steel sets, and a few various items, like waterproofing wax, and hunting knives, along with whetstones and oil cloths. Right as she was about to wrap things up, she grabbed some fine netting, meant for keeping bugs out of a tent or off a hammock. Despite the charms, it would be useful. "Alright, I think that covers it. Thank you, Cynthia." She paid, putting everything within the pack to sort out later, and left the shop, heading to Scrivenshaft’s, to see if she could get a travel writing desk. She was in luck, and walked away with a writing desk with an expanded interior. That would make things easier, since it would fit neatly into her pack, so she wouldn't have to open her trunk except to refill the desk.</p><p>A stop down a side alley saw her leathers, retrieved by one of her house elves, repaired and respelled, and she bought some new chainmail to line them. Happy with how her morning had gone, she fairly skipped back to Ribald's Trunks, intent on dragging Gerontius to the Leaky Cauldron for lunch with her.</p><p>"Morning there, Belladonna!" Belladonna, despite the war, had not changed much since Azalea had met the first year, later sorted into Slytherin, during the train search for Sirius Black, and had very dark curls, almost as black as her own, with light honey eyes. She had been one of the few Slytherins that she had gotten along with. It still cracked Azalea up to know that the Ribald Clan might as well have been the part of the Took Clan that Bilbo’s mother was part of, though she never said anything to them about that, and dearly hoped she never would have to. If they did follow, however, it was bound to come up at one point. Bilbo had told her many stories from his mother, Belladonna, about his various aunts and uncles. "Is Gerontius in the back?"</p><p>"Yes ma'am! Quite excited about the challenge you presented him with, too! Got my brothers working on the base, Iron Oak, while he finalizes the runic structures. Gunna drag him out to lunch?" The two grinned at each other, well aware of the fact that, when caught up in his work, the man would forget all about food. It was a running joke in the family that work and Azalea were Gerontius’ mistresses, since, other than his wife, Adamanta, Azalea was the only person able to get Gerontius to take a break without too much fuss.</p><p>"Planned on it, luv. Tom's got a Firewhiskey and Treacle Tart with my name on it, and I plan to collect. I adore that man. Always remembers what I like best, and keeps the paparazzi away. Want me to bring anything back for you?" She leaned on the counter, Belladonna doing the same from the other side, causing the two of them to come nose to nose.</p><p>"Nah. Donna and Mira are working the kitchens right now, so I'll be fine. Hey, if you've time, say goodbye to Grand-da, please. We can see that you're leaving, and he won't last long anyway. He has always adored you. So has Ma and Da and all the rest of my siblings.” Azalea’s eyes fell shut as she leaned her forehead against her friends. “It’s quite easy to see that you plan on leaving, and honestly, none of us blame you. I only ask you say goodbye to Grand-da." Azalea sighed quietly, pressing her forehead harder against Belladonna’s, fighting tears.</p><p>“I needed to talk to all of you anyway, about this. I leave in just under a week. Perhaps a potluck in two days’ time? Will he hold on that long?” Belladonna nodded, and Azalea opened her eyes. “Good. I promise to spill all then.  Now, I’m regretting my decision to not grab breakfast.” She stood back up and skipped into the back room. “Gerontius! We should fuel up before continuing, and Tom has Treacle Tart and Firewhiskey waiting for me! Hey boys. How’s the wood behaving?”</p><p>"Stubborn, Miss Azalea, just like you." Gerontius' oldest, Isengrim, grinned at her from where he was guiding the sanding charm across the lid. "You take Da to lunch, iron out the details even further. When you get back, we should be at the point of being able to etch the runes into the sides and then you can start creating the living space you want." Isumbras and Hildigrim nodded in agreement from where they were assembling the rest of the trunk.</p><p>"Ah, Azalea. I have just figured out the rest of the runes. You said something about food?" She laughed and tugged the elder man's arm.</p><p>"Yes. Let's let them finish their work, while you and I fuel up for casting a lot of magic later. Come on, old man." With a loud laugh, they made their way to the Leaky Cauldron.</p><p>"Back for some food, Azalea? Come on, I have your usual, as well as a booth open for you. What would you like, Gerontius?" Tom bustled out from behind the bar, leading them over to the open booth.</p><p>"Steak and Kidney pie, all the fixings, and a Butterbeer, please Tom. Thank you." With another grin, Tom bustled off to grab their drinks.</p><p>"So, you said you had it all figured out?"</p><p>"I do, actually. I did a small test of it, and discovered I had to use Iron Oak instead of my usual wood, as it wouldn’t hold the magic, but you saw the boys doing the base work. The compartments won't be too difficult, as they're fairly standard, but the living space is always tricky, as it needs to match the owner of the trunk. I will need you with me, at the very least, for the final layout and size. Once everything is set, and the wand work finished, you'll need to set passwords into the wards. After that, it's a matter of choosing what you want to turn the trunk into for travel, and I can set that using a runeset. After that, we will cover the runes, and finish it up." Azalea nodded, already running a final sketch on a spare piece of parchment, making notes of the final room sizes and the pin she wanted it to become.</p><p>"Sounds wonderful. Thank you for doing this for me, Gerontius. How much is it going to be?"</p><p>"One hundred and fifty. I’ll throw in the leather and wards for free since you’re helping me with the powering of the Charm work. I figure you’ll want some of that Basilisk hide you donated. No one really wants it, unfortunately." She looked up and stared at the man sadly.</p><p>"That sounds reasonable, though I am sorry the Basilisk Hide didn’t sell. Is it alright if I do the wards, though? I want to use some pretty specific ones that you aren’t licensed to cast." Gerontius waved off her apology as the food arrived.</p><p>"Sure, so long as you don’t get my shop in trouble." The two laughed as Tom grinned at them from the bar, enjoying the laughter. He always thought it a treat to hear those two talk about wards, runes, and algorithms, even if he was left behind. That was why he always set them near the bar, far enough away from the main crowd that they weren’t easily spotted, and close enough that he could keep track of how Azalea was doing. He still remembered the scared girl who appeared, just turned twelve, running from predators, and the nearly sixteen-year-old angry young woman out to set the world ablaze.</p><p>"Enjoy, you two!" Azalea dug into her Shepherd’s Pie, even as she eyed the Treacle Tart that Tom had promised.</p><p>"I promise, I won’t get you or your shop in trouble. They’re just more powerful than yours, and cast in Parseltongue. They’ll be strengthened by the Basilisk Hide, as well, so that’s a bonus. Oh, and Belladonna invited me by in two days’ time. Something about a potluck dinner and catching up." Small lie, but Gerontius just gazed at her sadly. It was likely that he had already figured out that she was leaving, but she would tell him everything in a couple of days. Meanwhile...</p><p>**</p><p>That evening, Azalea sat in front of her new trunk, running a finger along the scales and over the iron covering the corners. Beside her, the tent was set up, and she had the bedroll, pack, and hammock set off to the side. Skippy, the head House Elf at Potter Manor, was sorting all her clothes for packing. She had the other elves working on gathering all the furniture into one room, shrunk down to the size of doll furniture, and sorted by type and size. Others were gathering all the portraits of her ancestors, as well as any other paintings, like scenery. Once she furnished her tent and living space, what was left was going to furnish the renovated estates. She would be keeping the portraits, and maybe even some of the scenic paintings, with the rest also going back.</p><p>She sighed, and looked at the list of people she needed to talk to. <em>Aunt Petunia, Dudley, Ron, Hermione, Neville, Draco, and Luna are top priority. Then the rest of the Weasley Clan, Fleur, and Tonks. I will talk to all of them tomorrow, preferably in two separate groups. The day after that will be the Potluck Dinner at the Ribald’s. I have the letters drafted, just need to add the personalized touches and send them out. </em>Really, she should have spoken to the seven on her first list today, to give them as much time as possible to prepare, but she had spent too long in Diagon, gathering quotes to give to them. She would just have to wake up pretty early tomorrow, then. Gerontius knew enough now to tide him until the full story at the Potluck. Shaking her head to rid herself of the memory of watching three of the most important men in her life fall through the Veil, Azalea stood.</p><p><em>Might as well get as much done as I can,</em> she thought grimly, grabbing boxes to pack up her three workshops and armoury. <em>It is going to be a busy week. If I can get a helping hand in putting these four rooms, the library, and the Potions lab put back together, then I can get the tent, at the very least, furnished, and hopefully the living space, too. Perhaps Neville will be willing to help me with the clippings of the plants I know I can care for on my own. I don’t want to take too much of their time, but the will have longer than I have to get ready.</em> With the four boxes packed and labelled, with others labelled for her library and the Potions lab set aside, and a list of the many potions needing to be made and set into kits, Azalea stripped and curled up, exhausted, in her new bedroll, ready to talk with Mother Magik.</p><p>**</p><p>Morning came with a shriek, and Azalea sat straight up, knife in one hand, the other glowing with magic as she worked on waking up. Eyes finally clear, she saw seventeen people standing in the middle of the nearly empty room that had once been the Master Suite of her Manor house. Turning a glare on the two innocently preening Phoenixes, she got up, ignoring the slightly self-conscious shuffling as her bare body was revealed.</p><p>“Right, give me a mo’ to get dressed, then I’ll say what these two feathered fiends want me to say.” Grabbing her clothes, she dressed swiftly, noting the additions of a box labelled clothes and a hanging rack near her trunk. “Look, I’m leaving. A few of you know this, though I know most of you do not, but I spent my years, from five to thirteen, visiting a world called Middle Earth. I made some very good friends there, though various events have kept me from visiting recently. The Higher Powers of Middle Earth, with the assent of Mother Magik, have asked me to make one last trip, one I will not be able to return from. Middle Earth is on the brink of war, and one of my dearest friends there is in a position similar to mine. I will help him, to the best of my abilities. Aunt Petunia, Dudley, Ron, Hermione, Draco, Neville, and Luna - first, I know I have no right to ask this, but will you help me?” All seven of them nodded, all of them with eyes that said she never had to ask. “Second, Hermione, I have since learned more about the Veil from what you sent me. It is a portal to Middle Earth. Meaning, yes, Severus, Sirius, and Remus are all alive.” Petunia nearly collapsed in relief. “This portal is how you will be getting to Middle Earth. Mother Magik will guide you.” She turned to the others. “I feel like I have even less of a right to ask you to join me, so I won’t. I won’t even considering asking you to rip up your lives here. But the offer is there. The offer is there, honestly, for all thirty-nine Medallion holders. I have quotes from the various stores I visited yesterday, and a small booklet of Middle Earth, including a packing guide. Gerontius is aware of this, mostly, and-” She was cut off as Petunia and Dudley sandwiched her into a hug.</p><p>“I think I can speak for all of us when I say we should have one more war within us to fight. And if I get a chance to slap Severus, then so be it. Just remember that I am a support person, not a fighter.” Azalea wrapped her arms around the two as she looked around, taking in a fretful Molly and ecstatic Fleur, the smirking Weasley men, the broad smile of Tonks, a dreamy Luna and solid Neville, to the analytical stare of Hermione and the raised eyebrow of Draco.</p><p>“Thank you. Mother Magik spoke, last night, saying that you would have a month, minimum, to prepare, so would you be able to help me?” Several heads nodded, even as Arthur, Bill, Charlie, Percy, Fred, George, Fleur, and Tonks all stated they needed to go to work. “Before you go, take a copy, each, of the quotes and booklets. Just keep them hidden.” They left, and Azalea turned to consider those left and consult her mental list.</p><p>“Draco, here’s a list of potions. War Packs and First Aid Kits, as many as you think I’ll need for a few months without the lot of you. After, get everything - ingredients, cauldrons, everything - into that box, and, if I’m not there, transport it to the Potions Cabinet using the password <em>Papa’s Lore</em>. You know my particular organization methods.” Draco grinned and grabbed the list and box, before snapping off a playful salute. “Don’t forget the pronunciation!” Her passwords were all in Westron, the highly secret language of the Hobbits.</p><p>“Hermione, that box should fit my library. Leave the shelves, but please grab every pedestal you can find. There’s a green, leather bound book on one of them that needs to be kept separate, as it will become the catalogue. Lord and Ladyship journals kept together in numerical order, I will move the grimoires due to the blood protections. Everything else is ordered by subject, then author, and finally title, if necessary. Password to the Library is <em>Knowledge</em>.” Hermione nodded firmly, before grabbing the box. “Oh! If you finish and Draco is still brewing, see if you can help him.” With a laugh, Hermione was gone.</p><p>“Dudley, that box holds the armoury. Password is <em>Mercenary</em>, and if there are any repairs needing to be made, make note and, if there’s time before I leave, will you take care of them, particularly the weapon repairs?” Dudley nodded and bussed a kiss across her cheek before grabbing the box. “Afterwards, once I’m done with my task, will you and Aunt Petunia join me in purchasing whatever furnishings I don’t have?” The two nodded, and Aunt Petunia ran a hand over her braid.</p><p>“I will work with your house elves to get your kitchens and rations stocked. I’ll also make note of what I think you may need.” Without waiting for a response, Petunia turned and strode out of the room.</p><p>“Thank you! Ron, Luna, those boxes contain my Wood and Metal Workshops, respectively. Ron, <em>Elvendom</em>. Luna,<em> Erebor</em>. Let me know if you run into needed repairs.” Ron rolled his eyes as he grabbed the box, even as Luna skipped forward to do the same.</p><p>“You got it, Azalea.” Azalea relaxed as Luna’s airy voice wafted through the air, recognizing the effects of Luna’s brand of comfort.</p><p>"Molly, will you take that last box and set up my Home Crafts room, please? It’s <em>Shire.</em>” Molly reached forward and drew her into a strong hug.</p><p>"Of course, dear, and when I'm done, I'll join your aunt for a time before I must return to the Burrow." Molly released her with a watery smile, filled with strength and conviction, and Azalea returned it with a comforting one of her own.</p><p>“Thank you, Molly.” She turned to Neville as Molly bustled out of the room. "Nev, will you work with Flipsy to gather clippings from as many of my greenhouses as you can? She knows which plants I can handle. They need to be sorted into Basic Healing and Cooking, Magical, and Other. Use as many boxes as you need, then set them by the trunk. I'll transfer them to the greenhouses." Neville nodded in his quiet manner and turned to leave. Azalea looked around and inhaled, biting back a vicious curse. She had forgotten to talk to Fred and George about the mailboxes.</p><p>She glanced at her list of compartments, then around at the remaining items in the room. First, she would have to get her clothes and linens sorted out, then she needed to go through and select furniture for the tent and living space, she hoped she was lucky enough to only need to get kitchen and bath furnishings. Before she got started, Pinky, her head chef, appeared.</p><p>“Mistress’ aunt was wondering where you wanted the food and rations for Mistress’ trip to be put, and Pinky found that Pinky did not know.” Azalea placed a hand on Pinky’s thin wrist, and smiled.</p><p>“Just pack it up, placed under as many protections as you can, separated by kitchen and travel, into boxes and place those against that wall there. I will further organize the food as I feel needs to happen when I get to packing. Be sure to leave enough for the week, and perhaps beyond, if the others need to use this place as a base while they pack.” Pinky nodded, and popped back to the kitchens. </p>

</blockquote><p>Placing the list on her bedroll, Azalea quickly put her clothes into her new wardrobe compartment, sorting out the linens until she knew what would go where, and grabbed two empty boxes. It was time to go furniture hunting.</p><p>Deciding on a mismatched theme for the tent, she found five bunk beds of varying designs, and set them in a box. They were joined by five wardrobes, just in case she had many people needing to stay long term in the tent. Sleeping area mostly figured out, she turned towards the dining area. Following the thought of possibly hosting many people, she grabbed a large table and bench set that would seat eighteen, if people were friendly, and followed that with cast iron cookware and mismatched dishes. She decided against any of the kitchen appliances, making note to instead buy camper kitchen appliances later. That left a quiet area and a lounge area to be figured out, as well as linens. She grabbed three large sofas, five oversized chairs, and several bean bags, as well as a small bookshelf, a reading lamp, a short, but large, natural wooden slab table. Linens were easy; she just grabbed enough sheets to make ten sets, not bothering to match anything other than size, several bath towels, kitchen towels, napkins, and a couple different tablecloths and threw them into the box. She then added several rugs, decided that what she didn’t use in the tent could find a home in the living space, and vice versa.</p><p>Focusing now on the Living Space, she found several items made of Iron Oak that would match the desk, wardrobe, and cupboard that were linked to the compartments. Due to the trunk being Iron Oak, those items were also of the same wood, since they were actually manifestations of the trunk itself. With a loft bed and a vanity set aside, as well as a standing mirror, she decided on a five-foot chaise lounger and wall shelves to go under the loft, and nearly danced a jig upon finding several sectionals - enough for a personal lounge as well as the family room. She chose an eight foot and a six-foot sectional with a six-foot chaise sectional for her personal lounge, all in a calming dark brown, and added several end tables. She grabbed several sets of bed linens, all matched and all in dark colors, as well as large area rugs in both neutral tones and jewel tones. With the bathroom furnishings waiting to be bought, she grabbed several bath mats and towels, and items beyond the tub and shower so that she could match the finish.</p><p>For the family room, she grabbed enough sectionals to make a large ten food square, added a couple of coffee tables, and turned back to the oversized chairs. While the sectional made for great group discussions, oversized chairs made for better relaxation. Adding several matching chairs, she also grabbed a few more end tables and two small bookshelves. Further following the idea of hosting many (and really, she rather enjoyed large gatherings anyway, so it all worked out), she grabbed a large dining table, this one only seating ten, and surveyed the remaining pieces. Grabbing a couple of chess tables, she grinned. So far, everything was turning out nicely. Cookware, table linens, and china were added to the pile, and she put it all in a second box labeled Living Space.</p><p>With the bedroom, family room, and kitchen taken care of, she grabbed some runners for the corridor, then went through everything. All three workshops were fully stocked, the greenhouses had their tools, and the armoury did not need anything. She grabbed several sturdy lab tables for the Potions Lab, being the only thing she was missing, and work tables and reading chairs for the library. The outdoors room - that she had started calling the yard - was one hundred acres of land, some open, some forested, with a Quidditch Pitch. Deciding on some furniture, she grabbed several lawn chairs, a few picnic tables, and made a note to purchase supplies for a fire pit and barbecue pit. That done, she grabbed the boxes and took them to the room she had been keeping things to pack.</p><p>With the furniture boxes set aside, she grabbed the several floating notes. Molly had finished the Home Craft Workshop, making note that everything was in working order, and Petunia had sent her home to start cleaning and packing the Burrow. Dudley said that he had finished the armoury and had taken some things outside to repair with Luna's aid. Hermione and Ron had finished their tasks and were with Draco, brewing. Neville had simply asked if he could have some clippings from her Greenhouses. Looking around, she noted that there were several boxes labeled with what plants were inside. Grinning, she shook her head, planning on talking with Neville about the clippings she had already set aside for him. This meant that all she needed to do was buy the missing furnishings, install them, furnish the tent and living space, and then pack everything to her liking. With a relaxed sigh, Azalea grabbed the letters to run edits while she was in the vehicle, and turned towards the door. Things were much easier with people helping. It was time to go shopping.</p><p>On the lawn, she spotted Dudley and Luna finishing up repairs, and smiled. Luna was so small, even next to her, that she was practically dwarfed next to her cousin.</p><p>"Hey guys! Dudley, you ready?" The two turned, and grinned.</p><p>"Yeah, just finished this last mannequin. Let go get mum."</p><p>"You should do a waterfall, Azalea. I'll go help brew." Luna skipped off, and she shook her head. Of course Luna knew she was debating on that. The bathing area in the tent was large, though not ginormous, and she had been thinking about making it look like a natural hot spring with a waterfall. Most of it would be charm work, but she would need to get stone.</p><p>"So, I was thinking a Barbecue Pit and Fire Pit, a large Jacuzzi tub, two sets of kitchen appliances, one full size and one camper size, as well as some island counters, and, apparently, stone for a waterfall." Dudley nodded, already jotting down potential places to find the right materials, and they left, Aunt Petunia driving while they discussed the pros and cons of the various brands they were researching, letters in her purse, forgotten for the moment.</p><p>**</p><p>Setting the purchases down, she rushed back down to the Potions Lab, intent on grabbing Draco, Luna, Hermione, and Ron. It was time for dinner, then they needed to get started on their own packing and distribution. The potions were at the point of packing, and the lab was ready to be transferred, and beyond that, she could finish, easily, on her own. Tomorrow, the letters would go out, and she would tell the Ribald Clan.</p><p>After dinner, she sorted through the boxes, finally being able to add the Potions Lab to the trunk. Her desk supplies, Potion's lab, portraits, and furniture were set with the full kitchen, bathroom, yard equipment, and plants by her trunk, while everything else was set in front of the tent.</p><p>The right half of the wardrobe was an expandable hanging rack, and the left half was shelving, with a long shelf going along the width, and the bottom of each side had a drawer a piece. The right door had a shoe rack with belt slots, and the right door had a mirror. She quickly made sure her robes, cloaks, and dresses were all on the wooden hangers, and her knickers, chest bindings, night clothes, shirts and vests were on one shelf, with her trousers and light armour on another. She placed the extra linens and pillows on the top shelf, with her framed pictures along the long shelf, to be placed around her room later. Her boots and flats went in their respective spots, as did her belts, and she placed her hair stuff in one drawer, and what counted as feminine products in Arda in the other drawer. After making sure her rushed job from earlier was fixed, she nodded firmly.</p><p>The Potions Cabinet was very simple, with shelving for completed potions, and several drawers for bottled ingredients and empty bottles. The well in front of the cabinet, within the trunk itself, was padded for optimum storage of various cauldrons and stirring rods. The Filing Desk was nothing more than two filing cabinets of varying drawer sizes with a top connecting them for her to write on, and a folding chair stored between them. Both were filled swiftly, and she skipped the Pantry until she had furnished the tent. Opening the Miscellaneous compartment, she placed the boxes with containing items for the Living Space, with plenty of protective charms around the plant clippings, before closing the lid. It was late, so she just slid the boxes containing the tent items into the tent itself, before collapsing onto her bedroll.</p><p>The next morning, after a quick breakfast, she entered the tent and sorted out the boxes and furniture, already mentally dividing the tent. The tent was large, twenty-eight feet by forty-two feet, with a small kitchen area, a water closet, and a large shower already sectioned off. She grabbed the appliances she needed to install and went straight to the kitchen.</p><p>An hour later, she was just finishing the charm work on the shower to finalize the effect of a waterfall down to a natural pool that took up the entire room. Satisfied, she stretched and set out as many rugs as she dared before starting to set up the furniture. The bunk beds and wardrobes were set up efficiently and she conjured some curtains to keep the area private. The bookshelf and two of the chairs, as well as the reading lamps, went against the back wall, and the table and benches were set up along the left wall. Finally, she set the three sofas and remaining chairs around the center, surrounding the natural cut wood top table and set the beanbags around randomly. Pleased, she exited and collapsed the tent, putting it in its storage bag and putting it back in the compartment.</p><p>By this time, Dudley had arrived, and they were ready to get started on the Living Space. Dudley would be working on putting together the two pits in the yard while she focused on everything else.</p><p>She once again started with installing appliances, starting with the bathroom, enlarging the Jacuzzi tub to take up half the 10X20 space. The shower was simpler, but everything had green marble inlays, and she put the towels in the linen cabinet between the water closet and the shower.</p><p>In the bedroom, she put up wooden screens to act as walls, separating the area for a private lounge from the rest of the room. Her loft bed with the chaise underneath was set in the far-left corner, her desk against the back wall, and the wardrobe, vanity, and cupboard were set along the wall shared with the bathroom. After much deliberation, she put the standing mirror in the back-right corner, then set up the sectionals in the lounge, setting end tables around to provide some kind of setting.</p><p>In the family room, she put the rest of the sectionals and the coffee table in one corner, set up the quiet corner with two over sized chairs, several beanbags, and a bookshelf. Another corner held the dining table, and she put the last bookshelf in the last corner, along with a sturdy poker table and the chess table. That corner was for games, and she would damn well make sure she had them stocked.</p><p>Once the linens were put away, she grabbed the family portraits and used her magic to hang them around the Space; most of them went to library, with the secondary portraits going elsewhere, but her parents were put in her personal lounge. She quickly put the work tables in the lab, and went to set up the kitchen, the last area to furnish.</p><p>All that was left was to pack her pack, send out the letters, and get what was needed back to Griphook, as well as work with Fred and George on the Mailboxes - she had finally remembered to contact them about that. But most of that would have to wait. For now, she had to get ready to go to the Ribald's.</p><p>**</p><p>Seven days had passed since Azalea made the decision to leave, and now, in front of her stood the Varda, looking a little more stressed.</p><p>"I will be taking you to Rivendell; Frodo is there. Do you have everything?" Azalea took a moment to mentally review everything. Had she remembered to tell those that were following her to wait for Mother Magik? <em>Yes.</em> Did she remember to pack all her clothes? <em>Yes.</em> Did she remember to grab her trunk? <em>Yes, it was the phoenix pin on her vest.</em> Her pack? <em>Yes, and it had everything in and on it.</em> Her walking stick? <em>Yes, Petunia had made sure she had it.</em> Did Fawkes remember that he needed to stay and arrive with the next group? <em>Yes, and he was upset about it since Hedwig had gone on ahead.</em></p><p>"Yes, I have everything. If I forgot anything, chances are those following will grab it. I am ready." Varda gave her a strained smile.</p><p>"Very well. Fair warning, you may be disoriented by this form of travel. Your Ice Phoenix is waiting for you, as is your brother. Come.” Azalea took her hand, closing her eyes in preparation. She remembered how bad it once was to travel like this.</p><p>This form of travel was, indeed, very disorienting, and once she landed, Azalea did not bother to take note of her surroundings in favor of dropping down to put her head between her knees.</p>
