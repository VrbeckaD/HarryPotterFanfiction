I'm doing alright for myself folks<br/>
I'm healthy, I'm wealthy, I'm wise<br/>
My investments and such<br/>
Have all gone up so much<br/>
Seems whatever I touch<br/>
Starts to rise</p><p>I've got men, I've got money<br/>
And yet<br/>
The thing I want most<br/>
I can't get</p><p>Â </p><p>(sung)<br/>
I live in a mansion on a hill with gold all around<br/>
I pulled up a weed, they found oil in the ground<br/>
But you telling me you don't want me around-<br/>
Now, honey, that's rich</p><p>Some guys give me ermine<br/>
Chincilla and mink<br/>
And some give me diamonds<br/>
As big as a sink<br/>
But you wouldn't give me so<br/>
Much as a wink<br/>
Now, baby, that's rich</p><p>I get fire brandy from Andy<br/>
And candy from Scott<br/>
Oh, and Frank and Eduardo<br/>
Chipped in for a yacht</p><p>I get stares from the fellas<br/>
And prayers from the Pope<br/>
But I ran out my luck<br/>
Getting stuck on some dope!</p><p>(Harry shows up)</p><p>Hey baby, I was just talking about you<br/>
Now, listen, sport<br/>
This life's too short<br/>
To waste it on you<br/>
It may be rough<br/>
But soon enough<br/>
I'll learn to make do<br/>
With the mansion, the oil well<br/>
The diamonds, the yacht<br/>
With Andy, Eduardo<br/>
The pontiff and Scott<br/>
And Frank. Oooooo!<br/>
And my bank!<br/>
So spill no tears for me<br/>
'Cause there's one thing you ain't<br/>
That I'll always be<br/>
And honey<br/>
Yeah, that's right<br/>
That's rich! That's rich!<br/>
That's rich! That's rich!<br/>
(Draco kisses harry and then leaves a very confused harry behind)</p></div>
