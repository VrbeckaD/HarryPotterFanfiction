    <p>Albus Dumbledore always had plans, and plans within plans. It was the way he was. He had first mapped out his life at the age of five, bright with magic and future. He would become the best wizard the world had ever known, leader of the magical world. A child's naive and self-important dream. He refined it when he grew older, hammered it, shared it with Gellert – with Grindelwald – and believed in it with all his soul and power.<br/>
Then it all came crumbling down on the floor when Ariana did. Lifeless and a husk where once there had been brightness and magic, his plans – his dream, and Ariana both.<br/>
He gave up on wanting power, on wanting to lead (even while he did, but oh, it was forbidden to want), but he always planned.<br/>
When he looked Severus Snape in the eyes and pleaded, his life at an end, he had an idea of how the war was going to go. He had urged it that way, and he believed in the children he left behind. He had to, after all. He believed he had made mistakes, but he had done the best he could have done.<br/>
He was right on one point. He had made mistakes.</p><p>*</p><p>He woke up in his old bed, in his mother's cottage in Godric's Hollow. The summer sun cascaded through is bedroom window (he always negliged to pull the curtains shut), ran on his books and parchments and interesting trinkets (his trash, according to his mother) and pooled on the wooden floor like liquid light. Lying lazily in bed, under his ravenclaw-blue sheets, he could almost think he was fifteen and bright and full of promises again. But he couldn't hear the morning birds that always used to chirp outside his window in the summer. He couldn't smell the fresh flowers his brother used to pick every few days and that Ariana disseminated in the house everywhere she wanted.<br/>
He was old, and he was wizened, and he was alone. Not fifteen, full of dreams, but a hundred and fifteen, and he knew dreams always ended up crumpled on the floor in a yellow summer's dress.<br/>
At least Tom's curse didn't follow him there. His hands were wrinkled with age and whole again. Not that he needed them where he was going, he expected, but he was relieved that the vile, awful magic didn't cling to him anymore. All the regrets and nightmares plaguing him were his own, and he carried them with practiced ease.<br/>
There was a set of robes at the foot of the bed, but it had been left there by a boy who died long ago. It didn't feel right to take them. As he thought that, he was clothed, like something had felt his reluctance to take what was here. Or maybe he was the one who did it? He didn't know this place, as familiar as it felt, didn't know its rules, or indeed if there were any. He chuckled lightly, shaking is head. “Time to go”, he said, and waited. “I am ready”, he said, and waited. The room stayed unchanged. Maybe this wasn't just a place between places, like he had thought. Or maybe he still had things he needed to see here before he went on to the next great adventure.<br/>
Or maybe he didn't know anything about what was going on and needed to explore.<br/>
He went to the door and took a deep breath. He hadn't felt anticipation in a long time. The future wasn't bleak for him. There was no future. Tom seemed so far away here. Harry also, and at that he felt a twinge of guilt. Had he done all he could... ?<br/>
But he could do no more. He was removed from the world now, and his plans within plans would go on without him.</p><p>The handle felt surprisingly real under his fingers. He realized he had expected it to dissolve into smoke. He opened the real? door and stepped into the real? hallway and went to the stairs. Now that he was out of his room, he felt something calling him from downstairs. He let his fingers trail on the wall (real! So real.) as he answered the call. The third step even creaked just as it should. Except for the smells and sounds that he didn't make, it was just like his home, even if it was only in his head. But then maybe that didn't mean that it wasn't real, after all. Every time he went down a step, he seemed to shed a regret, or a nightmare. He was almost free and happy when he got into the living room.<br/>
Then he saw that he wasn't alone after all, and all his regrets and nightmares cascaded down the stairs and caught up with him and threatened to drown him again, for there perched on a chair next to the window was Ariana, in her favored yellow summer dress (that she had died – would die – had died in) (and it was his fault, his own fault). </p><p>He couldn't move, he couldn't breathe (but he didn't need to anymore, did he? It was just an habit now), as his murdered sister looked at him, and she was so full of life, even there, in this place that was by essence lifeless.<br/>
“Ariana... “ he whispered, and as she smiled at him his heart broke in pieces, and all the shards torn him from the inside. And he welcomed it, he deserved it, he had killed her, but there she was in front of him, and she wasn't fourteen and dead yet, she wasn't fourteen and dead anymore, she always would be fourteen and dead. But she did smile at him and the smile was life itself in this lifeless place, and was it really lifeless if Ariana was there and smiled at him?<br/>
“Al,” and he had always hated that nickname but now he didn't know if there was anything he loved more, “you're there. I'm sorry you didn't change the world, after all.”<br/>
She jumped from the chair and went to him in that half-dance step she always had when she was happy.<br/>
He wanted to reply, but the shards from his heart seemed to be lodged in his throat. I'm sorry, he would have said. I'm so sorry, Ariana. It was my fault. I'm sorry you were forever fourteen and that I was so selfish and learned too late that I loved to have a sister. I'm sorry to have learned that you weren't a burden only when you were already dead.<br/>
He swallowed the shards and tried. “I'm... so glad to see you, Ariana.” He clenched his hands. “I'm sorry. It was my fault.”<br/>
She nodded. She didn't smile anymore, burdened by a sadness beyond her years. “Yes, it was, wasn't it? Not only your fault, but still.”<br/>
He closed his eyes. He didn't deserve absolution, and he was almost relieved that it wasn't given to him. </p><p>Ariana's hand came to rest on his own. “I forgive you, Al. You understood that you did wrong.It was too late, but you had a hundred years of torment, already. I won't add more.” She pressed her fingers to his. “I could. I won't forget what you and Gellert took from me. And from Aberforth. But you took from yourself too,even if I was the one who paid the highest price.” She smiled again. “I choose to forgive you.”<br/>
She hugged him like she had as a child sometimes, and this time he let her, crying silently. That was absolutely more than he deserved. It was Ariana's choice, and he was so lucky.<br/>
“You can't right this wrong, Al, but there is another child you badly failed.”<br/>
He blinked, his mind refocusing sharply. “Harry?”<br/>
She shook her head. “Yes, you did fail several children, didn't you? But I'm talking before that. Long before. Tom.”</p><p>He looked at her, uncomprehending. “He wasn't... “<br/>
“He was a child. Not a good child by any means, but a child. Ask yourself, did anyone show him how to be better?”<br/>
She waited for an answer, but he had none.<br/>
“He was eleven and brilliant and alone, Al. Why didn't you try? Why did you give up on him? I thought Gryffindors were supposed to be strong and brave and true.”<br/>
He shook his hand free of hers. “But I was right. Look at what he became. A monster.”<br/>
“An eleven-years-old child is not a monster, Albus!” Her gaze pierced him, and her eyes were darker than he had ever seen. She didn't look fourteen. “You were wrong. You had to try. You were his chance, and you didn't try.”<br/>
“He didn't want me to try.”<br/>
“Of course he didn't. You should have tried anyway. You should have kept at it.”<br/>
He took her by the shoulders. “It was after your time.”<br/>
“It should have been my time.”<br/>
He cruised past the guilt and the sadness and plowed on. “It was after your time. Why do you care so much about what I failed with Tom? Are you really Ariana? My sister?”<br/>
She shook herself free and he let her. “I am, Albus. I also am more than your sister Ariana. I am not fourteen. I am fourteen years alive and ninety-eight years and an eternity dead. I am not who I was in 1899, but you aren't that either.”<br/>
Her hands found his again.<br/>
“I am here for myself. I am here for you. And I am here to give you a chance to right one wrong you did.”<br/>
“Why Tom?” He sounded defeated even to his own ears. “Why can't I save you?”<br/>
“Because it is not the choice I am offering you. You can go through the door of the cottage and move on, and I'll go with you. Or you can Floo elsewhere.”<br/>
He looked at the chimney, and the flames were bright and strong, incongruous in the summer heat. He was sure there hadn't been a fire earlier.<br/>
He was lost. It wasn't what he had planned.<br/>
“I don't... I don't want to live my life again. I don't want to leave you. Again.”<br/>
“Choose, Albus. You have all the time in the world, but it is running out.” She didn't seem to realize this didn't make sense. The rain battered the windows.<br/>
He only had one choice, really. He gazed longingly at the door, and then reached deeply in his pocket to retrieve the Floo powder that he knew had appeared there.<br/>
He locked eyes with Ariana. “I will do what is right, and not what is easy. The next great adventure will wait.”<br/>
She smiled, and sunlight again flooded the windows. “Then I will go with you. And you will not live your life again. It doesn't work like that.”<br/>
“How does it work?” He threw the powder into the flames, which turned sapphire blue.<br/>
“You will see. Or maybe not. Maybe you don't need to.” She stopped him before he stepped into the flames. “Did you decide to help? Did you commit to this course of action? Do you choose to engrave it in your soul?”<br/>
With every word she said, the colors bled from the room, leaving only the sapphire flames and them out of the black and white.<br/>
“I do.” Albus said, and meant it. It was what Ariana wanted, and it was what was right.<br/>
She nodded and pushed him into the flames. His world turned blue.</p>
