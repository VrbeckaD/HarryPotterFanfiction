    <p>Harry James Potter would have liked a quiet life.</p><p>Well, that wasn't <em>strictly</em> true. He always did like a bit of mischief and enjoyed causing his classes to erupt into chaos, however indirectly he could manage it. Granted, these opportunities were few and far between, seeing as <strike>his cousin</strike> his tormentor, Dudley Dursley, seemed to make it his life's goal to separate Harry from anyone he might have made friends with. By the end of the year, any students were in one of two groups: Dudley's Gang, who spent most of their time "Harry Hunting" which consisted of chasing Harry until he fell over or couldn't run, then beating the everloving hell out of Harry until they were bored and moved on, or Everyone Else, who ignored Dudley to make sure that <em>they </em>weren't the next target of Dudley's "Hunts".</p><p>Of course, Harry knew that no one in the staff cared enough to stop Dudley. Hell, they didn't look into the fact that for the first month of primary, Harry didn't respond to "Harry", but <em>did</em> respond to Dudley calling him "Freak". Never mind the fact that a child was only responding to being called a freak, and that said child had honestly <em>forgotten</em> his name. Harry knew this had happened, and knew that none of the teachers cared, as they'd been told by <strike>his aunt and uncle</strike> the people he lived with that Harry was a delinquent, a menace, and a thief, so making up that he had forgotten his name seemed natural behaviour such an ill-mannered, attention-seeking child.</p><p>Harry didn't mind, all things considered. Yes, the beatings from those who were <em>apparently</em> his family hurt, but each one was a lesson that Harry had burned into his brain. Don't get caught. Don't interrupt. They fall asleep at 11:30 sharp each night, now you can get food. Don't mess up drinks, otherwise, they're thrown at your face.</p><p>Harry managed to get his own back a few times though, notably on Dudley's 11th birthday, as he was complaining about receiving fewer presents than last year's haul.</p><p> </p><p>"36?! But last year I had 37!" Dudley had screeched out. How he hadn't deafened someone by this point, Harry would never know.</p><p>"Yes Duddykins," Petunia was placating the lump. "But we'll get you 2 more presents on the way back from the zoo."</p><p>"So I'll have..." Dudley paused. Dear God, Dudley doing basic maths? We'd be here all day! Someone best step in.</p><p>"You'll have 38 presents, Dudley," Harry said, rolling his eyes. "Which is 1 more than last year."</p><p>"Oh. Good." Dudley had finally finished ranting, thank god, but that allowed Vernon to start.</p><p> </p><p>"Where's my coffee, boy!?" Vernon shouted from the dining room.</p><p>"Be right there, sir," Harry replied. Yes, drown yourself in caffeine and high blood pressure, fat man. Lord knows it'll do the world a favour. It will be a slow, but sure death, and I'll be right here to serve you the instrument of your expiration.</p><p>Okay, maybe Harry was being a bit melodramatic. So what? Anyone would be if all they had was the Dursleys for company. He wondered briefly if this is what sensory deprivation felt like, before realizing that Vernon was still talking.</p><p>"-you'll be on your best behaviour, Boy, otherwise you'll be in the cupboard for a week!" Vernon paused to catch his breath. "We can't leave you alone in the house, far too many valuables in one place for your grubby little hands, and Mrs.Figg still has that broken leg. So we'll be taking you to the zoo with Dudley, and you won't do <em>anything </em>to ruin <em>his</em> birthday! That includes any of your <em>freakishness!</em> Understand!? " Vernon finished his rant, his face turning plum purple.</p><p>"Yes sir, of course, sir," Harry said, trying to convey being cowed. It had worked, as Vernon looked disgustingly pleased with himself. Congrats, you've made a 10-year old scared of you. What do you want, a prize? A cookie? A trophy made of cookies? Now how would that work? Questions for later. </p><p>As Harry got his <strike>rags</strike> clothes ready, he realized something. He was going to the same place as Dudley for a change. This was surprising, seeing as the only place he was in on Dudley's birthday was at Mrs Figg's house, which was nice, even though it reeked of cats and dust. Although, the silence was preferable to the Dursleys, so maybe he just had low standards. Then again, this new thing was with Dudley. He had a knack for ruining seemingly unruinable things. </p><p align="center">********</p><p>After a thankfully uneventful drive, Harry arrived at the zoo and took notice of a Boa Constrictor behind a glass panel. Dudley and his rat-faced friend, Piers Polkiss were bothering it. You'd think they could make it do the can-can on command the way Dudley's sausage fingers were pounding on the glass. Now <em>there's</em> an odd image.</p><p>"Leave it alone Dudley, it's probably sleeping," Harry said wearifully. "It isn't going to move." Dudley looked miffed with Harry before Piers drew his attention at an ape exhibit. Yes, be with your kind for a change and leave a decent society in peace. </p><p>Harry was alone now, and so tried to strike up a conversation with the snake through the glass. He'd realized he could do this during one of his many afternoons in the garden, as Petunia seemed determined to have a perfect garden yet put no actual effort into having one, a garden snake came through. Harry tried to tell the snake to shove off while shooing with his hand, but then the snake <strong>talked back in perfect English.</strong> 'Great,' Harry thought dismally, 'I've finally gone mad. Still, better than the Dursleys' I suppose.'</p><p>Back in the present, however, the Constrictor's eyes shot open, looked at Harry, and said "<em>A ssspeaker? Here?" </em> "Present and accounted for," replied Harry. "Hopefully you'll be a better conversationalist now the shock has worn off." He wondered why no one else talked to snakes, they always seemed so surprised when he did. Then again, it could have been that he was making these conversations up in his head. He was, after all, barking mad.</p><p><em>"No, hatchling, I'm afraid I won't be."</em> The Constrictor, mentally rechristened as Beau in Harry's mind said. "Why not?" Harry asked. Beau then pointed to a sign that read 'Bred in Captivity - Brazil' "Ah," said Harry. "Shame. Still, perhaps you could tell me about your da-"</p><p>"PIERS LOOK!"</p><p>Before Harry could react, the lump of fat in human disguise ran with surprising speed towards the enclosure, knocking Harry to the floor and pounding the glass panel with his fists, attempting to get it to move. Beau hissed his displeasure and laid back down.</p><p>Harry was pissed, not just because he'd knocked to the floor, but because he'd stolen his only good conversation in months! 'Fine,' thought Harry, 'if he wants to see it so much, he can see it up close and personal!'</p><p>Suddenly, as if by magic, the glass panel disappeared and Dudley fell right into the enclosure. Beau shot a look of pure gratitude at Harry. <em>'Thank you hatchling! Brazil, here I come!'</em> Harry saw Beau slithering through the crowds, scaring passers-by by hissing at their feet. Harry wished the best for Beau, though thought he'd most likely be caught by the zoo security.</p><p align="center">********</p><p>After the zoo incident, Vernon promptly drove everyone back to 4 Privet Drive, before locking Harry in the cupboard without dinner. Harry wasn't sure why he'd been locked away before he cooked dinner, as no-one else ever did. Then once the greasy smell of fish and chips started to leak through the walls, Harry realized something. Not only was he the only one who <em>would </em>cook, but was the only one who <em>could</em> cook.</p><p>
  <em>Idiots.</em>
