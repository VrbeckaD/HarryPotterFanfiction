    <p><em><strong>"Gryffindor!"</strong></em> the Sorting Hat boomed without hesitation to a packed Great Hall as soon as the Sorting Hat was placed upon his head, and Draco Malfoy knew that something was wrong, terribly wrong.</p><p>Where <em>WAS</em> he? Or more accurately, he supposed, since he already knew exactly where he was- Hogwarts, WHEN was he? This was back in the Great Hall of Hogwarts during a Sorting Ceremony, and since the hat had been placed upon his head it must have been his first year- in fact, his very first <em>day</em>...except that he most definitely had <em>not</em> been sorted into Gryffindor when he'd attended the school. Time and events had changed him in a few ways and softened him at least a bit, but Draco couldn't- and wouldn't- deny that had been every ounce a Slytherin on the day of his Sorting Ceremony all those years ago.</p><p>All he remembered was going to bed the previous night in his home next to Astoria after seeing Scorpius off to Hogwarts for another year, then fuzzily waking up to sitting down and having the Sorting Hat eagerly waiting to make its assessment.</p><p>Surely this was some strange dream of his past that his mind had decided to play out for him, but why had he been sorted into <em>Gryffindor </em>in what he presumed to be his memories? <em>Why</em> was he even dreaming of his Hogwarts days to start with? And, as he had the hat removed from his head and reluctantly headed over to the standing, clapping Gryffindor table who were welcoming him with smiles and cheers, he also got to wonder with a large jolt of fear coursing down his spine <em>why was his younger self sitting amongst the throng of students at the Slytherin table</em>? His head started to pound as he sat down, handshakes and names flying at him and circling like a hundred pixies nagging for attention. He managed a few shakes, nods and weak smiles to the other Gryffindors <em>(what in God's name was going on?)</em> before placing his head into his hands and letting out a light groan as he tried to figure out what was happening, a headache almost immediately beginning to form as the din of cheering and conversation filled the Great Hall.</p>
<hr/><p>The sounds of a train slowly filtered into Draco's ears as he awakened with somewhat of a jolt, realizing that he'd been dozing on a seat on a train. Wait...a <em>train</em>? He then glanced around and realized that he was, somehow, on the Hogwarts Express, a young Crabbe and Goyle sitting across the compartment from him. He then realized that between them was...<em>himself</em>, the only change his striking green eyes that glanced up at him with a mix of puzzlement and worry, 'Draco' studying him closely and frowning before his eyes moved around the compartment as well, the other boy clearly trying to find his bearings as well.</p><p><em>Green eyes</em>? Did that mean-?</p><p>He glanced down at his body (<em>was</em> it considered his body now? He supposed it was) and saw an outfit he would never have been caught in. Draco's eyes narrowed, realizing that if someone (and he had his firm suspicion who it was- those emerald eyes were a dead giveaway) was in his younger body, then <em>he</em> was in someone else's. And that someone else <em>had</em> to be Potter. <em>Somehow</em>. He reached up and to the sides of his face and felt to see if he had glasses, and was not surprised at all when his fingers brushed and then curled around cheap wire frames. Draco was just trying to somehow subtly catch Potter's attention to drag him to some corner somewhere and ask him what in the world was going on, more than part of him wondering if this was some strange variety of dream that he still needed to wake up from, when he caught a significant look from Ron Weasley out of the corner of his eye, then the redhead's eyes darting over to the only even partially empty spot a few times in a 'We're going over there' gesture.</p><p>"Harry? Malfoy? Can I, uh, talk to you both for a second over there?" Ron tossed his head over to the corner, the other two slowly getting up and looking at each other again quizzically before joining him over in the corner.</p><p>"OK, Weasely. What in the <em>hell</em> is going on here?" Draco hissed as soon as they were gathered together, Harry's voice jarring him as he softly spoke aloud. Draco's mind buzzed with discord after he spoke, as if it was unwilling to accept a voice that was so different from his internal dialogue. "Why are we back on the Express and even <em>more</em> importantly <em>how and why the bloody hell am I in Potter's body </em>?<em>"</em></p><p>"Yeah. Um, Ron?" Harry moved his arm up and down, indicating Draco's body that he was somehow currently residing in. "What in the world did you <em>do</em>? I was hoping this was some kind of crazy dream, but it's <em>not</em>, is it?"</p><p>"I, uh," replied Ron, furtively glancing around the Express before leaning in and continuing quietly to the pair, "I wanted to come back and try and fix things and wanted some help and I may have messed the spell up a <em>little</em> bit, alright?" He sighed and ran a hand through his hair. "Turns out time travel without access to a Time-Turner's...<em>tricky</em>, especially bringing others along at the same time <em>and</em> trying to not have memories reset. You two must have gotten...well. <em>Mixed up</em>, I guess would be the way to put it."</p><p>Draco's eyes narrowed. "So let me get this right, Weasely. Without asking <em>either</em> Potter <em>or</em> I, you decided to drag us back in time almost <em>thirty years</em>?" Realizing that they were being openly gawked at, especially by Crabbe and Goyle, the three then spread back out to their respective seats, but Draco had every intention of continuing their little chat as soon as they got to Hogwarts.</p>
