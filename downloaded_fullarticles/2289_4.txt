    <p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">When Harry woke up that morning in number 12 Grimmauld Place, the last person he’d expected to see was Fred Weasley, his upside-down face grinning back at him.</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Rise and shine, Harry,” Fred said, in a little sing-song voice. Harry groaned and blinked three times, hard.</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">The flame-haired Weasley did not go away.</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“You’re dead,” Harry blurted out, patting the bedside table until he found his glasses. He found them and put them on. Orange hair, freckles, broad shoulders – definitely Fred.</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Fred rolled his eyes in mock irritation. “No shit.” The fond look he shot Harry suggested he wasn't really mad or annoyed. The younger of the two blinked again, vision still blurred from sleep.</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“So… why are you here?” Harry asked, stifling a yawn. Light was already pouring in through the crack between the curtains and the wall, so he knew it must be mid-morning, but he still didn’t feel fully rested. He’d been having trouble sleeping recently, what with the end of the War and the huge loss of life that followed. His mind perpetually whirled with thoughts of obituaries, morale-boosting speeches and how to best restore the Wizarding Community to what it was – problems he probably shouldn’t be worrying about, but was anyway.</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Fred’s grin fell a bit. “You really don’t know? God, didn’t they teach you lot anything at Hogwarts?”</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Not about dead people waking you up in the morning, no,” Harry said, a little irritated.</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Fred bumped his fist into his chest once, then held out his arms as if showing off himself. “I’m your Guardian Angel, Harry,” he said.</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Harry groaned and let his head sink back into the pillow.</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">*</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">One floor above, Sirius was stirring in his four-poster bed. His pillow was damp with either drool or tears, he could never tell the difference. He rolled out of the damp patch, his head immediately complaining at the movement.</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“M’never drinking again…” he mumbled to himself, still not opening his eyes as he knew his headache would blossom into a fully-fledged hangover if he did.</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Like I’ve never heard that one before.”</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Sirius threw an arm across his face in response. His heart was racing – there was no mistaking that voice. “You’re dead, Remus,” he moaned, still refusing to open his eyes.</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">A laugh. It was a sad laugh. “Yes, Sirius. You know why I’m here.”</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“… I thought Guardian Angels were just a tale told to Muggle children.”</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Apparently not,” Remus said softly, resting himself against a bedpost like he had back when they shared a dormitory at Hogwarts. Sirius still hadn’t moved, and Remus knew exactly why. He’d drank far too much – again – and was regretting it, contemplating staying in bed long enough to delay the urge to puke. It had been a common sight during their school days, and since the Order had been using Grimmauld Place as a communal space to discuss strategies. The only time he hadn’t overdone it was when Harry stayed over, but even now that wasn’t enough – Remus had glimpsed Harry sleeping soundly when he'd passed by his bedroom earlier.</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Eventually, Remus got tired of the silence, and he sighed. “I’m here to help you, Sirius,” he said slowly.</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“I don’t need help,” Sirius replied, his words muffled by the arm still slung across his face.</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Clearly,” Remus said, voice dripping with sarcasm.</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">This time, it was Sirius who sighed.</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Look, Moony, here’s the thing. I know what you’re going to say to me. You’re going to tell me that I shouldn’t be drinking so much, that I’m missing out on life because I spend my time brooding around the house with my Godson, that I’m a waste of space. I don’t want or need to hear it, and frankly I’m allowed to wallow about for a bit when my best mate on the planet went and got himself blown up during the War.” Sirius finally opened his eyes and threw back his arm, not daring to look at Lupin but instead choosing to stare up at the canvas above him. The pattern he’d seen since his childhood was only a little shakier than he remembered – good.</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">There was an uneasy silence as Remus settled himself to sit on the bed, his presence not even making the bed sink. Sirius shivered at the realisation, pulling his covers tighter around himself.</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Those things are probably all true,” Remus started, and Sirius snorted. “But I have another job to do,” he continued, “I have to make you realise something. The quicker the better. I need to move on and be with her, Sirius.”</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Sirius finally turned to look at Remus. He looked no different than he had during their final years together during the War. His suit remained intact, and there was little to no evidence that he’d suffered during his last moments defending Hogwarts. Sirius, on the other hand, was a wreck. Permanent dark circles were stamped into his skull, his hair tatty and scruffy, and he was certain he stank – showers were not exactly a part of his daily routine anymore. The only time he bothered was his appearance was when he was obligated to attend a public event, but for the first time in ages, him and Harry didn't need to leave the confines of Grimmauld Place; thus the handsome Sirius Black looked about the same as when he'd been in Azkaban.</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Fine,” Sirius muttered after a while, closing his eyes again. “So what are you here to tell me?”</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Remus grinned slyly. “That you need to stop waiting around and snog Harry’s face off.”</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">*</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“So, let me recap,” Harry said, frowning and rubbing his tired eyes with his fingers, “you’re my Guardian Angel, and you’re not going anywhere until I realise… <em>something</em>… and then you’ll go… somewhere?” Fred nodded, so Harry continued, “and no one else will be able to see you, you won’t be able to see or be anyone else’s Guardian Angel, and you’re basically going to change my life.”</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Fred nodded enthusiastically. “Yep!” he said, swinging his legs from the top of the wardrobe he was sitting on. He was a little too chipper for Harry’s liking, but he finally began to relax. Maybe having a Guardian Angel wouldn’t be so bad. He certainly deserved a little happiness, especially after the blow of losing friends and family during the Battle of Hogwarts.</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“There is… something else too,” Fred said, as soon as Harry felt relieved at having remembered everything. Harry groaned again, and sank his head back down into his hands. He just needed a normal day where he wasn’t attending funerals or being interviewed for the <em>Daily Prophet</em>. His education from Fred about Guardian Angels had been interesting, but now he just really wanted to rest. He <em>needed</em> to rest.</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Fred stopped swinging his legs for a moment, a sombre look on his usually cheerful face. “I’m not actually going to tell you what you need to do.”</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“… Because…?”</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“It’s more fun this way!”</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Brilliant,” Harry muttered sarcastically, staring down at the floor between his fingers, “so you get to pop up every now and then to drop me cryptic hints about how to change my life.”</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“About how to <em>improve</em> your life, Harry. This pity-party is done. You know you can’t keep going on like this, it’s not healthy, it’s not something we would have wanted, blah-blah-blah, now are you going to accept my help or not?” Fred grumbled, folding his arms like a petulant kid.</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">It would have been funny if Harry hadn't been so sleep-deprived, so much in need of another month's worth of good, quality sleep.</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Fine,” Harry muttered, not missing the way Fred fist-pumped at the news, “just, fine. Just don’t embarrass me.”</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Fred grinned. “I’m not a poltergeist, Harry. I won’t pull your trousers down or anything. Besides, I’m a bit too mature for that sort of thing nowadays.”</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Harry snorted. “’Course you are, mate,” he said.</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">*</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Sirius and Lupin were in the kitchen when Harry finally came down, wearing the same t-shirt and jeans he had the day before. “He’s looking a little worse for wear,” Remus commented upon seeing his haggard appearance, and Sirius shot him a look, annoyed. Harry looked fine in his opinion, and probably would even if he wore a paper bag, but of course he didn’t say anything. After all Harry had been through recently, he didn't need to know about the Guardian Angel situation. It'd probably just make him worry more, something that Sirius knew the younger man definitely did not need.</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“’Morning Harry,” he said, trying his best not to sound irritated at his situation. He finished swallowing his hastily thrown-together hangover potion, grimacing at the taste. Bitter. “Tea?”</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Please,” Harry and Fred said at the same time, and Harry shot his Guardian Angel a disparaging look. Fred merely returned the look with a face that shone with innocence. Innocence which both of them knew he didn’t have. “You’re up early,” Harry observed as Sirius set about making the tea.</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Sirius shot a sidelong glance at Lupin, who seemed to be waiting for the Animagus to kiss Harry right there on the spot like they’d discussed upstairs. He was even making little kissing faces at Sirius, and the Wizard stared at him for a moment before replying to Harry's comment. “Yeah, I… felt like being productive today. Y’know, showering, brushing my hair, maybe even going out with you somewhere.”</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Don’t push the boat out too far, Padfoot,” Lupin snorted. Sirius did his best to ignore him as he served the tea, handing Harry his in his favourite mug.</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Harry smiled as he accepted the tea, inhaling the aroma as he waited for it to become drinkable. He let the warmth seep through the ceramic just long enough to make his hands sting a little before pulling back. “That sounds nice,” he said, settling back into his chair more comfortably as Fred seemed content to just sit there and be. Little did he know, the Weasley twin was plotting and scheming, smirking. “Where were you thinking of going?”</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Sirius winced. “Are you alright, Sirius?” Harry asked, concerned.</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Sirius gave him a small, but forced smile. “I’m fine, Harry. No need to worry about me,” he said, doing his best to ignore the poking his ribs were getting from his best friend, who was <em>still</em><span> making kissing faces behind his back,</span> “anyway, I was thinking of taking you clothes shopping, and then if the weather’s nice going out for a picnic somewhere.”</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Harry blinked, pausing as he went to take a tentative sip from his tea. “Clothes shopping?” he asked, as if he hadn’t heard properly. Sirius nodded, a more genuine smile on his face. He adored his alone time with Harry, and perhaps that was why Remus had been so insistent on them forming a romantic relationship. Recently they had both been so busy, preparing for Sirius' trial, celebrating, then writing speeches to deliver at funerals, planning a memorial structure of some kind at the still damaged Hogwarts... it was about time they spent quality time together, enjoying themselves.</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Sure. Can’t have you walking around in your cousin’s clothes anymore. What kind of shops do you like?”</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Harry looked uncomfortable. He shifted in his seat. He cradled the mug in his hands. He avoided eye contact. “Well, actually…” he started slowly, not really sure how to continue, “I’ve never really… been clothes shopping. Ever,” he finished lamely, bringing his eyes up to meet his Godfathers.</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Sirius huffed, putting his tea down with perhaps a little more force than necessary. A little droplet of tea splashed out, marking the table. Sirius' moods were infamous, so Harry's mouth began running away from him, “I mean, I went shopping for my school robes with Hagrid, so I’m just exaggerating really,” Harry said quickly, but Sirius held up a hand to silence him. It was clear he did <em>not</em> consider shopping for school uniform a real outing.</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Your Aunt and Uncle, they never… took you clothes shopping? Ever?” he asked, slowly. He was biting his tongue, figuratively and literally, anger curling inside his stomach at his Godson’s deprived childhood. Remus laid a hand on his shoulder, but Sirius shook it off, and to Harry the movement just seemed to be the older Wizard rolling his shoulders. The Werewolf merely looked on, watching the exchange as it became tense. Harry was clearly uncomfortable, but of course Sirius had to push the issue.</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Not really…” Harry began slowly, and Sirius pursed his lips. A parade of emotions crossed his face – fury, amazement, sadness. A lightbulb snapped and flickered above their heads – a sure-fire sign that Sirius was enraged, his magic unchecked - but no one dared look. Harry sat fearfully watching his Godfathers face, biting his lip anxiously.</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY"><a name="_GoBack" rel="nofollow" id="_GoBack"></a> Eventually he brought his eyes back up to Harry’s, a taut smile on the older man’s face. “I see,” Sirius said calmly, bringing his mug up to his lips to take a sip, although his actions looked extremely deliberate, almost robotic, “well, we’re changing that today, Harry. What sort of shops would you like to go to? There must be lots of places you'd like to try.”</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Err…” Harry started, struggling to remember where his Aunt had taken him and Dudley to, making him carry armfuls of extra large clothing to the fitting rooms so that the fat, spoiled child could try them all on.</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Uniqlo’s good for jeans, mate,” Fred whispered in his ear, and Harry jumped a little at the sudden noise. He tried to look nonchalant, but knew Sirius had caught the weird movement, the older man frowning. “They have good prices. H&amp;M’s cheap and good for basic stuff like t-shirts.”</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“H&amp;M,” Harry blurted, and Sirius raised an eyebrow, so he continued in a rush, “and Uniqlo jeans are good quality, cheap.”</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Really?” Sirius asked, gripping his mug a little bit tighter, and Harry swallowed again, nervously, “they’re both very cheap Muggle brands, Harry. Don’t you want to go somewhere… a little bit more upmarket?” When Harry didn’t say anything, only offering a weak smile, Sirius sighed, ran a hand through his tangled and dirty hair. “You deserve nice clothes, Harry,” he finished simply, biting his tongue as Remus gripped his shoulder tight, warningly.</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“I’ve got no idea about upmarket, mate,” Fred grumbled, and Harry nodded ever so slightly in acknowledgement, “My family were poor. It was Primark and hand-me-downs for us, I’m afraid.”</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Harry stared down into his cup. He knew it was weird, but he didn't need Sirius to make a big deal out of this. It had happened – or, rather, hadn't happened – and that was that. There was no reason to feel upset or let down by it all. And he certainly didn't feel angry about what the Dursley's had done to him after what he'd experienced during the War; he'd rather forget everything up until his new life.</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Eventually, Harry shrugged. “I don't know, Sirius,” he admitted quietly. He looked up at his Godfather shyly. “Could you help me?”</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">For the first time in what felt like an extraordinarily long time, Sirius smiled, genuinely.</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">*</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Why do you want me and Harry to be together so badly? Not that I'm completely against the idea, you know,” Sirius said, bustling about the bathroom trying to find a decent razor. He finally found one and set about searching for shaving foam. He was going to groom his face, try to brush his hair, and then set about washing himself for today's 'date'.</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Remus smiled to himself, leaning against the doorframe as he watched Sirius rushing about the place. It was nice being with his best friend again, even though they were physically a million miles apart. Only in this strange, semi-metaphysical way could he interact and communicate with Sirius, but that was what he had to be content with until they met again.</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“If you're not against the idea, why haven't you made a move?” The Werewolf asked, and Sirius rolled his eyes at his friend in the mirror, having successfully found some shaving cream.</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Because, you dimwit, he's dealing with a lot right now. His friends died, some of them got mauled – ouch!” Sirius exclaimed as he nicked his cheek, a droplet of blood blooming and mixing with the white foam. He glared at his reflection for a moment before continuing, “Besides, I've been dealing with my own stuff too, y'know. Haven't exactly been in the mood for wooing.”</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“That's not like you at all!” Remus said with a laugh, “Even after James you went back to flirting with everyone immediately.”</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Yeah, well, couldn't let Lily know about his dirty little secret, eh?” Sirius said, only somewhat spitefully. His face was half-shaved at this point, although he wasn't exactly sure whether he wanted a completely hair-free face or not. He stood gazing into the mirror, razor poised as he considered how to present himself. After some thought, he resumed shaving.</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Anyway... there are a million reasons why I haven't made a move yet on Harry,” Sirius continued, catching but ignoring his friend's raised eyebrow for a moment or two. “The James thing, for one. I don't want him to think he's a replacement for his dad... because he isn't. Harry is Harry. James is James. They're different.” Remus nodded to show he was listening, but still clearly dissatisfied. Sirius thought again.</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Then there's the age difference – and before you say anything, I know that's a shit excuse, but it might change things. Maybe Harry wants someone his own age.”</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Or he might want someone with a bit of experience,” Remus pointed out, “and yes, so far, your excuses have been shit. Try harder.”</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Okay... being gay. Maybe he isn't gay.”</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“You know he is, Sirius. You caught him kissing that Malfoy boy after Quidditch practice in his third year.”</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Doesn't mean he's gay, they stopped when they saw me.”</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Because your Animagus form looks exactly like the Grim, you twit.”</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Sirius barked out a laugh, then checked himself – it wouldn't do for Harry to walk in on him now, washing the shaving foam from his face, trying to tackle the nest of tangles and knots in his hair. He tugged at the comb, wincing at the pain, hoping his hair was still salvageable. He hated himself with short hair. He needed his long, lucious locks back if he had any hope of seducing his Godson.</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Look, the point – is -” Sirius grimaced, trying not to tug too much at his hair but needing it to become untangled, “-we've been so busy with – ow! - other stuff, it's just not – ow... the right time for a new relationship.”</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">It was Remus' turn to laugh. Sirius didn't address it, continuing to drag the hairbrush through his hair. His successfully detangled hair still looked a mess, but it would do for now. He could probably get away with only trimming an inch or so if his intensive hair care regime didn't help.</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Bill and Fleur,” was all the Werewolf said quietly. Sirius rolled his eyes, growling a little bit in frustration with his hair. When did he let it get so unruly?</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“You and Tonks,” Sirius added, his fight with the hairbrush all but over. He gritted his teeth as he worked through one particularly stubborn knot.</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Was hoping you hadn't forgotten,” Remus said coolly, although a quick glance at the man showed he wasn't really upset. He was smiling slightly, his face still worn-out despite death. Yes, despite the thirteen-year age difference, despite his reservations about Lycanthropy, Remus and Tonks had married. They'd had a son together. All whilst helping the Order to fight off Voldemort, to stall long enough for Harry, Hermione and Ron to finish whatever they were doing.</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“So <em>your</em><span> argument,” Sirius said, shucking his trousers and boxers in one go, ignoring Remus' uncomfortable laugh, “is that other people </span><em>found</em><span> happiness during the War, so we should find happiness </span><em>after</em><span> the War.”</span></p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“<span>Pretty much – God, you haven't changed at all, Padfoot! We're not in Hogwarts anymore!” The Werewolf cried as Sirius stood there completely unrobed. The Animagus grinned, stepping into the shower.</span></p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“<span>Nothing you haven't seen before, Remus,” Sirius said matter-of-factly. He heard Remus give another uncomfortable laugh and leave. He turned on the shower and did his best to ignore his thoughts, although it proved pointless. He'd been a thinker before Azkaban, and after twelve years of that and then another few years in solitude and hiding, he'd only become more brooding. Water rushed down his face, his thoughts tumbling out just as fast.</span></p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">
  <span>Maybe... maybe a relationship with Harry would work. Sirius hadn't been lying when he'd said he wasn't completely against the concept. He'd spent some nights sharing a bed with Harry, the two sleeping beside one another in the aftermath of the War. Nightmares had ensnared them both, and it made sense for someone to be close by to spare the other a restless night. A few weeks later they'd slowly drifted back to their own beds again, but Sirius had woken frequently before Harry, quietly enjoying the cuddles and closeness of him, the pressure of a body squeezed against his own. He'd got wind of Harry's crush on him in fifth year, too, but never acted on it, too hooked on his Firewhiskey and too disheartened by his inability to help the Order. After that it had been smiles exchanged across the table, hopeless flirting (from Harry's side that made Sirius almost laugh out loud more than once), and a brief encounter of being squashed together in the pantry, Harry's eyes hopeful and needy, before Sirius edged his way out, and they never spoke of it. </span>
</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">
  <span>Perhaps Harry would return the affection, needing someone to look after him after years of being self-sufficient. Perhaps Harry would gladly move his things back into Sirius' room, and they'd redecorate the entire house together, matching it to their style and personality. Perhaps Harry would kiss him, hold him, get fucked by him. </span>
</p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">
  <span>Sirius' cock twitched.</span>
