  <p>§§Prologue§§</p>
</center><p>Harry watched as Dumbledore and Voldemort threw a variety of spells at one another and was shocked at how many spells they knew.  It was then Harry realized that he could never defeat Voldemort with his current level of education.  He was far too young and inexperienced to defeat the Dark Lord and he wasn’t trying in school.  He was far too reliant on Hermione to help him complete his school work.  When he lived with the Dursleys, he wasn’t allow to do better in school than Dudley, so Harry had gotten so used to doing the bare minimum; just enough to pass, but not doing as well as he could have.  It seemed as though Harry still had this mentality even though he was no longer with the Dursleys.  Harry didn’t want to do better than Ron at school because he knew how jealous he would be if Harry did better than him.  However, Harry knew he could no longer think like this.  His life was on the line and he needed to know all that he could if he wanted to survive.</p><p>The emerald eyed wizard stood up and approached Dumbledore which forced the old man to take his attention off his opponent for just a split second, but that was all Voldemort needed to disappear for a moment.  The next thing Harry knew was pain.  His head exploded in agony as he felt something horrible coil around his mind and take possession of it.  The young wizard could feel what his body was doing, but he had no control over it.  He felt his mouth moving, but he couldn’t hear what was being said.  All he could hear was the taunting whispers echoing in his mind from the malicious presence.  At that moment, Harry knew he was going to die and his only thought was that he would be reunited with his parents and Sirius.  Harry was filled with love and regret for the loss of his beloved godfather and he honestly couldn’t wait to see him again and tell him how sorry he was that he got the man killed.  The taunting voice stopped and the serpentine presence flinched back at the emotions that fill Harry's mind.  The coils of the presence started to loosen their grip of Harry's mind and he slowly started feeling control of his body returning to him before the presence left him abruptly.</p><p>The young wizard opened his eyes and saw that he was lying on his back with Dumbledore kneeling close by.  However, before he could do anything, a hand gripped his hair harshly and pulled him to his feet.  Harry yelped in pain and moved with the hand, hoping to alleviate some of the pressure and not lose a chunk of his hair.  The burning in his scar told him exactly who was holding him, but he was in too much pain from the possession and the burning in his scar to do anything other than stand there.  The hand gripping his hair pulled his head back slightly so Harry could see what was happening.  Off to the side, Harry could see all his friends as the Order members watching what was happening.  Ron and Hermione looked horrified at Harry's position, but they didn’t move to help him knowing there was nothing they could do.  One of the fireplaces ignited with green flames as Fudge stepped out and released a ridiculous squeak upon seeing the Dark Lord standing there.  His face paled and his mouth moving in an imitation of a fish.  Harry's attention was drawn to Dumbledore as the elder wizard stood and gripped his wand.</p><p>“You lose Old Man!”  Voldemort hissed and wrapped a stick thin arm around the boy’s waist, causing Harry to be pressed against an emaciated chest.  Harry could feel every rib as he was pressed harshly back and the pain in his scar blazed even more with the added contact.  Harry was briefly reminded of his fourth year when Voldemort had placed a finger directly over his scar and how much anguish that had caused him.  The boy’s attention snapped back to the present when he felt the Dark Lord move and then the world felt like it was squeezing in on him.  Emerald eyes watched as Dumbledore raised his want and threw an ice blue spell at them.  The spell struck Voldemort right before the Ministry atrium disappeared from Harry's eyes and the world faded as Harry and the Dark Lord were pulled through a tube.</p>
