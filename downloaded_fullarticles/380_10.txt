  <b>June</b>
</p><p> </p><p>Sirius slams his bedroom door shut and haphazardly begins to throw some clothes and other essentials into his shoulder bag, the sound of his mother screaming his name still echoing in his ears almost as loudly as the slap that caused the pink stinging mark that’s settled onto his right cheek from where the back of her right hand had landed minutes ago. </p><p>He was prepared for it, had known it was coming from the moment James had successfully rigged their summer Muggle Studies project so that the two of them would be paired with Lily. In truth, this also wasn’t the first crisp slap across the face that Sirius had received because of that class. Upon finding out he’d elected to take it the summer previously, Walburga had had one of her notorious moments of irrational rage, so it really was no surprise that she was bound to be absolutely furious at Sirius’s summer assignment to spend one day a week integrated with Muggles. Her rage was made even more palpable due to the fact that this assignment meant he was going to be consorting with a female Muggle-born all summer long. </p><p>“The little harpy is going to try to seduce you,” Walburga had accused, and Sirius had rolled his eyes. Seducing Sirius was the last thing Lily Evans was likely to do. She didn’t even <em> like </em> Sirius, she hated him actually, only slightly less than she hated James, and it’s likely that Lily is just as mad about their summer assignment as Walburga. Sirius knows for a fact that Lily had been hoping to be teamed up with Marlene McKinnon and Dorcas Meadows, whom both ended up with Peter. The only real upside to being grouped with Lily, Sirius thought, was that at least he and James were not with Mary MacDonald. </p><p>Mary was nice enough, albeit a bit annoying, as she was the one who had been spending the better part of their third year trying to seduce Sirius. Like Lily, Mary was a Muggle-born witch, and though it was a breath of fresh air that Mary’s pursuit of Sirius was based solely on his looks instead of his status as the Black family heir, Sirius found that he still has trouble managing to care or find any real interest in her. The coupling that’s happening all around him between girls and boys is proving to be quite vexing to Sirius, no matter how many times James and Peter had tried to tell him he’s missing out. </p><p>Sirius takes one final look around his room to make sure he hasn’t forgotten anything and checks his bag again. Change of clothes, toothbrush, Muggle Studies textbook, ballpoint pen and spiral-bound notebook— the last two items of which Sirius found most amusing. Muggles may not have magic, but at least they’ve figured out something better than quills and unwieldy rolls of parchment. He’d used a fair amount of his pocket money to purchase extras of these things, for both his own use and as a way to put extra galleons into his pocket when he returns to Hogwarts in September— the value of contraband Muggle items is almost <em> twice </em> what they’re worth in the real world.</p><p>“I’m leaving now, Mother,” Sirius calls from in front of the Floo in the library of Grimmauld Place. </p><p>“I expect you back here in time for dinner with the Malfoys on Sunday,” Walburga says, appearing from the other side of the door. “After spending two nights with the Potters, the filthy blood traitors, you’ll need a reminder of how <em> proper </em> Wizarding families behave.”</p><p>Sirius turns his back on his Mother and rolls his eyes as he steps into the Floo, tossing a handful of green powder into the grate. “Potter Manor,” he says clearly and slips down and through the Floo Network, then steps into the Potters’ living room where James is waiting for him with a ridiculous grin on his face.</p><p>“Wotcher Sirius,” he greets, clapping Sirius on the shoulder and causing a plume of soot to rise into the air around them. “Any trouble getting out of the Grim Old Place?”</p><p>Sirius laughs lightly at the pun and shrugs his shoulders. “No more trouble than usual. My mum’s right pissed about this whole Muggle Studies thing, but we knew that.” Sirius pauses and raises an eyebrow at James. “Called Lily a harpy.”</p><p>“My Lily, a harpy?”</p><p>“She’s not <em> your </em> Lily, you git.”</p><p>“Not <em> yet </em>,” James says, emphasis on the ‘yet’. “But you’ll see, she won’t be able to resist my charm this summer.”</p><p>“James, is that Sirius I hear?” Euphemia Potter calls from somewhere within the rather stately home.</p><p>“Yes, Mum,” James yells back.</p><p>“Show him to his room and get back down here for supper.”</p><p>“Yes, Mum,” James yells back again, his grin widening and his eyes wild with excitement.</p><p>Sirius feels his lips pull up at the corners to match James’s expression. The tension he didn’t realize he was holding seeps out of his body. He’s happy to be amongst the Potters’ again— a place that actually feels like something that resembles home.</p><p>_____</p><p><br/>With his eyes half shut, Sirius attempts to blink away the remnants of the best night of sleep he’s had since he and his friends left Hogwarts for the summer holiday a week ago. He shuffles to the curb in front of the Potters’ house with his shoulder bag slung across his chest filled with his notebook and pens, plus a few joke items that James had insisted upon. He was sure that Lily would be entertained by a trick wand and a mediocre display of Filibuster Fireworks despite Sirius’s argument that she wouldn’t, just like James had argued that arriving by a side-along apparition with his mum was far less impressive than taking the Knight Bus to Cokeworth. Sirius did agree with that— taking the bus was far more impressive and mature— but now, standing on the curb at an unnecessarily early hour and idly chewing a slice of peanut butter on toast instead of being able to sleep in and eat a real breakfast prepared by Euphemia, this whole Knight Bus thing is seeming less ideal by the minute. </p><p>“This is rubbish,” Sirius mumbles around a mouthful of sticky peanut butter.</p><p>“Don’t be such a tosser,” James says, irritatingly too chipper for this time of day— not that Sirius is surprised by it. James has always been an early and eager riser, always attempting to pull Sirius out of bed back at school for a bit of flying before breakfast. </p><p>“You’re on your own next time,” Sirius states. “I’m letting your mum apparate me from here on out.”</p><p>“It’s your funeral,” James says smugly and extends his arm, his fist wrapped tightly around his wand. “See how many girls you get when they find out you side-along with your mate’s mum instead of riding the bus like a man.”</p><p>Sirius is about to argue that a man would actually just apparate himself, not take the bus when said bus arrives with a <em> BANG </em> and overly loud <em> HONK-HONK </em>. But, being fourteen, he’s still three years away from that, and right now he’d prefer a proper breakfast after a full night's sleep instead of this bus nonsense to impress a girl. It all seems like a complete waste of time. He steps onto the bus, barely listening to James give their destination and pay the attendant. </p><p>“Here,” James says, handing Sirius a mug of steaming black tea when they find a place to sit down— two armchairs with a table between them that glide back and forth across the floor of the Knight Bus as it moves. The jolt of it causes Sirius to immediately slosh some of the steaming hot liquid onto himself. He sucks in a breath and rises from his seat, flipping James the V in the process.</p><p>“Oh for fuck’s sake Sirius.” James points his wand at the wet stain on Sirius’s trousers. “<em>Tergeo! </em>”</p><p>Sirius settles back into his seat and takes a sip of the still piping hot tea, promptly burning his tongue but happy for the caffeine nevertheless. </p><p>“You’ll see,” James murmurs around the rim of his own teacup. “Once Mary and the other girls hear from Lily that we arrived by Knight Bus they’ll be throwing themselves at your feet. I might even give a few of them a chance. A little jealousy goes a long way when trying to get a girl’s affection.”</p><p>“I’m not sure it works that way, James,” Sirius says, furrowing his brow in thought. In his experience he hasn’t needed the Knight Bus to impress anyone, and jealousy isn’t exactly known for being a positive feeling. He’s also quite sure that Lily would be more than happy to see James’s enthusiastic affection to be aimed toward someone who isn’t her for a change.</p><p>“You’re no expert. That’s for sure,” James quips. “How long has Mary been after you now?”</p><p>“I don’t know. Why are we talking about this?”</p><p>“Because girls are everything— after Quidditch that is,” James says thoughtfully. “Speaking of, are you going to try out for the team this year?”</p><p>“Maybe,” Sirius responds, shrugging his shoulders. He’d made the backup team last year but was never brought in, and found the practice schedule to be a bit exhausting anyway. But, he can see how he might enjoy some of the notoriety that comes with being on the actual team, and they <em> do </em>need a new beater this year.</p><p>“Making the team would be a sure way to get you a girlfriend if you decide not to get with Mary this year,” James rambles on, barely stopping to breathe.</p><p>“Why is it always about girls with you these days?”</p><p>“I’ve already told you. Girls are everything after Quidditch.”</p><p>“Well not to me,” Sirius retorts.</p><p>“Sirius,” James says seriously and lowers his voice, “you <em> are </em>into girls aren’t you? You’re not into blokes or something?”</p><p>“No!” Sirius exclaims. “I just don’t see what the fuss is all about with girls.”</p><p>James narrows his eyes a bit at Sirius, his lips pulled into a lopsided grin. He looks as if he wants to say more, but shrugs his shoulders instead. </p><p>Sirius focuses on drinking his tea and is grateful for the sudden silence that has fallen between the two of them as they endure the remainder of their trip on the Knight Bus, their chairs sliding awkwardly forward and back across the floor. Sirius tells himself that it’s this motion that is creating an uneasiness in his stomach, not James’s suggestion that maybe it’s blokes he’s into instead of girls.</p><p>_____</p><p><br/>Lily has a friendly enough look on her face as the boys arrive at her curb in Cokeworth. Sirius actually thinks she’s happy to see them for a fleeting moment, but that lasts only as long as it takes for James to hold out the trick wand.</p><p>“Here,” James says, extending the wand out to her while he fumbles with his notebook, pen, and a useless bottle of ink that he’s convinced he still needs, not quite understanding how Muggle pens work. </p><p>Lily laughs and rolls her eyes, clearly finding as much amusement as Sirius is at James’s fumbling with the most basic of Muggle objects. “You’re going to be a disaster all summer,” she says and grabs onto the wand, but her laughter ends abruptly when the wand bursts open into a bouquet of oversized lilies, along with a cloud of pollen and a few confused bumble bees buzzing around. She sneezes and then promptly whacks James across the head with it, raining leaves and petals down on him. “You birk!”</p><p>Sirius tries not to laugh at the stunned look on James’s face or the way his hair is heavily dusted in the orange powdery pollen, only made worse when James ruffles his hair and smears it through the dark unruly strands.</p><p>“Let’s just get this over with,” Lily grumbles and leads them inside her home. </p><p>The Evans’ are seated in the living room with the television on and a smartly dressed man on the screen reporting about a strange weather occurrence that hovered over Wimborne— something about a green cloud that had most of the town's residents running for cover.</p><p>“Mum, Dad,” Lily says. “This is Sirius and James.”</p><p>Her parents both rise and eagerly greet them, and her dad vigorously shakes Sirius’s hand as his eyes glisten with excitement over having wizards who were raised with magic in his home. Lily has to stop him from taking over and bombarding the boys with endless questions and Sirius is grateful for it, especially when her father starts inquiring about meeting Sirius and James’s parents. </p><p>James, of course, is more than happy to discuss such things. He’s probably using it as evidence that he can start planning their wedding once the Potters and Evanses have all shaken hands. But the idea of exposing Lily’s parents to Walburga and Orion sits uncomfortably within Sirius’s chest. </p><p>Sirius takes a deep breath and looks around— it’s far different from Grimmauld Place, but not that different from the Potters’ house. It’s warm and friendly inside with light streaming in through the open windows and a cool, early summer breeze moving through the rooms. The most striking changes are the Muggle appliances and gadgets, all of which they have studied in class and he’s seen in his textbook. </p><p>Lily shows them into the kitchen and explains how to use the microwave by heating a plate of leftovers for them to share. James argues it’s less effective than a warming charm, and Lily has to remind him that Muggles don’t have warming charms, causing James to blush in embarrassment and Lily to again laugh at his fumbling as she offers them tea made the Muggle way. The tea takes far longer to prepare than either James or Sirius are used to, but Lily doesn’t seem bothered by the length of time, and Sirius thinks that this must explain some of her patience back at school. </p><p>Since starting at Hogwarts, Sirius has always found the Muggle-born students’ excitement at food magically appearing on the table and things like tea and coffee always being instant and at a constant temperature to be most entertaining. But now he thinks he understands why. If they’ve been waiting around for a cup of tea for twenty minutes from start to finish for their entire lives, it’s no wonder the instant arrival is always such a marvel. However, as he takes his first sip of tea made the Muggle way, the flavours full and fragrant, he thinks maybe the speed of magic isn’t always the best way. </p><p>“Are you going to show us your bedroom next,” James asks hopefully, his mouth full of the shepherd’s pie that Lily had heated for them. </p><p>Sirius cringes at the sight and wonders how it is that James doesn’t realize how truly appalling of a sight it is and that he’s never going to get Lily to want to be anywhere near him if he keeps this up. Furthermore, he’s also pretty sure Mrs. Potter would have his hide if she’d witnessed it personally. He’s about to tell James to shut his maw when Lily does it for him.</p><p>“Godric no!” Lily exclaims. “And chew with your mouth closed. I thought you pureblood boys were supposed to have manners.”</p><p>Sirius laughs at this and jokes, “James must have been absent the day we went over pureblood manners.” Lily smiles at Sirius’s joke and James kicks him under the table, causing Sirius to suck in a breath. “What was that for?”</p><p>“You know for what!” James snaps, his jaw clenched and jutting slightly out towards Lily.</p><p>“Oh for goodness sake Potter, it was just a joke,” Lily says, then mumbles something about this being a long summer.</p><p>Sirius internally agrees with her. If he has to spend one day a week for his entire summer watching James continually fail at wooing Lily, it’s going to be a very long three months. He tries to lighten the mood. “So, what’s next?”</p><p>“Well, I was thinking that we could watch a little telly. I don’t think either of you has one of those, and then maybe we can even try to make a few phone calls,” Lily suggests.</p><p>James visibly brightens at this suggestion. “Will you show us that What Doctor you, Mary, and Peter are always going on about?”</p><p>“Doctor Who,” Lily laughs.</p><p>“Oh, you know the one!” James says indignantly.</p><p>“No, you idiot,” Sirius says. “Doctor Who is the name of the show.”</p><p>“Like you know,” James argues and swats Sirius on the shoulder. “You’ve got less Muggle experience than I have.”</p><p>“I think you’re both pretty hopeless,” Lily teases, getting up from the table and placing their empty teacups and plates into the sink.</p><p>“Is there a special microwave to clean those?” James asks.</p><p>“No,” Lily laughs again, clearly amused at James’s complete ignorance of non-magical life. “We do these by hand. Would you like a try?”</p><p>“Would I ever!” James exclaims and promptly bounds to the sink. “Come on Sirius, let's do the dishes, the Muggle way!”</p><p>The Muggle way, as it turns out, is a lot wetter than Sirius would have imagined, or maybe that was just due to James’s enthusiasm to use the sprayer. By the time the dishes are done, Sirius’s shirt is clinging to his torso and his eyes are burning from the soap bubbles that James had splashed into them. </p><p>His eyes are so red and irritated he can hardly see the telly when the three of them finally settle in to watch Doctor Who, but even without his sight he can see the appeal, and judging from James’s hyperactive energy it’s clear that he is enjoying it as well— although that could just be his excitement about being able to share a couch with Lily and her not being able to hex him for his close proximity.</p><p>Three episodes and four phone calls later— one to Peter who was with Marlene and Dorcas, one to Mary, and two to a local bakery (the first making Lily snatch the phone away from James when he tried putting in an order for cauldron cakes instead of cupcakes— she had to immediately call them back and place a proper order, apologizing for the mistake of the previous caller), she then insisted that James gives her money for the cupcakes.</p><p>Thankfully Sirius has regained his eyesight once they’re ready to stick out their wands and return to Potter Manor. The thought of riding on the chaotic Knight Bus sans one of his five major senses was not something he wanted to experience, no matter how adventurous he tended to be. </p><p>“See you next week!” James exclaims like an over-eager puppy.</p><p>Lily genuinely smiles at the two of them. “Alright, see you next week.”</p><p>Sirius extends out his fist, wand in hand, eager to get back to the Potters’ for one more night before he has to return to the stifling nature of his own home. The Knight Bus appears with its usual <em> BANG </em> and <em> HONK-HONK </em>drowned out by the sound of the Filibuster Fireworks that James had insisted on exploding around them. Sirius turns and looks just in time to see Lily’s face fall in horror as her neighbors begin to look out of their front doors at whatever it is that is making all this noise.</p><p>Nearly all of them are looking up at the sky except for a tawny-haired boy who looks to be about Sirius’s age across the street. He’s staring at the Knight Bus, something Muggles shouldn’t be able to see. </p><p>Sirius can’t take his eyes off of the boy. There’s something serene and almost ethereal about him. Without looking away, Sirius grabs ahold of Lily’s forearm.</p><p>“What Sirius?” she snaps.</p><p>“Who’s that?” he asks, his other hand pointing across the street.</p><p>“That’s just Remus,” she says. “My neighbor.”</p><p>____</p><p> </p><p>Sirius tosses and turns in his bed at the Potters’ all night, the image of the boy across the street imprinted behind his closed eyelids. By all logic, there was no reason as to why he would have been able to see the Knight Bus, yet he clearly could. And unlike the rest of the residents in that particular corner of Cokeworth, he seemed completely unfazed by the spectacle of the Filibuster Fireworks— one that James is currently regretting, as it not only infuriated Lily but also drew the attention of the Ministry which issued a stern warning about public displays of magic in a Muggle neighborhood. Subsequently, Euphemia and Fleamont Potter had decided that the Knight Bus is no longer an option for the boys to travel by. James was thoroughly disappointed; Sirius doesn’t care either way. </p><p>All Sirius cares about is finding out why the boy across the street was able to see what he did. Lily never mentioned a wizarding family that lived nearby and Sirius knows for sure he’s never seen this boy at Hogwarts— he definitely would’ve remembered him. Sirius knew Severus Snape lived close, but this boy was clearly not a member of that family. This boy was golden and warm, and something about him pulled at Sirius’s insides. </p><p>Sirius had briefly locked eyes with the boy after he took his seat on the bus in the split second before it disapparated away. The shy smile that crept across the boy's face before he ducked his head and turned back inside his home, was one of the best and most confusing things that Sirius has ever seen. </p><p>He turns again in his bed and grabs one of the many extra pillows to hold close to his chest and releases a sigh. For the most part, Sirius has been feeling relatively indifferent towards this summer Muggle Studies project. Though he likes that it affords him time away from Grimmauld Place and he loves staying with the Potters, watching James fumble all summer around Lily is likely to get old. He’d already been annoyed with it today. </p><p>But now, Sirius is feeling a shift in his focus and he suddenly feels impatient for next Saturday to arrive, eager to learn more about the boy across the street. James, of course, said that Sirius was imagining things, that there was no way that the boy saw the Knight Bus, and Sirius was just being delusional. </p><p>Flipping over again, his heart beating faster than it should for the middle of the night, Sirius decides he can’t wait until Saturday to find out more. He throws the covers off of himself and walks to the desk under the window in the bedroom. He pulls out his notebook and pen and begins to write Lily a letter— surely she knows more about this Remus other than him just being her neighbor.</p><p><em>Lily—<br/></em> <em>Is Remus a wizard?<br/></em> <em>Sirius</em></p><p>After tearing the piece of paper out of the spiral-bound notebook, Sirius folds it up and opens the window. He brings two fingers to his mouth and whistles, beckoning one of the Potters’ many post owls to him. A large brown barn owl swoops to him and Sirius attaches the letter to its foot. “Lily Evans,” he directs and watches as the owl silently flies off above the trees.</p><p>Sirius climbs back into bed and throws the blanket back over himself, leaving the window open to let in a cool breeze. With his letter sent and hopefully answers about the mysterious boy to come tomorrow, he finally feels like maybe he can get some rest. Hugging a pillow close to his chest again, Sirius closes his eyes, the image of Remus and his shy smile being the last thing that he thinks of before sleep overtakes him. </p><p>When Sirius wakes up in the morning, it’s to the weight of the same owl he’d sent to Lily standing on the pillow he is clinging to. The bird’s head is cocked to the side and its foot is extended at Sirius’s face, almost brushing his nose. Sirius sits up startled and checks the clock on the wall— it’s not even 6 am. The owl flutters its wings and hoots indignantly at Sirius, kicking its leg pointedly, the familiar spiral notebook paper still attached.</p><p>“I said take it to Lily Evans,” Sirius grumbles.</p><p>The bird hoots and kicks its foot again.</p><p>“Alright, alright,” Sirius says and removes the paper. Relieved from its burden, the owl takes off from the pillow, leaving a dusting of feathers behind as it soars out of the window. Sirius is about to toss the paper out, convinced that the bird was unable to deliver when he catches sight of a loopy unfamiliar scrawl between the lines. His eyes open wide in excitement. Lily has answered him quickly. She must know something more.</p><p><em>Sirius—<br/></em> <em>As much as I love getting post, I prefer to get it when the sun is shining. And since you woke me up with a single question, I told this bird to make sure it wakes you promptly as well. Remus is just Remus. He’s not a wizard. Other than being a bit sickly, he’s just a regular boy. Now kindly leave me alone until next Saturday, when you arrive by any means other than the Knight Bus.<br/></em> <em>Lily</em></p><p>Sirius puts the letter down, purses his lips, and furrows his brow. What did she mean by <em> sickly </em>? He gets out of bed and writes a reply, not caring that she wanted to be left alone until they were forced to see each other again next Saturday.</p><p><em>Lily—<br/></em> <em>What do you mean by sickly? <br/></em> <em>Sirius</em></p><p>He whistles for an owl and the same one returns looking a bit judgemental, if that’s a look a bird can even give. He ties the letter to its leg. “Don’t look at me like that,” he scolds the bird. “Just take this back to Lily Evans.”</p><p>The owl doesn’t return until Sirius is about to Floo back to Grimmauld Place with just enough time for him to change into dress robes for dinner with the Malfoys. The bird hoots, stopping Sirius as he’s about to step into the green flames. It flies to the mantel and extends its leg, Sirius hastily removes the letter, and waves goodbye to the Potters one more time. With the letter in hand, Sirius steps into the flames. “Twelve Grimmauld Place!”</p><p>His mother is waiting for him when he arrives in the hearth in the library with a stern expression on her face. “Get upstairs and get changed!” she roars, pointing her finger out the library doors. </p><p>Sirius scurries past her and runs up to his bedroom, skipping every other step along the way. He shuts his door and unrolls the paper. </p><p><em>Sirius—<br/></em> <em>I don’t know! He’s just sickly. Some unexplained illness that keeps him from going to school. Honestly, he keeps it to himself. Now kindly bugger off until Saturday. <br/></em> <em>Lily</em></p><p>Sirius sighs and folds the letter up, sliding it into his pocket and feeling an ache for the other boy tugging at him from somewhere within his rib cage. </p><p>_____</p><p> </p><p>For the first time in their friendship, Sirius is the first to wake on Saturday morning. He practically sprints into James’s bedroom and leaps onto his bed with the nonexistent grace of an erumpet, landing on top of James and crashing their heads together. </p><p>“Wake up, James,” Sirius says, rubbing his palm into the back of his head where it had collided with the front of James’s. </p><p>“Oi!” James exclaims, his eyes screwed shut, one hand reaching for his glasses, the other rubbing at his forehead. There’s already a bruise and a giant fwooper egg growing above his right eyebrow. “I was dreaming about Lily, you wanker.”</p><p>“Get up, you actually get to go <em> see </em>Lily today.” Sirius whacks James with a pillow just as he’s placing his glasses on, effectively knocking them askew. </p><p>“Lily!” James says, his eyes comically widening in his sudden excitement. He throws the blankets off of himself, covering Sirius in the process and springs to his feet beside the bed. “Wait,” he says as Sirius clambers out from under the blanket. “Why are <em> you </em>so excited? You don’t have a thing for my Lily, do you?”</p><p>“No, you tosser.”</p><p>“Then why are you so excited?”</p><p>“I’m not excited,” Sirius denies while running his hands through his hair, smoothing it back and securing it into a bit of a knot with a black elastic at the back of his head.</p><p>“Then why did you come bounding into my room at the arse crack of dawn?” James scolds, rubbing his forehead and wincing at his own touch. “You better hope my mother can fix this.”</p><p>Sirius rolls his eyes. Of course Mrs. Potter can fix it— she’s the best at healing charms and much more gentle than Madam Pomfrey back at Hogwarts, in Sirius’s opinion. “You’ll live. Now hurry up.”</p><p>“This is about the bloke across the street from Lily, isn’t it?”</p><p>“No,” Sirius denies again. “But you have to admit, it’s a bit strange that he saw the Knight Bus.”</p><p>“For the one-millionth time, there’s no way he saw it,” James says emphatically, but Sirius knows what he saw. </p><p>After an indulgent breakfast of waffles stacked high and covered in fruit and fresh whipped cream, Euphemia Potter grabs ahold of James and Sirius and apparates them to Cokeworth, leaving them with a stern reminder to keep to the statute of secrecy while they are amongst the Muggles, the last thing she says before disapparating back to Potter Manor with a promise that Mr. Potter will come to grab them later.</p><p>“So what are we doing today?” James asks Lily once his mother has disappeared.</p><p>“I thought we could go for a walk around town,” Lily suggests. “I can show you two the bakery and a few shops. You did bring some Muggle money with you, right?”</p><p>James reaches into his pocket and produces an assortment of notes of varying denominations. Neither Sirius nor James has really managed to get a grasp on how Muggle money works, though Sirius does enjoy that the paper notes don’t jangle and weigh his pocket down like galleons, knuts, and sickles do. </p><p>Sirius is only half paying attention to what Lily and James are saying. He’s looking past James’s shoulder at the house across the street where the boy who lives there is gingerly walking towards the slightly battered car parked in the driveway with what looks to be his mother— they share the same tawny-coloured curls and golden skin that is likely dusted in freckles by the summer sun. </p><p>The boy opens the car door and looks right at Sirius as he’s about to get inside. He raises his hand and gives Sirius the smallest of waves before ducking into the passenger seat. Sirius waves back, a smile and a bit of a blush embarrassingly spreading across his cheeks.</p><p>“Who are you waving at?” James says and turns to look over his shoulder. When he turns back around he has a teasing look on his face. “Oi, Sirius. It’s your boyfriend.”</p><p>“He’s not my boyfriend,” Sirius retorts.</p><p>James holds his hands up in mock defense. “No need to get your knickers in a twist.”</p><p>Sirius lets out a huff and turns to look at Lily. She’s staring at him quizzically, one red eyebrow raised as if she knows something he does not. “What?”</p><p>“Nothing,” she says. “Let’s just walk to town. It’s not far.”</p><p>Sirius remains relatively silent as they walk, his mind continuously wandering back to the boy across the street even as he watches James try and fail to get Lily’s attention in more and more outlandish ways. His efforts are surprisingly even more annoying without magic to help him. </p><p>At the bakery, Lily orders muffins and tea for the three of them and James insists on paying, handing the woman at the counter his entire stack of banknotes with an excited and wholly innocent grin on his face. The woman eyes James suspiciously and carefully takes what she needs from the pile, then hands it back to him.</p><p>“He’s not from around here,” Lily says quickly and tugs James away from the counter, pulling him out the door and leaving Sirius to figure out how to carry their treats outside.</p><p>“Need some help?” an unfamiliar, yet enticingly pleasant voice says from behind Sirius. </p><p>He turns around not knowing what to expect and finds himself standing less than an arm's length away from the boy across the street. Standing this close, Sirius can take in all the details of him. He’s shorter than Sirius and slighter in frame, his tawny curls appear soft to the touch and his eyes are golden to match the lighter streaks that the sun has put into his hair. His skin is creamy and warm with a sprinkling of sun-kissed freckles that Sirius had somehow already figured would be there. It’s the scar across the bridge of the boy’s nose that takes Sirius by surprise— he wants to know where it came from and wonders if it has anything to do with how Lily said the boy was sickly.</p><p>“Yes, please,” Sirius finally responds, shaking his head slightly as if trying to wake himself from a dream. </p><p>“You’re a friend of Lily’s,” the boy says, grabbing two of the paper cups of tea from Sirius’s hands. </p><p>Sirius nods his head vigorously, suddenly finding his words hard to come by.</p><p>“I’m Remus, by the way,” the boy says with a polite and pleasant smile on his face.</p><p>“Sirius.”</p><p>“Why wouldn't I be serious about my own name?” the boy asks. </p><p>“No, that’s my name.”</p><p>“Your name is Remus too?”</p><p>“No, my name is Sirius,” Sirius explains. “Like the star.”</p><p>Remus looks at him a bit confused. “I’m not sure many people realize there’s a star named Sirius.”</p><p>“They don’t?” Sirius questions. In truth, it’s never really occurred to him that <em> Sirius </em>isn’t something that anyone wouldn’t be familiar with. After all, his entire family is named after stars, galaxies, and other cosmic happenings, so it all seems normal to him. </p><p>“No, Sirius, they don’t,” Remus teases and laughs shyly, the sound of which causes an unfamiliar fluttering to occur inside Sirius’s chest.</p><p>“I’ve never come across another Remus, you know,” Sirius nervously tries to joke.</p><p>Remus laughs a little harder at this, taking the shyness out of it. “I don’t imagine that you would’ve.”</p><p>“Sirius!” Lily interrupts, poking her head in through the bakery door. She looks completely annoyed with him, but her features soften when she sees Remus standing beside Sirius. “Oh, hi Remus,” she says a bit surprised. “Would you like to join us?”</p><p>“I’m not sure if I can,” he says and looks towards where his mother is waiting in their car out front. “I’m supposed to go see a heal... er, a doctor today.”</p><p>Sirius looks at Remus curiously, having heard the slip of his tongue. He might not know much about Muggles, but he knows they don’t see healers. Lily doesn’t seem to have caught the slip and asks, “Are you sick again?”</p><p>“No,” Remus says. “Just someone my father wants me to see.”</p><p>“You can join us later if you want,” Sirius suggests hopefully.</p><p>“I’m not sure if I can,” Remus says again, this time more sadly. “Here.” He hands Lily the two paper cups of tea now that she’s standing with them. “I need to grab my mum’s order and go.”</p><p>“See you around, Remus,” Lily says.</p><p>Remus nods at her and turns around to order with the woman at the counter.</p><p>“Come on, Sirius,” Lily sighs. “I don’t trust James out there by himself.”</p><p>Sirius keeps his eye on Remus and thinks he sees him chuckle a bit to himself at the jibe Lily made at James’s expense. Why would he find it so funny if he wasn’t a wizard, Sirius thinks, further confirming his suspicion that there is more to Remus than Lily realizes.</p><p>“Sirius! Let’s go!” she demands from the door.</p><p>“I’m coming,” Sirius says and glares at her. Lily annoyingly raises her eyebrow at him again. He attempts to ignore it and how her look unsettles his stomach. He follows her out the door, stopping and turning at the last second to say, “See you around Remus.”</p><p>They don’t see Remus again until later in the afternoon when James and Sirius are waiting with Lily for Mr. Potter to arrive to apparate the boys back to Potter Manor. Remus and his mother pull into their driveway and Sirius watches what looks to be Remus’s father come outside and help Remus out of the car, as if he can’t do it himself.</p><p>“Remus!” Sirius yells from across the street, his hand held up high. “Come over!”</p><p>A tired smile works its way onto Remus’s face, and for the first time Sirius sees what Lily meant about Remus being sickly. He was fine earlier. The healer or doctor, whichever it was that Remus had been taken to, must not have been a very good one, Sirius thinks. </p><p>Remus waves back, but instantly brings his hand down when Sirius notices his father give him a stern look. Sirius can just make out the words on Remus’s lips as he apologizes to his father for something Sirius doesn’t understand.</p><p>“Hey boys,” Mr. Potter says, breaking Sirius from his thoughts as he appears seemingly from nowhere, and then shocking Sirius even more when he shouts across the street, “Lyall Lupin! I haven’t seen you in ages.”</p><p>Sirius, James, and Lily all whip around in shock to look at Mr. Potter, watching him casually cross the street to shake hands with Remus’s father, who has gone pale and looks to be the sick one.</p><p>“Come on boys,” Mr. Potter encourages, hailing them over. “Here’s someone I’d like you to meet.”</p><p>Practically running over, his thoughts and suspicions about Remus being a wizard confirmed in this instant, Sirius can barely contain his excitement. Why else would Mr. Potter know who Remus’s father was if he wasn’t in fact a wizard? After all, Mr. Potter has no cause to ever have dealings with Muggles outside of regular, mundane encounters. </p><p>“It’s so good to see you, Lyall,” Mr. Potter says jovially, shaking the man's hand. “I didn’t realize you were living in Cokeworth.” He takes his gaze to Remus’s mother, “Hope, it’s good to see you, looking as lovely as ever.” Sirius looks at Remus’s mum, getting a good look at her for the first time. She looks friendly and warm, but her features are drawn and tired, and Sirius wonders if whatever sickness it is that Remus has is a family disease. “And this must be Remus,” Mr. Potter continues. “Why I haven’t seen you since you were just a boy, before…”</p><p>“What are you doing here Fleamont?” Mr. Lupin interrupts, sounding completely put out by Mr. Potter’s arrival.</p><p>Mr. Potter doesn’t seem to notice, or at the very least care about Mr. Lupin’s annoyance. “I’m picking up the boys,” he says, gesturing in James and Sirius’s direction. “You remember James, he was born shortly after your boy.” James sticks his hand out and Lyall hesitantly shakes it. “And this is his friend, Sirius Black.”</p><p>Sirius extends his hand and doesn’t miss the way Lyall Lupin’s eyes widen in curiosity as he takes Sirius in when he shakes his hand. </p><p>“The boys will be here every Saturday for the summer,” Mr. Potter begins to explain, he seems to be the only one with any words at the moment. “I know Euphemia would love to see you both and how great for Remus that he can be around the boys. They’re all the same age— I’m sure they’ll get along wonderfully.”</p><p>Sirius looks at Remus and smiles at Mr. Potter’s suggestion. Spending the summer getting to know Remus is exactly the thing he’d like to do, and judging by the twinge of excitement that flits through Remus’s eyes, he might be thinking or feeling the same way.</p><p>“Er, yes,” Mr. Lupin says nervously. “Maybe the boys can spend a little time together.”</p><p>“Wonderful!” Mr. Potter exclaims. “Next week when I drop them off I’ll swing by with Euphemia. We’ll bring breakfast.”</p><p>“No!” Mr. Lupin shouts emphatically. Sirius watches Remus’s expression fall and the color drain from his cheeks. “Next week is not good.”</p><p>“Oh, right,” Mr. Potter says, his tone apologetic and almost a bit embarrassed. “The following week then.”</p><p>“Alright,” Mr. Lupin concedes and places a protective arm around Remus’s shoulders. “That should be fine.”</p><p>_____</p><p> </p><p>Mr. Potter didn’t give Sirius and James any time to ask the myriad of questions that they (well, Sirius mostly) had in regards to the Lupins before he ushered them off, telling them to get cleaned up for dinner. The only thing said on the matter was that Mr. Potter wished for the two boys to be kind to Remus— a request that Sirius had already vowed to do before it was even suggested.</p><p>Now that Sirius had full confirmation that he had been right and that Remus was indeed a wizard, the concept of being able to befriend the boy was much more tangible. However, this confirmation did bring with it a whole new set of questions. Mainly, if Remus was a wizard, why was he not attending Hogwarts? And why did it appear as if they were hiding? Or at least hiding <em> something </em>? </p><p>Sirius contemplates these questions as he towel dries his hair, not wanting to ask Euphemia to perform a drying charm as it tends to make his hair staticky and a bit unruly. And just like it had been the Saturday before, Sirius finds himself anxious for answers to his questions regarding Remus now. He throws on some clean clothes, not caring that his hair is still dripping onto his shoulders, and leaves the guest room that’s been deemed his for the weekends this summer to go talk to Mr. Potter. </p><p>As he descends the stairs, he can hear the Potters talking in hushed voices over the sounds of Euphemia preparing dinner. Something in the way that they are speaking stops Sirius from barging in on them. Instead, he sits down on a middle step that aligns his ear with a heating vent that leads from one room to the next, amplifying their voices just enough for Sirius to hear them clearly.</p><p>“Lyall Lupin, of all people to run into,” Euphemia sighs. </p><p>“It was quite surprising,” Fleamont says. </p><p>“I’m sure. I mean, I understand why they left the Wizarding World after… everything. But to find them in Cokeworth?”</p><p>“Lyall must have been mortified when he realized there was a witch across the street. All that effort into hiding Remus, just to have the Wizarding World delivered to his front lawn again.”</p><p>“Was he at least happy to see you?”</p><p>“Who knows. He seemed a bit nervous and reluctant to accept my offer for breakfast. Which, by the way, you and I are providing in two weeks when we drop off the boys.”</p><p>“Why not next week?” </p><p>“You know why,” he says pointedly, and Sirius leans his ear all the way against the metal grate.</p><p>Euphemia sighs again, “Oh, right. It really is such a shame what happened to that boy. How did he seem? What does he look like?”</p><p>“Other than a scar across his face and being a bit frail, he seemed fine, just a normal boy. Smaller than James and Sirius, but Lyall was never a large man. Mostly Remus just appeared to be a bit sad. Lonely, perhaps.”</p><p>“Well, I would assume so,” Euphemia says exasperatedly. “Could you imagine how James would be if we kept him hidden from the world?”</p><p>“It’s something I don’t even want to think about,” Fleamont says, his tone sad and contemplative. He pauses, then adds, “He reminded me a bit of how Sirius can be sometimes.”</p><p>“How so?” Euphemia asks, and if Sirius could, he’d crawl through the heating duct and listen more intently. He’d never wanted to be able to use magic more in his life, desperately wishing he could use the amplifying charm they’d studied with Flitwick back in May.</p><p>“He was quiet, a bit nervous, and looked like he was waiting for someone to pull the rug out from underneath him.”</p><p>Sirius feels his stomach drop. He hadn’t realized that he had been anything other than cheerful and happy around the Potters. Keeping up an <em> everything is fine </em> facade has been one of the skills that Sirius has always been proud of, working diligently to always convince those around him that life at Grimmauld Place was as charmed as everyone assumed existence for the Black heir would be. Even more disconcerting is the thought that what he experienced at home could be going on with Remus as well. Suddenly, he feels anger and indignation rise up inside him on the other boy’s behalf.</p><p>“You don’t think the Lupins are like the Blacks, do you?” Euphemia asks.</p><p>“Of course not,” Fleamont clarifies. “I just mean that Remus seemed guarded and lonely. Hopefully James has the empathy to recognize it in this boy as well. Sirius seemed to take a shine to him.”</p><p>“Really?” </p><p>“Yes. It was quite sweet actually.”</p><p>“Let’s just hope that the boys can remain that way if they ever truly find out about Remus.”</p><p>“I think they can,” Fleamont says with confidence. “Despite what the books and laws tell you, being a—”</p><p>
  <em>THUNK!</em>
</p><p>Something large hits Sirius square in the back of his head, right on the spot that Sirius had collided with James’s head earlier that morning.</p><p>Sirius whips around quickly to see James catching a quaffle in his hands, a mischievous grin spreading across his lips that floods Sirius with a flash of anger. He rises to his feet and tackles James on the top step, sending them both careening down the stairs in a rolling heap of limbs. “You fucking wanker!”</p><p>James laughs as they tumble. “What’s got you all worked up?”</p><p>Sirius pushes off James when they crash and come to a halt in the foyer. “I was in the middle of something.”</p><p>“Yeah, snooping on the stairs from what I could see. What were you listening to?”</p><p>“Nothing,” Sirius snaps. “Just drop it.” </p><p>“You’re sure not acting like it was nothing.” James smirks and tosses the quaffle back to Sirius. Sirius manages to catch it this time and whips it back at James with the force of his anger behind it. James’s eyes widen when he catches it and his lips press together, confusion playing across his face. “What is it that you heard?”</p><p>“James. Sirius.” Euphemia pokes her head out of the kitchen and looks towards them. “Quit playing. Dinner’s ready in the kitchen.”</p><p>Sirius swallows, nods his head, and plasters a smile on his face, brushing past James and Mrs. Potter to take his seat at the table. His mind is only on Remus and everything that he’d heard the Potters say about him, and all of it causes an intense ache in his chest that he’s never felt for anyone else before. </p><p>_____</p><p> </p><p>That ache in his chest follows Sirius back to Grimmauld Place when he returns the next day. It’s become such a fixture within him since the moment he saw Remus the first time that Sirius is steadily growing sure that it is just becoming a permanent part of him now. Having never felt anything like this towards anything, Sirius isn’t quite sure what to do with this feeling. Confusing him even more is that this ache can flip-flop on a knut and go from being pleasant, heartwarming, and happy to hollow, worrisome, and lonely, all of it culminating into a sense of longing that, if he’s being honest with himself, scares the dress robes that he’s supposed to wear while wandering the darkened halls of his home right off of him.  </p><p>Not that it feels like a home. Grimmauld Place hasn’t felt like home since he first left for Hogwarts almost four years prior. And now that he’s been spending so much time at the Potters’, he hates being back within these dark grey and green walls that much more, always tip-toeing around in an attempt to be as silent as a thestral.</p><p>Sirius steps back into his bedroom after having climbed the three flights of stairs and diligently avoiding the creaky ones, not wanting to remind his mother that he is even here. He just hopes the bruise on his cheek fades before the weekend rolls around. Judging from what he overheard, the Potters aren’t going to buy that he tripped and fell again.</p><p>With the door shut, Sirius lets out a long, slow breath. Normally in these moments, he thinks of life at the Potters’ house— running around and making copious amounts of noise with James, eating Euphemia’s expertly prepared spreads of food, and listening to Fleamont always supplying a joke or antidote for anything and everything. However, this week those thoughts have quickly shifted to Remus Lupin. </p><p>Something about the way Mr. Potter said that Remus reminded him a bit of Sirius has him thinking, and that thinking has absolutely nothing to do with the ever present dull ache he’s been feeling in his chest. He wonders if Remus feels as lonely and out of place in his home as Sirius feels in his. </p><p>Whether he’s hiding in his room or trying to stealthily move through the halls of Grimmauld Place, he never feels truly at ease here. At times, he feels like a ghost of himself— an empty, only half formed Sirius Black. At Hogwarts, or even just at the Potters’, he’s bright and enigmatic, full of energy and confidence, even a little devil may care. But at home, he retreats into himself— he has to if he wants to survive in this place. </p><p>James has never been able to understand this— not that Sirius has ever really tried to explain it to him outside of small hints and the occasional too-close-to-the-truth joke, both of which always fly right over James’s head. A part of Sirius is grateful for that. He can relax; James doesn’t treat him with the care one gives occamy eggshells. But another part of Sirius wishes James just naturally understood. </p><p>The more time alone Sirius spends in his room, only ever being briefly checked in on by his brother or told to come down to dinner, Sirius wishes more and more that he was able to talk to Remus. No longer wanting to wait until Saturday to speak to the other boy again, Sirius in his loneliness and frustration suddenly remembers that Remus is, in fact, a wizard— and wizards have owls, so Sirius sits to write Remus a letter in hopes of starting communication with him. </p><p><em>Remus—<br/></em> <em>I hope this doesn’t seem odd. I mean, I know it’s odd, we’ve only just met, but you seem a decent bloke, so I thought I’d say hello. James and I will be back in Cokeworth on Saturday. We’re doing a summer project with Lily Evans. Would you like to join us? I know you don’t go to Hogwarts, (why is that by the way?), but we’re working on Muggle Studies with her. Do you study that too? </em></p><p><em>Write back! Hope to see you Saturday!<br/></em> <em>Sirius Black</em></p><p>Sirius rereads the letter, crumples it up and curses himself for sounding like an idiot, then smooths it out and rereads again. He doesn’t know what else to say or how else to say it, he just knows he wants to read a reply. He wants Remus Lupin to want to talk to him. </p><p>With the letter folded properly this time, Sirius pushes open his window and whistles for a bird, his eyes on the aviary in the center of the courtyard below. One of the many black and grey speckled owls silently soars to the window and Sirius wastes no time attaching the letter to the birds outstretched leg. </p><p>“Take this to Remus Lupin in Cokeworth,” Sirius directs. “And stick around for a reply in case he doesn’t have his own owl.” The owl hoots softly at Sirius, then just as silently as it had arrived, it takes off again, flying high over the rooftops of London. </p><p>Sirius leaves the window open even though it’ll be hours before he receives a reply, if he gets one at all. He’d hoped sending the letter would make him feel better, but instead a new sensation has crept into the space inside his chest to join the ache. He’s nervous— nervous like he’s been only one other time before, when the sorting hat yelled Gryffindor instead of Slytherin. </p><p>The hat had given him a choice with a vague warning that, at the time, made no sense to Sirius. It still doesn’t, but the hat’s words have been winding their way through his mind as of late. </p><p>
  <em>“You’re cunning and ambitious, like all Slytherins are, but I see you’re also courageous and loyal enough to be a true Gryffindor. In Slytherin, you’ll find yourself surrounded by what’s familiar; in Gryffindor nothing will be the same. In Slytherin you will have security that will last a lifetime, but in Gryffindor you’ll be given the opportunity to let your heart and true self be free.” </em>
</p><p>If you’d asked him then why he’d chosen Gryffindor, he’d tell you it was because of the impression a certain messy haired boy in glasses had made on him on the train. But now, looking back, he can admit it was the opportunity to let his heart and true self be free— something he is finally feeling like he might be on the precipice of discovering, even if that precipice is proving to be a bit disorientating. </p><p>When the black and grey speckled owl returns the next day, Sirius’s heart leaps into his throat when it appears with a soft hoot on his windowsill. Sirius rushes to remove the letter and hands the bird twice the treats he normally would, which is still more than anyone else in the house does. </p><p><em>Sirius—<br/></em> <em>I’m so pleased to have gotten your letter as I’ve never received owl post before, nor have I had an owl watch me write a letter. He was most eager to bring back my reply. Be sure to thank him for me. </em></p><p>
  <em>Unfortunately, this Saturday I will not be able to join you. The following week will be better. And since you’re working on Muggle Studies I might be able to help you. My mum’s a Muggle and we do most things the Muggle way at home. </em>
</p><p><em>What’s Hogwarts like? I’d love to have gone, but I never received my letter.<br/></em> <em>Remus</em></p><p>Reading Remus’s reply, Sirius’s feels both better and worse. He’s calmed by Remus’s lack of hesitation to write back, anxious to write his own reply, happy that he’d been the first person to ever send Remus an owl, which conversely makes him sad that no one else has ever bothered. He’s also excited that Remus would like to see him and even help with his Muggle Studies, but disappointed he has to wait another week. The prospect of waiting sets Sirius’s features into a pout that he internally scolds himself for. </p><p>He shouldn’t have been surprised that Remus couldn’t join them this Saturday— Mr. Potter had said something to that effect the other day when Sirius was listening in on him. But he’d never actually heard an explanation, seeing as how James had hit him with a quaffle at the moment one was given. Sirius’s pout turns into a scowl and he sets his pen to paper to write Remus again. </p><p><em>Remus—<br/></em> <em>Hogwarts is incredible! I’ll tell you all about it when I get to see you again. Why didn’t you receive your letter? Hogwarts is supposed to accept everyone with magic. Is it because you’re sick? I’m sorry if that’s bold of me to ask. It’s just, Lily had mentioned it and you said you were seeing a healer. Well actually, you said doctor, but I caught the slip before you corrected yourself. You don’t have to answer that. Only if you want to, I mean. Write back regardless! I like writing to you. <br/></em> <em>Sirius</em></p><p>Just like before, Sirius finds himself holding a reply from Remus rather quickly. </p><p><em>Sirius—<br/></em> <em>My father says I’m not to talk about why I never received my Hogwarts letter, but since you already guessed, it is because I am sick, if you can call it that. But I’m really only affected a few days a month, otherwise I’m mostly fine and it isn’t a problem. </em></p><p><em>I’m looking forward to seeing you again, and please continue to write, as I enjoy it as well. <br/></em> <em>Remus</em></p><p>Sirius lets his eyes rake over the letter multiple times looking for clues as to what it is that Remus has that would keep him from Hogwarts. Maybe it’s a Muggle disease? Can wizards get Muggle illnesses outside of the common cold? </p><p>It isn’t until Sirius reads the letter for what must be the tenth time that it dawns on him that Remus said he was looking forward to seeing him. A furious blush creeps up from the ache in his chest pinkening his neck and cheeks, and Sirius finds he doesn’t mind the sensation at all. So, instead of worrying much about it, he simply lets himself smile. </p>
