          <div class="userstuff"><p>Let’s have dinner.</p><p>No.</p><p>Why?</p><p>You know why.</p><p>Remind me.</p><p>Merlin, Scorpius, have you finished the Ackles file?</p><p>Yes. Yes I have. Poor dude. Come on, remind me.</p><p>Because I’m 20 years older than you?</p><p>Does it make you feel dirty?</p><p>Scorpius!</p><p>What! 20 years is nothing, okay?</p><p>There’re dynasties shorter than 20 years!</p><p>It’s not even… wait, what? Really?</p><p>Yeah, I can lend you a book about it if you want?</p><p>I’d love that, thank you.</p><p>You’re welcome.</p><p>So, like I said, 20 years is nothing for a witch or wizard. We can live until like what, 200 years old?</p><p>I’m sure that’s a bit exaggerated.</p><p>Yeah, but just a bit, right? So why?</p><p>Scorpius, my goddaughter was in the same year as you in Hogwarts.</p><p>This is about us, not her.</p><p>You just won’t give up.</p><p>Come on, it’s just a dinner.</p><p>It’s not just a dinner. I know that. You know that. What do you think will happen after the dinner? You annoying me to death?</p><p>Hey! I’m insulted.</p><p>No. I’m not having dinner with you.</p><p>So it’s about my father, huh?</p><p>What?</p><p>You not going out with me. It’s because of my father.</p><p>Well, yeah, in a sense. It’s weird to go out with the son of someone your own age.</p><p>Except he’s not your age. He must be ten years younger than you now.</p><p>Scorpius.</p><p>I know. I know. He’s my dad. I don’t mean to be disrespectful.</p><p>Will you drop it?</p><p>I know you were in love with him.</p><p>I don’t know what you’re talking about.</p><p>My mother told me that.</p><p>Your mother misunderstood.</p><p>Well, I believe that you two never had an affair or anything, but you were in love with him, right? Mother used to hate you very much.</p><p>Why would she hate me? She had your father. I was just his partner.</p><p>You had his heart.</p><p>No I didn’t.</p><p>You did. Mother always knew that.</p><p>And she told you that?</p><p>Yeah, all the time, like she’s determined to have me hate you too, so when I was assigned to you, I really wasn’t friendly. Remember?</p><p>Oh, that’s why. You think I destroyed your parents’ marriage.</p><p>I thought it was you, but you didn’t, did you? I found my father’s diary yesterday.</p><p>He kept a diary?</p><p>Until his very end. Do you want to know what he’s written in it?</p><p>Not really. Have you seen Harry today?</p><p>Don’t use Auror Potter to change the subject, Hermione.</p><p>Sit down, Scorpius.</p><p>Okay. Okay. But I have to tell you this.</p><p>What?</p><p>He loved you.</p><p>That’s a joke.</p><p>And I love you too.</p><p>I don’t want to belittle your feelings, Scorpius, but I really don’t think so.</p><p>He was in love with you until he died. How did he die, Hermione?</p><p>It was a stray curse that we had never seen before.</p><p>It must be painful. His handwriting during that time is atrocious.</p><p>Yes, It was painful. For him and for us.</p><p>You mean for you.</p><p>What do you want me to say, Scorpius? He was my partner. He was the one person I trust my life with. Of course it was painful for me too.</p><p>Tell me how my father died.</p><p>He’s… It was a curse we had never seen. Me. The healers. Your mother. The Department of Mysteries. We tried everything.</p><p>But nothing worked.</p><p>Nothing worked. He suffered a lot. I’m sorry, but I think you are old enough to learn the truth. He suffered for a long time. I’m surprised that he had the strength to keep a diary.</p><p>Me too. How did my father die?</p><p>It’s the curse that killed him.</p><p>But how did my father die?</p><p>What do you mean?</p><p>Tell me his last moments.</p><p>I… there’s not much to tell.</p><p>He didn’t say anything? Ask for anyone?</p><p>No. No he didn’t.</p><p>That’s because he’s got the one he needed right beside him already, right?</p><p>Scorpius, your father loved you very much. He just didn’t want you to see him like that.</p><p>Like what?</p><p>He’s…</p><p>Don’t cry, Hermione.</p><p>I’m not crying.</p><p>Then what’s that? Raindrops indoors?</p><p>Scorpius!</p><p>I know. I’m kind of weird today huh? I think I’m catching a fever.</p><p>Do you feel okay? You can take sick leave this afternoon if you want.</p><p>Hermione, tell me how my father died.</p><p>I have told you. I don’t have anything else to add.</p><p>Please. I’m not gonna freak out.</p><p>What are you talking about?</p><p>Hermione, did you kill my father?</p><p>…</p><p>Do you know what he’s written?</p><p>You’re hurting me, Scorpius.</p><p>He loved you. Since god knows when. He loved you and he was glad that you were a Gryffindor.</p><p>Let go!</p><p>He was glad that his partner, the woman he loved, was a Gryffindor. He was glad that you had the heart of a lion. You know why?</p><p>Scorpius, I don’t want to hurt you. Please let go of me.</p><p>Because then she’d have the courage to end his misery. My father was glad that he could ask you to end it for him, and you said yes.</p><p>I’m not… I didn’t…</p><p>Do you know what I felt when I read that?</p><p>No.</p><p>I was furious. I was angry. I was so mad I broke a window. He was such a coward.</p><p>You’re not… you’re not mad at me?</p><p>Oh I’m definitely mad at you. How could you do that?</p><p>He was suffering! You didn’t see him!</p><p>Have you taken one minute to think about yourself? To think about what would happen to you? After you killed the love of your life?</p><p>Nothing happened to me. Alright? Nothing happened.</p><p>Bullshit.</p><p>Nothing. Happened.</p><p>He was selfish, and you were stupid. The Brightest Witch of Her Age my ass.</p><p>Does insulting me make you feel better?</p><p>It doesn’t. Nothing can make me feel better.</p><p>Let. Go.</p><p>Is that what you want? For me to let go of you? For the world to let go of you? Until you just what? Disappear?</p><p>I don’t want… I don’t want anyone.</p><p>Because he’s dead?</p><p>Because he’s dead, yes. You’re right, okay? I don’t want anyone. I don’t deserve anyone. I killed him! I was a, a, a huge failure! I kept Harry fucking Potter safe! But Draco was dying! And I didn’t have any idea, or knowledge, or whatever magic this fucking world had to save him!</p><p>You think it’s your fault?</p><p>Of course it’s my fault! I’m his partner! Everything that happened to him is my fault! And yes! I killed him! What do you want me to do? Do you want me to turn myself in? Azkaban? I’ll do it if it makes you feel better. I deserve that anyway.</p><p>How did you feel?</p><p>What?</p><p>How did you feel when you killed my father?</p><p>I was…</p><p>Were you relieved?</p><p>No…</p><p>How did you feel? A part of you died with him?</p><p>Scorpius…</p><p>How did you feel?</p><p>What do you want from me?</p><p>I want you.</p><p>Why? Why? I killed your father.</p><p>And I’ll hate you forever for that. And I’ll be grateful forever for that.</p><p>None of that is love.</p><p>Do you really want love? I have love, but do you really want it?</p><p>I don’t deserve it.</p><p>I’ll give you anything you think you deserve.</p><p>How about you taking your revenge?</p><p>You’re not serious.</p><p>No, I’m not.</p><p>Only my father can come up of that kind of request.</p><p>And he was such a bastard.</p><p>Let’s have dinner.</p><p>No.</p><p>I’ll give you anything you want. Do you want hate? Despise? Or do you want someone to understand you? I’m anything you want.</p><p>You don’t love me.</p><p>You don’t want anyone to love you.</p><p>Fair point.</p><p>Let’s have dinner.</p><p>What are we doing?</p><p>Not a healthy relationship, I wager.</p><p>You can be anything I want.</p><p>I have no problem to be a substitute.</p><p>Draco?</p><p>If you want.</p><p>I’m gonna go to hell for this.</p><p>I think that has been decided since you cast that Avada.</p><p>Kiss me.</p><p>Let’s have dinner.</p><p>Okay, kiss me.</p><p> </p><p>END</p></div>
