    <p>
  <span>Euphemia was contemplating the letter in front of her as she was eating breakfast.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Her son, James, had sent his parents a letter about how he was and what was going on at school. While that was normal the contents weren’t. In fact, Euphemia was quite sure that her son was in love and was picking on the one who James was most likely want to be his future husband.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Severus Snape. Euphemia was quite sure that if she looked back on every letter that her son sent her she would find that sixty percent or more was about that boy ever since James had gone to Hogwarts.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Euphemia mentally kicked herself for not realizing this before. Looking back on it she could clearly see the signs of her son’s love for the other boy.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Fleamont, Euphemia’s husband, walked into the dining room and saw the look of her face.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Mia?” he asked in concern. “Are you alright?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Euphemia blinked at him. “Yes, I’m fine. Just thinking.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Fleamont raised an eyebrow. “About what?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“James is in love with a boy named Severus Snape and most likely has been since the day he first entered the Hogwarts Express.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Fleamont paused to think about it. He remember the Prince Family Scandal, where the sole heir of the Prince family had run off with a muggle named Tobias Snape. “What?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Do you remember James’ letters? It was practically stated there and we didn’t even notice!” Euphemia exclaimed.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Fleamont’s brow furrowed as he thought about it. He quickly realized that his wife, as usual, was right.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Euphemia saw that and continued on. “I think that James doesn’t realize his feelings for the boy, and I’m not sure about the boy himself. Though from James’ letters he seems to not like James at all!”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Fleamont sighed. “James always did give into his emotions too easily. He didn’t understand romance though. I think that’s why he’s having trouble realizing his feelings for him.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“What do we do?” Euphemia asked worriedly.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“What do you mean?” asked Fleamont. “You want to push them together?” He raised an eyebrow. “I thought that you would’ve wanted him to realize his feelings and get together with his soulmate.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>His wife shrugged. “I </span>
  <em>
    <span>would</span>
  </em>
  <span> but I don’t want them to miss out on anything together. You know, like how we wished that we had realized our feelings for each other earlier at Hogwarts so we could spend more time together.” she added to explain.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Fleamont nodded. “That makes sense, but how would we push them together? Maybe we could convince young Severus to give James a chance and they could fall in love on the way.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Euphemia frowned. “Couldn’t we create a marriage contract for them? One that has clauses that will let them separate if they don’t want to be together?” She asked.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Fleamont sighed. “We can’t.” He explained. “If he wasn’t part of a magical family we could have, but because he’s already a part of a magical house we can’t make him. He’s part of the Prince family. His mother was disowned, but he was put onto the family because without him the direct Prince line would die out. Since he’s part of a family the only way we could make a marriage contract for him is if he was magically adopted into our family and that requires us to make him willingly part of our family and he would have to willingly decide that he wants to be a part of the Potter family. Then we would have to educate him in the Potter family culture. That wouldn’t be bad but we want him to love James for himself not the Dark looking for the money. The Dark might make him marry James just to kill him and take the Potter money for themselves!”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Euphemia sighed. “Isn’t there some way to let him and James have time to fall in love with each other?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Fleamont closed his eyes. “I don’t know.” he admitted.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Suddenly his eyes shot open. “Unless...Mia what about his guardianship? We could have him stay with us and James for the summer and be this time they can have time together!”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Well,” she said slowly, as she thought about it. “Albus </span>
  <em>
    <span>does</span>
  </em>
  <span> have a lot of influence...he could make sure that Severus’ guardianship is ours. But what about school? They spend more time there than at places like breaks.” Euphemia pointed out.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Fleamont smiled. “Albus Dumbledore. Remember? We can make him get Severus and James spend time together so that they can realize their feelings!”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Euphemia smiled too. “Oh, this would be perfect!” She frowned again. “Wait...what about children? They may want children and males aren’t able to have it together.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Fleamont’s grin didn’t flatter. “Remember what James said in his letters? Our future son-in-law is very good at creating things that he puts his mind to and he’s only 14! If they want children Severus can simply create a potion to allow them to have some!”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Euphemia’s smile was back. “Perfect!” she exclaimed cheerfully. “Now let’s contact Albus!”</span>
</p>
