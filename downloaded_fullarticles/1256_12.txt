    <p>
  <span>It was a week before Harry’s birthday when things changed, to vastly underestimate the absolute chaos that followed. The day was a normal enough one, he woke up in the room he and Ron had been sharing, showered and dressed before rolling his reluctant to wake best friend off of the cot and onto the floor. They stumbled down to the kitchen to find Remus at the oven, sliding hot scones onto a tray already heaped high with eggs and rashers of bacon and absently using his wand to direct a knife to deposit butter onto the steaming pastries. Sirius was straddling the back of a chair by one of the windows, cracked open to let the smoke from his cigarette drift out, face blank. He didn’t seem to actually be smoking but, rather, letting the thing burn down between his fingers as he pillowed his head on the arm bent over the back of the chair. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus had been gone a few days, doing whatever mysterious things Dumbledore had him doing, but looked to be in good spirits, offering a smile for Harry and a laugh for Ron when the redhead beelined right for the scones and shamelessly made a grab for one. Harry sat at the table, scrubbed clean along with the rest of the kitchen his first week here (much to Kreacher’s dismay), and poured himself a glass of orange juice, eyes sliding towards his godfather. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius’ eyes were red, his hair lank and falling around his face like a dark curtain, and his skin sallow under it’s natural tan. He was in the same clothes from the day before, albeit more rumpled; Harry would have been shocked if it turned out his godfather had done anything other than sitting up, drinking firewhiskey until the sun rose or Remus arrived and made him stop, whichever had happened first. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you have plans for today?” Remus asked, sitting across from Harry. A gesture of his hand sent the teapot to pour into three of the four waiting mugs. The last got coffee from a carafe unsettlingly shaped like the body of a pixie, with the steaming liquid pouring from the mouth pulled wide in an eternal silent scream. Sirius perked up, though if it was Remus’ voice or the smell of coffee that did it Harry couldn’t say, and slunk to the table to wrap thin, claw like fingers around the mug. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The garden, I think.” Harry said, casting a nervous look at his godfather. He’d been slowly working his way through the house to set things as close to rights as he could, and shoving endless amounts of disturbing ‘antiques’ into the attic to deal with some other time. Or burn. Burning most of the contents of 12 Grimmauld Place seemed like such a good idea, and would probably go over better with Sirius than all the cleaning and attempts at repair had. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>His godfather hated this place, and had every right to. He was happy to let it fall even further into disrepair and filth, might even have thought it was what the Black family home deserved, but Harry wasn’t prepared to do the same. He’d spent too long under the demanding rule of Petunia Dursley for that, so he’d turned the picture of Walburga Black around, covered it heavy curtains nailed to the wall, and set to work. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was going well, in his opinion. The basement was clean, save for Kreacher’s cupboard, and the first floor had come along well. He was feeling a little cooped up though, and the garden was becoming more viciously overgrown with every passing day, so some time trying to tame it seemed like a good next step. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius snorted into his mug. “You’re going to want to tether yourself to the house so you can find your way back through all of that. And,” Red rimmed eyes, yellowing at the whites, flicked up to peer at Harry thoughtfully. “Look out for the man eating plants. Strip the skin right off you if you aren’t careful. And they’re poisonous-” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Venomous.” Remus corrected lightly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius waved a dismissive hand. “They’re nasty, is what they are. Especially the Mamba Vine, wraps you up, injects you with its venom through it’s thorns, melts you from the inside out then drinks you down.”  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Which ones are those?” Ron asked around a mouth crammed full of bacon and scone, looking a bit paler than he had a moment ago. Harry leaned away from him to avoid the spray of food. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus sighed, lips twitching just slightly upwards. “Which ones aren’t deadly would be a better question, and every bit as impossible to answer. Walburga Black had a very...unique-” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Insane.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Approach to gardening, and crossbred quite a few species, for reasons I cannot begin to fathom. Her own amusement, perhaps.” Remus finished smoothly. “I’ll go out with you and show you how to deal with them.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry nodded enthusiastically. He wasn’t keen on the idea of being turned into soup by some vines with a taste for flesh if he could avoid it, or having the skin taken off is body. It would have been a pretty pathetic way to go after everything he’d faced down to be killed by an unruly garden. He could just imagine how people would talk about him after something like that. ‘Oh that Harry Potter, we thought he had so much potential but then he ended up as mulch in his godfather’s garden, tragically pathetic but no less than he deserved.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ron cringed. “I think I’ll sit this one-”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius’ mug hit the table with a crack, sending steaming coffee rushing over the polished surface. Harry pushed himself back, yelping as he hurried to avoid the scalding hot mess spilling over onto the floor. Sirius’ hiss of pain was louder than the scraping of chairs as Remus and Ron jumped to feet; he was clutching his hand and at first Harry thought it  was that he’d burned himself with the coffee but Sirius holding his hand out, palm up, proved that false quickly. The flesh was red and raw buy bubbling up stark white in blister lines. There was a shape to them, becoming clearer with each passing moment, as more blisters leapt up from the searing flesh. A sickly sweet smell filled the room. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus lurched forward, snatching Sirius’ wrist, with his wand outstretched. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t!” Sirius growled through gritted teeth. Remus froze, wand tip mere centimeters from Sirius’ skin, a grimace twisting his features. Sirius smiled wanly, though it seemed more like a flinch of pain that left his teeth exposed to Harry. “Leave it. It’s a summons.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A summons?” Harry repeated, disbelieving. “Who? Haven’t they ever heard of owls or the floo or something that doesn’t do that!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well,” Remus said distractedly, eyes trained on Sirius’ hand. “It is attention getting.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>A loud pop left and the soft plop of something falling onto the table left Harry tripping over his words. It was a necklace, a long silver chain in three loops, with a silver snake pendant hanging from it. The snake was about the length of Harry’s fingers, thin and coiled into a figure 8 that was connected by the jaws clamping down on its tail. He could see tiny individual scales, some brushed silver and others polished and gleaming. It’s eyes were two bright blue gem chips, shaped into diamonds.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Narcissa.” Sirius breathed. “She’s calling on the Omega Protection Rite. This must be...a portkey to where she is.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ron made a noise of surprise and Remus’ eyes narrowed. Harry watched, feeling like once again he was missing some critical piece of information about the magical world that would let him understand why those words carried so much weight. Just hearing them was making his stomach tun, and the way Sirius was looking at the necklace, more serious that Harry had seen him in months sent a shiver of unease up Harry’s spine. He couldn’t really be considering what it looked like he was considering, could he?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sirius, you can’t.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius’ fingers flexed and the seared flesh of his palm pulled, cracked, and bled. “There’s no one else left.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wait, Sirius-” Harry said in the same breath as Remus’ alarmed “Sirius-” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m the prime alpha of the Black family.” He pushed away from the table, face a mask of determination, and rose to his feet. The hairs on the back of Harry’s arm started to raise up and a prickling like his limbs had fallen asleep started to creep up his fingers and toes. Magic, undirected and seeping out, building swiftly crackled invisibly in the air. “I have to answer.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The cups on the table rattled. Remus’ hands snaked out, slamming down over the tops of two to keep them in place even as he turned narrowed golden eyes onto Sirius. “Not alone. I’ll go with you. It could be a trap.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Again, a beat of silence as the tension between them ratcheted up. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius shook his head tightly. “Narcissa wouldn’t use the old ways like that. The backlash...she’s too shrewd, and self serving, to risk it.”   </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nonetheless, I’ll be going.” There was an edge to Remus’ voice, something that made Sirius stiffen then, with a roll of his eyes, incline his head in acceptance. “Harry, Ron, stay here. If we aren’t back in twenty minutes contact Arthur and Molly.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What?!” Harry squawked. “You can’t be serious! Take us with you!”  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was a testament to just how distracted both men were that they didn’t even spare him a look, as Sirius slapped a hand over one of Remus while clenching the pendant tightly in his injured hand. It was very typical, really, to completely ignore ignore him when things were getting dangerous and, to make matters worse, Harry wasn’t sure he was in any position to demand answers after everything that had happened in his fifth year. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yet Harry had to wonder, not for the first time in his life, if he was the only one thinking clearly. Sirius, who wasn’t to leave the house and had nearly died just a few months before, was going to answer a violent, painful, summons from Narcissa Malfoy, who was married to a Death Eater currently imprisoned in Azkaban as a direct result of Sirius and Harry’s actions? And seemed sure that wasn’t a plot against him because...Narcissa wouldn’t do something like that? True, Harry didn’t know much about Mrs. Malfoy, nor did he want to, but considering her murderous husband and absolutely prat of a son Harry very much doubted that she was a good or reasonable person. He didn’t understand why they were entertaining this idea and didn’t call the rest of the Order, or Dumbledore! None of that had even been </span>
  <em>
    <span>suggested</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But they were gone with a loud *pop* before he could even rise from his chair. He looked at Ron, who was frowning hard at a point above Harry’s head. He caught the redhead’s eyes and was treated to a shrug. He slumped back down into his chair and, with a groan, dropped his head down onto the tabletop. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Great. Just great.     </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The summer had really been going too well, all things considered. He should have seen something terrible happening, considering his luck. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry hadn’t had to go to the Dursleys, for starters, staying instead at Grimmauld Place with Sirius, Remus, and the ever present, but varying, members of the Order as well as the Weasleys. There had been some heated discussion about it, though he had to hear about it second hand from Remus after the fact, circling around the fact the protect provided by his aunt would expire when he came of age that year. Dumbledore, it seemed, had wanted him to stay until his sixteenth birthday and take what assured protection he should, while some others thought it was an unneeded risk to have him one place and need to move him later, to say nothing of the risk it would pose for his relatives. And after the near miss at the Department of Mysteries (Harry woke up more nights than he cared to admit, hearing Bellatrix Lestrange’s high pitched laughter and seeing nothing but green, throat choked and lungs tight at the thought of what almost was) wasn’t it best to keep him close, and to continue teaching him everything the order could impart to him? In the end, Dumbledore had agreed and here he was, quietly counting down the days of what was shaping up to be his best summer ever.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Aside from not being able to leave the house or it’s grounds, the constant tension in the air, and Sirius being...well. His Godfather was, once again according to Remus, not at his best after everything that had happened at the Ministry. Harry could tell Sirius was putting up a good front for him, tried to be ready with a bright smile, a willingness to ruffle his hair and slap him on the back, undivided attention, and a wealth of stories to tell and things to teach. But he also was painfully aware of the sounds of the man moving around on the lower floors late at night, the reek of alcohol that followed him, and of the dark shadows that lingered under his eyes and hollows of his cheeks. He seemed...tired, exhausted even, in the silent, still moments that crept up between them more and more often in the weeks since the end of term. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It could be awkward, especially when Mrs. Weasley was about and radiating that unmissable air of disapproval Sirius seemed to never fail to inspire in her, or when Remus wasn’t around to fill in the silence with his warm voice and quiet humor. It would become even more tense than it normally was, the specter of the Black family and Voldermort’s lack of retaliation for the Ministry looming over them, when it was just the two of them. Harry had been guilty grateful when Ron had stepped into the house on the fourth week of break, trunk dragging behind him, to stay for the rest of the holiday because when other people were there Sirius was more like the man in all the pictures and stories, and less the worn, drawn shade Harry was coming to know. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry was...he was sure it was hard on Sirius, being in the ‘haunted’ remains of his family home that he’d been so completely removed from, trapped, and now with the death of Bellatrix on his shoulders. Harry couldn’t imagine what it was like, having killed family. Even if it had been to save his and Harry’s lives, even if she was completely twisted and insane, even if it was the only way…She was still Sirius’ family.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry’s brain refused to process it what it must have been like for his godfather in the moment, watching Bellatrix fall back through the veil because of him, couldn't. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He was grateful for Remus, and whoever else might have argued on his behalf to stay with Sirius for the summer, if not for his own sake than for his godfathers. Harry was sure Remus was making it simpler than it had been in reality, as Dumbledore had always been too adamant about him staying with the Dursleys for him to believe he’d caved after a little logic from the werewolf, but as always there were things he’d been deemed not old enough to know the full details of. A few months ago he would have resented that, would have demanded the answers they were keeping from him, raged and seethed, and then done what he could to find things out on his own. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Things were different now. He wouldn’t go so far as to say he was okay with being treated like a child, not when in the same breath as telling him he wasn’t ready to hear all the details of what was happening he was hearing that he was meant to kill Voldemort, but for now he could accept it. He would accept anything that kept him from nearly losing what little family he had, and kept him close to it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Just like he would accept being left at the breakfast table while siad family went off on what seemed like a suicide mission, at best. Accept it while watching the close obsessively, getting up and pacing the perimeter of the kitchen for what felt like a long time but turned out to be barely a minute, before sitting back down. Ron thin smile was sympathetic, and anxious, though he kept quiet. It was a change of pace for the redhead, who was prone to chatter at the best, and worst, or times, and Harry appreciated the change. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It didn’t take the full twenty minutes for Remus and Sirius to return. In fact it was barely ten before they were back, dropping into existence with twin shouts and the creaking crash of the table giving way and collapsing beneath their weight. Harry stared dumbly, torn between relief and confusion and maybe a little bit of humor at the sight of them, squashed under a sheet wrapped lump, coffee and tea splashed on them, dishes and food strewn about. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Damn.” Sirius groaned, shoving at the elbow Remus had digging what looked to be painfully into his neck. “Off, Moony, we need to heal him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Heal…</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry’s eyes darted to the sheet wrapped lump, eyebrows jumping up when he sorted out the tangle of limbs enough to realize that there was an extra arm mixed it, this one milk pale and thin. A first glance Harry thought it the skin was covered in tattoos but looking closer found that no, the overlapping dark smudges were a molted curtain of bruises in blues, sickly greens, and raw angry reds. Sirius was holding tightly to the lump, one arm wrapped around the body and body arranged in a way that suggested he’d placed himself deliberately under it to cushion the fall they’d taken. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He looked like he was in pain, and not just because Remus’ attempts to get away from him were resulting in more elbows and knees being jammed into seemingly sensitive places. Harry surged forward, leaning over the debris, to help, Ron following. His hand brushed over the bare arm but a dark look from Sirius and a snapped “Don’t touch him!” had Harry veering off to help Remus up instead. Sirius managed more or less on his own, with only a little steadying from Ron on the path to his feet, without letting his grip on the body slip. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Take Malfoy upstairs.” Remus said, tugging absently on his jumper. Harry’s eyes snapped back to the body, still tightly wrapped up with only the single limp arm showing. Malfoy? It didn’t look big enough to be Narcissa, who Harry knew was on the tall side, and she certainly wasn’t a ‘he’, but that only left- “I’ll bring up a potion after I inform Albus about this...development.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius nodded once, tightly, before turning on his heel and racing up the stairs, louder and more lively in the moment than he’d been all summer. Harry watched him go, mouth open in disbelief. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Malfoy? That was </span>
  <em>
    <span>Malfoy</span>
  </em>
  <span>?” Ron spat the name with so much venom Harry could practically feel the acid burn of it. “That...that worthless piece of-”  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ronald, that’s enough.” Remus’ eyes cut towards the redhead and once again there was that edge to his voice, something on the edge of a growl that brought to mind sharp teeth and glowing eyes. Ron shut his mouth with an audible click. “Narcissa Malfoy is-she’s been killed by the Death Eaters.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry rocked back on his heels, the flat declaration making his heart and stomach drop. More death, because of Voldemort and his followers, because Harry- </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Draco will likely be staying here for a time, as seems to be his mother’s final wish. He’s had a...trying time, this summer, and I will ask that if you don’t think you can be civil-and I have no intention of asking that you do-that you at least steer clear of him.” Remus paused, sighing tiredly as his shoulders slumped and he raked a hand through his graying hair. “The Dark Lord has been taking his anger at Lucius’ failure out on Draco and his mother, and now his mother is gone. There’s no reason to contribute to his misery. I know you’re both better than that.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He left them with that said, not looking back before hurrying up the stairs to the main level of the house. Harry and Ron exchanged bland looks then, as one, flopped back into their chairs. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Merlin’s balls.” Ron muttered, pressing the heels of his hands against his eyes; Harry silently agreed with the sentiment. Then, face twisting in distaste, pulled his hands away to squint at his palms. “What’s this glittery shit? I think it rubbed off with I touched Sirius.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He turned his hand around for Harry to show a pale orange-yellow substance coating his palm. It shimmered even in the low light of the kitchen, like tiny flecks of gold were embedded in whatever it was. Harry leaned forward, reaching out to drag Ron’s hand closer to he could get a better look but stopped short when he saw his own hand was also covered. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>When had that happened? </span>
</p>
