    <p>Hermione,</p><p>You witch! I haven't heard from you in weeks, or anyone else, besides mum and dad, for that matter.</p><p>Well, anyway, everything is going great on my end of the broomstick. Quite literally, actually!</p><p><i>The Daily Prophet</i> just named me number one <i>Most Hottest and Newest Chaser of the Year.</i></p><p>Don't give me that look either, 'Mione! I saw your face when they named you the number one <i>Most Successful and Intelligent Witches</i> in Britain last year!</p><p>Training is kicking my arse in more ways than one, however. Just the day before yesterday I almost fell off my broom, but caught the end of my broomstick with my ankle... right before I was headed towards my deathbed. Just kidding! Except not really - just don't tell mum what I said or I'll send Crookshanks catnip and we all know how he gets.</p><p>Not only that, our captain, Gwenog Jones, is such a hardarse. I'm not even exaggerating. She wakes us up at the most ungodly hours to train. Just yesterday she woke us all up at three o'clock in the morning to <i>run</i>. Yes, run! Five miles! At three in the morning! I'm still upset about that one, if you can't tell. I swear Oliver Wood wasn't this bad. Truly. And don't even try argue, or perhaps, reason with the women either. She's bloody mad!</p><p>It's honestly like one of those Muggle military bootcamps. And while I'm sore and exhausted and kind of lonely at times, I'm so, so <i>happy.</i></p><p>I'm living my dream, Hermione. And I refuse to let anyone take that away from me.</p><p>I hope to hear from you. I know you, dumb and dumber are out during your Auror training, trying to make the world a better place, but I'm always an owl away.</p><p>Miss you,</p><p>Ginny</p><p>
  <i>P.S: Did you catch my Muggle reference? (;</i>
</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>.</p>
</center>Ginny,<p>I know! And all I can really say is I'm sorry. I'm not lying when I say I've been crazy busy. I'm sure Harry and Ron are too, that's probably why you haven't heard from them. Don't feel too bad though, I haven't heard or seen them in the last three weeks either.</p><p>They're off with the males and I've been in a group of female Aurors for the last few weeks training with them in the middle of nowhere. I'm talking acres of bright green grass with no one around for miles. It was peaceful except for the intense training, so I can understand your pain.</p><p>I miss you too, Gin, and Harry and Ron and it's a bittersweet feeling but like you - I'm so happy too. These women I've been around the past few weeks have enriched my mind with so many techniques and new spells and hexes. It's been a mind blowing experience and I've met some alright peers here as well. I hope you are playing nice with your teammates, Ginny!</p><p>And actually, George and Angelina are watching Crookshanks - go right ahead. I still owe George one after he dyed my hair pink in my sleep. I swear, your mum dropped him his head too many times as an infant.</p><p>Anyway, this will probably be my last letter for awhile, unfortunately. In a couple of days, we'll be leaving and going on solo survival missions in the wilderness - wish me luck. I've done this with Harry and Ron, but I'm nervous, Gin. It'll just be me and me alone and I'm not sure if I'm ready to face that.</p><p>I haven't been alone in a really long time.</p><p>I hope all is well and you stop falling off broomsticks,</p><p>Hermione</p><p>
  <i>P.S: I did. You make me so proud.</i>
</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>.</p>
</center>Hermione,<p>I'm writing this as soon as I got your letter just so I can catch you in time before you leave - hopefully.</p><p>You don't have to reply back, seeing as you can't really, I suppose, but I had to tell someone.</p><p>And I don't quite trust my teammates enough yet to not run off gossiping to <i>Witch Weekly</i>. Merlin, I can already see the headlines.</p><p>Bloody hell, I'm rambling.</p><p>
  <i>IbrokeupwithHarrythroughaletter.</i>
</p><p>I'm so awful, I know.</p><p>
  <i>I know.</i>
</p><p>But it had to be done, 'Mione. I've gotten more letters from you than him and just thinking about him makes my heart hurt.</p><p>I'm tired of loving and giving my all to someone who can't even give me the time of day to do the same. If I was ever being honest with myself, me and Harry have been on a downward spiral since the end of the War. Hell, last year during his first year of Auror training, I wrote him letters every day, 'Mione, every single damn day. For every ten letters of mine, I got maybe one back and I tried to not let it bother me - tried to not let it break my heart, tried to convince myself he needed space and time to heal from everything.</p><p>And then, when I got the callback from the Holyhead Harpies, he wasn't excited or sad or mad. He kissed me on the cheek and went to have a butterbeer with Ron! I threw him a whole damn party when he got accepted into Auror training!</p><p>Maybe I am overreacting and it was petty of me to break it off through owl, but it felt so right. It felt like this huge weight had been lifted off my shoulders and I could finally breathe again.</p><p>I'm not Harry Potter's girlfriend.</p><p>I'm Ginny Weasley and it's time I start acting like it again.</p><p>Stay safe,</p><p>Ginny</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>.</p>
</center>Ginny,<p>I'm writing this as I pack this morning. It's raining, too. Lovely.</p><p>I will write a longer response when I have the time, but if you're happy, Gin, that's all that matters at the end of the day.</p><p>I miss you.</p><p>I wish I could write more, but I really have to go if I want to send this before I leave.</p><p>Talk to you soon,</p><p>Hermione</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>.</p>
</center>Hermione,<p>So, I got really tipsy and kissed a girl.</p><p>And liked it.</p><p><i>Witch Weekly</i> somehow has the picture on their front page.</p><p>Oops.</p><p>With love,</p><p>Ginny</p>
