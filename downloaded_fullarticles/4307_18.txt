          <div class="userstuff"><p>The telephone persisted, shrilling out again and again in the quiet cottage. With a sigh, Severus Snape put aside his task and stalked towards it.<br/>
<br/>
"Snape." he rapped out.</p><p>"Good Afternoon Sir! And how are you today Mr Snope?" the tinny voice of a heavily accented young man babbled from the receiver. "My name is David and I wonder if you could spare a few moments to speak about your home insurance--"</p><p>"This is not <em>my </em>house. " Snape stated baldly. His tone did not invite further debate. The young man swallowed nervously, but to his credit, he forged ahead.<br/>
<br/>
"It will only take a few moments, Mr Snope. Is the homeowner in?"</p><p>"I believe Doctor Granger is in the other room, hexing doxies."</p><p>"I <em>beg </em>your pardon?" The tinny voice sounded perplexed.  "Hexing?"<br/>
<br/>
"I <em>said</em>, she is in the other room, hexing the----"<br/>
<br/>
The rustling of the handset being transferred interrupted the conversation, along with some murmured voices.</p><p>" Who is it, Severus? ---- no, no - that's ok, go back to your cauldron. Hello? Hello-  yes, this is she." The woman's voice was crisp and professional sounding, and the salesman almost sighed with relief.  "What can I help you with?"<br/>
<br/>
"I....um.... apologies madam, the gentleman said you couldn't answer the phone as you were practising <em>witchcraft!</em> A good joke, I think maybe, for Hallowe'en! But what I wanted to talk to you about your insurance madam-"<br/>
<br/>
"Practicing witchcraft? What cheek! <em>Practicing</em> witchcraft.." she huffed. "I'll have you know that I am very good at it! Practicing <em>indeed</em>!"<br/>
<br/>
The call ended with a sudden click. <br/>
<br/>
In a computer filled office somewhere far, far away, a young man sat staring at his screen and pondering his career choices.<br/>
<em>If every English person is going to be crazy like this, perhaps I should have chosen the other job after all...</em></p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>"I told you not to take the cottage with all the Muggle trappings" Snape commented, peering at the mixture he was holding up to the light. "or at least, not plug the damn things in...."</p><p>Hermione Granger rolled her eyes as she entered the living room, levitating the last of the frozen doxies into a large bucket.<br/>
<br/>
"I thought the phone at least might be useful. Some <em>Muggle </em>cottage anyway, if it has doxies living in it!" The creature dropped on the pile with a muted <em>thunk</em>, and she dusted off her hands.</p><p>  "You shouldn't have any more trouble now, if you get that lot out and clean the place with this." He corked the bottle with his wand and gave it a shake to test the seal.</p><p>"Thank you, Severus." Her smile was warm as she laid a hand on his. "Now come on, let's get cleaned up. You reek of knotgrass."<br/>
<br/>
Pests and potions were all but forgotten when her lips met his, but as she tugged him gently towards the stairs, a subtle flick of his hand pulled the cord from the wall. The soft tap of it hitting the floor was no interruption at all.</p><p>                        </p>

Click. Beep. Click.  Somewhere in an office far away, the autodialler chugged along, mindlessly dialling the numbers on its unending list.<br/>
Granford, M. Click.<br/>
Granley, I.L. "<em>The person you have called is busy...." </em>Click.<br/>
Grant, G. Click.<br/>
Granger, H.J. <em>"We're sorry, the number you have dialled is no longer in service. Goodbye".</em> Click.<br/>
Groadley, A. Click.<br/>
The machine whirred on.</p></div>
