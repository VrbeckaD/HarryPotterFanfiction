    <p>
  <span>"You're clearly doing it wrong" Q unhelpfully pointed out from where he was perched on the kitchen table, sucking on some kind of candy that smelled of synthetic strawberry and swinging his feet like a child "That's not how Danny does it"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James sighed heavily and glared at the brown sludge merrily bubbling away on the stove, steadily reminding himself that MI6 wouldn't have appreciated it if he strangled their Quartermaster "Why don't you do it yourself then?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Alex's voice came from the living room before Q could take the bait and jump off the table to near the stove "You know he's been banned from using any kitchen appliances but the electric kettle"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I know how to make some bloody hot chocolate" Q huffed, crunching the last of his candy under his molars in an irritatingly loud way that made James cringe.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Just like you knew how to make pancakes?" James retaliated, spoon dipping in the concoction to give it a stir.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Q blushed red and seemed to fluff up like one of his cats when in a hissy fit "It wasn't my fault! Batter isn't supposed to explode"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Exactly my point"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Could you stop bickering like stroppy children missing their mum?" Alex sighed from the kitchen door, arms crossed across his chest and a book about incomprehensible maths dangling from his hand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Would that make you our daddy?" James teased, icy-blue eyes twinkling with mischief.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Q rolled his eyes before turning his attention on Alex "Where's Danny anyway? He should know better than to leave us to our own devices" A pout quivered on his lips, shining with sticky sugar.  "He's got a life besides babysitting MI6 operatives" Alex strode to the table and tugged Q onto a chair, refraining from reminding him the tabletop wasn't made to be sitting upon: he wasn't in the mood to deal with a high on sugar Quartermaster intent on being as whiny as humanly possible "Come on you two, let's get some hot chocolate from the coffee house around the corner" he encouraged, leaning in to turn the stove off and politely avoiding to tell James that yes, as Q had pointed out, he was doing it wrong.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I don't want hot chocolate"  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"But I do!"  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Alex pinched the bridge of his nose in an unusual display of tiredness "I'll go buy you hot chocolate if you two promise me to stay away from the kitchen and not kill each other"  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Of course, love" Q purred, lovingly kissing his cheek as he made his way towards the living room, appropriating the remote for himself before James could join him and start claiming choosing rights about what they should watch. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Alex wordlessly observed James gracefully drop his gorgeous body next to Q's sprawled figure with a frown already forming on his forehead as his pale irises took in the documentary about penguins the younger man had settled on; mentally shaking his head, Alex escaped their flat before the impending argument exploded, his fingers already tapping on the touchscreen of his mobile Danny's number.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He immediately answered "What's wrong?" Danny asked with barely concealed worry.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"They're driving me mad" Alex complained, a sulking tone in his voice that he would forever denying ever emitting.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Danny's laughter was cheery and crystalline, echoed by the twinkling of ice against glasses and billiards being played: clearly, he was having fun and Alex felt a bit bad about bothering him to whine about their lovers "Just shag them" Danny suggested good-naturedly.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I can't handle the two of them alone" Alex entered the coffee house and thanked all the gods he didn't believe in that there wasn't anyone waiting to order and asked for a takeaway hot chocolate spiced with cinnamon and dotted with tiny marshmallows - the barman definitely didn't look at him as if he was barking mad.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Shouldn't be James the one afraid of not being able to satisfy two younger men in his bed?" Danny joked lightly, his voice as warm as the aroma of the hot chocolate being made.   </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"When the day comes that James won't boast about his sexual prowess, I'll go to light a candle in church"   </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You love it"  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Alex sighed "I do" There was no other rational reason why he put up with James otherwise. And he also loved Q, despite his childishness and  nasty vindictive streak. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I'll see you in a couple of hours, hoping to find home still habitable. Kisses"  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Kisses" Alex sighed and rung off, just in time to accept the cardboard cup filled with hot chocolate and pay.   </span>
</p><p>
  <span>When he entered the living room, he really shouldn't have been surprised to find Q riding James as if his life depended on it while the documentary droned on. Alex observed them for a few seconds, quickly deciding that the hot chocolate could be reheated in the microwave, and joined them on the couch.</span>
