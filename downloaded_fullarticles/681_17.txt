    <p>Fred Weasley had had an <em>interesting</em> few years, to put it mildly. It had been a mild shock when he’d been sorted into Slytherin, the first in his family, and it had hurt when his twin had been placed in Hufflepuff (not that it stopped them from causing chaos, obviously), they were separated for the first time he could remember. And then after that his Defense teacher had turned out to have Voldemort on the back of his head (he cringed remembering how he and George had thrown snowballs at the back of the turban, but at least old moldywart wouldn’t have seen them), and then the next year Ginny had arrived.</p><p>He’d been overjoyed that she’d been sorted into the same house as him, and done his best to comfort her when she’d worried their parents would be mad, after all, they still loved him. But barely anything had consoled her until she’d received a letter from their mum, telling Ginny how proud she was that her daughter was that ambitious to be in Slytherin, and making Ginny to promise to tell her if any of her new friends’ parents had problems with where their child had been sorted (he had a feeling a few first year Slytherins got Weasley jumpers that year), and then the petrifyings had started.</p><p>Ginny had been a wreck, he had thought that she was just scared it would turn out to be one of her friends, but then the truth had come out. Ginny hadn’t been the same since, her life force had been drained extensively, and apparently not all of it had returned to her when that diary was destroyed. He thought something inside of him might break to see how she got sick, unable to leave her bed some days, but eventually, the healers had figured it out, and now she was coping better.</p><p>He wasn’t quite sure what had happened the year after that, Ron had been very secretive about it, and he wasn’t going to badger his brother for the details, he was pretty sure he’d start going grey if he heard about too many of their adventures.</p><p>But this, this was definitely the most exciting. The Tri-Wizard tournament. George had snuck over to sit with him, as usual, and they both held their breath as Dumbledore ran through the rules, grinning at each other when it was announced that anyone turning 17 that year could enter. They were definitely doing that. They were in need of the money after Bagman, of course, the slimy git, but Fred was already working on ways to get their money back. They were going to need it if they were starting a joke shop.</p><p>They kept their voices low as they planned when to put their names in, sure, they could do it with everyone watching, but then they risked their siblings writing home, and an inevitable howler. It was better to do it so when their parents found out it would be too late. It was easy to act innocent when Ginny cornered him and George as they headed back to the Slytherin common room (after all, the only time someone objected to George joining him, they’d ended up hexed so bad they couldn’t walk for a day), her hands on her hips, a shocking similarity to their mother evident in her face.</p><p>“You’re not planning on putting your names in, are you?” her eyes narrowed just slightly, searching their expressions for tells, and just as Fred opened his mouth to respond, a small finger was poking him in the chest.</p><p>“Are you perhaps <strong><em>short of a marble</em></strong>? You could get killed! I already told you, if you die I’m bringing you back to kill you again at <em>least</em> five more times.” her tone was firm, and both of them knew there was no point lying to Ginny, she was terrifying when she wanted to be, which was just about all the time.</p><p>“We’ll get you something decent with the prize money if we win?” they offered, and she continued to stare for a moment, before nodding, her voice dark as she replied.</p><p>“You better, or else I’ll be relying on my other brothers to make me an aunt.”</p><p>Well, shit.</p><p> </p><p align="center">

</p><p> </p><p>They’d done it in the dead of night. It was easier then, away from prying eyes, away from the jeers at the idea of a Slytherin champion. They knew Lee had put his name in, as well as Angelina, and if it couldn’t be one of them, they hoped it would perhaps be one of those two. They’d never judged the twins based on their house, but who they were as people, besides, they could all appreciate a good game of Quidditch. </p><p>And so now, they waited. With the other schools having arrived, it was easier for people to move tables, to sit with their friends, a show of unity, so Fred squeezed his brothers hand under the table, and felt the reassuring (if slightly misjudged force wise) hand of his friend Cassius clap him on the shoulder as the boys twin sister, Cassie, grinned at him. The Teller twins hadn’t put their names in, they were more interested in some Muggle thing called trap-ease than a tournament.</p><p>“And the Hogwarts champion is-” Fred squeezed harder, it had to be one of them, it just had too. “Fred Weasley!” </p><p>His brain didn’t catch up to his ears at first, but the table around him erupted in cheers (apart from a few), whether or not they thought him a blood traitor, they could appreciate a Slytherin champion, and they practically shoved Fred towards the front, and he was in a daze as he joined the other champions, only brought out of it by Harry coming into the room. He heard Fleur, he thought that was her name anyway, asking Harry if they were needed back in the hall, but the young Gryffindor’s expression told him everything he needed to know.</p><p>Bugger. It always had to be Harry, didn’t it?</p>
