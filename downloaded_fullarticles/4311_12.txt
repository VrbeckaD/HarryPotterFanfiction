    <p>Summer was boring once again. Your only excitement fell on Luna writing you. She kept her promise to write you everyday and you wrote back everyday as well. If it wasn't for Luna' letters or Jason, your owl, you would have passed Hogwarts off as a really vivid dream. <br/>Taking care or any owl by yourself was harder than you thought. You cleaned the cage when Jason was our delivering letters and even in a day, the cage so gross. You feed him the rats your cat caught. It took you a while to find somewhere to buy owl food or figure out what owl food was besides rats. You had to clean Jason, which he did not like. Thankfully he preened himself. <br/>You almost dropped the cage  when Jason came back with more than one letter. It was Luna's like usual but he also had a letter from Hogwarts. You got a little excited but It was just the list for your school supplies. <br/>In Luna's letter it said she had received the list to and was going to Diagon Alley that Sunday. </p><p>When Sunday came and your parents asked you where exactly Diagon Alley was, you realized you didn't actually know. But you remembered something Luna had sent you a few weeks back. Floo Powder. She also told you how to use it, she thought it might come in handy. <br/>Your house did have a fireplace, though none of you ever used it.<br/>"Luna said you just step in the fireplace and clearly say where you want to go then throw the powder down."<br/>Thankfully you all ended up in the fireplace of a shop in Diagon Alley first try. <br/>You exchanged your muggle money for  wizard money and went off to get your books. <br/>Luna told you to meet her at the broom shop but was no where to be seen when you arrived.<br/>You pushed yourself to the shop window and gawked at the new Nimbus 2001.<br/>"Can you get me one, please?" You asked your parents. <br/>They looked at each other. They had no idea of how wizard money worked but even they knew that the broomstick cost a lot of money. <br/>"No need." You heard a familiar voice say. <br/>You spun around to face Luna, who stood in the doorway of the shop  <br/>"Luna!!" You ran and gave your friend a big hug. You felt a little embarrassed after.<br/>"For you." She said kindly, handing you the brand new broomstick that was in her hand. It read Nimbus 1700.<br/>"It's one of the older ones but I'm sure it'll do fine."<br/>"Luna, wow, you didn't have to. Really...."<br/>"I know,  I wanted to." She started to skip away from you before looking back,  "Are you coming? My dad's waiting at Flourish and Blotts."<br/>You and your parents went with Luna to the book shop  </p><p>You piled your books into your suitcase and carefully put your new broom against your bedroom wall. You laid down on your bed. You looked over at the wall beside your bed to see the pictures you took or yourself and Luna last year at Hogwarts. <br/>On your bedside table was a photo album filled with the the rest of the pictures you took last year. You only put the ones with yourself and or Luna in them up on your wall. </p><p>You got off your bed and went to get some tea  Apparently the neighbor gave your parents a huge pack of about every kind of tea. You've been drinking it like crazy. </p><p>~~~~</p><p>Your parents drove you to Kings Cross on September 1st. They walked with you to the wall between the two platforms, you said your goodbyes and ran at the wall to Platform 9 3/4. It was kind of scary going through without Luna. At least last time you could close your eyes and let her lead. <br/>You hopped on the train found the compartment with Luna and your other roommates from school, Rose, Hilary and Diane. <br/>"I see you learned how to tie your tie." Luna said to you when you entered the space. You had gotten into your robes early, it was easier than having everyone wait outside for you to change. It was less embarrassing too. <br/>"Actually, my dad tied It for me." You pulled at the tie, trying to loosen It. <br/>"Good." Luna said getting up and loosening it for you. "I liked tying it for you." She smiled and looked in your eyes for a moment before Diane imformed both of you that there were still other people in the compartment. <br/>You and Luna sat down opposite to the other three. <br/>You felt the blush on your face. What was that about? What did she mean by that? <br/>You remembered a moment from last year when a boy made a comment about you and Luna cuddling. You didn't understand what he meant by it but you do now. He took Luna cuddling up against you, asleep as a sign that you and her were dating. You were only 11, you didn't even know that it was possible for two girls to date. <br/>It was only a year later but you spent a lot of time on the Internet during the summer. You know some stuff now. <br/>You would be lying if you said you never thought about Luna in that way. You had crushes before but all of them were on boys. You didn't know how to take your feelings,  you didn't even know what they meant. You could have just been missing her. She was your only true friend. You don't know. You're only 12.</p>
