          <div class="userstuff"><p>"I am so sad, said Harry. "My relationship with Ginny is falling apart, Ron and Hermione are too busy fundraising for Hermione's Minister for Magic campaign to pay much attention to me, and am sick of the spotlight."<br/>
He pondered his predicament.<br/>
"I know!" he exclaimed, jumping up and down. "I will retreat to the muggle world."<br/>
And thus he did. But one day, he tripped in an alleyway in London and fell onto a rogue portkey disguised as a penguin statue.<br/>
"Oh my gosh!" he yelled. The world spun as the portkey hooked under his balls and did not let go. Then with a whump, he landed face-first in some grass.<br/>
"Woah! Gnarly!" he heard someone yell. It was a skateboarder. He was wearing tie-die and a knit cap.<br/>
"Oh no," said Harry. "It appears as though I have been transported to a skateboarding competition in California. Oh what to do?"<br/>
He met a nice man, and all around solid dude named Tony Hawk. They quickly became friends. Then lovers. Then they had the sexy times. And it was like a whole thing.<br/>
Tony taught him how to do a Roast Beef and a Stalefish. Harry also became a popular skateboarder. His scar had not hurt in like, a long time bro. All was tubular. </p><p>THE END</p></div>
