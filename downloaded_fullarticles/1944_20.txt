    <p>A small dark figure skidded across the wind currents. The cold had bit his fingers and nose and tinged them pink. The moon was full and bright. Soft moonlight guided him back to the mansion. Wind whipped his deep red hair against his face like a thousand small blades; but he didn’t mind because ten galleons sat heavy in his pocket, a malicious grin spread across his face. His eyes glinted against the starlight like a sword in the sunset.<br/>
James had snuck out around 12:30 AM to go to Christopher Brown’s house for dueling club. Before even stepping foot on the ground he knew that flying home with pockets of galleons was set in stone.<br/>
After the seventh match no one dared challenge him again, he thought they were cowards. Of course they backed down for good reason; all his summers were spent reading and practicing spells, hexes, charms, jinxes, anything, just to be better than his father. Studying so he could have an excuse not to visit Teddy in college.<br/>
Apparently his grounding was not working because his Yajirushi 250 took him high in the clear cold air, he felt free. But, he somehow knew at least two seething people would be waiting for him when he got home.<br/>
Instead of riding up to the estate like a dumbass, he touched down nimbley in the trees next to it. James shrunk the money and broom and covered them both up with his invisibility cloak. His father had thought the cloak was in his vault at gringotts. He was wrong.<br/>
The night was cold and vast, the stars shimmered like frost. He waited a couple minutes admiring the spectacle, leaning against an old oak, just thinking. After hiding his possessions he opened the door to his fate.</p>
