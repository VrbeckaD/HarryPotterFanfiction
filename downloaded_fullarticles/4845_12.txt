    <p>‘Granger.’<br/>
Hermione tensed. She knew that voice. That siren’s song. With a deep breath, she steeled herself and swung round on her chair and leant back against the bar, her eyes hardening and turning stern. A slightly pink-cheeked, messy haired Malfoy was slumped between two other equally drunk Slytherins.<br/>
‘Malfoy.’<br/>
The boys took up seats at each of her sides. With another deep breath, she turned back to her drink and tried her best to appear calm. He still made her nervous. She still hated it.<br/>
‘What’s…’ he began, ‘a girl like this bar doing in a girl like you?’ He frowned immediately, though his smile didn’t dissipate. ‘That’s not it…’<br/>
Hermione took a sip of her drink, waiting for tidal of comments about it.<br/>
‘Why take such small mouthfuls, Granger? It’s like you’re convincing yourself to even drink it.’ And there it is. He leaned against the bar, even siting down his balance was suffering.<br/>
‘Why do you care, Malfoy?’ asked Hermione slowly, her nervousness leeching into her tone. Her cheeks felt warm. She tucked her hair behind her ears. Untucked it on a sudden whim it looked awfully stupid. The other boys caught sight of a table of witches across the room, laughing together, all dressed up for the night. Hermione either hoped she could join them or the Slytherins would. She needed the nerves to fade so she could just relax and enjoy her drink.<br/>
‘Well, Granger,’ he said as he sidled closer and the boys wandered over to the table, ‘Girls’ mouths are something I enjoy paying attention to.’<br/>
Hermione leaned away. ‘There are plenty of other girls who don’t know you well enough to fall for that shit, Malfoy. Leave me in peace.’<br/>
He leaned back as if she’d struck him. ‘You wound me.’<br/>
‘Go and lick them elsewhere.’ She returned her gaze to the bar in front of her, her eyes sliding over the bottles of translucent golds and ambers.<br/>
‘Oh I’d prefer it if you did.’<br/>
Hermione coughed to keep from breathing in half her drink.  ‘I nearly choked, you bastard!’<br/>
‘Not a fan of choking? In general or…? I’ll make a note,’ he said, waggling his eyebrows.<br/>
‘Malfoy, do you even know who you’re talking to?’<br/>
He smiled and looked at her deeply, truly, unspoilt by drink. ‘I don’t think people talk to you like this enough.’<br/>
Hermione frowned, her heartbeat rising. ‘You don’t know anything—‘<br/>
He pushed his hair away from his face and sat up, the light catching the heights and dips of his face. It nudged that secret part of her that found him unrelentingly 
attractive.  But he’s a dick. He always was a dick and still continues to be a dick, she reminded herself.<br/>
‘Carpe diem, Granger. That’s what you need.’<br/>
‘How would you know what I need, Malfoy?’ she snapped, as if to counteract her secret appreciation of him. He turned to her. His grey eyes looked black in the low light, 
but it lit his lips to a sumptuous colour.<br/>
‘It’s what I needed.’<br/>
Hermione rolled her eyes. ‘As if you ever stopped yourself from doing things or enjoying whatever it was that you wanted to enjoy. You’ve Carpe di-lifed.’ There was the cocktail, undermining her usual ability to be articulate.<br/>
‘Granger. If that were true, I’d have spent the whole of my time at Hogwarts getting you to like me.’<br/>
Inside, she blanched. Outside, she flushed. Before she could even utter a sound in response, he continued, ‘You gave out your approval, your true approval, not just light friendship, so sparingly that I desired it more than you ever knew. And once I knew I’d truly fucked it, I wanted you some other way. So I was cruel, and biting, and worked out how to get to you because I wanted you to think about me somehow. And I’m sorry.’<br/>
Hermione looked down, her eyes boring into the bar. All she could think to say was ‘Boys are fucking stupid.’<br/>
Malfoy laughed. ‘I know now I should have just apologised and taken interest in what interested you. I mean, even then I still wanted to please my parents and talking to you would do the opposite, but I should have at least repaired my reputation with you, if only by apologising.  So that is why I am Carpe Diem-ing this very day. I’m owning up. I’m laying myself bare.<br/>
And I’m not saying you should Carpe Diem with me, or anyone or whatever. But you’re far too sensible to take Carpe Diem-ing life to its logical conclusion. I just hope that if you follow that line of thought, it affords you what you want to do really. That doesn’t make sense, but you know what I mean.’<br/>
She looked up, biting hard into her own lip, confused with frustration and anger that he could tell her how to live her life, his sincere admission, and even what to do with this suggestion which somehow hit her desire on the head.<br/>
‘In summation, Granger. I want you. I’ve wanted you since I knew how to really want someone. I’m fascinated by all of you. I’m in room number four.'<br/>
And with that, he swung his jacket over his shoulder and disappeared up the Inn’s stairs, leaving Hermione Granger utterly speechless.<br/>
‘Carpe diem, Granger.’</p>
