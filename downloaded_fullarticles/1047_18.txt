    <p>The moment Harry woke up, he knew something was off. It wasn’t that it was his fifteenth birthday (although that was nice), however. Harry sat up and cast his eyes around the room, trying to wheedle out what was wrong. When he couldn't see anything different from the night before, Harry’s ears and tail twitched in distress.</p><p>Harry froze.</p><p>Ears? Tail? <em>...Twitched?</em></p><p>Harry tumbled out of his bed, cursing loudly. Jumping up, he stumbled into the adjoining bathroom, hoping against hope that this was just some awful dream. What he saw made him groan. No such luck, then.</p><p>Slowly, Harry brought his hand up to his hair. Maybe… maybe the mirror was faulty, maybe-</p><p>No. There they were. His fingers gingerly brushed the top of the furry ears, just peeking out from his unruly hair. He suppressed a shiver. The sensations were not… unpleasant. Rather nice, really. Harry shook his head. He didn’t want to deal with that at the moment. And... he didn't have any ears on the <em>side</em> of his head! How was he going to wear his glasses?</p><p>Harry whimpered as he twisted around to look at the other problem. A long, also furry tail protruded out from just above his arse. Currently, it was curled in anguish. Both of these additions were a vibrant orange.</p><p>How had this happened? What <em>was</em> he? Obviously not completely human anymore.</p><p>Harry cocked his head and stared at the reflection. He looked kind of like a cat. But human. Human-cat? Cat-human? Harry didn’t even know anymore. He didn’t want to have to put up with this. He was stressed enough with Voldemort now resurrected. How much was it to ask for just <em>one</em> year of his to go unbothered?</p><p>Harry let out a sigh. He might as well go downstairs. Maybe Hermione would know what he had become. And how to fix the problem of wearing glasses.</p><p>When he got to the kitchen, he meandered at the doorway for a moment. Remus was the one who noticed him first. His nostrils flared, and he turned his head towards Harry. That was the only warning Harry got, before Remus lunged <em>over</em> the table, scattering dishes and glasses.</p><p>Harry yelped, scrambling backwards, bracing himself for Remus to crash into him. It didn’t come. Harry looked up to see Sirius with his arms around Remus’ waist, restraining him. Remus let out a very animalistic sounding growl as he struggled in Sirius’ arms.</p><p>Sirius sent a bewildered look at Harry, who stepped out of the way silently and puzzled, letting Sirius tug Remus through the doorway. Harry caught a whiff of a very dog-like scent as Remus was pulled past. There was a silence for all of five seconds, as everyone still in the room stared at Harry before he broke it.</p><p>“Er…” Harry shifted nervously from foot to foot, eyes darting around.</p><p>Suddenly, he got a faceful of bushy, brown hair. “Oh, Harry! You have ears! And a tail!” Hermione squealed, pulling back and holding him at arm's length, studying him.</p><p>Harry started to run his fingers through his hair, but they caught on his ears. He let out a little sound of mild anger, scowling. “What am I? Like, a cat or something?”</p><p>Ron came up to them, then. “Nah, you’d have whiskers, wouldn’t you?” He said and squinted at Harry's new additions. “Mate, how do you not know what you are? I mean, what happened?” He reached out and touched an ear. Again, Harry fought not to shudder.</p><p>Harry blinked at him. “I don’t know. I just woke up like this. I came down because I thought Hermione would know.”</p><p>They both turned to look at Hermione, who was chewing on her lip in deep thought.</p><p>“I think you might be a fox of some kind,” announced Hermione, staring at Harry’s ears.</p><p>Harry opened his mouth to reply, but someone spoke up from behind him before he could. “Yes, he is. Harry is a kitsune,” a hoarse voice said.</p><p>Harry turned around and skittered backwards once he caught sight of Remus. He smelt slightly different. More human now, than like a wolf. Remus let out a tired smile as if he knew what Harry was thinking. “I’m sorry for how I behaved earlier. I think my werewolf senses caught ahold of your scent and reacted strongly. But yes, you is a kitsune.”</p><p>Harry stared at Remus. “And how come your wolf isn’t reacting now?”</p><p>“I’ve suppressed it,” he said simply and said no more on the subject.</p><p>Hermione cleared her throat. “Can you tell us about kitsune? I’ve read about them in books, but they’re a very secretive species, aren’t they? Nobody really knows much about them.” Her eyes lit up with that familiar, almost manic glimmer that signified the start of an obsession for information.</p><p>“That’s true. Well, let me think.” Remus thought for a minute as if dredging up information about kitsune from deep in his mind. As he was thinking, Sirius steered him towards a chair.</p><p>“When he gets thinking, he’ll forget everything else. I’ve seen him like this before at Hogwarts, when he was doing <em>homework</em>,” Sirius said in a stage whisper. He gave a dramatic shudder as Harry and Ron both laughed, but, of course, Hermione sniffed disapprovingly.</p><p>Remus rolled his eyes and swatted Sirius’ arm. “Okay, so from what I know, those with a kitsune inheritance usually come into whenever their genes deign them ready. Happy birthday, by the way,” Remus added with a fond smile. He opened his mouth to continue, but Harry was bombarded with hugs and exclamations of congratulations (and slight shame for getting so caught up in the drama that they forgot).</p><p>“Anyway,” Remus continued when they were done, smiling indulgently, “a kitsune is rather like a veela, apart from a few major differences. Kitsune originated from Japan, whereas veela came from France. Although kitsune also have an allure, it is much weaker and they rely more on their looks to attract people. I would say it acts more like a suggestion than, you know, forcing someone to like them. They are also very playful and, well, free creatures. It is said that they absolutely despise closed spaces, mainly because of how open and uninhibited they are. Kitsune also have a special way of harnessing their magic that only works for their species, although the wizarding way works for them as well.”</p><p>Hermione stared at Remus with her jaw slightly slack. “How do you know so much about them? You could write a book about them, and tell the world what they are like! Imagine-” She began, but Remus interrupted, his face closing off and going cold abruptly.</p><p>“It is not my information to tell. Kitsunes are a secretive species for a reason. I won’t tell you any more if you keep trying to get me to spill all their secrets. And anyway, there is undoubtly still much I don't know.”</p><p>Hermione opened her mouth angrily to retort back, but Ron laid a hand on her shoulder, restraining her. Hermione blushed. “You still haven’t said <em>how</em> you know so much,” she muttered sulkily.</p><p>“I know someone who is a kitsune. He is a close friend of mine, and he told me about his race, trusting me not to tell anyone, so I implore you not to go around just speaking of this. This is for Harry’s benefit only and I know how much he trusts you,” Remus replied, gazing around the room, making eye contact with everyone until they all nodded. “Kitsune can also turn into foxes at will, like Animagi. The major difference is that kitsune can have multiple tails up to the maximum of, I think, nine.”</p><p>Ron frowned. “How would that work?”</p><p>“It corresponds to their pure magical power. The more magical competence the kitsune has, the more tails they will have when in their fox form.”</p><p>Hermione turned to Harry excitedly, breaking out of her annoyed state once she had heard that. She grasped Harry's arm.</p><p>“Harry, you should try that! We could see your magical strength!” Hermione cried, her eyes glinting.</p><p>Harry looked at Remus who nodded encouragingly. “That would be a good idea,” he agreed.</p><p>“How?” Harry asked and turned to Sirius, who he knew what the only one in that room who could turn into another animal at will.</p><p>Until then, Sirius had stayed mostly silent but now he tilted his head and hummed. “When I turn into a dog, I just concentrate on my form and I don't know, imagine my body shifting.”</p><p>Harry scowled. That wasn’t much to go on, but nevertheless, Harry tried to follow Sirius’ instructions. He closed his eyes and imagined himself as a little orange fox. It made sense for his fur to be orange as a fox since his ears and tail were orange-coloured in human form, as was every other kitsune, he assumed. He thought about how it would feel for his body to morph and shrink into a fox. Harry opened his eyes and peered down at himself. Nothing had changed. His hands were still hands, and his body was still a human body.</p><p>“It didn't work,” Harry said in dismay.</p><p>Ron patted him comfortingly on the shoulder. “It’s okay, mate, you’re only new, anyway. It makes sense for you to not be able to do it on the first try.”</p><p>Harry smiled at them. “Yeah, okay.” It didn’t really matter that much, anyway. Not at that moment. "Er... but do you know how I'm going to wear glasses?"</p><p>In the end, they took Harry to a wizarding optometrist and they gave him contact lenses and - fortunately - not asking any questions about his ears and tail. They all agreed later on that without glasses, Harry did look better anyway.</p><p>Harry Potter, a kitsune. Who would've thought?</p><p>***</p><p>It was incredibly strange going back to Hogwarts as a kitsune. As far as he could tell, he was the only one in the school. And of course, it blew up in the media. The <em>Daily Prophet</em> wrote article after article, speculating and speaking about his ‘condition’, as they put it.</p><p>In Hogwarts, everyone was suddenly clamouring to get his attention. He received so many declarations of love and date askers in the first week, he had Professor McGonagall put a filter on what could reach him through the post. Harry found it amusing that people suddenly found him so much more appealing when he was a different creature.</p><p>But the strangest thing wasn’t the media, nor the other students, but it was that Harry actually <em>enjoyed</em> it. He would flirt openly now with just about everyone, and it was just natural to do so. He supposed this was the kitsune in him acting up, but he couldn’t find it in himself to disagree.</p><p>The other thing that kept his attention, was the new Defense Against the Dark Arts professor, Professor Dolores Umbridge. Everyone had already decided that she was by far the worst teacher they had had. She closely resembled a large toad, and Harry found himself absolutely despising her the moment his eyes caught hers. Strangely, he had the urge to show her how things in Hogwarts <em>should</em> run, and his eyes often subconsciously drifted towards the Weasley twins as he thought up of prank ideas. This, he knew, was most definitely the kitsune influencing him.</p><p>***</p><p>“Harry! Pay attention! And for Merlin’s sake, <em>stop flirting</em>!” Hermione hissed, grabbing Harry’s hand just as he was about to drop in a handful of pulverised foxglove.</p><p>Harry sent one last wink to Lavender Brown who blushed and giggled before he turned back to Hermione and his cauldron. “What?” He said innocently.</p><p>Hermione frowned. “You were about to add the foxglove before the powdered lacewing flies! You should know that it would have caused a mild explosion, Professor Snape told us about that. Even our first-year potions book, Magical Drafts and Potions talked about it, you should remember!” Harry let Hermione’s voice wash over him, humming and nodding at random intervals.</p><p>Suddenly, Hermione fell silent as a shadow descending over the two. “What, may I ask, are you doing, Mr Potter?”</p><p>Harry deigned not to tell him that it was actually Hermione talking, yet the snarky words swirled around his head as he scowled. “Doing my potion, <em>sir</em>,” he muttered.</p><p>“Then why are you holding a handful of <em>foxglove</em> when your potion is still at the stewing stage?” Snape looked down at Harry over his hooked nose.</p><p>“I was… moving it… sir. Er- because I need to add the powdered lacewing flies first otherwise…. It will cause an explosion. A mild one. Uh, you stated that at the start of the lesson and it was also in Magical… Drafts and Potions,” Harry rattled off, searching in his mind for the words Hermione had said.</p><p>Snape stared down at Harry impassively for a moment, before he whirled around and stalked back to the front of the classroom. “Ten points from Gryffindor,” Snape barked over his shoulder.</p><p>Harry opened his mouth to protest but shut it with a click when Snape sneered at him as if just daring him to speak out. Ron had no qualms, however. “What? What did he do?” He squawked. The whole of Gryffindor gave a collective groan.</p><p>Snape turned slowly to smirk at Ron and prowled down to Ron’s table, who paled, probably realising what he just did. “He lost ten points for touching the foxglove first. It could have left residue on his hand, therefore resulting in a chance of some getting into the potion before the lacewing flies are added. And you, Mr Weasley, have just lost another ten points for speaking out of turn. Well?” He demanded. “Anything else to add?”</p><p>Ron shook his head silently. Snape gave a satisfied smirk and swept back to the front again.</p><p>As he did, his robes billowed out around him and disturbed the air. A sweet, cool scent reached Harry’s nostrils, and before he knew it, he was on his feet, the chair clattering to the ground behind him.</p><p>He didn't even know why he did it. All he knew, was that it smelled <em>amazing</em>. Straight away, Harry knew it was another kitsune’s scent.</p><p><em>Is this what kitsune smell like?</em> He thought dizzily, but before he even finished that thought, he knew it wasn't true. It was only <em>that</em> particular scent that smelled so delectable to him.</p><p>He heard someone clear their throat in front of him, snapping him out of his daze.</p><p>“Mr Potter…” Snape growled softly, dangerously. “What do you think you're doing?”</p><p>Harry swallowed, looking around wildly. He <em>had</em> to find that scent. “I… I don't know,” he replied distractedly, nostrils flaring and eyes darting around as he searched for the owner of that sweet, sweet aroma.</p><p>“Do you think yourself so above others that you can just disrupt my class?” He continued, in that same soft voice that promised terrible things. He paused, staring impassively at Harry as he continued to try and search for the mysterious bearer of the fragrance. “<em>And</em> ignore me while I speak? Do you think that now you’re more <em>special</em>, you can act however you want in <em>my</em> classroom?”</p><p>“Uh…” Harry answered coherently. “Um- I’m sorry,” he mumbled, casting his eyes down even as he tried to find the source of the scent.</p><p>“I think another fifteen points and a detention will suffice,” Snape snapped.</p><p>Harry couldn’t wait for the lesson to be over. He could vaguely tell that the scent was coming from one of the Slytherins, but he didn’t know which. None of them met his eye when he glanced searchingly at them. Either they were avoiding looking at him, or just didn’t realise he was staring at them.</p><p>When the potions class was finally over (in which Harry spectacularly destroyed his already mess of a potion), Harry stalked up to the Slytherins as they walked out of the classroom, laughing and talking.</p><p>He stood in front of them as he tried to figure out who it was drawing him in.</p><p>“May we help you, Potter?” Malfoy sneered as they stopped in front of him.</p><p>“Which one of you is it?” Harry demanded. He stared at Malfoy then at Zabini and Nott, Crabbe and Goyle (Harry shuddered to think what it would be like if it was one of <em>them</em>) and two females, Parkinson and Bulstrode.</p><p>Parkinson snorted as she clung to Malfoy’s arm. Harry had the feeling that she would agree with anything Malfoy said, no matter how ridiculous. “Thinking about us, have you?” She simpered, sounding surprisingly much like Umbridge.</p><p>Harry scowled and resisted the urge to gag. “You wish,” he said and turned away. <em>Just one of you. </em>He had already gotten what he came for. For some reason, he couldn’t smell the scent of the other kitsune anymore. He supposed that they had realised he knew they were there, and masked their scent. Harry was extremely frustrated. He <em>needed</em> to know about them!</p><p>But it was okay. At least for the moment, Harry could wait. They would have to reveal themselves eventually, and when they did, Harry would be there, ready and waiting.</p>
