    <span>(Flashback)</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Out in a grassy yard, a pair of small identical red haired boys come to the Trickster laughing.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“We have a discussion and we have game for you Loki” said Fred smiling.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Ok what is it?” said Gabriel smiling.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Guess which one of us is Fred?” said George laughing.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“If I guess right?” said the trickster.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“We’ll be your friends forever” said Fred.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“And if I guess wrong” said Gabriel.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“You do what we want” said George.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Now start!” said Fred.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Gabriel smirks as he knees down to look closely at the twins. He pretended to think as he stands up and walks around looking at the Weasley Twins. Gabriel looks at George.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“...You’re George and you’re Fred” said Gabriel. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“He’s no George I am!” said Fred.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Honestly you called yourself our friend” said George.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Gabriel cross his arms and gives them a smug look which let the twins know that they can’t fool him.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>The twins sighs defeated…</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Just joking I am Fred” said Fred.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“You win” said George.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“You seem to be happy about me winning your game” said Gabriel smiling in comforting way.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“...We’re just glad that for once we found another person who can tell us apart...only our family knows but sometimes </span>
  </em>
  <em>
    <span>they can be easily trick by us</span>
  </em>
  <em>
    <span> and everyone else can’t tell us apart…” said Fred sadly.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Sure it’s fun to trick people... especially about who is who ...</span>
  </em>
  <em>
    <span>but sometimes it’s not funny</span>
  </em>
  <em>
    <span>… sometimes we’re tired of people confusing me for Fred and him for me” said George looking down.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Gabriel smiles at them in assurance.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Loki...How did you know that I’m Fred and he’s George?” asked Fred happily.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>The Trickster laughs as he crosses his arms.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Let’s just say I’m been around twins for several years...out of all of them, </span>
  </em>
  <b>
    <em>each of you two are very special in your own way</em>
  </b>
  <em>
    <span>” said Gabriel as he hug the boys.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>(Flashback ends)</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>George is sitting down carrying Fred as he dries his tears, strokes where his right ear was and looks up to the sky.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <b>Yes</b>
  <span>...” he said sadly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What was that?” said a short man coming to him with a comforting smile.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You heard me....I want him back and then you can use me like a puppet” said George angrily.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No need to be rude to a longtime friend” said Gabriel smiling.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’ll never be your suit until you bring him back” said George angrily.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’ve never seen you so mad...well then since you say yes...alright” said Gabriel.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Everything turns white.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>~~~</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry is in the bathroom puking. He has been feeling strange for the last 3 weeks and 4 days.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What is happening to me?” he said weakly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He gets up from the floor and walks out towards the living room.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>His green eyes widen in surprise at the familiar identical red haired boys. One looking at Harry in concern and the other smiling excitedly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No...that’s not possible” said Harry in shock that Fred is alive.</span>
