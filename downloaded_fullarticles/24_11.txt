    <p>Jamie could taste the iron of her blood in her mouth. It choked her ragged breath. It was hot and stuck to her face, her hair, her throat and her back even as the water from the river of the bank she lay on tugged at her. It was as though the river wished to wash away the horror of that afternoon. Cloudy sleepiness tugged at her mind even as she struggled to open her eyes to the blinding sky. Was she dying? She did not think anyone would be able to survive the fall she had. At least it would be here, under the vast sky with the sweet smell of the cool water at her head and the sound of birdsong to lull her asleep, not up to where she had come from, with his knife and cold taunting words.</p><p>A scampering, shuffling sort of noise sounded to her left, light feet coming closer. And then a soft pair of voices, like the babble of a spring in a thicket. </p><p>“Na- he cuin, mama?”*</p><p>“N- dínen! Im tur- hear hon, Mín must hurrui!”**</p><p>Jamie felt small cold hands at her face, opening her mouth and placing what felt like a finger coated in what tasted like leaf paste on her tongue followed by a trickle of cool crisp water. She swallowed it down, sure she would choke if she did not.</p><p>The small hands left her and she heard light footsteps retreating before her breathing slowed and her whole world went black.</p><p>~ ~ ~<br/>
31 October 1991, 4:37 am</p><p>Waking in a cold sweat, Jamie sat up in bed and wiped her hands down her face. She focussed her breathing as Dr Clarson had taught her. In through the mouth, nice and slow, out through the nose slow and even.</p><p>The mid-autumn night air was cold and dry and exactly what she needed to help her brush away the terror of the night. Shucking the tangled bed sheets and blankets from about herself she got up, reaching for her favourite jumper.</p><p>Two hours from dawn, the night was dark and there was no birdsong but there was little likelihood of more sleep now. </p><p>It was her birthday, her 11th, and while she wished she had been born just a few months earlier so that she would already be at Hogwarts now, there was trepidation and excitement to the early morning. Today she would get her acceptance letter.</p><p>Two and a half years ago when she had first arrived in Britain, her small limbs cold and her scars still tender, her mind had been focussed on one thing: Find Diagon Alley, find the post office, write to Dumbledore. Those had been her mother's words, ones burned into her mind by the panic she had seen on her mother's face. It was something she had to do for herself.</p><p>No doubt, a scrawny, unaccompanied 8-year-old entering the magical post office had been an unusual sight, and the request for someone to help her write and send a letter was even more so; but the staff had been friendly enough and after hearing her message had offered her a handful of peppermints and a pitying look.</p><p>
  <i>“Dear Proffessor Dumbledore.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>My name is James Schwarz and I am 8 years old. My mother was Olivia Schwarz. She always spoke highly of you and of Hogwarts.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>I am writing because my mother died last month and with no direct magical relatives left, I have been placed with some distant muggle relatives the Ministry found who have agreed to be my assigned temporary guardians here in Britain. The man from the Ministry of Magic told me that due to the Statute of Secrecy my temporary guardians could not know of magic at all, even if I turn 11 and go to a school for magic.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>My mother said she did not know if I would be accepted into Hogwarts since while I have British citizenship, being born here, I grew up in West Germany. She told me to write to you to ask, and if I wasn't on the list, to ask if you had any advice for applications to schools in Europe.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>I have already been placed with my new guardians and had to sneak out to send this but will not be able to receive a response from you if you send one by owl so I have included a pre-stamped envelope with my new address.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>I hope this reaches you well, thank you for your time.”<i></i></i>
</p><p>Jamie had caught hell when she had snuck back in through the window of her foster home that morning, but after the explanation that her mother had asked her to send a letter to someone before she died, her guardians had been stumped and muttered something about how they could post anything she needed from then on and that she was never to go out alone again.</p><p>Two days later had brought the morning post. A large envelope (much larger than the one she had enclosed) but stamped and addressed to her in neat loopy scrawl was handed to her. Inside was a letter, expressing the deep regrets of the passing of her mother, an assurance that the Headmaster of Hogwarts himself had gone up to examine the famed Book of Admittance and had found her name there inscribed meaning that a letter of acceptance would be sent to her the morning of the 31st of October, which happened to be her 11th birthday. It also included the application details to Beauxbatons and Durmstrang Institute in the event that she desired to attend those instead.</p><p> The Headmaster had also insisted that when the time came for her acceptance letter to arrive, a member of staff with experience in Muggle environments would come to call to give a Ministry-approved explanation to her guardians as well as to answer any questions she might have and accompany her to Diagon Alley for her school supplies. Last of all the package had included a photograph. It had more than likely once been a magical photograph that moved but the charm had been stripped from the paper. Leaving only a faded black and white of five girls, sat near a lake on a clear sunny day, their robes on the ground beneath them, their shirt sleeves rolled back, all laughing as though their sides were splitting at something the one on the far left had said. The speaker, a girl with brown wavy hair pulled back in a messy bun, a grin that meant mischief and twinkling dark eyes. Her mother.</p>
