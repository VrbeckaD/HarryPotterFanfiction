    <p align="justify">One night, Bellatrix awoke abruptly around two in the morning, unsure at first of what had cause her sudden, complete return to consciousness. She laid still for a moment, eyes still closed, listening to the room. It was then that she heard Hermione’s muffled sobbing, the heartbreaking sound making Bella’s chest ache. Dealing with emotions were still relatively new to Bellatrix, let alone talking about them. She had no idea what to do, and started to panic, entirely bewildered.<em> Come on, Bella. Think. She’s crying...Maybe she had a nightmare? Or maybe she’s upset about something you did...Shit. Just comfort her, you dunce,</em> she commanded herself.</p><p align="justify">Bellatrix shifted, rolling over in bed to shape her small body to Hermione’s. The younger woman jumped, startled by her lover’s touch, but she didn’t pull away. <em>That’s a good sign,</em> Bellatrix thought to herself hopefully. Still uncertain about what to do and doubting herself, Bella clumsily stroked Hermione’s head. Her bony fingers ran through soft, fawn-colored hair as she wrapped her other arm around Hermione, draping her arm over the girl’s waist. Bellatrix didn’t speak, not trusting herself to say the right thing. Instead, she simply held her crying inamorata for the remainder of the night. As the star strewn, inky night sky gave way to the gentle dawn, Bellatrix stilled her soothing caresses and Hermione’s wrenching sobs quieted. When at last the brilliant sun peered over the horizon, it was to find both women sleeping peacefully once again, the elder witch curled around her young love.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">By the time Bellatrix caught up with Hermione the next day, it was late afternoon and the younger woman was curled up in her favorite chair in the library. She was paging through <em>Hogwarts: A History</em>. <em>Dammit</em>, Bella thought. <em>That’s never a good sign.</em> Bellatrix padded quietly over to her, and sat cross-legged on the floor in front of the chair.</p><p align="justify">“Hermione,” the older witch said softly, running her hand up Hermione’s sweatpants-clad leg.</p><p align="justify">“Hmm?” the girl prompted, looking up from her book, her warm brown eyes weary and anxious.</p><p align="justify">“I want to understand what happened last night, love,” Bella stated, woking to keep her voice quiet and her tone questioning. Hermione passed a hand over her face before setting the book down on the coffee table beside the chair. “I’ve been under a lot of stress lately. Yes, more than usual. And when I reach that level of constant anxiety, I lose sleep and become incredibly emotional. You should’ve seen me during O.W.L.s,” Hermione started to explain, rolling her eyes. While Bella waited for her to continue, she shifted so that she was leaning against the chair, resting her head against Hermione’s legs. “You remember a few months ago when I spoke to Harry about you? Things are getting desperate. They’re calling us in, Bella.” Bellatrix couldn’t even bring herself to be angry; her partner just sounded so tired.</p><p align="justify">“The school?” she asked several minutes later.</p><p align="justify">“Yes. McGonagall wrote me and Harry passed on the letter. She says that with Dumbledore gone, it’s getting more difficult to hold the castle. There are so few professors left, the enchantments are weakening. Magic as...advanced and potent as ours would make a significant difference.”</p><p align="justify">“When?” Bella sighed.</p><p align="justify">“I don’t-- I don’t want to force you to declare yourself, love. We’d be safer at Hogwarts than nearly anywhere else, but everything would change for you, and I can’t-- I can’t make you choose, even now.” “Oh, sweetling, the time for choosing has come and gone,” Bellatrix laughed hollowly.</p><p align="justify">“I’m not leading a parade for the virtuous, and if I fight, it’ll be for us and no one else, but I am no longer truly one of His. There’s only so long I can keep that façade up before someone figures it out. You’re going to aid the school with or without me -- don’t give me that look, of course you will -- and I am with you.”</p>
