    <p align="justify">21st July 1990</p><p align="justify">Harry Potter woke up in his cupboard under the stairs, with the inexplicable urge to throw up. This was odd, considering that he had barely eaten anything in the past week, and he usually kept food down for a long time. Nonetheless, it did not seem as though he would last much longer, so he threw all cautions to the wind and sprinted to the bathroom downstairs without getting caught by his relatives - a feat in itself - and retched, hurling whatever was left in his body down the toilet.</p><p align="justify">He washed his mouth after a while, and tentatively drank a few mouthfuls of water from the tap as well. Goodness knew when he would be able to get something to eat, so this was a necessary precaution he took every time he got the chance to use the bathroom. He glanced up at the mirror as he finished up, and almost fell back from the shock. His eyes, which were normally a bright emerald green, had just turned a bluish silver. They looked like storm-clouds, not gemstones. He was sure that his hair hadn't been that long last night, either. Miraculously, his fear growing greater as he watched in horrified fascination, his eyes turned back to green, and his hair returned to its normal length.</p><p align="justify">Deciding the better of revealing this to his relatives, he got out of the bathroom just in time to see his aunt coming down the stairs. She caught sight of him and instantly, her nose wrinkled in disgust. "Get to breakfast, boy, I've got a community lunch to be arranging this weekend," she said stiffly.</p><p align="justify">Sighing, Harry went to work in the kitchen. No sooner had he begun, though, the doorbell rang. It was barely half past seven, and he knew from experience that there should be no visitors at this hour. His uncle would be getting ready for work, his aunt would be going over the latest gossip, and his cousin would be asleep. There would be no one who would come looking for him, considering the fact that he had no friends, and his aunt was his only living relative.</p><p align="justify">"You stay where you are, boy," she snapped, clearly irritated at having her morning routine interrupted. "I'll get that." But Harry sensed that there was a slight trepidation, a sort of apprehension in her voice, as she got up and walked slowly to the front door.</p><p align="justify">Harry caught sight of a whole lot of people standing at the front door, but perhaps the one who seemed to be most eccentric was the tall man with long white hair that reached his waist and an equally long beard, merry blue eyes twinkling behind half-moon spectacles. Behind him stood another tall, aristocratic looking man with platinum blond hair that swept past his shoulders and dark silver eyes. Harry couldn't make out the individual features of the other men that stood behind them. </p><p align="justify">For a long moment, nothing happened. His aunt was transfixed, frozen to the spot. Harry thought she'd gotten paralyzed. Until she screamed. All of a sudden, she was backing away from the doorway, screaming for her husband.</p><p align="justify">"VERNON!!" </p><p align="justify">Vernon Dursley thundered down the stairs, shaving cream slathered generously over all three of his chins, razor in hand, and stopped short at the end of the stairway. This completely blocked the visitors from Harry's view, but as far as he could tell, his uncle hadn't been expecting them either.</p><p align="justify">"Get out of my house!" Vernon bellowed after a split second. Harry fought the urge to cover his ears. "GET OUT! RIGHT THIS INSTANT!!"</p><p align="justify">"We will get out in due time, Mr. Dursley," one of the men said. "But first, there are things that we must discuss with you. So, for the time being, let us assume that you have invited us into your home, unless you wish for the entire street to be privy to this ... ah, scene."</p><p align="justify">Vernon spluttered, and Petunia, who was now cowering next to her husband, seemed to have been rendered equally speechless.</p><p align="justify">"Thank you." The men entered the living room and seated themselves. "Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, if you would please be seated. We have a matter of importance to discuss."</p>
