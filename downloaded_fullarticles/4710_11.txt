    <p>In hindsight, Harry had no idea why or how the phrase left his lips. He didn’t know which of his brain receptors was hit with too many Stupefying charms, but it just kind of slipped out. No, it hadn’t even <em>slipped out, </em>if he really thought about it. Harry had quite literally screamed the words in Draco’s face with no remorse whatsoever. </p><p>It all started on a rainy Thursday afternoon, when Harry was halfway to his Divinations class, his trusty Ron by his side. The two were chatting amicably, when Draco bloody Malfoy stomped by the green-eyed boy, pushing into his side and quite purposely knocking Harry’s- Well, <em>everything</em>- out of his hands. </p><p>Harry felt his jaw clench and his blood start to boil as he instinctively reached out a hand to grip Draco’s wrist before the blonde could slither away like the snake he was. </p><p>The thing was, as much as Harry despised Draco Malfoy with every fibre of his being, some of those fibres seemed to want to lick his neck as well. He blamed it on the stupefy he got during first year. (they lasted a long time, you know?) </p><p><em>Anyway, </em>Harry was angry; and when Harry was angry, he squeezed whatever was in his hands until it bursted. But, right now, it just so happened to be Draco’s wrist that was in his hand. Whoops? </p><p>Draco practically squeaked, the most unmanly noise passing his lips as Harry put a death grip on his dainty, pale wrist. </p><p>“Bloody <em>hell</em>, Potter!”<em> </em>Draco exclaimed in pain, trying to wiggle out of the raven-haired wizard’s grasp. </p><p>Harry slowly released the pressure on Draco’s wrist, but didn’t look any less steamed as he glared at Draco. “And what was that for, Malfoy?” He sneered, nose wrinkling in distaste. </p><p>“No need to go caveman on me, Potter. I was only joking.” Draco mumbled and rolled his eyes, leaning back against the corridor wall lazily. </p><p>Harry narrowed his eyes, his jaw clenched tightly. “You are such an asshole!” He exclaimed, eyes darkened with anger (probably).</p><p>“Bite me, Potter. At least I’m not friends with mudbloods.” Draco smirked lazily, running a hand through his platinum blonde hair. </p><p>Harry growled and pushed Draco up against the wall with his forearm, pressed against his sternum. “Wanna say that again, pretty boy?” He snarled, locking eyes with Draco. </p><p>Draco’s eyes widened for a split second, before they narrowed once more, caught on Harry’s deep green eyes. </p><p>Ron watched on, his jaw practically unhinged from the socket. “Wait... Did you just...? What did you just say?” He asked dazedly. </p><p>Harry didn’t respond, too fueled with anger (and attraction) to respond. He kept the intense gaze with his rival, lips curled back in a snarl. </p><p>Draco’s gaze quickly dropped to Harry’s lips, and then back to his eyes slowly. He bit at his lower lip, swallowing thickly. </p><p>And just like that, everything changed. The angry tension in the air slowly morphed into a sexual tension that could be cut through with a wand. </p><p>Harry moved first, covering Draco’s mouth with his own. It wasn’t a cute first kiss under the moonlight of a thousand stars or some rubbish like that; the kiss was clacking teeth and dueling tongues that didn’t stop to ask for polite entrance. </p><p>Draco made a soft noise into the kiss, curling his fingers into Harry’s messy hair and tilting his head so that they could delve deeper into eachother’s mouths. </p><p>Harry growled slightly, playing with Draco’s lower lip before sucking his tongue back into his mouth in such a filthy way that Malfoy’s hips twitched in an aborted little half-thrust. </p><p>A moan left Draco’s lips, which slowly turned into a whine as he hitched his leg up around Harry’s waist, gasping for air. He pulled the dark-haired boy closer, groaning quietly as he felt Harry’s strong hand grip his thigh and pull him closer. </p><p>Harry ran his hand up and down Draco’s thigh, his fingers digging into the strong muscle there. He wrapped his other arm around Draco’s waist, playing with his tongue and curling the soft, wet muscles together. </p><p>Draco gasped out Harry’s name between hitched, rushed breaths, his cock twitching against the other teen’s. “Harry-“ He whispered as the dark-haired boy swallowed the noise with a growl of his own. </p><p>Eventually, through the fog of overwhelming pleasure, Harry heard someone clear their throat loudly. It didn’t appear to be the first time, and the throat-clearing kept getting louder.</p><p>The Boy-Who-Lived tore away from Draco, lips swollen, eyes dark and ravenous, and breath coming out harshly. “What?” He snapped, turning to face Ron.</p><p>Only then did he realize that they had an audience; and a large one, at that. Girls and guys alike were watching with wide eyes, whispers spreading through the crowd. </p><p>Harry’s cheeks flushed pink as he looked around, and then to Ron, who was also a funny shade of red. </p><p>“Uh... I’ll see you later, Draco.” Harry said slowly, turning back to the boy and giving him a once-over with his eyes. </p><p>Draco let out a shaky breath, looking thoroughly debauched and out of breath (Not unlike some of the witches and wizards in the crowd around them). He nodded quickly and pulled Harry down by his collar, breath hot on his ear. “Prefect’s bathroom. Nine, tonight.” </p><p>Harry shivered and nodded quickly as the other boy leaned away slowly. Their eyes met once more, and unspoken filthy promises passed through their gaze. He gave the blonde a tiny smirk before leaning away completely, fixing his disheveled clothing. “See you later, Draco.” He repeated, confidently this time. </p><p>“See you, Harry.” Draco murmured in response, making himself look presentable. He glanced around the crowd before snapping: “What <em>are </em>you all staring at? Bugger off.” He cocked a brow and stomped off, head high like any other Malfoy. </p><p>Harry grinned a bit to himself, his mind running wild with possibilities for later that night. His lips were still tingling from the intense kissing as he gave Ron a dazed smile. </p><p>For the first time in his life, Harry was happy that his verbal filter had malfunctioned so beautifully. Tonight was going to be amazing; he could feel it. The Slytherin and the Griffindor. Harry and Draco. </p><p>The thought made him smile.  </p>
