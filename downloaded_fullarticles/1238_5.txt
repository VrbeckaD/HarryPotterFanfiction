    <p>The sun was warm on his face as Harry stood staring down the muddy, winding, pockmarked path that guided the way to The Burrow. The ramshackle building stood out against the overgrown lush green grass on either side, three stories tall with a slight lean to it, much like the Tower of Pisa. It warmed his heart to see the Weasley home again, it had been five long years since he'd been here. He took a deep, steadying breath and made towards it. He never remembered the walk taking so long but then again, he'd never had as much guilt weighing on him when he'd visited either. It crushed down on him, making each step of his buckled, dragon-hide boots that much heavier. <em>Crunch-crunch-crunch. </em>Before he knew it, Harry was opening the worn, latched gate and a familiar screech of metal reached his ears as it swung open.  <em>Home</em>.</p><p>The aroma of Molly’s delicious cooking wafted across the yard and ensnared him, it made his mouth water. God, how long had it been since he'd eaten? Moscow? No, he'd eaten in Berlin after the last jump, apparating beside a small café he knew and almost passing out from hunger and fatigue. He knew better that to try and cover that much distance on an empty stomach and an hours’ sleep. Still, he hadn't splinched himself somehow which was the main goal. The grass to his left rustled and Harry smiled. He could hear two tiny voices growling at each other and knew that the gnomes still called The Burrow home. It reminded him of Bill and Fluers wedding, about how excited Luna and her father had been when she'd told him one of the gnomes bit her. <em>They're an odd pair</em> Harry thought to himself <em>I wonder what she's doing now?</em></p><p>The wooden house seemed to loom up suddenly before him, much sooner than he'd anticipated, causing fear-sweat to trickle down his spine and down into his pants. It wasn't his best idea, rocking up unannounced on Christmas Day, considering that no one had heard so much as a peep from him since he disappeared that foggy morning in March. That was the way it had to be though; some demons needed to be faced alone. Enough people had died in his name as it was, he wasn't about to let Char-<em>them </em>join the ranks of ghosts that followed him. It seemed all too soon that he was face to face with the front door, hand raised in preparation to knock. Another bead of sweat slipped down his neck; it was going to be one of those days…</p><p>A clear pearl of child’s laughter rang out through the open window, innocent and carefree in way that harry had never been, or ever would be. It was a girl’s laugh, which meant it wasn’t Teddy. It wasn’t his godson, whose father he’d promised to take care of, promised to make sure was happy and healthy. Just another broken vow the Boy-Who-Conquered owned. He carried the faces of Remus and Tonks around with him too, their dead eyes saddened by the man he’d become. The laugh rang out again and it cut harry down to the bone, right into the seething cauldron of guilt and shame that boiled at his core. Bill’s daughter maybe? Ron and Hermione’s?</p><p>He should just leave. Turn around and flee with his tail between his legs like the dog he was. No one ever had to know he’d even been here today, if anyone had known where he was at any given point in the last five years, they would’ve come; trying to drag him back into the world that heralded him a hero and expected yet more impossible things from him, like they always did. Like <em>he </em>did. Albus <em>fucking </em>Dumbledore, the man who schemed and planned, never telling Harry about the real horrors that awaited in his future, just expected him to be a good little boy and do as he was told. The man who could’ve destroyed Voldemort before he’d gained enough power to be a threat, but chose not to act; Leaving it instead to an already tormented teenager, who cared what Harry wanted right?  </p><p>Nope, no. <em>Fuck this</em>. He couldn’t do it. Life living under the radar and occupying some of the foulest places in existence might not have been glamorous, but at least it was <em>his </em>life. Everyone probably assumed he was already dead anyway. He turned away from the doorway back into family, took three steps and froze. When he finally looked up, the one person on earth he didn’t want to run into stood staring at him from a few paces away. His breath hitched and his heart expanded so quickly it felt like his ribcage was going to explode.</p><p>“So, still a fucking <em>coward </em>I see?” Charlie greeted him icily, taking a drag of his cigarette and glaring at him with such fire in his eyes that Harry thought he might spontaneously combust on the spot.</p><p>“Charlie!” He yipped, his voice raising several octaves against his will.</p><p>The man looked just as gorgeous as Harry remembered him. His amber hair glimmering in the mid-morning sun above his piercing sapphire eyes, pools so blue that Harry had spent hours getting lost in them. The rugged planes of his face were well tanned, cheeks and wide jaw covered in a thin day-old growth. Harry cursed internally as he took in the deep green button-up Charlie was wearing, it clung to him in the all the right places, straining obscenely over his wide shoulders, thick chest and ripped arms before tapering down at his waist. His dark jeans looked as though Charlie had to be poured into them. His dick gave a twitch against his will.</p><p>“Hmmm, so you do remember my name them?”  </p><p>“What? I, yeah, of course I remember your name”</p><p>“Oh I see” Charlie growled taking a step forward “so it's just that you forgot how to write? Or send an owl? Apparate? Portkey? Floo?”</p><p>“No Charlie, it’s just-” any explanation Harry had was lost, he cast his eyes down to the dirt where he belonged. He flinched with each step Charlie took, slowing drawing nearer until at last he was beside him.</p><p>“<em>Look</em> at me Harry James” Charlie commanded and Harry let out a soft groan at the private endearment. Seven years on and it still made him feel like a teenager stealing his first kiss in an empty classroom. He looked up and met the steely-blue gaze of his ex and his heart raced.</p><p>“You had your reasons, whatever the <em>fuck </em>they were, for abandoning me and your family” Harry's insides churned as the truth of it cut him like glass “but what I do know, is that it is Christmas Day and nothing would make mum happier than seeing you. The way I see it, you've got two options. One, you come inside with me. You apologise to everyone for making the last five years of our lives hell and take your lashes like a man”</p><p>“Or?” Harry asked, already knowing the answer.</p><p>“Or I go inside alone and tell everyone in that house that you took off again, without so much as a hello” Charlie's eyes darkened with the threat “I'll also tell them that you'll never be darkening our doorstep again. <em>Ever</em>. It's your decision”   </p><p>He shoulder checked Harry on the way past hard enough to make him stumble and Harry caught a whiff of his scent; earth and spice, the scent of the wood smoke that came from working with dragons that never washed off no matter how many times Charlie bathed. Harry felt a pang of longing rip through him and followed Charlie inside the house. There was no real need to make a decision, Harry had already made it when he'd crossed three continents and landed at the The Burrows boundary.</p><p>"Charlie? Is that you?” Molly's voice called above the hum of conversation in the kitchen.</p><p>“Yeah mum it's me” he replied stepping into the doorway, greeted by a chorus of hellos “sorry I'm late, I ran into someone outside that I thought you'd like to see”</p><p>“Really?” Arthur's voice was surprised “who?”</p><p>Charlie jerked his head in their direction. Harry took a breath, two steps forward and smiled at the kitchen full of people. The room became deathly silent and still, a mass of shocked faces stared blankly at him until Molly finally broke the tension.</p><p>“<em>Harry</em>!” She breathed as though she couldn't believe her eyes and got up from her chair, waving him over.</p><p>A strong hand grabbed his shoulder and Harry turned to its owner. Charlie's jaw twitched and something flashed behind his eyes, to brief for Harry to recognise before he finally spoke; wand pointed directly at his heart “Almost forgot, wouldn't do well if I just let you into the house and you turned out to be an imposter”  </p><p>“I'd expect nothing less” Harry replied unfazed, he would've been angry if Charlie hadn't checked.</p><p>“What was the last question Arthur Weasley asked Harry Potter and what was his answer?”</p><p>Harry's throat tightened and he had to force the words out “’So what will Charlie be afterwards, Harry?’ And my reply was ‘it will mean that he is Lord Weasley-Black, he'll share my formal title after we're hitched’”</p><p>Charlie's eyes never left Harry's face, even when Ron's shocked gasp came from behind them, he lowered his wand and cleared his throat as tears welled up in his eyes “for what it's worth, I'm glad you're not dead”</p><p>With that he turned and headed up the stairs, a door on the second landing slamming closed behind him.</p><p>“Hi Mrs Weasley” Harry said thickly turning back to redhead woman “it’s good to see you”</p><p align="center">~</p><p>Harry was momentarily blinded by the sunlight as the heavy oak door swung open when he barrelled through it. He saw a moment of blue before he crashed down on his hands and knees, drawing in great heaves of air, trying to clear his mind and ease the suffocating feeling in his chest. It was doing little to help and the world under him was starting to white out.</p><p>“Harry!” A voice from his left yelled sharply.</p><p>It distracted him for only a moment, but it was long enough. His gut clenched violently and he felt the burn of stomach acid make its way up his throat. He coughed violently and emptied his stomach.</p><p>“Good lad” the same deep voice said from beside him and a large hand started rubbing circles on his back “let your body do what It needs to”</p><p>He was still retching, but it was beginning to ease along with the paralysing fear that had ratcheted up inside him only minutes ago. It wasn't the first time he'd had this kind of debilitating attack since the battle and it wouldn't be the last. Everywhere he turned in the castle he saw the dead. Broken, lifeless bodies that had long been removed from the halls stalked him at every turn, screaming for answers that he couldn't give. He didn't know why they had to die, or why they couldn't stay with their families any more. He told them, screamed at them for forgiveness but still they asked the same question: <em>Why me, Harry?</em></p><p>No one had warned him about the <em>stench</em> that came with war. The dead and decaying odour that clung to the ancient walls of the castle, like a viscous cloud hell bent on working its way inside of him, attempting to rot his body and mind from within. It was like a thing alive, looking for its next victim, not sated with the dead it had already collected.</p><p>After a few minutes his stomach gave its last twitch and control of his limbs slowly returned, his knees ached and his throat burnt from the bile. He spat a few times and blew his nose on to the stone beneath him to clear out the smell.</p><p>“Quite the charmer aren't you Harry?” A voice commented from above followed by a gruff chuckle.</p><p>Harry looked up and squinted, framed in the afternoon sun stood Charlie Weasley beaming at him.</p><p>“What can I say? I'm a class act” Harry replied, cautiously getting to his feet and drawing his wand “Evanesco” he murmured and his vomit vanished.</p><p>Charlie snorted and waved him over. Harry joined him and lent against the cool stone, his eyes sweeping over the green grass of the castle lawns as he focused on steadying his breathing.</p><p>“Alright?” Charlie asked without looking at him.</p><p>“Oh yeah” Harry replied sarcastically “I've just defeated the darkest wizard in history, god knows how many of my friends died fighting and I couldn't stop it. Everybody keeps asking me what happens now and I don't have any <em>fucking clue</em>, so yeah! I'm bloody <em>peachy</em>! Thanks for asking”</p><p>A silent minute passed between the pair, the only sound was Harry's heavy breathing. Charlie finally turned to look at him, one eye brow raised questioningly.</p><p>“Better?”</p><p>“A little” Harry said quietly, his face heating with shame. He'd not meant unleash on Charlie like that “I'm sorry mate, I didn't mean to go off at you”</p><p>“You we're gonna do it eventually” Charlie drew a cigarette from his pocked and lit it “better me than someone who might take offence to it eh?”</p><p>“Cheers” Harry sighed staring out over the castle once more. The place was in shambles, piles of rubble from half collapsed walls dotted the grounds. By the lake there was an orange glow, the fires for the dead giants and other beasts were still burning. <em>So much death</em>.</p><p>“I ah…I never got a chance to say-”</p><p>“<em>Don't</em>” Charlie breathed “I've heard it enough over the last few days” he turned to face Harry, mouth drawn tight “I suspect I want to hear the words ‘sorry for your loss’ about as much as you want to hear one more ‘thank you for saving us Harry’”</p><p>“Point taken” Harry replied mildly surprised, he never took Charlie for being so insightful. It was a welcome change of pace.</p><p>They stood in silence for the next half hour, Charlie taking soft drags on cigarettes, their arms occasionally brushing together.  Both of them taking solace in the brief respite from the chaos and misery within the castle walls that threatened to break them, maybe it already had in some ways.</p><p>“When was the last time you slept?” Charlie asked quietly “properly I mean”</p><p>“When I was about fourteen I think” Harry deadpanned “you?”</p><p>“Department of Mysteries” Charlie grunted and it surprised Harry that he was so open “when it all became real. I always believed you, that he was back, but something about that night changed the game completely”</p><p>“Sirius” Harry supplied “his death changed everything”</p><p>“He was a good man, your godfather” Charlie praised “don't ever forget it”</p><p>“So was Fred” Harry offered, placing his hand on the back of Charlie's neck as the burly man let silent tears slide down his face “not a day will go past that I won't remember him or any of them. They deserve that much”</p><p>Somewhere inside the castle a bell tolled to signal it was time for dinner.</p><p>“C’mon mate” Charlie nudged him, wiped his face and turned towards the door “we can't avoid the masses forever”</p><p>“Why not?” Harry groused falling into step beside the older man.</p><p>“Because right now isn't about you, or me or any one individual” Charlie explained in a subdued voice as they descended the stone steps “it's about the collective pain and fear that our entire community is going through. We came so close to total annihilation Harry and now we must find a way to rebuild, <em>again</em>. I know it's not fair on you, you've done more than any one teenage boy should have to do, but right now the wizarding world needs to see you”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“You know why mate” Charlie said rounding the corner and stepping into the hallway.</p><p>“Because I'm the Boy-Who-Conquered” Harry sighed and felt the truth of Charlie's words. The mantle of saviour was and always would be his alone. Voldemort had marked him since birth; this was his cross to bear.</p><p>“That's right. People need to rally around Lord Potter once more”</p><p>“Lord Potter?” Harry chuckled bumping Charlie's shoulder “you're a knob mate”</p><p>“Well it is your title after all” Charlie grinned, blue eyes twinkling.</p><p>“Charlie…” Harry said coming to a stop “what <em>are</em> you on about?”</p><p>“You're the last of the Potter line Harry. Not to mention you're Sirius’s named heir” Charlie supplied staring at him “I know things were a bit crazy when you came of age but once the world gets back to normal I expect you'll need to sign the paperwork at the ministry and assume your full inheritances”</p><p>“Oh for fucks sake” Harry replied and Charlie laughed. Didn't he have enough titles already to be going on with?</p><p>“Lord Harry Potter” he bowed and winked mischievously.</p><p>“Don't you <em>dare</em>” Harry hissed fighting the urge to punch Ron's brother “I'll always just be Harry to you and your family Charlie. <em>Always!</em>”</p><p>“Well come on then” Charlie slung a muscled arm over his shoulders “let’s go get something to eat ‘just Harry’”</p><p>That time Harry did punch him.</p><p align="center">~</p><p>His day with the Weasley's had gone much better than expected he thought as he dropped into a chair beside the fireplace, even after all this time he still marvelled that one could have a fireplace in a tent. Muggles had no idea what they were missing out on.</p><p>Molly had been tearful as expected, pulling him into a bone crushing hug the minute Charlie went upstairs and didn't release him for a solid five minutes, apologising profusely for making a scene. Arthur had greeted him with a stiff hello and a pat on the shoulder. Ginny had let out a hair-raising snarl, gotten up and left the table, She hadn't returned for the rest of the day. Harry didn't blame her, there was always a fifty-fifty chance she'd never forgive him.</p><p>Hermione had been the next to greet him, such as it was. She was visibly tense as Harry lowered himself into the vacant chair beside her at Molly's urging. When she finally turned to look at him, she slapped him across the face hard enough to make his ears ring. Then she did it again before turning back to Percy and drawing him into an exceptionally dull conversation about ministry business. Over her shoulder, Ron looked at him and shrugged as if to say (honestly mate, what did you expect?) and gave him a warm smile. He reached across the back of her chair and clapped a hand to his shoulder in quiet solidarity.</p><p>Everyone else had been remarkably amicable for the rest of the day, the only exception being George, who kept glancing at Harry with a look on his face that he couldn't identify.</p><p>“Harry? Can we come in?” Bills voice called from the entrance to the tent, drawing him back into the present.</p><p>“Yeah Bill, of course” Harry said looking up as Bill, Arthur and George entered the tent.</p><p>“Hiya Harry” Bill greeted.</p><p>“Hey” Harry replied, “what's up?”</p><p>“I've come to ask a favour” it was Arthur who spoke “if that's ok?”</p><p>“Sure, Mr Weasley. Anything for you”</p><p>“If it's ok with you, I'd like you to accompany me to the ministry in the next week or so” Arthur asked rubbing his neck “just to clear up a few things”</p><p>“Oh”</p><p>“It'll be nothing to do with where you've been” Arthur's voice was strained. No one had questioned him about his absence during the day and Harry had been quietly grateful “it's a formality more than anything, just to ah, prove…well you see…”</p><p>“Harry” Bill interrupted gently looking from his father back to Harry “we need you to come to the ministry so that they know you're alive”</p><p>“Oh” Harry said taken aback “yeah, I…sure”</p><p>“There was an investigation into your…absence” Bill continued on awkwardly “it's pretty standard you understand? But during the course of the inquiry, Charlie was questioned”</p><p>“Ok…”</p><p>“Like I said, it's protocol” Bill explained “however, there was a…complication. Someone and <em>god </em>knows why, leaked the information to a reporter at the Prophet”</p><p>“Fuck” Harry sighed “sorry Mr Weasley”</p><p>“Quite alright Harry” Arthur replied with chuckle “you can imagine how she played it? Two young wizards, passionately in love. They have a fight and one of them loses control; that Charlie had been after your money and you'd refused to give him any”</p><p>“It was nothing like that!” Harry spat rising from his chair.</p><p>“<em>We </em>know that mate” Bill soothed “the <em>ministry</em> knows it, there was no hard evidence to prove it, but it was the implication. Tongues wag and all that, it…it was not a good time for Charlie, Harry. ”</p><p>“Bloody hell” Harry sighed and shook his head “I'm so sorry. It never occurred to me”</p><p>“Yes, well” Arthur cleared his throat “as long as we can clear Charlie's name within a few weeks of your return it'll be fine”</p><p>“We’ll go tomorrow Mr Weasley” Harry said stepping forward and meeting his gaze “can you organise a meeting with Kingsley and I?”</p><p>“Absolutely” Arthur replied with wide eyes “thank you Harry”</p><p>“There's nothing to thank me for, it should never have happened in the first place” he said hugging him before pulling back, a question burning in his mind “you said ‘she’, who started the rumour”</p><p>“Rita Skeeter” George supplied from the corner, his face mutinous.</p><p>“That <em>bitch” </em>Harry growled, balling his fists “she’ll regret the day she ever <em>fucking </em>crossed me again. I'll have her head! I think it's high time the ministry found out she's an unregistered animagus”</p><p>Harry's anger dissolved as Arthur pulled him into a tight hug and whispered a ‘thank you’ into his shoulder. Harry returned the hug.</p><p>“Well then” Arthur cleared his throat “I think I'm going to turn in. Good night Harry”</p><p>“G’night Arthur” a smile crossed the older man's face as he waved goodbye and exited the tent.</p><p>“I'll turn in too I think” Bill said yawning “it's been a-”</p><p>Bill cut off as George crossed the room in a few short strides, wrapped his arms around Harry and began crying violently, his entire body shaking against Harry's as he struggled to hold the older man upright.</p><p>“George?” Harry asked tentatively, wrapping an arm around his back.</p><p>“Y-y-you left” George howled into his shoulder “we had no i-idea where you'd gone! I thought you were d-dead. And F-f-Fred had died and I c-couldn't handle it, d-didn't want to keep going if you w-w-were gone too”</p><p>“George” Harry said thickly, tears stinging his eyes “I'm so sorry, I never meant to hurt you guys”</p><p>“I know. You h-had to do whatever it was” George’s voice began to steady “but I'm glad you're back. I m-missed you. You are back, aren't you?”</p><p>“Yeah mate” Harry assured, looking into the pained eyes of the remaining twin and kissing him on the forehead “I'm back”</p><p>“Alright then” George cleared his throat and smiled weakly “g’night Harry, Bill”</p><p>Harry watched him go and tried to ignore the guilt burning through him. He'd been an idiot to assume it was just Charlie he’d hurt by vanishing that day.  </p><p>“Fucking hell” Bill said turning back to Harry with wide eyes and running his hand through his hair.</p><p>“You're telling me” Harry replied, “that was a bit full on”</p><p>“Mmmmm” Bill murmured “that's the first time…he hasn't said Fed’s name since the battle”</p><p>Bill left without another word and just a casual wave, leaving Harry standing alone and feeling like the biggest asshole that had ever lived.</p>
