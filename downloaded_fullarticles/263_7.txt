  <em>The crashing sounds of feet stumbling through the woods blindly couldn't cover the panting breath and gasps. Strips of moonlight filtered through the tree branches, dappled across the brush and vines that tangled around his feet. It would have been a beautiful sight if it hadn't been for the jeering and vile words he could still hear behind him. Tears stung at his eyes as he struggled to get away, a ball of dread settling in his stomach. His sneaker caught on something - a rock, a vine, maybe a broken branch - and there was a loud popping sound as he tumbled down into the still moist dirt and decaying leaves. Insects were buzzing happily in the muggy evening air and it felt as if his entire senses were flooded by those horrid sounds for a few seconds before a burning pain shot through his ankle and he was crying out in agony. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Hearing the voices get louder and the laughter, Sirius did his best to clamp his mouth shut and move via a desperate crawl. It was hopeless. He couldn't outrun them with two good legs, so how did he plan to get away with a potentially broken ankle? Mud smeared across his face as he brushed away the frightened and pained tears, desperate for any escape. Please, there had to be a way out of this!</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"H-help," he whispered into the dirt, arms and lungs burning. "Help me."</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The snapping of a twig and the shuffle of brush from ahead startled the young man and when he looked up all sense of hope seemed to vanish completely on the spot. A snarling snout painted by moonlight appeared, the drool dripping ominously, and golden eyes fixed right on his trembling figure. There was no running now.</em>
</p><p>**</p><p>Regulus' hand was tightly clasped in his under the table as they sat quietly at the restaurant where Mother and Father would be meeting with them. Sirius was sweating already and Regulus looked like he might be sick at any moment. This had been a terrible breech in protocol for greeting their parents at the end of the school term, but it had been the only way that Sirius could work out that would minimize humiliation and maximize the potential for protection against the physical assaults that he would undoubtedly endure otherwise. James and his parents were eating at a table not far away as backup, but it barely assuaged his fears. He could feel the tremble in Regulus' fingers.</p><p>"I love you, Reggie," he whispered softly as he caught sight of a familiar elegant updo being directed towards them from across the room. "It doesn't matter what they say, I love you."</p><p>"M-me too."</p><p>Sirius nodded before offering one last warm squeeze and pulling his hand away. He rubbed the clammy sweat onto his trousers before he and Regulus stood at the appearance of their Mother and Father at the table. He could see the confusion on their faces before the frightening blankness brushed across their beautifully sculpted features. Those stone faces did not endear hope for how this would all turn out. The waiter took their orders for drinks as Walburga took a seat first and the rest followed. Her eyes were sharper than the razor blade Sirius had gotten well acquainted with this past year. None of them spoke until after the waiter came with the drinks and took their lunch orders. It was all fake smiles and polite words, a dangerous warning, before he was gone and the two stern eyes were leveled on him.</p><p>"What is the meaning of this?" Orion demanded, the quietness of his volume not removing the edge from his words.</p><p>He had been preparing for this moment for months, but all those carefully practiced lines took flight and left him with a terrified and empty brain. "Um, w-well-"</p><p>"You are not a filthy pauper," Walburga snapped in agitation. "Blacks do not <em>stammer</em>."</p><p>Sirius could already feel his resolve crumbling away like a stick of chalk left out in the summer rain. What was he thinking? How could he do this? His eyes glanced over to Regulus and he could see that his brother was sweating and staring firmly at the napkin on his lap. Looking back up, he could see James glancing over worriedly from his own seat several tables down.</p><p>"If this is another one of your ridiculous attempts to test our patience with your rebellion, Siri, then let me go ahead and put a stop to this." Orion was speaking again, each syllable like the stamp of law being etched into stone. "You are far too old to be doing this and your mother and I have run out of patience."</p><p>"I'm not...it's not that...." Swallowing thickly, he focused his her nervous energy into twisting the cloth napkin tightly. "Mother, Father, this is who I am."</p><p>"The cunt between your legs says otherwise," Walburga hissed cruelly, "and no amount of playing dress up will change that. Your disgusting display is offensive and we expect you to leave her before the food is served and come back dressed in something befitting your status as our eldest daughter."</p><p>It wasn't that he had exactly expected them to welcome him with open arms, but the verbal jabs still cut deeply. It had taken him weeks to settle on which of James' old suits to use, tailoring it to his measurements. The visual image of having to throw it in the garbage bin and put on another one of those stifling, anxiety inducing dresses was almost enough to make him cry.</p><p>"N-no, Mother," he whispered, consciously trying to keep their conversation private. Blacks didn't air their dirty laundry for others to see. "This is who I am. I'm claiming my full name, Sirius Orion Black and I'm claiming my correct gender. I'm a boy."</p><p>Orion gave Walburga a heated glare before turning it towards Sirius. "You know that your name was based on tradition. It was not intended to give you delusions of being what you are not. Regulus is our son and you are our daughter."</p><p>"You named me that because mother just knew that I was a boy!" Sirius insisted, still careful to keep his voice appropriately low. "She could tell that I was a boy in the womb and she was right! Even if you named me something like Andromeda, that still wouldn't change the fact that I'm a boy!"</p><p>"It was a foolish mother's mistake," Walburga jumped in. "Intuition is nothing against <em>facts</em>, Siri, and you cannot change the facts of your biology."</p><p>"This is the last time that I will ask politely," Orion warned, his Asian eyes further narrowed in anger. "Go downstairs and get out of that ridiculous get up before joining us for lunch."</p><p>He felt the napkin tear a little, finally giving way to the pressure. Desperate grey eyes found James again, knowing that he needed the strength that only his best friend could provide. "N-no. This is who I am."</p><p>It felt as if the whole room dropped 20 degrees. Walburga's words were cold and concise. "You will be completely cut off from our family. We will not tolerate this depravity! You will not be sullying this family's esteemed name!"</p><p>"You may leave the table now," Orion commanded, his words falsely sweet. "And I expect you to never come back. Even if you get over this little phase, we are through with you, Siri."</p><p>All his years of learning to hide his true emotions seemed to have been for this very moment as he stood up and politely bowed to the both of them. "Thank you for your time," he muttered before shakily staggering out towards the door. </p><p>One step in front of the other and repeat. Over and over until he was outside in the sweet spring air that had a bit of heat to it. Summer was moving in quickly this year. His legs seemed to be unable to support him anymore and he would have tumbled right into the cement if strong lanky arms hadn't wrapped around him.</p><p>"It's okay, Sirius," James whispered as he began sobbing. "It's okay, man. Mom and Dad will be out in a sec and we can go home, okay?"</p><p>"Let's g-go home," Sirius sobbed, trying to cry out those damning words.</p><p>**</p><p>"Please enjoy the game!" Sirius uttered as enthusiastically as possible. He was afraid that his plastered on smile was going to crack any minute and that he wouldn't be able to keep up with the cheerful front door attendant persona. It had been a terrible day for his anxiety, but he needed the money. Another couple moved forward and he rang them up for seats before again wishing them a good game. </p><p>Thankfully, a familiar voice broke through his shaky mental state. "Hey, Sirius! Let's switch places!"</p><p>"<em>Thank you</em>!" He breathed against James' shoulder and the taller boy laughed. </p><p>"I could see the vein throbbing at your temple from across the room!" he teased. "Peter's still at the concessions table if you want to try to swap with him."</p><p>"Nah, I think I'll stick with ushering." He took a deep breath and released it slowly. "Most people know where they're going anyway."</p><p>James patted him on the cheek affectionately before cheerfully greeting the next customer up. Sirius walked over to the concession stand to get a soda before moving towards his position as an usher. The local baseball team had a decent following and had been around for so long that most everyone was attending the game had already come to one before and was familiar with the layout. The most he usually had to do was help an elderly man or woman down the steps and make sure that the highschoolers weren't littering. </p><p>Slurping on his cherry berry root beer (a Peter Pettigrew specialty) he stood at the appropriate entrance, nodding kindly to the people walking past but keeping himself relatively obscure. It was definitely weird to be spending his summer break in America rather than back home in Singapore and not for the first time he ached for the delicious food and the varied pool of languages. Here in the strange Ozarks region, there was basically just English. Around the Universities he was more likely to catch Standard Mandarin or Hindi or even Bengali, but usually over the summer foreign exchange students would have returned home so they didn't often appear at these games until near the end of the season. The scent of grilled hot dogs couldn't really compare to his favorite hawker stalls.</p><p>"Pardon, could you help me find my seat?"</p><p>Sirius inhaled his soda down the wrong tube and had to cough embarrassingly for a minute before he looked up with watery eyes to see the most handsome man he had ever seen in his short 16 years of life. Red painted his cheeks even more deeply as he wiped the spittle from his chin with the back of his hand and he forced words out through his sore throat. "Er, yes, absolutely. Sorry, that was gross."</p><p>The young man grinned and just shook his head like he didn't care. "My seat?"</p><p>"Um, yeah, let me see that ticket." Their fingers brushed as he took the ticket and he had to stifle down a squeal of delight. Peeking from under his eyelashes he took in the golden brown skin, the dirty blond curls, the hazel eyes. All perfectly delicious and wrapped up in a body taller than him. "Y-your seat is over this way," he croaked, still wearing a deep blush. </p><p>"Thanks...?"</p><p>"Oh, Sirius. Like the star."</p><p>The boy looked amused and Sirius wondered if maybe he should have picked another name to go with when he started his transition. "Okay. Thanks, Sirius. How's that spelled? I'm shit at astronomy."</p><p>"S-I-R-I-U-S." He was wandering past his designated ushering area, but he didn't want to let someone else help this gorgeous boy out. "What's your name?"</p><p>"Didn't you see it on the ticket?" he teased and Sirius jerked his head to look down at the ticket only to frown in confusion.</p><p>"Lily?"</p><p>The boy laughed and shook his head. "I'm just teasing. That's my friend who bought the tickets. I'm Remus."</p><p>Sirius laughed too, relieved that he hadn't messed up. "You're a cheeky bastard," he teased in response, shoving his shoulder lightly into the other. Remus gave him a million dollar smile and he was sorely disappointed that they finally came up to the seats. "Well, here's your seat. It's 3, right next to the young lady. See the metal plate at the top...yeah, right there."</p><p>Remus turned and gave him a final crooked grin. "Thanks for your help."</p><p>"Enjoy your game," he replied warmly. </p><p>Feeling decidedly better about the day, Sirius skipped up the cement steps and made his way back to his drink and his post.</p><p>**</p><p>Severus Snape and Sirius Black had never gotten along much which only made it more awkward as the lanky boy held out the crisp cardstock invitation. Sirius stared at him suspiciously. "What's that for?"</p><p>Severus rolled his eyes. "You don't recognize the Malfoy crest? Aren't you supposed to be rich like them?"</p><p>Sirius bristled. "My cousin's marrying the git, not me! Why would I care about stuff like that?"</p><p>The other boy sighed in annoyance. "Look, I just wanted to deliver this. Take it so I can get back to my side of the stadium."</p><p>"What's it for?" Sirius pressed again.</p><p>"It's an invitation for Lucius' bachelor party." This made the disgraced Black's jaw drop. "I think he said something about Narcissa twisting his arm about it."</p><p>"A bachelor party?" he whispered, taking the invitation and tearing off the wax seal to see the details for a huge bash at the Malfoy Manor. Only men allowed. Besides strippers and such, Sirius figured. "For men only," he murmured out loud, completely hung up on that fact.</p><p>"Of course, Sirius, it's a Bachelor Party," Severus grumbled. "Aren't you a man now anyway? It's not like you could show up to the Hen Party."</p><p>For the first time since they met, Sirius gave Severus a huge grin. He was touched. "Thanks for saying that, Severus. I mean, I know that it's not your...in your belief system, but thanks. It means a lot."</p><p>The other usher looked distinctly uncomfortable with the warm feelings and looked away almost in more annoyance. "Hell, Sirius. No need to get mushy. Anyway, there's your invite. Obviously Potter and Pettigrew aren't invited, so if you <em>need</em> a ride, and I mean only as a utterly last resort, I could take you."</p><p>Looking down at the invitation, Sirius bit his lip. The party would have relatives and others who were more along the lines of his parents' thinking, but surely this was going to be a big bash if Severus was invited too. He wasn't exactly close enough to Lucius to be invited to a close friends and family only gathering. "I don't know..."</p><p>"Regulus is going to be there," he muttered. </p><p>His heart leaped into his throat thinking about his poor younger brother. They had been forbidden to contact each other since the disownment a couple of months back and he really missed their conversations. Sirius also wanted to see how he was holding up to their parents. "Okay, I'll go," he responded quickly. "I can pay for the gas if you'll pick me up."</p><p>Severus nodded and they exchanged phone numbers before the lanky boy was rushing off to be in his section of the stadium. Grinning at the invitation, Sirius wondered if maybe his cousins weren't quite as indoctrinated by the family values as they had seemed to be. It was pleasant to think that maybe he wouldn't be alone.</p><p>**</p><p>James hadn't been thrilled about Sirius going off to the party on his own without Peter and himself as backup. "People are still giving you shit," he insisted with arms crossed over his chest and glasses sliding down his nose.</p><p>Sirius rolled his eyes. "I know, but it's not like I'm crashing the party. I got an official invite with a seal and everything. There's rules about that, you know. Messing with the guests. Besides, Regulus will be there."</p><p>This time it was James who rolled his eyes. "Yeah, that scrawny kid will be <em>great </em>backup in a fistfight. Shit, he's more likely to hurt himself than anyone else!"</p><p>Double checking his outfit of dark jeans and a button up, he turned to James. "Listen, <em>Mum</em>, I won't even stay that long. Just for a couple of hours and I won't even drink any alcohol. If Severus doesn't want to bring me back home I'll just call you. Your mom wouldn't mind if you're using your permit for that." With a huff, he spread out his hands. "How do I look?"</p><p>James smiled softly, the look of brotherly concern seeming to be a constant fixture on his face ever since Sirius had confided in him about being trans. "You look great, Sirius. You always do."</p><p>A witty remark died quickly in Sirius' throat as he saw the concern linger. It had been a strange transition for their friendship, something that he hadn't really thought much about until they were in the thick of it. He had known James since they were 10 years old and had grown with him through many years of awkwardness and silliness. Even presenting as a female, Sirius had never had much luck making friends with girls and had found it so much easier to be with guys. He understood them and could be more himself around them all. That included arm wresting matches, tickle fights, burping contests, and so much more. James had always been like a brother, and a protective one at that, but when he started his transition in the middle of the school year the bullying started in earnest and it had really shaken James up. He did his best to understand what Sirius was going through and tried not to treat him differently, but he couldn't seem to wrap his mind around how he should treat Sirius especially when being bullied. Peter tended to follow James' lead on the matter which had left them in a strange state of transitioning relationship.</p><p>"Look, it'll be fine," he soothed, putting a hand on James' arm. "If I don't feel safe I'll just get out of there. I'll text or call you right away, okay?"</p><p>"Is your phone charged?"</p><p>"Yup, at 100% right now."</p><p>They stared at each other for a few seconds before Sirius jumped into James' arms for a hug like he used to. James squeezed him tightly and pressed a kiss to the side of his neck. "Go have fun, okay?</p><p>"Will do!"</p><p>**</p><p>Like he had been anticipating, there were well over a hundred people frolicking through the manor, the decor for this particular celebration being a far cry from its usual level of distinguished.</p><p>"Are those peacocks?" Sirius whispered to Severus as they pushed through the crowd congregated on the front lawn dancing to the crazed music that the DJ was doling out. </p><p>Sirius recognized a good portion of the people in attendance, but it seemed that almost no one recognized him. He was glad for it as that meant less chance of being bothered by anyone who had a problem. By some miracle he stumbled across Regulus near the start of the evening, and the two brothers stood in a quiet corner catching up. Sirius made sure to take a selfie with him and texted it to James to put the other boy at ease. A winking emoji revealed that it had worked. </p><p>Food and drinks were passed around and the two had a good time trying the American hor d'oeuvres and laughing over the fruity drinks. Sirius was glad to hear that their parents had decided to tread carefully around Regulus for fear that he would suddenly turn into a woman on them and ruin their entire family line. They continued to insist on strict rules around digital communication so there wouldn't be any texting or emailing when Regulus went back home, but they were comforted by the fact that he was still going to be attending Hogwarts until graduation. It was a rather famous Presbyterian boarding school, one of the only ones in the United States of America that people from other countries paid attention to and it had been one that both Orion and Walburga had attended back in their day. </p><p>"I've got to find the restroom," Sirius grumbled as he patted his brother's shoulder. "I'll be right back."</p><p>Finding a bathroom or powder room wasn't too difficult, but finding one unoccupied by men being serviced was a bit more of a challenge. He didn't think much of moving away from the larger crowd to find a place to relieve his bowels and it wasn't even until he was washing his hands that voices down the hall made his heart start to hammer. Taking a deep breath, Sirius tried to remind himself that it was probably nothing. There were hundreds of people out there and lots of drinks so maybe they were looking for a bathroom too? Keeping his head down, he stepped out of the room and brushed past the small group of men who were whispering and cackling to each other. Walking quickly, Sirius focused on getting back into the ballroom, but an iron hand clamped down on his arm. </p><p>"Hey, isn't it Siri? Whatcha doin' here girly?"</p><p>He glared over his shoulder and tried to pull his arm away. "Fuck off Dolohov!"</p><p>The older boy started laughing and his grip bore down even harder. "Didn't Malfoy say that the only girls allowed tonight were strippers and whores?" he asked to a round of laughter.</p><p>"I'm not a girl!" Sirius hissed, still struggling. "And I'm expected! Someone is going to notice pretty quickly if I don't get back!" It was difficult to not start screeching in fear and desperation, but he still had hopes to get out without creating a huge ruckus.</p><p>Goyle grinned nastily. "Hmm, does that mean little Regulus is the bitch in the family? What do you think boys, should we go find out?"</p><p>The blood drained from Sirius' face. "You wouldn't dare! He's the heir to the House of Black!"</p><p>"House of Black? Ha! You're kidding yourself if you think that any of the old bloods have any respect left for that fucking family!"</p><p>"Yeah," Dolohov taunted, "everyone's already heard of their pervert bitch wanting to be a boy and there are already rumors going on about  just how much incest your family puts up with."</p><p>"Did Daddy make you that way?" Crabbe crooned and Sirius couldn't help but throw a punch into that snide face.</p><p>"Fuck you!" he screamed angrily, punching and kicking and scratching as best as he could.</p><p>It wasn't good odds, three against one, especially when two of them were meatheads, and Sirius felt the panic as they dragged him out the back door kicking and screaming. The bloody music was too loud and the roar of conversation made it impossible for anyone to hear his cries for help, especially when the fireworks began shooting across the sky. As panicked as he was, Sirius knew that he could take a beating if it came to it. They wouldn't be stupid enough to fatally wound him, especially at the party of one of the wealthiest men in the area. It wouldn't reflect well on the Malfoy hospitality. James could patch him up and he'd be good to go in a couple of weeks. Even if they broke something, he could still take it.</p><p>The moment Dolohov started tugging at his jeans, Sirius lost his mind. "No, fuck, shit, nooo!!!!!"</p><p>That seemed to only make the drunk men laugh even harder as they traded rude barbs of how exactly they were going to "cure" him and make him realize that he was nothing but a bitch. White hot panic boiled through his blood as he saw the large round moon hanging in the sky as a completely passive observer. Little whispers in his mind spoke of moon-craze, of people who lost all their senses and went wild under the mysterious powers of that moon, and with more strength than he knew that he possessed Sirius jerked a leg away and slammed the heel firmly into Crabbe's laughing face. There was a sickening crunch and loud screams and curses before he felt himself dropped to the ground. The friends were reacting instinctively to help him out and it was that tiny opening that made Sirius scramble to his feet and dash into the woods. They were between him and the manor and in that flat expanse of grass he had no chance of outrunning them. Desperate for the cover of the forest to hide him and maybe give him the opportunity to swing around and make it back to the manor, Sirius ran as fast as he could.</p><p>The crashing sounds of feet stumbling through the woods blindly couldn't cover the panting breath and gasps. Strips of moonlight filtered through the tree branches, dappled across the brush and vines that tangled around his feet. It would have been a beautiful sight if it hadn't been for the jeering and vile words he could still hear behind him. Tears stung at his eyes as he struggled to get away, a ball of dread settling in his stomach. His sneaker caught on something - a rock, a vine, maybe a broken branch - and there was a loud popping sound as he tumbled down into the still moist dirt and decaying leaves. Insects were buzzing happily in the muggy evening air and it felt as if his entire senses were flooded by those horrid sounds for a few seconds before a burning pain shot through his ankle and he was crying out in agony.</p><p>Hearing the voices get louder and the laughter, Sirius did his best to clamp his mouth shut and move via a desperate crawl despite the pain in his arm. It was hopeless. He couldn't outrun them with two good legs, so how did he plan to get away with a potentially broken ankle? Mud smeared across his face as he brushed away the frightened and pained tears, desperate for any escape. <em>Please, </em>there had to be a way out of this!</p><p>"H-help," he whispered into the dirt, arms and lungs burning. "Help me."</p><p>The snapping of a twig and the shuffle of brush from ahead startled the young man and when he looked up all sense of hope seemed to vanish completely on the spot. A snarling snout painted by moonlight appeared, the drool dripping ominously, and golden eyes fixed right on his trembling figure. There was no running now.</p><p>If he hadn't already relieved himself that evening, Sirius was sure that he would have completely soiled himself. The fear of being caught by the raving lunatics behind him seemed to be swallowed up in the fear of his soon-to-be demise. He hadn't ever really thought about how he would die, but being eaten alive by a wild animal hadn't even seemed a remote possibility. The massive wolf moved forward slowly, hackles raised and a deep growl in its throat. The paws thumping into the moist dirty were probably larger than his own hands and Sirius wondered if this thing was actually a bear; a mutant bear with a very distinctive canine face. He was choking down air in short panicked bursts, hoping beyond all hope that if he just remained still on the ground, eyes focused on the beast's paws, that maybe it wouldn't see him. He tried to ignore the voice stating that canines had damned good noses and didn't need vision to hunt him down. The wet snout bumped against his cheek and the nose made a strange snuffling sound before huffing out a hot putrid breath. There was blood in that gaping maw and Sirius couldn't help the whimper that bubbled past his throat. Drool rolled down against his bruised cheek.</p><p>"Help," he whispered even more quietly, hoping that any benevolent deity or supernatural force would take pity on him. Wasn't being assaulted and almost raped enough for one night? Couldn't Karma swing things in the other direction?</p><p>The snuffling continued in his hair and Sirius wondered if his shampoo smelt offensive to the beast. Or maybe it was trying to find a way past his shoulder-length hair so that it could sink its teeth into the back of his neck? Wasn't that how wolves liked to kill? No, that was mountain lions. Wolves liked going for the throat. The loud sounds of stumbling through brush along with a few loud crude statements reminded Sirius that he wasn't alone in the woods and the growling over him increased in volume. The monstrous wolf stepped over to straddle Sirius and he felt a nip at the back of his knees making him cry out in fear before clamping a hand over his mouth again. There was another huff and a shuffling of paws before he felt a warm heat spread over his back and down his backside. Still in complete shock, it wasn't until the overpowering scent hit his nose that Sirius realized that the thing had taken a piss on him and vomit finally erupted past his lips and onto the ground in front of him. The retching continued completely out of his control and with the trembling going through his body Sirius thought that if the wolf didn't eat him and the drunk men didn't beat him to death then he'd probably die of a nervous breakdown.</p><p>An ear-piercing howl sounded right behind him, sounding angry, and the sounds of the three guys chasing him down died immediately. Even the constant sounds of frogs and insects hushed reverently. This wolf was king of this domain.</p><p>"Sh-shit, did you hear that?" he could hear Dolohov ask.</p><p>"N-no way," Goyle chuckled. "There's no fucking wolves here."</p><p>"Maybe thath wash a coyote," Crabbe tried to whisper, but their voices were all carrying too well on the humid air. His nose must have been broken.</p><p>The wolf began growling again and it strode towards the men were loud purposeful strides. Weren't wolves supposed to be quiet when hunting? Did they even hunt humans? Sparing a glance over his shoulder, Sirius couldn't see the men or the beast so he pushed up onto his good leg shakily and began hobbling away from where it sounded like they were. </p><p>His fall had completely disoriented him, and he struggled to find good astrological points of reference through the full tree canopies, so he made his best guesses to the direction of the manor and limped and crawled as fast as he could. The sudden screams of terror and angry howls from not far off hit Sirius like a shot to the chest and he tried to scramble even faster away from what was sure to be a gruesome scene. Even if he had been in fear for his life, Sirius couldn't find it in himself to feel any satisfaction in such a demise for those three. He couldn't imagine anyone deserving to be mauled to death.</p><p>A sudden thought hit him almost as hard as he began patting down his pockets for his phone. He needed to call for help! Dread followed almost immediately as he came up empty-handed. Great! A fully charged phone was useless if it wasn't on his person. Nearly screaming in frustration and fear, he continued moving even after the sounds of screaming faded out leaving the chorus of crickets and toads to carry on as they had before being interrupted. The heavy sounds of brush being trampled behind him clawed fresh terror down his back and in desperation he tried putting weight on his injured ankle to have a better shot at running, but the pain was white hot and took him down to his hands and knees again. </p><p>Fur brushed against his side and a heavy snout swiped against his shoulder, knocking him to his back. He began screaming in terror, seeing that wet muzzle before it clamped down on his bad leg and started dragging him. Instinctively he sat up and grabbing a nearby stick he hit the beast right across the face, anything to delay the inevitable. The wolf leaped back and shook it's head in aggravation before coiling its muscles and pouncing against his chest. The wind was completely knocked out of him and a solid thump to the back of his head knocked him out.</p><p>**</p><p>It was a warmth against him that Sirius first became aware of when consciousness began to trickle through the haze of the dreamland. Warmth and an earthy cocoon of scents. There was a light burning against the back of his eyelids but it wasn't harsh enough to hurt. What did hurt, he realized fairly quickly, was most everything else. Pain throbbed from his left leg all they way up to his hip and his right arm felt wrapped in a blanket of pain. Fingers burned raw as if he had been trying to claw through something solid and his left hand felt oddly thick as if swollen. Gritting his teeth in pain, Sirius tried to sit up as he struggled to get his eyes open, but realized that there was an actual heavy weight across his chest and it wasn't another pain. Prying his swollen eyes open, the sunlight was momentarily blinding and he groaned softly before his vision cleared enough to see the leaves dancing softly overhead.</p><p>The warm next to him moved and Sirius froze, memories of the snarling muzzle and the huge beast rushing through him. Confusion and befuddlement flooded through him as a figure sat up next to him, yawning lazily. A very human figure. A very human and very naked figure.</p><p>"What the hell?!" he shrieked as he rolled over and tried to get away before crumpling in pain and gasping. Crawling was no longer even an option with how thrashed his hands and arms were.</p><p>"Hey, hey, take a breath, okay?" The voice was oddly familiar, and Sirius looked over his should with shaky breathes to see kind hazel eyes and terribly mussed golden curls. His mouth dropped open and he stared at that out-of-place face before looking down at the exposed chest and jerking his eyes right back up to the sheepish face. "Asking you not to freak out is kind of a ridiculous request, but I'd like to make it anyway."</p><p>"<em>You</em>," Sirius blurted out, realizing that he had a split lip too. Hell, those fuckers did a number on him.</p><p>The naked boy had the decency to look embarrassed. "Yeah, sorry about this, Sirius. My name is Remus, in case you forgot."</p><p>"I didn't!"</p><p>They sat there staring at each other for a few seconds and Sirius wondered why he seemed so comfortable in the nude. </p><p>"Um, good morning. Hi. Yeah, last night was crazy."</p><p>Sirius just stared. That mouth was moving and he was speaking English, but the words didn't seem to make sense. Was he being casual about the most horrifying and traumatic night of Sirius' life.</p><p>"Crazy?! CRAZY?!"</p><p>He kicked angrily at the boy with his one good limb and felt a little better when Remus didn't try to dodge it.</p><p>"Yeah, sorry, it's just that something like that is pretty unusual for me too. And you know when a werewolf says that he's had an unusual night it's a pretty fucking weird one."</p><p>Snorting in stupification, Sirius looked around at his surroundings. It was all wooded land like the ones that surrounded the Malfoy Manor, but it all looked quite the same and he could see no signs of civilization.</p><p>"Am I dead?" he asked incredulously. "I mean, I hurt an awful lot to be dead, but this doesn't make sense otherwise. Maybe I'm in a coma?"</p><p>"No, you're not dead," Remus yawned as he stretched out. "Do you mind if I help you up? I've got clothes at the cottage, so maybe we can just talk about this when I'm not in my birthday suit?"</p><p>Looking down at himself, Sirius winced at the visible damage. There was no way he was moving anywhere on his own. "I...I don't think I can move much."</p><p>Remus frowned sadly and nodded. "Sorry about that, Sirius. I should have gotten there sooner. Is it okay if I pick you up?" Not seeing any other option, he nodded shyly. He knew that he wasn't exactly the lightest person in the world, but he gasped in surprise as Remus hefted him up bridal style with seemingly no effort. The blond grinned sheepishly. "Werewolf," he stated in explanation before striding off purposefully. </p><p>Sirius tried not to focus on the fact that he was being held up close against a very naked body of a very handsome boy who seemed way too familiar with these woods. And with walking around naked.</p><p>"Do you live near here?" he mumbled softly before prodding the bloody cut on his lip with the tip of his tongue.</p><p>"My grandmother does," he replied cheerfully. "She'll have made a nice hot breakfast that you're welcome to. Um, well, let's go wash up in the stream real quick."</p><p>Wrinkling his nose as he remembered what exactly he went through last night he stared accusingly at the now blushing boy. "You fucking pissed on me!"</p><p>"Ha, yeah, sorry about that. I just needed to mark you for your safety and that seemed a better option than, you know, ejaculation. There are bears and mountain lions in these woods."</p><p>Thinking about being covered in dried werewolf spunk made him even more sick. "I'm going to be sick."</p><p>"Go ahead and heave if you need to. You got most of it up last night, anyways, and we'll wash off most of the smell."</p><p>The stream wasn't very deep but it was frigid and Sirius was shivering as soon as he was set into the water. Remus insisted that he keep his clothes on and just wash the bile and piss as best as they could before he pulled Sirius back up into his arms. Even though he had washed up too, Remus felt considerably warmer than Sirius did, and the trembling boy couldn't help but snuggle against the bare chest as he was once more carried off. He was thankful for the numbing effects on his leg, but knew that it wouldn't last long.</p><p>Having dozed off, Sirius was startled when Remus spoke up again. "Here we are."</p><p>Looking up he saw a quaint little cottage complete with a nice white picket fence surrounding it. There was a pair of jeans and a t-shirt hanging over the fence by the gate and Remus carefully set Sirius down so that he could get dressed. Being careful not to look at the dressing boy, Sirius focused on examining the grounds around the cottage and noted all the signs stating a support for pollinating bugs and birds which explained the organized chaos of wildflowers completely surrounding the house. There was even a composting pile off in the corner. </p><p>"Your grandma likes gardening I take it," he mumbled and Remus chuckled. He swept back went curls from his forehead and grinned down at Sirius.</p><p>"Yeah, she's especially into native plants. They're the best for her potions."</p><p>"Potions?" Things kept getting weirder.</p><p>"Yeah, she's a witch," he responded casually and Sirius would have thought him completely off his rocker if it hadn't been for the whole episode last night.</p><p>"A witch."</p><p>"Yeah. Not like the movies, of course, but yeah. She'll have something to help with the pain while you call your family."</p><p>He hefted Sirius up again and easily carried him through the gate and up the cute stone steps. It would have been a romantic ordeal, Sirius mused, if he wasn't hurting so badly and Remus wasn't a fucking <em>werewolf</em> taking him to a witch's cottage.</p><p>"She has a phone?" he muttered to himself in disbelief just as Remus called out in greeting.</p><p>"Oma! I'm back! And I've got someone with me!"</p><p>"Oh dear!" a rather large woman fretted immediately as they stepped into the comforting warmth. "Remus, what happened!"</p><p>Her long white hair was twisted into thick braids and her rotund figure was dressed in an almost stereotypical gingham dress full with an embroidered apron. Thick glasses were perched on her nose, magnifying her worried eyes as she rushed over and began examining Sirius.</p><p>"Sirius got attacked last night over by the Malfoy Manor," he explained through another yawn.</p><p>"Did you bite him?" she asked sharply and Remus shook his head.</p><p>"No, Oma. I did have to grab his leg to drag him this way but I was careful not to break the skin."</p><p>"Come, child," she soothed, "sit on the couch and let Oma look over you."</p><p>Remus settled him onto the couch and crouched down next to his grandmother. "Do you mind if we get you down to your underwear? Oma will have an easier time-"</p><p>"No!" he choked out, burning red with embarrassment. Besides the horrid memories of almost being raped the night before he felt a flare of self-consciousness regarding his body. He was wearing his only binder and a pair of boxer briefs, but it would be immediately obvious that he was trans and he was too embarrassed to deal with it right now.</p><p>"It's okay," Remus soothed, warm fingers brushing against his cheek. "Let me get some food for you while Oma looks you over, okay?"</p><p>"O-okay," he whispered, looking down at his shaking hands. He felt a little better when Remus did step away and the old woman smiled kindly at him. </p><p>"I'm sorry, dear," she comforted. "You must be terribly confused and hurting right now. You can call your family in just a minute and then eat while waiting for them to pick you up. We'll answer any questions that you might have too, but I don't have to express how important it is that you keep Remus' werewolf status to yourself."</p><p>Sirius just nodded quietly and let the woman examine him as best as she could fully dressed. Once she was finished she brought over a small glass vial and told him to swallow it down. The taste was distinctly floral and almost <em>sunny</em> and he could feel a pleasant tingle dance through his body, taking the edge off the worst of the pains. With that finished, Remus brought over the landline telephone and a plate heavy with bacon, pancakes, potato cakes, and scrambled eggs.</p><p>Embarrassed that the only phone number he had memorized was 911 and James' cell phone number, Sirius decided that he had to call James. The Potters were bound to be besides themselves when he didn't return home last night. He wished that he could call Regulus too and explain, but he didn't have that number memorized. The phone was picked up almost immediately.</p><p>"Hello?! This is James Potter, have you heard-"</p><p>"James, it's me," he breathed out in relief.</p><p>"FUCKING HELL ARE YOU OKAY?! WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?! MOM, DAD!!!!"</p><p>Tears welled up as he listened to the ranting of his best friend's voice and he started crying. "I-I-I got, um, they t-tried to hurt m-me and..."</p><p>"Where are you?" James demanded, rage and concern swirled in his voice. "We're going to get your right now, Sirius, just tell me where to pick you up."</p><p>Sirius handed the phone to Oma and she proceeded to give directions to her home which apparently wasn't very far from a bus stop. That buses would stop this far out in the woods surprised Sirius, but he couldn't stop crying enough to think about it. Remus carefully sat next to him and wrapped a warm arm around him while offering the plate of food wordlessly. Sirius suspected that there had to have been a spell on the food as he found himself eating it even though the tears and hiccups. Remus continued rubbing his shoulders carefully while he heard Oma answering a few questions about injuries. When she hung up, she placed a wrinkled hand on his thigh softly.</p><p>"They're sending an ambulance this way. Remus can carry you out to the bus stop in about ten minutes, so please eat up. I'll send you with some tea."</p><p>"Th-thanks," he croaked, before resting his aching head against Remus' shoulder. </p><p>He allowed himself to be shifted so that his legs hung over Remus' thighs and his head could rest in the crook of the werewolf's neck even while he ate. The ten minutes passed quietly as Sirius didn't think that he had the energy to ask any pressing questions about werewolves or witches. In his weariness he just accepted the unreal situation and took comfort in the warm body that had kept him safe through the night. With a full belly and a warm mug of tea in hand, Sirius allowed himself to be carried out to the small bus stop that he quickly recognized as a school bus stop. The winding asphalt road was only visible for a few hundred feet as it horseshoed around a large rocky cliff of a cut-out hill. There was a sign that would flash to warn any oncoming traffic of a stopped bus. Only a minute later they could hear the wailing of the ambulance siren and it quickly pulled up to the stop. The paramedics jumped out and began to examine his state while a familiar suburban pulled up behind them and James jumped out quickly followed by a crying Euphemia and a pale Fleamont. Sirius started crying all over again at seeing them and clung to James for a few seconds before the paramedics got him onto the gurney. </p><p>Turning to say thanks to Remus, Sirius was shocked to see that he had completely disappeared, the forest seeming unperturbed.</p>
