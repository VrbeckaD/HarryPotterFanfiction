    <p align="center">(With Oliver Queen and Barry Allen)</p><p>“You ready for our date?” Oliver asked his omega.</p><p>“I am.” Barry said as he entered the living room.”</p><p>“Great.” He smiled at the speedster. “You look wonderful.”</p><p>“Thanks.” He blushed. “So do you.”</p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p>The two left the house. They climbed into the car and drove off. Soon they were at the restaurant. Oliver parked the car and they entered the restaurant. </p><p>“Wow. Thanks Ollie.”</p><p>The alpha smiled at him. “You're welcome. You deserve the best.”</p><p>“I love you.”</p><p>“I love you too.”</p><p>“Good evening gentlemen. Do you have a reservation?” The hostess asked.</p><p>“Yes. It should be under Queen.”</p><p>“Alright.” She looked through the book. “Here you are. Right this way Mr. and Mr. Queen.”</p><p>“Thank you.” The two said together. </p><p>She smiled at them. “You're welcome sirs.”</p><p>The two followed the beta to the table. She gave them each a menu. Both thanked him before he left. Oliver and Barry scanned the menu.</p><p>“Don't worry about the prices. Order what you want.” Oliver said to his omega.</p><p>Barry gave him a look. “You sure? You know I can eat a lot.”</p><p>“I'm sure.”</p><p>“Okay. Just letting you know you might regret it.”</p><p>Oliver chuckled. “Still loaded so this won't make a dent.”</p><p>“That's true.” He smirked.</p><p>“Now as your alpha I am ordering you to pick what you want.”</p><p>“Ooh ordering me huh?” Barry teased.</p><p>Oliver smirked. “Yes, Yes I am.”</p><p>Barry shivered with desire. “You know how much that turns me on.” He complained playfully.</p><p>“Yes I do.” Oliver was smug.</p><p>“Hate you.” He pouted.</p><p>“I know.” His smirk widened. </p><p>“Ugh!” Now he was horny and he couldn't do anything about it.</p><p>“Good evening sirs. My name is Stephanie and I will be your waitress.”</p><p>“Hello.” The two greeted back.</p><p>“Are you two ready to order?”</p><p>“Yes. I would like the steak and baked potato with the beef gravy. I would also like the red wine.”</p><p>“Of course.” She wrote it down “And you sir?” Stephanie asked Barry.</p><p>“I would like the roast beef with mashed potatoes, gravy, and green beans, chicken salad with buttermilk ranch, and red wine please.”</p><p>She wrote it down. “I'll go put the order in.”</p><p>“Thank you.” Oliver and Barry said.</p><p>“You're welcome.” She left. </p><p>“So how is Iris?” Oliver asked.</p><p>“Great. Her and Eddie will be getting married next month.” Barry smiled.</p><p>“Good. What about Joe?”</p><p>“Sill saying I need to be with another omega.” Barry answered sadly. </p><p>Oliver sighed. “I'm sorry.”</p><p>“Not your fault. As an officer he has seen the worst side or Alphas and is worried. Once he stops being stubborn and sees how you treat me he will see that you are an amazing Alpha who wouldn't hurt me.”</p><p>Oliver smiled and kissed his hand. “Thank you.” He frowned after a second. “His words still hurt you.”</p><p>“True bu-”</p><p>Oliver cut him off. “No buts. How you feel is important to me.”</p><p>Barry smiled happily at that. “Thank you.”</p><p>“You're welcome love. How about we talk about something else?”</p><p>“That would be great.”</p><p>“How is work?”</p><p>“Good. Many of them are nice and those who aren't don't want to mess with Oliver Queen's omega.”</p><p>“Good.” Anybody who did, would learn their lesson.</p><p> “Yup.”</p><p>“Is detective Lance a problem?”</p><p>“No. He actually helps me. I think Sara being around has mellowed him out.” Barry told him.</p><p>“That's good.”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>The two stopped talking when they noticed the waitress. She handed them their drinks and food. Stephanie soon leaves and Oliver breaks the silence.</p><p>“I'm really glad. I was worried since I know how much you love Central.”</p><p>“I can go to Central in a couple of seconds if I'm needed. You have helped me so much. You are needed here so here I am.” Barry informed him with a loving smile.</p><p>Oliver returned the smile. “Thanks Barr.”</p><p>“You're always welcome.”</p><p>They ate the rest of their meal in silence. They shared glances filled with love and lust. They ate dessert before Oliver paid the bill. The two wanted to get home. They left the restaurant and began walking to the car. The two stopped when they heard yelling and crying. Both shared a look and went to investigate. </p><p>Oliver and Barry found a large red haired male alpha beating up a small black haired male omega. Oliver quickly pulled the alpha away from the omega. Barry went over to the omega.</p><p>“Back off.” The redhead hissed at Oliver.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Barry began checking the omega over. He then pulled out his phone. He called the authorities and an ambulance. The poor omega was unconscious and seemed to be barely breathing.</p><p>“He's mine so I will do with him what I will.”</p><p>“Not only are you wrong but I can smell that you two aren't bonded.” Oliver said as he pushed him up against the wall.</p><p>“That's because the freak keeps refusing me.” He snarled.</p><p>“So you want to force him?” Barry asked in disgust.</p><p>“Yes. He was promised to my sister but she turned out to be a beta. Now he belongs to me.”</p><p>“That isn't right.” Barry said.</p><p>“You can't force him to bond with you. It's wrong.” Oliver growled.</p><p>“Who cares?” </p><p>“We do.” Oliver said.</p><p>“I'm so scared.” The redhead pretended to be scared.</p><p>Oliver let him break free. The other alpha tried to punch him but Oliver grabbed his fist. He then twisted his arm around and slammed him into the wall.</p><p>The authorities arrived first. They arrested the redhead and questioned Oliver and Barry. During the questioning the ambulance arrived. They took the black haired male to the hospital. Once the two gave their statements they followed the ambulance to the hospital.</p>
