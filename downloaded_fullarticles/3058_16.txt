          <div class="userstuff"><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“This is our house,” Harry said. He smiled at the look of surprise on Draco’s face. “Well, legally mine, but it was the Black family home, and you’re technically a descendant, so…ours.”</p><p align="justify">Draco’s eyebrows rose but he didn’t comment, following Harry up several flights of stairs to the attic.</p><p align="justify">“There’s a heap of stuff up here you might be able to help me with,” Harry told him. “You know more about this old stuff than I do.”</p><p align="justify">“Thanks,” Draco said dryly.</p><p align="justify">“Because of your time at the Manor, and your job, Mister Expert in Cursed and Magically Enhanced Objects,” Harry said patiently.</p><p align="justify">Draco rolled his eyes but grinned, wandering a few steps. “What’s this?”</p><p align="justify">Harry unfurled it and they both looked on the heavy brocade of the Black family tree. “Took me almost a year to get this down,” he murmured.</p><p align="justify">Both their eyes trailed over it, Harry’s pausing at the burn that represented Sirius. The jolt of recognition was followed by pain, as always. A little less, but still...</p><p align="justify">“Wait, I’m on here,” Draco said in wonder, examining it.</p><p align="justify">“Yeah,” Harry replied. “Your mother married a pureblood, so...”</p><p align="justify">Draco frowned, glancing at Harry. “If I’m the last one here...”</p><p align="justify">“Sirius left it to me,” Harry said quietly. “We checked with the house-elf.”</p><p align="justify">“Right, sorry,” Draco said.</p><p align="justify">“But it kind of is yours, and Teddy’s, and sort of mine too,” Harry said. He found Draco’s hand again. “I want you to be comfortable here.”</p><p align="justify">“With this attic to explore?” Draco said, squeezing Harry’s hand. “Definitely.”</p><p align="justify">“Of course,” Harry said.</p><p align="justify">“Is that a Vanishing Cabinet?” Draco exclaimed.</p><p align="justify">“Yep. Its pair is stuck to the wall in Regulus’ old room.” Hardy grinned. “I suspect Regulus was less of a rule follower than people suspected.”</p><p align="justify">Draco grinned at him, his gaze sliding away to linger over the other items.</p><p align="justify">“What about that?” he asked. Before Harry could warn him, he pulled a sheet off a portrait, which immediately began to wail and moan.</p><p align="justify">“Mudbloods! Mudbloods and blood traitors alike! A house of traitors, none loyal to the Black name, not one of my own flesh and blood, filth trailing over the threshold for all to see...”</p><p align="justify">“Sirius’ mother.” Harry had to raise his voice to be heard. “She’d be your...” he looked quickly over the family tree. “Grandmother, from what I can see. No wait, Great-Aunt.”</p><p align="justify">“Charming,” Draco muttered, looking shaken. “Excuse me,” he shouted, startling the portrait into submission. He waited until she looked at him. “Draco Malfoy. Your niece Narcissa was my mother.”</p><p align="justify">“Malfoy?” The portrait blinked, then narrowed its eyes suspiciously. “Your mother married a pure blood?”</p><p align="justify">“Lucius Abraxas Malfoy,” Draco confirmed.</p><p align="justify">“A pure blood descendant? In my very house!” She looked elated and disbelieving. “Are you loyal to the House of Black?”</p><p align="justify">“Well that depends,” Draco asked. “Given there are no Blacks remaining, the House of Black is no more. This house belongs to Harry Potter, god-son of your son Sirius.”</p><p align="justify">Her face hardened but Draco went on. “Given the number of my relatives you have blasted off that tapestry, and how often they are likely to be welcomed here, I doubt we will see eye to eye.” His eyes sparkled. “Have you met my cousin Teddy Tonks? Well, cousin once removed. Your great-great-nephew.”</p><p align="justify">“His grandmother married a Mudblood!” The woman spat.</p><p align="justify">“And his mother married a werewolf,” Draco retorted, watching her face contort with rage. “I think he might be my favourite,” he pretended to muse as the woman slid back into her rant from earlier.</p><p align="justify">“Let’s go,” Draco said, tossing the cloth back over the raving woman. “We can do the rest later.”</p></div>
