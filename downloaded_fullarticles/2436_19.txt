    <p class="western">“Harry, can I... uh, have a second?”</p>
<p class="western">Blinking, the seventeen year old looked up from where he was sorting through the piles of parchment he had tipped out from his school bag. The summer had been sticky hot, and stressful for everyone involved, himself most of all. Hence his retreat back to his bedroom, sorting through his school supplies in order to avoid <em>another</em> 'discussion' come argument with his family. Hence why it was so odd that Dudley Dursley would be stood nervously at his bedroom door with a somewhat shifty facial expression. Harry tilted his head to one side straightening up from where he had been arranging parchments into neat piles, was his cousin hiding something behind his back?</p>
<p class="western">Even though he had been expecting his Uncle to storm into his room, changing his mind for the umpteenth time that day alone, this was the first time Dudley had approached him since the summer of his fifth year after the Dementor incident. The irregularity alone was enough for Harry to put his notes on a useful little charm down on the review pile and turn his full attention to the blond, gesturing to him to start talking.</p>
<p class="western">“Sure,” he agreed, mentally wondering if this was going to be an interrogation or a confession of hatred and gratitude in equal measures. Dudley had changed somewhat since the Dementor incident, but Harry hadn't had a chance to talk to him about that or even since then to see just how deeply that change went. He had been leaving cups of tea outside his room, but given the number of times Harry ended up stepping on them, he wasn't sure if it had been a prank or a genuine gesture of awkward and uncertain reconciliation. Neither of them really knew how to talk to each other, and Dudley was terrible with apologies as well. Either way, his cousin had become quieter, more thoughtful, and Harry could swear that the blond's eyes lingered on him more than once as he went about his business last summer. The curious thing was that there was no hostility at all in those looks, just contemplation, wariness, and confusion in equal measures.</p>
<p class="western">Dudley shuffled in, and nudged the door part-way closed. Enough that they would have privacy, but not shut so as to arouse his parents' suspicion. Ahh, he must not want Aunt Petunia or Uncle Vernon to know they were talking then. Interesting.</p>
<p class="western">Harry sat down on his bed, “What's up, Dudley?” he asked when it became apparent that the other male was too nervous, or uncertain, to start the conversation himself.</p>
<p class="western">For a moment, the blond visibly struggled with himself before he finally thrust a small clumsily wrapped package towards him in one meaty pink shovel sized hand. Harry blinked in utter bemusement as he stared at the red, gold and green patterned wrapping paper – left overs from Petunia's Christmas roll, he could tell because the colours matched the tinsel and baubles she'd decorated the tree with for the last twenty years.</p>
<p class="western">“I... never got you a Birthday present. Ever,” Dudley finally said, studiously not looking at his cousin as he wiggled the wrapped present forward, hand trembling ever so slightly. “I even... when Mrs McQuay got everyone that little notebook in Year Five, you were so happy so I... I kicked it in dog shit just so you couldn't have it. That... that was harsh and unfair and you'd never even <em><u>had</u></em> a proper present before so...” His voice seemed to die again as he finally seemed to realise his cousin wasn't going to be taking the package so tossed it carefully onto the bed beside him. “My user ID is '<em>Broken Fist</em>', give me a PM and... we'll, I'll...” he came to a stumbling halt still wrestling with himself. “If you want, that is, I'll give you a hand. You've probably.... probably never played any games. Not the good ones like '<em>Second Life</em>',” he admitted quietly, finally looking away from the lone hand knitted sock of green and gold winged balls discarded on the floor.</p>
<p class="western">Someone had gone to the effort of hand-knitting a pair of socks for his cousin.</p>
<p class="western">His cousin who had saved him without a second thought even after he'd punched him in the face, even after everything Dudley had done to him throughout their lives. His cousin, who he would have abandoned without hesitation had their roles been reversed.</p>
<p class="western">Dudley didn't give the Gryffindor a chance to respond before he fled the room, red faced, guilty, and yet relieved. Even pleased with himself. As soon as his cousin's door closed behind him, he couldn't stop the small smile that split his face. He hoped Harry did PM him when he finally got himself registered. It would be nice, Dudley decided, he had never been allowed to know his cousin, not properly.</p>
<p class="western">He looked forward to meeting Harry for the first time.</p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<hr/>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">The next time Harry even looked at the package was while he was rummaging in his trunk for pyjamas, still feeling devastated, raw, and jittery by the events of the last forty-eight hours.</p>
<p class="western">The escape from Privet Drive, from the waiting Death Eaters, Hedwig – his beloved Hedwig dying in a flash of damnable green light (was that green light going to steal the lives of everyone precious to him, he couldn't help but wonder?), Moody's disappearance, George's injury, his wand moving all by itself, finding out about Ollivander's abduction... He was still half expecting to have Moody stump his way through the door and start complaining about how everyone thought he was just going to roll over and die without putting up a fight, never! CONSTANT VIGILANCE!</p>
<p class="western">His lips twitched slightly as he dragged out a set of Dudley's less horrible hand-me-down shirts, plain rather washed out red with green and gold spots. This was the set that he'd had when he was eleven, they still fit, depressingly enough. Being a midget was getting old but it looked like it was going to be something Harry would have to live with. At almost seventeen, he certainly had only grown three inches in the last two years, going from a depressing 4'11” at fifteen, to an equally depressing 5'2” at seventeen.</p>
<p class="western">He paused, staring at the clothes in his hands as something niggled at the back of his mind. Now what was it.... he frowned, wondering just what they reminded him off. It was only when he dropped them onto the bed that the light-bulb went off at the sight of the crumpled fabric. Dudley's crumpled present.</p>
<p class="western">Well, there was no time like now to find out what his cousin had been talking about, and he needed something, anything, to get his mind off what had happened earlier that day.</p>
<p class="western">Digging out his messenger big, he flipped it open, and pulled out the clumsily wrapped present, turning it over in his hands and just wondering what on earth his cousin had gotten him. It felt moderately weighty but not quite evenly distributed, the ends of the rather long package felt heavier than the middle section, shoddy wrapping job aside. Actually curious now, Harry picked at the mangled sellotape holding the package shut before giving up and just tearing into the paper. Wrapping was evidentially not one of Dudley's few appreciable skills.</p>
<p class="western">A box with a large white '<b>Dreams Gaming Device</b>' emblazoned on the front with what looked to be some Chinese characters, and a smaller subheading announcing that it was Version two-point-five, now featuring an inbuilt power-pack for mobile gaming. Just below the text to the right was a small section that pictured a game case of '<em>Second Life</em>', proclaiming that it came free with the device. He turned the box over in his hands, reading the text written on the side curiously.</p>
<p class="western">“<em>Step into a virtual world with Dreams Gaming Device. With our smart REM linking technology let your mind fly free, and adventure while your body sleeps, and rests ready for the day tomorrow! Instructions inside along with a free starter pack of '</em>Second Life<em>', the most popular online virtual MMO to come out of China since '</em>The World<em>' and the ever classic '</em>Life<em>'.”</em></p>
<p class="western">What followed was a list of sponsors, and how to get into contact with Customer Services and Tech-Support should there be any problems. Only downside of that was there would probably be no opportunity for Harry to ever contact their Tech-Support or Customer Services.</p>
<p class="western">So... Dudley got him a Virtual Reality Gaming headset and game? That was actually pretty cool. And expensive if he recalled the prices of such things correctly – about half that of a good quality Cleansweep if he converted to Galleons.</p>
<p class="western">Opening the box, he removed the instructions and set them to one side before carefully lifting the headpiece out via the polystyrene blocks around the ear-cups. It honestly looked like something out of those old fashioned Sci Fi shows that Uncle Vernon liked to watch on the weekends. White and grey lined headphones that cupped the entirety of the ear, small ports and what looked like a blue-tooth and WiFi receiver antenna, and an eye-shield made of pale blue coloured plastic. The headphones did indeed feel rather weighty but due to the plastic and the way it was built it did feel strangely light as well, and weirdly <em>fragile</em>. He flicked open the instruction sheet on how to use it before exploring the ear-cups to find the slot where he had to put the game cartridges for Second Life – which could be found in a small sealed game case at the bottom of the box behind a small cardboard cut-out. Currently a blank plastic proxy was in the port, he pushed it in a little further, heard a click and then the thing shot half way out. Enough for him to pick it free. He eyed the hole but couldn't see anything circumspect so reached for the game case.</p>
<p class="western">Second Life was exactly what the game-box promised, a chance to live in a fantasy world of magic and monsters, to meet new people, and have fun. He glanced at Ron's bedroom clock and decided it really was time for him to go to bed, pretty soon his friend would be making his way upstairs and, right now, Harry really didn't want to talk to anyone. About anything.</p>
<p class="western">He changed into his pyjamas, and hid the game box under his cot, out of sight, before slotting the cartridge in and sliding it onto his face. Climbing into his bed, he curled up so he was cocooned in the blankets and the headpiece was hidden from view.</p>
<p class="western">He closed his eyes. And felt himself begin to fall.</p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<hr/>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">“|<b>Greetings! Welcome to Second Life!</b>|” a chirpy female voice resonated in his ears.</p>
<p class="western">Harry twitched a little, his eyes opening and burning at the bright white light around him. He blinked rapidly before turning around to face the young woman behind him. In an endless chequered room, she was sat in an overly large, very technological looking floating chair with a headpiece that had numerous wires and attachments running from it into the device. He eyed her, she was slim in a buxom kind of way with smooth flawless skin and long flowing violet coloured hair, wearing a tight sleeveless PVC miniskirt outfit in white and blue.</p>
<p class="western">Her smile was somewhat plastic, “|<b>You are our seven million, seven hundred and seventy seventh thousand, seven hundred and seventy seventh player, please wait a moment.... Error, non-standard connection found, calibrating.... Reconnection established…. Apologies for the wait, I will commence the infrared and sound wave scan. From now on, as soon as you put on your game helmet, you can start playing Second Life!</b>|” the girl explained with such cheerful, chirping happiness that it couldn't have sounded more forced to Harry's ears if she had choked on a Cheering Charm. He flinched as two metal orbs popped into existence and started circling him with red lasers that scanned up and down his body. It took about thirty seconds but he couldn't stop his eyes from watching them warily. “|<b>Okay, you are now ready to create your character. Before creating the character, I must warn you, you have only one chance to design a character. Once the character creation process is complete, your race, name, and looks cannot be changed. Please start creating your character!</b>|” the girl chirped as several lights exploded around the seventeen year old revealing several figures.</p>
<p class="western">“|<b>First, choose the race you like. We have humans, elves, dark elves, celestials, dwarves, beasts – featuring Wolf, Bird, Dog, and Turtle types, and elementals – featuring Boulder, Flower, Grass, Leaf, Tree, Water, and Wind spirits.</b>|” the girl explained, each of the mentioned species stepping forward and bowing their heads as they were mentioned. “|<b>Commercial jobs are also a feature of our game. These are: Archer, Bard, Barrier Master, Beast Warrior, Mage, Necromancer, Ninja, Priest, Summoner, Taoist, Thief, Warrior, and Wizard. Please bear in mind that your job class can be restricted by your starting Territory, as some job classes will not be available in certain continents.</b>|”</p>
<p class="western">Harry hummed, he looked at the figures floating in front of him.</p>
<p class="western">His eyes lingering on the Bird Beastman, on the large wings that gently stroked the air. He had always dreamed of having his own wings to be honest.</p>
<p class="western">“What sort of skills would a Bird Beastman possess? Advantages and disadvantages, that sort of thing,” he asked looking back at the violet haired girl who's smile became a little more natural.</p>
<p class="western">“|<b>Avian Beastmen possess the unique ability of flight, and the skill advantage Keen Sight, and Hearing depending on the breed of bird you select. However, due to the nature of Avians in general, your character will possess hallow bones, and have decreased stamina, strength, and endurance, but higher agility,</b>|” the girl explained, leaning forward slightly. He realised then that she was probably an actual person, her mannerisms were no longer so plastic or forced, so she must actually quite enjoy the game itself, but probably dislike having to go through character creation for new players.</p>
<p class="western">He eyed the other species. He had personally always been somewhat physically weak and easy to injure regardless of being a speedy little bugger. Dudley had proved time and again how easily he bruised, and it wasn't like the numerous broken bones and visits to the Hospital Wing at Hogwarts had done anything to disabuse him of the notion that he was squishy and fragile. Perhaps he should attempt something a little more.... durable? Robust?</p>
<p class="western">But still... those wings...</p>
<p class="western">“Is it possible for mixed species?” he questioned, glancing to the young woman. After all, Hagrid was half Giant and seemed to have obtained the best of both worlds, giant strength and endurance, human intelligence and magic, he just had to deal with the idiot human social repercussions. Fleur obtained Veela beauty, human control, and wand magic. Professor Flitwick obtained human magic and friendliness, but Goblin intelligence and battle prowess. If it was possible in real life, would it be possible within the game?</p>
<p class="western">The girl smiled, “|<b>Please allow me a moment to contact my Superiors. This is an unusual request, and we have not encountered it before. Please wait,</b>|” she chirped, eyes sliding shut.</p>
<p class="western">While waiting, Harry decided to question the creatures about their advantages and disadvantages, skills and other such things. Thus far, he had come to the conclusion that mixing Elf and Avian would be his best bet. Elves had an agility bonus that meant the mixing wouldn't cause it to suffer but also allow for over all more strength and durability, not to mention increased wisdom if he was understanding the game mechanics correctly (there was a high chance he wasn't, but it made <em>sense</em>, so surely it would?).</p>
<p class="western">“|<b>My superiors have spoken,</b>|” the girl chirped, jarring Harry out of his conversation with the Avian and Elven avatars. “|<b>Second Life policy has never encountered this request and thus there are no rules for or against it. Your request has been approved. Also, as your circumstances are unique, and since you are our very special seven millionth, seven hundred and seventy seven thousandth, seven hundredth and seventy seventh player our superiors will be providing you with a special advanced knack here at character creation. Please finish your character creation before selecting your advanced knack,</b>|” the girl explained happily as she waggled a finger in his direction, winking at him.</p>
<p class="western">Harry nodded slowly, “Alright, thank you very much miss. I would like to have Elf and Bird Beastman mix please,” he requested watching as the avatars all vanished and his new model appeared.</p>
<p class="western">It looked a fair bit like him, which was to be expected. Short, almost feathered black hair in a smooth attractive face, long pointed ears peeking out from the ebony strands, he was lean and almost willowy with long pure white feathered wings hanging from his back. He stared at the wings and felt a pang of regret. The avatar opened his eyes and revealed the same emerald green gaze Harry saw in the mirror every day.</p>
<p class="western">“Can you make the wings resemble those of a Snowy Owl, please? White with black speckles,” he requested and watched as the change occurred in front of him. He nodded, “That's fine thank you.”</p>
<p class="western">“|<b>Alright, Elf-Bird Beastman, confirmed. Hair colour: Black. Eye colour: Green. Wings: Snowy Owl. Will that be all?</b>|” she asked curiously, seemingly a little surprised, though over what he didn't know as he nodded mutely. “|<b>What would you like your screen name to be?</b>|” she inquired.</p>
<p class="western">Harry was silent for a moment, “Hedwig,” he decided.</p>
<p class="western">“|<b>My apologies, Player, but that user name has already been taken. Would you like a list of untaken variations?</b>|” the woman asked before beginning to list off a collection of five at his nod.</p>
<p class="western">“Confirm White Hedwig please,” Harry decided.</p>
<p class="western">“|<b>Name confirmed. Where do you wish to start your adventure? Each Region has its own theme, items, advantages, and monsters.</b>|”</p>
<p class="western">“Please randomly assign me,” Harry stated roughly. He had probably made a mistake in his character, and was finding it very difficult to keep his own feelings of melancholy down. Choosing to model his character after Hedwig so soon after her death wasn't particularly clever, it felt rather like picking at a still open wound. Already memories of that damn green light and her death screech were filling his ears, drowning out any explanation the chirpy woman was giving.</p>
<p class="western">“|<b>Please decide on your advanced knack!</b>|” the woman demanded loudly, snapping her fingers in front of his face, suddenly <em>there</em>, her floating chair in front of him making him jolt back to the land of the living. She sat back with a short huff, her pretty face twisted in annoyance for all of a heartbeat before she smiled benignly once again. “|<b>Here is a list of advanced knacks, and what they do,</b>|” she explained, flicking a wrist and summoning up a board of information in mid-air for him to read.</p>
<p class="western">Swallowing his depression, he read through them quickly.</p>
<p class="western">“I'll take Steel Wing please,” he said. It seemed like the most useful, he would be able to use his wings as a shield or even as a weapon if need be; pluck a feather, and use it as a sword if he lost his weapon or had a need for throwing knives.</p>
<p class="western">“|<b>Advanced knack confirmed. Thank you for playing Second Life. Hopefully I'll be seeing you in the game White Hedwig, have fun and remember that if you need any help anyone in the Newbie Village will be happy to answer your questions!</b>|” the violet haired girl chirped as light flooded the room. Harry glanced at his avatar as he felt himself move, the two of them falling back and towards each other.</p>
<p class="western">White and black feathers flooded his vision, brushing across his skin in a painfully familiar caress that made his chest ache, and his eyes burn as he remembered his beloved pet. Everything about her. The bubble of happiness when Hagrid presented her cage to him, and told him that she was his. Harry's very first real birthday present, and his constant dear companion. Her fiercely intelligent golden eyes, her fluffy white feet and black patterned feathers. How she would tilt her whole head when she 'rolled her eyes' at him, how she would cuff him around the head with a wing when he was being melodramatic or selfish or stupid. How she would bring her kills back to share with him, and chirp demandingly when he got quiet and withdrawn, demanding attention and affection from him. Sunlight shimmering on powerful white wings, the soft coo and squeaks and barks, the smooth soft feel of her feathers, the pinch of her talons. Her bright amber eyes and how she would blink slowly at him in regal consideration, and how she screeched and rattled her cage furiously whenever Uncle Vernon raised his voice, or spoke aggressively at him.</p>
<p class="western">The world rushed past him, and he squeezed his eyes shut against his tears as everything jarred to a stop, and went black.</p>
<p> </p>
