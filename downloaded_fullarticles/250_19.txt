    <p>
  <span>When she was younger all she dreamed of was fire. Since before she could even remember as a young girl the fire consumed her thoughts and dreams and would not leave. Even when she had dreamed of her parents demise it ended in the bright glow of fire and the smell of smoke. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She would wake coughing as if he lungs were filled with the acidic smell of wood and flesh burning. Her aunt, who didn't treat her as she deserved but wasn’t as terrible as she would have been if she was born male, took her to doctors trying to figure out what was going on. Many suggested it was latent memories of her parent’s deaths. But to her it just did not feel right. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And so next her Aunt turned to spiritualism. It was there that she fell in love with God. Her nightmares abated slightly to the point she was not waking up with a scream on her lips every night. In the church she felt loved and wanted.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And then she was sent to Hogwarts. Hogwarts where her parents went. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She was excited at first but then she was crushed when everyone wanted to be her friend because of her supposed fame. It was he parent’s sacrifice that saved her, not anything she did herself. She just didn't get it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The only saving grace was the fact that she was sorted into Hufflepuff and they were content to leave her be for the most part. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The years dragged on and slowly she was made the martyr in the war against Voldemort. These were her people and regardless if they liked her or not they needed her. And so when she willingly walked her death she didn’t hesitate. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She walked with the ghosts of her parents and Sirius, the feeling of </span>
  <em>
    <span>love love love</span>
  </em>
  <span> in the back of her mind clinging to her. The resurrection stone clenched tightly in her hands, her cloak of invisibility on her back like a mantle. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Voldemort jeered at her as she arrived in the clearing and unseen in the forest a shadow watched closely beckoning her forward chanting in their mind, </span>
  <em>
    <span>master master master</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jeanne Lyra Potter willingly walked her death. But unlike her past life where she </span>
  <em>
    <span>burned burned burned</span>
  </em>
  <span>, she woke up once more.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>But this time she woke up forever cursed to an eternal life.</span>
