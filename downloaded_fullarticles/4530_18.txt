    <p>A chime sounded through Number 12 Grimmauld Place letting Harry Potter know he had someone attempting to give him a Floo Call. He sat up on the couch groggily and ran a hand through his hair before standing and waving his wand over the mantle in order to open the network and accept the call. Andromeda's face appeared shortly after with a small smile.</p><p> </p><p>"Harry, would you pick up Teddy today? I'm not feeling well."</p><p> </p><p>"Of course, you know I don't mind. Do you need me to come through and prepare some soup or something?"</p><p> </p><p>"Harry you couldn't cook if your life depended on it, sweetheart," she spoke softly before having a small coughing fit. "I'll be fine. I just need to rest for a few days." Harry looked concerned but nodded anyway.</p><p> </p><p>"I can keep Teddy for a few days, I'm still on paid leave from work because of the last surprise interview and all the work I've been assisting the aurors with." He put a hand to his forehead and slid it slowly down the rest of his face.</p><p> </p><p>"You may as well just be an auror, Harry."</p><p> </p><p>"I know it pays well, but I really like teaching. It's a better pace." He shrugged then took on a concerned face yet again. "Are you sure you don't want me to call St. Mungos or anything?"</p><p> </p><p>"I promise I just need to rest, Harry. I don't need you to play savior today. Just take care of Teddy." Harry nodded and Andromeda yawned before removing herself from the flames. He watched the green flames flicker out before looking at his somewhat old wristwatch to check the time.</p><p>He still had an hour or so before school was out, but it had been a while since Teddy stayed with him so he decided he could pick the little guy up early. What could possibly be going on in year five?</p><p>Harry got himself dressed and threw on his plain robe before rushing out the door replacing the wards and moving to the apparation point on the sidewalk in front of the house. He focused on the thought of the elementary school he just recently found out existed since his graduation from Hogwarts. The name had been changed after the war and was now <em>Dumbledore Primary Wizards Academy</em>. It was a public school fir young wizards whose parents couldn't or refused to homeschool their children. Although the students were too young to be taught magic they were taught of it's existence and teachers used magic as a tool during lessons.</p><p>He finally grasped a clear image of the school and felt the familiar tug that let him know he was in the midst of apparating. Once he landed he had to take a moment to steady himself, no matter how often he did it, it still seemed to catch him off guard. Maybe that's why he wasn't an auror.</p><p>He quickly walked up to the building, already planning on taking Teddy for ice cream. It wasn't yet the end of summer and Harry was going to help his godson enjoy all of it, even if they did have homework and lesson plans to get done. He headed for the office and quickly signed Teddy out then made his way to the classroom to watch a little of the class.</p><p>It didn't take long for him to find Teddy once he peeped into the window. Teddy was seated in the far corner away from the rest of the class, facing the wall with flaming red hair while the rest of the class was watching the teacher explain fractions using her wand to write the numbers in the air. He sighed and raised his hand to knock on the door, this always happened. Before Harry could knock he felt a faint tugging on his pants and heard a small sniffle. He looked down to find a head of pale blonde hair and huge, watery, startling grey eyes.</p><p>"Well hello," Harry spoke with a smile. The kid was crying a tad too much to speak so he waved and tried to stop himself from sobbing. Big boys didn't cry. His daddy told him that when he was begging his daddy not to send him to school before they left the manor. Harry squatted down until he was around eye level with the child. "What's your name, little guy?" Harry assumed it was a little <em>guy</em>, but the kid was in serious need of a haircut.</p><p>"S-Scorp'us." The kid rubbed his eye with his fist then wiped his running nose with the sleeve of his own robe which Harry had to admit looked very well kept up and probably designer. He chuckled at the thought. <em>Who would put a kid in designer robes? "</em>W-what's your's?" Woah, and the kid had manners.</p><p>"My name is Harry."</p><p> </p><p>"Nice t-to meet you 'Arry."</p><p> </p><p>"Nice to meet you too, Scorpius. So uh how old are you?"</p><p> </p><p>"My d-daddy says I'm p-practic'ly 5 and 3/4." Harry nods while smiling at the little boy.</p><p> </p><p>"Wow, really?"</p><p> </p><p>"<em>Really </em>really! My daddy doesn't lie," said Scorpius wiping away the last of his tears and looking wide eyed but seriously at Harry.</p><p> </p><p>"Do you mind if I called you Scorp?"</p><p> </p><p>"No. That's what my daddy calls me sometimes too, but he says Scorp'us is more extinguished." Harry laughed at the child.</p><p> </p><p>"I think you mean <em>distinguished." </em>Scorpius just shrugged while wiping at his nose.</p><p> </p><p>"I don't know. Daddy uses big words a lot. He says I'll learn them all when I'm older."</p><p> </p><p>"Well, your daddy's right. Now, can you tell me why you were crying before?" Harry asked tilting his head to the side slightly. This kid looked familiar.</p><p> </p><p>"I was 'posed to be waiting for Daddy in that boring room with the the huge desk, but I saw some pretty sparklers headed this way to one of the rooms down here. I forget which one, b-but then I couldn't find my way back..." His bottom lip began to tremble and his face went a tad bit pink as though he were about to cry again. Harry stood and lifted him off the ground, placing him on his hip easily.</p><p>"Lucky for you, I know exactly where you're supposed to be." He lightly tapped Scorpius' nose and the kid giggled and smiled, showing a mouth of pearly whites only missing one tooth off to the left side on the top. He wrapped his arms tightly around Harry's neck in a hug.</p><p> </p><p>"Thank you 'Arry!"</p><p> </p><p>"No problem, Scorp." This kid was just too cute. Harry decided to take Scorpius back to the office, then come back for Teddy. Something was special about Scorpius. He was adorable without a doubt, and he was really confident for a 5 year old, not to mention he just seemed so familiar to Harry, but he had no idea why.</p>
