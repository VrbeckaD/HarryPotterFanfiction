    <p>Harry flopped onto his back, sweaty and shaking slightly. He tried to swipe his hair out of his eyes, but he missed his face entirely and just let his arm fall onto the pillow above his head. </p><p> </p><p>"Bloody hell, Draco. What are you trying to do? Kill me!?" </p><p> </p><p>Draco flashed a saucy grin over his shoulder as he pulled his jumper over his head. "Clearly I'm trying to suck your soul out of your cock, darling. You'd better hurry and get in the shower. The Weasley duo will be here any minute."</p><p> </p><p>Harry sat up in bed and looked at the clock on his nightstand. The green numbers showed that he had less than 20 minutes before his friends were due to arrive. "Damn! If I don't shower they'll know exactly what we were doing, and Ron will tease me all night." Draco was trying to put his trousers on. "Oh no you don't, pretty boy! If I'm going to be late, so are you." Harry growled as he hooked a finger into a belt loop. </p><p> </p><p>Draco let out a delicate yelp, knowing that he couldn't overpower Harry. He managed to yell "Unhand me, you fiend!" right before Harry tossed him over his shoulder and carried him into the shower, turning the cold water on both of them. </p><p> </p><p>The pair were making their way down the stairs when they heard the clatter of the Weasleys coming through the fireplace. Draco followed Harry into the sitting room and waved at the newcomers. "Hermione, Weasley, keep this one in line, will you? I'm off, pet, don't get into too much trouble." He smacked Harry's tight arse and ducked into the hall to escape. </p><p> </p><p>Harry turned to his two best friends with a bright red face. "Sorry about him. Do I smell take away?" </p><p> </p><p>"You are NOT changing the subject so quickly! We can see that your hair is still dripping from a shower, Harry. We know what you've been doing, you filthy monster." Hermione made sure to poke him in the side multiple times to punctuate her remarks. "How long is this going to go on before you two actually accept that you're in a relationship?" </p><p> </p><p>Harry was shocked. He stood opening and closing his mouth like a fish out of water for several seconds. "We're just friends, Hermione." </p><p> </p><p>A sound very similar to an explosion came from Ron, "BAHAHA! Harry! Friends don't fuck each other like that!"</p><p> </p><p>"What!? Of course they do. Look at you and Hermione!" </p><p> </p><p>Hermione sat primly on the sofa and started unshrinking the boxes of take away they'd brought for dinner. "Ron and I were dating for six months before we had sex, Harry." </p><p> </p><p>Harry's arms fell to his sides, and he thumped down onto the sofa next to Hermione. Without thinking, he accepted a box of lo mein and then just stared into it. After a few minutes of glaring at his noodles he perked up. He grabbed a fork and shoveled food into his mouth. "It's called friends with benefits. I read that in a muggle magazine." He said, rather satisfied with himself for remembering that.</p><p> </p><p>"Yes, I suppose you could call yourselves that. But usually, friends with benefits don't live together." </p><p> </p><p>"Draco doesn't live here, Hermione. He lives at the Manor with his mother." </p><p> </p><p>Ron, who up until now had been steadily working his way through three different boxes of food, swallowed and looked at his best friend. "Mate. You know I will support you in anything you choose to do. I was the first to get behind you when you decided to be a writer instead of joining the Auror Corp. But I gotta tell you, you're wrong here, buddy. Think about it. When was the last time blondy went 'home'?"</p><p> </p><p>Harry sat for a while, chewing a bite of teriyaki chicken that suddenly tasted like sand. "No no no. We're just friends. Just friends." </p><p> </p><p>Hermione smiled and thankfully changed the subject. "Are you working on any new projects?" </p><p> </p><p>Relieved, Harry spent the next hour telling them about the plot he was thinking about for his next book. After that, the conversation turned to Ron and Hermione's life, and the plans they were making for the house they were building in Ottery St. Catchpole. </p><p> </p><p>When dinner was long gone, and the trio had gone through a case of goblin brewed beer, they were all draped over the sofa laughing about everything and nothing. In a lull in giggles, the silence seemed to hit Harry.</p><p> </p><p>"Shit." He mumbled to himself.</p><p> </p><p>Ron rolled his head to the side and looked at Harry blearily. "What's 'at Harry?" </p><p> </p><p>Hermione muffled a snicker behind her hand. "He said 'shit.' He's thinking about what we were discussing earlier." </p><p> </p><p>"What is so funny about that?" </p><p> </p><p>"Don't shout at me, mister. I'm not the one shagging Draco Malfoy and denying that I'm in a relationship with him." </p><p> </p><p>Harry huffed and crossed his arms like a petulant child. "S'not a relationship. Just two friends who like to fuck occasionally." </p><p> </p><p>That did it. Hermione fell off of the sofa in a fit of giggles. "He says they only fuck occasionally! Do you hear this nonsense, Ronald? We left and came back because we could hear them going at it in the shower!" </p><p> </p><p>Harry's dark expression turned embarrassed in an instant. His head snapped left, wild eyes on his friend. "You did not! Ohhhhh noooooo!" </p><p> </p><p>Ron chuckled and patted Harry on the arm. "Like you haven't caught Hermione and me in the act. No worries, mate." </p><p> </p><p>Harry sat forward leaning his elbows on his knees and burying his face in his hands. "Six months. Draco hasn't gone back to the Manor in six months. He has his own side of the closet, a toothbrush in the bathroom, and a favorite mug for tea in the cupboard. We're together aren't we? Like really together. A couple." </p><p> </p><p>Hermione struggled to sit up from her place on the rug. "Yeah, Harry. You are together. Is it a bad thing?" </p><p> </p><p>"I don't think it's a bad thing. I've been head over heels in love with him since sixth year. What if he doesn't love me, though?" </p><p> </p><p>Ron slid a large, warm hand onto Harry's back and rubbed soothing circles there. "If you can't see that he's just as much in love with you as you are him, you really need to see an eye healer. Are you going to talk to him about this, or just continue on as you have been?" </p><p> </p><p>"I'm definitely going to talk to him. No! Fuck that! I'm going to propose. I'm gonna make an honest man out of Draco Malfoy. I'm going to marry him. That's what I'll do! Perfect. I'm going to Gringotts. I have to go through all of my family vaults, and the Black vaults to see if I can find a suitable ring. Or should I buy him a new ring? Whatever, I'll figure it out when I get to the bank. Don't worry about cleaning up. I'll take care of it later. Thanks, guys! I'll see you later!" </p><p> </p><p>Hermione didn't know what was happening. Harry was talking so fast! "Harry. No! That's… that's not how this works! Harry, sit down! It's the middle of the night!" But Harry was gone. He had apparated away the second he said goodbye. </p><p> </p><p>"Oh shit. I think we're going to be planning a wedding, Ronald." </p><p> </p><p>Ron laughed and helped his wife stand up just as a blond head popped around the door frame. Draco was home. </p><p> </p><p>"Ooo! I love weddings! Whose are you planning? Can I help?" He was actually clapping his hands like a giddy little boy opening birthday gifts. </p><p> </p><p>"Believe me, Draco, you'll be helping plan this wedding. I wouldn't wait up for Harry. He's disappeared in a fit of inspiration. I'm taking my very drunk wife home before she makes any more messes. Night, Ferret." </p><p> </p><p>"Goodnight, Weasel." He watched as the two stepped into the floo, wondering what that was all about, and where Harry had gone at midnight on a Thursday. Honestly, you could never tell with Gryffindors. </p><p><br/> <br/> <br/> </p>
