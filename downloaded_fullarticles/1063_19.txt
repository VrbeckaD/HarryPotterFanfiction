    <p>The trick to being Tom Riddle's assistant is knowing every detail like the back of your hand. Better, even: Harry knows what coffee to fetch, and when, without having to be told, because he <em> knows </em>Riddle's wants and needs more intimately than he knows his own. This ranges from the practical, accessible sort of knowledge -- Riddle's color palette, the organization styles he uses for his desk, files, and bookshelves (all different, optimized for different things) -- to the more abstract: there is, for example, a list of words the man hates to hear, which Harry has steadfastly avoided ever saying even out of Riddle's presence.</p><p>The devil was in the details, frankly, and there was never going to be much contest between Harry Evans and any of Riddle's previous assistants anyways -- because Harry had twenty years of experience on the new hires that had churned the ranks before him.</p><p>Unexpected perks, he supposed, of being a narcissist's son.</p><p>Not that Riddle knew, of course. 'Evans' was just a stranger off the street, one he'd hired on the spot after ripping his old PA a new one in the middle of the street. And as the (in)famous CEO so often observed, Harry Evans was "everything I'd wanted my son to be -- if he hadn't..."</p><p>(...hadn't done this, hadn't made that choice, hadn't said that, and Harry smiled politely behind the mask of 'perfect assistant' because he'd heard this whole song and dance before and was now immune to it.)</p><p>Harry Evans didn't make the simple mistakes, because Hadrian Riddle already had, and his alter ego had already learned from them. He knew just how to deal with every one of Riddle's mercurial moods and strange demands...</p><p>Well. Until now.</p><p> </p><p>It was New Year's Eve, and that meant the board of executives was bringing their boss (their colleague, their <em> friend, </em> ha, Harry delighted in knowing the way Riddle talked shit about them all behind their backs) out to one of the most exclusive gentlemen's clubs in the world for their annual 'informal' board meeting. <em> Morsmordre, </em> was the name of the club; and Harry had heard several of his father's rare compliments directed toward the place in recent years, even given the company he kept while visiting it.</p><p>Speaking of keeping company.</p><p>"You know what," the man had decided on a whim just an hour ago, "I think you'll be around long enough to appreciate Morsmordre, Evans. Find something better to wear and come along."</p><p>Showing none of the flicker of happiness that tickled him at the subtle praise, Harry had promptly Apparated back to his flat to get ready. He'd showered and shaved and adjusted his hair with his scarce Metamorphmagic to get it to lie in the suave wave Hadrian never managed; he'd coordinated his very best suit down to the scent he was wearing, and returned to the office minutes before Riddle did. The man's glance, smirk, and approving half-nod, when he appeared, had warmed Harry like the sun; and he'd basked in the praise all the way to the club.</p><p>The problems started not long after they arrived.</p><p>Twelve men, Riddle, and Harry sat in the front section of Morsmordre, less than five feet from the dancers' platform, arranged around three large booths with tables. Riddle, on arriving, had gestured to Harry to sit at his left, the better to mutter insults about the 'inner circle' under his breath and make Harry order his drinks. That was not one of the problems.</p><p>The dancers for the night were a troupe of part-Veela on tour from the Continent, male and female and otherwise. That was not one of the problems, either. (Harry had immunized himself against Veela after Hadrian got an earful about 'losing his dignity in public' at the '94 World Cup.)</p><p>No, the problems were five in number. Five immaculate fingertips, to be precise, resting lightly on Harry's shoulder and sliding slowly down his arm.</p><p>Riddle had laid an arm carelessly around Harry's shoulders on his second drink, and was playing with the fabric of Harry's shirtsleeve while he sipped at his drink (he was now on the third) and watched the Veela dance.</p><p>Harry's mouth had gone dry the minute he'd realized what was happening. He carefully modulated his response to the continued stroking of his arm by that hand, taking calculated sips of his virgin martini and willing his hands not to shake. Hadrian was the one who got teased for being high-strung. Harry wouldn't give away any sign of how uncomfortable this made him.</p><p>He could, however, moderate the man's intake, if he was inclined to drink at this pace all night. Harry eyed the empty glasses in front of his boss (his<em> father, </em> his brain reminded him unhelpfully). "Sir," he asked, "would you like a refreshment course?"</p><p>"Hmm..." Riddle rolled his shoulders, and crossed one leg over the other, so that the heel of his shiny black shoe was less than an inch from Harry's knee. "You know, Evans, I think I would." Harry waved a server over to place the order -- strawberry and blood-orange agua fresca, and the lamb skewers, easy on the garlic. (He'd already looked at the menu and picked out what Riddle would like best.)</p><p>As the woman set off with his order, Riddle's thumb rubbed circle's into Harry's shoulder. "Smart boy," he sighed, sounding very pleased. "I'd have regretted leaving you behind, I think."</p><p>Harry sipped at his martini in lieu of answering.</p><p> </p><p>The dancers' group routine rounded down to an end just as the server brought the food and drinks for the table. Riddle took a long drink of the agua fresca, humming approvingly at the taste; he set down an empty glass, then reached for a skewer, snagging the first section in his neat white teeth and tearing it off the bit of wood with relish. Harry passed him a napkin before he had to ask; thankfully, Riddle had to stop touching him in order to take it, wiping delicately at the corners of his mouth.</p><p>Harry breathed a mental sigh of relief, but it didn't last long. "Give this a try, Evans," his boss said, and held up the skewer to Harry's mouth.</p><p>Peripherally, he was aware of the questioning stares from everyone else at the table. But Harry had learned not to care what Riddle's colleagues thought of him. Hadrian had already shown weakness in shrinking beneath their gazes, once.</p><p>He leaned forward a little, tugging a mouthful off the skewer, and took his time savoring it. If he glanced up at Riddle through his eyelashes while he did, it was just watching for any change in his expression to indicate he'd done something wrong. "It's quite good, sir," Harry said when he'd swallowed the morsel, licking his lips.</p><p>"Isn't it?" the older man agreed. "Here."</p><p>And he wiped Harry's mouth with the same napkin he'd used for himself, just as delicately.</p><p>The spots of red that bloomed high on Harry's cheeks were just surprise, he told himself; surprise and the extra kick of spice in the lamb marinade. He drew on Occlumentic exercises to slow his racing pulse.</p><p>Harry hardly registered the return of Riddle's hand to his shoulder, when the napkin had been set aside. Riddle uncrossed his legs, splaying out on the leather seat, and sipped at the remainder of his drink while Harry ordered him another. The dancers, having fanned out from the stage, were making the rounds for individual dances now; the Lestrange brothers were waving over three of the men to their table, holding up hundred-Galleon chips that glinted in the low lighting.</p><p>Oh Merlin, did they really have to... yup. The dancers were coming over. Harry wished he could appreciate their beauty, but this wasn't the time. "Good evening, gentlemen," purred one Veela with a lascivious expression and a rich accent. "We hope you are enjoying the show..?"</p><p>"Simply marvelous," Riddle purred back, and the man who'd spoken actually bit his lip, looking him up and down. <em> Sweet Salazar, </em> Harry thought, borrowing one of his father's favorite phrases, <em> he's flirting back, someone save me from this hell. </em></p><p>The other two men were beginning lap dances for the Lestranges. Harry resisted the urge to shift uncomfortably when the third dancer looked <em> him </em>over, gaze landing on his shoulder, where Riddle was thumbing circles into the fabric of his shirt again. Thankfully, the Veela focused his attentions on his boss instead. "Could I interest you in a dance, Mr...?"</p><p>"Riddle," Harry's father smirked. "Tom Riddle. And by all means...entertain me."</p><p>The next glass of Dark Mark (a blend of reserve Maker's Mark whisky and magically enhanced aromatics, Morsmordre's signature cocktail) made its way to Riddle' hand with a quick bit of wandless levitation on Harry's part, so as to avoid bumping into the dancer's lithe body while he worked in Riddle's lap.</p><p>If Harry had held out some hope of Riddle being distracted by the dancer, that hope died a quick death. The man had spread his legs a little more, to accommodate the motion of the Veela's hips, and in doing so was pressing his knee and thigh flush with Harry's.</p><p>It could have remained weird-but-innocuous were it not for the way Riddle leaned to the side and took a deep breath of Harry's cologne, a moment after, sniffing at the juncture of his neck and shoulder. "Don't <em> you </em>smell good," he purred in Harry's ear, a hundred times as flirtatiously as the playful banter with the Veela, before sitting back up and sipping his drink as if he hadn't said anything at all.</p><p>His leg was still against Harry's, though, warm and firm through the fabric of Harry's trousers. And... rubbing up and down just a little, in time with the slow slide of his fingers now returned to Harry's sleeve.</p><p>The club's music was just loud enough to cover the thumping beat of Harry's heart, he hoped. He set his martini down and unbuttoned the top button of his shirt; was it hot in here, or was it just him? Had they put a little alcohol in his martini, by mistake?</p><p>The fingers toying with his sleeve slid further down past his elbow to worry at a bit of the rolled-up cuff, and Harry couldn't hold back a telltale flinch when Riddle's breath fanned out against his ear, this time. "Flustered, <em> Harry?" </em></p><p>"Sir --?" Oh Salazar, his voice was betraying him. Harry Evans wasn't supposed to sound this breathy.</p><p>The hand gently encircled Harry's arm and lifted it up to the back of the seat, so Riddle's fingers could glide over the warming skin of his left forearm, tease feather-light over the bumps of his wrist, and draw little circles in his upturned palm. The touches were sending shivers up his shoulder and down his spine, raising the little hairs on his arms and the back of his neck. "Isn't this a treat," Riddle murmured, leaning in closer. He brought his mouth up very close to Harry's ear and... licked his lips.</p><p>Harry's breath hitched, and he knew he was flushing down his neck and chest now.</p><p>"That's right," his boss -- his <em> father, </em> Merlin help him -- sighed against his earlobe. "Just like that, Harry..." He interlaced his fingers with Harry's for just a moment, squeezing his hand, and let go, sliding up his arm again to rest back on his shoulder.</p><p>For the first time in several years, Harry found himself genuinely afraid of Tom Riddle. He had no way of knowing just how much of that fear showed in his eyes now, as the man took another sip of his drink. Harry didn't attempt to reach for his martini again; he left his hand on the table instead, not trusting it to be steady if he lifted it, and resisted the urge to thumb idly at the stem of the glass. He wished he could drink, though. His throat was as dry as the desert.</p><p>"When did you start working for me, Harry?" Riddle asked, languidly casual.</p><p>"March fourteenth, s-sir," Harry answered, cringing inwardly at the stammer.</p><p>"Mm... is that so..." the man considered, as if he didn't already know. "And in all this time, Harry, never have I heard you lose composure... until today."</p><p>Harry made a futile attempt to swallow around the growing lump in his throat. He braced himself for a round of being bullied over it, but was then reminded that <em> Riddle didn't see Harry Evans as his son. </em></p><p>"My perfect assistant," Riddle went on with a sigh, "so flawless. So poised. So <em> together." </em> His breath raised goosebumps on the side of Harry's neck. "I find myself driven to distraction with the urge to see you... shaken. Trembling. Yes... <em> flustered." </em> The last word nearly a hiss, so breathily did it leave the man's lips.</p><p>"Sir," Harry rasped, "please --" <em> please stop talking, please let me go -- </em></p><p>Riddle's breath hitched. "Oh, <em> Harry." </em> His hand lifted from Harry's shoulder, instead snaking around his waist. "You absolutely maddening little tease."</p><p> </p><p>A large portion of Harry's inner monologue was currently screaming. All of him that was Hadrian Riddle was telling him to pull away and flee, and never show this face in public again. He could do it, he knew he could. This was <em> wrong </em> this was <em> awful </em> this was <em> utterly terrifying </em> --</p><p>But he did not move. Harry Evans clung to his composure with all the grace that Hadrian Riddle's comportment and etiquette tutors had failed to impart in him over the years. Harry Evans kept his body as relaxed as it could be in this situation, and let Tom Riddle praise him in this sick, sick way.</p><p>Because Harry Evans would do anything for Riddle's approval, and only now was he realizing just how far he was prepared to go.</p><p>Absently, Harry drew out two hundred-galleon chips from his pocket and set them on the table in front of the dancer. Riddle followed the motion with his gaze, hand sliding down Harry's side to brush over his thigh. The Veela took the hint and finished a few more gyrations before standing up and sauntering off to the next person; and the minute his lap was free, Riddle gave a subtle nod toward the open space between his legs.</p><p>Harry bit his lip, and let the man's hand guide him over.</p><p> </p><p>"Even now," Riddle groaned softly, sliding his arm tighter around Harry's waist to pull him up against his back, "you handle yourself with such grace, my Harry." Soft lips brushed against Harry's earlobe, and he shivered, feeling Riddle's fingers dig into his side at the tremble. "Lie back against me."</p><p>Harry let out a breath as he sagged back against Riddle' broad chest, leaning his head back on his shoulder. He was... enjoying this, now that he'd pushed aside the part of him that was nauseated with horror. (In fact: he'd compartmentalized that bit into the smallest mental corner he could imagine, and sealed it there with the Occlumentic equivalent of prison wards.) Riddle had set down his drink; both his hands were wandering up and down Harry's sides, the man entirely uncaring of what anyone else might think of his behavior, as always. Harry supposed 'Hadrian Riddle' might have had something to say about that, but right now there was only him, and he turned his head a bit to stifle a whimper against Riddle's neck.</p><p>"S-ir --" he gasped, tensing like a bowstring at the sudden grind of a solid weight in the small of his back. Riddle began to unbutton Harry's shirt, tracing lightly over the skin each button exposed with his perfectly manicured nails.</p><p>"Yesss," Riddle breathed. "Harry, <em> my Harry. </em> All dressed up just for me, aren't you? Even down to your <em> scent.” </em> The hand unbuttoning his shirt moved up to his neck, tracing the soft underside of Harry's jaw with his index finger and thumb. "Do you want me to have you, Harry? <em> Do you?" </em></p><p>Harry bit his lip. He only hesitated for a second. "...I <em> do." </em></p><p>The admission left him shivering, skin flushing hot all over; even hotter was the <em> growl </em> Riddle made against his ear, the sound redirecting Harry's blood straight for his groin. "Then I will," the man said, voice low. "I've waited so, so long."</p><p> </p><p>He'd completely forgotten his surroundings, in the past ten minutes. Both of them had, really. The only thing that prevented Riddle from pushing Harry down onto the table, he suspected, was a desire for more space. The kind of space to be found in his bedchambers.</p><p>The rest of the Inner Circle watched, wide-eyed, as Tom Riddle Disapparated straight through the club's wards, his assistant in his arms.</p><p>"Rabs," croaked Rodolphus, "I don't think they'll be back."</p>
