    <p> Severus had never been one to show weakness. He hated feeling inferior to others, and being seen as anything but an equal, which was why he always went to great lengths to prove himself just as capable as every normal Witch and Wizard out there.
</p>
<p> Which was why he was sitting in a shadowy corner in a less than reputable tavern in Knockturn Alley. His dealer was well over an hour late, and Severus was feeling the pill he took yesterday morning beginning to wear off. 
</p>
<p> His legs bounced under the table, and he was all too aware of his untied shoelaces hitting the floor with a quick persistent tapping sound as he waited for his dealer to show up with his supply of Little Suppressants. 
</p>
<p> Oh yes, Severus Tobias Snape was a Little, but to everyone else, he was known as a baseline. He grew up in a household where ‘weaker’ classifications such as Little’s were scorned against. His parents often looked down on them, and called them a freak, and a waste of everyone’s time and energy. Especially his mother. She thought them disgusting, and a waste of magical talent. Unfortunately, others harboured these feelings of discrimination as well.
</p>
<p> Finally, he saw a woman in black robes slink in through the back door and make her way stealthily to their table. She sat across from him, looking him over for a few seconds before her mouth quirked up in a small smile.
</p>
<p> “Ran out a bit early, have we? Might have to boost you up to a stronger dosage.”
</p>
<p> Severus scowled, but said nothing as he slid the bag of coins across the table in her direction. The woman took her time counting it, and checked it over twice before handing him a small white pill container. 
</p>
<p> His hands trembled as he struggled to get the cap off. For some reason, his brain wasn’t sending him the proper instructions on how to open the bottle, and as he fiddled with it, he got increasingly more frustrated. His face burned with humiliation, and he could feel his dealers eyes watch his every move.
</p>
<p> She was obviously waiting to see if he needed help opening it, but Severus didn’t want to give her the satisfaction of seeing him fail at such a mundane task. 
</p>
<p> Wordlessly, she reached across and plucked the bottle from his clumsy childish hands and popped off the lid easily, handing him back a single pill, before screwing the lid back on. He didn’t say thank you, nor was she expecting it. Instead, once she had left, he quickly put it in his mouth and placed the bottle in his bag for later use, and waited for it to work it’s magic. A few minutes later, his head was blessedly clear from all of the fuzziness and the muddled thoughts, leaving him feeling somewhat normal again. 
</p>
<p> On his way out the door, he tripped on his untied shoelace, and caught himself just before he hit the cobblestone road face first. However, his bag went flying out of his hand, as well as the pill bottle he had tucked safely away inside.
</p>
<p> Severus watched it with barely suppressed horror as it clattered it’s way down the almost empty street and came in contact with a young girl’s foot. She was dressed in Hufflepuff colours, and she paused, looked up from the thick Divination textbook she was reading, and glanced at it with curious honey coloured eyes. She stooped low to pick it up, the pile of curls on top of her head tumbled down, framing her soft plump face.
</p>
<p> All the potions professor could do was tense, as her eyes scanned over the label, and flicked over to him with a dawning expression of concern. Her pink lips parted, as if she wanted to say something, but they closed just as soon, and she gave him a pointed look of disappointment.
</p>
<p> And at that moment, Severus knew that the student was classified as a Caregiver.
</p>
<p> They simply stared at one another, both immediately knowing what the other person was by some sort of primal instinct. The girl was fiddling with the bottle, unsure of how to approach her Professor with this topic, but her compulsion as a Caregiver was much too strong to ignore it. 
</p>
<p> “Miss. Lovelace. I wasn’t expecting to see you here.” Severus’ voice was unnaturally high. 
</p>
<p> She gave a slight nod. “Professor Snape, neither was I if I’m being honest with myself.” 
</p>
<p>“I’m going to have to ask for that back.” He nodded his head towards the pills. 
</p>
<p> She bit her lip, face flushing with discomfort. “And I’m going to have to say a hard ‘no’ to your request.”
</p>
<p> Severus gave an involuntary shudder, as he tried to keep his temper from rising as well as keep his headspace from becoming too overwhelming. “You. . .” he hesitated, fingers curling inwards and making tight fists. “You don’t understand, this isn’t what it seems. Just. . .give me back the medication.”
</p>
<p> She raised an eyebrow. “You mean the completely illegal suppressant drugs, Professor?” 
</p>
<p> “Just hand them over, Miss. Lovelace.” He chewed on his fingernails nervously. “Please, this doesn’t concern you.”
</p>
<p> She hesitated once more, and shook her head. “I’m sorry. It goes against my very nature, I really wish I could do more to help you-oh!” Her eyes brightened and she smiled sweetly at him “Why don’t I get your Caregiver for you? And don’t worry, this little incident will stay between us.” She kindly offered, extending her hand for him to hold. “Perhaps your daddy or mommy? Just tell me who they are and I can have them here quick as a cricket.” 
</p>
<p> Bile rose in the back of his throat and he took a few staggering steps back, away from her pudgy hand. He clamped his teeth hard on his fingers until copper burst on his tongue. He didn’t have. . .he never had a. . .
</p>
<p> Tears sprang in his eyes and the girl's face filled with concern.
</p>
<p> “I’m sorry,” She tucked a stray piece of hair behind her ear, eyes widening. “I didn’t mean to make you upset, do you not have a Caregiver? Oh dear, Professor, wait, please don’t go!”
</p>
<p> But he was already fleeing in the other direction. She had caught him completely off guard with those words. His heart hammered in his chest as he flooed back to Hogwarts. As he was rushing down the corridors, he was aware of the odd looks he was receiving from both faculty and students. 
</p>
<p> They must know. The Hufflepuff must have told them! He was being irrational, but he was so stressed he couldn’t think clearly. On his way down to the dungeons, he collided with a foreing body on the stairs, and turned around to snipe at them but the insult died on his tongue as soon as he saw who it was.
</p>
<p> It was non other than Remus fucking Lupin.
</p>
<p> “Sorry, Severus.” He ran his hands through his light brown tousled hair. “ I didn’t quite see you there. Are you alright?”
</p>
<p> “It’s nothing you should be concerning yourself,” He snapped, fingers twitching restlessly. “It’s a private matter.” He had the strangest urge to start crying, but he clenched his jaw against the temptation. He had a vague notion Remus was Caregiver as well as an Alpha, and if he wanted to come out of this situation with his dignity and secret still intact he had to be very careful. 
</p>
<p> That, along with a few other reasons, was why Severus was so against Remus coming to Hogwarts to teach. Not to mention he was a werewolf and a danger to everyone at the school, but also Caregiver’s had an uncanny ability to spot Littles from kilometers away. Severus knew no matter how careful he was, no matter how good at hiding his classification, Remus was bound to sense something was off with him. It was in his nature, after all. 
</p>
<p> “Er, alright. Well,” Remus said awkwardly. “I’ll see you later then.”
</p>
<p> Severus didn’t give him a response. He didn’t stop until he reached his office, and he shut himself in with a huff of relief. Resting his head against the closest wall available, he gripped his hair so tightly at the roots he thought he might pull them out. 
</p>
<p>Those pills. . .It would take a week from now if he placed another order with his dealer for them to arrive. Not to mention how expensive they were, Severus had to save up for an entire month in order to afford the cheapest kind.
</p>
<p> A shuddering sob made its way out of him, and he clenched his jaw hard as to not make another sound. He couldn’t afford more anytime soon. He would just have to hold off as best he could until next month when his pay cheque came in. 
</p>
<p>. . .
</p>
<p> “Miss. Lovelace,” Remus looked up from the book he was studying and smiled warmly at her. It was always wonderful to meet a fellow Caregiver such as himself. “What might I do for you?” 
</p>
<p> The girl was hesitant as she sat down on his plush office chair, wringing her fingers together, and looking quite guilty. “Professor, I. . .” She turned red as she tried to figure out what to say. “I recently found something, and I thought you should see it.”
</p>
<p> She dug through her bag and handed him a small white pill bottle, which he took with great interest. Why, these were Muggle made, were they not? He turned them over in his hand, and read the inscription etched into the side. A feeling of dread washed over him, and he opened the bottle to confirm his worst suspicion. 
</p>
<p> They were suppressants, and strong ones too. These small pills were highly illegal to own. Mainly because there were one too many cases of parents finding out and hating their child’s classification, and forcing them to take this treatment so they might be a baseline. 
</p>
<p> It was considered cruel, to deny someone who and what they truly are. However, Remus could understand why someone might feel the need to get rid of their Classification. In the past, Submissive’s and Pets were often taken advantage of and bound to someone they didn’t wish to be bound to. Though things were better now, and laws were in place to prevent that type of scenario, Remus couldn’t deny it was still an issue in certain families. 
</p>
<p> He glanced back at Celeste, who still sat, not meeting his gaze. “Where did you find these?” He asked her softly. 
</p>
<p> “They were Professor Snape’s.” She swallowed. “He’s a Little, sir, I could sense it. I don’t. . .I don’t think he has a Caregiver.”
</p>
<p> Remus’ fingers subconsciously tightened around the container. He could feel his eyes widen in apparent shock, and his mouth slightly open as he tried to wrap his mind around this piece of new information. Snape. . .was a <em>Little?</em>
</p>
<p> No, no that couldn’t be. 
</p>
<p> He pushed away his own feelings, and focused on the situation at hand. “You’re saying that you took these away from a Professor?” He asked her, eyebrow raised. 
</p>
<p> “Well, they fell to the floor right in front of me. I picked them up to return them, but then I saw what they were, and I just couldn’t give them back to him! It goes against my very nature, I had no choice.” Her eyes filled to the brim with tears, and Remus offered her a handkerchief, which she accepted thankfully. 
</p>
<p> Remus closed his eyes, and pinched the bridge of his nose, taking a deep breath to steady his nerves. “I am well aware that you thought you were doing the right thing. But Celeste, you can’t just interfere in someone else business like that! I know you’re a Caregiver, but you still have not had the training that’s required by the Ministry to take care of a Little. What you think is best, might not be what’s right.”
</p>
<p> She sniffed, wiped her cheeks with trembling hands, and nodded. “I’m sorry.”
</p>
<p> “I know you are, but that still doesn’t change the fact that you made a mistake.” He leaned back, resting his head against his chair. “I want you to start attending the classes that are given to Caregivers, also you will be serving detention with Miss. Sprout next week. Does that sound fair?”
</p>
<p> Celeste looked upset, but she nodded and smoothed down her skirts. “Yes Professor.” 
</p>
<p> As she left, Remus thought over what happened, and deeply sighed. He would have to go and return these pills to Severus. He didn’t want to, it would be the most awkward conversation he would ever have with the man, but it had to be done. 
</p>
<p> The trip down to the dungeons was a short one. All the while, he was warring with himself on whether he should return the pills or not. He hated that Severus felt he had to hide who he truly was, but at the same time, he completely understood why he did what he did. And ultimately, wasn’t it his choice to decide if he wanted to slip into headspace or not?
</p>
<p> He just hoped he would make it before Severus had slipped fully into his role. It was way too dangerous for his mind to just be yanked out of headspace, so if Severus had slipped completely, Remus would have to wait until he was back into his adult self before giving them to him. 
</p>
<p> . . .
</p>
<p> He had been battling his headspace the entire day, and Severus was exhausted. It would be easier if he had his pills, but unfortunately, that wasn’t an option for him anymore. Those tiny white tablets were his lifeline, although they never really made his urges to suck his thumb or play with plushie’s disappear entirely, but it made his desires easier to handle. 
</p>
<p> His leg bounced restlessly underneath his desk, as he stared at the pile of essays that were in dire need of being marked. He knew if he tried to grade them, he would wind up doodling all over the parchment. It had happened before, and he had to debase himself and lie to a student saying he had spilled coffee over his assignment to avoid the utter embarrassment of giving it back with poorly done drawings of  bunnies all over it. 
</p>
<p> So what could he distract himself with? 
</p>
<p> Eyes flickering to his bottom drawer in his desk, he warred with himself on if he should open it or not. Inside that drawer lied his one and only comfort item he had. It had been an impulse buy, and Severus regretted it badly.
</p>
<p> His hands reached for the handle, and hesitated. He knew he shouldn’t be doing this, anyone could walk in and see him in such a weak state of mind. The drawer opened, and Severus’ breath hitched when he saw a bright purple piece of plastic hidden in the very back. He gritted his teeth together, determined to refuse himself, but his hand was closing in, and he grasped the thing tightly, and drew his arm back and simply stared at the offending item. 
</p>
<p> It was a pacifier. Coloured in the brightest most offending purple you could ever see, but Severus loved it dearly. He wasn’t sure when it had slipped into his mouth, but his head was in the clouds and he couldn’t find it in himself to care at this point. 
</p>
<p>He had never before let himself fully regress, but he allowed his mind to go fuzzy and disconnected every once in a while, and this was one of these times. It helped when things got a little too much to bear, and he had to calm himself and relax. 
</p>
<p> But something was wrong. He could feel himself going deeper into his headspace and pure unbridled terror unfurled in his chest. He was powerless to stop it, torn between wanting to spit out his paci to end the regression or stubbornly keep it in his mouth.  He was being torn in two by his adult mindset and his Little side, and unfortunately, the later was winning. 
</p>
<p> Knowing he couldn’t allow himself to be full Little, and in a surge of desperation, he spit out his pacifier and watched it hit the dirty ground with a wet thud. It rolled under his desk, and his breath hitched. 
</p>
<p> He wanted it back.
</p>
<p> Getting on his hands and knees, he reached under the desk for his paci, but he couldn’t reach it. Panic overwhelmed him, and tears blurred his vision as he sat back on the floor and began to whimper. 
</p>
<p> He tried once more to get it, but was only successful in pushing it further back into the dust, and as he was withdrawing his arm, his skin rubbed against the end of a nail that was sticking out of the wood and it tore into the skin, drawing blood.
</p>
<p> Feeling hopeless, and so utterly Little, that was the last straw for Severus. He began to sob, loud hiccuping breaths as fat tears rolled down his cheeks. He could feel himself get further and further away from his adult self, and he didn’t know what to do.
</p>
<p> So he just said there, knees curled up in his chest, crying earnestly into his hands. He didn’t want to be a Little! He didn’t want to slip! But it was too late, his memories began to grow distant, and his Little self came out for the first time.
</p>
<p>.. .
</p>
<p> Remus could hear faint whimpers from down the hall. His chest tightened with pity as he grew weary to Severus’ office, and his hand reached for the doorknob. Severus was crying, there was no doubt about that. He felt rude to just invade on his privacy, but if he waited too long he’d might not get the chance to give him the pills, but as he opened the door, and glanced at the boy who was crying on the ground, he knew he had already missed it. 
</p>
<p> He slowly walked in, and placed the pills on his desk, taking another look at Severus, who hadn’t realized someone had came in yet. Part of him wanted to go and comfort the poor boy, but it wasn’t his place to do so. Severus would just have to wait this out until he was out of headspace. 
</p>
<p> But how old was he? Remus looked him over once more, if he had to put a number on it, Severus was most likely around the younger spectrum, probably around two or three years old. Little’s often had a certain range of numbers they switched between, and only time would tell what ages Severus would be most comfortable in. 
</p>
<p> Was it safe to leave such a young Little all alone? No, it wasn’t. Anything could happen, he could puke and wind up choking on it, or he could have an accident, or he could fall and hit his head. . . so many things could go wrong. 
</p>
<p> He really should stay and at least watch him until he was his big self again, but he wasn’t sure what boundaries Severus was comfortable with. This regression was something neither of them were expecting to happen, he would like to talk to Severus about it before he did anything that might make him uncomfortable.
</p>
<p> Remus then realized that a pair of dark eyes were watching him between long pale fingers. They were wide, and frightened, but there was an underlying curiosity to them as well. Severus’ hands dropped from his face, and his dumb made his way into his mouth, and Remus was suddenly glad they were in the safety and privacy of Severus’ office. He doubted the Potions Professor would have liked people to see him in this state. 
</p>
<p> Severus was obviously distressed about something. He kept whining and mumbling something Remus didn’t understand. Finally, he pointed to under the desk, and Remus got down to inspect what Severus was pointing at.
</p>
<p> His gaze zeroed in on the bright purple paci that was seemingly abandoned, and he immediately grabbed it and cleaned it before offering back to Severus. The cub stared at it longingly for a few moments, looking between Remus’ encouraging face and the paci. Finally, he gently took it from him and popped it in his mouth and gave an excited squeal and slightly bounced up and down on his knees. 
</p>
<p> Perhaps now he should leave. Severus had what he wanted, and hopefully would be out of his headspace in a few hours. He could always ask a house elf to check in on him after all. Remus stood up to leave, ignoring the pull in his heart. 
</p>
<p> He had just reached the door when a panicked whine caught his attention. He turned back to look at Severus, and saw he was reaching for him and making grabbing motions with his hands.
</p>
<p> “Don’ leave!” He cried, and Remus sucked in a deep breath. 
</p>
<p> Shit. No matter how uncomfortable Severus might be when he gets big, Remus can’t morally leave him here all by himself. That boy needed comfort, and Remus was damned if he didn’t give it to him. He just hoped Severus wasn’t too angry at the end of all this.</p>
