    <p>Loey's gaze was locked onto her sister's lifeless hand sticking out from the pile of rubble as the rages of the battlefield were echoing in her ears. <br/>This was it. They were all dead. Her mother, her brother, and now her sister. Loey had not seen any of her friends in hours, so they might already be dead, too. Her heart stung at the very thought.<br/>She didn't curse the dead for having passed, but she cursed herself for not being with them. </p><p>With tears burning her cheeks, she grabbed her wand more tightly and sprinted towards the castle. Death Eaters were shooting spells at her, but she did not care enough to deflect them. Loey just ran, ignoring the green lights hitting the walls and ground mere inches next to her. <br/>The great castle walls she used to call her home lied broken before her, being nothing more than pebbles compared to what they had once been. Loey coughed, the dust making her lungs itch as she entered the castle. How had no spell hit her yet?</p><p>Loey's hasty gaze scanned the room. There where so many people fighting before her, but not nearly as many as there had been. Nevertheless, she made her way across the battlefield by hiding behind pillars and deflecting spells. She had no time to attack, only to defend. </p><p>She spotted her friends Ricky and Sarah fighting amidst the other fighters and manoeuvred her way over to them. Loey rushed from pillar to pillar and hid behind each one for as long as necessary until she was hiding behind her friends. They were fighting a deatheater, Loey didn't know which one, but she knew that they were winning.<br/>In one swift, dangerous move Loey shouted a spell at the deatheater, catching them off guard. It hit them straight in the chest and they slumped to the floor. The young witch quickly pulled her two friends towards her hiding place.</p><p>"What's going on?" Shouted Ricky over the sounds of the battlefield.</p><p>Loey's breath was ragged. "I have a plan to show you. Meet me in the abandoned classroom in the South Wing. I have to get Müller."</p><p>Before her friends could protest, Loey dashed off again. Luckily, the classroom was nearby.</p><p>***</p><p>Loey dragged Müller into the classroom where their friends were awaiting them. The redhead was wriggling in Loey's arms in an attempt to escape, but she just tightened her grip. </p><p>"What in god's name are you doing?!" Müller shouted, "there is a war going on outside! We need to help!"</p><p>The young witch sighed and promptly pushed her friend onto a chair. "I have a plan to prevent all of this."</p><p>Despite the dim lighting, Loey recognised the same battered appearance in all of her friends. Sarah's usually cosy sweater had been torn, just barely passing as clothing rather than lumps. Her eyes were hidden behind a mess of blonde curls. Yet, Loey still felt her fleeting gaze on her.</p><p>Ricky's long hair stuck to her sweaty forehead and even the cigarette resting in her mouth was crooked. Her shiny leather shoes were covered in dirt, but one foot was still tapping the floor impatiently like it always did.</p><p>Müller's hands and arms were so bruised that Loey found it difficult to imagine her fingers gliding over the piano as gracefully as they usually did. Her posture was tense and her glare deathly.</p><p>Ricky tilted her head. "Well? What did you call us in here for? What's your plan?"</p><p>Loey hesitated, biting her lip. "You are going to call me crazy, which I probably am, but what I am about to tell you is the absolute and entire truth. I can not guarantee that it will work, but it is the only shot we have to... stop this from happening."</p><p>Müller huffed. "The only shot we have is to go out there and fight instead of hiding behind desks."</p><p>"Let her explain. We have little time and fighting won't get us anywhere," Sarah warned. Müller nodded and crossed her arms in front of her chest.</p><p>"Thank you," said Loey, "I have found a way to travel back in time. Well, I haven't found it - I made it. I made a time machine."</p><p>Ricky snorted. "Yeah right." She patted Loey on the shoulder and moved towards the exit. "Good one."</p><p>The young witch was quick to grab her friend by the wrist. "Wait. Listen. Please."</p><p>The humour in Ricky's gaze faded as she saw Loey's serious expression. "Okay."</p><p>Loey let go of Ricky's wrist and rushed to a piece of furniture hidden in a remote corner and covered in a white sheet. Her friends' were eyeing her curiously. <br/>"I've been spending the past two years making it. Ever since Harry started Dumbledore's Army," She said and added in a sad whisper, "Ever since I knew that there would be a war."</p><p>She pulled the sheet down, revealing a silver machine with a platform in its centre. Multiple buttons, switches, and levers decorated the outside of it.<br/>Loey waved her friends to move closer. "We can use it to travel back in time and take care of You-Know-Who before he became evil. Before he could kill Harry's parents. Before everything." </p><p>Ricky and Sarah inspected the time machine more closely, letting their hands slide over the cold metal.<br/>Müller moved forwards, but had her arms crossed still. "Even if it works, it's too high a risk. We could make everything worse by completely messing up time." </p><p>"That's true. It's a huge risk, but I'm willing to take it." The determination in Loey's voice contradicted the soft look in her eyes.</p><p>The redhead shook her head. "You can't. I won't let you. It's too dangerous, not just for you but for all of us." </p><p>"Have you tested it beforehand?" Asked Sarah before Loey could protest. "To see if it works, you know." </p><p>"I have. I travelled back in time two hours at first, then two weeks, and finally two months. It went well every time," she explained, a grin spreading across her lips.</p><p>Ricky walked over to Loey and stood firmly next to her. "I'm with Loey. Let's do it."</p><p>"Are you out of your mind? We have too much to lose. You can't do this!" Müller pointed at the machine. "And you don't know if this will work when we want to go back in time numerous years." </p><p>Ricky took out her wand and lit her cigarette with it.</p><p>Loey avoided Müller's piercing gaze. "I don't have anything left to lose except you guys." The tears stung the corners of her eyes as she tried to hold them back. "They're all dead. My sister, Fred, mum, fuck even my brother." </p><p>A deathly silence fell over the group of friends. Ricky took the cigarette out of her mouth and slowly wrapped her arms around Loey. She didn't push her away, but she also didn't hug her back.</p><p>Sarah took a deep breath. "I'm with Loey as well. We have all lost people we love today and if there is even the slightest chance to bring them back, I'll take it. Even if the odds are against us." </p><p>They were all looking at Müller now. The readhead scoffed, but that turned into an exasperated sigh. <br/>"You're gonna be the death of me," she said and walked onto the platform.</p><p>The three friends smiled and Loey motioned her friends to join Müller, but moved to the main console herself. <br/>She was pushing various buttons and flicking some switches as she began her explanation, "Okay, we'll try to travel to He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named's first year at Hogwarts. The first thing we should so is contact Dumbledore, he will have only been the Transfiguration teacher back then, but I've heard that headmaster Dippet was kind of incompetent. Then we'll plan more with his help." </p><p>Loey looked up to her friends and smiled. "Clear?" </p><p>Müller grumbled, "I guess."</p><p>"Yeah," said Sarah.</p><p>Ricky put out her cigarette by stepping on it. "What?"</p><p>"Okay, let's go." Loey pulled a big lever and ran onto the platform. "We need to hold each other by the hand, I think."</p><p>And thus the machine slowly disappeared with the four friends.</p>
