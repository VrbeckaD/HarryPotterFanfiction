    <p class="p1"><b></b>Over the past five years at Hogwarts, the sight of the Black Lake always remained something of a comfort. The seasons came and went, but the lake itself seemed trapped in time, never changing and reassuringly familiar. Even after the Triwizard Tournament, Harry found himself entirely at ease in its company, and its deceptive, calm waters laying guard to some of Hogwarts more dangerous residents. A depth to it beyond that of water and land.</p><p class="p2">All the more so was Harry sure this to be the case now that he was a prisoner in the 1940s. The still waters hadn't changed in the years to come, even Hogwarts herself was distinctly different. From her very air to her classes and the faces wandering her halls, but the Black Lake was a being entirely its own.</p><p class="p1">It was precisely this reason that Harry had taken to sitting by the sandy edges of its waters since arriving. He hadn't had much a chance to lax by the lake in his own time, fighting and training for a war most likely something to do with that. But here, in this time, with its battles that have nothing to do with Harry, he finds himself able to spend breaks in more quiet moments like this. Surprisingly peaceful, pensive sort of moments.</p><p class="p1">His troubles, though, are far from gone. "<em>Debatably</em>," Harry thinks to himself, "<em>this is the most trouble I've ever been in.</em>" Which was concerning, to say the least. Harry, after all, had been through quite some tricky, troublesome situations.</p><p class="p1">But he was undoubtedly living the most he ever had while here in the 40s. And it was more than the weight of war lifting from his shoulders or the sudden knowledge that everyone he lost would be alive once again in a few decades. It was like Harry could be <em>just Harry</em>. Something he always said he was, yet yearned to be. He knew more than anyone that he was never <em>just</em> Harry, he was the Boy-Who-Lived, the Boy-Who-Lied, Gryffindor's Golden Boy, the leader of the Golden Trio, he was always something else. Some new moniker that shoved all Harry really was deeper into himself.</p><p class="p2">The 40s didn't know of the Harry to come, only the Harry of now. And the Harry of now was a blunt, stubborn, quick to stand up for his beliefs—<em>Slytherin</em>. He scoffed, remembering it. If the Sorting Ceremony for this time wasn't in the top five most significant shocks of his life, following Finding Out He Was A Wizard, Time Travelling To 1942, Becoming A Triwizard Champion and Realising He Could Speak To Snakes, in that order, then he would eat a flobberworm.</p><p class="p1">"<em>Four years of being a bloody Gryffindor and you would think the barmy Hat would finally let it go.</em>" Harry, out of his element and time, had just shrugged, accepted that this was all happening and there was nothing Harry could do to stop it. Though the long chat with the Hat certainly raised some brows and caused some lingering, contemplative stares that he could have probably done without. Especially after his unfortunate entrance to the past.</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">In fate's defence, if he had any choice in where and how he'd end up in the past, it probably would have gone equally as bad.</p><p class="p1">The first year Divination class he had suddenly existed into got a real kick out of it though.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">But therein lays the reason for his current (past?) troubles. There were an alarming amount of questions Harry, coming from the future and decidedly not very well read on most historical events, couldn't answer. The Where, Who, How and Why was all impossible, and he couldn't even think about tackling the When of his little problem. The professors seemed happy enough to make excuses and answers for him, though. Asking questions and receiving Harry's blank shock was sufficient for them.</p><p class="p1">The murmurs of Grindelwald and Accidental Apperation and a sudden shift in the war to English soil had all flown well over his head. But he did something very rare and kept his mouth shut. Happily letting the adults around him handle his new forming backstory and still dead on displaying the appropriate amount of grief and emptiness for his new heartbreaking situation. Realising he was in the past, unable to help stop his war and see his friends helped fuel that.</p><p class="p1">The students of Hogwarts, on the other hand, were much less easily convinced.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Never underestimate the curiosity of children.</p><p class="p1">Especially when those children were Slytherins.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Harry wasn't readily accepted into his new House. His year was starting <em>spectacularly</em>. He had given his mother's last name, Evans when the current Headmaster Dippet fished for some identification. Not wanting to completely mess with the past considering some Potter's were alive, his grandparents is a whole other topic he doesn't even want to think about, he thought it best to remain unconnected to any prominent Wizarding Households. His quick thinking saved him from some, no doubt uncomfortable, talks about bastard children. But it also put him in some hot water with the Slytherins. His new Housemates got caught somewhere between mild to extreme disgust, suspicion and curiosity for the enigma of a 5th-year transfer student.</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">But then, of course, there was Riddle.</p><p class="p1">Tom Marvolo Riddle.</p><p class="p1">Childmort, as Harry has so <em>lovingly</em> taken to calling Riddle in his head.</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">Childmort was in a league of his own. He was treating Harry with interest beyond what was appropriate, surely. It baffled Harry. He had no idea what he had done to be so interesting; he was as dull as possible. Sure there was the occasional disagreement with some members in the House, and sure he had taken to ignoring Riddle and all his gross oozing fake-ness. And yeah okay, he was quickly becoming a straight O student since arriving here.</p><p class="p1">Because who would have guessed that a not insane Voldemort world and a desperate need to find a way back to his time would result in so much of his attention placed in a couple of hundred different books on theory and other things he accidentally found fascinating and couldn't put down?</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">Harry couldn't have guessed, that was for sure. Hermione would probably cry. Ron too, but for different reasons.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Maybe Harry could understand a little. Riddle had this weird collection habit that reminded him strongly of their Potions Professor, Slughorn. But instead of a SlugClub, Childmort had something whispers in the halls were calling the Knights of Walpurgis. A collection of impressive students from impressive families, mostly from Slytherin but a few from other Houses. Harry had a sinking feeling it was version 0.1 of the Death Eaters and didn't want to deal with that mess even with a 2-metre pole.</p><p class="p1">So when one very uncomfortable Fraser Avery approached Harry two months into his disaster of a situation, on Halloween Day no less, Harry couldn't say he was surprised. He also couldn't suppress his hysterical laughter at the fact that Childmort of all people wanted to collect him, Harry bloody Potter, to be a member of his angst Dark Arts teen club that will one day happily go off and start a war and try to kill him more times than he was willing to count.</p><p class="p1">Of course, this was a poor move on Harry's part, and he should have expected the several hexes and curses that came his way. He was a formidable Duelist on all accounts, but even Harry knew he should have had some decorum and not laughed out right at what was considered to be high praise of an offer in the <em>Slytherin Common Room</em>. Hermione would have had a cow and promptly healed him, and Ron may have high-fived him if they were around.</p><p class="p1">But they weren't.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Which was how Harry ended up here at the Black Lake yet again. Considerably worse for wear than the other times he had come seeking sanctuary. But if anyone would ask he would give a bold grin and say "<em>You should see the other five</em>," and leave it at that.</p><p class="p1">His healing prowess was shoddy at best, a few Episkeys and a simple Tergeo could only get him so far. He would need to see Madam Klatskin eventually though he was dreading it. Out of all the Professors, Healer Klatskin seemed to want to mother Harry to an extreme; he wasn't used to it.</p><p class="p1">Harry sighed, his elbows on his bent knees as he stared out across the water. His wand was still in his hand, and the adrenaline hadn't quite died down yet, the nervous tick of energy kept him twirling it. Harry wanted to chew on his lip or bite the inside of his cheek to help calm him down, but his jaw hurt something awful, and he couldn't feel his legs at the moment, so jogging the tension off was out of the question.</p><p class="p1">"<em>Damn Riddle. He wasn't even there to see me turn him down, couldn't even bother asking me to join his creepy club himself</em>." Harry snorted at the thought, it sent a jolt of pain to the left side of his chest, but the pain was worth it at the idea of what Riddle's face might look like. Harry could picture it, when Childmort finds out that Harry had taken down five of his Knights at once and was still able to walk away, after telling him "no" in the rudest way possible. Riddle may need to look into some meditation to get through this one.</p><p class="p1">The careful silence of the lake had amplified the sound of slow rustling through the fallen leaves. Harry's attention was quickly brought to the direction of the castle, expecting a student or professor seeking him out. He was missing the Halloween Feast at the moment because Harry wasn't keen on finding out if the hostile tension had died down during a very public dinner. The Slytherins must be rubbing off on him, their "it stays in the House" mentality.</p><p class="p1">So Harry was genuinely surprised when no person was making their way toward him, but a snake. It was striking. The intense black colour of its scales didn't do well blending in with the Autumn palette surrounding it, but in the setting sun, the bold black was even more. Highlighted by a barely visible opalescent that could only be genuinely seen during times of the evening or early morn when the light was just right. In a brief moment of unsuspicious thinking, Harry felt the snake strongly reminded him of the Black Lake.</p><p class="p1">Harry had seen it around Hogwarts a few times, and when he couldn't see it, he heard it complaining about cramped classrooms, annoying hatchlings and cold dungeons. Harry had a sneaking suspicion that the snake was Riddle's or had some connection to him, so he made sure to avoid it and ignore its hisses. But the snake had other plans.</p><p class="p1">§<em>There you are hatchling. My Master has been searching for you. You will stay put; he approaches.</em>§ The snake raised it's head on to Harry's elbow, successfully climbing its way up and around to the top of his shoulders. He briefly considered ripping his outer robe off and running straight into the Forbidden Forest, but Harry couldn't bring himself to do it. The snake seemed kind enough and kept mumble hissing about how warm he was and how foolish its Master had been not to check here first when Harry so often smelt of fresh water and open air.</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">Harry sighed and much like his experience with the Hat, accepted that there was no way out of this. His Potter Luck wouldn't allow it.</p><p class="p1">He was also slightly curious to see if Childmort himself had come looking for him.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">§<em>Master, the hatchling is here</em>.§ It perked up, sensing the presence that was its Master. Harry was already looking exasperated as the snake's tongue shot out to scent his cheek. §<em>You have blood on your cheek Hatchling. You were very strong in the Duel. I had watched it from my place by the fire. You would be a suitable Mate for my Master</em>.§ Harry whipped around to face the snake head on when it said that, evident panic in his eyes, but he had enough control to keep his mouth shut, especially when the sounds of leaves crushing underfoot were too close to ignore.</p><p class="p1">"She won't attack you, Evans, she listens to me. No need to look so scared."</p><p class="p1">And there he was —Childmort in the flesh. Harry glanced up to cool grey eyes and a natural, almost smug smile. If Harry were a weaker man, he would punch Riddle in his very punchable pretty face.</p><p class="p1">'<em>Pretty? What am I thinking about?</em>'</p><p class="p1">The scoff came tumbling out before he could stop himself. "Scared of a snake, Riddle? I live in a dorm of them; I have no time to be afraid."</p><p class="p1">"Good," Riddle plopped down on the sandy edge beside Harry. It was almost impossible to think the word <em>plop</em> in association with the young Dark Lord, but nothing else felt more right. Yet Riddle was much too close in Harry's opinion, and it almost made him scowl irritably. Though, he had a feeling Riddle would only use that against him if he mentioned it aloud. "She rather likes you, and it would be a shame to have to tell her you were frightened of her."</p><p class="p1">"Does she now?" Harry's sceptical look only seemed to amuse Childmort further, his sharp smile fit right at home with his glinting gaze.</p><p class="p1">Riddle gave a careful, elegant nod. "Oh yes, Danh doesn't find you nearly as annoying as the others in our House. She also insists your bed is the warmest." Harry's well-crafted air of indifference he fought hard to perfect never seemed to last long in Riddle's company. He felt the moment his right eye twitched violently, and frown took over his features.</p><p class="p1">"She's been sleeping in my bed?" The snake, Danh apparently, reached out from Harry's shoulders. Almost as if she were turning her attention to chastise Riddle for telling her secrets. Her slight head bobbing up and down, tongue racing out of her mouth.</p><p class="p1">§<em>Master, you favour the hatchling more than I. This hatchling would make a good Mate, powerful and warm, this one will do nicely during the winter. I approve</em>.§ It took all of Harry's willpower and novice Occlumency to smooth out his features to an innocent frustrated confusion. The only tell? How tight the grip on his wand became. Harry was sure he could snap it in half with how wildly he was internally freaking out.</p><p class="p1">What in Merlin's name was this snake going on about? Mate as in friend? If that's the case, this snake was going to be very disappointed and cold during the winter because there was no way he and Riddle were becoming <em>friends</em> anytime soon. Or ever. He had meant ever.</p><p class="p1">Riddle glanced at Harry for a moment before giving his reply, §<em>He does not like me and wouldn't take kindly to my sudden claiming him. This is a battle best fought slowly, and I don't want to push him away.</em>§</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">Claiming him? Oh, hell no. Harry was at his breaking point.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">"Why are you here, <em>Riddle</em>?" Harry said his name like venom dripping from his clenched teeth. "Haven't you and your goons done enough today? Does your snake need to harass me too?"</p><p class="p1">"Goons? That's hardly fair, Evans. And it was not my intentions for any hostility. I've been meaning to reach out to you myself in hopes of asking you to join an...<em>after hours club</em>, of sorts. We have a meeting after Slughorn’s soiree. Sadly, my free time earlier was taken from me by last-second Perfect Duties. I would have asked you myself, and surely we would have avoided any of the...incidents that took place earlier."</p><p class="p1">"You're saying if you had come up to me and asked me to join your...<em>club</em>, yourself and I had laughed directly at your face. You wouldn't have hexed or cursed me out of pure frustration and rage for not getting your way?" Harry stared incredulously, a single eyebrow arching well into the messy fringe of his hair. There's no way Riddle thought Harry believed that for even a second. It wasn't possible. Harry refused to accept such a reply wouldn't be met with anger, especially from Lord Childmort.</p><p class="p1">"Of course," a far too charming smile graced his face. "I would never do anything so public. But I'm sure we can come to an agreement on the matter somehow. There must be something I can offer to persuade your interest."</p><p class="p1">Harry paused for a moment. Knowing Riddle, he would probably start throwing around words like power and influence so on and so forth. But it's been made clear by now that Harry didn't need power, he had it in spades. Influence didn't tickle his fancy much either. Which was only solidified by his absolute refusal to join Riddle's little club or the way he doesn't try at all too cosy up to the Slytherins while maintaining a bright untouchable persona.</p><p class="p1">Even more so, with how obvious the Slytherins reluctantly respect him and don't bother to make nice, the other Houses have caught interest. Harry was reasonably popular outside the Snake Den and got along with a wide variety of Hogwarts' students. He could proudly say he was one of the select few to see the infamous Hufflepuff Common Room and the Ravenclaws enjoyed having him in the Library during Trivia night. As an ex-Gryffindor, he blended right in, and easily helped with practice on the Quidditch Pitch. Much to the ire of his Head of House and House Team.</p><p class="p1">Harry was almost curious to see what Riddle would try to use to ensnare him with, but he was also beyond intrigued that Childmort was so blatantly fishing for something to use instead of assuming. It's clear to Harry that he has the upper hand right now, only what card to play?</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Then it hits him.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">"How about this Riddle," Harry starts slow and purposeful, carefully watching Childmort's expressions. Riddle was already displaying a delicate interest, no more than necessary, of course, but Harry could see the surprise lingering in his eyes. Clearly, Mr <em>Persuade-Your-Interests</em> didn't think he was going to get as far as he had, his posture had gone lax at some point, and it immediately eased into an attentive and eager position. "When you find the Chamber Of Secrets —and don't look at me like that we both know it's only a matter of when. I want you to vow that you'll show it to, and explore it for the very first time with, me."</p><p class="p1">Harry cautiously rose to his feet, his body screaming in protest. The magic of Samhain was in full swing; the pure air had done a lot to heal his aches, but he could still do with that proper checkup. "If you agree to do that I'll come to your little get-together this evening. Now if you need me, I'll be in the infirmary."</p><p class="p1">Harry strolled away, enjoying the gentle early evening breeze. Snickering to himself as he replayed the frozen, dare he think, the <em>shocked</em> expression on Riddle's face. Harry was stepping into the castle when the moving weight on his shoulders quickly reminded him he was not alone.</p><p class="p1">§<em>Hatchling knows of Master's search for the Chamber? You are a very smart hatchling; I knew I picked a proper Mate.</em>§ It took every last bit of Harry's sanity not to reply something scathing in Parseltongue. He heaved a sighed and gently unwound the snake from his shoulders, carefully crouching despite everything in his body screaming not to, and deposited Childmort's snake on Hogwarts' floor.</p><p class="p1">"I'm sure you know how to return to the dorms without causing trouble, please head there and refrain from sleeping in my bed. I would appreciate it," Harry gave the snake a small pat on the head, he always did have a soft spot for them. "It was nice meeting you Danh."</p><p class="p1">The snake started slithering down the hall towards the dungeons; Harry swore she was laughing. §<em>Silly Hatchling, your bed is only warmest with you in it.</em>§ Standing, Harry rolled his eyes and made his way to Madam Klatskin.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Just another day in 1942.</p><p class="p1">Harry wondered if he would hear from Tom soon. How desperate was he to have Harry in his ranks? Only time would tell, and the night was still young.</p>
