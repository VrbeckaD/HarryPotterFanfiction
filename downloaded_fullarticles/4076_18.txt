    <p>“Come on Fred let’s go to the states and party” George said blocking Fred’s way from walking into their house.</p>
<p>“Why would we want to do that? Why can’t we just party here?” Fred said moving his brothers arm in order to get through but it was no use.</p>
<p>“Come on we’re 21 and we can party in Vegas!” George said shaking his brother by the shoulders as if to shake some sense into him. “Come on just one night and if tomorrow you decide you don’t like it well come back to work as if nothing happened” George pleated. </p>
<p>“Fine come on get your broom you fool” Fred laughed dragging his brother to get their brooms and fly over to Vegas.</p>
<p>                                         ~An hour later~</p>
<p>“Vegas baby!” George yelled as soon as their feet touched the ground.</p>
<p>“Come on Georgey lets go party!” Fred said dragging his brother behind him to start off a night filled with laughter and of course drinks.</p>
<p>                                  ~The next morning~</p>
<p>“Holy fuck” Fred groaned as he opened his eyes and an instant pounding from his head caused him to close them again. Trying to recall events from what on earth happened last night but all that ran through his head is flashes of chugging down drinks and big lights. </p>
<p>“Ow my head” Someone called next to him on the bed. </p>
<p>“George do you rem-” Fred said sitting up and throwing the blankets off his brother but instead he found a girl.</p>
<p>“Who are you!” The girl yelled clutching the blankets close to her body. “Where am I?” She said looking around the room and honestly Fred hadn’t really thought about where he ended up but when he looked around he knew exactly where they were.</p>
<p>“I’m Fred. Fred Weasley and we’re in my house right now” Fred said talking softly to the scared girl in front of him.</p>
<p>“Hi Fred Weasley I’m Y/N Y/L/N” Y/N says smiling at Fred. “Well it was nice to meet you but I think I should catch a cab and get back to my Hotel” Y/N said getting up still clutching the sheet close to her body. </p>
<p>“Oh well look at that I’m still dessed” Y/N said letting go of the sheet and looking around the room for her bag and shoes. “What street are we on exactly?” She said while still looking around the room.</p>
<p>“Number 93. Diagon Alley” Fred said his eyes following the Y/N as she looked around his room occasionally lifting up clothes thrown on the floor to see if her stuff was under it.</p>
<p>“Sounds funny it must not be far away from my Hotel” Y/N said looking up at Fred to give him a big smile.</p>
<p>“We’re actually pretty far from your Hotel” Fred said getting up slowly from his bed in order for his headache to not hurt as much.</p>
<p>“Haha what do you mean” Y/n said stepping closer to Fred and quickly noticing how much Fred towered over her and just how handsome he is, her face filling with equally part color and heat.</p>
<p>“Well we’re in England. London to be exact” Fred said scratching the back of his head avoiding eye contact with her.</p>
<p>“What I’m sorry I think I miss heard you. You mean you’re from England and we’re in America right now. Right?” Y/n says looking up at Fred ‘s face to see any sign of him joking around but for once in his life he wasn’t.</p>
<p>“No we’re in London right now” Fred said still avoiding eye contact with y/n.</p>
<p>“Yea okay funny joke. Greg was it?” y/n said finally finding her bag and looking through it to find her phone. </p>
<p>“Actually it’s Fred and no I’m not joking around we are actually in London right now and I’m afraid you can’t get back without my help” Fred said tugging at his hair because he couldn’t believe the chaos he was in.</p>
<p>“No I’m fine I can book a flight and be back in my room by tomorrow.” She said dumping out the contents of her purse on Fred’s bed because she couldn’t find her phone. Out spilled all the contents, loose change,magic box, receipts, paper, Mardi gras beads and some makeup but no phone.</p>
<p>“Fuck fuck” Y/n said as she threw eyeliner and a handful of change back angry inside her bag again. “I don’t have my phone but I have stupid useless shit in here” Y/n said as she uncrumpled the receipts and paper she had in her purse.</p>
<p>“Receipts for drinks, a hamburger, a magic box and a ma-” y/n stops mid sentence and looks at the two sheets of paper and Fred horrified. </p>
<p>“Ok these say we are married according to Nevada law and also according to the ministry of magic” Y/n said laughing as she looked up at Fred who still looked as horrified as she had.</p>
<p>“Hey Fred calm down I don’t think Vegas marriages hold up especially since we were drunk out of our wits and ‘The ministry of magic’ is obviously a joke shop in Vegas” Y/n said trying to calm Fred down not understanding why Fred was so freaked out about. </p>
<p>“Fred everyone is here!” George called from somewhere in the house.</p>
<p>“Shit umm Y/n just stay up here and I’ll explain everything once I come back” Fred said not even waiting for a response, going out the door and closing it behind him.Y/n follows close behind because she needed answer and there was no time to waste.</p>
<p>“Oh Fred you guys have a mess” Molly said waving her wand making all the dishes fly to the skin making them wash and out themselves away.</p>
<p>Y/n have seen this couldn’t believe her eyes, pinching herself to see if this was a dream and as soon as she realized it wasn’t the room started spinning. “Hey that’s a cool magic trick” was the last thing y/n said before collapsing down on the floor in front of the Weasleys.</p>
