    <p>The first time Draco received an owl from Harry Potter, he was eighteen years old and was sitting, alone, on his bedroom floor at the Malfoy Manor. He was sorting through some clothes and trying not to listen to his mother cry in her own bedroom. When he opened his window to let in a brown, very tiny owl, he had no idea who would write to him, especially in a time like this, so soon after the trials.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Draco, </em>
</p><p><em> I hope this letter finds you and your mother well. I would like to begin by thanking you for your letter. I testified because it was the right thing to do - and right now you’re probably rolling your eyes and calling me </em> Saint <em>Potter, but that’s alright. I did what I felt was right and I would do it again. I owe you and your mother, you both saved my life, as well as my friends’, and I cannot express to you how much that meant to me. </em></p><p>
  <em> I would like to say I am sorry about your father, but you must understand why I did not testify for him; I couldn’t. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> I still have your wand, and I’d like to give it back to you. Maybe we could see each other some time. Maybe talk. I hope to hear from you soon. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Harry Potter </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Draco put the letter down on his bed. <em> Shit. </em> He had sent a letter a week ago, thanking Harry and telling him that he was indebted to him, as well as his mother. He has never expected to receive a <em> freaking letter </em> from Harry Potter telling him he was sorry for not being able to help his father. Draco knew there was no way anyone could help his father. And he hinted at something, that they should meet and <em> talk</em>.</p><p>Draco sighed, put the letter on his bedside table and decided it was best to leave it be.</p><p> </p><p>*</p><p> </p><p>That night, after having tried to coax his mother into eating her dinner and maybe take a bath and walk outside for a bit (she ate, but didn’t bathe nor did she leave her bedroom) Draco reread the letter. And started one of his own. He stopped and paused when he wrote 'Harry'. Was he allowed to call him <em>Harry?</em> He <em> had </em> called him Draco.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Harry, </em>
</p><p>
  <em> I am not sure how to even begin this letter. I am so grateful for what you have done for me and my mother, as I told you before. And I would like to apologise, for what it is worth, for everything that happened since we were eleven. I cannot pretend that the majority of fights and abuse did not come from me. They did. And I am sorry. I wish I could take it all back. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Maybe we could see each other. I think I would like that. But mother needs me, right now. I do not think I could leave her any time soon. Maybe you could keep my wand safe for a little bit longer? </em>
</p><p>
  <em> My mom sends her regards. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Draco </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Draco sent their family owl with the letter and went to bed. It was a long time before he could fall asleep.</p><p> </p><p>*</p><p>
  <em> Draco, </em>
</p><p><em> I thought about what you said, about everything that happened since we were eleven, and I am sorry, too. I was quick to judge you, and I was quick in thinking everything that happened was your fault - I cannot pretend that I didn’t, at one point. We were part of the same thing, even though we fought on opposite sides, but I believe we were both used as a weapon, as something disposable, something that had to be used to achieve greater things. And I absolutely </em> hate <em> it. I hate they made us do this, turned us into weapons, they gave us no chance to grow on our own and find ourselves.</em></p><p>
  <em> Maybe you’re reading this and thinking how much of an idiot I am, and maybe you are right. Hermione says I can’t blame Dumbledore, that it had to be done. But I think that is bullshite. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> I am sorry about your mother, though. But I am sure she will soon recover; she is a strong woman. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> I will keep your wand. If you ever want to meet me, just tell me. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Harry. </em>
</p><p>*</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Harry, </em>
</p><p>
  <em> At one point I did believe that I was fighting for the right side, that it was the right thing to do. And now you are probably calling me an idiot - which I was. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> But now, I am lost. Living in this house that doesn’t feel like home anymore. It holds too many bad memories and too many ghosts. I wish I could talk mother into leaving. Mother keeps to herself, nowadays, it’s been hard trying to talk to her. She sleeps all day, barely eats, keeps going on about my father and how we tainted the Malfoy name, how things shouldn’t have ended the way they did. I am not positive she even knows what she is saying. I want to get help for her, but who would come to the Manor, after everything? And I don’t think she would welcome anyone’s help. Her pride keeps getting in the way.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>And I miss my wand. I have been using mother’s but it does not feel the same, the magic is different, it doesn’t respond to me and my magic the way mine does. It feels like I’m trying to tame something wild and I use it as little as possible. So, if it’s alright with you, I would like to have mine back. Name the place and time and I will be there.</em>
</p><p>
  <em> Hope you are well, </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Draco. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> * </em>
</p><p>One week later, Draco found himself in Muggle London. After lunch, Draco left the Malfoy Manor in pursuit of a little coffee shop Harry told him they should meet. He had dressed in the most Muggle way possible: dark jeans, sneakers, a t-shirt and a thin cardigan. The weather was surprisingly pleasant for mid-July and Draco was thinking about Hyde Park and how wonderful it would be to go there for a walk. Maybe he could persuade Potter in going there, instead.</p><p>When he got to the coffee shop and sat down, ordering tea, he realised he was feeling rather jittery: his palms were cold and sweating; he was tapping his foot up and down; and he could hear his blood rushing through his head. He had a right to be nervous. He knew Potter meant him no harm, but he was nervous about which topics to discuss. That is, if he wanted to stay and chat. He might just sit down, hand Draco his wand and leave. That would be worst, Draco thought. He was hoping to apologise in person, maybe strike a civil conversation, show him he had changed, that he was sorry and ready to make amends. But Potter might not listen to him, and he had every right not to.</p><p>Though, if that was what he wanted, he wouldn’t seem so adamant in meeting him, mentioning it in almost every letter. He was trying to take deep breaths when Potter walked in.</p><p>Draco got up and rubbed the palms of his hands on his jeans. “Hello,” he said.</p><p>Potter was wearing dark charcoal jeans, similar to Draco’s, navy sneakers and a dark green shirt, with the top buttons popped open. His hair was still long, he had yet to cut it. It curled around the base of his neck and was shiny and wild. It framed his dark face, seeming to be in harmony with his round glasses. Draco decided he liked it like that.</p><p>“Hello.” Potter sat down and Draco did, as well. “I have got your wand here." He took out a dark case from his shoulder bag and rested it on the table, “Ollivander said it was perfectly safe and you should use it freely; no harm would come to you.”</p><p>Draco’s heart was still beating hard in his chest when he touched the case and slowly opened it. A sigh escaped his lips and he touched his fingers to the wood. “Thank you,” he said. Potter nodded. “You went to see Ollivander?”</p><p>Potter nodded again, but before he could answer, the waiter came to take his order (caramel macchiato and two large chocolate chip cookies). He resumed, “I went to see how he was doing and took your wand with me. It worked fine when I was using it but,” he shrugged and looked down, ”after I killed him, I wanted to be sure it was safe.” Draco couldn’t find the words to reply, so he sipped his tea.</p><p>When the waiter came with his order, Potter poured some sugar into his tea and stirred. “That’s for you,” he indicated the cookie. He took half of his and shoved it into his mouth.</p><p>“Still no manners, Potter,” Draco said, hiding a grin, but took a small bite out of his. When he looked up, Potter was smiling at him.</p><p>“What?” he asked.</p><p>“Nothing,” he said. “How’s your mum?”</p><p>Draco’s mouth dropped. “She’s...I don’t know. She’s still my mother but at the same time, she seems so far away that I can’t reach her.”</p><p>Harry nodded. “She must still be processing everything, I’m sure.”</p><p>“I am, too and look at me: I am eating a chocolate chip cookie with my former enemy in <em> Muggle </em> London! I’m processing!” Harry laughed. <em> Laughed</em>. It echoed in the small shop and he could see his eyes shining, his head thrown back.</p><p>“Malfoy, that was actually funny. Former enemy, then?”</p><p>Draco grinned and touched his neck. “Enemy might be too strong a word.”</p><p>“What were we, then?”</p><p>He shrugged. “I don’t know, but do you think we were enemies? You hated me that much that that’s how you described our relationship?”</p><p>“Relationship?”</p><p>Draco blushed. “You know what I mean, you git!”</p><p>Harry laughed. “Yes, I know. I don’t think you were my enemy. And I didn’t <em> hate </em> you, exactly. You’d just get on my nerves a lot and I might have <em> disliked </em> you a little bit in sixth year.”  </p><p>“Disliked? Potter, I nearly killed your friend, you had every right to hate me back then,” he said honestly.</p><p>“Alright,” Harry said, looking at him. “I really did hate you in sixth year. But not anymore.”</p><p>“Yeah, me neither. I’ve never hated you. I was really jealous of you and angry you didn’t accept my friendship. And I was so prejudiced that for a long time I was mad you were friends with Granger and Weasley but chose not to befriend me.”</p><p>“Oh. Really?”</p><p>Draco nodded. “We all grew up with stories of you, you know? My father was a Death Eater but he’d still tell me all about it. I was sure we were going to be friends.”</p><p>“Then you offended my first friend <em> ever </em> and I decided I didn’t want to be your friend.”</p><p>Draco was confused, for a second. “You mean Weasley?”</p><p>He shook his head. “No, Hagrid.”</p><p>“Hagrid?”</p><p>“When we met, when we were trying on our robes, remember? You were talking about the Hogwarts houses and Quidditch and I remember being terrified because I didn’t know what any of those things were or what they meant. I had found out I was a wizard and that my mum and dad didn’t die in a car crash but were murdered <em> hours ago</em>. And suddenly this pompous git started badmouthing the only person that had ever shown any empathy towards me. Of course I was mad at you. And then you were mean to Ron, so.”</p><p><em> What?! </em> “Potter, <em> what the fuck?!” </em></p><p>He looked up innocently. “What?”</p><p>“Wha- I don’t even know where to begin. <em> What the fuck. </em>No one told you about your parents <em> before </em> you came into Hogwarts?!"</p><p>Harry shook his head.</p><p>“And that you were a wizard?”</p><p>He repeated the motion.</p><p>“And Hagrid was your <em> first friend?</em>”</p><p>Harry nodded.</p><p>“Potter, <em> what the fuck?!” </em></p><p>“It’s Harry,” and when Draco stared at him with wide eyes and raised eyebrows, he shrugged.</p>
