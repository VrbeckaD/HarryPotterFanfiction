    <p>Eris walks almost silently up to the hat stool and focuses on the parts of her that fit neatly at home. There aren’t too many but she’s enough of her parents that the hat doesn’t look that hard.</p><p>The Slytherin table claps hard but not too hard – everyone already knew she would be coming here.</p><p>She dozes through the rest of the sorting the same way she dozes through family dinners.</p><p>While eating, while meeting her cousins’ friends, she thinks of the universe where she didn’t hide her jagged edges. Somewhere she allowed herself to be dangerous to everyone and not just the people who aren’t like her.</p><p>In that universe she’s sorted into Gryffindor for her anger. Ravenclaw for her quick mind. Hufflepuff for her loyalty; for the only part of herself that she knows for certain is good.</p><p>She imagines her brother getting sorted into Slytherin a year later. And he is still all their family’s futures pinned on one child. And she cannot help him because she is free.</p><p>In those other universes Eris is happy and free and hated out right instead of in the shadows and Regulus is their parent’s child and already withering as he sits on the stool.</p><p>In this universe Eris Walburga Black watches the Gryffindor girls in potions class. Behind her one of them is working with a Slytherin boy. She does the work automatically while she tries to work out which one of them is braver for that friendship.</p><p>Snape sees her look once and hisses that Evans is worth a thousand of her. Eris thinks that if she repeated this moment to Narcissa then he’d have his tongue cursed out. She stays silent.</p><p>When she goes home for Christmas Regulus says he thought she was going to be a Gryffindor. She says she changed her mind and he pretends to believe her.</p><p>She gets good marks that year but not brilliant. It’s all anyone expected.</p><p>When Regulus is sorted – just a shade quicker than her own – she stops her daydreams and focusses on the school. It’s duller than she had imagined.</p><p>Regulus gets better marks than she did and will continue to for the next seven years. This is both expected and easy to make certain.</p><p>She doesn’t watch the Gryffindor girls as often this year but when she does she thinks Evans looks tired and Snape looks angry.</p><p>/</p><p>When Eris is fifteen she talks to Lily Evans for the first time. The other girl is crying. Eris knows why – the whole school knows why – so she stops and goes into the abandoned classroom.</p><p>She shuts the door quietly and breathes in the dust happily before squatting next to Evans and gripping her hand.</p><p>She remembers her childishness at eleven; the dreams of bravery she’d had. <em>Here</em>, she thinks, t<em>his is as brave as you are allowed to be.</em></p><p>Evans cries all over their clasped hands and doesn’t flinch away when she looks up and sees Eris. She does try to pull her hand away.</p><p>“Did S-Sev s-send you?” She says, and later Eris will realise that she intended her tone to be harsh.</p><p>Eris exaggerates her natural haughtiness for effect and shakes her head. “Nobody,” she says quietly, “Sends me anywhere.”</p><p>Evans’ mouth twitches up. “I sup-pose not. W-why are you here then?” Her tears have silenced but not stopped. Eris wants to kiss them off.</p><p>Instead she raises her other hand and strokes Evans’ hair like she does when Regulus has nightmares.</p><p>“No one should have to cry alone.” She doesn’t say that she’s watched her bravery for five years and she knows the friends she’s spurned to keep one boy. She will one day. One day she will tell this girl everything she sees when she’s dreaming.</p><p>“Do you ever –?” Evans doesn’t finish the sentence.</p><p>“No.” Eris says, still faux-haughty. “I have a brother.” She adds quietly.</p><p>“M-my sister hates me. Sev’s been my best friend since before Hogwarts. H-he’s the one who t-told me I was a witch.” Evans whispers.</p><p>Eris considers this; she knows a lot of things about Evans but she had never heard of a sister. “Is she younger than you?”</p><p>“Two years older.” Evans shakes her head and uses Eris’ silence to wipe away her tears.</p><p>“She doesn’t hate you.” Eris says with the certainty of someone who only knows broken families. “She’s scared she can’t protect you and that you’ve outgrown her protection.”</p><p>Evans looks up at her and Eris settles down on the floor to grip her closer and stroke her hair again.</p><p>“My eldest cousin still loves Andromeda even though she’s been disowned for her marriage. Andromeda isn’t even considered family anymore. I could never hate my brother for anything.”</p><p>Except dying, she doesn’t say.</p><p>Evans hugs her suddenly and fiercely. It’s the closest Eris can remember being to anyone not Regulus.</p><p>/</p><p>For five years Lily has been teaching herself not to notice house colours while walking so when she receives her first letter from Petunia in five years she doesn’t think not to thank Eris Black.</p><p>She catches her in potions; she’s always been sitting with Severus before and there have been two empty seats next to the Black girl for every class since first year.</p><p>She sits down in one of them and waits for Eris’ reaction. It isn’t what she’s expecting.</p><p>Two fast blinks and a quick smirk. “I’ll handle the knives if you don’t mind.”</p><p>Lily smiles wide enough that her cheeks hurt.</p><p>She learns small things about Eris that lesson. She learns that she is incredibly precise with a blade, that she ties her hair up with magic and no ribbons, and that she knows the name of every poison ever invented.</p><p>She wonders what Eris learns about her.</p><p>After class, when they’re packing up, she clasps the other girl’s wrist and says into the hustle, “Will you teach me how to hold my hair back like yours?”</p><p>Eris nods and slips their hands together as they walk up to the grounds.</p><p>/</p><p>Eris dreams of Lily.</p><p>She dreams of kissing her, of sliding into her, of lapping at her clit, of falling asleep curled into her. She dreams of hand-holding and shy glances and full-face blushing.</p><p>She knows it’s a problem only when Regulus corners her after lunch.</p><p>“You can be like Andromeda if you want.” He says carefully. Eris feels tears pricking her eyes.</p><p>“I won’t leave you.” It’s the only thing she’s ever been sure of.</p><p>“I know that.” Regulus shrugs gracefully, “I’ll never leave you either. But…” He pauses and lowers his voice like this is a secret, “You can still live.”</p><p>She swallows. Maybe it is a secret.</p><p>Regulus continues, “Burning Andromeda off the tapestry didn’t change her blood. Loving mudbloods doesn’t mean you can’t still love us.”</p><p>Eris considers; all their lives they have lived as expected but what if…</p><p>What if…</p><p>“What do you want to do?” She asks – whispers.</p><p>“Travel.” He says. Run away, he means.</p><p>Eris purses her lips and considers everything said and unsaid. “How do I –?” She swallows herself into silence.</p><p>“Tell her a secret.” Regulus says sternly, and then, reconsidering, “Tell her two. The biggest you’ve got.”</p><p>Eris flushes and thinks of everything she’s ever dreamed.</p><p>“Here’s mine.” Regulus says, at the top of a flight of stairs, “I wouldn’t change anything. Not a line.” He hugs her and lets her hide her face in cowardice.</p><p>“Go and find her.”</p><p>/</p><p>Lily has no one to talk to about Eris. Sev is gone and her relationship with Petunia is too raw; the only other time she speaks to people her own age who aren’t Eris is when James Potter asks her out.</p><p>She has this fantasy where the two of them are running around the lake – they do that sometimes; Lily likes running and Eris likes the fighting the fierce winds – they’re running and Eris trips and falls into the lake. And her shirt sticks to her torso and she’s shivering something fierce, so Lily has to pull her top off and cast a drying charm but it’s still cold so she runs her hands up and down and up and down Eris’ body to keep her warm. And Eris pulls her close like that first time they spoke but she pulls too hard and Lily falls into her – either into her breasts or her mouth, the story varies – and they’re lying on the cool grass together and Eris vanishes Lily’s shirt – says fair’s fair – and they tangle into each other and –</p><p>And Lily listens to the girls in her dorm at night discussing their crushes and wonders where she went wrong, or where they went wrong, or why she’s never even considered saying yes to James Potter.</p><p>/</p><p>Eris sits outside the Gryffindor common room and waits for something. She doesn’t know what.</p><p>Apparently she’s waiting for James Potter.</p><p>He’s the first person to come by while she’s there; he stops, glares and walks away backwards.</p><p>A few minutes later he comes back and repeats this. The third time he strides up to her and freezes.</p><p>She smiles. “Have you seen Lily?” She says softly; pretending, for his sake, that she isn’t dangerous. “Will you see if she’s inside? I can stand over there so I don’t hear the password if you like.” She tries to look innocent, or harmless, or like she isn’t wearing green.</p><p>“What do you want with her?” Hands on hips; now he’s got a purpose, someone to protect, something to stand for.</p><p>“I need to tell her a secret.” She considers telling him he can watch them if he wants, if Lily doesn’t mind, if he needs to make sure she’s safe.</p><p>Potter runs his hands through his hair and worries his lip. Eris thinks he is about to walk away again or try to curse her. He doesn’t.</p><p>“Are-you-in-trouble?” He asks in a rush, nervously looking from side to side.</p><p>Her heart catches. “Only the good kind. It’s very nice of you to ask.” A year ago she wouldn’t have said that; she has been letting Lily teach her kindness.</p><p>Potter doesn’t seem to know what to do. His hand hovers in front of her like he wants to make sure she’s really there.</p><p>The password to Gryffindor tower is <em>Respice Finem. </em>Eris smiles to hear it and holds it in her mouth and promises silently not to use it.</p><p>Potter takes almost eight minutes – counting time is the easiest way to waste it – to reappear and he has found Lily.</p><p>Eris jumps to her feet eagerly and stumbles. Lily’s hands catch her by the elbows and she thinks she could stay like this forever.</p><p>Potter clears his throat behind them. “There’s a secret passage not too far away if you don’t want to be disturbed.”</p><p>Lily looks surprised at his offer. Eris finds her obvious emotions charming – she finds it hard to think of anything except Lily’s eyes and her hands on her arms but she nods to Potter and steps away.</p><p>“Thank you.” Her arms feel cold now but for the first time it is Lily reaching to grab <em>her</em> hand.</p><p>/</p><p>James leads the two girls away from the common room. He isn’t confused anymore; Black’s motives had been clear from the moment she set eyes on Evans and Evans’ feelings were just as clear.</p><p>James fancies Evans but he doesn’t know her well enough for the feelings to be strong. Black looks radiant with happiness just by being close. Their joined hands swing between them lightly – James envies them their easiness with each other and their overflowing joy at the other’s presence.</p><p>He thinks he could love like that given the chance. He wants the chance.</p><p>Once they are inside the passage way he begins to walk away but walks back to stand guard, just in case someone comes by to interrupt.</p><p>/</p><p>“Regulus says that I should tell you my secrets.” Eris says quietly, unable for now, to be clear.</p><p>“Ok.” Lily says. And she doesn’t ask for more information or offer to trade her own; Eris loves her all the more for it.</p><p>“I used to wish I was a squib.” She has to do the easier one first – the one Lily won’t understand unless she asks, “And, I’m in love with you.”</p><p>She looks at the floor, at the walls, at the flickering flames, at anything other than Lily.</p><p>And then she feels a soft pressure on her knee.</p><p>“I think I’m in love with you too.” Lily licks her lips and Eris lets herself follow the movement. “I don’t understand the other one though?”</p><p>“I can explain some other time.” Eris says, leaning forward.</p><p>/</p><p>There are only a few weeks left until the summer and Eris and Lily take advantage of as much of it as they can. The only people who know are Regulus and James, both of whom are more than happy to guard the secret spaces they hide in.</p><p>The last day of school the two boys spend long dusty hours in an empty classroom transfiguring and cleaning until a shining bedroom is in front of them.</p><p>They blindfold the girls before letting them in. Seconds after their eyes were open though they were both shoved out the door as it clicked behind them.</p><p>“Well that’s gratitude for you.” Regulus says cheerfully, cheeks flushed red, and a sticky lip gloss print on the side of his mouth.</p><p>James laughs.</p><p>“Hey Regulus,” he says when he’s stopped laughing, “Will you two – I mean will Eris be ok this summer? Will your parents mind all this?”</p><p>Regulus’ grin falls from his face quicker than a snitches flight. “They don’t know. She won’t tell them.”</p><p>“But…”</p><p>“It’s only two more years before she’s of age.” He looks away.</p><p>“Three for you.” James says quietly, almost unwillingly.</p><p>“She doesn’t have to wait for me.” Regulus sinks against the wall. That Eris would wait forever for her brother goes unsaid.</p><p>“You’re welcome at my house, if – if you ever need a place to go.” He says; trying to pack everything they both need into those thirteen words. Regulus smiles at him.</p><p>/</p><p>It’s fourteen days into the summer holidays when Eris recognises what she’s been hiding from – that she loves her family, loves her mother and her father, loves her cousins and her aunt and uncle, that no matter how much she loves them she already loves Lily more.</p><p>She is in the drawing room with Bellatrix and Narcissa. Regulus is with father and Andromeda’s name is still heavy in the air after four years of absence.</p><p>Bellatrix is telling them about the group she’s joined, about the man who leads them – more than a man, she says. About how he’s going to fix the world and how she’ll be right by his side when he does.</p><p>And Eris doesn’t understand until she does and the knowledge of it hangs heavy in her heart.</p><p>/</p><p>Mother starts it at dinner, bringing up Eris’ future; asking if there are any suitors in her life at the moment. It’s an illusion of kindness, of freedom, the pretence that any part of her life is undecided.</p><p>Regulus watches her sister – she’s become easier to read recently but he’s hoping desperately that that is only because he has been by her side for it.</p><p>“Actually, mother,” Regulus’ heart sinks like a stone as his sister starts to speak. “I was thinking I’d rather fight than marry.”</p><p>Regulus watches her carefully; unsure of where she’s heading with this.</p><p>“Bella’s been telling Cissa and I about this group,” her grip on the silverware shakes, “And I was thinking that some people are bound to fight against the world as it’s meant to be and I’d rather not start a family until things were better.” Her eyes flash.</p><p>Regulus wonders if maybe he’s underestimated her ability to twist the truth.</p><p>Mother looks like she’s going to protest until father raises his head and shows an interest in his daughter for the first time Regulus can remember. The conversation falls into a familiar patter about purity.</p><p>Afterwards father calls Eris to his study for a ‘chat’. Regulus watches her hands shake as she leaves and goes upstairs to pack both their trunks.</p><p>/</p><p>Lily has always spent the summer holidays missing Hogwarts but she has usually had Severus by her side to cover the ache.</p><p>This year the ache is larger than ever – now she has more to miss. But this year Petunia is talking to her again and it’s almost home again.</p><p>She imagines bringing Eris home to her parents; doesn’t think about their reactions just the way Eris would fit at their table.</p><p>She rearranges her bedroom so it could fit a second body and replaces all the photos of her and Severus with ones of Eris and a few of James and Regulus.</p><p>When her parents see the changes they say they’re glad she’s finally made some girl friends and the gap between the words haunts her.</p><p>/</p><p>James wakes early August 1<sup>st</sup> to the owl pecking at the glass. His first thought is that it’s good news; it’s Regulus’ fifteenth birthday in two weeks and the Black siblings had promised to try and convince their parents to allow a meeting.</p><p>But as he focusses he realises that won’t be the case – no one would receive or send news that wasn’t urgent at five am. Something was wrong.</p><p>The owl is a sleek tawny – not one he recognises – and two letters are clutched in its talons. As soon as James takes the one addressed to him it flies off.</p><p>
  <em>Dear James,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I’m uncertain as to whether this correspondence will be needed but I fear that tonight we may be breaking ties with our family. There is talk of something dangerous on the horizon; there were even mentions of war!</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I fear Eris is willing to risk manipulating the board in her – our favour. Despite her brilliance I cannot imagine it working.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I ask not for you to expect our arrival but to prepare for it. I have also written a similar letter to Lily and I must most rudely request that you allow her entry into your home – for Eris’ sake, James.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Humbly yours,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>R.A.B</em>
</p><p>James has to read through the letter several times before it sinks in – not because of the content; he had been half expecting something like this – but just at the uncommonly proper and almost shy way Regulus wrote. The letter unnerves him and charms him at the same time.</p><p>He creeps downstairs to the entrance hall and worries his lip. He doesn’t want to wake his parents this early but he also isn’t sure if he will be of any use on his own. If only Regulus had given him more information.</p><p>/</p><p>“Father.” Eris gives a poor and unpractised curtsey. It has been a long time since she last spoke to her father alone.</p><p>“Sit.” He waits as she follows the order; eyes tracking her coldly, “Tell me truthfully daughter, did you mean what you said at dinner?”</p><p>“Every word.” Her voice doesn’t waver or stumble even if inside she knows that this situation is a powder keg, every second of safety hinging on her ability to avoid the traps.</p><p>“And where do you stand?”</p><p>Eris swallows but keeps breathing steadily. She had been aware of the possibility that her father would see through her half-truths but had been hoping the years of being ignored would mean he could not read her.</p><p>But there was still one truth she knew he would respect.</p><p>“I stand with Regulus. If I want a better world for anyone it is him.”</p><p>She looks straight into his eyes – he’s far better at occlumency than she but she’s survived five years in Slytherin with no friends and the knowledge that she’d whore herself out to a mudblood if that was all she could get.</p><p>Orion’s more powerful than her but she’s stronger than he’s ever had to be.</p><p>“And is there anything that could be done to change your mind?” He says it mildly, as though he hasn’t just rifled through it like it were a copy of the prophet.</p><p>Still, she bristles; she may have different priorities to her family but she is still one of them.</p><p>Her father may not have raised her but she is still his daughter.</p><p>“I am not weak sir. I am a Black; I will not break like china, no matter my gender.”</p><p>“I dare say not. You have twenty-four hours to change your mind.” He stands up – gestures to the door.</p><p>Eris can take a hint but she won’t here. “What life will I lead father, if I change my mind?”</p><p>Orion stares down at her; here and now they both know there will not be twenty-four hours to wait.</p><p>“You will marry well.” He says; quiet enough that it could almost be mistaken for sympathy. “You will bring honour to your family. You will bear children for a good name.”</p><p>Eris nods, curtseys again, and leaves through the open door.</p><p>/</p><p>James wakes with a start; the chair he was resting in toppling over with a bang. The sun’s risen and he can hear his mum pottering about in the kitchen behind him. The night’s over and nothing’s happened. His friends are ok.</p><p>They arrive at a quarter past six in the afternoon. The chair he had been sleeping in is still by the front door but his glances at it are becoming less frequent and the rigidness in his shoulders is almost gone.</p><p>There’s one sharp rap on the door and then silence.</p><p>His mum reaches the door before he can; he tries to remember if he’d told her about them.</p><p>Regulus is carrying most of the weight between them. Eris is slumped against him; she has a large bruise down one side of her face, and her eyes are unfocussed.</p><p>“Hi.” James says, forcing himself to keep the worry out of his voice. Regulus nods back at him and doesn’t speak.</p><p>Eris tries to focus on them and slumps into a mocking bow.</p><p>“She’s been drifting in and out of consciousness since we left.” Regulus says, gratefully accepting James’ outstretched arms and passing his sister along.</p><p>She’s lighter than James had expected. He tries to remember if he’d ever seen her eat.</p><p>“Mum this is Regulus.” He says, trying for good cheer and failing, as he carries Eris away to his bedroom.</p><p>“It’s nice to meet you ma’am.” Regulus says quietly.</p><p>/</p><p>James leaves him and Mrs Potter alone for almost twenty minutes before coming back downstairs. The twenty minutes have been silent.</p><p>“She’s asleep.” James announces his presence. Regulus relaxes slightly. “What happened?”</p><p>Regulus shrugs; it feels, like usual, foreign in his body. “We left. How long can we stay here?”</p><p>“As long as you like.” James says fiercely, not even bothering to look to his mother for confirmation. Regulus’ small amount of relaxation vanishes.</p><p>“We don’t want to be any trouble.”</p><p>“You aren’t dear.” Mrs Potter speaks for the first time. Regulus’ gaze snaps to her, wary.</p><p>“You and your sister are very welcome here. I’m sorry for my rudeness; I was just surprised to see you.” She glares sharply at James, who withers.</p><p>“I didn’t want to worry you?” He says hopefully. Regulus laughs.</p><p>“A little warning wouldn’t have troubled me Jamie. You know we’ll always welcome your friends.”</p><p>“Yeah mum I know. It’s just…I guess I didn’t want to jinx anything.” He runs his hand through his hair. Regulus rolls his eyes but can’t deny his fascination at this easy relationship.</p><p>“So what happened to the poor girl? Who hurt her like that?” Regulus notes tiredly that her gaze is far more penetrating now that it’s fixed on him.</p><p>“Was it your parents?” James says quickly, hand still clutching his hair.</p><p>Regulus shakes his head. “No. Father didn’t fight it and I didn’t see Mother’s reaction. Bellatrix kept hexing her when she realised what was happening.”</p><p>When she realised her favourite cousin was about to become her foe.</p><p>“I didn’t recognise what she was hit with but there don’t seem to be any lingering affects expect fatigue.” He finishes.</p><p>“And the bruise?” James checks.</p><p>“We took the Knight Bus to get here.” Regulus shrugs tiredly, “She was already barely conscious.”</p><p>James looks like he wants to ask more but keeps silent. “I set her down in the spare room; there’s only one bed but you can stay in my room if you want.”</p><p>Regulus nods and pulls out two shrunken trunks from his pockets. “Thanks.”</p><p>/</p><p>It takes Lily a few days to convince her parents that she’ll be alright going to James’ alone. She doesn’t want to torture them with the Knight Bus and she isn’t ready for them to meet Eris – or vice versa.</p><p>The ride was awful but short. James’ home is large but not ostentatious, even if the driveway was a little too long to be called practical – and why would a wizarding household need a driveway anyway?</p><p>By the time she reaches the front door she’s almost talked herself out of needing to be here. She received one letter from Regulus inviting her to be prepared and giving out James’ address. She didn’t even know if James was aware she might turn up.</p><p>Still, Gryffindor, right? She reaches up and knocks hard.</p><p>A few minutes pass before anyone comes to it during which time Lily has worried herself into near insanity but eventually James turns up. His hair’s even more of a mess than usual and there are heavy bags under his eyes but he looks ecstatic to see her.</p><p>“Lily!” He steps aside and beckons her in. Despite her nagging worry Lily can’t help but grin back at him. “It’s good to see you; we’ve been – I mean it would be good to see you anyway but – anyway it’s –”</p><p>“Hi James,” she gives him a one-armed hug and moves past him, “It’s good to see you too. Perhaps we could skip the pleasantries and you could bring me to Eris? I’m too scared to be polite.”</p><p>“Yeah, alright but you owe me for this. My parents are going to lecture me on manners <em>so</em> much.”</p><p>Lily laughs and allows him to take her arm and pull her away.</p><p>/</p><p>No matter how many protests she issues Eris is still in bedrest for the foreseeable future. Euphemia Potter had insisted she stay well-rested until they could get a healer round for a house call to diagnose the hexes her cousin had used.</p><p>The Potters were fantastic. But Eris had never been a lazy-day girl and she’d never been allowed to rest when hurt; in truth the diversion from the norm was starting to grate on her nerves and give her paranoia of their actions.</p><p>James didn’t understand any of this when she tried voicing it; he’d been pampered all his life with especial emphasis on holidays and illnesses. He’d told her about his bout with dragon pox when he was six while trying to get her comfortable to prove that no expanse would be spared. Eris didn’t want to mention that it would, of course, be different with their son.</p><p>Even Regulus didn’t really understand her twitchiness. He’d hardly been spoilt by their parents but he was the heir and as such he’d been allowed some luxury.</p><p>At any rate she’s now insanely bored; the last time she’d been injured with any severity she’d locked herself in her room and researched healing spells. Since then she had never needed to seek help from pain.</p><p>She’d read all the spare quidditch magazines James had lent her, done as much spell damage analysis on herself as she knew how and experimented hard with wandless magic. There was nothing left to do; not with her still weak on her feet and constantly drowsy.</p><p>Thus, despite how tired she was of everyone fussing over her, it was a relief to see the door handle turn down.</p><p>When she sees that it’s Lily at the door her mild relief turns to ridiculous, overwhelming joy. She’s as gone over this girl as James is over quidditch and that’s one of the great loves of the century.</p><p>Lily appears to feel an at least similar feeling as she immediately abandons all decorum and throws herself onto the bed, barely missing hitting any of Eris.</p><p>Neither of them speak. Eris is unwilling to break the peace – as of yet Lily has not fussed or doted and she would like to keep that status quo for as long as it will hold. Luckily her bruise has cleared up and Lily, even after five years, still sometimes forgets that magic rarely leaves marks.</p><p>All good things must come to an end though and eventually Lily rolls off her and starts talking.</p><p>“So what’s going on? Regulus sent me a letter that basically said to come here but nothing else. And why are you in bed already, it’s not that late?”</p><p>“‘Already’ implies that I’ve left it.”</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>“I got in a fight with my family. We’ve left for good now – Reg and I.”</p><p>Lily’s face goes ice white, “What did you fight about?” There’s a hint of stutter in her voice.</p><p>“The war. You, I suppose, except I didn’t mention you once; I wouldn’t put you in their line of fire like that. But I’d never be brave enough to go against them without you. You don’t need to worry though; this has been coming for a while.”</p><p>Lily still looks pale. Eris wonders what she knows of families like hers.</p><p>“I think my father may have given me his blessing.” She says with a smile; she’s yet to share that conversation with anyone, “It’s the first we’ve spoken in years so I don’t suppose he was too disappointed. Reg on the other hand…”</p><p>“Because he’s the heir?”</p><p>“Mm. But he’d left before they realised we were going together. No one got a chance to harm him.”</p><p>“So why are you in bedrest?”</p><p>“I got hit with some stuff. But cousin Bella’s good with non-verbal so we don’t know what yet. I’m under strict instruction to stay put – which means that you’ve almost certainly been having a more exciting holiday than me. Entertain me.”</p><p>Lily smothers a laugh in the duvet but refuses to cooperate. “But are you alright? Oh! Am I hurting you?”</p><p>“No. I like having you here. Come on – tell me something you’ve done.” She pleads, affecting a puppyish look.</p><p>/</p><p>Another two weeks of summer pass before the healer finally arrives and clears up the mystery. Eris had been hit by a mix of curses all cast in great anger <em>and</em> great sadness. The effect the caster had desired had failed because a part of them wanted it to. The residue was painful but not long-lasting and while she’d be weak for a while the recovery would not take too long; perhaps a week or so into the new school year.</p><p>She was now allowed to roam the Potter’s house with the others but never alone. Fortunately Eris had no desire to be alone and while she wouldn’t seek out company she also wouldn’t avoid it.</p><p>Lily has to return home after that but they promise to meet up to get school supplies.</p><p>Not too long after she’s gone James’ friends Remus and Peter arrive as usual for a stay. That’s…more awkward than James had predicted.</p><p>The Black siblings sit in Eris’ room while James tries to explain things to his friends. As soon as the conversation began to get fiery Eris had grabbed her brother’s arm and said she felt weak. James was the only one to believe her but it got them out of the explanation none the less.</p><p>“James always gives odd this air of being completely in charge of any situation.” Eris muses gloomily; both of them are a little afraid he’ll turn them out for his friends, “I think it rubbed off on me.”</p><p>“That’s just because you haven’t seen Mrs Potter chew him out for anything yet. You missed all the lectures on manners.”</p><p>“Do you think we’ll be alright, then?”</p><p>Regulus stands up and paces, mostly for the excuse not to look at his sister.</p><p>“Regulus.” Eris says sternly.</p><p>“No.” He says finally, “Not really. I don’t think the Potter’s are going to make us leave but I don’t know what we’re going to do when we’re back at school.”</p><p>“Always the optimist.” Eris jokes weakly, “I’m friends with some of the house-elves at Hogwarts and I’m going to see if they can find an empty room I can live out of.”</p><p>Regulus says nothing but relaxes a fraction, “Good. I’m going to lie my way out of it.”</p><p>Eris jerks upward in rage and worry, “You’re going back? You can’t!”</p><p>“I don’t think I’ve got a choice. Either I go back willingly or they drag me back – I’m the only heir they’ve got. Their best chance for immortality.”</p><p>“They’ll kill you.” She whispers redundantly; coming over and hugging him from behind. “I’m so sorry; I should have found a better plan than running.”</p><p>“Your choices were running or getting trapped. I don’t blame you for this; no one would.” He leans back into her; feeling, for once, comforted instead of embarrassed for their height difference.</p><p>“I could have joined him.” It’s a barely heard whisper into his hair – the only reason he <em>does</em> hear it is because he expects it.</p><p>“No you couldn’t.”</p><p>“You don’t think I’d be able to do it?” She sounds honestly curious and he hates the answer he has to give her.</p><p>“No, I think you could. I think you could fake darkness well enough that everyone would be fooled. I think eventually you’d fool yourself as well. I think you could kill and torture as long as you thought the payoff was worth it.” He takes a deep breath and readies himself, “I think you already have.”</p><p>Eris is silent.</p><p>“Have you, Eris? Am I right?”</p><p>The silence stretches on and on. Regulus doesn’t move to retract the question even if in the end it will change nothing; their paths have already been marked out.</p><p>“I never tortured anyone.” Eris sinks down onto the soft floor and muffles her face in her hands. “I’m not Bella; pointless violence does nothing for me but…</p><p>“But?” Regulus prompts.</p><p>“There was a muggle tramp Bella found somewhere a few winters ago. He would have agreed to anything to get out of the cold. I didn’t do anything for the longest time; just watched her try out some old spells she’d found but eventually I just – felt too sick to continue, I suppose. Two words and it was over.” She sobs a little, clearly trying to stifle it, “Bella didn’t even mock me for it. She thought it was brave, impressive. I just wanted it to be over.”</p><p>Regulus loops his arms around his sister’s neck and hugs tight.</p><p>“If you can blend in for this long then so can I.”</p><p>“But you don’t have to. Even if the Potter’s kick us out we’ll manage. We just have to stay together. Please.” It slips from her lips as a quiet breath and almost immediately she tries to lose his grip and hide.</p><p>“It’s not that I don’t want to. It’s just that for the next three years it will be smoother if I stick to the script. And, I mean, what were you planning to do before you found Lily?”</p><p>She raises one shoulder in a graceless shrug, conceding the point. “Survive, I suppose.”</p><p>/</p><p>Regulus does leave in the end; disappearing one night and leaving only empty space behind him. Eris tries but fails to let Lupin and Pettigrew in regardless of James’ pushing and the kindness the other boys attempt to show her.</p><p>She finds it easier to cope with their wariness than with the Potters’ easy acceptance some days. Other days she feels the rush of rebellion she’d tried so hard to lose as an eleven year old.</p><p>Mostly, though, she just feels tired.</p><p>The morning they go to fetch their school supplies, her and the three boys, Mr and Mrs Potter stay at home for a relaxing time and to allow them a chance to exercise their independence.</p><p>James insists they take the floo to Diagon despite Eris arguing in favour of the Knight Bus. She has only used the floo once or twice in the past but refuses to admit this in front of James’ friends. She regrets this after falling flat on her face upon arrival and the subsequent coughing fits that rack her with pain.</p><p>“Are you sure you’re ok?” James checks for the hundredth time while trying to hide his longing for Quality Quidditch Supplies.</p><p>“Go off and play with your dicks and balls James.” Eris shakes her hair out of her face so that James doesn’t miss the roll of her eyes. “I don’t want to waste this day with you.”</p><p>“Rude.” James says in a tone clearly meant to be sharp although the effect is ruined by the bright red of his face.</p><p>“Sorry, did I say dicks? I meant sticks. Broomsticks.” She laughs then, at James’ scandalised face, and kisses his cheek for extra measure. “<em>Go</em> James.”</p><p>He does, finally, still bright red and grumbling under his breath. She watches him leave with the same sort of steady fondness she gets with Reg.</p><p>She isn’t sore about her brother’s choice anymore; she’s angrier than ever with her family though – she’s never been truly angry about how shit her family are before even after meeting the Potters and seeing how people are supposed to be but Regulus has always been her weak spot.</p><p>The sunshine that covers the world around her as soon as she catches sight of Lily makes her think she might have found another one though.</p><p>It shouldn’t feel as good as it does to be getting weaker.</p><p>She’s always known it would happen; regardless of what she had told her father, she wasn’t really a Black, not in the same way as the rest of them.</p><p>/</p><p>Lily doesn’t spot Eris immediately despite the other girl lounging carelessly, and beautifully, in their designated meeting space.</p><p>This is because she’d barely slept at all the previous night; too busy deliberating about this visit. Specifically about what she wanted out of it – her first and most immediate answer was Eris. In any form or conversation or state – except injured.</p><p>But after thinking on it through the night she had realised there was something else she could try for this year; her slowly healing relationship with Petunia. With that in mind she’d asked her sister if she wanted to come along at breakfast and had been pleased but shocked when Petunia accepted.</p><p>Flushed with excitement at finally getting to show off the magical world to her big sister she walked straight past the girl she could tentatively call her lover.</p><p>She would have continued further if it weren’t for Eris’ rather distinctive barking laugh, “Forgotten me already, Evans?”</p><p>Heat fills Lily’s cheeks at the address and she spins around almost fast enough to get whiplash, hoping that the swing of her hair will hide the brilliant blush from both her sister and her girlfriend.</p><p>It doesn’t.</p><p>Lily isn’t sure how much Petunia works out from Eris’ teasing but however much had been given away, Petunia’s attitude didn’t change: she was wary but in awe of magic and held much the same reaction towards Eris. Lily can sympathise.</p><p>Lily can’t stop smiling, even when Petunia flinches away from Dervish and Bangs and the apothecary or when Eris’ pallor becomes paler than should be humanly possible.</p><p>Until she sees Severus in Madam Malkin’s and feels sickly herself. Petunia notices him first, which doesn’t surprise her; Eris only notices things that are wonderful or dangerous.</p><p>She always says that Lily is both and the smile that follows her hideous blushing is Lily’s favourite of all Eris’ smiles.</p><p>Petunia clasps her shoulder, dragging her back to reality: but a reality that she feels safe in, with Petunia by her side protecting her like she always did and Eris slightly in front of her, calculating and deadly.</p><p>And James Potter barrelling in front of them and blocking her ex-friend from view. Eris grabs him in one swift movement and melts the four of them seamlessly into the crowd.</p><p>“Did you get in a fight?” Petunia asks disapprovingly, taking in James’ dishevelled appearance.</p><p>“Don’t worry,” Eris says laughingly, “His hair’s always like that.”</p><p>Lily stifles a laugh at James’ wounded expression and again when he runs his fingers through his hair self-consciously.</p><p>“Relax, Tuney. James is harmless.”</p><p>“Yeah – hey!”</p><p>“And very slow on the uptake.” Eris adds.</p><p>Petunia’s expression thaws a little at their easy banter. “Hm. Ok, but if you turn out to be the slightest bit like Snape, then well, I may not be magical but I can still hurt you.”</p><p>A slow smirk works its way across James’ face that Lily immediately worries signals the unwelcome return of his usual arrogance.</p><p>“Oh, we are going to get along.” James grins, “What’s your least favourite thing about Snivellus?”</p><p>Petunia giggles at the nickname, surprising herself, and allows James to take her arm and lead her away to Fortescue’s, chattering all the way.</p><p>All in all, Lily thinks it’s been a pretty good day.</p><p>//</p><p>The Hogwarts Express leaves on Sunday. Eris fails to convince James she’s well enough to push her own trunk, allows first Mr. and Mrs. Potter and then Petunia Evans to hug her goodbye, canvasses the platform until she spots Regulus and ascertains he’s unharmed and finally, allows herself to fall asleep on Lily’s shoulder with the sounds of the boy’s laughter as a lullaby.</p>
