    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p>The golden three stood there on the bridge looking out. The Highland hills had always been beautiful but at this moment they were beyond exquisite. There was a sense of freedom that felt almost tangible, like nothing any of them had felt in a very long time. A few tears slipped past Hermione’s eyes as they gripped each other’s hands. A weight that had been so heavy and burdensome was lifting, they could all feel it.</p>
<p>"Let's go back" muttered Harry a smile creeping onto his face, it didn't quite reach his eyes and Hermione knew why. They gained so much today, yes but so much had been lost to them as well.</p>
<p>"Yeah" replied Ron placing a heavy arm around Hermione's shoulders.</p>
<p>As they began to turn Hermione stopped there was a buzzing noise in her ear... in the air. "Do you hear that?"</p>
<p>"Yeah..." was Ron's slow response.</p>
<p>Then Hermione felt her stomach drop, shooting from the depths of where it had just vanished was the broken pieces of the discarded Elder Wand encompassed in a bright golden light.</p>
<p>It repaired itself in mid-air and fell at Harry’s feet. Stunned they all looked at each other, then the boys to Hermione.</p>
<p> “I…” but even she was at a loss as to what had just happened. There was old magic in the Deathly Hallows they all knew it but for it to do this was not exactly expected. A small shower of sparks expelled from the tip of the wand and there on the rubble spelt out four words I must be possessed.</p>
<p>Just then there was a massive crack they all turned toward to school. From what was left of the Great Hall's ceiling shot a giant beam of bright burnt orange light exploding into the sky. They felt the ground vibrate and the air change then the beam disappeared and there was screaming and shouting.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>It’s easy to tell you’re in a lighted room, even if your eyes are closed. You can see or sense a kind of pale glow from behind your eyelids. Hermione knew when she awoke there was sunlight streaming in from somewhere. When she was finally able to open her eyes the big window to her left was spilling bright yellow light into the tiny hospital room. That was better than waking up in the dark. It always terrified her as a child when she would occasionally fall asleep reading in her bed with daylight clear outside waking a few hours later to black pitch sky showing from the window. It made her panic like she wasn’t sure how long she had been sleeping.</p>
<p>As her mind and eyes adjusted she gained the courage to turn. Ron’s eyes lit a little when he saw she was awake “Mione” he breathed and sat up straighter.</p>
<p>Until she had seen Ron Hermione had felt light and comfortable but seeing the tired look in his eyes and the clear pain lurking there as well she started to remember things. “Ron… is… how long have I been asleep?”</p>
<p>“Bout five days give or take a few hours… don’t worry you're fine though, they said you'd heal a little quicker with sleeping potions in you” he made an effort to smile and reached out to grasp her hand in his, his eyes were showing tears now.</p>
<p>Hermione gulped beginning to remember she whispered softly “its… that means…” The emotion was choking her she could feel it burning her throat.</p>
<p>Ron’s only response was a nod before hanging his head.</p>
<p>She had hoped it was all a terrible dream, getting back to the great hall finding it filled with people who were supposed to be dead and seeing ones that weren’t falling. As soon as a stunned Voldemort saw Harry he gripped his chest as if searching for something inside him, when it was clear he didn’t find it he was gone and with him went several Deatheaters, some stayed most likely on his orders. Ron saw Fred and dashed off into the fray, whilst Harry holding the elder wand like it was a dead mouse tried to duck his way towards Professor McGonagall.</p>
<p>More Deatheaters began to disperse as wizards banded together seemingly ignoring the strange turn of events. Hermione didn’t know what to do, a group led by Kingsley and Arthur were driving back what was left of the Deatheaters to injured to flee. There were smaller fights happening around and that was when Hermione saw Ginny being driven up stairs where more ramparts were by Alecto Carrow, taking off she followed prepared to aid her friend.</p>
<p>They were moving quickly and it was very hard to see as rubble and bits of stone blasted her face from the force of the spells being cast. Once out under the open sky that used to be ceiling Hermione aimed a stupefy at Alecto. It didn’t meet its mark but it did distract her so Ginny could pelt some of the scattered debris at her opponent. Hermione closed in trying to get a better aim when she heard a shriek, Ginny had misstepped and tripped over the edge barely hanging on to the stone ledge her wand still laying on the flat ground a foot or so from her hand.</p>
<p>Carrow took this moment of distraction to shoot a boulder-sized chunk of the castle at Hermione’s torso, hitting her in the side with such force it knocked her back against more stone. She tried to struggle up as blinding pain shot through her stomach and side, gripping it she felt blood seeping between her fingers. Then she saw Alecto standing over Ginny wand raised.</p>
<p>“Expell…” Hermione tried but wordlessly Bellatrix’s wand ended up in Alecto’s hand. Forcing herself to rise Hermione threw herself at the witch screaming, once again she was thrown back by magic her head knocking hard on the ground. Blinding pain shot through her right ear and for a moment she could not see or hear anything. Soft ringing was penetrating her skull but the next words she heard perfectly, they would resound in her mind for the rest of her life.</p>
<p>“Avada Kadavra.” Alecto Carrow’s voice rang out and there was a soft thud of Ginny’s body hitting the ledge below.</p>
<p>The scream that escaped Hermione’s throat was alien to her ears, she wasn’t even sure how she had the breath to make that scream. Now it was coming in short gasps from the pain in her ribs and the agony in her heart. Alecto turned quickly a smile on her lips, looking pathetically at Hermione’s broken form that was now standing by will alone. A well placed Diffindo came next and with nothing to stop it, Hermione staggered a large gash appearing below her right eye and down her cheek.</p>
<p>She had to think of something she wouldn’t die like this not after everything they had been through.</p>
<p>Another spell blood trickled down her arm.</p>
<p>If I can get out of the line of fire… trying to move quickly she was stopped by another spell that tossed her into the stone wall for what must have been the third or fourth time, Alecto closing in on her. Hermione was pleading in her heart for something, an idea, a thought, anything. She was supposed to be the brilliant one and all she felt was a soft burn in her chest… so she was dying any way then, too much blood loss, internal haemorrhaging, everything was feeling cold and blurry.</p>
<p>Behind Alecto, there was a flash of black swirling smoke and suddenly the form of Professor Snape the man she had seen die only hours before stood pointing his wand at Alecto, in an instant, she was disarmed, unconscious and bound. The world around Hermione was swimming, seeming to go grey and spotty the harder she focused on the intense presence approaching her. The burning in her chest intensified as he came closer. He looked gaunt and tired but he was definitely alive.</p>
<p>She tried to speak lifting a bloody hand to her chest trying to tell him that he chest hurt that she was dying but she couldn’t her mouth tasted of blood and no words would escape.</p>
<p>He lifted her up “don’t try, it will only hurt more.”</p>
<p>The burning in her chest was now scorching and just before the world went dim, whisky eyes met obsidian and the burning turned into warmth.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Ron held her carefully on the hospital bed as she wept for her friend and after he listed more casualties she wept some more. She was now able to feel the pain in her side and the many cuts and bruises that showed over her shockingly pallid skin but the pain in her heart was the worst. It was physical, the ache was real, it wasn’t in her head… it was in her soul, her mind and body. Ron was crying then too, they sat there together sobbing until it seemed like all the water in their bodies had been used up.</p>
<p>“Harry…” she whispered looking up at Ron.</p>
<p>He grimaced “he’s… hasn’t spoken much, Remus and Tonks have been with him but even they can’t get much out of him.”</p>
<p>More tears slipped out as she thought of her best friend.</p>
<p>“Mum’s bedridden, suppose losing Fred then getting him back then… Gin… well, she’s not doing well.”</p>
<p>Hermione could see the distance in Ron’s eyes, a hopelessness that wasn’t going away, they sat there in silence for a long while, only interrupted by a medi-witch that came to check on Hermione’s bandages and inform her that she could go the next morning.</p>
<p>A thought entered Hermione’s mind after a long while, “What happened to Professor Snape? He saved me, didn’t he?” Part of her thought it was a dream.</p>
<p>Ron gave a look of consternation but nodded “yeah he did, as far as I know, the last thing Harry did before hiding himself away was give Kings and the others Snape’s memories. He’s under house arrest at Hogwarts… or home base whatever we are calling it now until they decide what to do with him.”</p>
<p>“But he saved us… well almost did if this mess hadn’t occurred” it all felt for nought now.</p>
<p>“Yeah well, I guess they need to review all the evidence, he was a right git so who cares what happens to him” Ron scoffed looking annoyed.</p>
<p>“I just think that’s not fair.”</p>
<p>“Well life isn’t if you haven’t realized,” he said with such resentment and malice and it sounded so unlike Ron she quieted deciding that this was not the conversation for the moment and they fell back into silence and thought…and hurt.</p>
<p>She didn’t know what had possessed her in all this mess to think about Professor Snape but after what happened on the ramparts that day she couldn’t get him out of her mind. There had been that one moment before she had fallen unconscious when their eyes met and for that one moment, she thought that everything would be okay not to mention that strange burning sensation she felt in her chest. Hermione knew that though he shook it off quickly he had felt it too. Only one thing was very certain in her mind they all had to finish this, through all the unbearable they needed to continue to be strong, if they weren’t united anymore they would lose.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The Wizengamot was in shambles as was most of the wizarding world, meaning that disciplinary action for recently not dead people was difficult. Hogwarts had become a sort of home base, Voldemort was still out there which meant the war wasn’t over. Severus’s most precious memories had been viewed by the majority of the inhabiting populace. This meant that he was either looked at with pity, regret or contempt. Personally, he preferred the later.</p>
<p>Shacklebolt was being looked to as the leader, not surprising and not the worst option they had. One of the few members of the order that Severus didn’t have true animosity for. When Kingsley explained the situation to him, he wasn’t angry when the acting Minister said that for the time being he was to stay under a form of house arrest at Hogwarts. Severus wasn’t angry because he was still dead inside. Well not literally. Unfortunately, he still felt all the anguish that his wretched life warranted, coupled a new ache inside him that he couldn’t place.  </p>
<p>Days, after the initial shock had worn down all, came to the depressing conclusion that Voldemort though less immortal than before was still out there and so were many Deatheaters. His arm would ache and seer with pain, no matter what he tried it wouldn’t be fixed. St. Mungos was nearly in ruin and with so many injuries from either the first battle or the second, it was no surprise that the whole of the rabble gathered were in need of many potions. It was Minerva who suggested it, they hadn’t yet spoken but Severus saw the way she looked at him with so much regret that she shouldn’t feel, he deserved the hatred.</p>
<p>She gleaned that as everyone now had duties of some sort it would be prudent to stock up on not only medical potions but those of the defensive and offensive variety. Of course, he said yes, there really was no point in protesting he had to be here and brewing at least made him feel a little less awful. For the majority of his life that had been the case, losing himself in work. Severus did insist that he had an assistant and as Slughorn had perished he also stated that they needed to be competent and capable of keeping up.</p>
<p>He had checked on the Granger girl once after being the one to deposit her to Poppy. He had been arrested almost instantly but to his slight surprise Potter made quite a fuss in his defence, it seemed to be the last thing he had the strength for, before falling into a state of depression. It was late that night before she had been transferred to St. Mungos. The spell Kingsley and a few others had placed on him wouldn’t allow him to leave and they had taken his wand so him roaming the castle didn’t seem to concern them. Most didn't know the extent of his proficiency with wandless and non-verbal magic.</p>
<p>Severus couldn’t deny the feeling that had brought him to her aid and that only intensified as he got closer. He had been contemplating throwing himself from the highest turret he could find when he felt that she was in danger, how he had felt it at all terrified him. Warily Shaklebolt had informed him of the Elder Wand and the surge of magic that had erupted in its response to being broken. Vaguely hoping that Severus had any knowledge about such things, unfortunately, any that he did was minimal. The Hallows were old, rooted in dark and light magic, it went beyond what most witches and wizards had any inkling of today. Whatever happened must have awakened very aged magic and that coupled with the intense impression he had felt that day and days after concerned Severus greatly.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Hermione bit back a sob as the service concluded. It wasn’t long but had felt like hours they stood there on the grassy hill near the Black Lake in the cool air of morning, the sky a muted grey. Listening to the names being read off, hearing the great and good all had done. Ron had held her so tightly her still very sore body ached, she just let it happen there was no way to assuage his pain, she would do what she was able.</p>
<p>The ceremony thankfully had been postponed until those injured could attend. With dire issues, still very much at the forefront of their minds especially those leading, it was inevitable that a meeting needed to be held after the ceremony had ended. Mrs.Weasley hadn’t been well enough to attend and Harry said nothing during the service or as Kingsley and Professor McGonagall talked of plans and pulling together to end this. The Boy Who Lived just stood there staring at the remembrance paper in his hands.</p>
<p>Hermione looked down at her own parchment and the names it held:</p>
<p>Professor Horace Slughorn</p>
<p>Professor Sybil Trelawney</p>
<p>Lavender Brown</p>
<p>Dean Thomas</p>
<p>Padma Patil</p>
<p>Alicia Spinnet</p>
<p>Cho Chang</p>
<p>Pansy Parkinson</p>
<p>Ginny Weasley</p>
<p>She stopped the tears welling up again there were more names at least a dozen more, fellow students she had sat in class with or saw in the great hall, it all hurt. Turning her face to look at the school, Abeforth and Remus were really doing a decent job of making it usable for its now forced purpose but there were too many scars over its stone walls to hold the warmth and familiarity that she had known it to for so long.</p>
<p>“Come on Mione the meetings over” Ron shook her from thoughts with that voice that seemed so unlike his, harsher.</p>
<p>“What are they doing?” She asked gesturing to some of the others being handed pieces of paper, she tried to ignore Harry’s retreating form, he hadn’t spoken to them in three days and never came to see her in the hospital.</p>
<p>“They’re all getting assignments to help fortify or prepare or whatever” he scrutinized her confused expression, “weren’t you listening? Everyone is pitching in but Kings said we could take a break for a while get ourselves… sorted before we took on anything else.”</p>
<p>“Oh,” she thought for a moment she didn’t want to relax, if she tried to do that she would go mad, “I’ll just see what they need, maybe I can help.”</p>
<p>Ron’s eyes flashed “Hermione just leave it, there’s no need you should take some time”, he sounded angry.</p>
<p>She frowned in return not wanting to hurt him but she had to get her point across, “there is a need Ron, I won’t pick up too much just something to keep me busy” she reassured softly.</p>
<p>“Fine” he countered, then as he began to walk away muttered, “you’d think grief’d keep you busy enough.”</p>
<p>First, she started after him then stopped knowing that he might need some time alone. Instead, she held her head up and walked to the others. After a little persuasion, she was able to convince McGonagall that she was well enough to have a purpose, still sore she was able to do most activities not too strenuous and she could be on her feet if not for very long.</p>
<p>She glanced over the list of occupations that needed to be filled, stilling on one. “Professor Snape needs an assistant?” Her heart clenched a little at the thought, he had been absent at meals and she had been hoping to thank him for not only saving her but everything Harry had shown her.</p>
<p>“Indeed, though we may not have enough help” muttered McGonagall passingly.</p>
<p>“So, he’s been let off then?”</p>
<p>“No, not yet,” said the older witch pausing slightly at the awkward subject, she herself had wanted a moment alone to say something to Severus.</p>
<p>“Well they couldn’t imprison him it wouldn’t be right” stated the curly headed Gryffindor defiantly.</p>
<p>“That will be the new council’s decision”, then looking at Hermione carefully spoke in a hushed voice, “though I don’t know how they could truly lock him up after all he did.”</p>
<p>“I want to take the assistant position” Hermione barely had time to realize she thought the words before they were out of her mouth, a sense of eagerness hanging over her head at the thought of seeing the potions master.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>It felt strange to wake up in the same bed so often now. Months of not knowing where or what she would be sleeping on had made her grateful for the luxury but it was disconcerting all the same. With almost everyone from the Order or as Kingsley had been putting it the good side and school being not in the cards for the near future there was no need for dormitories. In their renovations, Ramus, Tonks and some of the others had constructed temporary smaller but full rooms for everyone that wished to stay within the safety of the school… or makeshift magical bomb shelter whatever it was now. </p>
<p>She hadn’t quite been up to sleeping on her own and apparently neither had Ron after so long hearing each other or Harry breathing close to them. So, as she threw the covers off herself that morning she spotted Ron on the couch. She wasn’t sure if he would be there as they had rowed the night before about her taking on a job right now which inevitably like most arguments recently lead to him bringing up that she wouldn’t let him sleep in the bed with her, amidst other things. Part of her felt bad that she was denying him this comfort from her but it felt wrong to her somehow, she wanted her first time to be special.</p>
<p>Dragging herself to the bathroom, ever the dentist’s daughter she brushed her teeth thoroughly trying her best not to look too hard in the mirror. Bruises and scabs were prevalent on her face and body, they made her feel ugly and weak. She found herself grateful for the first time that she was not blessed in the boob department as her broken ribs and bruised abdomen would not allow an underwire.</p>
<p>Instead, she pulled on a threadbare t-shirt that had belonged to her father, then a pair of faded jeans not tight enough to constrict her already painful movements. Hermione’s hair hadn’t cooperated in weeks but a messy bun took care of it well enough. Guzzling two of the potions she required to keep the pain at bay she headed for the potions lab.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Severus was nearly pacing the room when he should’ve been getting ingredients ready. Instead his mind was whirring with how he was planning to cope with Miss Granger being his assistant. He had become far too intrigued when Minerva first told him and now he was going to actually deal with this issue. He could care less she was there… shouldn’t be too hard to ignore her and whatever had been stirring inside him. No doubt the result of snake bite, death then not death, he could deal with going mad.</p>
<p>There was a tentative knock at the door and he let the impassive mask descend barking out a harsh “come in.”</p>
<p>When she entered, he was grateful for all the years as a spy, he was so close to showing some form of emotions when he saw the bruises and injuries visible on her face and what skin he could see. The discolourations were dark purple and tinged with yellow around the edges, the way she walked made it clear that she was in considerable discomfort and yet his emotionless mask prevailed.</p>
<p>“Good morning Professor” was he mistaken or was there hope in her voice and in the weak smile she gave him. </p>
<p>“Hmm, begin sorting through those, there is a rather large stock of healing potions needed at St. Mungos” he drawled gesturing to the various mushrooms on a tabletop nearby.</p>
<p>Her shoulders fell a little but she hobbled her way to the place he had indicated and began, “the attack in London, that’s why they need so many isn’t it?” The morning before they had all been notified that Voldemort had struck for the first time since the incident on the 2nd and it was devastating nearly twenty wizards and witches killed… the muggle numbers were even higher.</p>
<p>“Miss Granger is it in your ability to stay silent or shall I need to ascertain new help” he spat out the words with a ferocity that made his insides ache more than they did beforehand.</p>
<p>There may have been moisture that welled for a second in her eyes but it was gone just as fast, instead, she turned back to her task muttering coolly “sorry, Sir.”</p>
