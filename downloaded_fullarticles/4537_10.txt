    <p>Hermione stood next to her parents at king's cross.</p><p> She had given them their memories back since they weren't in any danger anymore. Lord Voldemort has been defeated.</p><p> Hermione smiled to herself as she saw the Weasley's and Harry approaching. The black-haired wizard held the hand of a red-headed girl, Ginny Weasley, who was his girlfriend and Hermione's best friend.</p><p> Ron Weasley, Hermione's own boyfriend,  walked next to them.</p><p> Hermione had spent nearly the whole summer with the Weasley's. But she had to leave, for her family. She had missed them. When she stood at her parents' house door, they hadn't recognized her at all, so it had taken some time to convince them to let her in.</p><p> After her mom had made her a cup of tea, she had taken her spell away from them, returning all of their memories.</p><p> She then had a lot of explaining to do.</p><p> However, they were all reunited and that was what counted to her.</p><p> She smiled at the Weasley family. George had come, too, his ear still missing from when Snape's Sectumsempra had hit him. She knew why he had kept it this way. His twin brother, Fred, had died in the battle. She winced at the memory. George sure had wanted a separation from his brother - and a memory.</p><p> All those sacrifices - No. This was gonna be a good year. She would spend it with Harry, Ginny and of course Ron, she would have a good time and after school, she would get to work in the ministry of magic. Hopefully.</p><p> Molly and Arthur went to say hello to her parents while Hermione was greeted by her friends. She gave Ron a peck on the lips. "How have you been doing?" she asked smiling up at him.</p><p> He grinned back. "Good, but it would've been better with you."</p><p> He laughed. "Likewise."</p><p> Ginny took her hand. "I see, you and your parents are reunited?"</p><p> Hermione nodded in agreement. "Yes, gladly."</p><p> They then went to the platforms 9 and 10. Hermione held Ron's hand.</p><p> She let out a shaky breath. So they would really return to Hogwarts.</p><p> She felt a tug in her belly. One of happiness, but at the same time there was fear involved. The same fear that you tend to face when you're in front of a teacher and have learned your brains out for this moment but are afraid that you overdid it and will black out in any minute.</p><p> Hermione wondered how things will have changed judging by the battle they fought a year ago. Would it be a completely other Hogwarts? Of course, everything has been set back to normal, as far as that was possible, but the shape of the Castle didn't matter in such terms.</p><p> It was the memories she feared. She could still feel the fear, the sadness. She tended on bonding her memories to emotions. Would it change Hogwarts for her? Would she think of it as less of a home?</p><p> "That's it, finally we're going home," Harry said as if he had been reading her thoughts. He obviously still thought of it as a home. Ginny and Ron agreed. No one seemed to notice Hermione said nothing. "Yeah," she quickly said - a little too late. The others didn't seem to mind her late reaction because they remained silent.</p><p> One after another, they went to platform 9 3/4. When Hermione stepped her feet on it, she nearly feared that everything would be cold and people would be quiet, weighted and scared to let their kids go to the school, where so many died the year before.</p><p> But here, the war was forgotten. In front of her, the Hogwarts express stood, big and steady as ever. All around her were families saying goodbye, friends chattering and kids laughing. She could bring herself to think of everything being the same as always at the sight of that, even though she knew - somewhere in the back of her head - it wasn't.</p><p> "Goodbye, Hermione, darling," said Mrs Weasley, tugging her hands in hers. "I hope to see you on Christmas."</p><p> Hermione smiled at her. "Goodbye, Mrs Weasley. I'm looking forward to it."</p><p> Mrs Weasley laughed. "I told you before, it's Molly, please."</p><p> "Molly, then," Hermione said, a blush spreading across her face. She really was more to the Weasley's family now. She was a part of the family. She felt a warmth spread inside of her.</p><p> Molly smiled brightly at her.</p><p> Then the ginger woman turned to her daughter and son, telling them goodbye, too and planting kisses on their cheeks.</p><p> After they had said farewell to everybody, they got on the train. Luckily, they managed to get a compartment together.</p><p> Harry and Ginny sat on one side, Ron, and Hermione on the other.</p><p> Once they sat, bags safely hidden in the luggage racks, the train started its journey towards Hogwarts.</p><p> They talked about the teachers they thought would give it a go this year. Then, for an hour or something, Harry, Ginny, and Ron discussed what they would like to do after the school year. Silently, Hermione thought it's too early to really think about that. They didn't even know what this year holds in store for them!</p><p> She felt bad thinking that, her friends were just right to look forward to a bright future. She just hoped their daydreaming didn't keep them from working hard for their goals. Maybe she was just being paranoid.</p><p> "... After all, I will - of course - be doing something with Hermione on my side, right? Hermione?"</p><p> "Huh?"</p><p> It had been Ron, who had spoken to her. Fully drowned in her own thoughts, she hadn't really paid attention to her friend's conversation. "Yeah, 'course."</p><p> "Is everything OK?" asked Ginny, a worried expression on her face.</p><p> "Yeah." Hermione straightened up a little bit and took Ron's hand. "Everything's fine."</p><p> Then the Hogwarts Express Trolley rolled by their compartment. The woman behind it asked if they would like some sweets, and Harry and Ron bought some. Ginny and Hermione, however, didn't. They weren't that hungry.</p><p> The rest of the drive was silent, apart from Ron and Harry eating.</p><p> Everybody lingered in their own thoughts.</p><p> All too soon, they were back to Hogwarts.</p>
