    <p>Nosty shivered. It had been a bloody awful day. Horrible creeping fog that soaked a body in fucking minutes. The stupid weather was setting everyone on edge. The rozzers were freer with their fists and more likely to drag folks to the nick for fuck all, and the wankers at the shelters were enforcing all the poxy rules; kicking a man out in this weather for a bit o’swearing, fucking inhuman that was. Even his boys were getting tetchy. Thank fuck his boys were piss easy to entertain.</p><p>The all-night cafe was barely full enough to make this worthwhile, but the boys need to blow off steam. They’d cause a bit of chaos, nick a few wallets and Nosty would get a warm bed for the night, not too shabby for a bit of pain. The quacks might be able to give him some decent meds this time. He’d been seeing some fucking weird shite the past few months; flying things in cloaks, green lights in the sky, and that odd bloke in a pointy hat who walked through the window of an old department store. All fucked up stuff that couldn’t be real. Nosty was crazy, but he knew flying motorbikes were real.</p><p>To be honest he’d done this trick so often now the nerves in his shoulder were well fucked. The punters were nervously eying his boys as he swiped a bottle off the counter and took a swig. Bossman behind the counter was flapping his gums shouting some shite. Nosty ignored him and shattered the bottle on the edge of a table.</p><p>“Hari Kari for the boys!”</p><p>The jagged end of the bottle went into his shoulder at speed. He didnae really feel it until he fell backwards and thumped his head off the grotty tiles. He heard his boys scarper and someone was shouting about an ambulance. Fucking good too, this floor was disgusting, there were mouldy crumbs crusted under the edge of the counter, had this bastard never heard of a broom?</p><p>“No! Don’t touch him. He might have something.”</p><p>Cheeky fucker, I’ve no even got the clap. Nosty tried to form the words but his mouth felt mushy. The cafe was all grey, fog must’ve got in. Funny that fog and thunder. A blinding flash of lightening made the whole room go white.</p><p>“I think it’s too late.”</p><p>The wee lassie sounded sad, nice of her to be concerned for the likes o’him.</p><p>Nosty blinked; “Dinae worry lassie, ambulance always turns up in time.”</p><p>“There was an explosion about an hour ago up in Whitehall, was on the news, not a chance an ambulance is going to get here now.”</p><p>Bossman sounded disgusted, well he was used to that from people, and that dirty wanker had no right to sneer. Environmental Health might pay a concerned citizen who expressed their doubts about the cleanliness o’this place. Nice way to make a bit o’cash while he was in hospital. Nosty sniffed and ambled over to the window. Rozzers were flying past all lights flashing and sirens blaring. Something big had happened then.</p><p>Wait a fucking minute, when had he stood up?</p><p>“We should cover him up with something.”</p><p>“I’ll get a tablecloth.”</p><p>Very slowly Nosty turned on his heel. Bossman and a pretty lassie were standing on the edge of a fucking huge puddle of blood. They shifted and Nosty saw himself lying on the floor. The bottle was still in his shoulder, his face was pale, and his eyes were staring up at the ceiling. He started laughing, that couldn’t be him on the floor there. He was standing right here, solid as yer please. Laughing like a loon he backed away and found himself stood outside the window.</p><p>He’d just walk through the glass. He reached forward and pushed his hand clean through the solid pane. What the fucking hell was going on?  Balling his hand into a fist he punched the glass. The momentum carried him forward and he stumbled into the cafe again. If finally dawned on him that his hand looked wrong, he’d always been pale but never pearly white. Looking down the rest of him was the same pasty colour, clothes and all. He looked like a fucking ghost.</p><p>“What have yer done ta me ya bastard! Hey fuckface! Listen ta me!”</p><p>Bossman didnae react at all. Neither did the lassie, she didnae cringe or look appalled at his outburst. It was her lack of reaction that convinced him they couldnae see or hear him.</p><p>A fucking ghost.</p><p>Nosty crouched down, not noticing that he was floating several inches off the floor and wrapped his arms across his chest. He was dead. That was his dead body cooling like a fucking lump of meat a few feet away. Dead. And a ghost.</p><p>The cafe owner stuck a finger in his ear and wriggled it around. All the sirens must be giving him tinnitus; just for a moment there he was sure he’d heard someone laughing hysterically.</p><p> </p><p>Belle was skipping to keep up with Papa. He was upset about the Tube being cancelled because of the people in cloaks. She was glad they were getting away from them because they were odd, and Papa didn’t like odd. Belle rather liked some of their cloaks, they looked swishy and warm, but she knew better than to say that out loud.</p><p>Outside a cafe she noticed her shoelace was undone.</p><p>“Hold on Papa.”</p><p>He slowed and stood huffing as he waited for her to tie it. As she stood up something silver caught her eye.</p><p>“Papa why is that shiny man crying?”</p><p>His eyes bulged when he looked to where she was pointing. With fast strides he hurried back to her and grabbed her wrist in his hand. Belle yelped, but Papa just dragged her along the street and around the corner.</p><p>He shoved her against the wall and bent down to jab a thick finger in her face.</p><p>“I’ve told you before. You see anything abnormal like shiny silver men and you ignore it. You don’t look at it. You don’t talk about it. It never happened. Understand?”</p><p>Belle gave him a shaky nod. Papa shook her shoulder hard and her head bumped off the wall behind her.</p><p>“Do you understand?”</p><p>“Yes Papa! I’m sorry.”</p><p>Moe French stomped away down the street, cursing under his breath. Belle took a deep breath and trailed after him, making sure to keep out of swinging distance.</p>
