    <p>Ron Bilius Weasley knew that to be the 6th son, and second youngest was nothing special, growing up in the Weasley household only enforced this notion. He wasn't special. Not to his parents, not to the teachers he would meet, but his eyes shone with loyalty to his passions and a strange fascination swum in his gaze. Ron would be Special</p><p> </p><p>Hermione Jean Granger, possessing a thirst for knowledge that rivalled scholars, Hermione had no interest in being normal, she was drunk on knowledge her fires burned with the books she had consumed and her eyes shone with a mad flicker, she had no intention of slowing down for anyone else's comfort.</p><p> </p><p>Harry James Potter, raised by the Dursleys and taught to hide his fear, hide his pain, hide his suffering. Falling into a world where everyone knows his name and has expectations of him, Harry crushes those expectations with a scary smile and empty eyes, this world abandoned him why should he settle for the hero, instead he would be great.</p><hr/><p> </p><p>A single man in a torn and battered brown coat stood, shoulders hunched in front of two empty graves, their respective occupants sitting aside their eternal resting place.</p><p> </p><p>Remus choked out a few words as though it would do his friends justice, “He’s dead James… the rest of the world’s going nuts, Harry did it. Your son, I know you would be proud… and Lily- Dear god… Lily, you both fought so goddamn well. I just-.” He cut himself off with a cry “I’m going to miss you so much, it's just not fair!... It’s not fair…”</p><p> </p><p>He had fallen to his knees by the end of his words, and let the sobs wracked his body, alone at the foot of his friends' graves. Consumed with more emotions than he could ever remember feeling, he wept for all he had lost... and he was alone.</p><p> </p><p>Night had fallen long ago when Remus shoulders finally stopped shaking, a tired look replaced the tears and he wordlessly waved his wand, lifting the caskets and placing them in their graves, dirt piled on top, sealing them forever in the earth and Remus’s mind felt a flash of hatred at the lack of witness to this painful moment.</p><p>There had been no funeral.</p><p> </p><p>Remus had been out of the country when he had heard the news of Voldemort's demise. The ministry had been cracking down on all possible threats, not wanting to be caught as a half-breed, Remus had left to help as much as he could elsewhere, so he had head of the news from a paper found on the wizarding streets of Mirto, his breath had caught at the headline “POTTER IL RAGAZZO DEFORMA IL SIGNORE SCURO” and his mind translated the words as quickly as he could, scanning the paper rapidly “POTTER BOY DEFEATS DARK LORD” The article mainly talked about the miracle of Harry surviving and Remus if he had much presence of mind left, felt some relief at that, but it wasn't until the end that he let himself truly think what it all meant. There in print were the words "-James and Lily Potter were unfortunately not among the miracles that night, their deaths mark the end of the war and the beginning of a new age-” Remus dropped the paper and apparated.</p><p> </p><p>He appeared at Godric's Hollow to find the house in ruins, but as he ran inside the place was fairly clean for all its destruction. He wasn’t entirely sure what he was looking for when he bolted up the stairs, and he found himself alone with blackened walls.</p><p> </p><p>His eyes caught on a photograph knocked out of place and he reached down to grab it. Turning it over revealed all four of his best friends on their last day of school, Sirius rubbing his knuckles in James hair while the other shrieked in dismay, Lily kissing Peter on the check and Peter responding with a delighted smile and pulling the younger witch into a hug, Remus remembers taking the photo and an unknown tear escaped his eye. Sirius, always annoyingly perceptive, had silently saddled up to him and casually pulled him into a one armed hug brushing the tear away as he went, “Not crying for me I hope Moony.”</p><p> </p><p>The tears left his eyes this time did not go unnoticed and Remus let out a soundless scream, the noise getting stuck in his throat as the realization of what had happened fully hit him.</p><p> </p><p>Remus had sort out Dumbledore after that, the whereabouts of the Potter's bodies was unknown to him, as was the date of their funeral. When he had cornered the older wizard in his office he offered his help any way he could, after all he hadn’t been there when his friends were murdered, he hadn't been there. The words ran around and around his head and were sharply broken by the next words his old headmaster spoke.</p><p> </p><p>“-no Funeral.”</p><p> </p><p>“What?” The word was said with only bafflement, why would there be no funeral unless- “Does their insurance not cover it, oh, of course! the money is Harry’s now, he’ll be needing it-”</p><p> </p><p>“-Remus…” Dumbledore tried to interrupt</p><p> </p><p>A panicked thought hit Remus, then who would pay for it, he barely had enough to live or let alone pay for a funeral the things were unexplainably expensive. Another idea came to Remus and he nearly squirmed at the thought of asking another for money, but no, this isn't about him, it was for his friends and he would be damned if he let his pride get in the way.</p><p> </p><p>Squaring his shoulders he prepared himself to ask “Dumbledore, I know it’s a terrible thing to ask, but I can’t make the funds for a funeral, I promise I would pay you back, I could even do it in writing if you’d like, I-”</p><p> </p><p>“Mr Lupin.” Remus paused letting his old professor speak “In light of these tragic events the world is just beginning to recover and rejoice at the loss of a darkness, I do not think it would be wise to throw a shadow over everyone's attempts to return to normality.”</p><p> </p><p>Remus’s confusion must have shone through because Dumbledore gave him a pitting expression like he was a child who just couldn’t grasp the gravity of a situation and was about to be told to wait until they were older.</p><p> </p><p>“Mr Lupin, there is not going to be a Funeral for Lily and James Potter, the world does not need to be reminded of the negativity passed, their bodies will be brought to their graves by Madam Pomfrey after she has finished her examination and then they will be put to rest, I am sorry Remus.”</p><p> </p><p>Remus felt the apology as a kick to the gut and yet he still could not fully understand, his best friends were not being given a burial, a goodbye, because their death was too dark for the world to think about? The past years all the world had known was death now it was a forbidden subject? Remus snarled and his rage at all the injustice and hurt finally surfaced, his hate for the loss of his friends, his knowledge of the fight between his other last two remaining friends resulting in another loss of life and Sirius… He struggled not to think along that path and instead let himself scream at the professor while the other only continued to look on calmly.</p><p> </p><p>When Remus truly believed it would not be wise for him to remain in a vicinity with another person, let alone the professor, he stormed away and found himself at his old apartment he had briefly shared with Sirius, here he let out all the rage he had held back in Dumbledore's office.</p><p>Once calm he apparated to the Godric Hollow gravesite and in the beating down of the burning sun, he waited.</p><p> </p><p>oooOOOooo</p><p> </p><p>Once Remus had cried all his tears for the past he turned his mind to the future and was ashamed to realise he hadn’t thought of Harry more than once, resolved to fix that immediately he found himself heading to Dumbledore one again, this time much more composed.</p><p> </p><p>Even when Dumbledore informed him of Harry's current whereabouts he didn’t let himself lash out, he only logically listed all the reasons he was a better guardian than Petunia.</p><p>Petunia, he had meet the other Evan’s three times in his life before. Once when he had just finished his first year at Hogwarts and his parents needed to leave for 2 weeks during the summer holidays, as soon as Lily had found out, she offered to let him stay at hers, he had made sure not to let his other friends know, not wanting to inconvenience them so he never did find out how she knew, but neither the less the Evans had made a bed for him in their home and it was something he never forgot.</p><p> </p><p>That was the first time he had meet Petunia, she had come across instantly as someone he would ordinarily fear, if a wizard possessed the personality she did and if they ever found out he was a werewolf they would be the ones carrying pitchforks, he made sure to stay clear of the girl and keep his head down as much as possible for those two weeks.</p><p> </p><p>The second time was for Lily's 14th birthday, she had invited them all over to hers for the summer and although he didn’t stay the whole time, having to lie about his mother being sick, Lily had given him a knowing look and a gentle brush on his arm right along one of his scars, Petunia had seen and started sneering, sporting out every accusation she could think of.</p><p> </p><p>The third time was a little over a few years ago when Lily had excitedly asked him over to help her choose which dress to wear for Petunia’s wedding, only for Petunia to burst into the room in an outrage, declaring she would not be having a freak at her wedding and that it washer chance at a new start away from all Lily’s weirdness. Remus had held Lily as she cried and he remembered feeling a sharp resentment toward the brunette girl who caused his friend so much pain with her hateful words, it was a toxic relationship and one Lily was forced to grow up with.</p><p> </p><p>It was those thoughts that kept him from giving up on becoming Harry’s guardian, He wouldn’t leave his friend's child to grow up in a toxic environment, even if it meant he had to raise the kid himself, no matter how unfit he may be, he was better than that woman.</p><p> </p><p>And so Remus went to the ministry. But no matter how good of a friend he had been to Harry’s parents, blood relations trumped all else, except Godparents, which of course Sirius had been named.</p><p> </p><p>And so Remus let Dumbledore talk him out of trying to move Harry, citing Harry needing to grow up in the muggle world, and using Remus’s werewolf status as another reason Harry was in better care that Remus could provide. Knowing it was an argument he would never win short of stealing the boy away from his new guardians and then evading Dumbledore, Remus moved on to another issue that had been bothering him. Sirius.</p><p> </p><p>“Professor Sirius- he-, He loved James! He loved him! And Lily… dear god and little Harry, Sirius Love them all they were his family and…”</p><p> </p><p>“Sometimes the thing right in front of us, is the hardest thing to accept.”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t believe that.”</p><p> </p><p>Dumbledore frowned as if Remus was being a particularly troublesome child, “Remus, Sirius was their secret keeper, James told me himself that he had chosen Sirius.</p><p> </p><p>“-When’s his trial?”</p><p> </p><p>Dumbledore sighed “Mr Lupin, do not pursue this, I know you and Sirius were close.”</p><p> </p><p>Remus paced “What if he’s innocent, what if the trial comes back and Sirius is innocent, then Harry can live with Sirius and I, and we can go into the muggle world and raise him away from all magic and his fame..”</p><p> </p><p>“A fantasy world.”</p><p> </p><p>And with those few words Remus broke down crying again, on the floor of Dumbledore's study he sobbed as Dumbledore softened his voice and told him to let it go.</p><p> </p><p>And so Remus went abroad again, unable to stay in England while the world remained in shambles and the wizards of Europe pretended everything was suddenly fixed. Remus worked on Wizarding and half-bread relations knowing that when everything was broken and being repaired was the best time to gain freedom in rewrites of laws and such. He remained traveling for several years, but he marked a day in his calendar, the day James and Lily’s son would start his first day at Hogwarts, he planned to return to England on that day.</p><p> </p><p>oooOOOoo </p><p> </p><p>In a grimy stone block, caged by rusted bars and guarded by his very nightmares, 21 year old Sirius Black rammed his fist into his mouth to muffle his cries, regret and guilt falling down his cheeks, he had lost everything, his best friend, His godchild, Lily... Remus, god Remus, Remus though he had killed James, murder Lily and Harry. Another sob left him and the thought stung enough that it pierced through the numb sadness that filled him as soon as he had been chucked into the hellhole he was to call home.</p><p> </p><p>Peter. How could he have not known, hatred filled him at the name yet he couldn’t make it stay long, not like after he had tracked him down, not like when Peter blew up the street, cause for sure he had been laughing with pure hatred in that moment but now, when it had finally sunk in he felt a great swell of pain too, because… Peter had been their friend, and now they were all gone, because he had convinced James to choose Peter instead. Sirius had killed the Potters, and so when no trial had waited him but the cold bars of his cell, he made no fuss, he knew he was guilty, just like Peter... if not more.</p><p> </p><p>oooOOOooo</p><p> </p><p>Howells came from a small man crouched against his knees in the sewer but it was not due to the loss of a finger that he cried, he cried for the loss of everything he had known and any love he had ever been given, the look in Sirius’s eye when he had hunted him would haunt his dreams for years to come, not because of the rage in his snarl, but the wild anguish in his eyes, his betrayal reflected back at him. Sirius had convinced James to choose Peter, Peter let out another cry, Sirius would never forgive himself, and neither would Peter.</p><p> </p><p>He looked to his missing finger and couldn’t help but agree with the sorting hat in that moment, he would have fit in with Slytherin, it was a cunning thing to do, fake his own death even at the expense of his finger, yet he did not believe he ever belonged in Slytherin, but then where did he belong, certainly not Gryffindor, house of the Chivalrous and Brave, his mind flashed to the terror he had begin to feel shocking inside and drowning him whole, for a few year now, his friends and the darkened abyss of Fear had been all he had known, now it was just the fear. </p><p> </p><p>No, he didn’t belong in Gryffindor anymore, but he had once, and it was memories of his nerve to nick Professor McGonagall’s master key, memories of his daring to climb on top of the Gryffindor tower to fasten a broomhandle to the top, so Sirius could declare Gryffindor’s tower the tallest tower, memories of himself gathering the courage to ask Mary Macdonald to dance at the Halloween party, those memories gave him the strength to transform into the animal that had helped his closest friend during times of the month Remus knew nothing but pain, he gathered his memories of a better time and a better self and he scuttled away, hiding from the shame of his actions.</p><p> </p><p>oooOOOooo</p><p> </p><p>A chuckle came from a man with wilting, stained hair that would once have been an electric white. Far away in Nurmengard, an old Wizard whispered his final spell and watched in fascination as his effort over years came to light, the strange few objects placed strategically in the room resembles the shape of an hourglass and as the words were whispered, the magic glowed bright blue and slowly the symbol drained the life from the once powerful wizard.</p><p> </p><p>A ministry official announced the death of Gellert Grindelwald and the world rejoiced as two dark wizards had left the world, what the others did not know, was that across the lake that surrounded the heavily guarded prison, a sister symbol glowed and the life force from Gellert Grindelwald drained into a shadow which slowly begin to resemble the man the papers remembered, white hair once again dancing with magic. <em>Oh, he had much to do.</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>
