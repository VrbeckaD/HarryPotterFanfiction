Alright…Aloycious?”</p><p>“Piss off.”</p><p>“Hey, I’m just trying to help.”</p><p>“Really, James, so please cite an example in my life that would make you think I would ever <em>want </em>to be called <em>Aloycious</em>.”</p><p>Sirius jerked his head up from a book with a start and a snort, looked around, and groaned. “My god, Moony, I love you and support you in all you do, but just pick a damn name, okay? We’ve been here for <em>hours. </em>Call yourself Wolfy or Were-Mark or something but for the love of my stomach, please do it soon.”</p><p>“What about Godric?”</p><p>“Uh, thanks, Peter, but I feel that’s a little…ambitious of me?”</p><p>“Holy shit, call yourself Dracula, please, just for the dramatic irony. Vampire by day,” James held up his hand to frame an imaginary headline, “Wolfman by night.”</p><p>“I’m about to ban you from this library under charges of being criminally unhelpful, Potter.”</p><p>“Hooold on,” Sirius propped up his chin and squinted into space. “Who <em>was</em> that wolf-guy from history? Rambles? Rectum?”</p><p>“Yep, it was definitely Rectum, Sirius, thanks, you can go join James in the Dormitory <em>away from here.”</em></p><p>Peter furrowed his brow over the top of his book at Sirius, “Yeah, it was that guy. Rumpus?” </p><p>“Puh-LEASE let your new name be Rumpus, Moony.”</p><p>“I’m literally about to hex you right now, Prongs.”</p><p>“Romulus!” Peter exclaimed triumphantly, brandishing his finger at Sirius, who blinked in sleepy surprise.  “That was it!”</p><p>“Yeah! Romulus Lupin! I love it! All sorts of punny–-Wolfy McWolf-man!” James clapped in genuine glee.</p><p>“I’m surrounded by assholes.”</p></div>
