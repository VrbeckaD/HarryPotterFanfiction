<p>Chapter One    </p>
<p>Hermione could tell you exactly where her life went wrong and surprisingly enough it wasn’t in the war with Voldemort not exactly. <br/>It all started a few years after Harry killed Voldemort. It started with a box full of the sands of time given to Harry from Kingsley to keep safe not that Hermione knew at the time , no he had kept it from her and Ron quite well. What she did see was eight  old Teddy and five year old James each with a hand on the box pulling it in different directions  yelling on the top of their voices.<br/>“ Give it here “ yelled Teddy.<br/>“No its mine “James screeched.<br/>Hermione had just grabbed the box trying to get it off the boys who  still had hold of it  when she felt a tugging on her navel and then all three were gone .</p>
<p>Hermione knew something wrong the instant they hit the floor. She instinctively grabbed the boys casting Protego  the shield charm as hard as she could which was a good thing because a moment later no less then four stunners ricocheted off the shield she looked up and gasped. Albus Dumbledore , Minerva McGonagall and Remus Lupin were firing spells at her , but that was impossible Dumbledore and Remus were both dead. As she held the shield charm she realised where they were in the Great Hall of Hogwarts<br/>How the hell had they gotten here? <br/>The shield charm wasn’t going to last them long .<br/>“ Teddy take James and go I’ll hold them off . “ <br/>“But “<br/>“Now Teddy!”She exclaimed face creased with concentration of holding the shield charm as spells kept coming towards them at a faster pace bouncing off the shield<br/>Then something strange happened  with a flash of gold the fake Dumbledore sent a Phoenix towards them it went straight through the shield charm  but instead of hurting her it nuzzled against her neck chirping softly.<br/>Hermione didn’t understand. For once she didn’t care all she cared about was that Teddy still hadn’t moved frozen to the spot  instead of running . Then suddenly the spells coming their way stopped. <br/> Dumbledore had a dumbfounded look on his  which turned into narrowed eyes, nobody spoke for a moment .<br/>“Who are you?” asked  Dumbledore .<br/>“ Who are you and why are you pretending to be Dumbledore “ Hermione asked briskly .<br/>“He is Dumbledore “ said Minerva said hotly.<br/>Hermione scoffed but didn’t say anything  her wand pointed to the fake Dumbledore .<br/>“I believe that is Time  “ said Dumbledore pointing a finger towards the box  and the dust coming out of it<br/>“ What do you me-“ Hermione froze suddenly understanding <br/>“ Oh God “ the words were out of her mouth before she could stop them <br/>“What year is it?”Hermione gasped <br/> “What do you mean it’s 2008 “said James <br/>“I’m afraid not I believe the year is  1993” said Dumbledore .<br/>“Is that bad ?”  asked James <br/>“ Really bad “  said Hermione her eyes on Dumbledore.<br/>“ Perhaps if we resume this conversation in my office”  said Dumbledore calmly setting Hermione teeth on edge .<br/>Hermione nodded grabbing the boys hands  and following him out of the great hall.<br/>They went slowly up the staircases .<br/>“ This is Hogwarts isn’t it ?”asked Teddy <br/>“ Yes” said Hermione shortly <br/>They reached the Headmasters office . They went in and Hermione stood as James and Teddy took a seat . <br/>“ Who are you ?” asked Dumbledore <br/>“Its me Hermione Granger and these are my nephews James Weasley and Teddy Weasley “ Hermione gave the boys credit they didn’t even turn a head at the change of name .<br/>“ I see “ said Dumbledore <br/>“ Is there any way you could prove this ? “ asked Dumbledore .<br/>“You gave me a time turner at the beginning of third year for my studies “ Hermione answered . <br/>“I will look out for a way to bring you to your correct time. “  said Dumbledore  however I must insist you stay at Hogwarts until then would you perhaps assist Professor Lupin teaching . <br/>“But the time line said Hermione quickly ,<br/>“ That you have already changed and nothing can remedy that”.<br/>“But the boys “Hermione protested <br/>“ Minerva will keep an eye on them ,they will never be alone . Dumbledore said calmly . <br/>“This is going to suck “groaned James.<br/>“ Professor Lupin you don’t mean -said Teddy  turning white “ <br/>Hermione nodded in confirmation . Teddy burst into tears . Without a word Hermione scooped up Teddy and held him close .<br/>“Can we have a moment “ She asked  ignoring Dumbledore disappointed look.<br/>“ Its ok Teddy” .she hushed knowing the portraits were watching there every move .<br/>“ What do we now Aunt  Hermione “ asked  James as Teddy wept on her shoulder . <br/>“ I don’t know . Don’t tell anyone about the future , take it one day at a time  keep as far away from the Weasleys and tell no one who your father is  his life depends on it said Hermione slowly .  <br/>James nodded eyes wide with confusion  .<br/>“ Can I tell him “whispered Teddy. Hermione hesitated heart sinking as she knew he was referring to Remus . “ No , not yet anyway “ said Hermione as Teddy whimpered . <br/>“I want Gran “ said Teddy in a small voice <br/>“She doesn’t know you exist yet . “ Hermione pointed out holding him close as he sobbed.</p>
<p>“Come on let’s find out where we are sleeping “ said Hermione calmly as Teddy Suddenly stopped  crying and whispered “ That means Moms alive  doesn’t it “ Hermione eyes widened she hadn’t even considered Tonks . But she nodded her head anyway as they left the office . <br/>They had a room on the first floor near the transfiguration rooms as soon as Albus led them into them and closed the door behind them Hermione let out a sigh  of relief. As she showed them there bedroom they would be sharing . <br/>Hermione said “ Goodnight you’re going to have a big day tomorrow and we will get home I promise . “ <br/>“Mum always reads us a story “ said James unexpectedly . Hermione hesitated she wasn’t good with children.<br/>“I’ll tell you a story about two young boys who saved a girl from a troll” Hermione started recounted with a smile .<br/>“Was it big “ <br/>“It was huge said Hermione with a smile .<br/>“As big as me ‘’ asked Teddy wide eyed  <br/>Hermione laughed as she continued her tale she noticed they were fast asleep.<br/>Leaving Hermione slid herself into her room . Not noticing the cat that had heard every word  . <br/> Minerva McGonagall  went to straight to Dumbledore <br/>“ There s no doubt about it that’s Hermione Granger”.  she told him.<br/>“Interesting” was all she got in reply .</p>
