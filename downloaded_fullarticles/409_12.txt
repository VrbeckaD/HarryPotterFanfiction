    <p>You had a rather lovely upbringing, a mum, pop, and a grumpy fluff ball of a cat fittingly named Mrs. Grumps. Pop worked in the mines and mum was a nurse. Even though they worked long hours you were spoiled with love. A lot more than the people on your block. Your neighborhood was tough, but you were protected and it taught you how to defend yourself.</p><p>Then you found out that you were a witch. Your family was so proud. You were so excited. Life was great.</p><p>Things changed after they died.</p><p>It happened because you made a mistake on your first day of school. You were just like the other first years, brimming with excitement and clutching your new wand tight to your chest as you boarded the train.</p><p>Every first-year you encountered shared your enthusiasm. You spent the whole time discussing future plans and having a nice (if shy) boy named Regulus ask to hide from his apparently awful older brother in your empty train compartment. He immediately began to boast about his family’s house (excluding his brother who was apparently a complete dunce and was foolishly sorted in the horrendous Gryffindor house). Slytherin sounded so wonderful and important that you hoped you would be able to join him and his apparently influential family.</p><p>When you were placed onto a long line of first years, after being mesmerized by the sheer grandiosity of the castle, you felt like you were in a dream. You couldn't wait to tell your parents, wanting so badly to share this great new world with them.</p><p>When your name was called and you walked to the talking hat (something you never would have imagined being feasible) you felt no fear. When it proudly called out Slytherin, it was as if nothing would ever go wrong. </p><p>You never felt so special, so hopeful, so <em>happy</em>.</p><p>The reception from the upper classmates was noticeably more muted than the other houses as you ran to the table but that wasn’t too much cause for concern. It was probably due to the whole Slytherin motto of being cunning and ambitious, words you didn’t really comprehend but felt so proud to identify with. You wanted to sit next to Regulus but he was already surrounded by scary-looking upperclassmen that you would become much too acquainted with. However, nothing could dampen your spirits as you quickly find your place next to the other wide-eyed first years.</p><p>When it was all settled you got to meet your future tormentors. Malfoy, who reminded you of the cruel neighborhood kids despite his cordial charm. Similarly, his already claimed future wife Narcissa gave an insincere smile to the new students, her beautiful doll-like face barely hiding her disinterest. Avery and Wilkes gave the students ‘friendly’ warnings. And finally, but most importantly in your tale, you saw Bellatrix. She was sitting beside Malfoy and his crowd of upperclassmen. She was a fifth-year who, while having a similar beautiful doll-like face to her younger sister, had a look in her eye and hardness in her smile that made her look a bit <em>intimidating</em>, to say the least. You would quickly find out that the bint was as crazy as the wild mass of hair on her head.</p><p>That's when things shifted. The upper classmates questioned you all, one by one, under the guise of being a means of ‘proper introduction to the house'. Malfoy leads it, all smooth charm in his pointed question on your upbringings. One by one you watched and understood that something was <em>off</em>. Students from wizarding families received smiles and half-bloods received a duller fair. Muggle-borns were met with outright dismissal. When it was your turn, you were the second one in your year to admit to muggle heritage. You didn’t know why that was the wrong answer but seeing the visible disdain from your peers, you felt unease coil in your belly. Bellatrix's beautiful face curdled as she wondered aloud how two ‘filthy mudbloods’ were ever allowed into the house, much to the loud amusement of your housemates. Your reaction was on instinct, back home you knew you had to act quickly when insulted in order to not be marked as weak and easy for the picking.</p><p>So, you punched her in her fat mouth.</p><p>The table became deadly silent.</p><p>The other houses chatted in the background, most of them oblivious to what occurred, however, it felt as if all you could hear was the bated breath of your peers.</p><p>You looked around for understanding, something was <em>wrong</em>. The older classmates looked on with either horror or thirsty anticipation. The other first-years quickly shared your apprehension, averting their eyes to their plates. A few students from Gryffindor, who you would later find out to your chagrin was led by Sirius Black, watched and laughed.</p><p>What was wrong?</p><p>You felt like crying, you felt like asking, but when you met the crazed eyes of Bellatrix staring at you with an intensity that still makes you shiver, you felt like hiding. It felt as if you were looking into the eyes of death itself claiming you as its next victim.</p><p>You realized you made a big mistake. What you didn’t realize at the time that it was a fatal one, not for you of course. Bella had better plans for you.</p><p>Then as quick as lightning, her face scrunched up with rage you didn’t know was possible as she <em>lunged</em> at you. People took notice then, however, Malfoy was quick to collect the foaming witch with a calmness that didn't feel appropriate.</p><p>“Now, now Bella she doesn’t know her place yet” his voice was so smooth and sure. Even the hair on his head remained in place.</p><p>You swallowed thickly, unable to really process what had occurred.</p><p>She was still reaching out for the kill but whatever Malfoy whispered in her ear made her pause. The smile she sent did <em> nothing </em>to settle your nerves.</p><p>“No, not yet,” she agreed, her voice like jagged knives.</p><p>She spent the rest of the dinner fidgeting like it took all her efforts not to jam the fork in her hand into your eyes. Maybe, that was the case. Probably was.</p><p>No other first-year came out as a mudblood after that. No other first-year looked in your direction after that for quite some time. Regulus gave you a pitying glance before chatting with his family.</p><p>You spent the rest of the dinner staring at your plate holding back shameful tears and wanting to go home. Not understanding the gravity of what had occurred but <em>knowing</em> you had to go home. You decided that being a wizard wasn’t what it was cracked up to be and you would rather deal with regular fistfights with your sane muggle peers than deal with these wackos.</p><p>That night was one of the scariest nights you could ever remember in your short 11 years of living. The threats, direct and indirect, you received startled you, to say the least. The upperclassmen watched you with greedy anticipation, taunting you as they gossiped amongst themselves about what your fate will be. And Bellatrix, Bellatrix’s cold fevered eyes never left your figure. It was as if she was breathing down your next from across the room.</p><p>When you found out about the jobs of prefects that first night you thought maybe you could ask Malfoy and Kellgrave for help. She at least looked on with concern but Malfoy looked at you as if you were nothing more than roadkill, with fake politeness that made you grit your teeth in frustration.</p><p>The next morning you awoke needing to go to the medical wing. Pomfrey, an utter dear, tried to get you to confess to Slughorn who inflicted such advanced hexes on a first-year. However you kept your trap shut, you didn’t need any more ammunition against you.</p><p>The first-years were wary to approach you after that. Even your fellow roommates refused to speak more than a few words to you, afraid word would get out they were fraternizing with the enemy. The first day of school and you already had a target on your back. Bellatrix was out for blood and the other Slytherins followed by example. Snakes were loyal to other snakes but you weren’t a snake anymore. That was quick to figure out.</p><p>Slughorn acted sympathetically but did squat. The other professors took points away if they saw the torture. It was quite the topic of discussion, even the professors and Dumbledore knew about it when he talked to you because of 'worrying gossip', but you figured snitching would only exacerbate the problem. The other houses were wary to notice to you, thinking only a loon would attack Bellatrix like that.</p><p>That week barely anyone spoke to you if not to threaten or hex you. The only ones who seemed to have any feeling of camaraderie with you were Sirius Black and a few Gryffindors who loudly congratulated you. Which of course caused you to go into the medical wing twice that day by Bellatrix’s wand.</p><p>You were a first-year, you didn’t know the true consequences of what would happen. You were shocked by the total ostracism from your house but figured you could suck it up. You did expect some retaliation and the hexes were something you were able to handle. Unaccustomed to, sure, but people responding to a hurt pride with violence was a common occurrence back on your block.</p><p>However, back at home, a split lip would just result in a fistfight.</p><p>Not your entire family being murdered.</p><p>
