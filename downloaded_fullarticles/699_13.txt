    <p>This will not have a consistent posting schedule as it is not too important to the "Lord Weitko" base plot. It is basically James' childhood, and the memories he has forgotten- a background for those who want it. I will be writing and posting chapters for this between "Refuge" and "Hallowed Woods," so don't expect constant updates.</p><p>Some memories and lines appear in "<a title="Refuge" href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/22029487/chapters/52574059" rel="nofollow">Refuge</a>," and "Hallowed Woods."</p><p>Title drawn from the quote: "<em>It's ironic how we often forget the things worth remembering, but we remember the things worth forgetting,</em>" (?)</p>
