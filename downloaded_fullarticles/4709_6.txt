“I’m Not Dead” – P!nk</p><p>**</p><p>“Stark… Stark, you need to get up.”</p><p>++</p><p>He was tired. So fucking tired.</p><p>He was tired of getting back up, he was tired of fighting, he was tired of constantly--<i>constantly</i>--putting himself out there, of giving <i>everything</i> of himself to so-called team, to the world, that wasn’t willing to give anything back. He’d been drained dry long ago, had dug down to the dregs of his soul to even get this fair—but he was made of brittle iron and rust and there was nothing left of himself to give.</p><p>
  <i>He was tired.</i>
</p><p>The exhaustion ran soul-deep, bone-deep, tired in body and mind and heart: a heart that was already damaged beyond complete repair, broken but still so willing to keep on beating if it meant that others could be saved.</p><p>--the heart that finally broke, though, the moment that Rogers (<i>friend friend – never a friend</i>) admitted his soul-crushing truth. The heart had already taken one too many hits from the first time that he could remember; at some point, he figured… what was the point of piecing it back together again?</p><p>He was an engineer. An inventor. A fixer of things.</p><p>But eventually he had learned that there was always a point where you threw in the towel.</p><p>He was done.</p><p>He was tired.</p><p>He didn’t want to open his eyes anymore.</p><p>++</p><p>The cold was an encompassing sort of force, unrelenting and unforgiving. </p><p>Things came to Tony in bits and pieces: he could remember the clang of metal on concrete as Rogers dropped his shield, giving up the title of Captain America for his friend (<i>not me not me – one more abandonment to accept and protect myself against</i>); he could remember watching his breath turn to a misty sort of fog, silver-tinged bubble surrounding his mouth with each and every exhale; he could remember the whine of an engine starting, the roar of its take off, the dark, bitter thought, “Fucker left me behind in a dead suit.”; he could remember watching as his blood iced over, droplets hardening into stalactites that never quite reached the floor below.</p><p>He remembered how his skin burned as warm breath fanned over lips and chin and cheeks.</p><p>He remembered how the metal of his suit slowly became his metal coffin as night slipped closer and closer, horizon darkening into shades of twilight, purple tinging the sky like a weeks-old bruise.</p><p>He remembered trying to get up, trying to fight one last time: remembered his left arm giving out beneath him as the injuries Wanda dealt him at the airport in Germany finally brought themselves to his attention with adrenaline leaving his body hours before.</p><p>He remembered pain, remembered agony.</p><p>He remembered the knife-to-the-ribs feeling of betrayal.</p><p>(<i>You were supposed to be family, just like Obie. Why is it that family always hurts you the most?</i>)</p><p>He remembered the rage-filled screams, the foul curses that echoed within the open-air bunker.</p><p>More than anything, though, he remembered the exhaustion.</p><p>He remembered giving up.</p><p>++</p><p>“Stark. I’m sorry, but I can’t let you go.”</p><p>++</p><p>The suit was dead.</p><p>The arc reactor had been too cleanly sliced in half—there was no way to revive it, to reconnect circuits, to jump start it in any way to call out for help to FRIDAY or the Vision. Moreso than that, however, the suit was dead weight. Thousands of pounds of metal—his engineering contribution to the world—pressed down upon already painful and previously gained injuries. There was no way to get the full leverage needed to manually begin releasing the locks that were scattered all over the suit.</p><p>Even besides that, this particular Mark had been designed with the idea that there would always been a teammate near to get him free. It was a sign of trust that had originally made him hesitate in incorporating into the design, something fearful and buried deep within him begging him to <i>not</i> put in the weakness—but trust was a heady drug, muddling his thoughts more thoroughly than any ounce of alcohol had ever done. So he had ignored that voice of caution, of distrust, and had ordered FRIDAY to go ahead with the design.</p><p>He should have known better.</p><p>(<i>Family always hurts you.</i>)</p><p>He was going to die in the suit, skin frozen to the metal innards, frostbite turning fingers and toes and nose black and dead long before his heart stopped beating: he was already lying in his coffin, half delirious with grief and pain and the desire to sleep and never open his eyes again: to forget, to let go, to finally refuse to be held <i>accountable</i> because what was the point if all that ever happened was that he was punished for it, actions past, present, and future always held against him?</p><p>
  <i>Iron Man – yes; Tony Stark – not recommended.</i>
</p><p>Here, now, in this metal coffin of his:</p><p>
  <i>He was Iron Man.</i>
</p><p>++</p><p>“<i>Stark, open your eyes!</i> You’re still needed.”</p><p>++</p><p>He remembered closing his eyes, hoping that it would be the last time he did so.</p><p>He remembered wanting to die.</p><p>(<i>Just let me sleep, darkness washing over until all that’s left is oblivion. I don’t fucking care anymore.</i>)</p><p>++</p><p>“<b>WAKE UP!</b>”</p><p>++</p><p>The cold was always the first thing that Tony noticed, and—this time—there was no difference in that, as well. The cold burned and numbed and made the air hard to breathe. Distantly, thoughts sluggish and almost outside of his own mind, the engineer wished that the cold had frozen his lungs, stopping the rise and fall of his chest: it would have been peaceful, a gentler sort of death than he was previously guaranteed.</p><p>Everything hurt.</p><p>The feeling of helplessness, of betrayal, and loss swept over him then, reminding the dark-eyed man of the tsunami of grief that he had managed to hold at bay off and on as the hours—days? had it been days yet?—trickled on by, whiling into a numb sort of nothingness that echoed with the depression that had grayed out his soul in December 1991.</p><p>There was no point in choking back the sob or the tears that followed, thick enough to collect in the silver-touched hair at Tony’s temples, icing over almost immediately until scalp and cheeks stung from the heat of his tears and then, eventually, went numb and glistening-wet, icing to freeze away the last portions of himself that still <i>cared</i>.</p><p>“I’m sorry. I’m so sorry,” a voice murmured from above even as fingers gently sifted through the engineer’s hair, breaking apart the ice to cup over the back of Tony’s head. “I’m sorry, but you can’t go just yet. You’re still needed.”</p><p>The effort was a Herculean one, almost impossible as it stood before him, but Tony slowly managed to open his eyes to meet a bright green gaze above him, framed by thick, ugly glasses frames, and a riot of ebon-dark hair. The inventor had almost immediately thought of Loki—Loki had somehow managed to track him down, had cornered Tony while he was vulnerable and hurting—but the understanding, careful kindness in those forest-bright eyes was nothing like what Tony remembered seeing from the demi-god.</p><p>His breath shuddered out, catching in his chest--<i>he was so cold</i>--and that gentle hand tightened in warning against his scalp.</p><p>“It’s hard, I know. <i>I know.</i> It feels like a relief, like absolution—like a weight has been shifted from your shoulders because it’s no longer up to you. It’s become someone else’s problem, someone else’s responsibility. But I can’t let you go yet. It’s not your time; this isn’t where you’re supposed to die. And I’m sorry—I’m so sorry, I understand, it’s hard, it’s so bloody hard, <i>I know</i>—but you need to get up. You need to fight again. You’re needed and necessary, Tony Stark: both for your loved ones and for this world.”</p><p>“…I can’t…” Tony whispered, eyes closing beneath furrowed brows, <i>hating</i> this stranger for the words that he was speaking.</p><p>“<i>You must</i>,” the dark-haired man ordered, voice gentle and implacably cruel in its refusal to allow Tony to—let go. To stop. The words felt like electricity over his skin, down the engineer’s spine: sharp and biting, and Tony inhaled in a gasp as his eyes shot open once again. Voice gentler than previous, the stranger repeated: “You must, Tony Stark.”</p><p>“Why…? Why won’t you let me…?” the older man gasped out, words hitching as they rose, rougher than a raven’s cry, from his throat. “I just. I just want… <i>Let me</i>--“</p><p>The kindness was encompassing now, a mother’s soothing touch or the warm kiss of the sun upon a face, and the smile that was offered to Tony was crooked, lopsided and flavored with self-directed derision. “Because I’m the Master of Death, and I say <i>no</i>. Because if you die here and now, give up and close your eyes and never open them again, so too does the universe. You know what’s coming. I know you’re tired; I know that you wish someone else would pick up the responsibilities that you’ve been carrying for so long—but you’re still the linchpin in the fight ahead. You’re still needed.”</p><p>“Not fair,” Tony whispered, expression screwing up, tightening against the fight <i>not to cry</i>.</p><p>“I know it’s not. But neither life nor death are fair, and I’m denying you entry to one. It’s time to get up, Tony.”</p><p>It was so hard to dig down, to find whatever strength he had left: so little remaining, practically nothing—just a handful of dirt and sand that tasted of Afghanistan against the back of his throat. The hourglass had finally run out; how was he expected to give even more after this…?</p><p>There was <i>nothing</i>.</p><p><i>He</i> was nothing.</p><p>But Tony still gathered together what little strength—what little courage, determination, fortitude—that remained after this latest betrayal, and took a shuddering breath before once more opening his dark gaze. “If you’re expecting me to get up, you’re going to have to help get me out of this suit,” he rasped, voice trembling and skirting the edge of broken—but steadier, too, with each and every word.</p><p>“I can do that,” the stranger agreed, eyes so very, very kind, and Tony hated him for that understanding.</p><p>--<i>It’s the least that I could do</i>, went unsaid but still understood between the two men.—</p><p>“So what’s your name?” the engineer asked as they both worked on flipping the releases that would finally allow the suit to uncurl from around him, withdrawing like a caterpillar’s cocoon and allowing Tony to <i>breathe</i> again, freezing and broken and human but no longer <i>Iron Man</i>, and perhaps that was the important thing right now to remember.</p><p>“Harry. Just Harry,” the green-eyed man answered as the last release snapped into place, allowing Tony to pull himself up and out of the suit; the inventor turned to offer up a comment to ‘Harry. Just Harry.,’ though anything he might have said stilled upon his tongue as he saw that there was nobody else there. Tony was alone.</p><p>He covered his face and gave a broken little laugh, ugly and harsh and still filled with so much rage and hate—then staggered upright (<i>because he was an engineer before anything else and things still needed fixing</i>) and went in search of pieces of machinery he could cobble together to create some sort of radio to send out an SOS signal to either FRIDAY or the Vision.</p><p>(The memory of that green gaze still followed him, haunting and knowing.)</p><p>::fin::</p></div>
