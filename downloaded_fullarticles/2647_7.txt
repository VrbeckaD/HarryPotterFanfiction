    <p><br/>
Sirius was never the sort of baby that could sneeze and float a foot off the ground. He couldn’t levitate objects or slam doors with his mind, and he certainly couldn’t cast actual spells. His parents, for the longest time, worried he might be a Squibb, and he had countless tests done to reinforce the fact that there was <em>no need</em> for the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black to disown a child at four years of age.<br/>
<br/>
Growing up, Sirius couldn’t care less about magic. He liked actually making things, then destroying them and putting them back together. Working with his hands, and with his brain. Sirius liked logic.<br/>
He knew he wasn’t good at magic, because he forced himself to repress it. He knew that an outburst of magic - especially an outburst of <em>his</em> magic, when he had the views and regards to his family that he did, could only mean danger. So he never let any magic come out. And now it seemed he’d pushed it down so far, that Hogwarts didn’t believe he was a wizard.<br/>
<br/>
He turned eleven on the third of November 1970, but did not receive any kind of letter then. In fact, he went through almost a whole year of torment as family after family would send letters by owl of their children's acceptances, and their delight at the news. His parents were losing patience, and he was receiving the brunt of the frustration, no matter how many times he begged for them to see it wasn’t his fault, when he knew deep down it was.<br/>
<br/>On the 30th of July, when Sirius’ things had already been packed for him to leave the house and never return, there was a sharp rap at the window of Grimmauld Place, and Sirius received his acceptance letter, with tears in his eyes. <em>It meant he had to stay.</em><br/>

</p>
<p>Sirius is guided through the busy wizarding streets to Diagon Alley. Although he’d shopped here many a time with his mother or cousins, it had never been so much about him until this day. Walburga’s hand tightens on his shoulder as he’s steered closer to the education and board sector of the shops, and he can’t help but to grin at the amount of wide-eyed children, his age, running in and out of shops, bags upon bags of supplies and new pets tentatively following their owners. Three boys holding cones of ice-cream dart across the road in front of him and his mother, and disappear inside the doorway of <em>Gambol and Japes Wizarding Joke Shop.</em> Sirius blows out a breath through his front teeth, and wonders what the inside might look like. They are just rounding the corner of the alley when a flash goes off, followed by a rather loud, apologetic ‘Sorry! Sorry!’ And a tall man in socks and sandals with a t-shirt that reads ‘Niffler? I hardly know her!’ in a glaring font puts away a blocky muggle-camera and ushers an embarrassed-looking ginger girl into the dimly lit second-hand broom shop.<br/>
<br/>
‘Mudbloods.’ Sirius’ mother mutters, like venom on her lips. ‘Treating our culture like some kind of amusement park. One of these days someone will stand up to that daft headmasters’ whims and put them back in their place.’<br/>
<br/>
It was an empty threat, and Sirius shrugged the comment off, his mother often repeated the same sentiments on loop.<br/>
<br/>
After another change of direction, Walburga calmly enters <em>Twilfitt and Tattings</em> which, from Sirius’ memory served only as a place for him to stare at the ceiling whilst his mother bossed about the shop assistants.<br/>
<br/>
A little bell rings as the door shuts, and a woman whose name tag is obscured by what appears to be taxidermied peacock head fashioned into a brooch rushes over to greet them.<br/>
<br/>
‘Walburga, <em>my dear</em>,’ she coons, and Sirius scrunches up his nose. He already knows this woman’s preening is going to get her nowhere. ‘We’ve the fall line in - yes, I know it’s only summer, but I thought you’d like a look first - of course a discount is no question - we simply admire your loyalty -’ She begins rambling, and Sirius knows his mother must hate her.<br/>
<br/>
‘Actually, I’m here to have my first born’s robes fitted.’ She says, without emotion. ‘I understand you’re not in the habit of fitting children, but as I’m such a loyal -’<br/>
<br/>
The woman was cutting her off before she could even finish her second. ‘It’s not a problem at all!’ She grins, far too chipper. ‘Here at Twilfitt and Tattings we’d be proud to fit the Black family school robes! Why, we were just having the same conversation with Euphemia Potter, perhaps your boy and the young Mister James could get to know one another whilst I fish out the fabric bolts? I presume you want Egyptian silk for the lining?’<br/>
<br/>
Sirius had never heard his mother cut off in conversation before, except by maybe his father, and he had certainly never heard of her letting the other person get away with it.<br/>
<br/>
‘Yes.’ She said, simply. ‘Go on through, Sirius. Your Great-Aunt Dorea married a Potter. They are well regarded in our circles.’ She muttered the last bit through her front teeth, but Sirius didn’t seem to mind, as he pushed through a heavy velvet curtain to reveal a large fitting room with three pedestals and seating at the side. </p>
<p><br/>
</p>
<p>On the far left, a young boy with a mop of messy, dark hair seemed to wander aimlessly, his eyes transfixed on the ceiling, his head bent as far back as it would go. He was blowing some kind of enchanted bubblegum, that changed colours with each pop. Walburga tutted at the misbehaviour, and rolled her eyes, before grinning widely, and stretching her arms out towards a woman in her fifties, who was sat in the corner, reading titled Pride and Prejudice.<br/>
<br/>
‘Euphemia, <em>my dear!</em>’ She mimicked the shop assistant’s sickly sweet tone, and Sirius knew that this was a business conversation, not  a personal one.<br/>
<br/>
‘Walburga Black!’ Euphemia put her book aside, and stood up to greet his mother. They each seemed to settle with holding the other’s elbows in a weird-far-away-hug whilst air kissing each cheek. ‘Gosh, Your Sirius has grown ever so much!’<br/>
<br/>
‘I expect he’ll stop soon enough. I suppose the first born is always the hardest because you’re going into parenting blind. At least it’ll be easier to work out with our - sorry - <em>my</em> next one.’ Euphemia made a face Sirius couldn’t deduce. ‘Tell me, <em>will</em> you be having any more?’<br/>
<br/>
‘I always wanted two boys,’ Said the other woman kindly, ‘but I suppose we’ll see.’ Sirius stared at them for a few moments longer, before turning to find the aforementioned Potter boy breathing down his neck.<br/>
<br/>
‘Wotcher!’ He laughed, grinning a big, toothy grin. Sirius noticed his front incisors were slightly larger that the rest of his teeth, and he wondered why no one had given him a corrective charm. ‘I’m James Potter.’ He said. ‘Is this your first year at Hogwarts too?’<br/>
<br/>
Sirius opened his mouth to speak, when <em>Taxidermied Peacock Lady</em> came butling in, with two doe-eyed assistants at her call. For a while, the boys did not speak, and instead just nodded polite ‘yes ma’am’ and ‘no ma’am’s’ to the seamstresses. Sirius was having his winter formal robes fitted in a deep ivy coloured silk, and James’ cuffs were being resized, when the women ran out of pins, and disappeared off to find some more, as well as <em>‘The perfect pocket square, Master Potter! It should be mustard, with embroidered roses!’</em> and the boys were left alone again.<br/>
<br/>
‘What was your name again? Something Black? What did you say?’<br/>
<br/>
‘I didn’t?’ Sirius replied. ‘My name is Sirius Black. The Third’<br/>
<br/>
‘Sirius is a funny name.’<br/>
<br/>
‘It’s an old name. It’s a constellation. That’s why my parents named me it. Why’d your parents name you James?’<br/>
<br/>
The boy screwed up his face for a moment, thinking. ‘I dunno? I guess they just liked the name.’ Sirius wondered whether this boy really was a pureblood or not.<br/>
<br/>
‘When did you get your letter?’ he asked, bluntly, suspicious.<br/>
<br/>
‘Oh! I got mine last Christmas! It was well funny - Olinone - that’s our family owl, he’s named after some muggle hair product my dad’s mad about - anyway, he comes crashing down the chimney in the middle of the night, and we all run to see what’s happening, and there he is; tangled in christmas lights, having knocked the tree over, and letter <em>still</em> in his mouth! I must admit, he’s a right klutz, but he gets the job done!’ Sirius couldn’t help but snigger at the story.<br/>
<br/>
‘That sounds highly unlikely.’<br/>
<br/>
‘No! I swear it’s true! I solemnly swear!’<br/>
<br/>
‘You don’t sound very solemn.’<br/>
<br/>
James laughed at that. Like he was an eleven year old boy who could afford to. ‘Yeah, well you sound way too solemn! Want to be my friend?’<br/>
<br/>
Sirius raised his eyebrow at this question. He had never been asked to be someone's friend before. In fact, the only friend he had was his thumb-sucking nine year old brother.<br/>
<br/>
‘Perhaps.’ He said, sounding dignified. Almost like his father might. ‘What house will you be in. Mother said I should only mix with the right sort.’<br/>
<br/>
‘And what sort is that?’<br/>
<br/>
‘I don’t know. Pureblood’s, I suppose. People with lots of money and power.’<br/>
<br/>
‘And who do you <em>want</em> to mix with?’<br/>
<br/>
‘I don’t know. People who like me, I suppose. I just do what my mother tells me to.’<br/>
<br/>
James gives Sirius what he thinks is meant to be an empathetic look, but one glance over at Euphemia would certify that James truly had no idea what it was like living in the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black. No idea indeed.<br/>
<br/>
‘Gryffindor.’ James said.<br/>
<br/>
‘What?’<br/>
<br/>
‘I want to be in Gryffindor. It’s where my dad was put, and they’re super brave, and they have the best <em>mustard and rose embroidered pocket squares!’</em> James can’t help but to laugh at his joke, and it’s just so innocent, but Sirius just nods sadly.<br/>
<br/>
‘It’s a shame.’ He said. ‘I’m going to be a slytherin. It’s in the Black blood - but, if you’re missorted, I’d be glad to be your friend. Everyone knows Gryffindor and Slytherin are most definitely academic rivals, though that doesn't mean we can’t maintain an amicable acquaintance with each other for the future of our education.’<br/>
<br/>
James is quiet for a moment, before laughing even louder than before. Walburga turns and tuts dissaprovingly.<br/>
<br/>
<em>‘Contain your child.’</em> Sirius hears her say.<br/>
<br/>
‘What’s so funny?’ He asks, indignant.<br/>
<br/>
‘You just -’ James laughs again, ‘- You just talk so posh. I mean, my family are just as sacred as yours, but at least I get to talk like an actual child! You just sound stupid!’<br/>

<br/>Sirius was furious, and wondered whether this was the way his mother felt towards the whole world, constantly. ‘Well. It doesn't seem like you are so friendly after all.’ Sirius didn’t like bullies. He had enough of those in his life already. He turned his back on James, and tucked his hair neatly behind his ear, before continuing the rest of the fitting.<br/></p>
<p><br/>
</p>
<p>Sirius was buttoning up his outer-wear robe and tying his shoelaces as his mother paid for the <em>fifteen</em> sets of outfits he had been fitted, when he heard the familiar voice of that James on the other side of the thick curtain.<br/>
<br/>
<em>‘Well, how did you like him? Did you two become friends?’</em><br/>
<br/>
<em>‘I don’t think so, Mum. He’s a Black - and I’ve heard things -’</em><br/>
<br/>
<em>‘Was he cruel to you?’</em><br/>
<br/>
<em>‘Well, no -’</em><br/>
<br/>
<em>‘Then why would you judge him by his family name?’</em><br/>
<br/>
<em>‘I don’t -’</em><br/>
<br/>
<em>‘Why don’t you try again with him, at Hogwarts?’</em><br/>
<br/>
<em>‘Okay.’ </em>There was a long pause, and Sirius almost felt like leaving, save being scolded later due to his foot-dragging and general tardiness or some other nonsense, no doubt.<br/>
<br/>
<em>‘Mum?’</em><br/>
<br/>
<em>‘Yes?’</em><br/>
<br/>
<em>‘I think he’s just hurting.’</em></p>
