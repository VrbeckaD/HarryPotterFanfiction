    <p>A fourteen year old Draco Malfoy was on the train home for the summer. He was still unsure how to reacted to the idea that Lord Voldemort  is back, if its even true. He also can't believe a fellow student is dead, after all they are just kids. He sits by his fellow Slytherins and remains quiet for the duration of the trip. </p><p>Hours pass and the train comes to a halt at the station letting the young teens off onto the platform. Draco looks around for his mother and father and sees them immediately. After making sure he has all of his belongings the blonde male makes his way to his family. He is greeted with little more than a hug and a curt ‘hello son’. </p><p>The young teen follows his parents out of the station catching a view of Potter saying farewell to his friends. The blonde scoffs to himself more out of jealousy than anything. After they get to a safe enough place the three apparated back to the Malfoy manor. The youngest Malfoy goes to his room hoping to have little interaction with his family.</p><p>The young teen looks at over his homework and gets started on it hoping to finish a good part of it before dinner not wanting to deal with trying to do his school work at the last minute. Draco liked having everything to be perfect, especially his homework.</p><p>Draco is sitting at home. He no longer has anyone to talk with since Potter freed dobby. He finishes up his charms work and starts doing his potions school work. The young blonde stares at his work blankly not really doing it. The teen gets and heads down the the family room and overhears voices.</p><p>Draco opens the door ever so slightly and looks through the crack. He hold his breath in shock at what he sees. In the room he sees his father and mother with is crazy aunt Bellatrix. He also sees a unknown snake like man the towers over the others. </p><p>“I want that prophecy Malfoy and you better not fail me” the snake like man glares like he was staring at pry at his father with vivid red eyes.</p><p>“Of course my lord I won't fail you” the older malfoy bows deeply to the pale man. He doesn't once look at his face preferring the grown. </p><p>“I trust you won't or else” he smirks nastily looking to door as if he knew the youngest of the house was there. “Hello boy” he says “might as well come in young Draco” he says in a twisted sweet voice. </p><p>Draco makes his way into the room scared out his his mind but after years of hiding his emotions is able to but on a poker face. “...hello dark lord” he says looking into the others face unable to look away.</p><p>“From what your father has told me you are strong and will be a good addition to the death eaters boy” he says to Draco. The young teen looks down and nods. After a few more awkward minutes the dark lord leaves. Draco looks at his father who glares at him.</p><p>“Your lucky you didn't disgrace us Draco be more careful” he scolds the young teen “go back to you room don't bother us for the night” then looks away from his son.</p><p>“Yes father” Draco replies and walks to his room locking the door and finally let's the panic set in. Draco doesn't want to hurt anyone. He didn't want to be like his father. He wants to just be a normal child with caring parents. </p><p>The young teen thinks long and hard. If he wanted to be rid of his family and what that means then he needs to run away. Draco calls a house elf and told them to bring him food. When the elf does he orders it not to speak of this and hands them a naive blue hat. The said elf looks confused then smiles hugging the small teen. “All I ask is for you to bring be away from this place” </p><p>“Yes sir” the small elf chirps and smiles and waits for its ex master to finish packing and then poofs them to Hogwarts. The young Malfoy makes his way to the headmaster's room and hopes he would be there. </p><p>Draco stops at the gargolas, “password” it asks in a gravelly voice. Draco thinks hard on what the old wizard would use as a password.</p><p>“...Toffee?” He blindly guesses. The gargola that spoke laughs and shakes his head. </p><p>“No” he tells the teen, Draco keeps guessing at what the password would be but with no luck. “Why do you need to see the headmaster?” The gargola asks of the young teen. </p><p>“...the dark lord was at my house...and I need somewhere to be safe” the blonde answers hoping that the gargola will let him up. Much to his luck the gargola alouds him up. Draco makes his way up the stairs and looks at the oak door pausing before knocking. </p><p>“Enter!” An elderly but friendly voice calls out. Draco takes a deep breath and enters into the room. The old man is behind the desk and looks at the small teen confused. “Mister Malfoy what are you doing back at the school?” He asks</p><p>“Please sir I need somewhere safe to stay...he who must not be named is...was at my house...I don't want to be like my family...please save me” he asks...more likes begs the young teen looks and sounds scared.</p><p>“Of course Mister Malfoy, but you will need to have a charm to change your appearance” he tells the young boy. “I'll have flitwick work on that it shouldn't take long. After that I will but you on the care of you cousin at the Black Manor” the old man smiles and waves a hand inviting the young teen to sit. </p><p>“Thank you” Draco says giving out a sigh of relief. Glad that Dumbledore believed him, that he doesn't have to keep living in the hell of his home, that he will have a second chance to be himself not a facade he has to keep up to please his father.</p>
