    <p>He hadn’t changed the office much since his promotion. In his mind, he didn’t deserve it, nor want it. This was only a temporary position after all, soon Potter would off the Dark Lord... Somehow and he’d be dead, probably by the hand of an ally, and someone else could be Headmaster of Hogwarts. Or Mistress, he thought idly, thinking of Minerva McGonagall's cold hatred when they passed each other in the hallways.</p><p>Soon, he promised himself, soon it would all be over. </p><p>Until then he'd have to bear the disgust and disdain from his former colleagues, some of which he'd tentatively called friends. He'd have to carry on, pretending everything was dandy while the Carrows terrorized the students with all manner of punishment.  </p><p>Slowly, he exhaled and attempted to relax his shoulders. He rubbed a hand over his face, wondering if he looked as tired as he felt.  </p><p>Only a week into the school year and he already felt as if he was at the end of his rope. Behind him he could hear Dumbledore's portrait clear his throat.  </p><p>"You have visitors, my boy." The old headmaster said, not unkindly. </p><p>Snape nodded heavily and stood, squaring his shoulders to take full advantage of his height. He could already hear the angry voices of Amycus Carrow and Minerva McGonagall. His lips twitched slightly upward, somewhat grateful that Minerva seemed to be giving as good as she got. The two angry professors spilled out into the office and both turned to Snape.  </p><p>Amycus had an expression of barely suppressed glee on his pudgy little face. "Severus." He greeted with an impatient tone.</p><p>As always when he came face to face with the Head of Gryffindor her lips thinned as she pressed her mouth closed. Almost as if she was physically trying to withhold what she really wanted to say. Her eyes were cold as she stared at him and her fists clenched at her sides.  </p><p>"Amycus..." Snape greeted softly with a nod "and Minerva. What is it-This time?" He flicked his eyes from one to the other. McGonagall didn't react but Amycus visibly flinched under Snape's regard. </p><p>"She," the Death-Eater hissed, jabbing a finger at an offended looking McGonagall "refuses to accept my authority."  </p><p>"Authority?" McGonagall snapped angrily "You were publicly humiliating students!" </p><p>"Because they refused to obey! And as deputy Headmaster I can do as I please!" </p><p>Finally a flush made its way onto McGonagall's cheeks as she glowered at Amycus for pulling rank.</p><p>Snape took a deep breath and cut through whatever the head of Gryffindor was about to unleash upon the unsuspecting Carrow. "Minerva, it's time that you accept the new management of this school and the changes that brings with it." McGonagall abruptly turned back to him, as if she'd forgotten that he was there. She stared at him for a moment before she looked at a point over his shoulder. Dumbledore's portrait, probably.</p><p>For a second, Snape thought that she would let it go, that she knew the battle was lost. The look at the sleeping Dumbledore seemed to give her new hope, and instead she straightened and sent a piercing glare at Snape. To his consternation she seemed to be gearing up for round two. </p><p>"Headmaster," Snape thanked Merlin that one of the portraits interrupted what was about to become an even tenser situation. He turned to one of the previous Headmasters questioningly. "Bellatrix Lestrange is at the entrance... She has someone with her." </p><p>Just what he needed, he thought, Lestrange to join the party in his office. He suppressed a sigh and waved his hand in the direction of the Gargoyles and an amused cackle indicated the insane bitch was making her way up.</p><p>McGonagall paled and quickly took several steps back, closer to a wall. Clearly, she preferred to be facing the Death Eaters, as they outnumbered her three to one.</p><p>The expression on Amycus's face was a mix of excitement and trepidation. Everyone knew Bellatrix was like a loose cannon, generally amusing until it turned on you. </p><p>He could hear the sound of the steps turning, as they lifted Bella and whoever she had with her up towards the office. As they came closer he could hear a hollow thump and pained moaning. </p><p>"Ahh- Snape, I brought you a gift!" Bellatrix said, her tone airy and friendly as she breezed into the office. A hand securely wrapped around a mess of curly hair as she dragged a slight shape behind her. The girl stumbled over the last step and was almost hit by the door as Lestrange gave a sharp tug and her charge fell onto the hard floor with a whimper. She managed to bring up her arms before her head impacted with the floor. A few wisps of her long  curly hair touched the top of his polished black boots. He froze, staring at the curl for a few long moments and he felt oddly afraid to move his foot.</p><p>The office was deadly quiet as they all stared at the girl on the floor, her long dry hair covered most her head but there was something unmistakably familiar about her. </p><p>Bellatrix finally looked up from the girl cowering on the floor, an expression of absolute delight on her worn features. "Dear me," she said with a too-wide smile "If it isn't Professor McGonagall." She smirked. </p><p>Snape and McGonagall exchanged a quick glance, she looked as white as a sheet and her hands trembled by her side. The girl on the floor curled up on her side defensively and stilled with a whimper.</p><p>"Not the welcome I was expecting, truly." Bellatrix said sweetly. "I didn't interrupt, did I?" </p><p>Snape cleared his throat, finally "Certainly not," he said with a dismissive wave "we're done here. Minerva- Leave us." He ordered and pointed at the door.  </p><p>McGonagall looked from the girl on the floor up to him, her eyes were wide with indecision. "Minerva-" he repeated slowly "<em>leave</em>. I am certain your Gryffindors are waiting for you." </p><p>"Hmn." Bellatrix agreed with a high pitched giggle "This one certainly could have used your help..." She pushed at one of the girl's legs with the toe of her boot, her lips twisted in disgust. "She screamed so sweetly, but then all Mudbloods do." She smirked at McGonagall's horrified expression. Amycus's head swiveled so fast, looking between everyone in the office Snape started hoping his head would pop right off.</p><p>"Enough Bellatrix," Snape said, his voice was as quiet as a whisper "why are you here?" The urge to move his foot away from the girl crawled under his skin.</p><p>"As I said," she pouted "I bring you a gift. Clearly, I've been remiss in not trusting you-" she pointed around the office "I don't think I've had a chance to congratulate you." She looked around the office "For finally murdering the old coot, and your promotion, of course!" With a flourish she pointed at the girl on the floor, who'd gone still and who was bleeding if the smell of fresh blood was anything to go by. "I know how much you used to like Mudbloods." She trailed off with a wicked smile as she stared up at Snape "I thought you might like to show Granger her proper place." </p><p>Snape stiffened and immediately threw up every Occlumency shield he had to stop any kind of reaction from showing on his face. He ignored the sound that escaped McGonagall and he didn't dare to look in her direction, afraid of what he might see. </p><p>"Really Bella," he said calmly, sounding a little strangled to his own ears "you shouldn't have." </p><p>"Oh, but I insist." </p><p>"If you don't want her..." Amycus said with a peculiar expression of greed and lust on his face "I'll gladly take her." </p><p>Another sound from McGonagall's side went ignored. "That won't be necessary Amycus." Snape swiftly interjected.  </p><p>"So you do want her!" Bellatrix cackled with glee. "I knew you hadn't changed a bit from the good ol' days, eh?"</p><p>"Yes," Snape said, managing to get his voice and tone under control.  "you've made your point. Now leave, I do have a school to run." </p><p>"Of course, of course. A school to run..." Bellatrix threw her head back and laughed loudly. The sound grated against his ears and he fought to keep his face impassive. "Have fun-" the witch dragged out the last word and added a conspiratory wink. With a last kick to Hermione's unresponsive form she turned on her heels and marched out the door. </p><p>"Amycus," Snape stated coldly, snapping the Death Eater out of his observation of Hermione Granger "escort Professor McGonagall back to her office." </p><p>His deputy threw him a truly filthy grin "Of course, Headmaster I'll leave you to it. Come on then." He jerked his head in the direction of the door. </p><p>"Severus..." McGonagall stepped closer towards Hermione Granger, looking up at him imploringly. He merely returned her gaze impassively, all his senses aware of the unconscious girl at his feet.</p><p>"Leave, Minerva." He said neutrally "there is nothing you can do here."</p><p>He watched them leave, McGonagall throwing worried looks over her shoulder while Amycus had a joyful spring in his step as he berated the older woman.</p><p>When they were out of view Snape looked down, bent over and gently removed the hair from his boot. The curl stubbornly circled around his fingers and he tugged it softly. He reached out and pushed away the rest of her hair, uncovering her face. Indeed, skinnier perhaps, and bruised. But it was undoubtedly Hermione Granger.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>She woke up in a comfortable nest of blankets for the first time in what must have been a while. She frowned, scrunched her nose and blinked several times as the last vestiges of sleep left her. That's when her memories returned in sharp and painful details. </p><p>Bellatrix's voice as she shrieked Crucio... Over and over and then- she gasped and sat up, staring at her right arm. It was swaddled in bandages and there was a surprising lack of pain. She flexed her muscles, feeling an odd twinge or two but nothing like the stabbing pain of before.</p><p>Hermione dropped her arm and finally stared around the room. She seemed to have found herself in a luxurious bedroom, sitting up in a bed easily triple the size of her bed at home. Or four times the size of the bed she'd had in the tent with Harry and Ron.</p><p>The blankets were a muted dark blue and they felt wonderfully soft on her skin. She was only wearing a torn tank top, which had been spelled clean. As had her skin, she thought with a frown, it always left a strange feeling.  She could tell by the residue of stains on the hem. Her panties were thankfully intact, even if her jeans had mysteriously disappeared.</p><p>Behind her there was a monstrous pile of pillows which seemed to serve a more decorative purpose than any practical one. The room was dark, though she could make out a sitting area down a few steps from the bed and the walls were lined with bookcases and cabinets.</p><p>The only light was a small spelled flame on the nightstand next to her. </p><p>Hermione moved, ignoring the soreness and unpredictable twitches of her muscles as she scooted to the end of after pushing the blankets off her. She flinched as her bare feet touched the cold stone floor. </p><p>"I believe," said a frighteningly familiar voice "that it would be best if you remained in bed." Snape walked up the stairs, holding two different colored potions in his hands. He was dressed in casual clothes, Hermione was surprised to see. A regular white cotton shirt, black trousers and socks.</p><p>Immediately, she reached for her wand and when she was unable to find it she scooted back on to the bed moving as far away from Snape as possible. </p><p>"Miss Granger you're about to-" he was interrupted by her squeack of surprise as she reached the end of the other side of the bed and tumbled off. She lay there, stunned with her muscles twitching painfully. </p><p>She flinched when she felt him grab her arms and legs and lifting her with a grunt and putting her back onto the bed. She could only stare at him dumbly as he moved back again. "You're still suffering from the after effects of prolonged exposure to the Cruciatus." He said softly, his voice even and tone neutral "It is best to keep still and relaxed. Take this."</p><p>He held out one of the potions and she took it gingerly, unable to look anywhere near him. "S- sir?"</p><p>"It will help with the muscle spasms."</p><p>She looked from the potion in her lap back up to him.</p><p>"I-" she slowly put the flask on the bed next to her "I'll be alright, s-" she cut herself off before she could address him politely and she quickly turned away from him. As she looked around the room again she realized it must be his quarters. The Headmaster's quarters.</p><p>"Very well." He said gravelly "If you prefer to be in pain." He shrugged as if it was no concern of his.</p><p>There was an uncomfortable silence then and Hermione fidgeted, plucking at the torn hem of her tank top. She pulled the blankets closer to her, covering her legs.</p><p>"Are you aware of the fact that you have been cursed?" </p><p>Her hands tightened around the blankets, clutching them desperately as her knuckles turned white. She nodded mutely. </p><p>"You know what happens if the curse is not... T- treated?" He stumbled only slightly over the last word. His response was another nod, and a good view of her head full of curls as she stared at the sheets in front of her.</p><p>"Mis- Hermione," he finally said and held up the second potion he carried with him. The potion was a clear blue color, with a slight overtone of purple on the bottom, she recognized it instantly and gulped. He trailed off and looked away, lost for words.</p><p>"What are you waiting for?" Hermione wondered aloud, still clutching the blanket to her. She used it to cover most of her slight frame. "Or are you waiting for the curse to run its course and then..."</p><p>"I assure you," he said gravely "I have no more desire to sleep with you than you with me. Perhaps-" he hesitated "Perhaps it is difficult to believe but I do not wish to see your talents as a witch to go to waste." He stepped closer and held out the potion to her "It's your choice."</p><p>She stared at the potion and then back at him, clearly confused. "Wouldn't it be good? To have one less mudbloo-"</p><p>"Don't use that word." He snapped angrily and shoved the phial at her.</p><p>"I-" she looked at the potion again. "I don't know..." But she slowly reached up to take it from his hand.</p><p>"Shake it," he intoned "and take three sips." </p><p>She hesitated for a moment longer, shaking it very softly and then raised the phial to her lips and took three careful sips. She felt his eyes burning into her the whole time, the moment seemed to last an eternity. Once done, she held it out back to him. He nearly yanked it out of her hands, opened it and took three sips himself.</p><p>The reaction in him was immediately visible. His pinched brow relaxed and his shoulders sagged. With a grunt he sat down on the bed, not far from her.</p><p>"Why are you helping me?" She whispered softly, reaching out to graze his shoulder with her fingertips. </p><p>He sighed, bent forward and slid a hand through his greasy hair. "Perhaps I am simply tired." He said softly and turned around, slipped her retreating hand in his. He turned her arm and pressed his lips to her palm intimately. Catching her eyes with a heated gaze.</p><p>Hermione's breath caught and for a moment she thought her heart had stopped until it commenced beating again, a furious flutter inside her chest.</p><p>"Potion works fast." She mumbled, a flush creeping on her cheeks. She closed her eyes and the feelings of heat intensified. She could feel a pleasant tingling sensation in her extremities and the rough drag of fabric against her nipples.</p><p>"Hmn." He agreed and slid towards her on the bed. She turned away shyly, sitting with her back to him and he took advantage of her turned head to gently move her bushy hair away from a shoulder before he pressed open mouthed kisses to her shoulder and up her neck.</p><p>She made a soft surprised sound and tilted her head, giving him more space to trail hot kisses over her skin. She moaned loudly when he sucked hard on her pulse point, the sound carrying to the corners of the room.</p><p>"I don't-" she started breathlessly "I don't know what to do..." She lifted her hands helplessly and they flopped back on the bed right as she arched into his touch with another moan.</p><p>"Hmn." He hummed, his hands sliding down her sides and to her hips. She twitched lightly away from his hands as they tickled her. "Relax, Hermione. That's all you have to do." He whispered into her ear, his tone low and breathy, causing her to shudder in pleasure.</p><p>His hands grabbed her tank top firmly and began to tug it up, his fingers grazed the skin of her breasts and she gasped. "Oh god." She lifted her arms, helping him take off the top and then she was naked but for her small sensible panties. She glanced over her shoulder, a red blush smudged across her cheeks and nose.</p><p>Severus could not deny to himself that she looked very lovely sitting in his bed the way she was. He hoped, in the back of his mind that it was the potion speaking.</p><p>His hand trailed down her back, briefly touching scars that were still an angry red. She arched her back and moaned again. She turned around and Severus took in her appearance, from the blush staining her cheeks to her nipples straining to be touched.</p><p>Shyly her own hands came up to him, touching his cheek first and then trailing down his neck to begin opening the buttons on his shirt. He waited patiently while he observed her as she was focused on her task.</p><p>As more and more buttons became undone her fingers began to shake after which Severus softly clasped his larger hand over hers. "Relax." He whispered and helped her unbutton the rest of his shirt. She gingerly touched his chest, wondering why he was so skinny if he lived on the Hogwarts’ fare every year. He grabbed her hands and pushed them away after a bit. She looked up at him searchingly.</p><p>"Come." He said and his arm went around her waist and side. He picked her up slightly and laid her down on the bed, her curls spread out like a halo.</p><p>He quickly unbuttoned his trousers before sliding on top of her, his naked chest teasing hers. She arched up into him eagerly. "It feels-" she whispered, clutching to the sheets on either side of her. She moaned unintelligently as he kissed his way over the soft skin of her belly, over her sternum and sucked a nipple into his mouth. She cried out in pleasure and her legs moved to wrap around his middle, pushing her hips to his wordlessly.</p><p>He groaned around her nipple as she wrapped herself around him. "Fuck." He cursed as he moved back, and cursed again when he sat back on his haunches and could see her laying before him, flushed and wanton.</p><p>"Pro- Sna-" She whispered questioningly as she sat up slightly, leaning on her hands behind her. She looked up at him shyly and bit her lip.</p><p>"What?" He said rudely, narrowing his eyes at her. The look didn't seem to cow her in the slightest.</p><p>"W- will you kiss me?"</p><p>He stared at her for a moment and shook his head in negative. "Once the potion runs out... You'll be glad." He gently tapped her shoulder and pushed her back onto the bed. She looked disappointed and nodded uncertainly but followed his directions.</p><p>"Spread your legs again." He whispered as a hand trailed over the curve of her ass and thigh.</p><p>Hermione made a choked noise and stared at him for several moments, he could feel her muscles tense under his hand. He stopped all movements and looked into her brown eyes. "If you've changed your mind, Hermione. Now would be the time."</p><p>Her breasts rose and fell with every breath and slowly she relaxed, closing her eyes. "Sorry, I mean- C- Continue." She mumbled softly and shifted her legs to either side of him. He moved his hand up her thigh, stroking firmly and slipped his fingers beneath her panties before he tugged them down gently. Meanwhile he caressed her nipples and placed more open mouthed kisses along the column of her neck.</p><p>"Relax." He repeated again between kisses and she moaned softly as a reply. She trembled as the tops of his fingers slid over her labia before gently parting her lips and sliding a finger into her. He twisted his wrist and slid a second finger into her, meeting no resistance. She was wet and hot and he could already feel her walls fluttering around his fingers.</p><p>"Good?" He whispered "Do you feel any pain?"</p><p>She shook her head furiously, her eyes squeezed closed. "It's good." She breathed "No pain." To punctuate the statement she let out a soft moan. "Hurry-" she demanded and tilted her hips eagerly to push his fingers deeper inside of her.</p><p>He looked from her swollen pussy stretched around his fingers to her face. So eager and willing, even without the potion he'd be uncomfortably hard. He thrust his fingers into her and stretched them, Hermione's responding moan was loud and if he hadn't already been uncomfortably hard, he would have been then.</p><p>Carefully he slid his fingers out of her, despite her protesting mewls. She shifted and eyed him curiously, her eyes widening a little when he used his still drenched fingers to push his trousers down. She gulped and looked away, before quickly glancing back, and away again.</p><p>Severus snorted and, finally naked, crawled on top of her. He nudged her thighs with his knee, until she made room for him between her legs while his hands supported his weigh on either side of her shoulders. She didn't need any prompting to slide her hands first over his chest and then over his neck before she pressed tiny kisses to his throat.</p><p>He sighed at the feeling of her tongue teasing his sensitive skin. "Hermione-" he started hesitantly  and she leaned back, looking up at him. "Tell me, in no uncertain terms, that you're okay with this." He looked no less intense than a minute ago, his dark eyes burning into hers.</p><p>Hermione looked surprised for a few seconds, averted her gaze and then nodded. "I- Yes. I- don't want to be a squib. I mean-" she gasped as Severus bent down and took one of her nipples into his mouth and sucked it hard while his tongue flicked it mercilessly. She arched into him, pressing her body to his. She could feel his hard cock at her center and she gasped eagerly.</p><p>Severus grunted and finally let go of her nipple, before he kissed his way up. He spread her legs and took his shaft into his hands to guide himself to her eager, wet opening.</p><p>He entered her firmly in one heavy stroke with her arms clutched around his neck and her legs wrapped around him. She arched and gasped, breathing heavily near his ear while she mumbled incoherently.</p><p>"Fuck." He cursed again, and loudly at the feeling of her tight heat around him.</p><p>He grabbed onto her waist and pushed her firmly into the mattress, holding on to her slim hips as he began to move. Sliding in an out, in an out as he slowly picked up the pace.</p><p>She moaned loudly with every thrust she arched into him and squeezed around his cock. He closed his eyes and let out a ragged breath before letting out a string of expletives.</p><p>Her eyes fluttered open and to meet his as they caught and locked on to each other. Severus kept pushing into her in a steady but demanding rhythm. Her pupils were dilated and her face flushed and for one moment Severus thought it was the most beautiful sight he'd ever seen. Her eyes slipped closed and she tilted her head back as she tightened her legs around his hips and a loud moan sounded through the room.</p><p>"Please." She whispered feverishly "Oh- please." She pleaded with him, never breaking their gaze. She bit her bottom lip hard as she squeezed around him. He could only stare uncomprehendingly while he thrust into her. "Tell me." He said, his smooth baritone rolled over her and she tilted her head back, pushing her breasts closer to his chest. He leaned further, bowing over her until their lips were nearly brushing. He closed his eyes and pulled back, instead his hands clamped down on her waist and he slammed into her.</p><p>"Come." He intoned, one hand sliding down her belly to stroke her clit.</p><p>The mew she let out was downright filthy and he responded by speeding up his thumb as it circled her clit. "Hermione." He breathed, slamming home at every word "For fuck's sake-" She squeezed her eyes closed as her sheath clamped down around his shaft. He felt her nails dig into his shoulders as she let out a ragged gasp.</p><p>"Please- oh." She buried her face into his neck and moaned into his skin "It feels so good."</p><p>His answer was a choked growl as he continued to thrust into her until finally he could feel a familiar tightening sensation in his scrotum and with another string of expletives he came. He collapsed on top of her, with her arms still around his neck and her face pressed into his shoulder.</p><p>He could feel her tight walls tremble, still. He could hear the beat of her heart and smell sex and sweat in the air around them. With a groan he slipped out of her and fell next to her, completely spent.</p><p>Her eyes were closed and she sighed deeply, relieved as she could feel the peculiar itch of Ballatrix’ curse dissipate underneath her skin. She was too tired to contemplate anything else and soon she slept.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>In the middle of the night Snape, still wide awake, finally slid out of the bed. He waved his hand dismissively, causing the sheet to tuck itself around Hermione’s sleeping form. With another wave he summoned his clothing and tugged them on.</p><p>When Snape made a third attempt to close the first button on his shirt he stopped and let it hang open. His hands were trembling too much. He stared at his hands and they seemed to blur for an instant, he blinked and shook his head. Then sought refuge in the Headmaster’s office, away from the student he’d slept with. It seemed that, in the last stretches of war, he'd have to abandon all morals.</p><p>Snape was not the only one still awake that night. On the other side of the castle Minerva McGonagall sat in her Transfigurations classroom, wide awake with a half-empty bottle of scotch next to a glass. Her usually tight bun was half undone, grey hair trailing over her shoulders and back. For decades she’d taught in that very classroom, teaching students, seeing them grow up from ickly firsties to grown young adults.</p><p>She grabbed the bottle and poured herself another stiff drink. If she squinted her eyes just right she could see a young Hermione Granger sitting in the front row, her hand waving in the air. A marked difference from the unconscious young woman at Snape’s feet.</p><p>She picked up the glass and poured it all down her throat, her hand clutched around the glass so tightly her knuckles turned white. She’d failed Hermione, as she’d failed Albus. Now young, brilliant Hermione was left to a Death Eater and Albus was dead.</p>
