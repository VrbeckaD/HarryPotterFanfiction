    <p>When Molly and Arthur visited Bill without the rest of the family on the Christmas of 1992 it was very bittersweet. They had loved having time away, alone on days that Bill had work and it was almost a second honeymoon. To add onto that they had finally time to give their eldest some great love and attention – sometimes to Bill’s own dismay as he realised even being an ‘adult’ didn’t mean he would avoid Molly’s howler-like lectures. However to every sweet there was a bitter, they missed the gang together – Bill included – and seeing some great things would set off a thought like ‘Percy would love this’ finding something for each of their kids. They knew they couldn’t afford to take everyone and for now that was fine.</p><p>Then, around Easter the thought occurs to Arthur as he’s reading the paper before he sets off to work.</p><p>“The Daily Prophet, that’s it!”</p><p>“What’s what, Arthur?” she says, giving him a sly kiss on the cheek as she sets down a pot of tea and makes a drink for herself.</p><p>“The Daily Prophet Draw. If we ever won, we could take all of them to see Egypt.” His eyes lit up as he lifted them from the newspaper and hers sparked alight as she listened to him. </p><p>She nodded and added, “Fantastic. We can enter one per family member right? We’ll do that and hope for the best.”</p><p>“Great!”</p><p>“Arthur.” She continued sternly, “We lose this though, we don’t do it again. We can’t afford that.”</p><p>He wasn’t happy for but was in the need of planting his feet firmly back on the ground, he agreed nonetheless and kissed his wife as he went to work that morning. He didn’t envy her tending to the garden since the gnomes had been so reckless recently and tried to think of gnomes when he thought of the draw as if to ward away high hopes should they be dashed.</p><p>After a long wait the draw opened and everyone entered on behalf of The Weasley’s – the kids and Arthur and Molly, Harry donated his to Ron and Hermione to Ginny after clearing up that it was within the rules to do so (by Hermione of course) , hoping it would give them ample chance. There was a downside that came with that though. Ron insisted that should it be Harry’s donation he should be able to come, his house-life as it was. Unfortunately, Harry wasn’t their child and both the muggle and wizarding set of Children’s Services needed vast improvement. There would be no way to take Harry. Hermione had been petrified and their own baby girl hidden almost to haunt the castle forevermore – it was becoming more and more tempting to take anyone they could but they tried hard to remember that there would be other times to help Harry or coddle Hermione.</p><p>There was nothing bittersweet or half-assed about when they won though. The end of school year day, they heard Ginny would be okay, Hermione un-petrified, Harry and Ron heroes and a post flew in. It was almost tentative, scared perhaps the train had derailed since all the news was far too good. Slowly they read and finally Arthur picked up Molly in a hug and spun her round the room. Molly didn’t know Arthur could still do that to her. He yelled happily and she broke into ecstatic tears. For once, financially, something had gone right with The Weasleys. It was some sort of miracle, a gift from Merlin himself. </p><p>They saw the winning slip and some hidden guilt was taken off their shoulders as Ron’s scruffy handwriting showed “The Weasley Family”. There was still plenty of guilt even when Harry himself told them he couldn’t anyway and that he was fine but had it been his slightly more legible handwriting there would be every temptation to not take it and pass it to Harry. Harry had laughed at the idea.</p><p>“You won’t even take a single galleon from me and you expect me to take 700 from you?” He replied with a straight face but a light of mischief let them know that while he was being silly he would never take the money. It was hard to leave him behind but Dumbledore had took Percy aside when he heard about them entering and told them that Harry needed to go home to survive, that it was to do with Lily’s love  and family. When Molly had heard she made sure to keep him off but grumbled plenty how it was impossible because that family didn’t know how to love. </p><p>Any time after that that someone mentioned Harry ‘going home’ she’d gather a face like thunder but say not a thing.</p><p>Thankfully, Hermione was easier as her parents had mentioned the South of France several times.</p><p>She tried to shake him from her mind as she begun packing everyone’s things. Between Percy trying to pack sweater-vests and Ron neglecting to pack at all she knew it would be best to do so for them before they all got home. The flights were booked and honestly the thought of muggle flights sounded terrifying. Between thinking of flights and Harry she was mentally tiring herself. She made some tea and sat at the table and looked out over the land.</p><p>A thought occurred to her and she got out a letter and began to write;</p><p> </p><p>“To my darling boy Charlie,</p><p>For the love of Merlin pack that shirt I gave you or at least one that’s not singed by dragons. I love you kids but I’m glad at least some of you are grown up. But why are all the boys that are hard to pack for the younger ones? See you there.</p><p>Love, Mum</p><p>PS. Do not tell me you singed the one I gave you”</p><p>She sent him a second page with the details of how to book his flight. It was a nice rest before she started again and worrying about packing, it also reminded her that worrying about packing was much less tiring than worrying about Harry and Ginny and Hermione. So much had gone wrong and she had a feeling that this was just the start of it. During Ginny being missing and Hermione petrified they came to the arrangement of keeping tabs on each other, support each other – Harry and Hermione included. This would not happen again while she still breathed.</p><p>Now fate had given them this money for the holiday and dammit if she wasn’t able to make sure they forgot about the last school year she was at least going to try.</p><p>What Molly wasn’t to know was 3 out of the 4 boys had repacked once she had finished and it was going to make for one hell of a trip.</p><p>“Are we altogether?” She shouted back as she moved forward and heard a chorus of ‘yes’. Something was wrong though, one was missing and upon hearing the family was all going together Hermione had insisted in her watching Home Alone. For the first while she wasn’t sure if the bushy-haired young girl was insisting to remember all of her children but as the rest of the film’s premise came into play she realised what she had told her about this for. It was telling her to keep on her toes on holiday and that she would. She turned at such velocity they all nearly walked into her.</p><p>“What’s wrong mum?” Ginny asked innocently… too innocently. Yes, she was definitely back to herself.</p><p>“Where is George?” She said having analysed the group. They all shrugged and Fred smirked. Thinking quickly she shrugged and answered, “Fine, we were going to grab a bite to it but since you’ve evidently ate him none of you will need anything, I’m sure.”</p><p>The kids groaned, Percy answered, “Wait, wait, he’s in the toilets.”</p><p>“I expected Ron to sell us out for food but not you!” Fred exclaimed.</p><p>“I’m a growing man, sue me.”<br/>“Trust me, we will should we need to.” George answered, finally back from the loos with a laugh.</p><p>“Yeah, c’mon Perce, we are waiting till you start raking it in.” Fred moaned.</p><p>“Bring in your own money.” Percy retorted.</p><p>“Can we wait until we find some food?” Ron said.</p><p>“Sure, Ronnie-kins.” Both the twins cooed much to Ron’s annoyance.</p><p>This was already going to be a long holiday, Molly nearly started regretting it.</p><p>Ginny dropped her bag loudly, as if to make a point.  All eyes very quickly went to her – not just of The Weasley’s – but of person in the surrounding vicinity. Percy was going to tell her how making a scene made her a spectacle but as if reading his mind she raised her eyebrow at him to consider how what they had been doing was any different. He kept his mouth shut. Finally, she whined, “It is too early in the morning for this.”</p><p>It was her sentiment but also an act, Ginny did not whine since… possibly, ever. It was a play that she was told by Harry during one of the lunches at the year – that with so many brothers it’s like people, muggles especially, expected them to be spoilt; which was rarely the case. She started to move as if to make an over tired fuss and Arthur thought on his feet.</p><p>“C’mon, Ginny, you’ve had a long night. One of you boys piggyback her and we’ll go get some food.” Arthur insisted and Ginny almost laughed but held her cool, she committed to the act by making a sad face and rubbing her eyes. Apparently this was enough for the surrounding folk to write this girl off as a regular spoilt ‘muggle’ child. Percy put her on his back and they headed off for food before the flight.</p>
