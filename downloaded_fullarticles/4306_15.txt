          <div class="userstuff"><p>Draco felt smothered and squished, laying between his two best friends; it was uncomfortably warm, and his legs were tangled with theirs. He couldn't quite tell whose limbs were whose, and not to mention, he was half-naked.</p><p>But Draco liked it, as he always did. He never imagined that he'd be sharing an apartment with Theo and Blaise after the war, all three of them sharing a bed instead of having separate rooms like he'd always thought they would. He didn't quite know how they had gotten into a relationship, but it just happened--with their frequent nightmares, they'd started climbing into each other's beds--and he wouldn't take it back, not for the world.</p><p>It made them all happy, so where was the harm?</p><p>He snuggled closer to Blaise's chest, only to be dragged back towards Theo by the arm around his waist. Draco smiled, not at all bothered.</p><p>"Morning," Theo whispered into Draco's ear.</p><p>Draco opened his eyes and tilted his head back to look at Theo.</p><p>"Morning," Draco murmured before twisting around slightly to kiss him.</p><p>Theo propped himself up so that Draco wouldn't hurt his neck trying to kiss him. Draco pulled away from Theo, lips pressed tightly together, and Theo laughed softly.</p><p>"Eugh, morning breath," Draco said, scrunching his nose.</p><p>"Shut up," Blaise groaned, rolling over on his back--nearly crushing Draco in the process--and covering his eyes with his arm.</p><p>Draco and Theo glanced at each other, silently communicating for a moment before they both smirked. Draco sat up and threw his leg over Blaise's waist so he was straddling him, and Theo pulled the Italian's arm away from his face.</p><p>Blaise groaned again, cracking open his eyes to glare at his lovers. He was <em>not</em> a morning person.</p><p>"Fuck off," Blaise mumbled.</p><p>Theo <em>tsked </em>and shook his head, staring down at their dark-haired lover. Draco sat back on his haunches and crossed his arms, mock-pouting.</p><p>"Aw, come on, Blaise. You can't say no to that face, can you?" Theo quipped, trying his hardest not to smirk.</p><p>Blaise rolled his eyes--they did this every morning--and begrudgingly looked up at the platinum blond. He sighed.</p><p>"We haven't run out of coffee, have we?" He grunted. It was his way of saying "I'll be up in a moment." Draco grinned.</p><p>He leaned down, gave Blaise a peck on the lips, and slid off the bed to go make coffee. He was like an over-excited puppy in the mornings.</p><p>He heard Blaise and Theo chuckle as he walked down the hall. He smiled, truly content with his life.</p><p>He wouldn't trade this for anything else in the world.</p></div>
