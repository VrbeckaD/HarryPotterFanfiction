    <p>His face still haunted her mind.</p><p>She remembered watching him lie on the ground, writhing in pain as the venom poured through his system. She remembered hating him, wanting nothing more than for that man to die for what he'd done to Dumbledore, to them all. She wanted him to suffer. She had refused to do anything to help him. Sure, she could have halted the venom enough so Madam Pomfrey could save him, but why would she want to? He was a murderer.</p><p>When Harry had later told her about the memories Snape had passed on to him, her heart had dropped, sorrow clutching at her stomach as she realized that she had become a murderer too. She could have done something. She could have tried to save him, but no. She let Severus Snape, a courageous, innocent man, die.</p><p>At least, that's what Hermione had thought until his body had been removed from the Shrieking Shack, a body that still had a pulse... She had shuddered to herself, thanking Merlin that Snape had possessed the foresight to realize that his pseudo-master would undoubtably betray him. She was relived to know that Snape had worked for months to create a coma-inducing spell, one that would allow his body to be almost petrified until the wizarding world could cure him.</p><p>On the one hand, a great weight had been lifted off of the young witch's shoulders. He was alive. He was in rehabilitation, and he would be for many months, but he was alive. She hadn't killed him.</p><p>But she had meant to. She had been glad that an evil presence was being taken out of this world, glad that he would get what he deserved. He would have died because of her.</p><p>And so, his face haunted her mind.</p>

  <em>Tick. Tick. Tick. Tick.</em>
</p><p>Severus Snape sat in silence, listening to the sounds of clock ticking as he waited inside the Healer's office. He was alone, but Severus still couldn't help but scowl at the empty air in front of him. This was a waste of his time. He had things to do, so why was he lounging about inside an empty office as he waited for a dilatory Healer?</p><p>
  <em>Tick. Tick. Tick. Tick.</em>
</p><p>Absentmindedly, Severus reached up to rub his thumb over the scar on his neck where Nagini had bitten him. He mentally cursed the wretched snake. Because of the vile creature, he had spent two months unconscious, his body having the venom forcibly removed from it through a painful draining process. Following his awakening, he'd needed another six months in rehabilitation at St. Mungo's as his muscles healed from disuse and the damage Nagini had caused.</p><p>
  <em>Tick. Tick. Tick. Tick.</em>
</p><p>Now, finally, he was feeling more like himself. He could once more walk without a cane, lift a heavy cauldron, tie his own shoes... He had even managed to regain his old physique back, his arms and legs having some definition to them once more, his body no longer being the frail skinny frame from his rehabilitation. Yes, he was better. And today was the day he would be leaving this blasted place.</p><p>At least, he would if the Healer would actually step into her office.</p><p>
  <em>Tick. Tick. Tick. Tick.</em>
</p><p>Maybe if he was just going to return to his house to open a bottle of firewhiskey, the Healer's tardiness would not be such a big deal. But no. He needed to meet with Minerva to discuss the upcoming school year. He would be resuming his post as Potions master once more. He may not have been particularly fond of his job, but he needed to make a living somehow, and he doubted he'd be able to find a career elsewhere. Most people didn't enjoy hiring ex-spies to work for them.</p><p>
  <em>Tick. Tick. Tick. Tick.</em>
</p><p>He was tempted to pull out his wand and blast the clock to pieces. Why must it be one that made noise? Didn't they realize how incessantly grating it was on the ears? But it wasn't just the noise that bothered him about the clock, he knew.</p><p>No, to him, the clock was a reminder. A reminder of how long he had spent pining over Lily, only to realize after Harry had defeated Voldemort that he could finally move on. A reminder over how long he'd participated in the evil debauchery of the Dark Lord. A reminder of how much longer he would have to live alone.</p><p>No, he didn't like the clock at all.</p><p>
