          <div class="userstuff"><p>Ginny walked briskly past every exploding, sparkling, and otherwise distracting item in her brothers' store. When she reached the dusty display of magical hand sanitizer at the back wall ("Guaranteed to remove most results of using Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes, some limitations apply"), she checked that no other customers were close enough to hear.</p><p>"I solemnly swear that I am too sexy for my shirt," she whispered while rolling her eyes. The hand sanitizer sank into the floor and revealed a doorway long enough for her to step through.</p><p>The first display she saw bore a strong resemblance to the laxative display in the previous room, though this one's sign read "You woo-hoo? The masturbation sensation that's sweeping the nation." Several shelves of books ranged from tasteful erotica to instruction books, though there was far more smut than sex ed. The shelves at eye level were filled with prophylactics with names like <em>Protego-go-go</em> ("lightly charmed for your pleasure"), <em>Condom Vigilance!</em> (pending Auror approval), and <em>Expecto Patro-Yum</em> (butterbeer-flavored dental dams).</p><p>Because the Weasley twins were nothing if not showmen, the next display was a colorful collection of dildos with the mildly terrifying <em>Giant Squid</em> and <em>Horntail</em> dildos ("animal cruelty-free") in pride of place. One shelf held dildos with suspiciously familiar color combinations. Hufflepuff House proved its popularity by its absence from that shelf, though its existence was clearly suggested by the gap before rows of red-gold, blue-bronze, and green-silver models. Of course, that might have simply been a matter of size, as the Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin dildos appeared to be arranged in a size gradient. The Slytherins who probably wouldn't even come into this shop would probably feel outraged.</p><p>The vibrators were generally smaller and thus you found the <em>Golden Snitch</em> ("with extendable feathery bits for more fluttery vibrations, external use only, not for actual Quidditch"), <em>Wingardi-UM Levi-OH-sa</em> ("remote control for fun with special friends"), and <em>Accio Orgasm</em> ("trick wands for adults") next to <em>Crystal Balls</em> (anal beads) and the Impedi-men-ta ("one cock ring to bind them all"). Among the plugs were the <em>Aloha-MORE-ah</em> (a trio of plugs in a size gradient) and the <em>Engorgio</em> ("for size queens"). <em>The Bludger</em> ("for beaters") looked out of place, since all the other sleeves were on a different wall.</p><p>The lube selection included <em>Troll Snot</em> ("nasty stuff for a nice time"), <em>Unicorn Repellant </em>("available in a rainbow of glitter and metallic options"), <em>Potion Lotion </em>("massage oil greasier than the Great Bat's hair"), and <em>Incendi-OH! </em>("all the warming sensation of a blast-ended screwt with none of the burn damage").</p><p>The display graded to more kinky products like the <em>Tattle-Tale</em> gag ("my father will hear of this!") and <em>Expelli-anus</em>. The <em>Devil's Snare </em>was carefully labeled to explain that all bondage materials are enchanted to accept custom safewords but in case of an emergency will also release at the word lumos. The <em>Riddikulus </em>set of sounding rods were accompanied by a whole stack of pamphlets that she just didn't have time to look through just then. The <em>Wingardium Levio-Sling</em> was of course amusing, though it seemed unlike the twins to use two similar puns for their products. Then again, perhaps they were busy designing the <em>Kiss-Arse, </em>which paddle featured a parody of the Slytherin house crest in which the snake was replaced by a ferret.</p><p>Ginny finally made her way to the register, where one of the things she paid for was a lube container charmed to look like a mimbulus mimbletonia. The only question she had was whether Neville would figure it out before she or Luna ran out of patience. She shrugged and figured it counted as a win either way.</p><p><br/> <br/> </p></div>
