    <p>Harry woke with a start as a loud crash sounded through Grimmauld place, making the whole foundation of the building start to shake. He stumbled out of bed throwing his door open as he made his way out into the hall. Other people were emerging from their own rooms, Remus and Tonks who had stayed the night after arriving back late from a mission, Teddy having stayed the night at his grandma’s. Andromeda enjoyed the company after Ted’s untimely passing. Mr and Mrs Weasley, as well as Ron and Ginny, began to converge on the stairs, everyone looking around in confusion at what had caused the noise.</p><p>They heard footsteps racing through the kitchen and up the stairs toward them, Harry raised his wand in preparation, not sure who to expect. Snape rounded the corner, his face pale and dark eyes wild.</p><p>“Dumbledore…” he gasped, trying to catch his breath.</p><p>“Dumbledore has been killed! The fidelius has fallen, WE MUST FLEE!” He shouted just as another boom shook the house, the walls and floors creaking from the pressure.</p><p>Remus took charge, “every adult grab a child and apparate out now, we can reconvene later when we know we are all safe,” he said calmly.</p><p>Remus grabbed Harry while Tonks wrapped her arms around Hermione, Mr and Mrs Weasley grabbed Ron and Ginny respectively, Harry closed his eyes preparing for the suffocating feeling that apparition invokes… but nothing happened.</p><p>“They have set up anti apparition wards around Grimmauld” Tonks gasped, fear shining in her eyes as she pulled her robe tighter around herself.<br/>
Harry felt Remus clutch him a little tighter at her words and looked around to see his worried face.</p><p>“The floo was already blocked when I apparated in,” Snape said solemnly meeting Remus’s stare head-on, Harry heard Mrs Weasley whimper behind him.<br/>
Mr Weasley swallowed thickly, “we will have to fight our way out then.”</p><p>Harry met Ron and Hermione’s frightened eyes as everyone pulled their wands out not knowing what to expect but preparing themselves for battle.</p><p>No sooner had Harry pulled his wand then there was another explosion, the front door was blasted off its hinges, wood and debris flying everywhere. Dust rained down upon his head from the ceiling above as the adults ran forward, Remus and surprisingly Snape leading the charge.</p><p>Dozens of death eaters burst into the front hall, all ignoring Mrs Black screeching from her frame as they raised their wands and prepared to fight. They all wore masks, but Harry knew who some of them must be, Nott, Malfoy, Lestrange, Carrow, Dolohov… </p><p>Harry charged into the fight, a stupefy falling from his lips as he aimed his wand at the closest death eater. He got satisfaction as he watched the person fall but the win was short-lived as another death eater quickly took his place. </p><p>The fight started to blur, spells flying everywhere, and Harry remembered shoving Hermione and Ron, telling them to hide, tears falling down Hermione’s face. More dust and debris fell around them as a wall as blasted away, Harry was worried the whole building might fall down upon their heads. Snape was the first to fall, not surprising as he was at the front firing spells like a demon, he made himself a clear target to the death eaters. Harry heard himself cry out in anguish as a spell hit Remus square in the chest, another hitting Tonks as they collapsed to the floor unmoving.</p><p>Harry fought next to Mr Weasley, but both knew they were outnumbered, there was no escape now. A cutting hex hit Harry’s shoulder, blood running down his sleeve just as a bone crushing jinx hit his right leg. He attempted to stand, attempted to keep fighting, but couldn’t seem to get his leg to hold his weight anymore, the pain indescribable as he tried to balance on it. Harry looked up in time to see a familiar green light come racing towards him but before he could even think of blocking it time seemed to stop and Harry felt a weird pulling sensation in his stomach that reminded him somewhat of apparition. He was thrown backwards, flying through the air and landing with a crash on the staircase behind him, his head hitting the stairs with a loud thud that made him groan in pain.</p><p>He heard footsteps running and a cry for help as a face leaned over him, peering at him closely. He saw a pair of grey stormy eyes and dark wavy hair.</p><p>“Sirius?” Harry asked groggily blinking hard as he tried to remain conscious. </p><p>Harry saw the grey eyes widen in surprise before his vision went black.</p>
