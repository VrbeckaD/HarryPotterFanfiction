    <p>Professor McGonagall’s office, South Tower, January 1976</p><p> </p><p>When Professor Minerva McGonagall wasn’t brooding on all the unsatisfactory things in her life, such as two failed relationships and near marriages and a strained relationship with her parents, she was doing her absolute best to keep her unruly Gryffindors from running amok of the castle. </p><p>She thumbed through their most recent end-of-term reports and took a long, soothing sip of her tea when she came to Sirius Black’s. From the moment he had tripped Marlene McKinnon at the Sorting Ceremony of 1971, she knew...Professor McGonagall just knew that Black was going to be an absolute thorn in her side. </p><p>But still, Gryffindor’s Head of House decided to give the reports one more cursory glance. </p><p>“Masochism, thy name is Minerva McGonagall,” The middle-aged witch muttered to herself as she continued to nurse her tea. Black’s file was particularly thick, with bits of parchments falling  out here and there. </p><p>“Raw potential, refuses to recognize it,” She said, reading through Slughorn’s comments. This was surprising. Horace Slughorn rarely, if ever, had anything remotely negative to say of Black, whose family he quite admired. As far as he was concerned, they could do no wrong. “Intent on disrupting class, no respect for authority…” </p><p>Merlin, Horace, don’t hold back, she thought to herself. </p><p>Speaking of Black, she kept a watchful eye on her fireplace. He was one of the students set to arrive back from the break via Hogwarts’ Floo network, although why Walburga wasn’t insistent that he wasn’t allowed to take the train with his friends was beyond her. </p><p>She set the folder aside and returned to her gruesome seventh-year planning. An hour had passed before an average-height, curly-haired boy appeared in her fireplace, surrounded by a flurry of green flames. </p><p>“Black,” McGonagall acknowledged, barely looking up from her work. </p><p>“Professor,” He returned politely, dragging his trunk and several other things behind him. He appeared to be in a hurry, undoubtedly to get back to Gryffindor tower, but the Hogwarts Express hadn’t gotten back yet and he was the first student to arrive through her office, so it was safe to say that his friends were not back yet. </p><p>She gave him a quick once over and furrowed her eyebrows. The cloak of his hood was pulled tightly around his face, only revealing a few of his usual curls pressed against his forehead. </p><p>“Come here.” </p><p>He stopped in his tracks, just inches away from the door and said, without meeting her quizzical eyes, “I really should - “ </p><p>Minerva gestured sternly with her index finger, indicating that her statement had not been a request, negotiation or an invitation for a debate. Unwillingly, Sirius approached her desk. </p><p>“Are you cold?” She asked simply, staring pointedly at the hood pulled tightly around his head. </p><p>Sirius gave her one of his best cheeky smiles, “Bad hair day,” He explained with a soft chuckle. </p><p>“Hmmm.” </p><p>Reaching into the first drawer of her desk, she produced a tin of custard creams. He looked at them longingly, and she pushed them toward him, “Have a biscuit,” Minerva offered kindly, but when he reached his hand for them she stopped him, “But first, would you please have a seat?” </p><p>He swallowed hard but sat down gingerly on the chair across from her desk, wincing quite obviously as he did so. </p><p>“Black, are you alright?” Professor McGonagall prodded. </p><p>Sirius grunted a positive response and asked, “Could I have that biscuit now?” </p><p>She pushed the tin closer to him. In a matter of minutes, he made short work of the first, second and third until he had halfway eaten through the tin. When he realized this, he gave her a sheepish grin, “Guess I was hungrier than I thought,” He said quietly, leaning back in the chair, “I’ll be sure to replace those the next time I go to Hogsmeade.”</p><p>Minerva stared at him thoughtfully. “I trust that you had a good break?”</p><p>“Alright, just a bit tired is all,” He mumbled, biting down hard on his lip, “I really should be getting back -  I expect Pr - James is waiting for me.“ </p><p>She shook her head, “The Hogwarts Express isn’t due back for…” Minerva checked the clock on her wall, “Another hour. So I’m afraid Mr. Potter isn’t back as yet. Black, please remove your hood.” </p><p>Sirius looked as though she had asked him to step in front of a moving Hogwarts Express.</p><p>“Is there a problem?” The fifth year asked apprehensively. He pulled more tightly at his hood, if that were even possible. </p><p>“That is yet to be determined,” Professor McGonagall said as gently as she could. She rested her chin in the palm of her hand and leaned across her desk, “Why won’t you remove your hood?”</p><p>“Is there a rule that says I can’t wear my hood inside?” He retorted curtly. </p><p>She winced at the sharpness in his voice, but decided to let him have that one. There was the lack of respect for authority that Horace had mentioned in his report. </p><p>“No, there is no such rule,” said Professor McGonagall, “But in the five years you have been my student, I have yet to witness a single hair out of place on your head. I am as inclined to believe that you are having a ‘bad hair day’ as much as I believe that you belong in Slytherin house, which is to say not one bit.” </p><p>Sirius stood up so quickly that his chair nearly toppled over, “I don’t have time for this.” </p><p>“Sit down,” She said in her usual stern voice, “And please remove your hood for me,” Professor McGonagall repeated, determined. </p><p>He heaved a heavy sigh, sat down and in the same second that he removed his hood, she gasped at the sight and Sirius immediately said, “I fell - I fell down the stairs. I’m clumsy, this we know,” He stammered. “Not a big deal.” </p><p>She took in the sight of his face. There was an open scar just over his right cheek, probably less than two days old, a bruise on his forehead and a similar injury on his chin. </p><p>“Unless you managed to hit your face on every single step on the way down,” Minerva said, incredulous. She was struggling to supress another gasp that was bubbling in her throat, “I suggest that you try another lie, Black.” When he said nothing, she went on and asked, “Who?” </p><p>He was visibly hesitant, “No one can know. If you tell, I swear I won’t come back to Hogwarts.”</p><p>“I will keep it as confidential as I can, bearing in mind that you are underage.” </p><p>And so she listened and listened without interrupt. Apparently, Orion Black had a penchant for hitting, cursing and hexing things, namely his sons but more so Sirius because it had been so disgraceful for his oldest son, who came from a long line of pure-blooded Slytherins, to be sorted into the House of Gryffindor. </p><p>She looked at his things in the corner near her door. There was a trunk, his cage housing his owl, a few bags and his broomstick, “Is that why you’ve brought every belonging to your name back to Hogwarts? You don’t intend to return your family, do you?” She asked, already knowing the answer. </p><p>“I can’t,” Sirius said shakily, “I won’t. I don’t care if I’m disowned or disinherited or blasted off the family tree, I’ll do whatever I have to do. I’m not going back there and you can’t make me.” </p><p>Minerva took another sip of her tea and paused momentarily before speaking. </p><p>“I do not intend to send you back to Grimmauld Place, Black. That would be exceedingly irresponsible of me,” She explained, “However. I am required to report this to the Ministry of Magic.” </p><p>He stood up again and yelled, “NO!” No student had ever raised their voice at her and so, she didn’t quite know how to respond. Before she could, he realized the impropriety of his actions and sat down again, “If you tell the Ministry, my father is sure to find out. It’ll be nearly impossible me for to leave.” </p><p>Damn it, she thought. She never thought she would say this, but Sirius was right. </p><p>She closed her eyes, just as she had before when she was alone in her office. He had a point.  “I will speak with Professor Dumbledore first,” McGonagall said, hoping that was a sufficient compromise because, honestly, that was the best alternative she could provide in this situation. “And we will determine how to move forward.” </p><p>He looked at her skeptically. </p><p>“I promise you that I will not speak to the Ministry until I’ve spoken with Professor Dumbledore,” She repeated solemnly, standing up. She desperately wanted to send him to Madam Pomfrey, but it was a miracle that he had not taken any issue with her bringing this to Dumbledore’s attention.</p><p>He nodded slowly, taking in her promise, “Okay,” was the simple response. </p><p>“Now,” McGonagall said, picking up her wand, “Hold still. I am not going to hurt you. I’m no Madam Pomfrey, but we have to do something about that cut or they’ll become infected,” She said reassuringly, but also a little hurt when he winced as she waved her wand slowly across his face. </p><p>She could see his face twitch in pain, whether it was the sting of the spell binding the open cut or the anticipation of a greater pain, which he was probably used to, she didn’t know. </p><p>Stepping back, she managed a small smile, “I will let you know when I’ve spoken to the Headmaster. For right now, I think it would be best if you returned to your dorm and got some rest,” She advised, trying to maintain her composure.  </p><p>When Sirius Black walked out of her office, head still hung uncharacteristically low, she sat behind her desk, took a moment to breathe and thought of exactly what she would say to Albus. </p><p>_____________________________________________________</p><p>“That old toerag Orion Black does not deserve to be a father!” </p><p>Albus Dumbledore stood against his desk, hand stuffed in the pockets of his grey trousers, “Hello to you, too, Minerva,” said her senior, “Yes, I’m aware of Orion’s disdain of Sirius. He made it alarmingly clear when he demanded that Sirius be resorted all those years ago. I will write to the Ministry tonight.” </p><p>She ran an impatient hand down her face, “Albus, I’m not talking about merely resenting his son! He is using Sirius Black as target practice!” McGonagall nearly screeched. “Walked right out of my fireplace with fresh scars and bruises!” </p><p>Albus simply looked at her, with his typical curious expression. “What did you tell him?” </p><p>“I told him that I would speak to you.” </p><p>He blinked blankly at her, “Surely you also told him that we are required to report this to the Ministry of Magic?” </p><p>“Oh, now you are so concerned with following the rules. I did tell him, Albus,” She said, lowering herself to the sofa in his office, “But you know as well as I do that we are putting him in even more danger by involving the Ministry. The Black family is very well-connected.” </p><p>Albus rubbed his dark beard, “Yes, I do,” He said, sighing, “What do you suggest?”</p><p>“I have a contact at the Ministry from my stint there. Albus - do not look at me like that - I trust him with my life and I would not involve him if I did not trust him with Sirius Black’s.” </p><p>“Very well then,” He said, “But do keep me informed, Minerva.”</p><p>“You’ll know more as soon as I do.” With that, she returned to her office and started to address her letter to Fleamont Potter, James Potter’s father. As far as she was concerned, the ancient and noble house of Black could go to hell.</p>
