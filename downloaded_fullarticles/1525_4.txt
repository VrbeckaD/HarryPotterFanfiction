    <p>Every instinct is screaming at him to run, to get away from the thing in front of him and the cult that wants him dead. Towards the safety of the castle and his friends.</p><p>Instead he awaits his fate, following the winding and twisted path Albus Dumbledore set out for him. Trusting that, despite what Rita Skeeter wrote and what Aberforth said, Dumbledore chose the method that would minimise suffering, both his and others. Trusting that his death would help his friends kill the monster in front of him, who is currently ranting about something Harry stopped listening to a long time ago. Trusting that it was all worth it.</p><p>Harry holds onto this trust with every fibre of his being. And so, when he looks into the snake like eyes of the man in front of him, he is not afraid.</p><p>The monster lifts its arm. Long white fingers, almost dainty on the elder wand, produce sparks of magic that travel from them to the tip, building enough energy to end Harry’s life in a second. His red eyes are full of vicious triumph already, as if victory is already his, and Harry is nothing but calm as he remembers the piece of soul that will die with him.</p><p>Death is close now. Harry can feel his own magic responding reflexively, desperately trying to save him against the coming curse.</p><p>As time seems to slow to a fraction of its usual speed, Harry thinks what a pity it is that the last sound he will ever hear is a symphony of death eater’s jeering, and the last thing he’ll ever see is Voldemort’s ugly face. He makes a point to focus on the treeline, beautiful in the slowly rising sun. His ears latch onto the quieter sounds; the creek trickling through the undergrowth and the unmistakeable sound of an engine, evidently from a muggle village nearby. Calming things, for a calm transition to the other side.</p><p>Wait a second...</p><p>The nearest muggle village is at least fifty miles away, whereas Hogwarts is only a few meters away. Try as he might, he can’t hear any familiar voices from the school he misses so much, despite the fact it was a hive of activity when he left it minutes before.</p><p>The sound is getting closer.</p><p>As the incantation forms on Lord Voldemort’s tongue, the source of the noise crashes through the trees in a wave of blue.</p><p>It accelerates straight for the monster, and neither Voldemort nor his death eaters have time to retaliate before it hits. The crunch of metal on bone reverberates across the clearing, as the bonnet of what Harry now recognises as a car crumples, and the Dark Lord, Mr Evil incarnate, is flung into a tree.</p><p>Voldemort, suddenly very frail and almost human looking, crumples like a discarded crisp packet on the forest floor. Harry stares at the body of the man who was about to kill him, takes in the blood and odd angles, and can only form two coherent thoughts:</p><p>One, Arthur Weasley doesn’t mess around with the quality of his experiments.</p><p>And two, not even the most feared sorcerer of all time can survive a collision with a determined Ford Anglia.</p><p> </p>
