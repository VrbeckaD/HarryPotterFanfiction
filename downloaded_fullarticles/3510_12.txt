    <p>Harry lay on his back, rolling a tennis ball in his hands. Occasionally, he’d throw the ball into a gentle arc and catch it in his hands once again. A small radio on his dresser was turned all the way up. Harry was expertly rapping along, enjoying the dexterity in his tongue. At first, Harry had worried that Petunia would storm in and snatch his radio up, but his concern died when he realized that Dudley was playing music louder still in his room near the kitchen. Harry’s cousin was the proud owner of an incredible stereo that had the maximum volume of a medium-sized dinosaur.</p><p>
  <i>Yo, I'll tell you what I want, what I really really want.<br/>
So, tell me what you want, what you really really want.</i>
</p><p>Dudley was very trendy in his music taste. Or that was what Harry said to his face when Dudley caught him in the doorway the first time he had played such music.</p><p>“Get out, you git!” Dudley said, tossing a pillow in the vague direction of his own door.</p><p>Harry didn’t need to be told twice, and immediately went upstairs to set up his pilfered radio without a qualm.</p><p>And so Harry propped himself on his rickety twin bed with a ball that he’d grabbed from Dudley’s room.</p><p>
  <i>All of the controversy circles me, and it seems like the media immediately points a finger at me.</i>
</p><p>Harry took a moment to recall his previous year at Hogwarts and shuddered. Seamus was only the tip of the iceberg when it came to all the icey encounters he’d had in his fifth year. That would certainly improve in the upcoming year, following the events at the Ministry a few months back, but Harry would much prefer Sirius alive than a positive interaction with the student body at Hogwarts.</p><p>About an hour passed, Harry whiling away the time with the little radio. He was very much in his groove listening as he was. Harry had grown up an outsider, and it was certainly apparent that outsiders were those he most gravitates to.</p><p>Feeling spirited following his impressive delivery of the hour’s rap hits, Harry slipped into a jacket and headed out the Dursley’s back door. No one said goodbye to him.</p><p>Upon Harry’s arrival at Surbiton Station, a large group of evening commuters stepped onto a train and departed. Harry glimpsed a cafe that the train had previously obscured, and headed in its direction.</p><p>Harry spent about half an hour reading the Prophet and flirting lightly with a waitress when he saw Dumbledore.</p><p>---</p><p>Much later, Harry returned to Privet Drive on Dumbledore’s arm. Harry couldn’t imagine why Dumbledore would know that Muggle train stations don’t run in the middle of the night, and was more grateful than Dumbledore perhaps expected in return for a simple ride.</p><p>“Where in the devil have you been, boy?” Vernon asked from the couch. Petunia sat across from him, clutching at a fan agitatedly. Harry noticed that Dudley wasn’t home yet. His door lay open.</p><p>“The station,” Harry replied. He didn’t wait for his uncle to reply, and quickened up the stairs to his room. Shutting the door behind him, Harry strode to the dresser to turn the radio back on.</p><p>“Turn that down!” Vernon shouted through the ceiling, and Harry quickly turned the knob.</p><p>Harry sighed, and had a niggling sadness that Dumbledore deemed it too late to visit the Burrow. However, Dumbledore said he’d sent an owl to Arthur, and he’d be up in the morning for Harry. </p><p>---</p><p>Harry touched his broom fondly. He had just taken a remarkable fly around the pitch with Ron. They had been practicing for the upcoming Quidditch tryout.</p><p>“Thanks for that, mate. That last manoeuvre almost bloody unseated me,” Ron scoffed. He ripped his arm bands off and followed them with his sweaty shirt.</p><p>“Yeah, no problem, Ron. I fell off my own broom enough times. It’s only fair you get your share,” Harry said, voice dripping with sarcasm. Ron shoved at Harry and scoffed.</p><p>“Well, that’s real cheerful,” Ron said. The pair heard a girly squeak and turned to see Lavender running away from the mouth of the tent, braids swinging wildly.</p><p>Harry and Ron exchange a wide-eyed look and break into an easy laughter. Ron slung his arm over Harry’s shoulder, and the two marched into the castle.</p><p>As the boys were walking by one of the more deserted corridors, Harry caught a brief sight of Draco, and his eyes narrowed.</p><p>Harry remembers how he walked into the Great Hall late, <i>once again,</i> smelling like the underside of Malfoy’s shoe just last week. His uncomfortable ride to Hogwarts barely enlightened him, unless you consider Malfoy being unusually stoney and prickly enlightening. There was just something about the boy that made Harry want to pay close attention. So naturally, Harry kept an eye out for him everywhere.</p><p>“Did you see Malfoy just now?” Harry asked Ron, interrupting the boy’s heated dialogue about Fred and George’s new shop (<i>They wouldn’t give me a discount, Harry. I’m their brother!</i>).</p><p>“Yes. I swear, his father put him up to something. He won’t make eye-contact with anyone,” Ron said. “Except you, of course. He keeps stealing glances at you, you know.”</p><p>“The definition of ‘eye-contact’ implies that we are looking at one another simultaneously, Ron,” Harry says shiftily. He hopes no one has noticed his unusual obsession with Malfoy lately.</p><p>Harry has started to think about Malfoy. He wonders what the boy could be up to that is so important that Draco can afford to skip his final year of schooling for. More concerningly, he’s also been wondering about how he can approach Malfoy and rope him into a little bit of mischief. After all, they were rivals. Not that Harry seemed short of rivals or enemies these days. </p><p>Harry’s next month went by with a deceptive calm that reminded Harry of the beginning his third year. Dumbledore, Slughorn, and Half Blood Prince dominated his time. Hermione, Ginny, and Ron were likewise in high spirits, but for Hermione’s occasional moping for Ron’s lack of brain capacity.</p><p>“Don’t get me wrong, Ron is my best friend, but he must be really thick. It’s obvious that you have a crush on him. Even worse, it’s obvious he has a crush on you too.” Here Hermione nodded sadly. “You have to tell him,” Harry said, putting his book down on the table to look at her.</p><p>Hermione sighed and magiced her book back into its place. “I don’t know, Harry. What if he doesn’t like me? It’s possible he just… finds my skin nice. Or something. Please, don’t say anything to him,” she pleaded, hitting Harry with some of her best puppy dog eyes.</p><p>“Fine,” Harry said. “But you owe me. I want a backrub.”</p><p>And so when Hermione gave him a backrub in the Griffindor common room and Ron gawked at Hermione the entire time when she asked Harry if he liked that, Harry considered it a win.</p><p>And when Ron told him that he was fond of Hermione’s skin and voice later that night, Harry froze before he could burst into laughter. They really were perfect for each other. And so Harry went to sleep with a vague thought.</p><p>
  <i>Malfoy has nice skin.</i>
