<br/>
</p><p class="western">Doolin, Summer of 1999.</p><p class="western"><br/>
<br/>
</p><p class="western">Severus didn´t exactly expect it to be smooth sailing and blue skies, but bloody hell it was quite more than he had bargained for.</p><p class="western">Evelyn had given him fair warning. She had told him her mother could be rather...difficult. He hadn´t thought much of it. Parents and their grown children didn´t always see eye to eye and Severus knew both Evelyn and her mum had big personalities, So, he thought, it was natural that they disagreed and even clashed here and there.</p><p class="western">He was made aware that Evelyn´s mother wasn´t too keen on the idea of her dating anybody non Irish and non Catholic, which was something he could, up to a point, understand. Sophia Black´s grandfather had fought in the Irish War of Indepence so, no doubt she wasn´t told any fairytales about genteel English queens and princes growing up. He still found it a bit odd that for all her flag waving nationalism, Sophia had married the son of Englishman Marius Black, but the heart wants wat the heart wants.</p><p class="western">All and all, Severus Snape arrived in Doolin ready to face off a harmless Irish catholic widow who would probably be a bit grumpy about his presence in her house and that would be it. He could even picture her, knitting by the window or tending to her roses while going on about “children these days” and “the state of the world”.</p><p class="western">Hardly a fearsome adversary.</p><p class="western">Evelyn´s warnings that her mother was a “force to be reckoned with” were probably just the benign, humorous exaggeration of a daughter who had a few differences with her loving but strict mother. Nothing to worry about.</p><p class="western">Merlin, was he wrong.</p><p class="western">He hadn´t found a harmless grandmother spouting casually conservative platitudes, as he expected. Sophia Black , all of 5 feet of her (with heels on, it should be noted), was surprisingly intimidating.</p><p class="western">She welcomed them at the door, blonde hair coiffed à la Kim Novak in “Vertigo”, single string of pearls around her neck, matching earrings, wearing a crisp powder blue shirtwaist dress and white court shoes. She stood perfectly upright, chin up, hands clasped in front of her, like an illustration from an ettiquette manual. Severus could immediately tell who had taught (or rather trained) Evelyn how to dress, walk, sit and do her make up. Evelyn had probably failed the lessons on how to look down her nose at people upon first meeting, though.</p><p class="western">Evelyn looked almost nothing like her mother, except for the fact that both were beautiful women.</p><p class="western">Evelyn was a tall, buxom brunette while Sophia was a short, svelte blonde. But while she obviously favoured her father´s side of the family n looks, it was clear where Lyn had gotten her confidence and aplomb, not to mention the perfect set of cheekbones.</p><p class="western">The moment he stood before her, Severus could see Sophia´s icy blue eyes measure him from head to toe, without as much a feeble attempt at discretion. He didn´t need bother with legilimency to know she didn´t particularly like what she saw. Fair enough, he thought, he´d been called many things in his life time, but 'handsome' had never been one of them, he gave her that much. No offense taken.</p><p class="western">It was when they walked in that he realized he just might have been in for a bit of trouble.</p><p class="western">“Mam, why is great-grandpa´s rifle in the living room?!” he heard Evelyn say, alarmed, before he even had a chance to put his second foot through the the threshold.</p><p class="western">“Great-grandpa´s rifle” was the 1914 Mauser model 71 rifle Evelyn´s great-grandfather had used to raid the RIC barracks when he was as part of the 3<sup>rd</sup> Tippperary Brigade of the Irish Republican Army.</p><p class="western">The bloody thing was mounted on the wall above the mantle like a trophy.</p><p class="western">“Didn´t dad put that thing away years ago?” Evelyn sounded more than a bit aggravated, once the initial surprise wore off.</p><p class="western">Severus had to give it to her mother, that was just... brilliant.</p><p class="western">It was a strong opening statement, to welcome an Englishman into the house with an actual IRA rifle mounted right on the living room wall. The woman had style if anything.</p><p class="western">“He did, but I figured why leave it collecting dust in the attic. It´s a historical piece, after all.”</p><p class="western">“Then maybe we should donate it to a museum.”</p><p class="western">“Nonsense, Irish museums have more Mauser rifles than the Vatican has paintings of naked arses, my dear. This one belongs to our family. I´m sure Severus would want to know a bit more about the family history, after all.”</p><p class="western">“Mother, I swear...”</p><p class="western">“She´s right.” Severus interrupted her with a sly smile. “It is a...very interesting piece of historical memorabilia.”</p><p class="western">“And it still works.” Sophia added, without missing a beat.</p><p class="western">“I´m sure it does, Mrs. Black” he snickered. “I´m sure it does. It could probably take down another man or a few, I bet.”</p><p class="western">“Mausers are forever, my lad. If you two give me a moment, I´ll finish up the table so we can have some tea. Make yourself at home, Severus.”</p><p class="western">“I am so sorry, Sev.” Evelyn told him, mortified, when her mother was out of earshot “I bet she got Cillian to that thing up for her, like it would be quite the joke. I´ll have some words with him about enabling her like this...”</p><p class="western">“Shhh, love. Relax. It´s all perfectly fine.”</p><p class="western">“No, it´s not!”</p><p class="western">“I´ve dealt with worst, trust me.” he gave her a quick peck on the lips, before eyeing the rifle over the mantle “Genuinely curious, though..can your mother shoot that thing?”</p><p class="western">“She can, actually.”</p><p class="western">“Fascinating woman, your mother.” he grimaced “I like her already.”</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Her mother had behaved over tea. Somewhat.</p><p class="western">She mostly ignored Severus presence, as much as Evelyn tried to include him in the conversation, but at least she wasn´t rude to him. Evelyn looked at Severus and found him to be quite at ease, relaxed almost. He probably thought the rifle had been the end of it, and the rest of their stay would be normal.</p><p class="western">What he didn´t know was that her mother was saving the heavy artillery for when they had an audience.</p><p class="western">Evelyn´s sister and her two daughters had been invited for dinner. Her mother had planned to invite some more relatives to show Severus off for the oddity she seemed to think he was, or to find a way to make him unconfortable. She knew he was reserved and didn´t like crowds, Evelyn had told her over and over, but she seemed to wilfully ignore it. So Evelyn had to put her foot down and flat out demand that only Caitlin and the girls should be invited. It would be much to overwhelming for him to be introduced to their extended family on the first day, and she did want her sister and her daugthers to get a chance to meet him without all the fuss. Evelyn had stopped caring about her mother´s approval of any man she dated a while ago, but she needed Cat´s blessing, and any man she brought into her life would have to at least try and get along with her nieces. As much as Severus proclaimed not to like children, she knew he did at least have a protective streak when it came to them and Alice and Lizzie were dying to finally meet “aunt Linnie´s boyfriend.” She knew they´d get on just fine.</p><p class="western">The reduced size of the audience didn´t matter, however. As soon as they all sat down to eat, Sophia charged again.</p><p class="western">Over the course of the meal, Severus was interrogated about his current work situation, his education, his family, his religious background, political affiliation and everything else short of what color underwear he preferred. Caitlin tried to divert the conversation to lighter, more pleasant topics time and time again, aware of Evelyn´s silent unease, but Severus was having entire too much fun in antagonising her mother.</p><p class="western">Of course the pork roast was to his liking, he said. Which was marvelous because one of Sophia´s friends had raised the oh-so-valid concern that he might be Jewish. (Evelyn even knew exactly which one).</p><p class="western">No m´am, he said, not Jewish at all.</p><p class="western">“A life long atheist”</p><p class="western">Evelyn sighed.</p><p class="western">It would be a long evening.</p><p class="western"> </p>
<hr/><p class="western"><br/>
<br/>
</p><p class="western">Severus smiled, basking on the awkward silence that followed.</p><p class="western">“What´s an atheist?” Alice, Caitlin´s oldest daugher, a charmingly bright 6 year old, asked him, slightly mispronouncing the word.</p><p class="western">“Somebody who doesn´t believe in God.” Severus told her, unfettered.</p><p class="western">“How about angels?”</p><p class="western">“Nope, No God, no angels, no saints.”</p><p class="western">That wasn´t exactly true. Severus was not religious at all, but he never gave the idea of God´s existence enough tought to truly claim being a commited atheist, which, to be honest, seemed like putting too much effort into something he barely thought about on a daily basis. The look on Sophia´s face was worth the over simplification though. Maybe he should twist the knife a little.</p><p class="western">“I did consider Wicca for a while.” he lied with a straight face. There were Wiccan wizards (as much as there were christian, hindu, jewish or muslim wizards, to be sure), but Severus most definitely wasn´t and had never been one of them</p><p class="western">“What´s Wicca?” Alice, Merlin bless her and her beutifully curious mind, asked again.</p><p class="western">“Witchcraft, darling.” Caitlin answered, giving him a complicit wink, as Sophia near choked on her wine. Alice looked at him with wide eyed wonder.</p><p class="western">“Not to be confused with Satanism, of course.” Severus continued gleefuly, knowing it would pick Alice´s interest enough for her to ask. Evelyn looked at him as if she was about to reach across the table to choke him.</p><p class="western">“Wha...”Alice started but Sophia switched the subject before she had a chance to finish the question.</p><p class="western">Shame, Severus thought, to deny a child´s legitimate thirst for knowledge.</p><p class="western">The conversation moved on as Severus dodged question after question, a smile on his lips, trying his best to pick the answer that would most infuriate Sophia, but taking care to phrase it in the most elegant and polite words he could find, so she would not have a legitimate reason to be furious.</p><p class="western">Yes, he was currently employed. Oh, yes, government position, good stability, but doesn´t necessarily pay that well, isn´t it true?</p><p class="western">“Sure, the pay could better, of course. But then again I´m just a scholar, wasn´t your husband a teacher, surely you know how it is.”</p><p class="western">One of Evelyn´s exes is making quite a profit with his new business, by the way.</p><p class="western">“That´s wonderful, Mrs. Black, must be nice opening a business to so little competition, good on the lad, fortunate enough to get a first loan from his father, I´ve heard. Very good for him indeed.”</p><p class="western">Well, it´s not very appropriate to talk about money matters at the table.</p><p class="western">“Definitely Mrs. Black, say, what´s your opinion on the Belfast agreement? Some people are saying it´s the end of the IRA.”</p><p class="western">Evelyn almost missed his foot when she kicked him under the table for that one.</p><p class="western"> </p>
<hr/><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">They walked back to the house hand in hand after escorting Caitlin and the girls home.</p><p class="western">Cat lived a couple blocks down the street, and it was still early, so they had decided to stay a little longer for a couple drinks. Caitlin put the girls to bed and opened a bottle of Evelyn´s favorite rosé. The three of them sat outside in the garden and had a good laugh about all the nonsense that transpired during dinner. Then Cat offered Severus some valuable advice on how to deal with their mother.</p><p class="western">“Nod and smile. Whatever you do, just let her think she´s calling the shots. It´s how dad did it.”</p><p class="western">It was true. Their father, God rest his soul, was probably the most collected, serene man to have walked the earth. Whenever their mother decided to be difficult all he did was take a step back and allow her to get it out of her system, then return when she was done so they work it out calmly. Evelyn had seen him truly lose his temper with her mother maybe once her whole life. And that time it had been entirely Evelyn´s fault.</p><p class="western">Caitlin was a lot like their father in that way. Evelyn looked like him, but Cat had his way of taking everything in stride. In fact, Evelyn almost forgot Severus had been a bit of a wanker over dinner.</p><p class="western">But surely enough they had to talk about it on the way back</p><p class="western">“Well, dinner sure was something...” she said, quietly</p><p class="western">“I found it to be quite...successful.”</p><p class="western">“Oh, did you. Let me see, you told my mother you´re an atheist with wiccan and satanist proclivities, you gave her sass the whole evening and your idea of pleasant dinner conversation is asking charged questions about Irish-British relations to a woman who welcomed you in her house with an IRA gun mounted on the wall. Yes, quite successful, I´d say.”</p><p class="western">“I told you I liked your mother. She´s an absolute riot. I had buckets of fun.”</p><p class="western">“You´re fecking impossible. I don´t know which one of you two is worse.”</p><p class="western">“If I were to bet I say the one with the rifle” he laughed.</p><p class="western">“For what´s worth she doesn´t really have anything against jewish people.”</p><p class="western">“Really? I´d never guess...”</p><p class="western">“One of her stupid church friends made that joke when they saw a picture of us I sent Cat.”</p><p class="western">“It was the nose, right? It´s always the nose.”</p><p class="western">“Knowing her she probably thought she´s throw it in just for the chance of annoying you regardless of wether you were Jewish or not. Same with the malarkey about your job and everything else. She´s just trying anything to see what sticks.”</p><p class="western">“She likes pushing people´s buttons is what you´re trying to say.”</p><p class="western">“She does. Which is why I was expecting you two would get along, you have that in common.”</p><p class="western">They found her mother waiting for them in the living room when they walked in, sitting on the couch, in her flowery robe, glasses on, a book in one hand and a cup of tea in the other and an open box of chcolates on the coffee table. Evelyn was surprised she didn´t put the soundtrack for “The Godfather” on, for added effect.</p><p class="western">“There you two are. I almost thought you´d stay over at Cat´s. I figure you´d be tired and want to turn in a little early tonight, so your bedrooms are ready.” she informed them, looking over her book.</p><p class="western"> </p>
<hr/><p class="western"><br/>
<br/>
</p><p class="western">Evelyn sighed as if she had been through this before. Severus needed a moment to get it...“bedrooms”. Bedrooms. Plural. One for each. Of course it shouldn´t be a surprise that Sophia would put them in separate rooms even though they were both adults who had been living with each other for a good while. Of course she would.</p><p class="western">“You´ll stay in your old room as always, Linnie, and I´ve prepared the guest room for Severus. It´s the last one down the hall.”</p><p class="western">“Mother...”</p><p class="western">“Evelyn, I´d like to have a word with you in private, if Severus doesn´t mind, of course.”</p><p class="western">Severus tried not to laugh too loud as he went upstairs and he closed the door to his room behind himself. At age 39. he had just been sent to his room as if he was a child. It was so ridiculous he didn´t find it in him to be annoyed. That Sophia needed some time alone to talk to her daughter was entirely understandable, but the way she had all but told him to go to his room as if she would do a little boy, was quite something.</p><p class="western">He sighed and decided it was for the best to just put on his pajamas, get into bed with a good book and call it a day.</p><p class="western">Severus had tested his luck enough for the time being. It was probably better to heed to Mrs Black´s whims for now, and try and behave. After all, they´d be there for a couple weeks only, it would all be over soon, so there was no need to complicate things for himself.</p><p class="western"><br/>
<br/>
</p>
<hr/><p class="western"><br/>
<br/>
</p><p class="western">“So, what do you want to talk about?” Evelyn started, taking a seat on her father´s favorite armchair. “I hope you´re going to apologize for how you treated him.”</p><p class="western">“I don´t trust this man.” Her mother answered, casually, almost as if she was telling her they had run out of sugar.</p><p class="western">“You don´t...you...” Evelyn took a deep breath, trying not to lose her temper “Mother, you welcome him with a rifle on the wall, and has to gall of saying you don´t trust him? Why? Because he´s not Catholic? Not Irish? English? Jesus, it´s not 1916, anymore.”</p><p class="western">“None of that!” she waved her hand, dismissively “He´s hiding something.”</p><p class="western">“Excuse me?”</p><p class="western">“I´m telling you, pet. I know when a man is not being truthful and that one? That one looks like he´s a habitual liar. You can tell by looking at him.”</p><p class="western">“That´s preposterous.”</p><p class="western">“Where did he get that scar? And that horrible tatoo on his arm.”</p><p class="western">“He got the scar in an accident, and the tatoo is some stupid teenage shenanigans.”</p><p class="western">“He´s shifty, that one. You can see it in the way he behaves. And how smug, how evasive he is, it´s like he´s...”</p><p class="western">“Good night, mam.” she bolted out of her seat. As she walked past her mother , however, she felt her hand touch hers.</p><p class="western">“Evelyn, no. Don´t go just yet.”</p><p class="western">“If you´re going to continue with this...”</p><p class="western">“I won´t. I won´t. Sit here” she patted the space beside her “Let´s talk about something else, then.”</p><p class="western"> </p>
<hr/><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">After what felt like a little over an hour Severus noticed the lights in the rest of the house were turned off and he heard the sound of steps coming up the stairs, doors opening and closing and Evelyn´s voice wishing her mother good night. He looked at the clock on his bedside table.</p><p class="western">Midnight.</p><p class="western">Too early for him, but he probably should try to sleep. He was sure either Evelyn or Mrs Black would want him to be up early the next day for whatever reason. He was tired enough that he could use the rest, anyway.</p><p class="western">He put the book on the side table and turned off the light.</p><p class="western">As he was on the brink of dozing off he heard the sound of the door cracking open. Before he could reach for the light, he felt the mattress cave under the weight of somebody sitting on his side.</p><p class="western">“Lyn?”</p><p class="western">“I thought I´d find you awake.” she turned the light on.</p><p class="western">She had changed into a nightgown. A long white cotton, shapeless thing with some cutesy Irish lace details. Something her grandmother may have wore to bed back in the day. Not at all like the sleek and sensuous silk nightgowns she wore to go to bed with him back home. Severus found it funny that she felt the need to put on this demure, near virginal outfit on to go to bed, just because she was back in her childhood home.</p><p class="western">Truth to be told, however, it didn´t look bad on her. It didn´t look bad on her at all, he thought, noticing how the light of the lamp made the fabric look sheer, and how nicely the white lace constrasted with her summer tan.</p><p class="western">“I was about to fall asleep” he sat up “ you and your mother took forever down there.”</p><p class="western">“Sorry. About everything.”</p><p class="western">“Did she do this with every man you ever brought home or is it just me?”</p><p class="western">“Every last one. But before my father was here to reign her in a little. Actually I think that´s part of the reason she´s being so hard on you. You´re the first boyfriend I bring home since dad passed away, and...I don´t know...It´s like life moved on without him, and she can´t quite accept it.” she shrugged</p><p class="western">“What were you two talking about all this time?”</p><p class="western">“This and that” she trailled off.</p><p class="western">“You´re a terrible liar, love, and you know it. Come on...how bad did I screw this all up?” he smiled, pushing her hair behind her ear.</p><p class="western">“You didn´t.”</p><p class="western">“She just doesn´t like me, then.”</p><p class="western">“She doesn´t trust you. She thinks you´re hiding something.”</p><p class="western">“She´s right... I am. WE are. Your mother is not stupid, and she seems to know you like the back of her hand. And she didn´t do that bad of a job in reading me, it seems. I´m telling you, I´m starting to admire her.”</p><p class="western">“Will we tell her, one day? I mean, can we?”</p><p class="western">“We can, eventually. Maybe we should, even. Muggles deserve to know when they have magical family members. Your brother was a wizard, she deserves to know what happened to him. And if there´s the possibility of her having a magical grandchild, then all the more reason for her to know. Your sister too. There´s ways to go about it.”</p><p class="western">“It just seems so...so much. I still haven´t taken it all in myself...”</p><p class="western">“Come here...”</p><p class="western">Severus pushed the covers away and pulled her to his chest, resting his cheek on the top of her head to breath in the scent of her hair. Evelyn relaxed, melting into him. He ran his hand down the curve of her hip, feeling bare skin, firm flesh under the soft white cotton.</p><p class="western">Irish summers were not particularly hot, and the night outside was quite clear and pleasant, a soft cool breeze making its way in from the sea...yet Severus started to feel a little too hot.</p><p class="western">He shivered when her hand snuck under his shirt and she dragged her nails lightly down his abdomen, scrtaching ever so slightly. Then she shifted and her breath was on his neck, ticklish and warm.</p><p class="western">“I´m sorry to interrupt...”</p><p class="western">Severus couldn´t believe his ears...really? REALLY?</p><p class="western">Of course, of course she was standing right at this bedroom door, in the dark like a damned ghost.</p><p class="western">Of course she was.</p><p class="western">“Linnie, would be a dear and go fetch my medicine from the kitchen. I must have forgotten.”</p><p class="western">“You couldn´t go yourself?” Evelyn asked, pleadingly.</p><p class="western">“You know I get terrible vertigo if I have to get up after I´ve turned in for the night.I don´t quite trust going down the stairs.”</p><p class="western">“Go...” Severus told her, defeated, rubbing one of her slumped shoulders.</p><p class="western"> </p>
<hr/><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">That was just the beginning of it all.</p><p class="western">Sophia seemed hellbent on not allowing the two of them a moment of peace and quiet, just the two of them.</p><p class="western">Evelyn had, of course, decided to take him to all the places there were to see in Doolin. They had been to the pubs, the stores, the beaches, they had taken boat rides and visited the caves and cliffs. She had told him stories of her childhood and shown him the places where she used to play, where she had fallen off her bike for the first time, where she learned to swim, the tree under which she had her first kiss.</p><p class="western">It was sweet, comforting and nostalgic, and it felt as if they were closer than ever before.</p><p class="western">But the moment they stepped back into the house her mother found a way to snatch her back from him, Any excuse would do. She needed to go shopping, she needed help in the kitchen, she was having dizzy spells, she had something important to talk about in private...at any given moment the would be <b>something</b>, anything, she needed Evelyn for.</p><p class="western">Then, at the end of the day, they would each go to their respective room like mischievous little children who needed to be kept separate so they wouldn´t get in trouble. Invariably, her mother would feel 'a wee under the weather', and have sudden bouts of insomnia. Severus wouldn´t put past Mrs Black to actually be listening in to make sure neither one was sneaking into each other´s room in the middle of the night. And neither would Evelyn, at this point.</p><p class="western">In the first two or three days, Severus forced himself to let it all go. He didn´t say anything, and he surely didn´t make any attempt to try and break the “curfew”. He, quite mistakenly, thought if he 'behaved adequately', Mrs Black would eventually relent, but as the days passed she showed no sign of change whatsoever. Evelyn knew better thant that. She knew that when her mother got something in her head, there was no amount of “nodding and smiling” that would get her to relent. She would stop when she wanted to stop.</p><p class="western">It had been amusing enough at first. Sneaking up on each in the kitchen or in her father´s old study to have a stolen few minutes alone, a few moments of stolen kisses and chaste carresses was not at all unpleasant. It felt as if they were kids again.</p><p class="western">There was something almost...exhilarating about it.</p><p class="western">They had a backyard full of stunning rosebushes, that grew around an apple tree. It was a ancient, venerable tree that had stood there since before the house was built. It stood tall and luxuriant, bearing flower and fruit every year without fail. Evelyn´s father had hung a wooden swing from the sturdiest of it´s branches for her and her siblings to play, and on warmer summer days, she would put a picnic towel under it so she could read under its sweet shade. Now the old apple tree that had sheltered her from the sun and rain as she grew up became a refuge for their quick encounters. On the excuse of seeking shade to protect themselves from the oh-so-inclement Irish summer sun, they´d sit under the tree and snogg like randy, lovesick teenagers.</p><p class="western">It was fun...but soon it was not enough.</p><p class="western"><br/>
<br/>
</p>
<hr/><p class="western"><br/>
<br/>
</p><p class="western">As quaint and delightful as it was, that little roleplay of hiding from mummy dearest, by the fifth day, Severus was crawling up the walls with frustration and pent up lust. He knew Evelyn wasn´t faring much better, but she did a better job of hiding than he did. Severus was slowly getting testy, aggravated and moody. Getting himself to fall asleep at night became a chore.</p><p class="western">When all the lights in the house went out at the end of the sixth day, he lay wide awake in bed.</p><p class="western">“Fuck this, fuck all of this.” he hissed, mumbling to himself, kicking the covers and heading downstairs as quietly as he could. He knew Mrs. Black kept a bottle of her best whiskey stashed away in the kitchen cabinet. By God, if the woman could deprive him of Evelyn, he would at least put a good dent on her prized Irish whiskey.</p><p class="western">“You came for the whiskey, right?”</p><p class="western">He found Evelyn sitting on the kitchen table, feet dangling above the floor, hair pulled up in a mess that vaguely resembled a bun, the pristine white nightgown hoisted up above her thick, lush thighs, the lacy straps falling so dangerously low about her shoulders her breasts were almost bare. It took Severus a moment to register the fact that she had an open tub of Ben&amp;Jerry´s ice cream on her lap, a spoon in her hand and, on the table next to her, a glass full of ice and her mother´s prized bottle of whiskey, open.</p><p class="western">“Whiskey? What whiskey?” he grinned hungrily.</p><p class="western">“The glasses are on the cupboard behind you.” she said, visibly amused by his reaction.</p><p class="western">Severus collected his thoughts and summoned a glass and some ice.</p><p class="western">“Get a spoon too.” she suggested, pointing to a drawer, and her voice was filled with an excitement he only ever heard from students sneaking out of their dorms for snogging sessions in one of the vacant storerooms.</p><p class="western">“No, I´m good.” he smiled</p><p class="western">“You sure? I don´t usually share ice cream.”</p><p class="western">“I can think of a few more interesting things to do than eat ice cream.” he finished his drink in a single gulp and went to her, so he could caress the side of her leg, from knee to hip.</p><p class="western">“Oh, can you really?”</p><p class="western">Her voice did that thing, that low, guttural, raspy drop it did when she got aroused, and Severus knew whatever shred of respect he had for her mother and her ridiculous rules had just shattered. Without even thinking he stood between her parted legs, grabbed the tube of ice cream from her hands, threw it in the sink, then gave her a devouring, demanding kiss.</p><p class="western">Her tongue tasted of vanila, chocolate and need.</p><p class="western"> </p>
<hr/><p class="western"><br/>
<br/>
</p><p class="western">“Where was this enthusiasm over the past few nights?” she joked, biting his lower lip “My bedroom is across the hallway, you know?”</p><p class="western">“And Mother superior´s bedroom is right next to yours. She was too eager to inform me that old mauser still works, so I´m not taking my chances.”</p><p class="western">“Don´t tell me you´re scared of her? The man who lied to the...how was it that you called him again...the 'Dark Lord'...” Even now that she had seen magic with her own eyes and had read the newspapers talking about the things Severus did, it still felt surreal to talk about it, as if it was part of their normal coexistence.</p><p class="western">“Unlike your mother, the Dark Lord could occasionaly be reasoned with.” he told her, claiming her lips again, before she could come up with a clever answer.</p><p class="western"><br/>
<br/>
</p>
<hr/><p class="western"><br/>

</p><p class="western">Nights in the countryside are eerily quiet, more than he was used to in the mostly abandoned Spinner´s End. All he could hear outside was the occasional cricket, and in the stillness of the night their laboured breath, the soft rustle of their clothes as they pushed them out of the way without quite taking them off and the wet sucking and licking of lips on lips and lips on skin sounded much louder than it was supposed to be.</p><p class="western">Severus couldn´t be bothered to care. Her thighs around his waist pulled him in, he had no idea where the old, beat up Joy Division t-shirt he slept in had been thrown and his pajama pants were half way down his arse.</p><p class="western">With his luck, he wouldn´t be surprised if they were caught right in the middle of it (did Mrs. Black even sleep, he wondered), and it would certainly be wise to either stop or at least make haste, but he, quite honestly didn´t give a damn.</p><p class="western">Evelyn´s lips and teeth were all over his neck, his colarbone, her fingers digging into the flesh of his buttocks, pulling him to her. She had scooted closer, so dangerously close to edge of the table he could feel the slick arousal sliding, grinding against the underside of his fully erect cock.</p><p class="western"> </p>
<hr/><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Evelyn knew just how to get him. For all his self-control, Severus was surprisingly easy to tempt. She found it downright adorable that he had been trying to 'behave' and not give her mother reason to complain, but she knew he had been on the edge for days now, and anything would set him off. She was counting on it, in fact.</p><p class="western">It hadn´t been planned on her part to come down to the kitchen in the middle of the night. She would have slipped him a note under his door if it had been. But the moment he stepped in, tousled from tossing and turning in bed, wearing her favorite Joy Division t-shirt, the one that used to hang lose on him but had been getting just a little snug, and the grey flannel pajama trousers that barely disguised the fact that he had forgone underwear, she knew what they´d end up doing. At least she knew what she wanted to do.</p><p class="western">Ever the gentleman, however, he was trying to go slow, to show her the sweet courtesy of proper foreplay. At this point it was all it was...a courtesy. They had been engaging in nothing but foreplay for days now. They´d been all over each other at any precious few minutes alone they could steal. Evelyn had lost track of how many times she had been worked up to the point of plain arousal only to be left wanting because her mother found a way to interrupt.</p><p class="western">No, she thought, pulling his hips into hers, digging her nails on his bare arse and running her tongue across his jaw. She had foreplay, quite enough of it. She needed him now. She was ready for it.</p><p class="western">Severus hissed and the tight, wiry muscles under his heated skin jolted under the palms of her hands. His hips pressed down on her, his breath hitched and his cock hard.</p><p class="western"> </p>
<hr/><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“Fuckin´tease” he whispered, sinking his teeth on her shoulder.</p><p class="western">“We don´t have all night, you know?” she giggled, putting her arms around his shoulders and pushing his head down, to rest on the softness of her breasts.</p><p class="western">Severus would have loved to take his time. The idea of making a slow, debauched feast out of her, sprawled on her mother´s kitchen table, the precious kitchen table where she made her precious family recipes, was too enticing. He would love nothing more than to sprawl her across the table, every luscious, delectable bit of her, and take his time, run his lips across every inch of skin, every little crevice and curve of hers, make her come on his tongue and taste it.</p><p class="western">But they didn´t have time. Mrs. Black was a light sleeper he´d noticed, and he wouldn´t be at all surprised if she simply sprouted out of the kitchen floor like a demon summoned out of hell. Part of him almost wished she did, if anything out of sheer spite. Yes, Mrs. Black, I´m about to fuck your daughter right here on your sacred kitchen table and she´s going to enjoy every second of it, and there´s not a single bloody thing you can do about it.</p><p class="western">A shiver went up his spine and he felt the heat under his skin burn like a furnace. Severus almost didn´t recognise the low, hissing growl he produced in the back of his throat as a noise he was even capable of producing.</p><p class="western">Evelyn let out the tiniest little yelp when he pulled her off the table by the hips and turned her around, nudging her legs apart with his knee. He could tell it was taking all she had to keep quiet. She was always so loud. And he loved it that she was loud, scandalous. But to see her so quiet, almost suffering to keep her voice down....it was oddly arousing...In the semi darkness he could see her bite on of her knuckles, forcing herself not to moan when he was finaly inside of her.</p><p class="western"> </p>
<hr/><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Evelyn loved to feel the weight of him crushing her. He knew she did. He knew she loved it when he manhandled her and spun her around like a rag doll. Being vulnerable, handing over control to him, Severus knew it got her off. She almost screamed when he spun her around and pushed her back, filling her in one smooth thrust. This is what she wanted and he gave it to her. Hard and heavy like that.</p><p class="western">Evelyn knew she couldn´t make a single noise. In a way, it made it more exciting. The challenge of it. The thrill of hiding, the fear of being caught. She was sure Severus felt it too.</p><p class="western">Severus usual style of love making was controled and calculated. He liked the teasing, he took pleasure in the drawn out, elaborated display of technique, on taking his time and building up the pleasure little by little.</p><p class="western">There was none of that on the way his fingers dug into her flesh, and his breath burned hot on her neck.</p><p class="western">Severus´ usual style was lovemaking. This? No, this was fucking.</p><p class="western">And he did it just as well.</p><p class="western"> </p>
<hr/><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">It was all a dizzy blur when his body started to move on instinct, roughly, thrusting and rutting into her. Severus didn´t think, he didn´t care. He finaly had her, and that was all there was to it. No teasing, no method or control. No foreplay, and sweet, naughty endearments. Just fuck. Just do it fast and do it now, before something spoils it.</p><p class="western">He leaned in, resting his forehead on the back of her neck, his nose inhaling lavender and his tongue tasting sweat. He heard Evelyn laugh softly, quietly, as she raised her head and looked back at him, He grabbed her by the neck and pulled her for a kiss, huffing and moaning inside her mouth.</p><p class="western">It took nothing for him to forget where he was. There was nothing around him other than Evelyn´s scent, her taste, the way she felt beneath him, around him. Nothing at all but her, her mouth, her warmth and the sheer bliss of being inside of her.</p><p class="western">He lost himself in it.</p><p class="western">Big mistake.</p><p class="western">If he hadn´t lost himself to his own pleasure, Severus might have remembered ther were a a bottle and two glasses sitting right on the table they were violently shaking in their feverish enthusiasm,</p><p class="western">Then Severus learned that the sound of glass shattering on the floor is particularly loud when it happens to occur in the middle of the night, in a house in the quiet Irish countryside and the mother of the woman you happen to be shagging is sleeping right upstairs.</p><p class="western">“Well, there goes my mother´s whiskey.”</p><p class="western"> </p>
