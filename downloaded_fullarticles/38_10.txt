  <span class="s1"> <b>Episode 1:</b> </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Severus scowled at the clumsy ginger operating the large camera that was focusing on him and the other two gingers framing him like bookends on the little set they have set up for interviews. This place was seriously overrun with red hair and freckles. He supposed he shouldn’t be surprised, it was Molly Weasley’s show, it would make sense to employ some of her huge brood. Molly Weasley, the beloved face of British homemaking, what would be more quaint than making her latest venture a family affair. Severus tried desperately not to sneer at the camera.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">The camera must, finally, be ready to go because the ginger behind the camera gave a thumbs up at one of the ones sitting well within Severus’ personal bubble. <br/></span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“So, Mr. Snape...” One redhead starts, only to be interrupted by his twin.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“You mean, dear brother, Professor Snape. You are a chemistry professor, are you not?”<br/></span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Severus opens his mouth to answer but is beaten to a ready once by the first twin.<br/></span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Ah, but of course, thank you for correcting me, George. So, Professor Snape, what brings a leader in the chemistry field to our humble little competition?”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Could it be for the fame?”<br/></span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“The glory?”<br/></span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“The chance to meet our dear mum, the infamous Molly Weasley?”<br/></span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Severus waited with a raised eyebrow, refusing to look like a fool watching a tennis match trying to watch as the twins bantered back and forth. He had watched as a few of his competitors had held their interviews, while he had been avoiding a rather determined young ginger woman armed with a makeup kit who was adamant that he needed to be made ‘camera ready’. Severus was not going to allow that to happen. <br/></span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“I compete for the money. As illustrious as research and teaching my be, the pay is not sufficient for my future plans. Thus, I will win this competition.” Severus said, cool and collected. <br/></span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“That is some confidence!”<br/></span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“But how do you feel about competing against your own godson?”<br/></span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Ah, yes, Draco Malfoy is your godson! How could I have forgotten that George?”<br/></span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“I don’t know, Fred. I mean we have it written right here on our note cards.”<br/></span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Are you nervous that you could damage your relationship with your godson by competing against him?”<br/></span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Severus waited for them to again stop their bantering before answering, “Draco will be strong competition since he has been attending culinary school for a few years now. But I am the one that taught him to cook, so I am not overly concerned. He is my godson, but that will not impede my ability to do what must be done.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Well best of luck to you, Professor. And now, George, let us go see if our final judge has arrived.”<br/></span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Ah, yes, our dear prince should be done getting mauled by our sweet little sister in makeup by now.” And with that the twins were off, followed by the brother with the camera. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Severus stood and wound his way back to the rows of work stations in the large studio space. Arriving at the station that was designated as his, Severus started to familiarize himself with the layout, making sure he knew where each and every utensil was stored. He had already done so in the rooms that housed the larger kitchen gadgetry, the dishes and bakeware, and the pantry. It seemed that this industry had a lot of ‘hurry up and wait’ situations. Rushing people though makeup, getting everyone set up with their microphones, then a lot of waiting around. Most of the other contestants were mingling around the snack table set up to the side…a place that Severus had no inclination to visit. Right now everyone was simpering about the arrival of the prince and Severus did not simper. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Severus unrolled his knives and set to work sharpening them, letting his mind quiet with the repetitive motion. There were people bustling around, setting up equipment and lights, but Severus was his own quiet island. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">

  </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Can I hide here?” A quiet voice interrupted Severus’ peace.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Severus glanced up from his gleaming blade to see a short man in a hoodie, the hood pulled low, leaning against his work station. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">With a snort of derision, Severus focused back on his knives. It would be beyond foolish to focus one's attention away from the sharp blades, no matter how deeply ingrained the motions of sharpening his tools were to his muscle memory. “If you are trying to get out of your work by lounging about over here, know that I do not take well to loafishness.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“No, no, I just don’t feel like falling into Ginny’s clutches today. She is determined that eyeliner is going to be a good look for me and I don’t think I can dissuade her.” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Severus chuckled, a rare occurrence that. Placing down his current knife and beginning on the next without looking up, he did feel inclined to commiserate, “I had a similar experience. She started at mutter something about bronzer and blush, suffice it to say I made a hasty retreat.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">The other man laughed softly, “I like your strategy of hiding in plain sight. Seems effective.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Severus felt the corner of his mouth twitch up, “You gathered what I was up to?”<br/></span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“I think your waving around deadly implements was another demotivating factor.” <br/></span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“You could go ready some knives as well, keep the gingers at bay.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Oh, I don’t think so. No amount of pointy knives will save me from them. They know I am more likely to cut off a finger by mistake and would instantly come to save me from my impending self-mutilation.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“You seem to have chosen the wrong profession if you are liable to maim yourself with your most vital instruments.” Severus finished sharpening, wiping each blade carefully and returning it to its place. It was rare for Severus to enjoy banter with anyone and he hoped this guy would stick around a while in the competition. He turned to the man, still leaning against the cooking station, face in shadow from his angle and the bright stage lights that illuminated each workstation, but still produced dramatic lighting for the cameras. He was quite short, only reaching Severus’ shoulder, and looked quite thin, from what could be seen beneath his overlarge hoodie and jeans. <br/></span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">A slightly dark chuckle came from beneath the hood, “I fear I did not have much of a choice when it came to picking a profession. But alas, no point complaining about the hands we are dealt.”  <br/></span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Indeed, we all can only do so much within the constraints of our circumstances, but I do feel that we tend to see more limits than actually exist. We do have the power to build a place for ourselves inside our own lives.”<br/></span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“I like that,” The man’s soft voice had lost its dark edge, “That is what I need to do, build a place for myself in my own life.”<br/></span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Severus nodded, “It can be a difficult task.”<br/></span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">There was a buzzing from the man’s pocket and with a sigh he pulled out his phone, reading the alert on his screen, “I suppose my hiding is done. I am being summoned to change before they shoot some opening scenes.”<br/></span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Well it was a pleasure conversing with you, I look forward to doing so again.”<br/></span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">There was a self-deprecating snort from behind the hood, “I enjoyed myself as well, but I very much doubt you will want to again.”<br/></span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Severus was puzzled, while true he normally loathed inane chatter, he had liked talking with the young man and it seemed that the other had as well. “If this is about the competition, I assure you I can compartmentalize any competitive impulses.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“No, people just always put on an act with me. It is alright though, I don’t know how much judges are supposed to socialize with the contestants off-camera anyway.” And with that, the man turned and looked up at Severus. <br/></span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Severus was a master of control, it was something that he prided himself upon. But despite that he only just kept himself from gasping and could do nothing to stop his eyes from widening. He had himself back under control a moment later, his mind quickly reprocessing the information he had gathered about the man from before. <br/></span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Should I bow, your highness, or would that blow your cover?” He smirked, figuring that the man he just met would appreciate their conversation flowing on the same wavelength that it already had thus far. <br/></span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">It was the young prince’s turn to blink in surprise, then a grin split his pretty face. “No please don’t…and Harry is fine in the present company. I still am not a fan of all the formality.”<br/></span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Severus nodded in acceptance. The story of the country’s long lost prince, found and returned to fortune in his teens, is known by all. Kind, soft-spoken, and beautiful, beloved by the people. Obviously there was more to the prince than most people acknowledged, but Severus found that to be the case about many things. People rarely accepted that people were multifaceted beings that were often more than they appeared.<br/></span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“I am not a fan of social conventions myself unless I can use them to my advantage.” Severus agreed.<br/></span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Harry laughed, his large green eyes dancing behind his glasses, “Maybe you could provide me lessons then. I seem to find myself at the mercy of convention all too frequently.”<br/></span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“I may be a teacher by trade, but I don’t particularly enjoy that profession.”<br/></span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Harry blinked up at him slowly, his hood tipping back off his messy hair, “What if I promised to be a very good student?”<br/></span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Severus was normally quite adept at reading people, picking up clues from body language and speech patterns. Most of the time Severus would use this to cut people down to size, find their weaknesses and crush them…The point was, he was good at reading between the lines and every instinct that he had was telling him that Harry was flirting. <br/></span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Severus was not accustomed to flirting, much less coming from royalty, but then again Harry was not your traditional royal, “I could probably find the time for one student, even after I do win this competition and leave the profession behind.”<br/></span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“That would be most generous of you.” At some point they had drifted closer to each other and Severus could smell his fresh scent, surprisingly lemony with hints of mint and ginger.<br/></span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Your highness!” A gleeful call made Harry jump and whirl to see the determined red-haired girl approaching, makeup case in hand.<br/></span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“No, Ginny, no!” <br/></span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">The woman gave a truly horrifying cackle, “I am only asking a little eyeliner, not like when we were kids and you let me test out my first kit.”<br/></span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Dear Lord, do those pictures still exist? Can I have them destroyed by royal decree?”<br/></span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“I don’t think Mum would be happy about that, it would ruin the flow of the family photo album.” Harry sighed dramatically and Severus couldn’t contain his snort of amusement.<br/></span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Harry turned to him a blush suffusing his cheeks and spreading down his neck, “Any chance you can pretend you didn’t hear any of that?”<br/></span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Severus raises an eyebrow, “I most assuredly will not, but if it makes you feel better, I will provide you with equilateral blackmail material at another time when we are ensconced in private.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Harry perked up, “Oh and you believe that that is a possibility? Us being ensconced in private?”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“That seems a distinct possibility.” Severus didn’t miss the fact that his own voice had deepened, and that in response the pupils of Harry’s eyes dilated. <br/></span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Okay…” Ginny said awkwardly, eyes bouncing in between the two, “I am going to wait right over there, and if you aren’t there in two minutes, Harry, I am coming and dragging you away by your ear.”<br/></span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Harry nodded vaguely in her direction, his focus remaining on Severus, “I guess I really do have to get going. I don’t want to make everyone wait on me.”<br/></span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“It was a pleasure, Harry, and I truly hope that we will speak again.”<br/></span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Harry grinned and nodded, then his face flushed, “Um could I ask...I don’t know your name.”<br/></span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Severus blinked and had to will himself not to flush himself, “Forgive me, my name is Severus. Severus Snape.”<br/></span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Nothing to forgive, it isn’t like I introduced myself properly. I can barely even remember all my new names anyway. I hate it, I sound like a pompous fool just trying to say hello to someone new.” <br/></span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“I saw neither a fool, nor a pompadour, so no need to worry yourself on my account.”<br/></span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Harry flushed again and Severus was taking a fancy to that stain of red tinging that peaches and cream complexion, “I really do have to run, Ginny is not idle with her threats.”<br/></span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“I understand, but Harry I have a request of you.”<br/></span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Yes, Severus?” Harry’s eyes were bright and eager.<br/></span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Don’t let her go anywhere near your face with her rouge,” Severus dared a brief touch of his knuckles along the young man’s cheek, “I want to see your flush as my food passes your lips.”<br/></span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Harry’s cheeks instantly heated, “It is a blind judging, I won’t know which is yours.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Severus smirked, “Yes you will. Mine will be the best, and from here on out everything I make will be solely for you.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“That is ridiculous,” Harry said with a pleased sounding huff, “I don’t know anything about food. I don’t even know why I let Molly talk me into this.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Severus smiled, a genuine smile, “Off with you now, your little Miss Weasley is glaring daggers.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Right, yes, really must go. Good luck today, Severus.”<br/></span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Thank you, Harry. Though I am confident that luck will have nothing to do with my success today.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Harry chuckled and gave one last wave before he ran off.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Severus stared after the retreating back of the young man. He took a deep breath, this was going to be an unexpected distraction. He couldn’t bring himself to be displeased about the distraction, however. It was rare for him to feel a legitimate connection with another person and, prince or not, he would see it through.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Mr. Snape time to film some more opening shots!” One of the assistants called from a staging area. Severus nodded and headed off, he could put up with all this tedium until it was time to cook. The results would be worth it...possibly doubly so now.</span>
