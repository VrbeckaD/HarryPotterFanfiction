          <div class="userstuff"><p>The Entrance Hall was filled with eager students, who were chattering among themselves. Barty and Pandora, meanwhile, stood off to the side.</p>
<p>"I don't want to get sorted." Barty confessed to her silently "What if my father doesn't approve of my house?"</p>
<p>"I don't wanna get sorted either." Pandora smiled at him "I don't wanna accept the possibility that I'll be separated from you."</p>
<p>"So, do we ditch?" Barty couldn't help but smile back at her in spite of his anxiety</p>
<p>"We do."</p>
<p>Then, taking advantage of the fact that none of the chattering first-years were paying attention to them, Barty and Pandora opened the random door and snuck into the room which was on the other side.</p>
<p>It turned out to be a classroom. A rather large classroom. Pandora wasted no time in lying down on one of the desks. She pulled out a book and began reading. </p>
<p>Barty sat down in the chair by the window and started daydreaming about his father spending more time with him.</p>
<p></p><center>

</center>Professor McGonagall was pacing around the hall, obviously frustrated.<p>Two of the students who were supposed to be sorted were missing.</p>
<p>"What shall we do?" she shrieked</p>
<p>"Calm down." the school's headmaster, Professor Dumbledore, assured her</p>
<p>"Two of the students are missing, and you expect me to calm down?" she shrieked even louder</p>
<p>"We'll find them." Dumbledore said "The staff will search the castle. In the meantime, let the feast begin!"</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>-x-</p>
</center>Pandora and Barty skipped merrily down the secret passage Pandora had discovered by chance.<p>They heard the sounds of the teachers checking out the immediate vicinity, searching for them.</p>
<p>"So, what do you think we should do, Barty?" Pandora asked </p>
<p>"I think we should see where this leads." her friend replied with a huge grin</p>
<p>"You're speaking my language." Pandora nodded "Why won't they understand that we don't want to be sorted, anyway?"</p>
<p>"Beats me." Barty replied with a shrug</p>
<p>And with that, they embarked on their new adventure.</p></div>
