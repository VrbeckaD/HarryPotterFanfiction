    <p>“Good morning, Ms. Lewis,” Percy greeted absently as the door opened, not bothering to look up from the document he was checking for accuracy, quill pinched between his thumb and forefinger. He very nearly made a comment about her tardiness, but as it was only a minute past, and a Friday, he felt in a giving mood. He paused, then; he was used to her chirping a, “Good morning, Mr. Weasley!” back at him, far too cheerful for eight A.M., but there was silence. He stabbed a finger at the paragraph he’d reached to mark his place and glanced up.</p>
<p>Ms. Lewis was hanging her coat on the coat tree in the corner, and when she turned to her desk he noticed her face was quite pallid – not much darker than the bright white legal parchment he’d been looking over. He reached up to adjust his horn-rimmed glasses. She was frowning; he wasn’t entirely sure he’d ever seen his secretary frown, not in the three years she’d worked in the Minister for Magic’s office.</p>
<p>“Ms. Lewis?” Percy tried again, slowly, and she blinked, looking up to him as though startled. From across the room he could see her pupils were blown, and she had a look of panic about her. “Whatever is the matter?”</p>
<p>She promptly burst into tears.</p>
<p><em>Merlin</em>.</p>
<p>Percy had to bite his tongue against his kneejerk reaction, which was to remind the young woman that this was a governing institution, and not a forum for her emotional outbursts. Ms. Lewis was, generally, upbeat to the point of annoyance, but was quite charming and diplomatic when appropriate, and on the whole was a professional and respectable Ministry employee. To see her in such a state of distress was disarming, to say the least. Percy sighed, carefully setting down his quill and rising from his high back desk chair. He approached her desk slowly; he stopped a foot away, dithering on the spot.</p>
<p>“What happened?” he finally asked, voice soft. Ms. Lewis’s watery blue gaze peeked up at him from behind her fingers; she’d been sobbing into her hands, and there were kohl-stained tear tracks running down her fingers.</p>
<p>“D-dementors,” she croaked, sniffling. “They were – horrible!”</p>
<p>“Dementors?” Percy repeated in disbelief. “Where?”</p>
<p>“In th-the alley,” she said, sniffling again. She took a deep breath, daintily wiped away the tears and makeup smudges below her eyes, and said, jaw trembling, “There were two of them waiting b-by the Apparition point.”</p>
<p>“Are –? Ms. Lewis,” he said, shutting his eyes momentarily, trying to be both gentle and diplomatic all at once. “Dementors are guards and justice keepers, and are under Ministry control,” he rattled off. “It seems as though you’re insinuating –”</p>
<p>Just then, the door to the department opened, and a tall, dark-haired man wandered in, looking lost and extremely put out. His gaze slowly travelled up to meet Percy’s; he, too, looked pale and rather frightened. “I need to see the Minister,” he said, voice hollow.</p>
<p>“Mr. Barker,” Percy greeted cordially, straightening his spine as he regarded the dishevelled looking man from the Portkey Office. “Have you an appointment?” He glanced to Ms. Lewis, raising his eyebrow at the schedule book before her, yet unopened; she looked back at him with furrowed brows, regarding him as if he’d sprouted a second head.</p>
<p>“<em>Dementors</em>!” Barker hissed in response, suddenly coming to life despite his general look of nausea. He glared at Percy, indignant, swaying slightly. “There’re Dementors on the streets! This is ‘n urgent matter, an’ I must speak with the Minister at once –”</p>
<p>“The Minister is a busy man, as you no doubt know,” Percy replied, his voice strong and full of authority. “As an esteemed member of the Ministry, it should go without saying your logical next step is a visit to the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, where Mr. Pius Thicknesse himself can tell you there are no Dementors assigned to patrol the route which our own employees take to work every single day. Perhaps he would be willing to look into your frivolous claims.”</p>
<p>“Look at ‘er!” Barker said, taking a staggering step forward and pointing a long, thin finger at Ms. Lewis’s trembling form. “I can tell she’s seen ‘em too! Shaking like a leaf, she is, and you’re just going to stand there and pretend –”</p>
<p>“As Junior Assistant to the Minister for Magic, I am responsible for the care of my <em>own</em> secretary,” Percy responded lazily, “as well as, apparently, rationalizing your unfounded theories. As such –”</p>
<p>There was a creak as the door to Rufus Scrimgeour’s office opened, and the grim-faced Minister for Magic stood in the doorway, regarding the triangle of employees in the chamber with confusion. “What seems to be going on?” he asked, looking to Percy.</p>
<p>Percy felt a smile twitching at his lips; pride, that the Minister trusted him for an answer before the others. “These two are under the impression a Dementor chased them down in the alleyway upon Apparating. I have informed them of the correct pathway to report their complaints –”</p>
<p>“Is this a sodding joke?” Barker roared, advancing on Percy, who reached into his suit jacket, hand closing around his wand.</p>
<p>“Now, now,” Scrimgeour said haltingly. “Please, everyone be calm. Eddard, it is clear you’re upset, but before you force my hand in filing a report of workplace violence, let’s discuss this rationally.” He approached Barker slowly. “Are you quite certain of your claims? Need I remind you the repercussions of such an accusation, should it prove false?”</p>
<p>“Aye,” Barker replied as Scrimgeour came to a stop before him, yellow eyes searching behind his wire-rimmed spectacles. “Two of ‘em; nearly had me, too. I’m not good at Patronuses, see,” he added, looking as if he was ready to keel over at the memory.</p>
<p>“And you, my dear?” Scrimgeour asked, turning toward Ms. Lewis, who was hunched in her seat, looking almost exhausted. “Can you corroborate his story?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Minister,” she replied after a moment, nodding. Her eyes shone with unshed tears. “Advanced on me as I Apparated. I just… ran for it. I…” She trailed off, looking almost puzzled.</p>
<p>“Weasley,” Scrimgeour said, turning toward his Junior Assistant. “Compose an interdepartmental message to Pius Thicknesse at once. I want this dealt with swiftly.” Percy did his best to hide his surprise and immediately crossed the room to his desk, producing a clean sheet of parchment. He dipped his quill into his inkwell and began a brief message, paying half attention as the Minister continued. “Not a word of this,” Scrimgeour said warningly, turning toward Baker and Ms. Lewis with a grave expression, “until your unofficial report to Mr. Thicknesse. We mustn’t bicker amongst ourselves. This situation shall be dealt with internally, and you needn’t worry yourselves over it anymore. Understood?”</p>
<p>Baker regarded the Minister for a moment, some pink rising into his white cheeks. After a beat, he gave a curt nod and strode from the room without another word. The door slammed behind him. Scrimgeour cast a glance at Ms. Lewis next. “Audrey,” Percy heard him say, barely above a whisper. “Do I have your word?”</p>
<p>At her silence, Percy looked up, curious about their exchange. Ms. Lewis had straightened in her seat, and was regarding the Minister with what looked to Percy as contempt. “I know what I saw,” she told him in a clipped tone. </p>
<p>“Yes,” he conceded with a jerk of his head. “But it is imperative that none other than Mr. Thicknesse hear another word of it.” </p>
<p>Several emotions flitted across Ms. Lewis’s face in the next moment, Percy observed – astonishment, disgust, and finally a cool acceptance. “Yes, sir,” she finally said, voice glacial, as she looked down at her desk and reached for her planner. Scrimgeour dithered for a moment, finally giving a curt nod, striding back into his office and shutting the door tightly.</p>
<p>Percy was frozen, the tip of his quill resting in the inkwell, running over the past several minutes in his head. He knew – and admired – the Minister’s plans for a united Ministry, aligned in their views and in support of the people. But this… well, this was a direct disregard for protocol. </p>
<p>Percy was a fan of protocol. His attention to detail and penchant for following the rules is what had allowed him to rise through the ranks. His superiors knew he would do anything for them, and for the good of the Ministry. But never – never – before, had one of these actions left him feeling such unease. Not even, he mused with a wry twist of his lips, the way Cornelius Fudge had spoken about his “traitorous” family. Aligning with the Ministry over Dumbledore’s ideals had seemed like such a good move at the time. But now…</p>
<p>Percy removed his quill from the inkwell, finishing the last sentence of his communication, and signed <em>Percival Weasley, Junior Assistant Minister for Magic</em> with a loopy flourish. With a lazy flick of his wand, he charmed the letter flying through the air and fluttering through the crack under the door, sending it in the direction of all other interdepartmental mail. He looked up to Ms. Lewis, then, folding his hands atop his desk and regarding her with, potentially, more consideration than he’d offered in the three years they’d worked together.</p>
<p>She’d resumed a normal upright seated position in her office chair; her eyes looked red, even from across the room, and dark smudges of her makeup were still visible beneath them, but she seemed to have pulled herself together and had begun sorting through the documents in her inbox. She was also, he noted, steadfastly ignoring him; at various points in a normal day, she engaged in rather one-sided chatter. Though usually pertaining to work, it ground on his nerves. How long he’d wished for her to shut up, and now… well, now he’d gotten his wish, and he couldn’t understand why he so desired her to speak.</p>
<p>With a sigh, Percy reached for his briefcase. He placed it carefully atop his desk, flipping the clasps and opening it. He’d packed himself a sandwich and crisps, as he did nearly every day, but today was different; he’d been given a homemade jam roly-poly by Auror Robards, made by his wife; the Robards’ had hosted the Minister and a selection of his staff for dinner the previous month, and Percy had, as always, taken the opportunity to network with other high ranking Ministry employees. The dessert was a reward for making a good impression; Percy eyed Ms. Lewis speculatively, watching from across the room as she stuffed an envelope, hands shaking, and made a swift decision.</p>
<p>He rose from his desk, clutching the wrapped roly-poly in his hand, and approached her, if possible, more cautiously than he had when she’d been crying earlier. She steadfastly ignored him, eyes focussed on a flyer from the Department of Magical Transportation regarding travel protocol changes for the upcoming term at Hogwarts. He let out a breath through his nose. “Ms. Lewis?” he said.</p>
<p>“Yes, <em>Mr. Weasley</em>?” she replied. Oh, she was in quite a strop. Percy had never seen his secretary with such an attitude toward him – and, he wagered, he’d been plenty unpleasant to her during their time working together.</p>
<p>“Audrey,” Percy breathed, testing out the odd way her name rolled off his tongue. She looked up in surprise; Percy did not break professionalism. Ever. Their eyes met, and Percy’s hand flexed, nearly squishing the jam roly-poly; he reached forward and dropped it onto her desk, lest he do any more damage to it. “Eat it,” he said softly. “You could do with a spike in your blood sugar.” The unspoken acknowledgement of what she’d been through that morning hung heavy between them. Percy Weasley did not break protocol. Percy Weasley did not go against orders. And Percy Weasley most definitely not share dessert, especially one with a caveat. Scrimgeour had, in so few words, proved his ignorance wrong, and, with it, created a tiny fracture in the faith he held in the institution.</p>
<p>“You… you finally believe me,” she said, and he couldn’t tell whether it was a question or not. His skin felt hot and too tight, stretched over him in a way that almost itched. He fought of a wave of panic, and instead nodded. Ms. Lewis’s – <em>Audrey’s</em> – eyes darted between the roly-poly and him. “Thank you,” she said, softly. “Percy,” she added as an afterthought, and he saw some of the familiar life dancing in her eyes as she daringly spoke his first name; his responding look was withering.</p>
<p>The door of Scrimgeour’s office squeaked, signalling it being opened. Percy felt himself stiffen, and he stuttered out, “You’re quite welcome.” He felt the Minister’s eyes on his back and he swallowed. His gaze focused on Ms. Lewis’s left ear, and he tried to keep his speech as neutral as possible. “As you are not in any position to contradict the Minister for Magic, I suggest you keep this to yourself,” he said carefully, ignoring her scandalized look and the subsequent nagging sensation he felt in the pit of his stomach as he turned away and walked back to his desk. The air in the room was so thick it would have needed a slicing charm to cut through it, and the back of Percy’s neck burned with guilt. He kept his head down as he shut his briefcase and returned it to its spot, tucked under the edge of his desk.</p>
