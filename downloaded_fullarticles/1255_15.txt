    <p>An inconsequential looking vial was held between Headmaster Snape's pale fingers. The dark blue liquid swirled around inside as he pondered its usefulness that night. </p><p> </p><p>An entire greenhouse of Belladonna had been reduced for over half a week into this single spoonful of death. It coyly begged him to release it from its crystal prison, let a drop sink into his glass of Bordeaux. </p><p> </p><p>It would be so comforting to finally die, finally stop feeling. </p><p> </p><p>Occlumency could only help so much, he'd found. There were some feelings you couldn't just <em>stop</em> feeling. </p><p> </p><p>Grief was one. It was bone-deep and all-consuming. It came to bed with you at night and tucked you in tightly, then woke with you in the morning, waiting just a second after your awareness to recapture you. You'd think, oh good, it's finally gone, but it hadn't gone at all -</p><p> </p><p>It was implacable. </p><p> </p><p>The other was shame. It simmered under every act of anger and fear, begging you to unleash yourself with heartless abandon. The cruel mistress of one's rage and one's self-hatred. </p><p> </p><p>Severus had felt both just that morning, the task of leading the staff meeting had been an arduous one. </p><p> </p><p>Poppy hadn't looked at him once. She had once upon a time tended to his wounds, bathed him in the motherly love he so wished for his entire childhood. And now, all he felt was grief, that the kind and loving woman was so resigned against him.</p><p> </p><p>Minerva hadn't let his gaze go. She let her malice rise to the surface of every interaction they had, and every word that came from her thick Scottish brogue held a dual meaning. She might have been saying something regarding understaffing during holidays but what she really meant to impart was that he was a worthless traitor not even worth being cleaned off the sole of her boot. Severus felt ashamed, pinned by the woman's once-friendly eyes. They had shared a bottle of scotch on more than one occasion, throwing it back and mirthfully recounting Headmaster Dumbledore's oddities. Oh, how nightmarish that all seemed now that the man was cold and buried just outside the walls of the castle, six feet under the soil and withering to dust as the earth reclaimed him.</p><p> </p><p>Existence was horrifying. He'd promised to protect Lily's son, however, as it seemed he was doing a piss poor job of it. Word was, from Headmaster Black's portrait no less, that the children were malnourished and tearing themselves to tatters over the Horcruxes. Subsisting off foraged mushrooms and their last vestiges of hope. It was unpardonable that they should live like such, especially since Potter would die soon enough, never know a life any better. A lamb to slaughter and an orphan to boot, how horrid. </p><p> </p><p>Severus knew he had a job to do, but he often pondered the delicate proposition that seemed to appear from the darkened nowhere inside his mind. He would be standing by the window in his office, looking out over the grounds and think - I could open the window, just so, and propel myself out. I would leave my wand on the desk and let the height make the decision for me. The thought tempted him constantly, and now he'd taken to avoiding that particular window altogether. </p><p> </p><p>But here he sat, eying the poison he himself had made with a particularly manic interest that only came with years of slowly building insanity. Why had he made it? Simple - it was an exercise in loathing. You prepare your bed at night to lie in it and dig your grave to do the same.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Don't forget Lily's eyes, Severus. Her son has those eyes. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>"Yes, I bloody well know he does, Albus," Severus replied nervously. Glancing up at the portrait just settled the claim to madness deeper, for the Headmaster was fully asleep in frame. </p><p> </p><p>"How could I forget?" </p><p> </p><p>He uncorked the vial.</p><p> </p><p>If one was to be standing just outside the Headmaster's office they might hear a sputtering, then a crack of glass and a heavy thud. Inside, Severus lie on the floor, floral-scented foam bleeding from his lips as the life seeped from his body and into the old flagstones.</p><p> </p><p>It was time. He'd finally stopped being a coward and taken the cowards way out. His vision was blurring horribly, but with a minute amount of clarity, he could see a painful golden glint from under the old mahogany desk. It lay there, like he was, unmoving and useless. </p><p> </p><p>But it sparked a frisson of panic in him that had him desperately burbling. </p><p> </p><p>"A-Accio bezoar!"</p><p> </p><p>The stone flew into his hand and nearly never went into his mouth. It was a struggle, but he managed to shove the thing down into his throat.</p><p> </p><p>So, a coward after all, it seemed. Pity.</p><p> </p><p>His shaking fingers reached out for the precious item gleaming just out of view from anyone who wasn't writhing on the floor dying, and as it revealed itself, all golden and shimmery in the firelight to his watery gaze, he couldn't help the pained gasp that escaped him.</p><p> </p><p>It was a time turner, just pleading to be spun. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>He should have waited to use the thing, should have waited until the strange haze from his aborted poisoning had fizzled away, but he hadn't. It had been a panicked and dizzied flick that had the time turner spinning out of control, yanking his body in all kinds of directions until it felt like each layer of his skin was coming free from his bones and he would heave his soul out onto the floor in a puddle of still-tainted bile. </p><p> </p><p>Severus landed in a heap on the Headmaster's carpet once again, sputtering and wheezing in pain as he tried to collect himself. Each of his ribs felt bruised and broken, but none were, he was simply mentally damaged by the ordeal. </p><p> </p><p>Was he back in time or forward? How far? Who could tell, even! Severus had never really researched the devices all that much, just idle curiosity about them in his fourth year of schooling, so how far could they actually take someone? Someone who had idiotically spun it until it had shimmered and spat him out feeling half dead and half far, far too alive. </p><p> </p><p>"Severus, m'boy?" he heard from above him, the shadow of the currently still breathing Headmaster eclipsing his form. It made Severus laugh, the kind voice of his once mentor, laugh until he coughed up blood onto the rug and his eyes were too watery to see straight.</p><p> </p><p>Severus felt his body levitate, and he was placed into a chair by the fire. </p><p> </p><p>"Your master must have had you at the end of his wand, hmm?" Albus asked thoughtfully, pouring them both small glasses of brandy. Severus took the glass in his violently trembling hands and giggled down at it until he was simply gasping like a fool. The brandy would no doubt make him retch, his stomach lining must be shot to pieces from the poison he'd imbibed.</p><p> </p><p>Severus took a heartening sip. </p><p> </p><p>"So tell me, m'boy," Albus began softly, lowering himself into the chair beside Severus, looking every bit his old age. "What news do you have? It was a surprise to find you in my office, I hadn't thought you'd be summoned tonight. Was it a night of any significance?" </p><p> </p><p>"N-no significance," Severus wheezed, his wide and watery eyes dancing around the office until he felt his head was spinning. All the baubles and trinkets of the old man's collection were still there, which was startling to see considering Severus had just tossed them all out into the rubbish recently. It was night, but what year was it? Obviously he'd gone back, but how bloody far? </p><p> </p><p>On the desk sat the Gaunt ring, the one that had begun his descent, looking intact and very damning. Severus could almost feel tendrils of dark magic sweeping out and caressing his mind, pulling him out of his chair and dragging him across the floor for a sweet and blackened embrace. All he could see in his head was withering flesh and blinding green light. His soul seemed to twitch.</p><p> </p><p>"Horcrux..." Severus muttered, blinking his eyes rapidly to make the ring disappear from his vision. </p><p> </p><p>"Voldemort spoke of them?" Albus asked, sitting forward in his chair with an air of interest. "Tell me."</p><p> </p><p>"That ring- he mentioned that ring," Severus lied, feeling the deception building on his tongue and convalescing into a being of its own. "He was looking for it, said it was a part of him. You haven't..." Severus flicked his eyes to the Headmaster's hands, checking them for blackened skin and curse damage but finding only wrinkles. "Don't put it on, I believe it's ladened with a horridly powerful death curse." </p><p> </p><p>Albus' eyes widened at that pronouncement, the lines on his face giving his expression of disbelief a bit of drama. "Indeed? I am glad you warned me, then. It is..." Albus sighed and sat back in his seat, but his eyes were glued to the sight of that accursed ring. "It is an object of extreme power; it might have been too coaxing for even I to ignore the call." </p><p> </p><p>That made Severus drop his brandy, spilling it over the hearth as he gasped for breath and laughed. Gods, he was fully lost to himself! Completely mental! </p><p> </p><p>"Severus, you seem to have had a bit of spell damage, were you put under Cruciatus? Perhaps you should see Poppy." </p><p> </p><p>"No!" Severus replied with intense desperation, his maddened mirth evaporating. He could not, could not expose himself to more people. If he was in the time and place he believed, that would mean his other self was skulking around. What was he to do? </p><p> </p><p>"No, I shall just go to my quarters, I will be..." he trailed off, watching the flickering firelight cast shadows into the room and onto the portraits, portraits that had sneered at him and bid him end his life, end the life of the most hated Hogwarts headmaster in history. Or so he'd believed, it was perhaps just a figment of his delusions that they'd said anything about him at all.</p><p> </p><p>"I will be fine, Headmaster," Severus lied once more. </p>
