  <em> September 1st, 1993  </em>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p>     “Yoongi I think I lost my ro-“ </p><p>     “You literally haven’t, it’s in your bag.” Yoongi spat, pointing to my satchel next to me. Sure enough, my black robes poked out, the familiar red and gold colors contrasting against the bland khaki fabric of my bag.  I sat straight, my face emotionless, and my hand over my heart. </p><p>     “Always looking out for me, my dearest friend. How could I ever repay such ki-“ I began on a tangent, a tear making its way down my cheek. </p><p>     Yoongi smiled at me tightly, and slammed his book shut. I jumped, staring at him with a furrowed brow. </p><p>     “If all you’re going to do is be a complete twit while I’m reading, please make your way out of the fucking train car. Please, and thank you.” He stated sarcastically, and sunk back into the leather seat of the train car. I began to whine in my seat, hunching over myself. I cut myself short however, once Yoongi shot me a deathly stare. With my arms finding their way around myself, I stood up and inched towards the sliding door, pouting. </p><p>     “At least you’ve began to start saying please, manners have finally seemed to find you.” I grabbed my satchel, flinging it over my shoulder. “<em>Accio, luggage.” </em>I waved my wand, and my luggage lowered itself from the compartment above me, trailing after my feet. “Who the fuck even reads for fun anywa—“ </p><p>     “<em> Flipendo,”   </em></p><p>     I felt myself being knocked forward, my things flying out of my hands. I scowled and pushed myself up onto my knees shakily, whipping my head around. I glared at the ravenette behind me, waving at me gleefully. He flicked his wand, and the door slid shut with a soft thud. </p><p>     “What a whore,” I commented to myself, standing up and dusting my hands off on my pants. As I pulled myself together, I began my trek down the lengthy train, searching for anyone I     remotely knew. </p><p>     “Merlin’s <em> beard, </em>will you quit shoving me hyung? We’re going to find Suga somewhere.” I glanced back forward, my eyes initially scanning all the train cars beside me. Coming my way were a band of rowdy friends, all shoving each other and sticking their heads into compartments, seemingly searching for someone. I found myself making eye contact with one of them, a blond one with a bandana pushing his hair back. </p><p>     We both blinked, and then smirked at each other simultaneously. I immediately cocked a hip out, a singular arm hugging myself as I bit my lip. </p><p>     “Sorry to bother you love, we’re just searching for a friend of ours. But that’s not whats important here. Who do you happen to be? There’s no way I’d forget a pretty face like yours, love....” He trailed off, arching an eyebrow at me. I laughed softly, leaning against one of the train carts next to me. </p><p>     “Mcgraw, (y/n) Mcgraw. Fancy meeting you here.” I tugged my lip between my teeth, holding in a laugh as he followed the movements intently. </p><p>     “Well, my name’s Taehyung, love, and I-“ He began, shuffling forward slightly and hunching forward as he neared me. </p><p>     “Seriously, you git, can you keep it in your pants? The train’s going to arrive at Hogwarts soon, and I want to meet him before all the crowd when we get off.” A ravenette complained, his eyes round and his hands moving animatedly. He then turned to me, wringing his hands. </p><p>     “I’m really sorry for my <em> friends-“ </em>He glared pointedly at Taehyung, “-and I to be bothering you, but do you happen to know where a guy named Yoongi is? He’s a bit short, near your height actually, and—“ He started to describe him, his hands flying everywhere. I snorted, lifting up my arm and jerking my thumb behind me. </p><p>     “I just left from his compartment, actually. He kicked me out. He’s on the right somewhere back there.” I shrugged dismissively, looking and checking my nails. The boy in front of perked up, grabbing my hand and shaking it swiftly. </p><p>     “Thank you, (y/n), i appreciate it lots, love. Name’s Seokjin, but you can call me Worl-“ He babbled, but his friends from behind pushed him forward, nodding apologetically at me. They scurried forward and stepped over my luggage, complaining to Seokjin. Taehyung was the last to leave, pushing past me so closely our chests brushed each others. My breath hitched as he leaned forward, and I was sure he heard it as he began to grin. </p><p>     “I’ll see you around, Mcgraw, yeah?” He winked, and left before I could reply. I stood there watching him leave, blinking as he jumped onto one of his friend’s back. </p><p>     “He’s hot, that one.” I commented to myself, adjusting my bag back over my shoulder. </p><p>     “Who’s hot?” Two voices asked from behind, causing me to jump, my bag dropping to the floor. </p><p>     “Holy <em> shi-“ </em>I began to gasp out, clutching at my chest, feeling my heartbeat thud twice as fast. </p><p>     “Watch the profanity, Mcgraw, it’s not nice to swear.” Two ginger twins wagged their fingers in front of my face, clicking their tongues. I immediately straightened up as I saw their faces, a smile stretching over my face. </p><p>     “My <em> boys, </em>ugh, I haven’t seen you two in so long,” I launched myself at them, leaning up and landed two kisses on both of their cheeks. They grinned, their arms making their way around my back, and leading me in the direction they came from. Fred made sure to grab my luggage as we turned, and George began to update me on their summer rendezvous concerning their new pranks for the year.</p><p>     We chatted as we made our way down the long, never ending walkway down the train, talking about our summers and dreading the classes we had to take as 5th years. We finally seemed to reach their train car, as they both stopped me from walking forward. </p><p>     “Lemme get that for you,” Fred slid the bag down my shoulder and put on his own, sliding the door open and leaning in. I turned to my right to check out the train car next to me as Fred yanked my luggage inside. Low and behold, I made eye contact with yet another person. This time, I was fairly taken back by the handsome face that was staring back at me. Thick eyebrows, high cheekbones, fair skin, slightly arched lips, and a strong jaw only began to describe the beauty of this boy- no, <em> man, </em>that I was looking at through this glass. </p><p>     ‘<em> Cedric Diggory, you are one </em> <em> fine </em> <em> ass man,' </em>I thought to myself, and decided to go for it. I bit my lip and winked at him, biting back a smile as I began to turn around. He blushed brightly, smiling embarrassedly as his friends began to whoop, shoving him on the shoulders. </p><p>     “For once in your life woman, stop flirting and <em> get in, </em>would you?” Fred complained, and yanked me in, leading to my flying forward and landing up someone’s lap. I groaned, and turned onto my back, rubbing my stomach. I rubbed my eyes and opened them blearily, blinking. </p><p>     “Well, nice to see you too, (y/n),” Angelina Johnson jeered, rolling her eyes at me. I smacked her on the shoulder, mocking her as she complained, and curled up in her lap further. I shivered as I sat in her lap, making grabby hands at Fred’s coat. He rolled his eyes, and tossed it toward me, letting it land on my head. I let out a muffled “<em> I love you” </em>as I pulled it around myself, teeth chattering. </p><p>     “Okay, I get that fall is right around the corner, but should it really be this cold?” I complained, making a face at the dreary weather that the train was currently passing through. I can’t stand rain, or especially the fog. It reminds me of distant, unclear memories and just had such a melancholic feeling to it. Definitely <em> not </em>my cup of tea. </p><p>     “Oh, don’t be such a party pooper, Mcgraw.” George replied, shaking his head disapprovingly. Katie Bell, a 4th year sitting across from me, shook her head with him. She leaned her head against the window, her eyes shining. </p><p>     “I love weather like this. It’s so cool and refreshing, it makes me want to be outside.” She sighed, her breath fogging up the window. I snorted, leaning on Angelina’s shoulder.</p><p>     “You’re so lucky you’re adorable, Bell-y baby, or else I-“ As I spoke, the lights above us flickered quickly, and the train rocked forebodingly. I sat up quickly, sliding off Angelina’s lap and standing up, staring at everyone in the car in alarm.</p><p>     “W-What the hell was that?” Alicia Spinnet, a fellow fifth year, asked, her eyes widening. The rest of us shrugged, and I leaned towards the window. Suddenly, the air had a chill to it. My breath came out in deep sighs, the fog disappearing into the air. I furrowed my brow, and grabbed my wand, opening my mouth to speak an incantation. Before I could however, I began to feel drained. It was like all the happiness I felt before began to dissolve, a feeling of dread overcoming me. </p><p>     I felt memories rushing through my head, images blurring my vision. My dog’s death popped into my head, my mother’s blank face and her cold, limp hands, my father strapped into a chair, my parents<em> , my parents, my parents, my paren-</em></p><p>     I stumbled backwards as two cloaked figures floated through the passageway of the train, frost creeping up the glass windows as they passed by ominously. I shivered as I instinctively looked down, knowing not to make eye contact. Deep down I knew, I knew that if I looked up, it would surely end not in my favor. </p><p>     “What were those....” George trailed off, fog puffing up from his lips.</p><p>     “Dementors. “I replied grimly, gripping my wand tightly. ‘<em> How the hell— no, WHY the hell are they here?’ </em>I thought to myself angrily, turning back towards the window. Katie shivered, and hugged herself tightly.</p><p>     “Whatever those were, I hope they’re gone now. When they passed by, I felt the life being sucked out of me.... Felt like I’d—“ </p><p>     “—never be happy again,” I finished for her, turning my head over my shoulder and peering at her. “It’s what dementors do best. They guard Azkaban, the wizard prison. You can only imagine the atmosphere in a dingy place like that, with those things lurking around.” I explained tightly, jerking my head towards the direction the dementors passed by in. </p><p>     “At least they’re gon—“ Alicia spoke hopefully, but then the train car shook aggressively. I grabbed the door to steady myself, and watched in awe as the dementors came rushing back in the direction they came from. They were chased by a bright, white light that seemed to drive them out of the train, and back out. </p><p>    “Wow...... that’s one powerful Patronus, alright,” I breathed out, leaned forward to watch it push forward, pulsing almost musically. </p><p>I reached and slid the door open, looking left and right. As if on cue, I looked forward to see Diggory also glancing down the pathway, wide-eyed and confused. He stared down at me, worry painted all over his face. </p><p>     “Are you alright? Whatever those things were— man, they had the lot of us shook up.” He laughed nervously, running a hand through his hair. I shugged, a lopsided smile making its way across my lips. </p><p>     “Yeah, dementors tend to do that. No idea why they’re here of all places....” I muttered to myself. I shook my head, and looked back up at him. </p><p>     “If you got any chocolate within your group, I advise to split it up between to guys. Its good for the soul, cheer you up right after those soul-sucking demons.” I told him, patting him on the shoulder, and slid back into my compartment. </p><p>     “Blimey, (y/n), I feel like my pet cat just died, and I don’t even have a cat.” Fred complained, stretching out in the empty seat I vacated before. I rolled my eyes and shoved his legs off the seat, ignoring his complaints.</p><p>     “We better get ready with all our luggage, though. By the looks of it, we’re nearing Hogwarts, fast.” I pointed outside the window, birds flapping their wings and soaring across the dreary skies and brushing through dewy trees. </p><p class="p1"> </p><p>✧·ﾟ: *✧·ﾟ:* ✧·ﾟ: *✧·ﾟ:* ✧·ﾟ: *✧·ﾟ:* ✧·ﾟ: *✧·ﾟ:* ✧·ﾟ: *✧·ﾟ:* </p><p class="p1"> </p><p>      I clapped as the Gryffindor table gained another first year, smiling as the excited and/or nervous 11 and 12 year olds quickly made their ways to their respective tables. </p><p>     “We sure gained a lot of kids this year, huh?” I said loudly to Fred next to me, who nodded enthusiastically. I suddenly smirked evilly, slowly turning my head to face them. </p><p>    “You know what that means, boys?” I crooned, flipping my hair off my shoulder. They nodded respectfully, their faces solemn. </p><p>     “New test subjects.” We all said in unison, then cracking up immediately, leaning against each other. </p><p>     “You guys are going to get caught one day, you know that?” Angelina remarked, stabbing her spongecake with her fork, and pointing at us with it. </p><p>      “You only get caught if you leave marks.” I reminded her, sipping from my pumpkin juice. The twins and the Chasers of the Quidditch team fell into conversation, and I tuned them out. My eyes grazed across the multiple tables in the Great Hall, searching for someone in particular. Sure enough, my eyes fell on just the person I was looking for at the Ravenclaw table. I grinned quickly, and waved at the person to gain their attention. </p><p>     “I love you, Maximus,” I mouthed at the Ravenclaw boy, quickly drawing a heart with my fingers in the air. He chuckled, and blew multiple kisses at me, with me actively catching them. </p><p>    “Library, later?” He mouthed back, raising an eyebrow. I nodded enthusiastically, smiling at him. </p><p>    “I will never understand your friendship with that twat,” Fred snorted, raising an eyebrow as he bit into his load of bread. I scoffed and smacked him on the arm, pouting at the insult. </p><p>     “Why question it? I think it’s pretty cute. He’s also not so bad looking himself, which is a bonus for little Mcgraw here,” Alicia smirked at me, waggling her eyebrows suggestively. I shrugged at her,</p><p>not bothering to prove her wrong.   </p><p>     It’s true, my friend Maximus was good looking. He was constantly described as “exotic” (which I sort of saw as derogatory, really) as his parents were from Trinidad &amp; Tobago. He had arched eyebrows with a strong nose, with brown skin as rich as chocolate. He had full lips to match, and they stretched over straight, brilliantly white teeth. His eyes contrasted to the rest of his sharp features, with soft, almond shaped eyes, and light hazel orbs. In conclusion, my dear Maximus was really, <em> really </em>good-looking, and was a complete heartthrob. However, as soft and sweet as he looked, that boy had a wicked personality. ‘And a wicked tongue, too,’ I mused. He sure knew how to use that tongue, seeing as he put it to good use over the summe— </p><p>     As if on cue, Dumbledore had raised his hand, silence quickly falling over the hall. I grumbled, annoyed that he interrupted my daydream just in the nick of time. As i pouted to myself, I let my eyes wander, letting them fall on someone <em> very familiar, </em> who was sitting down further at my table. Taehyung was staring straight at me, his gaze dark. I gulped silently, but I didn’t want to back down. ‘ <em> After all, mama ain’t raise no bitch, </em>’ I thought to myself, and raised my chin at him, quirking a brow questioningly. He chuckled, and shook his head, turning to face forward again. I frowned slightly, cocking my head. </p><p>     He was so weird. </p><p>     Quick enough, Dumbledore’s speech ended, and we were free to do what we liked before school started. I took that as my cue to leave, waving to my fellow classmates and hurried down the aisle between the tables towards the entrance. There he was, my sweet, handsome baby Maximus, waiting near the entrance of the Great Hall with a bored expression on his face. </p><p>     “Oh come off of it, Maxy baby, you can’t be looking bored when I’m around,” I teased him, arms encircling his waist from behind. I saw him smile, and he slowly turned around, arms coming around to hug me back. </p><p>     “I’m sorry, I promise it’s not you,”  He replied back, pulling away and ruffling my hair. I whined, pushing him off and fixing it. “What are the shenanigans for this year?” He asked, falling into step besides me as we made our way to the library. </p><p>     “Honestly? I have no idea. You know I never have shit planned out, whatever happens just happens, I play off the chaos that comes each year. Last year was the Chamber of Secrets, and the twins and I decided to sell “charms” that would protect themselves from being Petrified. Worked well enough on the years below us, but Percy Weasley found out, and told McGonnagall. ” I put quotes around the word charms, and Max shook his head, hitting my arm. </p><p>     “You profiting off a literal crisis is honestly not surprising to me. Kids left and right were being sent to the Hospital Wing, and yet you were still fucking around. It’s like you giv—“ </p><p>     “—absolutely no shits about my well-being and what’s going on around me? You’re right, I don’t.” I smiled at him, and then skipped forward, watching the portraits move. </p><p>     “Hello, Lady Boleyn, how are you doing?” I asked kindly to the portrait near the Grand Staircase. The flames from the large torches and candles flickered, casting looming shadows upon her wall. Mindless chatter echoed around the staircase tower, bouncing off the walls and rising upwards.  </p><p>     “I’ve had better days, love. Some 1st years screamed and scattered as I waved to them. Now, I know I’m not the best looking around, but am I that ugly?” She scoffed, dusting down her laced bodice. I laughed, and shook my head at her, flicking off dust on the edge of her portrait frame. </p><p>     “I doubt it’s because you’re ugly, Anne. You are remarkably gorgeous, but I’d assume those 1st years were a bunch of Muggles.” I replied, grinning up at her. She nodded slowly, accepting my answer. She then waved goodbye as she rose in the frame, walking to the side and disappearing out of sight. Max pushed me forward slightly, and we continued our trek to the library. </p><p>     “Did you hear about that criminal escaping Azkaban? Sirius Black? I didn’t even think that was remotely possible.” Max nodded to himself, seemingly in thought. “How did he even escape…. Tricking the dementors? Is that even possible?” He asked, glancing sideways at me. I shrugged, not having an answer. The name Max mentioned suddenly rang a bell in my head, causing me to stop in place. I remembered a conversation I had with my aunt a few days prior back at the estate, before I left for Diagon Alley. </p><p>
  <em>      "Sirius Black escapes from Azakaban, on the loose," I read aloud from the Daily Prophet, munching on some toast my aunt laid out for me. I let the newspaper fall to the table as I reached for my glass of orange juice, gulping it down. "Hey look, it says here he's like 33 years old. That's your age, Aunt Rhea. Do you remember going to school with him?" i hummed, watching my aunt as i blinked at her back. She froze, and sighed, her head dropping forward.  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>      "Yes, actually. We were in the same year, honey. I remember him and his group of friends vividly." She mused, her eyes fixed on her rings as she twisted them on her fingers.  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>      "Wow, that's kinda crazy. Was he any cu-" My aunt sighed loudly, smacking her hands down on the counter, all the utensils floating in the air crashing to the ground and clattering. I jumped, my eyes widening and dropping the toast in my hand.  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>      "How about we start packing your luggage, for Hogwarts, hm? i'll go find your letter for the supplies you need this year." Aunt Rhea rushed out, leaving me alone in the grand dining room.  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>      "Was it something I said?" I asked myself. I shrugged, and continued to sip my orange juice.  </em>
</p><p>     I turned back towards Max, a grin breaking out on my face as we waited on the staircase, letting it move and shift to the side. </p><p>     "And what would that be?" He asked warily, cautious of the look I currently had on my face. </p><p>     "We're gonna find out as much as we can about Sirius Black." I watched gleefully as Max's face dropped, groaning as he rubbed the bridge of his nose aggressively. </p>
