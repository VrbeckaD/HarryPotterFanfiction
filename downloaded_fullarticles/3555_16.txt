          <div class="userstuff"><p>"Tell me you understand." His gaze is deep, desperate. "Tell me you understand what I'm doing, that I <em>have</em> to do this, <em>please</em>."</p><p>Hermione is hunched in on herself slightly, her right hand curled into fist against her mouth. Everything Harry has been explaining, all of the events from the past month, of the Act, of everything she'd learned since joining the magical world... and what it all meant for the future, should he pursue this further. </p><p>Everything was on repeat, scenes and words playing over and over in her mind. She understands. She understands all too well.</p><p>Her eyes are shining with tears, her eyes focused on his across the room.</p><p>"Hermione, please..." There is a slight sheen to his own gaze. "I can't do this without you. Just... Say something, please."</p><p>Her hand finally leaves her mouth, but her focus doesn't waver. </p><p>"I understand," she breathes, her throat tight with emotion. "I understand perfectly, Harry, and I -" she cuts off abruptly, spinning around to face out of the window.</p><p>Harry swallows, straightening from his forward lean against the desk. He takes a step closer, around the desk.</p><p>"You... You what?"</p><p>She takes in a shuddering breath, watching the gentle rain past her haunted reflection in the glass. She spins back around to face him again.</p><p>"I see... I <em>see</em> what this means, don't you?!" And she does. Her mind can't help but follow the trail, follow the logical domino path of events should Harry continue this route. When his desperate and mildly confused expression doesn't change, she continues passionately, "Can't you see where this leads? Even if you succeed with this, not everyone will accept it! People like him, people who gather followers like he has - they're not just going to stop! His <em>followers</em> aren't going to stop, not even if -" her voice cuts short, unable to finish her sentence.</p><p>Understanding dawns over his face, closely followed by sadness and resignation. He shuts his eyes slowly and takes a deep breath. He carefully lets it out and opens them again, stating evenly, "...Not even if I were to end him."</p><p>She searches his face, and sees her friend. Her best friend. The same friend who had saved her from the troll when her fellow snakes had driven her tears, nearly killing himself in the process, the same friend who dove recklessly into every pursuit to keep her and all those who care for him safe, no matter the cost. And she understands. </p><p>"...You do see." It's clear that he does. Imaginings of revolt, of anarchy, of blood and warfare flash starkly though her mind.</p><p>"...Yes."</p><p>On the other hand, equal imaginings of pacifism and attempted peace-proclamations leading to total destruction of everything she holds dear flicker behind her eyes just as stark, just as horrific... And she understands.</p><p>She swallows thickly, thinking of her family, of the little first years she'd been asked to tutor this year. She thinks of the increased tensions between magicals and muggles. She thinks of young Sara asking if she was going to be able to come back to Hogwarts next year because of the Transparency and Separation Act.</p><p>She understands.</p><p>She takes a step forward. Then another. And another. She closes her arms around him, kissing the side of his head, into his hair. He clings to her, pressing his face down into her shoulder and burying one hand into her hair. </p><p>"I'm here," she whispers softly into his hair. "I'm here. I understand."</p><p>She feels the tension and anxiety bleed out of him and she pulls back to gently grab his face. </p><p>"I understand, Harry." She softly presses her closed lips to his. "We're in this together, okay?"</p><p>The sheen returns to his eyes as a small, broken smile flickers across his mouth.</p><p>"Together."</p></div>
