    <p>On the morning of September 1st, the year that he turned eleven years old, Remus Lupin packed a backpack, smashed his piggy bank and took an early morning bus to King’s Cross Station. He had spent an hour the night before writing and re-writing a letter to his parents in his messy handwriting, telling them not to worry, not to come looking for him. The final copy he sealed in an envelope, labelled <em> Mum &amp; Dad, </em>and propped up on his pillow so that it would be the first thing his parents saw when they entered the room. Then, he climbed out his bedroom window, shimmied down the drainpipe to the lawn, and took off at a fast walk to the bus stop around the corner.</p><p>The driver looked a little surprised to see the boy taking the bus alone so early in the morning, but Remus gave her his most confident smile, and handed her the correct change, so she let him take his seat, throwing glances back at him in the rear vision mirror every so often. He hopped off the bus at the station, thanking the driver, and went to find a clock he could check. It was 9.30am. He had been determined to arrive as early as possible, to make absolutely sure that no unexpected delays, missed buses or unfortunate accidents would prevent him from being on the most important train ride of his life. The Muggle part of the station was already bustling with morning commuters, and none had a second glance to spare for the scrawny child wending his way to Platform 9.</p><p>Remus paused before the barrier that led to Platform 9 and ¾. It must look odd to passerby, he knew, a small child standing a metre away from a brick wall and staring at it like it were the most riveting film, but he was too excited to simply stroll nonchalantly through the wall as he had planned.This was the moment he had been dreaming about for eleven years. In a matter of seconds, he would be standing in the middle of the real Wizarding world. He stretched out one hand, and felt his fingers slip through the brickwork, as if it wasn't even there. With a large grin on his face, Remus shouldered his backpack, and walked wide-eyed through the barrier between the two worlds.</p><p>Platform 9 and ¾ was almost completely deserted. The Hogwarts Express had not even pulled into the station. There was a man at the other end of the platform, but he was sleeping on a bench. Judging by the hat he had pulled over his face, Remus thought he might have been the conductor. It was more underwhelming than it would have been had he arrived later, Remus knew, when all the children were bursting through the barrier with their luggage and their owls. He wasn’t totally bored in the forty-five minutes he had alone, however. He smoothed out a copy of <em> The Daily Prophet </em>he found crumpled against a wall, and spent a while perusing its pages. He read about Minister for Magic Eugenia Jenkins meeting with the American Wizarding Ambassador, and about Quidditch disputes, and an advice column that discussed the best ways to get rid of doxy infestations. He watched the pictures of the Minister and the columnist and several Quidditch teams move around on the page.</p><p>He wondered if his parents had knocked on his door yet.They would knock intermittently and ask if he was awake until about 10.30, when they would start demanding that he get up. He didn’t think they would go so far as to actually barge in and shake him awake until at least 11.00, which was all he needed. Once the clock struck 11, he would be aboard the Hogwarts Express, and there was nothing his parents could do about it.</p><p>The first student came through the barrier at 10.24, with a trolley full of luggage and a fat black cat in a cage perched atop it all. Her mother came through beside her chatting at full speed. Neither of them noticed Remus, sitting quietly on a bench with his backpack. </p><p>The Hogwarts Express pulled up at 10.30 exactly. It’s whistle blew as it glided to a halt, and the conductor, having woken some time ago, walked the length of the train pulling open all the doors. By this time, there were dozens more students and their parents on the platform. There had been a steady stream of them, each with different animals in cages. Some older-looking students had their wands out and were performing all kinds of spells, and Remus didn’t know where to look as things levitated and changed colour and flew the length of the platform all around him.</p><p>Finally, he got the nerve to get on the train, and found a compartment all of his own. He trapped his backpack between his legs and the front of the seat and stared rapturously out at the chaos on the platform. He almost couldn’t believe where he was. It seemed like a dream. He had dreamed of this moment often enough. But he ran his hand along the fabric of the seats, and knew that it was most definitely real. Things didn’t have textures in dreams, not properly. It was real, and he was going to Hogwarts. It didn’t matter how long for. Even if he only managed to set a foot in Hogsmeade Station before they carted him away, he would have ridden the Hogwarts Express with hundreds of other Witches and Wizards, and bought Wizarding sweets and seen students doing magic in the aisles. His parents would be furious. They would be beyond furious. He would likely be grounded until he was eighty. But he had been planning this since he was eight, and he was confident that any punishment in the world was worth it.</p><p>He was joined in his compartment soon enough by a small group of seventh-year girls wearing stylish Muggle clothing.They were giggling amongst themselves, and all smiled at Remus as they entered.</p><p>“Are you waiting for friends?” one asked him, “Is it alright if we sit here?”</p><p>“Y-yeah,” Remus said nervously, “Sure.”</p><p>The girls all took seats. One girl pulled out a stack of Wizarding magazines, and began studying one very closely as she took out her wand and began to perform a series of charms on another girl’s hair. The hair began to levitate from the girl’s shoulders, and divide into small groups, which then began to weave intricately together. Remus gawped wide-eyed, but could not watch as closely as he would have liked, since the girl who had talked to him continued to chatter.</p><p>“The compartments fill up fast around here,” she told him, “You were smart to come early and be the first in. It’s so much more awkward to have to slot yourself into one that’s half full. Are you a first year?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Remus replied, still distracted by the hair styling going on just to the girl’s right.</p><p>“You must be nervous, not knowing anybody!” The girl had the air of a teacher: smiling and caring and official. “We’re all seventh years. If you need any help, or have questions, we’d be happy to answer them. Do you have any idea what house you’ll be in?” Remus shook his head.</p><p>“I’m a Hufflepuff,” the girl told him, “Alana and Cassie are Slytherin. Rosie’s a Ravenclaw and Hannah’s a Gryffindor. So whichever house you end up in, you’ve got your bases covered if you need anything. Any house you’ve got your heart set on?” Remus shrugged.</p><p>“Well I’ll put in a good word for Hufflepuff,” the girl smiled, “We’re the kind and hard-working house. And the house that’s five metres away from the kitchens. I’m Lyra, by the way. What’s your name?”</p><p>“Remus,” he said. She reached out and shook his hand.</p><p>There was a shriek from the girl getting her hair braided as the girl braiding lost focus for a moment and created a large tangle.</p><p>“Cassie!” the girl with the knot cried, “I thought you said you knew what you were doing!”</p><p>“Oh hold still, Hannah!” Cassie grumbled, sticking her wand between her teeth as she started trying to work the knot out with her hands. The compartment descended into chaos as all five girls began trying to remedy the situation, magically and manually. Remus curled up against the window and watched, taking a book from his bag and peeping over the top so it didn’t look like he was blatantly staring.</p><p>When the knot had been untangled, and Hannah’s hair had been styled to Cassie’s satisfaction, the Slytherin girl selected Rosie as her next victim and began the process again.</p><p>“Cassie’s the reason I cut my hair short,” Lyra said conspiratorially to Remus, as though the two of them were in on some big secret, “She does this every two weeks. You’ve got a bit of a mop going on. She could probably do yours.” Remus felt his face going red, but Cassie nearly dropped her wand as she excitedly turned to Remus.</p><p>“Can I?” she asked, “I could cut it a bit too! I never get to do boy’s hair! I could give you the latest fashion!”</p><p>“Y-yeah,” Remus said, with a nervous smile. He had never really minded his shaggy mane of hair, but he would do anything this girl suggested, so long as it involved magic. He swapped seats with Rosie, who looked thankful to be released from her torment, and nearly rolled his eyes back in his head to try and get a look at what the girl was doing. He could swear he felt magical energy tingling across his skull as little pieces of hair fell in his lap and onto his shirt. Alana and Hannah dealt themselves a hand of Exploding Snap cards and struck up a game, while Rosie pulled out a book. Lyra and Cassie simply chatted, making sure to include Remus in their talk. They didn’t ask him too many questions, thankfully, since Remus wasn’t sure he could come up with a convincing story that would hold up under scrutiny. They talked about N.E.W.Ts, who their Professors would be, life after Hogwarts. Cassie wanted to own a salon. Lyra wanted to design dress robes and other Wizarding clothing. Remus told them he would do anything in the world so long as it involved magic, which set the girls to giggling.</p><p>“We just got a new Headmaster last year,” Lyra informed Remus, “His name’s Professor Dumbledore. He was the Deputy Headmaster before. Everyone’s sad to see old Dippet go, of course, but Dumbledore's awesome!"</p><p>“Yeah, I know him!” Remus said enthusiastically, “He came to my house. He played Gobstones with me!” <em> And my parents fought with him and made him leave, </em>he left unsaid.</p><p>“Oh, are you a muggleborn then?” Cassie asked, “I felt sure you were from a Wizarding family. With the name and all. Only, teachers don’t go to kid’s houses unless it’s because they have to explain the Wizarding world to the parents.”</p><p>“Oh…” Remus murmured, biting his lip, “No… I’m… I’m a half-blood. Er… he was just at my house is all.” Whatever the reason, this lame excuse seemed to work, for the two girls quickly changed the topic.</p><p>The next few hours passed in much the same way. Remus emerged from under Cassie’s wand with shorter, more stylish hair, and a fringe that no longer fell in his eyes but swept artfully off to the side. He played a round of Exploding Snap and learned the basics of Wizard Chess and when the Trolley Witch trundled by with her mountain of sweets, Remus carefully counted the six sickles he had managed to collect over many, many years, and spent them all on a pumpkin pasty, a box of Bertie Botts Every Flavour Beans, a Chocolate Frog, and a packet of Droobles. He tore open the packaging of the Chocolate Frog to see the card, which was, rather unsettlingly, a snakelike Dark Wizard named Herpo the Foul, but he watched the man grimace and glare for a good long while nevertheless. He managed to eat about ten Every Flavour Beans before he had to stop. He found an almond, a toffee and a blueberry flavoured bean, but also liver, overcooked cabbage, soap, and, completely unfairly and rather ironically, four that tasted like dog food. Remus, not wanting to spit these beans out while he had an audience, forced himself to swallow them down, grimacing as he did so. The experience may have been a magical one, but did not think he’d soon get rid of the taste of old meat in his mouth. </p><p>He stuffed his remaining sweets into the bottom of his backpack. When he was inevitably caught and forced to return home, they would be his reminder of the best seven hours he had ever passed in his life. He had a sudden vision of himself, older and skinner, lying on his bed and mournfully putting the last piece of Droobles into his mouth, blowing sad, pink bubbles up to his bedroom ceiling. By that time, he thought, he would probably be grateful for every dog food-flavoured bean that passed his lips. How he wished he had managed to scavenge a few more sickles!</p>
