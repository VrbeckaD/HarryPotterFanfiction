    <p>
  <span>The first time Harry makes his way to the spot exactly three quarters of the way between platforms nine and ten, he realizes that he has absolutely no idea what he is supposed to do. He tries moving to the nearest wall and watching, tries to find another person like him with a trunk or an owl or strange robes like the ones he’d seen people wearing in the alley. He watches closely for any sign that he isn’t alone. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>But the minutes tick by and he doesn’t see any sign of magic. He tries to figure it out himself, instead. He tries everything he can think of: he taps his heels together and says, “Hogwarts Express,” like he’d seen on TV, he whispers, “please please please,” he tries jumping up and down and wishing harder than he ever has. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>This is a Harry Potter that was ignored, who watched through the slats in his door as Dudley was showered in praise and presents and food and love. This is a Harry Potter that went to school only to be beaten by bullies and blamed by teachers that thought he was a criminal.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>This is a Harry that </span>
  <em>
    <span>wants</span>
  </em>.
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He pulls out his wand and tries tapping the ground, he taps his ticket, he taps out the beat of a song on the metal edge of his cart. None of it works. So he lays down in the middle of the station and wonders if perhaps he’s gone crazy and everything has just been a dream. Figures, he thinks, the best thing to ever happen to him never really happened at all. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then a boy approaches him, a boy with white hair and nervous eyes and his chin held high even so. He says, “My father thinks Muggleborns shouldn’t bother getting on the train at all, but- but I think you’re funny, you know, I’ve been watching, and- and so. Would you like me to show you how to get on the platform?” And he holds out his hand.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry stares. And then he grabs the boy’s offered hand and lets him drag him to his feet, up and along, straight through a wall and into a magical world. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The boy talks the whole time, but Harry doesn’t hear a word of it because he’s busy being in awe of it all, of the fact that he isn’t crazy, of this boy who had walked up to a stranger and shown him hope, of the bustle around the train and all the people around him that are wizards, just like him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And Harry takes a trembling breath and looks over at the boy who is still holding his hand and he opens his mouth and-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And then the boy smiles and says, “Well, that’s that then. Good luck at Hogwarts!” And Harry nods, tries to change his wide-eyed expression and fails, tries to come up with something to say that will keep the boy there and fails. The boy shifts a little and drops his hand and kicks lightly at the ground before turning and boarding the train.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And then Harry is alone again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>---</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry comes to Hogwarts a survivor, not a savior. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry comes to Hogwarts cold. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>His green eyes that once so resembled his mother’s are harsh and calculating and unforgiving- now unrecognizable. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He comes to Hogwarts suspicious and hardened and not ready to trust- but he comes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He comes to Hogwarts like he’s Albus Dumbledore’s worst nightmare and he creeps his way in so silently that everyone is shocked when McGonagall calls out his name and he emerges. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They were waiting for a hero. Harry steps forward, instead. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And when the hat yells out “Slytherin!” the whole castle stares, waiting for the punchline. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>But Harry Potter is no joke; they’re discovering that</span>
  <span>. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>---</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>This is a Harry Potter that grew up being told he was worthless, a burden, unwanted and unloved.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>This is a Harry Potter that had no one, because everyone in his neighborhood knew that a boy like Harry Potter was trouble.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>This is a Harry Potter that fights his way through life instead of laughing it off. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>---</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>During his first potions class, Harry learns to be cautious around the man with the sharp eyes and cutting words and quick hands and the dangerous empty heart.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He’s Harry’s head of house. Figures.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>---</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nobody knows what to think of him, after the sorting. Harry Potter is a Slytherin and that’s not how it was supposed to be. Mostly they just try to ignore him, ignore the problem. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry’s used to pretending he doesn’t exist. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>This is a Harry Potter that learned to hide, that learned to do it well. So while most of Hogwarts pretends that they never needed a savior, that they never expected a hero, Harry indulges them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He’s just like any other first year Slytherin, except for the fact that he’s not. Harry Potter is confusing, he’s off-putting, nobody understands him. He’s like a robot, a computer, it’s like he’s not even human, they say. He hears them and pretends it doesn’t hurt. He hides his tears and he hides his face and he hides himself away. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Three weeks into the school year there is a rumor going around that nobody has ever seen him smile. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>When it gets back to the Slytherin dorm, Harry himself wonders if it isn’t true. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>---</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>When Draco comes to Hogwarts he intends to be best friends with the Boy Who Lived. But then he meets another boy- a Muggleborn, he must be- and the boy seems a little lost and he is all alone and Draco thinks he must be so brave. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And for a minute, he wants to be brave, too.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Draco finds out that the boy is Harry Potter later, but that is after he’s been sorted into Gryffindor.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry Potter is a Slytherin and Draco Malfoy is a Gryffindor and suddenly Draco is painfully, furiously, hopelessly jealous. So he forgets about the boy and the bravery and blames the ten seconds it had taken for him to lose his friends and his father and his confidence on Harry Potter, and he decides that he hates him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He pretends that he doesn’t notice Harry watching him with a blank stare and empty eyes and a green and silver tie around his neck. He pretends that he doesn’t care, that his chest doesn’t ache when he looks down to see his own colored red and gold. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry never yells at him like he expects. He expects a fight, an uproar, a spray of cutting words aimed at his heart, but Harry Potter never says a word. He just sits and he watches and he waits, and the cold look in his eyes reminds Draco of the boy on the platform and how he’d been so warm, for a minute, right after Draco had pulled him through the barrier and it hurts just as much as he expected the anger to but in all the wrong ways. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He isn’t sure how to fix it, when Harry never acts like he expects. He never thought his decision would be permanent, but Harry doesn’t call him out and so he has no reason to change his mind even though it </span>
  <em>
    <span>has</span>
  </em>
  <span> changed, and he can’t summon up his courage again to talk to him because Harry was supposed to be the brave one. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Harry was supposed to be the brave one. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry was supposed to be the Gryffindor and Draco was supposed to be the Slytherin but that isn’t how it goes. And there is no anger and no fighting and they aren’t friends but they aren’t enemies either. And the months go by and nothing ever changes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>But Draco notices the eyes on him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>---</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry watches Draco lift his cup at the Halloween feast and sip at his pumpkin juice and almost spit it out across the whole table because he’s laughing so hard at something Granger says and he feels something is his chest tug hard enough that he stills his hands where they are reaching for his own drink to wash down the bitter taste of loneliness on his tongue.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He watches, sure, he’s always watching. But he doesn’t think he can understand. He’s never been on the other side. He’s never had a friend. All he has is this pile of forgotten dreams that he stopped remembering years ago and a warmth in his chest when he remembers the first boy to hold his hand.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And every time he looks at him he remembers how nice he was and how he didn’t care that Harry was a little different. And every time he looks at him he remembers how his Aunt Petunia would hug his cousin, Dudley, and how he used to wrap his own arms around his stomach and imagine that someday he’d have the real thing and it would be even better.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>But he’s always scared and he’s always watching and he never says a word and nothing ever changes. He never changes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And no matter how much he begged the hat to be placed in Gryffindor he never belonged there.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry is a coward.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>---</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry dreams of creatures with open mouths and crooked teeth and twisted, sallow skin. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They stare back at him through every mirror and reflection in glass, in metal, in the surface of the Great Lake. He can’t escape them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They follow him and watch as hooded figures feed off of his hope. His stomach caves in and his cheeks hollow out and his eyelids become heavy and fall and fall and fall.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He is falling through some grey mist and he knows with absolute certainty that the second he hits the ground he is going to die.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They don’t know how to smile. He thinks the creatures are trying to smile but they don’t know how to do it right; they don’t know how to mean it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And they open their great, gaping mouths even wider, with their crooked teeth shifting and rippling and sharp and sharp and sharp, and they get closer, closer still, and he thinks they are going to swallow him whole.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry dreams about death and monsters and dying and then he wakes and nothing changes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>---</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry watches; he’s always watching. So he notices. When his defense professor starts watching him back, he notices. And he notices the way that his scar hurts every time he enters that one specific classroom. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He notices just like he notices that Professor Snape hates him and Professor McGonagall wants to talk to him but keeps talking herself out of it instead, like he notices the way that the Headmaster’s eyes linger just a little too long some days, like he notices the extra attention he starts getting as the shock wears off and people begin waiting with bated breath for him to do </span>
  <em>
    <span>something</span>
  </em>
  <span>. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He keeps hiding instead. He goes to his classes and studies and practices in the library behind the rows of bookshelves. He sneaks to his common room right before curfew, avoids contact as much as possible. He’s here for a reason, and he’ll do everything that he can to stay here just so he doesn’t have to go back to where he came from. He never wants to go back.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He watches but he doesn’t act. Not yet. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>---</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span> A few days into the holiday break Professor McGonagall asks to see him, so he enters her office with sharp eyes and open ears and small, hesitant steps. She looks at him oddly and he looks back, trying to figure out what she’s been waiting to say to him, what she wants. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>When she finally speaks, Harry darts his eyes around the room, searching. She asks him what he knows about his parents, asks if he’d like to hear the stories she has to tell. He can’t figure out why, doesn’t see anything that he has to offer; the bare walls give him no answers. “What do you want from me for them?” he asks her, voice rough from misuse. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The professor frowns at him and just stares for a while, stares at his guarded eyes and empty face and his feet where he’s set on his toes ready to run. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She sighs, finally, thinking maybe she’ll never understand the boy in front of her and asks the question that has been on her mind. “You weren’t surprised, Mr. Potter. That first day when I transfigured in front of the class, you were the only one that wasn’t surprised.” She is looking for something. She’s looking for something more, for some confirmation that he’s special, that he’s smarter than he looks, that he’d figured it out and was hiding a true talent behind all the curtains, for something she can understand.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>But Harry just looks back and whispers, “I was very surprised, Professor.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She is looking for all of the wrong secrets.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>---</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry skips the Christmas feast and sits in a window instead, a big open window, one that looks out over the grounds. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Outside the window Harry sees two boys playing. Their cheeks and noses are red like their flaming hair and their bodies are shaking with laughter. They run in circles, bundled up in sweaters and robes and scarves and hats and mittens, and they never go anywhere. They pick snow up off of the ground only to throw it and let it fall back down. It doesn’t make any sense.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The sun is setting over the school grounds and snow is falling against the glowing orange backdrop. There are trees standing tall with icicles hanging from their branches, bushes that sag under the weight of the gathered snow, large dunes of pure white sprawled across the rolling hills. Harry imagines the way it would sound creaking under his feet. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He imagines the way the chill would feel over the tips of his ears, how it would burn as he pulled the air into his lungs. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He imagines the layers of cloth folding around his body and tucked close, imagines how warm and safe and heavy he would feel. He imagines that he could lay down in the creaking snow and stare at the clouds as they turned from orange to pink to purple and black, imagines that when he finally made his way inside his whole body would be pins and needles. He imagines a cup of hot chocolate in his hands at the kitchen table, and somebody sitting across from him that cares. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Inside, he hears only the hollow beat of his own heart bouncing off of the cold stone walls and echoing through the empty corridor.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He imagines holding his breath until there is only silence, like the world outside, sound damped by the soft covering of snow.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>---</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Draco returns and with him come classes. Harry goes back to sneaking, lurking, ducking around the eyes that still follow him. And watching- Harry goes back to watching.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Professor Quirrell is hiding something, of this Harry is absolutely sure. He can tell that they are one and the same, just made-up patchwork people, never showing how they feel. Professor Quirrell is not Professor Quirrell at all; he’s a character. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry decides that they need to band together, then, and stays behind after class to talk.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The professor rests his hand on Harry’s shoulder and asks what he needs, accidentally brushing his thumb over Harry’s neck with his movement. He jerks his hand back like it just touched a hot stove and Harry’s skin burns in turn and his scar is screaming at him and suddenly he realizes. He realizes what it meant when his scar hurt every time he saw the man in front of him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They are not the same.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Professor Quirrell isn’t hiding anything; he’s hiding a </span>
  <em>
    <span>lack</span>
  </em>
  <span> of something, something important. He is hiding the great, gaping black hole inside of his chest where souls are torn apart and buried. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Professor Quirrell is not Professor Quirrell at all; he’s the enemy.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>---</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Draco sees the way that Harry Potter hides himself away and he’s jealous because not only is Harry a Slytherin, he’s also exactly the kind of son his father had always wanted him to be. Harry can keep up the mask that Draco had always tried so hard and failed at. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He doesn’t understand why it has to hurt so much. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>One day, toward the end of the year, Professor Quirrell leaves and Harry Potter isn’t in class for a week. He never finds out what happened but it feels important somehow. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Exams come and go and Draco gets distracted, and over the summer he forgets.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>---</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>When August finally comes Harry goes to Diagon Alley for his things and he runs into Draco Malfoy and his father- he runs straight into them and they stumble back while Harry falls to the ground. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>When he looks up Harry sees a hand over him, just like last year. Draco reaches out a hand and Harry takes it. Draco’s father looks so much like him except for the look of disdain and disgust on his face when his eyes point in Harry’s general direction. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He picks up Harry’s books from where they scattered across the ground anyway, and when he holds them out to Harry, Draco takes them instead. When Draco’s father’s eyes look at him his face doesn’t look any less disgusted.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Draco has heard his father talking all summer, talking about plans and danger and secrets. When he sees a book that doesn’t belong in the stack that his father is handing to Harry, he knows that something more is happening. So he takes them and tells his father that he’s going to help his friend with his shopping and that he’ll meet up with him later. And even though the boys are only twelve, his father doesn’t argue before walking away. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Draco hands Harry the books back, keeping the one his father slipped in. “So where are you headed next?” Draco asks, but Harry is already slinking away. Draco stops him, his hand on his shoulder. Harry freezes. His whole head turns as he looks at the point of contact. Then his eyes flick up to meet Draco’s. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He doesn’t speak. Draco Malfoy has never seen Harry Potter speak. Instead he stares, hard and sharp and cutting, and Draco almost flinches back except then he sees something else in Harry’s face, something soft and hidden. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Look, I know we got off to a bad start, but I really do want to get to know you. We can finish getting your school supplies and everything. I mean- did you come with anyone?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry shakes his head, no. He’s alone. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Draco smiles, “Where to?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>---</span>
