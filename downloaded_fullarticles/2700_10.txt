    <p>"So you're saying you have no choice but to compete in this competition?" Hermione exclaimed. Unlike Ron, and most of the rest of the students at Hogwarts, she believed Harry when he said he didn't enter his name in the Goblet of Fire. Why would he? He doesn't need fame. Danger finds him without help. And though she didn't know exactly how rich he was, she was pretty sure that the Potter vaults held far more than 1000 galleons.</p>
<p>"Yeah. I have to compete, or I lose my magic. The goblet makes a magically binding contract," Harry said glumly.</p>
<p>"That is so not right. Contracts aren't supposed to work unless they are freely entered into! You didn't enter!" Hermione said.</p>
<p>"Take it up with the Goblet!" Harry said. "Dumbledore said it has the power to do that."</p>
<p>"Wait... really?" Hermione said. "I wonder..."</p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>One week later, in the Headmaster's office...</em>
</p>
<p>Hermione, Harry, Filch, and Dumbledore sat in his office, with the Goblet of Fire in front of them.</p>
<p>"Let the BiWizard Tournament Begin!" Hermione said. "Entrants, please enter your names."</p>
<p>Dumbledore dropped in a piece of paper, and Filch dropped in another. </p>
<p>"Now, let the entrants be chosen." The Goblet of Fire spit out one piece of paper. "The entrant for Hogwarts Staff is Albus Dumbledore." The next piece of paper was spit out. "And the entrant for Hogwarts Alumni is Tom Riddle."</p>
<p>Harry applauded. Hermione gave him a stern look.</p>
<p>"The first and only task will be a candy eating competition, and will begin in 2 minutes. The competition is to eat the most candy in 30 seconds. I remind all competitors that failure to compete means the loss of all magic." Harry placed the two dishes of candy at the table. She set a tempus charm to count down the time, then, "Go!"</p>
<p>Dumbledore tucked into his beloved lemon sherbets.</p>
<p>"And... time. Our score shows that Albus Dumbledore-"</p>
<p>Hermione was interrupted in announcing the score (Dumbledore 48, Riddle N/A) when Harry began to scream and writhe. His scar burst open and black tar began hissing out of it. </p>
<p><em>Pain pain unbearable indescribable no it was leaving him all leaving him </em> <em>I can't die I can't I've taken too many steps too many horcruxes impossible how can it...</em></p>
<hr/>
<p>
  <em>Four hours later, in the Hospital Wing</em>
</p>
<p>Harry blinked his eyes open blearily. Ah. Yes. He knew where he was - he'd been here often enough. He also knew if he waited for Madame Pomphrey, he'd be here for another week, so he tried to sit up, only to be gently pressed back down.</p>
<p>"Now now, my boy. It's a little too soon for that." Dumbledore handed him his glasses, so he at least could focus.</p>
<p>"Ugh. What happened?" Harry said.</p>
<p>Dumbledore's eyes twinkled. "It's possible that Voldemort was ejected from your mind. I want to try something. <em>Serpensortia</em>." He cast a spell, and a small snake was conjured to land on his bed. "Can you see if you can talk to it?"</p>
<p>"Um, hello there. How are you?" Harry said.</p>
<p>"English I'm afraid," Dumbledore said. He picked the snake up and agitated it a little, making it hiss. "Do you understand it?"</p>
<p>"Only its body language. It doesn't like that," Harry said. "But no, not the hissing."</p>
<p>Dumbledore dismissed the snake. "Your scar is also gone. I think those two things together prove that you no longer have Voldemort's soul inside you."</p>
<p>"Wait, what? When the <em>hell</em> were you going to tell me about that?!" Harry felt deeply violated. Sharing minds with Voldy was bad enough, but souls? Ewwww!</p>
<p>"In the fullness of time," Dumbledore said. He was pleased the boy wouldn't have to be sacrificed. "Now did you learn anything before the connection was lost?"</p>
<p>"Er, yeah. I think he was in pain and afraid of dying, even though it was impossible."</p>
<p>"Then perhaps Miss Granger's plan worked to strip him of magic. If it did, then his horcruxes might all have been rendered inert."</p>
<p>"So that means that she's the Saviour of the Wizarding World this time. Cool!" Harry said, deciding he'd ask Hermione what a horcrux was. It was probably something that had been covered in class, and he had missed out on, perhaps during one of his many infirmary stays.</p>
<p>"We cannot be sure until we find his remains, but if he has no magic, he is unlikely to be alive any longer," Dumbledore said. "Unfortunately, we now have terrible evidence of what could happen to you if you don't compete in the Triwizard Tournament."</p>
<p>Harry grimaced. "Ugh. Fine. I'll do it. But don't expect me to win or anything."</p>
