    <p> </p><p>There were bodies turning up every so often, always young men and most often twinks, and the police just couldn't figure out who was behind the crimes; and neither could anyone else that came to work the case. The men had all died of exhaustion, with the exception of a man who's stomach had burst open and a bullet had put him out of his misery. Many of them bore stretch marks, marking regular and consistent expansion beyond the norm… It was eventually hypothesized that the perpetrator is inflating her victims, and the newest one is about to get a rather horrifying surprise.</p><p>"Good morning, little Allen."</p><p>At the sound of his name, silver eyes slide open and are quickly greeted by the sight of a masked woman staring at him. The owner of the metallic irises startles and attempts to scream, but the sound is muffled by a tube that's been pushed through a silicon holder around his mouth. He tries to sit up and move his arms, but his entire body's been strapped down, and his head can only move so far. His arms are bound by shackles that are connected to chain on the wall, and his legs are trapped in psychiatric ward straps. His stomach is bare of any restrictions though, and he wonders why.</p><p>"I'm sure you have a lot of questions... And I'll make sure to answer them if any original ones come up... Anyway, you're here so I can play with your body. I'm doing this because it's fun and turns me on. I won't stop until I'm happy with the day's experiment. I'll never let you go... And my names unimportant. So, let's get started."</p><p>She reaches over to the faucet where the tubing starts and turns the valve, flooding the channel with water, and Allen's eyes widen as it spills into his mouth, a small but steady stream that quickly builds up in the confines of his cheeks. He can't spit it out because of the harness, and so he quickly starts to gulp it down once he cannot hold any more in his cheeks. The woman, upon seeing this, turns up the flow, making him have to gulp faster and faster so he can breathe, and the water flows down into his stomach. After a few minutes, he starts to feel sick, but he cannot stop, or he'll choke to death.</p><p>The woman reaches down to caress his stomach, soothing some of the pressure, and Allen feels just a little grateful. She's studying him though, and it's making him even more uncomfortable, on top the terror already running through him. Eventually, she asks, "do you not have a gag reflex?" His eyes widen, and she takes that as a yes.</p><p>The tube, it seems can be slid in further through the shield, and she does just that. The opening moves from his tongue to the back of his throat, flooding his esophagus with water, and he can't breathe! She laughs and forces it further into his trachea, and she turns the flow to full pressure, cramping his body with the nearly half a gallon that enters in the next few moments. He can't breathe; he's just about to black out win movement catches his attention. She turns the flow off for a few moments, allowing the albino to breathe, albeit harshly, before turning it back on at full blast.</p><p>He can feel his stomach start to stretch, and he glances down, around the tubing to see his bared flesh start to push upwards, forming a roundish mound that doesn't belong on a male stomach. It's a rather small mound, but on his tiny body, it looks huge. It goes on for another three minutes, the faucet turned off and on to let him breathe, and his stomach surges upwards into a more respectable bump. The uncomfortable feeling starts to turn to pain, and in the moments that he can breathe, he whimpers softly. Tears are gathering in his eyes, and he can't keep them contained. She taps on his stomach and hums before reaching over to turn off the water.</p><p>Allen gulps down the last of it and gasps for air while the woman moves around cleaning up the tubing. She pulls it free from the harness on his face and coils it up on the wall. The harness comes off first, revealing a youthful and beautiful face to her, and she's overwhelmed with a sudden feeling of desire.</p><p>She presses a kiss to his hair and unlocks the chains on his arms. "Allen-kun… I'm certain that you'll figure this out before long, but I love bellies… I love them stretched and full of whatever I can stuff them with… But you can't stretch them too much or they tear apart… And some people just don't have the endurance to be inflated too much… I've developed a serum though… But I have to run more tests on it. I hope you don't mind. You're my new subject."</p><p>She undoes the rest of the straps then and taps on a mechanical collar on his neck. "You'll do as I say, or I will electrocute you. Do you understand?" He nods. "I cannot hear your head rattle."</p><p>"Yes... Ma'am."</p><p>"Good boy… Now, slide off that bed, be mindful of your belly. I need to show you to your cell."</p><p>The woman leads him out into a hallway, and he can hear screaming in some of the rooms. "If you're bad, I'll put you through what they are, before you adapt… With as little as your body seems to hold, you'd probably explode if I went all out. So… You'd be stuck in here for three days, just to finish your punishment."</p><p>"What kind of punishment?" he asks, curiosity getting the better of his worry, because he knows that he'll react badly if he doesn't try to keep his head level.</p><p>"I have other experiments, Allen-kun… And all of them have to do with making bellies bulge out… It's best if you don't know yet."</p><p>He notices cameras following him anywhere and an AI strip on the walls, but he doesn't see another being until he enters a roundish room. The walls stack up to form cells; there must be fifty of them, and most have a person trapped inside of them. He hears crying and pain-filled moans, and some plead to be set free. All of them are trapped though, and many that he can see have burgeoning stomachs that impede their movement as they come to their cage doors to see the new arrival.</p><p>In the center of the room is bed, and he catches a glimpse of greyish flesh amongst the piles of pillows and blankets. He realizes not a few moments later that this creature cannot be human. "Master…" the creature in the center purrs, and a raven-haired head raises up, golden eyes shining in the dim lighting. Allen shivers as he gets a good look at these eyes, and he unconsciously takes a step backwards. "You haven't played with me in days… Did I do something bad?"</p><p>"Of course not, Nea," the woman murmurs, "and once I put Allen in his cage, I'll play with you to your heart's content. Will this suffice?"</p><p>"I suppose…" He looks over the albino, appraising him, and when he comes to his stomach, a grin breaks out on his face. "He's pretty… Will you keep him if the experiments work?"</p><p>"If you want me to, of course." She stoops and presses a kiss to his hair. "Now lay down for a little while… I'll be back soon."</p><p>
