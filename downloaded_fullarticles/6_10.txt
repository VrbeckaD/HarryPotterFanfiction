  <b>Chapter One - The Boy Who Survived</b>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry had been “home” -- if Number 4 Privet Drive could be called any such thing -- from Hogwarts for four days. He had discovered quickly that “Dudders” was newly on a strict diet. The good news with this was that he no longer had to get up before dawn and cook enough to feed an army… or one walrus, one whale, and a stork. Neither small bowls of plain bran cereal with skim milk (Harry got water in his instead) nor quarters of unsweetened grapefruit required cooking or even much in the way of preparation. The bad news… more fresh produce and smaller portions meant more frequent trips to the grocer’s. Most people might not see this as a bad thing. Most people weren’t the primary source of entertainment for a bunch of budding psychopath teenagers. Nor would they be punished for the resulting delay in getting home, stolen money or dropped food.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And that was entirely leaving aside the fact that smaller portions for </span>
  <em>
    <span>them</span>
  </em>
  <span> meant far less scraps for him, and not being the one cooking meant fewer chances to snitch some extra. It would be a few more days before his stomach got used to not having access to the largess of Hogwarts again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>With the distraction of his stomach grumbling, perhaps it wasn’t so surprising that the voice took him by surprise.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>down on the other side of things</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>the triggers fast and light</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>bringing home this emptiness</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>for which you had to fight</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry paused warily in his furtive hustle through the park, kicking himself for missing it. Normally, hearing any voice in this broken down park was a sure sign he needed to run, as it was almost guaranteed to be Dudley and his gang. This voice, though, was… </span>
  <em>
    <span>new. </span>
  </em>
  <span>He listened carefully, tasting the sounds: no braying, cruel laughs, no loud jeers, none of the hallmarks of the area’s leading bullies tormenting some poor kid. Instead, the only sound was a woman’s voice, </span>
  <em>
    <span>singing.</span>
  </em>
  <span> People don’t </span>
  <em>
    <span>sing </span>
  </em>
  <span>in Little Whinging. They’re a Respectable Lot, Thank You. It’s </span>
  <em>
    <span>just not done. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The clean alto voice didn’t mumble or pause, but rang out loud and clear like they didn’t </span>
  <em>
    <span>care</span>
  </em>
  <span> what people thought. And the words...</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>it doesn't matter if you're giving</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>for they do not compromise</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>the world will keep you guessing</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>until the day you die</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry didn’t think he’d ever heard any song that… that </span>
  <em>
    <span>meant</span>
  </em>
  <span> something, that hit home the way this did, that called and beckoned in the quiet. Little Whinging didn’t like music much, and when they did it was either prosaic and staid, or empty, bubbly nonsense, a fitting backdrop for their prosaic, staid, humdrum lives. </span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span><br/>
</span>
  <span>This... wasn’t that. He found himself edging closer to the sounds, caution fading in the onslaught of curiosity. Was it a wizard? He knew, logically, that not all muggles were Little Whinging Muggles, but he’d never actually met one who wasn’t.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>And everyone will say "I told you so"</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>yeah they'll all just nod and sigh</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>but I'll make a run at something real</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>and they'll never even try</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The voice was a woman, laying in the shade of one of the trees in the center of the park. If it weren’t for the blood red headphones connected to a boxy bit of technology he knew from Dudley’s friends was called an iPod, he’d have thought his idea of it being someone with magic confirmed, she was so oddly dressed. Black and red were the only colors he could see on her, in the oddest mix of leather, rags, brocade, and lace finery he’d ever seen. Some kind of netting, which seemed torn in half a dozen spots, safety pins, and frayed edges were everywhere, but her corset, leather boots, and the lace skirt worn over the skin-tight, torn black jeans were all in perfect condition. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Who even wears a blood red corset to the park on a summer day? </span>
  </em>
  <span>Well, some of the Slytherin girls might, if they could, though theirs would probably be green, grey, or black. And the collection of what appeared to be raven and crow feathers woven into the dozens of braids on her head just added more confusion.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>and everyone will say "I told you so"</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>yeah they'll all just nod and sigh</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>as I go down in a ball of flames</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>they'll just watch, I wonder why</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She popped an eye open, looked at him and smiled. Harry couldn’t help but feel things were about to change.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m Mabon, Mab if you like. Mad Mab if you don’t like. Who’re you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Harry,” said Harry, a bit confused by someone smiling at him who didn’t know who he was.  “Harry Potter. Um…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He didn’t know what to say.  He wanted to ask if she was a witch, but if she wasn’t she might be offended by the question, and even if she wasn’t upset, that might break the laws about secrecy.  He wanted to ask why she was dressed like that, where she got the feathers, and wasn’t the corset hot, but those were all things that people probably asked a lot, and not in a nice way.  He wanted to know… everything, but he couldn’t find a way to ask anything.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well, Harry Potter, if you like the singing, pull up some grass and stay a bit.  Can you keep a beat?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No idea, but I’d like to try,” Harry said, sitting down beside her.  “I can’t stay long. I have to get back or my Aunt and Uncle will...”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He stopped.  In his experience, telling people about what happened in Number 4 Privet Drive ended with them going away.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah,” Mab said.  “Understood. When you get time, my friends and I like to meet by the gazebo down Magnolia, across from the cut-through to Wisteria.  You should come by, meet people, maybe learn to sing along.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’d like that,” Harry said. The look she gave him was confusing, but Harry suspected she was telling the truth when she said she understood. But understood what? He hadn’t said anything… Had he?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>***</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Over the course of the next weeks, Harry met the most baffling group of people whenever Aunt Petunia insisted he be out of the house, or he was locked out. The latter being this year’s preferred punishment as the threat of My-Godfather-The-Escaped-Mass-Murderer handily removed the option for worse ones.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>One of the boys in the group looked like he’d walked straight out of a Sherlock Holmes novel, one of the girls clearly drew inspiration from the Brontes’ novels, one wore an almost exact replica of what Lady Malfoy had been wearing when she picked Draco up from the Express, another girl seemed nearly as tall as Hagrid, what with the foot-plus-tall mohawk and the eight-inch-platform boots, one of the older boys -- probably an adult technically, in all honesty, but no older than any of the Weasley boys, and thus, to Harry's almost-fourteen mind, still counted as a kid -- had shaggy black hair past his shoulders, black fingernails, piercings and snake tattoos. Mab and a few others seemed to change their styles daily, though never in any way that passed as “normal”. One boy, about the age of Percy, looked exactly like the goblin king from a movie he’d watched at Mrs. Figg’s last summer, except he was all in black and dark purple, right down to the glitter.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Every last one of them had a weird name, even by wizarding standards.  The tall girl with the taller hair went by Tick, like the blood sucking insects or the sound of a clock, or maybe Tic, like an involuntary spasm.  Harry had felt it might be rude to ask. The boy in handsewn turn of the century replicas went by Pink. The probable adult proudly introduced himself as Troll.  Harry couldn’t help but compare him to the troll they’d fought first year, and before he could stop it his mouth had opened.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You smell much nicer than the last troll I met, and you’re better dressed.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Fortunately, Troll the Human laughed at that.  The sparkly one laughed with a full throated sound Harry wished he knew how to make, ruffled his hair with a hand trailing sparkles, and proclaimed him a wit.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wit, Wit, y’know that’s a good name if you like it,” Mab said brightly.  Harry looked at her cautiously. She gave him a sad smile. “Keep it if you want.  It’s a gift.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I hadn’t meant to Name him!” protested the yet unintroduced leather clad teen.  “He should get to choose his own, like the rest of us. It’s not fair to take his Naming, Mab.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She shook her head.  “Call it a training Name if it makes you feel better, Bowie.  He’s overwhelmed, just look at him. We need to give him some things easy.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Troll the Human looked at Mab with the same sad look Mab gave Harry.  “Next time,” he said slowly, deliberately moving the topic with the precision Hermione moved her wand, “let’s have ourselves a feast.  Music, food, and merriment, no better balms to the human soul.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The group began discussing what all they would bring to the gazebo, dishes and drinks and instruments and other odds and ends.  Mab grabbed his hand as he backed into the corner. “Don’t worry, the newbie never buys. This is… a welcome. A reunion.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’ve never met any of you before, though,” Harry said.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Doesn’t make you not one of us, Wit.  Doesn’t make you not family. Long lost, maybe, prodigal even, but you’re like us, one of us, in your heart.  Where it matters, you’re just an old friend we hadn’t met before. We’ll have another feast when Kothaar and Vvornth get back from going a viking.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Just roll with it, there’s a lad,” said Pink with a hearty back slap that somehow avoided all the bruises Harry hid under his unseasonable jumper.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Roll with it. Harry could do that, it's how he got through every year of strangeness and danger and people being...</span>
  <em>
    <span>people </span>
  </em>
  <span>at Hogwarts, after all.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ever confused by these strange people who had pulled him in, accepted him, claimed him as theirs faster than Gryffindor did without even the Sorting Hat there to tell them he belonged, Harry, newly dubbed Wit for the time being, settled into the feast. He found dozens more things to be confused about, and firmly decided "Roll with it" was the best advice he could have been given.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Complete strangers were having a feast in his honor, just because he was there? His plate wasn't too big or too small, and kept full of light weight, bite-sized, healthy food, despite there being plenty of heavy, fattening foods that would no doubt have made him sick just then? Everyone listened when he spoke, but no one </span>
  </em>
  <em>
    <span>watched</span>
  </em>
  <em>
    <span> him? There was a heated debate about some book or other, complete with a whole new level of swear words for him, but the participants laughed and were still friends? Everyone stayed where he could see them, and though they pounced and tackled each other, seemed to wait for his permission to touch him?</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shaking his head, he slipped into HogwartsHarry, letting the affable and snarky parts of himself out a bit more. HogwartsHarry was better at "just rolling with it" than Little WhingingHarry was.</span>
