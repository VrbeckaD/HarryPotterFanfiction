  <p> It was a quiet Monday morning. You were eating breakfast when a brown barn owl flew in through the kitchen window. It dropped a letter addressed to Ella Fey Emerson, 12 Avalon Place. Your heart jumped a little.Your Hogwarts letter had finally arrived. A new year at Hogwarts always excited you. You were a geek like that. You opened the letter and readâ€¦</p>
  <p>
    <i> Dear Ms. Emerson,<br/>
We would like to inform you that you have been accepted for your 5th year to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.... </i>
  </p>
  <p>You quickly scanned through the letter to see what books and supplies were needed for your 5th year. As you did so your mother walked into the kitchen and began to serve herself some breakfast. She made herself the breakfast of champions. A great big bowl of cereal and a cup of juice. She took the seat at the small dining table across from you.</p>
  <p>"So what's on list this year?" She asked as she scooped a spoonful of cereal goodness into her mouth.<br/>
You handed the letter over to her. She looked it over as she chewed.<br/>
"This is one hefty list you got here." She stated. "I don't know if I could afford this by myself." She thought outloud.</p>
  <p>You frowned. You felt bad. Your mother and you lived a modest life. She made enough with a bit of extra cushion, but you knew the advance classes you were taking at Hogwarts didn't help her much. Second hand books in those classes were hard to come by. And it wasn't exactly her idea for you to attend Hogwarts to began with. </p>
  <p>"I could help!" You chimined in. "I've been saving up my money!"</p>
  <p>"It's okay, sweetie." She set the letter down on the table. "Save your money. I'll just pick up a few over time shifts at work."<br/>
Although, your mother was a pure blooded witch, she worked as a Correctional Officer at a muggle prison. Your mother had long black hair that fell to her waist. She stood about 5'4 and was slender, but curvy. However, despite her small stature she was tough. She wasn't someone to cross. </p>
  <p>"Maybe... I can ask Dad if he could help?" You hesistantly suggested.</p>
  <p>You knew this was probably a bad idea. Your parents weren't together. They separated when you were just a toddler. Because of this your mother hated asking him for any help, especially if it involved money. It's not that they didn't get along. In fact, they got a long great. They had a very healthy relationship for a couple that was no longer together.<br/>
You had ask her once why they weren't together anymore.<br/>
She had told you that your father had proposed to her and she had told him no. When you asked her why she said that she loved your dad very much and that he was a good man, but she wasn't ready for that kind of commitment.<br/>
Your mother cried well she told you the story. It was obvious rejecting him hurt her greatly.<br/>
It was the last time you ever brought it up.</p>
  <p>"Don't be silly. I'll take care of  your school supplies. Don't you worry about a thing." She finalized.<br/>
You remained silent. By the tone of her voice, you knew the conversation was over.<br/>
"So what are you going to do today?" She asked as she finished up the rest of her breakfast.</p>
  <p>"I don't know. Probably stay home. I have some homework to finish up. What time are you out of work?" </p>
  <p>"I work a double. So I'll be home late. I'll leave you some cash just incase you decide to order out for dinner."</p>
  <p>"I'll be fine." You told her. You didn't want her forking out anymore money than she needed to, especially after the previous conversation. "I'll just whip something up." You grabbed her finished bowl of cereal and took your empty plate to the sink. "Thanks though."</p>
  <p>"Just don't burn my house down." She teased.</p>
  <p>"Mooomm!" You groaned while rolling her eyes at her.</p>
  <p>"Just kidding sweetie. I'm going to get going before I'm late. Love you." She kissed your cheek.</p>
  <p>"Love you too. Have a good day at work."</p>
  <p>"Thanks, sweetie. And remember... if you leave the house-"</p>
  <p>"Don't go alone." You finished. "I know! Now go. You're going to be late." You pushed her out of the kitchen. </p>
  <p>"Bye! Have a good day."</p>
  <p>

  </p>
  <p>After showering and getting dressed for the day, which was basically jumping right back into pajamas since you were planning to stay in, you flopped open your books.<br/>
Luckily, you didn't have much homework left. You were an excellent student. Top marks in all your classes.<br/>
You were just about to finish up the rest of your work when the phone rang.<br/>
You reached over to your nightstand and picked up the phone.</p>
  <p>"Hello?"</p>
