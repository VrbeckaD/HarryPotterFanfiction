    <p>Harry dive tackled Cedric in pure instinct, feeling the sickly green spell fly just over her head. Cedric hit the ground with a surprised grunt, but Harry turned her dive into a roll, whipping out her wand as she went.</p><p> </p><p>“Get out of the way ya dumbass!” Harry hissed at the older boy and shot several wordless charms back at the rat bastard. Pettigrew let out a pathetic yelp and nearly dropped the bundle he was carrying, backtracking away from the oncoming spells.</p><p> </p><p>“What’s going on?” Cedric shouted in panic as Harry erected the strongest protego she could manage to protect them both from Pettigrew’s returning fire. The idiot had yet to cast anything yet.</p><p> </p><p>“Best guess? Karkaroff is a bitch ass narc who's gonna get what’s comin ta him.” Harry replied angrily as Cedric finally pulled his shit together and started returning fire.</p><p> </p><p>“What does that even mean?” Cedric asked as he started to focus on the matter at hand. Harry rolled her eyes and grinned savagely as a particularly dark (but still legal, Harry checked) curse landed on the rat’s leg. </p><p> </p><p>“It means we gotta beat the shit outa this asshat, figure out how to get back ta Hogwarts, and hunt down whoever sabotaged the portkey. Preferably without getting our asses handed ta us in return.” Harry replied through gritted teeth, her scar fuckin <em> burned </em>. Judging by the liquid slipping down her forehead, she was willing to bet it started bleeding again.</p><p> </p><p>“Since when do you have an accent?” Cedric asked, clearly focusing on the important part of the conversation. Harry breathed out through her nose and blocked another one of Pettigrew’s curses.</p><p> </p><p>“I have no such thing. The way I see it, everyone else has an accent. Sometimes when I’m stressed I slip back into my childhood vernacular.” Harry made a conscious effort to keep her British accent and conjured a set of throwing knives in her left hand. The moment he put up another powerful magic shield, she whipped them at the pudgy man. The blades passed seamlessly through the shield designed to block spells and sunk into his shoulder, chest, and leg. Pettigrew went down with a scream. Wuss.</p><p> </p><p>“Where did you learn that?” Cedric gave her an alarmed look.</p><p> </p><p>“From my older brother.” Harry shrugged as they cautiously approached the whimpering man. Cedric threw a body bind at the fugitive and winced when it put a painful amount of tension on the knives still embedded in his body.</p><p> </p><p>“I didn’t know you have a brother.” Cedric replied, clearly trying not to look at the strung-up man. </p><p> </p><p>“I mean. He’s dead so had would be more accurate.” Harry replied with a shrug as she walked over to where the bundle of cloth was lying on the ground. </p><p> </p><p>“What? Oh my god, I’m so sor-” The embarrassed, shocked, and slightly ashamed look on his face made Harry snort.</p><p> </p><p>“Please. You didn’t kill him, and no one seems to care that the rest of my family was violently murdered in front of me when I was a small child. Why should the fact that my brother was violently murdered a little bit later draw such shock and pity-” Harry cut off with a yelp and dodged right, narrowly avoiding the lunging fangs of a giant snake. Cedric swore and barely had time to bring his wand up before a loud BANG! Had him flinching away. When he looked back, The snake was missing its head, bits of flesh littered the ground around where the head should have been. If it wasn’t for the fact that Cedric had been too nervous to eat this morning, he’s sure he would have thrown up. </p><p> </p><p>“What the heck was that?” He demanded, turning to Harry who had some sort of small muggle device in her hand. </p><p> </p><p>“Never seen a gun before?” Harry asked off-handedly as she approached the bundle with much more caution and attention. </p><p> </p><p>“A what?” Cedric was somewhere between baffled and horrified.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s a muggle toy- HOLY FUCKING SHIT WHAT THE FUCK?!?!” Harry had been in the process of carefully poking the bundle with her wand when she suddenly shrieked and jumped back.</p><p> </p><p>“What is it?” Cedric rushed over.</p><p> </p><p>“Its some sorta demented fucking alien demon baby! Oh fuck I touched it with my wand. I’m never using this wand again it's probably infected with creepy alien demon germs.” Harry ranted as she dropped her wand in disgust. Cedric moved to see for himself when Harry shrieked again.</p><p> </p><p>“NO! DON’T TOUCH IT! FUCKING BURN IT! BURN IT WITH FIRE!” Harry shouted. </p><p> </p><p>“Um okay?” Cedric pulled out his wand and glanced at her.</p><p> </p><p>“Are you sure?” Harry stared at him incredulously and snatched his wand out of his hand, ignoring his shout of protest, and turned toward the bundle. Without hesitation, she shouted</p><p> </p><p>“FIENDFYRE!” And Cedric could only watch in horror as fire erupted from his wand, taking the shape of a giant bird, before mauling the bundle of fabric. An unholy scream broke out from the flame and a black ghostly tornado of energy burst from the flames and made to attack them. Cedric tripped backward, staring in horror at his impending doom. The fiendfyre however, was not done with the apparition yet. It raised its wings and launched itself at the apparition, fiery talons outstretched with malevolent intent of its own. </p><p> </p><p>“ITS TIME TO GO!” Harry shouted less hysterically than before. Cedric numbly let Harry shove him to his feet and toward the tied up Pettigrew, who was watching the rapidly expanding fire in horror.</p><p> </p><p>“What about your wand?” Cedric found himself asking distractedly as he too stared at the horrifying fire.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s Krum’s so he can worry about getting it back on his own. Asshole tried to kill me earlier.” Harry muttered and shoved him practically on top of the still bleeding Pettigrew. Then glared at rat-man.</p><p> </p><p>“Will the Cup take us out of here?” She demanded icily. Pettigrew nodded feverishly. Without another word, she summoned the cup and grabbed both of them. They vanished a moment before the raging inferno caught up with them. </p><p> </p><p>. . . </p><p> </p><p>~ 7 Years Earlier ~</p><p> </p><p>“Freda Smith?” A kind white woman with expensive-looking blonde hair and glasses looked down at her sheet and frowned, marking an absent on the sheet.</p><p> </p><p>“She’s right there teacher lady” A little girl (Jenna?) sitting crossed legged in front of called out and pointed to a little redheaded girl in the back row. The little girl had short cropped flaming red hair that looked like it had been cut with a knife or some other sharp instrument. She was dressed in thin, worn clothes that were a little too big or small, and had seen better days. The girl hadn’t spoken to her or any other student yet in the time Ms. Jones had been here. The redhead’s perpetual scowl deepened.</p><p> </p><p>“Thank you, Jenna, but please raise your hand next time. Are you Freda?” Ms. Jones asked the little unidentified redhead with a frown.</p><p> </p><p>“That’s not my name.” The girl said with a scowl.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, it is. You’re Freda!” The little girl in the front row blurted out angrily.</p><p> </p><p>“Please raise your hand if you want to speak Jenna. Now, can you tell me what your name is miss?” Ms. Jones gave her kindest smile to the little redhead and was surprised when her green eyes narrowed and her face scrunched up.</p><p> </p><p>“It's not <em>Freda</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>“Well, how about you tell me when I call on you?” Ms. Jones asked with a smile and watched the girl nod, face still tight.</p><p> </p><p>Five minutes later, the roll call was done, and the girl did not indicate that her name was called. Out of the five children absent, Freda was the only female name on the list. Ms. Jones settled the children into a morning snack of Goldfish and then sat herself down next to the small girl.</p><p> </p><p>“Can you tell me your name now?” The little girl scowled at her but didn’t answer. </p><p> </p><p>“Did you lie to me earlier when I asked what your name was?” Ms. Jones decided that she needed to be stern with this girl. She may be a new teacher, but she’d read up on teaching in an inner-city school like Gotham. Children needed to respect you, and trust you if you wanted them to learn. She would punish the girl if she continued with this attitude, but it would be a fair standard punishment that would show she meant business.</p><p> </p><p>“No. My name isn’t <em> Freda </em>.” The little girl spat the name with such disgust, that Ms. Jones started to believe her if only a little bit. </p><p> </p><p>“Then can you tell me what your name is?” The girl scowled but didn’t say anything more.</p><p> </p><p>“If you can’t tell me your name, I’m going to have to have a talk with Mr. Peters. You don’t want that now do you?” Ms. Jones asked gently, the girl scowled and shook her head.</p><p> </p><p>“Now I don’t want that either, so all you have to do is tell me, and we can continue on with class.” Ms. Jones waited through another thirty seconds of silence before sighing. She pulled out her cracked radio and called for a backup while she brought the girl down to the vice principal’s office. The girl glared at her the whole way and Ms. Jones honestly didn’t know how to deal with this refusal to talk. She sat the girl down in one of the chairs next to an older boy with an equally grim frown. His clothes were several sizes too big, and he was holding a bag of frozen vegetables to his chin. For a moment, Ms. Jones wondered if the little girl would be safe sitting next to him, but quickly realized that she no other choice if she wanted to speak to the VP alone. After giving the girl a stern reminder to stay there, she left her in the chair furthest from the boy and entered the office. </p><p> </p><p>“So you met Freda.” Mr. Peters stated, looking far too overworked.</p><p> </p><p>“So that is her name. She lied and refused to work with me this morning.” Ms. Jones stated, trying to stand taller. Mr. Peters snorted.</p><p> </p><p>“Look. Amelia was it? Right. Freda is the least of your problems. She brings her whole class’s average reading level up. She’s mostly silent, doesn’t start fights with the other kids, and can be trusted to hold scissors for more than five seconds without hurting anyone. Aside from refusal to answer to her name, she has displayed no attention disorders, behavior disorders, or any other condition that we know of. She is going to be your ideal student. There are kids in your class who are actually going to need to be sent to me for discipline and she is not one of them.” The man said with a deep sigh, Ms. Jones was offended on the principle of the matter.</p><p> </p><p>“She clearly needs attention. What do her parents have to say about this?” She demanded. Mr. Peters snorted.</p><p> </p><p>“Look. I know your new and all but you need to realize that no one’s parents are going to get involved, least of all hers. Freda was found wandering the streets about a year ago. They have no record of her name or family. Her last name was assigned to her by the system. Apparently, she told her caseworker that her name was Freda, but has refused to be associated with the name ever since. And she’s not special around here. Take the kid out there. That’s Jason. He has no father in the picture and on the rare days when his mother shows up to pick him up, she’s high as a kite. When we try talking to her about the fact that her son picks a fight with every kid who he thinks is so much as giving him a weird look.” Ms. Jones was speechless for a moment before alarm set in.</p><p> </p><p>“We need to get Freda away from-” She started to say, but Mr. Peters snorted.</p><p> </p><p>“She’s fine. Jason also has a tendency to only pick fights with kids who are significantly bigger than him. He also has been known to pick fights with anyone who he catches bullying the younger kids. That, and they’re neighbors. He walks her home every day. He’s not a bad kid.” Mr. Peters said dismissively.</p><p> </p><p>“How can you be so casual about this?” Ms. Jones asked, horrified at his casual dismissal. </p><p> </p><p>“It comes with the job. If you can’t handle it, then wait until the end of the year to quit. There's no chance of finding someone new until the next batch of desperate rookies graduate in spring.” Mr. Peters rolled his eyes.</p><p> </p><p>“Now get back to your class and take Freda with you. I need to call Jason’s mother, not that she’ll answer.” Mr. Peters said the last more to himself than anything and ended the conversation by picking up the phone and dialing a number from memory. Ms. Jones left the office, stunned. Freda had, in fact, moved. She was sitting next to Jason with her feet dangling off the chair. The boy-Jason-threw his head back and laughed. </p><p> </p><p>“Dem’s fightin words pipsqueak. Ya don’ wanna pick a fight wit me.” To Ms. Jones’s horror, he gave her a shark’s grin and flicked the child on the nose. </p><p> </p><p>“Freda! It’s time to go back to class.” Freda’s face shut down and she scowled fiercely, as Ms. Jones grabbed her wrist to pull her away from the violent boy as quickly as possible. The delinquent boy rolled his eyes and waved at the Freda as she was yanked away. To Ms. Jones’s horror, Freda, a seven-year-old, gave him the middle finger in return, the boy cackled.</p><p> </p><p>“Freda!”</p><p> </p>
