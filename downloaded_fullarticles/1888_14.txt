  <strong>The Fool</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <em>The Fool represents new beginnings, having faith in the future, being inexperienced, not knowing what to expect, having beginner's luck, improvisation and believing in the universe</em>
</p>
<p>The barrier didn’t look magical, or even out of place. It just looked like another part of an ordinary train station. A flicker of fear crossed Lily’s mind, that maybe Tuney was right, maybe Severus really had made it all up to make her look silly. She dismissed the thought at once; the owls, and her letter, and all the things she’d seen on Diagon Alley were real. Her magic was real. All the same, the barrier didn’t look any less solid.  She was starting to feel self-conscious, aware that there were people behind her, waiting, though she didn’t turn to look.</p>
<p>‘I can go first,’ said Severus. ‘If you’re nervous.’</p>
<p>That settled it. ‘Don’t be silly.’ Lily grinned at him, and gripped the trolley. She moved forward, quick like Mrs Snape had told her, and in a moment she was on another platform, with Severus hot on her heels.</p>
<p>‘Wow.’ Lily scarcely knew where to look next. The huge scarlet steam train, the trollies piled high with trunks and loose cauldrons and owls in cages, the swirling mass of people. Witches and wizards, people like <em>her</em>. She was looking everywhere, enthralled, and probably Severus was doing the same. Perhaps if they’d focused on looking where they were going  instead of trying to see everything at once they might not have collided with a group of older students, sending someone’s cat screeching across the platform, and Sev’s gobstones scattering in all directions.</p>
<p>‘Watch out!’ yelped Severus, arms flapping as he tried and failed to catch the escaping gobstones.</p>
<p>Most of the other students laughed and walked away but one, a girl who looked about thirteen or fourteen stopped to help.</p>
<p>‘First time?’ she asked Lily with a smile. ‘You’ll get used to it. First day of term is always chaos. My name’s Alice, by the way.’</p>
<p>‘Lily. And this is my friend Severus.’ Lily held out her hand, always mindful of her manners. Alice laughed, and put a sweet in Lily’s hand. </p>
<p>‘Look lively, Fortescue,’ said a voice behind Lily.  ‘Is that your owl making off with a stolen pipe?’</p>
<p>‘What?’ Alice glanced around distractedly. ‘Oh no, Gianduja!’ she cried, turning around and racing towards a fluffy brown owl, which seemed to be trying to fly onto the train, still-smoking pipe wedged firmly in its talons.</p>
<p>Lily turned back to see a tall, dark haired young woman strolling towards them. She wore a long cloak of green brocade, with a badge reading “Head Girl” glinting on the collar. Everything about her was elegant and poised, making her the most glamorous person Lily had ever seen.</p>
<p>‘Hurry up, you pair, or you’ll never get decent seats,’ said the woman, gathering up the spilt gobstones and returning them to their box with a flick of her wand. Another flick and the loose rope tied around Severus’ trunk was neatly tied, and both his and Lily’s trunks were sitting upright again.</p>
<p>‘I – what’s the best place to sit?’ asked Lily. Clearly they’d found someone who knew exactly what she was doing  and she was Head Girl. Who better to ask for advice?</p>
<p>‘Follow me.’</p>
<p>Lily tugged at Sev’s sleeve, grinning with excitement as they followed their rescuer, levitating trunks and all, along the platform. The carriages were quickly filling up with students, but they eventually found one with only two students – both boys, about Lily’s age. </p>
<p>‘Budge up, squirt, I found another couple of firsties to share with you. Try to play nicely and not set anyone on fire.’</p>
<p>One of the boys made a vague effort to pull himself out of the two seats he was lounging across and into an upright position.  ‘Hey Andromeda,’ he said.  ‘You been looking for more people to boss around?’</p>
<p>‘Cheek of you,’ said Andromeda, but she didn’t seem angry. ‘And brave, considering how many embarrassing stories I could tell your new friends.’</p>
<p>Andromeda swiftly got Lily and Severus settled, and made sure proper introductions were made all around.  The two boys were Sirius Black and James Potter, who was apparently the son of someone very famous and important to do with potions. Severus seemed very impressed by him. Sirius was Andromeda’s cousin, and he looked a lot like her, only not quite so cool. To be fair, though, there probably wasn’t anybody as cool as Andromeda.</p>
<p>‘You’re in Slytherin, right?’ Severus asked Andromeda. He’d been going on about them both getting into Slytherin for months. Lily hadn’t the heart to tell him she’d rather live in a tower than underground.</p>
<p>‘That’s right,’ said Andromeda.  ‘Family tradition.’</p>
<p>Severus looked pleased, but James let out a dramatic huff of disapproval. ‘Ugh, am I surrounded by snakes?’</p>
<p>‘None of us have been sorted yet,’ pointed out Lily. She didn’t see why it had to be such a big deal which house everyone was in – they were all going to the same school, after all. To learn <em>magic</em>. Wasn’t that more important?</p>
<p>‘That’s right,’ agreed Sirius. ‘Maybe we’ll all be Hufflepuffs.’</p>
<p>Lily was pleased that there was someone sensible enough to agree with her, until she saw James roaring with laughter.</p>
<p>‘You should all be so lucky,’ said Andromeda. She leant over, and whispered into Lily’s ear. ‘Hufflepuffs are the best kissers.’</p>
<p>Then she winked and turned away, heading through the carriage into the main corridor.  The boys all watched her go, then turned back to Lily with curious expressions.</p>
<p>‘What was that all about?’ demanded Severus.</p>
<p>Her cheeks felt warm, and Lily was fairly sure they were as red as her hair, but she did her best to shrug and act nonchalant, like she thought Andromeda might. ‘Oh, nothing any of you would understand,’ she said loftily. ‘Girl talk.’</p>
