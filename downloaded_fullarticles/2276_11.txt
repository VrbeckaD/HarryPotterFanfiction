      <span class="">Draco wadded up yet another sheet of parchment and tossed it in the bin, now half full of letters that held all the wrong words.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class=""> It had been two years. </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="">Two long years of not hearing his voice, not feeling his body, not seeing his face. Well, that wasn't exactly true. Draco still had the Prophet clipping from a few months back. He'd memorized Harry's smile, even though it was meant for another. </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="">Oliver Wood.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="">Before he could change his mind he penned a short note.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class=""> <em>Please meet with me. Tonight. </em></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class=""> <em>You know where. </em> </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class=""> <em>D</em> </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class=""> He stared at it before attaching it to his owl and watched as it flew away. He just hoped Harry showed up. </span>
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p> </p>
    <p>
      <span class="">Draco sat on the bench along the lake, not far from the pub where they'd had their first date.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class=""> "Malfoy." </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="">Draco snapped to attention and smiled at the sight of Harry. He stood several feet away and had his hands stuffed in his pockets. Even though his voice was cold, he had missed it.<br/> </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="">"You came." When Harry didn't say anything Draco felt the panic from before. "Hear me out, okay? I had to leave, I couldn't just-"</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class=""> "I know why you left." Harry said, cutting him off. "I know everything. How you took care of him, how you petitioned the Ministry to lift his exile, how you did everything you could. What I don't know, is why you didn't tell me."</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class=""> "He hated you." Draco whimpered. "Even on his deathbed my father still cursed your existence. I couldn't- I didn't want... Even when we were strangers I loved you. I still love you. I couldn't ask that much of you."</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class=""> "I understand why you left, family has always been important to the both of us. I just assumed I was family, too." Harry held up his left hand. "When you gave this to me, I thought it meant something." </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="">Draco gaped at the ring that was still on his finger. "You... you've worn it all this time?" </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="">Harry nodded. "I'm still in love with you, too, Draco."</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class=""> "What about Wood?" Draco asked before he could stop himself. Harry looked confused. "Didn't you read the article? He asked me to be best man at his wedding after he won that championship game. I'll admit the headline was rubbish<em> 'Friendship Turned More'</em>. Percy was pissed about it for weeks."</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class=""> Draco rushed to him, crushing him with two years worth of starvation. The song that always seemed to play reached them, as they danced in the moonlight.</span>
