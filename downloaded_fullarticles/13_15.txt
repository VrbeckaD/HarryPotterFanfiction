    <p>Chapter 1 - Crow</p><p> </p><p>Her footsteps were brisk and silent as she made her way down the street, neither too fast nor slow, no clues of her intentions can be afforded to be given away by actions. It was evening, the rush hour was on full swing. Roads were swamped with cars and the Muggles didn't seem to pay much heed to the speed limits. Despite the crowd, it wasn't that difficult for her to notice the two hooded figures tailing her.</p><p> </p><p>The wands firmly grasped in their hands weren't that hard to spot as well, not that the same can be said for all the Muggles flocking about.</p><p> </p><p>Her eyes darted to and fro before closing her left eye, as though focusing on the right eye gave all the clarity she needed. Her hand reached up and trailed the scar running down her right eye, from the centre of the eyebrow straight down by two inches. She moved away from the scar and pushed back a stray lock of raven hair behind her ear, whilst tilting her head ever slightly to give her vision of the two figure.</p><p> </p><p>They were wearing masks as well. She inwardly snorted. As though the wands weren't blatant enough. The pair may as well be holding up placards saying 'We are a pair of wizards and we are tailing you'.</p><p> </p><p>The foreign sounding conversations from a passing couple brought the girl out from her reverie. The pair cannot stay on her tail for long, she was going to have to lose them. She didn't have much of an advantage though, she only had her wand with her at the moment, no potions, no devices, no equipment, nothing to tilt the scales of balance in her favour.</p><p> </p><p>How was a yet-to-be-fourteen girl supposed to lose a pair of adult wizards tailing her without openly compromising the Statue of Secrecy? Dragging in the local Magical Law Enforcement is a last resort.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Think, think, think.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>A loud beep of a nearby sedan, following by the guffaw of a pair of passing Muggles, "şübhəsiz zarafat edirsiniz."</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>What were the Azerbaijani Laws for Magical Transportation again? Floo is out of the question. Can't apparate myself. Portkeys... portkeys in Azerbaijan... that's right, unrestricted and untracked.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>She stole another glance at the hooded pair.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Can't really just portkey out, if they are on my tail, that means they tracked and traced my previous three portkey destination signatures. On top of that, three portkey hops already put my head in shambles, can't afford another one.</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Or can I...</em>
</p><p> </p><p>She opened her left eye again, as though the right eye had shown her what she need to see. Taking a turn to a two-storey building, she dug her left hand into her jumper and drew her wand, surreptitiously cast an unlocking charm on the door and tried the knob. As she crossed the threshold, she could already guess that the pair of hunters were quickening their steps, she had a scant half-minute to get ready. Pointing the wand at the outside doorknob, she muttered a quick, "<em>Diffindo</em>" and caught the severed doorknob, tossing it to the side. A sidelong glance revealed a bowl of fruits, probably for decoration or visitors. Well, the apple would do. She grabbed and started twisting her wand in small circular motions, eyes squinted in concentration. The apple slowly morphed to become more golden and spherical, before finally settling on the appearance of the severed doorknob. A sticking charm to the door soon followed. Finally, she tapped the apple-turned-doorknob and said, "<em>Portus</em>".</p><p> </p><p>Nodding at the temporary blue glow in approval, she closed the door with the inside doorknob before heading up the stairs. Reaching the second storey, she headed for the room that gave her a view over the door. Upon entering, she caught the attention of a middle-aged man who was stooped over a desk full of paperwork.</p><p> </p><p>"Sən kimsən? Bu xüsusi mülkdür!"</p><p> </p><p>"<em>Confundo</em>" rolled off her lips easily before shoving the man in a corner of the room. One second's worth of memory seeing her wouldn't warrant a memory charm, the man would forget about it.</p><p> </p><p>A glance down the window showed that, just in time, the pair were on the doorstep. The taller of the two pointed his wand at the house and the girl felt a familiar swooping sensation pass through the house. A <em>'Homenum revelio</em>' well done, at least the pair had some sense of professionalism. The girl could feel her heart beating faster as the adrenaline begun to enter the bloodstream. The taller one nodded in satisfaction and reached to open the door. Her emerald green eyes shone from the blue glow from the doorknob, or more likely from satisfaction. The taller one was tugged out of sight as though by an invisible hook, the 'doorknob' vanishing along with him. The shorter one froze on the spot, wand arm hanging aloof.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Element of surprise always works I guess.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Suddenly, an ear-piercing screech of rubber on asphalt rang through the air, followed by a sicking 'crash'. The shorter one immediately whirled towards the sound, back facing the girl completely. She graciously welcomed the opportunity with a stunner to the back, no one would notice the jet of red flying across the air anyway, not with the ongoing commotion on the street. The girl when back downstairs to the doorstep, stowing away the stunned wizard's wand and placing said wizard in a full-body bind. She took a moment to look down the street to the previously busy intersection and regard her handiwork. Speeding Muggles did come in useful in this case. The taller wizard lay on the middle of the intersection, bent and broken with a gruesome white bone protruding out from his side, a pool of blood already forming, lying a few feet away from a car sporting a bend bonnet. A small crowd had formed, with one man - probably the unfortunate third party - yapping away in clear confusion and panic. In the dead wizard's hand was a doorknob, by the time people may have taken notice of that, the transfiguration would have worn off to its less suspicious original form, the local Magical Law Enforcement team probably wouldn't be checking an apple for traces of magic, if they ever came to investigate.</p><p> </p><p>Turing back to the stunned leftover, she levitated the body and had it following her obediently. She made her way to the back door with body in tow, moving to the back alley. There, an old Toyota pickup was already waiting, the teenage driver laid back in his seat with an almost finished fag in his hand. With that ruffled brown hair, torn leather jacket and ripped jeans, he was begging to be looked upon as a punk and rebel. A grin graced his face as he caught sight of the girl, "Finally here Anya? You took your time. And who that charming companion of yours?"</p><p> </p><p>"This <em>charming companion</em> is the reason I <em>took my time</em> to begin with," the girl, Anya, replied with a scowl. "He and his partner managed to tail me across three portkey jumps, they aren't completely incompetent and they had to know about this."</p><p> </p><p>"Which is why you brought him for questioning," the boy nodded sagely. "More importantly, you got the dossier?"</p><p> </p><p>"Wouldn't be here if I didn't, two thousand galleons worth of blackmail in the bag. Now shut up and let me in, make sure the notice-me-not charms are good, because any Muggle law enforcement officer will ask for your driving license with one look at you."</p><p> </p><p align="center">

    <em>Thirteen years ago...</em>
  </strong>
</p><p> </p><p>Albus Dumbledore paced down the cobbled walkway, checking his pocket watch once again. Hagrid should be coming anytime soon. Stopping at a bridge, he gazed at the river beneath, letting his thoughts stray. Too many lives lost, too much innocent blood shed in this war, Harry Potter truly was a miracle in ending this war. No, he didn't end this war, he merely established a ceasefire. The war has yet to end, Voldemort is not gone and Harry will be instrumental in finally ending the war years down the road. Harry would have to go to his last living relatives, the Death Eaters still walk amongst the crowd and many seek the blood of the Boy-Who-Lived, the blood wards set in place by Lily's sacrifice will be the best protection for him. However, there was still another issue to resolve.</p><p> </p><p>The roar of a motorbike shook Dumbledore out of his thoughts, he look up at the sky and observed the motorbike's journey through the air and the half-giant steering it. The motorcycle landed on the bridge with a screeching halt in front of Dumbledore, the half-giant climbed out of the motorcycle and made his way over.</p><p> </p><p>"Hagrid," said Dumbledore, letting out a breath of relief. "At last. And where did you get that motorbike?"</p><p> </p><p>"Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir," the giant replied, shifting the bundle of blankets gently from one arm to another. "Young Sirius Black lent it me, I've got them, sir."</p><p> </p><p>"No problems, were there?"</p><p> </p><p>"No, sir - house was almost destroyed but I got them both out all right before the Muggles started swarmin' around. They fell asleep as we was flyin' over Bristol. Blimey Professor, I didn't even know James an' Lily had a daughter."</p><p> </p><p>Dumbledore bent forward over the bundle of blankets. Inside, just visible, was a pair of babies, a boy and a girl, both fast asleep.</p><p> </p><p>"Yes, this would be Anne Potter, Harry's little twin sister. James and Lily kept her a secret," said Dumbledore, inspecting the twins. "And this wound...?"</p><p> </p><p>"Aye, sir. Sirius Black patched up her eye before giving 'er to me, seemed like You-Know-Who did it before turning on Harry. Will she be alright, sir?"</p><p> </p><p>The lightning bolt shaped cut on the boy's forehead was likely the handiwork of Voldemort. The girl too had a cut, this one running down her right eye, that eye will never see the light of day again.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>She no longer has her right eye, now she a liability. Harry can't be allowed to be with her.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>"I don't know myself, Hagrid. Voldemort seemed to have cursed it," replied Dumbledore, continuing as he took the twins off Hagrid's arm. "I will try my best where Sirius left off, but I can make no promises."</p><p> </p><p>"Could I - could I say goodbye to both of them, sir?" asked Hagrid.</p><p> </p><p>"Very well, Hagrid. A short one please. Minerva is waiting at the Dursleys' for me, best that I don't tarry."</p><p> </p><p>Hagrid bent over and gave the twins each a kiss on the before taking out his large spotted handkerchief, sobbing loudly onto it.</p><p> </p><p>"C-c-can't believe it, Lily dead, James dead, an' their children off ter live with Muggles...tha' with little Anne still injured," sobbed Hagrid, moving back to the motorbike. "I'd best get this bike away, sir. G'night, Professor Dumbledore, sir."</p><p> </p><p>Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung himself on to the motorbike and kicked the engine to life; with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night.</p><p> </p><p>Dumbledore was left to his own thoughts, he shook his head gently and calmly regarded the twins that lay on his arms. Harry would go to the Dursleys', that was the best for him. Anne was the issue, she no longer had her asset against Voldemort, Tom saw to that himself.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>The girl lies in the dark, hands stained crimson. Her right eye a gift to endanger the Dark Lord...</em>
</p><p> </p><p>She could not be left with Harry too, she would only lead him astray in the future. If she still had her right eye, it could have been worth it to let the two grow up together. To have each other to rely on. But now, she was no longer gifted to fight against Voldemort, only Harry was. All she would do now is lead Harry to the dark in the future were she to stay with Harry, and the boy cannot afford to turn to the dark, not when he has to face Voldemort.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>And should the twins be together, the heart of light will embrace the dark while the child of dark remains in the shadows...</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Dumbledore stared at the girl, his sharp blue eyes peering into her peaceful demeanour, searching for an answer. He could leave her to another family, but magical or Muggle, she will still come back on the eleventh of September when the Hogwarts letter reaches her. There she will still come into contact with Harry, he could try to keep them apart, but there would be no guarantees.</p><p> </p><p>Unless...</p><p> </p><p>Dumbledore placed Anne down onto a nearby bench, drawing out his wand. He levelled it against her, an incantation almost that the tip of his tongue. Drawing a deep breath, his shoulders seem to sag under the responsibility of the act he was about to commit. At the last moment, he jerked his wand arm back, head sagging down, he let out a breath he did not know he was holding. No, he would not stoop to Voldemort's level.</p><p> </p><p>But this was for the war effort against Voldemort in the future, he could not allow for any mistakes. He steeled himself once more and gazed upon at the girl with an electrifying fire in his eyes. Yes, this had to be done, Harry cannot be afforded to be held back against Voldemort, this had to be done. It is for the greater good.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Greater good, Albus?</em>
</p><p> </p><p>A voice, gruff and familiar, rang through his head.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>You always drone on and on about the greater good don't you? You and Grindelwald.</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>And because of this greater good, we lost Ariana. I lost Ariana.</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Which poor little girl is going to die because of your greater good this time, Albus?</em>
</p><p> </p><p>The steely look on his face snapped and that electrifying fire in his eyes disappeared, doused by a cold swooping sensation in his chest. His shoulders sagged once more, this time shaking. Raising a sleeve to his face, he wiped the two trails of tears gently rolling down his cheeks.</p><p> </p><p>"Ariana, I'm so sorry. Merlin, I didn't mean to..."</p><p> </p><p>He stepped forward and leaned over to the small bundle that was Anne Potter. "Anne, I'm so sorry... so sorry..." he croaked.” Please forgive me..."</p><p> </p><p>He waved his wand over the girl's face and the bleeding from the right eye stopped entirely. Stepping back with Harry in his arms, he turned around and left the bundle on the wooden bench. With one last glace at the girl, with trembling lips and teary eyes, Albus Dumbledore bid Anne Potter his final farewell. "I'm sorry Anne, this is for your brother. I hope you can forgive me."</p><p> </p><p>Looking away from the bench and straight ahead, Dumbledore kept his head locked forward, as though another look at the girl would break his resolve. With a spin, he apparated into the night, leaving the girl behind.</p><p> </p><p align="center">

</p><p> </p><p>An old Toyota pickup stopped in front of a dumpy apartment flat, Anya stepped out and looked. The building was old and dingy, its purple coat of paint peeling off and faded into a dull grey. Despite the sky darkening under the setting sun, only a few windows had signs of light and life creeping out.</p><p> </p><p>"Ominous, no?" she said to herself sardonically, before turning back to the pickup. "Oi, Dimitri. Get the man out and let go, it's getting cold."</p><p> </p><p>No response. "<em>Dvigat'sya uzhe</em>," she sighed, chucking a nearby pebble at the pickup.</p><p> </p><p>"<em>Khorosho ya idu</em>," replied the teenager, Dimitri, scowling at the offending pebble. He held his wand like a baton, levitating an unconscious and bound man in tow. "<em>Ne nuzhno brosat' kamni, mne tozhe ne nravitsya etot kholod.</em>"</p><p> </p><p>The pair walked up to the apartment flat, climbing up the flight of stairs and stopping at the third floor. A walk down the hallway ended with a drab concrete wall in sight. Dimitri dug his hand into his jeans pocket and produced a key, shoving it into the wall, the key seemed to sink into the wall with ease. A twist and an audible click of a doorlock opening was heard, pushing the wall revealed a doorway to an apartment room, furnished with basic wooden tables and chairs. A mouldy sofa sat in a corner and the wallpaper seemed not to different from the building's paintwork.</p><p> </p><p>They were promptly greeted by a wiry Asian, dressed in a jumper and slacks similar to Anya, looking just as young as the pair. His dark eyes narrowed in suspicion, flickering back and forth between the pair and settling on the floating unconscious form behind the pair. Finally, he turned to Dimitri and asked in anticipation, "你就是谁呢？"</p><p> </p><p>"Wei Jen, I don't speak Mandarin and we both know that," replied Dimitri evenly. "We've got the dossier and a prisoner for interrogation."</p><p> </p><p>"Well said, Dim, come in" the Asian replied with a slight accent, smiling warmly whilst moving aside to get them room to enter. His smile then slipped into a mocking grin. "Four years of the old man nagging and you still can't get the hang of Mandarin."</p><p> </p><p>“Jen. Good to see you.”</p><p> </p><p>“Same here, Anya.”</p><p> </p><p>"Not my fault languages aren't my forte," Dimitri shrugged nonchalantly, ignoring the mocking nickname. "I suck in Mandarin and you suck in Russian, the feeling is mutual. You don't hear me mocking you when the old man scolds you for not learning Russian properly."</p><p> </p><p>"And then we have Anya," stated the Asian – Jen – brightly, facing the girl and shaking hands. "The old man's best linguistic student; English, Russian, Mandarin and Tamil, all under your belt."</p><p> </p><p>"Spare me the flattery or I'll hex you," replied Anya fondly, a small grin betraying her face of mock sternness. "It's all required for the job."</p><p> </p><p>Jen closed the door behind them and moved over to inspect the unconscious body, drawing out his wand and prodding it in various places. With a sweeping wave of the wand, the unconscious man's clothes were jerked off roughly, revealing a tattooed panther across the man's chest.</p><p> </p><p>"Ang San Cartel," Jen mumbled, running his hand down from his sharp jawline to his chin. He then turned around, beginning to search through the clothes for any clues. "Well, I'm honestly surprised they're intervening in this blackmail operation, I thought their operating branches only spanned the Southeast, furthest being the Bangladeshi branch."</p><p> </p><p>"Maybe it has to do with us assassinating said Bangladeshi branch leader," offered Dimitri. "Old man didn't seem fond them to begin with, eye for an eye for an eye?"</p><p> </p><p>"Heh, maybe," chuckled Jen, he suddenly tilted his and screwed his face up in concentration before snapping his fingers in realisation. "就提醒了我! Anya, the old man asked me to pass you a message."</p><p> </p><p>He strode over to a dining table pickup an envelope and passing it to a perplexed Anya, who tore the envelope open.</p><p> </p><p>"A plane ticket back to Russia for tomorrow, what does old man Nathaniel want we me now? We just got the blackmail dossier done."</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>"Dim and I will handle the dossier and the interrogation. He said that all will be explained back at Arkhangelsk, mentioned something about Gringotts and Hogwarts."</p>
