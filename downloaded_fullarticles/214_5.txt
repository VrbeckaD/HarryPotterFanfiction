    <p>The first time he met the enigma that was Harry Potter long before he met Rose.</p><p>The TARDIS had been weepy all morning and the Doctor had been quite flummoxed. He'd been even more so when the TARDIS had dropped him near a little house in Godric's Hollow and quite quickly spat him out into the garden.</p><p>"OI!" He turned on a dime put his fists on his hips. "Open up! Where the hell up. Where the bloody hell do you think you dropped me?"</p><p>"Well I think you've been dropped in my front garden, sir." Was the soft laugh that sounded behind him?</p><p>Well the doctor spun found with his goofy grin. "Saw that di you? Fair to say the missus wasn't feeling too well."</p><p>The woman laughed, leaning against the doorframe of her home. She didn't looked perturbed by the man having turned up in a blue box in her garden. In fact she looked like her old friend had just done something endearing. "It seems the TARDIS is feeling quite ill indeed. Why don't you come in, Doctor? I just put the kettle on, and I don't think your blue box will let you in until you've had a sit down."</p><p>For a moment the Doctor looked at the young woman with suspicion, he followed her into her home still, but his eyes were narrowed. "Know me then do you? Can't say I remember you, miss. I think I might too, I love gingers, want to be ginger meself."</p><p>The lady laughed as they entered the kitchen, and the Doctor say an equally odd scene. There was a young man at the kitchen table, in one arm was a young baby, barely six months old, and in the other was a wand which was swishing around. He was making the tea, cleaning the dishes, and folding laundry it seemed.</p><p>"Ah, Doctor. Went and changed your face again I see." The man smiled with a cheeky grin. "Well I like this face much more than the last, though you look real grungy old boy."</p><p>The doctor blinked. "That's me, an old scruff. But it seems I'm missing the point for once. Have we met?"</p><p>The man laughed again, but in a humorous way. "We have, though you had a different face a couple of times. You met my wife first when she was little, and then me later." He smiled pleasantly and held out his hand. "I'm James Potter, and I met your fourth regeneration, and your sixth, and your thirteenth regeneration. In face I've met this face too,"</p><p>And the woman walked in, plucked the child from James' arms and smiled. "And I'm Lilly Potterâ€¦.though you met me in your seventh regeneration when I was Evans."</p><p>And then the doctor's eyes widened. "Little Evan!"</p><p>And with those words Lily pouted, her brows creasing severely. "You're as bad and James and his friends! My name is Lily you prick."</p><p>And with that the couple dissolved in laughter. Yes the Doctor did remember now. He remembered stumbling in on Sirius and James trying to wrestle Remus into fitted dress robes. He remembered young Lily in her back garden talking to snakes in secret.</p><p>"So now that I remember your ugly mugs, who's the little prince? Didn't know you two would get together. Last I saw you hated each other. Rather like those cat and mice cartoons you used watch on the telly, Lils."</p><p>The red-headed woman, barely twenty one huffed, but smiled at her old companion. "If you must know, this one here and his friends grew up, and are pleasant company."</p><p>James just laughed and stood, he took his son from Lily before putting the child in the Doctor's arms. Thought James had only met a version of the Doctor for the first time when he was fourteen, the times he had spent talking with the strange man were precious and numerous enough that James's trust in the Doctor could rival Sirius and Remus' if the man was around enough.</p><p>"This is Harry James Potter, my first born, and heir to too many noble and ancient houses."</p><p>As it was, the Doctor help the pudgy baby who smiled at him and babbled. The doctor knew, as he held the baby, that this child would indeed be special.</p><p>"Well then. Harry James Potter, it is a pleasure to meet you. I am the Doctor and you little pudding, sre going to cause so much chaos."</p><p>Lily sighed before snatching her child out of the Doctor's arms, she frowned but her voice was full of amusement and love of family when she spoke. "Don't you start too! James and Sirius are already determine to make my son another marauder!"</p><p>"Well he will be won't he!" The Doctor laughed. "Not only is he a Potter, but he's your son too Evans, and you were a little monster before heading to Hogwarts. Only calmed down then because you knew you'd get away with more by blaming it on James."</p><p>"Lils! Is this true?"</p><p>"DOCTOR! You promised me not to say anything."</p><p>Somehow Harry ended up back in the Doctor's arms, and James and Lily chased each other round the kitchen and living room. Laughter permeated the house and the Doctor, as always felt at home with these humans.</p><p>"Well regardless, you are fantastic you are. A marauder or not, you Harry James Potter will be a star."</p>
