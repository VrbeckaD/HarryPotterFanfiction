    <p>The first time they kiss was a complete accident. Draco and Harry had decided to spend some time flying around the Quidditch Pitch, trying to determine who the best Seeker was. As they were returning Eighth years they were not allowed to play on the house teams. It was considered to be an advantage as they were older than the others players. </p><p>Draco was already in the air flying around when Harry walked onto the pitch, his firebolt under his right arm and a golden snitch in his left hand. When he saw Draco he smiled up at him, and Draco couldn’t help the smile that spread across his face in response. As Draco watched Harry mount his broom and kick off into the air, flying a few laps of the pitch as a warm up, he thought about how much things had changed. He and Harry used to be enemies, but now they were friends. Actual friends. They studied together, hung out in the Eighth year common room, played chess, and sometimes even talked about personal problems when they were feeling down. </p><p>Once Harry had finished his warm up laps he flew over to Draco and hovered next to him in the air.<br/>
“Right”, Harry said. “The rules are as follows. We let the snitch go while we both have our eyes shut, then after 10 seconds we open our eyes and start searching for the snitch. The one who catches the snitch first is the best seeker.”<br/>
“You’re on Potter. We both know that I am the best seeker here”<br/>
“You wish Malfoy”, Harry retorted. “Alright then, shut your eyes and I’m letting the snitch go.”<br/>
Both boys closed their eyes as Harry released the snitch. “10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, GO!!!” </p><p>Both boys shot off around the pitch in search of the snitch, and for the next hour neither of them caught sight of it. Then Draco looked towards the goal hoops at the left end of the pitch and noticed a tiny glint of gold near the base of the hoops. He speed up in pursuit of the snitch but was so focused on what he was chasing that he didn’t notice Harry speeding towards it from another direction. </p><p>Just as Draco reached out his hand to grab the snitch Harry crashed into him from the side and they both fell the final meter to the ground. Draco landed on the ground and Harry fell on top of him, but with the impact of the crash Harry’s lips brushed against Draco in a chaste kiss. </p><p>Draco felt Harry quickly roll off of him and move away as he started to stammer out an apology.<br/>
“I – I- I’m so sorry Malfoy, I - It was an accident I didn’t mean to kiss you I promise. Please don’t hit me.”<br/>
“Potter relax, it was an accident. I’m not going to hit you. However, I did just win the title of best seeker!” Draco said, with a big smirk on his face.<br/>
“WHAT!” Harry exclaimed. “You did not catch the snitch!”<br/>
“Actually I did”, Draco helped up his hand to reveal the snitch clenched tightly in his fist and his most award winning smirk in place on his face. </p><p>“Damn. I can’t believe you caught that. I guess you are the best seeker then. Anyway come on; let’s get back to the castle. I’m starving and it’s just about time for dinner.” Harry said.<br/>
They both got up off the ground and grabbed their brooms before making the trek up the hill back to the castle, laughing and joking the whole way as though nothing awkward had happened.</p>
