    <p>At 5:55 am exactly, Draco’s wand buzzed.  He silenced it, and lay, perfectly still, waiting the requisite one minute before he was allowed to get up.  Counting the sixty seconds off in his head, he heard Lara’s voice there too, gentle and encouraging, “And, Draco, I’m curious about what would happen if you <em>didn’t</em> count the sixty seconds.  Do you think you could challenge yourself to simply wait for about as long as a minute or two <em>without</em> checking the time?”  Draco wanted to challenge himself, but his mind was caught in the familiar, comforting cadence of the count, and when he hit sixty, his feet were on the floor whether he had bid them there or not.  Lara’s voice reassured him, “Recognizing the pattern is nearly as good as breaking it.  It’s all progress, Draco, even if it isn’t linear.” Annoyed with himself anyway, he stomped to the bathroom, repeating Lara’s words back to himself with different inflections, making them sound as ridiculous as possible.</p><p>It didn’t take long for Draco to shower, dress, and brew a strong espresso, which he carried with him to the sunny room where his yoga mat had pride of place.  He sat crosslegged on the mat, and was about to set his wand to count down the ten minutes, when he stopped.  Feeling a little shaky, he set his wand down, and started to breathe.  He was midway through his twentieth exhalation, when the anxiety became too much.  Opening his eyes, he set his wand for nine minutes, twenty seconds, and resumed his practice.  When the wand buzzed again, he summoned his journal, and noted the occurrence.  It wasn’t success, but it was an attempt, and it would give him something to discuss with Lara on Wednesday anyway.</p><p>Eight o’clock found Draco in his lab, pot of tea set with a warming charm, and some classical music from WWN2 gently playing in the background.  He cast a scouring charm on his worktable and lifted his quill, his diary open to today’s page before stifling a groan.  It was innoculation day, which meant that, in merely four hours, his sanctum would be invaded by Aurors.  He’d spelled the appointments into his diary from the parchment that the Ministry had sent over last week, and he scanned the names.  Pritchard, Jones, Richmond, Weasley, and Potter.  He allowed himself the luxury of three breaths, then repeated Lara’s words to himself, “The threats are manufactured, and my caution is an asset.”</p><p>Sighing, Draco calculated that he’d be able to complete the Imperius vaccination as well as a blood-thickening potion both before the Auror parade began.  Just to be safe, though, (<em>safe</em>, his mind echoed), he cast a set of extra wards on his lab, his floo, the chair that the Aurors would use.  Straightening his shoulders, he got to work.  When his floo chimed with the first Auror, Draco was just finishing the cleaning process from the blood-thickening potion.  He waved his wand, opening the floo, and said, “Good afternoon, Auror Pritchard, please use some of the hand-sanitizing potion and have a seat in the chair.  I’ll be with you in a moment.”  He hadn’t completed the cleaning spell exactly correctly, so he did it again.  And once more, to be sure.</p><p>He summoned a vial of the innoculation, and a sanitizing wipe before donning a set of Muggle rubber gloves and approaching the chair.  Auror Pritchard was sitting comfortably, looking around his lab with interest.  “Mister Malfoy, you have an incredible setup here.”  She was an older witch, around fifty-five, Draco guessed, and she’d been one of Draco’s biggest combatants when he’d first started consulting to the Aurors.  She was Muggleborn, Draco knew, and had lost a family member during the war.  Old wounds remained deep in the years following, and she’d been vocal in her disapproval of an ex-Death Eater interacting with the Aurors.  Still, Draco had been one of only four Potions Master in Europe, and the remaining Death Eaters that were still at large after the war had access to Snape’s formulas.  They’d needed a great deal of help in counteracting the potions during their many attempts to round up all the remaining baddies, and, after Draco had been able to cure the effects of a bone-liquifying potion that had been threatening her partner, she’d quickly changed her tune.  Since then, she’d been collegial, but Draco remembered everything she’d said before.</p><p>Still.  Draco knew that he was one of the few consultants that was allowed to work exclusively from his home, and he’d been working so hard, since the war to be the bigger person, to offset what he and his family had done, he swallowed any sarcasm, and simply said, “Thank you.”  His hands were on the arm of the chair.  Tap, tap, tap.</p><p>“It’s wonderful that you’ve been able to develop this potion.  To think, you’ve managed to eliminate one of the Unforgiveables!”</p><p>“Well, not eliminate,” he said, ill-at-ease, “but this does help you to resist it.  I’m glad that it does.”</p><p>“Mister Malfoy, I wanted to apologize to you.  For…well…I wasn’t very kind to you when you first started working with the DMLE.  And I regret that.”</p><p>“Yes,” Draco said, hoping that something enormous would fall on the house and kill him dead so that he wouldn’t have this conversation.  “Well.”</p><p>“Anyways,” Auror Pritchard said, “I just wanted you to know.  Am I finished?”</p><p>“Yes,” Draco said weakly.  “And, thank you?”  He didn’t mean for it to come out like a question, but he wasn’t sure how to take back the way his inflection rose, and so, with some additional awkwardness, Pritchard bundled herself off through the floo, and Draco busied himself with cleaning all the surfaces she’d touched.  The next several Aurors came and went without any declarations of shame at their earlier treatment, and Draco had nearly begun to hope that his day would pass without any further awkwardness.</p><p>Then the floo chimed again, and Weasley stepped out, followed by Potter, who stumbled over the hearth and just barely missed cracking his head on the marble counter.  “Malfoy,” he said,  attempting to sound professional, his face going red.</p><p>“Potter, Weasley,” Draco replied.  He directed Weasley to the chair, and began to prepare to administer the vaccination onto Weasley’s freckled neck when he caught a flash of crimson robes out of the corner of his eye.  “Don’t touch that,” he said sharply, and Potter yanked his hand back so quickly that he stumbled backward into a rack of vials that were cooling.  The rack fell to the ground with an almighty clatter, and a series of brightly coloured vials hit the floor.  Most of them had already been spelled unbreakable, but the blood thickening potion, which was still cooling, and an earlier batch of inflammation reducer that had to cure under the a full moon, hadn’t.  Draco watched, his thoughts detached, as the vials shattered, and the potion spattered all over Potter.</p><p>“Oh,” Draco said sadly, thinking about the time he’d invested in the inflammation reducer, and the amount of cleaning that would be required to set his lab to rights.  He spared a moment to consider berating Potter for his clumsiness, but, immediately rejecting the notion as not worth it, took a step towards the mess, and summoned his wand from its wrist holster.  </p><p>“Malfoy, I’m so sorry,” Potter gasped helplessly, as potion dripped down the front of his robes.</p><p>“It’s fine,” Draco replied curtly.  “You should remove your outer robes.  Did any of the potion touch your skin?”</p><p>“I’m not sure,” Potter said, shrugging off the robes, and looking down.  His legs were liberally coated.</p><p>“Come,” Draco said.  “I have a decontamination shower.  You’ll need to get the remnants washed off right away.  I have a spare set of clothing you can have.”</p><p>“Is it dangerous?” Weasley asked, the first thing he’d said since arriving. “What’s on Harry, anyway?” </p><p>“I’m sure it’s fine,” Potter said.  “I’m sorry to be a bother.”</p><p>“It should be no problem, but I’ve never tested the combination of these two potions.  They’re both harmless on their own, but one can never be sure how one potion will interact with another.”</p><p>He shooed Potter into the decontamination shower, adding another thing on his growing list of things that would need to be completely sanitized, and climbed the stairs to his quarters to find something for Potter to put on.  Potter had filled out in the four years since the war ended, and Draco had remained weedy, so the best he could do was a fairly ragged pair of jogging pants and a threadbare Kestrals t-shirt.  Draco had kept them after Paul had moved out a year ago, when he’d gotten tired of Draco’s shit, and could no longer put up with him.  He sometimes took them out to look at them, to remember a time when he was different, but he never wore them.  Draco tried, and failed, to picture the exact lines of Paul’s face.  He’d been tall, broad, Draco remembered, and had crinkles at the edges of his eyes when he’d smiled, but Draco couldn’t remember the plane of his jaw, no matter how hard he tried.  It was disconcerting, Draco realized, and told himself that he’d put it in his journal to tell Lara.  His hands on the wardrobe.  Tap, tap, tap.  His thoughts were interrupted, however, by Weasley’s voice screaming, “Malfoy,” in a tone of such panic that Draco fled back down to his lab with considerable speed.</p><p>“What is it?” His voice was sharp, but in his defence, his heart was pounding, and he’d whacked his elbow, hard, against the doorframe as he’d flown around the corner.</p><p>“What is it?” Weasley’s voice was, if possible, even more panic-stricken, and he was pointing a shaky finger at the floor of the shower room, where, sitting, bemused, on a fluffy towel was a baby.</p><p>“Oh,” Draco said in surprise.  “Where did that come from?”</p><p>“It’s Harry, you dumb fuck!”</p><p>“Is it really?” Draco asked, his brain short-circuiting as he tried to connect the plump infant with the strapping Auror who had just destroyed his lab.</p><p>“Fix him!” Weasley demanded.</p><p>“Fix him?  I didn’t do this,” Draco protested.</p><p>“It’s obviously whatever fell on him.  What are you up to, Malfoy?”</p><p>Draco felt a long-forgotten sense of indignation at being unjustly accused.  “I’m not up to anything, Weasley.  If you recall, <em>Potter</em> was the one who tried to smash my lab to bits.  Like usual, I’m going to get blamed for something that <em>he</em> did.”</p><p>“You won’t get blamed if you fix him,” Weasley said lowly.</p><p>“How in Merlin’s name am I to fix him?”</p><p>“They’re your potions, Malfoy.  Surely you have an antidote.”</p><p>“I don’t even know where to begin.  Those two potions couldn’t possibly have de-aged him in this way.  He needs to go to St. Mungo’s, Weasley.  They’ll sort him out.  I’m happy to provide my formulas, and any potion residue that remains.”</p><p>“We can’t take him to St. Mungo’s.”  The mulish set to Weasley’s jaw was beginning to set Draco’s nerves on edge.</p><p>“Why not?”</p><p>“I just can’t.”</p><p>“Well, I’m not dealing with this, Weasley.  Good luck.  Don’t forget to pick him up some nappies on your way to Mungo’s, lest he wee all over you.”</p><p>“Ugh, Malfoy, can’t you possibly avoid being a prick for even just a minute?  And you,” Weasley rounded on the baby, “why do you <em>always</em> get me dragged into these situations?  I just want a quiet life!”</p><p>“You picked a terrible best friend for that,” Draco remarked.  He was feeling more like himself than he had in years.  Who knew that it took the return of two-thirds of the Golden Trio to keep his mind off his problems.</p><p>“Tell me about it,” Weasley moaned.</p>
