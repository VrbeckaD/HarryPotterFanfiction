</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>I wander into my little flat. Open and crash on my bed, too tired to undress. My magic aches to be released, but without my wing the door and letting light fill the room. It’s late, and I’m so so tired. I drag my feet on the tileand, I haven’t been able too. I have no idea what would happen if I tried to use wandless magic. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Ironic isn’t it? The one who was born into magic would be the one to lose it…</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>I want to sleep, I really do, yet my eyes refuse to close, just as they have for the past few years. I can’t remember the last time I slept peacefully. The last time my sleep wasn’t plagued with nightmares and dark dark memories. I can’t even remember the last time I got a full night of sleep. Last year maybe? When did the war even end? </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>I can’t remember anymore. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>I only recall the pain, glares, and the curses. The screams and confused expressions. The sound of my </span>
  <em>
    <span>obliviate </span>
  </em>
  <span>ringing in the cold tunnel. The insane laughter of my aunt, and the blood. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>So so much blood, spots on the floor of the halls I used to run around in, splattered on the walls of what used to be my sanctuary, flowing out of my own body. I remember the pain, the tears, and, and…</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Something else…</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Someone </span>
  </em>
  <span>else…</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Someone with bright green eyes… </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Someone who was once my mantra, and now I cannot even bring myself to think his given name.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The one who ended the Dark Lord. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The one who both saved and cursed me. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Cursed me to this life. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>My heart aches. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>I must stop. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>I turn my head toward the window. The senses around me slowly fade back in. The pitter-patter of the raindrops. The scent of mint and lavender from the mist gadget that Mimi gave me a while back,</span>
  <em>
    <span> was it a month or a week ago?</span>
  </em>
  <span> The feel of my covers that are bunched around me. And the light of the digital clock Mimi had taught me how to use. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>5:08 am</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>An hour before I should normally get up. I should sleep, or at least rest for a bit. But I get up, almost like a soulless husk. I have no purpose, I have no passion. None left… </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Everything is faded, so close yet feeling like it's so far, a galaxy away. Right in front of me, but out of my grasp. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>I stare at the mirror. My hair has long lost its shine. Although it is still white blond, it hangs limply and gives off a ‘grey’ vibe. I’m nearly skin and bones, I find no pleasure in food anymore, and I only eat occasionally to keep Mimi off my back. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>My clothes hang off my frame, and my eye bags are the most color my entire being has.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>I sigh and trudge out of my apartment, the sun not even peeking out yet and the moon winking at me as I walk slowly down the streets, in a daze. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>I blink as I reach my destination. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>

</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The quaint little bookstore where I work, it’s my second home. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>I work day in and day out. All day every day. I don’t take breaks, not unless Mimi, the book store owner’s niece who works on the weekdays, pushes me out. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>She worries over me, her and her aunt, Miss. Daia. Some of the regulars worry over me as well, making small talk and occasionally baked goods that I can never taste.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>I suppose that is the only light left in my life, after all, when you realize your mere existence is only to be used by those who ruined your meaning because they want you to save the people who hate your guts and want you dead-</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Where was I even going with this again? </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>I can’t recall…</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>I have a problem with that, always skipping around. Whether it be my thoughts, my conversations, or my approach at life… </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Harry used to hate when I would do that. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Harry…</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Light of my past life...</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The one who used to be the only hope in my life...</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Where even is Harry?</span>
