    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p>For the past three years, the first of September was celebrated by our marauders in many ways for the lack of parental supervision. In the first year, they set dung bombs off on the train, spilt pumpkin juice all over Hestia Jones's new robes, and "got lost" on the way to their dormitory ending up in the teacher's lounge stealing Professor Slughorn's liquorice wands and treacle tarts.</p>
<p>In the second year, they (James) took the sorting hat while Professor McGonagall was introducing herself to the first years (it took them an hour to find it sitting atop a Gargoyle's head.)</p>
<p>In the third year, they (with the help of Peeves the Poltergeist) bombarded Severus Snape with water balloons and then later took James to the hospital wing after Lily Evans "accidentally" tripped into him and forced him onto his plate of hot, greasy sausages. This year they planned to do something different, something that involved the staff, namely their Headmaster.</p>
<p>They had been discussing it for the entire train ride. Professor Dumbledore would stand up, welcoming the first years to Hogwarts, announce that Mr Filch had gone into retirement (one can dream,) probably make some remark about Voldemort and his Death Eaters officially existing as of this summer (via the Daily Prophet) and how they are perfectly safe at Hogwarts all the while the curtains behind him would be performing their interpretive dance. They practised the charm many times on their new dress robes (thankfully they didn't burst into flames) and found pleasing results.</p>
<p>They were ready. They rode up to the castle in their carriage wearing masks of boredom because they were assigned to sit with Alice Prewet, a prefect. (Sirius and James may or may not have made some questionable remarks about her and Frank's relationship in reference to their game of truth or dare in the previous year during the entire ride up to the castle.) They made their way to the Great Hall, waving to people they didn't see on the train.</p>
<p>"Oi, Evans!" James shouted, spotting Lily about to walk through the doors unusually not surrounded by her friends. Lily spun around searching through the sea of people with a look of anticipation on her face. Upon seeing James her face fell.</p>
<p>"Not now, Potter," Lily said tightly.</p>
<p>"What's wrong? Did Snivellus decide not to show up this year?" James laughed, nudging Sirius with his elbow.</p>
<p>"We're not that lucky," Sirius grinned.</p>
<p>"He's here, thankfully," Lily said bitterly, narrowing her eyes at the pair.</p>
<p>"So that's what it is? Finally saw what a slimy git he is?" James asked.</p>
<p>"Oh, just bugger off!" Lily spun on her heels, whipping her hair out behind her and strode into the Hall. James sent Sirius a questioning look. Sirius shrugged and they swaggered in to find Remus and Peter laughing with Frank Longbottom.</p>
<p>The Great Hall looked as it usually did. Hundreds of floating candles lit the room, the enchanted ceiling reflected the starry night sky, the house emblems hung above the appropriate table, and up ahead sat an empty stool with a raggedy old hat on top. Behind that was the staff table with Professor Slughorn whispering merrily with a young frumpy witch none of them recognised. Professor Kettleburn (the Care of Magical Creatures professor) messaged the stub that was his left arm while listening to Professor Vector, the Arithmancy professor. There was another wizard they did not recognise, he was tall and broad-shouldered and he smiled jovially as he took in the sea of students before him. Two new teachers and Professor Dumbledore were missing from the staff table. As they turned to point this out to their housemates they found that that was what everyone was talking about.</p>
<p>"Perhaps he's helping the ministry sort out their Death Eater problem," Bertha Jorkins said smartly.</p>
<p>"Does that mean he's not coming back?" asked a second year, who looked rather frightened by the thought.</p>
<p>"Maybe he's just fallen asleep in his office," Lily comforted.</p>
<p>"Or he's ill and had to be sent to St. Mungo's," Bertha continued. This set everyone talking at once. Lily groaned and rolled her eyes in exasperation. Mary McDonald placed a comforting hand on her shoulder and Josie Archer took Bertha's hand to walk her down the table to where the older kids sat so she couldn't cause any more chaos. James, Sirius, Remus, and Peter listened to the panicked conversation. There were many different theories, all as ridiculous as the ones Bertha had started.</p>
<p>"It does make sense for Dumbledore to help the ministry with the Death Eaters," Sirius remarked.</p>
<p>"He wouldn't leave the school, though. He likes being Headmaster too much," Remus said.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall walked through the doors leading the first years who looked amazed at the scene around them. The Hall fell quiet. All eyes were glued to McGonagall hoping that she would explain Dumbledore's absence before the sorting.</p>
<p>The sorting hat came to life and started its song. After which they applauded politely, more focused on McGonagall to really appreciate the hat's poetic lyrics. The hat bowed to the four tables and became very still again. Professor McGonagall stepped in front of the first years, holding a long roll of parchment with their names written on it.</p>
<p>"When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted," she said. Before she had time to call out the first name the Great Hall burst into hurried whispers again. Finally, the teachers looked at their students with concern. This was not how the sortings usually went. McGonagall stepped up to the staff table and wrapped her wand against it, silencing the whispers. "The elder students are expected to remain quiet while the first years are being sorted," she reminded them.</p>
<p>"But Professor!" James stood and all eyes fell on him.</p>
<p>"Potter, sit down," McGonagall ordered, firmly.</p>
<p>"Yes, but Professor, what happened to Dumbledore?"</p>
<p>"Announcements will be made after the sorting ceremony. Now sit down or you will be removed," McGonagall warned and James sat. The four of them exchanged curious expressions and ignored the rest of the ceremony. They fidgeted with their silverware while Peter checked his map under the table pretending to be picking up a fallen napkin. It only confirmed that Dumbledore was not on the grounds. Once the ceremony had ended they had gained 10 new Gryffindors. McGonagall instead of returning to her seat, stood in front of the Hall waiting for silence to fall.</p>
<p>"I have a few announcements to make before the feast begins!" she called and gained the silence she was waiting for. "First Professor Sprout has decided to take an early retirement and gives his best to all his former students. Second I would like to welcome two new teachers. Professor Sprat will be teaching Herbology." The young, frumpy witch stood and gave a small bow to the applauding room. "And Professor Haas, teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts." Professor Haas stood, gave four quick waves to each of the tables his smile never wavering. "Third, as Mr Potter pointed out, our headmaster, Professor Dumbledore, is not currently with us. He would like me to assure you that he is fine and in perfect health and will be back at Hogwarts in no time at all. He would also like me to pass on his sincere apology to the first years that he was not here to welcome you on your first day at Hogwarts.</p>
<p>"And finally, I'm sure you all have been wondering why dress robes have been added to your supply list this year. Your professors have decided that this year we will be hosting a ball." With that, the Great Hall erupted into excited squeals and whispers. McGonagall waited a moment before tapping her wand against the table again. "It is called the Alum Ball. Professor Slughorn has graciously offered to take charge of the event. He has requested some volunteers to help plan and set up. You can speak with him later if you are interested." Professor Slughorn smiled proudly at his students, looking as if he had given them a great treat. James, Sirius, Remus, and Peter, however, felt nothing but dread for this announcement. "That is all, thank you for your patients and let the feast begin!" McGonagall clapped her hands twice and their plates filled with the usual delicious foods.</p>
<p>With the assurance that Dumbledore was fine and their attentions otherwise engaged the students relaxed and talk of the upcoming ball and not much else. Marlene McKinnon told Alice Prewett that she hopes that Annie Trevisani from Hufflepuff would ask her to the ball. Dirk Cresswell was asking Frank's advice on how to ask Cassie Rosier to be his date. Christopher Hemsley (Frank's dorm mate) already asked Amelia Bones to go with him - she said no. Lily announced that she was now a vegetarian because she wanted to make sure she still fit into her dress once the ball came around. In response, James loaded his plate with roast beef, pork chops, and bacon while holding eye contact with her. Sirius laughed while he watched Hemsley try to ask Florence Brocklehurst without Amelia noticing - she did. Peter wondered out loud to Remus if Mary would agree to go with him. Remus encouraged him to try and he almost did but lost his nerve and asked her to pass the salt instead. James tried to tease Sirius into asking Cindy from Hufflepuff but after nearly burning her hair off during tutoring in the previous year he blatantly refused. They all knew that James was bound to ask Lily, but how and when had yet to be answered.</p>
<p>The ghost had even entered the conversations, encouraging students to ask someone to the ball and even floating across the hall delivering messages. The Fat Fryer had asked James if he wanted to go to the ball with Sally-Anne Perks. James announced that he would be decidedly sick that day. Sirius suggested that they make their way to their dormitory before the girls started really getting bold. So they left the Great Hall, asking Frank for the password on the way out.</p>
<p>"How are the Mandrakes, James?" Sirius asked, making sure the door was firmly shut behind him before he did. The Mandrake leaves proved harder than they thought they would be. Holding it in their mouth for a month was the easy part. Finding dew that had not been touched by sunlight, three chrysalis of a Death's- Head Hawk Moth, and three crystal phials was difficult, given their age especially. They were lucky that the night of the full moon was a clear one.</p>
<p>"They're perfect. I've been keeping them hidden in a pair of old socks," James smirked, biting off the head of a Chocolate Frog. "Have you been doing your incantations?" James asked hoping that neither of them forgot and cause them to have to start the entire process over again.</p>
<p>"Twice daily at Sunrise and Sunset," Sirius smiled.</p>
<p>"Amato Amino Animato Animagus," Peter chanted, proving to James that he hadn't forgotten.</p>
<p>"And you remembered to keep the tip of your wand on your heart?" James said seriously. He had been worried that Peter had forgotten this while he was home and he didn't want to mention it with his house full of ears. To his relief, Peter nodded dutifully.</p>
<p>"Good thing too. With such a dangerous transformation, I would hate for something to go amiss," Remus said, pointedly.</p>
<p>"Yes, it would be terrible if Peter had to spend the rest of his life as half a fish," James laughed. "And don't even think about stealing the leaves! Sirius charmed the heck out of my socks on the train while you weren't looking."</p>
<p>"I just said I didn't want anything to go wrong," Remus said innocently.</p>
<p>"You know, I don't really like that double heartbeat bit," Peter said, grimacing.</p>
<p>"Just imagine what it's going to be like when you actually turn into an animagus!" Remus told him, devilishly.</p>
<p>"Lupin!"</p>
<p>"Remus!"</p>
<p>James and Sirius looked at him furiously. Peter chewed his bottom lip and wrung his hands nervously.</p>
<p>"It's true!" Remus argued. "If your gonna do it, you should know what's going to happen. Read the book, Peter."</p>
<p>"Peter, the heart thing only happens the first time. We already told you that," James soothed, making Peter turn away from Remus.</p>
<p>"Yeah Pete, don't listen to Remus. He's just being a prat because he thinks it's too dangerous for us - that he's too dangerous," Sirius said, glaring at Remus. Remus sighed and took butterbeers from his trunk to pass around.</p>
<p>"Let's talk about something else. James, how are you going to ask Lily to the ball?" Remus asked, sitting on the floor in the middle of the room.</p>
<p>"I already told you, I'm going to be decidedly sick that day," James said, tossing his head into the air and dropped to the floor, crossing his legs.</p>
<p>"Yeah, right!" Sirius laughed.</p>
<p>"He's probably going to ask her every day 'till then," Peter smirked.</p>
<p>"You should probably do it quick. I heard Nick Graves from Ravenclaw saying that he wanted to ask her," Remus grinned.</p>
<p>"Oh, I've got a brilliant idea! Why don't we lightly poison the punch bowl and make everyone sick so the ball will be ruined and they will never try to do this again?" James said.</p>
<p>"I think you should at least give her flowers," Peter said.</p>
<p>"Yes! Dad always uses Orchideous whenever he wants to impress Mum," Remus offered.</p>
<p>"Or we could tell Professor Kettleburn that we've always wanted to learn about trolls. You know he'll bring one into class. And then on the night of the ball, we'll release it from wherever he's keeping it and guide it into the castle. It'll be hilarious!" James laughed.</p>
<p>"Maybe you should write her a poem. 'Roses are red, so is your hair. Please be my date, or it just won't be fair!'" Sirius said, and they collapsed into giggles.</p>
<p>"Please be my date, or it just won't be fair?! Sirius, I am never taking love advice from you," Remus laughed.</p>
<p>"The flowers were a good idea though," Sirius chuckled.</p>
<p>"That's enough you love sick, hopeless romantic, idiots," James laughed, but it sounded forced. "I'm going to bed. Good night." He stalked off to bed, smiled shortly at his friends, then waved his wand to turn out the lights leaving them in total darkness.</p>
<p>"I guess the ginger's a touchy subject," Peter whispered.</p>
<p>"We do keep teasing him about her," Remus whispered back.</p>
<p>"SHHHHH!" James shushed loudly.</p>
