  <strong>Forever in Emerald – Chapter 1 (Engraved Ink)</strong>
</p>
<p>Dean wasn't exactly sure what to expect when he first noticed the letters on his wrist. He had heard, of course, that most wizards and witches had a soul bond somewhere in the world.</p>
<p>But a lot of times you never met them in your lifetime. A tattoo of your soul bond's initials would appear somewhere on your skin. There wasn't a particular age of when it would appear. It could happen when you were born, while you were a teenager, after graduation, or when you were lying on your deathbed.</p>
<p>Your soul bond could be living in another country for all you knew. Nobody really knew for certain until both soul bonds realized they were fated for each other. It was supposed to glow briefly when you knew. But if you weren't paying attention, you could miss it. There were only a select number few of well-known soul bonds.</p>
<p>And since Dean had been born raised solely by his mother, he didn't know any of this until he went to Hogwarts. Considering that his mother was a muggle and he never knew his father. There were some moments that he would watch his mother be lost in memories. He could guess that she was thinking about him. But she had never remarried. It was only the two of them and he couldn't be happier.</p>
<p>And Dean had never spoke about the words, 'soul bonds' while he was home during the summers. There hadn't been a point because he never had one. And he wasn't sure if his mother would understand. He barely understood himself. And Hogwarts had required an educational class for all Muggleborns and Half-Bloods. Though Half-Bloods could be elected out if they wished. And if he had one, he doubted that he would ever meet them.</p>
<p>That day changed during his third year at Hogwarts.</p>
<p>It had happened during the middle of the Sirius Black crisis. It was common knowledge to the entire school that Sirius Black was after Harry Potter. A boy that he shared the dorm with for 3 years.</p>
<p>Dean could only feel pity and sorrow for the raven-haired teen. Harry was an alright bloke and very interesting to talk to. There had been several occasions when they both would get lost in conversations about Quidditch and the best positions. Harry would always vouch for his position as Seeker, while Dean voted for his, as one of the Chasers.</p>
<p>There would be times it would be about classes or whatever topic they came up with. But Dean couldn't bring himself to ever bring up the conversation about Black being after him. So, he never knew how it may be affecting Harry during the school year.</p>
<p>That didn't mean that Dean didn't try to distract Harry with other things. One of those times had been after the Dementors swarmed the pitch, he had still been in his Gryffindor Quidditch robes when visiting Harry in the Hospital Wing with the rest of the team. Or the time when he tried distracting him from when he received the Firebolt and his brief friendship separation with Hermione. That had been very tense when Professor McGonagall said they would be striping the broom down.</p>
<p>He had noticed that Harry had been rather put out with Hermione for that. That had been around the Christmas holidays.</p>
<p>It would be in the beginning of February that Dean would receive the shock of his life.</p>
<p>It had happened during a match against Ravenclaw. Dean was just lucky enough that he hadn't been holding the Quaffle. He would have dropped it for sure and he didn't think Wood would be too happy with him for that.</p>
<p>Dean's wrist started to burn; he used the other hand to grasp at it desperately. He honestly thought he was going to fall off his broom. Using the hand, where his wrist was burning, to grasp the broom tightly.</p>
<p>It had only lasted a few seconds, but those few seconds could have caused his death. Dean had never felt so scared in his life, not even when the Dementors swarmed the pitch.</p>
<p>It wouldn't be until the match was over, with Gryffindor winning of course, that Dean would finally check his wrist.</p>
<p>The darker-skinned Gryffindor wasn't expecting to see anything.</p>
<p>Dean almost fell to the ground when he spotted something new and in color on his wrist. Because there on his right wrist, in beautiful calligraphy, were the initials H.J.P. They were in emerald ink, not black.</p>
<p>Dean trace a finger across the fresh ink that embedded his wrist. Like it was tattooed forever on skin. His eyes were transfixed, not able to look away.</p>
<p>The Gryffindor had never been so glad that he was alone. A soul bond's tattooed initials tended to be a private matter. And he knew exactly who his soul bond was.</p>
<p>Everyone knew who had the initials of H.J.P. His soul bond was Harry James Potter. And there was no mistaking that the color of his tattoo matched the color of Harry's eyes. Never before had Dean seen eyes so vibrant green. They practically radiated the color of emeralds.</p>
<p>Dean worried his lip between his teeth, he wasn't sure what to do with this information. For as long as Dean had known Harry, he had never seen a soul bond tattoo on his skin. He didn't know if that meant that Harry just never received his soul bond tattoo yet. Or if there was another wizard or witch in the world with the initials with H.J.P.</p>
<p>Just because Dean happened to get his soul bond tattoo, didn't mean that his soul bond had his. It could be years before his soul bond would receive his, if he hadn't already.</p>
<p>It was a difficult matter to decide on what to do. And Dean had always harbored a secret crush on his dormmate. But he didn't believe that Harry actually felt the same. If anything, he just viewed him as a very good friend. Maybe not as strong as a friendship as Ron or Hermione, but a friend, nonetheless.</p>
<p>Dean sighed disappointed; he knew what he would have to do. He wouldn't say a word to Harry about his soul bond tattoo. No matter how much he wished to. He could never put Harry in that position, he valued his friendship too much.</p>
<hr/>
<p>It so happened that during the summer before Dean's fourth year at Hogwarts, his mother noticed his wrist.</p>
<p>"Dean! Is that a tattoo on your wrist?!" her voice was stern and disappointing.</p>
<p>Dean could feel his face losing color. He had almost pictured the day he may tell Harry about his soul bond tattoo. But he never anticipated for the day that his mother may ask.</p>
<p>Dean's mother's eyes were narrowed at her son, clearly demanding an explanation.</p>
<p>Dean had used that next hour of explaining about soul bonds. And the fact that some wizards and witches never received one. And that sometimes you might never come across your soul bond. And the idea that he didn't think he would ever have one.</p>
<p>Dean watched as his mother lost her disappointed stare and it morphed into one of love and affection. She gathered him into her arms, brushing her hand through his hair.</p>
<p>"And you have found yours?" her voice gentle.</p>
<p>Dean nodded in her embrace.</p>
<p>She backed slightly out of the hug and placed her hands on her son's cheeks. "Yet you are still afraid?"</p>
<p>Dean nodded.</p>
<p>She wiped away a stray tear from her son's face.</p>
<p>"He may never get his soul bond tattoo. Even if he does, he may not want me," Dean's insecurities flooded out.</p>
<p>"Nonsense," she chided. "Have faith in yourself, Dean. Maybe it is not yet time for his to appear. And from what you said about him, he has a kind heart. One must have a little patience; you are a Thomas after all."</p>
<p>"Thank you, mama," Dean whispered, grateful.</p>
<p>She smiled, "now, I believe you need to start getting ready for your fourth year. It starts in a few weeks. I hear it's supposed to be an exciting year."</p>
<p>Dean nodded, the reminder of the World Cup, now heavy on his mind. But he couldn't help the slight excitement of being at Hogwarts for another year.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Dean's fourth year was anything but boring. For starters they had Auror Alastor Moody as their new professor, who was very well known at his job before he retired. Even as a Muggleborn, Dean found his teaching methods… interesting per say.</p>
<p>The day they were on the topic of Unforgivable Curses was a prime example. He had heard of them, any who knew the story about Harry Potter and the Longbottoms' knew them. Most books about the war called them casualties, something he didn't quite agree with. But they had gotten to see what each curse did and even experience one of them.</p>
<p>Then there was the time that the professor had turned Malfoy into a ferret. He knew that he wasn't the only one that prized that memory. There wasn't a single Gryffindor that didn't despise that prat. It didn't even matter that Professor McGonagall had come to the Slytherin's rescue. Even Moody hadn't seemed bothered by the ensuing lecture.</p>
<p>Dean traced his soul bond tattoo over his robes. It couldn't be seen, something he made sure of. But it had a calming effect on him. He had been one of the few that had witnessed Ron's betrayal towards Harry. And since Dean still had a friendship with Harry, he was included by extension. So, he could understand how Harry was feeling, he had lost a friendship as well. Though it wasn't quite as tightly knitted as it was for Harry.</p>
<p>Everyone knew exactly why Harry Potter would look downcast for the next several weeks.</p>
<p>Dean still did his best to cheer Harry up, just like he did last year when he was fighting with Hermione. Only this time it was Ron and Harry still had his friendship with Hermione. And if Harry noticed that Dean would sometimes tug on his sleeve, he didn't say a word.</p>
<p>And when Ron finally apologized to Harry about his behavior after the 1st task, Dean was furious. He used that moment to pull Harry aside to talk to him. He would talk to Ron later and knew that the red head wouldn't like what he had to say.</p>
<p>Dean crossed his arms, his robes hiding the emerald ink.</p>
<p>"You better not just forgive him," Dean's eyes were sharp.</p>
<p>Harry appeared taken back by the sudden comment. "Why?"</p>
<p>"Think about it, Harry. Don't you find it a little suspicious that it literally took him almost a month to apologize. AFTER the fact that you had to face a dragon! One of his older brothers helped bring in the dragons, something he confirmed that he knew. But didn't say a word!" Dean's voice turned furious.</p>
<p>"I—" Harry stuttered. Now feeling suddenly unsure about everything.</p>
<p>"AND… he let you face that alone. He's known you for four years and he practically abandoned you. What makes you think he may not do that again?" Dean asked, his voice had a pleading edge to it.</p>
<p>"I don't know," Harry commented weakly.</p>
<p>"I know I can't force you to not be his friend. But I frankly think you deserve better than that. You have so many friends here that still stuck by your side. I'm not saying to not forgive him, but don't pretend that this past month didn't happen. Because it did and I know it affected you the worst. Ron was my friend too. Is he off the hook? No, but I plan to tell him what he did wasn't okay."</p>
<p>Harry seemed to take Dean's words to heart. Though he remained silent for a while.</p>
<p>"Anything else I should know?" Harry sighed.</p>
<p>"Just think on it for a bit," Dean advised. "I would talk to Hermione before deciding on anything. She may have another idea what to do. Having another perspective and her brains may be of some use."</p>
<hr/>
<p>Dean had noticed later there was a sudden change in Harry's behavior.</p>
<p>It was very noticeable that Harry had kept a distance between Ron. He still spoke to him, but it wasn't the tight friendship they had before. So, Dean wasn't sure if Harry was taking his advice or Hermione's. It was very possible that Harry may have taken both of their advice.</p>
<p>Dean still stayed at Harry's side, as did Hermione, throughout the entire tournament.</p>
<p>Though he felt his heart slightly plummet at the Yule ball. He knew that his mother said to be patient. Especially since Harry didn't have his soul bond mark yet. But it still hurt as he watched Harry dance with Luna Lovegood at the ball.</p>
<p>Dean turned his face away, unable to bear to look a second longer. He tried to walk away, escape for a little while.</p>
<p>That was until Dean ran into Hermione, literally. She was still in her beautiful turquoise gown. Her hair was all curled up and placed into a fancy swirl. He thought it suited her.</p>
<p>"Dean!" she shouted, surprised. She grinned at seeing him before it shifted into a frown.</p>
<p>"What's wrong?" she asked.</p>
<p>Dean shook his head; he didn't feel like answering at the moment.</p>
<p>Hermione's eyes flickered over to Harry. Understanding filled her eyes. With one hand, she grasped at Dean's wrist. The same wrist that was covered in emerald ink.</p>
<p>Dean almost jerked away but allowed Hermione to lead him anyway.</p>
<p>She placed one of Dean's hands to her waist and urged with a gentle smile to relax.</p>
<p>"Just enjoy yourself," she breathed in his ear.</p>
<p>Dean gave a sharp exhale before twirling her once.</p>
<p>Hermione answered his move with a small laugh.</p>
<p>Dean gave a small smile as he let Hermione twirl back into his arms. He led her around the dance floor, throwing her up in the air at times. By the time the song ends, Dean ended the dance with Hermione in a deep dip.</p>
<p>"Feel better?" she asked.</p>
<p>Dean nodded, "thank you for that."</p>
<p>Had Dean glanced over at Harry, he would have noticed a look of jealousy.</p>
<p>"Don't let that ruin your entire evening," she murmured.</p>
<p>Dean watched as Viktor Krum walked up to Hermione. He lifted her hand to place a gentle kiss on it. He smiled as he observed his friend blushing. He felt happy for her, Hermione deserved all the happiness in the world. Though he could swear he saw a hint of a V tattooed on her neck. Soon realizing that must be part of her soul bond mark and she had it glamoured.</p>
<p>"Take care of her," Dean whispered to Krum.</p>
<p>The Bulgarian gave a brief nod before giving Hermione a look of adoration. Taking his words as an order.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Dean didn't find the rest of his fourth year that interesting. Though he wasn't thrilled to be found in cold, icy water in the middle of February. He clutched at Harry's arm until he was safely on the platform deck. His fingers and arms felt froze as hands rubbed up and down on his back. The green on his wrist could be seen through the fabric of his robe. But Dean was too cold and almost delirious to pay it any mind.</p>
<p>The darker-skinned Gryffindor could feel his teeth chattered. Almost moaning in relief when a warming charm was cast. He cast a grateful look at Hermione.</p>
<p>"Bloody rubbish of them to have anyone in the lake this time of year," she grumbled under her breath.</p>
<p>Hermione had a towel covering her upper body, as she was the hostage for Viktor. She was still wearing her Gryffindor robes. Her fingers curled around Viktor's, which engulfed her own.</p>
<p>Dean felt numb but nodded his head. Why should other students be tortured for a tournament they didn't even ask for? It made no sense, but kept the towel close to his body, enjoying the fabric against his skin. But again, Harry didn't ask to be in this stupid tournament, and yet here he was. Though he was secretly pleased that he was what Harry would sorely miss.</p>
<p>And don't get him started on the final task. Dean still didn't know why they thought doing a maze was a good idea. It seemed more muggle than magical.</p>
<p>But he still couldn't forget the feeling when Harry appeared out of the maze with Cedric's dead body. Harry had been clutching at him desperately, tears soaking his robes.</p>
<p>Dean only tightened his grip at Harry, feeling the blood roll down his arms. He had assumed that Harry had gotten nicked by something during the maze. Though he seemed to be favoring one shoulder.</p>
<p>Dean lost track of time after that, he just remembered being in the Hospital Wing as Madam Pomfrey healed Harry's arm. It had left quite a scar, one that even magic couldn't vanish. His mind kept reflecting on the words that Harry practically screamed. Voldemort was back.</p>
<p>Dean wasn't sure what to think of that. It was definitely a scary prospect to even ponder. He had heard of the horror stories about that monster. None of them were good or flattering. He tried to push through that thought, knowing that if it were true, Harry would be in danger once more. But he knew where he would be, at Harry's side, like always. Just like he knew that Hermione would be there as well. He couldn't have any better two friends.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Dean's fifth year was bit of a blur to him. But it held a bunch of treasured memories that he never wished to forget.</p>
<p>Even though he despised the hag they had as a professor. Not to count all the impossible rules that she set as High Inquisitor. And you couldn't forget about the fear she instilled if she didn't have any control. Most Gryffindors knew what those Blood Quills did. And Dean wasn't a fool to not realize that the scars on Harry's hand was her fault. And if that toad wasn't a professor, he would have cursed her and have Hermione help. That woman deserved all shades of hell imaginable.</p>
<p>But it had marked the year that Harry's soul bond mark had appeared.</p>
<p>It wasn't in the same location as Dean's. It was on his shoulder, close to where the bone met the muscle. In beautiful calligraphy were the letters, D.T.T. It wasn't in emerald green like his, but a lovely shade of brown. And if Dean were to look in the mirror, he would see that color reflected in his eyes.</p>
<p>Harry had blushed beet red when Dean had walked into the bathroom, his shirt was off, and he was still in his boxers.</p>
<p>Dean had immediately left to try to save Harry some embarrassment. No doubt he had been trying to keep it hidden. But it hadn't worked too well at that moment. But it made him wonder if Harry had tried to guess who it may be.</p>
<p>Dean had already known it was his, after all, it was his name. But only close family knew his middle name. He didn't think even Hermione knew it. That marked the question if Hermione knew that Harry's soul bond mark had appeared or not.</p>
<p>Knowing Hermione, she pretty much knew everything. It was practically impossible to hide anything from her. And she knew his first and last name, it wouldn't be hard to piece everything together.</p>
<p>The only thing remaining was telling Harry. But he didn't know how he would go about doing that. He couldn't just walk up to Harry and blurt out that he's his soul bond. This deserved more subtlety than that. And Dean didn't want Harry to think he just wanted him because he had fame. Or the fact that Harry's initials laid imprinted on his skin. He wanted Harry, because he was Harry. Because he was kind, compassionate, thoughtful, caring, and wanted to help others. And he was a Gryffindor at nature, fiercely loyal to who he called his friends.</p>
<p>Then there was the issue of Harry being straight. How was he going to tell his best friend that he had a male as a soul bond?</p>
<hr/>
<p>It had been around Yule that Dean had gotten the shock of his life. And that was topping the day he received his soul bond mark.</p>
<p>The day had been normal enough, trying to avoid Umbridge as much as possible. While trying to pass all of his lessons and attending one of Harry's meetings.</p>
<p>He had been going to the little organization that Harry and Hermione had formed since day one. Since Umbridge and the Ministry refused to teach them how to defend themselves and pass their O.W.L.s. Hermione had decided that Harry had to teach it. It taken a little convincing on Hermione's part. But Harry had finally caved into Hermione's wishes.</p>
<p>It had been one of the last meetings before Yule break. A day that Dean would probably never forget.</p>
<p>Most of the room had already cleared out. Harry was standing by a mirror, staring at a picture.</p>
<p>Dean's heart clenched; it was a moving picture of Cedric Diggory smiling. Though he suddenly realized how much taller he was. Harry practically met him at his neck.</p>
<p>"I feel like I failed," Harry's voice was barely audible.</p>
<p>Dean rested a hand on Harry's shoulder. Watching as green eyes met his briefly.</p>
<p>"It's not your fault," Dean reassured.</p>
<p>Harry sighed, "I know. I'm just hoping that doing this…" he gestured to the room around them, "All of this, may give them more of a fighting chance."</p>
<p>"I have no doubt that it will. I believe that, Hermione believes that," Dean murmured.</p>
<p>Harry turned around to face Dean, eyes sad. "I appreciate that, I really do. But it still stands that he's dead because of me."</p>
<p>"Harry," Dean warned, "listen to me very clearly. He did not wind up dead because of you. The fault lies with Voldemort, and Voldemort alone. All he wants to do is kill because he can. Nothing to do with you. I have as much as a mark on my head because of my blood. Just like a lot of witches and wizards here. Nothing is going to change that. But we can change to have a fighting chance and survive."</p>
<p>Harry's eyes shined with unshed tears. The shorter Gryffindor made a rash and impulsive decision. With eyes determined, he slammed Dean against the wall with force. Hands on the taller boy's shoulders and pushed down.</p>
<p>Dean had not expected the action at all, and his knees almost buckled from the force. For someone who looked so skinny and small, Harry had a lot of strength to him. There was a moment of pain from his back colliding with the wall, hard. But that was the last thing on his mind for what Harry did next.</p>
<p>Dean felt warm and chapped lips against his. He let his eyes shift close and return the kiss. One arm wrapped around Harry's neck to bring him closer. The other hanging loosely at his side. He could feel Harry's hands still on his shoulders.</p>
<p>The kiss was very messy and sloppy. Saliva going everywhere. In essence, it was a very typical first kiss.</p>
<p>They butted noses together several times before Dean tilted his head to the side. It seemed to be a better angle and he rather avoid having to heal a nose. Their bodies were pressed close together, inches separating them.</p>
<p>Harry hummed his approval, not breaking the lip lock.</p>
<p>Dean had to eventually break their kiss, the need for air overwhelming his wants. His breath washing over Harry's face. He couldn't resist leaning down to press his lips against Harry's once more. It was more of a peck than a kiss.</p>
<p>Harry's face was flushed, but grinning.</p>
<p>"You amaze me, Harry Potter," Dean's words were barely a whisper.</p>
<p>Harry's blush deepened at the compliment, "as are you."</p>
<p>Dean's eyes brightened, "I'm going to be willing to guess that you like me too?"</p>
<p>Harry nodded, "ever since last Yule. I had never been so jealous in my life than in that moment. And the fact that I was jealous of my own best friend."</p>
<p>Dean brush his fingers across the Gryffindor's cheek.</p>
<p>Harry leaned into the touch, almost craving it.</p>
<p>"Then I'm happy to admit that I felt the same. Though Hermione did have to cheer me up, I'm very grateful to have her as a friend," Dean revealed.</p>
<p>Harry wrapped his arms around Dean's waist, "as am I."</p>
<p>Dean wasn't sure how long they stayed in that position. And he felt too comfortable to move. That honestly would have been the perfect moment to tell Harry about his soul bond mark. But he kept silent about it and Harry never brought up his own. It just didn't feel right to bring it up just yet. Though Dean would admit later that it could have been the shock of Harry kissing him. Or the fact that Harry had liked him since last year, if not longer. And it didn't hurt that Harry had gotten more attractive as the years went on.</p>
<p>Dean and Harry of course had to explain to Hermione what happened after the meeting. She did not miss the fact that both boys had their fingers intertwined.</p>
<p>What escaped her mouth was the most girly squeal that they ever heard. Hermione seemed to realize that as well and tried to calm down. Her excitement for her two best friends was obvious. Though her comments made them blush about finally noticing each other's affections. That she was going to curse the both of them if they didn't get a move on and stop wasting time.</p>
<p>There was this curious glint in Hermione's eyes and Dean could tell she wanted to ask something. But she was refraining of doing so. The darker-skinned Gryffindor couldn't tell if that was a good or bad thing.</p>
