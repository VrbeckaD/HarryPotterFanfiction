  <span>Harry couldn't believe his own incompetence right now. How could he fuck things up this horribly just by getting distracted by Malfoy?</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“He did what?!?”</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I'm sorry Mr. Malfoy but it seems like Mr. Potter accidentally bound you two together. It's a fully established bond, we can't do anything but wait till it wears off. You have to stay close to each other until it does,” Professor Flitwick said with a concerned voice.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry felt pulled out of his seat when Malfoy fled the room and he couldn't help but follow him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Running after the general direction of the pull, Harry slowly got out of breath; seemingly being too far from each other drained his energy, and it did it fast.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>After rounding another corner Harry felt himself slam against the wall and suddenly he stared into furious grey eyes.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You stupid little — a bond!? There are easier ways to ask someone out than to bind them to you!” Malfoy hissed.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I wasn't going to ask you out, Malfoy!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Then what? Staring at my arse from afar till we leave here? Losing the plot in class even more often because you drift off while looking at me? Don't believe I haven't noticed!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Well, I didn't ask because you obviously hate me! And I also haven't planned to bind us together!” Harry countered, heat filling his cheeks.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I don't hate you, you dumbass! But I'm definitely not going to change my behaviour just because a nitwit fancies me without doing anything about it! I have a reputation to lose!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry blinked, surprised. Did Malfoy really just—</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Wait, does that mean you want me to ask you out?” he asked.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Well, it's a bit late for that now!” Malfoy testified. “You had to go all in and bind us together, we're stuck like this for at least a week! We're moving into my room, just so you know. I have customised linen on my bed and won't sleep anywhere near your cheap stuff. And now you can make up for this by kissing me already before I really follow the urge to punch you!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Wondering how he always managed to get himself into trouble, Harry leaned in and pressed their lips together. Letting out a small content sigh he decided that this wasn't really as bad as he had feared after all. </span>
