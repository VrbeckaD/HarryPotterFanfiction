          <div class="userstuff"><p>"I love your hugs." Harry sighed as Draco wrapped both arms around his waist and buried his nose in his neck. </p><p>"I love you." Draco smiled. </p><p>"I love you, too." Harry answered. They met in the astronomy tower. Tonight was the night he was going to ask Draco to tell everyone about their relationship. </p><p>"I have something to ask." Harry said pulling away enough to look his boyfriend in the eye. </p><p>"What is it?" Draco smiled. </p><p>"Can we tell our friends?" Harry asked, nerves fluttering. </p><p>"You want to?" Draco asked in shock. Harry had wanted to keep it a secret, for his safety. Draco hadn't taken the mark though, so now he was a target anyway. </p><p>"There's no reason not to anymore. They want to kill both of us already, what difference will it make?" Harry asked, hoping Draco would agree. </p><p>"Okay. We'll tell them tomorrow night then." Draco agreed, leaning in to kiss Harry.</p></div>
