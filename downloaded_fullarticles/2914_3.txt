    <p>Despite being a famous pure blood wizard Froi Tiedoll adopted muggles. When asked he would reply it was because bonds needed to be made between the two worlds. It truth it was because he was so soft hearted he couldn’t bare the idea of anyone being left alone, and believed muggles were worse off because they had no magic to protect themselves.</p>
<p>The first he adopted was Noise Marie, the child was blind but his hearing was excellent. By the time he was five the kid could identify those approaching him by the sound of their breathing, this lead him being avoided by other kids. When Tiedoll found him the boy was six and he adopted him on the spot. They boy was kind and welcoming and proved talented in stringed instruments.</p>
<p>The second was a child called Daisya Barrie, the kid was trouble from the moment he was born and it was obvious from his eyes. He was four when Froi Tiedoll adopted him after he kicked a soccer ball into the man’s head. Some would blame this injury on his decision to adopt a three year old Kanda Yuu a few months later.</p>
<p>Kanda was the youngest of his sons, and the strangest. The kid did not like people, he hated his first name. According to the orphanage he was at Kanda had been speaking perfect Japanese from the moment he arrived, at the age of nine months old, when both his parents where English speaking. The kid had skipped crawling and forced his legs to develop the muscle required for walking as soon as his neck could support his head. Kanda was strange, by muggle or wizard standards.</p>
<p>After he was adopted Kanda proved that he could swear with the best of them no matter what language. He refused to interact with others at home or school, with the exception of Marie because he was the only one not forcing his company on the dark haired boy. Kanda was known to wonder the streets and park tirelessly, much to his father’s despair.</p>
<p>The most bizarre thing that happened that the family could remember was when a seven year old Kanda came home with a four year old boy slung over his back and demanded a doctor. The antisocial, hates the world, fears human contact Kanda willingly helped a person. More than just that the kid he had had white hair, a deformed arm, a scar over his eye and was dying of hypothermia and blood loss. Needless to say they had a doctor over as soon a physically possible, or magically possible as the case may be.</p>
