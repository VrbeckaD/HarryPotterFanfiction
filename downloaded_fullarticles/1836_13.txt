    <p>Dear Moaning Myrtle,</p>
<p><strike></strike> <strike> That old coot </strike> My distinguished colleague wants to leave a defenceless child with the worst sort of Muggles and thinks it’s all for the best? Is he right?</p>
<p>- Catnip Addict</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Dear Addict,</p>
<p>Of course he’s right! After all, the child isn’t really defenceless, is he? He will no doubt put on a burst of accidental magic and kill them all, and won’t that be fun?</p>
<p>- Myrtle</p><hr/>
<p>Dear Mirtel,</p>
<p>I found <strike> Harry </strike> [the boy I was sent after] on a small shack on an iland off the coast, where the muggles were hiding from his Hogwarts letters, and them muggles didn’t even tell him about his parents! About You-Know-Who! About magic! I’m jes so mad I could do - er, never mind. I didn’t do no cursing, what with not being allowd to do magic meself.</p>
<p>- Pink Umbrella</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Dear Umbrella,</p>
<p>Since you didn’t ask a question, I think I’ll just guess. You want to know if you were right to curse them all to slow deaths by starvation by sinking the boat that would have taken them back to shore. Since it would be a matter of simplicity to sink a boat even without magic, you would get in no trouble at all! So I’m glad you did that. Now your friend never has to go back there again!</p>

<p>Dear Moaning Myrtle,</p>
<p>Why shouldn’t first years be able to have brooms? It’s not fair at all!</p>
<p>- My father will hear about this!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Dear MFWHAT,</p>
<p>I agree with you completely. In fact, the school should provide all first years with the latest model of racing broom for all students. Ooooh! Just imagine all the new ghosts there would be if firsties learned to fly on Nimbus 2000s instead of old Shooting Stars! It would be glorious!</p>

<p>Dear Moaning Myrtle,</p>
<p>I have to spend all of my time as <strike>a rat</strike> an animal after faking my own death, and now my "owner" is trying to turn me yellow with a hand-me-down wand! Doesn't he know how dangerous that is? Anything could happen!</p>
<p>- The Last Marauder</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Dear Marauder,</p>
<p>Why fake your own death, when you could have an actual death? Real deaths are much more authentic, and I am quite sure that ghosts cannot be put in Azkaban. </p>

<p>Dear Moaning Myrtle,</p>
<p>My brothers said I had to wrestle a troll to get sorted, so I'm kind of terrified. What should I do?</p>
<p>-Youngest son</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Dear Youngest,</p>
<p>I can promise no troll for the sorting, but no worries! You will get to wrestle a troll before the year is out, and maybe you'll die!</p>

<p>Dear Moaning Myrtle,</p>
<p>How do I get people to stop STARING AT ME?! And my stupid <strike>scar</strike> [identifying feature]!</p>
<p>- Rather Have Parents</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Dear Rather,</p>
<p>Show them all you are just like everyone else. Don’t do anything out of the ordinary like defeat You-Know-Who <em> again </em>, or even become a Quidditch star. Try and keep your grades in the middle of the pack. Then, if you can manage it, try and arrange for someone else you know to do something famous (or infamous). The public is terribly fickle. They’ll drop you like a hot potato if there’s a new thing going. Do you know anyone who is dying to make a name for themselves? Maybe you can coax them into becoming a great hero (or villain) in your place. If nothing else works, arrange to be murdered. No one pays us ghosts much attention at all!</p>
<p>-Myrtle</p><hr/>
<p>Dear Moaning Myrtle,</p>
<p><strike> Professor Snape </strike>  [One of the Professors] kept calling on another student today even though I had my hand up the whole time! Is it because I’m muggleborn? Or a girl? Or because I didn’t survive <strike>a killing curse</strike> [unspecified dark magic] when I was <strike> one </strike> [younger]?</p>
<p>- Muggleborn Bookworm</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Dear Bookworm,</p>
<p>At some point in everyone’s life (or death), we all have to learn that some people are just arseholes and it’s not worthwhile to spend time trying to coax them into liking you. It isn’t a fault in you, it’s a fault in them. (I <em> might </em> be referring to someone whose name rhymes with <em> Lay Grady.) </em>Your options are: ignoring them, biding your time and waiting for vengeance, or murder. Choose well young bookworm.</p>

<p>Dear Nice Lady,</p>
<p>I is sposed to guard something, but I need walkies!</p>
<p>- 3 heads are better</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Dear 3,</p>
<p>Oh Merlin, I didn't even <em>take</em> Care of Magical Creatures, but even I know that <strike>Cerebi</strike> [large canines] can't stay in a small room all day! Tell you what, <strike>Peeves and I</strike> [two of the Hogwarts supernaturals] will unlock the door and you make a run for it. If anyone goes near the <strike>trapdoor</strike> [you-know-what], we'll set up an alarm. Be sure and leave a triple-sized poopsie right in front of the Great Hall! </p>
