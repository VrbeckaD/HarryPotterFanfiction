  <span>Chapter 1 Back Again</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The last thing I remembered as Hermione Granger was the bright green light of the Avada Kedavra. I'm glad to say that at least my murder was quick and painless. The war against Lord Voldemort had long since ended and I was already nearing my sixties (and looking great I should add) by the time I was killed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ron and I had long since broken up after our "</span>
  <em>
    <span>after war relationship high</span>
  </em>
  <span>" had settled down. We just weren't right for each other that way. We both agreed that we were better off as friends. Ron later got together with a muggle girl and settled down with their own small army of children.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry married Ginny... only to later divorce. Something about them not agreeing on future children's names. Harry then married Luna and they traveled the world together with their two kids. Ginny shortly after the divorce hooked up with Malfoy. They took a long time to get married. Which, if I'm being honest, I thought would never happen. Those two were always at each other's throats only to break out into intense make-out scenes and later disappear to never be seen until at least a day later.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I on the other hand never settled down. I had a few relationships here and there but nothing ever lasted. My life was too hectic to really settle down. With Harry traveling the world and Ron living in the muggle world, I was left to help pick up the pieces of the broken wizarding world. I became the youngest Minister ever elected, I pushed through new laws to make life better for the many different types of magical creatures. I helped hunt down remaining death eaters, learned some new skills, figured out how to shapeshift from my many babysitting adventures with Teddy, and even started a chain of successful stores to help give out more jobs.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Later in life, I ended up with custody of Teddy when Andromeda died. Harry was somewhere lost in Atlantis when that happened. At that point, I had already given up on marriage and decided to raise Teddy as my own. I threw huge parties for his birthdays, took him on all my business trips so that he could see the world outside of wizarding Britain, and I even got him a godforsaken broom to fly on. I got him through Hogwarts and later when I decided to finally step down as Minister he took over with one of Ron's many sons as his secretary. He later married Harry's daughter Lily and they gave me my first grandchild Remus Sirius Lupin.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>By the time my grandson was born, I had really mellowed out with my age. After all, I was retired and done with most of my adventures. I wanted nothing more than to relax with my grandson and wait for Teddy and Lily to pop out another grandchild for me.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Then came the epic battle that led to my death. A supposed daughter of Tom Riddle showed up. I can't really remember her name but she tried to take down my son and rule the world or something. I didn't really hear the rest after she threatened Teddy. Just know that there was time travel and a battle and Harry and Ron even showed up somehow. I think Cedric was alive in one of the timelines created. It was a great adventure just like old times... only this time I died. I died protecting my son Teddy from the killing curse. I lived a good life and I thought it was finally time to settle down in the afterlife.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Or so I thought.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When I first began to regain my senses, I realized that I was a baby. A tiny little ball of chubby limbs with two strangers hovering over me with a camera. It was confusing at first but I soon realized that I had just died. I'm sad to say it took me a bit longer to realize I had been reborn. But to be fair, I was under the impression that I was in some sort of weird limbo. After all, how else would you explain my new mother's constant need to make me suffer by changing my outfits multiple times a day? Or my fathers need to take picture after picture of every little thing I did, no matter how embarrassing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Once I began to accept my new reality, I began to work on using my magic. I, Hermione fucking Granger, the best witch of her age, brains of the golden trio, mother of the Minister of Magic was not going to let anything stop me from using the magic I fought a war for. Not even reincarnation. While I was working on that I also decided to start learning about my new world. After all, who would I be if I couldn't handle more than a couple of tasks at once?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I first started learning by paying attention to my parents' talks, and they talked a lot. Mostly through intense arguments which would quickly get abandoned if I started to make "cute baby noises." This was a big difference from my previous parents how were of the more quiet and studious type. But I would use this difference to my advantage.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I learned that my father with gravity-defying pink hair and blue eyes was named Kizashi Haruno. He worked as some sort of low ranked soldier. My mother who had oddly long blonde bangs gathered in the center of her face was named Mebuki Haruno. I didn't know her maiden name, but she was also a lower-ranked soldier like my father. It took a while to learn my name (because my parents would not stop calling cute pet names), but I later learned when practicing my wandless magic.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I was placed on a giant pillow after my mother had changed me into a pink frilly dress. I had long since lost the will to fight against my mother's constant need to re-dress me. My father was hovering behind my mother with a camera ready to take more pictures.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>My mother had just taken away my favorite toy (a stuffed dragon who I named Charlie) and placed it behind her to keep me from seeing him. And let me tell you, I was not having that. I may be a newborn but nothing was going to stop me from chewing on my favorite toy. After throwing a baby tantrum over my lost dragon, my father tried to pacify me with a giant princess ragdoll. I did not want that doll, I wanted Charlie. With my temper getting the best of me, I reached out my hand towards the dragon and tried to summon it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I failed and ended up reaching too far. I quickly found myself rolling off the pillow. My parents scrambled to reach me but I reacted first. Summoning what little magic my current body had, I created a bubble shield. My shield rolled a bit around the ground but physically I remained floating inside. Gently I lowered myself to the floor as I slowly lowered my bubble shield.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Sakura," my parents cried as they picked me up and hugged me. They squished my tiny body between their giant ones and kept crying my name over and over again. Normally I would have started to squirm when they did this but I was too tired from my casting my first successful spell to fight them. Besides, not only did I perform some flawless magic as a newborn, but I also learned my name.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sakura, Sakura Haruno. Hmm… why did that name sound familiar.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>My eyes widen as I quickly began to realize where I knew that name from. It was from one of the old cartoons my son used to watch. I believe the show was called Naruto after some orange wearing ninja. Oh, how this brought back some fond old memories of Teddy running around with a headband on his head and causing accidental magic as he tried to mimic the character on the screen. I had bought him so much merch from that show that naturally I picked up a few bits of information about it. Now... I didn't remember most of the plot but I did remember some of the main characters. Such as myself. But I don’t think my character played that much of an important role in the show.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>My parents started talking about what I just did and what it means but I was to busy going over what I remembered about the plot of Naruto.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>If memory serves me right, Naruto, the main character, was a young boy who the entire village picked on. I don't remember the reason exactly but it had to do with a nine-tailed fox demon inside him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Oh, how Teddy used to hug his stuffed nine-tailed fox to sleep. So cute. Wait I'm getting sidetracked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Okay, so Naruto got the demon after the village was attacked. A lot of people died, he became an orphan. I don't think he made any friends until he was put on a ninja team and shared his first kiss with his future best friend… </span>
  <em>
    <span>Saucy</span>
  </em>
  <span>? I don't remember the moody boy's name but I remember that kiss scene. Teddy was so shocked, he accidentally broke the TV with his magic. The same TV later came alive and ran away but that's a different story. Teddy was so sad that he couldn’t see the rest of the episode that I promised to rewatch that episode with him. I had to buy the DVDs to do that but Teddy was so happy I was watching cartoons with him. Probably shouldn't have zoned out after that episode. I really could have used that info. Some sort of test happened, can't really remember the details but I think the goal was to feed Naruto.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Looking back, Naruto had a crappy childhood. Not unlike Harry did. Both were orphaned shortly after birth, both had a demon of some sort placed in them, and both gained some nice abilities from those demons. Personality-wise he was probably more like Ron, especially in the way they ate. But I could probably see a bit of Teddy in him with his shapeshifting.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>By now my parents had calmed down and were now just taking pictures of me. I was back on the pillow, this time that princess doll on one side and a large stuffed unicorn on the other. They were probably trying to keep me from falling again. After all, my mother was now standing very close to me as my father took picture after picture.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Alright, my goal for now (besides getting stronger at magic) is to befriend my future teammate Naruto before we enter the children's ninja school.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And so began my life as Sakura Haruno.</span>
