<p>Jumping from tree to tree, feeling the wind whisk through his coarse blonde hair. Naruto leaned right before he corrected his step, once again heading towards his prior destination.</p>
<p>It was supposed to be a simple spy mission with no contact from the enemy. Get in get out, but like most things in life it went awry. Grunting he looked back towards the shadowed grounds.</p>
<p>"Kurama can you sense anything." Waiting impatiently Naruto tried again before he received any word. "No, stop bothering me." Nothing seemed to be tracking him anymore; with luck he could gain further ground.</p>
<p>Looking ahead Naruto panted with the strain of muscles he knew he should have not been overtaxed. It seemed like only yesterday when he was called in by the Hokage. He was at home relaxing after a nasty near death experience involving a new rogue ninja that had shown up near the Leaf border. And the time after that was the group that tried to kidnap those orphan children. It was nonstop.</p>
<p>After the brief war it had been quiet and peaceful until the other Villages started up again with conflict. Now that he was older he realized what Pein and Jiriya were talking about, but it was in human nature to war and fight when one was idle. Peace sounded great on paper but was unrealistic in real life situations.</p>
<p>They were in the kitchen that day in high summer; Hinata was just now showing signs of a baby bump. Sai and Sakura were to meet them later in the afternoon having some free time to eat out. He was sitting down, the small kitchen nook taking up a large part of their space. They had both purchased the small home near the Hyuga branch.</p>
<p>Shifting in the chair Naruto tried to ignore the kink in his lower back.</p>
<p>Instead he watched as Hinata poured milk. "Hinata you know I don't like milk." Laughing Hinata grabbed the orange juice, pouring some in a small glass.</p>
<p>"I know, you told me that incident one time in the Academy involving milk and Sasuke." Naruto whined as he covered his reddening face. He should have never told her that. Looking up at her through his fingers, he felt content and at peace.</p>
<p>It was tricky in the beginning after he got Sasuke back and the Hidden Village had to repair their economy again.</p>
<p>He had felt lost and hallow not knowing what his future held, but he knew he loved Hinata and her spirit. He loved his friends and this village.</p>
<p>But yet something was missing, making him on edge.</p>
<p>Sasuke was back and going on supervised missions, ROOT was officially disbanded leaving Sai to lead a new team, and Kakashi was now a part time teacher at the Academy with Iruka.</p>
<p>It only changed recently when he found out Hinata was pregnant, with his child. He was going to be a father; he was going to have a family.</p>
<p>He shifted again, his hand reaching down the dark pants to an inner lining where a ring was waiting. He was going to propose next week on her birthday. Pushing those thoughts away for right now, he eyed his breakfast."What are you going to do today?" He asked before digging into the eggs.</p>
<p>"I'm going to stop by the Hospital and sign the papers for the job, before grabbing the uniforms."</p>
<p>"Uniforms?" Sitting down Hinata nodded as she reached for her own plate.</p>
<p>"For the job. I'm a little exited to be working there with Sakura. She has already identified that last virus that was affecting the elderly."</p>
<p>Seeing Naruot's puzzled frown she went on.</p>
<p>"The two towns over from here, where there was an epidemic of Dengue."</p>
<p>Nodding Naruto raised his hands above his head, stretching.</p>
<p>"She's good."</p>
<p>He grunted feeling felt his chest expanded with the stretch. He leaned forward, his body pushing against the tiny table.</p>
<p>"She learned from Tsunade. I just wish she could expand her knowledge but the council is being slow about approving her methods."</p>
<p>"Lady Tsunade is getting up in years." Pausing at the abrupt change in conversation, fork halfway to his lips, he sighed.</p>
<p>Blue crystal eyes regarded Hinata, his lips twitching into a frown.</p>
<p>"I know, but the old hag is still spry for her age. I bet she will be there forever." Naruto knew where this was going with Hinata, she was unrelenting.</p>
<p>He didn't have to wait long before she continued.</p>
<p>"I've heard talk about her being pressed to teach the next in line to become the Hokage." And there it was, as he feared.</p>
<p>He had heard of talk around the village about the council wanting to have a second backup. There were names being thrown around, gossip following.</p>
<p>He honestly didn't know how to feel about it. He had always wanted to be Hokage, it was his childhood dream.</p>
<p>But that was because of his desire to be seen, to have people knowledge his existence. Now that he had it, he felt not happy, but content with his life.</p>
<p>"Hinata we don't even know if these are true rumors. Besides I don't think Tsunade will choose just because she was told to do so." Hinata hesitated before she crossed her arms against her chest, her white gray eyes traveling from table to his arm and up to his birth marked face, finally reaching his eyes.</p>
<p>"Think… I think there is some truth to these rumors and you're name is mentioned a lot. Maybe you should nominate yourself before Tsunade and the council."</p>
<p>"Hinata, really just leave it alone."</p>
<p>"But Naruto."</p>
<p>"NO."</p>
<p>Naruto stopped as his voice rose. He tried again, suppressing a mixture of hopeful dread and anxiety.</p>
<p>"Let the rumors go and see what happens. You know as well as I do that the council still perceives me as a threat. Let's just see wait it out." Looking at his half eaten plate he felt his gut sour.</p>
<p>Hinata meant well but some people did indeed still see him as the Kyuubi, a monstrous demon in human form, to wreak havoc and kill without mercy.</p>
<p>Hinata nodded before gripping his hand across the table, showing him he wasn't alone.</p>
<p>He knew that and thanked her silently. He also knew that he needed to treat this in an adults view. He couldn't be that rambunctious kid anymore. He pushed away the confliction thoughts from his mind before he felt his energy wane. Maybe he could go to the hot springs this morning and relax in the waters.</p>
<p>The idea held merit.</p>
<p>That was until a black garbed Sai dressed in formal Anbu gear showed up. "Sai what now." Naruto muttered as he glanced at his unfinished breakfast.</p>
<p>"Sorry Naruto but the Hokage has requested you." Sai said without actually sounding like he was sorry. Sighing Naruto got up.</p>
<p>"Let me just thrown on some shoes. Oh and Sai."</p>
<p>Naruto paused as he saw his friend sit down on his seat already eating what was left on the plate.</p>
<p>"You can have my plate, never mind. I'll see you later Hinata." Hinata hugged and kissed his lips as he passed.</p>
<p>"Eat something later and sleep, you need it." He grunted out a "Don't I know it," and left.</p>
<p>The Hokage tower was situated right behind the tall backdrop of the previous Hokages that had reigned over these lands. The structures tall spiral reached higher than the surrounding walls that enclosed the Village.</p>
<p>This was where mission reports were given and handed out to all the ninjas. Where the laws were written and where the Hokage and council presided. The elite Anbu guard were housed just to the right, in their own barracks. He passed familiar faces, lined with age and wariness; he traveled long stairs before being admitted into the office.</p>
<p>Tsunade sat with her youthful visage scrutinizing his tall frame. He had to marvel at the highly specialized medical nin jutsu that kept her looking like a thirty year old.</p>
<p>He also noted Kakashi, his one eye locked in an old personalized book from Naruto's late master Jiriya. Sakura was standing opposite from Lady Tsunade. Her hospital garbs on and her stance clearly stating she was not at all pleased to be here.</p>
<p>So it was a mission, not that surprising. He just wished he hadn't been called in. He was drained of energy and aching all over.</p>
<p>Mustering a grin Naruto strolled towards Kakashi's left side, bypassing Sakura's playful swat.</p>
<p>"Hey granny what do you want. I was in the middle of breakfast."</p>
<p>"Shut up kid." Tsunade replied gruffly.</p>
<p>"Naruto really, you're old enough to know not to antagonize Lady Tsunade." Sakura snipped back.</p>
<p>"You know me Sakura chan."</p>
<p>"Unfortunately I do."</p>
<p>"Oi you wound me." Naruto snipped back.</p>
<p>"Maa quiet down you guys before Lady Tsunade throws a sake bottle at our heads." Kakashi piped up as he glanced in their general direction.</p>
<p>"Do you want me to kill you?" Tsunade said sweetly, her eyes glittering severely.</p>
<p>Smiling Naruto held up his hands before straightening his back and standing at pride state.</p>
<p>"There has been some uprising to the South of us. Iwagakure has started to heavily fortify their holdings and recruitment. We don't have any eyes out there far enough to know what their up to. So Sakura since you're the Chief Medic at the hospital I want you to journey as far South as possible near the border and check out the hospital they are building near Awashy village. I want you to keep your ears and eyes open to any discrepancy you might come across there. Kakashi will send out his nin dogs to help you." Nin dogs Naruto knew were the specialized summing technique that Kakashi had.</p>
<p>" Naruto."</p>
<p>Snapping back to the present he waited.</p>
<p>But he couldn't help but frown as he watched Tsunade, wondering what he would be made to do. His body still felt worn-out and drained from just a light training this morning.</p>
<p>Ever since his fight with the Kaguya Otsutsuki god he had felt… wrong.</p>
<p>Kyuubi the fox demon that resided in the seal on his stomach was near silent now, no more than a ghost of thought in his mind. The old fox had finally divided his chakra to its extended reaches partly to the small babe now growing in Hinata.</p>
<p>Or so it was theorized when they had first noticed something off. He could only use the Foxes Chakra sparingly and often times it wouldn't even appear.</p>
<p>The Old Fox had once commented about leaving this plane of existence for awhile. But this wasn't Kyuubi's doing either; he just felt tired and drained all the time.</p>
<p>"Naruto I want you to personally investigate this matter at its heart. You will disguise yourself and infiltrate the Iwagakure village."</p>
<p>Naruto grunted and shifted his position, "Ah why us."</p>
<p>Wincing as soon as the words left his mouth, he sounded whinny.</p>
<p>He could see Sakura sharply look his way. He knew he was acting off balance but honestly he was tired and would much rather be at home. He loved his village and would continue protecting the people but he felt like he deserved a good long break from everything.</p>
<p>He wanted to be home with Hinata and the baby.</p>
<p>Tsunade looked at him a long moment before she got up and leaned against the large oak desk.</p>
<p>"I know everyone is running on empty fumes, more so than others, but we need to rebuild our reputation of being the strongest Village. To do that there will be sacrifices from time to time." She stopped speaking straightening her back.</p>
<p>"Dismissed. You can pick up the mission primaries up front."</p>
<p>Wanting to protest Naruto gritted his teeth as he felt Sakura's hand land on his shoulder. He could see Kakashi leaning by the closed door.</p>
<p>"Oh and Naruto."</p>
<p>Looking up he saw Tsunade, wondering what else she could possibly want. "After this mission I will have you start working here. I think you're ready." Puzzled he glanced at Sakura who had squeezed his arm.</p>
<p>"Maa Lady Tsunade don't take all the credit." Kakashi piped up.</p>
<p>Laughing Tsunade walked up to a still confused blonde.</p>
<p>"Congratulations brat the council has approved of you becoming the next in line for Hokage." Opening his mouth wide he stared before a trembling smile lit his face.</p>
<p>"Congratulations Naruto. We had wanted to tell you after this mission when Sasuke came back from his, but..." Sakura squealed before she hugged her friend. Hugging her back he felt Kakashi thump his back.</p>
<p>"Tsunade I don't…" Naruto paused as he felt his throat tighten up on him his eyes becoming a blurry mess. He was going to be Hokage; his childhood dream was within grasp.</p>
<p>"Fuck Yes." He shouted out jumping up and done like a little kid. "Alright everyone get out, not you Naruto. I want to talk to you." Pausing Naruto Hugged Sakura one last time before he turned as the other two occupants left.</p>
<p>"Naruto Uzumaki I knew you had it in you kid." Tsunade chuckled as she hugged his tall frame. Naruto hugged back, pressing his scarred cheek to her blonde hair.</p>
<p>"Come sit I need to talk to you." Naruto did as told, feeling election and awkward after his emotional display.</p>
<p>"Naruto I'm not going to surge coat this. When you step up to become the next leader you will have to make many decisions. No wait." Tsunade stopped Naruto even before he got to open his mouth.</p>
<p>"Wait and hear me out. I know you cringe at being lectured but this is important. When a leader must lead they will make many decisions, both good and bad. You will make mistakes and it will cost lives, even the right decisions sometimes carry a death sentence. This is a heavy burden that all leaders must face, do I chose that one sacrifice to save many or part with the many to save the few. You alone must carry this weight."</p>
<p>"Tsunade why are you telling me this?"</p>
<p>Tsunade for her part sighed before looking at the past Hokage portraits on the wall. "Because I know you. I also know that you try to take on too many burdens and shoulder them all. What I'm talking about is that you will come to both love and hate this position. But I think you're strong enough to overpower that hurdle. When you came back, show me that hidden ambition, and determination that won my complete truth in you."</p>
<p>Jumping through the heavily dense forest, he tried to push his body to get back home. Naruto strained, fighting the fatigue that invaded his mind and made his thoughts murky. Pausing amongst the trees he strained his hearing. All was silent, evening was approaching fast. Still he couldn't shake the sensation that he was being hunted.</p>
<p>Damnit this was his last mission for a while he just needed to focus. It was in that moment that he saw something in between two thin branches.</p>
<p>His eyes narrowed and focused on that object, all his other thoughts floated away.</p>
<p>He needed to get back from Iwagakure , to report on his findings. But he felt compelled to see what a book was doing here.</p>
<p>The book had a shimmering raw edge to it that caught the eye and bewitched the mind.</p>
<p>Eyes glazing and unfocused he wanted to touch the soft velvet exterior. Looking at the magnificent book he briefly perceived a warning in the back of his mind.</p>
<p>Kyuubi was trying to push his thoughts, but he…he needed to touch.</p>
<p>Wind thrashed in his ear when he first came aware of himself drifting in disturbing dreams. A resonance of thunder could be heard from afar. Opening his eyes he squinted in near twilight. His head pounded in rhythm to the tempo of his heart.</p>
<p>His vision was not cooperating with him, blurred and hazy shapes took up his whole world. Shadowed trees and dried grass were prominent. Breathing through his nose harshly he tried to figure out what the hell happened.</p>
<p>His fingers were numb and tingled each time he flexed them. Bringing up his knees he sat, trying to ignore his aching body. Every muscle felt like a live hot wire.</p>
<p>Nothing looked the same nor smelled the same.</p>
<p>All he remembered was running through a forest trying to get back home.</p>
<p>And a book, there was something about a book.</p>
<p>Feeling a few cold drops of rain Naruto winced, grunting with effort, he rose with quivering legs. God he felt like he was going to vomit. He clutched his stomach, before going towards his specialized pack by his right hip.</p>
<p>His fleeting hope of a medic pill was dashed as were any other thoughts momentarily. His pack was gone along with his scrolls and weapons, everything was gone except for his clothing.</p>
<p>"Kurama can you hear me." Swallowing harshly, he tried again.</p>
<p>When no sound answered back he made himself walk towards the nearest tree, ignoring the now steady downpour.</p>
<p>"Kyuubi, don't ignore me." Still nothing.</p>
<p>Biting his lip he wondered if he could scale a tree. Wanting to do this quickly he willed his chakra coils down his feet. Nothing happened. Frowning he tried again, feeling his energy swirl and slide down his body towards his feet and then nothing. T</p>
<p>he energy seemed to dissipate like a deflated balloon, leaving him more weakened than before.</p>
<p>Gritting his teeth he made the hand gestures for the summoning technique but again there was nothing.</p>
<p>Puffing he leaned into the tall tree trunk, slightly panicking. "Kurama why can't I release my chakra." Again nothing answered back.</p>
<p>"Kurama." Naruto near shouted as he looked within himself. Ever since he was a child he could travel within his own mind space to speak with the Kyuubi when he needed to.</p>
<p>Feeling the familiar wet water lapping at his sandaled feet, he took off towards where the great demon beast had been sealed within him by the Fourth Hokage.</p>
<p>Expecting to see the red eye glaring behind the sealed bars he was met instead with pitch black.</p>
<p>The seal was gone, and along with it Kyuubi.</p>
