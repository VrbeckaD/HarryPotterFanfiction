    <p>July 1975</p><p>Lord Voldemort was sitting on his throne listening to his members of his order, the death eaters.  He looked at Abacus Malfoy and questioned “So has you imbecile of a son found out who the dauphin is that is attending Hogwarts”</p><p>“No Lord! Even Dumbledore has not been informed who the dauphin is, only that he attending Hogwarts as a normal student.  And that information was given in confidence to the our ministry from the mundane Government.  Apparently if any thing was to happen to the dauphin, then the mundane government would treat it as treason against the Crown and country, and use this to seize control of our society”</p><p>Voldemort looked at the members of his order in attendance, and snarled at them.  They had one simple job to do, well the Malfoy brat had a simple task to do and they had failed him again, he looked around the ballroom that he used as he meeting chamber for his order members.  The room was designed like the throne rooms that European monarchs used.  The only chair in the room was Voldemort's throne which was suitably raised on Dias ensuring that he was the centre of everybody's attention.  His order members stood ramrod straight unless of course he was punishing them, and then they writhed on the floor in delicious agony.  His order meetings could go on for hours, and nobody in the room was allowed to sit or move unless he gave permission.  Voldemort finally voiced his opinion and commented to his audience</p><p>“How simple is it to find out the real identity of one person, who does Dumbledore fawn over at the school?”</p><p>“The Gryffindor’s Lord!  And the all the staff except for Flitch the half French squib caretaker fawn over them especially the gang called the marauders”</p><p>“So logically Dumbledore would have ensured that the dauphin was sorted into the Lion’s house, and then into his favourites group of pupils....SEE HOW EASY IT IS TO FIND OUT INFORMATION ABACUS....I.F...Y.O.U....U.S.E...Y.O.U.R....B.R.A.I.N....but I forget Abracus, my apologies!  Your family are so busy arse licking who is the most powerful in our society......that what brains you are born with are squandered.......Give me the members of Dumbledore’s favourite group  Barty”</p><p>Barty Crouch Junior looked at his Lord, the man who he would follow into the pits of hell itself and answered “The Group consists of James Potter, Siruis Black, Remus Lupin and a Peter Pettigrew Sire!”</p><p>Lord Voldemort summoned in the air the four names and continued to speak, crossing out the names as he did so “James Potter is the heir to the Potter Lordship...so he can not be the hidden dauphin....Siruis Black is the heir to the Black Lordship....so he cannot be the dauphin...Remus Lupin is the son of the Lupin one of my most junior order members, and they have never taken a foot out of Britain....But Pettigrew is a old French name and their family originally came from with the French before the middle ages....and Lupin....where does your sons friend family spend their holidays each year?”</p><p>“My Sire!....they spend the holidays with their distant relatives in France....near Paris in a small town called Versailles”</p><p>“So narrowing down the options...the dauphin has to be Peter Pettigrew......after all he is French...and his family lives in Versailles....and Orion...who lives in Versailles even now?”</p><p>Lord Orion Black looked startled for a moment and then answered “French people....My sire?”</p><p>“You idiot....you are all idiots....Versailles is the principal palace and offical home of the French Monarchy!......So all the evidence tells us what Abacus?”</p><p>“That this Peter Pettigrew is the French Dauphin Sire!”</p><p>“Yes!  SO ABACUS get your idiotic son to bring me this Peter Pettigrew, so I can court him and persuade him to join us and with him I will have the French and British Monarchy in my hands”</p><p>“Sire! What about the half-blood Snape.....he is exceptionally talented with potions, spell crafting and DADA....Lucius says that you should show an interest in him he....”</p><p>“I am not really interested in a half blood...no matter his talents...tell your son to still cultivate this half blood.....and I may in the future allow him to join my death eaters...but he will have to show his worth to me first” </p><p>With this the meeting was finished and Lord Voldemort’s death eaters bowed low to the man they had pledged their loyalty to.   </p><p>Of course what nobody had ever dare tell Voldemort was that Albus Dumbledore chief Warlock of Britain was not infallible, and him and his supporters were just if not more prejudiced against members of thier society as Voldemort was. </p><p>Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx<br/> Flash back to March 1970</p><p>Chief Warlock Albus Dumbledore was happy, so happy his plans for world domination and the defeating of the dark side led by Lord Voldemort aka Tom Riddle were unstoppable.</p><p>The mundane Government had approached their ministry and informed them that the French Dauphin was to attend Hogwarts in the fall and that he was not to come to harm accidentally or otherwise. The otherwise was that the mundane Government would see any harm coming to the Dauphin as being an act of treason against the British Crown, which still legally ruled the British magical society.  The minster of magic was reminded that any acts of treason against the British monarchy by the magical society or its members would end with the mundane government taking control of the magical society and merging the two societies into one, with them ruling everybody.</p><p>The minster of magic for the first time in living memory demanded Albus Dumbledore chief warlock of Britain to a meeting with the members of the Board of Governors, where he was informed that the youngest Dauphin of France was to attend Hogwarts in congnito,  and the repercussions to the magical society if any harm should be fall him.</p><p>Albus looked at the minister sighed and said “I am positive that the experience that the Dauphin will have at Hogwarts will be a positive experience.  Don’t worry your head about something so inane.  Now...”</p><p>“NO DUMBLEDORE! YOU listen and shut up for once!......if any harm for what ever reason befalls the Dauphin then there are cells in Azkaban for you and your staff and even the members of Hogwarts Board and I will ensure that the employment of magic supressing cuffs are used......My last act as minster will be to see the lot of you imprisioned for all time either in Azkaban or if that is not an option, due to our new masters interference in Nurmengard prison DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME! YOU WILL NOT PLAY FAVOURITES AND YOU WILL TREAT EVERY PUPIL AND HOUSE in  HOGWARTS THE SAME! We do not know who or what the dauphin looks like, the mundane Government will not even give us the alias he will be using....THEY WANT US TO FAIL! SO THEY CAN TAKE US OVER AND INTERGRATE OUR SOCIETY INTO THEIRS!  And if it happen’s because of your attitude towards the pupils ultimately under your control and care, then I will break you and everybody involved in the mess”</p><p>Dumbledore tutted and shook his head and replied “Really minister! You have nothing to worry about, the dauphin will be safe and have a happy life at Hogwarts! You have my word and vow as your and Britains Chief Warlock”  with that Albus Dumbledore left the ministers office to head back to Hogwarts School.</p><p>It took Albus five months to find out by deduction who was the French Dauphin, he looked at the children’s names coming to Hogwarts and eliminated all the girls, He then eliminated all the children he knew had British or obviously mundane parentage including Severus Snape, an apparent poor half blood boy from a Northern Town of Cokeworth.</p><p>He was left with just one name, that of a boy called Peter Pettigrew.  The boy’s family were originally French, and extended family still lived at the French royal residence of Versailles.    The boy when he visited came from what appeared to be from very wealthy mundane parents, and had apparently been privately schooled before his attending Hogwarts.  Peter even had older siblings, so of course Albus deduced that Peter Pettigrew was the Dauphin of France.</p><p>He ensured that the boy was placed in the proper favoured house of Gryffindor,  that his group of friends that included the were wolf and his Godson James Potter were allowed certain lee ways against other pupils.  Especially against that half breed boy Snape.  Yes as Albus said to his school staff and the minster they had nothing to worry about, after all the French Dauphin was having the most perfect childhood and schooling at Hogwarts.  </p><p>Perhaps both Lord Voldemort  and Albus Dumbledore should have been told about the mundane saying that assumptions very often make and ASS out of U and ME.  Because Pettigrew’s French family owned and run a profitable hotel in the little town of Versailles, and Peter’s father had become a millionaire though his own hard work, after it was well known in mundane society that  Peter’s Grandfather was a milkman.</p><p>The French monarchy since the end of the eighteenth century had relocated to more modest accommodation in a wealthier part of Paris, and only used the Place of Versailles when they were hosting important guests or events,  In fact Versailles Palace had become a national museum and international world heritage site.  It was also very outdated and the French monarchy did not really like the place, after all it was at Versailles that there was nearly a revolution by the Parisian mob.  </p><p>The Dauphin of France was the pupil that everybody despised including the teachers, he was talented and intelligant, he of course wore a glamour that Albus and others couldn’t see though to look like his British Guardians, his name was Severus Snape and for five long years his life had been a living hell though the actions of Dumbeldore’s favourite group the marauders and the school staff blatant favouritism.   It would seem that through the actions of Albus Dumbledore and his staff, that the magical society had played into the hands of the mundane Government and their future plans just as the minster of magic had feared.</p>
