</p><p>Halloween was a dull affair this year, though Lily and James had made an effort to make it as festive as possible. Her home glittered with carved pumpkins and charmed candles that didn't spread flame or burn out, and the smell of cinnamon, apple, and pumpkin from James' day of baking still hung in their cottage. Godric's Hallow was a small and quiet town, much like their home, and easy to settle into. However, with the state of the wizarding world, it was even quieter. Halloween had been an active night for the last few years for The Dark Lord and his cronies, terrorizing muggles and wizards alike and leaving people to stay inside their homes in hiding.</p><p>Both Lily and James especially, as the birth of their son Harry fulfilled a prophecy that Albus Dumbledore had stressed could very well be true, and even if it wasn't, Lord Voldemort thought it was. To protect her small family, they had taken up new lodgings in Godric's Hallow, kept secret and away from anyone else they knew and loved. It was difficult, for her husband James especially.</p><p>Lily had taken to the quiet just fine. She enjoyed the company of her young son and her husband, but she could see the isolation begin to take a toll on James. He had grown up surrounded and coddled and loved, and with the passing of his parents not more than a few months ago, and no contact with his second family of friends, he was clearly going stir crazy. As evidenced by his newfound hobbies. Baking, tinkering with muggle things, obsessive cleaning and acting as if their son was not only a baby, but a fully grown adult that he could "hang out" with. He'd crafted a number of games for the lot of them (no doubt to entertain himself more than anything), and it was sweet if not a bit dangerous for a one year old toddler.</p><p>As it was Halloween, they had stayed inside, not even risking heading to their garden. Their lights were kept low, and soft music played through the charmed muggle radio to fill their home with noise as if there was company. Early in the evening, James and Lily had hidden sweets in plain view for Harry to find, testing his skill on their feet and chuckling when he fell on his bottom, not crying because the soft marzipan candies sweetened the fall both literally and figuratively. He would be plumper by the end of the night, after all the sweet candies and pies and treats that James had made. Not that Lily minded, of course. There was nothing cuter than a baby with chubby cheeks and thighs, and if he was as active as his father was in childhood, he'd no doubt burn all his baby fat off by the time he was old enough to fly.</p><p>Which wasn't straight out of the womb, despite James insisting he'd be fine.</p><p>(He had tried, and Harry had fallen, only to be caught by a quick cushioning charm and James spending the night sleeping on the sofa.)</p><p>Now the sun had set, and the autumn coolness made the fire feel even cozier. Their home was pleasantly warm, and their bellies full of treats as opposed to proper food. Quiet, small celebration aside, the day and evening had been wonderful with just the three of them. It was almost impossible to get off the sofa, where Lily was curled up against James' side with his arms around her, and Harry seated on her lap. James had charmed a small marzipan owl to hoot and fly around him, and Harry reminded them of a cat as he tried to bat and paw and grab at the little candied bird floating around.</p><p>"We should put him to bed," Lily hummed, running her fingers through Harry's thick, soft hair. So much like James' already, and she was terribly fond of it. Pictures they had of James from when he was just a baby made her sure that their son would grow up to be a spitting image of him. But her eyes were what everyone commented on. Such a wonderful shade of green, and with James' darker skin and dark hair, it stood out so beautifully. Oh, they made a good one. Every day that went by, Lily impressed herself with what she had grown inside of her. "Would you like to sleep, my handsome little man?" She cooed at him, and received a yawn but a while of protest.</p><p>"No," his little voice came, but she could see his eyes drooping.</p><p>James reached around her, poking at Harry's chubby cheek gently. "It's time for bed, it's nearly ten." He waggled his finger against Harry's chin, and their toddler whacked at his hand before laughing when James whined in overexaggerated pain, holding his hand to his chest. "Oh, you're a killer, aren't ya, Harry? I'm wounded, oh, oh he's got me," he bemoaned, slumping over the arm of the chair and causing Harry's little face to contort into worry. He was too young to understand it was a joke, until James shot back up and grinned at their son. "Noo," Harry grinned, toothy, and reached out for him. "Dad, dad, dad. No nigh."</p><p>"Yes, <em>nigh,</em> mummy and daddy need private time, little man."</p><p>“James!” Lily laughed, swatting at his leg, only to have Harry mimic the action and swat at her own, laughing along with her. Monkey see, monkey do, she supposed. Wrapping her arms around him, Lily pulled her son to her chest and peppered him with kisses. “He doesn’t need to hear this nonsense, do you, Harry?” She could feel him squirm, hear his giggles, as she bombarded him with little smooches all over his face and hair.</p><p>“He wont remember,” James waved it off, and gently nudged Lily aside so he could stand and help both her and Harry off the sofa. “I’ll tidy up if you want to put him down, love,” he said and leaned down to press a soft kiss against her temple, red hair tickling his nose and causing a soft sneeze. Gross creature, Lily thought, but she couldn’t help but lean up and press a kiss in response against his stubbly jaw. Fatherhood and isolation had caused him to grow it, and Lily thought he was quite handsome with a bit of a beard on his chin.</p><p>“Deal,” she replied, and held Harry tight against her chest. “Lets go lay down, hmm?” She asked him, and she swore that Harry rolled his eyes in response. “I don’t need your attitude.” Lily tickled his belly, getting a series of little giggles as they started to ascend the stairs. With just the three of them, the house was a perfect size. Two bedrooms, one fashioned into a gold and cream nursery with dark cherry wood furniture and toys all around. Though they hadn’t seen Sirius, Remus and Peter for months now, they had spoiled Harry absolutely rotten. Even Marlene and Mary, Lily’s friends from school and bridesmaids in her wedding, and gifted them with a boatload of gifts and toys and clothes for their son.</p><p>As Lily looked around Harry’s room, she sighed in sadness. Harry must have sensed it, blinking up at her with his big green eyes. “Mumma?” He asked, and Lily kissed the top of his head and went to the window bench where a stuffed toy bear sat with his friends. Harry took it instantly, squishing his face against the soft fur. “Your aunt Marlene got that for you,” Lily explained. “When you were in my belly… I wish she was still here, Harry. She absolutely loved you…” Lily had named Marlene Harry’s godmother, and she truly had adored him.</p><p>“We always used to talk, how our kids would grow up and be the best of friends. She was pregnant, you know.” There was sadness in her voice, still. Mourning her friend and the baby and the life they would never get to have. “No one else but me and Mary knew, not even your dad, so don’t tell, okay?” She poked his nose, and Harry didn’t react. He had no idea what she was talking about, but speaking freely of her friends and their own secrets that weren’t James’ to hear was therapeutic. Maybe Harry would remember bits of these conversations they had when he was older, and Lily hoped that maybe he would. “Sirius would have been a good father, had he have known. It’s best he didn’t, of course. No sense in telling him now, since I think he’s been kissing your Uncle Remus on the side when he and Marlene were together,” the young redheaded woman smiled, eyes still sad.</p><p>“Or maybe it was Marlene on the side, because I’m quite certain they’ve been kissing a lot longer than your dad and I have been, if you know what I mean,” she booped Harry on the nose again, with a smile. “Of course you don’t, you’re much too young. And if I have my way, you won’t be kissing anyone for a long time.”</p><p>Downstairs, Lily heard a loud thud that caused her and the toddler to startle, and Lily blinked. “What on earth is he doing down there?” She asked, and Harry didn’t react to her question. Of course he didn’t, James always made a racket when he was cleaning up. The product of a spoiled boy who hardly had to lift a finger to clean. Thank Merlin for magic. Not that cleaning charms were James’ specialty. More often he just transfigured his way to cleanliness, the clever git.</p><p>The noise downstairs was muffled, the thick floors hiding the thumps and thwacks and groans from her husband. It wasn’t much to be concerned about, and Harry was used to noise while he slept what with their laughter or the music both she and James were fond of listening to. She put Harry down in his crib, the stuffed bear along side of him. “Try and sleep, alright, Harry? Ignore your idiot father making a bunch of noise, yeah?” She asked, leaning down to kiss Harry goodnight.</p><p>Just before she got to press her lips against his forehead, Lily heard the cry and shot straight up in an instant.</p><p>“<em>Lily!” </em> There was no mistaking the tone of the scream. James wasn’t causing a ruckus, this was much more serious than that. The hair on her arms and nape of her neck stood straight, sensing the immediate threat. The house felt instantly colder, and within a second all the lights went out. In the pocket of her sleeping trousers, Lily kept her wand, and within a second she had it in her hand. “Shh, Harry, alright? Mummy will be back soon!” Her heart hurt as she cast the silencing charm on her son, followed by a disillusionment one to hopefully hide him from the eyes of the danger in her home.</p><p><em>“Lily, go!” </em> She heard James call for her to flee, to take their son and go past the wards (why weren’t they working!?), and disaparate as far as she possibly could.</p><p>Like hell she would.</p><p>“James!” She screamed back, shutting the door to Harry’s nursery, debating for half a second on whether to put a spell on the door to keep it locked. She was quite skilled at them, but the fear of someone being unable to get in to her son should something happen to both her and James had her simply praying to Merlin that they would all be okay.</p><p>So Lily ran, grabbing onto the bannister and using it to turn quickly down the stairs. The carpet floor and her bare feet gave her good traction, and she was young and panicked, nearly jumping down the stairs as she rushed to find her husband. Though her footing wasn’t nearly as graceful as her doe patronus may have led people to believe, and with a crash she missed her landing and fell to the ground, wand clattering feet away. But it didn’t matter, all that did was finding James.</p><p>Using a small table, Lily pulled herself up and ignored the pain in her ankles from the fall. Anything was repairable with magic except life itself, and she hadn’t a care in the world the damage that could be done to her body so long as her family was safe.</p><p>With her hands on the wooden table, her eyes came to the picture on top of it. One of her, James, and their friends with Harry. Only a day old, surrounded with love. She wasn’t going to give that up so easily, and it clicked in her head something that she had stored in this very drawer over a year ago. Panicked, Lily yanked the drawer open. “James!” She screamed again, flinging papers and cards and silly trinkets out of the drawer until her fingers wrapped around the cold metal of a muggle weapon.</p><p>It was as if there was a wand in her hand, and the confidence of such returned and she pushed herself away and ran to the living room. Lily stopped on a dime, red hair falling around her face as she saw the scene. James hadn’t responded since he had told her to go, and she saw why. Long, grey fingers were wrapped around his throat, holding him from the ground as the air was squeezed out of him. “Put him down!” She screeched, fingers fumbling on the safety clip on the handgun. What on earth was a gun in response to the wand that was held against James’ temple. Her husband was clawing desperately at the Dark Lord’s wrists, needing air.</p><p>At Lily’s words the monster turned, eyes narrowed like slits and making Lily’s heart stop in her chest.</p><p>“Give me the boy, girl,” the Dark Lord said, his voice full of enjoyment. “And I’ll let your husband live. A life, for a life.” She watched as he pushed his wand harder against James’ temple. She could see his wand on the couch, left there from when they’d been sitting as a family.</p><p>“A life for a life,” Lily agreed, voice shakey. James’ eyes widened, but unable to speak. Surely he didn’t think…</p><p>No, he had to think better of her! “A smart girl,” Voldemort cooed, almost affectionate, and loosened his grip on James’ neck enough for him to cry out. The sound of Voldemort’s voice made her sick.</p><p>“Yeah, a smart girl,” she inhaled, taking a deep breath and lifting her hands up. She’d never fired a gun before, hadn’t any idea of the kickback or the power of it. She’d simply stolen it from a muggle police officer with an accio charm, something coming over her before they’d moved to Godric Hallow, as if she had known it could come in handy.</p><p>But there wasn’t time to think about it, how to properly hold it or work it. She’d seen some in muggle movies and television, and knew only to point and pull the trigger. So she pointed the handgun, and pulled the trigger. It threw her arms back, almost like it was going to rip them out of their sockets, and she cried out in discomfort. The crack was unlike any aparation sound, and glass shattered immediately after.</p><p>Everything happened so quickly. James was on the floor, scrambling for his wand on the sofa while Voldemort’s hands held the wound at his stomach. Confused, no doubt, and Lily took her opening and aimed for his head. Could she kill a man? There wasn’t much choice or thought, when it came to her family or the monster who was responsible for the death of friends and loved ones and strangers alike.</p><p>So she pulled the trigger again. And again, and again, and again, eyes closed and hoping James would have sense to stay out of the way. Lily kept pulling the trigger until there was nothing more than hollow clicks and laboured breathing.</p><p>Slowly Lily opened her eyes, gun falling to the ground as she saw both her husband the Dark Lord on the floor. There was blood, covering the floor and filling the house with the smell of it. It made her sick, and Lily doubled over before emptying the contents of her stomach onto the floor, heaving and heaving until there was no more to come up.</p><p>“Lilypad..?” James asked, and the sound of his voice had Lily falling to her knees in relief. She crawled over to him, and not caring about the mess on the floor. It could be cleaned. “James?! Oh Merlin, James…” She said, tears filling her eyes and pulling him against her.</p><p>“You okay?” He asked, and she buried her head into the nape of her neck. “It’s alright, love, it’s alright now.” The young man rubbed at her back for a few minutes before picking her up on shakey legs. He placed her on the sofa, pulling a throw around her shoulders. She could see dark bruises forming on his neck already, could hear the hoarsness from it in his words. “Stay here, I’ll get Harry…” He left her his wand, using his own hand to wrap her fingers around it before kissing her forehead.</p><p>He left quickly, wanting to check the welfare of their silenced son. Lily didn’t like the idea of being alone now, and hoped he’d return quickly. So she could calm with her family before packing their things and leave, to tell Dumbledore. This place wasn’t safe now, since someone, Peter it must have been, had told the Dark Lord where they were.</p><p>“James, get Harry some clothes!” She called out, looking at her shaking hands. She was managing her breathing now, and was almost some sort of calm when she heard another crack. Her heart stopped, and Lily was on her feet in a second with James’ wand in hand, pointed in the direction of the sound. “Severus!” She cried when she saw the unforgettable figure in her living room.</p><p>She wasted no moment stalking over to him, blanket falling from her shoulders and wand at his throat. “Get out of my home!” She screeched, as Severus’ hands went to her shoulders. The hand holding James’ wand curled tighter, into a fight fist, before it went flying to his nose.</p>
