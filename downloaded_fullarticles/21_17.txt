    <p>Adrien’s owl dropped a letter in front of him. After four years of it, the excitement and hope that it might be new friends or literally anyone else had worn off. Instead, Adrien sighed and grabbed it, wondering what it was that his father was going to complain about today.</p><p><em>Adrien, </em>the letter began, incredibly unimaginatively despite the fact that his father was the final word in wizard fashion. </p><p>
  <em>I expect your grades to show improvement from last year's disappointment. The sorting hat may have made an egregious mistake, but that will not reflect poorly on our family.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Gabriel Agreste</em>
</p><p>Rolling his eyes, Adrien flicked his wand at the letter, turning it into a little paper swan which flew away. The gesture only brought him a moment of relief though and he frowned into his breakfast. Looking past the sea of red and gold around him, he looked across the table over to the Hufflepuffs, where Nino was watching his paper swan fly out the window. Once it was gone, Nino looked at Adrien with concern, which he replied to with a noncommittal shrug.</p><p>What was Adrien <em>supposed </em>to do? He was about as high up in the class ranking as he could get, with only two Ravenclaws, a Slytherin, and a Gryffindor being above him. None of them could touch his grasp of Ancient Runes. And, of course, most of them aren’t as intimately familiar with the ins and outs of transfiguration as he is, but that’s what happens when you don’t have many friends in your house and have a lot of spare time to spend reading.</p><p>While he was looking across the tables, he saw a late arrival dashing over to the Slytherin table across the hall. His heart skipped a beat when he recognized those black pigtails and bright blue eyes and suddenly any concerns about his father were thrust to the back of his mind. He saw her for a few moments before the big crowd blocked his view after she sat down. </p><p>Adrien looked back at Nino, whose expression had turned from worry into a smug grin. A blush spread across Adrien’s face as he angrily put a finger to his lips. He’d get around to asking out that cute Slytherin!</p><p>...Eventually.</p><p>Assuming she even noticed him. He hadn’t failed to notice that she tried her hardest to not be in the same room as him whenever possible, even though their best friends were dating. Maybe she was taking the house competition thing seriously like everyone else. He sighed. Marinette was just about the only reason he’d ever wish to be a Slytherin.</p><p>--------------------</p><p>Adrien rushed into Potions class and took a seat, breathing heavily. This was one class he definitely didn’t want to miss. Even if Potions was his least favorite subject, it was also the only one Gryffindor shared with Slytherin. </p><p>Thinking of the House, his eyes darted across the aisle and saw Marinette seated and ready to start, giggling at him. A blush spread across his face and he quickly looked away as class began.</p><p>Professor Slughorn began the demonstration on how to properly brew a calming draught, a demonstration which quickly devolved into personal anecdotes and stories. All of which he’d heard plenty of times before since the Professor had invited him to his club and thus felt comfortable ignoring now.</p><p>Instead, Adrien kept himself busy by sneaking glances at Marinette whenever she wasn’t looking and pretending to read from his Potions book whenever she was. Which was surprisingly often, now that he thought of it. When the professor was done giving his rambling speech, he let them begin working.</p><p>Almost immediately, as he was looking up at Marinette, he noticed that a Slytherin next to her was about to add the wrong first ingredient to the potion. He winced - he was too far away to help and even if he wasn’t they probably wouldn’t listen to a Gryffindor anyway.</p><p>The Slytherin’s wrist was halted when Marinette caught it in her hand. Adrien’s face lit up when Marinette started talking to them and the correct first ingredient was put in instead. Kind <em>and </em>smart. </p><p>“You won’t get far by gawking at the competition, Agreste!” Professor Slughorn slapped his back, startling him, as giggles spread through the classroom. His face turned red and he went back to work, doing his best to avoid looking in her direction for the rest of the period.</p><p>---------</p><p>Once Potions was over, Adrien had a free period and decided to spend it in the library. Hopefully he’d find Marinette there. She gave the best head scratches. Their conversations may be one sided, but he was always happy to lend a listening ear. </p>
