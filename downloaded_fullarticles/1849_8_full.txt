    <p>It's not the first time Harry's gone on a dangerous, undercover mission. Truthfully, most of Harry's school years could count as one long dangerous, undercover mission. </p>
<p>In the week leading up to the mission, though, Draco finds himself spending as much time as he can by his husband's side. This includes crowding Harry when he's only trying to make coffee in the morning, sitting right beside him on the sofa even when there's plenty of unoccupied seating around the room (including the other side of the sofa), and draping himself all over Harry's side of the bed as they're both falling asleep. </p>
<p>"Miss me already?" Harry sighs, on the third day of Draco's extra-clingy campaign. </p>
<p>"Miss you? Never," Draco replies, taking an aggressive sip of Harry's tea and setting his chin on Harry's shoulder. "Don't think so highly of yourself. You're just comfortable." </p>
<p>"Right." Harry rolls his eyes and makes his way to the living room as gracefully as any man might with a six foot barnacle hanging off his left shoulder. </p>
<p>"Who needs a duvet when I've got you, eh?" Harry says with a grimace on the fifth night, peeling Draco's arm off his chest. "You'd think it was mid-July with how overheated you've got me." </p>
<p>"Oh, I'll overheat you," Draco mutters, putting his arm right back over Harry's naked chest. He's too tired to follow through on his vague promise, but it makes Harry chuckle anyway. </p>
<p>"It's like I married a cat," Harry groans, scrabbling for his wand on the bedside table, which makes it roll off and clatter to the floor. "Ah, fuck. Draco, cast a cooling charm, will you? My wand's gone under the bed." But Draco's too sleepy to answer. </p>
<p>"Be good while I'm gone," Harry says on the seventh morning, running his thumb over Draco's chin. "No extradimensional portals. No dark allegiances. No megalomaniacal plots." </p>
<p>"I can't promise any of that, least of all the extradimensional portals," Draco snorts, giving that thumb a brief kiss. "You shouldn't have married a dark wizard if you wanted to avoid all that." </p>
<p>"I know, I'm a fool." Harry presses his lips to Draco's high forehead, then to Draco's own mouth. They spend a few more minutes at the door simply caressing each other with lips and hands, chaste but full of meaning, before Draco shivers in the chill of the October morning air. </p>
<p>"Alright," Harry laughs, "get back inside before you catch your death of cold. I'm going to work." And he pulls away, starting the walk down the secluded cottage path. </p>
<p>"Harry," Draco says, catching the other man by the wrist with a note of warning in his voice. "Don't do anything stupid." </p>
<p>"It's the only thing I know how—" </p>
<p>"I'm not flirting now, you arse. I mean it." Draco squeezes his fingers tight around Harry's wrist, as if to better prove how much he means it. "I know you like to fling yourself into the fray to prove how much of a hero you are, but for once, think of your suffering husband and be at least a bit of a coward." </p>
<p>"You <i>would</i> like that," Harry snickers. "I promise, Draco, that I'll try my very hardest not to die again." </p>
<p>"It's not funny," Draco murmurs, but Harry steps up onto the threshold of their home again and draws him in for one more kiss. </p>
<p>"I know. I'll be careful." </p>
<p>Six months. Six months of Harry gone, undercover for the Ministry and out of contact. Draco thinks he's meant to work as an Unspeakable, with all his Harry-ness Polyjuiced into oblivion. It's for Harry's safety, of course; the middle-aged savior of the wizarding world can hardly comb his hair forward and stride unnoticed into a den of ne'er-do-wells. And of course, Draco doesn't even know if that'll be the case. Harry's not allowed to tell him anything. </p>
<p>The first day Harry is gone, Draco wishes he'd forced Harry's hand, made him quit his vile Auror career and settle into something with a lower fatality and injury rate, like poison-tasting. He and Harry had wasted so many years of their lives loathing each other as Malfoy and Potter that Draco gets desperate for Harry's company after long enough. </p>
<p>Six long months. </p>
<p>"No news is good news," Hermione reminds him, when she catches him scanning the Prophet a little too intensely over tea at the Weasley-Granger home in Chudley. </p>
<p>"Listen to Granger," Pansy says, when he complains to her later about Hermione's apparent mind-reading capabilities. </p>
<p>"He's Harry, isn't he? He always comes out alright," Ron assures him the next time he’s over, because Hermione told him about Draco's obsessive checking of the paper. </p>
<p>"How embarrassing to be so worried," Blaise drawls, over tea a week later. Draco agrees, all the more for being called out on it so many times.  </p>
<p>Draco does his best to take their words to heart, even Blaise's, since he knows they translate to <i>You know he'll be fine.</i> </p>
<p>Six months. Draco spends most of those six months in the garden, weeding and pruning and planting and watering to keep his worst fears at bay. He works without magic, because otherwise the work goes by too quickly, and he's left with his thoughts again. Harry will be so happy to see how much their garden has flourished when he comes back, given he hasn't much of a green thumb himself. It also means that when company comes calling, they often have to talk to Draco as he's kneeling in the dirt. Hermione and Ron are for it, Ron even pulling on a pair of gardening gloves himself to pitch in, but Pansy and Blaise aren't quite as on board. Pansy teases him, a Malfoy working with his hands, and Blaise complains of the sun, the bugs, the humidity, of having to point his voice down and ruining his posture. He notes they don't stop coming over, though, letting him ramble about everything and anything, and responding in kind. Good friends, even when they're annoying ones as well. </p>
<p>And then six months are up. Any day, now, Draco will hear the creak of the gate that needs oiling, and Harry will be coming down the cottage path, looking exhausted but happy to be home. Draco will pretend Harry's only been gone a day, stand steadfastly ignoring him—oh, who is he kidding? He'll fly down the path, and collide with Harry so hard that Harry will have to pick him up, <i>then</i> tell Harry how annoying it's been to have to tidy the house all by himself so he'd better not leave again. He won't have tea ready, but together they'll have a meal done up in no time. After all, Draco's left the kitchen just the way Harry likes it, with little caches of spices in tactical spots around the stove, his favorite pan ready on his favorite burner. </p>
<p>"Any day now," Hermione reminds him. </p>
<p>"Your husband's always one for dramatic entrances," Pansy points out. </p>
<p>"Harry's probably tying up loose ends," Ron snorts. "Can't leave well enough alone, the bugger." </p>
<p>"I mean, he's <i>probably</i> not dead. He's very bad at dying, historically," says Blaise. </p>
<p>Six months become seven. The Ministry has no answers for Draco, but his friends are probably right. Harry takes his cases seriously, and he'd never pull out of a mission over something as trivial as a deadline. </p>
<p>Eight months. The case must be deep. Draco thinks about expanding the garden and starting an orchard. </p>
<p>Nine months. He takes Dreamless Sleep to force himself to get rest. He doesn't find anything to say when his friends visit anymore. </p>
<p>Ten months. Draco plants a mulberry sapling at the back of the garden after pushing the boundaries of the property out with an Expansion Charm. Harry's going to be so surprised to find an entire tree has grown while he's been gone, never mind that it got a head start. </p>
<p>Eleven months. Mrs. Weasley brings him a mountain of cooked food after Ron apparently tells her about Draco's empty kitchen. Draco realizes, after she's left, that she's put away Harry's spices and hung up the pan on the stove. </p>
<p>A year. A year since Harry's departure, since he kissed Draco on the threshold of their little blue cottage and promised he'd be careful. The Ministry finally admits they've had no contact from Auror Potter in the past eight months. </p>
<p>And because the Ministry can't admit they seem to have misplaced Britain's most famed modern wizard—<i>Think of the fallout! Think of the panic!</i> they say—no search is launched. When Draco presses that he ruddy well doesn't care about "the panic" if he hasn't got a husband anymore, he's told that putting out a search for Harry Potter could jeopardize his mission, if it's still underway. </p>
<p>His friends don't have any more platitudes to give him. </p>
<p>When Harry Potter has been gone for three long, torturous years, Hermione helps Draco arrange a funeral for an empty casket. </p>
<p>"He's not dead," Draco says, even as he picks out the wood for the coffin that will be inhabited by the memory of Harry. </p>
<p>Hermione sighs, and gives him a choice between peace lilies and orchids. He chooses the lilies. </p>
<p>The news is finally broken. Harry Potter is presumed dead, after a hushed-up disappearance, and the fact that it breaks via the front page of the Daily Prophet means that Draco can't refuse to mourn in peace. Although the masses are held back fifty solid meters from the funeral, he can still feel their eyes on his back, still makes him feel as though he might as well be burying the casket right in the middle of a public thoroughfare. </p>
<p>"It's okay to cry," Pansy tells Draco, squeezing his hand as he returns from being the first to pour a shovelful of dirt into the grave hole; public opinion is apparently that Harry Potter deserves to have a mausoleum all his own, but even if Harry were truly dead, Draco knows he'd hate that. So he has a tombstone, like anyone else. </p>
<p>"He's alive," Draco says to Pansy, and that seems to make <i>her</i> cry, instead. </p>
<p>"Oh, Draco," she says, which is something Hermione's said, too, and Blaise, and Ron, and Mrs. Weasley, and everyone else he's ever told that his husband is not dead. </p>
<p>He'd feel it, if Harry's life force had been snuffed out somewhere. He's sure of it. And so, even as he attends Harry's funeral, stony amid a sea of wailing and sobbing, he considers his next move. </p>
<p>Draco's been working on a tracking spell since the one year anniversary of Harry leaving to go undercover, is the thing. His progress has been slow, because no one would help him with it, and because he's learned to keep the project to himself to avoid being categorized as crazy. </p>
<p>He sits, after the funeral, in his empty husbandless house and whispers to his wand, "<i>Find Harry.</i>" No fancy Latin to be misinterpreted, no flourishes on Old English or Greek words, just his simplest desire put to magic. <i>Find Harry.</i> </p>
<p>The third reason the spell took so long to construct is because it's powerful. As it leaves Draco's wand, it embarks on a trip around every inch of the globe, hunting for Harry's magic, and his alone. It will seek him where the air is thinnest, and where the water is darkest. It will look for him in every crowded city and every lonely plain. Wherever Harry is on this planet, Draco's spell will find him someday, dead or alive. And when it does, it will open a portal—all Draco will have to do is step through. </p>
<p>From then on, Draco finds a sort of calm that his social circle mistakes for acceptance of Harry's death. Pansy reminds him, privately, that if he needs to cry, she won't make fun of him, or tell anyone, and it makes Draco laugh that those are her biggest priorities. The mulberry sapling has become an impudent teenager of a tree, and Ron has named it Maisie, which no one asked him to do, and yet the name sticks. Neville isn't really one of Draco's friends, but one day he's in Draco's garden anyhow, listening to Ron extoll how much he's learned about gardening and how proud he is of Maisie. Draco smirks to himself amid the herbs. </p>
<p>Blaise is the only one who sees through him. "You're up to something," he says over tea, lounging across the sage green sofa with narrowed eyes. </p>
<p>"If I wasn't up to something, I wouldn't be a Slytherin," Draco replies with a delicate sip. "Are you ever not up to something yourself?" </p>
<p>"Touché," Blaise snorts. "But what I'm up to hasn't got to do with my dead husband. It's been a year, Draco." </p>
<p>"No, it's been four years since his disappearance," Draco corrects. </p>
<p>"I knew it. I knew this whole peaceful act was a sham." Blaise sets his tea cup down on the coffee table just firmly enough to underscore his last word. "Draco." </p>
<p>"It's not a sham!" Draco sets his cup aside as well, though more because his hands are trembling. "I know he's alive, and I've—" </p>
<p>"You've what? Hired a private investigator? Sent some dogs out after him?" Blaise interrupts. "I am trying, Draco, to be as sensitive as everyone else, and Hecate knows it's hardly in me to tread lightly. But you are in dangerous waters." </p>
<p>"I can believe what I like." Draco crosses his arms, his legs, until he feels like an irritable pretzel. "My husband is alive. You don't have to agree, until the day he comes back through that door, and then you'll have to tell me how stupid you were to tell me to just <i>accept</i> that I was a widower. You'll see." </p>
<p>Blaise sits up and leans forward, scrubbing his hands down his face. "I am <i>worried</i> for you, Draco, I'm not trying to tell you off. You need to let this go." </p>
<p>Draco stands, so abruptly he almost surprises himself. "What I need to do," he says as he tugs the sitting rumples out of his clothes, "is tend to my garden. You may join me quietly or find the door." </p>
<p>"Draco." </p>
<p>"I need to put bird netting down. You may help me if you like, though I'm sure you'd rather die than work with your hands." </p>
<p>"Draco, you're not well." </p>
<p>"I suppose that's goodbye, then, Blaise." Draco raises his hand as he heads to the bare, now unused kitchen, toward the back door that lets out into the garden. "Goodbye." </p>
<p>Blaise doesn't come round again, not by himself. He comes with Pansy, and sometimes with the whole gaggle of Pansy, Ron, and Hermione, but he eyes Draco with such disappointment that Draco finds himself avoiding Blaise in his own home. He just needs Harry to come home, and then this whole thing will blow over. </p>
<p>And then it happens. </p>
<p>It's a cloudy Tuesday afternoon in early summer, not any day of particular note. Draco is reading a Muggle gardening magazine with a cup of black tea, thinking idly about making mushroom polenta for supper later. And now, there's also a tear in the fabric of Draco's living room, a jagged window looking out over a blustery, rocky landscape with sparse grass and an ocean view. </p>
<p>The tea slips from his fingers, the cup shattering between his feet. </p>
<p>Within hasty moments, Draco is shod, cloaked, and armed with his wand, striding through the portal without so much as a message left to anyone who might look for him. The irony is not lost on him, but this is <i>it</i>. Five years of being deprived of the love of his life, and now—now they'll be over. He can start a new chapter in his life, if not pick up where the previous, interrupted chapter left off. Everything will be okay now. </p>
<p>The wind is vicious on the other side of the portal, icy as Draco's cloak billows and snaps in its capricious grasp, and yet still it's drowned out by the crash of the ocean at the bottom of the cliff he's standing on. Draco tastes salt on the air. Draco sees, as he turns around, that he's on a tiny crag of an island, and the only thing to look at besides sea and sky and rock is a dilapidated shack in the center of the land. </p>
<p>That has to be where Harry is. Draco strides toward it immediately, heart just behind his teeth. He's always passively wondered why Harry wouldn't have come home if he's as alive as Draco claims, wondered if Harry had been hurt, brainwashed, mutilated beyond even his own recognition. Wondered, on some dark nights, if Harry had seen an easy way out of a disappointing marriage to a terrible and stupid man. </p>
<p>But he can't think about any of those things. He can only think of putting his hand on the door to the shack, which doesn't have a door knob so much as a hole to pull it by. </p>
<p>The inside of the shack doesn't match the outside. Inside feels like a real house, with sturdy walls and a hodgepodge of chintzy furniture. Of course there'd be magic in play; no one could survive in what looked like an abandoned fishing hut all this time. There are no stairs, so whatever dimensional charms are in place aren't terribly advanced, but they certainly serve their purpose. It looks a bit like the ground floor of the Burrow in here, Draco realizes. </p>
<p>"Harry?" Draco calls through the small house, and wishes he could quiet the sound of his heartbeat as he listens hard for a response. Nothing. </p>
<p>He takes cautious steps deeper into the house. Rather than a kitchen, living room and dining room, there's a single room containing the elements of all three that Draco might call a den. A table by a shabby armchair holds a leatherbound journal; it looks handmade, and like it's seen a fair amount of use. He touches a single, hesitant finger to its edge, and when no curse flies from its cover, he picks it up and lets it fall open to a random page. </p>
<p><i>There's a wedding band on my finger. I must be married to Ginny, I think, but I can't go back the way I am.</i> </p>
<p>"What—?" Draco whispers, tracing the letters with one finger. The handwriting looks like Harry's, only shakier, less focused. </p>
<p>The front door slams open. Draco had left it ajar, he suddenly realizes, and if that's Harry, he must think there's an intruder. Draco tucks the journal into his cloak without thinking, and shouts, "Harry?" before rushing back into the entryway. </p>
<p>And stops. </p>
<p>There, framed by the rocky wilderness just behind him, stands Harry Potter. Hair long, beard full, glasses cracked, but <i>his</i> Harry. Draco surges toward him, every nerve in his body singing its joy, his mind coming apart because it's Harry, Harry, <i>Harry—</i> </p>
<p>"Not a step closer!" Harry barks, his wand raised at the end of a tense arm. Draco comes skidding to a halt, holding his hands up, and he looks Harry over frantically. He doesn't look hurt. He looks remarkably healthy, in fact, for someone living alone on an uninhabited island. His eyes are hard, and stranger still, full of recognition. </p>
<p>"Malfoy," Harry spits. </p>
<p>What a fool he was for using a spell he'd put together himself, without expert Hermione's help. What an idiot, for stepping through any portal after years of magical education. He must have entered another timeline, one where he and Harry had never reconciled, had never fallen in love, gotten married. He let the portal seal behind him, and now he's trapped here, further than ever before from his own true Harry. </p>
<p>Except Draco recognizes the ring on the hand not holding a wand. He remembers sliding that ring on Harry's finger as Harry grinned through his tears of happiness, and even before that he remembers picking out the ring set with Harry, remembers pointing at it in the case and getting Harry's nod of approval. </p>
<p>This is worse than the wrong timeline. This is a nightmare. </p>
<p>"Harry," Draco whispers, Harry's wand still pointed at his throat. "What are you doing?" </p>
<p>"How did you find me?" Harry snarls, jabbing his wand at Draco. </p>
<p>"It was—" Draco swallows, and again, and tries to wet his suddenly dry mouth. "It was a spell I made." </p>
<p>"A spell <i>you</i> made." Harry laughs, cold and humorless. "Do you think I'm stupid?" </p>
<p>"Never, Harry." The words come out in a voice so small it’s nearly inaudible. </p>
<p>Harry grunts, searching Draco's face. "Who else knows I'm here?" </p>
<p>"No one." </p>
<p>"Liar." Harry taps the end of his wand against the soft underside of Draco's jaw. "Have you come to kill me, then? Take revenge for your sorry excuse of a father going where he belongs?" </p>
<p>"Harry," Draco says, soft and wavering, "what's happened to you?" </p>
<p>"Stop calling me Harry! You don't have the right!" Harry shouts, and Draco winces as the wand jabs him in the esophagus. "What's your game, Malfoy? Eh? Did you do this to me?" </p>
<p>"Do what?" Draco shuffles back, just enough to get clear of Harry's wand. </p>
<p>"This! I'm—I'm old! I've got aches, and crow's feet, and there's gray in my beard! I've got a bloody <i>ring</i> on my finger!" Harry brandishes his left hand with its scars, the ring binding him to Draco. "But as <i>I</i> remember, I'm twenty-three!" </p>
<p>A boulder drops into the bottom of Draco's stomach, drags it down with its weight. "How long have you been in this house?" He doesn't dare call Harry by any name, now. </p>
<p>Harry doesn't answer at first, glaring suspiciously, and then, "Five years." </p>
<p>"You've been Obliviated," Draco says, just as it dawns on him. "Har—" He stops himself. "You're thirty-eight. Not twenty-three. Please put your wand down," he adds, with a glance downward. </p>
<p>Harry grits his teeth. "And then what? You'll hex me? Not a chance, Malfoy." </p>
<p>"You've been alone," Draco says slowly, as he moves an equally slow hand toward Harry's wand, "for a long time. I've come to take you home." </p>
<p>"Where's Ron, then? Where's Hermione? They'd be the ones to bring me home!" His voice is frantic, now, losing the intimidation he'd had when he first came through the door, though his wand is still a very real threat. "I wouldn't go anywhere with <i>you.</i>"</p>
<p>He can't cry. Not yet. Not now. <i>Please just come with me,</i> he readies himself to say, with deep breaths. </p>
<p>"Why haven't you come back in all this time?" he asks instead. </p>
<p>Harry startles, enough that Draco can finally push his wand down without meeting resistance. "I—what do you care?" </p>
<p>"Please, Harry," Draco pleads, in spite of Harry's previous reaction to his first name. "I need you to come home." He can't cry, but he is anyway, tears burning his eyes as he reaches for Harry's left hand. </p>
<p>"Don't touch me!" Harry snaps, pulling away. Draco feels riddled with knives, another one added every time Harry rejects him, and this one slides home right between his ribs, burying itself in his heart. But he holds up his own left hand. </p>
<p>"Harry, please." The ring on Draco's finger matches Harry's. The only piece of gold he'll ever wear, it's engraved with a single branch of holly and hawthorn each, twined together. The engraving was a custom job—there are no other rings like theirs. </p>
<p>"What are you showing me?" Harry growls. "Someone married you? Can't say I don't pity—" </p>
<p>His eyes focus, narrowing as they take in the engraving, then going wide with recognition. Realization. <i>Horror.</i> </p>
<p>"No," Harry moans, voice small. He reaches for Draco's hand, and Draco mirrors him, ready to clasp Harry's hand. Instead Harry grabs at the ring, trying to yank it off, and Draco yelps. "It's a glamour charm! Or transfigured! How did you know how to make it look, Malfoy? Been spying on me while I suffer through missing decades of my life?!" </p>
<p>Draco struggles against Harry's strength to snatch his hand away, and cradles it to his chest as he stares at Harry, panting. </p>
<p>"You're disgusting," Harry sneers. "Even if I was gay, I'd marry just about any man before I'd ever even look at you. I can think of at least ten men worth a thousand of you <i>apiece</i>. What a pathetic trick." </p>
<p>Draco sinks to the floor, still holding the hand wearing his wedding ring, squeezing his eyes shut against Harry's words. He can still see, painted across the backs of his eyelids, how happy and beautiful Harry was on the day of their wedding, can remember when Harry slid this ring onto his finger in return. </p>
<p>"Why would you even try it, Malfoy? What's to be gained? Because that's what everything you do is about. Getting something out of others." </p>
<p><i>No extradimensional portals,</i> Harry had said on the last day Draco had seen him, before sweetly kissing his forehead, then his lips. He supposes he's broken that promise, coming here. </p>
<p>He thinks of himself and Harry seated in front of the hearth, a blanket made by Mrs. Weasley drawn over their laps, going over plans for their wedding day; Harry had thought a seating chart was silly, but Draco knew Pansy ought to be kept away from the Weasleys for the sake of peace. He thinks of Harry kissing him, affectionate and chaste; he thinks of Harry kissing him again, hungry and passionate. </p>
<p>"<i>Expecto Patronum,</i>" he says, quiet under the barrage of cruelty coming from Harry. A silver rabbit leaps from the end of his wand under his cloak, and sits expectantly in front of him. "Go to Ron, or Hermione, whichever you can find first," he tells the rabbit. And then, touching the rabbit's throat, he says, "I've found Harry. My Patronus has the coordinates. Please Apparate as quickly as you can." </p>
<p>Harry misses the words, apparently, because he only notices the rabbit once it's bounding for the door. </p>
<p>"A rabbit Patronus?" he snorts. "That tracks. A creature that runs and hides at the slightest hint of danger." </p>
<p>That's not what Harry had said when Draco's Patronus had changed its shape from a peacock. <i>A rabbit keeps its family safe,</i> he'd said. </p>
<p>Draco walks past Harry with tense, drawn-up shoulders, but Harry doesn't attack him, just watches him with wary eyes as Draco heads out to the cliff's edge. He's just in time to see the rabbit dash across the waves in long, supernatural hops, before it disappears into the mist. If they're as close to England as he thinks they are, it won't be long before backup arrives. </p>
<p>"Who did you call?" Harry demands as he walks up behind Draco. "I'm not afraid to fight anyone you've summoned, you know." </p>
<p>"Ron or Hermione. Whichever she finds first." Harry could so easily push Draco off the cliff to his death right now, and he thinks he'd welcome it. "Since you won't go with me." </p>
<p>"Too right I won't." But Harry doesn't push him, hanging back like a sulking teenager. Which, Draco supposes with a sad smirk, he is. He says he's twenty three, but if he woke up an eighteen year old and hasn't seen anyone since, he's probably not much different now than he was five years ago. </p>
<p>Draco breathes evenly on the cliff, eyes half-lidded as he takes in the sharp ocean air. There's a somber peacefulness here, actually; he supposes if he had woken up fifteen years in the future, confused and paranoid, he might also come to a place like this to figure it out. </p>
<p>Within the hour, a soft pop of displaced air heralds the arrival of Hermione, and Draco wills himself not to let himself fall off the cliff's edge after all when Harry runs to her with glee. </p>
<p>"Harry?" Hermione stares at Harry as she arrives, her tight voluminous curls eddying around her bloodless face. "Oh, <i>Harry!"</i> And she she breaks into a run, arms flung out so she can wrap them around Harry as she buries her face in his chest. Harry flings his arms up, his face inscrutable, but he lets her. When she comes up for air, her face is wet, screwed up with crying. </p>
<p>"Oh, Harry, we thought you were dead! I can't believe it's you!" She squeezes him tight again, as if to prove to herself again he's really there. "I'm so sorry, Harry, we all gave up on you, and you were here all along!" </p>
<p>All Harry does is search Hermione’s face, expression still oddly flat. </p>
<p>Then Hermione sniffles. "All of us except Draco, I mean, he never stopped looking for you. Oh, Harry, you must be so happy to see him again, but why haven't you come <i>back?"</i> </p>
<p>Now Harry frowns. "'Draco'?" </p>
<p>"Yes, your husband," Hermione huffs, pointing at Draco where he's been watching from a distance. "Why haven't you come home, if you were this close, Harry?" </p>
<p>"Hermione!" Harry cries, as if she'd said some horrible slur. "Why would you say something like that?" </p>
<p>"Because I had to attend your funeral!" Hermione bites back. "So if you feel put-upon because one of your best friends wants an explanation for letting her think you were dead—" </p>
<p>"I'm not married to <i>Malfoy!"</i> Harry says, voice tinged with desperation. "That's <i>his</i> bollocks story!" </p>
<p>Hermione steps away from Harry completely, and his arms fall to his sides. "Harry—" </p>
<p>"He doesn't remember," Draco says at last, voice flat. "Anything. Ask him how old he is." </p>
<p>Hermione looks at Draco in alarm, then turns back to Harry. "You know how old you are, don't you?" she asks, faintly. </p>
<p>"I've gathered I'm older than I think," Harry says with a shrug. "But by my count, I'm twenty-three." </p>
<p>"Oh, Harry," Hermione says again, twisting her hands together with a pained expression. "I'm so sorry. Is this why you never came home?" </p>
<p>Harry locks his hands together behind his waist. “How do I know you’re not Goyle in disguise, or something?” </p>
<p>Hermione stops. “What?” </p>
<p>“Goyle's never been an actor,” Draco snorts to himself. </p>
<p>“You may not have hexed me yet,” Harry says, producing his wand again, “but I don’t know that you’re Hermione.” </p>
<p>“Harry—oh, fine.” Hermione plants her fists on her hips. “Ask me anything you like.” </p>
<p>“When did you realize you were in love with Ron?” Harry asks, holding his wand up. </p>
<p>“The birds,” Hermione replies, and Draco realizes for all he’s learned about Harry’s friends, he has no idea what she means. “<i>Oppugno</i>,” she adds with a wry little smile. </p>
<p>“Could have tortured that one out of Hermione,” Harry says with a shrug. </p>
<p>“Veritaserum, then,” Hermione says, hands going to her purse. But Harry holds up his other hand. </p>
<p>“Haven’t got any, won’t trust any you’ve got.” There’s a waver in his voice that reminds Draco of how young Harry’s mind is. This truly is not his seasoned Auror husband—this is a boy running on luck and hard-won experience. “If you’re really Hermione, and you want me to trust you, you’ll sit here until I know you’re not Polyjuiced.” He points at the ground with his wand. “No food, no drink, no spells.” </p>
<p>“Fine.” Hermione begins to fold herself down to kneel on the hard earth, and tugs at Draco’s robes to ask him to sit with her. Harry comes just close enough to collect both their wands. </p>
<p>“At least he didn’t mention how old we must look to him,” Hermione murmurs to Draco, watching Harry take his seat several feet away from them, all three wands bunched in his fist. </p>
<p>It takes three hours, during which Draco’s legs and hips fall asleep over and over no matter how he sits on the uncomfortable, rocky ground, before Harry finally agrees that Hermione is Hermione. He doesn’t seem to have the same concern for Draco’s identity, presumably because trust was never at stake there. </p>
<p>"I didn't know if it was safe to come look for you, to be honest," Harry says, as he helps Hermione to her feet. "I thought I'd been caught in some kind of time traveling hex, and well—I didn't want to muck anything up. You, of all people, know how delicate time is. I didn't you or anyone else to die, or vanish, or anything else on my account." </p>
<p>Hermione hesitates, glancing at Draco again before saying to Harry, "I'm just so happy you're alive, and that we've found you." She holds her hand out. "Will you come home?" </p>
<p>"Promise there's no time travel to worry about?" Harry says, taking her hand. "I won't erase you from the timeline by sneezing at the wrong time or anything?" </p>
<p>"Promise," she agrees with a smile, then holds her hand out to Draco. "Come on then," she says, and Harry scowls. It makes Draco want to take his place on this godforsaken rock, be the new steward of Harry's seaside cottage. Hermione sighs, and lets go of Harry to approach Draco. </p>
<p>"Draco," she says, just barely audible over the crash of the surf behind them as she puts firm fingers to his jaw to make him look at her. "I know this can't be easy for you." </p>
<p>"He called me disgusting," Draco says, watching Harry give him such a look of loathing that tears prick his eyes. "Pathetic. Said even if he were gay—Hermione, he doesn't even know his own sexuality anymore." </p>
<p>"Something happened to Harry, but that doesn't mean it isn't <i>fixable,</i>" she insists, turning his face down to her again. "We will fix this. You'll get Harry back." </p>
<p>"I don't think he wants me to get him back." </p>
<p>"Well," Hermione says, setting her mouth in a flat line, "what if we figure all that out somewhere that <i>isn't</i> a cliff off the coast of Galway?" </p>
<p>"I'm going home," Draco says. "You should probably take Harry to the Burrow." </p>
<p>"You should be at the Burrow, too!" Hermione replies, but Draco shakes his head. </p>
<p>"I can't, Hermione. Just take him to the Burrow, let Ron and Molly go berserk without all the dour husband talk." He makes an attempt at a wan smile. "You'll know exactly where to find me." <i>In the garden.</i> </p>
<p>He Apparates before Hermione makes it back to Harry. </p>
<p>And when he gets home to the house that has been waiting to welcome Harry back, and will go on waiting still, he cries until he throws up, then cries until he falls asleep.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>⚘</p>
</center>The news breaks within three days. The Boy Who Lived has become The Man Who Lived Again, and the wizarding world goes into a weeklong celebration. Draco only knows because he never canceled his Daily Prophet subscription.<p>He wonders what it must have been like at the Burrow, when Harry came back. Molly must have gone absolutely spare. Ron must have wept, and Draco bets he called Harry a wanker through those tears. For them, it would be a sad but funny quirk that Harry couldn't remember any of them past the Battle of Hogwarts, not an insurmountable agony. </p>
<p>Pansy and Blaise come by during that week-long celebration, during which Draco never leaves his home. Draco is poor company, and he knows it, is sorry for it, but his friends don't seem to hold it against him, bringing him baked goods and wine. Well, Pansy brings him wine, then Blaise tells her Draco oughn't have alcohol lying about the house in a voice he thinks Draco can't hear. </p>
<p>Molly makes a visit, and just as she had within the first year of Harry's disappearance, she brings him lasagne, meat pies, hearty stews, heaps of roasted vegetables, and all other kinds of recipes usually meant to feed an army of Weasleys. She brings him desserts, too, like an enormous seven-layer trifle, a raspberry-lemon tray bake, and a rich-looking chocolate cake, all floating in behind her under miniature shielding and stasis charms as she Floos into the cottage.  </p>
<p>"Oh, Draco," Molly says, sighing as she takes a slow, heavy seat beside him. She was never spry in the time Draco's known her, even when she was just <i>The Weasel Mum</i> or whatever awful dismissive thing he was taught to consider her as a child, but twenty years after the end of the war, she seems to have gotten smaller, all her aches compressed into a shrunken space. "I can understand Harry a bit, you know." </p>
<p>Draco fiddles with his wand in his lap, and Molly pulls it away from him with delicate fingers to set it on the coffee table. "It hurts worse, this way," he mumbles, and she rubs his back. </p>
<p>"I know, darling. But he's been through a lot. And he doesn't know the wonderful, caring man you've grown up to be." She cards her wizened fingers through the back of his hair, and he shivers. Every touch Molly gives him always feels like a gift, even now. "Don't you remember what it was like, when you were the age he thinks he is?" </p>
<p><i>I've been through a lot, too,</i> he wants to say, but he just swallows the words, because surely missing a spouse doesn't compare to losing half a lifetime of memories. "I hate to remember that age. I like things the way they—I liked how it was, right before Harry left." </p>
<p>"Things were so different then." Molly sighs again. "Your father did his best to make you as twisted as he was, and for a while, it worked. With only those memories, can you blame Harry for feeling the way he does right now?" </p>
<p>"No." Without his wand to keep his hands busy, he wads up the hem of his long shirt between his fingers. "I don't blame him at all. I just want him back, Molly." His vision blurs, and the backs of his hands are suddenly wet. </p>
<p>"Well, I didn't just come with food, you know," Molly says, already dabbing at Draco's eyes with a handkerchief pulled from nowhere. He screws his eyes shut and lets her. "I've got a bit of good news, sweetheart." </p>
<p>Shock opens his eyes wide, and Molly nearly jabs him right in the tear duct. "Lead with that one, next time!" he splutters, but they're both giggling. "Tell me!" </p>
<p>"We've taken Harry to St. Mungo's, of course, and while it took a bit for them to make their final diagnosis, but it looks like Harry's memory is treatable." </p>
<p>Warmth floods Draco like a dam breaking, and he turns to squeeze both Molly's hands. "They can fix Harry? They can bring back <i>my</i> Harry?" </p>
<p>"They said it's going to be a Legilimency treatment! How exciting!" Molly squeezes Draco's hands back. </p>
<p>"Legilimency treatment?" Draco pauses. "But doesn't that require—" </p>
<p>Molly hesitates. "Ron is going to get the ball rolling. Then Hermione." </p>
<p>He lets his hands slip away from hers. "He won't want my help." </p>
<p>"You don't know what he'll want by the time my Ron is finished with him, and especially after Hermione does her part. I'm sure they'll both work to help Harry see you in a good light." </p>
<p>It doesn't make him feel any better. Molly bids him farewell after showing him each and every dish she's brought him and where she's put it away, and Draco is left inside his empty home, its only occupant. He lays about with his mind buzzing in the remaining hours before bedtime, then summons a pillow and blanket from the closet so he can sleep on the sofa. He can't bring himself to go up to the master bedroom anymore, to lay down next to no one. </p>
<p>To be near the nursery. </p>
<p>Not that they'd even decided yet how they'd acquire the child that would give the nursery its purpose. No, that had still been in question when Harry had left on his mission five years ago, but they'd most definitely agreed they would be parents by the time they were thirty-five. Harry was just so taken by the idea, once it had been put on the table, that he couldn't help but collect furniture, toys, knick-knacks, and all other sundry baby items in the second bedroom, bit by bit. Draco had managed to convince him not to buy baby clothes until they'd finally decided whether to adopt or have a surrogate. </p>
<p>Thirty-five had been the age he'd picked out a casket to bury in his husband's name, instead, and now it seems he has no husband anymore. And so the nursery remains under a layer of dust. </p>
<p>Nobody tells him when the Legilimency sessions begin, though he knows each of Harry's emotional anchors—that is to say Ron, Hermione, and himself if Harry ever lets him—must endure no less than five arduous sessions over the course of as many days. Draco spends the days waiting to hear about the beginning of the sessions in a gardening fever, with colder months approaching. He'll need to start a new compost, take cuttings, collect seeds to get the garden through winter, just to start. </p>
<p>Then Ron and Hermione knock on the cottage door, and when Draco swings it open, Ron grins at him. "Part one is complete!" </p>
<p>"What?" Draco is lost as the pair of them swan into his home. Ron doesn't miss a step as he heads into the kitchen, looking for his pair of gardening gloves. </p>
<p>"The Legilimency healing, he means," Hermione clarifies. "His five days with Harry have finished, and as far as the Healers and Harry himself can tell us, it was a success!" </p>
<p>"The squash needs harvesting," Draco says to Ron as the other man pulls his gloves on, and Ron nods before heading out into the garden. He turns back to Hermione as he walks. "What do you mean by a success, exactly?" </p>
<p>"I don't mean anything by it except that Harry's recovered a good deal of his memories this past week." She follows Draco outside, and collects a big wicker basket from its place against the wall to take over to Ron. Ron's already thwacking away amid the delicatas, and Hermione puts the single squash he's managed to harvest into the basket. "It's excellent news, if you ask me." </p>
<p>"If you ask anyone at all," Ron snorts. Draco gets down to his knees in the soil to add to the harvesting effort. "Whew, though! What a ride it was. I think I've recovered some lost memories, myself." </p>
<p>"Harry's taking the weekend to rest," Hermione says, wrangling the squash as Ron chucks them toward the basket; sometimes he doesn't make it, and sometimes he throws the squash too hard, saved only by Hermione's quick cushioning charms. "And then—Ron! Be more careful!—it's my turn." </p>
<p>"They're squash, how careful do you have to be? You'd have to chuck them against a brick wall to smash them." </p>
<p>"They're little patty pans, not Hagrid's giant pumpkins. Is it really so hard to just put them in the basket?" </p>
<p>"You do it, then!" </p>
<p>"I would if my hands weren't too small for—" </p>
<p>Ron yanks off the gloves and whisks his wand over them, shrinking them down to something more like Hermione's size. "Here you are, then, a custom fit." </p>
<p>"You're unbelievable," Hermione mutters, but she accepts the gloves and shimmies past Ron to take his place. </p>
<p>"What's it like?" Draco asks, finishing a cut on another stem. "The Legilimency." </p>
<p>"Well, mate," Ron says, tapping the handle of the basket. "It's intense, I won't lie to you. It's like reliving all those memories, not just seeing them happen but <i>living them</i>, and because there's two of you in there, it feels like there's somehow, I dunno, double the colors?" </p>
<p>"What sort of memories did you go through?" Draco does his best to sound casually interested. </p>
<p>"More pub nights than I care to admit. Going to World Cups together. Harry coming with me when I finally admitted I needed glasses," Ron says with a chuckle. "What a bastard he was about it, for someone who's been a four-eyes since before I knew him." </p>
<p>"Oh," is all Draco can manage, because he'd expected— </p>
<p>"When Rose was born, and Hugo, too," Ron continues. "Not that Harry was there in the room when they popped out—" </p>
<p>"Use any other word, please," Hermione groans, then, "Can you just say born? Don't actually find other words." </p>
<p>"—But he was there at the hospital. So were you, for Hugo's birth," Ron adds, his face suddenly solemn. "Because you two were dating by then." </p>
<p>"Oh, they were, weren't they?" Hermione says, her wistful look a sharp contrast to the way she hacks at the squash vines. "God, do you remember how surprised we were?" </p>
<p>"Oh, I do now, unquestionably," Ron agrees. "We went through a bit of that as well. Harry made some kind of up-his-arse speech about how he knew we weren't like to accept Draco, and I said something wise about how we're all grownups giving each other second chances." </p>
<p>"No, as Molly told me, you said now wasn't the bloody time for more of his Malfoy obsession, then later on told him you couldn't believe he'd brought Draco fucking Malfoy to the birth of your child." </p>
<p>"Blimey, Hermione, can't you let me get away with just one?" Ron groans. </p>
<p>"I cannot, not ever," Hermione says with a fond smile in return. "It was in our pre-nup that I'm sure you never read." </p>
<p>Draco's heart twists in his chest. "And how does Harry... feel?" </p>
<p>Ron sighs. "I dunno, mate. We were both pretty checked out by the end, I didn't stop to ask if he'd remembered how to be in love with his old school rival yet." </p>
<p>"Ron." </p>
<p>"I'm being honest with him," Ron says, gesturing at Draco. "I'm not going to puff him up with horseshit and see him trying to run into Harry's arms before the time is right. It's a kindness, Hermione." </p>
<p>Hermione sets her mouth in a line, looking at Draco grimly. "Ron's right, I suppose. I wouldn't advise you to think too much about it at this stage, Draco." </p>
<p>"I can't believe you said I'm right," Ron chuckles. </p>
<p>"I said I <i>suppose</i> you are!" she says, with a particularly vicious saw at the vines. "But yes, we didn't tell you when we got started for a reason." </p>
<p>"But you wanted to tell me about the end of the first round of treatment?" Draco cuts the last squash, placing it at the top of the small heap in the basket. </p>
<p>"Well." Hermione coughs into the back of her fist, then pulls the gloves off. Ron restores them to their gigantic Ron-size. "It felt like such good news, you know? One week, then another, and by then..." </p>
<p>"By then, what? Harry won't hate the sight of me anymore?" Draco pushes himself to his feet. "I think we'd better get some herbs cut, too." </p>
<p>Ron trundles off with the basket of patty pan while Hermione follows Draco to the herbs. "It won't help if you think of it that way, you know. We're all doing our best." </p>
<p>"I know." Draco stops at his bench to trade his knife for a pair of shears. Hermione picks up a pair as well. "But maybe what I need to work on is figuring out how to not be loved anymore." </p>
<p>"Don't, Draco." She looks at the herbs at their feet. "Good lord, do you think you have enough basil?" </p>
<p>"I like making my own pesto," Draco says with just a hint of defensiveness as he kneels. "And I share with Molly." </p>
<p>"This is a mad amount of basil," she says with a shake of her head, but she gets down to join Draco and begins snipping. "I just want you to find, I don't know, a middle ground between having fantastical expectations and giving up. I certainly don't want you to give up." </p>
<p>"If I give up, then any outcome exceeds expectations," Draco says with an arched brow. </p>
<p>"Oh, stop it. I'm giving you a project." </p>
<p>"Yes, Professor?" </p>
<p>Hermione rolls her eyes. "Do you think you could put together a photo album? Of, you know. You and Harry?" </p>
<p>Draco stills. "I'm sure I could, given I'm an adult with both hands and eyes and a reasonable sense of coordination between the lot." </p>
<p>"I did think of asking you to collect memories for a Pensieve viewing, but—Harry's seen modified memories before. And I assume you don't want to let go of any of those memories. So, a photo album." She pauses. "I think that would do more to help Harry understand how you're a part of his life, more than anything Ron and I could do, honestly." </p>
<p>Draco frowns, neither agreeing nor disagreeing, and he and Hermione snip a few more plants in silence before Ron comes back into the garden with a new basket for them.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>⚘</p>
</center>The photo album is the first thing to get him out of the house in two weeks. Or well, off the property, anyway, if being in the garden counts as out of the house. He heads to a crafting shop in Hogsmeade and picks up a blank photo album bound in soft leather, the color of which is set by the clerk upon purchase. Draco chooses a brilliant shade of green that reminds him of Harry's eyes, and the witch at the counter smiles gently as she says, "That's a lovely color, dear." Draco adds a fresh roll of double-sided Spellotape to his purchase, because his sticking charms wear off faster, and gives the witch a faint smile in return.<p>He begins by going upstairs. It's not that he's ceased going into the master bedroom altogether—after all, he hasn't moved his wardrobe downstairs—but retrieving clothes are about the only thing he's gone into the room for, keeping his eyes down as he walks. He pretends, as he enters the room this time, that he is not surrounded by his husband's memory's ghosts, and gets to his knees to pull a large, bedraggled white box out from under the bed. He grabs framed photos from the bedside table and the dresser in quick succession, and hurries back to the safety of downstairs. He collects other pictures from around the house, and brings it all to the kitchen table where the blank photo album and Spellotape are waiting for him. </p>
<p>The box is full of photos, thrown in higgledy-piggledly by Harry himself. They'd agreed, once they started buying frames, to be choosy about which photos had earned the real estate of being displayed about the house, but too many photos were still too precious not to keep. Draco reaches in. </p>
<p>Here, a photo of Harry at the Fantastic Zoo in Brighton, licking his scoop of ice cream right off the cone in a perpetual loop of disappointment; a kappa with its webbed hands pressed to the wall of its tank appears to be laughing at him in the background. Here, a yelping Draco in the process of dropping a magnificent roast as he pulls it from the oven; he remembers having felt so sick about it, even as Harry rushed to help him put the roast back in the pan and wait patiently while Draco went over the roast with delicate cleaning charms that would remove dirt and debris but not any of the seasoning. It had been Harry's kindness that had kept him from tearing up the photo. </p>
<p>Here, a day at the shore. There are a few, documenting the worsening of Draco's sunburn in succession, and Draco snorts as he fans them out on the table. Harry had looked so gorgeous in the sun, in the water, and Draco had fried to a crisp—but then, he's reminded in the last picture he finds from the beach day, Ron had gotten just as burnt, marking their first strange bonding moment. </p>
<p>Here, the oldest photos, from the place where they met as adults. Each of them had been solo vacationing in Connemara National Park—not far, in fact, from where Draco had finally found Harry. They hadn't meant to run into each other, and Draco remembered what a nasty surprise he'd found it to be, to have Harry bloody Potter ruining his holiday, encountering him again and again in what was supposed to have been the vast wilderness of Connemara. They also hadn't meant to talk to each other; before Harry had disappeared, he and Draco could never agree on who had initiated their first real conversation. They hadn't meant to grow to like each other, isolated from the rest of the wizarding world and everything that might be said about Harry and Draco laughing together after the war. </p>
<p>They hadn't meant to grow fond of each other in those weeks away from everyone and everything. Draco certainly meant to kiss Harry by the time he did, though, and certainly meant to invite him to his lodgings, and Merlin, he might have meant to fall in love with him, too. </p>
<p>It had been rough, transitioning from their holiday romance, built in a month of being ensconced in the Irish wilderness, to their real lives filled with terrible history, expectations, responsibilities, and very, very shocked friends. Especially Harry's. A theory that Draco had drugged Harry with some sort of lucid love potion went around, and Harry was dragged to St. Mungo's for thorough testing, but he came back with clean results save for his mild dependence on sleeping draughts. <i>See?</i> Harry had said to his friends. <i>It's real.</i> </p>
<p>Here, their wedding photos, stacked in their own smaller box. Harry and Draco beneath the arch, with Harry in a combination of a Muggle tuxedo and formal robes, and Draco in heavy robes embroidered with silk ribbon and silver thread. The day had been hot and he'd taken them off as soon as the ceremony was over, he remembers. Photos of all the friends Draco had gained by becoming part of Harry's world, each as wonderful and strange as his own friends, if in a much more earnest way. A particularly odd photo of Narcissa Malfoy and Molly Weasley chatting together, looking uncomfortable; such is the effect of Draco's mother, he supposes. </p>
<p>A photo of the day they moved into their cottage, standing proudly together on the threshold with their arms slung about each other's shoulders, Harry beaming as Draco kisses the side of his head. Molly had taken this photo. </p>
<p>Draco starts pasting photos in, scribbling around them with a self-inking quill as he goes to note dates, places, commentary on how the weather had been scorching or how Harry had just bought this particular shirt only to sacrifice it to his inability to eat neatly at an Italian restaurant. Draco peppers in, whenever he really feels it, how proud he is of Harry, and of their relationship, and how in love he is. And because he feels it near-constantly, even with Harry's recent rejection, he writes it all over the photo album. </p>
<p>He fills the album end to end, packing in not just photos but old owled letters from when they were bothering each other in Connemara, from when they had started courting each other outside of the fantasy world of hols—here's the one where Harry had asked Draco to move in with a simple, short sentence, the imprint of a key folded into the parchment still there after all these years. He puts in the long letter Hermione had owled him detailing all her reservations about the relationship, warning Draco of all the ways she'd make him feel pain if he was being insincere or otherwise awful, but ultimately offering her blessing, with Ron's signature at the bottom for an easy cosign. Draco almost thinks of taking it out when he realizes he's reached the end of the album and has some more photos he'd like to put in still, but Hermione's (and Ron's) letter feels too important to the cause the album is to serve. </p>
<p>Even with the blessing of Harry's closest friends, Draco still remembers the way his face burned as he apologized to them for years of harassment, abuse, stalking, undermining, and stark bigotry. He thinks of Harry's furious face on that crag in the Atlantic, Harry's accusations of plotting to murder him, and he hopes, he <i>prays</i>, that Harry has seen it in Ron's memories, will see it in Hermione's. </p>
<p>Of course, once the album is complete, he realizes he doesn't know when he'll have a chance to give it to Harry. Draco leaves it in the center of the kitchen table, supposes Ron and Hermione will give him another visit when Hermione's part of the Legilimency healing is complete. </p>
<p>For now, he takes Blaise up on his dinner party invitation, and tries very hard to be sociable and present, not thinking about Harry or the photo album at all, for at least this one night. The wine helps.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>⚘</p>
</center>A week has passed since Ron and Hermione helped Draco harvest all the squash in the garden, and he's heard nothing from either of them, nor from Molly, whom Draco knows to always have an ear for Harry's business. He can't bring himself to believe there must be something innocuous keeping them from updating him—it feels too much like the early days of Harry's disappearance.<p>He could, of course, owl Hermione. Or Ron. Or Molly. Anyone, really. It's just—</p>
<p>Well, he'd have his answer, wouldn't he? </p>
<p>And the longer he goes without it, the more he knows what it is, twisting his insides with dread and panic and pure, crushing depression. </p>
<p>Harry hates him. Harry <i>must</i> hate him. The five days of Hermione's sessions with Harry are days past, now, and so too have his days of rest following the procedures. Harry will never want to see him again, and now none of their friends—<i>his</i> friends—will talk to Draco ever again, out of respect for Harry's rekindled loathing of Draco. Maybe one of them will at least be kind enough to send back Harry's rejected wedding band so he can—so he can—</p>
<p>He can't think of destroying their rings, not even in a self-pitying spiral of hypotheticals. </p>
<p>What he can do is garden. Even if Harry wishes Draco would blink out of existence, Draco's plants still need him. Summer is in full swing, and there's plenty more to harvest and tend to. Between the cucumber vines and radish leaves, the skin on his forearms has somehow been rubbed raw, even with gardening gloves on; the fairytale aubergines are much easier by comparison. Maisie is doing well, but she needs pruning as she grows. There's a moment, as Draco looks out across all the work he's set himself, where he realizes he doesn't remember how many times he's expanded the back yard; it feels less like a garden and more like a field. He's certainly going to have to give most of his harvest away, probably mostly to Molly. </p>
<p>Draco still has flowers, though. With summer comes the peace lilies and their move to the outdoors, where Draco will keep a passive eye on them like children told to play outside. Such a temperamental plant—but they had been so important for Harry. A tribute to his mother. </p>
<p>He forces himself to finish the transplant, each plant newly rooted in the patch reserved as the lilies' warm weather home, before letting his body slump to the warm soil. </p>
<p>Harry hates him. Harry <i>hates</i> him. It is the only conclusion Draco can draw, a full five days out from Hermione's last session with Harry. Harry hates Draco, who loves Harry with every fiber of his pathetic soul, and here Draco is, replanting the floral representation of Harry's mother for a man who will never see them. </p>
<p>Draco lies on his back amid his flowers, looking up into the painfully clear blue sky. He could die here, let the earth claim his body, and with it every memory of Harry. The lilies could feast on how much Harry used to love touching Draco's skin, now decaying to mulch; they would grow stronger and taller with how Harry would need to be pulled to bed, nodding off over the facts of a difficult case. Even if Harry could no longer love him, the flowers would love him until there was no more of him left but the memories Harry refused to reclaim. </p>
<p>The windchime over the back door—its tubes shaped like little brooms, its sail a snitch—lets Draco know someone's entered the garden. Draco stills, but he doesn't show himself. </p>
<p>"Malfoy? Are you out here?" </p>
<p>In an instant, Draco sits bolt upright. Harry stands uncertainly by the back door, wiggling his fingers with anxiety at his sides. Draco misses that tic, the way he misses all of Harry's idiosyncrasies. Harry looks cleaned up, his hair short and clean, his salt and pepper beard trimmed nearly to stubble. He's even gotten new glasses. </p>
<p>For a moment, Harry is just taking in the sheer breadth of the expanded garden, and it doesn't hurt; Harry left long before it got this big. Draco can pretend Harry is just surprised to come home to a garden the size of an Olympic pool. </p>
<p>Harry's eyes light on Draco, and there's none of the malice Draco when he first found Harry. "There you are," Harry says. His mouth does not smile. He doesn't frown, either, though. </p>
<p>Draco is mute as he gets to his feet, never taking his eyes off Harry. It's his heart wedged in his throat that silences him, just shy of choking him. </p>
<p>"I thought—" Harry clears his throat, and takes a seat on the garden bench against the side of the house. "Hermione said you'd be here." </p>
<p>"Well, it's our house." Draco doesn't bother correcting himself. It'll always be Harry's house. "Where is Hermione?" </p>
<p>"At work, I reckon. She, er, doesn't know I'm here. Not Ron, either." Harry's eyes land on the flowers around Draco's legs. "Are those lilies?" He looks up, meeting Draco's gaze. </p>
<p>"For your mother," Draco says, as neutrally as he can, and is rewarded with Harry's brief smile. </p>
<p>"She would have liked that, I bet." Harry leans forward, elbows on his knees. "I suppose you know I've finished my Legilimency healing sessions with Hermione." </p>
<p>Draco swallows. "I haven't heard from her." </p>
<p>The silence that follows feels like the pressure of the deepest oceans, pressing on Draco harder with every passing second. </p>
<p>"I think," Harry says, looking out over the garden and all its happy, healthy plants, "that I am satisfied with my healing." </p>
<p>Draco's ears are filled with the heavy sound of the blood rushing away from his face. "What?" </p>
<p>"I thought I should be the one to tell you. It's only decent." Harry scratches his nose, as though he hasn't just delivered the latest worst news of Draco's life. "That's probably why Hermione hasn't contacted you." </p>
<p>"Tell me what, exactly?" Draco's voice says from somewhere outside his body. </p>
<p>Harry pauses, his gaze faltering as he looks at Draco. "I feel caught up enough. I know who I am. I'm—I'm thirty-eight, I'm gay, I'm an accomplished Auror; I'm godfather to both of Ron and Hermione's children." </p>
<p>"You're my husband." It comes out before Draco can stop himself, and just as he looks at Harry's hands. </p>
<p>A tan line on his left ring finger. Bare, pale brown. </p>
<p>"I'd like for us to be friends, Malfoy." Harry says it so casually. </p>
<p><i>Friends.</i> </p>
<p>"What have you done with your ring?" Draco asks it through lips that feel thick and unfeeling, much like his fingers, much like his chest, his soul peeling away from his corporeal form as he considers all the ways Harry might not have cared what the ring meant. </p>
<p>"Oh! Here. Ron said I ought to give it to you." Harry fishes in the pocket of his jeans, and pulls out the wedding ring with its crossed boughs. He holds it out in the flat of his hand. "I think he's right." </p>
<p>Where Draco had just felt nothing, now he burns, staring at the etched metal cradled in the valley of Harry's palm. "I don't want it." He doesn't want this final, physical evidence that his marriage is over. </p>
<p>"Malfoy." </p>
<p>"For fuck's sake, Harry, at least call me by my name while you're rejecting me!" Draco spits, before whipping around to hide his face from Harry. He doesn't <i>want</i> to cry right now. </p>
<p>"I'm not—Draco, I'm not rejecting you. I'm not in a relationship with you." Harry's voice is so plaintive. He says Draco's name like he has to force it across his tongue. </p>
<p>Draco spins back to face him. "Five years, Harry. Five long, <i>torturous</i> years of being the only person who always believed you were alive, even when I had to pick out your <i>casket</i>." He stalks up to Harry, who's standing now, the hand that was holding the ring now a fist clenched to his chest. "Didn't you see any of that? With Ron, or Hermione? Didn't you see, Harry, how hard I worked to get you back?" </p>
<p>But Harry's eyes are cold, and he takes a step back, away from the bench and closer to the door. "I don't owe you my feelings, Malfoy." </p>
<p>And that's it. There's nothing Draco can say to that, because it's true. He falls to his knees at the edges of the garden, his chest full of the weight of Harry's rejection. </p>
<p>"I did see," Harry says, a bit kinder now, "that you've become a good man, in all this time. Molly loves you, you know, and that's no small thing. And this garden is—Malfoy, it's wonderful." </p>
<p>Draco says nothing, his upper body sinking down against his thighs amid the wild grass he lets fence the garden. </p>
<p>"It's not that I don't believe you, you know." Harry's voice grows softer still, and closer. "I understand we were married. I understand it was you who found me after everyone gave me up for dead, and I'm grateful." Draco sees two denim-clad knees as Harry kneels in front of him, but still he won't look up. "But even with everything I saw with Ron and Hermione's help—I just don't feel that way about you." A pause. "I don't hate you, Draco. I want to be friends." </p>
<p>"Don't," Draco whispers. "That's not fair." </p>
<p>"Maybe you're right." Harry sighs. "Maybe it isn't fair to you. It just doesn't seem fair to shut you out, either." </p>
<p>"I would rather die," Draco says, straightening just enough to look Harry in the eye. "I would rather <i>die</i> than be just your friend, Harry." </p>
<p>Harry has the audacity to look insulted. "I'm trying to give you an olive branch, here!" </p>
<p>"I don't fucking want it!" Draco shouts right back. "I don't want any fucking branches, I've got enough of them in the bloody <i>orchard</i> I planted while I was waiting for my <i>husband</i> to come back to me! That's what I want, Harry! <i>I want my husband back!"</i> </p>
<p>"I don't know what to tell you." Harry's green eyes are stormy with anger as he rises. "I'm trying to do what's kindest, because I've been reassured you deserve it, but maybe you don't." Harry turns to leave. </p>
<p>The photo album. The memory of it comes back to Draco in a sudden rush, and he throws himself into a run to catch Harry by the elbow. "Wait, Harry—!" </p>
<p>"What?" Harry stops, at least, though he pulls his elbow away. </p>
<p>"I—" Draco has to say this clearly. "I made a photo album. So you could see." </p>
<p>"A photo album?" Draco's heart soars at Harry's curious frown. </p>
<p>"Yes! Hermione told me to make it, and I—" </p>
<p>Harry sighs, cutting Draco off. "I don't want to see it." </p>
<p>"Just look at it." Draco reaches for Harry's arm again. "Please, Harry." </p>
<p>"I'm just—I'm not interested," Harry says, keeping his arm tight to his side. "Please don't ask me again." </p>
<p>"So—" Draco finds himself blinking rapidly, his tears returning fresh and painful. "You would rather have gaping holes in your memory than even entertain the <i>notion</i> of loving me?" </p>
<p>He realizes, as Harry's own pained realization flashes across his face, that he hadn't even mentioned the word <i>love</i> up to this point. </p>
<p>"I'm sorry," Harry says, and he puts his hand on the door knob of the back door. "I'm going to go now." </p>
<p>"Harry," Draco pleads, the name riding a hiccup. </p>
<p>"There'll be a big dinner at the Burrow at the end of this week," Harry adds, looking the most contrite he has since arriving to Draco's garden. "Goodbye." </p>
<p>And he leaves, the door clicking softly behind him. </p>
<p>Draco lies back down in the lilies to sob, wishing all the more fervently for death.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>⚘</p>
</center>The day of the dinner at the Burrow comes and goes like any other of Draco's days after Harry's visit.<p>He wakes, stays on the sofa until he wakes again, considers making tea, and doesn't wake for a third time until mid-afternoon. Then he sits up, casts his eyes listlessly over the latest edition of the Prophet without taking anything in for not quite an hour, and lies back down for another fitful bout of sleep. He retrieves a box of almond biscuits or rye crackers from the kitchen in the dead of night, and falls asleep in the process of eating it amid all the bedclothes that make his nest. </p>
<p>The photo album on the kitchen table gleams in the moonlight, mocking Draco on his midnight snack runs. He does not touch it. </p>
<p>Draco told Harry he would rather die than live a life without his marriage to Harry, but he doesn't have the courage to act on those words, even when he found Harry's ring on the kitchen table by the photo album after Harry left. He knows, too, that his garden is suffering, that the green living things outside don't deserve to languish the way he is, but it's another rainy summer in Britain; Draco convinces himself they don't need him after all, not now. </p>
<p>He does, at least, stop crying quite so much after the first three days. </p>
<p>What is he meant to do with his life now? There's no more widower support money coming from the Ministry anymore, now that Harry is alive and well and likely returning to work. The thought of working—of leaving the cottage, of being around other people, of trying to focus on <i>anything</i>—is so overwhelming Draco can only force himself back to sleep in the face of it. </p>
<p>He wonders if Harry will serve him divorce papers, now that his death certificate has been rescinded. One piece of parchment for another. </p>
<p>The banging on his door, a week after the Burrow dinner he did not attend, seems to have several sources. When Draco listens—ah, yes. Ron, Hermione, Blaise, Pansy. Pansy and Blaise are shouting abuses about how Draco must be smelling up the cottage after staying inside it for so long, Ron joins in with them, and Hermione tries a more peaceful tack by shouting that they just want to know he's okay over the din of the other three. </p>
<p>Draco doesn't answer, watching the door from the sofa with dull eyes. Harry had said Ron had told him to give the ring back. Probably the whole lot of them side with Harry, and Draco slides down further into his nest when he realizes he's pitting himself against Harry. And losing. </p>
<p>He bets Pansy would tell him he's being melodramatic, a Victorian lady tossing herself from fainting couch to fainting couch. Blaise would say Draco isn't dressed well enough for the case of the vapors he so clearly has, which might be true, given Draco has been wearing Harry's ragged Kenmare Kestrels T-shirt every day since Harry's rejection. Hermione would very reasonably ask Draco to come out of the house because they're not going to throw him aside just because he's single again, but can't he respect Harry's feelings? And Ron—well, sod Ron and whatever he has to say. </p>
<p>"I'll get it," Hermione's voice says, and Draco can <i>feel</i> her powerful, methodical magic deconstructing his wards. </p>
<p>He doesn't want to hear all the things he imagined they would say. Draco fishes his wand out from between the cushions of the sofa and rebuilds his wards wherever Hermione has taken pieces of them down, leaving her with a regenerating puzzle. </p>
<p>Hermione curses, and shouts, "Stop that, Draco!" to no avail. Draco continues to fill in the gaps she's created, without responding to a word she's said. </p>
<p>Ron's deep voice murmurs something unintelligible; Hermione sighs, deep and exasperated, and then suddenly there is no more of Hermione's assault on the cottage wards. Then there are no more of Draco's friends, or perhaps ex-friends, lurking at the front door. </p>
<p>There might have been more knocking on his door at some point. Draco might have also dreamed it. There's little difference, these days, between Draco's wakeful hours and his time spent asleep; a fugue state that renders time meaningless. Draco does, at least, have enough of himself left to scoff at the pathetic mess he's become, dehydrated and listless while burrowed into a sweaty duvet and a ragged shirt that has lost all of its Harry scent. </p>
<p>He could Obliviate himself. </p>
<p>The thought comes to Draco during one of his many self-flagellations for his inability to follow through and die, just as he'd told Harry he'd rather do. Yes, Draco could Obliviate himself; he could be like Harry had been all this time, possessed of no more than his childhood memories, relieved of the pain of losing his husband over and over again. Free of his broken heart. Draco finds his wand where it's rolled under the sofa, runs his fingers up and down the polished ruddy wood. </p>
<p>It's such a simple incantation. A single word that robbed Harry of years of his life; the Mediwizards at St. Mungos admitted Harry would likely never remember who cursed him, even with a full Legilimency healing. And yes, Draco believes he's powerful enough to pull off a memory charm of the magnitude and precision required. He could Obliviate himself. </p>
<p>The problem is that Draco as he is now absolutely hates Draco as he was, before he met Harry all over again. Before Harry, before Ron and Hermione accepting him as well, before regular dinners at the Burrow. Molly Weasley giving Draco a bone-crushing hug of induction into the family was transformative. Without them, Draco would have never grown to be the man he's become, worthy of the love of good people. </p>
<p>Draco closes his eyes, thinking of that hug from Molly. He thinks of Ron and Hermione standing in his wedding—no. He thinks of Hermione, wary and tired, holding months-old baby Hugo out to him. He thinks of the warm, fragile weight of Hugo in his hands, Ron's held breath as Draco cradles Hugo to his chest and falls in love with the sensation. That had been the moment when they'd first started to let him in. </p>
<p>"<i>Expecto Patronum,</i>" Draco breathes. </p>
<p>His wand glows silver, but nothing escapes it. </p>
<p>"<i>Expecto Patronum,</i>" Draco says again, shakily. </p>
<p>Harry had been in the room when Draco had first held Hugo. He hadn't fallen in love with holding an infant all by himself; no, Harry had been next to him, arm held around Draco's waist to anchor him in the sea of Ron and Hermione's doubt. Harry had been there when Molly had embraced him. Harry had never missed a Burrow gathering. Whatever happy moment Draco tries to summon, that he might send a message to his friends that he's sorry, that he doesn't want to push them away anymore, Harry is always there, infecting the memory with pain and sadness. </p>
<p>Draco puts down his wand. He goes back to sleep to escape the awfulness of being conscious, and even when he wakes, he ignores the pangs of hunger urging him to get up, the dry mouth begging to be quenched. It's only the threat of pissing himself that gets him out of his nest when his bladder gets insistent enough. </p>
<p>It only hurts for a moment when he collapses to the floor on the way back to the sofa.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>⚘</p>
</center>When Draco comes to, it takes him a moment to realize he's not curled into the rank duvet on the sofa. No, he's laid out flat on his back, musty bedclothes that haven't been aired in weeks pulled up to his chest. Musty, but clean.<p>He's upstairs. </p>
<p>It's that realization that pushes him the rest of the way awake, because he has no memory of climbing the stairs, much less into his marriage bed. The bedroom is full of light from curtains that have been pulled back, there are murmuring voices coming from downstairs, and most alarmingly of all, Harry is sitting in the far corner, on the chair where he used to pile his clean laundry rather than fold it in a timely manner. </p>
<p>Draco struggles to sit upright, feeling as though his energy's been drained away. "What's happened?" he wants to know. "What are you doing here?" </p>
<p>"It's my house, I've been told," Harry says delicately, to his hands clasped in his lap. </p>
<p>Draco wants to tell Harry to get out. He wants to tell Harry it'll always be his house. He says nothing. </p>
<p>"Hermione is downstairs, with Pansy," Harry continues. "She, er, set up an alarm in your wards, she said. When she was trying to take them down." </p>
<p>"Clever as always," Draco mutters, letting himself fall back against the pillows. "So I have a bit of a stumble in my own home and that gives my friends the right to break in with my ex-husband, does it?" </p>
<p>Harry frowns. "You're not well, Malfoy." He clears his throat. "Draco." </p>
<p>"Piss off. I'm fine, or I <i>was</i> before I had to look at you first thing in the bloody morning." Draco throws back the covers to find he's at least still dressed in his disgusting T-shirt, with nothing to cover his arse but a pair of briefs. He apparently hasn't got any dignity left anyway, so he plants his feet on the floor and makes an attempt to stand. He falls right back onto the mattress, his legs infuriatingly shaky. </p>
<p>"Hermione says you're dehydrated and need to eat." Harry points at the nightstand, where Draco now sees there's a glass of water and a lopsided sandwich that looks like Harry made it. </p>
<p>"Why doesn't Hermione come tell me that herself, then? Since it sounds like she's in my house and all." Draco slaps one of his thighs for having the audacity to not let him escape this room. "Go and get her, and then don't come back, how about that?" </p>
<p>"Draco." </p>
<p>"I want to <i>die</i> when I look at you," Draco snaps, "only I thought about the follow through on that for the past—however long it's been, I don't know, who cares—and I couldn't do it, so I suppose the truth is I want to cry for ages and wear your horrid Quidditch shirts when I look at you." He glances at Harry, who looks properly stricken, at least. "And look! I haven't got any tears in my head at the moment, but give me a bit with this," at which Draco holds up the glass of water, "and I'll have some ready. Cheers, Potter!" He takes a big, dramatic gulp of the flat, room-temperature water and sticks his tongue out. </p>
<p>"Draco." Harry says it a little louder this time. </p>
<p>"<i>What?"</i> Draco twists to look at Harry full-on, and nearly falls over. </p>
<p>Harry holds up the photo album, big and green and heavy. Draco doesn't know how he missed it. "I thought—you might show me this." </p>
<p>Draco stares at the album, his breath caught. "You've got it right there. What do you need me for?" </p>
<p>Harry purses his lips, glancing away as he sets the album down on his lap. "When you found me on that island, the only memories I had of you were terrible. You were not a good person when we were children." </p>
<p>"I know," Draco agrees, sober and quiet. </p>
<p>"And—even after everything Ron and Hermione showed me in our sessions, the vast majority of my memories of you continued to be those awful ones. Weighing all of those against being <i>told</i> we're married—it just didn't add up for me." </p>
<p>"Stop," Draco says, holding up a hand as he turns back to face the nightstand. "Just—stop." </p>
<p>"I just want you to understand." Harry's chair creaks, and then so do the floorboards as Harry crosses the room. The mattress dips beside Draco as Harry sits next to him, still holding the photo album, and Draco leans away. There's that feeling of wanting to die, again, or at least wanting to cease existing. Harry's so close, and he still remembers so vividly what it was to bury himself in Harry's arms, pillow himself against Harry's chest. </p>
<p>"I wish you would leave me alone," Draco says, closing his burning eyes. He's still too dehydrated to cry properly, but it doesn't mean his body won't try. "This is—this is torture, Harry, please—" </p>
<p>Harry takes one of Draco's hands, his fingers terrible brands against Draco's skin, and puts it on the cover of the album. "I just didn't realize, before now," Harry says, so soft it's almost a whisper, "how serious this is for you, and I should have." </p>
<p>Draco's eyes focus, at last, as he looks out the window. "My garden is dying," he whimpers. </p>
<p>"It's been a few weeks," Harry says, "since my last visit. Draco, look at me." And though it hurts to tear his eyes away from the wasteland that is his garden, Draco obeys. </p>
<p>"I'm not saying that my feelings have changed, necessarily," Harry says, with arched eyebrows and a slow, careful cadence. "I just also realize how important this is for you, and—it's only fair to give you a chance. To show me what we had." He nods at the album. "Please?" </p>
<p>Draco hesitates, but only once. He opens the photo album to spread it across both their laps.</p>
