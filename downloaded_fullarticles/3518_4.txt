    <p>Charlie pushed the luggage cart forward, past the overwhelming family scene.</p>
<p>“We'll be fine, Mum.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, stop fussing.”</p>
<p>“We're not scared of going off to school.”</p>
<p>“More like Hogwarts should be scared of them,” Bill muttered as he and Charlie dragged their trunks past their family over to the train.</p>
<p>Charlie glanced over at Fred and George, trying to say a hasty goodbye to their parents as their youngest siblings, Ron and Ginny looked longingly at the train. He and Bill had already said their more dignified goodbyes, hoping to escape the inevitable scene when their parents packed the twins off onto the Hogwarts Express for the first time. Percy was hovering nearby, looking uncomfortable. Charlie knew he'd already spotted Penny Clearwater, a Ravenclaw who had once tried to explain at length how they were breaking some school rule or other during his first year as a prefect. Percy had looked besotted. Charlie had told her to shut her gob or he'd dock points from Ravenclaw.</p>
<p>“Charlie!”</p>
<p>He turned and saw Leonidas Heath, another sixth year Gryffindor, dashing forward. They hadn't seen each other since the end of term and Charlie was pretty sure Leo had grown another two inches. He smiled his slightly off center grin at Charlie and Charlie felt a rush of confused emotions surge forward again. He had been almost glad his best mate had gone away for the whole summer, so he could stop feeling whatever this was that he felt whenever Leo gave him that smile.</p>
<p>Leo clapped Charlie on the back and grabbed hold of the other end of Charlie's battered trunk. “Already loaded mine,” he said. “Wait'll I tell you about the kongamato we saw on our safari. Better than a dragon, Charlie.”</p>
<p>“Go on. Nothing's better than dragons.”</p>
<p>“But you've never even seen any of these African creatures. I've got photos. You won't believe it.”</p>
<p>Charlie tried not to be jealous. Leo's family had a fortune made selling specially charmed clothing and Leo, always in durable, nice clothes, got decent vacations and lavish presents every Christmas. At least he hadn't said anything about Charlie's old trunk. It had belonged to a great-uncle and now sported a hole on one end. If it weren't for Leo, Charlie didn't think he'd even have noticed that sort of thing, but being around Leo made it hard sometimes.</p>
<p>“You going to leave Heath on as keeper?” Bill asked once they had settled Charlie's trunk and headed to the front car for the prefects meeting.</p>
<p>“What'd'you mean?” Charlie asked.</p>
<p>“Oh come on,” his brother said. “You're quidditch captain now. Don't let your mates on the team if they don't deserve it.”</p>
<p>“He's not bad.”</p>
<p>“He's not good either,” Bill muttered.</p>
<p>Just then, they felt the lurch of the train beginning to move. Several younger students suddenly poured out of one of the cars into the corridor, clutching their noses and moaning about the smell. Charlie spied the twins looking guilty at the far end of the corridor, stuck partially in the traffic jam.</p>
<p>He and Bill cuffed the two of them and dragged them forward. It was easy enough. Charlie could tell Fred and George were destined to be tall like Bill and Percy, but they hadn't hit their growth spurts yet. They were barely eleven and still small enough to control. Hopefully he'd be graduated by the time they really became too much trouble to take care of.</p>
<p>“Dung bombs?” Bill said disdainfully as soon as they got the two of them into a mostly empty car.</p>
<p>“S'not our fault!” George said.</p>
<p>“It's not even creative,” Charlie said.</p>
<p>“We didn't set 'em off!” Fred said. “Some third year was on about there being too many Weasleys.”</p>
<p>“All I did was invite him to open my case, and...” George started.</p>
<p>“Enough,” Bill said. “We have to get to the front car. I'm head boy this year so you need to keep your noses at least mildly clean or I'll have to dock points from you before you can even be sorted into your houses.”</p>
<p>“Aw, come off it, Bill,” Fred said.</p>
<p>“You know we're going to be perfect additions to Gryffindor,” George added.</p>
<p>“They're going to make me mental before the year's out,” Charlie predicted as they left the twins behind.</p>
<p>Several Hufflepuff girls with heavy makeup charms passed them and one giggled at Bill, pointing at him and raising her eyebrows to her friends. Charlie rolled his eyes. His brother was too popular for his own good.</p>
<p>In the front compartment, it was much the same. The prefect girls all twittered over Bill as he made his announcements about starting the year right and everyone's duties. Even Idara Smith, a new fifth year Gryffindor prefect who Charlie had always thought was more sensible than that, seemed to be trying to cozy up to him in order to get at his brother.</p>
<p>When Bill instructed everyone to walk the length of the train and make sure there was no mischief before settling back in, Idara said, “Maybe you could patrol with me and show me how it's done, Charlie.” When Charlie glanced at Bill, she added, “Bill too.”</p>
<p>“Uh, you'll do fine,” Charlie said, putting her off. She practically pouted and pushed her long, braided hair out of her face with a sigh as she ended up leaving with one of the new Ravenclaw prefects instead.</p>
<p>Bill seemed to have watched the exchange with amusement, which was all he needed to have his brother rib him about a fifth year.</p>
<p>The car had mostly cleared out and Charlie was thinking about skipping the patrol; it wasn't as if there weren't plenty of prefects all being attentive already. That's when he heard a distant buzzing like music and, on impulse, walked into the corridor.</p>
<p>He got to watch it as it moved through the whole corridor, obviously disrupting the train compartments as it went as well. At the far end, it was like an echo of music and a strange commotion but by the time it reached the students in front of him, a group of younger boys, it was obvious what was happening. The boys, looking deeply shaken and embarrassed, suddenly began to dance, their hands flying out in front of them, their feet lightly tapping, their bodies swaying. And then it had moved to Charlie, who could suddenly hear the music at full volume. It was louder than he anticipated, and surely muggle from the heavy drum beats. He had only ever heard things like it from the muggle born students.</p>
<p>Then, just as quickly, it had moved off him, the music becoming an echo again and the people in the head compartment beginning the dance. Charlie watched through the window as Bill and the remaining prefects began dancing to the music. When it reached Bill and Mira, the new Head Girl, they seemed to dance for even longer. Bill's face looked furious.</p>
<p>Charlie managed to get himself back in the compartment, but by the time he'd gotten there, the magic had started a trip back in the other direction, now heading to the back of the compartment. It was like the wave at a quidditch match. Each person danced for just a scant few seconds in turn, the music and forced dancing moving through the compartments in order. It must have been incredibly complex magic.</p>
<p>“Godric's gonads!” Bill swore, much to the amusement of everyone left. Bill was relaxed about language, but not usually one to swear himself and they all knew it.</p>
<p>“What jinx would you use for that?” a Ravenclaw prefect asked.</p>
<p>“More complex magic than a jinx,” her friend responded.</p>
<p>Charlie, though still reeling from it, was almost amused. What a complex prank to start the year. However, as Bill approached him, he could see that his brother was livid. He followed Charlie through the corridors and peeking into compartments as he questioned people. At least the jinx, or the prank, or whatever it was, seemed over.</p>
<p>Just before they reached the final compartment, the twins reappeared. This time they were filled with questions.</p>
<p>“Who did that?”</p>
<p>“Can we meet them?”</p>
<p>“Worship at their feet perhaps?”</p>
<p>“Ask them to teach us everything they know?”</p>
<p>“Offer ourselves up in service?”</p>
<p>“Be quiet,” Bill snapped as they opened the door to the final compartment. Inside, they found the original group of Hufflepuff girls with overdone makeup charms, all of them laughing loudly. One girl was nearly bent over from her giggles.</p>
<p>Charlie was ready to leave them, but Bill was immediately suspicious and the twins seemed to think the answer was in here with the Hufflepuffs as well. He knew it was only because his brother was so new at being Head Boy. Bill was generally pretty relaxed but it wasn't a great way to start his tenure. As he questioned the girls, Charlie turned to go.</p>
<p>That's when he saw that there was someone else in the compartment. He looked young, perhaps a fourth year, with yellow blond hair and pale skin, still wearing muggle jeans and a green T-shirt. He had been hovering near the door and hurried off when Charlie turned to leave, letting the compartment door slam behind him.</p>
<p>Charlie hurried after him, but when he got to the corridor, he could only see one person. Nymphadora Tonks was calmly headed into the next train, her blue hair a shock of brightness over her half slung on robes. That hair was unmistakeable. She only got away with it because she was a metamorphmagus. When other students put hair color or elaborate makeup charms on, the heads of houses were supposed to tell them to take them off or dock points. Tonks played keeper for the Hufflepuff team and he'd already heard a rumor that she was made captain over the summer like him. He was looking forward to beating her. She had mocked him for failing to catch the snitch in a miserable game against Slytherin at the end of the previous year.</p>
<p>Charlie hurried to catch up with her as she went through to the next car. In the corridor, the trolley witch was slowly making her rounds.</p>
<p>“Oi, Tonks!” he called, thinking to ask her if she'd seen the blond boy.</p>
<p>She turned and grinned at him.</p>
<p>“Yeah, Weasley?”</p>
<p>For a moment, he looked at her. Something seemed wrong, but he couldn't say exactly what. Then Bill had caught up with him as well and was standing behind him.</p>
<p>“Did you see something?” Bill asked.</p>
<p>“Oh,” Charlie said, not really wanting to encourage his brother's zeal for catching the culprits too much. “Nah.”</p>
<p>“Me neither.” Bill rolled his eyes.</p>
<p>“Are you talking about the dancing prank?” Tonks asked. “Everyone looked pretty funny.”</p>
<p>Charlie nodded.</p>
<p>“Humiliating for some students,” Bill said. “I'm sure there are first years who are upset.”</p>
<p>The train shook and they each gripped the wall to steady themselves. “Did you want something, Weasley?” Tonks asked, looking right at Charlie.</p>
<p>“Oh, nah. Sorry. We should get back to the front, right, Bill?”</p>
<p>Bill nodded. He gave Tonks a sour look and Charlie remembered then that his brother had never much liked her. She really could be a nasty player at quidditch to have drawn Bill's ire. “Come on.”</p>
<p>“See you on the pitch, Weasley,” Tonks said, sounded self-assured and a little devious.</p>
<p>It was not until they had walked away that Charlie realized she had been wearing a green T-shirt and jeans under her robes, which weren't even all the way on. She was a metamorph, but could she pull off looking that much like a completely different person? She had looked just like a boy.</p>
<p>“… suppose it wasn't the worst prank ever,” Bill was saying as they reached the front compartment again. “Plus, Olivia Brown asked what my plans were for the first Hogsmeade weekend.”</p>
<p>“Oh,” Charlie said, trying to remember which of the Hufflepuff girls was called Olivia and coming up blank. They were all a little bit the same, that group of older Hufflepuff girls. He couldn't keep them straight.</p>
<p>“Hey, I saw Smith cozying up to you earlier. You should ask her out.”</p>
<p>“Who, Idara? Nah, I think she might like someone else.”</p>
<p>“Do you have eyes, man? She was clearly in for you.” Bill knocked him jovially on his arm as they opened the mostly empty compartment. “Ask her. We'll double.”</p>
<p>Charlie thought about Idara and her long braids, red lips, and smooth, dark skin. She was all right, he supposed. She could fly a broom decently and she treated her owl well. He always noticed how people took care of their pets. That was a mark in her favor. He didn't mind Idara, but he couldn't imagine asking her to Hogsmeade.</p>
<p>“Nah.”</p>
<p>“Come on,” Bill said. “You ended it with that Ravenclaw girl too fast last year. Have a little fun.” Charlie had only ever gone out with the Ravenclaw girl because Leo had a thing for her best friend.</p>
<p>“If you're scared, I'll do it for you,” Bill said. Then, his eyes brightening, he said, “In fact, that's just what I'll do.”</p>
<p>Charlie didn't like when Bill had that look. He could be too determined sometimes. “Don't, Bill,” he pleaded. “It wouldn't work out.”</p>
<p>“Why? Oh ho, you have a crush on someone else!” Bill exclaimed. “Who is it? Come on then, spill.”</p>
<p>Leo's dark hair and pale face flashed in Charlie's mind for the fraction of a second it took for him to push it back down. “No one,” he said.</p>
<p>“Oh no, I see that blush,” Bill said. “Tell me.”</p>
<p>He wouldn't let it go, Charlie was sure. He knew how tenacious Bill could be about everything. And how enthusiastic. What he needed was someone Bill was sure to leave alone. “Dora,” he said suddenly. Immediately, he wished he could shove it back in.</p>
<p>“Dora who? Who is that?” Then the knowledge bloomed on his brother's face. “Tonks, you mean? You must be starkers. No, I take that back, I already knew you were starkers, this just confirms it.” Bill laughed. “Good luck with that, brother. No way am I getting involved there!”</p>
<p>Charlie let out a sigh of relief. Bill looked like he was about to say something more, probably to tease him, but then Leo's face appeared at the compartment door and Charlie's best mate was there smiling, distracting them both from Nymphadora Tonks.</p>
<p>“We're halfway to school and you still haven't come see my photos. Come on, you knob,” Leo said. “You're going to love all the creatures we saw.”</p>
<p>Charlie shrugged at his brother, who rolled his eyes with affection. “Yeah, coming,” he said to Leo, and followed him out of the compartment to wherever Leo had his own things waiting.</p>
