    <p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>“A top class report, Granger. Well done.”</span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>Hermione smiled politely at the compliment from Mr Entwistle, her boss, but in truth she felt no great satisfaction in the review she’d compiled on Hinkypunk activity in East Anglia. It </span>
  <span>was</span>
  <span> a very thorough yet succinct report and she knew that the praise was deserved, but her lack of pride came from the simplicity of the task. “Thank you, sir. I expect to have the recommendations for ghoul interaction to be on your desk before the end of the day.” With a brief nod of the head she left her boss’s office and walked the familiar path through the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures to her cubicle.</span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>Ron always scoffed whenever he saw her work space due to its pristine condition, but she had much the same reaction when she got a glimpse at how untidy </span>
  <span>his</span>
  <span> cubicle was in the Auror department. She and Ron were very different personalities and she liked that. Of course, there were times when they would drive each other up the wall and they had actually broken up three times over the last two years, but Hermione couldn’t imagine anyone else she’d rather have at her side. </span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>She pulled her ‘ghouls’ folder out from her desk and reread her notes and interview transcripts in order to prepare her recommendations. </span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>A shout of alarm from a corridor outside made Hermione react instinctively: grabbing her wand from her desk, she rose quickly and hurried to the open door but kept out of the sight. Carefully, she inched forwards to look around the doorframe to see what the commotion was about. A cloaked figure was running quickly away from her, while another person lay, unmoving, on the floor. Wordlessly, she sent a stunning spell at the fleeing figure and watched with satisfaction as it made contact, making them crumple to the ground. Hermione trotted briskly over to check that the runaway was truly unconscious, and conjured ropes to tightly bind their hands and feet just to make sure they wouldn’t escape. </span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>A door at the head of the corridor opened and Hermione felt her eyes widen in surprise as the Minister for Magic, Kingsley Shacklebolt, walked towards her. He didn’t pay the two figures on the floor the slightest glance but looked at her with an unreadable expression. </span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>“Come with me, Hermione,” he said calmly, holding out a hand to pull her from her crouched position. He didn’t wait to hear a response once she was standing upright, but instead walked back to the door he had exited. </span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>“But, Minister, these people?” she asked in confusion, looking at the two prone figures. Why wasn’t Kingsley concerned about a supposed attack in the corridors of his Ministry? </span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>“Everything is under control, don’t worry,” Kingsley’s deep voice soothed, not pausing in his step.</span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal"><span>“But,” Hermione tried again, walking hurriedly after him with a few further glances over her shoulder.</span> </p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>“I will explain all to you in a few minutes, Hermione,” Kingsley assured her, opening the door and indicating that she should enter. She acquiesced even though her mind was buzzing with dozens of questions. </span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>The room she entered was little more than a broom cupboard and, despite being a member of her Department for nearly a year, she could’ve sworn that there’d never even been a room here. But, of course, that was entirely possible.</span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>Kingsley motioned for her to take a seat at a rather minute table but Hermione was far too worked up for that. The door shut behind him with a much louder and deeper click than she had expected and Kingsley waved his wand around the room a few times. Hermione assumed he did so to make the space even more secure than it already was. Kingsley settled himself comfortably into one of the plain wooden chairs before finally turning to a bewildered Hermione.</span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>“So, Hermione, how are you enjoying your work here at the Ministry?” he asked, lacing his fingers together in his lap. </span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>Hermione tilted her head slightly, not sure that she had heard the Minister correctly. “I’m sorry. I just stunned a hooded assailant a few yards away from where we’re standing and you want to chat about goblin regulations?!” </span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>Kingsley lips twitched slightly. “Not exactly. I want to talk about you.”</span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>Hermione had to force herself to remember that she was talking to the Minister for Magic, the most important man in Wizarding Britain. No matter how confusing he was being right now, she would still show him the respect that his title deserved. She tried to calm her thoughts and emotions down, and focused on being a professional employee. “What exactly did you want to discuss, Minister?”</span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>“As I said, how are you enjoying your work here?” he repeated.</span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>Hermione lightly chewed the inside of her cheek as she considered what to say. “I have been given the opportunity to become familiar with the workings of a very well-organised department,” she began but Kingsley shook his head.</span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>“That’s not what I asked,” he pointed out. “How are you </span>
  <em>
    <span>enjoying</span>
  </em>
  <span> your work?”</span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>Hermione flushed at his interruption. “I’m very grateful to Mr Entwistle for giving me a position in his department and I’m thankful that he’s promised to let me explore my campaign for house-elf rights,” she explained and then paused. How honest should she be? Hermione didn’t like lying but she had done it on numerous occasions for the well-being of others. This wasn’t one of those occasions. It wasn’t as though she disliked her work in the Ministry; it was more that she didn’t </span>
  <span>like</span>
  <span> it either. </span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>Kingsley appeared to sense her thoughts for he chuckled lowly. “I thought as much. Don’t worry,” he added, holding up his hand to placate her. “As I’m sure you’ve guessed, this conversation is very much private. In fact, for all intents and purposes, it doesn’t exist.” </span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>“Is that why we’re not meeting in your office?” she asked, deciding that maybe it was time to take a seat after all.</span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>“Exactly,” Kingsley nodded. “There are far too many eyes on the first floor. Now, there’s something I’ve been wondering these last few months: why didn’t you apply to be an auror when the war ended?”</span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>“Finishing my education was incredibly important to me,” Hermione answered immediately. “There was no question of me seeking employment without obtaining my NEWTs.”</span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>“Yes, I understand. But what about after, when you had graduated?” he questioned. “Given your admirable war actions I thought you would make an exceptional auror.”</span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>Hermione grimaced slightly. “That’s kind of you to say but… Do you know what it was like to live every waking moment in absolute fear for the lives of those you loved?” Hermione shook her head. “I’m sorry. We all felt that way, I know, and others suffered far worse than I did. But, just because I may have been reasonably successful at fighting, it doesn’t mean that I want to do that full time. There’s more to me than just being one of Harry’s supporters.”</span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>“I’m definitely aware of that,” Kingsley responded with a smile.</span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>“I have aims of my own,” she continued. “Things that I’d like to achieve first.”</span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>“</span>
  <span>First</span>
  <span>?” Kingsley repeated, leaning forward slightly. “So a career in Law Enforcement is something you have in mind for the future?” </span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>“I-I,” Hermione stammered before letting out a frustrated sigh. “It’s all Harry’s fault. Being his friend meant that I became used to a certain lifestyle and now I miss that buzz,” she shook her head with a wry smile. “Oh, don’t get me wrong, of course I’m glad that innocent people aren’t suffering anymore and we’re not at war. It’s just that civilian life seems a bit…lacking, I suppose. It’s fine,” Hermione shrugged. “I’m just adapting.” </span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>“You certainly reacted quickly to the disturbance,” he commented, motioning back towards the door they’d entered. “Your fighting instincts are still right under the surface.”</span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>Hermione looked at Kingsley suspiciously. “That was a set-up, wasn’t it? You wanted to see how I’d respond.”</span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>“Yes.” </span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>“Why?”</span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>“I have a job offer for you,” Kingsley announced, lacing his fingers back together again.</span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>“And this is how you offer most people jobs, is it?” Hermione queried with a trace of sarcasm.</span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>“This is not </span>
  <span>most</span>
  <span> jobs,” he countered. “It is unique.”</span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>Hermione couldn’t deny that her curiosity was decidedly piqued. “Go on.”</span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>“How closely do you follow events in the muggle world?” </span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>She frowned, the question taking her by surprise. “I have a muggle newspaper delivered each morning with the </span>
  <span>Prophet</span>
  <span>. Oh, and I have a computer in my flat that’s connected to the internet but I don’t use it very often.” </span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>Kingsley nodded. “Good. Well, I suppose that it might not come as a surprise to you that during the course of The Second War a number of magical incidents were picked up on by a muggle intelligence agency.”</span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>Hermione shifted uncomfortably in her seat. That wasn’t good news. The last thing they wanted after finally defeating Voldemort was to have the muggles find out about them. </span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>“Ever since then they have been trying to get in contact with us but we have ignored all their attempts,” he continued.</span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>“What do they want?” she asked.</span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>“A liaison.” Kingsley paused to let the word hang in the air. </span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>“A liaison?” Hermione repeated in surprise. “You want me to talk to British intelligence?” </span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>“They’re not British,” he said. </span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>“What?” </span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>“Well, we don’t think so. In truth we know as much about them as they probably do about us. My man in muggle communications could find out very little and, in truth, I’d never heard of them despite my undercover work in muggle politics. They’re called S.H.I.E.L.D.” Kingsley reached into a pocket of his robes and withdrew a piece of paper emblazoned with a black and white logo. He passed it to Hermione. </span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>The main motif was that of a bird, and something about its powerful appearance brought the States to her mind. She read the words that outlined the motif aloud. “Strategic Homeland Intervention Enforcement Logistics Division. S.H.I.E.L.D. I get it. But, why do you want me to be their liaison? There must be numerous others who are more qualified for the job.” </span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>“I don’t really know what this job is going to entail,” Kingsley said, his voice graver than before. “They may have requested just a liaison, but I doubt things will be quite as simple when dealing with an intelligence agency. I need someone who can think on their feet, react to the situation at hand.”</span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>“Surely an auror would be better suited,” she pointed out.</span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>“Hermione, no one must know that we are cooperating with S.H.I.E.L.D. Can you imagine the outcry? If it was one of my aurors then the news would be more likely to filter out; they are law enforcement, not intelligence. It’s a different set of skills.” </span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>“And you think </span>
  <span>I</span>
  <span> possess those skills?” Hermione asked in disbelief. </span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>“You’re extremely intelligent, are familiar with muggle ways and demonstrate an admirable ability to think clearly under pressure. Take the incident at Malfoy Manor for example,” Kingsley explained. “Before the snatchers even arrived, you jinxed Harry to hide his identity and then, while undergoing torture from Bellatrix Lestrange, you managed to deceive her about the origins of Gryffindor’s sword.”</span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>Hermione shook her head. “I did what anyone would have done. I’m no one special.”</span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>“You helped orchestrate infiltrations of the Ministry and Gringotts.”</span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>“Yes, </span>
  <span>helped</span>
  <span>,” she insisted. “Harry and Ron were very vital parts of that.”</span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">“What about your escape from the Lovegood’s or your remarkably well-prepared bag? Remember, Hermione, I have read the official reports you three made on your war experiences. So believe me when I say you have the abilities to cope with whatever this post may throw at you,” Kingsley said firmly, leaning forward in his seat. “You do, of course, have the choice to turn down this offer. Your work with magical creatures will continue either way; this liaison role should only take a very small amount of your time. And, of course, it goes without saying that you will tell no one about this, not even your best friends.”</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>Hermione nodded. “I understand all that and I’m honestly very flattered that you think so highly of me.” She paused and Kingsley raised an eyebrow at her. “I just have one question: why now? Why after two years of them requesting a liaison have you finally agreed?”</span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>Kingsley chuckled lowly. “That is exactly the right question to ask.” He waved his wand and a paper file appeared on the table between them. He pushed the file towards her. “Use the index finger of your wand hand to trace your signature on the file to unlock it,” Kingsley commanded. “It’s sealed shut except for your eyes and mine.”</span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>Hermione did as instructed, eager to see what lay inside. A series of still photographs were the first things she noticed. They showed a face that had frequented the front page of her muggle newspaper the last few months.</span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>“You recognise him?” Kingsley asked as she looked through the other photos of him, some of which she knew to be taken within the last week.</span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>“Tony Stark, aka Iron Man,” she replied dryly. “A muggle technological genius who’s invented a metallic suit with capabilities the world has never seen before.” She looked at one of the recent photos of the Iron Man suit taken at the Stark Expo at Flushing Meadows. “From what I read in the papers it seems like various muggles have tried to replicate his invention, which resulted in a mass drone attack in New York a few days ago.” She eyed the Iron Man-inspired robots in the photos with distaste. “And this has to do with S.H.I.E.L.D?”</span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>“Given the nature of their agency it is a reasonable assumption that they have connections with Stark,” Kinglsey pointed out. “Keep looking.” Hermione turned to the next part of the file. “Your muggle newspaper from this morning wouldn’t have been recent enough to inform you of what happened in Harlem last night.” </span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>Hermione raised her eyebrows. “New York again? Sounds like a city to avoid if you ask me,” she muttered, bringing another set of photos to her gaze. These were of a lesser quality, which was understandable if the incident they showed only happened a few hours ago. Hermione could make out two abnormally large figures of an extremely muscular build: one white, one green. “Um, Minister, who, er, </span>
  <em>
    <span>what</span>
  </em>
  <span> are these?” </span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>“We’re not entirely sure, to be honest,” he admitted, looking gravely at the destruction the two creatures had left behind them. “But we believe them to be muggles that took part in scientific experiments that went wrong.”</span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>Hermione gasped. “Have they been stopped?”</span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>“You could say that,” Kingsley replied. “The white coloured one is in the custody of muggle authorities but the green one has escaped.” </span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>“Excellent,” she sighed sarcastically. “I’m almost scared to look in the third part of this folder.”</span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">“This one is a little…different,” Kingsley warned as Hermione took the third set of photos. “A wizard in the States had noticed extremely strange atmospheric disturbances two or three days ago and headed to their source in New Mexico. Our counterparts over the pond sent us his statement and the photos he took of what he found.”</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>“What are these muggles </span>
  <span>wearing</span>
  <span>?” Hermione asked, seeing a photo of four men and a woman in clothes that were certainly not your usual muggle attire. They were wearing leather and metal armour, capes and carried weapons. “Those are pretty elaborate costumes.” Kingsley said nothing as Hermione continued to peruse the photos. “That’s a big hammer. Dressed like that he almost reminds me of…” Hermione’s voice faded away when she looked at the next photo. It was hard to be sure because the person who had taken these photos had obviously been hiding at the time, but it </span>
  <span>almost</span>
  <span> looked as though the man with the hammer was flying. She glanced sharply at Kingsley. </span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>“Who does he remind you of?” he asked calmly.</span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>Hermione stared at him, trying to perceive any jest in his features. “An old muggle legend I heard as a child. The Norse god of thunder had a hammer. He was called Thor.”</span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>Kingsley leant back in his chair again, face still serious. “I told you this one was different.”</span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>Hermione shook her head. “I’m sorry. Do you really expect me to believe that this person,” she tapped the muscular, blond-haired man’s profile, “is </span>
  <em>
    <span>the</span>
  </em>
  <span> Thor? Son of Odin and all that? An actual </span>
  <span>god</span>
  <span>?!” </span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>“Our wizard friend did not hear a name mentioned for that individual in the course of events but he did overhear the potential Thor mention that his brother, ‘Loki’, had to be stopped.”</span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>“Loki, the trickster god?” Hermione asked faintly. This all seemed so absurd. </span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>“The very same.” </span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>Unable to think of a response, Hermione turned to the next photo, which showed the arrival of muggle men in dark suits, looking the epitome of intelligence workers. “S.H.I.E.L.D. Merlin knows what the muggles think of all this – I’m finding it hard enough and I’m a witch! What happened after this?” she asked, reaching the end of the photos. “Are Thor and his friends still here?”</span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>“It’s believed not. The group went into the desert and the wizard didn’t fancy his chances of remaining undiscovered in such open ground. He said he observed another atmospheric disturbance from afar and it’s thought that Thor and his companions left to return home,” Kingsley explained.</span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>“Right,” Hermione muttered, replacing all the photos and closing the folder. She rubbed her temples as she tried to take everything in. </span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>Kingsley cleared his throat. “So, going back to your original question of why I have now agreed to a liaison with S.H.I.E.L.D,” he paused and met her with a heavy gaze. “I am concerned. These incidents have all taken place within the last few days. As muggles continue to push the boundaries of what is possible with technology and science, the more threats there will be to human life, both muggle and magical. And now we discover that there appears to be life elsewhere in the universe capable of extreme power. Who knows what threats lie out there in other worlds?” </span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>“So, it’s not really us telling S.H.I.E.L.D about what’s happening in the wizarding world, but them keeping us up to date with potential threats we might be unaware of?” Hermione summarised. </span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">Kingsley nodded. “They may well have a different intention for this liaison role, but that’s certainly what <span>my</span><span> point of view is.” </span></p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>Hermione frowned at the folder. “If all these things are happening in America, why not send an American wizard to liaise with them?”</span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>“Ah,” Kingsley said, looking annoyed. “The truth is that S.H.I.E.L.D are not quite as clever as they think: as far as they’re aware, the only witches and wizards live in Britain. Magic in the States hasn’t been detected yet and my counterpart over there would very much like that to remain the case. In exchange for us being the ones to open the channels with the muggles, they will turn their eyes to any travel you should make throughout the country, portkeys included, to a certain extent.”</span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>“I see,” Hermionie replied. There was a pause as he let her gather her various thoughts.</span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>“I understand if you need time to consider this offer,” he said after a while. “The situation in our society might be well on the road to recovery now, but for muggles it seems like the world is growing ever more dangerous. I do need to know by the end of the day though, to give me time to rearrange the meet-"</span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal">
  <span>“I’ll do it,” Hermione interrupted. “I’ll talk with S.H.I.E.L.D.” </span>
</p><p class="qowt-stl-Normal"><span></span> </p>
