    <p>When Harry J. Potter walked into his office the morning of Thursday December 12th, he was less than happy, to say the least. A cold, grey slush seemed to be drizzling steadily down from the sky, and the Christmas rush and bustle made everyone even more haggard and less cheerful than usual. He was expecting that same demanding and shitty attitude to start bleeding into the Auror office any day.</p>
<p>It’s not that Harry hated Christmas. Quite the opposite in fact. He was obsessed with it. Always had been. The lights and tinsel and brightly-colored gifts. The books and movies about families celebrating together and grinches growing hearts. He loved it all.</p>
<p>He’d just always felt like he was on the outside of it.</p>
<p>He felt like the grinch, but he hadn’t the heart to steal anyone else’s joy in order to try and create his own.</p>
<p>It hadn’t been so hard at Hogwarts, with Ron and his yearly Weasley jumper, and he still spent Christmas Eve at the Burrow, still got a yearly jumper. But since their school days, his friends had mostly settled down, built families of their own to spend the actual holiday with, and he either had to intrude on that or spend Christmas alone. Hermione and Mrs. Weasley both claimed his as part of the family, as did Andromeda and Teddy, but he still felt like he was slotting himself into someone else’s celebrations. He’d taken to working through the actual day of Christmas in order to keep from facing that, but this year, he only worked a half day. Which meant half of Christmas Day alone. In Gimmauld Place. With no decorations and no carols. No cheer. No Who-Roast-Beast. Just him and some Firewhiskey.</p>
<p>He wondered briefly if he should do something other than sit at home and drink, be more proactive than wallowing in his own self-pity, but it was a Thursday and he’d been splashed with cold water on his way to work and yelled at by a father for not making sure some new broom toy was available on time, as if he had any control over that, so he thought some wallowing was due. He’d worry about the adult way to handle holiday loneliness tomorrow.</p>
<p>With that in mind, he opened his office door, stripped his outer robes and hung them neatly on their hook, then spelled away the cold water clinging to his trouser legs, straightening the charcoal grey slacks as he did. He didn’t notice the owl on his desk until it gave a tiny “whoo.”</p>
<p>The sound was more of a hiccup than a real whoo, and Harry spun around, wand drawn, to see the smallest, fluffiest owl he’d ever laid eyes on sitting atop a small tree next to his desk. The little thing puffed up as it realized it had been noticed and fluttered its wings, wings that looked too tiny to actually carry the animal anywhere, and the pushed one little leg toward Harry, almost toppling off the tree as it did so.</p>
<p>Stunned into action at the sight, Harry walked over and took the note from the little owl’s leg before thinking to check it or the rest of the situation for spells or curses.</p>
<p>“How did someone even get into my office?” His brain seemed to snap back on as he spoke aloud, and he dropped the missive on his desk, sending spells around the room to test for danger, but no. Everything was in perfect order minus the owl in the…. “Is that a pear tree?”</p>
<p>The owl hooted again and fluttered over to nudge at Harry’s letter before looking up at him.</p>
<p>“All right, all right. I’ll read it. But then, you and this.” He waved his hand. “This tree thing are going home. Wherever that might be.”</p>
<p>The owl hooted and flew a circle around the office, reminding him of Pigwidgeon back when he first arrived. Harry smiled without meaning to and opened the letter, spelling it to its correct size and adjust the thing metal frames on his face.</p>
<p>
  <i>On the first day of Christmas, my true love gave to me <strike>a partridge</strike> an owl in a pear tree.</i>

<p>
  <i>Potter,<br/>
It’s that delightful time of year again, when you forget how loved and important you are to so many people around you. Some you don’t even know about. I’ve seen the dark cloud developing, and I couldn’t sit idly by and do nothing. Not again. So, I’ve planned this set of surprises for you. Please do not worry. There is nothing dangerous, either physically or mentally, in what I’ve prepared. My only hope is to bring you a little happiness during a time you tend to need it. To make you smile, which I admit is a bit selfish as I do so love your smile. I’ve never claimed to be anything less than a bit self-serving, though.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i></i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>For today, you have this owl and pear tree. The tree has been charmed to stay this size, and so long as you put it near the window and <strike>water it regu</strike> allow the elves who take care of our facilities to water it regularly, it will do just fine and make a lovely perch for what I hope to be your new friend.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i></i>
</p>
<p>
  <i></i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>The owl is an athene noctua, or little owl, one of the smallest around, and perfect for nothing but being annoying, really. I’m sure he can handle whatever communications you have in office, but I have no clue if he would be much good outside of that. However, when I saw him at the pet shop, so small and with his feathers sticking out every direction, big eyes watching everything, I saw you that first night in the great hall. I saw the want to be great, the determination to try, the need for a chance. I couldn’t pass him up any more than I’ve ever been able to pass you up. Besides, he does look a bit like a bespectacled git, doesn’t he?</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i></i>
</p>
<p>
  <i></i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>I know you have hesitated, and by that I mean flat out refused to purchase another owl since you lost yours. You can never and should never attempt to replace someone you cared so deeply about, and I do not mean this little guy to try and replace the beautiful Hedwig. She was your friend, and I only hope that he can become one, as well. You’ve always been so good at making friends, a skill I envy to this day, and he only needs a chance, just a little one, to prove he can be that friend.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i></i>
</p>
<p>
  <i></i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>I understand that I may be asking a great deal of you, more than you’re able to give at this time, and I don’t wish to make demands on you. You’ve had more than enough of that. My request then is that you keep him through the holidays, though your lineage of gifts, and if, at the end, you decide it won’t work, I will gladly take the little guy back. I hope that I don’t have to, though. I hope that he brings you joy.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i></i>
</p>
<p>
  <i></i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>Happy Christmas, until tomorrow<br/>
Your true love</i>
</p>
<p>Harry stared at the perfect, precise script, reading through it three times before feeling like anything had sunk into his suddenly thick skull. <i>You forget how loved you are. He reminded me of you. The need for a chance. True love.</i>

</p>
<p>Swallowing heavily, Harry looked over at the little bird. He was nothing like Hedwig, not in look or behavior. Nothing like her. Nothing.</p>
<p>For once, though, the fact that this owl wasn’t <i>his</i> owl didn’t hurt so much. No one was standing next to this owl and looking at Harry with expectant eyes, eyes that asked if he was ready to move on, move past, get over. For once, someone saw his pain, validated the hurt that still existed where his first real friend had lived, and said that pain was allowed to stay as long as he needed it to. That the memory of that first friend was allowed to stay. <i>You’re so good at making friends.</i> The tiny bird bounced around Harry’s desk, nudging at everything, then flew over to a filing cabinet and did the same. Like he was learning the office. Like he wanted to learn it. Like he wanted to be so good at whatever Harry might ask of him. <i>I saw you, determined to try.</i> </p>
<p>Harry coughed hard, the sound echoing like a sob, and clamped a hand over his mouth. He’d forgotten that want to prove himself. After years and years of being forced to, being asked to save the god-damned world, over and over again, he’d forgotten what it was like to just <i>want</i>. To want for himself, rather than hope he helped others survive.</p>
<p>The owl looked up at his cough-that-was-not-a-sob and fluttered back over to the desk, poking around a candy dish before pulling out a peppermint chew and hopping over to nudge it at Harry. Without thinking, Harry opened the treat and popped it in his mouth, grimacing when he bit down and remembered he hated peppermint, how strong it was in things like this, but the owl was watching him, so he dutifully finished the treat, smiling as the tiny thing fluffed and hooted happily, giant eyes squinting shut, when he swallowed it down.</p>
<p>“You reminded him, um, her. Them. Of me, huh? Does that make you a grinch, too?” The owl hooted again, wiggling a bit as he settled himself down in the middle of Harry’s blotter. Sighing, Harry waved his want to put the tree next to the window then transfigured a cup into a bowl and aguamenti’d some water into it. “Allright, Grinch. You have until Christmas.”</p>
