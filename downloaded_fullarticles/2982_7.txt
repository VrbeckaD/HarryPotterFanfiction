    <p>This would be the first Hogsmede trip of this year since Fred and George have left Lee and I alone in this school, fending for ourselves.</p>
<p>To say I was excited is not even close to explaining my well – excitement. I was dressed in some casual attire; my favourite pair of vans, some washed out and too small blue jeans, which made it so they were rather fitting but I liked them that way, and a hyper-colour sweatshirt, at the top it was grey and there was a faded rainbow from about half way down. I had just combed my hair and wore the woolly hat I had stolen from Fred before he declared his exit in the most melodramatic way possible - which was absolutely typical of him may I add. I was scurrying down the path to Hogsmede with Lee, the cold stabbing at us from all angles, making me regret wearing my black fingerless gloves, and no coat. </p>
<p>“Come on Y/N, they’re probably already waiting for us, me and George wanna go to the sweet shop before it gets mobbed” Lee expressed his desire for us to hurry by tugging my left arm out of its socket. I laughed shaking my head, getting a move on. I couldn't and wouldn't admit out loud that I had missed the pair of ginger sods, yet we knew that the place was just too quiet now they were gone; after all there was no chaos, no fun. In a matter of cold minutes, and trips over raised cobblestones, later we were outside the three broomsticks where we had agreed to meet the twins. The Four of us were best friends, and until now, inseparable. I could see that more snow was about to fall, and more icicles were to form. When we walked into the bar we glanced over to our usual corner booth occupied by two gingers in coordinating suits. For a second I could’ve missed them in that attire. </p>
<p>“Who knew we’d see the day that we saw Fred and George in—matching suits?” I joked, Lee cackled. When we reached the booth Lee slipped in beside George, and I Fred. That’s the way we’ve always sat. </p>
<p>“I’ve missed you Y/N” Fred exclaimed wrapping his long arms around my small boney frame in a well-needed hug. </p>
<p>“Missed you too, how’s the joke shop?” I asked, while watching George head towards the bar. </p>
<p>“Business is booming, how’s Umbridge?”</p>
<p>“Ghastly and overly pink” I retorted. He rolled his eyes and laughed.</p>
<p>“Oh news!” I bellowed, slamming my hands flat onto the table.</p>
<p>“News?” Lee asked, scoffing, pretending to be offended that I hadn’t consulted him first. </p>
<p>“I’m going to leave Hogwarts” “What?” Lee choked. “I don’t think with the changes going on that I – well, we should stay.”</p>
<p>“But y/n I don’t think you should leave, you’re on the brink of doing your NEWTs”</p>
<p>“Freddie that’s hypocritical, we flew out of there, literally.” George argued.</p>
<p>“Y/N you out of any of us have a better chance of passing your NEWTs. You actually possess some sort of academic intelligence, don’t make a mistake, me and Georgie had no hope – you do” he argued, and in his defence, he was right. School just wasn’t for them. Their intelligence was better in other circumstances. </p>
<p>“I’ve already made up my mind and spoken to McGonagall, she seems to think I can take my NEWTs in a few weeks with enough preparation, so that’s what I’m going to do.” </p>
<p>“I’m sure you’ll pass with flying colours, y/n, and hey Freddie they can come work for us in the Joke Shop?” </p>
<p>“Absolutely” he said, retracting his gaze from the table and on to the floor, deep in thought. We all took a silent sip of Butterbeer, savouring the taste. Ah Happiness, who knew how long it was going to last.</p>
<p>After all, You-Know-Who is coming. </p>
<p>“What’s up Fredo?” I cooed, seeing that he had hardly touched his drink. </p>
<p>“I’m just worried about you that’s all, isn’t your decision a little –rash? Perhaps?” he asked, voice filled with genuine concern. </p>
<p>“I’ve been thinking about it for months, and my dad he thinks doing this will be good for me – given what we keep hearing on the grapevine.” </p>
<p>“How is your dad? Hearing this can’t be easy for him?” </p>
<p>“I don’t know, I wrote to him a month ago but got no response”</p>
<p> “Maybe he has forgotten to reply?” He asked, I just nodded in agreement while I drunk the rest of his Butterbeer since I had polished mine off mere minutes ago. He raised an eyebrow but sighed in defeat. Lee and George informed us that they were going to the sweet shop, that if we saved the table they would buy us our favourite sweets. </p>
<p>“I am going to join the order, I’m almost nineteen, and I’m done with school.” </p>
<p>“No you’re not” Fred retorted, speaking plainly. </p>
<p>“Yes I am” I almost roared.</p>
<p>“No, Y/N. You. Are. Not. It’s too dangerous” he spoke in a hushed tone, to ensure there were no listening ears and prying eyes. </p>
<p>“Fred. You can’t stop me.” </p>
<p>“Oh? You wanna bet?” he challenged, my eyes narrowed. His fear, increasing by the second - yet he still managed a firm nod to confirm his opinion. </p>
<p>“Is that so?” I smirked, tilted my head, raising an eyebrow while retaining strong eye contact. </p>
<p>“Yep” He said, popping the P. I grazed my teeth along my chapped lips still looking at him. </p>
<p>“Then, make me”

 “I will tickle you into extinction”</p>
<p>“Extinction? I’m not a species you dimwit” </p>
<p>“Really? You should be, you’re one of a kind”</p>
<p>“Oh shut up.” </p>
<p>“Y/n I’m begging you, don’t join the order. It’s too dangerous, you could get hurt”</p>
<p>“But-“ </p>
<p>“Join the Order if you must but don’t go into enemy lines, don’t go and do missions. Please.” </p>
<p>“Okay, if you don’t want me to that bad, I won’t. I’ll be a secondary Molly Weasley.” </p>
<p>“Oh god no, do not put that image in my head” he pleaded. </p>
<p>“Why not? What you been thinking about” I hollered while winking. </p>
<p>“You should start heading back with these induced curfews” I glanced at my small, brown leather strapped watch, sighing. His face returning to its pasty white from the scarlet colour it had been moments ago. </p>
<p>“I should. But I don’t want to.” </p>
<p>“I don’t want you to go back either, but you must. Do move in with me and George when you leave. You’ll be safe there. I promise.” I nodded, gathering my belongings and preparing to leave. </p>
<p>“See ya round Fred, if you see Lee tell him I’ve headed back.” I say, turning to leaving before Fred engulfs me in yet another hug. I hugged him back, half burying my head in his chest, relaxing my tense shoulders, half taking in my surroundings; a busy bustling bar, with people coming in and out at a constant rate, the stained wooden tables and the red cushioned seats. I’d miss it. He released me from his grasp claiming he had to return to the shop. I could feel his eyes watch me as I walked back to the castle.</p>
