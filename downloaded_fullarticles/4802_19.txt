  <strong>15 January 1996 - Monday</strong>
</p><p>“<em>Legilimens</em>!”</p><p>Harry stumbled back as the curse hit him, and…</p><p><em>Freak woke in the middle of the night, sweating and weeping from that same old nightmare of green light and fear and pain.  He was terrified, and the cupboard was so dark, and </em>something just crawled across his leg<em>!</em></p><p>
  <em>He screamed and wept and pounded on the door, desperate to get out.  He couldn’t breathe.  “Please!  Help me!  Please!  Let me out!  Help!”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>There was a rumbling, thumping from above him and his panicked mind couldn’t figure out what it was.  Terror spiked sharper and he started screaming incoherently.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Then, finally, the door was wrenched open and he sucked in a gasp of air at last.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The large figure didn’t let him out though, and he didn’t help him.  He didn’t comfort him.  He yelled.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“SHUT UP, YOU WORTHLESS LITTLE FREAK!  SHUT THE FUCK UP!”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>And then his hand snapped forward, so fast Freak barely saw it coming.  Pain in his face, his ear.  He screamed louder.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The sharp pain came again.  Then again.  Then again.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>He finally collapsed, curling himself into a ball, quietly begging for it to stop.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“And you’d better stay quiet, Freak.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The door slammed shut.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Freak stayed curled up in a ball, struggling to breathe.  His chest was heaving, but he couldn’t seem to get enough air.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Freak is sorry.  Freak is sorry.  Freak is sorry,” he gasped over and over again, rocking his small body back and forth, back and forth, again and again, repeating the litany while he slowly regained his ability to breathe.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Freak is sorry.”</em>
</p><p>Harry landed hard on the floor in the Potions Master’s office, his chest heaving, tears drying on his cheeks.  Fuck, he hadn’t thought about that night in so long…</p><p>He scrubbed his sleeve across his cheeks and glanced warily up at the professor.  For once, Snape wasn’t sneering at him.  His face was even paler than normal, his eyes too wide.  The rest of his face was utterly blank as he stared at Harry for a long moment.</p><p>Finally, he blinked and the moment had passed.  “Again,” he said slightly hoarsely.</p><p>Harry took a deep breath as he pulled himself up, struggling to prepare himself to experience another memory that he’d tried so hard to forget forever.  There was no way in hell he was going to tell Snape that he needed a break, so he forced himself to look up and meet those expressionless black eyes.</p><p>
  <em>“Legilimens!”</em>
</p><p>Better prepared this time, Harry met the attack and held for a split second before…</p><p>
  <em>Freak’s mouth opened in horror when he saw the plate he’d dropped freeze and hover in midair about an inch off the floor.  He’d been so afraid of it getting broken, because then his uncle would be mad, but this was worse.  This was much worse.  This wasn’t supposed to happen.  He remembered what had happened the last time something unnatural had happened.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>He reached for the plate, hoping to snatch it up before anyone noticed, but then Aunt Petunia screamed, and he knew it was too late.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>His uncle stood up from the table – saw what had happened.  His eyes widened.  His face turned white, and then purple.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Freak gulped.  He was terrified, but he wouldn’t let something more happen.  He couldn’t handle it if something else unnatural happened.  Uncle Vernon would kill him then.  He knew it.  So he cringed, but did nothing when his uncle kicked the plate away.  It hit the wall and shattered.  Then his uncle grabbed his arm and yanked.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>He yelped quietly, but knew not to scream.  Uncle hated it when he screamed.  When he made any noise that wasn’t in direct answer to a question or command.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Silent tears streamed down Freak’s face as he was dragged out of the kitchen.  Uncle threw him against the wall next to his cupboard.  He hit his face hard, and a small “eep” escaped him before he cut it off.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Fucking worthless Freak,” Uncle was saying behind him, but Freak didn’t dare move.  He couldn’t help that his whole body was trembling though.  “Doing your freakish things in my house.  I won’t have it.  Not in front of my son.  You’ll be the death of us all.  After we took you in out of the kindness of our hearts.  Taking the clothes off my son’s back.  The food out of my son’s mouth.  Worthless, good for nothing…  Just like your disgusting parents.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Well, I won’t have it.  I’ll beat that freakishness right out of you.  That’s what I’ll do.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Freak cringed when he heard the clinking of the belt buckle.  Then the sharp snap of the leather being pulled taut.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Hold still, you worthless Freak.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Freak tried to stop his trembling, but was only partially successful.  Then the first blow fell across his back like a line of fire and he choked as he tried to hold in the scream.  The first one was always the worst.  Somehow, he was never quite expecting it to hurt as bad as it did.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>A second blow.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>A third.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>He stopped bothering to count then.  Counting didn’t help.  Nothing helped.  All he could do was try to stay silent and he knew it would eventually be over.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>It’ll be over.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>It will end.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>He’ll stop soon.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Don’t cry out.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>It will end.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Don’t cry.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The words repeated over and over and over in his mind, in time with the lashes.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>And then, like always, it stopped.  Finally.  His whole back was on fire now.  His whole body felt like it was burning.  His throat ached from trying not to scream and cry.</em>
</p><p><em>Uncle grabbed him by the hair and shoved him into his cupboard.  He landed on his back on the coarse fabric of the dirty little mattress, and </em>slid<em>.  His back cried out in agony and he felt his teeth sink into his lip as he struggled to keep the cry from getting out.  Uncle would just hurt him more if he made noise.</em></p><p>
  <em>The cupboard door slammed shut, plunging him into darkness.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Freak rolled onto his side and curled himself into a ball.  Tears slid from his eyes and he felt like a great hole had opened up in his chest.  It hurt so much, and not just his back.  He hurt inside.  He couldn’t understand why these things kept happening to him.  He didn’t know how to make Aunt and Uncle happy.  He always messed up.  He tried so hard, but he could never get it right.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>He never would.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Because the Freak would always be a worthless burden.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Tears continued to slide from his eyes until exhaustion finally overcame the pain.</em>
</p><p>Harry gasped and managed to steady himself on the back of a chair before his knees gave out.  Fuck, that had been a bad one.  They’d gotten better fairly soon after that.  The accidental magic had started happening less often.  And he learned to tolerate the punishments better.  He learned to not let them hurt him so much – well, emotionally, anyway.  Or maybe everything inside finally just got hard enough that he didn’t feel it anymore.</p><p>Again, he was appalled to find tears on his cheeks.  He scrubbed them away and looked up at the professor, too weary to feel embarrassed, or even defensive after what the man had just seen.  He had no doubt that he’d be hearing about this soon enough, probably in class in front of everyone.  He could almost hear it now, “What’s the matter, Potter?  Are you going to cry because I vanished your potion?  From a <em>Freak </em>like you, we couldn’t expect any better, could we?”</p><p>“Get out, Potter,” Snape said, sounding as exhausted as Harry felt.</p><p>He couldn’t even find it in himself to glare, so he just turned and walked out.</p>
<hr/><p>Severus collapsed into the chair behind his desk and buried his face in his hands.  Sweet mother of Merlin, how could he have been so wrong about that boy?  How could Potter have gone through that?  He was Harry bloody Potter for Salazar’s sake!  Hadn’t Albus watched out for the boy <em>at all</em>?</p><p>And why the fuck was he now angry that the boy <em>hadn’t </em>been a pampered prince? </p><p>Gods, by those two memories…  If they were <em>any </em>indication of the boy’s childhood in general…  Potter’s childhood had been worse than Severus’ own.  At least he’d had his mother.  She’d <em>tried </em>to protect him, and she’d often succeeded.  Potter hadn’t had anyone.  He’d seen very clearly in that second memory that Petunia and that swine of a boy had done nothing to protect Harry.  They hadn’t even seemed like they’d <em>wanted </em>to try to help.  Indeed, they’d both looked like they thought he <em>deserved </em>it.  A little boy, not more than four, had received at least thirty lashes with a leather belt for…</p><p>Severus stomach turned.  For <em>accidental magic</em>.</p><p>He sighed heavily and found a bottle of Firewhisky in his desk.  He tugged out the cork and took a long pull.  He really couldn’t decide if he hated Albus more for what had happened to the boy or for forcing Severus to give these accursed lessons that had made him aware of what had happened. </p><p>Fuck.  Ignorance really had been bliss.</p><p>He had no idea what he was going to do now.  Well, he was going to have a few more drinks and then go scream at Albus, yes, but after that…  He didn’t know if he could even look at the boy after this, much less continue to teach him, in the classroom or out of it.  He felt like such an utter fool for the way he’d treated the boy these last five years.  Not that he thought it would have surprised the boy.  Potter was clearly very accustomed to being treated like scum and viciously slandered.  No wonder the boy hated him.  Severus had been doing a remarkable impression of Potter’s disgusting muggle uncle.</p><p>And he just felt dirty to have made that comparison – to know that it was shamefully accurate, even if he’d never physically harmed the boy.</p><p>Fuck.  If there was one emotion that Severus knew and hated above all others, it was remorse.  And he’d just acquired an entirely new depth of it.</p><p>He gulped more Firewhisky, then summoned up those two memories and placed them into a small bottle.  If he had to feel like shit about this, he was going to make damn sure that Albus was feeling it, too.  Imagining the headmaster’s face when he realized exactly what he’d done putting the boy with his relatives finally brought a small, bitter smirk to his lips.</p>

  <strong>6 February 1996 - Tuesday</strong>
</p><p align="center">
  <strong>(Three Weeks Later)</strong>
</p><p>“My Lord,” Severus bowed deeply from his knees, his forehead nearly brushing the marble floor.  He’d been thinking about this for two straight weeks, but after two more Occlumency lessons, and a dozen more memories in the same vein as those first two, he felt confident that he was doing the right thing.</p><p>“Severus,” the Dark Lord murmured affectionately.  “Rise.”</p><p>Severus did as commanded, looking up into the brilliant red eyes of the man who was the closest thing he’d ever known to a father.  Though he would always love the man unequivocally, he couldn’t help but appreciate the Dark Lord’s return to a human appearance.  It had taken almost a whole year, but the potions he’d designed had finally done their job.  Lord Voldemort was as beautiful as he’d been born to be – his skin smooth and pale but healthy, his thick black hair hung in gentle waves to his shoulders, bound loosely back behind his neck.  He was slender, but healthy and strong.  The man even looked a bit younger than Severus though the Dark Lord was more than twice his age. </p><p>Though he knew his Lord’s almost unimaginable well of magical power had done a large part of the work, Severus was incredibly proud that he’d been able to lend his assistance to the process through his potions.</p><p>Lord Voldemort stepped forward and gripped Severus’ shoulder in a firm, kind grip and led him from the throne room into his study.  “What is on your mind, dear one?” the Dark Lord inquired once they’d settled into arm chairs and taken up the tea delivered by an elf.</p><p>“It’s about Potter,” Severus said quietly.</p><p>The Dark Lord quirked one perfectly shaped black brow in question.</p><p>Severus took a bracing breath.  He knew that this was a sensitive subject.  He’d been such a fool.  When Lily had been threatened, Severus had dared to beg his Lord to spare her.  And his Lord had agreed.  When Lily had died…  Severus had felt betrayed by the only person he’d believed truly cared for him.  And he’d done the unthinkable.  He’d abandoned his Lord, despite knowing that the Dark Lord had told him he was immortal.  He’d not tried to find a way to bring him back.  Instead, he’d sworn to protect the boy most probably responsible for his Lord’s fall.</p><p>When Lord Voldemort had returned, Severus had not even considered lying.  Not even for an instant.  He’d thrown himself at his Lord’s feet, he’d told him everything, and he’d begged for death.  He’d hated himself so much that death would have been a relief.</p><p>But his Lord had not killed him.  No.  The man had spared him, which had been even worse.  The Cruciatus he’d suffered had not been nearly painful enough to make him feel worthy of redemption, but he’d gotten it anyway.  He’d been charged with spying on the old fool as penance, but he hated himself for being useless in dealing with the Potter brat despite being the only one close enough to have a good chance at killing the boy.  He’d even offered to kill him despite his vow, which would have killed Severus as well.</p><p>His Lord had refused that proposition.  He’d told Severus that he valued him too much to allow him to die in such a way.  He’d promised that Severus would not be involved in Potter’s death in any way, ensuring that his vow did not harm him.</p><p>Despite that, however, they never discussed Potter between them.  Not since that day.  Now, he’d brought it up, and he had to keep talking.  On some level, he hoped to be punished for it, though he’d not developed a masochistic streak like some of the Death Eaters.  He didn’t <em>enjoy </em>the pain his Lord dealt him.  He just felt like he deserved it.  Like it might lessen his guilt a little.</p><p>“I know that you wouldn’t have come to me about the boy unless you felt it warranted, Severus,” Lord Voldemort said quietly when the silence had gone on too long.  “Speak your mind, dear one.”</p><p>Severus closed his eyes briefly, reveling in the affection in his Lord’s voice even now.  Even with this topic at hand.  “Albus has charged me with teaching the boy Occlumency, to protect his mind from you, my Lord.”</p><p>The Dark Lord’s eyes narrowed thoughtfully.  “Is the boy capable of mastering the art?”  Nothing less than a master had any chance at repelling the Dark Lord successfully, after all.</p><p>Severus nodded, “His mind is incredibly strong, my Lord, as was evident by his ability to throw off the Imperius Curse last year.  But it is also very chaotic.  With proper dedication and tutelage, he could perhaps rival my own skill.”</p><p>Lord Voldemort seemed to consider that for a moment.  “Will your vow allow you to sabotage his training?”</p><p>Severus felt his eye twitch at the mention of his foolish vow, but he nodded slowly, “I will have to actually train him, but if I am harsh enough with him, I can likely avoid making any real progress.”  He cleared his throat quietly.  “That… is not my reason for coming tonight, however.”</p><p>The Dark Lord’s brow lifted inquiringly.</p><p>Severus took another bracing breath.  “In his mind, I discovered some… disturbing memories.  If it would please you, my Lord, I believe you may wish to view them.”</p><p>Lord Voldemort lifted one hand and a pensieve flew out of a cupboard against the far wall, landing on a table that materialized beneath it just in time.</p><p>Severus drew the memories out one by one and placed them into the pensieve.</p><p>“Join me, Severus,” the Dark Lord instructed.</p><p>They both entered the pensieve and watched the memories that Severus had organized chronologically to the best of his ability based on the boy’s apparent age.</p><p>Harry in his cupboard, waking up from a nightmare.</p><p>Harry’s hovering the plate and being beaten for it.</p><p>Harry burning breakfast, being hit with a hot frying pan, forced to recook the breakfast, and then beaten before he was thrown back into his cupboard.</p><p>Harry being dragged out of his cupboard, so delirious with hunger and thirst that he could barely walk straight, his body fouled with his own waste, being forced into a cold shower, then made to scrub out his filthy cupboard.  The boy was then made to make breakfast for his family and given only scraps for himself.</p><p>Harry being chased down the street by his cousin and a group of his cousin’s friends.  Being caught and beaten and kicked by the lot of them until he was vomiting blood.</p><p>Harry going home after the beating and being yelled at for getting blood on the floor, made to clean it up, and then whipped by his uncle for the single small hit he’d managed to get in on his cousin during the beating.  Finally, he was tossed back into his cupboard.</p><p>A teacher at Harry’s primary school noticed a bruise.  His terror was clear in his eyes, but the school counselor at last managed to get a tentative confession of its origin.  The Dursleys were brought in and somehow managed to talk their way out of it.  Then back at the house, Harry received such a beating he must have been nearly dead when he was tossed into his cupboard.</p><p>Then, when Harry was about eight, his uncle sodomizing him for what seemed the first time.  That one was cut short as Harry had actually forced him out relatively quickly.  He’d included at the end the shame and anger in the boy’s eyes when he’d looked at Severus afterward. </p><p>There were several more memories along the same vein, all of which ended with Harry in his cupboard, rocking back and forth and referring to himself still as “Freak”.  He had to be ten or eleven in the last ones.</p><p>When they emerged from the pensieve, the air was thick with the Dark Lord’s absolutely livid magic.  His eyes glowed a brilliant crimson.  He was furious.</p><p>Severus instinctively dropped himself to the floor, bowing his head low.  He knew Lord Voldemort wasn’t angry with him, but he also knew that that didn’t mean he wouldn’t be punished.  When the Dark Lord was this angry, he didn’t always pay that much attention to who received his curses.</p><p>“So this is the old fool’s golden boy,” the Dark Lord said after a minute, his voice low, smooth, and incredibly dangerous.  “Oh, Albus, you truly do make your own enemies.”</p><p>The magic in the room began to settle down and Severus breathed a silent sigh of relief.</p><p>“Rise, Severus,” he said after a moment.</p><p>Severus carefully unfolded himself and returned to his chair, looking up at his Lord cautiously.</p><p>Lord Voldemort seemed to have regained his temper without throwing a single curse, which was pleasantly surprising.  “In your opinion, Severus, do you think the boy may be turned?” he asked quietly.</p><p>“I believe it is possible, my Lord,” which was the reason he’d brought this to Lord Voldemort in the first place.  “To my knowledge, no one has ever asked the boy’s opinion, nor explained to him what the war is really about.  He’s been told since entering the wizarding world that you killed his parents and would stop at nothing to kill him.  I don’t believe he’s ever even considered that there may be a choice for him but to fight against you or die.</p><p>“The more… <em>radical </em>views of some of the other Death Eaters’ children are likely the only exposure he has had to the beliefs and goals of your cause, my Lord.  He does not understand the war, and has fought only for his life and the lives of his friends.  I believe it would take some convincing, but I don’t think it would be impossible.”</p><p>Lord Voldemort nodded slowly, then focused on Severus again.  “Then your duty is to lay a foundation of the truth for him, Severus.  Show him that you and he are not so different.  Show him that what you have learned has caused you to reassess him.”  He hesitated slightly, then added, “Do not sabotage his training.  Be gentle with him.”</p><p>Which would slow the training down some, and also hopefully win some good will.  However, it <em>would </em>quite likely result in the boy actually being on his way to mastering the art.  Evidently, it was a risk the Dark Lord was willing to take.</p><p>“With such a past, I do not know how he was not sorted into Slytherin,” he mused.  “See if you can discover that answer, Severus.  Help him to understand the truth of Albus.  And of me.”</p><p>“It will be as you wish, my Lord,” Severus said with quiet reverence.  His Lord had responded as he had hoped.  If Harry could be brought to their side, Severus would no longer be forced to divide his allegiance.  That, he wished for above all else.  He also genuinely wished to help the boy who had suffered a childhood even worse than his own.  It was not something he’d ever expected to feel for Potter’s son, but…  Well, he was beginning to understand now that there was very little of James Potter in the son.</p><p>He was not arrogant, he was defensive.  For anyone to have survived such a childhood without being broken, it spoke of incredible strength of mind and character.  And it did not surprise him in the least that the boy met confrontation with confrontation.  Being rebellious, at least in his own mind, was probably the only thing that had kept the boy from being completely crushed by those vile swine he had the misfortune to call relatives.</p><p>“He will not return to those muggles, Severus,” Lord Voldemort spoke again.  “I will not allow it.  It would be best if he could be swayed toward us before the term ends.”</p><p>“I will give it my full attention, my Lord.”</p><p>“I know that you will, dear one,” Lord Voldemort said affectionately, resting his hand gently on Severus’ shoulder for a moment before releasing him.  “Now return, before you are missed, my spy.”</p><p>Severus rose and bowed deeply before taking his leave.  When he apparated back to Hogwarts, his heart was lighter than it had been in sixteen years.</p>
