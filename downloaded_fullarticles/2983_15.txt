</p><p>Okay, Pansy admitted it. Suggesting that somebody grab Harry Potter and hand him over to the Dark Lord, in the middle of a Great Hall <em>full</em> of Potter-lovers, was not her smartest move.</p><p>It wasn’t as if she wanted Harry Potter to die. Not really. It had been fun to hate him and his Band of Merry Gryffindors when they were all younger and the threat of the Dark Lord had been hypothetical at best, but now that he was back and taking over everything and everyone she knew and loved, she found herself developing a new appreciation for the things that the Dark Lord could not darken. Things were too serious and sad for her to hate much of anything anymore.</p><p>So, no. She did not want Harry Potter to die. She just wanted this, all of this, to be over. There was a moment, after the Dark Lord had guaranteed that nobody would be harmed if Potter were handed over. A moment where Pansy, despite knowing better at that stage, believed the Dark Lord.</p><p>The moment did not last long; a couple of seconds, at most. But it was enough. Enough for her to act on it, and do something that she could well be paying for for years to come.</p><p>If she made it out of this war alive, that was.</p><p>As Filch led her and her fellow Slytherins to the passage out of the school, Pansy was distracted from the act of silently kicking herself when she noticed something that made her heart stop. Draco was not there.</p><p>“No,” she whispered, as a wave of indecision overtook her. She knew that things were about to get unfathomably dangerous at Hogwarts, with her teachers and classmates battling against the friends and family with whom she had been raised. If she was here when the fighting commenced, she would be asked to pick a side. But, if she carried on, Draco might get caught in the frey. His father would force him to fight with the Death Eaters, and some plucky member of the Order of the Phoenix might notice his recognisable hair and aim a curse without stopping to think…</p><p>Pansy couldn’t do it. She couldn’t leave him.</p><p>And so, while crowds of students gathered inside the Room of Requirement, she snuck away.</p><p>Being sure to keep her head low, so she would not be easily recognised, she ran to the Slytherin Common Room first. She pelted up the stairs to her dormitory, yanked open the drawer of her bedside table, and pulled out a small, wooden doll. It was a little something she had made in her 5th year, when she had been infatuated with Draco and wanted to know where he was at all times. Now that she was thoroughly over that infatuation, the fact that she still owned this charmed doll was a little embarrassing. Right then, however, she was abundantly grateful that she had been too lazy to throw it away. It was exactly what she needed.</p><p>Pansy pushed the drawer closed and ran out of the dormitory. She ducked into a nearby corridor, held the wooden doll to her lips and whispered, “where’s my Drakie-poo?” Forcing herself not to cringe at the revolting nickname, she watched the doll shake itself awake, stand on the palm of her hand, and point upwards.</p><p><em>Perfect</em>, she thought, sarcastically, <em>I just came from there</em>. So she retraced her steps, watching the doll as it directed her up seven flights of stairs. As she continued to climb, she became more and more certain that Draco was somewhere near the Room of Requirement. <em>Again, perfect. I was just there. Where the hell was he? Why didn’t I see him there?</em></p><p>As she approached the Room, however, the doll suddenly collapsed in her hand, as lifeless as it had been before she had spoken the awful incantation. Pansy frowned. That meant one of two things. Either Draco was dead (a possibility that she simply refused to fathom until she saw his lifeless body with her own eyes), or he had just entered the Unplottable Room of Requirement. The doll had behaved similarly many times last year.</p><p>When she reached the section of hallways where the door to the Room had previously been, she was greeted with a frustratingly blank wall. She tried to bring the door back a couple of times, but it wasn’t moving for her. The Room was evidently no longer in the form of the army training room/giant bedroom/whatever-the-fuck-else-it-was room that it had been before. If it was, she would have easily been able to get in. However, the room was not empty either, because, if it were, she would have been able to create her own style of Room with it. No. Some people, including Draco, had to be in that Room, and it had to be being used in a secretive way, like Draco had done before.</p><p>Unfortunately, she had never found out how to get into the Room while Draco had been using it. During her sixth year, whenever she had learned that he was in there, she had given up and figured she would try to find him again later. That wasn’t an option for her now. She also could not stay there, in that main corridor, completely exposed. The walls around her were shaking, and she kept being passed by frantic students and members of the Order running from one window to the next, shooting aggressive dueling spells in a desperate attempt to keep the Death Eaters out of the castle. There was no way that was going to last, and Pansy did not want to risk being seen by anybody who might stop and look closely enough to recognise her.</p><p>So she ran into a side corridor, located a portrait she knew from past experience had just enough space behind it for a reasonably slim person to hide, and stayed there, keeping the lifeless doll in her sight.</p><p>The castle continued to shake from the spells being hurled at it, and Pansy felt showers of dust land on her head and shoulders. She knew she could not stay there for much longer, but she wanted to hold on until the last possible minute, just in case Draco left the Room of Requirement.</p><p>After about twenty minutes, there was a loud, almost ungodly roaring sound. Pansy felt a blast of terrifyingly hot air, then heard the loud slamming of a door and the loud <em>thump</em> of several heavy weights hitting the ground. Her doll suddenly sprang to life and pointed eagerly toward the main corridor. Pansy breathed a sigh of relief. Draco was alive and out of the Room.</p><p>She swung the portrait open, just a fraction, and peeked outside. Her view was not the greatest, but she could see Potter, Weasley, and Granger standing outside the entrance, looking at something in Potter’s hands. Next to them, sitting on the floor and catching their breath, were two person-sized lumps, and Pansy could see Draco’s platinum blond hair among them. The Golden Trio of Gryffindors did not appear to be paying Draco and his companion any attention, which Pansy was happy to see. If the Gryffindors moved a little further out of the way, she might be able to sneak behind them and grab Draco.</p><p>While she was formulating her plan, there was a loud blast from somewhere to the side, and the Gryffindors ran toward it. <em>Perfect</em>, Pansy thought. She started to step out of the portrait, but quickly had to draw back as the golden trio re-appeared, this time with two of Weasley’s brothers. Pansy noticed Draco standing up and poking the other body, which Pansy soon saw was Goyle. The two of them shuffled down the corridor and out of Pansy’s sight.</p><p>All five Gryffindors were aggressively waving their wands, which suggested that they were fighting with people out of her line of sight. <em>Okay</em>, she thought to herself. <em>Maybe I can wait for them to move away again</em>. Another loud blast sounded, this time from somewhere behind her, and the idea of waiting was suddenly considerably less appealing. She decided to make a break for it, and hope the Gryffindors and whoever they were fighting would all be too preoccupied to notice her scuttling away behind them.</p><p>So she climbed out of the portrait and sprinted for the main corridor. As she got to the corner, one of the older Weasleys stepped back, yelling to the other one “You actually are joking, Perce!” Pansy knocked into the Weasley, and he whipped around and grabbed her arm.</p><p>Pansy pulled him two steps back before her brain computed that someone was grabbing her. She turned around and registered that it was one of the Weasley twins. Her eyes met his, and everything went still, for that tiny, barely significant moment.</p><p>“What the--” the Weasley said, sounding confused, surprised, and a little concerned. The sound of his voice brought her out of her trance. Wrenching her eyes away, she turned and saw Draco and Goyle staggering around the corner. She pulled her arm free from the Weasley’s grip and sprinted after them, not daring to yell their names in case she drew attention to herself. Just as she reached the corner, the entire corridor was blasted into smithereens, and the force of the explosion propelled Pansy forward. She landed, hard, and the world around her went black.</p><p>--</p><p>Fred recognised her immediately. She was that Slytherin would-be-snitch; the one who wanted to throw Harry to You-Know-Who like a sacrificial lamb. Had she not been just about the last person he had expected to bump into at that moment, he would have had a few choice words for her, centred mainly around her cowardice and his unfavourable opinion on it. As it was, he was too surprised to say anything.</p><p>Their eyes met, and Fred, despite himself and the situation, found that he could not look away. He knew what this girl had just done, yet her eyes showed no evil, or malice, or even cowardice. Instead, they showed fear, and desperation, and, most surprisingly, remorse. She was sorry for her actions, and she has good as admitted that to him, in that half a second’s worth of eye contact.</p><p>Then she pulled her arm free and ran off. The noise around him seemed to come back on, and he was in the middle of the battle again.</p><p>Suddenly the corridor in front of him exploded, and as he felt the white-hot power of a lethal spell burn along his left arm, he and the others were thrown several feet backwards.</p><p>It was the pain in his arm, perhaps, that made him come to before the others. He looked to his left, and the sight alone was enough to make him want to faint. The skin was a raw, mottled combination of red and black. Some bits were peeled back, and other bits looked like the skin had been completely burned off. The pain, now that he was getting a fair idea about the extent of the damage, was unbelievable. He would not be surprised if he could never use that arm again.</p><p>Fred looked back, and he could see that the brunt of the spell had hit the corridor, just one or two paces from where he had been standing.</p><p>It could not be confirmed in any way, but Fred had a gut feeling about what he was seeing. He knew that if that Parkinson girl had not bumped into him and pulled him backwards, he would now be dead.</p><p>--</p><p>
  <em>I shall wait for one hour in the Forbidden Forest … one hour …</em>
</p><p>Fred ran into the Great Hall, Percy at his heels, and spotted the vibrant red hair of the rest of his family straight away. He ran towards them, flinging his good arm around his twin. He had never been a religious man and doubted he ever would be, but right then he was thanking God that George was alright.</p><p>“Mate,” his brother said, looking at his bad arm, “you need to see Madam Pomfrey. Right now.”</p><p>“No. Not yet. Others need her more than me.” Fred gestured around them, and, sure enough, there were no less than a dozen people on the ground, struggling to breathe. Fred knew that he might lose his arm, but if nothing else happened to him that evening, he would live.</p><p>“Ron!” he heard Percy exclaim. Looking up, he saw Ron and Hermione sprinting towards the family. Harry, Fred noticed, was hanging back, and Fred noticed his eyes landing on the unmoving bodies of Lupin and Tonks. He figured that Harry probably needed a moment, and turned back to his brothers.</p><p>“...and we passed Malfoy at one point,” Ron was saying. “A Death Eater was about to kill him, and he was begging him not to, saying he was on their side. Two-faced bastard. I’m surprised he didn’t go running off with the rest of them.”</p><p>“Some of them stayed behind,” Fred remarked, absentmindedly.</p><p>“Oh yeah?” George asked, glancing at his brother. “I haven’t seen anybody else.. Maybe they all got blasted and nobody’s bothered to go and get them.”</p><p>“Maybe…” Fred was not paying his brothers much attention now, as his mind went back to the explosion. <em>That Parkinson girl… there was no way she would not have been hit by it. And yet…</em> Fred looked around, and there was no sign of her anywhere.</p><p>He did not know why he knew, but, somehow, he knew that she was still in that corridor.</p><p>“Be right back,” he said to his brothers, and he ran back through the Great Hall before any of them could stop him.</p><p>It was not easy to run up seven flights of stairs with a badly damaged arm, but he managed it. The seventh floor corridor (or what was left of it) was completely deserted, and he jogged down the length of it carefully, looking for any sign of her.</p><p>He was just about to turn the corner to the sight of the explosion when he noticed a dust-covered head of short, jet-black hair lying, face-down, on the ground. His heart skipped a beat, and the fear that she might not be alive flooded through him like a tidal wave. Not knowing why that thought caused him so much fear, but understanding that the fear was there all the same, he knelt beside her.</p><p>“Don’t be dead,” he whispered, pressing two fingers to the side of her neck. “Please don’t be dead…”</p><p>It took a couple of moments, and a lot more patience than Fred had at the best of times, but he did, eventually, feel a pulse. It was faint, but it was definitely there.</p><p>“Thank Merlin,” he said, pulling out his wand. He Levitated her to his waist level and carefully guided her back down to the Great Hall. Once there, he set the Parkinson girl down beside the other recovering bodies, conjured a pillow and blanket for her, and located Madam Pomfrey.</p><p>“I’ve brought you the Parkinson girl,” he said to the brisk, business-like matron.</p><p>Madam Pomfrey, who was wrapping a bandage around a dazed Ravenclaw student’s knee, looked up. “The Parkinson girl? Now is not the time for jokes, Weasley. Surely even you understand that?”</p><p>“Of course I do, and I’m not joking.” Fred pointed to the blanket-encased mound he had just created. “I think she must have snuck back into the school. I found her along the seventh floor corridor. She was knocked out by the blast that happened there a few hours ago, and I’m guessing nobody thought to look for her, since they all think she was with the other Slytherins.”</p><p>“Hmm.” Pomfrey stood up and strode over to the blanket. Upon seeing the Parkinson girl’s face, her eyes visibly widened.</p><p>“My apologies for doubting you, Weasley. Thank you for finding her.”</p><p>The matron knelt beside the young brunette witch and waved her wand over her.</p><p>“Will she be alright?” Fred asked.</p><p>Madam Pomfrey nodded. “I think so, although it might take her a day or so to wake up. I’ll keep her in the hospital wing until then. Do you want me to tell her who brought her here?”</p><p>One corner of Fred’s mouth turned up in a wry grin. “You’d better not. I think she’d be mortified to discover that her saviour is a Gryffindor. And a Weasley, at that.”</p><p>Madam Pomfrey rolled her eyes. “Honestly, you kids and your House rivalries. Suit yourself.”</p><p>Fred nodded, and made his exit before Madam Pomfrey had a chance to notice his arm. Despite it still being a war, he felt an enormous sense of relief. She was going to be alright. Fred could not say why, but that thought gave him hope.</p><p>“Fred!”</p><p>Fred was startled out of his reverie by George and Ron, both of whom were running towards him.</p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>“We can’t find Harry.”</p><p>“Oh, bollocks.”</p><p>~*~</p><p>Pansy woke up many hours later, and the first thing she noticed was that she was in the Hospital Wing. She had never been a patient in the Hospital Wing before. The first thing that struck her was how much more comfortable the beds were here than those horrible rubber-on-wooden-plank numbers they had at St Mungo’s.</p><p>“Ahh, Parkinson.” Pansy looked up to see the serious face of Madam Pomfrey looking down at her. “You’re awake. Excellent.”</p><p>“Yeah, I…” Pansy remembered, with a panicked jolt, where she had been and what she had been doing before she lost consciousness. “Oh, sweet Salazar! The war! The battle! What happened?”</p><p>“Shhh. Try to relax.” Madam Pomfrey indicated a block of chocolate on Pansy’s bedside table. “You’ll be eating all of that in a moment. But, yes, the battle is over. You-Know-Who has been defeated.”</p><p>“De… defeated?” Pansy repeated. She could hardly believe it. Ever since the Dark Lord had risen, she had been almost entirely certain that he would eventually take over the Wizarding World. At first, she was keen on the idea. It was about time, she thought, that Mudbloods and Blood Traitors were put in their place. But, over the past few years, as the Dark Lord grew more powerful, the world around her grew darker, her mother grew sicker, her father grew angrier, and she and her friends enjoyed fewer laughs, her thoughts on a world ruled by the Dark Lord started to change.</p><p>Now that he was gone, she felt none of the anguish or loss she thought she would feel. In fact, more than anything else, she felt relieved.</p><p>“That’s correct,” Madam Pomfrey said, bringing Pansy out of her reverie. “Unfortunately, I do not know most of the details, but I’m sure your peers will fill you in when you’re free to go home.”</p><p>“My peers…” Pansy repeated. “Do you know what happened to Draco, Madam Pomfrey?”</p><p>“Draco Malfoy?” Madam Pomfrey asked. “I believe he and his parents escaped before the battle was over.”</p><p>“I see.” Pansy frowned. “But, he must have come back for me. Nobody else would have brought me to the Hospital Wing.”</p><p>Pomfrey raised an eyebrow at her patient. “It was not Mr Malfoy who found you.”</p><p>“Really? Who was it?”</p><p>“They asked me not to say,” Madam Pomfrey answered, and Pansy could have sworn she saw a twinkle of amusement in the matron’s eye. “I can tell you that it was a former student, however. A Gryffindor.”</p><p>“A Gryffindor? Are you serious?” Pansy could not have been more surprised if Madam Pomfrey had told her that the Giant Squid had rescued her. “But, why? Surely they must all hate me, after what I did.”</p><p>“You mean your little moment in the Great Hall?” Pomfrey asked. “I would like to believe that most people will recognise that as a short moment of panic on your part. And even if they do not, somebody evidently saw enough good in you to think that you were worth saving.”</p><p>Pansy did not respond to that. She could not think of anything adequate to say.</p><p>~*~</p>
