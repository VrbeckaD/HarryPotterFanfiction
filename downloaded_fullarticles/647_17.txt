    <p>Cho Chang is just one witch in a society on the brink of war. Her parents are worried. Her friend is scared. Cho mourns for living and grieves for the future. The witch isn’t happy about her life right now and she must survive, if not for herself, then for others. She always was a clever girl. Little Ravenclaws and pretty Quidditch Seekers can take action too. Cho shakes off being the romantic write-off of boys and rises as a steadfast and determined individual.</p><p> </p><p>Unspeakables have access to the darkest secrets of the Ministry and of magic itself. A few strategic conversations later, Cho is the newest hire. It helps of course, that she is a brilliant researcher and skilled in magic beyond that average Hogwarts graduate. She begins work immediately, taking in everything she can. She knows time is running short and she needs answers.</p><p> </p><p>Cho gets a small flat in a muggle complex a few streets away from Diagon Alley. Her wards keep her safe and her secrets safer. A few lucky muggleborns escape with her help, fleeing to safer shores. A few months later, Cho must prove her loyalty to the new regime. Magic is Might. Her blood is pure and her magic even purer in its vivisecting execution. She feels chilled to her soul and no <em>evanesco</em> can Vanish this guilt away.</p><p> </p><p>The war is subtler than she expects, less overt than she anticipated. Secret radio broadcasts remind her to keep going, to keep saving who she can. Every conversation could be monitored, doublespeak, hidden meanings. Her work drags her deeper into twisted ingenuity. Lives become numbers and her balance rarely favors those she intended to help. If only life was simpler, if only, if only.</p><p> </p><p>Now each research project comes with another sacrifice, another piece of her sweetness gone. Will she still smile when this is over? Cho rises to each challenge. She has to. No matter the deaths that haunt her, no matter the pain and suffering. She must continue. Cho stumbles, she falls, but she moves past the sorrow. Maybe one day she can pick up all her missing pieces but for today she must simply survive.</p><p> </p><p>Voldemort falls and Cho takes a deep breath. Is this what success feels like? She mingles with the remaining members of Dumbledore’s Army, reveling in the feeling of camaraderie and life. Too many were lost, and too many have died but she is here and Hogwarts is here and perhaps everything will be okay once more.</p><p> </p><p>Yet, the death of one powerful man does not fix the systematic problems of a society. Not everything is okay. Cho doesn’t think there really ever was an okay, just her childish naivety and the illusions of magic. She is alive though, and she will not let her tears go to waste.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Children die so easily. Cho has come to acknowledge this as fact. People die. Everything dies. For all her skill in magic, she cannot bring back the dead and she cannot let herself relax. She is fixated on the pursuit of knowledge and she doesn't know how to stop. Marietta wants her to take a break, to come home at a more reasonable hour, to open up once more. Her parents want her to start a family of her own. Cho can barely manage to feed herself, let alone acknowledge that somewhere along the line of magical research she forgot that some boundaries weren’t meant to be crossed.</p><p> </p><p>For all her intrapersonal emotions, Cho isn’t so great at picking up the suffering of those around her. Perhaps she’s become numb to the pain of others? Everyone seems to be in pain these days. Healing is so much harder than harming. Cho loses her parents first. While pureblooded, her parents were never quite as good at defense as she was. Too trusting, too forgiving, too quick to believe in those who turn over a new leaf. “A lone Death Eater” states the Auror, as if that explains everything. The war was over, so why did her parents have to die? The last thing she said to her mother was that she needed space. Cho has too much space now. She is so cold and so tired.</p><p> </p><p>Marietta goes next. She couldn’t keep being the light in Cho’s life and the darling her parents wanted. She never was as hardy as Cho in weathering harsh words. Marietta’s parents mysteriously die in a freak Floo accident some months after Cho finds Marietta collapsed on the sofa, vials carelessly dropped from her small hands, never to awaken again. Unspeakable Chang was accounted for at the time, however, and her wand is clean of any foul play. What an unfortunate death for such a good family. The Edgecombe line is gone, just like so many other pureblood lines. What the war didn’t cull, the aftershocks do.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Cho is a witch of her own making. She is more than a hero’s love interest, more than a tragic figure. Wit beyond measure, her own greatest treasure. Cho is a witch going places, with tears for futures lost and the grit to keep on going. She doesn’t know how to stop after all.</p>
