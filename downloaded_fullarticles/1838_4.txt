    <p>
  <span>Two weeks.  He’d been here two weeks so far. Twenty years was an eternity, broken down into hours and days and weeks, but what else could he do?  Harry stared blindly up at the concrete block ceiling above him. His grey jumpsuit scratched against the thin rough brown blanket underneath him.  He could hear the patrols moving through the prison, the chatter of the other inmates as they traded information and threats. He shivered, curling over onto his side, his back to the open door of the cell and the empty bed on the other end.  He took a deep breath, hoping that if he just held his breath, he could will away the tears that welled up in his eyes. Two weeks since they shoved him in this box, but it was three months since his life ended. Losing the battle against gravity, he quickly wiped away the escaping tears.  He couldn’t let the other criminals know how weak he was. (But I’m not a criminal!) (But here you are, Harry. Locked up like all the other monsters in this hellhole) Even the voice in his head was mocking and harsh. He took several more breaths, in through the nose, and out through the mouth, just like his anger management counsellor had taught him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry froze when he heard a group of four pairs of booted feet stop right outside his cell.  He quickly pushed himself until he was sitting on his bed and cautiously eyed the group of guards, through his unruly mop of black hair.  The one in the front, McLaggen, smirked. “Vacation is over, Potter. Your roomie is back from the hole, congratulations! Or is it condolences? I’m not a college boy like you, I don’t know those big words.” Every word was sneered, thrown like weapon.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry’s shoulders curled, and he wrapped his arms around his stomach.  He nodded quietly. One of the other guards stepped around McLaggen’s blond bulk, and shoved a thin, dark haired man to the other bed. “Play nice this time, Black. Screw up again and it won’t be a year in the hole, it’ll be forever.” The darker haired guard grinned at the threat, then continued. “Give me an excuse. We all know why you’re here.” He spat on the ground in front of the other prisoner, glared at Harry and they withdrew, shutting the door behind them.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The younger man looked nervously at the door, then his new cellmate.  None of the other doors had been closed yet, but it wasn’t the first time he’d been locked in early.  He studied the other man nervously. He also wore the grey jumpsuit, but it wasn’t done up the front like Harry’s.  His was open to the waist, displaying a white wife beater tank top, and dozens of tattoos. The blue-black lines showed through the thin fabric of his shirt, as did an impressive collection of lean muscles.  Harry’s eyes traced up to the older man’s face, noting the warm tan of his skin, and stuttering to a stop on his cold grey eyes surrounded by deep set crows feet. He looked like he was at least twice Harry’s age, likely around forty. “Like what you see, kid?” Harry froze like a rabbit, not sure which answer was the safest. “Name’s Sirius Black.  What’s yours?” Black scooted back, leaning against the wall, one leg bent at the knee, the other extended off the edge of his bed. His voice was scratchy from disuse.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Um. Uh, Harry.  Harry Potter.” He stuttered over his words, his fear clear in his voice.  Harry looked down at his blanket, picking at a loose thread. Sirius’s eyes widened, and he stared at the kid across from him, quickly cataloguing his features. He cast his eyes up to the ceiling, then looked back at the younger man, and gave a loud bark of a laugh.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Who the hell did you piss off to get put in here with me?” His eyes gleamed with madness, his grin too wide to be friendly.  His teeth looked sharper than normal, and the air in the cell crackled with electricity. “Sweet lookin’ boy like you... and they put you in my room?  Hah!” He cackled until he started coughing, then settled, leaning back against the wall.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry rubbed his arms, trying to smooth out the goosebumps covering him. “I guess.. I guess everyone.” He looked away, studying the cell across the narrow hall.  No one was sitting in there, so he studied their beds, trying not to look at the madman sharing his cell.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You must have...” He laughed, the hint of madness now an overwhelming wave of insanity.  Harry stole a peek at the other man out of the corner of his eye, not wanting to get caught staring again.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Before they could continue, a bell rang and the rest of the prisoners made their way back to their cells.  The chatter seemed louder today than it did yesterday, but Harry was half convinced that was just his imagination.  As soon as the pair that lived across the hall slipped into their cell, the doors all clanged shut. Rod, a tall brunet in his mid thirties, laughed when he saw Black. “So, rumors were true, they let you out! How long you gonna stay out this time, Black?” He taunted the other man, a mean grin on his face.  “How are you gonna get sent back down this time? Murder again?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius turned his maniacal grin on Rod, finally looking away from Harry’s profile. “Wait and see, Roddy, maybe you’ll get to find out up--,” he paused, moving faster than Harry thought possible, to grab the bars directly across from Rod. “close and personal....” Harry could see him lick his lips, and smile with too many teeth.  He glanced back to Rod, still curled up with his arms around his knees on his bed.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rod shivered and walked away, muttering. “Whatever, you’re gonna be gone in another month anyway. Never lasted longer than that outta the hole.” </span>
