    <p align="center">Harry Malfoy’s Life</p><p align="center">Chapter One: An Annoyed Beginning</p><p>Harry Malfoy stared at this wisp of his grandfather. The small teen couldn’t help but smirk and chuckle coldly. <em>“Join you? A wisp who is barely alive? No. I know who my true family is, Grandfather, and you are not part of it.”</em></p><p><em>“You will regret this, Malfoy,” </em>the wisp of Voldemort said angrily, and the next second he was gone along with the unusual coldness. Harry felt back to his bed, now noticing the rapid, frantic beatings of his heart, and the cold sweat on his brow. Still shivering, he left his room and headed into Draco’s.</p><p>“Draco?” he said, his voice surprisingly small.</p><p>“Come in,” Draco called out. Harry opened the door and walked in. His nose automatically scrunched. For some reason the room smelt slightly musky and Draco looked out of breath, his cheeks pink and hair messed up. “What’s up?” he said.</p><p>Harry wanted to ask Draco about the weird smell, but he didn’t want to get distracted. “My grandfather was just in my room,” he said, feeling slightly dissociated as he heard himself saying these words.</p><p>“What!?” Draco yelled. “Where is he?”</p><p>Draco ran towards Harry, intending to obviously confront Harry’s grandfather, but Harry stopped him. “He’s gone now. You won’t find him.”</p><p>“What did he want from you? Did he hurt you?”</p><p>“No… but he… he heard about what I’ve done, in the Chamber,” Harry said. “And he asked me to join him…”</p><p>“You refused right?” Draco asked.</p><p>“Of course I did! There’s no way I leave you Draco!” Harry said, and he quickly engulfed his brother in a hug. “I love you too much,” he said.</p><p>He buried his head in Draco’s shoulder, and felt an unusual heat rise from Draco. It was just now that Harry noticed that Draco was unusually dressed. Instead of his usual robes, Draco was wearing an undershirt and… are those shorts? “Draco… what are you wearing?” Harry asked slowly.</p><p>Blushing softly, Draco took a step back. “Why don’t… why don’t you tell mother and father… about your grandfather… and I’ll change real quick, yeah?” he said hopefully.</p><p>Harry stared at him but shrugged. He figured that Draco will tell him when he’s ready. In the meantime, Harry moved quickly to find Mr. and Mrs. Malfoy. They were both in a back room, looking out into the back gardens. Mr. Malfoy heard Harry approaching and turned towards him. “Is anything the matter?” he asked.</p><p>“Grandfather was in my room, he wanted me to join him but I told him no,” Harry blurted out.</p><p>“The Dark Lord?” Mr. Malfoy gasped.</p><p>“You won’t find him, he’s gone… just thought that I should tell you,” Harry said.</p><p>“Are you injured?” Mrs. Malfoy asked.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Dumbledore needs to hear about this,” Mrs. Malfoy said. “If the Dark Lord can just come into our home—”</p><p>“I don’t think he’ll come back… at least he won’t come back here,” Harry said.</p><p>“Still he needs to know,” Mrs. Malfoy said. “Go to Draco’s room, I don’t want you sleeping in your room tonight just in case.”</p><p>Harry frowned, but said nothing. He understood why Mr. and Mrs. Malfoy were so worried, and, for some reason, could not find the strength or motivation to argue. He returned to Draco’s room only to see that the door was closed, even though he left it open. Curious to see what his brother was trying to hide from him, Harry slowly reached for the handle and slowly turned it, trying to be as silent as possible. Then he slowly, ever so slowly, pushed the door open, smiling when he did not hear any creaks or shrieks from the door.</p><p>When the door was wide enough, he poked his head in and looked around.</p><p>Draco was sitting on his bed, still dressed in the undershirt and shorts. Next to him were small slightly rusty weights, and he was constantly lifting two into the air and down again. <em>Exercising? Since when did Draco do that? </em>Harry thought to himself. This was what Draco was hiding from him? Walking into the room fully, he decided to watch his brother for a bit.</p><p>Draco was sweating, that much was obvious as his hair stuck to his head, and his arms looked to be straining and… bigger. Not by a lot, not even by a little big, but they were bigger if Harry squinted his eyes. Taking a step closer, Harry watched Draco go through his exercises, his positions switching at times in order to reach different muscle groups. It was during one of these switches that he saw Harry. “Harry!” he said, dropping the weights in surprise, both of them thankfully falling onto the bed.</p><p>“So this is what you were doing?” Harry asked casually. He wanted to forget about his grandfather.</p><p>“Y-yeah… Charlie sent them to me…” Draco said. Harry hummed and went on Draco’s bed.</p><p>“Don’t stop because I’m here,” he said. “I’m staying with you tonight so, go on.” He smiled and tried to look as relaxed as he could. Draco seemed hesitant, but after a while he continued his exercises while Harry lounged on his bed.</p><p>They were both silent, the only sound in the room were Draco’s occasional grunts and breaths. Harry watched his brother, and for some reason his lips were drying quickly as his tongue kept darting out to lick them. When Draco was done, his shirt was drenched in sweat and stuck to his chest and stomach as he stretched. Harry watched as Draco left the room to take a bath.</p><p> </p><p>Harry stayed with Draco for the rest of the summer. Even when both Mr. and Mrs. Malfoy were certain that Harry’s grandfather wouldn’t come out, and Dumbledore had come to personally make sure the home’s wards were strong enough to repel him, Harry still stayed in Draco’s room. He liked staying with Draco in his bed, it reminded Harry of when they were younger and slept together. It helped that Draco continued the tradition of picking out Harry’s clothes, too.</p><p>The day after Harry turned thirteen (he spent the day with Draco and Blaise), both Malfoys got their letters from Hogwarts, which, surprisingly, included an extra piece of parchment that read:</p><p>
  <em>Dear Mr. Malfoy,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Please note that Third Years are permitted to visit the village of Hogsmeade on certain weekends. Please give the enclosed permission form to your parent or guardian to sign.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>A list of books for next year is enclosed,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Yours sincerely,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Professor M. McGonagall</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Deputy Headmistress</em>
</p><p>Harry placed the list of books to the side to look at Draco. “We can visit Hogsmeade,” he said.</p><p>“Perfect place for dates, from what I heard,” Draco smirked and winked at Harry. Harry rolled his eyes, his cheeks feeling a little hot. “Come on Harry, let’s get our permission forms signed,” he said.</p><p>“Alright Draco,” Harry said. The two went out to find their parents, who were eating their breakfast in the dining room, and showed them the letters.</p><p>“Ah, yes,” Mr. Malfoy said. He snapped his fingers and a house-elf appeared. He ordered the elf to get a quill and ink bottle, and a few minutes later both permission forms were signed and sealed. “Since you two have your list, we might as well go get your new books today,” Mr. Malfoy said.</p><p>Harry looked at Draco, suddenly getting an idea. “Father,” he said, “if it is alright with you… can Draco and I go by ourselves? I want to spend the day with him… alone.”</p><p>Mr. Malfoy examined the two of them. “Very well,” he said. “Allow me to get some money—”</p><p>“Don’t worry about that,” Harry said. “We’ll use mine.”</p><p>“Yours?” Mr. Malfoy asked, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>“The Potter Vault…”</p><p>“Which is under my control until you are of age,” Mr. Malfoy said.</p><p>“I have my key,” Harry shot back. Mr. Malfoy gave the two boys a sharp glare.</p><p>“One hundred Galleons,” he said. “You are allowed only one hundred Galleons. Believe me, I will know if you take more out.”</p><p>“Don’t worry Father, we’ll be good,” Harry said, giving Mr. Malfoy a smile. “Now you two don’t need to worry about us and focus on Violet… and sleep.”</p><p>“Thank you for the sentiment… I think,” Mr. Malfoy said slowly.</p><p>“Try and be back before dinner, boys,” Mrs. Malfoy said. “And boys? No going into Knockturn Alley.”</p><p>“We won’t mother,” Harry said.</p><p>“Good. Have a good day then, boys,” Mrs. Malfoy said.</p><p>“Yes, and come home on time,” Mr. Malfoy said, and he gave Harry a stern look. Both boys nodded and quickly walked out of the dining room.</p><p>“We’re going to spend the day together? Since when?” Draco asked, smiling slyly.</p><p>“Since now,” Harry said. “I need some air… and I don’t want to be with mother and father while we shop. They’ll just crowd us.”</p><p>“Well… at least you and father aren’t fighting like last year,” Draco said. “That was horrible, if I can be honest.”</p><p>Harry just hummed and took Draco’s hand in his own. “There’s another reason why I wanted it to be just us,” he smiled.</p><p>“Really?” Draco asked, his voice dropping lower.</p><p>“Yeah,” Harry smiled. “I want to hear all about you working out. I can see some progress,” he pointed to the small biceps now on Draco’s thin arms, “but I want to know about why.”</p><p>“Interested in my muscles Harry? All you have to do is ask, and I’ll show ‘em to you,” Draco smirked. Harry rolled his eyes and pulled Draco along towards the back room where the floo powder was stored.</p><p>Ten minutes later found the boys walking through the archway into Diagon Alley. Still holding hands, they look more akin to a young couple then step-brothers. They made their way to Gringotts, both boys looking into the windows to see if anything caught their eyes. They’ve gotten some odd looks, a few older witches and wizards sneered at the sight of them, but Harry found that he didn’t care. Draco just squeezed his hand and smirked at him, “So wife,” he said, bringing up an old childhood joke, “what are we going to do today?”</p><p>“Get my money first, husband,” Harry said.</p><p>Draco laughed loudly and kissed Harry’s cheek. “Sounds like a plan Harry,” he said. “Though I wish that you’d at least let me pay for something.”</p><p>Harry just hummed and shrugged. “No,” he said. “Today’s my day to pay for everything, come on.”</p><p>They went into Gringotts and two nausea-induced cart rides later, they left the bank with small satchel full with exactly one hundred gold Galleons. Walking down the crowded streets of Hogsmeade, Harry looked over at Draco and said, “You know, you never told me what classes you’re taking.”</p><p>During their second year, they were allowed to choose at least two additional classes to attend on top of their core subjects. Harry, influenced by Ron and what Fred and George told him, chose Care of Magical Creatures and Divination. Mostly because according to the twins and everyone else, they were the easiest.</p><p>“I haven’t?” Draco frowned.</p><p>“Nope,” Harry said. “Maybe you were too busy with Charlie’s gifts,” he snickered to himself.</p><p>“Well… I’m taking Care of Magical Creatures, Divination, and Arithmancy,” Draco said. “How about you, Harry?”</p><p>“Just Care of Magical Creatures and Divination,” Harry said. “Seems easy enough in my opinion.” Draco rolled his eyes. “Hey! Beats Arithmancy,” Harry said. “Sounds like the most boring thing I’ve ever heard!”</p><p>“Well I’m taking it, so what does that say about me?” Draco smirked.</p><p>“That you’re a little more boring then I thought you were of course,” Harry chuckled. Draco gave him a mocked hurt look which caused Harry to laugh. They’ve gotten more stares and looks of disapproval, but again Harry ignored them. He was with Draco, screw what everyone else thought. “Well, since we’re talking about subjects, we might as well get our spellbooks,” he said. Pulling out his list, he said, “Which ones do we need again…” He read the list out loud, “<em>The Standard Book of Spells Grade 3, Intermediate Transfiguration, The Essential Defense Against the Dark Arts, Unfogging the Future </em>and, <em>The Monster Book of Monsters. </em>…Monster Book of Monsters? What does that mean?”</p><p>“I do not know,” Draco said. “However… oh god.” They reached the bookshop and looked in at the window. Instead of the usual display of gold-embossed spellbooks the size of paving slabs, there was a large iron cage behind the glass that held about a hundred copies of green leathered books titled <em>The Monster Book of Monsters</em>. Torn pages were flying everywhere as the books grappled with each other, locked together in furious wrestling matches and snapping aggressively.</p><p>“Whoever decided these books would be good for our class must be a complete nutter,” Draco said, and Harry nodded with him. As they entered Flourish and Blotts, the manager came hurrying toward them.</p><p>“Hogwarts?” he said abruptly. “Come to get your new books?”</p><p>“Yes,” Harry said, “We need—”</p><p>“Get out of the way,” the manager said impatiently, brushing Harry aside. He drew on a pair of very thick gloves, picked up a large, knobbly walking stick, and proceeded toward the door of the <em>Monster Books’</em> cage. Harry and Draco watched, with both horror and slight amusement, as the manager wrestled two books out of the cage and beat them senselessly with the walking stick until they stopped snapping. Then he took some thick rope and wrapped it around both books heavily.</p><p>“I’m never stocking them again, never! It’s been bedlam! I thought we’d seen the worst when we brought two hundred copies of the <em>Invisible Book of Invisibility</em>—cost a fortune, and we never found them. …Well… is there anything else I can hep you with?”</p><p>“Erm… we’ll find the rest of the books by ourselves, thank you,” Harry said.</p><p>“Suit yourself,” the manager shrugged and he left the two alone. The two Malfoys walked around the bookstore, finding and getting their school books and half an hour later they were out of the door, books in bags and the <em>Monster Book of Monsters</em> strapped up in various ropes and buckles to keep it from snapping.</p><p>They next went to Madam Malkin’s for new robes as Draco somehow shot up half a foot over the summer. Harry too have grown, but he was still obviously smaller than his brother. With their new robes and books in hand, their last stop was the Apothecary where they replenished their store of potion ingredients.</p><p>It was barely after twelve by the time they were done, and Harry did not want to leave yet. Smiling to Draco, he took the Slytherin’s hand and said, “Let’s go eat something, I’m famished!”</p><p>Draco agreed, and they quickly went to Florean Fortescue’s Ice Cream Parlor. “So,” Harry said after the two of them gotten their ice cream and found a table outside, “what do you want to do after this?”</p><p>“Well, you’re the one in charge of this date today, aren’t you?” Draco said a little too loudly as several adults all turned to stare at them, looking scandalized. Harry did not notice them as he shrugged, licking his ice cream cone. “We could check out the Quidditch shop,” Draco suggested.</p><p>“Sounds like a plan,” Harry smiled. He leaned forward and whispered, “And after that… I want to head to Knockturn Alley!”</p><p>“Harry—”</p><p>“Come on! Father never let us go there,” Harry whined. “I won’t buy anything, I just want to look.”</p><p>“Fine,” Draco sighed. He took off his glasses and squinted at them before cleaning the lens with the bottom of his shirt. “You would think we would have made up a spell by now for cleaning them,” he muttered to himself. “How are your glasses?” he asked Harry.</p><p>“Fine,” Harry hummed, but Draco snatched them off his face.</p><p>“Fine!? They’re disgusting!” Draco sneered. “How on earth can you see through these things?”</p><p>“I can see you well enough,” Harry smiled, earning him both a kiss on the cheek and a slap on the shoulder. He laughed as Draco cleaned his glasses.</p><p>When they were done with their ice cream, the two went to Quality Quidditch Supplies, where there was a crowd inside. Curious as to what they were staring at, Harry and Draco nudged their way in until they glimpsed a newly erected podium, on which was mounted the most magnificent broom they had ever seen in their life.</p><p>“Just come out—prototype—” a square-jawed wizard was telling his companion.</p><p>“It’s the fastest broom in the world, isn’t it, Dad?” squeaked a boy younger than Harry, who was swinging off his father’s arm.</p><p>“Irish International Side’s just put in an order for seven of these beauties!” the proprietor of the shop told the crowd. “And they’re favorites for the World Cup!”</p><p>A large witch moved in front of Harry and he was able to read the sign next to the broom:</p><p align="center">
  <strong>
    <em>THE FIREBOLT</em>
  </strong>
</p><p align="center">
  <strong>
    <em>The state-of-the-art pracing broom sports a stream-lined superfine handle of ash, treated with a diamond-hard polish and hand-numbered with its own registration number. Each individually selected birch twig in the broomtail has been honed to aerodynamic perfection, giving the FIREBOLT unsurpassable balance and pinpoint precision. The FIREBOLT has an acceleration of 150 miles an hour in ten seconds and incorporates an unbreakable Braking Charm. Price on Request.</em>
  </strong>
</p><p>“Wow… must be very expensive,” Harry said. He did not want to think how much gold the Firebolt would cost. Besides, he has a perfectly good Nimbus Two-Thousand that Sirius brought for him, and he hadn’t lost with it yet. The two boys stared at the broom for nearly half an hour before leaving the shop.</p><p>Harry practically dragged Draco towards Knockturn Alley afterwards. “Come on,” he kept saying, “Father won’t find out! Besides, you’re a Slytherin, you’ll be practically at home here.”</p><p>“Funny Harry, very funny,” Draco sneered as they made their way down the stone steps into the dark alleyway.</p><p>“Besides, father and mother goes here for business stuff, yeah?” Harry smiled. The alley wasn’t crowded, though they did pass a few witches and wizards here and there, their heads down and heavily cloaked as if they did not want to be easily identified. Draco just glared at Harry as the boy looked around excitedly. They were never allowed to go to Knockturn Alley, even though their house was full of Dark Objects, and Mr. Malfoy had semi-regular meetings there of unknown business.</p><p>Harry stopped at one shop and stared at it. “Draco, look at this,” he said. He was pointing to a small shop where various earrings, studs, and piercings hung in a window, all with different effects written under them in slanty-writing. “’Earring of Hearing,’” Harry read, “’Makes the wearer deaf for as long as the earring is in place.’ Ouch, who would want an earring like that?”</p><p>“It’s not for the buyer, Harry,” Draco sighed. “It’s for whoever the buyer gives, probably as a joke or something. Tell me that you aren’t thinking—”</p><p>“No, why would I go here? Diagon Alley has a perfectly good piercing shop I saw,” Harry said. “Just didn’t expect to see a shop here too…”</p><p>Harry! That’s not what I meant,” Draco groaned. “Mother and Father would kill you if you get a piercing!”</p><p>“Don’t you think I know that?” Harry snorted. “I’m not going to get one, but that can’t stop me of thinking of getting one.” Harry shrugged and looked around some more. “I guess that there really is only shops filled with Dark Objects here,” he said. Draco stared at him, shocked. Why does he sound <em>disappointed</em>?</p><p>Harry sighed and smiled at Draco. “Come on, let’s go back,” he said.</p><p>“Why did we even come here in the first place?” Draco asked as the two started their way back to Diagon Alley.</p><p>“I just wanted to check it out,” Harry said. “And…well…”</p><p>“Please tell me you’re not ac—”</p><p>“No, no, I am <em>not</em> like my Grandfather,” Harry said shortly. “I just thought that…if I go here now, get surrounded by these Dark Arts nonsense before the school year begins…I’d get it over with and actually have a normal school year for a change!”</p><p>“That would be nice,” Draco said considerably. “Not having to deal with your grandfather or giant snakes caused by the memory of your grandfather… just having to deal with normal stuff.”</p><p>“Like tests,” Harry chimed in. “And detention.”</p><p>“I swear if you get detention this year—”</p><p>“I’ll make sure you serve it with me,” Harry smirked. Draco have Harry a sharp look which made the raven-haired laugh. “Don’t worry Draco, I promise to be your good boy,” he said.</p><p>“Good,” Draco said, and, in public, he wrapped an arm around Harry. “Because you are <em>mine</em>, Harry, no matter what Blaise says.”</p><p>Harry didn’t know how to respond to that, his cheeks began blazing and heart beating very rapidly. The people around them were glaring openly now, and Harry finally took notice. He bit his lip and did his best to step away from his step-brother. “We should go home,” Harry said, his voice high and cracking.</p><p>“Yeah, sure… alright,” Draco said. They did not hold hands on the way home, or did they ever hold hands for the rest of the summer.</p><p>Harry moved back into his bedroom and did his best to avoid touching Draco whenever he could help it. The blond, though, had different plans as he tried everyday to slip Harry’s hand in his, sit in a way that their thighs are touching, and even suggest they take a quick shower together like they did when they were kids after a round of Quidditch with Blaise. Every time Draco suggested them bathing together, Harry’s cheeks and neck flared up to a rosy-red, his heart began beating violently and he felt a very strange and tightening situation at his groin. He couldn’t explain it and was too scared to talk to anyone about it.</p><p>The only saving grace during these times were Harry’s thoughts. Recently Sirius and Lupin told the boys that Dumbledore offered Lupin the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor, which the man accepted. Thinking of that usually filled his heated, confused excitement with an innocent excitement of Lupin teaching. If that didn’t work, however, Harry quickly thought of Parkinson or Bullstrode and his heat went away almost immediately.</p><p>The Summer was over before both boys knew it. One moment Harry was in his room, making sure that he had everything he needed for Hogwarts, and, by the time a random blink has begun and ended, in that Nano-second of darkness with his eyelids fully closed, Harry was on the Hogwarts Express in a compartment with Ron, Hermione, Draco, and Blaise, on his way to his third year of Hogwarts, which he hoped would be a normal one.</p>
