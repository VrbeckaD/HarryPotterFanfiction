    <p>There were two boys in Wool's Orphanage who were quite unlike the other children and quite unlike each other, despite what their appearance might suggest. With their dark hair and pale skin Tom Riddle and Haydn Peverell could have been brothers, but they weren't at least not in the conventional sense. Brothers in arms perhaps.  </p><p>Tom was the older and his eyes were a dark sort of dead. Smooth river stones, made to gleaming perfection beneath the crush of cold water. Even at two years old he was different. He never smiled or laughed and his angel face was a rippling reflection to his stone eye. He was a cherub statue, lovely and cold to the touch. But beneath his cool mantel he ran molten. And the truth was the boy's soul was fire, bright and beautiful, but dangerous and terribly quick to ignite. A force to level cities and decimate populations. Speedy desolation.  </p><p>Haydn in temperament was his Tom's opposite. Where his Tom was passion he was apathy. Where Tom's essence burn, burn, <em>burned</em> Haydn's creeped and crawled, crushing mountains, carving valleys, an advancing glacier. Slow devastation. But his veneer was quite bubbly. He sometimes babbled at nothing, a sweet smile curving baby lip and opening to reveal milk teeth peeking through pink gums. Sometimes he waved his little arms as if saying a baby's greeting to someone who was not there. He was quite adorable if one over looked the way he stared. His beryl eyes held something dark, cold and timeless. And if one gazed into them for too long they would feel the same crushing emptiness felt gazing at the gaps between stars. </p><p>They were never adopted. When families came looking and saw the boy with stone eyes and the other whose gaze held life and death they turned away because even with those lovely faces the boys were different. And different in a time and place like this was not to be coveted. It was to be feared. The matrons called them monster boys, freaks, and devil spawn. And as Tom and Haydn grew they grew close together and far from the others.  </p><p>The monster boys were victims as often as they took them. For every bruise they gave they received one, for every strange accident a ruler was taken to the palms of their hands. But by four and five they were mostly left alone and eventually moved out of the nursery to a room on the top floor of the old drafty building.  Being on the top floor their room was far away from the other orphanage occupants, the matrons included.  </p><p>Their first night there a group of older boys confronted them. Outside the nursery there was a hierarchy that the boys intended to enforce. The next day the nurse's room was full and Tom and Haydn were left alone again, for a while, on the top of the food chain. But kids are dumb and they like to push their luck so the boys just kept reminding them, and the nurses room was never empty. </p><p>Moving out wasn't such a big change for the two. The matrons still averted their eyes from the boys, though their whispers persisted. The bullies came and went, often worse for wear. And it was in those formative years Tom and Haydn learned two things. The first of course, was never get caught. They snatched and snuck, stole and stashed. But Mrs. Cole's eyes were surprisingly keen, her ruler stiff as ever, and of course the bathrooms could always use a good cleaning. But the boys learned to be quick and quiet and to hide in her periphery or alcoholic stupor if the occasion presented its self </p><p>The second lesson was to <em>neve</em><em>r</em> lash out. It only lead to further punishment or gave some of the older kid the satisfaction of reaction. Lashing out meant losing control. It was far better to bide time and slip like poison through the halls of the orphanage if retribution was in order. </p><p> </p><p>When Tom had returned to his room one day after using the bathroom to find his brother's bruised and swollen face he had, in fury, smashed everything he could in the room before collapsing to the floor head bowed. Haydn had then stood and approached him through the mess. </p><p>"Do you feel better" </p><p>Tom looked up. His brother hadn't flinched when he spoke despite the inflammation around his mouth and jaw. </p><p>"No of course not," was Toms reply. </p><p>"You lost control," </p><p>"I can't stop people from hurting you." </p><p>"You know the rules Tom, but you.." </p><p>Tom sighed and looked back to the mess he made. </p><p>"They hurt you again... But that’s no excuse. I'm sorry. I'll take your chores for the week" </p><p>It was Haydn's turn to sigh. </p><p>"It won't happen again right. They like it when you react. You can't give them that not even in private. Not until we find a home for ourselves. Somewhere we can just be." </p><p>Tom nodded and smiled. He often dreamed about that. About a home just for the two of them no ugly children or matrons to hurt and nag them.   </p><p>Tom snapped back to reality, just in time to see his brother's lips turn up at the corners. </p><p> "What?"</p><p>"Would you like to help me? Educate the masses of course. They never learn and it might help you blow of some steam." </p><p>Tom watched as his brothers previously listless expression sharpened. It was true rage, not often seen on Haydn's face. Haydn was the one who always shied away from conflict. Not a pacifist, but usually If something bad happened to him Haydn let it go and it was Toms pleasure to take revenge. They must have said something about Tom to get Haydn this riled up. His brother was fiercely protective of him.  </p><p>He noticed now Haydn's fists were clenched trembling even, despite his brother's calm features. And in his eyes a sharp dangerous thing Tom had never seen before was revealed. It must have been bad. Worse than usual to get Haydn so emotional. Before he had really thought about it he had always assumed his brother's absent demeanor was escapism, and in a way, it was. It leads to his passivity, but now it was gone, and Haydn's cruel spirit was showing its self to them </p><p>"What do you have in mind?"  </p><p>Haydn's smile was a knife. </p><p>"There is bleach in the supply cupboard..."  </p><p>The next day the occupants of Wool's orphanage were startled the sounds of screaming. Apparently, three of the ten-year-old boys had been playing where they shouldn’t have and managed to lock themselves in the cleaning cupboard. As they tried to force the door open one of them knocked over the bottle of bleach, which hadn't been properly capped after its last use. Of course, the fumes of bleach are quite irritating to the skin, eyes, and lungs, not to mention it managed to soak through all three of the boys' sock. The burns were quite terrible. </p><p>Pity. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>
