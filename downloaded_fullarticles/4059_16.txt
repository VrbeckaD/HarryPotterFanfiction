    <p>Draco didn't want this. He never wanted this. And oh Merlin, was he terrified.</p><p>At this point, there was nothing he could do, but hope, which was most likely in vain. He had returned to Hogwarts against his better judgement, for eighth year. He knew it was likely that he would be outcast and ostracized but he figured he'd be fine with it. He went back there to finish his education, not to make conversation and friends for life.</p><p>Draco assumed it was too late for that anyways.</p><p>The first night back wasn't too bad, the feast was similar and welcoming, considering his entire family was now torn apart and there was no such thing as normal.</p><p>Despite the fact he didn't want to bring attention to himself, a few days before he had returned to Hogwarts from summer and community service, which was his deserving punishment from the ministry, he had decided to dye his hair none other colour than sky blue.</p><p>He wanted to part from his well known old self completely. Draco had cut off his long hair that he had been growing to please his father and dyed it an outrageous colour that "No Malfoy would ever do such an improper thing." as a grand Fuck You to his father.</p><p>Stepping into the Great Hall for the first time in a few months, which was quite wonderfully restored from the war, was an experience.</p><p>He had gotten used to the whispers by now, familiar with the insults spoken under people's breath about his undeserving freedom and his terrible acts. He knew. He knew he had done terrible things, and just wanted to escape from it.</p><p>If he could, Draco would've taken it all back.</p><p>But these whispers were different, ones, almost sounding of awe and surprise. Some were still bitter and rude but he expected nothing less.</p><p>He kept his head down and found his place at the designated eighth year table, mixed houses. He heard the low murmurs around him, seemingly floating around his head and dancing about his ears. "Is that really?- I can't believe that Malfoy kid- It's blue!- I quite like it-" The whispers persisted until McGonagall stood, ready to give the welcoming speech.</p><p>Draco was thankful for the lapse in concentration on him, everyone turning and silencing themselves to listen to the headmistress.</p><p>He caught bits and pieces of the speech but he was mainly focused on letting his eyes wander. Taking advantage of the quiet and distracted students, he moved his eyes upwards, letting them trace the beams of the Great Hall, watching them fade into the enchantment on the ceiling, which on this night, was clear and starry.</p><p>He picked out a few of the constellations he knew, he brought his eyes back downwards, letting them sweep the faces of those at the eighth year table.</p><p>Not many Slytherins had decided to come back this year, understandably so. Many of them were thought of as terrible people, even those that had nothing to do with the war. Perhaps that was why those of them were hated, for stepping back and not fighting for the good.</p><p>People didn't understand them, pureblood Slytherin families were raised for generations upon generations to be smart, to fight on the winning side.</p><p>Strategically, fighting for the Dark Lord or doing nothing at all were the best options. Draco knew he grew up misguided, he knew he had been terrible at school and especially rude to muggleborns and he regretted his actions every day since he became clear that his father had taught him wrong.</p><p>But up until then, to survive, sticking with what he had grown up with, was the smartest idea. The safest. Even his mother encouraged it.</p><p>That was all behind him now, a painful memory that followed him around, in the back of his mind and in his dreams. It taunted him and he felt helpless about it.</p><p>He scanned the table, recognizing a few fellow Slytherins among the few Ravenclaws, many Hufflepuffs, and even more Gryffindors.</p><p>Though, all together, there still weren't many of them that had returned for eighth years. Blaise Zabini had returned, and well as Pansy Parkinson and Theodore Nott, but they never really talked besides formalities. Including Draco, that was all of the Slytherins.</p><p>As for the Ravenclaws, he had never really paid them any attention, neither did he pay attention to the Hufflepuffs.</p><p>The Gryffindors were a different story when it came to Draco.</p><p>From a young age, he was always told to keep an eye on Gryffindors. They were untrustworthy, arrogant, and 'Brave is another word for stupidity.' as his family always said. So Draco always sneered at them, following what his father said because it was just easier.</p><p>At some point, he had convinced himself that Gryffindors were indeed bullheaded and incompetent. He had convinced himself that he hated them. And he hated them. Draco really did.</p><p>He didn't understand the appeal of being 'brave' and jumping into the Black Lake at two a.m. when it was fifty degrees out. He also didn't understand Potter's seemingly desperate desire to be out of bed and causing trouble all hours of the night.</p><p>But at this point, he was sick of hate, and he was sick of war and the idea that one person was better than another due to their blood status or upbringing.</p><p>Of course, he wasn't sure that he could hang around with Gryffindors for prolonged periods of time without hexing at least one, though it seemed it would be unavoidable soon, sharing a community eighth year dorm room.</p><p>So he was sure, as long as he kept his head down this year, no trouble would befall him and Draco would manage to graduate and get a job as a Healer, if anyone would have him.</p><p>Of course, because his head wasn't down, but up, did all of the trouble start.</p><p>Only when his eyes were making their way back down the table, did he snap himself away from his thoughts, the applause for the end of McGonangall's speech jarring him into the present moment.</p><p>Draco realized he was staring at something. No, at someone. A light blush of embarrassment appeared on his face as he realized he was staring at.</p><p>The Golden Child. Saint Potter. The Saviour. It wasn't only that he found himself staring at Harry Fucking Potter, himself, but it was the fact that Potter was staring back at him. Draco opened his mouth to apologize, ready to explain that he had spaced out on accident and wasn't glaring at Potter, but Potter just smiled softly at him.</p><p>Draco was so alarmed all he could do was smile weakly back, before forcing his gaze back down to the table, studying it intently.</p><p>Why was Potter staring at him? Was he even staring at him? It didn't matter, did it?</p><p>It had been strange between them, since Harry had testified and saved him from a life sentence in Azkaban. It was obvious that they weren't exactly enemies anymore, but it wasn't like they were friends.</p><p>They had barely talked, and Draco never got the chance to thank him, anyways. Harry had gotten incredibly busy, since he had defeated Voldemort, the boy never got a free moment, and he didn't want to bother him with talking of the past when Harry had so little time on his hands anyways.</p><p>Draco kept sneaking glances at Potter throughout the sorting ceremony, half hoping to catch his eye and half hoping Potter would hex him, so he at least knew where they stood.</p><p>No such luck, Potter had gotten distracted by Ron and Hermione, always by his side. He caught himself wondering what it would really be like to have such good friends. Ones that weren't made as a strategic move.</p><p>He pushed the thought aside, he wasn't here to make friends. He was here to finish school.</p><p>As the sorting ceremony went on, there were mixed emotions at the eighth year table. There was equal clapping for each house that the first years were sorted into, despite the fact that there were uneven numbers of the houses at their table. Despite the happiness that came with seeing young, new faces, innocent and not quite yet corrupted, there seemed to be a sad weight in the air that mingled with the happiness and joy of the others.</p><p>For those that fought in the war, Hogwarts was different for them now.</p><p>They saw the newly restored hallways still covered in rubble and concrete, curses reflecting off the walls. They looked at the Great Hall and remembered how it looked with all the tables pushed to the side and bodies lined up, rows upon rows with weeping people over them.</p><p>They saw death, and felt such loss, most of them barely of age. And so with the grief that still hung over them and weighed on their chests at the most random of times, there was a sense of community among the eighth years. A sense that couldn't help but be present after all of the suffering they went through collectively.</p><p>At this point, Draco was exhausted. He just wanted to eat and then get into bed.</p><p>The rest of the feast passed with a blur.</p><p>He ate quickly and then waited until the plates were cleared, standing and following the appointed eighth year prefects to their makeshift dorm. Though all the eighth years were grouped with their housemates, the Slytherins didn't really talk to one another.</p><p>Since the war, there was less camaraderie between them. There was never camaraderie in the traditional sense. Mostly, as they were taught, they were simple allies for strategic reasons. Nonetheless, seemingly the opposite of the other houses who were brought closer together by the war, the Slytherins were more shut out.</p><p>Both by one another and their fellow classmates. </p><p>In Draco's case, he sort of chose it for himself. He didn't want to risk getting hurt. And he certainly didn't want to talk about it. The war, the panic attacks, the gut wrenching nightmares. </p><p>He didn't want to risk getting close to him. As much as he desired companionship, he wanted to get done with school and out the rest of it behind him. He didn't want to be labelled as a Death Eater, though he had the telling mark on his left arm.</p><p>One that he felt plagued him every day. </p><p>Since this was a mixed house dorm and a whole new year of students, there were four prefects, one from each house. They took turns stating the rules that all of them knew, so it was just a formality, before giving them the password and showing to their dorms.</p><p>Since there weren't that many of them, and the eighth year dorms were actually quite large, they were aloud to chose who they wanted to dorm with. They were all of age and so the prefects hadn't bothered in trying to separate the dorms by gender. They knew some sneaking around would happen anyways.</p><p>Draco chose a dorm room that had the standard four beds and bathroom, but one that no one else was in as far as he could see. He didn't want to have to deal with anyone else and he figured no one would want to room with him, being an ex-death eater.</p><p>He walked in and dumped his things on the farthest bed, one near a window over looking the Black Lake.</p><p>The man admired the view for an indiscriminate amount of time, getting lost in the little ripples that he could see from the tower. As much as he was pleased with the elegance and the security of the Slytherin dorms, nothing beat this view. </p><p>When he was younger, he taught himself sign language and conversed with the merfolk to pass time or avoid studying. </p><p>He was still lost in the view when he jumped, hearing someone else in the room. He turned, and found it was none other than Saint Potter himself. He ran a hand through his sky blue hair, pushing it out of the way as he looked at Harry.</p><p>An uncertain, but comfortable silence lingered between them as neither of them spoke for a few seconds. "'M sorry." Draco mumbled, barely meeting Harry's eyes. "I can find a different dorm." He went to pick up his things before Harry stepped forward and stopped him, a hand on his shoulder. He looked at Potter curiously. He didn't want trouble.</p><p>He had grown up.</p><p>He felt compelled to look into Harry's eyes. Something about his presence gripped him. "No, don't worry about it." The dark haired boy shook his head. "Stay, please. I'd rather room with you, actually. I think it'd be nice to just have us two." Harry shrugged sheepishly.</p><p>"I'd room with Ron and Hermione but I'm sure they'd rather have a room to themselves as well. And everyone else looks at me like I'm glass or like I'm a hero, and I'd rather not deal with that. So stay, if you want to." Harry said, looking at Draco with a look he couldn't describe would before continuing. "Besides, I think it's preferable to have peace and quiet. I've had enough of loud and rowdy to last a lifetime."</p><p>There was weight to Harry's words that was unspoken, but obvious. </p><p>Harry ran a hand through his already hopeless hair and then rubbed the back of his neck, his green eyes flashing in the moonlight. Draco was taken aback by the boy's offer for him to stay, despite the fact that Harry was there first.</p><p>And there he was again, thought Draco.</p><p>There goes Potter being nice and perfect and kind. Draco called him the Golden Boy for a reason. "Alright." The blue haired boy said. "But only because I want a quiet room, without people whispering at me." He said decidedly, setting his bag back down with a thump.</p><p>Harry nodded, not saying much more but returning to his bed, unpacking and then disappearing into the bathroom.</p><p>Draco felt weird, his lungs were uncomfortable, almost as if there was something planted in them. He attributed it to anxiety as he unpacked, organizing his things as he liked them.</p><p>He coughed a couple of times, summoning a glass of water that seemed to help for a bit. Once Harry was done brushing his teeth, Draco went into the bathroom as well, washing his face and brushing his teeth.</p><p>As he looked in the mirror, the blue hair was quite stark against the contrast of the dark bathroom tiles. He almost didn't look the same without his signature Malfoy blond hair, not that he was complaining.</p><p>He dyed it for exactly that reason. He didn't want to be seen as that person anymore.</p><p>Draco finished in the bathroom and walked out quietly to the dorm room, hearing the rhythmic breathing of Harry sleeping.</p><p>Draco got into his bed, charming the hangings of his four poster a pleasant and almost soothing, deep green colour.</p><p>He hated himself for it sometimes, but green was one of his favourite colours. He had never liked the obnoxious red that symbolized Gryffindor. He settled in, pulling the blankets up to his chest, and turned on his side.</p><p>Through a small slit in the part of his curtain, he could see Potter, sleeping peacefully. For some reason, his curtains weren't pulled around his four poster like Draco had assumed he would for privacy.</p><p>Perhaps it was the sad reality of living through a war. Especially being the famed Chosen One, he had already been through all sorts of hell, had experienced such unimaginable loss that sleeping with his curtains open wasn't something that concerned him. </p><p>He didn't mean to stare. He really didn't, but it was nice, and though it felt sort of wrong, it also felt good to watch Potter without having to worry about being seen. He noticed the way his unruly hair seemed to curl softly around his ears, the way his face looked naked and vulnerable without his glasses. Harry's hair wasn't entirely covering his forehead, but Draco could see a little of the famous scar.</p><p>It wasn't as ugly as Draco always claimed it was, the pale scar seeming to catch the light against Potter's darker skin. Though he wasn't entirely sure that Harry truly didn't like the attention, he knew how it felt to have something on your body that brought so much unwanted scrutiny.</p><p>The dark mark among his pale skin was enough to remind him of that.</p><p>He watched Potter sleep for what could have been hours, or only minutes, as he fell slowly to an uneasy sleep.</p><p>His chest felt tight, though he didn't know why and he had nameless feelings about facing this next and final year at Hogwarts, rooming with the Golden Boy of the Wizarding World. All of that slipped his mind in the hours to come as sleep overtook him, pushing him into the throes of a dream.</p>
