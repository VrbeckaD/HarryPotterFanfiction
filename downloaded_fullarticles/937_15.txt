    <p>“Stop! Leave Severus ALONE!” yelled 13- year-old Lily Evans.<br/>
“What are you gonna do about it, Evans?” spat James Potter. “Snivellus, tell your girlfriend to shut up!” James yelled at a pale boy hanging magically upside down from a tree.<br/>
“She's not my girlfriend!” The pale boy shouted back.<br/>
Lily looked as if<br/>
she had gained more confidence than she had before, in a matter of seconds. Taking a deep breath, she roared, “PUT! HIM! DOWN!”<br/>
“Wow, Evans. Didn't know you had such a-”<br/>
Remus Lupin, another boy their age calmly interrupted James, “James, please put Severus down.”James let out a dramatic amount of breath, flicked his wand, and Severus fell to the ground.<br/>
“Let’s go, Remus,” James said. James walked out proudly with his chin to the air, while Remus walked hugging his books to his chest.<br/>
“Thanks, Lily,” Severus said with a smile. “Anytime,” Lily replied.</p><p>  2 years later…</p><p>        “I can't believe he called me a mudblood! I thought we were friends,” a 15-year-old Lily sobbed into her boyfriend, James’ arms. </p><p>3 years after that...</p><p>        “So Lily… Just a random question, do you still have that grudge against Snivellus?” 18-year-old James asked his girlfriend, Lily.<br/>
“Don't call him Snivellus. I'd prefer you'd call him Severus, or at least Snape. Please. And I don't know, I still feel a little bit angry, but I feel bad,” Lily replied, rubbing her own shoulder, with a faint smile on her face. “Why do you ask?”<br/>
“Oh, no reason, just wondering,” James said back, looking into the sky, thoughtfully. “Um, how about you come to the Great Lake with me, I have something to ask you. In private.”<br/>
They walked together, holding hands. James was mouthing something to himself, but Lily couldn't make out what he was saying. Lily and James were now dating for almost 5 years now.<br/>
“Lily Evans, my flower, will you make me the happiest man on Earth, and marry me?” James was now on one knee, smiling quite nervously.<br/>
“Um…” Lily did not know what to say or do. She gazed up at the sky, then her eyes fell slowly onto a large tree. There was Severus, as usual, dangling upside down with Sirius standing below him. She looked back at James, tears in her eyes, “I can't.”She ran towards the castle sobbing.</p><p>2 days later…</p><p>	“Hey Lily,” said Severus sitting down on to the ground next to her. Lily had been curled up in the corner of the Great Hall. She hadn't eaten anything in two days. “I was just wondering if you were okay,” Lily grunted and turned around to face him, she still looked beautiful despite her red and puffy eyes. Stop it, he told himself, she already has a boyfriend.<br/>
“James proposed to me two days ago,” she said, Snape felt his heart drop.<br/>
“ I said no.” That was all she could say before she dissolved into tears. Despite how sad Lily was, he felt his heart do a happy dance.<br/>
“Man Lily,” Snape said, “ I’m so sorry.”<br/>
“It's ok,” she sobbed, “ It's not your fault.” They sat there in silence for a while when Lily finally stood up and said, “Let's go for a walk,” surprised by her actions, Severus stared at her until she took his arm and pulled him up. He fell, and she laughed.</p><p>2 weeks later….<br/>
Lily and Snape were on a bench laughing when James walked by. James looked down at them with hatred. They stop laughing and look at him. When Snape looked up, James punched him in the jaw; he fell down with a surprised look on his face. Lily slapped James, and for a moment he looked surprised, but then he came back to his senses and pushed her onto the ground. Pinning her to the ground he yelled, “ Is this why you said no?  So that you could date this pathetic wizard?”<br/>
“ GET OFF OF HER,” roared Severus, not looking pale, but like a little cherry.<br/>
“What did you just say? You deserve to be-” James raised his arm in a fist as he grabbed onto Severus’s collar and launched his arm back, but he saw Professor McGonagall coming towards them.<br/>
“You boys seem to be having fun,” she said sarcastically. “Tell me what happened.” Professor McGonagall knew that Severus and James had a rivalry, they were always fighting in her class. After she was done, she declared, “Five points from Slytherin, and fifty points from Gryffindor!”<br/>
The boys sighed. Lily shot a glare towards James. She actually had hope that Gryffindor would win the House Cup and it wouldn't be Ravenclaw or Hufflepuff for a change. Professor McGonagall took James by the hood of his robe and dragged him into the school. James walked very sluggishly, but then yelled from far away,<br/>
“You're lucky McGonagall showed up, you would've been in the Hospital Wing by now, Snivellus!”<br/>
Although they were far away, you could still see their shapes. Professor McGonagall stopped and yelled at James, something that sounded like “Twenty points from Gryffindor!” Lily didn't care by now how many points would be taken away from Gryffindor. She helped Severus up and wiped the blood from his chin. They had been dating for a week now. </p><p>4 months later...</p><p>       	Severus walked up to Lily, holding a messy stack of papers. His hair was slicked back, and he was wearing a rather fancy outfit. Lily had her hair up in a messy ponytail and was wearing her school robes. Severus had finished taking his NEWTs, but Lily hadn't. They had been dating for about 4 ½  months now.<br/>
“Do you need me to help you with some homework?” Lily asked Severus, assuming the stacks of papers were his History of Magic essay.<br/>
“No,” Severus smiled back. “This isn't homework.” Lily didn't ask what it was. She didn't really have an interest in what it was if it wasn't homework. “Lily,” Severus said, reading his paper. “I love you, Lily. Like a lot,” he chuckled and Lily smiled. “You have been my only crush, ever since before we even went to Hogwarts. You have made me smile every day; see you and-” he was very proud of his work, but being so nervous, he dropped his papers. “Um… Oh no,” he said.<br/>
Lily was giggling at what he had done. She picked up the papers. “Here,” she said. “Continue.”<br/>
Severus had never seen her smile so big. “Okay, but they aren't in the right order,” he replied. You could tell he was trying to hold back tears. “Ever since I realized it I- Oh, this isn't where I'm at.” Severus started to sob.<br/>
“No, Sev,” Lily said back, wiping his tears. “Just say it from your heart. That's where it really comes from, not from the paper,” Lily said.<br/>
Severus smiled and got down on one knee. “Will you marry me?” he asked.<br/>
Lily smiled and said yes. She was jumping up and down with tears of joy shining in her eyes.<br/>
“Lily, will you love me forever and ever?” Severus asked. “<br/>
Always,” Lily replied, with tears in her eyes, but not rolling down her cheek like they had been before. </p><p>2 Years Later...</p><p>       Here the couple was married and happy, living in Godric’s Hollow. They had kids now. Lily was sitting in their red armchair. She held her newborn son to her chest. She smiled down at the adorable child, and then glanced up at Severus, who was sitting next to her, on the arm of the armchair, holding their daughter. Although they were twins, they looked nothing alike. The boy looked like Severus, with black, fuzzy hair. He had Lily’s nose (thank goodness) and her eyes. The girl looked like Lily but had Severus’s eyes.<br/>
“So what names do you like?” Lily asked Severus.<br/>
“I've been thinking, and I like the name ‘Doe, You know?” Severus answered, proud of himself for coming up with that. “What names do you like?” He asked Lily.<br/>
“Well, now I feel kind of stupid for my name. I LOVE the name Harry, but I have no reason behind it,” Lily laughed as she was talking. “Yours is so creative!”<br/>
“Thanks,” Severus said back. “So Harry and Doe it is?” “Yep,”  Lily smiled back.</p>
