    <p align="left">If you are one Harry Potter with relatives like the Dursleys, you'd do anything to live while having high pain endurance levels, patience of a saint in order to grasp an opportunity and do everything you can for yourself out of self-preservation.</p><p align="left">He was forced to wear castoffs, eat scraps and a can of uncooked soup, work on chores that Dudley makes difficult and unable to excel in school or get a beating.</p><p align="left">He thought Hogwarts was his saving grace...</p><p align="left">NOT!</p><p align="left">Harry Potter observed his new world starting with good acting skills.</p><p align="left">He deliberately looked around starting by the station.</p><p align="left">Hagrid DID NOT TELL HIM where the Platform was because he was in a rush to get that grubby package he got from that vault away.</p><p align="left">So he waited by the station for help while disguising himself with a cap.</p><p align="left">Cue redhead family talking loudly:</p><p>'Now, what’s the platform number?' said the boys’ mother.</p><p>'Nine and three-quarters!' piped a small girl, also red-headed, who was holding her hand, 'Mom, can’t I go…'</p><p>'You’re not old enough, Ginny, now be quiet. All right, Percy, you go first.'</p><p>What looked like the oldest boy marched toward platforms nine and ten. Harry watched, careful not to blink in case he missed it—but just as the boy reached the dividing barrier between the two platforms, a large crowd of tourists came swarming in front of him and by the time the last backpack had cleared away, the boy had vanished.</p><p>He had to get closer to look yet magically, when they're about to enter, tourists somehow were magically made to crowd that spot to hide them to his annoyance but he noted that the plump mother was looking around for someone. Him obviously but he kept hidden as he hid using the crowd as well. When he was a no-show, she gave up and went after her sons.</p><p>This enabled him to sneak in and chose the last compartment on purpose at the very last car.</p><p>The people present aren't even enough to fill the whole train.</p><p>However, one of the boys of that family said, 'Anyone sitting there?' he asked, pointing at the seat opposite Harry. 'Everywhere else is full.'</p><p>Whuuut?</p><p>Harry has been looking out the windows using a compact mirror aimed angularly that nobody filled in the compartments...and he came deliberately seeking him out since he intently looked at his eyes and forehead. His jaded mind instantly thought that as he's rich and his family dressed poorly as if its still the time of Victoria and they got ONE DAUGHTER...this was a red flag. In fact, when sorting happened, and school started, he clung himself like a limpet as if he's his friend! And trying to distract him from what he wanted to do, trying to drag him to chess or his interests that don't even interest him.</p><p>Its basically 'forcing himself on him', forcing him to be his friend in one-sided benefits. Harry's no idiot.</p><p>When Harry found a Confundus Spell from his minimal research time, he makes sure that when he wants Library Time, he Confunds Ron Weasley to goof off and NOT bother him until his precious free time was over. He just tolerated him as he excelled in Academic and Spellwork despite not doing recitations, his issue was Snape.</p><p>But when they befriended Hermione Granger who was an overachiever, while she means well, she comes across as patronizing, condescending and thinks they can't do anything right without her and she alone is correct when in fact, her work is mostly copy-paste by memory while his own work was solely his own understanding of the lessons that she 'deems wrong' so he Confunded her too into not noticing his schoolwork and badger Ron instead of him. He wins. Outside of schoolwork, she's a nice girl...but with solid, cast-iron morals and deference to authority they may as well be the Minister in her eyes that she can't admit their flaws. She doesn't understand that respect is EARNED, not freely-given. Heck, Snape's rotten attitude is blatantly in-her-face and yet...</p><p>Its no surprise that he gets EEs to her As in Homework(he ensures she doesn't notice but he notices that she hides her homework as if she's hiding porn from McGonagall in shame) while in Exams and Quizzes, as well as Spellwork, understandably she's an O since she really is a talented magic user. His grades are all EEs in everything (as he gets his spells right after a couple more tries)...save in Potions. His Academics are OK but in practicals, that's where sabotaging happens...Ron's grades, without Hermione's nagging, would have been Ds and just pulled to As.</p><p>In his opinion, Harry found his fame a curse as he's got Ron Weasley sticking himself to him giving him no choice as he's not good in Memory Charms yet. Ron clearly wanted an easy path to life using him so he can goof off all he wants and get things he wants falling to his lap. Heh, now that he's not around anymore...he's pretty sure its a pretty good thing he's gone or he took to leeching off his brothers next? He's a damn parasite.</p><p>Then when he got his dad's Invisibility Cloak from someone, he felt a strange need to go to certain places and can not control himself to his chagrin. For now he allowed it to happen as he was led to a room with a mirror that showed him his family...well, family who actually cares for him. After that, he researched spells to detect spells on his father's cloak to destroy it but...things happened...that reeked of a set-up...that got him encountering 'Quirrellmort'.</p><p>His counter?</p><p>He summoned a House Elf and told it to take it and hide until he calls for it again with their secret code word while he barely survived Quirrellmort.</p><p>He thus played dumb while at the Hogwarts' bathroom for a shower, he had the elf take the stone back to Nicholas Flamel with a letter to him about events surrounding his stone.</p><p>He also knew never to go back to the Magical World ever again but he knew he would have no choice. Never had any from the start.</p><p>His chance came in the form of a House Elf that got him where he is now.</p><hr/><p> </p><p>Three years.</p><p align="left">That's how long Harry Potter, now age 15 has been in this world since his summer where he took full advantage of an elf trying to mean him well in a rather weird way. He is now very healthy, 5'7 tall, and wears good clothes befitting one who lives in a fantasy world.</p><p align="left">By promising him not to go to Hogwarts in exchange for things he needs and a magical phenomena that can possibly occur anywhere...Dobby managed to find one in time for him before school began, and he gambled his life on it but Dobby reassured him its no bad place, but ancient when he looked that 'It was good the great Harry Potter asked for those kind of books!'</p><p align="left">And Dobby wished him luck as all Dobby wanted was his safety. It was the first time someone wanted what was actually good for him for a change and its a non-human at that. Perhaps despite their race, they were more humane than actual humans. In fact, they were kinder to him. Hagrid, Firenze(his fellow centaurs are assholes though) and now Dobby.</p><p align="left">All humans he met are A) Turning a blind eye/looks the other way from what's obvious instead of HELPING and DOING WHAT'S RIGHT. B) Presumptuous lot quick to judge to conclusions. C) Unreliable and D) Controls him via Social Expectation Mold and Pressure.</p><p align="left">Well, if you wanna travel to another world, its only common sense to carry with you knowledge and items that will make your life easier, right? He also sealed his Vaults, ensuring nobody can use it or benefit off it no matter what they try and do, save for the Potter Account Manager's monthly salary for managing his family's gold and he has to apply tons of security to be triple sure as he doesn't trust any human adult anymore.</p><p align="left">So now, he studied and studied.</p><p align="left">He studied Construction and sought out materials to build his home away from civilization until he mastered how the world works by cheating a lot with magic.</p><p align="left">He mastered its language, culture and way of life and learned its ups and downs.</p><p align="left">He stole what he needs too. In fact, as he hated nobles due to the attitude of Purebloods back home such as the likes of Malfoy, he had gone to the capital, and robbed the royal treasury! He robbed it of loose change as owning gold is a tell-tale flag that you're wealthy.</p><p align="left">Outside Coda Village in his first year here, he created an oblong-shaped, deep hole deep enough for a room with smooth walls.</p><p align="left">Upon obtaining this world's version of concrete, and by following the books he had, he mixed and reinforced it, and created a wall as thick as the length of a hand and earthquake-resistant if this world ever HAD an Earthquake, then ensured that the ceiling is very-much supported and flat, so he can hide his personal library using soil. He then made stone steps leading down, and a hidden door leading to it so no natives can find his books and valuables in the event they broke in for thievery attempts.</p><p align="left">As for his house, its very well-insulated that its warm in winter, comfy-cool in summer. It was a very small house fit just for him. One bedroom upstairs for him and a huge guest room, a living room, kitchen and bathroom...even better? Its a house that can make disney designers proud since its a cute cottage with thatched roofing with the thatching material taken from the farmers. He preserved it with magic so it would not rot.</p><p align="left">The wood and windows are understandably, made of wood.</p><p align="left">His home is then filled with decor and furniture denari can buy.</p><p align="left">After a year dedicated to studying his books in what's needed to build himself a good home, good clothes, shoes, understanding his new world, and what's needed for a comfortable life before studying his magic books.</p><p align="left">He only kept magic rules and mechanics and took spells that were useful for home life, combat, life's comforts, healing, defense, protection and retaliation for being offended. The rest, he ripped off of his books and burned it, deeming it useless.</p><p align="left">He also kept his original wand safe and upon learning how to obtain a sage's staff, had no choice but to purchase it legally because the Staff Crafter is just like Ollivander. Your talents and affinities are determined, then you're given a staff compatible with those. However, all staves must always be a head shorter than the user.</p><p align="left">He asked if he can coat it in thick, strong metal to double as a bludgeoning weapon without fear of it breaking against military weapons.</p><p align="left">'Ah, you can but costly! 10 Sinkus for the job, and the other expenses depend on the metal you want!' said the Staff Crafter with a shudder as while those services are offered, nobody's insane to give up two years' worth of life savings for it.</p><p align="left">'What if I asked for Dragon Scales melted to coat my staff in a half inch-thick layer? I want a Black Wyvern Coating.'</p><p align="left">The crafter choked.</p><p align="left">'A-are you sure?! That's 60 Sinkus! Only royalty can afford that and not even they are crazy enough...'</p><p align="left">Harry put the required money on the table with a smile. The Crafter choked about 'Crazy rich people...' before shakily accepting it. 'Be back for your staff in a month, lad! Black Wyvern scales are a challenge to work with!'</p><p align="left">'Alright!'</p><p align="left">Harry was glad he stole money as a precaution, stealing from the Capital some Sinkus on the way here.</p><p align="left">He also bought books that were along 2 Sinku at the cheapest. It was simply to get an idea how this world's magic works.</p><p align="left">Well, magic here is just as primitive. It was an idea of reenacting natural phenomena that happens in the world. Then again in magic, its mind over matter. Your mind creates and makes it real using magic as a medium to do so, and the magician as the conduit to produce it. He can produce crazy things with his powers and if he can, so can they but...he wasn't sure he'd teach his magic to ANYBODY.</p><p align="left">On his second year of life, he stole a lot of paper, writing materials, tools for hardbound covering, he studied all plants and animals he could find without crossing into dragon territory using psychometry. He sought healing plants and plants useful to get products from if processed right. He wrote down what these plants look like, how to use and process it, where were they located, when are they in season and how to cultivate them. Its just too bad that people here have no idea what vitamins and minerals are...he can only say what they're good for and also what's bad about it...and presented his thesis that made him an Official Research Sage yet nobody has an idea who he was, who was his teacher and where he came from because his fashion was so...foreign, in very vibrant colors, and his staff is COATED. He simply published his books to be capable of owning Sinkus as books are worth a fortune, and book copiers charge three Sinkus per book they have to copy while the authors can live a cushy life with money raining on them.</p><p align="left">With the new knowledge he presented, the Judging Panel and audience are eager to spread it around while trying to find ways to experiment with them.</p><p align="left">He also planted fruiting cultivars he brought with him from Earth, as well as left behind sacks of cereal seeds in Formal Mansion in Italica to make them plant it after leaving behind information on what their uses were. Using his stock of Regerminating Potion, and used his magical powers to persuade the plants to grow to full maturity by absorbing what's needed to grow, after gathering enough manure material he turned into fertilizer and having had to pour water on it as it grew to full maturity.</p><p align="left">He planted groves of fruiting trees and shrubs, and edible mushrooms once he was sure with what tree they're compatible with, and let nature take its course. That, and they'll be easy to find by the natives...so he spent his third year living a cozy home life while opening a shop, working as a cloth dyer, selling dyed fabrics that are vibrant in color using his own inventions.</p><p align="left">He also sells a better quality of ink than this world's so-called best ink brand. Other than black, he also sells other dark-colored inks that's now all the rage, but he got a personal visit from an Earl Marcus once, telling him that he can no longer sell Purple Ink to the public, deeming it exclusively for Emperor's Use only as his royal signature of authority so he is to send supplies straight to Sadera. He is also to make purple wax for sealing letters!</p><p align="left">Might as well make a damn Stamp Pad to seal the deal.</p><p align="left">His store sells ink, bathing soap, laundry soap, sealing waxes, candles, and now, stamp pads.</p><p align="left">As Harry likes where his head was, he very reluctantly agreed. So he created a crimson ink to replace it in his public stores.</p><p align="left">But one day, into his third year here...he got a guest. It was a sage girl his age with silver hair, green eyes and a blank look on her face. She wears blue student robes.</p><p align="left">For students of Lindon, there are ranks in apprenticehood.</p><p align="left">Students who wish to learn magic learn the basics from a Graduate or a higher-ranking teacher. Upon receiving a recommendation from that mentor, they are interviewed by an Archmage they wish to learn under, and become a Graduate graduating from basics. They then become Sages. Blue Robes is a color of Graduates that Lelei wears.</p><p align="left">And in becoming a Sage, there's ranks too. At the Rondel Academic Conferences is an opportunity to promote oneself. A Graduate Sage will then move on to Master, Expert and Archmage.</p><p align="left">For researchers like himself, they haven't much ranking. Research Sages are true-blue scientists unlike magic-users who study nature phenomena to reenact in sorcery...Researchers study and discover new things to improve life and livelihood or learn more about their world. However, in a civilization like this, 'truth, is scary'. Personages like Galileo Galilei and others will be lynched here. Harry's field was much safer. Medicine, new products borne out of plants and such was FAR SAFER to release to public!</p><p align="left">He was an oddity as nobody was his teacher. He was 'an existence that appeared in a blink' and had hardcore proof about his work. Moreover nobody's done what he had as people focused more on magic lately as being a Researcher, is a VERY RISKY CAREER. Especially if you dared say anything about life itself, planetary related and galaxy-related! He shuddered at the idea.</p><p align="left">For Research Sages, there's simply Student, Researcher, Senior Researcher and Master's Degree...not that much different from College...his amount of discoveries made him a Senior Researcher. He can actually open a school but hey, that needs lots of money...presenting alone costs a lot, its definitely NOT easy to open a school. Funds alone is an issue.</p><p align="left">He'd know this one.</p><p align="left">She is Lelei La Lalena, Cato El Altestan's student and a young Sage like himself though her rank is lower than his.</p><p align="left">'Hello, what can I do for you?' he asked as she went into his shop while he was at work.</p><p align="left">'Harry, we ran out of soap. Do you still have any more?'</p><p align="left">'Oh! I have one last bar on my shelves.' Harry went to snap his fingers to make the item come to him '35 Bita.' Lelei paid up. 'Dang those nobles, they monopolize my soap stock as if only the rich have the right to smell fresh so its really a first-come first serve in buying my stuff.' Harry grumbled as he gave Lelei the soap. 'At least their envoys bring me materials I need to make them but...sigh...' he sighed in exasperation.</p><p align="left">'They melt so fast though.' said Lelei.</p><p align="left">'That's if while during bath, they're around water. When not in use while lathering, put it away from all wet surfaces as even a wet surface can still melt soap little at a time. Put them in dry places so they won't melt faster than it should.' Harry advised. 'If used with care it lasts three weeks.'</p><p align="left">'OK.' and Lelei left with her purchase.</p><p align="left">Life was peaceful. He lives life as he pleases and its all thanks to Dobby the House Elf.</p>
