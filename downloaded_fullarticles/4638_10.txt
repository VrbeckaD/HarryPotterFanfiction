          <div class="userstuff"><p>“Hermione. Might I have a word?”</p><p>Hermione tenses, stopping in her tracks rather abruptly.</p><p>There’s no reason to be nervous, she tells herself - she’s done nothing wrong. Still - she’s never had a one-on-one conversation with Sirius.</p><p>...she helped Harry set him free. There’s no reason he’d do her any harm.</p><p>Immediately, she shakes her head to rid herself of that thought. Sirius never was a criminal, and she knows this - there’s just something about him that still kind of unsettles her, an unpredictability of sorts that she finds hard to understand.</p><p>“Uh. Sure.”</p><p>He’s looking at her in mild confusion, and she blinks to snap herself out of feeling embarrassed.</p><p>“Right.”</p><p>She follows him back into the dining room, pausing to let Molly bustle past, and barely flinching when she immediately yells: “George! Put down the cat, this instant!”</p><p>Hermione shuts the door over George’s reply and focuses on the man opposite her, gulping down the rest of her nerves. This is fine.</p><p>
  <em> What on earth could he want? </em>
</p><p>“Sit,” Sirius tells her, pulling out a chair on his side of the table. “There’s something I’d like to confirm.”</p><p>With a slight frown, Hermione does as she’s asked.</p><p>“...what’s this about?”</p><p>Sirius leans back in his chair. “Well. Harry mentioned something the other day, when we told him Snape was in the Order.”</p><p>He tilts his head, regarding her with a strange kind of piercing intensity.</p><p>“Is it true-” he pauses, leaning forward ever so slightly - “...that you set him on fire?”</p><p>Hermione lets out a startled little huff of laughter.</p><p>“Oh!”</p><p>Sirius’ eyes go wide with mirth. “So it <em> is </em> true!”</p><p>“Well- I mean, it was a misunderstanding, I thought he was trying to kill Harry-”</p><p>“So you <em> set him on fire!” </em></p><p>Honestly, he’s looking a little too excited about this.</p><p>“Uhm. Well, I guess I did? I needed to break his concentration-”</p><p>“Fantastic. You know, they were right about you,” Sirius declares, leaning back in his chair in satisfaction. “You really are the brightest witch of your age.”</p><p>She bristles, recalling the words. “Well, I wouldn’t say-”<br/> “Nonsense,” Sirius interrupts. “I wasn’t worried about Harry fighting in the Order - he’s way too much like his father, anyhow. But I’m not worried about you, either. You’ll do fine.”</p><p>He’s grinning at her, much like he’d grinned at Harry when he first arrived at Grimmauld Place. Almost… cheekily, like he’s find a new partner in crime. Hermione tries hard not to be flustered.</p><p>“Oh. Well. I want to help, where I can.”</p><p>“I’d expect nothing less.”</p><p>Sirius regards her with a thoughtful expression for a moment, before he leans forward again. “Tell me, though. Did he scream when he realized?”<br/> Hermione isn’t sure how to react, frowning again. Dumbledore trusts Snape, after all. He’s not an enemy, no matter how much Sirius may hate him. “Well- no, I don’t think- I mean, it worked out in the end, because he stopped Professor Quirrell, but-”</p><p>The door opens behind her, and Hermione cuts herself off. Sirius glances up, smile widening as Harry walks into the room</p><p>“...pity,” he says to Hermione. “In any case, you’ve certainly got me impressed.”</p><p>“It’s not… something I’m particularly proud of,” she defends.</p><p>“Whatever this is about, you’re wrong,” Harry says, resting his arms on the backrest of the nearest chair.</p><p>“I was just confirming your story about setting Snape on fire,” Sirius says, even as Hermione shakes her head.</p><p>“Oh, that!” Harry says, grin spreading wide across his face. “That was bloody brilliant, Hermione.”</p><p>“Again, I wouldn’t say-”</p><p>“Come <em> on,” </em> Harry says, rolling his eyes. “First of all, it’s a story for the ages. Fred and George have been going on about wanting you to join their ranks ever since - no one else has managed to set a teacher on fire yet. Secondly, you saved my life back then. I certainly won’t forget it.”</p><p>Sirius nods, clearly satisfied. “There you have it.”</p><p>Hermione bites her lip, still reluctant. “It was disrespectful, if I had known-”</p><p>“And Snape’s a prick. You did good, Hermione.”</p><p>She hesitates.</p><p>“...I mean… I guess it was kind of… funny.”</p><p>“There she is,” Harry says, clapping her on the shoulder. “Don’t sell yourself short.”</p><p>Sirius grins. “Well, there you go. Glad to have you on our side, Hermione.”</p><p>“Oh, yeah,” Harry agrees, nodding gravely. “Wouldn’t want her as your enemy, this one. Did I tell you how she petrified Neville? And the time she <em> punched Malfoy in the face? </em>”</p></div>
