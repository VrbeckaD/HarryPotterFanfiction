    <p>People are full of greed. Tom Riddle learnt this well in his youth. The selfishness of the children around him was a constant reminder of what he was not to get. Even after all the pilfered trinkets he collect throughout his years at the orphanage, there was something he could never steal, something he wanted since he could remember.</p><p>It was an infernal emotional he held such a desire for. <em>Ah but that was long ago</em>. Tom decided when he reached his new school of magic where he could finally be freed from his prison of greedy children, he would find a way to get rid of the detached loveless feeling that had haunted him for so many years. So that is what Tom did, he manipulated his emotions away to a dark place, where he would no longer feel them. Giving way to his rise of power. No one needed <em>love</em> when they were at the top, such an emotion would only get in the way. Tom delved himself into each tomb he could grasp and milked it for what it was worth and threw it away, his instable curiosity hadn’t left him since he found out he was different from the others.</p><p>But what Tom didn't know, is unchecked curiosity can be <strong>dangerous</strong>.</p><p>Tom made sure to remove himself from situation that held no value to him, he had no need to truly care about his fellow peer or find happiness in their presence. Strong emotions such as the ones he was trying to confine, they weren't meant to be hidden. So away they went, yet at certain times, when he wasn’t in complete control they would weave their way back into his heart, like when he received his first ever gifts from them, his housemates all brought him something, <em>well thought out and pleasing somethings…gifts.</em> Tom himself finds little interest in material thing with no meaning but…. He will never let anyone know he still carries around the charms that Rosier had given him.</p><p>So to keep himself from this Tom had been inspired to find some new magic…unsurprisingly. To get rid of something ones needs a tool of extraction and a container to keep it in place. Tom so happens to have such a receptacle. Specifically, a vase like box, heavy in design yet Tom made no need to open the seemly locked box before. He had no use for it before, having held onto it all these years, it was a good vessel as any. So He decided for this to work he would have to find a particular piece of magic that played with the soul emotion...which he probably won’t find in Hogwarts, '<em>least not anymore</em>'.</p><p>Tom sat crossed leg In front of this object he wishes to use, rising it up and down like a feather Tom let his wand turn as he closely inspected it. <em>'Approximately a 20 by 15 cm gold engraved rectangle</em>', no wonder he never took interest after he received it, it was undeniable tawdry. It will have to do, sighing he closed his eyes. He would have to place in raw pure emotion, simple in theory, but what should he keep? Fear. No that would have to go. When he is all powerful fear is redundant. Should he get rid of it all? It could leave him with nothing but anger, hate and his more undesirable emotion, greed. His greed for more drove him into a whole of darkness. More power, more status.</p><p>The pain he caused others fell nothing short of the anguish he feels as he opens his eyes. The box still hovering about a foot off the ground. The spells and rituals he would have to uncover will be dark and restricted for a reason. It is a morally heinous act. Reaching out and feeling the ridges and the smooth yet flaky specs of gold he hold it him has hands, long fingers curl around the box as he brings it closer to his sight. The lock on the front reminded him of the lock on front of the George V palace gates. '<em>Guess it's George Vl now'</em>. Doesn’t really matter, how to open it is the question. He looks like they could of once been a key…well that was entirely unhelpful wasn’t it. The box never came with a key and their was no way he was pursuing <em>him</em> down for it….</p><p> </p><p>Magic…</p><p> </p><p>How utterly ridiculous of him, just use a spell. How about a simple one?</p><p>
  <em>Alohomora. </em>
</p><p>
  <strong>Click.</strong>
</p><p><em>'Well that was an ironically insignificant letdown'</em>. Opening the box slight and closing it with a snap. Tom looked around then placed the box under his bed. Leaning against the bedpost. It would do him no good using the box now he had still no practical use for it. He had to find something helpful or this would all be for null. Getting up and dusting himself Tom left with his bag hoping to at least hope to get something done between his classes.</p><p>A door closed; the silent room was slashed threw with a soft yet cutting <em><strong>screeeeeeeeeeeech. </strong></em></p><p>A little box, many would mistake for storage was slowly starting to open by itself. Slowly black ink ran out onto the floor of the room, it sharply took a glob like form of a human figure. It quickly manifested into something that would soon cause mayhem and havoc for the person so foolish as to open a random box without so much as a thought.</p><p>The manifestation placed pale white fingers between the prison's seal, leaning to look under the bed the figure grinned Cheshire like and rose up, leaving the box ajar. Observing the room, finally able to since its out of the confinement, eerily emerald eyes roamed the silver and green room. The room consisted of 4 beds which one, the figure observed the frames that sat at each bed, human figures…. he was peering over the frames, the windows showed nothing but darkness and occasionally movement. Dark closets in each corner, Cases twice as big as his box was at the end of each bed. The place all in all was nothing short of dreary. Green eyes glistened with mischief, maybe he could make it more appealing, perhaps a little colour...</p><p> </p><p>Tom Riddle return to his room after another trying day, his dorm mates were still, currently, in the common room possible surrounded by there lover of the week. Tom had no need for such animalistic bodily desires, he long go rid of that particular nuance of adolescence. He wish nothing, but a good rest after another day of trying to find the chamber of secrets, his right to find, and discover what his ancestor wish to be kept In their bloodline. Which is another thing. This is going to be a tiresome year. He needs to find the chamber, <em>kill Dumbledore</em>, find his parents, <em>kill Dumbledore, </em>find the books that could help him with his recent endeavour, and…well first thing is first, the chamber, maybe Slytherin held some hidden magic he kept for his descendants.</p><p>Sighing as he opens the door only to be greeted but an horrendous sight.</p><p>Paint was everywhere from the floor to the roof of the room colours consisting from pinks to bright floral yellows. Glue covered the bed post. The sticky substance littered with white feathers and what looked like rainbow sparkles. Pieces of paper which looked like a three year old coloured them, with what appeared to be crayons covered the floor so much so the lush dark green carpet was almost unseen. Pictures of bright yellow Suns and blue dinosaurs was just the ticking point for Tom to stroll out, door slamming behind him.</p><p>He entered the common room, seething. Tom looked around at his dorm mates William Avery, Antonin Dolohov and Lester Lestrange. All three immediately felt his presence and paled. He promptly turned, leaving the three to follow him. When all were in the room Tom abruptly closed the door with a '<strong>slam</strong>'. The new occupancies of the room stared dumbstruck at the state of their sleeping quarters.</p><p>"H-How?" The smallest of the three boys strutted. The boy looked around in horror at the colour scheme and the weird creatures and sun drawing…kind of cute though.</p><p>"I was hoping, you might shed some light on that, Avery?" Tom Spoke calmly, yet on the inside he was anything but.</p><p>“I...I..Tom..I really couldn't tell you..I.." William Avery stammered the blond-haired boy looking at his friends for help.</p><p>The oldest shrugged as he surveyed the room, it was impossible to get up here not with the wards they had set up, the only way in and out then would be, he looked past Tom at the murky waters out the window, looking back at his friend, "Tom if we knew, we would tell you. I sure want to know who did this and was able too without anyone noticing." Lester Lestrange gestures to the room in dismay.</p><p>Tom continued to seethe. His questions remained unanswered and his tiredness creeping up on him, he was growing more irritated by the second. His magic flared and spread across the room in thick and heavy waves cause the others trouble to breathe.</p><p>Saying anything to calm his leader down "W..We will ha..have every...everything Spot...spotless within..a..an hour" Antonin Dolohov gasped for air. His leader deeming this satisfactory, left and with him, his dark magic. The boys rose to their feet, without realising there ever dropped, looking around the room the boys sucked up their disgust and stated to clean. Soon realising after 10 minutes that whoever did this meant it to be permanent. With the magic resistors. The boys started looking for a mop.</p><p>“Why do we have to do this?”</p><p>“Don’t complain Avery!” Lester looked up from where he was kneeled over picking up child-like drawings. His dorm mate was currently poking at the bed post strewn with feathers.</p><p>“Here,” from the corner of his eye he clutches the mop Antonin gave him “We don’t want to disappoint. We have 30 minutes” 30 minutes huh, like hell they’ll finish. He takes one last look around the room, the off feeling of being watched, before wailing towards a wall and getting started.</p><p>As the boys suffered silently in there cleaning, green eyes held annoyance at his masterpiece being destroyed, yet his eyes didn't hold the disappointment for long. They reclaimed their amusement and as a lose feather fell in front of his bed, he started planning something more extravagant.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>Tom stalked the halls of Hogwarts, his mind still on his room earlier that evening. When he left it after lunch it was as clean and proper. Nothing was out of place; everyone should have been in class. His brain turned with possible ways a student was able to get into his room. Teachers were out of the question. The child like tendency the mess was left in clearly stated an immature mind, even for a first year. On the bright side when he returned to his sleeping quarters, a hour ago to check up on it. The room were more or less as Dolohov promised. Maybe he should go to the library something in their should sooth his mind for tonight, maybe something…..restricted. The chamber is still at the forefront of his mind, he would very much wish to locate it before end of year. It was nearing the end September. If he gets on it now it will give him an entire year, not that the last 4 were anymore helpful. Seriously though where could it be. ‘<em>The Chamber of Secrets is known to home an ancient beast, which, according to legend, was intended to be used to purge the area of Muggle-born students</em>’. That’s is what the book said. The beast is a snake of some kind he is certain of that, though that begs the questioned where would you hide a weaponised snake. Somewhere dark and damp where no one other than Slytherin would have access. So the dungeons. Yet he has search the place top to bottom…. what else is dark and damp?</p><p>He stopped mid step, hearing an echo of giggle-like laughter he quietly inspecting a lone corridor for any sign of students out of bed. The cold dungeon corridor was dreary and covered in light dust that seemed to dance by itself. Finding nothing after minutes he continued his rounds. Hoping this was the only day that things have gone not according to plan. It's not like someone was out to get him, with his reputation, no one would dare. Even if it was a first year.</p><p>Talking about the first year, it might just rival the old coots first spot rating on my hit list, now that would be interesting…but only time would tell.</p>
