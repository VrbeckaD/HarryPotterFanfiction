    <p>Albus Hannibal Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore stood over the bassinet of one Harry James Potter. The baby wailed. To his left stood Severus Bloom, cradling the cold dead corpse of Lily Potter. Sobs punctuated the eerie silence. All over the floor around them, lay the charred, exploded remains of one Tom Marvolo Riddle.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>It appeared that Lily had been experimenting with some nasty wards on the crib, and they quite literally exploded in Voldemort’s face.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Albus turned, and considered the sad wreck of a man beside him. This would require some delicacy. Circumstances had presented him with a marvelous opportunity to reshape the wretch into something more. The perfect tool. A tool completely loyal to himself…and to the Greater Good of course. He spoke. “Lily would not have wanted you to cry.”</p><p>“What do you mean?” Severus said through sobs. “It’s all my fault. I went to the Dark Lord, I told him about the prophecy.”</p><p>Of course it’s your fault, Albus thought harshly. While some might say the prophecy was fulfilled, Albus felt one should always make contingency plans. “Lily sacrificed herself for this child. Her love protected him. She would want someone to take care of the boy.”</p><p>“I’ll take care of him.” Severus said in a moment of pure guilt. “I’ll protect him. Merlin, I swear to it. Lily, I swear on my magic I will protect your son.”</p><p>A glow of light green sparkling magic swirled around him, binding his oath. It wasn’t an Unbreakable Vow per se, Severus wouldn’t die if he broke it, but he would loose all his magic. Perhaps to some, that is a fate worse than death.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Albus looked on the scene coldly, and pondered where to put the baby. All the Potters were dead. Of course, the boy could not go to his Godfather, Sirius Black. He’d raise the boy to be terribly rude. Something must be done quickly to remove Mr. Black from the picture, Albus thought.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Unfortunately, even with Severus’ commitment, he was in no shape to raise a child. Despite his dottering, eccentric appearance, Albus was no callous fool. He knew that Severus needed time to grieve. He surveyed the man, eyeing the train wreck that was his clothing. Yes, Harry needed a proper home, with someone who could teach the boy to regularly shower.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Does Lily have any family?” Albus asked, stalling for time. The wretch and the corpse had once been close, after all.</p><p>“Yes,” Severus mumbled, still rocking Lily’s corpse, as if hoping desperately life would jump back into her. “She has a sister, Petunia.”</p><p>“Then he shall go there.”</p><p>“But they’re muggles! I would provide a far better home!”</p><p><em>Confundus! </em>Albus said with a flick of his wand. Severus blinked, slightly confused for a moment, and then nodded. “I’m sorry Albus what were you saying?”</p><p>“I was asking who you thought should raise the boy,”</p><p>Severus nodded. “Yes, Petunia would make an excellent home. It’s important he grow up with relatives.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Albus smiled thinly. This was perfect. Harry Potter would have a proper home, and if anything went wrong, well, Severus would feel the guilt as it was now his idea.</p><p>Albus spoke. “We need to perform a full medical exam on the child. I do not like the look of this scar.”</p><p>Severus nodded.</p><p>“But more importantly, we should change his name. To protect him.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“The world will see Harry Potter as the chosen one, Merlin reborn. When he learns of his past, it will go to his head. No, it’s much better if he thinks he is someone else.”</p><p>“Who?”</p><p>“William.” Albus thought fondly of his tragic soulmate. “Yes, William Potter. Harry Potter’s younger brother. From now on, Harry Potter tragically died at the hands of Lord Voldemort, destroying them both. And William Potter was left unscathed.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="center">***</p><p>Albus stood in front of a Number Four, Privet Drive. It was an unassuming two story house, with a brown tiled roof, and light brown siding. It sat in a quiet, unassuming neighborhood, filled with homes far smaller than their occupants egos, each as soul-crushingly uninspired as the next. The type of home, Albus thought, designed for mid-to-lower level executives. Boring people, with boring lives.</p><p>In one hand he held a woven basket. Inside lay the a, charmed to sleep, wrapped in a warm blanket.</p><p>In Albus’ younger days, he had delved deeply into the arts of healing. On his examination of little William Potter, he was alarmed to find that the scar on the baby’s forehead radiated dark magic. A month and several experiments later, little William Potter no longer had a scar, and the dark magic was gone. After all, it would be highly irresponsible to leave such a mark on a child going into Muggle care.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>He placed the basket on the front step of the house. He tucked in letter explaining that Lily and James were dead. He rang the doorbell. And with a sharp crack, apperated away.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="center">***</p><p>
  <b>4 years later…</b>
</p><p>Severus Bloom and Albus Dumbledore walked along the road to Number Four Privet Drive. With notice-me-not charms on them, no one turned to stare at Dumbledores outlandish light blue plaid robes and complimentary tie. As always, he wore a formal wizards hat, always complimentary to his robes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>They knocked on the door.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Get into the cupboard! And be quiet!” A deep man’s voice inside yelled.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>After a moment, a thin, bony looking women opened the door. Severus immediately recognized her as Petunia, Lily’s sister. Time had not aged her well. Her face was long, and rather horse like.</p><p>Severus scowled. She recognized him immediately. “You! Get away from my house you freak—”</p><p>She was cut off by Dumbledore casting a silencing spell.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Now, that’s no way to greet a guest.” He lectured. “Let’s try that again. Hello, I am Professor Dumbledore, and you are?” He released the spell.</p><p>Her eyes widened in fear. “Petunia…Dursley…” she stammered out.</p><p>“Good, good. Now invite us in.”</p><p>She stepped back, silently leading them into the house.</p><p>Severus was overwhelmed by the amount of pink inside the house. Everything seemed a washed out peach of a hideous salmon color. The smell of roasting potatoes and beef permeated the air.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>A very fat man stood in the living room. “Petunia, who are these freaks? What are they wearing? Why are they in my house—”</p><p>Once again, Dumbledore used his silencing spell, introduced himself, and waited for a response.</p><p>“Vernon Dursley.” The fat man muttered. Of course Petunia would have married someone as hateful and bigoted as herself. Severus frowned. Why did he think having Harry—no, William grow up in this house was a good idea? He supposed he thought Petunia had changed. That maturity would have grown her out of the vehement hatred she held towards her sister.</p><p>Petunia led them into the kitchen. It was antiseptically clean, with a variety of fancy muggle cooking gadgets. She turned to check a sauce, bubbling away in a small pot.</p><p>“Now, I must ask, who is in the cupboard?” said Dumbledore quietly. His voice was calm, soothing even. But there was a hardness in his eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“No one,” she pathetically stumbled out. “The dog. Yes, the dog in the cupboard.”</p><p>“I see.” Severus frowned as Dumbledore surveyed the room. No doubt, like Severus, he noticed the complete absence of dog hair.</p><p>“Why are you here?” Vernon demanded.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“We would like to see William Potter.”</p><p>“William?!” Petunia said, her voice high and screechy. Like an obnoxious bird. Severus could feel himself tense. Something was very wrong.</p><p>“Yes, are you hard of hearing?”</p><p>“He’s out.” Vernon stated. “He’s playing with Dudley.”</p><p>“Then we shall wait.” Dumbledore said, taking a seat at the kitchen table. “May I ask, what are you cooking?” His voice seemed cheerful, disarming. Severus knew better. He could hear the undercurrent of danger in the man’s voice.</p><p>Severus kept his space, standing in the doorway to the kitchen, watching cautiously as Petunia and Dumbledore exchanged cooking tips. He could see that Dumbledore was unimpressed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Just then, a young boy came running in. Severus assumed this was Dudley. He was a round, fat boy, not unlike a beachball. “Where’s Will?” He demanded. “It’s time for Will wrangling!”</p><p>“Will wrangling?” Dumbledore asked, his voice completely level. He seemed only vaguely interested, but Severus knew that beneath still waters, a tempest brewed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Oh, he’s in the—” Dudley started.</p><p>“Dudley, outside now!”</p><p>“But mom…” the beachball wined.</p><p>“Now!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>He slunk off into the backyard.</p><p>Severus could feel anger starting to simmer up inside him. Will was not with Dudley. In fact, he suspected they were keeping Lily’s son, in a cupboard! They referred to him as a dog!</p><p>Vernon cut in. “I think you should leave.”</p><p>“Oh, but we were just getting acquainted.” Dumbledore cheerfully replied.</p><p>“Out! Now! You have no right to come into my house and start making demands”</p><p>“I’ve been very polite.” Dumbledore stated disarmingly.</p><p>“You know how! You…magic freaks!”</p><p>Severus snapped. How could he have left Lily’s son with these monsters! He leapt forward, grabbing Vernon by the neck, digging his wand into the portly man’s carotid artery. <em>Legilimens! </em>He shouted in rage. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>There he saw how they treated the boy. Screaming at him, treating him like a servant. The fear in the boy’s eyes as he ran from Dudley’s punches and Vernon’s belt.</p><p>Ignoring Vernon’s cries of pain, he delve deeper and deeper, not caring at the damage the spell might cause, until there was nothing left to see. He allowed the broken man to crumble to the floor, unconscious.</p><p>He tossed Vernon aside. Vernon fell to the ground, unconscious.</p><p>“What have you done to my husband!” Petunia screeched, reaching for the saucepan on the stove. Just as she picked it up, planning to try and whack Severus, Dumbledore shot out a hand, and silently cast a spell, causing the pot to fall like a lead brick back onto the stove. Petunia tried to let it go, but found her hands glued to the pot.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Vernon twitched and moaned pathetically.</p><p>Petunia shuddered, avoiding Severus’ gaze. She hunched in, trying to turn away. But she was stuck to the pot. Severus grabbed her shoulders, her beige sweater sliding down, exposing her bony collarbone. Roughly, he forced her to face him. She tried closing her eyes, but he pulled out his wand, casting a spell. Suddenly, her eyes were wide open, terrified.</p><p>
  <em>Legilimens!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em>
</p><p>Hate. Overwhelming hate for the boy, was the first emotion Severus felt. Disgust, contempt. Every time she looked at the boy she was reminded of Lily and that freak she ran off with. Severus growled, half angry at her, half angry at himself. He should have checked on the boy sooner. Why had he waited four years!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Soon, just like her worthless husband, she was laying on the floor unconscious.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Just as quickly as it had swept in, the rage started to recede. He looked down in horror at what he had done to the two muggles. He turned to Dumbledore, expecting a look of reproach, for the man to have interceded. Instead, all he saw was mild amusement.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Before Severus could question, Dumbledore gently said, “Come now. Let us find William.” He walked right past the two twitching muggles. Pulling out a lock of hair from his pocket, he waved his wand and created a sympathetic link, before casting a point me spell. It led them to the cupboard under the stairs. They both crouched down. Dumbledore knocked. “Hello?”</p><p>The door slowly opened. A young boy shrank back, cowering in the dark recesses of the cupboard. He was thin, abnormally thin, clearly undernourished. His hair was black, and messy. Severus found himself tensing. The child looked far too much like his bullying father. But then, Severus saw the boy’s eyes. He had eyes exactly like Lily. That striking emerald green. A green so bright, it shouldn’t be possible.</p><p>The child shook his head.</p><p>“What’s your name?” Dumbledore asked.</p><p>“Freak.” The child replied.</p><p>Severus’ heart burned with hate at the Dursleys, and immense guilt. How could he have been so foolish? Looking back, he knew how Petunia treated Lily. He should have known better.</p><p>He felt Dumbledore’s calming hand on his shoulder. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“And what are you doing?” Dumbledore asked.</p><p>“I’m sorry Sir, Uncle Vernon says I’m not to speak to my betters.”</p><p>Severus let out a low growl as he noticed the bruises on the boy’s arms.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Mr. Dursley would have done well to follow his own advice.” Dumbledore said with a dark chuckle. “Now, I’m Professor Dumbledore, and this is Severus Bloom. We’re here to take you away.”</p><p>The boy’s eyes widened in fear, and he scuttled further back into the cupboard. “Are you from the glue factory? Uncle says that’s where they take freaks who misbehave!”</p><p>Dumbledore knelt down, and offered a comforting hand out to William. “No, we’re here to take you to a new home, a proper home. My friend Mr. Bloom will take care of you now.”</p><p>Severus was always amazed at how kind and gentle Albus was with children. He’d never had much patience for them himself. But then, Albus was the Greatest Light Wizard alive. Of course he would be good with children.</p><p>William shook his head. “You don’t want me. Aunt Petunia says I’m terrible at cooking and cleaning, and nobody would ever want me.”</p><p>Severus blinked back tears, he felt so guilty. How could he have let Lily down <em>again. </em>Honestly, he was surprised he still had magic, he had failed so utterly. “Don’t worry,” He reassured William. He may be terrible with children, but he had to try. “You won’t have to cook or clean. Your mother was one of my dearest friends. I know how your mother would have wanted you to be raised, and it’s not like this.”</p><p>For just the briefest moment, the boy’s eyes widened in hope. The sort of desperate hope, where he expected it to be seized away from him in a moment’s notice. “Auntie says Mommy was a drunken harlot. What’s a harlot?”</p><p>“Your mother was a very sweet woman.” Dumbledore reassured, the grip on Severus’ shoulder tightening.</p><p>Severus wanted to rise, stomp back into the kitchen, and start showing the Dursleys what he actually thought of them. He pictured slowly torturing them over a long period of time for the damage they’d done to Lily’s child.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Have you ever seen a picture of your mother?” Dumbledore continued. “Why don’t you go with Severus. He can show you pictures. He’ll also get your something to eat.”</p><p>The boy’s eyes lit up with the mention of food. “Can I sit at the table?”</p><p align="center">***</p><p>With a loud crack, Severus returned to the Dursley home. Under Dumbledore’s instructions, he’d left William with Madame Pomfrey.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To his surprise, the house smelled amazing. The aroma of tart fruit and caramelized meat filled the air.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>From outside the kitchen, he could hear Dumbledore sautéing and humming to himself. Severus couldn’t help but crack a small smile. It was one of the headmaster’s many eccentricities, cooking. His elective on magical culinary arts was not just popular with pureblood women, (how the better to manage their house elves), no it had become a must for many of Hogwart’s students. It was well known that Dumbledore’s annual Yule feast an event of the season, right up there with the Gala at Malfoy manor.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Eat with me.” Dumbledore instructed, exiting the kitchen and leading Severus to the dining room. The table was set for three, and there was a bottle of wine on the table, opened by Petunia before their arrival.</p><p>“What is it?” Severus asked, eyeing the large lobe of meat on each plate.</p><p>“Fois Gras.” Dumbledore replied, pouring each of them a glass of red wine. He swirled it around and took a sip, before making a face. “My apologies. This is atrocious.”</p><p>“Knowing Petunia,” Severus drawled, “It was probably on sale at the grocery store.” He took a bite. The meat was fatty, succulent, and delicious as it melted on his tongue. “Isn’t this duck or goose liver? You went to the grocery store?” He never remembered Petunia as an adventurous eater, quite the opposite in fact.</p><p>A cryptic smile fleeted across Dumbledore’s face. “Some people say it’s quite cruel to force feed animals.” He responded. “But what if the animal force feeds itself? Gorged on delicious treats, isn’t it the animal’s free will? Would not restraining it be a form of cruelty? Denying it choice?”</p><p>Honestly, Severus had never thought about it, nor did he particularly care to. There were enough problems in the world without adding to them the ethics of one’s food. “I never thought of it.” He said, swiping the last piece of liver in the crimson red sauce.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Good.” Dumbledore rose. “Now, help me take those animals back to the castle dungeons. Don’t worry. I’ve tempered the bleeding, and applied a potion which will, in time, allow the liver to reform.” He smirked, distantly. “The wonders of magic never cease to amaze.”</p><p>Stomach roiling with growing horror, Severus rushed to the kitchen. The bloodied body of a stunned Vernon Dursley pinned to the wall with a sticking charm. He appeared to be under some sort of stasis charm. Blood seeped through his clothes, his shirt was cut open and his stomach was exposed. The cut marks on his abdomen were surgical in their precision.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Severus looked from the body back at Dumbledore, who loomed in the kitchen entry. The kind, gentle grandfather was gone, replaced by this inhuman demon.</p><p>“What have you done with Dumbledore?” Severus shouted, drawing his wand.</p><p>“My dear boy,” Dumbledore chuckled, wandlessly disarming him, “I’m right here.”</p><p>Severus hunched over, dry heaving. Unfortunately, after years in the service of the Dark Lord, he’d learned to have a very strong stomach. But nothing the Dark Lord had done was as debauched as this. <em>Oh Lily, what have I done? What monster have I let into Harry’s life? </em>Severus started to panic. <em>It’s not like I can tell anyone! It’s my word against his, and I’m a Death Eater!</em> Severus started breathing deeply, pulling himself together. <em>No, I have to keep my mouth shut. I have to raise Harry. I certainly can’t let him do it, and that’s what will happen if I’m gone. Oh Merlin, I’m so sorry Lilly, I’m so sorry.</em></p><p>“I want to make it clear.” Dumbledore said, his voice razor sharp, moving like a predator, with the grace of a panther. “They were rude. The rude are animals, not fit for humanity.” His voice lightened in tone. “Now, if you’re going to raise William Potter, you need to be a proper role model. Young William is the heir to a Most Ancient and Noble House, and must be raised accordingly. Now, you won’t let Lily down, <em>will you</em>?”</p><p>Severus understood. He could feel the magic radiating from Dumbledore as it crackled in the air around them. How this man, if you could call him that, had the world fooled as a Light Wizard…Severus shuddered. He too had been fooled. But now, he saw Dumbledore’s true self. He’d seen many a Dark Wizard, and many a killer under his service of the Dark Lord, and standing in front of him was a man who had not only killed before, but enjoyed it.</p><p>Severus found himself quickly nodding, unsure if he should kneel like he did for the Dark Lord. “Yes, Sir.” He kept his gaze low.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Good. You will make an appointment with my tailor and hairdresser immediately.” With a flick of his wandless wrist, Dumbledore unstuck Vernon, and stacked the Dursleys’ up like logs. “As for their offspring, we should send him to that Muggle orphanage Lord Verger sponsored in a fit of penetrant joy upon his release from the Imperius curse.” A smile, one with far too many teeth exposed slid across Dumbledore’s face, at odds with the jaunty wizards hat atop his white hair.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Severus shuddered. At least the Dark Lord had the courtesy to look the part.</p><p align="center">

</p><p>
  <b>7 years later…</b>
</p><p>Albus Hannibal Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore walked up to the two story house on Spinner’s End. The neighborhood had cleaned up since his first visit, years ago. It seemed Severus had worked to make it a proper environment to raise William.</p><p>Initially there had been objections to Severus Bloom, a wizard of questionable repute, raising William Potter, the only surviving member of the Potter family. However, with young William’s Godfather, Sirius Black, in Azkaban for mass murder, there was little people could do. (Dumbledore was still surprised he didn’t have to do anything about Black. The man lost his mind after the death of the Potters. It was only a matter of making sure the man didn’t get a trial.) It was only a matter of a few forged documents, and it seemed that Lily Potter wanted her childhood friend to raise William if anything happened to Black.</p><p>Dumbledore knocked on the door.</p><p>Severus answered. Severus’ dark hair was clean, tied back in a low pony tail with a black silk ribbon. He wore rich black robes, closing shut with a silver clasp. He even smelled lightly of cologne.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Albus was impressed. He had not expected the young man to learn poise so quickly. But after he’d spoken to Severus at the Dursley’s, and yes, Albus admitted, he did lay it on a bit thick, Severus had shaped up immediately. It was a vast improvement from the scrawny, acne ridden young man that had come crawling to Dumbledore years ago.</p><p>“Albus.” Severus greeted, ushering him inside. The home was cozy, filled with warm light and books.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The patter of little footsteps revealed a young boy. There was William Potter, dressed in neat black robes, and an apron. The boy’s black hair was neatly tamed—well as neatly tamed as possible. It seemed William had inherited his father’s unruly mop.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Professor Dumbledore.” The boy politely greeted. “We’re cooking dinner.”</p><p>Dumbledore smiled. He’d offered to take William under his wing and teach him how to properly cook. Strangely, Severus had demurred. He supposed one day he’d have to force the issue, but for now, he would leave it be.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Would you care to join us?” Severus asked, a slight tension in his voice.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“My pleasure.” Dumbledore replied, following them into the kitchen.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“How is your day?” Dumbledore asked William.</p><p>“I received my letter!” William excitedly exclaimed. “I’m meeting Neville and Draco in Diagon Alley tomorrow. We’re going to pick up our books!” Young William beamed.</p><p>Despite Severus and William largely keeping to themselves, as Severus spent the years running a mail-order potions service, Albus wanted William to have all the advantages of a pureblood education.</p><p>And socialization was an important aspect. It was important that William meet other young witches and wizards of his age. After all, William would one day sit on the Wizengamot, and it was important he develop connections with his future peers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>So Albus was glad William had befriended Neville Longbottom. Even though the boy was by all accounts magically inept, and there was worry he might be a squib, he was the last of the Longbottoms.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Draco Malfoy was perhaps the stranger friend. Albus supposed it was no surprise the two met, as Severus was Draco’s Godfather. He was just surprised that William would tolerate Draco. Though, now he thought about it, it was unsurprising William had a less than charitable view of Muggles after his experience with his Aunt and Uncle.</p><p>It wasn’t that Albus disliked Muggles. He didn’t hate them like Voldemort, but he found they were often far more rude, all gaping and pointing, treating Wizards like freak shows at a Carnival. And they had no idea of the proper etiquette of pure blood culture.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“William, why don’t you set the dining room for three. It seems Professor Dumbledore will be joining us for dinner.”</p><p>William nodded eagerly, and rushed off.</p><p>Dumbledore scanned the kitchen. Severus was sautéing some greens on the stove, while a pot occasionally stirred itself on the stove. “I’d like to celebrate your new post, as Potions Master at Hogwarts, and the new Head of Slytherin House.”</p><p>“What?” Severus exclaimed, before quickly schooling his expression. He stepped away from the stove. “I was not aware that Professor Slughorn was retiring.”</p><p>A thin smile flickered across Albus’ lips. “Neither does he.”</p><p>A barely imperceptible shudder flickered though the new Potions Master.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="center">***</p><p>Gellert Wilhelm Grindelwald sat on the cold stone floor of his Nurmengard cell, with nothing but the steady drops of leaking water to keep him company. He’d lost count, the repetitive, drip, drip, drip, of water on stone driving him half mad. Even the rats didn’t bother to visit anymore.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p><em>He </em>was the only one who visited.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>And <em>He </em>hadn’t visited in years.</p><p>He heard the grating sound of metal on stone, as a door in the hallway outside his cell opened. Anticipation flooded through him, and he steadied himself for the inevitable meeting. Subconsciously, he futilely trying to smooth back his matted, disheveled hair. His ankle chaffed at the metal chain, connecting him to the iron bed, with its sad, flat, stained mattress. Helpless with all the wards, his natural magic fully suppressed.</p><p>He counted the steps down the hallway. He’d long since given up trying to escape. A series of coughs wracked his thin body.</p><p>A muttered spell, and the metal door swung open.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Standing in the entryway, was his most hated companion, his only visitor, and the love of his life, Albus Hannibal Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore. His soulmate. True, honest to Merlin, soulmate. An occurrence so rare in the Wizarding world, it was rarely written about. The two of them had delved deep into the matter, learning everything there was. Just like they had delved deep into every magical matter, healing arts, warding arts, even the dark arts. Hannibal and Will they called each other. For years they were inseparable.</p><p>Now, the man standing before him was Professor Dumbledore. Gellert would not deign to use the familiar with the man. The Hannibal in Will’s heart had died long ago, and that Will had too.</p><p>“Why are you here?” Gellert spitted venom, then doubled over into another coughing fit.</p><p>“Such a polite greeting.” Professor Dumbledore replied, as he conjured a very comfortable looking leather chair.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>He still cut an impressive figure in his blue and orange plaid robes, and paisley tie. He’d aged though, Gellert though. There were even more wrinkles around his eyes, and his hair was completely white, not its old vibrant red. In that moment, Gellert wondered how he had aged. Not well, he thought. He hadn’t seen a mirror in decades.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Let’s try again,” Professor Dumbledore continued. “Hello Will, how are you enjoying this pleasant day?”</p><p>Gellert scowled at Albus’ use of his nickname. “Just peachy. I’m chained to a bed, with only enough room to get to my food and use the bathroom.”</p><p>“Well, if you hadn’t attacked me for my wand four years ago, you’re wouldn’t be.”</p><p>“You deserved it.”</p><p>Professor Dumbledore remained impassive, as if Gellert completely bored him. “If you’re on good behavior today, I can have a word with the wardens and see if they might remove your leash. Perhaps they will listen to my suggestion.”</p><p>Gellert scoffed. “Of course they’ll listen to you. This entire prison you run, oh Supreme Mugwump.” His voice dripped with sarcasm.</p><p>“Now, is that the way to speak to an old friend?”</p><p>“Old friend,” Gellert broke into a pained, hysterical laugh. “You framed me!” He shouted, rage curling up in his stomach. The wounds breaking open once more. “You destroyed my life. How long can you keep this up this charade?” He started wheezing and coughing. Every day this damned cough got worse. Even with his magic suppressed, it was only a matter of time before he succumbed to it.</p><p>Professor Dumbledore looked up in thought, and placidly replied. “Oh, it’s been over 40 years, and no one has commented.”</p><p>“People think I was the evil wizard trying to destroy Europe!” Gellert shouted in frustration. Even after all this time, he still felt the betrayal, the pain in his chest when he learned of Dumbledore’s role in the chaos on the continent, and the true reason he wanted the Deathly Hollows. Simply, Dumbledore had been bored, and decided to create a suitable enemy for himself. When he tired of the role, poor Gellert was his scapegoat.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“You found the Elder Wand. You were trying to stop me. Had I not stepped in, you would have hurt yourself. And I couldn’t bear to see you hurt, Will.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Professor Dumbledore always said that. “You have a funny way of showing you care.”</p><p>“Now I know where you are. <em>Always.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em></p><p>Gellert cringed at the sudden intensity in Professor Dumbledore’s dark eyes. They burned with that covetous gleam that once he had found so enthralling, and now found terrifying. Taking a deep breath, Gellert asked, “Why are you even here?”</p><p>Professor Dumbledore rose, dispelling the chair with a flick of his wandless wrist. “I suppose I felt nostalgic. Young William Potter starts Hogwarts soon. I thought I’d visit his namesake.”</p><p>“‘William Potter’? You changed his name? You old controlling bastard.”</p><p>Professor Dumbledore continued walking towards the door. “I see you have no interest in holding a conversation. Enjoy your solitude.”</p><p>The door closed behind him with a loud clank.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Gellert wanted to shout for him to comeback. Not only out of desperation for human contact, but because part of him wanted to see <em>Him. </em>A pathetic part wanted to try and find Hannibal again, go back to how it used to be, before the awful betrayal. But he kept his dignity and remained silent. He punched the floor in frustration.</p><p>He swore. It hurt.</p><p align="center">***</p><p>
  <strong>And a sneak peek for next time…</strong>
</p><p>Minerva Du Maurier McGonagall sat at the faculty table looking out into the Great Hall. The chatter of excited students filled the air, as they flowed into the room. Hearing the sound of the chair next to her move, she turned.</p><p>Albus was dressed in full start of term splendor, in red and gold paisley dress robes, with a matching hat. He wore a smug smile and his eyes twinkled. It was clear he was up to no good.</p><p>“What have you done now.” She asked pointedly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“I’ve taken the liberty to remove the Confundus charm on the sorting hat.”</p><p>“What charm?” Minerva asked, looking up abruptly.</p><p>“It appears one of the former headmasters put a charm on the hat. For the past century, if a student thought strongly that they belonged in a house, the sorting hat would oblige.” The mischievous smile on Dumbledore’s face grew. “Now, it will place them where they truly belong, not where they think they belong.”</p><p>“That will cause chaos.”</p><p>He leaned back in his chair, an air of smug satisfaction swirling around him. “I expect so. But it is important young William ends up where he truly belongs. If some Weasley gets sorted into Slytherin, well, I will just have to incinerate the inevitable Howler.”</p><p>Minerva suppressed a groan, and reached for her goblet and frowned. Something far more stronger than pumpkin juice was needed.</p><p> </p>
