    <p>“Fear not, my child, for no harm will come to you. I’m always watching over you… My dear, sweet child.”</p><p>
  <em>500 years. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>500. Years. </em>
</p><p><em>That’s how I’ve been asleep. 500 years.</em> Bayonetta thought to herself as she stared into the tickled pink cocktail. <em>A lot must have happened in the 500 years and I don’t remember a goddamn thing about myself or where I come from. </em></p><p>But there is two thing that I do know: I know is that I’m a witch and that I hate angels.</p><p>Madama Butterfly told me that for certain. Madama Butterfly is an infernal demon, whom I made a pact with 500 years ago. She said that it was a common practice that umbran witches, like myself, to trade their souls in order to gain power and access to other infernal demons, as well as wisdom. She has been very helpful in helping me try to gain my memories, albeit subtly. She does say much more than what she’s already told me but it’s nice to know she’s there to help me when I need it. Madama Butterfly also hates angels. She often says that ‘she has a fever and the only cure to it is more dead angels.’</p><p>Angels come into different shapes and sizes. The most common types are the Affinities and the Dear &amp; Decorations. Sometimes there’ll an enchant or a big, bad Beloved looking to get their fix, but I handle them pretty easily. They were there when I first woke up from 500-year slumber and have stuck around since. They never cease to amaze me with how dumb and ugly they are. Always coming after me when I’m out and about. But lately they’ve been cutting back on our game of cat and mouse. It’s kind of relaxing but it doesn’t mean I get to let my guard down.</p><p>On top of that, I don’t even know how I ended up in that casket at the bottom of the lake in Vigrid or my real name. I was given the name “Bayonetta” by Rodin, the weaponsmith and the owner of the Gates of Hell, also known as the Dump by some, a bar in the back alley of Manhattan. Although I know it’s not my real name, it seems to fit me like a glove.</p><p>“-netta.” Came a voice. “Bayonetta.”</p><p>Looking up from my glass, I stared into red tinted-black eyes. The dark-skinned weaponsmith wore a smug look on his face. “Did you say something, Rodin?”</p><p>Sighing, he grabbed at a glass under the bar and began to dry it. “As a matter of fact, I did. But I guess, you aren’t really in the mood for long stories, so I’ll cut it short this time. There’s a school in Scotland called Hogwarts. They teach young people, like yourself, how to use and control magic.”</p><p>“Go on.” I said, taking a sip of my cocktail. “From what I’ve heard, it’s the best of the best when it comes to wizarding schools. There was war there a couple months ago and they’re welcoming new students for the new school year. I thought maybe you’d be interested in going there since you are from around there. I spoke to some friends and they said, ‘You should be eligible to enroll.’” Opening his jacket, he reached into one of its inner pockets and pulled out parchment paper. “I thought you’d say ‘yes’ so I signed up.”</p><p>He handed the paper to me. “It’s an acceptance from the school. I had a few friends pull some strings and get to talkin’ with the headmaster. They said he took an interest in you and that he could maybe help you.”</p><p>On the parchment, it said:</p><p>“Dear Ms. Bayonetta, We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted you at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Students shall be required to report to the Chamber of Reception upon arrival. We will await no later than 31st July. Please make your way to Kings Cross Station onto Platform 9 ¾ where you will meet the Hogwarts Express. Terms begins 1st September. We very much look forward to receiving you as part of the new generation of Hogwarts Heritage. Sincerely, Professor Filius Flitwick Deputy Headmaster</p><p>“Cheeky.” I said, rereading the letter again. “How do I get there? It’s not like I can fly or anything.” Behind me, the door opened and in walked Enzo.</p><p>“Speak of the devil.”</p><p>The foul-loud-mouthed Italian stopped in his steps. “FUGGETABOUTIT! Whatever you have planning, cut me out. I’ve got enough going on. With the kids about to be born. I ain’t got no more strength.” He said, taking a seat a couple foot behind me. “How about a beer?”</p><p>“How about a foot up the ass? You still owe from last Wednesday.” Rodin said, taking back the parchment and putting it back into his jacket.</p><p>“Yeah. Yeah.” Enzo said, laying his head down on the table and letting out a big sigh.</p><p>“What the matter, Enzo? It’s not like you to be so…witless.” I said, turning around to face the Italian.</p><p>“Marie went into false labor last night. Or so we thought, she had to take a shit was all. I swear when those damn kids are born-”</p><p>“Now. Now, Enzo. You’re going to love those kids more than you love an easy payday. No need to curse yourself.” I said, grabbing the beer from the counter and walking it over to Enzo, as he sat back up.</p><p>“Thank you.” He said, silently.</p><p>“You’re more than welcome.” I said, patting him on the shoulder as he gulped down the beer. When I arrived back at the counter, Rodin winked.</p><p>“Enzo, you have a jet, don’t you?” The sounding of coughing.</p><p>“Nah-uh. NAH-UH! No. No. Nononononono. I’m not doing any favors until them little fuckers are born. I swore it. Martina’ll kill me.”</p><p>“We never said anything about any favors-”</p><p>"And it doesn't have to be just yet, I have to go to London. Sometime towards the end of the August. I have business to see to there." </p>
