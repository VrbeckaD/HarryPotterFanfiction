  <em> September 1st ‘93, Night </em>
</p>
<p>It is strange returning back to Hogwarts. When walking through the halls, many memories came back to me, many good and many bad ones. These feelings of being lost and alone for most of my life to then come into this great group of friends. Not a day goes by without me missing them, with both James’ and Peter’s deaths, and for Sirius to be in Azkaban because of those deaths; I’ve never felt so alone in my life. But in mentioning Sirius, apparently he had broken out of Azkaban! I know he is a strong wizard, but to be the <em> first </em> wizard to break out of that place, I don’t believe it. But I must believe as there was a commotion on the Hogwarts Express with Dementors invading the train in search for Sirius. I had known this as the compartment I was sleeping in was the one to be attacked. The passengers who were in my compartment when the attack took place was a group of three third-year students, two boys and one girl; it saddens me that the person to be attacked was one of these students; just a child. I was woken up by them when they entered the compartment, they began to talk about Sirius, hearing his name woke me up, but didn't remove the blanket I was using to cover my face for the moonlight from last night; I returned to my slumber about halfway during our travel to Hogwarts. In the time I was awake I had learned the names of the students, Their names were: Harry, Ron, and Hermione; Harry was the student to be attacked, though the Dementor’s presence affected us all. The name Harry was peculiar to me as it reminded me of the name James and Lily gave their child. My suspicion was confirmed in seeing Harry regained consciousness after I defended him from the Dementor. He looked like a miniature James except for his eyes which were identical to Lily’s. My time with Harry had to be cut short as I needed to have an infuriated word with the conductor because who lets Dementors on a train full of students?! Who cares if a murder <em> might </em> be on the train -for whatever reason- that doesn’t mean you endanger children! But I could say the same about Dumbledore, he is the one who hired a werewolf to teach children about other werewolves. I know I shouldn’t hate myself because of my condition; I’ve lived with it for over thirty years, I should know my own limits and how to control myself; and I guess that is what he thinks as well. I don’t want myself to ruin this opportunity, finding work has been hard for years and to have such an amazing offer to teach Defence Against the Dark Arts in the greatest wizarding school to be built, it is truly a blessing that I can’t thank him enough for. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I didn’t have time to look around the campus, the Welcoming Feast in the Great Hall was about to begin and every professor was rushing to get the students inside the campus, the delays from the train is what caused the elated tempo. When coming off the carriages drawn by Thestrals, I was whisked away from the student by professor Sprout who escorted me to my classroom where she had shown me where my materials would go, shen then showed me the teachers commons which was hidden by a secret passageway. The commons had a landing similar to the student’s commons sans house memorabilia; a perfect place to rest, however, no one was resting when we entered. They were all rushing beside each other to get ready for the feast, the adrenalin-filled air made my nerves skyrocket, my eyes were darting back and forth from one professor to another, my heart was racing amidst the chaos. Sprout reassuring me that it’s not always this chaotic as we walked down to a lengthy hallway where the individual bedrooms of the professors where situated. Sprout showed me to my room and left me to unpack my belongings, I had tried to make myself appear more presentable before joining the hustle to the Great Hall. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>When going up the professors table, I noticed gold plagues on the backs of the chairs, each one related to a class and the teacher who taught that class. My chair was seated close to Dumbledore, with only one seat separating us, it only had the “Defence Against the Dark Arts” plaque with the screw holes from where the name would be; they must be tired from constantly replacing it, this amuses me greatly. The seat that was the closest to Dumbledore’s read “Potions - H. Slughorn”, I was excited for this, I remember enjoying Slughorn’s class when attending Hogwarts so to be seated next to him would be amazing. I was one of the last professors but not everyone was here. this gave me time to watch the students shuffle around the cramped hall like ants in an anthill, looking to find their friends at their appropriate house tables. I hadn’t noticed Harry, Ron, or Hermione since the train, even if I can’t see them I know them to be safe from the Dementors inside Hogwarts, hopefully. The sorting ceremony commenced as more of the professors came to the table, I noticed everyone of them: from the scurrying little footsteps of Flitwick, to the booming stomps of Hagrid (who I congratulate for becoming a professor), to the theatrical strut of Snape; which I have the unfortunate privilege of being seated next to as he took Slughorn’s seat. I was confused in the moment and expressed this confusion to him which he retorted with his own petty snarkiness, something definitely onbrand for him; But we were stopped as Dumbledore was making his way to the podium as the sorting ceremony was about to finish. He began his speech by welcoming both new and returning students to Hogwarts, a collective groan came from the older students which seventeen year old me related to, Dumbledore continued his speech by introducing both myself and Hagrid to the students as new professors, I only received a short golf clap where-as Hagrid received a thunderous round of applause; mainly coming from the Gryffindor table. I can understand why they would give me such a reaction compared to Hagrid -I wasn’t the most presentable despite my actions, I was sleeping on a train a few hours ago and no one knows who I am- but I am still your new teacher, would be nice to have <em> some </em>respect; but I won’t hold it against them. Dumbledore finished his speech and the feast commenced. As heartwarming as the speech was, I was starving, my stomach has been churning at the amount of sweets I ate when on the train to keep myself going; I’m now realising how unsafe Hogwarts express is, starting with the diet of sugar they feed the children. But anyways, I had an amazing dinner, helping myself to the roast beef with baked potatoes and other vegetables and the possible liters of pumpkin juice I drank. Eating this food took me back to my days as a student -this whole night has- but in being positive in the moment doesn’t mitigate the fact that there is a murderer on the loose, and the only idea of his whereabouts is somewhere near the school.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I have now soured my own mood because of this thought. I want to enjoy my time at Hogwarts, truly, even if it is for a day, or a week, or a month, or even the whole year; I do not want the memory of one of my friends, a man that I once loved and supported and <u>cherished</u> who was responsible for the death of two of our friends deaths, regardless if he was behind the wand or not; I don’t want this ruined for me! But of course the world around me must put me down and leave me begging for charity and an opportunity for salvation. It seems too perfect for Sirius to break out of Azkaban at this moment, too perfect to ruin my chance of success. But who knows what is going through his head right now. This could all just be a coincidence too, as if I’m a supporting character to the protagonist of a different plot, a plot that revolves around him or her; the universe is demented like that.   </p>
