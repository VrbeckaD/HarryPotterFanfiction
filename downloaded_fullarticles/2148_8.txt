          <div class="userstuff"><p>"Darcy, relax, my mom is going to love you." Fred watched his girlfriend squirm nervously. </p>
<p>“I’m sorry, I’m just really nervous,” Darcy said, biting her lower lip. She looked at her boyfriend of a few months, and butterflies just fluttered about nervously in her stomach. “I mean, meeting your family is a big step… It’s a lot of commitment.”</p>
<p>Fred paused, looking at her warily. “Do you… Are you not…?”</p>
<p>“No, I am!” Darcy blurted, looking at him nervously. “It’s just, Fred, I’ve never been in a committed relationship long. This is all so new to me.”</p>
<p>“It’s new to me, too, Darcy,” Fred said, taking her hands. He brought them to his mouth and pressed a kiss to them. “I’ve never brought a girlfriend home before. Er, well, I’ve never really had anyone who could put up with my long-term.”</p>
<p>Darcy let out a nervous laugh. “Looks like we’re both a nervous mess.” Leaning forward, she kissed Fred gently. </p>
<p>“Yup, but we’re in this together,” Fred told her. He flashed her one of his charming grins. “Now, are you ready to Floo there?”</p>
<p>“If it means you get to hold me close, I’m ready now,” Darcy said, moving into his embrace. With a reassuring kiss from Fred, she knew that she was ready to meet his family.</p></div>
