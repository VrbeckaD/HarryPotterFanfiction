    <p>Harry sat on the worn sofa with his legs pulled up to his chest and a smudged photo frame in his hands. The glass had several cracks in it. A simple <em>Reparo</em> could fix it, but Harry couldn’t bring himself to cast the spell. He was fine with the cracked glass.</p><p>He stared, unblinking, at the old photograph and sighed, then sluggishly dragged his gaze up to the clock on the wall and frowned.</p><p>It was the middle of the night, well past midnight, and Harry wasn’t even remotely tired. He couldn’t quite remember the last time he’d gone to bed at a decent hour.</p><p>These last few months, insomnia had become a constant companion and at this stage, he was loath to change anything about that. Not even downright exhaustion could convince him to down a phial of Dreamless Sleep to help him get some rest. It wasn’t like a single night of twelve hours of rest would change anything. It wasn’t going to stop the inevitable from happening. It wasn’t going to stop the tightness in his chest and it certainly wasn’t going to unbreak his heart and fix the extraordinary mess his life had become.</p><p>The door to the living room opened and Draco walked in. He stood with his hand still resting on the doorknob and their eyes met.</p><p>Harry swallowed hard.</p><p>“This is it then, isn’t it?” he whispered. “I’m really going to lose you tonight, aren’t I?”</p><p>Draco remained silent and Harry let his eyes sweep over the tall lithe frame. He was too thin and he looked pale, much paler than usual. It was a sickly pale and Harry couldn’t stand looking at it. His eyes were watery and bloodshot with deep, dark baggy circles beneath them. He looked hollow like he couldn’t quite fathom how standing upright was still a viable option his body was capable of.</p><p><em>You’ve been crying again</em>, Harry thought bitterly and tensed at the sound of cracking and popping of muscle and sinew as his heart painfully shattered inside his chest. He was quite sure that there was nothing left to break but felt too restless and too impetuous to focus his thoughts and calm his mind.</p><p>The complete absence of sound in the room made Harry fidget with the photo frame in his hands. The silence, it was agonising and bone-chilling and he couldn’t stand it. It made him want to scream and he opened his mouth to do so, then choked up and surrendered. He wanted to get up, stalk across the room and throw himself at Draco and force him to stay but he knew that there was nothing he could do.</p><p>Draco’s soft sigh reverberated around the room. He smiled weakly but it didn’t reach his eyes. Harry was sure that he wasn’t even aware of the fact that the corners of his mouth had curled themselves upward. That smile, it wasn’t even real, it was just a pathetic attempt at masking his own heartbreak and at drawing out the inevitable. It was going to happen tonight. They’d ignored it for as long as possible, had done everything imaginable to refuse to acknowledge the truth. They’d played the game with their heads held high but the last pawn had fallen and they had no choice but to succumb.</p><p>“Don’t go,” Harry whispered feebly.</p><p>Draco’s shoulders sagged, his smile disappeared and a lone tear ran down his cheek. He turned away and scrambling to get to his feet, Harry stood in front of the sofa, feeling lost. He reached out as if to pull Draco close but made no move to close the distance between them. There was no point, he couldn’t stop Draco and as crazy and cruel as it sounded, he didn’t want to. He knew he had to let go.</p><p>For old times’ sake, he wanted one last hug, one last embrace but he couldn’t bring himself to ask for it. The words remained stuck in his throat and he struggled to swallow past the big lump that stubbornly refused to dissolve.</p><p>Draco sensed his desire and turning, he strode across the room with a grace that, given the situation, was admirable. He wrapped his arms around him and Harry dropped the photo frame and reciprocated.</p><p>He engulfed Draco in a bone-crushing embrace that left them both breathless. They stared at each other and wordlessly allowed their mouths to clash together as they indulged in one last kiss, one last moment of passion.</p><p>The kiss went on forever, or so it felt like.</p><p>Neither one of them wanted to be the first one to break away and as they kissed, Harry remembered the very first time they’d locked lips. He remembered their first date and the first time they’d danced together and the first time they’d said <em>I love you</em> and the first time they’d made love; the first time they’d fought as a couple and the first time they’d made up.</p><p>He remembered a lot of firsts and each memory fuelled the sour stabbing knot of tension inside his stomach as he sharply inhaled through his mouth and a moaned cry escaped his wet lips. Draco swallowed it and even though he hadn’t left yet a strange sort of emptiness filled Harry. An acute awareness that something important was about to go missing overwhelmed him and he stubbornly hugged Draco tighter and held him closer as the hurt rattled through his body all over again.</p><p><em>Home</em>, Harry thought and whined when Draco finally pulled away from the kiss, stepped out of his embrace and stared at him, wide-eyed and with quivering lips. He opened his mouth as if to speak, then shook his head and averted his gaze. Harry yearned for the palpable, humming of his sweet voice, a sound he knew so well, too well.</p><p>Draco made a second attempt and succeed.</p><p>“I’m— <em>bye</em>.”</p><p>He turned and stepped out into the hallway. Harry followed but remained standing in the doorframe. He leant against it, watched Draco bent over to pick up his holdall, open the front door and leave without a backward glance.</p><p>The door fell closed with a loud thud and Harry slid down the doorframe, hugged his knees to his chest, shuddered, and let the deep throes of heartbreak consume him as the first of many sobs tore through him. A parade of raining tears stung his eyelids and fell, soaking through his clothes. He held his breath, then exhaled and pathetically tried to grasp onto something, <em>anything</em>, that would keep him from falling apart.</p>
