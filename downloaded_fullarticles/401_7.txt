    <p>Pain.</p>
<p>Everything hurt.</p>
<p>Harry feels a lot like that time during the battle when he’d fallen down multiple flights of stairs in Hogwarts.</p>
<p>He groans and tries to move. A small body, that he is still holding tightly, is squirming against his chest.</p>
<p>Teddy.</p>
<p>He blinks his eyes open and groaned again. Merlin, that is one hell of a headache. There is dust everywhere around him and he sits up, trying to figure out what has happened.</p>
<p>There is rubble everywhere. Destroyed walls. He’s seen it enough helping out at Hogwarts the last few months, trying to get the castle repaired enough that the school is safe before September.</p>
<p>He can’t have been unconscious for long, since the dust hasn’t quite settled yet.</p>
<p>This is worse though. This is destruction on a scale he hadn’t even seen during the final battle, and a big part of Hogwarts had been destroyed. This though…</p>
<p>He rubs at his face and his fingers come back bloody.</p>
<p>Just great.</p>
<p>Teddy starts whimpering, and Harry tries to rock him to silence.</p>
<p>What the hell has happened?</p>
<p>Next to him, someone groans and he startles. He’s not alone in this… Madness? Destruction?</p>
<p>The rubble rises and Hermione peeks out from under it. There is a barely-there look on her face, but she reaches out to him with a hand. Harry grasps it tightly and pulls her to him.</p>
<p>She exclaims in pain, slumps against him and immediately falls back unconscious.</p>
<p>That can’t be good. Right?</p>
<p>“Check over there!” A voice sounds vaguely in the distance.</p>
<p>“We found another one alive!”</p>
<p>Harry clears his throat, ready to try and call out for help.</p>
<p>Then he hears a loud noise, and he flinches back.</p>
<p>What the hell was that?</p>
<p>Again and again, and again, the noise echoes through his head, because he knows that voice. He’s heard it enough while hiding in his cupboard and Dudley was watching action movies on the telly.</p>
<p>But… that can’t be… right?</p>
<p>What is going on?</p>
<p>“Took care of that one!”</p>
<p>“Good job, keep looking for more. We don’t want any of them getting away.”</p>
<p>Merlin, is this really what he fears this is?</p>
<p>Teddy cries out, loudly. Harry curses.</p>
<p>“What is that?”</p>
<p>“Check that area.”</p>
<p>He holds both Teddy and Hermione tightly to him and apparates.</p>
<p>He goes to the first place he can think of, and they land just outside the Burrow.</p>
<p>With wide eyes, he loses his balance and they go down. Falling to the ground.</p>
<p>Because the Burrow is on fire.</p>
<p>It’s one big bonfire, and there are people in dark uniforms and helmets standing around it. But Harry doesn’t notice the people, too distracted by seeing his second home so utterly destroyed.</p>
<p>The sudden pain in his legs brings him back to the present. Crookshanks has joined them and attached himself around one of Harry’s legs, the cat having clawed himself stuck and now hissing at everything around them.</p>
<p>Teddy cries out, again, loudly.</p>
<p>Pain explodes in his shoulder, and Harry apparates again. He has to hold everyone extra tight, because the pain almost made him let go of Teddy.</p>
<p>When he lands this time, he immediately gets up, dragging Hermione up with him. Well he sure tries, and Crookshanks uses his claws to climb up Harry’s body to settle on his shoulders.</p>
<p>Harry hisses in pain. Merlin, his shoulder! He doesn’t dare to look. He is distracted by the sight before him.</p>
<p>Hogwarts is gone. Or at least, it is completely destroyed. This is so much worse than what Voldemort had ever done, at any point in time. If he didn’t know where he was, he wouldn’t have recognized the place.</p>
<p>It’s almost like someone dropped a bomb here, a big one.</p>
<p>He flinches at those thoughts, but… he can’t think of anything else that could cause this amount of destruction.</p>
<p>No time to think! People are still around. People in the same uniforms as before.</p>
<p>He needs to get out of here.</p>
<p>Where to go? If even Hogwarts isn’t safe anymore?</p>
<p>He apparates again, for the third time. His leg gives out and he crashes to the ground.</p>
<p>He cries out in pain. Teddy matches his cries and Harry feels so bad he can’t comfort the baby right now.</p>
<p>He frantically tries to get up, to look around. Are they safe? Here?</p>
<p>He’s sitting on a beach, and Shell Cottage lies before them.</p>
<p>No one is outside.</p>
<p>And the house still looks fine, exactly as it always had been.</p>
<p>For a brief second he wonders why he came here, and not, say, Grimmauld Place. Then he grimaces. The old Black house hadn’t been safe for so long, especially during the war, while Shell Cottage had hid them even from Voldemort.</p>
<p>Bill had been the secret keeper and Harry hadn’t even been able to see it the first time he came here, clutching Dobby’s dead body to himself. Bill had had to come out and tell him, before he could be brought inside, back then.</p>
<p>Harry allows himself time to take a few shaky breaths, before he decides to move again.</p>
<p>He struggles up, shaking, now that he finally might be somewhat safe. Need to check first though, need to be sure. Can’t risk the others like this, can’t risk it.</p>
<p>Crookshanks lets go, jumps down into the sand, and heads towards the house. Harry let’s go of Hermione, adjusts Teddy to his less-hurt shoulder and finally takes out his wand. He levitates his friends and approaches the house carefully.</p>
<p>Something is strange here. Teddy has been making enough noise that Bill and Fleur should have come out already to see what is going on.</p>
<p>Maybe… no, no thinking about them having been at the Burrow, not right now.</p>
<p>He opens the door, and peeks inside. Nothing seems out of place.</p>
<p>“Bill? Fleur?” he steps inside. “Anyone here?”</p>
<p>No response. He takes a deep breath. “Homenum Revelio”</p>
<p>Nothing. So while the Weasleys aren’t here, there isn’t anyone else either.</p>
<p>He levitates Hermione into one of the guest rooms and finally turns towards the crying baby in his arms.</p>
<p>Priorities now.</p>
<p>He needs to get Teddy calmed down enough to see if he is hurt, and he needs to sure Hermione is alright.</p>
<p>He’s not sure how though. She had always been the one to heal them when they’d gotten hurt, especially while hunting horcruxes. </p>
<p>He doesn’t have anything on him. No gear, no beaded bag, no potions…?</p>
<p>No potions?</p>
<p>He walks into the kitchen, remembering Fleur had kept some potions on hand to help them all when they’d crashed here. If he recalls correctly, she kept them in the cupboard above right here. He pulls it open. Bingo.</p>
<p>He immediately spots some pain relief potion, grabs it and chugs it down.</p>
<p>Immediately the pain lessens in his body, but also in his head.</p>
<p>Only now, with the fading adrenaline and pain, does he realise how badly his head had hurt, how his shoulder still hurts, and how his body aches so badly he’ll probably be completely back and blue tomorrow.</p>
<p>He takes a deep breath and cuddles Teddy into his less-bad shoulder. He's shaking, but he manages to calm the baby down while walking around the house.</p>
<p>The room that had housed Ollivander the last time he’d been here, was halfway done being redecorated.</p>
<p>A nursery.</p>
<p>He refuses to let himself think too much about that. He can guess what it means, but seeing the current mess, he doesn’t want to risk thinking about what could have happened to Bill and Fleur.</p>
<p>Can’t allow himself to think like that, because both Teddy and Hermione depend on him right now. He needs to keep it together.</p>
<p>He needs to.</p>
<p>He sets Teddy down in the cot to sleep, and even gives the boy one of the plushies that lies around. It’s a bunny, nothing with any special meaning, but the boy hugs it tightly as he goes to sleep. He must be exhausted.</p>
<p>He casts a monitoring charm around the cot, like Andromeda had taught him and goes to check on Hermione.</p>
<p>With a wet cloth he washes as much of the blood away as he can. She had a wound on her head, in her hair, and he washes that clean as well. Apart from that, she doesn’t look too hurt. A few bruises, a few cuts here and there. He cleans what he can. Just to be sure he casts the same charm on her as he did with Teddy and then leaves her to rest.</p>
<p>He makes his way into the bathroom and watches himself in the mirror. He has a nasty cut on the left side of his face that still bleeds a bit. Making a quick decision he strips off his shirt, wanting to take a shower. It’s only then that he sees the damage to his left shoulder. The potion had taken away most of the pain, so he hadn’t paid it any more attention until now.</p>
<p>There is a hole in his shoulder.</p>
<p>A hole.</p>
<p>He pokes gently at it and promptly flinches.</p>
<p>There is something inside.</p>
<p>He gulps, takes a deep breath, and as gently as he can tries to get whatever is in there out.</p>
<p>It’s painful, and the bleeding starts again, but he can only stare at the object in his hand.</p>
<p>A… bullet?</p>
<p>And then everything comes crashing down.</p>
<p>Muggles.</p>
<p>Those had been Muggles.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>How?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>He sits down on the floor, stunned beyond belief. But he can’t deny the truth now that he’s allowed himself to think it. The word had been on the tip of his tongue, just a thought shy of forming…</p>
<p>He hadn’t allowed himself to think it before, but now…</p>
<p>Yeah, Muggles.</p>
<p>Muggles have come and decided to bomb them? To kill off every wizard out there? He had heard them talking to each other. Had heard them shooting someone, maybe multiple people even.</p>
<p>Had they really bombed Hogwarts? What about the wards? Had they somehow gotten through?</p>
<p>Who was he kidding, of course they had. He had seen it for himself.</p>
<p>He had seen the destruction, and the fire, and…</p>
<p>He curses.</p>
<p>Harry had never really taken the Statue of Secrecy serious. Sure, it was law, one not to be broken, but only because it had gotten him into trouble.</p>
<p>He’d never actually thought this might be a possible consequence if Muggles found out about the Wizarding World.</p>
<p>Sure, he knew the Dursleys, but he had honestly thought those Muggles were the exception to the rule.</p>
<p>He’d thought that his trial before fifth year had purely been a power play by Fudge. He’d never taken into account that he’d done magic in a Muggle neighbourhood. Dudley already knew about magic, right? So why had it mattered that much?</p>
<p>All he’d been able to see was how unfair they had been to him.</p>
<p>Now, he thinks he’s gotten off easy.</p>
<p>Merlin, they hadn’t even been really punished for flying the Weasley’s car to Hogwarts… Sure they’d gotten detention, but… honestly. Neither of them had thought they’d done anything wrong. Neither of them had realised just what they’d done. The gravity of it. No, they had basked in the compliments of the other students.</p>
<p>He feels sick.</p>
<p>He briefly gets why Voldemort had been so anti-Muggle. If this what they could and would do? Maybe…</p>
<p>He gets sick, barely making it to the toilet in time.</p>
<p>No, he can’t think like that. Voldemort was a lunatic, no matter what happened after him. He’d been killing people (Muggle and wizarding folk) left and right as it pleased him.</p>
<p>There is no way that Harry could suddenly start agreeing with… No, no matter what anyone thought, humans were all equal. Whether it was Voldemort and his Dead Eaters killing Muggles and others, or Muggles killing Wizarding folk, did not matter. It was horrible and wrong either way!</p>
<p>He feels so overwhelmed he wants to laugh, because if he doesn’t laugh, he’ll cry, and at this point he’s not sure he’ll ever be able to stop again.</p>
<p>So he lets himself chuckle hysterically into the toilet for a while.</p>
<p>Mr. Weasley had always been so fascinated by Muggles, as if they were children who were doing something extraordinary. Harry had looked upon the man with fondness because of it.</p>
<p>Now…</p>
<p>Merlin, he hopes the Weasleys got out before the Burrow had burst into flames… He feels bad now, for leaving there without checking. For not going inside to make sure and help them if he could.</p>
<p>He knows it’s stupid to think this. So stupid. What could he have done? With Teddy in one arm and Hermione in the other? He’d even gotten shot! What help would he have been? It would have gotten them all killed…</p>
<p>Still, he can’t help but feel guilty.</p>
<p>This bloody saving people thing, as Hermione had called it so long ago.</p>
<p>He stands up and takes a shower after his little revelation. Once he feels he can stand without being sick again that is.</p>
<p>The water helps, like it is trying to wash his pain, depression and hopelessness away.  </p>
<p>Under the water stream he allows himself to remember what actually happened.</p>
<p>He’d been at St. Mungo’s with Teddy. The baby had just gotten his dragon pox vaccination and had been very unhappy with him. She had been busy that day, so he’d proposed to take Teddy, and he had.</p>
<p>On the way out he’d run into a nervous Hermione. They’d barely started talking, with Harry asking what was wrong, when the world had exploded.</p>
<p>After his shower and after taking care of his wounds, he had a plan.</p>
<p>For now, Shell Cottage is safe, but he needs to know if anyone else… No, he needs to know where others are.</p>
<p>He needs to get in touch with them, make sure they are safe.</p>
<p>“Expecto Patronum.”</p>
<p>Prongs appears into the kitchen and Harry takes a deep breath. Here goes nothing.</p>
<p>“Message to Ron Weasley: Did you get out safe? Where are you? I have Hermione with me at your brother’s place.”</p>
<p>He nods at Prongs to take the message, but the Patronus doesn’t go. It stays in the kitchen.</p>
<p>“What the? Take my message!”</p>
<p>Prongs shakes his head in a movement that moves almost his entire being.</p>
<p>Panics grip him. No…</p>
<p>“Message to Bill Weasley: Where are you? I’m at your place with Teddy and Hermione. Do you know if the others are alright?”</p>
<p>Prongs doesn’t move.</p>
<p>Harry tries again, and again, and again. He tries to send messages to Neville, Luna, George, Molly, the other Weasleys, Kingsley, McGonagall… To everyone he can think of.</p>
<p>Nothing changes.</p>
<p>“Just go!! Go find someone!! Anyone!!” He yells out as he falls to the ground, unable to stop the tears now.</p>
<p>Prongs stomps his hove, and then, it turns around and leaves.</p>
<p>Harry takes a few shaky breaths, trying to stop his tears and push away the feelings of loss, panic and despair.</p>
<p>There might still be hope yet.</p>
<p>There has to be.</p>
<p>They can’t be all that is left! They can’t be.</p>
<p>Please, don’t let them all be dead. Please…</p>
