  <strong>Chapter 1: That Young Master, receiving a request</strong>
</p>
<p>Ciel stared questionably at the piece of paper in his hands.</p>
<p>The letter had arrived this morning addressed to him, from no other than her majesty the Queen. Why he was so confused by it was a whole different matter- he was used to letters from the Queen, being the Queen’s watch dog and all, but the things she had mentioned in this letter are absurd! Magic? How could such thing exist? Her request was strange, to infiltrate a school for children with ‘magical capabilities’ to see if this magical power does exist, and whether it is a threat. He himself doubted it was a threat, although he also doubted it is real.</p>
<p>“Something troubling you, young master?”</p>
<p>Ciel looked over the top of the letter to see Sebastian standing in front of his desk. In his hands he held a silver tray with tea and cakes resting on top.</p>
<p>“Another request from the Queen. Prepare my luggage immediately Sebastian, we shall be spending the next year at Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry.”</p>
