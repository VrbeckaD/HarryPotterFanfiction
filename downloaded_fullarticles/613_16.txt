    <hr/><p> </p><p>                Looking back on it, was there really anyone to blame?   One could hardly blame a child.  Nor could one blame careless words that had not ever been meant to be taken as they were.  And naturally, blaming others innocents that has no control over the situation was out of the question as well.  It had been a perfect storm of misunderstanding, day-dreaming, and stubbornness. </p><p>                A storm indeed.</p><p>                It had started just after the Potter boys were put on the Hogwart’s Express in September.  James Sirius had been his usual mischievous, teasing self.  Albus Severus has been worried about the sorting.  Harry and Ginny were supportive and proud.  All of which was completely normal.</p><p>                Except for the Potter’s little girl.  Lily Luna Potter had been so upset to be left behind.  Why she even missed her big brother James, who teased her greatly and annoyed her to no end during the summer months.  And she wanted to be there for Albus, because she hated to see him sad.   But, she was too young to go; she had another two years to wait!</p><p>                Two years!   Practically an eternity!</p><p>                Ginny was sure that within a few days, Lily would be fine.  She’d settle in and enjoy the quiet and having Number Twelve Grimmauld Place to herself.   However, the Saturday three weeks after her brother’s departure, Lily was no better than she had been an hour after arrive home from King’s Cross Station.</p><p>                “Do you want a cup of tea?”  Ginny asked, gently.  She and Lily were sitting at the long kitchen table, Lily dispassionately flipping through an old, worn out book.</p><p>                “No,” Lily said, her frown firmly etched on her pretty face.  “Thank you.”</p><p>                “How about a biscuit?” Ginny offered.</p><p>                “No.”  Lily flipped a page, though it as clear she wasn’t really reading it.</p><p>                “I know,” Ginny said brightly.  “How about a Pumpkin Pasty?  Daddy got a huge bunch of them when he was in Hogsmeade a few weeks ago!”</p><p>                Lily shook her head, flipping another page.</p><p>                Ginny was really worried now.  Turning down a cup of tea or a biscuit was bad enough.  But to turn down a Honeyduke’s Pumpkin Pasty, Lily’s absolute favorite, was nearly unthinkable.  This was not good.  But she did understand.  She been where her daughter was years ago.  “Sweetie, you’ll be at Hogwart’s before you know it.”</p><p>                “Not this year,” Lily countered, her frown deepening.  “Or next!”</p><p>                “No … but—”    </p><p>                “That’s like … forever!”</p><p>                Ginny sighed.  What could she do?   “Why don’t you invite Hugo over?”</p><p>                “No.”  Lily was heading into a real pout.</p><p>                “How about inviting over some of the friends you made in Ottery St. Catchpole?”  Over the past summer, the Potter family had stay at the Weasley family home, The Burrow, and Lily had gotten on with a few underage witches who had only recently moved into the neighborhood.  The Floo network made it so easy to move about and while Ginny was sure she would have to entertain the girl’s mother, who would naturally come along, it was fine by her; whatever needed to be done to cheer up her little girl, Ginny would do it.</p><p>                But Lily only shook her head again.  She was not buying what her mother was selling.</p><p>                Ginny deflated.  “Honey … you can’t sit here all day moping about.”</p><p>                “Can’t I?” Lily said, petulantly. </p><p>                Oh my, God.  So, like her father sometimes.  “Well, you have a choice … either sulk all day or go out and make some friends.”</p><p>                “I know what I’m going to do,” Lily said, sliding off her chair and snagging her book by the front cover. </p><p>                Lily stomped her way out of the kitchen and moments later Ginny heard her daughter’s heavy foot falls going up the stairs.  Suddenly the portrait of Missus Black started yelling obscenities, which was followed by Lily’s snarky reply of, “Oh, go tell it to the House Elves!” </p><p>                Ginny just shook her head.  Maybe it was best to leave Lily alone for a while.  However, she intended to talk to Harry when he got back; Harry might have a suggestion or two.  Maybe Harry could invite Teddy Lupin over for a long, extended stay.  Teddy might be able to pull Lily out of her grump; he was so good with Lily.   Or maybe they could send her to stay with Grammy and Pop-pop Weasley, now that they were empty-nesters and Ginny’s father had retired.  Lord knows, if Molly Weasley couldn’t cheer her granddaughter up, then there was no hope left in the world.</p><p>                Not an hour later, Harry Potter arrived home.</p><p>                After a quick kiss hello, Ginny wasted no time in getting to the point.  “We have a problem.”</p><p>                Harry came to a dead stop.  “When you say problem …”</p><p>                “Lily.”</p><p>                Harry was truly surprised.  “What’s wrong?”</p><p>                Ginny recounted the afternoon conversation with her husband and laid out some of her ideas on how to remedy the situation.</p><p>                “Teddy could easily be persuaded.” Harry said.  “However, he is on assignment and out of the area for the next few weeks.”  Teddy was still training with the Auror Department.  “And I worry that if Lily feels ‘abandoned’ by her brother’s absence, wouldn’t she feel even worse if we ship her off to The Burrow?”</p><p>                “Can you take time off?” Ginny asked.  “Maybe we could go away for a week or so … a little family holiday?”  While hard, Ginny could easy do her work for the Daily Prophet while away.</p><p>                But Harry shook his head.  “Normally I’d say yes, but I was asked to lecture at Hogwart’s next week for a few days, and then I have to get on top training the new recruits after that.”</p><p>                Ginny was totally at a loss.  She couldn’t argue with Harry’s reasoning about sending Lily to her grandparents and Ginny knew how important his work was for Harry. </p><p>                “Why can’t she just stay here and play with her friends?”</p><p>                “She didn’t want anyone to come over.”</p><p>                Harry was perplexed.  “Then who does she have upstairs with her?”</p><p>                “No one,” Ginny said.  They did have a free house-elf, Doozy, who came by three times a week, and she often played with Lily while she worked.  But today was Doozy’s off day. </p><p>                Now Harry looked really confused.  “But I could have sworn I heard Lily and someone else talking and laughing when I came in.”</p><p>                Ginny had no idea what Harry was talking about.  But she was very curious.  She immediately headed upstairs, Harry right behind her.  As they passed Missus Black’s portrait, Ginny could see that the thick black cloth that usually covered the painting had fallen into a heap at the foot of the frame, and the shrill picture started calling them all sorts of names; Ginny just rolled her eyes.</p><p>                “Not now,” Ginny said wearily, waving her wand.  The cloth sprang up and covered the old woman, silencing her completely; Harry had placed a Silencio Spell on the covering.  Very effective.</p><p>                As they approached their daughter’s room, even though the door was closed, they could clearly hear Lily happily chattering a mile a minute.  But every now and then a tenor-male voice tried, politely, to interrupt her.  Who the hell was in there with her?</p><p>                Harry grabbed the door-knob and pushed his daughter’s room door open, both he and Ginny stopping in their tracks and looking gaped mouth at the scene before them.</p><p>                In the middle of the room, with their daughter dancing around it, stood the oddest looking … <em>person?</em> … they’d ever seen.   He had curly hair that hung down to his shoulders, leaf-shaped hears showing through, and bright hazel-green eyes.  He was dressed in a little jacket and waistcoat over a beige linen shirt, a jaunty neckerchief tied around his throat.  His dark khaki pants were cut off at mid-calf.  But even more remarkable where the too-big for him feet, covered in curly hair that went up the ankles; it matched the hair on the little man’s head.  There was also a tiny sword strapped around his waist.</p><p>                “Mummy!  Daddy!”  Lily said, jumping up and down.  “This is—”</p><p>                “Are you the parents of this fauntling?”  The little man demanded.</p><p>                “Wha … “ Harry had no words.</p><p>                Ginny could still speak though.  “What did you call her?”</p><p>                “Fauntling,” he repeated.  “Although, I guess <em>child </em>would be the correct term for Men.”</p><p>                “Who the hell are you?!”  Harry asked.</p><p>                The little being raised an eyebrow and his tone became quite pert.  “Really, sir … I think if anyone is entitled to use vulgarities, it would be me!”</p><p>                “This is Bilbo Baggins!”  Lily said, smiling as if she was standing with the King himself.</p><p>                Ginny was at a loss.  “Who?”</p><p>                “Bilbo Baggins, madam,” the little man said, giving Ginny a polite little nod.  “At your service.”</p><p>                Ginny might have been confused but the name was not lost on Harry.  “Holy Sh—”</p><p>                “Sir!” Bilbo quickly reached out with both hands and covered Lily’s ears, giving Harry a pointed glare.  “Really!   To use such language in front of a child!  Even their own!”  Bilbo’s pursed lips and disapproving tone was more than clear.</p><p>                “Do you know this person?!”  Ginny asked her husband.</p><p>                “I can’t see how,” Bilbo said, taking his hands off Lily’s ears.  “I’ve never seen him before today.  In fact … I’ve never seen <em>any of you</em> or this place before today!  Just where am I?!”</p><p>                Harry ignored Bilbo completely.  “Lily …” Harry instantly pulling himself back, he could hear the sharpness in his voice.  “Sweetheart … just how did … Bilbo get here?”</p><p>                “That’s Mister Baggins to you, sir.”</p><p>                Harry sighed.  “Mister Baggins.”</p><p>                “I wished him here!”  Lily said, smiling proudly.</p><p>                “You did what?”  Ginny was so confused. </p><p>                “That’s not possible,” Harry said. </p><p>                “I did!”  Lily insisted.  “Honest!”</p><p>                “Are you some sort of Istari?”  Bilbo asked, earnestly.</p><p>                “What?!”  Ginny’s head was spinning.</p><p>                Lily just shrugged; she had no idea what that word was.</p><p>                “No!”  Harry said, hanging his head.  “She’s not.  She’s an under-aged witch, who isn’t—”</p><p>                “A witch?!”  Bilbo Baggins looked Lily over with incredulous, disbelieving eyes.  “I think you are delusional, sir.”  He gave Harry another pointed, pinched glare; he was not amused.</p><p>                “I’m delusional?!”</p><p>                “Clearly any man that calls his own daughter by such an ugly name …”</p><p>                “It’s normal,” Lily said, nodding.</p><p>                “You mean your father insults you on a regular basis?!”  Bilbo was horrified.</p><p>                “It’s true!”  Lily insisted.</p><p>                “It’s terrible!” Bilbo replied, shocked.</p><p>                “Harry,” Ginny urged.  “Do something!”</p><p>                “Okay, okay, okay!” Harry cried, silencing everyone and turning to his daughter.  “Lily, I want you to tell me, honestly, what you did?!”</p><p>                “I told you daddy, I wished him here!”</p><p>                “Honey—”</p><p>                “I’ll prove it!”  Lily stated with a stomp of her foot.</p><p>                Lily turned and grabbed the book she was looking at earlier, flipped open a page, and said words that Harry and Ginny did not understand.  Suddenly there was a flash of light and rush of wind, so strong, that it flung Ginny and Harry backwards and into the hallway.  It took a few long moments for them to recover, both sitting up with a shake of their heads.  But as they sat up, before they could utter a word, they were once again struck dumb.</p><p>                Standing in the doorway, his back to them, was another being, this one slightly taller than Bilbo Baggins, but wide and strong looking, his fur-trimmed coat and thick boots were dark blue in color and, like Bilbo, there was a sword, this one much longer, strapped to his side.  But before Ginny or Harry could ask who he was, the being turned a thick-beaded face and fierce, blazing blue eyes on them.</p><p>                In a deep, rumbling voice, the being barked, “I am Thorin Oakenshield, King of the Longbeards, and I demand to know what you have done and where you have brought me!”</p><p>                Harry had only one word at his disposal.  “Fuck.”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>
