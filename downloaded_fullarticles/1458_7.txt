    <b>October 31st, 1989</b>
  </p>
</center><p>The figure stands silently upon the edge of the towering building, at the altitude, wind nips at his flesh and ruffles his clothes from the cool Autumn breeze. Hazel eyes look out across the distance, watching the flickering lights of Pittsburgh in the darkened night, as the city awoke. A burning cigarette rests between his pointer and middle finger as a chain white mist of smoke floats in a wave like pattern, from the cold breezy air, and then disappears into the dark sky. A silent sigh escapes pink lips as eyelids flutter close and the head of the young eighteen-year-old faces the sky. He stares blankly up at the dim twinkling stars far above him. He silently wonders what it would be like, to escape from everything.</p><p>Brian Kinney noiselessly adjusts his weight on his feet and raises the burning cigarette to his lips. He takes another drag and slowly releases the smoke through his nose as he lowered his head and looks out across the busy city nightlife again. The hand holding his cigarette swayed with the wind at his side as he silently lost himself in thoughts of memories long since forced to be forgotten. "I thought I'd fine you up here." Michael Novotny steps through the metal doorway of the large buildings stairway. Many of Brian's friends and their families use it for holiday parties, this one just happens to be a Halloween party. Brian glances over his shoulder, quirking an eyebrow up and letting a small smirk grace his luscious lips.</p><p>"Aren't I always up here around this time?" He retorts dryly. Every year since he was thirteen he spends his days up on the roof of some type of building, staring out over the city of Pittsburgh. It was the day of his older sister's and her husband's murder and the day his godson and nephew was taken from him. Little Harry was not been placed in his other godfathers care, as he was the traitorous bastard that led to Lily's death. The bastard had also destroyed Harry's chance at a normal childhood. It also didn't help that Brian had been too young, only thirteen at the time, when his sister was murdered. Even now, at eighteen-years-old the old bastard and their stupid government still weren't letting him acquire guardianship of his nephew. He can feel his anger bubbling in his blood, just barely hidden beneath the surface at the thought of <em>them</em> again.</p><p>"You should just let it go for now Bri." Michael says as he walks across the building's rooftop. He stops beside his best friend on the ledge of the building. He has been in love with Brian for years. Not that he would ever tell Brian that. "I mean, enjoy your youth while you can," he continues, "Concentrate on college and getting a career that will let you have a big enough income to raise a child," he corrects himself with a sigh. "Until you can find a way to get guardianship of your nephew." Michael adds.</p><p>"For now, get your college degree and experience your chance at sleeping sound, going to parties, and learning what you need to attain guardianship," he says with a small sigh. He isn't oblivious to his friends bubbling anger at his words. While he does hate to see his best friend this upset and angry, he can't help but try and help Brian. He knows how much Brian yearns to be able to take care of his nephew and godson. He hates the people that have caused his best friend so much pain over the last five years. He has been there through it all and he always would be. So having seen Brian struggle and fight against a government that didn't want to listen or help him, makes Michael just as angry and upset as Brian is, because he's <em>seen</em> how much Brian has suffered because of it. </p><p>Trying for levity he remarks, "And of course you can fuck your way through most of the student body while you're at it." Michael smiles in amusement, his dark brown eyes twinkling with laughter as he teases his best friend. "It has been your goal, after all. As you have continuously reminded me," he teases. He is aware of the anger that simmers and bubbles beneath Brian's calm facade, as the other young man loses himself in the memories that have haunted him since discovering the news of Lily and James' murder and the betrayal that caused it. Michael had been informed about the Wizarding World, he is the only one out of their mismatched family that does know everything. He also knows about the odd things that Brian keeps experiencing, the strange abilities he's been dealing with. He also knows about Brian's affinity towards the more sexual and promiscuous relationships he's had. He has seen how others react to Brian when he walks into the room. As if there is an aura that surrounds him and ensnares other's attention. He's seen how Brian seems to gain strength and healing from the sexual energy. Brian and Michael are best friends after all, they don't keep secrets from each other for very long, if they can help it that is.</p><p>A dark look flashes over Brian's handsome visage at his best friends first statement. Did he really think that's what he should do? "No, Mikey. I can't just enjoy my college years while figuring out what I need to do to get Harry." Brian snaps in irritation. "I promised Lily I'd take care of her son if something happened to her and I'm breaking that promise, because I don't have him with me," he says firmly as his hazel eyes glance at his best friend. A look of amusement graces his face as his best friend tries to cheer him up. He can always count on Mikey. A husky chuckle releases at Michael's words of fucking his way through the school. His friend knows exactly how to bring him out of his head and make him laugh when he gets lost in his thoughts and memories. Mikey is one of the few people that can succeed in doing so. "I'll be the Stud of Liberty Ave. and I'll be the King of the school before long," he replies in amusement. Michael smiles in reply at the levity that had come over the tense atmosphere. He's glad he was able to pull Brian from his thoughts, if only for a little while.</p><p>Raising his hand Brian takes another drag from his cigarette before releasing the gray smoke from his lungs, causing a swirl of smoke to disappear with the wind. The soothing feeling of smoke and nicotine encasing his lungs is a relaxation he has acquired at thirteen-years-old. It had been an annoyance for Lily. She had unsuccessfully tried to break him of his "horrible habit" as she called it.</p><p>"There's not much you can do right now." Michael repeats again, calmly and logically. As much as he wants to help his best friend acquire guardianship of his nephew and godson, Brian has no income that will let him care for a toddler, let alone an apartment big enough for two people, let alone one. "You just need to be patient Brian," he says with a frown of concern as his best friend's mask begins to rise again, hiding away what he is truly feeling. His hand taps on his leg as he looks away from Brian's cold eyes. He will never get used to that expression being set upon him. It unnerves him to see his best friends eyes turn so cold in just a matter of a few seconds.</p><p>"If you say so." Brian remarks in a sardonic voice. He turns his gaze back up to starless night sky with a thoughtful countenance. "Don't you have better things to do Mikey?" His voice breaks the silence between the two friends. The noise of Pittsburgh nightlife is clear to the two young adults standing in silence. One of them is enjoying the cold Autumn air, while the other fights the urge to shiver at the cold biting wind.</p><p>"No, not when I'm worrying about you." The simple, but meaningful reply causes a grimace, unseen by Michael, to cross Brian's face. It always makes the slightly younger male uncomfortable when his friend's get all caring attitudes over him. He doesn't know if he will ever get comfortable with people caring for him. He knows his best friend is in love with him and that is another thing that has him so discomforted. He doesn't want to hurt Mikey by not being able to return those feelings. Mikey his best friend, even if he doesn't show it very well. "Everyone is worried about you," he adds when Brian doesn't respond. Their family has grown since the pair began college, adding in Emmett, Ted, Melanie and Lindsay to their formerly small group. While they show it in their own way, they do care about each other. They love each other as only good friends and chosen family can.</p><p>"No need. I'm fine," he immediately says. He is always <em>fine</em> and he is always going to be <em>fine</em>. Even if in truth he really isn't <em>fine</em>. Brian isn't the type to whine and bitch about his problems. If he wants someone to know about his 'issues' he'll tell them. Until that time his friends usually know not to bug him about what he is feeling. Well, almost all of them did. Michael knows when he needs to be a persistent little shit, asking and pestering Brian until he finally snaps and admits to how he feels. Michael knows that sometimes the only way to get Brian to talk about his feelings, is to push him to do it. "Mikey," he starts to say, cutting his friend off before he could speak again, "Why don't you go back inside and enjoy the celebrations. Rather then freezing your ass off and worrying over me." Brian adds with a smirk. "I'll come in when I'm ready."</p><p>Michael knows a dismissal when he hears one. With a final sigh, the other man nods his head and gives Brian's shoulder a squeeze, before pulling away and disappearing back into the stairway of the building.</p><p>Brian sighs in relief at the sound of the rooftops door slamming shut behind Michael. While he does care, as he <em>does</em> love his friend in his own way, he can't deal with having another person around. He just needs some peace and quiet away from his loud friends, his chosen family. "I'm sorry Lily. I tried. I really did. I'll keep going on like I have been, but I doubt I'll be able to get very far." Brian murmurs to himself. His cigarette is nearly depleted as he takes one last drag before tossing it over the edge of the building. Hazel green eyes watch silently while the bud of the cigarette flutters through the air before disappearing from sight.</p><p>It will be years before he ever sees his nephew and godson again.</p><p> </p>

  <em>June 2nd, 1984</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Dear Lily,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I hope this letter finds you and my nephew well. It's been a couple of weeks since I was able to find the time to write you. As you know how I'm not much into all of that sentimental bullshit you seem so fond of, so I'll just get to the point of this letter. As you requested, this is another update on how I've been doing these last few months since you left back for England with little Harry.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>When I started writing this letter I couldn't been but remember when we met for the first time. Do you remember? I was only five and you were sixteen. I remember when I first saw you, I thought how odd it was that you looked a lot like Serena, Emma and William, with your red hair and green eyes. Good genes from the Barnes side of the family I suppose. Grand-père Nigel always did remark that while Maimeó Bedelia may be a bitch, but she has good genes from the Irish side of our family.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Anyways, I couldn't but but think of the reaction our siblings and parents had to seeing you. You had traveled all the way to Pittsburgh from England to meet us. You never did get to meet Joan and Jack, not with their reaction to you. It still rubs be wrong to know that they never mentioned you to Claire of I. That they gave you away, but could keep the rest of us.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>You got the better end of the deal.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>My relationship with the parental's and siblings is still not how it used to be...not like it was any good in the first place with how they are, and I can I honestly say I'm fucking glad that they're not much of a part in my life anymore. Good fucking riddance.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I know, I know, "don't curse Bri, you're too young". Blah, blah, blah. I can curse whenever I fucking want to. We all don't have great role models like yours to follow after. I know what you're thinking Lils, you want me to make an effort to be on friendly terms with them, but I can't and I won't.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>You know, even after you discovered that you were put up for adoption, you still tried to give them another chance. Why? I never understood that. Why would you be willing to still give them a second and third chance? Especially after what they did to you. I don't get it. Sure, they're family but they gave you away like a toy they didn't want anymore but kept Jonathan, Ashton, Serena, Emma, William, Claire, and myself. How can you forgive them? How are you so forgiving? I mean, you never forgave your friend Snape, and yet you're willing to forgive the assholes that gave you up?</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I guess I'm glad and thankful that you're willing to be so forgiving. I got to meet you after all Lils. You're the only sibling I can actually stand and be willing to accept as my family. I could and can never regret disobeying Jack and Joan and what the punishment for doing so entailed, and no Lily, I won't tell you what happened.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Nonna Stephanie and Bunicut Bucky wanted me to tell you that they look forward to seeing you again when you get the chance to come and see them. They look forward to seeing their great-great grandson. They also told me to tell you to tell James that he better me treating you right, or he would be dealing with two angry and over protective grandparents.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I feel like I should inform you about something that I had come to realize a few days ago. I finally noticed what that look in her eyes. He's in love with me Lily...and...and I don't know what to do. How do you tell someone that you can never love them in that way? I can never love him as he wants me too Lils. I'd only break his heart telling him that. He's been my best friend since I was a kid. He's like a brother that I could actually depend on. Should I tell him the truth? Or should I just ignore it? I'm leaning towards ignoring it. If I don't acknowledge it, I can't hurt him...right? I feel like no matter what I do, I'll only break his heart. Is it wrong to be terrified that he'll leave me, abandon me like everyone else has in my life?</em>
</p><p>
  <em>You may hate hearing me saying this, but I'm glad you never got to live in this Hell that I've been forced to call my "home". You were lucky Lils, you grew up knowing you are loved by your adoptive parents. I can't say the same. It seems everyone in this house is allergic to the mere thought of showing love or compassion to one another. I'm glad you found the one you were meant for. If anyone deserves it, it's you. James is a great guy, kinda hot too. You picked a good one Lils. Don't let him go. You guys made one good looking kid. Harry is adorable and looks a lot like you and James. He has a bit of the Kinney genes in him, from what I saw of him last time the three of you visited. He seemed to take a liking to me too, but everyone does, who wouldn't?</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I hope you haven't gone crazy yet, with all of the pranks that have been going on. From what you told me in your last letter, you and Remus had a prank war against James and Sirius. I have to admit that James and his friends are pretty amusing with their pranks. Especially the last time it backfired on them. I always knew you were conniving and sly when you put your mind to it. It was well worth the chaos to see them scream like girls. I think Jamie and Siri had the highest pitch between them. I still have it on it fully on video too. I have all of our time spent together during these last few summers on video. I'll keep it for safekeeping until I can figure a way to use it against the pair from the last prank they did. Have any suggestions Lils?</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I look forward to your reply.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Later,</em>

  <em>July 21st, 1984</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Dear Lily,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I've been having this horrible feeling lately and I can't figure out what or why that is. I feel like something bad might happen to you. There's this foreboding sense of dread that keeps hanging over me, like a ticking time bomb waiting to explode as it slowly counts down. Whatever this feeling is, it isn't good. I hope you're keeping as safe as you can with that the war of yours that is transpiring. From what you told me, it's getting heated by the day. The idea of something happening to you makes me sick to my stomach. I can only hope that nothing does and you keep safe for the sake of your son and husband. If a God he should know how much you're needed here.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>You mean so much to me and I don't want to lose you, as difficult as that is to admit. You, James and little Harry are all I have. You're the optimist between us, the mere idea that something could happen to you...I don't like the thought. Especially since you and Jamie are the only ones that actually give a damn about me. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>I was told recently by the old crone that I was a shameful, worthless piece of shit and maybe I am one of these horrible things.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I suppose I am, with the way we have to live in this sort of world.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Anyways, I wrote to tell you about these nightmarish visions I've been having lately. I can't stand these dreams and the flashes I've seen. I see a fight between James and a cloaked man. James is yelling to you and he's telling you to run and take little Harry. The next flash you're running upstairs and into the nursery of your son's room. Protecting him, defending him, against a man that's rather handsome. The two of you are arguing, you're pleading to him to spare Harrison. The man says something to you that I can't quite catch before there's a flash of green light and you fall with a scream in front of Harry's crib. The next flash is the cloaked man standing over your still body and holding a wand to your son. He talks to baby Harry but I can't hear him over the ringing in my ears. The next thing I see is a green flash of light and it...rebounds back off of Harry and then there's a sudden scream of pain from the cloaked man.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I always awaken with sweat dripping down my face, my breathing rapid and tears falling from my eyes. I've had this dream for the last few months Lils and I'm worried. That horrible scream still rings in my ears hours afterwards and that dream haunts me the rest of the day. I've taken to new extremes to make myself forget this hellish nightmare. You wouldn't be happy with me if you ever found out what extremes I've taken.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>It's rather odd now that I think on it Lily. I've always had strange dreams like this nightmare, ever since I was a child. They're usually horrible and tragic, though I have had a few happy ones and I can never figure out why.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Do you remember when you asked me if I would ever find happiness? Can you remember what I said Lily? I can still. I remember telling you that I'll always find happiness with you every summer we see each other. I still recall the promise we made to each other and it still remains true. I will always be there for you Lily, no matter what it is. Whether it is to protect you or your family or raising little Harry should anything happen to you and James. I'll do anything I can.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Later,</em>
</p><p>
  <strong> <em>Brian</em> </strong>
</p><p>
  <em>August 31st, 1984</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Dear Lily,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I can still vividly remember when I was nine and you were fourteen, you asked me if I would ever find happiness. I told you I had, but never for what reason. It was always you that brought me happiness Lily. You were the only one that has not abandoned me, not purposely. You never left me to the ones I have to call 'parents' because you wanted to but because you had to. You are the big sister, the older sibling I should have had, one that should have been willing to watch over me, protect me from the people I'm forced to call my parents.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>We promised each other that day before you left to head home, that we would always watch out for each other and those we cared for and tat still remains true for me. I will do whatever I can to protect you and yours, no matter the cost. You're my big sister. You're the only one in my fucked up life that I actually give a damn about. You're the one person that's kept me going when things get too hard. You'll my best friend Lily and I couldn't have asked for a better one.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I want you to promise me something Lily Jana Potter, that you will watch yourself. The nightmare continues to persist and I can't stop this sinking feeling in my stomach that says horrible is going to happen. I have this feeling in my guts that tells me I should to take you, James and Harry and run. I should hide you and your family as far away from England as possible.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Promise me you'll be careful.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>You're all I have left.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I can't lose you. I don't know what will happen if I do.</em>
</p><p>

</p><p>
  <em>September 19th, 1984</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Dear Lily,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I did as you asked and tried for a 'relationship' from the last time we talked over the phone. I can't really say that it ended well. My only relationship at only thirteen and it will never happen again. Love is not worth the heartbreak. Who would have figured that I would know what 'heartbreak' is? Never again will I try and give it another shot. It's not worth the headaches.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>You know, I actually thought he would be worth the time and energy. Wasn't that a punch in the face when I discovered, at a dance, the guy I was with showed how much he actually cared for me? Which wasn't much, but I had always hoped he had been the one for me. That maybe he actually truly cared for me. I should have suspected something. I always had that nagging voice whisper in the back of my mind that he wasn't what I thought he was.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Fucking asshole. Figured he couldn't keep his dick in his pants.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I should have trusted my judgment and my friends. I wanted to give it a try for you Lily. Now don't go thinking I'm trying to make you feel guilty. I'm rather over the whole shit. It was a one time thing and rather mundane. Who knew relationships were boring?</em>
</p><p>
  <em>It was a whole fucking waste of time. After that I went through that whole, 'I hate the world and everyone else' stage. I may have felt a little bad for being such an asshole to you, but it happens. I think I made those six months the worst months of everyone else lives here. It made me highly amused and happy, even if it pissed off Jack more than anything. It was rather worth all the pain and suffering I went through.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>That relationship did show me one thing, trying to get love from someone is just as unreliable as my parents. I don't even know what love from s parent even is. The only true love I've ever known is a sibling love from you and a bond of friendship.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>In the conventional sense, the relationship type, is something I won't touch with a ten-foot pole again. Love is a hard thing to trust now a day's. Just like 'Sorry' is. Sorry is as overrated as 'Love' is, everyone says 'Oh, I'm so sorry' or 'Sorry, forgive me?'. Or they say 'I love you' or 'I love you too'. Fuck them and fuck love. Sorry is bullshit. Sorry's aren't worth anything, just like love isn't. Everyone says Sorry or I Love You. It's a word constantly used.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I've been in this angry mood lately. The nightmares are persistent as ever; even with my new extremes of ignoring these nightmares, they still find some way to get through.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Be safe Lily. This feeling has been getting worse.</em>
</p><p>

</p><p>
  <em>October 25th, 1984</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Dear Lily,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>You're probably wondering why I'm writing this to you a few days before Halloween. Well, I figured one last letter before I have to leave Pittsburgh for some 'family' thing the parents want to deal with and are dragging me with them. I just wanted to tell you and remind you how much I love you. You're my best friend, my big sister and at one time or another, you had wanted to kidnap me and take me back to England with you.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I sometimes wish you did. Here it seems someone always blames me for some bullshit or another that happens between Mikey and I. Whenever he gets hurt unintentionally or intentionally, I'm automatically blamed. Go figure. I got over if years ago, after the day my bitch of a grandmother died. Michael had gotten hurt a day after by falling out of a tree house his Uncle had built him.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I suppose I should tell you about the day my grandmother died, you've always asked, but I never told. I didn't feel the need, and still don't. As my final 'later', I figured you deserve to know the truth.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>It was around the time I was seven, my parents, older siblings and I had to go to the hospital. My grandmother was sick with a severe case of pneumonia and was dying. It was a sad and depressing time for everyone to deal with, except for me. She had been a mean old hag, that adored my older siblings except me. I know the whole "don't speak ill of the dead" thing but she had been a cruel and sadistic bitch that enjoyed dishing abuse on me.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Anyways, I knew something was wrong with her from everyone's reactions. I never really asked, as I honestly wasn't that curious, about what was wrong with my grandmother. I also didn't want to make them start crying or anything if I asked. Even then I wasn't very comfortable with expressing or dealing with other people's emotional turmoils.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I remember sitting silently on the hospital chair out in the hall, waiting until my grandmother finally joined my grandfather, wondering when it would end. Months before my grandfather died from lung cancer and it caused my grandmother's health to deteriorate. As much as my grandmother was a bitch, my grandfather was actually a sweet, kind old man that I enjoyed spending time with when we had family gatherings.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>After grandmother's death, the parental's became even crueler and greedier, after the inheritance money that they received from grandmother. I was told by grandfather, before he died, that he left all the money he had in his name to me. That no one in our family could touch the money he left me. I'm able to take control of the money left to me after my twenty first birthday.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Most of my siblings got rather jealous and angry when they found out this news. Sure they got some money from my grandmother but not as much as I'm assuming I did. Most of them moved out after high school to head to college and left me to deal with such loving parents. They're all fucking assholes anyways.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I just hope they never find out I'm gay. If they were pissed about the money I can just imagine how furious and disgusted they'll be with me being gay. Do you know what my old man Jack would do to me, or what that old bitch Joan would do? She already spouts off this bullshit about God and my burning in hell for being a good for nothing hooligan. Her tangents would only get worse.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The only reason we have a house is because they paid it off with their rich inheritance money my mother received from my grandmother and used the rest for bills when it comes time to. My father's inheritance money he received from his family is used to "encourage their unfavorable addictions", as your parents call it.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Your parents and you are the ones that have been there for me since we first met. You're the only ones that took the time to get to know me and give a damn and I want to thank you for that Lily. You've always made the time for me and I'm glad I got to know the sister I hadn't known I was missing until a couple of years ago.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I'll be sure to send you more letters when I can.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>With the worry you, James and Harry are causing me I'll go gray before I'm eighteen. I'm afraid one day I'll wake up and find out something happened to you.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Until next time, I'll be awaiting your letter reply.</em>

  </p>
</center><p>Eleven-year-old Harry Potter silently places the booklet, filled with his mothers letter from her younger brother, upon the uneven bed. He sits upon the cot he sleeps on in the bedroom of Ron Weasley, one of his best friends. A heavy exhale escapes his lips at this shocking news. He can feel anger at the thought of the Ministry and Albus Dumbledore keeping his Uncle from getting custody of him. If he had, Harry knows he would have been given a better life than what he has. From what he's read of these letters over the years, that his Uncle and Mother sent to each other, his Uncle had a far worst childhood then he himself had. His stomach turns as his hands trace the neat cursive writing his Uncle had. For a twelve-year-old, his hand writing had been beautiful. Then again, from what Harry has learned in these letters, his Uncle never really was a child, not like Harry was. <em>Which</em>, he admits to himself, <em>wasn't much better</em>.</p><p>"What are you doing Harry?" The sudden voice of Hermione Granger causes the young eleven-year-old to give a startled jump and quickly turn to the doorway where his other best friend stands. Harry can admit, but never aloud, that he and Hermione get along better than he and Ron do. Harry has always been interested in learning about this strange new world that he has been thrust into so suddenly a year ago.</p><p>"I was reading some letters from my mum and my Uncle." Harry says. He waits for the confusion to set in for his brilliant friend.</p><p>"Why would your mum be writing to your Uncle Vernon?" Maybe not then. Harry sighs to himself and looks to his friend with a shake of his head.</p><p>"My mum was adopted, Mione. Lily Evans was actually born as Lily Kinney until she was given up and put up for adoption. So technically that so called 'protection' with the Dursley's doesn't even exist. It also seems I have more than just one Uncle. My Uncle Brian, the one I mentioned that was talking to my mum, he kept mentioning older siblings that "Got out of the house while they could", as my Uncle says in one of his letters." The raven-haired preteen wipes his hands nervously on his torn jean pants. "I want to find him Mione. He promised my mum he'd take me in, no matter what. I want to know why he suddenly gave up." Seeing the determination in her friends bright green eyes Hermione knows she will find no way of talking him out of it.</p><p>"So, let's begin and see if we come up with anything." Hermione says. Grabbing her friend's hand they quickly run out of the room and downstairs. They'd ask Ron's brothers, Bill and Charlie, and see if they will be willing to help them go to Diagon Alley's Library.</p><p>They would soon realize that it would take them longer than just the summer to find Harry Potter's Uncle and get the paperwork filled out.</p><p>It would take them a whole year.</p><p> </p>

</center><p>"We'll be at the convention, Harry." Daniel "Dan" Granger reassures the twelve, soon to be thirteen, year old. His bright sky blue eyes are warm as he looks down at the smaller preteen. "If you need us, don't feel afraid to page me," he adds with a small friendly smile.</p><p>Harry's black hair is messy as usual, but his bright green eyes show the nerves he is feeling, since he is finally meeting his mother's biological brother for the first time. Well, the first time that he will be able to remember. "Right, thanks Mr. and Mrs. Granger." Harry replies with a shaky, but thankful, smile at his best friends parents.</p><p>"Of course Harry, you're our daughters best friend. We're happy to get you away from your mother's dreadful adoptive sister." Joanna "Joan" Granger says to Harry with a smile.</p><p>"Good luck Harry." Hermione adds as she steps up to her best friend and give him a quick hug. Harry hugs her back for a moment before stepping away. He has never been fond or comfortable with hugs, or even touch, from other's. It always left him feeling awkward and uncomfortable at the close proximity.</p><p>Dan Granger and Joan Granger gave Harry one last wish of good luck and reminder to call them at their hotel to let them know how it went and to page Dan if something goes wrong. Hermione gives her best friend one last smile and hug, before following after her parents.</p><p>Young Harry James Potter watches them disappear from his sight before turning to look up at the dark and towering apartment building in Pittsburgh. It is surprisingly dark,  considering it was mid afternoon. His stomach turns and twists at the notion that this is the first time he will be finally able to meet his Uncle and Godfather. His hands shake with nerves and his heart flutters with anticipation. With sweaty hands, Harry slowly steps up to the small box and presses the small red button for a moment while he waits for the voice of his Uncle to speak. "Yeah?" The voice is husky and hoarse, as if he had just woken up.</p><p>"Uh - um - my name is Harry Potter." Harry replies nervously as he presses the button on the intercom. "I'm your nephew and godson." Silence meets his statement, and for a moment, Harry fears his Uncle is going to ignore him.</p><p>Brian can't believe it. Harry, his nephew, Lily's only son, is outside. He doesn't know how this happened or why he is here, but the anticipation of seeing Harry is…god, he must be twelve-years-old. Jesus! Brian suddenly feels old; well, older than he already feels.</p><p>"Come on up, Harry." The reply makes Harry breathe out easier and the sound of the door buzzing makes Harry bounce on his feet with excitement. His Uncle's voice sounds softer than it had previously. There is something in his voice that makes Harry want to trust him, and he doesn't feel that very often.</p><p>His hands grip his satchel tightly as he pulls the metal-glassed door open and steps into the hallway. The flickering yellow lights of the hallway makes Harry's stomach tighten. He is <em>finally</em> meeting his Uncle. Biting his lip in nervousness, Harry slowly walks down the hallway towards the elevator. Pushing the arrow that shows upward, the twelve-year-old gnaws on the bottom of his lip as he tries to calm his twisting stomach. With a small 'ding' the doors to the elevator open and Harry silently steps inside.</p><p>Pressing the fourth level that has his Uncle's flat, he leans against the elevator wall and fights his impatience. The door gives another 'ding' and Harry steps out into the hallway. He passes a rather happy looking male, that has a rather goofy expression on his face. Harry feels his curiosity rise at the man's expression, but ignores it as he walks past the brown haired male, who looks to be in his early to late twenties. Harry quickly makes his way to the metal sliding door of his Uncle's flat and gives the bell a small ring. It feels like hours to Harry as he waits for the door to open, and when it does, he's rather surprised at the handsome male standing on the other side. His auburn hair is slightly damp, as if he has just gotten out of the shower. His hazel green eyes are warm and friendly, when they look at Harry. He's dressed in a pair of blue jeans and a form fitting black tank top.</p><p>"Harry Potter." Brian Kinney says. It isn't a question, as he still can't believe Harry is here. Years ago, he would have greeted him with open arms and a loving hug, or at least something, other than a name greeting. However, that isn't who he is any more, or who he's ever really been. He wants to be, for Harry, but he just can't.</p><p>"Uh, hi… Uncle Brian." Harry replies nervously.</p><p>"Hi, come on in Harry." Brian says with a small smile. <em>Uncle Brian</em>, Brian thinks to himself, <em>that will take some getting used to… or not</em>. He has no interest in titles and societal norms. "And its just Brian, no need with formalities, never been one to follow them anyway." Stepping aside he allows his nephew access into his apartment. He slides the metal door shut with a dull 'thunk' as he locks the door. He watches in slight amusement at the awed expression on his godson and nephew's face as he looks around his large loft.</p><p>"Wow." The twelve-year-old mutters with amazement.</p><p>"Nice isn't it?" Brian rhetorically questions.</p><p>Harry nodded anyways as he looks around the loft.</p><p>Brian's bare feet slap against the dark wood flooring as he walks further into the room.</p><p>Harry knows enough not to mention how much money people make, but his Uncle must be rich. It is very impressive. Harry knows how much gold he has in Gringott's, but that doesn't mean much in the Muggle world. He would have given it all away, any wealth that he has at his disposal, if it meant he didn't have to live the Dursleys.</p><p>Brian steps into the kitchen and grabs two bottles of water. Walking back into the large room, he plops down lazily on his leather couch. He sets the bottle of water down for Harry on the table, indicating with a wave of his hand that Harry should have a seat. Leaning back into the couch he looks at his nephew. "So, this is definitely a surprise. What are you doing here?" He inquires with curiosity clear in his tone.</p><p>"I came looking for you, after reading your letters that you sent to my Mum." Harry says softly. He walks silently over to the couch and takes a hesitant seat.</p><p>"And you decided to look for me after that? How come?" Brian's hazel green eyes glint with curiosity as he watches his nephew's expressive eyes. He's very interested in hearing the boys answer.</p><p>"I wanted to find you, needed to find you. I… well, when I'm with my friend's family, I feel… what I mean is…" Harry can't quite voice what he wants to say.</p><p>"You feel like that's what you want, but you're an intruder, that you don't belong, but you want to feel like you belong." Brian helpfully says; he knows that feeling, all too well.</p><p>Harry can't believe it, that's exactly what he feels. He nods quickly. "Yeah, that's… that's what I feel. The way you wrote, those letters to my… mum" he kind of chokes out, it is difficult to talk about his parents, "I was hoping you could take me in, like you were suppose to after my parents died." Harry replies. He plays with the strings on the worn end of his t-shirt as he looks down at his lap.</p><p>This kid had guts, coming all the way from England to look for an Uncle, in the hopes that he will be accepted. Talk about a risk, a risk that Brian doesn't think he could do if their situations were reversed. "You know, I did try to take you in after your parents were murdered. Even after that, until I was about twenty-years-old." Brian muses aloud.</p><p>Harry's head snaps up at his Uncle's words. "What?" He gasps out in surprise.</p><p>"Yep." Brian says, popping the 'p' in the word. "I tried to take you in but that old bastard and his lap dogs in the Ministry wouldn't let me. I tried for years, but they kept saying I was unfit, I wasn't magical enough, I wasn't old enough or I didn't have the things to take care of you," he scoffs at their remembered bullshit excuses, "Yeah, right. That old bastard just kept saying something about protection, but I'm your flesh and blood. Not that stupid bitch Dursley."</p><p>Brian may not have been a full-blooded magical being like his older sister was, but he did have some kind of abilities. After all, his "dreams" couldn't have just been his imagination, especially with how his sister was murdered months after he had them. He also can't forget about his sexual prowess and skill, which had to be defined magically, somehow. He also can't forget how sexual energy seems to help him. He isn't a wizard or witch like Harry or Lily, and he certainly isn't a squib; but he has to be something to be able to do some of the things he did. Brian isn't about to say he's some "psychic". He didn't believe in that bullshit, but his strange dreams over the years, his ever growing abilities, his sexual prowess and skills, and the sexual energy, it all had to have come from somewhere.</p><p>Harry can't honestly say anything as he looks at his Uncle. For years his Uncle had tried to take custody of him, but the Ministry, and Dumbledore of all people, wouldn't let him? "Tha - why?" Harry asks with hurt and sadness at this news.</p><p>"I have a few theories, but nothing you need to worry about. At least not since you're here anyway. And you certainly don't need any more worries after the bullshit you've had to deal with already." Brian adds with a mysterious little smile. </p><p>Harry's eyebrows furrow at his uncle's words. <em>What did he mean by that?</em> He wonders with curiosity clear in his eyes. "I - I have some papers. They'd allow you custody of me if you signed them." Harry murmurs out shyly. He hasn't a clue how to reply to what his Uncle has just said. His pale cheeks flush at the look on his Uncle face.</p><p>"Let me see them and I'll get my lawyer...friend to look them over." Brian remarks as he leans forward and holds out a hand. Harry quickly opens his satchel and pulls out the documents. He hands them to his Uncle and waits as he reads them over before pulling out his cellphone and dialing a number.</p><p>"Hey Lindsay, look, I need a favor from <em>her</em>." Brian says into the phone. "Yeah, yeah, I know," he says with a roll his eyes. "Anyways, I need her expertise on some law shit. My nephew appeared -" A sigh escapes from his lips. "Yes, Lindsay, I know. Look - just get her to come to the office tomorrow or to my loft after she gets off." Brian sighs as the other person continues to talk. "Yes, at my loft is fine. Or even in the morning tomorrow at the office. Yeah, Later." Brian hangs up the phone and shakes his head with exasperation.</p><p>"Some fucking people," he mutters under his breath. Shaking his head he looks over at Harry. "So, with any luck, we'll get this paperwork straightened out tomorrow. But in the meantime, how are you doing? You hungry, tired?" Brian questions.</p><p><em>That was fast</em>, Harry thinks. He had come all the way to America to find his Uncle in hopes that he will find a family that cares. And just like that he is going to have a place to live, with his real Uncle, someone that loved his mother and knew his mother. Before he can respond, Harry's face flushes, as his stomach grumbles to life.</p><p>Brian chuckles. "Right. Well, I guess that answers my question. Let me get my shoes on and then I'll take you wherever you want to go." Brian says as he pushed himself up from the couch. He walked across the room and up the three steps that led into his bedroom. He swiftly put his socks and shoes on. He then grabs his leather jacket from where it hangs off the back of a chair. It's something that he always wears when he dresses. He double-checks the buttons and zipper of his pants are done up and that his silk black shirt is buttoned up enough to be comfortable.</p><p>Brian comes down to see Harry still sitting on the couch in his obviously second hand, ratty clothing. "You know, I'm going to have to give you a serious make over. I wouldn't be caught dead wearing the clothes you have on," he remarks with a critical eye. "Unless of course, you'd rather stay wearing something a dog wouldn't sleep on."</p><p>Harry can't believe the insults his Uncle is giving him, well his clothes, not him. They aren't his choice, there is no way he could buy himself anything.</p><p>The forlorn look on his godsons face makes Brian pause. Brian relaxes his face to look kind and not judgmental. "No kid should be seen in shit like that, Harry. I know what it's like, when you don't have a choice, taken what's given without any fucking say in the matter…" he says with a distant expression before it quickly disappears. "Oh yeah, been there, done that." Brian adds in an uncaring manner.</p><p>Harry can almost hear a little sadness and anger in his voice though. "You - you have?" Harry asks with curiosity. He knows he's read the letters, and his uncle mentioned or implied stuff, but it's different when someone says it in such a way.</p><p>"Mhm." Brian makes the small noise in the back of his throat as he opens his loft door. Harry walks up to the door just as Brian is about to step out. He can see the questions in Harry's eyes and decides to nip that in the bud right now. "I might tell you someday, just… no questions right now, okay?"</p><p>Harry pauses for a moment, thinking about that. He wants to know, but it kind of makes sense. If someone was to ask him about living with the Dursleys he would have no interest in explaining anything. Harry looks up to his Uncle Brian with a smile and nod. "Yeah, no questions… Does that mean I don't have to answer the same questions?"</p><p>Brian chuckles at the retort. He's a smart kid. "I might expect a few answers that you might not want to answer, but I won't ever force you share anything you're not willing to share, okay? You should never have to do anything, or say anything, you don't want, ever." Brian says this with such passion and conviction that Harry believes him, and somehow, even though they just met, he trusts him.</p><p>Brian puts his arm around Harry's shoulders in a kind of hug that didn't necessarily have to be seen as a hug. Brian is never much for hugs, but Harry looks like he could use a little support. If Brian is being honest with himself, and he always tries to be, he doesn't mind a little hug or comfort. After all these years, he has wanted to take care of Harry, and now he is finally here, Harry found a way to him on his own.</p><p>"So Harry…ever have Chinese food?" He asks his nephew with a raised eyebrow.</p><p>"No." Harry replies with a frown.</p><p>"Pizza?" Brian tries again. All he gets in reply is a shake of his head. "You're definitely missing out. I really do need you to get up to speed. I usually get a salad from the Pizza Palace, but I'm willing to kill myself by getting a bite of pizza for you." He teases with a small smile as the two walk down the hallway and towards the elevator.</p>
