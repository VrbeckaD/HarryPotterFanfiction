by antebunny</p><p> </p><p>Sirius didn’t know how long it took him to get up. It could’ve been hours after he’d woken up, which could’ve been hours since he’d been tossed down here. It could even be a few minutes. Being locked in the cellar was nothing unusual. It happened once or twice to him every summer since he started Hogwarts but no more than four times. His parents usually let him out after a few hours. A couple times it had been all day, but given that <em> it </em> had been dinnertime, he’d probably spent the night here already. When Sirius woke up, he’d stayed face-up on the stone floor, just breathing and shaking off the ache of the several curses. <em> Merlin. </em>He couldn’t believe his parents had actually–</p><p>The hairs on the back of his neck prickled just thinking about it. He couldn’t believe what his parents were willing to do to make him fit their image of a proper son. But he wasn’t Regulus. He could never do it, no matter how hard he tried. He’d like to stay he stopped trying long ago (but that wasn’t quite true). </p><p>Well, all things considered, his family had done worse. Marius Black had been almost literally thrown out of his home at eleven years old for being a Squib. Sirius had never thought about what happened to him before. A child with no knowledge of the Muggle world, left in the middle of the street. Cygnus and Violetta Black seemed a lot crueler to Marius than Sirius’s parents to Sirius last night. </p><p>Sirius’s ears strained to hear a noise from outside the cellar door. His eyes stayed closed. He lay on his side, sticking his hands in his dress robes to keep them warm. He’d been down here so many times he knew exactly where he was; the very center of the room, where the ancient runes had been carved into the stones. There were steps behind him, leading up to the door that was magically locked with at least seven curses. It was the magic number, after all. But knowing his parents, it probably had thirteen curses, all with inventive ways to incapacitate someone. He’d only tried to open the door once. </p><p>Quiet. His own labored breathing. </p><p>That was all he could hear, and Sirius, for once, hoped that nobody came. He wasn’t ready to stand up, much less face his parents. He was starving, and his left wrist still ached every time he moved it, like his bones didn’t like the way he pulled his skin over them. He was freezing in his dress robes, his head still hurt, and he was so tired. Not sleepy-tired. He just…</p><p>Sirius squeezed his eyes shut and tried his hardest not to cry again. His eyes were probably already red. They didn’t need to be any redder. This was the worst shape he’d ever been in when he ended up in the cellar. He just wanted to sleep and wait for his parents to let him out. </p><p>He wished they would just disown him. He could probably go live with James. But James was in India for the summer and wouldn’t return for another nine days (yes, he’d been counting), Remus hated him, and Peter…well, without his owl, he didn’t have a way of communicating with Peter. </p><p>Mistakes. Whenever Sirius (or Regulus, but mainly just Sirius) did something wrong, Father would make him say his mistakes out loud. Sirius still wasn’t entirely sure why, but at the very least it was excruciatingly humiliating. He hadn’t done it for two years or so–he usually stomped (fled) up to his room until Walburga’s rage had cooled. Even so, Sirius had a decade’s worth of recounting his mistakes, and so now, wallowing in his hair loss, trying not to think of past events, he couldn’t help but wonder; what had gone so horribly wrong?</p><p>He’d refused his parents point-blank. They hated being defied. Especially in front of Regulus, who they still had control over. Sirius had done both. That was his first mistake. He should’ve explained why he shouldn’t join their death cult. For example, <em> Voldemort would never want him. </em> His parents seemed to think that the Death Eaters were the latest trend, and they wanted Sirius to jump on the bandwagon so the Black House could be in before it was too late. He was a wizard with the right idea, finally ridding the wizarding house of all the Undesirables; Muggleborns, halfbloods, blood traitors, halfbreeds, Muggles, etc. That was, of course, the first reason why Sirius would never join him, alongside the fact that he was the suspected culprit for several murders. (But they were Muggles, so who cares, right)? It seemed to Sirius that Voldemort wanted to control the House of Black; after all, he mainly used Lucius to fund all his escapades. Sirius wouldn’t be surprised if Abraxas Malfoy died from a sudden dragon pox soon. But Walburga and Orion didn’t think Voldemort posed any sort of threat to <em> them. </em>And Sirius’ grandfather, Arcturus, current Head of House Black, seemed content to shut himself up in the Black Family Manor and let his son and daughter-in-law (and first cousin once removed, ew) run the family business. </p><p>Sirius had egged his mother on. He knew how volatile her temper was, and he knew how she was like when she was mad, but the words came spilling out, as always. He never seemed to be able to stop talking. Of course, he didn’t know how serious they were, because the whole scenario was completely ridiculous to him. Yes, his mother was slapping his across the face but she did that usually once a month. No, he didn’t want to get hurt, but somewhere in the back of his mind he just couldn’t believe that his parents were <em> serious. </em> Then it had escalated, but by the time he realized that his parents were <em> desperate, </em>it’d been too late. Blacks never took well to insults. </p><p>Okay, so he’d had no idea how serious his parents were. Or how close they were to exploding after once more ‘defiance’ from him. Either way, it didn’t matter. He had no idea they would react the way they did. Evidently they hoped (or knew, and wasn’t that terrifying) that if Sirius got the Mark he would be easier to control. He did have to go to Hogwarts, after all. The worst part was that they were right: Sirius would never be able to face his friends with the brand of a murderer on his arm. Not after little Kingsley Shacklebolt’s father and uncle were murdered (so much for blood purity) in their own homes. Not after the sixth year Muggleborn Rowena Wormwood was found naked, alone and terrified by the edge of the Forbidden Forest <em> for a bit of fun. </em> Not after Francine and Bailey Alexander, two powerful Muggleborn siblings, ended up screaming for <em> reaching above their station. </em> Sirius knew that if he had been Marked and then waited until James returned from India to run away, James’s first question would be, <em> why didn’t you leave before? </em> And he would have no answer. <em> Well, congratulations, you’re not Marked, </em>Sirius thought to himself bitterly. </p><p>So that conversation could have gone better. They sprung getting Marked on him and he reacted as if he didn’t believe them, because he didn’t. They hadn’t even gotten to the second course before they sent Regulus out of the room and–</p><p>Well, as soon as they sent Reggie away Sirius knew exactly what was coming. The only shocking part were the <em> reasons </em>they flung at him. That was the only part Sirius wanted to forget ever happened. </p><p>Sure, his father only remembered Bertram Aubrey’s name so that he could use it against Sirius, but Bertram Aubrey wasn’t supposed to have ended up in the Hospital Wing. If Sirius hadn’t picked a fight with him, he wouldn’t have been there in the first place. <em> He picked a fight with me first </em> , Sirius thought mulishly. <em> He should’ve known better. </em>After all, Blacks never took well to insults. </p><p>Sirius curled his hands into fists in an attempt to keep them warm. He knew he was shivering, but he couldn’t find the will to move. He squeezed his eyes tight and red spots under his eyelids. They didn’t obscure the wet feeling of tears slipping down his face. While he wasn’t surprised that his parents were delighted by the idea of him being a murderer, he couldn’t believe that <em> they thought he was basically a murderer. </em>He wasn’t sure if his fists were shaking from cold, anger, fear, or all three. He thought about what they’d said, and decided it was fear. </p><p>“I’m not a bully,” Sirius whispered into the darkness. The stones seemed unimpressed. It wasn’t like he and his friends had “chosen” Snape because he was a halfblood. Remus and Peter were halfbloods. And sure, he’d been aware Bertram Aubrey was a Muggleborn before the incident, but that hadn’t meant anything. It didn’t have anything to do with what happened. (Although he hadn’t even known that <em> mudblood </em>was an insult until James had looked at him, horrified, as if he’d never seen him before—)</p><p>Sirius sat up. Merlin, he was so hungry. He’d already been starving when he came down for dinner. Had it been a day? A few hours? A few minutes?</p><p>The loss of his hair was a physical blow. It was the only thing he inherited from his family that he took pride in. Now he was left with frayed locks curling by his cheek bones and split hairs forming a bald spot on the top of his head. He felt off balance. </p><p>Despite all this, Sirius’s immediate thought was not to run away. He’d considered it before, but his parents never really had a problem with him spending most of his summer at the Potters. His first thought was just to wait. Father would come and let him out eventually, he and Mother would take turns lecturing/yelling at him, he would looked appropriately contrite, and then life would get back to normal. Within a week, there would be no objections to him going to the Potters for the rest of the summer. The only visible sign of last night’s dinner would be the lack of hair, and that was easily fixable, given that James’ parents owned Sleekeazy’s Hair Potions. Everything would be fine. Nobody would ever know, and he wouldn’t have to see his parents for another year. It all sounded so wonderfully easy. </p><p>Except. Last night hadn’t been like other times. Not even in terms of what they said, but rather what they <em> did. </em>It seemed to Sirius that every month his parents would lose it and send Regulus out of the room, so this time he thought he knew what was coming; he thought he knew how to deal with it. </p><p>He’d been wrong. </p><p>His ribs began to shake, and Sirius realized that he was sobbing. <em> Pathetic, </em> his mother’s voice hissed at him from the dust-coated stones. <em> Blacks do not snivel. </em> Blacks do not take well to insults, Blacks do not compromise, Blacks do not lose, Blacks do not get Sorted into Gryffindor, Blacks do not disrespect their House, Blacks do not put anyone but Blacks first, Blacks do not dally with those of impure blood, <em> Merlin </em>Sirius was so sick of it. </p><p>His parents weren’t giving this up. The House of Black did not compromise. The House of Black did not lose, even to itself. His mother would rather burn him off the tree than let him <em> not </em> get Marked. He really should have seen this coming. He’d been taking more and more liberties every summer, and he thought his parents had been <em> letting </em>him. He purposefully broke his silver door knob after his second year, on the off chance that Remus came over for some ungodly reason. His mother kept on having refitted with another silver door knob while he was at Hogwarts, but eventually she gave up. Sirius was currently using two copper wires twisted together as a key, keeping it in his pocket every time he left his room.  </p><p>The cuts around his head had faded remarkably fast, even for a wizard. The one on his ear had disappeared already, and he knew his mother was no lightweight when it came to curses. Sirius slowed his breathing and sat up, instinctively reaching to brush his hair behind his shoulders, only to hit empty air. He rubbed his frozen fingers over his eyes. <em> No more sniveling, </em>he told himself firmly. </p><p>Sirius’ thoughts turned over and over in an endless cycle of self-doubt, rage, and pity. He thought of his parents, his brother radiating the sickly stench of Dark magic, minestrone soup, the Dark Mark, and facing his friends. Merlin, if he’d had to see them, or anyone at Hogwarts, with the Dark Mark on his arm, he didn’t think he could live with himself. All in all, he knew one thing:</p><p>He had to leave. </p><p>Sirius had never cared about the privilege that came with being Heir. Maybe that was selfish of him, to instantly have what so many Muggleborns struggled for and not care. But he would give it all up, even Regulus, for the chance to have James’ parents. There were more pitfalls to being a Black than anybody realized. Except for James and his parents, who had…seen a couple when he escaped his family over Christmas or Easter holidays. But there was a downside to being from House Black that he’d never let James see: he knew there were still Gryffindors who thought that he was going to “betray” them. That even though the Sorting Hat had put him in Gryffindor, he was still a Black at heart. He saw it in the way first years scuttled away from him and not James, their whispers and cautious glances whenever he laughed too loudly. <em> He enjoys it, </em> they said. <em> Causing fear and pain and humiliation, just like a Black! </em>Which was ridiculous, because James did too, but no, he was a Potter, the family famous for hair products and potions. (Rather ironic, considering James’ total lack of skill when it came to potions). </p><p>The so-called “Light” side would never fully trust him, but he would never ever join the so-called “Dark” side. He would never be able to give up James, the Marauders, early morning Quidditch practice, or tallying Evans-Evading-Prongs with Remus and Peter, even now that Remus wouldn’t talk to him. </p><p>Sirius wouldn’t join the Death Eaters, and his parents wouldn’t stop trying to make him. So they were going to kick him off the family tree eventually, or they would just leave him here in the cellar until he became the crazy uncle in the basement that nobody talks about, or dead. Sirius didn’t like any of those options. </p><p>So he had to leave. The sooner the better, because at some point Sirius would collapse. </p><p> </p><p align="center">-OoOoO-</p><p> </p><p>The thing about the Black Manor wards is that they were made to keep non-Blacks out and Blacks in. Blacks weren’t particularly unused to traitors. Kick somebody off the family tree, and they’d still have an easy time breaking in. You could say all you want that you weren’t related to them, but the truth of the matter was that your blood ran in their veins, so the wards would still count them as Blacks. See, the Black Manor wards weren’t meant to keep traitors <em> out </em> . They were made to lock traitors <em> in </em>. </p><p>Sirius stared again at the cellar door again. After the last time he’d promised himself never to touch it again, but it was the only way out of the cellar. He rubbed the back of his neck with his frozen fingers. </p><p>The thing about the Blacks was that they assumed they knew all the secrets. Sure, they played the “political game”, hunted for gossip, etc., but when it came to the Blacks? Who knew the Blacks better than the Blacks? Only they knew what was in their extensive Dark Arts library. Only they knew what secret spells and enchantments lay within the Black Family grimoire. And blimey, did they love their secrets. Most Blacks had one big secret, but it could never be kept secret forever. Look at his cousin Andromeda Black: fell in love with a Muggleborn Hufflepuff (and conned her parents out of a bigger sum of money than they would care to admit), and now she was disowned by her family. </p><p>Except Sirius had multiple secrets, and nobody in his family knew. That was the thing about traitors. Nobody knew their secret until they did, and then it was gone, <em> finito, </em>no more secrets, no more traitor. And with Sirius so obviously Gryffindor and so obviously a traitor, well, what did he have to hide?</p><p>Secret No. 1: one of his friends is a werewolf. Of course, Snape knew, and Sirius had almost gotten said friend killed in big trouble, but the point remained. The loudest year of Gryffindors, and nobody knew one of them was a werewolf. Not his parents, not his brother. </p><p>However, Sirius also happened to be a Black. The same Blacks who had the most extensive library on the Dark Arts in all of Great Britain, possibly the world. One of the oldest wizarding families, period. Certainly the oldest British wizarding family, even though others were more powerful now. (Not that the Blacks would ever admit to it). </p><p>In his third year, when they had been allowed to choose electives, Sirius had chosen Muggle Studies and Care of Magical Creatures. He had James and Peter in Muggle Studies (as a half bloods who knew about the Muggle world, Remus had taken Arithmancy). But none of the other Marauders were in Care of Magical Creatures; they’d all chosen to take Ancient Runes. Sirius would have taken Ancient Runes too, but he just couldn’t stand it. </p><p>See, Sirius was a Black. He’d learned all of the course material they would ever learn before he’d finished his second year, and things they wouldn’t. Blood runes were only briefly touched on in Ancient Runes, more concept rather than practice. Although not a Dark Art, they came dangerously close, for few people were willing to use their own blood, which was what they required above all: a blood sacrifice.  </p><p>Stiffly, Sirius fumbled around for copper wire in his pocket that served as his doorknob. He untwisted the ends and dragged the tip of the wire across the cuts on his arm. After twenty seconds of pain and no results, he gave up and started attacking his lip viciously, still crusted with dried blood. It didn’t hurt any less, but at least it distracted him from the throbbing of his right arm that surged when he twitched it. </p><p>Everyone knows that scars are the easiest place on the body to get wounded, especially if they’re new. Few people ever take advantage of this fact. Even fewer ever need to. </p><p>Drawing the rune wasn’t terribly difficult. As long as he refused to think of how Dark it was, or what his friends would think if they knew, or where he’d found it. (He wasn’t like Regulus, he wasn’t like his family, but oh Merlin was he going to stink of Dark magic after this–?) Even though it was his blood, which dried the instant he smeared it on the stone floor. Even though he was tired and shaking and exhausted. Circles and straight lines were harder to get right under these circumstances, but he had to.</p><p>After all, Sirius was a Black. No, he hadn’t gone looking for advanced blood runes in case he needed magic, as a student legally not allowed to practice magic outside of school. Only paranoid freaks would do school outside of school. Really, Sirius had only seen it and remembered it. That was all. (Never mind that it was borderline Dark magic and <em> what would Prongs say </em> or the certainty that his parents would be <em> ecstatic </em>–)</p><p>When he was finished, Sirius took off the sash from his robe (it was like a belt, but fancier) and held it over his lips firmly. He waited for a few despairing seconds when the rune did nothing. Had the two breaking concentric circles not been good enough? They were by no means perfect, but surely, <em> surely </em>they were passable. The great thing about runes was that they were so much easier to break than to make if you had access to them. Blood wards could only be broken by a member of the family or someone as powerful as Dumbledore. Sirius waited for what felt like an eternity, all his hopes pinned on that rune. If it failed, he’d have to start over, and he wasn’t a big fan of blood loss. </p><p>The blood rune blazed with a sickly red light and Sirius felt like swooning in relief. He sprang unsteadily to his feet and yanked the door open without a moment’s pause; all thirteen curses had been lifted. The corridor behind it was dimly lit by the red glow of his rune. <em> Freedom. </em>The butterflies that had been having seizures in his stomach settled down, and he resisted the urge to whoop with glee. Sirius grinned maniacally, not wanting to make noise. His rune should have disrupted all the enchantments in the room he was in</p><p>Secret No. 2: Sirius Black was an Animagus. He’d become one earlier that same year because of his werewolf friend. </p><p>A large black dog poked his nose into the hallway and cautiously crossed the threshold. A second later, Sirius stood in the hallway, a black shadow invisible in the pitch black corridor. He rested one hand on the wall to get his balance. </p><p>Behind him, the blood red rune light died down, and the dimly lit corridor ahead of him disappeared into blackness. </p><p> </p><p align="center">-oOoOo-</p><p> </p><p>Sirius had made his way out of the cellar several times before. Mother used to come down and demand an apology, but more recently, his father would simply open the door and leave, letting Sirius make his way out by himself. Which he preferred, honestly, even if his mother was usually waiting for him to get one last yelling in. He’d never snuck out before with the intent of keeping quiet so as to not wake Kreacher. He’d never snuck out with the intention of never coming back. </p><p>The hallways of the basement all had carpeted stone floors. There were no floorboards to creak by stepping in the wrong crack. He didn’t dare go upstairs to where the sleeping quarters were, in order to collect a few things–like his wand, if his parents hadn’t snapped it already. So Sirius made his way through the long, twisted hallways, avoiding enchanted armour sets that liked to attack you and paintings that shrieked if you woke up the inhabitants by breathing too loudly. The doors on either side led to storage rooms filled with Dark artefacts that were really best left alone. He transformed back into Padfoot. It was much easier to navigate in the dark with dog senses. It would be impossible for anyone who didn’t live there. But this was his house. He knew it, even if he wanted to forget it. </p><p>He found the staircase. It seemed a lot bigger as a dog. He couldn’t even see the portrait of Pollux Black, but he knew it was there somewhere. He paused for a moment. His mother spent most of her time on the first floor, in one of the various parlors or sitting rooms. Going up the stairs would be going right into her lair; his father was usually tucked away in his study, out of sight. Maybe they were waiting for him. Maybe he was blithely about to reveal himself as an unregistered Animagus to his parents. <em> Merlin, now you sound like a Black, </em> Sirius thought to himself bitterly. <em> Nobody is expecting you to get out of the cellar, stop being so paranoid.  </em></p><p>He quickly made his way up the stairs, not allowing himself time to rethink his decision. At the top of the stairs, the first floor of No. 12 Grimmauld Place stretched out before him with the atmosphere of a tomb.  </p><p>Sirius briefly considered using the Floo fireplace. His parents always had a bowl with Floo powder on top of the mantle, which Kreacher kept stocked. Of course the green flames would roar loudly and he would shout “Potter residence” loudly, but by the time they realized what had happened he would be gone and ready to camp out at James’ house (or break in through a window) until James came back from India. He wouldn’t look as pathetic by then, either.  </p><p>He passed the living room. The fireplace sat cold and silent in the back of the room. Sirius eyed the gate made of metal snakes that would hiss and bite at intruders. Would he count as an intruder? His parents usually sent them on their way with a flick of a wand, but he had neither the skill nor the wand. Speaking of skill, could his parents track the last location the Floo fireplace was used for? And he’d need enough food and water to last nine days, if he couldn’t access any of theirs. And maybe clothes. And a shower. And probably a lot of things he hadn’t thought of yet. </p><p>Even if his parents couldn’t track his location, they’d be able to guess pretty easily. After all, James was his best friend and from an old pureblood family. Their Floo fireplace didn’t go inside the house, after all. It went to a little one-room shed thing just outside the boundary of the Potter grounds and wards. It seemed smarter than having it in the living room, but any unauthorized (non-pureblood) who tried to enter the Black manor would die a horrible death. </p><p>His family would be able to find him anywhere in the magical world, really. They had connections and resources and honestly, they knew the magical world far better than he did. They’d find him within a day. And the gate on the fireplace was charmed, supposedly to keep babies away. (His parents’ take on baby-proofing. And they wondered why he didn’t like snakes). </p><p>He cast one last sorrowful look at the bowl of Floo powder. It seemed so easy, but anywhere in the Magical world was too close to his family. (Excluding the Potter’s manor, which he supposed was still part of the Magical world, because it was warded strongly enough to keep out Blacks). Sirius left the living room behind. Walking as a dog was overall quieter than as a human. His claws clicked softly, but his hearing let him know that nobody was awakened by it.  </p><p>He passed the portrait of Irma Black, Walburga’s mother, a former Crabbe who hadn’t even been out of Hogwarts when she gave birth to her first child. Still, it made sense in a twisted way, because Walburga’s father had been thirteen. It was no wonder why Walburga had eventually married her second cousin. Her parents were blood crazy. But still, all three of them had nothing on Irma’s youngest, Cygnus Black (the second). He’d already been so far under the ‘Black Family Madness’ that when he married Druella Rosier, a notoriously cruel and Dark family (they’d invented the Conjunctive Curse, for Merlin’s sake), she’d only lasted a few years before taking her youngest two (Andromeda and Narcissa) off to France with her. </p><p>Andromeda, on the other hand, was still in hiding after marrying Muggleborn Ted Tonks three years ago, although to be fair she’d conned her dowry our of her parents anyway, like a true Slytherin. She still wrote to Sirius, and he’d met her two-year-old daughter towards the end of the last school year. She was a Metamorphmagus, which rather explained why the Blacks were so sore. The Metamorph ability and sister curse Maledictus used to be a trait of the Blacks, one that they, naturally, took pride in. It had disappeared a while back, and they refused to consider that it had anything to do with inbreeding. Now here was Andy, married to a Muggleborn, with her Metamorph daughter. The Blacks were understandably in denial. </p><p>In any case, his family was far too mad for his liking. The portraits were supposedly put up out of respect, to honor the members of the House of Black, but Sirius was fairly certain that his parents only had them to spy on Sirius and Regulus. Irma Black certainly ruined the trend of black, curly-haired Blacks (black haired Blacks? How could his mother resist?) as she had brown, straight hair that none of her children had inherited. His hair was the only familial inheritance that he appreciated and now it was gone. </p><p>Sirius creeped like an apparition past the drawing room. His grandmother’s portrait slept on. His cheek throbbed and his ribs ached from his multiple falls and his arms stung every time Sirius stretched them and felt the pull of a dozen crisscrossing cuts. Hell, even his right ear itched from a miscast <em> diffindo. </em>His left arm hung limply by his side; he was unwilling to move it even though he could only see a few inches in front of his face. </p><p>After what seemed like an eternity, Sirius made his way back to the dining room. Kreacher had clearly cleaned up after him, because no trace of the fight remained. The table and chairs sat up straight, serpents carved around the backs. The chandelier that hung over the table had a glowing charm, rather than candles. It cast a soft white light around the room. Sirius transformed back into a human temporarily to appreciate the light. Kreacher had cleared the entire table off, leaving nothing but polished oak wood. He stilled in the middle of the room. The hallway to his right led to the second floor, where he had left his wand before dinner. But it led to everybody else’s rooms, too. He hadn’t passed any window on his way out, so for all he knew his parents set up the house so that it <em> looked </em>like night, but were in reality in wait for him. But that didn’t make any sense. Why would they go through all that trouble, when they didn’t think he could get out of the cellar? That was his Black paranoia talking again. </p><p>Sirius hesitated between the two hallways, every moment increasing his chances of getting caught. Wand or door. Defense or escape. Fight or flight. Right or straight ahead. There was also a chance that his parents had snapped his wand. Upstairs or out. <em> My wand won’t help me anyway, </em> he decided. <em> If I use it, I’ll get expelled, and I can hardly fight off my parents if they really put their minds to it. </em>They never had before, but Sirius wasn’t going to risk it. Sirius wondered again how they would respond once they saw the blood rune. He recalled Mother at dinner when she accused him of–of–well, attempted murder, her face filled with garish pride, and surpressed the urge to scream. </p><p>Every hair on his back prickled. He placed one foot in front of the next, shuffling quietly across the floors, fingers brushing against the wall for lack of light. He didn’t know what would happen if his parents woke up right now and caught him. He didn’t want to think about it. He didn’t know what they would think when they saw the blood rune in the cellar, or how it explained his escape (because it didn’t). He didn’t want to think about it. Once he was out of the dining room, he transformed back into a dog. He was too short for the portraits to see this way. </p><p>Oh, he hoped they’d be impressed. Cunning and ambition might be the desired traits, but magic was ultimately what they valued above all. He hoped they’d see the blood rune and regret everything; every insult, every punishment, every scar. He hoped they would know it was too late to ever be sorry, because Sirius got the last laugh, slipping out and destroying the work of a dozen Blacks in the process. He wished that he’d get to hear them say that and apologize, although he knew they never would. . </p><p>(A tiny part of him wanted to come back and see if they could ever love him the way he always wished they would, but Blacks have no use for wishes, much less ridiculous fantasies-)</p><p>He passed through the foyer and the antechamber, studiously avoiding the part-animal armchairs that his parents had put in every living room, just for fun. They seemed to think it was funny to see their guests shriek when they realized that being a Black entailed having dangerous magical items everywhere, and treating them like everyday objects. Or sitting down in part-cat sofa that grew teeth and hissed at the offenders (Drisela and Lysander Rowle). That <em> had </em>been pretty funny, but of course Sirius got in trouble for laughing. He considered taking one of the weapons hung up on the wall for decoration, maybe a knife or two, before deciding that they definitely had a curse attached. </p><p>One last hallway. Sirius’s vision zeroed in on the door at the end. So close to freedom. So. Damn. Close. Of course, once he got out, it might set off a curse, or an alarm of some kind. He couldn’t get far in the dark, not as bruised and shaken as he was. He hated caution. It reminded him too much of his family. But right now, he needed it to get out safely. <em> Creak. </em>Sirius froze. That wasn't him. Dogs didn’t make the floorboards creak. In the darkness, Sirius transformed back into a human and listened. Dogs had far better hearing, but being caught as a dog would be even worse than being caught as just Sirius. </p><p>Silence. His own, stifled breathing. The paintings really would wake up if you breathed too loudly. If they did, he’d have to make a run for it, caution be damned. There was no way he could grovel his way out of this one, no matter how much Mother loved to see him do it. But the portrait of his (grandaunt? great-grandaunt?), Lycoris Iola Black, continued to sleep. Even though he was out of the cellar, he was still cold. Sirius wasn’t sure if it was because his dress robes weren’t particularly insulating or is his senses (and brain) were hyper alert and thus taking away energy from his limbs. Still, his palms and his armpits began to sweat and Sirius struggled not to swallow too loudly. </p><p>Sirius eyed the single brown door. So deceptively simple. Turn the knob, go out. It couldn’t be that easy, could it? Or was he the even greater fool for standing there and not opening the damn door? But he’s heard someone. Right? Finally, Sirius forced himself to take three large steps, crossing the distance swiftly and not that quietly. </p><p><em> “Sirius,” </em>a voice breathed, and Sirius tensed, then relaxed. Regulus may be at their parents’ beck and call, but Sirius was much happier to see him than, say, Kreacher. </p><p>Sirius stepped closer. <em> “Reggie,” </em> he whispered back, syllables floating across the air between them so softly they almost disappeared. Turned out, Sirius needed no practice in being quiet. Just the right incentive. “ <em> What are you doing here?” </em></p><p>Regulus didn’t answer. He was in his pajamas, Sirius noted, as he stepped closer. Silently, Regulus held up one of Sirius’s robes, and just as wordlessly, Sirius put it on. The very warmest of Sirius’ robes. But why Regulus, the perfect son, who always looked the other way when Walburga took out her anger on Sirius? Why was he doing this? </p><p>Said son offered Sirius his wand (dragon heartstring, dogwood, 15 ½ inches) and without a word, Sirius sild it into his robes. </p><p>“They wanted to snap it in front of you,” Regulus murmured as Sirius stepped closer, shoes sliding awkwardly on the wooden floor. “If you. Refused.” Not that they would ever tell that to Regulus, but his younger brother wasn’t dumb. Sirius wondered if he had really gone to tell the Malfoys there was a delay of if he’d stayed by the dining room and listened.</p><p>Regulus handed over a stack of coins between two fingers. Carefully, Sirius set it in his robes without clinking them. “All the Muggle money I found in your room,” he said in an undertone, his distaste for <em> Muggles </em>barely audible. It couldn’t be, not when he was reduced to this volume. </p><p>Sirius nodded his thanks once. It hardly needed to be said. Regulus knew exactly what he was risking if their parents caught Regulus trying to sneak back upstairs. </p><p>Regulus gingerly placed a pair of shoes on the ground and stood up. Sirius carefully eased out of the dress shoes he’d been wearing and slipped on the Muggle sneakers with far more grace than he was used to. If only his parents could see him now. Graceful, quiet and restrained. Wearing Muggle shoes. Escaping. Defying their wishes, hopefully one last time. </p><p>“I couldn’t risk Hooter,” Regulus whispered, although the name of Sirius’ owl was technically Ibis. Sirius nodded his understanding. The last thing he wanted was his owl hooting angrily because he’d been woken up. Regulus gave Sirius was a jar packed to the brim with snacks, which he also slid into his robes without looking. Regulus no longer knew what his favorite snacks were, but Sirius found that he really didn’t care. </p><p>He didn’t know how Regulus knew to be waiting here, when he’d never escaped the cellar before. He didn’t know what would happen when his parents woke up and found Sirius gone. Sirius didn’t want to know what would happen if they found their two sons here, conspiring in the darkened entrance hallway. He was still filled with manic adrenaline from his flight, keeping him alert and moving, but already he felt lethargy creeping in. Soon he would be too tired for anything. </p><p>“How did you know to get Muggle money?” Sirius asked instead, genuinely curious, moving his copper wires to his new robe and folding his dress robes into a tight wad of cloth. </p><p>Regulus didn’t know why either. He didn’t know what had prompted him to wait until his parents were definitely asleep, then creep downstairs with a bunch of things Sirius would need if he was running away. He knew that Sirius would want to run away; that much was obvious. Even his parents knew it. But as to how he knew that Sirius would escape the cellar, when all the curses on the door should be impossible for a wandless, upcoming Sixth Year to break?</p><p>Well, that he couldn’t explain.</p><p>It’s just that, years ago, back when Regulus and Sirius were more like brothers and less like roommates, before Sirius went to Hogwarts but after his first afternoon in the cellar for breaking a Black family heirloom from the reign of Queen Anne, after several long, excruciating hours sitting outside the cellar door, Sirius’s dinner cooling on the floor beside him, after Sirius was finally allowed out, now timid and red-eyed, after their parents had found more important matters and left the brothers alone again, Sirius had turned to him and said <em> one day, I’ll be able to blast that door to </em> smithereens, <em> and then they won’t be able to keep me there anymore </em>–</p><p>And Regulus had believed him. Even years later, when Mother had found better punishments for Sirius, he hadn’t stopped believing him. </p><p>After the fight, when the manor settled into silence again, Regulus kept on hearing Sirius. He lay in bed bawling his eyes out like a <em> pathetic little Hufflepuff </em> as quietly as he could so nobody would hear him. (Sirius used to hear him, and he always came, every time, he came, came, <em> came, </em> until he didn’t anymore). Kreacher was cleaning the dining room, and his parents had gone to bed. Regulus was alone with his doubts and tears. Or, he should have been alone, but he kept on hearing Sirius from ages ago, saying <em> they won’t be able to keep me there anymore, just you wait, Reg, you’ll see, they won’t know what to do with me– </em></p><p>Even when Sirius wasn’t there, he still managed to make a nuisance of himself. Mother had sent Regulus out of the room when the fight started up, as usual, but this time instead of running somewhere he couldn’t hear them, he’d wanted to listen. Sirius would say it was his Ravenclaw side, and Regulus would stir at the uncomfortable reminder of what the Sorting Hat had told him <em> (you’d be a great Ravenclaw, you know, you’ve got the brains for it) </em> , and snap at him <em> but I made it, I was Sorted into Slytheirn, I did what I was </em> supposed <em> to do </em>–</p><p>And yet he’d stayed, driven by a hunger to <em> know, </em>instead of doing the smart Slytherin thing and leaving. Then he’d known. And then he’d ran back to his room and started crying into his pillow, unable to sleep, his mind too wild to consider sleeping. He almost regretted listening. </p><p>Almost. He’d heard the fight, but more importantly, he’d heard how it…well, he’d heard enough. He knew Sirius was down in the cellar again, alone, desperate, a Black, and a Gryffindor. Regulus sat up in bed and rubbed his eyes and thought, <em> the last time I cried in the middle of the night, Sirius came and whispered stories about the Wumpity Numpties for hours, but this time he can’t come, this time, maybe I should go to him. </em></p><p><em> He deserves everything he got, </em> he’d told himself, because that’s what he would say to his parents, but he couldn’t bring himself to believe it. Regulus had sat in shocked horror as the fight spiraled further and further out of control, until finally he was running, hiding under his covers, crying like he was five years old again, and not once had <em> he deserves it </em>crossed his mind. </p><p><em> It’s better for everyone if Sirius goes, </em> he’d decided. Where once Regulus had trusted his brother with everything, now he at least trusted his brother to do something stupidly desperate and stupidly Gryffindor. <em> Blacks do impossible things when they’re desperate, </em>he thought, and then gotten out of bed. </p><p>“I don’t know,” Regulus answered, shrugging. “It was just on top of your drawers.”</p><p>By then the brothers had changed positions; Sirius with his back to the door, Regulus facing Sirius. </p><p>“Stay,” Regulus blurted.</p><p>“Come,” Sirius said impulsively, at the exact same time.</p><p>The two brothers stared at each other. </p><p>“You know I can’t,” Sirius replied. </p><p>“I wish,” Regulus began, and then stopped. Blacks have no use for wishes. </p><p>“You don’t even want me to,” Sirius whispered fiercely. “You want me out of the way.”</p><p>Regulus stuck out his chin. “Maybe I don’t want to live with Mother’s wrath by myself.  Is that so wrong?”</p><p>“It is,” Sirius hissed, ready to spit out a list of injustices committed against him, but for the first time in years, nothing came. His words got caught in his throat, which had gone dry. It wasn’t that he <em> liked </em>thinking about them, it was just that now he wouldn’t. Couldn’t. </p><p>Regulus’ lips thinned. “I see,” he said, angry at himself for feeling stung by his older brother’s vicious disapproval. </p><p>Sirius read only condescension in his brother’s words and bit back the urge to prove himself right. “I’m leaving, Reg, and I’m not sorry,” Sirius whispered harshly.</p><p>Reggie smiled humorlessly. “Of course you’d throw it all away. You never cared, did you, throwing away what others would die for like waste–.”</p><p>“On the bright side,” Sirius hissed, “now you’ll be the unchallenged favorite son. No one to steal the attention from how perfectly <em> dull </em>you are. Mother used to call us “the Heir and the spare”, you know that, I heard her once, had an extra just in case–” he broke off. </p><p>Regulus took a step back and tilted his head back ever so slightly, like he was about to yell loudly. </p><p>“Don’t,” Sirius said. “You. Dare.”</p><p>Reggie’s eyes glared back. <em> Dare me.  </em></p><p>“Please,” Sirius added. And then quietly; “I’m sorry.” He hadn’t meant it. Spitting back insults at his brother just came naturally to him at this point. </p><p>“It’s better for both of us this way,” Regulus said softly. He knew it was, he really did, but he wasn’t sure if he’d ever be able to forgive his brother for abandoning him. (And he knew one reason for helping his brother leave was so that he could finally have all of his parents’ attention, but how could he tell that to Sirius?)</p><p>“This family is going to get you killed,” Sirius warned half-heartedly. </p><p>“It’s better than being <em> you </em> ,” Regulus retorted. “Ever since you went to Hogwarts, you’ve been obsessed with <em> Muggle this </em> and <em> Muggle that </em> until you’d forgotten where you came from. <em> Toujours Pur, </em> Siri. You betrayed our family first.” <em> You used to take the fall for me, </em>he thought. Back when it was just the two of them, Sirius would always take the blame when they got into trouble. But then he went to Hogwarts and found people who would take the fall for him. Regulus knew he should dislike his brother’s friends for not being worthy of a Black, or for being Muggle-lovers, like their parents did, but he knew he was mostly jealous that Sirius liked them more than him. </p><p>“Yeah, well, it’s better than obsessing over the Dark Arts like they’re a fucking hobby until I’m just as mad as the rest of our bloody fucking<em> family,” </em>Sirius growled. “You really should’ve gone into Ravenclaw, Reg, you’d’ve been the pride of the House.”</p><p>They glared at each other, temporarily forgetting that Regulus had risked his own security within the family on the off chance that Sirius would escape the cellar. </p><p>Sirius tried to reign in his voice. When had he gotten so loud? He blamed Regulus. “You’re an idiot,” Sirius whispered, “if you think you’ll be protected just because you’re a <em>Black</em>.” He spat his last name out like a curse word, the way his mother spat out Mudblood or half-breed or even worse, <em>Muggle. </em></p><p>“<em> You’re </em> a fool,” Regulus whispered back harshly, “if you think they’ll ever forgive <em> you </em> for being a <em> Black </em> .” And he hissed it the same way Sirius had heard Rook Spinchen say, “the vote on denying jobs on the basis of blood status, stalled by Cygnus <em> Black” </em> , as an explanation for why he hadn’t gotten the internship he so desperately wanted. The same way Frank Longbottom had said <em> “Black” </em>when he passed dear cousin Bellatrix in the hallway after she had a stand-off with his girlfriend, Alice. The same way Lily Evans had said his last name when she caught him and James messing with Snape.  </p><p>So Sirius had nothing to spit back at Regulus, because while his friends had long forgiven him for his upbringing, and that should be enough, he knew Regulus was right. </p><p>The two Black brothers stared at each other, wondering if it was the last time they would see each other. Wondering if things would have been different if Walburga hadn’t sunk her claws into Regulus when Sirius went off the Hogwarts. If she hadn’t panicked so much when Sirius got Sorted into Gryffindor. </p><p>They lapsed into silence. Danger still tingled in the back of Sirius’ mind, but the imminent panic had passed. He was one step from the door, and yes, his parents could Apparate, but they couldn’t track him. He found himself wanting to stay and talk to his brother. They hadn’t talked, not really, for years. The pressure of their situation seemed to be forcing them into conversation. Somewhere in the back of their minds, they both wondered if this would be their last chance to really talk, since Hogwarts wasn’t really an option.</p><p>Sirius couldn’t leave without asking. “How did you know I’d escape?” </p><p>Regulus shrugged one shoulder elegantly. “I guessed. You were desperate, and you were a Black. And anyway,” Regulus continued, knowing that his brother must have thought of it already, “the wards won’t let you out.”</p><p>“Don’t worry about the wards.”</p><p>“You took them down? How did you take them down? That should be impossible. Is that how you broke out of the cellar?” Regulus’s Ravenclaw side showed itself. The boy leaned forward, hungering for knowledge. </p><p>Sirius turned away and faced the door. The image of the blood rune burned in the back of his mind, but Sirius tried to pretend he didn’t know what Regulus was talking about. It didn’t mean anything, he told himself. <em> Hogwarts doesn’t teach blood runes for a reason. </em> It didn’t mean anything. He was desperate. <em> And what happens when you’re desperate again? </em> He wasn’t like his family. He didn’t do it for fun. <em> How long until you slip off the edge and end up like Lycoris Black? You’re already halfway there. </em> Sirius tried to himself that it didn’t matter what his family would think; he didn’t care, right? But all he could see was Mother laughing in delight, grinning in Sirius’s face and saying <em> see, you’re just like us after all </em>–</p><p>His whites flashed in the dark. “Some things, Reg, I gotta keep to myself.” It wasn’t as if his brother would disapprove of his use of Dark Magic. He would use it as proof that Sirius belonged here, hold it over his head at Hogwarts with subtle glances at his friends and <em> you don’t want them to know, do you? </em> And that was exactly why Sirius wouldn’t–couldn’t–tell him. </p><p>Regulus smiled bitterly. “You’d’ve been a great Slytherin if you wanted to be.”</p><p>Sirius grinned back remorselessly. “If only.”</p><p>The space between them seemed to stretch. The night grew long, but both brothers were wide awake. Regulus’ eyes darted to the ruined state of his brother’s hair. </p><p>“Why would you give this all up?” Regulus asked. They were the pureblood princes. They could get away with almost anything. Get almost any job they wanted with minimal effort, or not have a job at all and live in style for the rest of their lives, like their grandfather, Lord Black. Ruin those who dared insult them with a word to the right person. Eat at the finest restaurants, wear the fanciest robes, have access to knowledge others only dreamed of. Not worry about doing well <em> for a Muggleborn. </em>They didn’t have to face the constant need to be the very best to even be considered equal. </p><p>Marry whomever their parents chose for them. Constantly suspect your so-called friends for betrayal. Serve and die for Voldemort in the oncoming war, and oh, was it coming. </p><p>Sirius flexed his left wrist, feeling the sting on the back of it. He shrugged, trying for his usual casual attitude. “What am I losing?” </p><p>He thought he knew what he was losing then: the security of his next meal, even if it came with guest dinners and elite parties. Having clothes to wear, even if they were always green, black, or silver, and he liked Muggle clothing better anyway. Being able to take a shower, even if he normally avoided it like the plague. A roof over his head, even if the objects inside weren’t friendly. His family. Any hope of reconciliation. He wouldn’t run away for fun, even though he’d once tried to jump off the Hogwarts Express for fun. Sirius knew what he was getting into. A little voice in the back him his head screamed at him a thousand ways it could go terribly wrong and sobbed in fright because <em> what would Mother and Father say </em>but Sirius dismissed it as Black paranoia. Because that was all it was, right?</p><p>
  <em> (Goodness, do you think he suspects?) </em>
</p><p>Regulus tightened his lips, but said nothing. “You know if you come again,” he whispered, “I’ll have to turn you away.”</p><p>Sirius was silent for a moment. “If you ever change your mind,” he said finally, “I’ll never turn you away.” And he didn’t know if he meant it in that moment—in all likelihood, he didn’t—but he had to say it. He couldn’t let Regulus say <em> no </em> and not say <em> yes.  </em></p><p>“Even though–”</p><p>“Even though we’ll be on opposite sides of the war.”</p><p>“It’s not a war, Siri,” Regulus sighed. “It’s just purebloods pushing for the rights we <em> deserve </em>.”</p><p>“It will be, if your <em> Master </em> has his way.”</p><p>Regulus blanched, but didn’t confirm it. Nor did he refute it. “Good luck, Sirius,” he murmured. “I hope you know what you’re doing.” </p><p>“‘Course,” his older brother answered confidently. “Yeah. I’ll be fine.” </p><p>(Later Sirius would look back and laugh and laugh and laugh at poor little innocent Sirius who stood there and told his little brother <em> yeah, of course I know what I’m getting into–) </em></p><p>But tonight Sirius straightened his shoulders and tried to smile reassuringly for his baby brother. </p><p>The brothers hesitated for a moment, but in the end they hugged gently. Regulus used to bury his head in his brother’s shoulder, but tonight it was covered by a cutting curse. Sirius didn’t dare ruffle his hair, because he hadn’t done it in years anyway and he didn’t want to make his little brother mad. (Regulus hated being treated like a little kid). <em> I’ll miss you, </em> Regulus might have said, if he’d been braver, or more Hufflepuff. <em> I’ll miss you, </em> Sirius might have said, if Regulus wasn’t a reminder of everything he hated. <em> I love you, </em>neither of them would have said until it was too late. </p><p>Maybe one day. </p><p>They separated, brushing their robes awkwardly as if they could get rid of all evidence of affection. Leaving his wand in his pocket, Sirius turned to the door and tried the doorknob, which rotated silently. The front door clicked softly and swung open. He stuck his untwisted wire through the door frame. Nothing happened. No portraits started screeching, no ancient curse came alive and sealed the entrance, his wire did not burst into flames or spontaneously combust. All in all, it was rather anticlimactic. Sirius felt a knot of tension leaving his stomach in a woosh. </p><p>“I guess it’s safe,” Sirius said, when nobody stirred. Regulus watched his brother’s back with avid eyes as he stepped into the doorframe. He’d never stopped looking up to his brother, metaphorically or physically. He’d just started fearing (and fearing for) him. Regulus thought that Sirius was throwing away his life with his recklessness. Sirius thought that Regulus was wasting his life with his blind obedience to the family and their ideals. Neither considered that both could be true. </p><p>Regulus found it easy from this angle to pretend that Sirius knew what he was doing. You couldn’t tell how ruined his hair was, or how puffy and red his eyes were. No, from this angle all you saw was a young man standing tall by the light of the moon, Black as the night he was running into. </p><p>“Goodbye, Siri,” Regulus whispered in a hushed voice.</p><p>“G’bye, Reg,” Sirius said simply, without turning around. The brothers moved at the same time; one heading for the darkened hallways of the Black Family Manor, the other heading out into the wide, unknown world of the dying August night. </p><p>Sirius Black limped out into the night with his wand, some snacks, a pile of coins, and the clothes on his back. He never looked back. </p>
