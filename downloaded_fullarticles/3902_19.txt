    <p>Ch. 1</p><p>"Prince Harry, look out your window and welcome back to Genovia." Joe murmured. I put away my journal and excitedly leaned over to peer out my window in the plane to see the green and beautiful Genovia.</p><p>I was very excited to be returning to where I now considered home. I had been attending college the last four years and now I had graduated just in time for my twenty first birthday.</p><p>Of course I was not immediately going to take the throne. I would be learning at my grandmother's side for a year before I was crowned king and Dorea stepped down. Of course I would also use this year to get close to my future husband and hopefully fall in love.</p><p>I had to be honest with myself, thinking about being king scared me so much sometimes I couldn't sleep.</p><p>I left the plane and stretched leisurely  with a bright smile. This was my home and I felt on top of the world here. I strode to the waiting car and excitedly climbed in to see Alexander my black lab puppy waiting for me.</p><p>"Alex!" I grinned happily. I got slobered on all the way to the palace but I had no problem getting loves from my baby.</p><p>"Welcome home Prince Harry." Fleur greeted as the limo door opened for me. Alex ran on up ahead and I followed at a slower pace.</p><p>The rest of the day was lazy as I was allowed to adjust to the time dofference from America. I went to bed at three in the afternoon in a small bedroom near my grandmother's suite. The next morning I was woken early so I could start adjusting to the time.</p><p>The weekend of my birthday arrived and I was dressed up in red silk tunic and leggings and robes with shined black dragon hide boots. The dances were what I was most dreading since I was so awfully clumsy.</p><p>The first dance started out fine. I was dancing with a handsome Italian man, Lord Blaise Zabini, and he was a beautiful dancer. Until suddenly he spouted a stream of Italian and then tried to dance a three step tango instead of the waltz. He repeatedly stepped on my toes and I dutifully hid my winces until the next song started and I was rescued by a very tall black man by the name of Lord Dean Thomas. He dance quite beautifully as well, though perhaps too creatively and when he began twirling and dipping me I felt nauseous. I was then stolen by a short fat round man named Baron Horace Slughorn. He was so round I almost had to curve with his belly in order to dance with him and keep a hold of his hands. He spent most of the dance talking about all his connections to the royal class and the parliament even though he never would have a chance to get there.</p><p>When at last that dance was over I was allowed a small break and as I stole a bite of cake I was flicked on the ear.</p><p>"I saw that!" I spun and nearly squealed when I saw my close friend Hermione.</p><p>"Mione!" I cried out happily as I threw my arms around her. She hugged me back and then I tucked her hand in my elbow and we walked around the large ballroom as we caught up with each others gossip. I loved Hermione almost as much as I did Ron and she was a great friend to have when you needed lots of advice. Ron was great and all but he was clueless when it came to men or dating or fashion. As we walked I bumped into a waiter and since he was bigger I was thrown back against another man and in the process my silver circlet slipped off. I saw in slow motion as it tumbled towards the ground only for a white gloved hand to catch it on one finger.</p><p>"Oh my!" Hermione gasped in shock at the whole event. Lord Malfoy stepped forward and gently set the circlet back on my head and made sure the jewels faced front.</p><p>"Th-thank you, so much." I stammered. Lord Malfoy smirked and gave a nod then strode off. Hermione wrapped her arm around mine and pulled me back into walking. Something about that smirk had unsettled me greatly. Eventually I returned to laughing with Mione only for another accident to happen. My foot landed rather hard on someone else's. When our bodies collided I stumbled back only to be caught by an arm around my waist and I was tugged into a strong chest. I caught my breath and looked up into a pale face and ice blue eyes.</p><p>"Hello Highness." The man purred.</p><p>"I am so sorry I stepped on your foot!" <br/>I blushed madly as I righted myself and straightened my robes. I glanced at Mione only to she her grinning away while chattering with another girl.</p><p>"Don't worry about it, Prince. These shoes were a little big. Perhaps swelling will make them fit better." The man smirked. I glared and smacked his arm.</p><p>"There's no need to rub it in." I pouted and grabbed Hermione to walk again. I was finally dragged back to the dance floor by a very old man, Lord Albus Dumbledore. I did not feel comfortable under his twinkly blue gaze and was grateful he wasn't a fixture at the palace in fact he lived nearly the other side of the country.  I felt like he kept trying to read my mind as we danced and when the song ended and I was passed to Biscount Neville Longbottom. He was an amazing dancer and I relaxed gratefully in his arms. He was cripplingly shy though and our conversation consisted of me asking questions and him mumbling as short of an answer as he could manage. Eventually his turn ended and I was handed off to another uncomfortable dancer and then another.</p><p>Lord Severus Snape was the worst of the night. He had greasy hair and his black eyes seemed to undress me as they stared down that hooked nose. I kept my eyes to the side or down as much as possible and when we were inturrupted even before the song ended I nearly cried in relief.</p><p>When I saw it was the man who kept me from falling earlier when I stepped on his foot I smiled brightly. We easily slipped into a perfect waltz.</p><p>"I'm glad my clumsiness hasn't affected your dancing." I murmured with a shy smile and a blush.</p><p>"Do not worry Prince Harrison. You may step on my feet any time you wish." He smiled gently back.</p><p>"Harry, call me Harry please." I requested. He pulled me closer to his body and dramatically slowed our dance to make talking easier.</p><p>"You may call me Draco." The blond man allowed with a handsome smile.</p><p>"Thank you." I smiled again then looked over to see Mione giving me a thumbs up. I blushed and looked back to see Draco giving me a soft smile.</p><p>"Pardon me, it is Prince Jacque's turn." A voice announced. We both turned to see a boy there with a self important look on his face. I smiled brightly and even though I regretted loosing Draco I stepped willingly into Jacque's arms. He was nearly as tall as me at twelve though since I was so pathetically short. I was five' three" and I felt quite disappointed about it. But I focused on Jacque and we chattered for a while about nonsense though he did try flirting a bit with me  until I was handed off to the next lord to dance with.</p><p>The night finally ended and I collapsed into bed to pass out from exhaustion. The next two days were spent opening gifts and personally writing out thank you notes to the hundreds of people who gave me them.</p><p>When at last I finished the presents and notes my hand ached and I was exhausted enough to sleep through dinner and then through the night till morning when I was woken so that I didn't mess up my schedule.</p><p>I spent a couple hours watching the news to catch up on events of the last couple days then I jumped when I heard a soft chuckle behind me.</p><p>"Oh!" I gasped when I saw two men there. "Sorry I thought I was alone." I blushed as I turned off the tv and nudged Alex off my feet so I could stand.</p><p>"It is no problem, Highness. My name is Colin." The taller blond said with a grin.</p><p>"And I'm Dennis." The shorter, dark haired, one grinned as well. They both bowed.</p><p>"Hi I'm Harry, you don't have to bow. I don't feel comfortable being bowed at." I waved a hand as I picked up my coffee mug and ambled across the room to shake their hands. They seemed surprised then nodded in synch.</p><p>"Prince Harry, your grandmother wants to see you in an hour in the throne room. She is with parliament." Fleur came in and informed me. I nodded and decided to explore a little.</p><p>It didn't take me long to get deep into unused halls and every room I discovered was coated in dust. I shocked myself by finding a tiled and rock walled room that was a private church. When I tried to move a candle holder it merely tilted and a door was highlighted with a soft glow of magic. There was a low hiss and I turned to see a small snake wrapped around the neck of one of the priests painted on the wall. It moved and lifted its head.</p><p>"You musst give a passssword." It hissed at me. I thought about it for a long while but only one thing came to mind.</p><p>"Peverell." I hissed back. It obviously was a magical only entrance and as the royal family were obviously the only ones who would use this place I thought that perhaps they might have used their own name as the password.</p><p>"Wrong. But you are sspeaker sso I shall let you through. The passssword iss Chevaliea." The snake hissed and then the door that had lit up earlier cracked open and led into a very dark room. I flicked my fingers at the candles on a shelf by the door which lit immediately. A little slot on the opposite wall caught my attention and I moved over to slide the metal to the side which moved silently. I peered through and saw that it was a spy hole to the rooms of parliament. I could get beheaded for this technically, but I heard my name and stayed to listen.</p><p>"Indeed we are well aware Lord Malfoy, Prince Harry plans to learn more at Her Majesty's side before assuming the throne." Lord Crawley, a muggle, spoke up, sounding irritated.</p><p>"It was not Prince Harrison I was referring to." Lord Malfoy corrected in a silky tone. "Now allow me to give a short back ground of this heir's bloodline. My wife is Narcissa Malfoy nèe Black. Her father was the Queen's brother. King Ignotus Peverell was the great great grandfather of Lord Orion Black. So as of September the fourteenth of last year, on the occasion of his twenty first birthday another heir of the royal bloodline became eligible to assume the throne. My son Heir Lord Malfoy." These words ripped a painful hole in my chest and made it difficult to breathe. "I take great pleasure in announcing that my son is ready and quite prepared to take the throne as Genovia's rightful King." The room erupted into shouts and protests and agreements as I clutched at the wall for support, my whole world caving in. This was the one place I had ever belonged and if it was stolen right from under me I didn't think I could get over it.</p><p>"I move to give a deadline." Lord Slughorn called. "Prince Harry must marry and take the throne in the next sixty days or he forfeits the throne to young Lord Malfoy." Others agreed but most disagreed until Lord Dumbledore shortened the time limit to thirty days. At that I slammed the slot shut and ran for it.</p><p>I only just made it to the throne room to meet Grandma and by the look she gave me she knew I had seen and heard everything.</p><p>"You don't have to do this Harry. You don't have to become King." Dorea took my hand and I smiled bitterly.</p><p>"I will not just bow out at this stage. This Lord Malfoy will have a much harder time getting the crown from me than he thinks." I straightened my spine and frowned in determination and Grandma smiled at me.</p><p>"Spoken like a true King." She murmured.</p>
