<p>Hermione Granger had spent most of the summer thinking about how her 7th and final year at hogwarts would go. She really didn't have that much else to do over the summer as after her mothers cancer scare her parents had decided to renew their vows and spent most of the summer on their second honeymoon. They had sat down with her before they went and told her that they were very proud of her top marks and ambition to succeed but that she needed to have a little fun too. These were supposed to be the best years of her life and she was not to work too hard in her last year and forget to enjoy being young. "Lifes to short to waste it" her mother had said and that if she got into a little trouble this year they would not be dissappointed in her. With emphasis on the little.</p>
<p>So she had sat around during the summer and thought about what she might want to do and accomplish her last year at hogwarts. Her first thoughts when her parents had suggested enjoying this year a little more had been, ~I have too much work to do what with NEWTS this year to even think about having fun.~ And for once instead of just going on with her studying this thought bothered her. Here she was only 17 and too busy to have any fun. She thought of all the times Ron and Harry had bugged her about being all work and no play or how the rest of her house mates called her a book worm and depended on her to always have her work done if they needed help. Even her parents were telling her to get into a bit of trouble and have some fun. Maybe she did need to lighten up a bit.</p>
<p>Of course she would still study enough to get good marks but she would definitly take time out and have some fun this year. And being Hermione she wanted to do it right. She made lists and researched and thought on just what her idea of fun would be. Hogwarts was going to see a new side of Hermione Granger. And like with all else if she was going to have more play and less work she was going to do her best.</p>
<p>Now here she was at platform 9 Â¾ ready to start her last year at hogwarts. With an un Hermione like wicked little grin on her face she hugged her parents goodbye and went to find Ron and Harry. Hogwarts wouldn't know what hit it.</p>
