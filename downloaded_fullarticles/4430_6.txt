  <span>It was the historic day of October 31, 1981, that Albus Dumbledore came across the bodies of the Potter couple. James Potter was discovered, lifeless, on the living room floor while his wife, Lily, was found in her child’s nursery. Her body was strewn along the floor like a puppet whose strings were cut. Though she had been found in the nursery, her son Harry Potter, was nowhere to be found. </span>
</p><p>Dumbledore and the Aurors searched countless hours but it was if baby Harry vanished into thin air. The only suspect in his disappearance was the one and only Dark Lord Voldemort. Voldemort had planned to kill the child after hearing a prophecy, in hopes of getting rid of his biggest threat. He chose to go to the Potter family himself, leaving his followers to kill the other child of the prophecy, Neville Longbottom. That was the last moment any of his followers saw him. When the new year came along, most of the remaining Death Eaters were found and questioned. Not a single soul had seen the Dark Lord. They believed him to be dead or rebuilding his power. However, when questioned under veritaserum, they swore up and down they had no idea where their master had gone. The investigation came to a stand-still when no new evidence came up and though reluctant, the task team assigned to the case were forced to label it a cold case.</p><p>Though the Aurors were forced to give up, Dumbledore never did. He knew he would see Harry Potter again, he just hoped that the boy would be of sane mind. He knew Tom Riddle very well, and he prayed to Merlin that the foolish man wouldn’t destroy the child in his insanity.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Teary emerald green eyes stared into ruby red ones for a long moment. He wasn’t sure who the man was, but he had hurt him, his forehead pounding. When Harry had cried from the pain, the man put his cold, long-fingered hand over his mouth, forcing him to quiet. He trembled in fear when a cold voice hissed to him. “If you don’t keep silent, I will change my mind to keep you and kill you instantly.”</p><p>The red eyes looked at him with such hatred that it froze Harry to the spot. There was a truly dangerous aura around this man and he knew that he should listen to him. He had already cried about his mum and his dad but the man ignored him. That’s all Harry wanted. His mother. With her loving green eyes, and fiery red hair that constantly smelled of cinnamon. Her warm presence was what he needed while he was trapped in a cold, musty room.</p><p>Harry’s attention was brought to a movement beside the bed he had been thrown onto. It was too dark for him to see but he felt something slither onto the bed slowly, a soft hissing pulling Harry’s attention to the left side of the bed. His eyes came upon a huge, rifle green snake. His eyes widened in fear as it raised it’s head and stuck it’s tongue out, running it lightly against his small cheek. His breathing picked up and his eyes filled with tears. Before they could fall however a gentle voice called to him.</p><p>“Hush hatcheling, there is no need for tears. I will not harm you.”</p><p>The gentleness of the voice reminded him of his mother and he instantly calmed down. He reached out a hand and wrapped it around the neck, pulling the snake towards him. A childish giggle filled the room as the snake wrapped it’s large body around Harry firmly, but not enough to hurt him. “My name is Nagini, young one.”</p><p>Harry tilted his head to the side curiously. “Gee-ni,” He said, unable to fully say her name but she didn’t seem to mind as she ran her tongue once more over his cheek affectionately. Young Harry was not sure if he would ever see his mother and father again but at least he had a friend, his childlike mind not at minding that it was a snake. There was at least some hope as to how things were going to be here in this strange man’s house.  </p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Lord Voldemort had never thought he’d stoop so low to end up raising a child. Children were filthy and annoying with their constant messes and crying. He was a Lord, why did he choose to raise the stupid Potter brat. Then he remembers the beginning of the prophecy. This was a boy who had the potential to kill him. It was the smartest choice for him to raise him since then the boy would never grow to his potential.  Oh, Voldemort will make sure he wasn’t a worthless idiot but the boy will never be exposed to magic. It was why he chose the boy to be his horcrux. No one would be able to find him again and his own dark magic will block out the child’s. It was a fool-proof plan. The only problem was the actual raising of the child. He could not risk anyone finding out that the beloved Harry Potter was with him so his only choice was to move away from England altogether.</p><p>Not wanting to deal with the child, he was quickly stunned, and Voldemort took him with him to a safe-house he had in Germany. He had bought the place when he traveled, a small stop on a bigger journey but the place was perfect. It was a small two-bedroom muggle house in the woods. The nearest neighbors were miles away. He quickly depositing the child in the second room, ordering his familiar Nagini to watch him while he worked to ensure the safety of the house. He established the strongest muggle repelling wards, and other ones that would keep the house off of anyone’s radar.</p><p>Voldemort knew he would have to get a house-elf because there was no way he would clean up after the child himself. Menial labor was not for a Lord to do. He was grateful that he chose Germany because they would never question why he would need said house-elf. It was quite easy to get one and bond it to him. He immediately ordered the pest, Binky, it’s name apparently was, to stock the house with food and to feed the slightly less annoying infant. Voldemort had been surprised by how well Nagini got along with the child. It seemed that with his soul, the infant inherited parseltongue. Nagini was able to calm Harry and keep him entertained which meant that Voldemort was less likely to strangle the boy.</p><p>When not checking on his charge, Voldemort researched ways to truly block out the child’s magic. So far, all the tomes spoke of immediate death when the wizard lost his magic. That or the wizard would become an obscurus. Both outcomes were useless to Voldemort. Either would end in death and he needed to keep the boy alive. In his anger, he threw the books across the room, watching them slam into the wall. He stared at the books in silence, anger swimming in his veins when he heard a cry. Damn the child! Now he chose to annoy him. Voldemort stormed from his room and over to the other side of the house, throwing the door open. On the bed, tiny hands clasped to his forehead was Harry Potter sobbing his eyes out. There seemed to be blood dripping from the scar that ran along his face. Blinking, Voldemort watched the boy curiously, anger slipping away slowly. Harry’s face scrunched up face relaxed but he still whimpered lightly to himself. Voldemort walked over and cleaned the blood from the boy’s face and looked at the scar intently. That’s when he realized that Harry probably felt his anger and it triggered a reaction from his scar. This was an annoying tidbit, since Voldemort, though he loathed admitting, had trouble keeping his temper. He knew it came with constantly splitting his soul, a small side effect of immortality. He would need to find a way to keep the anger at bay or at least controlled so he didn’t have to deal with an annoying snot-faced Potter.</p><p>It was at that moment Voldemort knew that raising Harry was going to be the biggest challenge he ever faced.</p><p> </p>
