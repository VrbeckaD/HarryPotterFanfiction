    <p>A/N I told myself I would do another one of these until I finished Grim's Darkness. Yet here we are. For those of you have not seen through volume three and four. There are spoilers. Soul mates, WBWL, twins fanfiction.</p><p>Ozpin's POV</p><p>Once more he was in the darkness that never ended. When some died they saw a white light. Due to his failures he never saw the light any more. Not until Salem was defeated. He was so tired of fighting in a useless war. All he really wanted was to die. Yet he could not abandon the kingdom's to their doom.</p><p>To his surprise instead of being forced into a new body he was surrounded by light. A familiar voice said, "It has been a long time Wizard."</p><p>One of the Gods decided to grace him with their presence. Oh joy. This was the last thing he wanted to deal with. After all that was one of his more painful deaths. Burned and buried alive. Cinder with the power of the Fall Maiden had actually killed him. Beacon had fallen and it was his fault for not preparing them better.</p><p>Now he would have to start over in a new body. The only upside was that Qrow would be searching for him whenever he reappeared. If he was honest with himself he was tired of this. Tired of fighting all the time. All he really wanted was peace.</p><p>The God said breaking through his thoughts, "Ozpin you have been fighting this fight for centuries with little success. The others and I have decided to go with a different plan. You however will not be getting off so easy."</p><p>He wasn't expecting to get off easily. The Gods loved to torture him with his immortality. All he wanted was to die and stay dead this time.</p><p>He snapped tiredly, "I'm done with you. If you think you have a better plan to save Remnant then go for it. Until then I will keep fighting."</p><p>As was his duty despite him never wanting it to be. All because of Salem. Their history was a long and bloody one. It only continued to become more and more bloody. So many lives had been lost to the fight. It was the reason why he no longer made friends or family when he came into a new body. All that would do was bring more hurt to him.</p><p>That was until he met a black haired boy named Qrow Branwen. Like Ozpin he seemed to not want anything to do with other people. It wasn't until he really got to know the boy did he understand why. His semblance was that of bad luck. Something he seemed to have an abundance of. After a little prodding and help on his part they became something of friends. Eventually Qrow became his closest confidant. Now he knew that it would be awhile before he saw the man. If his luck didn't kill him first that was.</p><p>The God said, "We are giving you an option this time, Ozpin. You can go back to Remnant and keep doing this. Or you can go to another world that needs help. You will be replaced by another who wishes to save Remnant."</p><p>That almost sounded better than what he was doing now. Take the other world and live and die like a normal person. However he had to be sure. There was no way he could end up in another existence like this one.</p><p>He asked, "If I die there, will i truly die? Or will it continue to be this ever lasting existence?"</p><p>The God said, "As long as you do not take your own life you will die. You will also have your magic back. You will need it where you're going. Aura and magic will be the key to your life."</p><p>At that point he was too tired to argue. Better get this over with. He could do one more life.</p><p>"Good luck, Wizard."</p><p>Being reborn in the new world was different than in Remnant. Instead of being put into a body with a soul he was given a new body. There wouldn't be a soul competing with his own. His name was Ozpin Atlas Rodux Black. His father was Atlas Black Lord Orion Black's younger brother. His mother was a French pureblood by the name of Lillian Rodux.</p><p>Something he learned as he grew up was that his father was a disgraced son of the Black family. Unlike the others he didn't go to Hogwarts. Instead he went to a little known French school known as Nightingale. While Atlas had not been officially disowned he was no longer allowed in the family manors. Instead of allowing his families hatred of him Atlas made a name for himself. He was one of the best defense instructors in France.</p><p>His mother was a well respected witch in the Wizarding World. She was a Potions Mistress. Many apocatharies sought her out for her potions.</p><p>They were what was known as soul mates. When every child reached a certain age they were given a soul mate mark. It changed from person to person but everyone had one. Ozpin's own told of his struggles from Remnant. Never letting him forget that he was no longer in his world.</p><p>Across his right bicep it said, To death. It made him wonder what his soul mates mark said. Unlike most others he didn't try to find his soul mate. If he came across them great. If not it wasn't meant to be.</p><p>Despite being in a new world kept a few things from Remnant. Like all Blacks and his past selves he had ebony hair. Even as a newborn he had amber eyes. Later he would come across his cane. A gift from one of the Gods no doubt. One thing he was pleased to find was that he still had access to his aura.</p><p>Growing up had been easy for him. Like any child he was taught about the world. Something he was pleased to note was that there was nothing like Grim in this world. That would be one thing he would never miss. His father taught him about British customs. While his mother taught him French. That way he could live in whichever country he chose.</p><p>It wasn't just magical studies either. He was taught about the muggle world as they called it. That magical and nonmagicals were not to mix. If they did it could spell disaster for their lifestyle.</p><p>By the time he was eleven he was well beyond first, second, or even third year knowledge. He could also use his semblance by then. While not as freely as he could in the past it was better than nothing. That was when he got his wand and found out that he was going to Nightingale.</p><p>They went to a French wandmaker. She was a woman who had blond hair and silver eyes. Upon seeing the silver eyes it had made his heart ache. It had made him wonder how Miss Rose was doing. Despite her no longer being his concern he still worried about them. By now though they had probably long since stopped searching for him. Given where he was he could no longer afford the thoughts to over take him.</p><p>Trying to find a wand had been difficult. His first five tries had resulted in broken items throughout the witch's shop. The next three had sent boxes everywhere. Two wands had even caught things on fire. This frazzled a man who had seen many strange things in Remnant.</p><p>It wasn't until the woman left with a contemplative look. When she returned she didn't say anything. Instead she just handed him the wand. The wood was grey in color with a black handle. The moment his hand touched it he knew it was the one. Both his magic and aura sang with acceptance. It was ash and time dust twelve inches. Time dust that was what connected to his aura. It would allow him to use it as both a magical conduit and an aura conduit. Besides his cane he had never been able to create one.</p><p>In 1970 he entered his first year at Nightingale Academy. Like all other school they taught the basic core classes. Unlike most schools they allowed for a single elective their first and second years. Very rarely they made exceptions for advanced students who proved themselves. Such an exception was made for Ozpin. He took ancient runes and arithmacy as his two electives.</p><p>His school years had gone without an issue. Ozpin had received straight outstandings on both his OWL's and NEWT's. Straight from his schooling he went to work for Gringotts. Ozpin was one of the few human cursebreakers they allowed. By the time he went to England interesting things were brewing.</p><p>James' POV</p><p>Before Halloween of 1981 his life had been perfect. James Charlus Potter had married Lily Anne Evans right out of Hogwarts. The first thing they had decided was that they wanted a child. Despite it being a time of war. So they tried time and time again for a child. At one point they had conceived but Lily had a miscarriage. They had been so devastated that they didn't actively try again for almost a year. When they tried again it was a miracle. They were blessed with twins.</p><p>July 31, of 1980 Harrison and Jacob Potter were born. Albus Dumbledore then proceeded to warn them of a prophecy. So with the Peter an old friend from school as their secret keeper they went into hiding.</p><p>For a year nothing changed then on Halloween of 1981 their lives changed forever. Peter gave up their location to the Dark Lord. The man stunned James and Lily before going for the children. No one was sure what exactly happened that night.</p><p>When James came to Dumbledore had arrived. The Potter Lord was obvious distraught for his children. Only to find out both of his children were fine. That the Dark Lord had been destroyed. Jacob had killed the Dark Lord. By Dumbledore's pronouncment he was the Boy Who Lived and the prophecy child. Both boy's had a scar. Harrison had a lightning bolt scar across his forehead. While Jacob had a lightning bolt scar across his right bicep.</p><p>Both he and Lily were so proud of Jacob. He was the older twin by a mere two minutes. Jacob would be his heir and the Boy Who Lived. His families game rose because of Jacob. There wasn't a single person in Britain who had not heard of them.</p><p>James and Lily took Jacob to many different events. Forgetting that they had another son. Harrison Potter faded largely to the background.</p><p>However when Albus came to visit them a few days ago he brought grave news. Harrison the younger twin was a squib. That was a blight in their perfect family that James could not allow.</p><p>So he took the how five year old Harrison to Gringotts. It was late in the evening so there weren't many wizards around. The goblins per their custom sneered at him.</p><p>As he moved towards one of the goblin counters he paused for a moment. A man with black hair was talking with a goblin. If it wasn't for his amber eyes James would have thought the man was Sirius. He made a mental note to ask his best friend about it later.</p><p>Pushing the boy forward he said to the goblin, "I wish to do the disinherit ritual."</p><p>It was almost impossible to surprise a goblin. James was the first wizard to do so in many years. Not that the goblin showed it's surprise. Instead it examined both James and his soon to be ex son.</p><p>Harrison for his part was quiet. He had learned long ago that arguing with his father would not end well for him. Instead he met the goblins gaze without fear.</p><p>The goblin asked, "You want to disown the boy? That will be fifty galleons."</p><p>It was a steep price but one James was willing to pay. He signed his name on the paper to authorize the payment. Then he pulled his wand out as the goblin nodded. He could disinherit the boy.</p><p>Without hesitation he said, I, James Charlus Potter Lord of the Potter family hereby disinherit you Harrison Potter. From this moment forward you are no longer apart of the Potter family. You will never again be welcome in any Potter manors. Nor will you find solace in myself or the woman who birthed you. I am not your father and she is not your mother. You are now Harrison no name. So I say it. So mote it be."</p><p>A white light surrounded both James and the boy. Harrison no name didn't even let out a whimper despite the pain he must have been in. Without another word to the boy James turned back to the goblin.</p><p>He said, "He is no longer the Potter's responsibility. Good day goblins."</p><p>With that he turned on his heel and left the Gringotts. The dark thoughts of the boy leaving him the further from the boy he was.</p>
