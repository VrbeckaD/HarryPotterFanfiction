    <hr/><p> </p><p>One month. Un mes. Un mois. Ein monat.</p><p>One month, that’s all. That’s doable. It’s fine, really it is.</p><p>Harry repeats this mantra in his head as he watches his breath fog up a small patch on his bedroom window. The sun is blinding, piercing his eyes and heating up the skin of his forehead as it rests against the cool glass.</p><p>One month. It really isn’t that long, considering the sixteen years he has had to survive at the Dursleys thus far. A singular speck of a month. A mere thirty-one days until Harry turns seventeen and can pack up his meagre belongings and get as far away from this house as is humanly possible.</p><p>Harry is itching to start the hunt for the Horcruxes, can feel the uncomfortable tick under his skin pricking alongside an ever-present irritation that won’t seem to cease. Every loud noise, every snide remark from his guardians, every second of deafening silence when they leave him alone makes Harry’s eye twitch.</p><p>He knows, logically, that this is probably due to the fact he hasn’t slept properly in weeks. Every time he closes his eyes he sees Dumbledore’s fragile body plummeting over the side of the astronomy tower. Not a particularly peaceful image, anyone could agree.</p><p>Sometimes it isn’t Dumbledore’s stricken face he sees. Sometimes it’s Snape’s blank, hooded eyes as he casts the unforgivable. Sometimes it’s Malfoy’s tear-streaked pale face, grey eyes wide and full of terror. Those two particular images fill Harry with such a suffocating rage that all he can do is lie in bed and <em> vibrate </em>, muscles tense and breath filtering the air of his tiny room with quick short pants.</p><p>One month. One month, <em> onemonthonemonthonemonth. </em></p><p>One month has never felt so disgustingly far away.</p><p>Harry reaches up with his right hand and lazily presses two dots on the fogged glass next to his cheek. Underneath he swipes a long curved smile, a crude contrast to his dark mood.</p><p>A car pulls up in the driveway, Harry’s eyes focusing past the drawing to the three figures heaving themselves out of the car and making their way to the front door. Harry watches as they disappear inside, the door slamming closed making him flinch even though he was expecting it.</p><p>“Fuck this,” Harry mutters to himself, unsticking his face from the glass and bolting from his room. He darts down the stairs, ignoring his aunts disapproving huff and flying out of the front door before she has time to draw another breath.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Harry ends up in the park a short walk away, pushing open the gate and heading for the swings on the other side of the play area. It’s empty, which is not unusual due to the fact that most of the climbing apparatus were destroyed by Dudley and his gang years ago, the council not bothering to fix them up when a newer, pristine park was installed half a mile away.</p><p>Harry could walk there, of course, but he prefers the peace of the abandoned play area over the sound of children laughing while their parents look on with doting smiles.</p><p>God how morbid, Harry thinks with a snort, perching down on one of the only two swings that are still in working order. Feet planted on the ground, Harry pushes himself back and forth as he glances around the park.</p><p>Memories of years finding refuge in this park come to the forefront of Harry’s mind, making him cringe a little. The last time he was here he had tried to start a fight with Dudley and his crew, which had been regrettably interrupted by dementors. Harry thinks he still deserves a fight, to be honest. It’s the least Dudley could do, considering.</p><p>Harry lets out a puff of frustrated air, eyes drawn down to his right leg which is bouncing rapidly in agitation. He places his hand on his knee, trying to smooth out the trembles of his thigh as he gnaws at his bottom lip.</p><p>A couple of dementors would be a welcome relief right now, he thinks. This thought is accompanied by a flash of green light and a sharp ache of betrayal and he twitches, squeezing his eyes shut to dispel the memory.</p><p>Maybe not then, actually.</p><p>“You’re one of the Dursley boys, right?”</p><p>Harry jerks, blinking his eyes open and turning his head to the right to spot a boy about his age sitting on the swing next to him. He looks taller than Harry, which is no great feat to be honest, with long lanky limbs and a mess of mousy brown curls framing warm brown eyes. He has a sprinkling of freckles across the bridge of his nose, slightly sunburnt cheeks above a healthy tan. The boy stares at him, head cocked curiously with an expectant look on his face.</p><p>Harry, a bit unnerved at not noticing his presence sooner, replays the question in his mind before answering with a short, “No.” He turns away.</p><p>The boy digs his heels into the dusty ground beneath him, swinging slightly. “But you live-?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Harry interrupts, feeling a familiar lick of irritation.</p><p>There’s a pause where Harry can feel the boy’s eyes flickering over his profile. He ignores it.</p><p>“Well, it’s probably a good thing you're not related, considering-”</p><p>“He’s my cousin,” Harry says bluntly, wishing the stranger would bugger off and absently wondering why Harry was engaging him in the first place.</p><p>“Well, you don’t look anything like him,” comes a low retort and Harry’s eyes flick back to the other boy for a second.</p><p>“Thanks,” Harry snorts.</p><p>“You're welcome.” The boy offers a small smile, glancing over his left shoulder for a moment as if hearing a noise behind him. Harry spots a dark purple bruise under his right eye, an ugly yellow tinge melting down onto his sharp cheekbone.</p><p>“I used to go to school with him. At St. Grogory’s? He was a right prick, to be honest, always picking on-”</p><p>“Yeah, I know, I was there,” Harry interrupts shortly, turning away once again.</p><p>“You were?” The boy sounds surprised and Harry can almost resist rolling his eyes.</p><p>“I was usually the one he was picking on.”</p><p>The boy squints at him. “Were you a year or two below?”</p><p>“Nope.” Harry’s tone is clipped, tempted to simply stand up and walk away.</p><p>“I don’t remember you.”</p><p>Harry glances over, one side of his mouth twitching up humorlessly before turning back to study the faded blue seesaw. He doesn’t explain that he’s hardly surprised himself with that comment, considering he spent the majority of his time at primary school hiding up trees and behind desks. But still. Considering there were only about thirty children in their class, for seven years…</p><p>Harry conveniently doesn’t entertain the thought that <em> he </em>doesn’t remember this boy either. But Harry has never been very good with faces. Unless they’re trying to kill him, he supposes.</p><p>After a moment of silence, the boy kicks at the ground and starts swinging back and forth in a lazy manner. The chains attached to the metal bar above him squeak with every forward swing, making Harry’s jaw twitch in annoyance.</p><p>“What happened to your eye?” Harry asks flippantly, hoping to cause the boy some sort of discomfort that would make him leave.</p><p>“Got into a fight,” comes the easy reply.</p><p>Harry turns his head to watch the boy’s retreating back suspend in the air for half a second before he swings back down. Harry feels the disturbed air brush against his face.</p><p>“With who?”</p><p>“Some guy.”</p><p>“Did you win?”</p><p>The boy chuckles ruefully. “No.”</p><p>“Do you like fighting?” Harry asks, eyeing him. The boy doesn’t reply straight away, but skids his feet against the ground until his seat is still once more. He gives Harry a considering look before smirking slightly.</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“Want to have a fight?” Harry asks before his brain even registers the question, and his heart thuds in anticipation as the boy turns to face him fully with raised eyebrows.</p><p>Harry stops himself from taking the offer back and forces himself to stare at the other boy with a bland expression.</p><p>Then, to his surprise, the boy grins.</p><p>“Alright.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>“What the hell happened to you, boy?”</p><p>Harry pauses in his rummaging inside the freezer, glancing up into his uncles glaring face. Harry blinks slowly up at him in a way he knows irritates the man to no end, before going back to his task and grabbing the ice tray from the top shelf.</p><p>“That better be from a car, I will <em> not </em>have you showing me up by fighting like a common mongrel in the streets!”</p><p>Harry gives the ice tray in his hands a vaguely offended look, honestly surprised to find himself surprised that his uncle would rather him get hit by a <em> car </em>than cause some sort of scene. He nudges the freezer door shut with one hip and grabs a tea towel from the unit.</p><p>Before he can drop any ice onto it, the material is swiped out of his hand by fat fingers.</p><p>“You will answer me, boy! And you’re not getting your filthy blood on our good towels!”</p><p>Harry sighs deeply, turning to face Vernon fully, who blanches a little at his face.</p><p>Curious to see the full extent of damage, having come straight into the kitchen when he arrived home to find something cold to press against his throbbing bottom lip, Harry gives his uncle a hooded look.</p><p>“It’s hardly a ‘good towel’, it’s got chocolate stains all over it from Dudley this morning.”</p><p>Vernon’s face goes a horrid shade of purple as he splutters in indignation. “You watch yourself, lad, or you’ll be getting a matching set of black eyes, you mark my words!”  </p><p>Unfazed, Harry nods indulgently back at the threat just as the front door slams shut from down the hall. Vernon turns towards the sound and Harry uses the distraction to snatch the towel out of his meaty grip and dart from the room.</p><p>“Potter!”</p><p>Harry ignores the shout, knowing his uncle can hardly ever be bothered to chase him up the stairs these days, and passes Dudley in the hallway. His cousin stops and stares at him with wide eyes, an oddly betrayed look passing his face as if Harry has caused some sort of deep disloyalty by getting himself beaten up by someone other than himself.</p><p>Harry flashes him a large grin, causing the huge boy to take an unnerved step backwards, and watches Harry run up the stairs until out of sight.</p><p>Harry’s first stop is the bathroom where he locks himself in and turns on the cold tap, inspecting his face in the mirror above the sink. He raises his eyebrows, causing an ache under the skin of his left temple. There isn’t a bruise there, yet, but the skin is red and slightly raised and tomorrow Harry is certain it will be a nice deep purple to accompany the one under his fat bottom lip.</p><p>There’s a crust of dried blood around one nostril and Harry wets some loo roll and dabs it away before running his cracked knuckles under the cool spray. He winces at the sharp sting before it eases, washing his hands thoroughly.</p><p>Glancing back up in the mirror, Harry shoots himself a large grin, smiling even wider when he notices the smear of blood over his teeth. He lets out an odd huff of laughter, using a wet finger to slide the blood across his teeth, staining the white a diluted pink.</p><p>Harry washes his mouth out, splashes cold water across his face and heads into his room. Climbing on top of the covers, face and hands throbbing in time with his steady heartbeat, Harry gloriously thinks about nothing.</p><p>And for the first time in weeks, <em> years </em> really, he sleeps undisturbed.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>“Want a lick?”</p><p>Harry chokes on a mouthful of vanilla ice cream, turning raised eyebrows at his companion. He stares at Lucas’ curious gaze before lowering his eyes to the offered cone.</p><p>“Er-no. I’m good. Thanks,” Harry mutters, fighting an embarrassed flush.</p><p>Lucas shrugs and pulls his own minty ice cream back towards his face, slurping up a generous chunk from the top. Harry tears his eyes away.</p><p>The two of them have met up in the park every day for the past week, enjoying a small tussle before laying side by side on the yellowing grass and nattering about nothing of great importance.</p><p>They hardly come to hard blows anymore, not after their third ‘fight’ when Harry hadn’t been quick enough to block a particularly nasty right hook to the temple and the world had gone black for a few seconds. When he had blinked his eyes open once more, Lucas had been kneeling over his prone body on the dusty ground with a pale, stricken look on his face and had muttered, “Yeah, I think that’s enough now.”</p><p>Harry had agreed to a degree. Every time he had arrived home in the late evening, more bruised and bloody than when he had left that morning, the Dursleys had given him nasty suspicious looks and Harry was pretty sure Dudley’s was starting to get mixed with a hint of <em>concern. </em></p><p>So, the boys decided to let their skin heal for a few days and mutually agreed that wrestling in the dirt like a couple of schoolboys was the more respectable option. They ended up winded more from laughing than from a blow to the stomach.   </p><p>Turns out, Lucas <em> does </em>remember Harry from primary school now that they’ve spent a brief amount of time reminiscing. He had gasped aloud when he had remembered the small dark-haired boy from his class, quiet and usually alone.</p><p>He had then gone on for almost fifteen minutes about how he couldn’t believe he hadn’t made the connection before.</p><p>Harry, possessing very little memories of his life before Hogwarts due to self-preservation, decided to stay quiet about the fact he still doesn’t remember Lucas. He suspects the other boy knows this, but he doesn’t comment thankfully.</p><p>“I still can’t believe your uncle told everyone you had been sent to St Brutus’,” Lucas snorts suddenly, stretching his legs out in front of him on the grass. “My dad’s-friend’s-son got sent there and <em> he </em>tried to stab someone with a compass once.”</p><p>Harry takes a bite out of his cone. “How much damage could a compass really do, though? I mean they’re not particularly long-“</p><p>“In the eye.”</p><p>Harry splutters. “Jesus!” Lucas grins at him.</p><p>“Imagine going to school surrounded by people like <em> that </em>,” Lucas scoffs.</p><p>A sharp, horrible image fills Harry’s mind: his shaking wand lowering as he stares down in terror at blood-splattered bathroom tiles and an unnervingly slack, pale face haloed by a growing red puddle staining white-blonde hair. Harry swallows, turning his eyes down to his lap. “Yeah. Imagine.”</p><p>“I can’t wait to finish school,” Lucas sighs, popping the rest of his cone into his mouth. “One more year and then: <em> freedom!” </em></p><p>Harry offers a strained smile, looking down at the rest of his ice cream with a sudden feeling of nausea.</p><p>“Don’t you?” Lucas pries after a moment of silence.</p><p>“Oh. Yeah, for sure,” Harry lies, wishing his life was so simple that he could be returning to finish his last year at school before heading off to Auror training. It’s not so simple though and some higher power clearly hates Harry with a deep passion, so that’s that.</p><p>Lucas eyes Harry’s unfinished dessert with a rather astonishing lack of subtlety and Harry passes it over with a small smile.</p><p>Lucas grins pearly whites and takes a large bite with relish. “Tell me more about your awful chemistry teacher.”</p><p>Harry cringes, wishing he had never brought up Snape the day before. It <em> hurts </em>, thinking about him. Talking about him is a whole other ball game. Glancing down at his hands, Harry notices a drip of ice cream down the side of his index finger. He licks it away to stall a reply.</p><p>Harry looks back up to see Lucas turning his face away quickly with an odd pink tinge to his cheeks.</p><p>“There’s not much more to say. He’s a dick,” Harry says shortly.</p><p>“What’s Scotland like? I’ve never been.”</p><p>Harry shrugs, fingers twitching as an itch prickles under his skin. “It’s beautiful.”</p><p>“As beautiful as Dudley?” Lucas asks, smirking.</p><p>Harry throws him a disgusted look. Lucas laughs, eyes bright, shoving the rest of Harry’s ice cream in his mouth.</p><p>“Impossible,” Harry grins.</p><p>“I don’t know how you can stand living under the same roof as him,” Lucas murmurs, mouth full. He shoots Harry a mischievous look. “I must applaud your self-control, being around such a specimen of beauty and-“</p><p>Harry launches himself at him, yelling at him to ‘Shut <em>up</em>,<em> oh my god </em>!’ Lucas roars with laughter, blocking Harry’s half-hearted punches as they roll across the grass together in a tangled heap of flailing limbs.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Hours later, the sun setting and casting a warm glow on the pavement, Harry strolls back to Privet Drive. His jeans are grass stained and dirty, and he feels light but less achy than he would prefer. He wonders how well he will sleep tonight.</p><p>This week with Lucas has been a welcome distraction from the neverending turmoil in Harry’s mind. From the prickling need to <em> gogogo. </em>The other boy, obviously, must be more than aware of the frantic efforts of Harry to push and push away something dark and painful. How could you not, when faced with someone who would much rather throw punches than talk about anything substantial. Who takes hits with such pathetic desperation.</p><p>Harry appreciates the fact Lucas doesn’t ask questions. He just smiles a dimpled smile and swings at Harry, or locks an arm around his neck and throws him to the ground, his solid, slim body following a second later to pin Harry to the grass.</p><p>Harry doesn’t try to think too deeply on the time they spend together, seeing their scraps as another form of training. Being a good dueller is all well and good when you have a wand. Pain is all well and good until you can’t tolerate it anymore. If Harry just keeps pushing his body to the very limit, he may stand a chance at surviving what is to come.</p><p>With this thought in mind, Harry turns the corner to Privet Drive and pads up the street towards number four.</p><p>As he’s sliding his key into the lock, the door swings open suddenly and Uncle Vernon stands at the threshold with a murderous expression.</p><p>Harry sighs and lowers his hand, wondering what on earth he has done now to be assaulted with the red-faced fury. He’s not <em> that </em>late back, it’s not even dark yet.</p><p>“Harry?”</p><p>Harry jerks at the familiar voice behind his uncle, twisting his body to try and see around the large frame blocking his view.</p><p>“Remus!” Harry grins, trying to push past Vernon who still stands there, shaking with rage. “What are you-“</p><p>Harry stops, noticing the grim expression on his former professor’s face. His stomach drops, heart in his throat and mind spinning as he thinks the worst.</p><p>The worst, however, can’t even compare to what he actually sees when another face appears behind Remus. Pale face scowling and full of disdain, upper lip curled in a sneer, Harry’s vision turns red.</p><p>It’s only Draco <em> fucking </em>Malfoy.</p><p> </p>
