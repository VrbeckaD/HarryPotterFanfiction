    <p>I count to ten.<br/>My head is floating in higher spheres, above my body. I can't feel my limbs.<br/>Almost there.<br/>I count to ten.<br/>The idle thought crosses my mind if this is what dying feels like. But that wouldn't make sense.<br/>I'm already dead, am I not?<br/>I count to ten.<br/>But I only make it to eight. A loud bang cuts through the veil hanging over my brain. Shouts. Heavy footsteps.<br/>I close my eyes.<br/>„Oh, fuck.“<br/>It's said in a different cadence than usually.<br/>I get back to counting, trying to draw the veil up again.<br/>„We need backup.“<br/>I think there are new hands on my body, but I can't be sure. It doesn't matter.<br/>I count to ten.</p><p>„Okay. Okay, so you're just leaving now. Cool. Fucking great,“ I say and stare at Ginny's back.<br/>She turns around, annoyance written over her face with permanent marker.<br/>„I've got practice. I told you that a million times before.“<br/>„Yeah, well – it would just be nice to maybe see you from time to time. Just to catch up, you know.“<br/>I know I'm being a prick, but I can't stop myself. <br/>Brown eyes narrow at me. Firey hair seems electrified.<br/>„Stop being such a baby, Harry.“<br/>With that, she slams the door shut.<br/>I swallow and lean against the kitchen counter.<br/>My girlfriend is going to be the Harpie's next shooting star. I need to stop – this. I need to stop being insufferable.<br/>With a sigh, I rub my neck and then point my wand at the coffee machine to refill the water tank.<br/>Ginny doesn't drink coffee because it upsets her stomach, but I developed a serious addiction to the dark liquid.<br/>I take sips from my favorite cup and look around the empty apartment. An apartment for two, which has eventually grown into an apartment for one.<br/>Which is fine. Ginny needs to practice and fly as often as possible if she wants to make it.<br/>I clean the dishes and listen to the Saturday morning radio and pretend that it's not the same as killing time.<br/>Ron's patronus startles me.<br/>„Dinner at my place tonight?“ the terrier asks and I smile.<br/>„Sure thing,“ I tell my silvery visitor.</p><p>I spend the day to clean the house and buy flowers and Ginny's favorite chocolates, before flooing over to Ron and Hermoine's.<br/>With Ron's rocketing Auror career, they were able to afford a very nice apartment near the Ministry, which Hermoine transformed into her personal library.<br/>„Harry!“<br/>Hermoine smiles widely and gives me a hug.<br/>She's wearing her comfy at-home-clothes, but there are some lipstick remains on her mouth and her hair is shiny and smoother than usually.<br/>„Good to see you,“ I say and mean it, while Ron pats my back.<br/>His smile seems a little distracted to me.<br/>„I'll get the wine?“ I ask and busy myself with filling three glasses while my friends set the table.<br/>„What's that?“ Ron asks, peering into the pot.<br/>„Stew,“ Hermoine says, a little clippedly.<br/>I bite my lip.<br/>Both of them hate to cook. And they're also both not good at it. I've sat through enough homecooked dinners to be an adequate judge.<br/>„That's nasty, Hermoine,“ Ron says after the first bite.<br/>Hermoine drops her spoon. Stew is splashing on the table.<br/>„I told you I didn't want to cook,“ she says, eyes very bright.<br/>„I've cooked last night.“<br/>They glare at each other.<br/>„I don't think it's that bad,“ I lie.<br/>„You're charming, Harry,“ Hermoine says and takes a sip from her wine.<br/>Ron rolls his eyes.<br/>We're eating in tense silence until I ask: „How's work?“<br/>Ron's nose scrunches just a little. There is a twitch around his mouth.<br/>„Terrible, actually.“<br/>Hermoine sets her glass down and looks at him.<br/>„What happened?“<br/>Ron hesitates, turning the spoon in his hand.<br/>„I'm not really allowed to tell you,“ he says.<br/>„We won't talk,“ I assure him.<br/>Curiousity is gnawing at me.<br/>„You'll know soon enough. Tomorrow, probably.“<br/>„Well, then you can tell us today already,“ Hermoine says.<br/>Ron stares at his stew.<br/>„We raided a... well. Whorehouse, I guess. Yesterday.“<br/>„Oh.“ <br/>Hermoine's eyes are full of sympathy. She reaches out and squeezes Ron's hand.<br/>„That must have been hard,“ she says.<br/>„It was bloody awful.“<br/>There is this hard set to Ron's mouth that always shows when he's shocked to his core.<br/>„It was one of those gangs that – you know. Trafficking. It's basically slavery.“<br/>We've all stopped eating.<br/>„I'm sorry, man,“ I say.<br/>„They only had former Death Eaters and such and I thought maybe that would make it – not better, maybe easier to bear. But – no. It was horrible. I don't think I'll ever -“<br/>He trails off and grits his teeth, looking at the ceiling.<br/>„Ron.“<br/>Hermoine's voice is quiet. She pets his shoulder.<br/>I feel slightly sick.<br/>„What happens to the victims now?“ Hermoine asks.<br/>„That's the worst part. We don't know. We just – don't know. Most of their family's are in Azkaban. Some don't talk. Some are sick. None of them really has a life to come back to. Or, well – most of them don't.“<br/>We're quiet for a long while.<br/>„They'll probably all end up in a psych ward.“<br/>Ron's voice sounds hollow.<br/>„You just need a place to stay for them?“ I ask.<br/>An idea is forming in my head. A mad one.<br/>Ron looks at me.<br/>„I mean, not just. But yeah. That's the main part.“<br/>„What about Grimmauld Place?“<br/>Both my friends stare at me as if I'd have lost it.<br/>„Man, that's basically your office,“ Ron says.<br/>„I don't need all the rooms. I mean, it wouldn't be permanent, right?“<br/>„No. Only until they're ready to find their own places. The Ministry plans on supporting them.“<br/>I shrug.<br/>„I wouldn't mind having them their. There's enough room and as long as they don't disturb my lessons, it'll be fine.“<br/>Ron blinks at me.<br/>„That's – yeah. I'll think about it. And talk to the others.“<br/>With a smile at me, Ron picks up his spoon.</p><p>It turns out that, surprisingly, I'm not the only one offering housing for former Death Eaters. There are some extended relatives, some good-people and some that are secretly looking for cheap workers, that are willing to take the victims in as well.<br/>„We've got two left,“ Ron tells me and I know already that it's going to be uncomfortable.<br/>„One because no one wanted him and one because she didn't want to leave her friend.“<br/>„Okay. I'll take them.“<br/>I'm nervous. My hands are rubbing over my jeans.<br/>„Wait until I tell you who it is,“ Ron says.<br/>„Who is it?“<br/>Ron looks me in the eyes.<br/>„Draco Malfoy. And Pansy Parkinson.“<br/>„You're kidding.“<br/>„Nope. I understand if you'll say no now, but...“<br/>„But?“<br/>„You wouldn't recognize Malfoy. He doesn't even talk. It wouldn't – he wouldn't try anything. I don't think he'd be capable.“<br/>My chest feels tight.<br/>„Oh.“<br/>„Yeah.“<br/>„What happened to him?“<br/>Ron huffs out a small breath.<br/>„Bad things, Harry. I don't – I don't like to think about it. I don't want to believe what some people are capable of.“<br/>„Okay.“<br/>My heart is pounding hard now.<br/>„So?“<br/>„I'll take them. I've got the rooms set up already.“<br/>„Good. I've told them that you're giving lessons almost every day and that they're not to disturb you. And I think it would be good if you told them not to – you know. Run into your kids.“<br/>I frown at Ron.<br/>„Why? They're not – are they, like, deformed?“<br/>„No, but they're all not dealing very well with strangers. And they could frighten the younger kids. But mostly, I don't want your older students to make fun of them.“<br/>I look at Ron for a long moment.<br/>This is the guy that hated Malfoy with every cell of his being. It's the one who laughed about Malfoy being tossed around as a ferret and punched him in the face after we've saved him during the Battle.<br/>And now he says he doesn't want my students to make fun of him.<br/>„Alright. I'll talk to them.“<br/>„They have meetings with a therapist scheduled weekly. And if – you know, if it becomes too much, you can always kick them out.“</p><p>My hands are sweating as I wait on my couch in the living room for Ron to arrive with whom I've decided to call my guests. <br/>I cancelled all my lessons for today and made sure there's food and coffee in the house. An attempt to feel prepared. In vain, I might add.<br/>I jump when the doorbell rings, heart in my throat.<br/>„Hey, mate.“<br/>Ron's smile is a little too bright.<br/>„Hi.“<br/>I step aside.<br/>My gaze wanders from Ron to my visitors.<br/>The first one I see is Parkinson.<br/>She's as short and dark-haired as she's always been. But paler now. Thinner.<br/>I have to crane my neck and lead them in further before I catch a glimpse of Draco Malfoy.<br/>For a split second, my heart just stops.<br/>He seems a little shorter than I remember him. Maybe that means I've grown taller. Or it's just due to the slump of Malfoy's shoulders.<br/>His almost white hair isn't slicked back. It falls loose around his face, covering his eyes. It looks like a child had cut it. Maybe he did it himself.<br/>All the while my eyes are on him, he doesn't look up once.<br/>„Um, hi,“ I say again. „Nice to see you all.“<br/>I want to kick my own ass. I'm so bad at this.<br/>„Hello. Thank you for taking us in,“ Parkinson says, her voice surprisingly clear. She takes a step forward and holds out her hand.<br/>I blink and shake it.<br/>„No problem,“ I say. „I'll give you a tour, yeah?“<br/>„That would be nice,“ the Slytherin says.<br/>I peer at Malfoy, but he keeps looking at the floor.<br/>„I'll be off, then,“ Ron says. <br/>He turns to Parkinson and Malfoy.<br/>„You both have my floo address. If you need anything, don't hesitate to call me.“<br/>„We will. Thank you,“ Parkinson says and Ron nods curtly, then pats my back and slides through the door.<br/>I swallow.<br/>„Okay, so. Here's the living room. There's the kitchen...“<br/>They follow me like ducklings. Their steps are quiet.<br/>„You can take anything you want. And here's a list for groceries. I'm not sure if – I mean, you're free to go whereever you like, of course. But I can go shopping too. Just – yeah. Tell me what you'd prefer.“<br/>Parkinson nods.<br/>I quickly rush through the rooms I teach in.<br/>„I give lessons Tuesday to Friday and sometimes Saturday too. I think it would be better if you stayed away from my students. They're all nice, of course, but – it might disturb classes,“ I say.<br/>Parkinson nods again.<br/>„Okay. Cool.“<br/>The stairs creak as I lead them to the second floor.<br/>„So, those are your rooms. We have two bathrooms on this floor. You can also use the one on the first floor if there are no lessons. I thought you could pick your own bedroom. There are four that are free.“<br/>„Thank you – a lot. If there is anything we can do for you, just let us know,“ Parkinson says.<br/>I interpret her hesitation after the Thank You the right way.<br/>„You can call me Harry. Or Potter, if that's better. I don't really care.<br/>„Alright,“ Parkinson says, her fingers restless.<br/>„Look, if you need anything – just ask. I'm not really sure, how – well. Just talk to me. I'm sure we can arrange something.“<br/>Parkinson smoothes down her hair.<br/>Malfoy looks at the floor.<br/>He's so thin. He's always been on the slimmer side, but not like this. His ellbows have never been this knobbly. His stomach seems to stick out more than his chest, his thighs are barely thicker than my arms (and my arms really aren't that impressive).<br/>„Okay. I'll let you get settled then.“<br/>„Do you live here too?“ Parkinson asks me.<br/>„Oh. No. I have an apartment. But I'm here quite a lot for teaching. And – here. I have this for you.“<br/>I hand her a galleon.<br/>She stares at me as if I'd have just -<br/>„I mean – that's for communication,“ I explain hastily.<br/>I turn to Malfoy and hold out my hand.<br/>It takes him a moment to register that I'm trying to give him something.<br/>He takes the coin from me, cautiously. Then drops his arm again.<br/>„If you tap against it three times, my own coin will get hot and I know that you want to see me.“<br/>„That is a very nice piece of magic,“ Parkinson comments.<br/>„It was Hermoine's invention,“ I say, smiling at the memories of the DA.<br/>„She's always been the smartest of us.“<br/>For the first time since they've arrived, a pang of annoyance shoots through me.<br/>„Says the one telling her she's got rabbit teeth.“<br/>Parkinson pales.<br/>„I didn't mean to be disrespectful,“ she says.<br/>I look at her. Look at Malfoy.<br/>My stomach turns.<br/>„It's fine,“ I say because I don't know what else there is I could say.</p><p>I expected that Ginny wouldn't think of my new subtenants as a good idea. I did not expect her to throw a fit when I tell her.<br/>„I didn't mean to upset you with that,“ I say.<br/>She stares daggers at me, still sweaty from practice.<br/>„Taking in Malfoy and Parkinson like stray dogs? That damn well upsets me.“<br/>„Look, I'm not doing that because I like them so much. But they have nowhere else to go.“<br/>„And you think I'd care about that – why, exactly?“<br/>I frown.<br/>„Ginny, they've been through hell. Malfoy is mute now. Parkinson – pretends to have it together, but I think she'd say anything, do anything, so I don't kick them out. They're... done.“<br/>„They're not your problem, Harry.“<br/>She gives me a tired look.<br/>„You don't have to save them. Some people don't deserve saving.“<br/>I meet her eyes.<br/>„It's not about saving them any longer. It's about leaving them to die or giving them a chance.“<br/>Ginny throws her hands up.<br/>„Fine! Whatever. Do what you want.“<br/>I swallow. My heart is pounding. I can see the necklace I gave Ginny for her twenty-first birthday on the desk in the hallway. She always takes it off for practice.<br/>„Why are you always so cross with me lately?“ I ask her.<br/>The air seems to leave Ginny.<br/>She slowly lets her hair down.<br/>„I don't know, Harry. I just – I feel like you're not giving me...“<br/>„What? What am I not giving you?“<br/>„You're trying too hard. Things shouldn't be this hard.“<br/>I cross my arms.<br/>„We've been together for more than three years. It's normal that things change.“<br/>„But you're always – I don't know. I can't do this right now.“<br/>She turns away and heads to the bathroom.<br/>I listen to the shower running and wonder what on earth I've done wrong.</p><p>The bed at Grimmauld Place is big and too soft and smells just a little bit like old people.<br/>I can't fall asleep.<br/>There are shadows lurking and I have nothing to shut them out with.<br/>I count to ten. Then to a hundred.<br/>My heart is pounding.<br/>I want to go to Pansy's room, but I'm not sure I'm allowed to. Potter said he doesn't live here and I know he left earlier, but who says he didn't come back? Who says no one else is here?<br/>I can't leave this room. <br/>I count to ten until the sun rises.</p><p>The bathroom is so big that I don't know what to do with it.<br/>There is a bathtub too.<br/>I find myself looking at it for way too long, before pinching my forearm and slinking into the shower.<br/>It's been a while since I've had a shower this good. I decide to seize the opportunity and clean myself properly. Most clients like that better.<br/>I certainly do.<br/>„Draco?“<br/>When I step out into the hallway in my clothes from yesterday, Pansy approaches me.<br/>Her hair is wet and even though she looks tired, she seems to have slept a little.<br/>I know what Pansy looks like after a sleepless night.<br/>„The shower is brilliant,“ she says and takes my hand.<br/>I nod lightly.<br/>„I'm not sure when Potter comes back. But I'm starving though.“<br/>She heads to the stairs and I follow her dumbly – until we actually reach it.<br/>„What is it?“<br/>I don't want to go downstairs.<br/>This floor is empty. No one's here. It has a great shower and an okay bed. I don't want to leave this floor.<br/>„We're alone, Draco. No one will be downstairs. And Potter said we can eat. I'm fucking starving.“<br/>She swallows and I give in. I know she is and I hate it.<br/>I hate seeing Pansy hungry all the time. I hardly notice hunger anymore, but I know she does.<br/>Still, I almost faint on my way downstairs. My heart is hammering in my ribcage and it feels like my veins might burst.<br/>I want some Dreamscales. But I guess this is another period in my sorry life when I won't get any.<br/>I cling to Pansy's hand and she leads me into a kitchen that looks as if no one had used it in quite a while.<br/>„We've got toast and jam.“<br/>Pansy rips the package open and has wolfed down two slices before I've even lifted one to my mouth.<br/>„Eat, Draco,“ she says in her commanding voice.<br/>I do.<br/>It tastes like nothing, but the faintess in my bones starts to fade with every bite.<br/>„There is a coffee machine,“ Pansy says.<br/>I've noticed it too.<br/>Coffee. I love coffee. I remember that.<br/>„It's turned off though,“ Pansy muses.<br/>„Do you think...?“<br/>I shake my head.<br/>She sighs.<br/>„Better not risk it.“<br/>She fishes for another slice of toast and spreads jam on it.<br/>„They said we're free now, you know,“ she tells me, looking at the piece of bread in her hand.<br/>I shrug half-heartedly.<br/>I don't listen to anyone but Pansy anymore. Many men talk a lot. They talk and talk and talk and I know now that words mean nothing.<br/>There have been men before that seemed to love fucking my body so much, they wanted to take me away. They've told me they'd come back and save me and keep me.<br/>No one did.<br/>I was never sure if I should be sad or relieved.<br/>Ultimately, it didn't matter.<br/>„I know. But I think this time is different,“ Pansy says.<br/>She's gotten very good at reading my face.<br/>I shake my head.<br/>She sighs again.<br/>„We'll see.“</p><p>Seeing Potter again is a shock.<br/>I mostly stare at his boots and try to block out what he says, but once, I glance up when I'm sure he's not looking.<br/>I get a glimpse of messy hair and a new pair of glasses.<br/>I wonder if he does this for revenge. I wish he'd just get on with it. If there is one thing I hate, it's waiting.<br/>Not to say I'm bad at it. I've been waiting for the past... well, couple years (I don't even know what year it is) and I've become very patient.<br/>But that doesn't mean I like it.<br/>Pansy tugs at my hand.<br/>„He has a lesson now. We should better stay upstairs.“<br/>I ascend the stairs with her and try not to be afraid. It never does anything good. Being afraid only makes everything worse. It means you suffer before you really suffer.<br/>And yet, I always am. <br/>Always waiting. <br/>I hear the front door open and then there are voices and heavy steps and I curl into a ball on the floor, press my forehead against my knees.<br/>Pansy next to me is breathing shallowly. She's afraid too.<br/>If they come in, I'll uncurl. Maybe I'll even manage a smile.<br/>Often, people prefer me over Pansy. I'm not quite sure why. Maybe it's the hair.<br/>Or maybe there are so many men that will never, ever admit they might want to fuck a guy – never, except for when they're with a whore – that they can't help but jump the opportunity.<br/>The worst thing for me is watching people hurt Pansy. <br/>It's not much worse than being in the hands of several men at once. But a little.<br/>I think I can make out Potter's voice.<br/>Steps are coming up the stairs.<br/>I stop breathing and listen.<br/>„I really need to work on that, Professor.“<br/>I count to ten.<br/>A door falls shut. No one comes up the last flight of stairs. <br/>We wait.<br/>„I think they're really hear for lessons,“ Pansy finally says.<br/>I'm not sure I believe it. <br/>Maybe they'll come in afterwards.<br/>You never know.</p><p>„How was your first day?“<br/>Both Parkinson and Malfoy seem exhausted when I find them upstairs after lessons are finished for the day.<br/>They jump when I enter the room, even though I knocked.<br/>I feel like an intruder.<br/>Parkinson catches herself and gives me a smile.<br/>„Very good, thank you.“<br/>I nod. My hands shoved in my pockets.<br/>Malfoy won't look at me.<br/>„Um, so – I won't be here for dinner, but I can order you something? Or cook. But then I'd have to go grocery shopping first. I think I'll have to do that anyway though. So – yeah. Do you want anything?“<br/>Parkinson looks at Malfoy.<br/>I've seen her take his hand before. Once, Malfoy nodded at something she said.<br/>So he listens. At least sometimes.<br/>I really want to get him to look at me.<br/>„I – I'm fine with anything,“ Parkinson says.<br/>It's rather difficult, trying to help someone that doesn't communicate what they want at all.<br/>„I could cook pasta with meatballs?“<br/>I can't read Parkinson's face when she tells me that would be very nice of me.<br/>I sigh internally.<br/>„Anything else I can get you?“<br/>Malfoy is staring at the ground. I think his lips are moving.<br/>Parkinson looks at him too.<br/>„Um, if it isn't too much trouble...“<br/>Her fingers are twitching.<br/>„Not at all,“ I say, not even knowing what she wants.<br/>„A little bit of fruit would be nice,“ she finally says.<br/>„Oh. Yeah, sure. Good idea. I'll get you some. Any preferences?“<br/>Parkinson glances at Malfoy again.<br/>So this is for him then.<br/>My question seems to have been too much. Parkinson's eyes are darting around the room, her fingers moving restlessly.<br/>„I'll just get a bit of everything,“ I say.</p><p>I'm late to my dinner with Ron and Hermoine after the bulk purchase I did.<br/>Grimmauld's kitchen is now stocked with bananas and apples and kiwis and also some sweets and a few instant meals, in case they get hungry before dinner.<br/>My pasta dish with meat balls doesn't take long, but it's still after nine PM when I finally arrive at the diner.<br/>To my surprise, Hermoine is alone.<br/>„Ron had to work,“ she explains.<br/>One look into her face has me asking: „What's wrong?“<br/>She swallows.<br/>„Let's order first.“<br/>She makes me tell her about the Slytherins and my grocery shopping before I say: „Okay, Hermoine. What's up? You look horrible.“<br/>She takes a deep breath and puts her cutlery down.<br/>„I'm pregnant.“<br/>My mouth falls open and I hastily close it, so I won't gross Hermoine out.<br/>I'm not quite sure what the appropriate reaction to these news is.<br/>„Um... wow. Okay. Did you – did you try, or...?“<br/>„Of course we didn't try. I'd have told you that.“<br/>Her fingers are shaking slightly.<br/>„Oh. Yeah. Okay, um... shit?“<br/>She laughs. Her voice trembles.<br/>„Yes.“<br/>„Does Ron know?“<br/>„Not yet.“<br/>„Okay. Um, so... how do you feel about it?“<br/>Hermoine wraps her arms around herself.<br/>„Bad.“<br/>She bites her lip.<br/>Tears are shimmering in her eyes.<br/>„Hermoine, I'm so sorry.“<br/>„Something must have gone wrong with the protection spells,“ she says, her voice breaking a little.<br/>„That happens.“<br/>„Well. It doesn't make it better.“<br/>I take a chance. <br/>„You know, if you didn't want it – I wouldn't judge you for it. It's your decision.“<br/>The tears are spilling now, leaving wet streaks on her cheeks.<br/>„Hermoine.“<br/>My heart is breaking a little and I reach for her. Pet her arm, not knowing what to do.<br/>„I can't believe this happened. And I hate – I hate thinking about it. I mean, I'm twenty-two, I should... it's not too early for kids, is it? I'm a grown woman. I just...“<br/>„It's okay not to want any,“ I say.<br/>I know that I could never. Have an abortion, that is. Not that I could get pregnant in the first place.<br/>But I also know that Hermoine doesn't want to have children. She always said she'd never want any before thirty.<br/>„I feel horrible,“ she says, hiding her face in her hands.<br/>„Don't. It's not your fault.“<br/>„It is though, isn't it? At least half of it.“<br/>I don't know what to say.<br/>„Do what you think is right.“<br/>„Nothing feels right,“ she says, voice muffled through her hands.<br/>I hesitate.<br/>„I think you should talk to Ron about it.“<br/>Hermoine sniffles and looks at the ceiling.<br/>„Ron will want to have it.“<br/>I can't object. I know he will.<br/>„You have to talk to him either way. I mean, it's your decision – but he has the right to say his opinion. And to know about it.“<br/>„I know,“ she says. „I'm just scared.“<br/>„I get it.“<br/>I squeeze her hand.<br/>„It's all going to be fine,“ I say.<br/>She swallows and gives me a watery smile.<br/>„Would you hate me? If I had an abortion.“<br/>„Of course not.“<br/>„I know you're not for it. You think it's wrong.“<br/>I think about it for a moment.<br/>„I don't think it's wrong. I think it can be right for some people and it's a very personal choice. I just know that I, personally, wouldn't want to have one. But I have issues, so,“ I shrug and smile.<br/>„How far are you?“ I ask.<br/>„Not far. Second week.“<br/>„Well, then you have time to think about it.“<br/>„Yes,“ she whispers.<br/>„It's going to be fine,“ I say.</p><p>When I get back to Grimmauld Place the next morning, I startle my new lodgers at breakfast.<br/>Parkinson drops a slice of toast and Malfoy almost chokes on a piece of kiwi.<br/>„Sorry,“ I say, grimacing.<br/>„It's fine.“<br/>But Parkinson looks faint.<br/>„Slept well?“ I ask, feeling clumsy and awkward and distracted.<br/>My best friend just told me she's pregnant.<br/>„Yes, thank you,“ Parkinson says.<br/>I look at her and suddenly realize I'm an idiot.<br/>„Oh, shit. You don't have clothes.“<br/>Why didn't Ron say anything about that?<br/>They've been wearing the same clothes since they've arrived.<br/>Malfoy and Parkinson exchange a look.<br/>Seeing that Malfoy has actually listened momentarily throws me.<br/>The look though seems alarmed to me.<br/>I'm not sure what they're thinking of, but it's certainly nothing good.<br/>„Do you maybe want to come with me? I mean – I don't really know what clothes to buy for you.“<br/>I rub my neck.<br/>There is a long pause.<br/>„I can come with you. If you like,“ Parkinson says cautiously.<br/>Malfoy is gripping the table.<br/>„Malfoy?“<br/>He doesn't seem able to meet my eyes, but at least he turns his head.<br/>After a moment, he makes to stand.<br/>My heart clenches.<br/>„You don't have to come with us. Only if you want.“<br/>He looks at Parkinson.<br/>„If you don't mind, I think... I'll pick something for Draco,“ Parkinson says.<br/>„Yeah. Sure.“</p><p>Going shopping with Pansy Parkinson makes it under the top ten of the strangest experiences of my life.<br/>At first, it's almost unbearable.<br/>She follows me and I have no fashion sense whatsoever.<br/>„Why don't you pick something?“ I ask her, on the verge of a mental breakdown.<br/>She looks at me. Her eyes are almost black and her lashes stark against her pale skin.<br/>„I don't know what you want me to pick,“ she says.<br/>It sounds like an admission.<br/>I blink at her.<br/>„I don't – you should pick whatever you like. I don't care what you're wearing.“<br/>Parkinson hesitates.<br/>I feel the need to make something clear.<br/>„You know that you don't belong to me, right? You just live with me to – because you need a place to stay. A place to heal. But I'm not... I'm just helping you. You make the decisions. If you wanted to, you could move out tomorrow.“<br/>Parkinson blinks at me. Her eyes are searching my face.<br/>„I don't have money to move out,“ she finally says.<br/>„Yeah, I know. But I could help you get a job.“<br/>She's still looking at me.<br/>„Why are you doing this?“<br/>I go for honesty.<br/>„I'm not really sure. I guess I felt bad for you. I know what it feels like not to have a home.“<br/>Parkinson frowns.<br/>„It's difficult for me to believe that you're just doing this to be nice.“<br/>I run the fabric of a shirt through my fingers.<br/>„Well, I guess it also gives me purpose. But I'm not like you. I usually don't think things through.“<br/>I try for a smile at her.<br/>The corners of her mouth twitch.<br/>„Clearly.“<br/>She turns back to the rack.<br/>„I like this one,“ she says.</p><p>I take her out to lunch when we're done.<br/>Over bowls of salad, I ask: „Why doesn't Malfoy talk?“<br/>Parkinson plays with her fork, stabbing a leaf of lettuce.<br/>„It's his way to protect himself.“<br/>„But how does not voicing his opinion protect him?“<br/>She looks up at me.<br/>„No one has cared about our opinion for years now. It's easier just not to give anything away. It's easier to shut it all out.“<br/>I swallow.<br/>„Since when is he like that?“<br/>„I'm not sure, it's hard to keep track of time. About a year?“<br/>„He hasn't talked in a year?“<br/>„I think so.“<br/>It's hard to wrap my head around it.<br/>„How is it that he's so much...“<br/>I'm looking for a word. Don't find one.<br/>„Worse than you are?“<br/>Parkinson's eyes dart at me, then away.<br/>„For one, Draco and I are different people, Potter. We deal with things differently. But Draco had it harder than me too.“<br/>She looks away.<br/>„How?“<br/>I can see the tendons in her neck.<br/>„He used to protect me. He still does, in his own way.“<br/>It takes me a moment to realize that Parkinson is fighting for composure.<br/>„If you want to talk about what happened...“<br/>She shakes her head.<br/>„I'd rather forget.“</p>
