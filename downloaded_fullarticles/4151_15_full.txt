    <p>Funny how mortals conceive mythology and magic as tell-tales to explain things they don’t understand just to entertain their minds. I envy you guys for that. I wish I could just be an ordinary lad who was either playing football, being a geek over fiction books or even getting bored on school homework (yes, I would prefer that).</p><p>            My name is Tom Williams and I am from a very different world. No, I am not an alien if that is what you would’ve asked. I am a mortal god. What is it? Well, I didn’t know that as well… before. And now, I wish I still did not know.</p><p>            To clear things up, my kind is pretty much like the demigods – which you were more familiar with. Like them, we are half-gods. The difference is the other half…</p><p>My mother was a pure old-religion sorceress, a lady bearing ancient magical powers by the use of enchantments. But she was not a witch because her kind was older than them. Her blood was clear… yes, like water and I don’t know why. (It still freaks me out especially when she accidentally cut herself with a knife when cooking.)</p><p>            And because of that, I became a half old-religion sorcerer. Which kind off messed up my body system. My blood, which was supposed to be red, was gold due to my father. (I didn’t get my mother’s blood because I am not pure anymore). And because of that, the mythical world wants me DEAD!</p><p>In my childhood years, I am innocent of the mythical world… until some ‘incidents’ happened. When I was three, I nearly destroyed our apartment at Hampshire because I made a mini cyclone in my room. My mother said that she was sleeping when a crackle of lightning woke her up. She has to open her ancient books just to drive the storms away.</p><p>I was four when another ‘incident’ happened. I was playing with some children outside our apartment when an older child made fun of me and my friends. I became angry and suddenly the boy was thrown away. My mother had to make dumb excuses just to save me from suspicious comments. And that made us leave Hampshire, sadly.</p><p>My mother told me that my first major naughty act was when I was six and we were at Windsor. My mother asked a neighbor to look after me because she would go to work as an accountant in a company. She said that she was not yet sitting on her table when she got a call. It was from my babysitter yelling at the phone that I had just made my food levitate and explode around our whole kitchen.</p><p>My mother ran on the nearest restroom and apparited (same as teleportation but it requires magic and huge concentration) straight to our house. When she came, well she just saw numerous plates as I playfully made them hover around the kitchen. My babysitter was at the hallway pointing at me with great horror.</p><p>My mom ran towards me and carried me… but a plate exploded and had cut me in my arm – revealing my blood. And that is the reason why we left another city to go to a new safer place. Why? It is because I had a golden blood.</p><p>We went to the north and came upon the Camp Phoenix at Scotland. However, I still did many things that were destructive on the camp like small storms, tiny tornadoes and some minor tsunamis. Because of that, my mother told the council my real identity… that I was a half-Greek.</p><p>My father was a Greek god, that’s what my mother had said. That is the reason why I have a golden blood (though it’s not necessarily ichor). She would not tell me anything else and I decided not to press her with questions about him because it upsets her.</p><p>Being a mortal god would have been very dangerous for me because I would attract loads of monsters but thanks to my mom, I have been safe in my first seven years. It is because she gave me a gift, and unintentionally… a curse.</p><p>When I was born, she started casting spells on me that continued until I was ten. So I am unplottable and invulnerable against any form of magic. No Olympian god and the like could hurt me using magic but they could kill me physically. That was a great gift because I can just protect myself physically using magic. And due to that, no monster could sense me, unless they see me.</p><p>But every gift has payment so I got a deadly curse in return to that kind of gift. What is the curse? Well, I have not much information about it aside from the fact that it will cause me to LOSE MY LIFE!</p><p>I could still remember the day I saw my first monster, a hellhound. I was six years old when a hellhound a size of a full-grown wolf attacked me. I know that it was a hellhound because I am being taught about Greek mythology by my mother (she would tell me that it may come in handy some time).</p><p>It has pitch black fur, piercing red eyes, razor-sharp claws and a horrible growl you could faint by just hearing it. I tried to freeze (maybe it would just get away), but it started to pounce at me.</p><p>I was defenseless that time but I tried some magic. You cannot necessarily call that magic because I didn’t say any enchantment. But during that time, whatever I wanted to do just happens. I could feel my eyes warming up every time I did anything.</p><p>As the hound jumped towards me, I willed a branch to fall towards it. It staggered backwards but jumps towards me again. I placed my back on a tree and conjured a long stick from the bushes. I then used it to hit the monster. It was hit on the nose and it howled in pain. Then it jumped on a shadow and disappeared.</p><p>I crouch as I held my chest.</p><p>“Whoa, that was close!” I exclaimed.</p><p>I was about to run home when the hound jumped out of the shadows behind me and sliced. My shield (a thin shield of air appears around me every time some deadly strikes would hit me, not all of the time though, it was an ability I got for being a mortal god) dodged it but I was thrown to the opposite tree. I willed some huge stones to fly and hit it but it just made the bloody hellhound angrier.</p><p>I shouted and the wind blew it and the hound hit a tree. But the monster seemed to be persistent. It jumped with a howl and slashed my forearm. Ichor dripped down to my hands (it’s not necessarily ichor because it could burn my mortal flesh… but I still call it like that.).</p><p>I sensed that the hellhound really wanted to eat me maybe because I am a rare delicacy. I ran towards the trees but the hound was too fast. It slashed… which would nearly cut my arm off if I wasn’t defended by the wind. I tried another telekinetic strategy but I was too weak to continue on doing offense or even defense.</p><p>I was to be sliced in to pieces when a girl with a yellow hair came to my rescue (I got a bit shy because a girl saved my life!). She slashed the monster with a bronze sword and the monster dissolved into shadows.</p><p>            “How pitiful…” She said while watching the hellhound. “I’m Kathleen by the way. Who are–”</p><p>She was shocked to see my blood. “Wha-, what is that?” She pointed at the golden blood in my arms.</p><p>“Uhmm, it’s my blood?” I said tiredly.</p><p>“WHAT!” she shouted, blood draining from her face.</p><p>“Why? Haven’t you seen any blood that isn’t colored red? My mother’s blood was clear white, like water, and the others were like–”</p><p>“You’re a mortal god!” she shouted again. Really? Can’t she just talk calmly!</p><p>“A what?” I asked.</p><p>“Your parents were a sorcerer and a god.”</p><p>“Yeah, thanks for reminding me.” I muttered.</p><p>“Oh my gods.” She said while walking back and forth. “You’re in grave danger.”</p><p>“Why would I be?”</p><p>“It’s because the monsters and the gods will hunt you down.” She said like it was very obvious.</p><p>“What? But–” Before I could ask her, a group of centaurs and sorcerers, including my mother; came running towards us.</p><p>“Oh my goodness Tom; what happened to you?” My mother said as she saw the cuts on my arms.</p><p>I told her everything including my conversation with Kathleen. She then looked at her.</p><p>“Can, can I talk to you dear?”</p><p>“O-okay.” Kathleen answered. She and my mother walked away as a centaur healed my wound.</p><p>            “It is bothering…” Vhine the Centaur said anxiously.</p><p>“What is bothering you, sir?” I asked while wincing on the centaur’s medication.</p><p>“The mythical creatures are gaining access to our lands again, young boy. And during their last visit, nothing good happened.” He said wearily.</p><p>Gaining access? That’s really bothering. You see, only magical creatures should be allowed to stay here. Our lands, Anglos as we called it, were protected by ancient magical borders that prohibit the mythical ones from entering. The last time that the mythical ones entered here, Camp Phoenix was nearly destroyed.</p><p>After tending on my wounds, Vhine said. “Promise me one thing, boy.”</p><p>“What is it Professor Vhine?” I answered.</p><p>“Promise me that you will learn well when you enter Hogwarts. I already made some preparations with the headmistress and she will entertain you as a set-in student.”</p><p>I frowned. “But I can’t understand. Why would I need to attend that school with the fact that I was still too young?”</p><p>“You need to prepare–.” Then my mother and Kathleen appeared next to me. I can see that they got some serious conversation.</p><p>I tried to ask what did they talk about but neither of them answered. My mother glared at Vhine and he went galloping with the other centaurs.</p><p>After that, Kathleen and I became friends (I guess). She said that she was a half-blood.  She has an athletic body, olive-colored skin and piercing eyes that seem to taunt whoever she looked at. Her hair seemed to be unnaturally yellow like she just colored it to hide its true hue. She was older than me by two years. She said goodbye for now and left.</p><p>As the sun sets, my mother and I went back to our cabin. It was a simple two-story cabin with a veranda over-looking to the sound of Jura. The first floor has the living room, the dining room and the kitchen. A bookshelf was standing near the stairs full of old-looking hard-bind books written in Latin and Greek. My mother would not let me read any of those but I suspect that they were books of spells.</p><p>The second floor contains two bedrooms separated by a corridor. The corridor connects the stairs straight to the veranda and the rooms were on its opposite sides.</p><p>“Mom, can-, can you tell me more about my father?” I said as my mother went to the kitchen.</p><p>“Tom, I told you. I don’t have much information about your father.” She said. I could sense uneasiness in her voice.</p><p>“Then tell me how you met him.” I said.</p><p>I’m afraid my mother would be angry (she seldom does) but she inhaled deeply and told me:</p><p>“I was, in my old village… I am wandering over the seashore when I saw you’re father. He was sitting there, with a sad look in his eyes.” My mother said as she went to the living room to sit beside me in the couch.</p><p>“He was… different from all the people I had seen.” She continued. “He has sea-green eyes, and by the way he dressed… he looked like a fisherman.”</p><p>“A fisherman?” I frowned.</p><p>She laughed. She was very beautiful when she smiled. “Yes, a fisherman. But not just a simple fisherman… the sea seems to be reflecting his mood.”</p><p>“Wh-who is he?” I asked.</p><p>But I made a great mistake. She winced.. Her emotions changed from happiness to sadness… a tear fell down from her. “We should stop from here. I would go to the kitchen–”</p><p>“But–” I tried to say.</p><p>“Stop it, Thomas!” She said it with great force I could feel her magic controlling me. “I would not want to talk about your father, sorry. It brings back sad stories and reminds me of my mistakes.”</p><p>“Mistakes? You mean I am one of those? I am a mortal god right?” I said as I started to cry.</p><p>“It’s not you… I shouldn’t have met your father–.”</p><p>“And I shouldn’t have been born.” I muttered.</p><p>My mother hugged me and both of us continued crying. “You should have been born from a different father. You should, you shouldn’t had become a mortal god.”</p><p>“Please… please tell me about myself. Why am I in danger? Why–.”</p><p>“You’re not in danger as long as you’re with me–.”</p><p>“But I will not stay here forever! I want to know everything!” I shouted.</p><p>“You’re too young… Someday you’ll know everything. But not today.” She said.</p><p>“You’re so unfair!” I shouted at her and ran for my room.</p><p>I locked door and ignored my mother as she knocked on my door. I climbed over my bed and cried.</p><p>I got a strange dream that night… and I realized after a year that it was my first demigod dream. What’s a demigod dream? It was like any other dream but it was mostly a vision of the past, present or future; or a message slash warning. Now, back to my dream:</p><p>In my dream, it was also night time… the cold winds from the Sound of Jura blew from the window… no, it was not from the sound. In fact, we’re not on a familiar room! The window is facing south towards the sea. It looked like we are residing on a place located at the south of England. The room was very different…</p><p>My mother was in her bed and she was peacefully sleeping. I tried to walk towards her and ask for an apology but I saw myself over the mirror. I was like a ghost! My body was blurred like I am made out of mist.</p><p>            I looked around and decided that this was merely a dream. Then I saw a cradle… in there, a baby with brown hair (about a year old) and Caucasian complexion was sleeping. It looked like… me! I approached the cradle and looked closely at the baby. It resembles me… only younger. Yep, it is me. Then I noticed something. A symbol was tattooed on my right arm. The symbol was composed of three spirals that joined together. It didn’t seem special maybe because I don’t remember seeing it on my own arm. Perhaps it just appeared because my mother was currently casting spells of protection for me.</p><p>            Suddenly a blinding gold light filled the room. The baby opened its eyes but my mother didn’t stir. When the light faded, a man appeared just next to the cradle. I stumbled in shock but the man didn’t seem to notice me. In fact, I guess he didn’t even see me.</p><p>            The man was dressed differently than what you could see in England. He wore leather sandals, khaki Bermuda shorts, and a shirt with coconuts and parrots all over it. His skin was deeply tanned, his hands scarred like a veteran fisherman. His hair was black and his face has a brooding look which strangely looks like mine that had always gotten me branded as a mischievous boy. He has sea-green eyes like mine. He looked like a happy fisherman.</p><p>            He approached my baby form and tickled my cheeks. My baby form laughed and I smiled. He was my father. He didn’t said anything… he just stayed there and stared at my baby form as if studying my face. After a while, he approached my mother who was hugging her sea-themed pillow. He also said nothing as if he was afraid any noise would wake her up.</p><p>            After a few seconds, he went back to the cradle and took a last look at me. Then, the golden light filled the room again and he vanished.</p><p>I woke up and wondered about that dream. Did it really happen? Has my father visited me when I was young? Where were we that time? But I didn’t want to ask my mother about it. I don’t want her to get angry at me.</p><p>A knock sounded on my door. I casted a spell to undo the lock and to let the person in (I was a half sorcerer, what could you expect?).</p><p>My mother entered with a tray of breakfast. Three layers of pancakes topped with caramel syrup and strawberry. A glass full of blue berry shake was beside it.</p><p>“A peace offering.” My mother introduced. “I hope you’ll forgive me.”</p><p>“No one will be able to remain angry to you mom.” I grinned. “Especially if you will always give them some nice pancakes.”</p><p>She smiled in relief. “Well then, time for breakfast.”</p><p> </p><p>- - - - - -</p><p> </p><p>So my days of fun as a seven year old were now over. We were just new in the camp and I don’t have much friends aside from Kathleen, Charles (my childhood friend who enrolled at camp upon my request – long story), and a few others we met during camp trainings.</p><p>My mother stayed at the camp and became a teacher and staff for the camp. The camp welcomed us with hospitality but some people regarded me ever since I stepped the camp soil. Maybe that’s because of my father’s blood gushing through my body. That made me feel like an outcast; so ever since I became a camp member, I had done my best to belong. That includes my early days of education.</p><p>I was sent to a magical school named Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry even though I’m still seven and the students there must be eleven. I could still remember the students there as they looked at me with confusion.</p><p>I was transported by a hippogryph to the railway station… it was already nighttime. I asked my mother on why can’t I just go straight to the castle but she said that it was customary for the first years to group in the station.</p><p>As I unloaded, a huge man was waiting near the railway. He was bigger than a normal full grown man but he was smaller than a giant. He has a dark hair and moustache that covers most of his face. He wore a dark brown coat, a huge one.</p><p>“Hey! Are ye missin’ lad?” The man said.</p><p>“No, no sir.” I answered. “I, uhm, I am a first year–.”</p><p>“A firs’ year!” The man stood and I backed away.</p><p>I stumbled over the snow. The man reached out his huge hand.</p><p>“I’m not gonna ‘urtyer.” He said. “Yer just too young to be a firs year.” His eyes widened. “Unless… are ye the set-in student?”</p><p>I reached for his arm to stand up. “Yes sir. This is Mr. Aaron’s note.”</p><p>I handed him a parchment with the seal of the camp. The man reached for it but he didn’t open the letter. Then, he smiled at me.</p><p>“Then welcome te Hogwarts! I’m Rubeus Hagrid by the way; Keeper of the keys and the Care for Magical Creatures teacher.”</p><p>A siren wailed from the south of the track. “Oh, the students are here!” Hagrid clapped and put out his light.</p><p>The train stopped and the students went out of the train named Hogwarts Express. They were in assorted sizes but all of them were wearing gray witch or wizard uniform. I’m not yet wearing that uniform but I had it in my trunk.</p><p>The day before, Mr. Aaron and I went to the Diagon Alley (magical market) in London to buy my stuffs for the ‘early’ education. I’ve got a wand from the Ollivander’s: Mahogany with Phoenix feather core, thirteen inches.</p><p>Hagrid started to shout “Firs years! Go over here Firs years!”</p><p>Hagrid led us to a lake and made us ride on a series of small boats, where we’re made to ride in pairs. As we sail towards the castle, I gasped in awe.</p><p>A collection of very huge castles stood on the other side of the lake. They were medieval types of castle but the structure was so huge it seemed impossible to exist. Huge, tall towers stood proudly at every minor castle. It was like the Windsor Castle which was enlarged in about five times.</p><p>As we enter, we were welcomed by a professor. She was old but elegant. She was wearing a grayish witch robe and a pair of spectacles. Her hair was tied in a tight ponytail.</p><p>“Welcome to Hogwarts.” The professor said. “Now, in a few moments we’ll pass through these doors and you could join your classmates.” She pointed at two huge doors made of metal.</p><p>“But before you could take your seats, you must be sorted into your houses.” She continued. “They are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw and Slytherin. Now while you’re here, your house will be like your family. Your triumphs will earn you points, any rule-breaking and you will lose points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup. The sorting ceremony will begin momentarily.” She said and she left for the doors.</p><p>The children around me start to murmur with excitement.</p><p>“I bet I would be in Hufflepuff!” squealed a boy with blond hair.</p><p>“I wanna be a Ravenclaw. My mother was there when she was a student.” A girl said to some of the other first year girls.</p><p>“Slytherin is the best you know!” shouted the boy with dark curly hair. “Only the pure ones stay there… the true magical people.”</p><p>Everyone stared at him.</p><p>“I’m gonna be there while those unpure will be on the lesser houses.” He exclaimed.</p><p>“Yeah?! Gryffindor is the house of heroes. We all know that those who defeated the Dark Lord came from that house.” A boy with a red hair mocked.</p><p>The curly lad tried to charge at the red-haired so I tried to stop them. I felt my eyes heat up as the curly lad bumped into something invisible. He staggered backwards and became momentarily confused. The other children laughed as the female professor reentered from the same doors. She eyed us suspiciously.</p><p>“We were ready for you. Now, form a line and the sorting ceremony will start.” She said.</p><p>We formed two lines. As we entered the vast room ahead, the professor looked at me intently.</p><p>The room was so awesome. Four huge tables line the center of the hall and a smaller table was in the other end. The ceiling seems to be enchanted because it looked like the skies outside. The illumination on the hall was candles.</p><p>On each of the huge, long tables sat students with the same type of uniform – except that their neck ties’ linings were of different colors. The students of the leftmost has a green tie; to their right, children with blue ties chat together while reading books; to the right of those were students with red ties; and on the rightmost were those wearing yellow ties.</p><p>We arrived in front of the smaller table. Sitting there must be the teachers. In the middle, which must be the seat of the Headmistress, sat an old looking female wearing emerald-green witch robes. She has a pair of spectacles that seems to make her look stern.. She stood up and the hall was silenced.</p><p>“The sorting ceremony will now start.” She said.</p><p>The woman who orientated us reentered from the doors beside the table. She was carrying a huge roll of parchment and an old brown hat.</p><p>“I’ll be reading your name and then you’ll sit on this… stool.”</p><p>She flicked her wand and a simple wooden stool appeared. Many students behind me gasped in awe. I was not shocked about it considering that my mother was magical as well. She started to call the first student.</p><p>“Aggron, Kristoff!” She shouted.</p><p>A boy taller than me with blond hair moved forward. He sat on the table and the female teacher put the old hat on his head. The hat was too big for him that it also covered half of his face. It seems very silly for him to wear the hat. What’sgonna happen to the hat? Will it shot out colors or send out images of the houses? Then the hat shouted! Yeah, it’s silly but it really shouted.</p><p>“HUFFLEPUFF!” The hat exclaimed.</p><p>The table with yellow tie burst into claps and cheers. So that’s it! The hat will shout the name of the house. All I need is to wait for my turn. I wish I could be anywhere except Slytherin. The house seems evil.</p><p>The name of students came on and on. The hat took various amount of time per child… but eventually he’ll pass a judgment. But what if he didn’t give me a house? I am too young to be in the school.</p><p>After the girl named ‘Wilford, Jasmin’ who was placed on Slytherin, I was called.</p><p>“Williams, Thomas Demetrius.” The professor said.</p><p>I heard a few snickers on the green tie table as I walk towards the stool. A murmur started to ring from the other tables. I heard some <em>‘He’s too young!’</em> and <em>‘A Greek!’</em> from the students. Across the main table, the professor stood to get a better look at me. The woman put the hat on me and darkness invades my sight. A voice came from the hat into my head:</p><p>“Interesting… you’re too young to become a wizard.” The hat said.</p><p>“Yeah, everyone says that.” I thought.</p><p>“You’d caused so much mischief you could be a Gryffindor or a Slytherin!” It exclaimed. “But your wits, your virtues… you could be in any house.”</p><p>“Please not Slytherin.” I muttered.</p><p>“Ah, but you could be great! The house will be able to help you. But your heart… yes, your heart.” He whispered.</p><p>“What’s with my heart?” I asked.</p><p>“You have more than enough knowledge about sorcery. You were not a wizard.” The hat said. “You will learn well in this school but you will not be able to use your wand often.”</p><p>“What? I, I don’t understand!” I thought. “I am not a wizard?!”</p><p>But he did not answer. Instead, he shouted “GRYFFINDOR!” and the hat was taken off from me.</p><p>After that, the table with red tie cheered. Then I felt a strange fright. Now, I need to prepare for my future here… a future that I doesn’t even know.</p><p> </p><p>- - - - - -</p><p> </p><p>That seems to be the most relevant parts of my history that I could tell you for now… so let’s get to the present.</p><p>I was now ten years old and I could say that I am now good in doing magic. I could now influence elements especially water and wind.</p><p>I learned well in my magic school. However, it seemed that wizardry is not the right course for me. My teachers and some of my classmates would often notice that I am not using my wand in performing magic… in fact; I am not even chanting any spells! The magic goes the way I wanted it to happen… like I was born to do magic, not learn it.</p><p>I was now a fifth year at Hogwarts… but I guess I’ll need to leave the school now. I went to the school office in the morning to talk to our headmistress.</p><p>The office was located at one of the towers of the school. In order to get there, you need to talk to a statue. Yeah, it’s kind of weird but this is my world.</p><p>The statue was a standing hippogryph with its wings curved as if ascending for flight. I started to say some words for it. You see, the whole school was made where some restricted areas require passwords; like the four houses and some faculty offices… including the headmistress’ office.</p><p>“Uhmm, FELIS?” I said but nothing happened. “LEMON DROP! Oh, screw it Alohomora!?”</p><p>“I believe its DUMBLEDORE.” A woman spoke behind me.</p><p>The statue sprang to life. It jumped aside and the wall behind it split open to reveal a stairway. The stairway was circular and elegant… and it was slowly moving upward like an escalator!</p><p>“What can I do for you Mr. Williams?” The headmistress said as we stepped on the stairs and waited to be lifted to her office.</p><p>A set of doors were located on the top.. “Uhm, Professor McGonagall; I just brought a letter to drop out of my class. I believe my mother has told you about the matter earlier, miss?”</p><p>“Yes, but I still did not understand why you should drop out of your course. Two more years and you would graduate.” Professor McGonagall said as she opened the doors.</p><p>A huge office welcomed us. I gasp in awe as I see the office. Picture of people was hanged on the walls. They were… moving! Who, who are they?</p><p>“Tom, meet the former headmasters and headmistresses of Hogwarts.” She said like she knew what I was thinking. “And there, was the head before me… Professor Albus Dumbledore.”</p><p>A man with gray hair and moustache was moving over a portrait. He has moon-shaped spectacles and was wearing a gray wizard robe. His frame was larger than the others and was located over the center of the room. He smiled at me and waved.</p><p>A wardrobe was located on a corner with a silver disc located beside it. A round table containing a tea and knitting set was placed by the fire connected to a chimney that snaked its way up. Bookshelves were placed around the room.</p><p>“State your reasons…” Professor McGonagall said as she sits on her table.</p><p>“It’s hard for me to decide, professor but… I really feel that I don’t belong. My magical skills are not for a wizard course. My mother and a lot of my friends said that to me.” I said.</p><p>“Ah, yes. I had observed you since you were a first year. You were exceptional in spells… but you seldom use your wand to do that.” She said as she sets up some tea.</p><p>She’s right. During my early years at Hogwarts, I was able to pass every semester without using my wand. My head seems to be hard-wired to use Latin spells – those spells that are used during the Mid-religion. I could also use Old-religion spells but my mother strictly orders me to not cast it… ever. The reason? Using it could consume my life. (Remember my curse? It’s connected with this)</p><p>“You seldom use any spells in charms, curse and transfiguration classes… it, just happens and your eyes glow! You seem to know the magic deep within you that you did not need to cast a spell to do magic… and if you need a spell, it was not what we had thought you – they’re old spells.” Professor McGonagall continued.</p><p>“My mother was an old-religion sorceress. She uses ancient magic. She said that I was using Mid-religion spells.” I said.</p><p>“Mid-religion? Those are the spells before ours. They’re not specific spells… they’re merely commands. Your way of magic came from a very old kind.” She said.</p><p>“Yes ma’am. My mother said that we are descendants of the older magical people.” I explained.</p><p>“Very well… I would seek the presence of the Minister to give you a diploma. But you will miss advance magic lessons. You haven’t tested for Apparition yet.” She said.</p><p>“I’m sure that I could learn more with my mom. She knows the nature of our kind.” I said.</p><p>I left the room thinking very deeply. Are we the only ones that could enchant using old spells in this camp? Are, are we extinct? But I did not mind it yet. Now that I dropped out of my school days, I could focus on the army. It would be essential… with the fact that the camp was being confronted by mythical creatures again.</p><p> </p><p>            I was on our house when an owl came over the window. It was carrying a message from the Phoenix Army. They are summoning me for a meeting!? I kissed my mom goodbye and left the house.</p><p>I guess I need to explain this. During my third year, I read about a group of students in the Hogwarts history that had built an organization who protected the school during the Second Wizarding War. It was called Dumbledore’s army. I was caught up with that as a great idea, and with the monsters started assaulting the camp… I started to campaign for an army of my own.</p><p>At first, the camp council did not take the concept seriously (but I continued it anyway). My friends supported me and they pledged allegiance to the army and we called it Phoenix Army. As days went through, our group (with just six of us) protected the camp and its inhabitants from mythical and magical monsters. Some of my classmates from Hogwarts then came and taught us dueling tactics and spells, hexes and curses. We undergone trainings and gained experiences from the older Hogwarts students.</p><p>With our training and new knowledge in magic, we are able to control the external attacks of monsters from outside the camp. And when I had graduated from the third year, the camp blessed the Army to officially protect the camp.</p><p>Because of that, I earned the respect of the camp. I am no longer <em>the Greek</em> but the Marshal of the Phoenix Army… an eight year old that has the ability of an of-age soldier.</p><p> </p><p>The Phoenix Army has a building beside the Main house of the camp. It was a one story building adorned by Greek columns. The flag of the camp and the Phoenix Army banner were displayed on the front roof.</p><p>The inside was like a session hall for the knights of the ancient Camelot. A huge circular table made of marble stood in the middle. The coat of arms of the army was engraved on the center and holes the size of a penny dotted on the sides.</p><p>The walls of the room were filled with maps of England, Scotland, the camp and Anglos. The wall opposite the doorway was adorned by the banners of the four main cabins in the camp.</p><p>On the table sat all the officials of the Army… and I am their Marshal. There are only six officials on the army with fourteen members. We maybe small in number but we are skilled sorcerers.</p><p>The officers were ordered where the Field Marshal sits on the part of the table facing the banners. From there, the other officers will sit on clockwise manner from the higher official to the lower.</p><p>As I enter the room, all the officers stand and saluted. I ordered them to ease and we started the meeting.</p><p>“Any major problem?” I asked to everyone.</p><p>“Multiple reports on dementor’s attacks arrived yesterday. A few mythological creatures were spotted around the camp’s borders. A hydra attack was reported to have destroyed a caravan exiting our borders last week.” Joanna San said. She was the Territory Officer tasked with the border patrols.</p><p>“Disturbing… are there reports from the borders of Anglos?” I asked.</p><p>The council shifted on their seats. My general stood up.</p><p>“Whoa. You mean Anglos is opening up for the East and West again?” Charles Finnigan asked.</p><p>“We’re not yet sure… and the Camp Council won’t tell us. They’re saying that we’re too young to know this matter. We are only allowed to take authority over the camp.” I explained.</p><p>“Well, there is news on the Daily Prophet about oriental dragons attacking nearby buildings in the Anglic French border.” Joanna said.</p><p> </p><p>I need to explain this again. Anglos was a magic-protected territory under the influence of Lord Angle – a Greek/Celtic god (long story). The territory covers the whole United Kingdom, some parts of the Atlantic Ocean, half of France, Spain and Portugal, the English Channel, Belgium, and The Netherlands. It was off-limits from any mythical creature from the outside.</p><p>When the Anglos opened up for the East and West in the past, a huge devastating war occurred. During that age, mythical creatures from Greeks to Romans to Asian ones struck our kingdom and many sorcerers were killed. It happened during World War II and the mortals thought that the attackers were the Nazi troops from Germany. But the point is, whenever Anglos’s barriers open up… it’s going to be horrible.</p><p> </p><p>“I see… if the kingdom is opening again–.” Charles said.</p><p>The whole room filled with murmurs of fear and worry.</p><p>“Whoa, guys. It can’t be happening. The barriers are closed for years. Besides, our patron god will not permit our kind’s deaths again.” I said.</p><p>“But still, I moved that we patrol the borders… not just the camp’s borders but also the borders of the kingdom.” Gabriel Crust, my Brigadier, said worriedly.</p><p>“We can’t… the Camp Council might disband us. We must notify the Ministry about this, I guess.” I said.</p><p>“They already knew. That’s why they’d dispatched the dementors but those foul creatures kept on attacking the wrong persons… us. Honestly, why hadn’t they disposed those creatures yet? They are <em>dark</em> creatures!” Eleana Greene said angrily. She was my Colonel.</p><p>“Then we have no choice… we are only allowed to scout the camp’s borders.” I said.</p><p>“But, marshal!” Charles said. “How about the kingdom’s borders?”</p><p>“I believe that it was being protected by the Ministry of Magic.” Our leader intercepted as he enters the room. “And you may forget it but… there are still the five Carlyle’s with their armies.”</p><p>We stood up and saluted at him. He ordered us to sit as he continued talking.</p><p>“The kingdom’s boundaries are out of your authority. The Camp Council will not allow any operation outside the camp. I could only allow you to scout our territory. There are already many threats here that you could stop.” He explained.</p><p>            “I suppose that you will not tell us the details.” I said. “About the current state of the borders?”</p><p>            “It is forbidden for you to know. You’re not yet of right age.” He said.</p><p>            “Very well. Then, we’ll do our best to scout the camp. Officers, adjourn.” I said and my officers left the room.</p><p>            I and the leader were left inside. He walked around the room… studying the maps.</p><p> </p><p>            “I still felt like you children were not from this world,” Mr. Aaron said. “A bunch of ten year old kids being soldiers of the camp and, humiliatingly, much more successful in protecting it than us adults.”</p><p>            “Well, we’re not in a normal world.” I answered. “We need to be like this or else, we’ll never survive what’s out there.”</p><p>            “You’re turning eleven. The time is so fast.” He remarked.</p><p>            “I still don’t understand why you and my mother ordered me to drop out of school. Being a sorcerer is not the only reason.” I said.</p><p>            “I suppose I am not the right person that should explain things to you. But when the right time comes, you’ll understand.” He explained.</p>
