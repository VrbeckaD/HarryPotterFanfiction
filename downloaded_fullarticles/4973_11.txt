    <p><b>SOMETIMES, VICTOIRE WOULD WONDER </b>exactly how her life turned out to be like this. She was a talented witch, one who could almost rival her Aunt Hermione’s skills, and almost everyone who knew her wanted her to try her hand at the field of expertise they were in. Back in her prime days at Hogwarts, she was a Prefect, a Seeker in their House team, and she was a Head Girl, but it was really her outstanding grades that had everyone pressed since day one.</p><p>           People would claim that Victoire was a perfect human being, practically flawless as she traipsed through life at Hogwarts freely with a huge grin on her face while dragging a bulk of her achievements with her.</p><p>           Little did they know that the carefree, sunshine, Victoire Weasley would end up living a dull life sometime in the near future. With all the things she knew how to do, she never really know what she <em> wanted </em>to do for the rest of her life.</p><p>           Maybe that was how she ended up getting thrown into being the secretary of one of the lawyers in a magical law firm. Their office was somewhere in Diagon Alley, safely nestled between Gringotts and a bakery. Victoire wasn’t impressed with how her life turned out. She wanted more, but couldn’t find herself doing anything about it.</p><p>           It was mediocrity at its finest. A form of ritualism wherein she wakes up every morning, ties her hair up and ensures that she looks presentable enough, she goes to work and answers calls and finishes up schedules for her boss. It was a never-ending cycle of Victoire succumbing to her definition of the “norms”.</p><p>          A boy never came her way. There were a few guys who tried to get to know her, but she assumed they just left because she wasn’t really interesting enough. They probably would have preferred Victoire in her golden years (the Ravenclaw school girl who could do almost everything) than the Victoire who was nothing more than a boring girl who goes to work and goes home, nothing more.</p><p>           “You’re still young. There’s so much more time to decide on what you want to do in life.” Her grandmother told her during that one night where she went home to the Burrow, drunk off her arse and moping about a quarter-life crisis that she doesn’t know how to fix.</p><p>           There’s a newfound rage in her chest that she wanted to direct at her seventeen-year-old self because how dare she think that she had all the answers? How dare she think that she could grab life by the neck and take on it like a pro? She knew absolutely nothing! A bitter laugh formed at the base of her throat as she scrolled her Facebook feed for what seemed to be the hundredth time today.</p><p>           Hell the mediocrity is starting to annoy her even more as she tossed her phone on her desk with a matching scowl on her face. This form of ritualism got so bad that she didn’t even know what to search for in the world wide web anymore.</p><p>           Her life was going downhill and she has absolutely no idea where to look for answers.</p><p>           A vivid memory of her best friend getting married in the coast of Spain made her throw up the day’s lunch internally. They’re getting married and here she was, sitting in a secretary’s desk making someone else’s schedule instead of her <em> own, </em>how pathetic could she be?</p><p>           For all she knew, she could be the one who’s fighting for people’s rights instead of her stuck-up boss. She could be the one who gets to boss her own secretary around, but then that thought nauseated her as well. She has absolutely no idea what she wanted to do and she ran out of every single idea that could possibly fix this quarter life crisis.</p><p>           She’d be lying if she said she didn’t think that a road trip could solve all of this. In fact, she was so close to getting inside her goddamn car right now and driving off to god knows where. But then she couldn’t exactly do that either because believe it or not this job has a really great pay and all her bills are paid off without a single sweat.</p><p>           The cost of it, however, was the fact that she wasn’t really enjoying this. She wanted so much more from life and doesn’t even know when to start.</p><p>           A tapping sound was heard from the window and her eyes met the wild gaze of Teddy Lupin. Normally, she wouldn’t let him in the office if she knew that he didn’t really have anything else to do other than talk her ears off, but it was boring, and she was desperate. Victoire hauled her arse out of her swivel chair and swiftly opened the door to the main entrance.</p><p>           Teddy was wild as always. He was a free spirit, always obeying what his heart wanted and he would go out of his way to make sure that he got to where he wanted. Traits that Victoire desperately wanted to have. He was a reflection of who she was before she turned into this mediocre secretary who scrolls through her Facebook feed way too much.</p><p>           One would think that her Facebook feed was empty, but no, in fact, the goddamn social networking site had a lot of her friends bragging about their newfound promotion, or their brand new house, or car, or getting married, or having children.</p><p>           It made her think about what she was possibly missing out on. Children? Getting married? A brand new house? One that’s not her overly pink apartment in the heart of London? It all seemed too surreal and practically fake as she went through each idea in her head.</p><p>           “You look bored, I decided I’d stop by.” He winked as he placed his coat on the coat rack by the door. Her boss knew Teddy, and her boss wasn’t even here so why was she even worrying?</p><p>           “Save me.” She jokingly whispered as she took a seat on her swivel chair while Teddy just so casually took a seat on her table filled with boring paperwork.</p><p>           “Victoire, Sweetheart, you need to live.” He laughed, and a loud laugh echoed from Victoire because oh god how she agreed to him so much.</p><p>           “How do I even pluck myself out of this boring shithole?” The blonde sighed as her forehead collided gently with the mahogany table.</p><p>           If Teddy was going through the same thing as she was, then damn he was doing so well at covering up. But then again, Victoire doubted it. Teddy always had everything figured out, he knew what to do and was always quick to come up with a contingency plan. She has no idea when she will ever have the guts to do something like that. Her seventeen-year-old self would have thought better, but that’s the thing, she’s already twenty four and was still stuck in an impasse. It sucked.</p><p>           “When was the last time you actually went out for fun?” Teddy raised his eyebrow, bright brown eyes staring deep into her blue oculars.</p><p>           Victoire’s head tilted, and that was enough to answer Teddy’s question.</p><p>           “That’s it, you’re going out with me tonight.” He declared.</p><p>           “You mean, on a date?” She inquired, and immediately regretted it as soon as the words left her lips. Teddy had always been her best friend, and yes she may still have a crush on him after all the years that went pass, but she couldn’t really blame herself right? Teddy was a fine man who has all of his priorities in check and has his entire life mapped out. It didn’t stray from her thoughts that he knew her inside and out as well.</p><p>           Great. She was stuck on an impasse and she couldn’t get over this silly school girl crush she has on Teddy.</p><p>           “Yes it’s a date. Look pretty, not that you don’t always do.” He chuckled and she glared at him as her cheeks reddened. A completely childish reaction to an offer she found that she had been waiting for all her life.</p><p> </p>
