    <p class="western"> “Anything you can do, I can do just as good.”</p>
<p class="western">
  <br/><br/></p>
<p class="western">Sherlock scoffed at the girl who stood in front of him with her hands on her hips. His parents had forced him to come to the dentist's office with them and they were both inside with the dentists. When they had entered his eyes had fallen on the little girl who was curled up in one of the armchairs reading a book. He knew instantly that she was the dentist's daughter.</p>
<p class="western">
  <br/><br/></p>
<p class="western">After his parents' had gone in, he sat on the couch and watched the TV, bored, switching through the channels as he solved all the plots in seconds. After surfing through all the shows, he turned to the girl who was biting her fingernail as her eyes skimmed the book. She could barely be over nine years old, and she was reading A Tale of Two Cities. He had then told her that the book was boring and they had gotten into an argument which led then led to who was better.</p>
<p class="western">
  <br/><br/></p>
<p class="western">“You can't deduce though.” He pointed out snobbishly.</p>
<p class="western">
  <br/><br/></p>
<p class="western">“Sure I can.”</p>
<p class="western">
  <br/><br/></p>
<p class="western">“Prove it.” He replied childishly.</p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">The girl turned to him and looked him over.</p>
<p class="western">
  <br/><br/></p>
<p class="western">“You come from a rich family judging by your clothes. You have an older sibling or two I'm guessing from your attitude. You skipped a grade or two because you're smart and you're often bored so you like to do experiments because you're good at science. You also play something with the strings, probably the violin. I could tell that from your hands.” She turned up her nose and smirked. Sherlock was annoyingly impressed. He turned away from her and watched the TV again, determined to ignore her, but she stood up and sat down next to him on the couch.</p>
<p class="western">
  <br/><br/></p>
<p class="western">“Admit it. I can deduce almost as good as you.” She smiled happily, crossing her arms.</p>
<p class="western">
  <br/><br/></p>
<p class="western">“You're decent.” He muttered, mirroring Mycroft's words to him.</p>
<p class="western">
  <br/><br/></p>
<p class="western">“Oh, come on. We both know I did pretty good. What about you? Let's see you deduce.”</p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">He turned to her then to the TV.</p>
<p class="western">
  <br/><br/></p>
<p class="western">“The woman is about to divorce with her husband and judging by her necklace she has a lover who comes from the poor side of town and saved up all that money to get her the necklace from a thrift shop. Her sister is having an affair with the husband who killed his father for money.” Sherlock deduced easily and the bushy haired girl looked at him in awe.</p>
<p class="western">
  <br/><br/></p>
<p class="western">“That's amazing!” She laughed. “I've seen this show fifty times and that's exactly what happens. You're a genius! My name is Hermione Granger.” She stuck out her hand and he shook it with a confused tilt of his head.</p>
<p class="western">
  <br/><br/></p>
<p class="western">“Sherlock Holmes. That's not what people usually say.” He admits.</p>
<p class="western">
  <br/><br/></p>
<p class="western">“What do they usually say?”</p>
<p class="western">
  <br/><br/></p>
<p class="western">“Piss off.”</p>
<p class="western">
  <br/><br/></p>
<p class="western">Hermione looked at him understandingly.</p>
<p class="western">
  <br/><br/></p>
<p class="western">“They tell me that all the time too in school. I'm the smartest in my class and people usually don't like me because of that. I think it's rude but I know they won't stop.” She shrugged then turned to him. “You know what, we can just piss off together. We're friends now... right?”</p>
<p class="western">
  <br/><br/></p>
<p class="western">He looked at her with bewildered eyes but slowly nodded his head.</p>
<p class="western">
  <br/><br/></p>
<p class="western">“Yes. We can be friends.”</p>
<p class="western">
  <br/><br/></p>
<p class="western">They both stayed silent for a moment longer not knowing what to say. Sherlock took the chance to look over her one more time. She had wild bushy brown hair and bright brown eyes with buck teeth. The closest thing he had ever seen that resembled her was a beaver.</p>
<p class="western">
  <br/><br/></p>
<p class="western">“You have a strange name. Sherlock.” Hermione said, breaking the silence.</p>
<p class="western">
  <br/><br/></p>
<p class="western">“You do too. Hermione isn't a common name.”</p>
<p class="western">
  <br/><br/></p>
<p class="western">“True.”</p>
<p class="western">
  <br/><br/></p>
<p class="western">“What do you want to be when you grow up?” Sherlock asked as he swung his feet on the chair. He wasn't sure how to go around this friend thing, but he had seen a few of his classmates interact.</p>
<p class="western">
  <br/><br/></p>
<p class="western">“I want to be a writer.” She replied happily. “I love fantasy novels and how they make you go to different worlds. What do you want to be?”</p>
<p class="western">
  <br/><br/></p>
<p class="western">“A pirate.” He replied smugly.</p>
<p class="western">
  <br/><br/></p>
<p class="western">“Really?” She laughed and he found himself liking it more every time he heard it. Before he knew what was happening, he felt himself laughing.</p>
<p class="western">
  <br/><br/></p>
<p class="western">“Maybe you could take me with you, and I could write about all the places we visit.”</p>
<p class="western">
  <br/><br/></p>
<p class="western">“That's what friends do, right?” Sherlock asked, smiling. “Would you like to be my first mate?”</p>
<p class="western">
  <br/><br/></p>
<p class="western">“Yes.” Hermione replied, no doubt evident in her voice.</p>
<p class="western">
  <br/><br/></p>
<p class="western">The door to the dentist's office opened and both of their parents' stepped out. They looked incredulously at the two kids who were smiling at each other conspiratorially. Sherlock was the first to stand up and he took Hermione's hand and showed it to them.</p>
<p class="western">
  <br/><br/></p>
<p class="western">“Mum, I've made a friend. Her name is Hermione Granger, and she's going to go with me as my first mate of my pirate ship. She'll write about all the adventures we have. Can she come over sometime?”</p>
<p class="western">
  <br/><br/></p>
<p class="western">Sherlock's mom looked incredulously at her husband and at the dentists who seemed to be equally shocked.</p>
<p class="western">
  <br/><br/></p>
<p class="western">“Mum, dad, this is Sherlock Holmes. He's my new best friend, and we should invite him over sometime. No, we <em>have </em> to invite him over.”</p>
<p class="western">
  <br/><br/></p>
<p class="western">“Of course, dear. If that's alright with you?” Jean Granger turned to the Holmes' parents and they nodded immediately.</p>
<p class="western">
  <br/><br/></p>
<p class="western">The kids squeezed each other's hands then went back to the seating area, leaving their befuddled parents by themselves.</p>
<p class="western">
  <br/><br/></p>
<p class="western">“He's never made friends like that.” Sarah Holmes admitted to Grangers.</p>
<p class="western">
  <br/><br/></p>
<p class="western">“Hermione can make friends easily, but she's never been this enthusiastic.” The other parents' revealed, laughing.</p>
<p class="western">
  <br/><br/></p>
<p class="western">“Well, are you free this Thursday afternoon?” Richard Granger asked, taking out his pocket calender.</p>
<p class="western">
  <br/><br/></p>
<p class="western">“Yes. You should come to our house first.” Timothy Holmes insisted. “We always have more food than we know what to do with, and this is the first friend Sherlock has ever introduced to us.”</p>
<p class="western">
  <br/><br/></p>
<p class="western">The parents' exchanged addresses and phone numbers, looking at the kids from the corner of their eyes. The two were sitting side by side on the couch, talking quickly and excitedly.</p>
<p class="western">
  <br/><br/></p>
<p class="western">Who knew what would come from this friendship.</p>
<p class="western">
  <br/><br/></p>
