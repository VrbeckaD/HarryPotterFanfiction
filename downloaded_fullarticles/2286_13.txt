    <p>Amelia Bones inwardly groaned when she received her secretary’s message. It was almost time for her to go home and she was looking forward to taking a long, hot bath. She desperately needed her well-deserved day off after the hellish week she just went through but of course, hoping to finish on time today would have been too much to ask.</p><p> </p><p>On her desk sat the paperwork Minister Fudge generated when he ordered Bartemius Crouch Junior’s execution on the grounds of Hogwarts without due process. Next to it, the <em>Daily Prophet</em>, unread, reported Cedric Diggory’s funeral on its front page. Amelia had no desire to subject herself to Rita Skeeter’s drivel, not after attending said funeral and having to console her distressed niece. It had been a long time since such a tragic event happened so publicly.</p><p> </p><p>Amos Diggory visited her office daily: a broken man who demanded to know why no one spoke about You-Know-Who’s return. She understood his plea but she had not seen proof of his revival herself. She was not so convinced. This did not mean she approved of the way the <em>Daily Prophet</em> and Minister Fudge reacted: seeing Harry Potter treated so horribly in the paper turned her stomach. Unfortunately, she had to be careful, and couldn’t speak out: if Potter had been truthful, their world was on the brink of war, and she held a position that would prove invaluable. She couldn’t afford to lose it. Cornelius' only goal in life was to keep the public’s approval and she wouldn’t put it past him to bury his head in the sand too deep. So, she kept her mouth shut, but her eyes wide open.</p><p> </p><p>She sent a reply to her secretary and waited for her visitor. She was so certain it would be Amos, that she briefly lost her usual composure at the sight of the woman who stepped into her office. There, regal and beautiful as always, stood Narcissa Malfoy.</p><p> </p><p>She was dressed in elegant black robes etched with silver and gold. Her hair was pinned in an elaborate crown, emeralds gleaming between her blond strands. Looking closely however revealed barely contained emotion brewing under her usual impassive gaze.</p><p> </p><p>“Madam Bones, I trust no one can eavesdrop?”</p><p> </p><p>Amelia proved it by casting her usual charms around the room, then nodded and offered her a seat.</p><p> </p><p>“Madam Malfoy, what can I do for you?”</p><p> </p><p>“We need your help.”</p><p> </p><p>A piece of parchment, hidden within Narcissa’s robes, made its way into Amelia’s hands. She frowned slightly and read:</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Millicent Bulstrode, Astoria Greengrass, Daphne Greengrass, Draco Malfoy, Theodore Nott, Blaise Zabini </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Emmeline Bulstrode, Nathan Greengrass, Narcissa Malfoy on behalf of Draco Malfoy and Theodore Nott, Isabella Zabini </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Narcissa volunteered an explanation before Amelia could speak:</p><p> </p><p>“We wish to save our children from a life of servitude,” she started. “They need an escape, and they require protection. Mister Potter spoke the truth.”</p><p> </p><p>Amelia stiffened, yet she wasn’t surprised. And if high profile Pureblood children sought sanctuary, she would not let them down. However, she had reservations.</p><p> </p><p>“Why not leave the country with your families?”</p><p> </p><p>“The parents I did not list need to be kept in the dark. It is vital that they do not have any way to find them.”</p><p> </p><p>“What about Theodore Nott? He only has one living relative I believe. Emerick Nott would report it as kidnapping.”</p><p> </p><p>“They all will,” Narcissa replied, her tone unchanged. “But Theodore came to me. I am his godmother. I would do anything for him, and for my son.”</p><p> </p><p>“Forgive me for asking, but how can we be certain that none of them wishes to take the Mark?”</p><p> </p><p>A flinch, subtle but unmistakable, shook the blond woman’s hands.</p><p> </p><p>“Draco’s only wish was to make his father proud. He espoused his views until he realised what it meant. Nothing was concrete until the Diggory boy’s death. My son never truly wished harm on anyone, he was merely a child imitating what he had always seen and heard. He has questioned our so-called supremacy since he was thirteen, but was wise enough to keep on pretending.”</p><p> </p><p>Amelia thought about her own childish beliefs, about those who fought on the wrong side of the past war yet realised their mistakes. She did not ask what Narcissa herself thought. Unlike Dumbledore, she didn’t believe in second chances so easily, but a child maturing and changing their mind, rebelling against their upbringing, was such a common occurrence that she couldn’t ignore Narcissa’s request.   </p><p> </p><p>“I’ll find someplace safe.” She sipped her tea. “However, they will have to leave the country.”</p><p> </p><p>It was too risky to keep them within the borders: finding a blood relative who resided within a certain perimeter would be a piece of cake for any of these old families if they turned to blood magic.</p><p> </p><p>Narcissa stood up. “I am aware. I will be in touch. I fear we have little time, and I would like to think I can trust you to make it so no one can track them.”</p><p> </p><p>Amelia walked her to the door, nodding, and watched her leave. So much for a relaxing bath this evening: she would not let these teenagers fall into the hands of a monster.</p><p> </p><p>Only three days later, a dragon Patronus appeared in her office, and her blood froze.</p><p> </p><p>
