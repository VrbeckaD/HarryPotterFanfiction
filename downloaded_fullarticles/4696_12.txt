          <div class="userstuff"><p>“Ginny…” I roll over to my side and slowly open my eyes. Luna’s beautiful grey/blue eyes are staring back at me. Luna’s eyes always have a warm look to them. No, her whole face does. Her face has a soft, comforting glow. Her waist length daffodil colored hair is wavy and knotted.</p><p>“Wake up Ginny, no-one can see you when you go back to the Gryffindor dorm.” She smiles. That smile is what I live for. She smiles like the sun. I sit up slowly and pull on my shirt and robe. “Okay, Luna.” I reply. “I’ll see you at breakfast.” I stand up and tiptoe past Luna’s roommates. I give her one last smile and shuffle down the stairs.</p></div>
