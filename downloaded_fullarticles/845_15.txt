    <p>Ever since Christmas week began, God started getting a lot of requests, prayers and wishes from around the world. Maybe it was Christmas, maybe it was the overflowing population, but God was having a hard time handling all of it herself, even with her talented team of Angels. So a certain someone decided to lend a helping hand, for two reasons - one, she was not as evil as everyone made her out to be and second, she had a crush on God (which was obvious to everyone except God herself)and even though it seemed to be surprising, it was true, and her friends/workers suggested she tried to get closer to her, without trying to get her neck sliced off. <br/>So Satan set out on her way to get God to notice her, and she wanted to present her best version, so she proposed an idea which raised eyebrows everywhere from the Underworld to the Clouds. </p><p>“So you will lend your Demons to me so that they can help out my Angels fulfill wishes all over the world?” God said, unsure whether this was some prank in disguise. Or worse, some sort of cruel plan of Satan’s to get hold of the Sanctuary in the Clouds. Who wouldn’t the place where there was no concept of time?<br/>“Yeah, that’s what I am propositioning,” Satan said coolly, filing her blood red nails.<br/>“Okay, let me discuss it with my Angels. I don’t want them to be uncomfortable.”<br/>“So you’re up for it?”<br/>“I mean yeah, there are a lot of kids around who need help and it is stressing the angels out and me too to be honest, but that;s none of your business. But this does seem like a good plan, if your Demons decide to behave well.”<br/>“I will make sure they do,” Satan said, inspecting a gleaming diamond on God’s table and God slapped her hand away.<br/>“Why are you doing this though?” God asked, furrowing her eyebrows. She was clearly not fully convinced, but she wanted to make Angels feel less stressed but also make the kids out there happy. Kids being practically every human because God was so so old, not that it was visible on her skin. But then, she was God, and she could look like an Ogre or a Siren or a koala, so you never really know. <br/>Anyways, she was really getting lured into the idea but it was Satan and she was known for creating chaos out of thin air. <br/>“Well,” Satan made sure she had locked out her memory so that God was unable to look at what was her actual motive, “I just feel sorry for you and I know you are too proud to ask for help, especially from someone who lives, actually rules the Underworld,” she tried to look cool by putting her feet up on God’s desk but God made the desk disappear before she could do it.<br/>“Just because I cannot read your mind doesn’t mean I don’t know what kind of a Satan you are,” God said and Satan tried her best to listen to her, as she was looking at God’s bare thighs. The latter was wearing a gleaming powdery white corset and tight shorts with a cape and it accentuated her warm honey tone really well. Satan made sure her fangs did not pop out. <br/>“Anyways, think about it, here is the contract and stuff. The Angels and Demons will work in pairs and they will be assigned to each other after consulting the Oracle. It will be fine, trust me.”<br/>“I really want to, but I am not convinced you are doing this without any selfish motive,” God said.<br/>“Well, you are right,” Satan said, scratching her forehead, “but it’s nothing harmful, I will let you know about it and ask for it only if we pull this off.”<br/>“I can work with that,” God said, and stood up. Satan’s fangs popped out. She got up and covered her mouth. <br/>“Let’s shake it,” God said, extending her hand. <br/>“You know what will happen if we make contact,” Satan said.<br/>“Yeah well, it’s okay,” God said, rolling her eyes. <br/>So they shook their hands and there was a thunderstorm in various unsuspecting regions on Earth where it wasn’t expected at all.<br/>God walked out and Satan stood there, with the remnants of the warmth of God’s hand. God popped back in moments later. <br/>“Nice fangs by the way.”</p><p>Satan rushed back to the Underworld.</p>
