    <p dir="ltr"><b>Ron</b><br class="kix-line-break"/><br class="kix-line-break"/>Ever since the start of school something always seemed off about Harry. But this year in particular he had seemed...distant, to say the least. At first I thought that I was going crazy, but it consistently happened so I began to question it.  Harry had been endlessly staring at fucking Malfoy for some odd reason. Unless I had been imagining it. Thinking that I was imagining this happening had been bothering me all day, so I decided I needed to confirm with my very observant <strike>girlfriend</strike> fiancée that I wasn’t going insane</p>
<p> </p>
<p dir="ltr">“ ‘Mione?” <br class="kix-line-break"/><br class="kix-line-break"/></p>
<p dir="ltr">“Yes Ron what is it” my beloved fiancée asked a bit exasperated. I had interrupted her precious study time. You see this was no ordinary year at hogwarts-not that any were-this year was our 8th year, or a redo of 7th seeing as Voldemort so rudely interrupted our education. So now ‘Mione was already studying for NEWTs,  even though we had over five months until we should even think about studying. It was only October for god's sake!</p>
<p> </p>
<p dir="ltr">”Am I crazy or is Harry falling-“ I was cut off by Hermione predicting exactly what I was going to say as she often does. It is quite endearing actually <br class="kix-line-break"/><br class="kix-line-break"/></p>
<p dir="ltr">”Back in to his habit of obsessively stalking Draco all the goddamn time? No, you most definitely are not insane” That’s a relief. I think. It is unsettling to think that Harry constantly thinks about that ferret.<br class="kix-line-break"/><br class="kix-line-break"/></p>
<p dir="ltr">”Ok. That makes me feel a tad bit better-“ wait hold up. I notice the phrasing that Hermione had used “since when did Malfoy become Draco to you?” I inquired.<br class="kix-line-break"/>Looking annoyed she just replied with a simple ”Since he stopped being a dick to us”<br class="kix-line-break"/><br class="kix-line-break"/></p>
<p dir="ltr">Oh. Well that made sense I guess. Now that I think about it Draco has toned down the bitchy attitude gryffindors. “Anyway, do you think that Harry likes Ma-Draco?” This has been on my mind all week, and has been the main source of headache for me. Although the more I think about it, the more I think that it is plausible. “I mean first of all he stares at Draco ALL THE TIME and it drives everybody insane. Then he follows him around. Also he knows everything about the ferret, from his favorite foods to his daily routine.”<br class="kix-line-break"/><br class="kix-line-break"/>Hermione has a contemplative expression on her face. “I mean everything fits into place, but honestly I don’t think that Harry has realized that he likes Draco yet. I don’t think he even knows that he likes guys.” She pauses and has a confused look on her face, then it lights up in that ever so gorgeous and addictive way when she figures it out. “Now that I think about it” she continues “I am pretty sure Draco even knows that Harry is infatuated with him.”<br class="kix-line-break"/><br class="kix-line-break"/>This shocks me. Kinda. Not really. “How could you possibly know this?”<br class="kix-line-break"/><br class="kix-line-break"/>Hermione gives a small chuckle “well, every time Draco catches Harry staring at him, he gives this sort of small smirk and a little eye roll.” All of a sudden she emits a gasp “I think that they would both be happier if they were together. But how?” she trails off with her brows furrowed together.<br class="kix-line-break"/><br class="kix-line-break"/>”Well, neither of them could every resist a challenge” I saw with grin across my face. <br class="kix-line-break"/><br class="kix-line-break"/>We spend the rest of the evening cuddled together figuring out the details of the grand plan.</p>
<p> </p>
<p dir="ltr"><b>Hermione</b><br class="kix-line-break"/><br class="kix-line-break"/>This plan is fucking brilliant. Both Harry and Draco are way too stubborn for their own good, so there is absolutely no way either of them are going to back down and seem cowardly. Now all that’s left to do is get all of the 8th year in on it, and explain the plan</p>
<p dir="ltr"><br class="kix-line-break"/>I wait until later that day when everyone is in the private 8th year common room reading or doing homework, conveniently Draco is in the library and of course Harry is stalking him... like always. “OK everybody” I call to get everyone’s attention. “Who wants to help Ron and I help Harry and Draco get their shit together”<br class="kix-line-break"/><br class="kix-line-break"/></p>
<p dir="ltr">There are cheers from the entire room. Guess it looks like we will get plenty of help. No problems there.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><br class="kix-line-break"/>”Oh, we’re finally doing this? Honestly I swear to god Harry lets all of Draco’s flirting fly right over his head” that was an exasperated Dean curled up against his boyfriend Seamus.<br class="kix-line-break"/><br class="kix-line-break"/>”Yeah. It physically pains me to watch those two” there are murmurs of agreements from just about everybody to Seamus’s statement.<br class="kix-line-break"/><br class="kix-line-break"/>”But how” “They are oblivious to each other” “it’s going to be impossible” Shouts of questions and doubts from around the room.<br class="kix-line-break"/><br class="kix-line-break"/>To calm them down I begin telling them the plan. “Well, as we all know they are both stubborn as hell, making it so they won't back down from a challenge” I see people nodding their heads all around me. “So what were are going to do is challenge them to a game...of sorts. Basically whoever can make the other fall in love first. Also along the way we will have weekly challenges for them to complete”</p>
<p dir="ltr"><br class="kix-line-break"/>”When does this start. It’s going to be fucking hilarious” Pansy calls from the back of the room by the fire.<br class="kix-line-break"/><br class="kix-line-break"/>”Tonight when they get back into the common room” I pause feeling as if I have forgotten something. Oh! “And you all will be the judges of who you think did the best“<br class="kix-line-break"/><br class="kix-line-break"/>I hear a voice in the doorway. It’s Harry. ”The best at what?” He asks sounding confused.</p>
<p> </p>
<p dir="ltr">Shit. Here we go. This is going to be fun.</p>
<p> </p>
<p dir="ltr">
  <b>Harry</b>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p dir="ltr">Malfoy is up to something. I just know it. I mean sure he’s gotten better, and yes I testified at his trial but still. I have this feeling in my gut whenever he is around. A feeling that he’s going to do something bad, or that he is planning something. It most definitely doesn’t help his case that whenever he catches me watching him suspiciously, he smirks. I mean come on. You only do that if you are up to something.</p>
<p> </p>
<p dir="ltr">So I have been following him. No it is not creepy thank you very much Hermione. It is just a precaution. Tonight after confirming that he was only studying in the library and not plotting something, I headed back to the 8th year common room.</p>
<p> </p>
<p dir="ltr">When I get back, there is some sort of class meeting. How could they start without Draco and I?  I hear Hermione say “-who you think did the best“</p>
<p> </p>
<p dir="ltr">I am naturally curious, so I ask “the best at what?” Every head in the room turns towards me with some form of the expression shit on their faces. Now I am very confused. Why would they be panicked that I came back? Oh my god. Maybe they are planning something with Draco. No, Hermione and Ron would never do that to me.</p>
<p> </p>
<p dir="ltr">Hermione finally snaps out of her shock and replies. “Let’s wait for Draco to get back to explain. That way I don’t have to say it twice” she says kind of mysterious. Now I am really perplexed. What could Hermione tell the entire 8th year, apart from Draco and I, but not tell Draco and I separately. I don’t think about it for too long. She’s Hermione, she has a reason for everything.</p>
<p> </p>
<p dir="ltr">As if on cue <strike>Dra</strike> Malfoy walked in. Since when did I start calling him Draco in my head? It sound oddly natural. Maybe I’ve been doing it for longer than I realized.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“What is going on in here? Some sort of spy meeting? What, are you guys all plotting to kill me or something,” Draco drawled as he walked in, clearly attempting to sound lighthearted, but I knew better than that. He most definitely was not joking. I almost pity him, but he’s Malfoy so…</p>
<p> </p>
<p dir="ltr">“Hopefully what we are going to ask you won’t kill you,” Hermione cut in. My interest was officially piqued. “Ron and I,” she trailed off for a split second “with the help of the rest of the year of course, set up a game….of sorts that we would like you to participate in. Against an opponent of our choosing.” She sounded uncertain at the use of the word game, but oddly malicious afterwards.</p>
<p> </p>
<p dir="ltr">“Okay….” Draco responded with a hint of suspicion in his words, “who might this opponent be in this so called game of yours?” Ah - so he had also caught the trace of uncertainty in Hermione’s voice.</p>
<p> </p>
<p dir="ltr">Someone called out from somewhere in the room “None other than the one and only Harry Potter of course!” Upon further investigation I found that it had been Dean that shouted. Next to him you could see Seamus cuddled up together. They are such good friends. It is so sweet.</p>
<p> </p>
<p dir="ltr">Hermione continues to speak “Well….it is kind of a love game?” She sounded vaguely sorry,</p>
<p> </p>
<p dir="ltr">But excuse me.. the FUCK?</p>
