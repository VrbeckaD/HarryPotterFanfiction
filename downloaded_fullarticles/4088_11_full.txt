    <p>"Potter! If I catch you dozing off again, you'll become one of the potion ingredients we'll be using next class!" Snape bellowed with a mean sneer on his face, the look he always seemed to give Harry. Harry felt it was a little unfair that Snape's disdain was reserved especially for him.</p><p>At the same time, he supposed that it wasn't really his fault that he was so tired. It was Ron's.</p><p>Harry sent a pointed glare in Ron's direction and the red head gave him a bashful shrug of his shoulders. The two had been up almost all night trying to figure out how they could ruin any Slytherin's life. Namely Draco Malfoy's, but they decided that they didn't like Pansy much either.</p><p>Harry found both Draco and Pansy sitting together across the room. Draco was laughing none too discreetly at Harry, and Pansy was raising her brow at them.</p><p>Harry suddenly realized that he hadn't responded to Snape, who was now turning purple with anger.</p><p>"Yes- sorry, professor. I promise not to doze off again." Harry said. Though Ron snickered, Harry was dead serious about the statement. Snape scared him and he didn't want to further anger the man whose bad side he was already on.</p><p>As soon as Snape resumed his lecture on how to properly prepare today's potion, Harry went back to thinking about what he would do to Draco; he could save Pansy for later. Harry was trying to pay attention to Snape's lecture while he thought. He was pretty sure that Hermione would fill him in on anything that he had missed.</p><p>A lot of ideas came up while Harry and Ron were talking about what to do. They tried to keep it at least a little tame with Hermione around, but stupid and gross ideas started coming out as soon as she went off to bed. One of their first ideas had been to magically place Malfoy's head on pictures in a gay porn magazine. The two quickly realized that that would involve having to get a hold of a pornographic magazine, and then having to look through it to put Draco's pictures in it. Both had shuddered at the idea- especially at the thought of getting caught with the magazine before having a chance to use their magic on it.</p><p>The second idea was the one that they were still thinking about. This idea involved potentially ruining Malfoy's 'perfectly styled' and 'suave' hair by transfiguring it to share similarities to both Ron's and Harry's hair. They even considered giving him a long ponytail resembling Hermione's hair. It would obviously be easy to figure out who did this, but as long as Harry and Ron got to see Malfoy like that it would be worth it.</p><p>Harry felt the arm that had been holding up his head slip. This immediately pulled him completely out of his thoughts and focus on Snape. Out of the corner of his eye, Harry saw Ron flash him a wink.</p><p>"Now, collect your ingredients. And for Merlin's sake, if you feel like the potion is going bad ask for help. I'm not entirely sure what could go wrong while brewing this potion. It's a rather simple one," Snape explained. Harry almost scoffed, it sounded like Snape might actually care about what would happen to them if they messed up. He knew, though, that Snape was probably more worried about his classroom.</p><p>Hermione was, of course, the first one done finding all of the ingredients. Ron and Harry were slower, having to search for nearly everything. Neither had heard of most of these ingredients. Harry thought that a couple of them sounded like some of the ingredients stashed in Aunt Petunia's pantry, but he knew from experience that many non-magical people had plenty of wizarding items that they simply didn't know were magical.</p><p>The last ingredient that Harry grabbed was wattleseed. It was shaped oddly, like an ugly brown pea pod with black coffee bean-looking peas in it. On the board, Snape had written next to the ingredient that it wasn't the edible type. Harry hadn't even heard of wattleseed, edible or not.</p><p>Harry hefted the ingredients back to his cauldron. He was sitting next to Hermione. Ron and Dean sat diagonally across from him.</p><p>Harry noticed that Ron was sending glares towards the Slytherins. Several of them whispered amongst each other, signaling that something bad was surely about to happen to them. Harry kept a wary eye on them as he started making his potion.</p><p>Hermione acted as Harry's teacher for this potion; he watched and repeated what he did. It was hard to mess up a potion when you were watching someone as good as Hermione make it. Several people obviously thought the same, since they leaned over and craned their necks so they could see what the contents of Hermione's cauldron looked like.</p><p>The wattleseed was the last ingredient that Harry had to use. The people around him were already finishing up their potions. Most were done; Harry was lagging behind a little bit.</p><p>"Harry!" He heard a voice call. It belonged to Blaise Zabini, from the Slytherin side. He paused; he wasn't someone who would normally ever talk to Harry. Eventually dismissing Blaise, Harry turned his back on the cauldron. Moments later, he heard the familiar sound of a potion being poured into his cauldron, rather haphazardly, and whipped around. Someone had altered his potion.</p><p>He moved to investigate the concoction, leaning in towards the cauldron to see what had changed in his potion.</p><p>Harry's hands instinctively went up to rub his eyes; they felt dry and crusted over. The chatter of his classmates soon became muffled, and his vision went black.</p><p>"Potter! Are you awake yet?" He heard a biting voice call. The voice reminded him greatly of Snape, but it didn't have the same sneer behind it.</p><p>Harry opened his eyes and scrunched them once more as light flooded the room. He realized that he was on a bed, and a very uncomfortable one at that.</p><p>"Yeah. I'm awake. Where are we?" He asked as a dull pain shot through his neck and the back of his head. It was a killer headache.</p><p>"The hospital wing. Come on, sit up, you're the last one awake." The same voice said. Harry still couldn't exactly place the voice. It sounded like Draco's but deeper. No way in hell could it be Lucius Malfoy's, though, Harry thought as he tried to right himself into a sitting position.</p><p>He was on one of the beds in Madam Pomfrey's wing, the farthest bed to the right and closest to the door. Next to him were three other people that he didn't recognize.</p><p>Harry furrowed his brows; every one of them looked familiar but not recognizable. In the bed directly next to him was the man who had been talking to him. The man looked to be in his late twenties, with faint laugh lines around his mouth and long blonde hair. In Harry's opinion, he looked like a better-looking version of Malfoy.</p><p>Next to that bed were two teenagers, one a Gryffindor and the other a Slytherin. They also looked familiar and were gazing at Harry peculiarly.</p><p>"Who are you?" Harry asked. He knew that it wasn't the most polite thing to say after having just seen them for the first time, but they all seemed to know who he was.</p><p>The blonde next to him opened his mouth to respond, but didn't get a chance to before the teenager with shaggy black hair in a boyish cut spoke up. "Listen up, Potter. Whatever you did to that potion of yours ended up having rather unexpected results. It did something that I don't know how to reverse," the teenager snapped, making Harry suddenly feel very small. A sneer contorted his face, making Harry raise a brow.</p><p>"Professor Snape?" He questioned and his lowered brow met the raised one in surprise.</p><p>"Correct." The man said in his low rumble of a voice.</p><p>"And Professor McGonagall," A high-pitched female voice, which couldn't possibly be the voice of the Professor McGonagall Harry knew, added. The teenager that had spoken had auburn hair pinned up on top of her head. It was very messy, though, sticking out from its bun in disarray.</p><p>"So... Why are you two teenagers?" Harry asked, still not really understanding what was happening.</p><p>"Harry, it's not just us that changed. Look at Draco, yourself even." Harry's eyes snapped to the blonde sitting up next to him. So that was Draco, an older version of him?</p><p>"What's different about me?" He asked and his hands went up to his face. He felt glasses resting on his nose, hair just slightly below his ears, and his raised scar on his forehead. He couldn't really place anything different.</p><p>"You don't look that different, but you're definitely older. Definitely don't look like a baby anymore." Draco said with his lip curled slightly in disdain. Harry frowned at the jeer.</p><p>"You look just like your father." Harry said. To him it was a major jab, but Draco just looked smug at the words.</p><p>"I would say you do too, but how would I know?" Draco asked with a defiant smirk.</p><p>"You cheeky wanker!" Harry called.</p><p>Before the argument could get any more heated, Snape's voice boomed as he shouted, "Both of you just shut it! I'm trying to figure out how this even happened."</p><p>"Some tosser Slytherin threw some ingredient in my cauldron after Blaise got my attention." Harry spoke. He remembered everything up until then. After that only a faint bit came to memory. Harry was also rightly seething at the fact that it had even happened, after he had been so careful with his potion.</p><p>Draco had a faint flush on his cheeks after Harry said that. Snape looked passive, not really wanted one of his Slytherins to be in trouble, but McGonagall gave Draco a pointed look. "Mr. Malfoy, did you throw something in Mr. Potter's potions?" She asked with pursed lips. Harry thought that it was silly to see someone who looked like a teenager telling off the obviously adult Draco.</p><p>"No, but I know who did. It was stupid, I'm sorry." Draco admitted with an ashamed look on his face. He looked a little surprised that he had just said something genuinely remorseful for once. Snape had a raised brow.</p><p>Harry removed the blanket from around him. It was fairly hot in the room. He rose to find that he was dressed in mostly black with a few slivers of green. He had one black form-fitting jeans, a grey cotton shirt, and converse shoes trimmed with green. He also had a few green bangles on.</p><p>"So you two are in the past, and we're in the future? This is all so confusing. How is everyone else going to react?" Harry questioned.</p><p>Almost on cue, the door opened and a worried looking Hermione, Ginny, and Ron walked in. Hermione looked like she hadn't gotten any sleep and Ginny looked close to tears.</p><p>"Severus!" Hermione cried and both Harry and Draco shared a look but stayed silent as Hermione threw her arms around Snape.</p><p>"We were so worried!" Ginny chimed in and also put her arms around Snape so the professor was awkwardly smashed between the bosoms of two of his female students.</p><p>Harry raised both of his eyebrows and Snape looked uncharacteristically shy. There was a bright blush on his face.</p><p>"S-sorry." Snape stuttered out, trying to figure out what was going on while trying to remain composed.</p><p>Ron just shook his head. "Bloody hell, mate. I can't believe you blew up the potions classroom." Ron said as he chuckled a bit.</p><p>"Mr. Weasley, that language is not to be used in these halls." McGonagall said with her pursed lips. Ron gave her an incredulous look.</p><p>Ron shot a sneer at Mcgonagall.</p><p>McGonagall let her jaw drop, but quickly composed herself and shot a glare at Draco and Harry who hadn't said anything the entire time but instead stared, freaked out by the whole event.</p><p>Draco spoke up, "Watch your mouth We- Mr. Weasley." Draco caught himself, about to call Ron by something a little more personal than an adult relationship.</p><p>Hermione brought her face up from checking over Severus and gave a small smirk at Ron's blushing face. "Professors Potter and Malfoy, how are you?" She asked kindly. Harry heard what sounded like a lighter tone when she used Malfoy's voice, her tone got a little more annoyed when she said Potter.</p><p>"We're fine. Thank you, Ms. Granger." Draco said with a weirdly kind smile towards her. He's really good at acting. Harry thought with a small chuckle.</p><p>A lot of thoughts were swimming around in Harry's head, but for some reason he wasn't panicking; he didn't feel afraid or anything, he kind of thought that all of this was comical.</p><p>Harry swung his legs over to one side of the bed and stood. He still had a headache, but really wanted out of the room so he could figure out how to fix all of this. Harry would usually have to wait for Mrs. Pomfrey's clearance to leave, but if he was really a professor then Harry figured he would just be allowed to go when he pleased.</p><p>Harry glanced over at Snape and McGonagall, he would need a reason to see both of them later and if the four of them really did in some way switch places. He guessed the best way would be to give them detention. Harry glanced at the clock; after dinner would be an appropriate time for detention.</p><p>"Mr. Snape, Ms. McGonagall, please see me in my, uh, office after dinner. For detention." Harry almost winced when he said detention to two of his teachers. Snape looked pissed but McGonagall looked like she knew exactly what he was doing.</p><p>Draco swung out of the bed as well and stood. Harry raised an eyebrow when he saw that Draco's hair was just as long as his fathers, if not a bit longer. Draco curled up one lip at the length and weight of the hair on his head.</p><p>Draco had a far off look in his eyes, obviously thinking about something. He stayed like that for a moment before looking towards Hermione. "Ms. Granger, if I could speak with you for a moment." He asked with a smile and motioned towards the door.</p><p>Hermione smiled at him almost lovingly. Harry wanted to vomit. Gross, did Mione have a crush on her professor? Was it really on Malfoy? Harry thought. She did look rather smitten. "Of course!" She chirped and Ginny gave her a small smirk.</p><p>Draco latched his hand onto Harry's forearm- rather tightly- and pulled the man from the room as well.</p><p>Draco stood up on his toes, to reach Harry's ear. For the first time since waking up, Harry noticed that he was a few inches taller than Draco, a feat that set a smirk on his face.</p><p>"I'm going to explain what happened to her- for now she's the only one that has to know but we need someone to tells us everything. We can't have professors not even knowing where their rooms are." Draco explained and Harry nodded; Mione was a good pick. She wouldn't tell anyone if they told her not to and would probably know everything that they needed.</p><p>"What is it that you needed to talk about, Professor Malfoy?" Hermione asked as they got out to the hallway.</p><p>Both boys felt a bit bad for leaving Snape and McGonagall, but they were adults. Or, at least they used to be adult.</p><p>"Let's speak somewhere more private. Your office, Professor Potter." Malfoy stated and motioned forward. Harry started walking without knowing where he was going. Hermione seemed alright with going to Harry's office, even if she didn't seem very comfortable around him. All Harry had to do was trust that Malfoy knew where his office was.</p><p>"You're saying that Professor Potter is my best friend?" Hermione asked with an incredulous look on her face.</p><p>Draco nodded with a perfectly straight face. Hermione was up to date now; she knew everything that had happened and what life was like before. She was taking it all in as she sat in Harry's office, which was the last place he had ever expected it to be.</p><p>Draco had figured out that they had in a way switched lived with their professors. Both he and Draco were inclined to act like the professor that they had swapped with. As such, Harry's office was where Snape's office used to be.</p><p>More horrible then knowing that Snape was waltzing around with his friends was the thought that if Harry didn't get this cleared up, he would be teaching potions to kids older than him.</p><p>"Alright, wow. That's a lot to take in. Though I don't see why you would lie to me..." Hermione trailed off in thought for a moment before continuing. "I suppose you just told me all that in the hopes that I'll fill you in on your lives?" She asked, and the two eagerly nodded.</p><p>"You said that in the, uh, alternate universe you two hated each other, right?" She asked. Draco sent a sneer in Harry's direction, forcing Harry had to hold back an inappropriate comment.</p><p>"Yes, we didn't exactly care for each other." Draco spoke.</p><p>"I'll say." Harry added with a frown.</p><p>"Then this is going to be awkward. Look at your left hands." Hermione explained cryptically. She looked kind of embarrassed to be explaining all of this.</p><p>Harry raised his hand and saw a ring on his finger- his wedding finger.</p><p>"Blimey!" Harry exclaimed as he examined the ring that he hadn't noticed before.</p><p>"Hell." Draco said in a quieter voice.</p><p>Harry was wearing a ring with a red band and a large green diamond in the center. He flipped his hand to look at the palm of the ring; inscribed on the back was "HP+DM".</p><p>"I'm married to this tosser?!" Harry yelled as his eyes shot up to Draco and he stared intensely. The thought made him want to vomit.</p><p>Draco heard Harry yell but was still looking at his ring. It was the complete opposite of Harry's. Draco's ring had a green band with a red diamond, but the back had the same cheesy thing inscribed on it.</p><p>"I don't know how we're going to pull this off." Draco said with his forehead in the palm of his hand.</p><p>Hermione looked really awkward sitting next to the two. Draco directed his gaze to her, about ready to let her go just so he could kill Harry Potter.</p><p>"Does this mean that we live together? Oh, brother... Have we shagged? Are there wedding photos? Dead lord, was your father there?" Harry asked, the arch in his brows growing deeper with each statement.</p><p>"Uh," Hermione looked a bit panicked. "Yes you live together, and I figure that you've, uh, shagged. There are wedding photos. I was there. And yes, Mr. Malfoy was at the wedding." Hermione rambled off, trying to be helpful but just making Harry more pissed.</p><p>Draco rubbed his temples lightly as he tried to find the silver lining in all of this. He was getting a massive headache from all of this new information. "At least... At least we'll be able to figure out how to get this all back to normal and it won't seem weird that we're spending all of our time together." Draco explained, causing Hermione to let out a sigh.</p><p>"We do spend time together, right Hermione?" Harry double-checked. He couldn't remember ever having married a teacher at the school. He wasn't really sure how they acted.</p><p>"Oh, yes!" She immediately answered, then blushed a bit at her promptness. "I mean, you're always together. One of you always seems to have a favor for the other- dropping in on classes and such. Very affectionate too!" She explained.</p><p>Draco's heart dropped. That would be a hard thing to keep up. He was sure that a real married couple could easily find ways to be together, but Harry and Draco would probably seem like they were forcing it.</p><p>"What do you mean by affectionate? Do I actually have to act like I'm in l-l-lo-love with Draco?" Harry asked, his mind reeled as he faltered over the word love. It was a word he commonly used, just rarely in the same sentence as Draco's name.</p><p>"Well, you hold hands at meals. During lunch you usually get your meals to go and walk through the courtyard, at school dances you dance with each other, you sneak kisses-" Harry cut Hermione off.</p><p>"That means we don't have to kiss though right! If we're usually sneaking, then we could just pretend we're snogging. No one has to see us kiss, right?" Harry asked hopefully. He did not want to have to keep up appearances with Malfoy of all people.</p><p>Hermione shook her head sadly. "A lot of girls are really, um... Into your relationship. They snap photos. If no one was to take any photos, there could be rumors. Some students are already trying to start a rumor that Professor Malfoy is taking advantage of female students... It wouldn't end well if you didn't kiss at least once a day." She explained with a bright red blush covering her face. Harry wasn't sure that he had ever heard Hermione speak so hesitantly in one conversation. He could tell that she was really struggling.</p><p>Draco pinched the bridge of his nose in frustration. "Alright, Ms. Granger, is there anything else that we need to know about our relationship?" Draco asked.</p><p>"I'm not sure, nothing really big. If I think of something else, I'll tell you guys." She pursed her lips lightly to the right. Harry recognized that as her thinking face. "There is one thing. Professor Potter, you don't call Professor Malfoy 'Draco', you call him 'Dragon'. In fact, I don't think I've ever heard you call him by his real name. And every once in a while, Professor Malfoy, you'll call Professor Potter 'Snake', not often, just once every few days." Mione explained, she didn't look very happy having to use her professors' first names.</p><p>"Thank you Ms. Granger. That has been duly noted. Now, moving on, what about our teaching styles? Tell us about any quirks or off habits that we may have, if you please." Draco asked her.</p><p>Hermione jumped into a long ramble about every little thing that they did as teachers, making sure that they knew everything.</p><p>"Malfoy, I can't teach potions!" Harry exclaimed after Hermione left. "She described my teaching just like she would Snape's! I can't do that!" Harry whined. Draco tipped back the chair he was sitting in, leaning dangerously back.</p><p>"I'll have to help you plan lessons at night, a script almost that you'll have to read from. Remember, you'll be kind of embodying Snape, it won't be hard for you to be quick with a comeback or downright mean. I mean, have you noticed how nice I've been acting?" Draco asked with a shudder.</p><p>"I suppose you're right. I can help you with transfigurations, too, not that you'll need much help. But still, I know McGonagall better than you do." Harry said, and Draco nodded.</p><p>Harry glanced up at the clock. It was Saturday- they had been passed out since the explosion yesterday and Harry's stomach was growling loudly. It was nearing dinner time.</p><p>"We both need food." Draco said with a sigh. "How are we going to face everyone that we know? With you calling me Dragon! And us holding hands!" Draco exclaimed.</p><p>"Imagine everyone in their pants." Harry said with a chuckle and Draco sent him a glare.</p><p>"Come on, it's now or never." Draco said and stood from his chair, holding a hand out to Harry. Harry sneered at the offered hand for a moment before grasping it and pulling himself up from his seat.</p><p>"Alright, Dragon." Harry put a cheeky emphasis on the nickname.</p><p>"Shut up, my Snake." Draco said with the same attitude.</p><p>"You know, Draco, I think you only call me Snake the morning after a bang." Harry said with a chuckle. Draco went red.</p><p>"What?" he said for clarification.</p><p>"Merlin, for a Slytherin you're really oblivious." He said with a chuckle. "Think about it; she said that you only call me that every once in a while, every few days. It makes sense." Harry said with a devilish smirk.</p><p>"Harry James Potter! How crude." Draco exclaimed.</p><p>"Sheesh, really taking after McGonagall aren't you?" He asked with an eye roll as he walked out of the office with Draco.</p><p>Draco didn't respond and instead silently fumed.</p><p>Harry was hyper aware of Draco's hand in his. Draco's hand was dry but not rough. It was a perfectly smooth hand with clear-coated nails.</p><p>Harry's hand was a bit clammy. They weren't disgusting, but he could tell that Draco was a bit deterred.</p><p>Most students were already at dinner, so the two were walking in silence, Draco looked pissed. Harry didn't really care. He was fine as long as they got out of this situation quickly.</p><p>"Your hand is sweaty." Draco complained and pulled his hand away so he could wipe it on his black trousers, Harry followed suit.</p><p>'Your hand is dainty like a princess." Harry growled and held out his hand for Draco to once again take. Draco took it angrily.</p><p>"I'm not a fucking princess." Draco growled right back.</p><p>"Oh, sorry, you're a Dragon Princess." Harry said with a smirk.</p><p>"You're a bloody arsehole." Draco shot right back.</p><p>"I'm your bloody arsehole though." Harry said with a sickening sweetness in his voice. He knew in the back of his head that he shouldn't be trying to get a rise out of Draco. A student could walk by and see them, not that Harry really cared about Malfoy's reputation being ruined. He just worried about his own. He would need to be able to instill fear in his students as Snape had done if he was ever going to teach his weakest subject.</p><p>"You cheeky bastard. Be glad I didn't get switched with Lupin! I'd duel you until one of us was forced to use a bloody killing curse to end it." Draco retorted.</p><p>"You wouldn't have the balls." Harry said with a small shrug. He could see the doors to the great hall in front of them. They were open, waiting for them to enter.</p><p>"I don't have the balls… You damn tosser!" Draco hissed at him.</p><p>"Your comebacks aren't even good anymore. I think I've been called a tosser by you a thousand times." Harry said with narrowing eyes. He could feel his wand burrowing a hole in his pocket, waiting to be taken out.</p><p>"Will you shut up? My comebacks aren't good? Your comebacks are rubbish!" Draco practically shouted.</p><p>Harry shot his eyes towards the doors to the great hall, coming to his senses a bit. He could see a few students nearest the doors looking at them with curiosity in their eyes.</p><p>"Malfoy- keep it down." Harry whispered, but he knew in that instant that he had driven Malfoy too far up the wall. Usually, they could throw a couple of spells at each other and get it out of their systems while everyone else got a laugh out of it. He doubted that the other students were going to get a laugh out of two married teachers at each other's throats.</p><p>"I will not keep it down! You stupid wanker. You're so immature. You got us into this whole bloody mess." Malfoy jeered as they continued walking, Harry was trying to lag behind but Malfoy had a vice-like grip on Harry's hand and dragged him into the room.</p><p>"I did not, that was your fault."</p><p>"My fault my ass! You're so easy to get in trouble, to make fun of, to throw a curse at!" Malfoy shouted. Harry gritted his teeth. Almost the whole great room had gone quiet.</p><p>"Just calm down. Harry hissed and tore his hand out of Malfoy's to put his hands on Malfoy's shoulders in an attempt to calm him.</p><p>Malfoy didn't respond, instead pulling out his wand. Before Harry had a chance to disarm him, Malfoy yelled "Diffindo!" A small slit opened up in the front of Harry's shirt, but the ripping spell went past that and lightly tore Harry's skin. A small drop of blood dripped down his chest.</p><p>The students looked alarmed and the teachers looked about ready to throw them off of the property.</p><p>"For Merlin's sake! You're barmy!" Harry drew his own wand and started to yell an Expelliarmus spell when he noticed the bracelet about Draco's wrist.</p><p>"Expulso!" He shouted and the bracelet exploded, leaving raw skin all around Draco's wrist.</p><p>Draco was halfway through a Furnunculus spell when someone shouted "Expelliarmus!" and both of their wands dropped to the ground.</p><p>"Crikey." Draco said as he looked around at all of the students' and teachers' eyes on them. Some of the first years looked traumatized. Out of the corner of his eye, Harry saw Snape sit down- he was the caster of the disarming spell.</p><p>In the deathly silence, both boys reached down to lift their wands and slip them back into their pockets.</p><p>Harry didn't reach for Draco's hand again but instead took one of the open seats at the teacher's table, next to Lupin. Draco took the seat on the other side of Harry.</p><p>"You guys really went at it. Are you alright?" Remus asked with concern in his eyes and masking his face.</p><p>Harry nodded. "Yeah, sorry. We're both a little high-strung today." He explained with a sigh.</p><p>"I was talking about the major Expulso cut on your chest. It's turning your shirt red." Remus said with a small chuckle. Harry looked down and noticed that his chest did have a steady stream of blood pouring out.</p><p>"Oh, man." Harry said and flashed Draco a look.</p><p>Draco sighed and pulled out his wand, causing everyone at the table to flinch. Harry sent them a sneer that seemed to come to his lips with ease, though he hadn't really meant to do it.</p><p>"Episkey." Draco muttered and the wound closed. Harry smiled as he felt the usual sensations of the healing spell before the wound closed. Draco put his wand away.</p><p>Harry set his hand on the table. He gave Draco a look that read, "Take it". Harry hoped that they hadn't ruined everything with that scene.</p><p>Draco rested his hand in Harry's and they clasped their hands together.</p><p>"Sorry, Dragon." Harry spoke. The words came surprisingly easily to his lips, like he'd spoken them before a hundred times.</p><p>It felt awkward to have Draco sitting so close and to be holding his hand. But it was also very familiar; it felt like they'd done it a million times. Harry knew that they had, but it was in this new universe so he wasn't familiar with the gesture.</p><p>"You're forgiven, my Snake." Draco said with a small smirk. In that instance, Harry knew that Draco had won the fight. He had proved to Harry that the nickname Snake wasn't only used the morning after.</p><p>Draco felt good about this, better then he should have. Harry was attractive, and while Draco would definitely poke some fun at him for having sweaty hands, or being awkward - really, Draco could make fun of Harry for anything - he would try to see the silver lining that he had been looking for earlier.</p>
