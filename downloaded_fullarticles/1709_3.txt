  <span>Summer came early this year. It was only May and still you were in the third week of a heat wave. The students has problems to concentrate on studying for their finals and as much as they wanted to hide it, the staff suffered, too.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When you started as Professor for History of Magic at the beginning of this school year because Professor Binns tended to fall asleep during class - who knew that ghosts could sleep at all? - the teacher‘s room had been buzzing with life. There were always conversations, on students, weather, politics, you name it. All year this had been the one place where you could always find somebody to talk to or even play board games with when you were extremely bored. But now all of you sat there sweating and too tired to even start a conversation. And even if you would, at least your own brain had problems to form coherent sentences. It was torture. Especially since you found out that even Dumbledore himself had been unable to use a cooling spell. It seemed there were some correlations between the spell that prevented apparition and any cooling spells, meaning, they couldn’t work at the same place at the same time. You either had to sweat or Hogwarts was no longer the safest place on earth. And nobody listened to you when you claimed that a place where the umptieth Defence teacher in a row lost his position - and some of them even died in the castle under mysterious circumstances - might not exactly be the safest place on earth at all.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This evening you gave up. The air in your chambers was too hot and mostly too humid to even sit there without heavy sweating. You couldn’t work this way. Hell, you couldn’t even sleep this way and had already missed a lot of hours of sleep since the heat wave had begun. You had even tried to sleep in the bathtub - of course filled with cold water -, but had found that you were too scared to drown, even with as many security spells as you could think of.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This was going to end tonight. If you had to be able to teach tomorrow, you needed a moment of relaxation and a good night’s sleep.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wingardium Leviosa”, you murmured towards your mattress and forced it to come with you. In the other hand that didn’t hold the wand you carried a book and a few things you thought necessary for an evening of rest.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Of course the students all stared at you when you went downstairs, accompanied by a flying mattress. It probably looked a bit weird, you had to admit. But you didn’t care. You weren’t any weirder than their former History professor, right? At least you were still alive.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Deeper and deeper into the very heart of the castle you went, and then you finally reached the one place where the air and temperature was still somewhat acceptable. Sure, the dungeons were damp even on their driest of days, but in the relative coldness down here that didn’t matter that much.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But where were you supposed to go? While the Potions classroom was empty by this time of the day, it was probably hot in there, due to all the fires cooking whatever liquid had been the subject today. But surely there had to be empty classrooms down here as well, right? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>You just went on to open every door you could find.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The first was a boys bathroom. Hell, who knew teenagers would be that scared if a woman came in? When you were a teenager, they were the ones trying to glimpse into the girls lavatories. Kids these days …</span>
</p><p>
  <span>You didn’t try the next door, assuming that this was the girls bathroom - good to know if you had to pee tonight.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When you opened the next door, your mattress fell to the floor next to you. How were you supposed to concentrate on a spell when there was Professor Snape in a grey-ish night gown in front of you?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You have obviously never heard of knocking, Professor L/N”, he stated, a little flushed. But his mimics didn’t betray him. In fact, he looked cold like ice. If only, you caught yourself thinking.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sorry. Hadn’t had a hand free.” You stepped aside to show him the mattress you had been carrying magically.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And why exactly do you walk the mattress? Does it pee inside your chambers otherwise? Maybe you should enroll it in mattress school?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wow, nobody ever told you this man has a sense of humour. Though maybe he actually had wanted to insult you. Didn’t work. “Oh, no, I just need to wear it out. You know, being inside all the time, the mattress has no way of letting off steam”, you grinned. “No, I’m looking for a free room to sleep. In my chambers it’s just too hot and down here seems to be the only place where one can still breathe. Any idea which room I could use?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You wish to sleep on a mattress on the floor?”, he asked sceptically? “I am not sure Madame Pomfrey knows how to handle disc prolapse as it’s not exactly a magical condition.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>You had seen her treat broken bones, so you were sure she knew her way around normal, non-magical injuries as well. But you just shrugged. “Got a better idea?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He rolled his eyes. “My sofa is comfortable”, he stated.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Did he just invite you in? Huh. You discovered more sides of him every minute it seemed. “And you’re sure you don’t mind?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Just give your mattress some water and tell it my bed is off limits and then close the door. From the inside.” And you were pretty sure you had seen something like a smile on his face, even though it was gone when you blinked. Curious. Maybe he wasn’t as unlikeable as you had always thought.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And when you closed the door, you noticed that inside his chambers it was even cooler than in the rest of the dungeon. You smiled. You had been allowed to step inside his personal oasis. Now you just needed to find a way to never be forced to leave again.</span>
