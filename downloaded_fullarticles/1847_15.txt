  <strong>Chapter One</strong>
</p>
<p>Harry arrived at King’s Cross Station at 10:35 a.m. on September 1<sup>st</sup>, 1998. The place seemed so foreign to him, despite the fact he had been going there for years. He was pushing two suitcases on a trolley before him, and was holding a five-month old baby tight to his chest. He wasn’t looking forward to passing the barrier with a baby in his arms, but he had already discussed it with Professor – sorry, Headmistress – McGonagall. They both wanted his eighth year to be as normal as possible. It would already be weird enough that he was the only student at school with a baby, she didn’t want to draw attention to him by allowing him to show up any other way than the Hogwarts Express.</p>
<p>He held Teddy tighter to his chest, and sprinted towards the brick wall between platforms nine and ten. Once he knew he was through, he let go of his trolley and immediately checked on Teddy. He was still sleeping, Harry was very lucky in one aspect: Teddy was a deep sleeper. Although, he didn’t really count himself lucky every time he freaked out and thought Teddy was dead because he wouldn’t wake up. He swore that sometimes his heart literally stopped when Teddy slept for longer than three hours maximum. Molly told him that it was a symptom of being a new parent.</p>
<p>Once he believed that Teddy was secure in his arms, Harry reached for his trolley and pushed it farther into the station. He searched throughout the crowd, seeing many familiar faces, but no as many as he had hoped. He knew that a lot of the people in his year weren’t coming back for their own personal reasons – Ron, for example, was going through auror training rather than completing school this year. He knew Hermione was coming back, but she’d be arriving with Ginny and Luna, most likely ten minutes before the train left. With a quick glance around, he could see Terry Boot and Michael Corner were there, but Padma and Parvati Patil were missing. He didn’t have to look to know that that Dean, Seamus, and Neville were there, they had already confirmed that they would be through letters. But what surprised him most was that standing across the station was Draco bloody Malfoy – and he was staring at Harry. More specifically the baby in Harry’s arms.</p>
<p>Harry adjusted Teddy in his arms, realizing now that he could uncover his godson’s head now that there was no fear of muggles seeing his hair change. He released his trolley once again to unwrap the blanket from around Teddy’s head, seeing that his hair was a familiar brown, as it usually was when the boy was sleeping. Harry loved the color of Teddy’s natural hair, but knew it was likely that the boy would never see his natural appearance. He had read up on metamorphmagi, and most sources claimed that the person with the abilities would likely never be able to match their natural appearance with their abilities. Meaning that Teddy would only see his true form in pictures of him sleeping.</p>
<p>Harry glanced up at Malfoy again, seeing that he had now turned away to his fellow Slytherins, Greengrass Parkinson and Zabini. Harry knew that Goyle would not be returning this year, not after the death of his best friend, and he knew Nott and Bulstrode had been too involved in Death Eater activities to not be arrested, despite still being children. He had gone to all of their trials, had even testified on Goyle’s and Malfoy’s behalf (and Narcissa’s). When he went, he left Teddy with Andromeda, and every time he picked up his godson, she offered to raise him, at least for a year or two. And every time, he refused.</p>
<p>Not many people understood the fact that he wanted to raise Teddy, and even fewer understood that he wanted to do it alone. Andromeda and Molly had been pestering him ever since he had decided about he was still young and needed to live. Arthur, at least, had been understanding about it, but still stopped by the tiny apartment that Harry lived at. Harry knew he could live at Grimmauld Place, but he didn’t want Teddy growing up in a place that held so many bad memories, so he bought a small apartment in muggle London. Hermione had tried to be understanding, but even she thought it was too much responsibility for an eighteen-year-old. In truth, Harry believed that the only person who truly understood his decision was Luna.</p>
<p>Harry was broken out of his thoughts by a familiar, annoyingly high-pitched, voice. “HARRY! Over here!”, it called. Harry turned, grabbing his trolley and grimacing at the thought of what was come. He knew that they would be here, especially after him going semi-off-the-grid for the past few months. They all wanted a statement, especially her: Rita Skeeter. After the war, more and more people read her articles, discussing all of her theories about people who played key-parts in the war. <em>Was Draco Malfoy Bitten by the Werewolf, Fenrir Greyback? Severus Snape: Vampire or Just Another Brooding Death Eater? Is You-Know-Who Really Dead or has The Boy Who Lived Failed Again? </em>Harry couldn’t help reading the articles, but they were all written on such little evidence that they ended up in his fireplace within half-an-hour of receiving them.</p>
<p>He tugged Teddy even closer to his chest, and looked towards Skeeter with a scowl. She smiled brightly at him in return, walking towards him. “And, who’s this?”, she asked, gesturing to baby in his arms. He was about to respond when he realized that her quill was already writing, and he saw flashes of the words, “Harry Potter”, “illegitimate child”, and “deadbeat mother”. He snatched the pad of paper out of the hair with his free hand, turning on her with fire in his eyes.</p>
<p>“He is Teddy Lupin. My <strong><em>godson</em></strong>.”, he said, clenching his teeth, as not to yell. Skeeter flinched slightly, but quickly recovered, grabbing for her quill and paper. He shoved them both in his back pocket, and glared at her to leave, just as Hermione, Luna, and Ginny appeared beside him. Luna took Teddy out Harry’s arms, seeing the anger written all over her friend’s face and they both looked on as their two friends tore Skeeter apart with their words.</p>
<p>When Skeeter had finally left, Hermione turned to him and said softly, “I’m so sorry for that, Harry. Professor McGonagall and Kingsley both assured me that reporters wouldn’t be allowed at the station today. I suppose that Skeeter used her animagus form to slip through any preventive measures.” Harry weakly smiled her and turned to Luna, who was still holding Teddy. Teddy had finally awoken, though he wasn’t surprised. Even the deepest sleepers woke up after a certain amount of yelling. He was gurgling, smiling widely at Luna, and grabbing for her face with his tiny fingers. Harry forgot about everything that had just happened after seeing the adorable sight, and smiled almost uncontrollably. He loved seeing Teddy so happy.</p>
<p>Luna passed Teddy back to him, and he kissed the boy’s forehead affectionately. Turning to his friends, he saw looks of shock and admiration on their faces. Except for Luna, of course, who had seen Harry interact with Teddy many times. The other two, though, were very surprised at the way that Harry was acting like a real father. They had grown up with him, and had never stopped to think that there would be a time after war, had thought even less about any of them being <strong><em>parents</em></strong>. He too, was surprised by some of the things he did. So, instead, he weakly grinned at them, and pulled out his wand to levitate his suitcases.</p>
<p>“Windgardium leviosa,” he muttered, and the suitcases floated off the trolley, less than a foot above the ground. Adjusting Teddy in his arms, he walked onto the train with the suitcases in front of him, and his friends behind him. He walked to the back of the train to the compartments nearest to the restrooms, and set the suitcases down in the last compartment on the right, sitting down for the first time in what felt like hours. He was absolutely exhausted and could probably sleep for hours, if not for Teddy.</p>
<p>Ginny knew exactly what he was thinking and held her arms for Teddy, ordering him to sleep. The train had just started moving when he closed his eyes on the sight of the red-haired girl gushing over his now red-haired godson, and he fell into a deep sleep for the first time in months.</p>
