          <div class="userstuff"><p>He sat smoking at his desk, looking at the necklace laying on his desk, thinking.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Each day was a trip into the unknown for everyone.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s just most of the time we don’t look at it that way.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We think that our daily routines will continue forever.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The commute to work, the stop at the same place for coffee, the lunch at the desk or on stakeout, the trip to the pub with our mates after work—we do the same things over and over without regard for Fate lurking around the corner to plant a bomb at the coffee shop, the pub, in the innocent looking sidewalk bin.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Of course these days it was more likely to be a literal bomb that would explode our lives but even walking across the street meant taking a chance that a speeding cab wouldn’t run us over.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>It was those accidents that made us who we are.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His encounter with an improvised explosive device had permanently crippled him and ensured he lived with pain every day.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That had changed him in many ways.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He wouldn’t have asked Charlotte to marry him if that bomb hadn’t gone off, ending his military career and sending him finally to this little office high in an old building that had seen better days.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She had nursed him during his recovery while he learned to walk again and for once been the rock in their relationship.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It hadn’t lasted.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Charlotte's need for drama and chaos had upended their engagement and he’d finally walked out for good. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>But if that IED had not gone off when it had, what would his life be like today?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Did he want to change that?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was best that he and Charlotte were permanently apart.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Pain was part of life.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He’d like to have his lower leg back and feel strong and invincible again.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But he knew that other things lurked in his future. If he didn’t cut back on the smoking he risked lung damage or a heart attack.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There is always something trying to damage us physically.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Changing just one thing (and he knew he only had one re-roll of the dice) wouldn’t protect him from another physical ailment that could be as damaging or even kill him.</p><p>Would he try to save his mother?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No, that was futile.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Her life was set to Self-Destruct from the moment she was born.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The eternal party girl, she had flirted with danger most of her life.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That was the way she wanted it, and no matter how much she loved her children—and he knew she loved him and Lucy with every bit of her soul—she was never going to waver from her appointment with Death.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If he managed to swerve her off the road briefly, she’d be back on it the next day, headed full throttle toward her destiny.</p><p>Would he try to keep Robin safe?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He could keep her from the appointment with her rapist, send him after another innocent girl, and release her from the traumatic hell she’d endured.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But at what cost?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He would spare her pain but what would that do to her life?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She’d graduate on time, probably go on to a career in psychology, and marry her long-time sweetheart, the black-hearted Matthew.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That way lay pain of a different sort.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She’d find out that Matthew was a cheat in another way and she’d never cross his threshold and bring light to his life every day, to be selfish about it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She might never find the steel within her soul or the career she loved.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That was too high a price to pay to save her from pain.</p><p>He handed the necklace with the hourglass charm back to his visitor who had spent the last half hour smoking a pipe in the visitor’s chair, patiently waiting for him to decide.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“No thanks, Uncle Ted.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Take this back to where you found it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We don’t need to tamper with destiny today.” <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p></div>
