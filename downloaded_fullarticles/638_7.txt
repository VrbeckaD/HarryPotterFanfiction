          <div class="userstuff"><p>When your little, becoming a teenager seems like the start to freedom. You think you'll stay up and out all night but the truth is you will be up all night but instead sobbing because Eliza thought she hadn't done enough or because our beloved Iron Man and Ben Solo deserved so much better than what they got. This is my life. When you're younger the world seems like such a wonderful place but as you get older you realize it's not. Pretty soon you'll be wondering why you let girls in sparkly Ugg's and layered hollister shirts bully you when you were younger.<br/>
High school. The real definition, hell on earth. My high school is in the woods and everyone dresses like it 1996. The thing about school is that were there for about 8 hours a day then about 3 hours of homework, then don’t forget about clubs and sports because we have to be well rounded for colleges, and don’t forget to get that 8-10 hours of sleep to be able to function.<br/>
At this point in the semester my blood is mostly coffee and redbull and I'm sick of the homework and studying getting in the way of my reading, blogging and most importantly fangirling. The life of a fan girl is not for the faint of heart. It takes time and somehow you can know enough facts about the harry potter series to get second place in a city wide tournament at the age of 13 alone but can’t remember what the definition of a parent function is for that math test that’s worth 25% of your grade.<br/>
Welcome to a quiet mess of a fangirl.</p></div>
