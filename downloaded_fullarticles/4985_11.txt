  </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He went to Sirius’ house a week after Halloween. The aftermath and the funeral arrangements, coupled with a full moon shortly after, had lost him another job and he hadn’t had money for rent. He didn’t want to see their old home, but he needed a place to live for a while and he knew that nobody would bother him there.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The sheets smelled of lavender soap (because Sirius liked the smell so that’s all they bought), with a hint of motor oil (because Sirius refused to shower before his middle-of-they-day naps no matter how dirty the sheets got), and mostly of sweat. It hadn’t been a warm October, but Sirius always slept restlessly and twisted and turned in his sleep, sweating, when he was agitated or upset. The dirty-blond gripped the sheets, not needing to kneel down for the smell to overwhelm his nostrils and mind. In his mind’s eye, he could see his old lover on the bed. Those wrinkles on the right side of the bed - that must have been where he had his hand, because the sheets were pulled slightly. The pillow was in the middle of the bed, crumpled into a moon shape because of course it was, Sirius had used it.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He noticed, with a fresh sting of pain going through his body like a Stunning spell, that his own pillow was untouched. It had been pushed to the side a bit during Sirius’ trashing of the sheets but it hadn’t been used the way the rest of the bed had been.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">~FLASHBACK~</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“<em>Sirius, I swear to Merlin, if you touch my pillow again I will hex you so bad, Lily won’t be able to fix it!” Remus growled as he threw aside his pillow cover and grabbed a new one from the linen closet.</em></span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <em>“I don’t see what the issue is! It’s just a pillow!” Sirius responded, throwing up his hands in exasperation.</em>
  </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <em>“I put my head on it and I would like it if it was clean after I come home tired and wanting to sleep in a nice, clean bed - that I washed the sheets for </em>
    <b>
      <em>again</em>
    </b>
    <em> this week, by the way,” his boyfriend responded dryly.</em>
  </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <em>“Moony you’re talking like as if I threw it into the gutter or used it as a flannel. All I did was put it between my legs,” Sirius huffed back. He was frowning now, and his expression was less stubborn.</em>
  </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <em>Remus could tell he had won the argument already by the look in Sirius’ eyes. “I want a nice, cool pillow to put my head on,” he said, a bit more gently this time.</em>
  </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <em>“I honestly don’t see the problem here - you </em>
    <b>
      <em>love</em>
    </b>
    <em> putting your head on my crotch,” Sirius tried to joke, but his smile was not convincing.</em>
  </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>Remus snorted a quick laugh anyway. “I do, but by choice. You of all people should understand why I’d rather smell fresh sheets than your ball sweat, you start moping if I so much as buy a different kind of soap because ‘it </em>smells<em> wrong, Moony’.” His imitation of Sirius at the end was in an exaggeratedly deep, posh voice, making the raven-haired boy smirk.</em></span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <em>“Alright, Moony,” Sirius said, pulling the werewolf towards him by the hips and putting his head on his stomach, as if he is listening to Remus’ body. “I won’t touch your pillow again, I solemnly swear.”</em>
  </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <em>“I believed you until you said ‘solemnly swear’. When have we ever used that non-sardonically since the Map’s creation?”</em>
  </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <em>Sirius looked up at him with an odd look, then. A cross between adoring and astonishment which Remus couldn’t begin to guess why Sirius would feel during this rather boring conversation.</em>
  </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <em>“I promise, Remus. Your pillow will be freshly washed and pressed every time you come home, so long as you keep coming home to me.”</em>
  </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <em>The werewolf rolled his eyes, then hugged his boyfriend’s head since that was all he could reach from where he was standing. “No need to make promises you will hate keeping. Just don’t use it as a pillow for your balls and I will be happy.”</em>
  </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <em>“But my boys need support, Moony,” Sirius fake-whined onto Remus’ stomach.</em>
  </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <em>“I’ll support them,” Remus said in a grave tone. “I’ll make ‘Vote for Padfoot’s Balls’ pins and everything.” </em>
  </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <em>They both started laughing.</em>
  </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <em>~FLASHBACK~</em>
  </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He didn’t know what to do with himself. He wanted to tear the sheets apart, tear <em>himself</em> apart or just break down and cry, holding the pillow close to his chest pretending Sirius was there with him still. And, just a little, he wished that Sirius had killed him along with Peter.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Remus’ hands were not trembling when he reached out for the frame on Sirius’ side of the bed, of the picture of James and Lily the morning of their wedding. He took it firmly into his hands and removed the picture. His hands were still steady when he brought the picture up to his face and brushed his lips gently upon it, as if he were scared of hurting the moving-but-not-alive couple within it who couldn’t even feel anything from the physical world, let alone get hurt by it.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">And when he cried himself to sleep, his tears were for Lily and James.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">~</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He didn’t wash the sheets for much, much longer than an acceptable period of time for a civilized adult (he didn’t know if being a werewolf and technically a beast worked in his favor in this case or not). Not that it mattered, he didn’t sleep in the bed. He slept on the couch and only went into the bedroom when his bones threatened to leave his body they were itching so bad to go there ‘just one more time’ and his breath was so constricted he felt like he was drowning.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“<em>You don’t need water to drown,” he thought to himself, unable to remember where the quote was from.</em></span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He didn’t bother lying to himself and saying he would never go back. He knew he would. The scent, the memory, the <em>essence </em>of the love of his life was there. Of course he would.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Some days he spent hours pretending it was 1980 and talked to an imaginary Sirius about completely mundane things. An hour last Tuesday had been spent on how the bookshop Remus was working at part-time last summer had had the worst organization system he had ever seen. He didn’t know how long Real Sirius would have put up with the conversation, but Imaginary Sirius was a great listener.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Remus would often take the crossword into the bedroom where he felt Sirius’ presence the strongest and try to solve it with the imaginary boy who was much less helpful than the Real Sirius had been.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>Fantastic listener now, better than ever, but seems to have lost his knack for crosswords and trivia, </em>Remus thought to himself and smiled bitterly at his own twisted joke.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Eventually, Aurors came to his door.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Peter,” he said as soon as he opened the door, “Have you found his body?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Good…morning Mr. Lupin,” one of the Aurors said after looking Remus over, obviously thinking he had just woken up, despite the fact that it was late afternoon. “No, we have not recovered a body and do not expect to. We think the finger wasn’t a side-effect of a spell that transported him, we are convinced that whatever explosive spell Black cast, it simply… Missed a spot.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“‘Missed a spot’,” Remus repeated slowly. The two Aurors looked solemn and sincere, but the werewolf couldn’t imagine how somebody could talk about a murder in that way and not be trying to make a joke of it.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“May we come in?” said the other, glancing inside from over Remus’ head.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Am I to be questioned again?” Remus asked, “Because the Full is soon, so you will need to be much quicker this time.” He hoped he sounded nonchalant. In a second, he knew that had, because the second Auror winced. He smiled. Sirius had taught him that, to take pleasure in the uncomfortableness of others about his lycanthropy, if they deserved it. And people who had interrogated him for a week with methods definitely illegal to be used on humans definitely deserved it, in Remus’ mind. James would have thought so.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“No, Mr. Lupin. We are actually here simply to relay a message,” the first Auror said, looking rather bored. “Mrs. Black’s lawyers felt they couldn’t, ah, feel safe talking to you alone.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Remus pretended to look behind the Aurors, although it was obvious there was nobody with them. He raised an eyebrow and looked expectantly at the Auror.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">To his surprise, the Auror chuckled. “I’m Icast,” he said, and raised his hand. “I s’pose introductions are good to have before we ask to enter your home, eh?” He pointed with his head to the other Auror. “He’s Parkinson.” He paused. “Junior,” he added as if to explain why the younger Auror was looking as if he were about to get sick.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Remus looked at Icast’s hand for a while before looking back up. Manners demanded he shake the hand - especially when somebody who knew he was a werewolf offered it to him - but he did not feel sociable today. “How can I help?” he asked instead, although the words ‘Mrs. Black’s lawyers’ had said all that he needed to know.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Icast sighed when he took his hand down, but he seemed bothered by something other than Remus’ lack of courtesy. He shrugged his left shoulder and gave Remus a look as if to say ‘they are making me do this stupid chore I don’t believe in’. The werewolf appreciated that and almost regretted not having shaken his hand. “Mrs. Black, she…” He looked around. “Are you sure we cannot come in? Not that I mind, but I feel… I’m quite certain I could talk more freely inside.” He looked pointedly at his left side, past the Junior Auror.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">At last, Remus gave in and stepped aside to let them in. Parkinson looked so relieved that Remus wondered if it had been whoever was watching them that had put him at unease, and not Remus being a werewolf.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I would offer tea, but I am quite certain I have none left,” he said, without guilt in his tone. They were unexpected guests, after all.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Quite alright, Mr. Lupin,” Parkinson squeaked. Icast smiled at him in approval, visibly pleased that he was talking with Remus.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I’ll cut to the chase, mate,” he said to Remus, “The old witch has pulled every connection she has - not that she needed to, to be honest - to ensure that every cent Sirius Black owns went to her. Although he is not dead yet, since he is sentenced to life in Azkaban with no visitation or potential for a retrial—”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Remus cut him off. “Trial, you mean. There was never one to begin with.” He didn’t know why he was defending Sirius. Dumbledore had shown him all the evidence. A trial would simply have been a legal checkbox to check, if it had happened. The evidence was there and the most trustworthy and wise wizard believed it. What more was there to it?</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Still, part of him couldn’t help but speak up for Sirius in this small way.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Right you are,” Icast said with a small smile, “Trial. Since there is no chance of him getting out of Azkaban, she didn’t need to do much to get him declared legally dead for inheritance purposes.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“His will—” Remus started, then paused. Sirius may have - and probably had - updated it since they spoke of it last. What he remembered was that Sirius had left everything to James and Harry. James was gone, but Harry was still alive. Then he suddenly understood. “Harry is not of age, so she demands the rights to the funds until he is?” he asked.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">At this, Icast looked confused. He looked at the werewolf with furrowed eyebrows for several moments before speaking. “It…” He stopped, then started again as if he had decided to reword his thoughts. “There was a small amount left to Harry Potter, yes. But since he is already the owner of a rather sizable fortune from his own family, the money Mr. Black left him, in his own words, was for ‘fun and games that his mother may be against’.” Another pause. “It was an interesting will, written by himself and not a lawyer, for the most part.” He looked at the ground, then back at Remus. “His will, it… He left ’most everything to you.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“What?” Remus asked before he could stop himself.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“The money in his Gringott’s account, and this house. He left them to you. He also mentioned a cottage in the will but neither Mrs. Black nor the Ministry could find any trace of it. Either it is unplottable and secret, or it is an inside joke. We at the office thought it might be, since the will seemed so full of them.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The werewolf blinked several times. Sirius had left him everything? But they weren’t even—</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“When did he write it? Or rather, when was the most recent copy received by the Ministry?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Icast smiled knowingly. “I understand what you are thinking. The copy was received a month prior to Mr. Black’s arrest.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">If he had been confused before, he didn’t know what to call his state now. What could that mean?</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“One of the reasons for your - er - <em>extensive </em>questioning was the will, actually,” Icast said, and Parkinson looked at him worriedly.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Are we allowed to share that?” he asked nervously.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Icast waved him off. “He won’t tell on us. But you are right to ask; in most cases I would say that no, we should not share investigation information with civilians, especially persons of interest or anybody connected to the crime.” When he turned back to Remus, his ‘teaching voice’ was gone and the gentle tone was back. “We are not allowed to share the will as it is considered evidence. However, I can tell you that he cared about you. Wherever his loyalties regarding James Potter may have lain—”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“He would have killed me before he betrayed James,” Remus cut him off. His mouth had moved without his knowing, again. He cursed himself internally. He had to be more collected. When was the full moon? It must be less than three days now if he was acting like this.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Icast looked pensive again. “If that were so,” he said slowly, “Why didn’t he?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I thought you weren’t questioning me,” Remus shot back, without anger.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I’m not,” the Auror responded, scratching his stubbled chin, “But I have to admit this case intrigues me still, as ‘closed’ as it may be.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Oh?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Anybody I talk to about Sirius Black - even those who hate him - all agree that he loved James Potter. And you seem to agree. You think that he would - <em>kill, </em>you said - his lover than betray him. Yet here we are.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Here we are,” Remus agreed, refusing to give the Auror anything more.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“What do you think happened?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“You weren’t intrigued enough to read my interrogation report?” Remus asked dryly.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I have,” Icast responded, waving a dismissive hand in the air again. “But nobody asked you that directly. They went on and on about if you were still involved with Black, if you had worked for You-Know-Who— Nobody asked what you <em>think</em> happened.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“There’s no way for me to know, is there?” he said tiredly, “We were not speaking when it happened. I hadn’t been his ‘<em>lover</em>’ for a while, by then.” He had stressed the word ‘lover’ as if it were a disgusting thing. He had never liked the term, and he certainly didn’t like it in the context Icast was using it.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I am not asking you to tell me the objective truth. I want to know your theory. What <em>you</em> think happened.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Remus could have waved him off. Told him to get to the point and tell him to get out of the apartment because Walburga wanted it. But he knew that he would never again have a chance to talk about this with anybody, so he decided to indulge, a little. “I think that maybe he didn’t know that James would die,” he said carefully, searching for recognition in the Auror’s eyes.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“You think he was double-crossed,” he replied quickly, and got up to his feet in excitement, nodding as he thought. “You think they— What, Vold— You-Know-Who promised him to only kill Lily Potter?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Remus shrugged. “It was Harry that Voldemort was after.” He watched Parkinson for a reaction at Voldemort’s name. Other than a gulp, he saw none. He turned back to Icast. “Sirius loved Harry too, but he may have been— Perhaps Voldemort told him he would not kill Harry but rather use him or send him far away to make sure he doesn’t interfere.” He sighed. “There is no point speculating. I do not know what happened. But I don’t believe for a second that Sirius intended this outcome.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“You <em>do</em> believe that he worked for Voldemort, though?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Yes,” he said, but shook his head ‘no’. “He was the Secret Keeper. You can’t force that information out. The Imperius Curse would not have worked either.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“You don’t sound surprised.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The werewolf smiled and even without a mirror he could tell that it was one of his sinister ones, the ‘evil’ grin as Peter used to call it. He usually saved it for his Ministry visits. “I have had time to digest. And, well, what else is there to do but accept it?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>I could kill myself</em>, he thought but did not voice. He looked towards the kitchen, wondering if he should have coffee. Not what he wanted, but he really <em>was</em> out of tea.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Icast didn’t look convinced, but dropped the subject. He sat back down, and took a deep breath. “The reason for our visit, Mr. Lupin,” he said, “Is that although Mr. Black left you everything, you are not entitled to it.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Of course,” Remus said, nodding. He wished he had a cup of tea in his hand. It would be a good moment to take a sip to punctuate. “What is the cited reason? I would assume my being a werewolf would be enough, but Walburga is nothing if not thorough.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“That was the main one, yes.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>And the fact that I am a male who can’t produce heirs, a half-blood as well as a half-breed, not legally bound to her dear son— So many things she probably made sure to publicize and stress, </em>Remus thought. He let out a small chuckle.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“She could have just asked,” he said.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Icast frowned. “I don’t know how long you need to vacate but the lawyers were talking about two weeks.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The werewolf thought about it and licked his lips before he spoke. “What’s the date?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Fifth of December,” Parkinson said and Remus was silently grateful he had mentioned the month, too. He would have guessed December if he had had to, but he hadn’t been sure.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“End of month?” he offered, as if the Aurors cared or had any say in it.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Of course,” Icast said and Remus was pleasantly surprised. His surprise must have been evident in his expression because Icast continued talking to clarify. “If I tell them they have to wait a month, they will wait a month.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Thank you, Mr. Icast.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Icast is my first name, actually. Sounds rather odd, saying Mr. Icast,” the Auror said with a huff of a laugh. “And it is no bother, Mr. Lupin.” He got up to leave. “And that is our job done, I s’pose.” He gave his jaw one more scratch and turned to Remus with a curious look that reminded Remus painfully of James, as did the words that came out of his mouth after. “For what it’s worth, I think it is rubbish that you cannot inherit what was specifically left to you in a will.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“If Sirius truly intended to leave it all to me, he should have been smarter,” Remus said, gently. The truth was, Sirius probably <em>had</em> intended it, but had been too childish to think it through. “A smart man would not leave money to a werewolf as simply as ‘he has my Gringott’s account now’. I wasn’t even allowed to put my name on the lease of his house when we moved in.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Icast nodded, but in true Auror fashion kept a suspicious face. They left and Remus put his back against the door, looking at the hallway and wondering what he would do.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Two pairs of Sirius’ boots were sprawled haphazardly against the wall on the left, and a few familiar cloaks hung on the hanger on the right side. There was still two pairs of keys floating right by the cloaks, ready to be grabbed on the way out. Remus had asked Lily to charm a key holder like that because Sirius was hopeless at remembering his keys, and they had warded the house against Apparition.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Everywhere he looked, he saw their life together. He may not have lived here in the months leading to October 31st but he sure had lived there before. The place was remarkably unchanged, except for the lack of Remus’ things left around. No dirty teacups on the coffee table, and none of his clothes in the closet. And yet, whatever he <em>had</em> left behind, had been kept exactly the same. Even the few books he had not bothered packing were laying in the precise way he had left them. Three of them on the bookshelf (one fallen to its side), one on the lower section of the coffee table.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He wondered if Sirius, too, had tried to keep Remus in the house the way Remus was trying to keep Sirius by not disturbing any sign of the Animagus’ existence in the place. Maybe he had missed him, too.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>He broke things off, </em>he told himself, <em>He was working for Voldemort and he shut you out.</em></span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He gritted his teeth and made himself walk to the kitchen, sitting down on an uncomfortable stool. Peter had bought these stools for them, thinking they looked fancy, and they had been too grateful for the housewarming gift to transfigure them.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">A traitorous thought crept into his mind. <em>Maybe he alienated me to protect me.</em></span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He shook his head to get the thought out, and scowled at his own naïveté. Why was he trying to make a martyr out of a murderer?</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Funny, how alone he felt, more alone than ever before, even during his long Order missions. Because back then, there was a home to think of. Friends to see later. And now he had no one. He would transform alone again, with no hope for ever getting a painless full moon in the future. No hope.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Why <em>did</em> you do it?” he asked the empty kitchen.</span>
