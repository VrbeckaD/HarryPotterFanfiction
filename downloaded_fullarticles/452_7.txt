    <p>"Why do you need to know?" Sirius Black asked, rather suspiciously.</p><p>   "W-well I-" Peter Pettigrew began, but could not finish, and could not look his friend in the eye.</p><p>   Sirius' shoulders slumped, and he sighed as he realised.</p><p>   "It's you isn't it?"</p><p>   "I- I-" Peter stammered.</p><p>   "It's you! You're the bloody traitor! You actually thought I would ever give up Lily and James? You thought I'd be so stupid?"</p><p>   Peter just stood there, stuttering and shaking, his lip quivering as though he had no idea where Sirius' anger was coming from, or why it was justified. And then a thought struck Sirius. A horrible thought that hurt deep within his chest, even more than his betrayal.</p><p>   "You- you rat! You let us all believe it was Remus. You let us completely alienate him. Let us blame him because it was easy, and you stood by and did nothing!"</p><p>   "I-I'm sorry. I don't know what I was thinking-"</p><p>   "Bullshit!" Sirius spat.</p><p>   He grabbed the smaller man by the collar of his shirt and dragged him to where the rest of the Order were gathered. There was a clear divide as nobody wanted to associate with who they thought to be the traitor, and nobody was talking. They weren't here to talk. They were here because Sirius was he Potters' secret keeper, and they needed to keep eyes on him should the traitor try to get information from him. Who knew slimy, traitorous gits could be so predictable? So when Sirius pushed Peter into the room, everybody looked up.</p><p>   "It's him."</p><p>   And then: chaos. The more accustomed wizards set to work containing Peter, but Sirius went straight to Remus.</p><p>   "Moony. Moony, I'm so sorry. I should've known. I should've-"</p><p>   Remus cut him off with a hand on his shoulder.</p><p>   "You couldn't have known Sirius. But James and Lily need to know."</p><p>   %%%</p><p>   "Fuck!" Remus spat as he hit the ground.</p><p>   As it turned out, waiting to tell James and Lily would probably have been in their best interest. As soon as they heard, the young couple wanted to be taken back to the rest of the Order. This was the worst idea. The five of them were swarmed by death eaters within minutes of taking to the skies. Curses were slung back and forth over and over. Until it stopped, and they fell.</p><p>   "Lily!" James called out, "I think Lily was hit!"</p><p>   "I wasn't!" came the redhead's near hysterical reply in the dark, "He was going for Harry. I tried to get between them. It hit him; it hit Harry!"</p><p>   "He's alive Lily." Sirius, who had been the one to take Harry, called, "He's alive. But he's... he's hurt."</p><p>   It took a few scrambled moments for them to find each other, though Sirius was the easiest to find, with Harry's sudden cries echoing as he supposedly regained consciousness. As said by his Godfather, Harry was very much alive, but not unscathed. A bloody wound ran across half his face spreading downwards from his forehead. The connecting lines were thin, painting a shocking, heart-shattering lightning strike across his face, but there was a lot of blood.</p><p>   "How did he-" Lily began, taking her small son into her arms, trying to soothe him.</p><p>   "It's over." Remus breathed, "Voldemort. He fell too. The death eaters ran off. He- he-"</p><p>   Disbelieving silence fell over them, but before long, people had come to collect them, and the truth settled in their tired bones and aching heads.</p><p>   Sirius sighed softly, "It's over."</p>
