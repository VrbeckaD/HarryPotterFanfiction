    <p>I switched off the lights and closed the door, locking it behind me before hopping down the steps leading to the store. The days were getting longer, summer close at hand, so I had the setting sun to keep my company as I started making my way home. <br/>The bookshop was the brightest thing on the street, if not the entire town, the sign painted on the large glass window was a glittering gold, the outside wood paneling was a light, chipped yellow, just painted but the wood seemed reluctant to be such a colour. The windows were clean, freshly washed, clear glass showing the bright interior and books in the floor to ceiling shelves, the shelves were painted a pinkish grey, the floor sanded down to light wood, but some the black was still holding on. There was greenery in every corner, along with some sort of seating, large miss-match one seater couches that looked like you could sink quite comfortably into. <br/>It had taken nearly 6 months to get the shop how I liked it, all the money I saved after dropping out of university and spending nearly all my spare days at work since I was 16 was put into the shop. It had taken even longer than that for the town to get used to the store before I started to get a good number of customers, even a few regular, the people of Cokeworth finally warming up to the cheerer shop. <br/>I had always wanted to work with books, I had gone to university to study English but had dropped out, unable to keep up with the stress of classes. It was during my final years of high school that I was playing with the idea that I could one day own my own shop. <br/>My parents had been hesitant for me to pursue this dream, but always supportive of me they helped out here and there, my mom helping to design the shop and decorate, my father going over the legal papers for me. They had yet to see the final product in person, though, but that would be rectified by Christmas. <br/>Cokeworth was a large factory town, rundown, dirty and always cold, no matter if the sun was out or not. The people matched the weather at first, hesitant of new things but with some socializing and one brave person stepping out, they came around to me and the shop. The town didn’t even have a bookshop, much to my horror, and most had to go to the next town over if they wanted a book. I made sure it was always cosy and warm, always welcoming for people to come in and see something then stone and dirt. <br/>It was still cold, so I kept my coat close around me, my yellow scarf wrapped high around my neck to hide my nose in when it got too cold, and an oatmeal beanie in my head with a baby pink puff at the top, my bag hanging on my shoulder.<br/>It had been a year since I had moved to the town, down a mostly deserted street called Spinners End, I had gotten the slightly run-down house for a good price, my dad helping out till I got on my feet.<br/>It had more rooms then I logically needed, but that just meant I had a room just for my books with room to grow. I pained the walls, taking away the wallpaper, and brought in brighter second-hand furniture, and more lights, it very quickly felt like home. <br/>I got to my door, the sun just setting when I noticed the light. It was coming from the house next door, the one I thought to be abandoned. I frowned. I hadn’t heard of any newcomers to town, no gossip I got from Mrs. Leeks, the sweet, but nosey, lady next door, in fact, she hadn’t said anything about the house. I could see someone walking around, a shadow against the curtains. <br/>A cool wind blew over the street and I shivered, realizing I had been standing there for a few minutes. I unlocked my door and stepped into my own house, putting my things down and going straight to the fireplace to start warming up the house. <br/>I made a small dinner and settled in front in the living room, where the fire was going, and ate, a glass of white wine to accompany me, soft music playing from the record player. After I finished eating, washed the dishes and headed upstairs to shower, I returned to the lounge and sat down with a blanket, a book and a cup of tea, before slowly dozing off. <br/>This was the usual routine for me, usually, with me ending up falling asleep on the couch, the book resting on my chest till morning.<br/>I had grown up with my mom, in a small apartment in London, it had been just the two of us till I was 13 and she met her now-husband, Ian. They were madly in love with each other and with Ian’s three sons, all older than me, we became a big family. <br/>From a small apartment to the suburbs of London, with a dog and a cat, it had been a big change, but a good one. Summers at beach houses, winters spent making snowmen in the park, it was the best thing I could have ever had, and I loved my family dearly. <br/>I had made good friends in school, gone out and got drunk when we weren’t supposed to, kissed a few boys, and had a typical teenage life, getting in trouble but still getting good marks in school. <br/>I had never heard of Cokeworth before my friends and I had passed through it on a road trip a year ago, I had seen the empty store and I could picture having a small bookshop there. The town had drawn me in and now I was here. <br/>Most of my friends thought I was crazy, but I was content, I felt like there was something magical about this place, something waiting to be discovered.</p>
