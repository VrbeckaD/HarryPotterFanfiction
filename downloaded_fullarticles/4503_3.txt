    <p>After spending several days in bed, sick and miserable from the countless experiments performed on him, Kefka's health began to slowly improve. His physical health, that is. His mental health, on the other hand, seemed to continue its gradual downhill decent into the land of no return.</p><p>After a while Bellatrix decided that it would be a good idea to give Kefka a bath. He'd been burning up a with a fever, and his body was sweaty and sticky with filth from not bathing. She filled the bathtub with cool water, testing the temperature to make sure it wasn't too cold, then walked into the bedroom and pulled the covers back on the bed.</p><p>Kefka, who was sleeping in a semiconscious daze, barely noticed when Bellatrix lifted him out of bed and carried him to the bathroom. He was still feverish and hot, and a cool bath was just what he needed to refresh his senses. Unfortunately, it refreshed him a little too well, for the minute she stripped his clothes off and sat him in the tub, Kefka came alive with a series of furious shouts and swears.</p><p>"Cold!" he screeched in his high pitched voice. "Cold, cold, cold, cold, cold! What the hell are you doing, Bella?"</p><p>"I'm giving you a bath, you idiot. What does it look like I'm doing?" She picked up a cup and used it to pour water over his head, getting ready to wash his hair for him.</p><p>"I'm perfectly capable of bathing myself," said Kefka, shivering as the cool water trickled down his back and shoulders. He then looked down and noticed that the tub was full of bright pink bubbles. "Bubbles?!" he exclaimed. "I'm a Magitek Knight, a superior being greater than all those that have come before me. How am I supposed to strike fear in the hearts of my enemies when I'm sitting here surrounded by fucking bubbles?"</p><p>"You're not supposed to be striking fear in the hearts of anyone right now," said Bellatrix, squeezing some shampoo into the palm of her hand and massaging it into his scalp. "You're supposed to be concentrating on getting better."</p><p>She scrubbed the filth out of his blond hair, then filled the cup and started pouring more water over him.</p><p>"Bellatrix!" Kefka shouted. "Did you not hear me when I said that shit is cold?"</p><p>The crazed witch had had enough of his profanity laced outbursts. She put her hand on his head and shoved him under the water, holding him under for several seconds before pulling him out by the hair.</p><p>"Are you done whining, Kefka?" she asked.</p><p>Kefka glared at her, his long hair plastered to his scalp and his cheeks filled with sudsy bath water. A stream of water flowed from his lips as he spit the water out, still frowning and looking most displeased, but at least he was quiet now.</p>
