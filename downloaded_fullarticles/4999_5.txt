    <p>Laughter </p><p>Prior to befriending Jacob I was only familiar with three types of laughter. Mocking laughter, sympathetic laughter, and dismissive laughter, all of which I first observed during my time at Hogwarts. However, through close observance of my newly acquired friends, I have found that eachof them laughs in their own unique way. </p><p>Jacob laughs the most when he is nervous. I've observed that whenever he is lost for words, overwhelmed, or generally nervous he laughs. It's a diversionary tactic. An attempt at seeming less terrified than he actually is. I have noticed that he seems to do it the most when talking to or about Queenie. I can only assume that something about her must terrify him very much. </p><p>Speaking of the younger Miss Goldstein, she seems to always be laughing. (Perhaps a more accurate descriptor would be giggling?) Whenever she's happy or amused the laughter seems to bubble up out of her. Due to her impressive mind reading skills she has a habit of bursting into giggles during moments of silence, having overheard a particularly amusing thought. (Often one of her elder sister's. I'm starting to think it's their way of talking about me and Jacob when they don't want us to know.) </p><p>While her younger sister seems to be giggling her way through life, Porpentina Goldstein saves her laughter for special moments. Tina tends to express her amusement through small smiles and quiet chuckles. Moments of actual laughter are few and far between, but well worth the wait. In fact, we'd been friends for several months before I heard her laugh for the first time. 

-Newt Scamander
</p><p>Â </p><p>                                                   Newt Scamander and the Laughter Experiment </p><p>It was Jacob who managed it first. He was halfway through retelling the story of he and Newt's Erumpent adventure in the Central Park Zoo*, when Tina let out a very un-Tina-like giggle, which quickly dissolved into full out laughter. Both Newt and Jacob stared at her in surprise. </p><p>"Are you okay?" Newt asked, perplexed by this unusual behavior. </p><p>"Yes!" Tina gasped, "It's just...I mean...you..and the...the mating dance..and you're just so...so serious...it's funny." </p><p>Usually Newt would have been bothered by someone laughing at him like that, but something about the way Tina laughed made him see how amusing the Erumpent mating dance must look to everyone else. </p><p>"Yeah," he chuckled, "yeah I suppose it is." </p><p>Tina beamed at him, cheeks flushed from laughter, and he was hit with a sudden desire to hear her laugh again**. So Newt decided to conduct an experiment to figure out how to make Tina laugh***.</p><p>Back before he'd been kicked out of Hogwarts Newt was always getting himself into sticky situations that his classmates found amusing. He'd always been rather clumsy, and he'd observed that his classmates found it hilarious when he knocked over ink wells and goblets or tripped**** and fell into cauldrons and down flights of stairs, even if he didn't do it on purpose. And of course everyone had found his strange obsession with magical creatures odd. </p><p>He decided to start there, figuring if he rambled on about Erumpent for long enough she'd find it amusing. (After all, it was his Erumpent mating dance that had made her laugh in the first place.) </p><p>"I first observed the Erumpent during my travels through Africa," Newt informed her one afternoon over lunch, "They're fairly commonplace there, although African witches and wizards tend to stay away from them because of their horns." </p><p>"What about their horns?" Tina asked. </p><p>"Well they contain this sort of fluid that, when injected into objects, usually makes them explode. And they can pierce through metal, so it's really best to stay away from them just in case. They're usually quite docile. Although there are some people who think it best to just get rid of them all. Of course those are generally the people who get mauled. But it's a pretty big problem, considering their numbers are naturally low due to the large number of males who end up exploding during mating," </p><p>"So is that how you learned that ridiculous mating dance," Tina asked, "You watched some poor male Erumpent get blown up?" </p><p>"Well...erm...yes," Newt said, "I used to have two." </p><p>"Fascinating," Tina said. </p><p>Something about the way she said it made him believe she really did find Erumpent mating habits interesting, Still, she hadn't laughed, which was discouraging. Usually he stuttered more when telling people about his beasts, but he felt comfortable talking to Tina. Maybe that was the problem. </p><p>Spilling things didn't work either. He'd just made her mad at him. Granted, he probably shouldn't have spilled ink all over her very important MACUSA papers. He decided not to try a second time. </p><p>After much consideration he decided the best plan of action would be to trip down the stairs while carrying a load of books. </p><p>Jacob didn't approve of the plan. ("If you want to make her laugh just tell her a joke or something.") Newt knew from experience that people didn't find it very funny when he tried telling jokes. He also knew from experience that they did find it funny when he fell down stairs. He decided to go with that he knew. He just underestimated how long the flight of stairs was. And he'd forgotten how hard it is to catch yourself when carrying an armload of books. Two miscalculations which resulted in him hitting his head rather hard on the way down. </p><p>"Newt! Are you okay?!" </p><p>Newt sat up, blinking, and tried to make sense of the two very worried looking Tinas swimming before his eyes. Neither one seemed to be laughing. </p><p>"I'm fine," he said, focusing on the Tina he thought was real, "Just a little phased." </p><p>"You're bleeding," Tina told him, brow furrowed, "I think you might have a concussion." </p><p>Newt nodded. She was pretty when she was worried about him. He wanted to tell her but before he could she was hoisting his arm around her shoulders and pulling him up from the floor and helping him back into her apartment. </p><p>"We oughta clean that cut up," she said, sitting him down at the kitchen table. She began bustling about the kitchen, grabbing bandages and a jar of ointment. "I wish Queenie were here," she fretted, "she's so much better at this sort of stuff." </p><p>"Sorry Tina," Newt mumbled sheepishly, as she began to dab at the cut on his forehead with a damp cloth. </p><p>"Hush," Tina said, pushing the jar of bright pink ointment across the table towards him, "Put this on that cut." </p><p>"No really, I'm sorry," Newt insisted, dabbing the pink salve onto his forehead. </p><p>"There's nothing to apologize for," Tina said, "It was an accident." </p><p>"Erm...about that," Newt said, "It might not have been an accident." </p><p>"What do you mean?" Tina asked, brow furrowing again, "You fell down the stairs on purpose?" </p><p>"Something like that, yeah," Newt admitted. </p><p>"Why?" </p><p>"I thought it would make you laugh." He said, staring down at the table to avoid her angry gaze.</p><p>There was a long silence before Tina spoke again. </p><p>"Let me check you for a concussion." </p><p>Newt nodded, allowing her to shine her wand into his eyes. </p><p>"I think you should be fine. Although you should be glad you weren't seriously hurt," she scolded. </p><p>Newt nodded. </p><p>"I'm glad you're okay," she said gently. Then she smacked him hard on the shoulder. "Don't ever do anything like that again! Why the hell would I find that funny?!"</p><p>"It seemed to amuse people back at Hogwarts," Newt explained. </p><p>The anger on Tina's face melted away, replaced by a look of sadness and sympathy. "Oh Newt," she breathed. </p><p>"I might have miscalculated a bit," he admitted. </p><p>"Newt, I'm your friend, I'm not going to laugh if you've really hurt yourself." </p><p>"Ahh, you see, that's the problem," Newt said, "I didn't have any of those back at Hogwarts." </p><p>"That must have been awful," Tina said. </p><p>"Not really," Newt assured her, "I usually prefer beasts to humans." </p><p>Tina smiled and sat down in the chair next to him. "Tell me about it." </p><p>"What?" </p><p>"Tell me about Hogwarts." </p><p>"I wouldn't know where to start. What have you already heard?" He asked. </p><p>"I know you have four houses, just like Ilvermorny, but I don't know how you get sorted into them." </p><p>"We've got a hat," Newt explained. </p><p>"A hat?" Tina asked. </p><p>"Yes, a sorting hat." </p><p>"How does a hat sort you into houses?" Tina asked. </p><p>"Well, it sits on your head and decides which house you should go into based on the thoughts it finds there," Newt explained.</p><p>"It talks?" </p><p>"Sometimes it sings." </p><p>Tina looked at him like he was insane. </p><p>"Well of course it talks, how else is it supposed to tell you which house you belong in?" Newt said. </p><p>"Okay, let's say I believe you. What house did it say you belonged to?" She asked. </p><p>"Hufflepuff," Newt said proudly, puffing out his chest a little. </p><p>"Hufflepuff?" Tina scoffed, "What sort of name is Hufflepuff?" </p><p>"A very good one, thank you very much," Newt said. </p><p>"What are the other houses?" Tina asked. </p><p>"Ravenclaw, Gryffindor, and Slytherin." </p><p>"Oh that's hilarious!" Tina said, "Where in the world did you come up with those?" </p><p>"They're the names of the four founders. Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, Godric Gryffindor, and Salazar Slytherin." </p><p>"We've got four founders as well," Tina told him. </p><p>"Of course, because your school is basically a discount Hogwarts." </p><p>"Hey!" Tina said, "At least our house names aren't ridiculous. I think you'd like them, they're all named after magical creatures." </p><p>"Oh yeah? What house were you in?" Newt asked. </p><p>"Wampus," Tina said.</p><p>"That's no better than Hufflepuff!" Newt exclaimed. </p><p>"The Wampus happens to be a very powerful magical creature," Tina told him. </p><p>"A powerful magical creature with an absolutely ridiculous name!" </p><p>"Well at least we don't have a singing hat!" </p><p> "What about ghosts? Do you have those at your precious Ilvermony?"  </p><p>"No, but we've got a Puckwudgie named William," Tina told him. </p><p>And at that they both dissolved into laughter.</p>
