    <p>“Alaska! We're in Alaska?” shouted Harry as he and Draco fell with a thud as they finished their apparition. </p>
<p>“Yes Potter. Quite observant you are” said Draco with sarcasm heavily placed into his words. </p>
<p>Harry looked around and noticed they were in a small room decorated in the style of a log cabin. The walls were wooden and the bed and nightstands were all hand carved from local trees. The fireplace at the end room was ablaze and seemed to not only warm the room but to calm the two newlyweds as well. </p>
<p>“Harry” came a soft voice. “Can you...can you help me to the bed?” Draco cringed at the thought of asking his husband for help but the pain had become unbearable and if he stood much longer he would collapse right then and there.</p>
<p>“I'll do ya one better” he smirked and let out a small laugh when Draco yelped, feeling himself being picked up bridal style by his new husband. Harry gently eased him onto the bed.</p>
<p>“ Why Harry Potter-Malfoy, how thoughtful you are.” He instantly put his head on the pillow and let out a heavy sigh. His whole body wracked with pain. Every nerve seemed to be in a frenzy. </p>
<p>The healer at St. Mungo's had told him this would be a lifelong consequence of being put under the Cruciatus Curse and the diagnosis had sent Draco into a downward spiral of depression and darkness. </p>
<p>Then as if fate just wanted to punish Draco even more, Harry Potter, bane of his existence, had jumped into the role of caregiver once he had heard the news. To Draco's surprise Harry didn't pity him and treated him like he was just a regular person. He pushed Draco when he felt he needed a push but pulled back when Draco felt smothered. </p>
<p>As the months flew by, Draco and Harry had settled into an easy routine and it wasn't long before the two became involved. Despite the backlash from family and friends, the couple carried on and grew even more in love. Though Draco would always be fragile, mentally he was strong enough to handle Harry's PTSD and his bouts with depression.  Together, they balanced each other out and while they still quarreled like school girls, it was done more out of jest than anything else.</p>
<p>Draco felt the bed dip lower as Harry arranged himself beside his lover. He softly held Draco in his arms and Draco couldn't help but feel this would be the start of a wonderful vacation.</p>
<p>Just then, a myriad of lights lit up the somewhat dark room. Harry got up and the opened the giant wooden doors which led to a balcony. His eyes widened with delight as he watched the various ethereal lights dance across the sky.</p>
<p>“Draco! Oh my gosh you have to come look at this!” Draco tried to ease himself out of the bed, but the pain engulfed him and he let out a small whimper. Without any hesitation, Harry came to his aid. </p>
<p>“Shhh my love. I've got you.” Harry scooped Draco into his arms and carried him to the balcony. Draco's eyes lit up when he saw the magnificent blues and greens swirl around the sky. He sighed and clung to Harry even more.</p>
<p>“You're right Harry. It's beautiful. I've never seen anything like it!” Harry nodded in agreement. Then, as if inspired by the gentle moving patterns of light, he began to dance around the balcony. He knew Draco didn't have the strength to dance but he didn't mind dancing for them. He would do everything in his power to make sure they had a fabulous vacation.</p>
<p>Draco noticed the light spins as Harry gently spun with him in his arms. His hold around Harry's neck intensified when he realized what Harry was doing. </p>
<p>“Harry?” he said nervously. “What are you doing?” His voice was so faint he wondered if Harry had even heard him. </p>
<p>“I'm dancing with you, you prat” Harry said laughing. “This night is full of magic and what better way to celebrate the magic of our marriage then by dancing.”</p>
<p>He pulled Draco even closer to him and continued his dance. He knew Draco would always be in pain and more often than not, very fragile. But Merlin did he love him. Draco was now his husband and Harry promised he would dance the rest of his life with Draco through the dips and the lifts.</p>
