<p>          <em>She could hear the sound of crashing through the downstairs, Jamie’s shout, and the mad cackle of the Dark Lord as he snarled the unforgivable curse. “Avada Kedavra!” There was a strangled noise, and the sound of her husband’s body hitting the ground. Lily choked her grief down; there’d be time enough for that later. She raced for the nursery, Harry’s frantic cries ringing in her head as she slammed the door closed and warded it quickly. She reached for her son, but the door slammed open before she could wrap her arms around him, the wards snapping with a crackle and a shattering of wood. </em></p>
<p>
  <em>          “You think you can save him? How quaint.” Tom Riddle stood before her, his handsome face pale and twisted. He barely looked human anymore, his eyes holding a cold red glow as he stared her down. “Stand aside, and you shan’t take the road of your lover.”</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>          Lily straightened her shoulders and raised her wand, facing him with the absolute certainty that her chances of surviving were minimal, but knowing she couldn’t just let him have her son. She took a deep breath, calling forward as much of her power and focus as she could, visualizing it as a blue shield. She barely heard the madman’s retort, seeing his lips curl up into a snarl of contempt, then the flash of green light. It hit the shield and crackled, the force of it knocking her back into Harry’s crib. Her son let out a terrified shriek of pain, and her own vision dimmed as pain blossomed down her body.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>          Riddle snarled, taking a step forward before slashing his wand down, the rapid-fire volley of explosive jinxes doing their job and shattering her shield, sending it dancing through the air in visible, sparking pieces. The Dark Lord’s fury was thick in the air, a physical presence as he jerked his arm diagonally through the air, the cutting curse finding its way through her neck and chest. He slashed again, and she screamed, feeling the flesh of her shoulders split down to the bone.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>          Harry was crying for her, his wails getting louder and more frantic, his little legs shaking as he gripped the railing of the crib. Lily stepped in front of him one last time, locking eyes with the man who sought to take everything she held dear. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>          “You can’t have him,” she breathed, and closed her eyes, drawing on every last bit of magic she still possessed, reaching deeper than she ever had before. She felt the killing curse pass through her, and she let go, sending the volley of power back to Riddle with a prayer to whoever may be listening.</em>

<p> </p>
<p>         “Long day, love?” Darcy kicked off her shoes and leaned against the door of her New York home, breathing in the soft smells of warmth, fresh spices of cooking food, and the people she loved the most. She smiled over at Sirius as her dark-haired friend peeked around the hallway to greet her. “You look absolutely exhausted.”</p>
<p>          Darcy snorted, rolling her eyes as she levered herself away from the door to go toward the kitchen where she hoped there’d be tea and something sweet to nosh on. “Dude, for a multi-billion-dollar company, SI does a shit job of making sure they move delicate equipment properly. I had to hold Jane back from stabbing one guy with a pencil when he dropped Old Betsy in the corner. He made a stupid comment about it being a pile of junk, and she just went for it.”</p>
<p>          Sirius laughed and shook his head, leaning down to kiss the top of her head as she poured her tea, which, bless him, he’d had hot and ready for her. “There’s biscuits in the tray. Rem made them this morning. He’s upstairs wrestling with your son, trying to trick him into a bath.”</p>
<p>          “We’re back to hating baths again?” Darcy sighed and shook her head, tugging off the knit hat she’d worn over her curls. It had taken some getting used to, but the dark hair had grown on her over the last four years. There wasn’t much left of Lily Evans Potter, the achingly young woman who’d faced down a mad terrorist and somehow managed to live. In the aftermath of that Halloween, her entire life had changed- the only ones who even knew she was still alive were Sirius, Remus, the goblins at Gringotts, and Severus Snape. Poppy Pomfrey had known at one time, but she’d willingly allowed herself to be obliviated to protect the young widow and the child they would have called their savior.</p>
<p>          Severus had found her just in time, saving her from bleeding out with a quick counter-curse and a frantic fire-call to Hogwarts and Madame Pomfrey. He knew it was only a matter of time before everyone knew what happened to the Dark Lord, and he wasn’t stupid. By the time Lily had awakened in a darkened area of the school infirmary, Harry asleep in the cot next to her, her old friend had swallowed his pride and contacted the other half of the Marauders, sans the coward turncoat Pettigrew.</p>
<p>          Two weeks later, Lily and Harry Potter were laid to rest in Godric’s Hollow next to James, their family plot complete. Darcy and Harrison Lewis had boarded a plane bound for the US, fresh papers forged by the best and most discreet solicitors Gringotts had on staff. All of the Potter wealth was transferred to the MACUSA branch under their new names, and Darcy had begun her journey as a young, single mother trying to figure out her life. She’d never appreciated how powerful the goblin nation actually was until they wrapped her and her son in their protection. They had taken care of everything, including wand permits and magical passports in their new identities.</p>
<p>          Darcy Lewis was a middle-class American witch with mediocre talent and minimal magical education. Not worth much of a look, given that she’d completed her education under the tutelage of an aunt after her parents were killed in a no-maj car accident. On the books, she had taken her exams independently and scored middle of the road. Off the books, and if anyone had cared to dig any deeper, she’d taken to no-maj education and worldly pursuits like a lot of her generation. Other than needing access to the wizarding underworld for necessities, she was more or less mundane.</p>
<p>          It hadn’t been long after their departure for America that Sirius and Remus joined her and Harry, the two of them doing what they could to cover all the bases to make sure no one questioned the ruse. It had been a near thing with Albus Dumbledore, the old wizard crafty enough to know that he wasn’t completely in the loop, but not pushing for all the answers just yet.</p>
<p>          A year of moving from place to place had made sure no one from home could track them if they got the notion, then Darcy and Remus had started with college, while Sirius had stayed at home to take care of little Harry. Their routine settled and more or less happy, the small family grew closer and more comfortable. And then, she’d had the brilliant idea to take an internship with one Dr. Jane Foster and got sucked into the world of alien gods and superheroes.</p>
<p>          “Unfortunately, <em>someone</em> allowed him to watch a program on the bloody Titanic. That kid has an imagination that rivals yours,” Sirius huffed. He tossed his long hair back out of his face and waved a butter knife in the air. “He’s convinced he’s going to drown if he’s even three feet from the blasted water.”</p>
<p>          Darcy snickered and shook her head. “I’ll go up and see what I can do. You and Rem can take off for the night if you want? I know I haven’t been home a lot, and you guys have taken the brunt of Harry-duty. It’s your turn to go do something away from here.”</p>
<p>          “Don’t you have to go back into work tomorrow? Your Jane said something about it taking at least a week to get everything sorted and set up. Somehow, I don’t see her letting just anyone near her shady contraptions.”  </p>
<p>          “Hey, I built most of those <em>shady contraptions</em>, I’ll have you know!” Darcy tried to sound annoyed but couldn’t quite make it. She snorted. “Okay, so they’re a little shady, but they work! You just have to be nice to them, okay?”</p>
<p>          “Yeah, yeah. So, what about you going in? Don’t you need us back to babysit the prongslet?”</p>
<p>          It used to hurt her to hear Sirius call Harry that, the reminder of James a sick blow. But now it was a comfort, a reminder that her little boy was just as much his father as he was her. The last two Marauders made sure to tell stories about their school days to Harry, funny tidbits about his father’s escapades as well as some of the lessons they’d learned. Darcy tried not to be around when they spoke of her husband. She knew that the boys worried about her, and they’d tried to talk to her about it before, but Darcy had politely and lovingly shut them down. She didn’t know if she’d ever be okay with speaking about James.</p>
<p>          “Nah, Stark has a free daycare center set up for his employees. Bulletproof walls and windows and all. I got the walk through today when Jane and I finally got the full tour. It’s one of the perks. It was also in my contract to have an apartment on the upper floors near Jane and the other Avengers, being that my official title was expanded from Jane-Wrangler to Avengers-Wrangler once Pepper Potts witnessed my finesse in de-escalating tantrums, bullying said physicist into eating, and the epic bag of wonders I manage to keep on me at all times. I said thanks but no thanks.”</p>
<p>          “You turned down living quarters at Stark Tower?” Sirius’s eyebrows rose up into his hairline. “Why? They have more security than we could ever dream of, Darce.”</p>
<p>          “And cameras <em>everywhere</em>, Sirius,” she pointed out, dropping the biscuit she’d just picked up to nibble on, appetite fading. “It’s hard enough keeping the glamour up all the time as it is, let alone having to make sure I don’t ever let it drop, even at home. Stark is a nosy bastard, and I think he’s already labeled me as someone with a past. No, I’m good here with you guys. Unless you and Rem want to go somewhere else? I wouldn’t blame you, this isn’t really something you signed up for, with me being gone all the time with Jane, and with Norse gods falling out of the sky and weird superheroes to hide from-.”</p>
<p>          “Hey, hey, there, poppet,” Sirius stopped her gently, his hands going to her shoulders. “No, Mama, that’s not what we want. I was just thinking about the extra security. You and Harry wouldn’t be as exposed living in Stark Tower, and if anyone from home decided to come after you, they’d play merry hell getting through all those muscled assassins.”</p>
<p>          Darcy leaned her head against his shoulder and sighed, closing her eyes. “I can’t risk anyone finding out that I’m not really who I say I am. And besides, you’d miss us too much.”</p>
<p>          Sirius kissed the top of her head, and she slapped his chest when he retorted, “Sure, who else chucks the post before anyone else has a chance to see the headlines? I’d go starkers without someone to obsessively worry about.”</p>
