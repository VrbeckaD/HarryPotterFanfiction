    <p>The students were all excited as their famous teacher walked to the front of the class. Whispers of anticipation grew louder:</p>
<p>"I can't believe we're going to be taught by Harry Potter... "the" Harry Potter, can you believe it?" - said a raven-haired Hufflepuff boy.</p>
<p>"I know. My uncle Ernie told me Professor Potter taught him how to duel, and he was on Dumbledore's Army and fought in the Battle of Hogwarts alongside him" - responded a small girl with rounded and excited eyes.</p>
<p>Harry Potter reached the front of the class and, smiling, waited for the students to calm down. He looked delighted to be there. Most eyes darted immediately to his forehead looking for the famous lightning bolt scar that they all have seen in the Chocolate Frog Cards, on the cover of famous books and biographies, and countless articles of The Daily Prophet about his life, the defeat of the Dark Lord Voldemort and the countless dark wizards apprehensions he had achieved on his career as an Auror.</p>
<p>But it is one thing to look at images of our heroes, and an altogether issue to be face to face with them. Some of the students were still with their mouths slightly open, in disbelief that the most famous wizard of their time was about to start teaching them how to defend themselves from the most wicked and evil spells wizard kind invented.</p>
<p>Harry Potter looked at his students and was suddenly reminded of a conversation he had in this same castle some 20 years earlier</p>
<p>"I'm talking about you teaching us Defence Against the Dark Arts" – said Hermione</p>
<p>"But I'm not a teacher..." – he countered</p>
<p>A lifetime had passed since the first lessons of the Dumbledore's  Army. Harry was still not sure if he was a teacher. It was time to found out.</p>
<p>"Welcome to your first Defence Against the Dark Arts lesson at Hogwarts." – he said smiling at his students.</p>
<p>"I remember being in your place. Wondering what cool spells I would learn, or what dark creatures would we study. But the dark arts are more than spells, curses and nightmarish creatures. To defend yourselves, you need to understand that books alone won't help you. You need to train. To learn to be vigilant. To understand and control your fears, knowing that a mistake can cost your life. That's why I'm here. To teach you how you can identify dark magic, and how you can protect yourselves from it."</p>
<p>The students were silenced. They drank every word he said with rapt attention and were eager to hear more from him.</p>
<p>"I've always been more adept of practical lessons than lectures. But, my adventures, to give them a more pompous name, also taught me that understanding the principles of a spell will save a lot of trouble in learning it. So, if you please can turn to page 35 of your book, we can start to understand more about our subject of today's' lesson."</p>
<p>A quick shuffle of book pages filled the room as the students tried to be the first to reach page 35.</p>
<p>"Expelliarmus?" – cried the raven headed boy – "That's a basic spell. I've already learned it. My cousin taught me last summer."</p>
<p>Harry smiled.</p>
<p>"A basic spell, yes. But one that can save your life. It saved mine. Twice. Against Voldemort".</p>
<p>The boy didn't seem too impressed or even to believe Harry.</p>
<p>"Expelliarmus!"</p>
<p>The book flew out of the boy's hands as it was struck by a jet of red light out of Harry's quickly drawn wand. With the skill and reflexes of a seeker, Harry caught the book in mid-air and put it back on the desk of his awestricken student.</p>
<p>Harry proceeded as if nothing of extraordinary happened.</p>
<p>"Expelliarmus is a defensive charm, used to disarm your opponent..."</p>
