    <p>The room was dusty and dark, barely any light was available, and the little that was there seeped in from underneath the door. The room housed many toys, possibly hundreds. The one thing they all had in common, was that they were in some way broken or ruined. From the guitar that pitifully lent up against the wall with frayed and broken strings, to the headless toys and teddy bears piled up on an overflowing shelf. The room was the perfect picture of a graveyard for toys.</p>
<p>At first, there was no life to be seen in the room, just a barren and dark storage room. And yet, a quiet, almost muffled whispering could be heard from the corner, where a mattress lay upon the floor with a raggedy blanket on top. A small, almost wisp of a girl was huddled into the corner, the blanket draped over her form. A vain attempt at keeping out the cold. Her body was racked with raging shivers, and she looked like her whole body would break into two if they continued. Teeth chattered harshly as she valiantly carried on reading from a small and faded book that she clutched tightly between both hands. Her eyes squinted down at the coloured and aged pages, the miniscule amount of light doing nothing to aid her.</p>
<p>Her knees were drawn up towards her chest, and attempt at keeping out the chill that filled the room. A flash of light from outside illuminated her face, catching onto her eerie green eyes, almost like emeralds. They showed pain and sadness as clear as ones reflection in a mirror that had just been polished to perfection. Her wild mane of black curls, waves and ringlets were snarled and knotted, matted to her head. They had clearly not been washed or brushed for some time. Her clothes were tattered, holy and clearly second or third hand. A pair of black leggings, with white paint stains and torn up knees along with an old and ratty band top, it was black with a blue design of a baby swimming, and originally designed to be oversized, but on her it swamped her whole body.</p>
<p>She had found clothes in a nearby charity shop, and the woman who volunteered inside had clearly taken pity upon the young girl who had stood before her in boys clothing over three sizes too big, and had let her take them and a few other pieces for free. In return, the young girl helped out in the shop with tagging items upstairs and sorting them into piles once a week for a few hours. The situation benefited the both of them in some way. The lady, Delia had a little helper, and the small girl had an escape from her home, and therefore her family. It suited the pair of them.</p>
<p>The girl shifted, sucking in a deep breath as she accidently hit the wall. It created a quiet, almost unnoticeable thumping noise. When she noticed that nothing had happened afterwards, she released her breath and continued to move until her legs were crossed and her book was resting in her lap. A slender finger reached out and quietly flicked the page over, revealing another page of writing, unlike the typed font of most books, this was clearly handwritten. The sharp and clearly practiced handwriting was emphasised with small ink blots across the page. But it wasn’t the subject matter that had drawn the young girl to this specific book. Transfiguration, a type of magic which involved turning one thing into something else, from what she had grasped. No, it had been the name that had enticed her into opening the book and delving into the handwritten notes and plans. The name that had been carefully printed on the first page of the book, underneath the word Diary, which had been crossed out and renamed ‘Transfiguration Journal’ above it.</p>
<p>James Potter.</p>
<p>Her father.</p>
<p>Her father had wrote in this book, he had filled it with his own imaginative and creative ideas and plans, he had recorded a multitude of funny, serious and important experiences that he had gone through. And he had left it to her. The young girl had found it a few years ago, buried deep inside of a trunk in the attic that she had been forced to clean. There were other books to, documenting different lessons that her father had apparently taken when he had gone to school. A place named Hogwarts. She wasn’t too sure if the whole thing was real or made up. But either way, the fact that her father had made sure that she had something to document her parents meant the world to her. To go with the Transfiguration book, there was also a Defence, Charms, Potions and Care of Magical Creatures book. That was the one that clued her into the whole magic aspect. Lastly, was a small tattered guide that had clearly been annotated over multiple times and treasured above all others. Quidditch through the Ages. She hadn’t know what Quidditch even meant before she had read it, that hadn’t been taught at her school. But it had fascinated her.</p>
<p>To compliment the books that had been left to her by her father, which while containing interesting and useful notes, was mainly filled with humorous stories and ideas for pranks and practical jokes, was another set of books. These had clearly been cared for in comparison to her fathers, as they barely looked like they had aged. While her fathers had all been handwritten and his own, these were actual text books that had been annotated on with helpful, informative and academic notes. These were her mothers. Lillian Evans had been clearly written in the top left hand corner of each book, and there were more of them then her fathers. Astronomy, Arithmancy and Ancient Runes. The handwriting was more delicate, curved and feminine. Tiny doodles had been made throughout the book, enough to let her know that her mother hadn’t harboured any artistic abilities unlike her father. Her father could clearly draw. In fact, he clearly took any opportunity to do so that was presented to him. Inside of the Transfiguration Journal there was a beautiful drawing on the page adjacent to his last entry. It was a ghostly looking stag. It stood tall and proud looking almost ethereal. It was stunning. Underneath was just one word, written in her father’s neatest handwriting, Prongs.</p>
<p>The last entry was a letter. A letter that had been clearly written with his daughter in mind. While there were few ink splodges on this entry, there were areas where the pages were almost wrinkled, and the ink had bled slightly. Almost as if her father had been crying when he had sat down to write it. To her, it made it mean more to her, it was more sentimental. She had first read that entry when she was seven years old. And now, just minutes away from her eleventh birthday, she read them again. Stroking her fingers over the pages as she whispered the words that she had long since committed to her memory.</p>

  <em>My dearest and most precious Ria,</em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>I always knew that I would have children, it was what was expected of me from such a young age, to carry on the Potter name and to bring pride to the Potter name as my ancestors did before me. But I always expected that my children would be boys that I would have little mini me’s running all around the house, and later Hogwarts, wreaking havoc and causing trouble as often as possible. But when you were born, it wasn’t what I had expected, Potters always had sons first, so I already knew that you were special before anyone else. But know that I’ve never regretted you.</em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>Baby star, you are more than I had ever expected and wished for, and I love you so much more than you could ever believe. I hope that I will have all the time in the world to show you just how much I love and cherish you. In fact, if I get one wish, it would be to see you grow up from my beautiful little baby girl into a wonderful young woman. But even if I don’t get that chance, then I want you to know that I am so proud of you already, and I’ll always be proud of you no matter what. Even if you’re sorted into Slytherin when you get to Hogwarts I will love you more than anything, because I know how special you are baby star. You deserve the world sweetheart, and I’m going to try and give you it, even if your mummy says that you’ll turn out spoilt.</em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>I want you to know baby star, that I will always love you, no matter what. You will always be the brightest shining star in my world and no matter what happens, I will always be there for you. Whether it is in person as your guide and teacher on how the world works, or even from somewhere else. If I can’t be with you physically, know that I will always be there in your heart darling, and you will always be in mine.</em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>I don’t want to leave you baby star, I want you to know that more than anything. Bad things have been happening in our world baby, and daddy has to help to try and fix it. I’m going to try with everything I have to stay with you baby star, but, if I can’t and have to leave you, know that I never wanted to. Know that you are always in my thoughts and I’m fighting to come home to you every time that I have to leave. I want you to know that I’m fighting for you to have a better future and the best life possible. You are my reason for fighting baby star.</em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>Mummy and daddy love you so much baby girl, and I hope that no matter what happens to me, you will get the life you deserve. One filled with joy and happiness, the best life possible. Because baby star, you deserve it more than anyone else in the world. Daddy has to go now, but I will always be there with you, in your heart. If you ever feel lonely, look up at the stars and know that daddy is up there, watching over you and making sure that you’re safe.</em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>I love you so much Hana-Hesperia Lilliana Potter, and I always will, no matter what. Aim for the moon baby, because you deserve the best. Soar above everyone, and strive for your dreams.</em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>I love you baby star, my sweetest Ria.</em>

<p>Tears trickled down her cheeks as she silently cried, reading the last few words she clutched the book to her chest, pretending that it was her father, her daddy that she was holding close to her, and not a book. She couldn’t work out how he could be proud of her. She was nothing, a freak. Even if magic was real, like her mum and dad had learnt, she clearly wasn’t good enough to live in their world. Why else would she be left with Aunt Petunia, Uncle Vernon and their son Dudley? Her family that didn’t tolerate anything being different, and they couldn’t stand her. They didn’t even call her by her name, it was always just Girl. She was always teased for her name, but she bet her daddy had been teased for his middle name too. But he was probably big enough that no one hurt him like they did to her. And she bet her mummy was never teased either, they were probably really strong and smart.</p>
<p>She knew they were Head Girl and Head Boy, there was a photo of them in their uniform inside of her dad’s book, tucked behind the letter he had written specially for her. Her father was tall, and kind of skinny, but he had some muscles she supposed. He had hair like her, or she had hair like him. It was black and unruly, ruffled and poking out in all directions. His eyes were hazel, they had little bits of green mixed in with the brown, and he wore glasses. He had his Head Boy badge pinned to his jumper along with another badge that had a big golden C and the word Captain underneath, his Quidditch Captain badge. Her mother stood next to him smiling and looking smart. Lilly Evans was beautiful. She had flaming red hair, it was mainly straight, but it had a slight wave to it as it flowed down her back and to her waist. Her eyes were a bright and vibrant shade of green and the light makeup she wore emphasised this, making them stand out even more. Her mother had a curvy figure, and was rather tall, she was only slightly shorter than James, who had hooked an arm around her waist as they both smiled at the camera. They wore matching ties in shades of red and gold, and held sticks, wands, in their hands.</p>
<p>Ria couldn’t help looking at the picture and running her fingers over it every now and then. It was the only photograph she owned of her parents, and she treasured it above everything else. She had made sure that the Dursley’s, her ‘family’ didn’t know about all of the books that her parents had left to her. She had brought the trunk down from the attic when they had gone out for a family trip and had left her at home to clean. She had gently pushed the trunk from the attic, causing it to fall through the hatch and onto her mattress that she had placed underneath. She had dragged them back into her bedroom and had hidden the trunk in the small cupboard that served as a wardrobe in her room. She refused to let her precious belongings be taken from her, especially ones that had once belonged to her parents.</p>
<p>Sometimes she wondered what it would have been like if her parents hadn’t died, would she have been brought up knowing all about magic, learning about it from a young age. Would she have been taught how to play Quidditch by her father? Would they have played with her and made sure she never felt lonely, and most of all, would they have been like a proper family. Would they have had another baby, so that she could have a sibling of her own to love and care for? She thought that they would have, that they would have been the best family possible.</p>
<p>She knew from her dad’s books that he had received his letter of acceptance for Hogwarts when he was eleven, he had received it on his birthday in fact. It had been brought to him by an owl from the school and he had been asked to attend Hogwarts for seven years so that he could learn how to use and master his magic. So that was what Ria had to do. She had to wait for the morning, when a beautiful owl would fly through the window and bring her a letter that would allow her to be whisked away from the Dursley’s.</p>
<p>She could wait until then, and she would make sure that she made the owl some bacon too, it was a long journey from Scotland to Surrey, and the owl would be hungry. It wouldn’t be much longer now, until she would be free from her family, only to return in the summer for a few weeks, surely they wouldn’t turn down the opportunity to be rid of her for most of the year, they usually complained about her taking up too much room so it was the best thing for them both.<br/>
</p>
<p>She gently closed the book and placed it beneath the thin and threadbare pillow at one end of the mattress before curling up under her blanket. Hana-Hesperia Potter would be going to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in September, and there was nothing that the Dursley’s could do about it. And while she doubted her ability to get into Gryffindor like her parents, she knew her father would be proud of her no matter where she was placed, and that was all that mattered.</p>
<p>She would make sure that her parents were proud of her no matter what, she would be a Quidditch Captain just like her dad had always hoped and she’d make sure that she was a Prefect and even Head Girl. She was going to ensure that her parents would have nothing to be disappointed about, because she was going to do whatever it took to be what they had dreamed for. First of all, she would have to find out what had actually been the cause of her parents death, because she knew that they hadn’t died in a car crash, they would have been able to save themselves with their magic. She would then have to find out why she had been placed with the Dursley’s of all people, they hated the idea of being different, and she was terrified of what would happen to her if she even mentioned the word magic in front of them. Nothing good she could guess.</p>
<p>None of that mattered anymore though, because soon she would be learning magic with other young witches and wizards, and there had to be some that had been brought up not knowing about magic. Either way, they would all be the same age, and she doubted that children were allowed to go around cursing each other before even going to school, so they would all be on the same level. She had a chance to rise to the top and prove to everyone that her parents were and still are proud of her, even if they aren’t alive anymore. She could do it. And no one could stop her.</p>
