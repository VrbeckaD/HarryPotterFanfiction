  <b>Harry Potter — Privet Drive — July 31st 1996</b>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">I don't exactly remember when it first began. As I neared my 16th birthday, I began noticing certain things. I'd been experiencing random bursts of accidental magic, which managed to scare my relatives back into ignoring me. Then other things began to appear, sudden migraines, waking up in a cold sweat with cramps, and sudden blindness in my eyes. I couldn't seem to figure out what was exactly happening to me, but I feared I was getting a magical illness. Those have been known to be even deadlier and more painful than muggle illnesses.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Then, as the clock struck midnight as I finally turned sixteen, I screamed. I experienced pain like I'd never felt before. I was in so much pain I couldn't let out any more noises. Just as I felt my sanity slipping away, it stopped abruptly. I allowed myself to fall asleep, blissfully unaware of what I would wake up to.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As the sun rose, I let out a soft groan. My body ached something fierce, as I could barely move. Everything was sore, my legs, arms, feet, hands, and neck. I rolled off of my bed and onto the cold wooden floor with a grunt. It had hurt more than I had expected it to, but I had managed to get off it nonetheless. I crawled towards my dresser and held onto it as I attempted to stand up. Something felt off, there was something wrong. I didn't feel comfortable in my body, it suddenly felt different. I stumbled out of my bedroom and into the hallway, my eyes now locked on the bathroom door. It was empty as I swung the door open, rushing towards the mirror.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I wish I'd never looked in the mirror. I no longer looked like Harry Potter, I only resembled him slightly in the face. I didn't want to admit it, but I looked a lot like a Malfoy. I looked for differences between me and Malfoy and managed to find a few. My hair was a shade darker, with nearly black roots (scarily close to Narcissa's hair), my face had relatively remained the same, but my skin was paler, smoother, and my face had a more regal look to it now. I was an inch or two taller than before, around Malfoy's height. I looked at my forehead hoping to see that my scar was gone, but it wasn't. It sat there as bright as ever. It stood out even more with my newfound pale skin.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As I heard Aunt Petunia exit her room and head downstairs, I knew I was doomed. If they saw me like this, I had no idea what would happen. I ran back to my room and began packing my things immediately. I was going to have to call the knight bus to get out of here. I looked at Hedwig who was staring at me suspiciously, causing me to sigh. I lifted up my now blond hair and showed her my scar. "I swear, I woke up like this," I said defensively. She hooted in annoyance and looked away. I'd never met an owl that had an attitude until I met her. I ignored the pouting owl as I continued to stuff all of my belongings into my trunk. As I closed the latches on my trunk, Hedwig began to hoot. "Okay, okay, you can fly. Go to the leaky cauldron, I'll be getting a room there," I ordered. She hooted happily before flying out my window and into the sky as the sun continued to slowly rise.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I grabbed my trunk, thanking Merlin that Quidditch had managed to give me some muscle as I hauled my trunk out of my room. I had put on a black cloak, with the hood up. My wand was tucked into the holster on my right arm. Aunt Petunia was the only one awake, so all I had to do was sneak past her and go out the front door. I took a deep breath before bolting down the stairs with my trunk in my arms as I raced towards the door. I flung it open and made brief eye contact with her before slamming the door shut. She saw my face, I could tell by the look of shock on her face when she saw me.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I continued to walk down the street, now finally able to use the wheels on my trunk to drag it on the road. I smiled slightly as I looked at the Privet Drive street sign, I had a slight feeling of hope that this would be the last time I saw my so called family. I held out my wand and within seconds the knight bus came to a sudden stop in front of me. It was a completely new driver and assistant. That's what war does, I solemnly thought to myself. "Where are ya headed?" The driver asked me as took the cigar out of his mouth. "The leaky cauldron," I replied quietly. The assistant was staring blankly at me, his brown eyes staring into my now mercury colored eyes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">"You related to the Malfoy's by any chance?" He asked me after a moment of silence. I silently shook my head no, hoping my voice won't give me away. "Well, you sure as hell look like one," he said with a slight chuckle. "What're you doing out here alone anyways? You should have your parents with ya. It's dangerous times right now," he said with a tsk sound. I shrugged, staring out the window. "Do you talk?" He asked after a moment of silence. I nodded in response, having to hold back a smile at the sound of annoyance he made. Just as he was about to speak, the bus stopped in front of the leaky cauldron. "Have a nice day," I said as I grabbed my trunk and got off of the bus. I handed the driver the money and headed into the leaky cauldron.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Tom the bartender was still there, giving an old man a shot of fire whiskey. The Leaky Cauldron was one thing that remained the same. Not once in it's history had the historic inn been attacked. "I'd like a room please," I said as I walked up to the counter. "Please, I have no where else to go and I'm pretty sure if I stay out there I'll get killed." His face softened slightly as he nodded.</p>
<p dir="ltr">"I do have a room left, you can have it. Do you have the money?" He asked me as he grabbed a key from the wall behind him. I nodded and handed him five galleons, which should cover two nights. "Room 13, up the stairs and to the left," he said and handed me the key. I quickly thanked him before dragging my suitcase up the stairs. The room was a decent size, with a bed, desk, dresser, and bathroom connected to it. The leaky cauldron felt like my second home, the first being Hogwarts. I began unpacking some of my things, ultimately deciding to change into something that'll suit the wizarding world's standards. I grabbed the nicest button up shirt I had, dragon hide boots, and I kept my cloak. I made sure I had my Gringotts key before exiting my room.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I bid Tom farewell as I headed towards the back alleyway, tapping the bricks with my wand. On my third try I managed to get it open, smiling as it did so. I frowned slightly at the lack of people on the streets. There was a much more playful mood when I had first visited Diagon Alley, but now it was much more serious. No one spoke to each other as they walked briskly, instead choosing to eye people suspiciously. I got the most looks, most likely because of the fact I now looked like a Malfoy.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Gringotts stood proud and tall much to my pleasure, but it also happened to be the busiest place in all of Diagon Alley. I waited in line, tapping my foot impatiently. I didn't know what I was suppose to say, especially since I no longer looked like Harry Potter. My hands were sweaty as I handed the goblin the key. "Harry Potter," I mumbled as quietly as possible. When he raised an eyebrow at my claim, I lifted up my hair. "I woke up like this today-" he cut me off abruptly.</p>
<p dir="ltr">"Is it your sixteenth birthday?" He asked me sharply. I nodded, a feeling of utter doom creeping up on me. He waved over another goblin, whispering something to him. "Follow me, Mister Potter," he said as he got up from his seat. He handed me back my key, introducing himself as Sylus. "I'm already making assumptions as to who your parents are. Don't give me that look, Lily and James Potter are very obviously not your parents. You look like a Malfoy, so I'm fairly certain I know who you are."</p>
<p dir="ltr">"Would you, oh, I don't know, care to explain?" I said with a tinge of annoyance creeping up on me. I already know I look like a Malfoy, but I don't know what the hell is happening to me. He didn't say anything, instead made another turn down a hallway, eventually stopping at a door. "Come in," he instructed, gesturing for me to sit down in the chair. He pulled out a needle and a bowl, immediately making me uncomfortable. "I need you to prick your finger and put a drop of blood in here. It'll give us your DNA structure and also tell us who your parents are, who messed with your DNA, and your information. If I am correct in my assumption of who you are, then your entire life is about to change," he says with a slight smirk on his face. He was most definitely scaring me, but I did it anyways.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I watched as the drop of blood hit the bottom of the bowl, immediately Sylus began chanting. I looked in the bowl to see no more blood, instead Sylus was holding a piece of parchment. "I was correct, Adriel," he said with a smile. A smile on a Goblin is not a pretty sight if you really think about it. "I know Adriel Malfoy's story, I had to deal with the Malfoy's when they lost their son on July 31st. On July 31st 1980, Adriel Malfoy disappeared and Harry Potter was born. Adriel Malfoy was born on June 5th 1980, with his twin brother Draco Malfoy. Draco was older of the two, so he was deemed the heir. From what I know Narcissa and Lucius Malfoy loved both of their sons very much. It was quite heartbreaking when they lost their youngest a mere two months after he was born. They came to me as their personal bank manager to try and find you, but it seemed as though your DNA could not be traced. We assumed you were dead, but it seems not. According to this paper, Albus Dumbledore altered your DNA to match the Potter's," Sylus finally finished, looking at me with a slight smirk.</p>
<p dir="ltr">"T-Then why didn't it happen on June 5th?" Then I realized, technically Harry Potter was born on July 31st, which meant that it'd have been exactly sixteen years since such a spell was placed. "How does it know it was Dumbledore?" I asked after a moment of silence.</p>
<p dir="ltr">"His magical signature was left behind after he cast the spell, ultimately giving evidence as to who did it. Now, I understand that you're probably in shock, even if you don't realize it. You are currently on the light side, but your biological family is technically on the dark side.Whether you choose to believe it or not, the Malfoy's and you may share some similar opinions. The Malfoy's don't hate muggle-born witches and wizards, they hate how they're changing their culture. All wizard holidays have been turned into muggle ones, which most pureblood families hate. They want to be able to celebrate their holidays once again. They typically join the death eaters because it's their only hope. The likes of Voldemort don't truly know what they're fighting for. That's why he chooses to kill instead, in the beginning when he was sane he didn't. Tom Riddle was once a politically ambitious, charming, and handsome man. Lucius Malfoy's father went to school with him, and as soon as Lucius turned seventeen he was told to join. When Lucius joined, they weren't killing. They participated in protests, that rarely turned violent. Over time, Voldemort lost his sanity and changed his tactics to murder and torture. Once you were in, there was no way out. The dark mark bounded them to him permanently, he now had control over their life. Most don't realize it is the sad part." The story made my heart ache in a way I had only experienced when I lost Sirius.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It sounded horrible, which it most definitely was. I was more than certain that if I worked harder, I would one day be able to kill Voldemort. I found that I had a new mission, to free the trapped death eaters. Those who show they won't stop killing, will be punished. Not those who just want to get away from him. The thing that excited me the most was the fact that I had a family. I had a twin brother, waiting for me. "Can you contact them? Wait, won't they hate me when they find out who I am?" The thought of having a family out there that hated me, hurt more than I expected.</p>
<p dir="ltr">"Oh trust me, they won't hate you. I'm sure they think of their son everyday. With that thought, I shall send them an owl. Now I'm assuming you want to get money from your vaults? You're still entitled to the Potter's vaults as they technically adopted you," he said as he stood up. I nodded excitedly, following him out of the room. We got into a cart, making me grip the edges. I smiled slightly as it zoomed down the tracks. The first time I was in one of these was exactly five years ago, I still remember trying to memorize every turn the cart made. I didn't even get through the first five turns before I gave up.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We lurched to a stop, making me fling forward. "You should get seatbelts for these," I mumbled as I rubbed my knee. The Goblin shrugged, stepping out of the cart with my key. He opened it, handing me a bag. "You can take as much as you want, there is an expansion and feather light charm placed on it. That excited me more than it should have, but nonetheless I took as much money as I wanted. I had enough money to last me for two years if I owned a house, bought my own food, and regularly bought new clothes. That was the first thing I wanted to do as soon as I got out of here, buy more appropriate clothes. If I am going to meet my family, I may as well dress well for them.</p>
<p dir="ltr">"Return to Gringotts tomorrow no later than noon, the Malfoy family will be here as soon as the letter arrives, which'll be at 12:30 in the afternoon. Use that money and buy better clothes, I also suggest a new wand. The one you have now is compatible with Harry Potter, not Adriel Malfoy. I suggest going to a higher end alley. Try Crystal Alley, their stuff is reasonably priced for such good quality items," Sylus instructed me as he led me towards the main doors of the bank. "Also, try not to get killed. The Malfoys would see me dead," he said with a smile. I waved goodbye as I headed out into Diagon Alley, I'll have to ask Tom the bartender where Crystal Alley was.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Crystal Alley was very different from what I expected it to be. Despite mainly being run by pure-bloods, it was very modern and bright themed. People weren't as scared as they were in Diagon Alley, which lifted my mood greatly. What kept me on edge though, was running into a Hogwarts student that I knew. I spotted a wand shop, so I headed over there with Sylus' comment still in my mind. I had grown fond of my current wand, but it wouldn't hurt to look for another wand. I entered the shop quietly, a soft ring running through the shop. A man with raven black hair appeared, his hair tied back in a pony tail. "In need of a new wand?" He asked with a raised eyebrow. This man was definitely handsome, I could feel my cheeks heating up as he got closer to me. I officially hated my pale skin, as before my darker skin managed to cover up most of the blush.</p>
<p dir="ltr">"Hold out your wand arm," he ordered, which I immediately did. He measured my right arm with a measuring tape, before instructing me to follow him to the back of the shop. "These are all of the wands with the measurement that'll best suit you. You look like a Blackthorn wood," he commented as he scanned the wands in boxes, eventually grabbing one. I held it in my hand, feeling a slight connection, but not strong enough. The pile of wands continued to go up, like my first time. "Maybe you're an aspen wood person?" He muttered, grabbing a wand from the shelf. This one felt better, but not as strong. "You seem to favor aspen and thestral hair," he commented as he grabbed another one. "What're your thoughts on snakes?" He asked me with an excited look.</p>
<p dir="ltr">"I'm a parselmouth," I said quietly. His eyes lit up as he handed me a wand. "This one is it," he said before I even grabbed it. He was right, the second I grabbed it I could feel its allegiance turn to me. I nodded, staring at the wand in awe. It felt weird to be holding something so powerful, almost as though I wasn't worthy enough to hold something with such power.</p>
<p dir="ltr">"I'm expecting a lot from you in the future," he commented as he went to the register. "What's your name?" He asked me as he took the money I handed him. I paused for a moment, looking at the wand in my hand.</p>
<p dir="ltr">"You can call me Adriel."</p>
