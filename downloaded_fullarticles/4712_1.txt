    <p align="center">-1-</p><p>Eren watched the little blob of light writhe on the canvas of his skin, moving, twisting and turning every which way. He was amazed at the little thing, though he wasn't quite sure what it would turn out to be yet. He had just turned 17 and that meant that, as of today, he would be able to find his soulmate and could be found in return. He wasn't sure he wanted to know who his soulmate would turn out to be, but he knew he would definitely come to like the blob of light now residing on his skin. Everyone did, after all.</p><p>It was only the morning of the day after his birthday, so he hadn't really expected to actually find anything yet, but now he was grinning like mad and carefully poking the blob which currently ran circles around his left arm, apparently chasing itself.</p><p>“Hey, Eren! What are you looking at?” Jean poked his head out from behind the curtains of his four-poster bed.</p><p>“Nothing!” Eren scrambled to say and quickly let the sleeve of his robe cover his arm.</p><p>Jean gave him a suspicious look. “You don't act like it was nothing, though.”</p><p>Eren sighed but shook his head. He wasn't in the mood to argue with Jean, yet. It was too early for that. Instead, he grabbed his bag, waved to the other guys in his dorm and made his way down to the common room.</p><p>“Hey, don't run off like that! I'm talking to you! Eren!” Jean called after him, but Eren acted like he didn't hear him.</p><p>He wanted to get down to the Great Hall already and tell his best friends about his discovery. Mikasa and Armin had both been sorted into different houses than him, but they had made it a habit to rotate through the house tables during meals from the beginning, not caring about prejudices and feuds between their houses. At first they had been frowned upon, but after a few well-placed glares from Mikasa, people just let them be. The three of them wouldn't let themselves be separated easily, least of all from something as petty as house rivalries. It also helped that their headmaster, Mr. Pixis seemed to support their show of unity. Besides, the houses only mirrored people's values and determinations, nothing more and nothing less. And now, over six and a half years later, they weren't the only ones disregarding their house table for meals. Everyone sat with friends from other houses when they felt like it, and only during the Welcome Feast and the announcement of the winner of that year's House Cup did the students sit at the table that represented their house.</p><p>Eren liked to think that this was kind of their legacy, something they achieved and what would be carried on even after Mikasa, Armin, and he left. He smiled, thinking about it and took a short cut through a hidden corridor he and Armin had discovered in their third year. It took him two floors down from the seventh floor without having to face the morning crowd on the stairs.</p><p>Arriving at the Great Hall, he let his bright green eyes wander over the sea of heads, looking for that familiar shade of a blond bowl cut and a red scarf somewhere near it. He spotted them sitting at the Ravenclaw table and grinning and waving excitedly to get their attention, he made his way over.</p><p>“Hey guys! Guess what!” he greeted them, not caring he was interrupting Mikasa as she told Armin something or another about the potions essay she was supposed to write for next Monday.</p><p>“Eren! Good morning.” Armin smiled and scooted over on the bench to make room for him.</p><p>“Hey, Eren. Did you sleep well?” Mikasa inquired, and though Eren rolled his eyes in her general direction, he nodded to answer her question. Sure, she could be a little overbearing sometimes, but she meant well and there was no harm done in asking a simple question. Besides, he was in too good a mood to shoot her down today.</p><p>“I'm fine. Now guess what!” he urged them, grinning widely at both of them and then went to pour himself some orange juice and grabbed a buttered toast.</p><p>“What?” they echoed and looking at him curiously. It was rare to see Eren in this good a mood so early in the morning. They couldn't tell what could have happened to him over night that he was this happy.</p><p>“Oh come on! Not even a guess, Armin?” Eren pouted when it became obvious that neither of them would say what he wanted to hear. The blond shrugged, having no clue what it was that Eren wanted them to guess.</p><p>“I have no idea, Eren. Just tell us already. You're obviously excited about it, whatever it is.” he said.</p><p>Eren munched on a bite of his toast and nodded, indicating that he would tell once he had swallowed. “I got my soulmate's patronus! It was on my left arm when I woke up! A little ball of white light running circles around my wrist!” he grinned happily and started to pull up the sleeve of his robe. “It's really only a little blob of light, no real form yet, but still.” he prattled on eagerly, only to look disappointed to find that the little blob had vanished from his arm.</p><p>Armin and Mikasa both gaped at him. While it wasn't unheard of to have your soulmate's patronus showing on your skin only hours after your 17<sup>th</sup> birthday, it wasn't really common, either. It usually took about a week, in most cases even two, for them to show. Mikasa's hadn't even shown until a week ago. And her birthday had been back in mid-February.</p><p>“Are you sure that's what you saw? You don't think someone jinxed you, right?” Armin asked, careful not to upset Eren's good mood. His words still brought a frown on Eren's face, though.</p><p>“No, I'm sure. No one jinxed me. It was right here!” Eren pointedly jabbed a finger at the very place that little ball of light had been running its circles around his arm earlier.</p><p>“Okay, Eren. We believe you.” Mikasa tried to calm him down. Of course they believed him -not that he had doubted them in the first place. He had just been so happy and excited and had wanted to show them <em>so bad</em>, and now the little thing was hiding somewhere on his skin where he couldn't show it without trouble. “You can show us later. It'll still be there then.” Armin smiled at him and pulled Eren's sleeve back down.</p><p>Eren nodded, if a bit dejected. “Okay.”</p><p>“You could also try to feel it, you know?” Mikasa offered, “I'm not really good at it yet myself, but if you concentrate enough you should be able to tell where it is right now. Don't worry though if you don't get it right immediately.” She certainly hadn't, and she was still only getting used to it, too.</p><p>Eren nodded again. He would give it a try, he decided. Maybe he could show them now, after all? Closing his eyes and trying to block out the noise of the other students around him, he tried to focus on the little bulb of light somewhere on his skin.</p><p>“What is he doing?” Jean's voice threw him out of his concentration just when he thought he had it.</p><p>“Nothing, prat.” Eren frowned at him before he shook his head at Mikasa to let her know it hadn't worked. He'd probably need to practice this, just like everyone else had to.</p><p>“Watch it, Jaeger!” Jean growled back and sat down opposite of them, kicking Eren's shin under the table. Eren narrowed his eyes at him, but chose to ignore him. He was too happy to let himself get roped into another one of their fights.</p><p>“Guys, stop picking fights.” Armin chided. Eren huffed, willing to let it go, but Jean seemed to be determined. “No. He just ran out on me while I was talking to him earlier. Said it was 'nothing' then, too. But I know something is up, Eren. Spill it already.”</p><p>“He did? That's not very nice of you, Eren.” Armin smiled, but Jean didn't fail to notice that Armin expertly managed to avoid the topic of 'nothing'. Mikasa had followed their exchange in silence until now, wanting to find out more before she intervened. “Jean, if he doesn't want to share I'm sure he has his reasons.” Of course she would side with Eren. Jean should be used to it too by now, after all the time they knew each other. However, he didn't seem too happy about it.</p><p>“He told you though, didn't he?” It wasn't that he was jealous or something, but he thought they were friends, even if they were fighting and bickering most of the time, so Eren should be able to share whatever it was with him, too, right? Eren sighed.</p><p>“It's not that I don't want to tell you at all, Jean. Just... Not yet? If that makes any sense?” he offered and now it was Jean's part to huff. “Fine. Just make sure to tell me eventually, idiot.”</p><p>“Tell you what?” Marco asked and sat down next to him, looking curiously over their little group of friends. “About this 'nothing' he keeps waving me off about.” Jean frowned, using his fingers to imply quotation marks around the word 'nothing'. “Oh?” Marco seemed a little confused and looked to Armin for help. The blond simply shrugged. “Don't look at me. It's not my place to tell, really.” he said and then focused on his breakfast.</p><p>“Okay.” Marco smiled, “Will you tell me about it too, Eren?”</p><p>“Yeah, of course. I'll tell all of you later. Just not right now, okay?” he smiled apologetically at the pair. He still needed time to get used to the thought himself. He had known it would happen after all, but now that it did, he didn't know how to feel about it.</p><p> </p><p> </p>
