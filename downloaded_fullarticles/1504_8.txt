    <p>I’m not completely sure I’m ready for another year already after breaking the first vault and saving everyone’s sorry behind from that cursed ice. School’s always better than trying to get dad to notice me at home though, so that’s good enough for me to toss my bags onto a trolley and wave at mom before she leaves King’s Cross.</p>
<p>Rowan catches me all of five seconds after I appear past the barrier, of course. I appreciate the walking encyclopedia more than I get annoyed by his questions. Honestly I like the guy, we all have our quirks. “Hey Marik! Good summer I hope?”</p>
<p>“Same old boring life at home.” <em> Lies </em>. “What about you?” I know getting him to talk will avoid me giving the rundown on empty halls and hopes of seeing Jacob again. Rowan never misses an opportunity to talk my ears off.</p>
<p>“I came up with a list of eighty-two things we can do to protect ourselves from danger and Merula this year.”</p>
<p>Now he had my attention. “Anything we can launch to get her good early?”</p>
<p>“I read our list of classes this year and we will have Herbology. I know I heard Mandrakes before walking by the greenhouse. Their scream can knock you out if they are young enough.”</p>
<p>“Young enough?”</p>
<p>“A mature mandrake scream will kill you. We lost a Minister of Magic once that way. Students have to wear earmuffs during class.”</p>
<p>I’m zero percent surprised he knows that. “Sounds like an accidental bump to knock those off. I’ll make a note for later.” </p>
<p>Rowan squeezed his books tighter, “Are you sure we should be provoking Merula of all people? With all the things she’s threatened to do to us?”</p>
<p>Holding Rowan’s shoulder to keep him steady, “After the Devil’s Snare and stealing from Snape to get me in trouble I’m not going into another year unprepared.” I skim the railcars looking for any sign of the witch and spot her way up near the front. “How early do you need to get here to be up at the front?”</p>
<p>“Ben said he was going to the back to be as far away from her as possible. He said she was with two new friends this year and one was ‘ultra creepy,’ as he put it.”</p>
<p>“Sounds like her lot.”</p>
<p>As much as I wanted to draw first blood, that chance was taken from me when a brawny bloke flung open their compartment door and Merula’s voice commanded, “Jinx them, Ismelda!”</p>
<p>“<em>Petrificus totalis </em>!” </p>
<p>Before I knew it I was sliding off the seat, legs still bent. Rowan fell face first onto my shoe and I could only imagine Ben’s face after listening to the howling laughter of Merula and her cronies.</p>
<p>The door slammed shut as quick as it opened and their voices trailed down the hallway. Meanwhile I was getting a detailed look at how messy the underside of our benches were. Nothing moved but my eyes and every second felt like a minute waiting for the jinx’s effects to wear off. Ismelda must have practiced a lot to have it last so long.</p>
<p>Our three bodies rolled up against the front of the compartment as the train stopped. Now we had to hope for anyone to come check on us before leaving back to King’s Cross.</p>
<p>Another ten minutes, at least, passed. Finally the door slid open, “Marik! Rowan!” Penny’s high voice almost brought a smile to my face...except for the whole petrified thing.</p>
<p>“I got this.” Another witch said and a second later my legs kicked out right into Ben’s still petrified body. </p>
<p>An unusually pink haired witch finished the counter-spell on Rowan and Ben and stuck out her hand, “Name’s Tonks. Nothing else.”</p>
<p>“Cool name. Thank you both for finding us. Why are you still on the train?”</p>
<p>Penny lifted Rowan by his sleeve and explained, “Merula’s boy friend was laughing about cursing the curse-breaker and some nonsense on that was funny.” </p>
<p>“She has a boyfriend?”</p>
<p>“Guy who is a friend, that’s a thing you know.”</p>
<p>I had to chuckle, “I know, I was just thinking what unforgivable curse would need to be done to get someone to get anybody to date her.”</p>
<p>“<em>Imperio </em>.” Rowan states quickly. “It allows you to control-”</p>
<p>“I was being sarcastic!” I catch Ben still on the ground. “Come on, buddy, let’s get you cleaned up.” What a lame Gryffindor. I swear he needs to come out of his shell and do something super this year or I’m going to get tired of waiting for him to show off his courage. I’ve read enough books at home to know any coward sorted into Gryffindor always gets a big hero moment and Ben is running out the clock. “Alight, enough lying around. Let’s grab some food!” A snort escaped Tonks before she covered her face. I like this girl.</p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>We made it into the Great Hall just as the Sorting hat was singing. Merula locked eyes with me and her jaw tightened. The student across from her jumped as if they received a kick in the legs meant for me. Rowan and I had to walk past all the other Slytherins towards the front where the new first years would be seated.  </p>
<p>I yanked on Merula’s hood as we passed. Her hands slamming the table echoed across the silent hall earning the eyes of all the professors. That was a good start to the payback. </p>
<p>“Can we make it through a day without setting her off?” Rowan pleaded as we sat and watched the new recruits be sorted.</p>
<p>“I’m not going to take what she did to us lying down.” I admit the first joke was better. “I’ve been wanting to do some magic again and I think some rolls in her hood is a good way to start.”</p>
<p>“How are you?” I saw Rowan’s eyes dart around as he replayed my action pulling open her hood so there was room for us to levitate some food in. “Ah, I see.”</p>
<p>“Best case scenario she finds them in the common room and we catch them as she throws them back at us and we have a snack before bed.”</p>
<p>“Worst case?”</p>
<p>“I haven’t lost a duel yet.”</p>
<p>“I don’t want to sound like Ben, but-</p>
<p>“Then don’t.” Seriously Rowan should have been a Ravenclaw. His “ambition and resourcefulness” were helpful with finding the right spells and information on the vaults, but he never really rang as a cunning person. Probably why the hat took twice as long for him than for me.</p>
<p>I hold my wand in my left hand behind my back and a glazed cinnamon roll in my right. “<em> Wingardium leviosa </em>.” I whisper and release the roll. Out of the corner of my eye I watch the roll bob up and down at bench level until it is near Merula. Levitating an object behind my back is tough and the roll shakes around inches from half a dozen students for a moment. I tense as the roll finally edges up and brushes the lip of her hood, “Almost there…”</p>
<p>The roll recoils back to me and flashes past my head. I whip around and Felix, our prefect, is staring straight at me. I read his cold lips to meet after dinner. </p>
<p>
  <em> So much for a good start. </em>
</p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>The next day in Herbology class, Rowan and I take detailed notes on our mandrake lesson so we can find a way to sneak one out and prank Merula. I say “Rowan and I,” but that really means he is writing the notes furiously as Professor Sprout talks and I handle the plants. We each have our strengths. </p>
<p>Merula doesn’t look like she opted to take the class, but her muscle from last night is having the time of his life talking to the little mandrakes and carefully filling and watering their pots. Something doesn’t feel right, he’s too into this lesson. I keep one eye on him as we fertilize the mandrakes and start to re-pot the last batch.</p>
<p>Penny volunteered to grab some more pots off the shelf. “Werewolf!” Screams from all over the class erupted as a three meter tall beast steps toward Penny.</p>
<p>A piece of venison slapped across the werewolf’s face. Professor sprout hurled another piece out an open window, but the werewolf didn’t flinch or make a move except closer towards Penny. “<em> Depulso </em>!” She boomed and white light shot from her wand straight through the creature with no effect. </p>
<p>Tonks tackled a frozen Penny as Sprout tried again, “<em> Riddikulus </em>!” and the werewolf lost all its fur and grew a santa hat and fake beard. Laughs from around the room caused the werewolf to burst in a puff of smoke and disappear.</p>
<p>“What was that?” Another Hufflepuff asked.</p>
<p>“That dears, was a boggart. One that had no business in this class.” Sprout’s face twisted in thought, “That’s enough for today. Finish your current station and leave the rest.” Sprout hustled students back and started looking into every nook and cranny in the greenhouse.</p>
<p>I spun towards the sound of a smashing pot and saw Merula’s friend on the floor with his earmuffs off next to a crying baby mandrake. </p>
<p>“Keep your earmuffs on!” Rowan yelled at him for some reason. </p>
<p>Merula and Ismelda came in through the front greenhouse door and scooped up their friend. <em> Why did Merula have earmuffs on </em>? </p>
<p>“Take him to Madam Pomfrey.” Sprout asked without seeing the two new students. “He’ll be back in a bit no worse for the wear.”</p>
<p>I pulled Rowan, Penny, and Tonks together outside after class, “Does anyone think it’s strange Merula and Ismelda were right there as soon as…Okay what’s his name?”</p>
<p>“Baranaby Lee. He’s our year, you don’t know him?”</p>
<p>“Haven’t had the pleasure to say ‘hi’ yet. Anyway, they had earmuffs on. They were ready to come inside. I think that was a distraction.”</p>
<p>Rowan shifted back and forth, “Do you think they had something to do with the boggart?” </p>
<p>“I don’t know. I don’t see how they could get one into class like that.” I see Penny is still white after her encounter. “Penny, are you alright?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I’m fine. I don’t want to talk about it.”</p>
<p>I’m going to have to follow up on that later. I know the “I’m fine” lie all too well. “We have to get to flying class soon. We should figure out what they are up to and see if that has something to do with another vault that Dumbledore warned us about.”</p>
<p>“We can talk at the Three Broomsticks.” Tonks suggested.</p>
<p>“Right. We can go to Hogsmeade now after class. I can research some more on Boggarts in the library and let you know what I find about them.”</p>
<p>“Sounds good. Welcome to the team, Tonks.”</p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>I suspect Merula knows something about the boggarts she isn’t letting on about and I know she wants to start the year off proving she’s “the greatest witch” like her failed attempts our first and second year together. </p>
<p>“What do you want loser?” She coldly asks as I present her with a broom.</p>
<p>“Let’s make a bet. If I can sprint through the rings around the training grounds faster than you, then you have to tell me what you know about those boggarts.”</p>
<p>“Why should I do that?”</p>
<p>“Because if you win, I’ll admit you're the best witch at Hogwarts.”</p>
<p>“I don’t need the validation from the cursed-boy. That’ll be like getting Ben to say I’m braver. It just sounds sad to have to be compared with you.”</p>
<p>“That’s not how the professors feel.” Merula’s eyes focused and seemed darker than usual.</p>
<p>“Give me that broom. I won’t lose to you.”</p>
<p>“That’s what I thought.” We mount the broomsticks in unison. “Three, two, one. Hey!” Merula’s boot slammed into my knee and she lifted into the air. I sprint low to the ground close behind and look up to see her directly above me. I flirt with the idea of knocking her off the broom, but I’m not a beater on any team.</p>
<p>Yelling into the wind, “You’re never going to be the best if you have to keep cheating!” </p>
<p>“You look like an ant down there. Oh wait, you are.” Merula snapped back.</p>
<p>Ascending almost level with Merula she has me beat by just half a broom-length. I can’t try to go through the first ring next to her, definitely not big enough. I slow the broom for just a moment and grab the straw on the back of her broom. We move together through the first set of rings. I match her small turns as we move to the second length of the field. Once we hit a clearing I use my grip on her broom to launch myself just a bit forward and pull directly up next to her. Her gaze is as focused as ever. She doesn’t give me a second look. </p>
<p>“Chicken?”</p>
<p>“I’m not afraid of you.” I say missing her true meaning. The next three rings in a row are within a hundred meters. Merula copies my move and places her hand on my handle to keep us together. “Oh this game?” I reach under her arm and hold her broom. </p>
<p>Forty meters. Thirty. We slow just a little to adjust our position and continue closing in. Twenty meters. The ring is not wide enough for two brooms. Ten meters. Someone needs to let go. Five. This is going to hurt. “Duck!” Our brooms cross and pinched our legs together. Our heads collide to avoid the ring and I let go of her broom to save my thumb getting squished and lock elbows. We made it through the first and second ring. Not the third.</p>
<p>Technically her broom hit the ring first, then my feet second. Our bodies pointed straight down and we fell together into the sand pit below. I hit the ground first. She hit me. You can say I’m chivalrous like that even for Merula.</p>
<p>That kind of tomfoolery is precisely why we practice and never grab each other’s brooms.” Madam hooch inspected us both for injuries. “Ten points from Slytherin. For both of you. I trust this won’t happen again.”</p>
<p>“Yes ma’am.” I lied.</p>
<p>“Good, now I will see you both here for detention cleaning and mending brooms as punishment for your actions.” As if having Merula on top of me wasn’t dreadful enough.</p>
<p>Shouts of death eaters erupted from the class watching back by the castle. Madam Hooch zipped off on her broom and with a flick of her wand cast the “riddikulus” spell again.</p>
<p>“Twice in one day? Merula,” I looked over to the girl shaking the sand from her hair, “You’re not the one causing the boggarts around here?”</p>
<p>“No you idiot.” She stood and shook off her robes, “These will take forever to clean out. No, I’m not. It’s obviously got to do with the vaults. I have a few leads on where it is already and I intend to get that power.”</p>
<p>“What leads?”</p>
<p>“You didn’t win. And even if you did I wouldn’t tell you.” Merula always regained her confidence at a remarkable rate after being humiliated.</p>
<p>“You’re welcome for breaking your fall!” I call as she finds her friends.</p>
<p>“I would have preferred the sand or even a pit of vipers to you.”</p>
<p><em> Don’t say it, don’t say it sounds like a family reunion. Too low even for her. </em> I shake out the sand from my shoes and rush back to Penny.</p>
<p>“I make no promises that everyone won’t be talking about what just happened.” </p>
<p>She always knows what I’m about to ask. “That’s fair. I challenged her so I deserve it.” I think about our last class and look at the clock. We have some time before lunch. “Hey Penny, can we talk about what happened in Herbology?”</p>
<p>Her face loses all color again, “I’m not sure.”</p>
<p>“Not here. Let’s go inside and talk in the artefact room so it’s just us.”</p>
<p>Penny agrees and we leave for the west wing of the castle. Inside the artefact room Penny fidgets with her sleeves and seems more nervous than during end-of-semester exams. “I’m not sure I can talk about this.”</p>
<p>“What could be so bad that Penny Haywood, the most popular girl in our year, is afraid of? You saw a werewolf, that would scare anyone not expecting it. And probably most people who were.” I laugh to ease the tension. “I’ve known you for two years now. Something wasn’t right with that.”</p>
<p>“I know. I want to tell you but I can’t right now. I have a few things on my mind and...actually if you could help me with them I think I could come around to explaining it.”</p>
<p>“Deal.” Penny details her idea to brew another potion. If it’s anything like the strengthening one she used to rip open those frozen doors last year I’m all ears.</p>
