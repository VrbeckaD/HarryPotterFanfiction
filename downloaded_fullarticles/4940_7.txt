          <div class="userstuff"><p><strong>Place:</strong> <em>Severus and Aberforth upstairs at The Hog's Head</em></p>
<p><strong>Time:</strong> <em>Post-family revelation, a pile of chicken bones, a puddle of gravy, four absconded goats, a dozen glasses of red AND white elf wine, and one good bottle of Ogden's Finest Firewhiskey for Discerning Wizards later...</em></p>
<p>So...if the old man was <em>my</em> father, that would make Potter <em>his</em>-</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>So, <em>that's</em> why he spoiled the little shit rotten!</p>
<p>Sure puts a kink in your socks, don't it?</p>
<p>Did your father piss all over you too?</p>
<p>Mind your tongue! That's your grandfather you're talking about! ...and no, I didn't rate high enough.</p>
<p>Ah, I see.</p>
<p>
  <em>Pause.</em>
</p>
<p>So <em>my</em> treating Potter like crap and <em>his</em> leaving me to die on the floor of the Shrieking Shack-</p>
<p>Was just the two of you following in our bloody- I mean blood family's tradition.</p>
<p>
  <em>Silence.</em>
</p>
<p>I'm going to <em>kill</em> that old - oh wait.</p>
<p>He always <em>did </em>know how to bugger things up. Your Aunt Ariana could tell you...if she were alive...</p>
<p>...So-oo-oo aannnywaay ... when - <em>Merlin forbid</em> - my younger boy, or worse, his older brother - reproduces, I'll finally get <em>my</em> shot at revenge? Hmmph, could be an awfully long wait.</p>
<p>Not if the Weasley chit has anything to say about it. Besides, what do the Muggles call it? It's the circle of life. You just have to accept it.</p>
<p>Not if I snip that circle.</p>
<p>Hmm, I wouldn't say that too loudly around the redhead.</p>
<p>So is that why <em>you</em> never had kids?</p>
<p>...well, when you say "kids..."</p>
<p>The goats are more forgiving, aren't they?</p>
<p>Always.</p>
