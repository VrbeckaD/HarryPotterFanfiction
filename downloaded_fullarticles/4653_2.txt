    <p>Draco stood on the platform looking silently around. Children excited to start a new year at Hogwarts, make new memories and friends. Forgetting about all the awful things that had filled the past months. "Well only if it was that easy", Draco whispered to himself. So much had changed in the months after the war too, Draco had gotten away with hardly any punishment after is trial, thanks to former enemy Harry Potter. To top it all of a mark had formed itself on Draco's arm just above the faded dark mark, a soul mark it was, his mother had told. Very special and lucky he was, she had told him, but Draco wasn't so sure. </p>
<p>Not everyone got a soul mark, it was rather rare. The ones that got one was deemed as lucky. It could vary in shape and colour, the colour were often to match ones soulmate's eye colour. Draco's mark wasn't anything specific it was just a bunch of swirls and circles, but every line was so utterly beautiful and meaningful. It was like they all had a meaning even though they really just were swirls running down Draco's forearm. It, the mark was a very intense green so green he could only think of one person with eyes that colour, Draco knew who is soulmate was and he'd pretty much known since the day it showed on his arm, he also knew Harry knew. Harry knew he and Draco were soulmates. Harry knew about Draco's mark. Draco knew about Harry's matching swirls and circles in silvery grey on his forearm. They had even seen each other's marks, they had swiftly talked about it too. If you can call Harry saying "so we are soulmates" and Draco replying "seems so, yeah" a conversation. </p>
<p>Now Draco was standing on the platform ready to enter the express, children looking at him, some with curious eyes other with more of fear, but everyone let him have his space. He sighed while entering the exspress, looking for his friends he didn't really feel comfortable with the stares, a year ago he would probably love all the attention, now? Not so much. He looked trough the windows of the compartments until he looked into the fifth compartment and saw Pansy's face in an annoyed frown. Draco opened the door and slammed his butt beside Pansy, staring at Blaise and Theodore, they were already all in a conversation or more of a rant about how bad of an idea this whole 8th year thing was. Draco wasn't so sure he actually agreed with them with it "maybe it could be a new beginning for us all" Draco scored in. Pansy just lifted her eyebrows and let her eyes glide behind her lids, but before anyone could answer the door to the compartment opened and two green eyes that Draco knew all to well was looking at them.</p>
