Draco seemed to have a contemplative face on as he picked me up, almost as if he wasn't sure on whether or not to eat me. I decided then and there that I would convince him to eat me.</p><p>So, I started with a simple "Hello Draco!"

I decided for my safety to not talk again, maybe that would encourage him to eat me. Draco gave me a weird stare and muttered, "I must be really tired to think an apple just talked to me..."</p><p>However, I noticed he shrugged and started walking. <em>Yes! He's taking me with him meaning he must be going to eat me!</em> Finally, my destiny has come true! I watched as he took a bite off me and I slowly started to fade away and I realized that a spell was put on me to make me sentient and the spell was wearing off as Draco continued to eat me. I came to the conclusion that maybe just being a plain apple was better, and I lost all consciousness...</p><p>The End</p></div>
