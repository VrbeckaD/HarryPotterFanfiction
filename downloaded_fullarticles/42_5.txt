    <p>
  <span>Draco feels ridiculous. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Standing next to Pansy only makes him feel a little bit better. Off to the side with his arms crossed, staring resolutely at the pristine white tile floor. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Pansy just continues her perusing of the clothing rack, searching for her size. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re the one who wanted to come.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco forcibly wills the heat he feels licking at his ears down. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Pan—” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you </span>
  <em>
    <span>really </span>
  </em>
  <span>just going to stand there when </span>
  <em>
    <span>you’re </span>
  </em>
  <span>the one who said ‘</span>
  <em>
    <span>Pansy, let’s go to a lingerie boutique so I can get something unbelievably sexy to wear for my doltish, thick-headed Chosen One boyfriend.”   </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“I didn’t </span>
  <em>
    <span>say </span>
  </em>
  <span>that,” Draco hisses, angling his body away from her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I took a few creative liberties.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He is doltish…” Draco mutters, rubbing his right hand up and down his left arm, looking around the small but thoroughly stocked shop. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Pansy chortles. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, </span>
  <em>
    <span>that </span>
  </em>
  <span>you know I whole-heartedly agree.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s not </span>
  <em>
    <span>only </span>
  </em>
  <span>for him…” Draco says, again glaring away the hot-pink he felt rising to his cheeks. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Pansy glances at him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then what are you dawdling for?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco remains silent. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>What is he dawdling for? Well, a lot of things. For one, he’s in a </span>
  <em>
    <span>lingerie shop</span>
  </em>
  <span>. Draco has become a lot of things he never thought he’d accept of himself when he was a teenager, but donning something </span>
  <em>
    <span>so </span>
  </em>
  <span>feminine set the deeply ingrained barbed teeth of every pureblood standard he was raised with on edge. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s just underwear, Draco,” Pansy says drily. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I </span>
  <em>
    <span>know that</span>
  </em>
  <span>,” Draco sneers, his mounting frustration at himself doing nothing for his mood. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He imagines someone in the shop recognizing him. Draco Malfoy, notorious son of a Death Eater and (acquitted) Death Eater himself, pureblood kind-of-heir to the name of Malfoy, a house of the twenty-eight, seen shopping for </span>
  <em>
    <span>knickers</span>
  </em>
  <span>. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Even though the prospect itself is ridiculous, and Draco has spent the last five years telling himself </span>
  <em>
    <span>that that thestralshit doesn’t matter. </span>
  </em>
  <span>Either way it was improbable, since they’d chosen a muggle shop to go to. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>It’s just underwear</span>
  </em>
  <span>. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It’s also sixteen years old, crying in a bathroom because the Dark Lord is living in your house, and his stinking Death Eaters just eat you up, and you’re supposed to be preparing the gate that will let them loose on your school, and also figuring out some way to kill the man regarded as The Most Powerful Wizard Alive, and, oh yeah, you’re a fucking fag. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And Potter’s the only one who can pull off sexy scars, anyway. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Pussy up, Malfoy.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco huffs, and finally breaks away from Pansy to head towards the other side of the store. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He takes a deep breath through his nose. He knows Pansy’s right. </span>
  <em>
    <span>It’s just </span>
  </em>
  <span>underwear.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He walks slowly around a round table with lacy panties in an array of colors and styles arranged atop it. He pays little attention to the two mannequins situated in the center of the table that were little more than the lower half of torsos and upper thighs, modeling the underwear underneath them. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>As the creature of habit that he is, the dark green pair catches his eye first. They’re sort of small lacy shorts, which he reasons would be more practical for him than the bikini type. The lace is soft when he runs his fingers over it, and isn’t floral patterned, which he likes. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He thinks the medium size might fit him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Again, infernal hellfire once again springs to his face as though he’s only just now realizing he’s actually considering buying lingerie. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He snatches up the underwear before he can think about it for another miserable second, and moves on. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He wonders if he should get a top to match. Could he even? Or did they all have cups that he couldn’t fill and would look ridiculously awkward on him? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>That’s when he passes a rack of bralettes, sorted also by </span>
  <em>
    <span>small, medium, large </span>
  </em>
  <span>and so on in either direction. He brushes his hand over the sheer green lace of one, the match to the underwear draped over the crook of his arm. He, again, finds the medium and takes it off the rack. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is your shopping proving satisfactory?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco nearly flinches, turning on Pansy who has snuck up behind him. She holds a basket full of her own purchases. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, thank you,” Draco sneers. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Pansy nudges his side. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Find your chill, love.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco scoffs. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Pansy nods her head towards a display further down. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How about those, then?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco turns again to look in the direction Pansy indicated and sees mannequins up on a platform wearing strappy one-pieces. A black one with a bandage-like top, connected to the high-V bottoms by a criss-crossing of straps, making an ‘X’ over the torso. The second garment is a deep red halter-top, connected to the almost non-existent, thong-like bottoms by six thin vertical straps. Draco can’t imagine the confusing tangle of delicate red fabric it probably was off a mannequin.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Looks like a logic puzzle to get in and out of,” Draco says drily. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The end result is worth the effort,” Pansy answers. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is it?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Pansy turns to him with a smirk. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If only to see the dumb-struck, mouth-agape expression of your victims? Oh, yes.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t refer to your sexual partners as your </span>
  <em>
    <span>victims</span>
  </em>
  <span>,” Draco says, crinkling his nose in distaste. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Pansy runs her fingers through the right side of her hair, taming an out of place lock of it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Victims of my undeniable sex appeal,” Pansy clarifies. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco rolls his eyes, and then finds himself glancing in the direction of the mannequins once more. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Come on...don’t tell me you don’t want to,” Pansy goads. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco huffs out a sigh. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Shut up, Pansy, it’s underwear,” Draco declares before striding forward towards the display. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Pansy scoffs at his hypocritical parroting of her, and then follows behind him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco finds the rack the body-suits are on, and runs his fingers over the red one. Usually, he’d be adverse to the color on principle, but…</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Dumb Gryffindors…</span>
  </em>
  <span>” Pansy teases in a lyrical tone, snickering. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Shut up, Parkinson.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh it would be </span>
  <em>
    <span>priceless</span>
  </em>
  <span>. Draco Malfoy, slimey silver </span>
  <em>
    <span>lord </span>
  </em>
  <span>of house Slytherin, all wrapped up in </span>
  <em>
    <span>Gryffindor Red </span>
  </em>
  <span>for </span>
  <em>
    <span>The Boy Who Lived</span>
  </em>
  <span>,” Pansy says with an arrogant smirk. “The irony is enough to roll whole ancestral mausoleums upside down.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco breathes out an aggravated huff. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Like I care what a bunch of dead, dusty, blood-purists think about my lingerie purchases,” Draco draws. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Pansy barks out a laugh, grabbing on to Draco’s arm with her free hand. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, darling, did you </span>
  <em>
    <span>ever </span>
  </em>
  <span>think we’d come this far?” She asks, eyes bright with laughter. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What, when we were teenagers? Hardly.” Draco lifts his arm so that their arms are effectively linked. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Pansy says nothing for a moment. Several moments actually, which pass in utter static. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, are you going to get one, or are we just going to stand here, staring and reminiscing about the unmentionable in the unmentionables?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco groans, and grabs one of the red bodysuits that looks the most like it’ll fit him. He can charm it if it doesn’t. If he ever actually </span>
  <em>
    <span>puts it on</span>
  </em>
  <span>, that is. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Standing in their bathroom, Draco stares at himself in the mirror and has no idea how he’s ever going to be able to convince himself to walk out like this. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>‘This’ </span>
  </em>
  <span>being the lacy green underwear he picked up earlier in the day. The top sits flat against his chest, and he can’t shake the feeling that it just looks </span>
  <em>
    <span>odd</span>
  </em>
  <span>. The bottoms fit just as snugly, and are only slightly uncomfortable. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It’s hard for Draco to think of himself as </span>
  <em>
    <span>attractive</span>
  </em>
  <span>, what with his sharp, unwelcoming edges, lined with twisted and puckered scars, and the ugliest mark of them all obviously present on his left arm against the pale background of his flesh. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He reaches up, and takes his hair down from it’s bun. As it falls, the ends brush the tops of his shoulders. He pushes his hand through it, catching the tangles. Harry likes it down. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Harry. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry’s sitting out in the living room on the couch, waiting for Draco to come back, completely oblivious to anything Draco’s been up to all day. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco drags his fingers through his hair again. Nerves are sparking in his chest like he’s learning a spell for the first time. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Somehow, wearing the lingerie he feels even </span>
  <em>
    <span>more </span>
  </em>
  <span>naked than if he were completely naked. Potter’s already </span>
  <em>
    <span>seen that</span>
  </em>
  <span>. </span>
  <em>
    <span>This </span>
  </em>
  <span>feels like exposing himself in a whole new, even scarier way. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco huffs in frustration at himself, and perches on the edge of the tub. His knee starts bouncing immediately. It’s silly to get worked up over it. He either needs to do it, or </span>
  <em>
    <span>not </span>
  </em>
  <span>do it, and he just needs to decide, because all the fretting is dramatic. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He looks down at himself. The dark color contrasts with his light skin. He imagines what he might look like next to Harry’s darker skin, among their white sheets. The aesthetic might be enough motivation alone. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>That’s the point anyway, right? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It’s why he bought the cursed articles of clothing in the first place. To look </span>
  <em>
    <span>good</span>
  </em>
  <span>. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry thinks he looks good, he </span>
  <em>
    <span>knows</span>
  </em>
  <span> that much, he’s been told often enough. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>But he’s never seen me dressed like </span>
  </em>
  <span>this. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>What if he doesn’t like it? What if it’s </span>
  <em>
    <span>Not His Thing</span>
  </em>
  <span>? What if he looks at Draco, and his face falls because Draco’s </span>
  <em>
    <span>not </span>
  </em>
  <span>a woman? </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>It’s just underwear. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Find your chill, love. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Pussy up, Malfoy. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco takes a deep breath, and stands up, adjusting the underwear again. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He goes to the door, and unlocks it. It takes stealing all his nerves to open the door. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The cool air that washes over pretty much </span>
  <em>
    <span>all </span>
  </em>
  <span>of him, the thin, sheer lace doing little in the department of warmth, is nearly enough to make him slam the door shut again. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Oh, for Merlin’s sake! </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>He’s a </span>
  <em>
    <span>Malfoy</span>
  </em>
  <span>, damnit! If he can’t walk confidently out into the living room wearing lingerie, chin held up with the knowledge that anyone would be </span>
  <em>
    <span>lucky </span>
  </em>
  <span>to catch a </span>
  <em>
    <span>glimpse</span>
  </em>
  <span> of him, then he really </span>
  <em>
    <span>does </span>
  </em>
  <span>need to renounce his name. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco strides toward the open bedroom door, ignoring the fact that he gulps when the couch comes into view, Harry’s unruly head of hair visible. Draco stops in the doorway, and then decides to lean his right side against the doorframe, reaching up to hold it with his right hand. He breathes in, closing his eyes for a moment, and then schools his features into something familiar, eyebrow cocked and mouth tilted up into a confident smirk. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He raps his fingernails against the doorframe once. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry’s head turns, neck craning to look over the couch. When he spots Draco, his eyes go wide, eyes raking down and up again. Draco’s mouth starts to turn into a genuine smile, just about to let go of the doorframe and take a step closer...</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Then the bastard </span>
  <em>
    <span>laughs</span>
  </em>
  <span>. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco feels the uncomfortable warmth of trepidation, the nerves, and all the insecurity within him rush out, replaced instantly by cold, heavy, all-consuming rage. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He spins around, feeling, if possible, even </span>
  <em>
    <span>more </span>
  </em>
  <span>naked than the more naked he already felt. Fleeing through their bedroom, and back into the bathroom, slamming the door shut, locking it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He doesn’t turn on the light, instead, he sinks immediately to the floor, hugging his knees to his chest. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Crying in the bathroom again, Malfoy? </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>He sinks his teeth hard into his lip so that the sob that claws its way out of his chest doesn’t make it past his mouth. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Draco, no—I didn’t mean it like that! Please, open the door! Let me explain!” </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry’s frantic words spill muffled through the door, pounding it with his fist. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Get bent, Potter!” Draco calls back, ashamed to hear the thickness in his own voice.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Draco, please love, open the door! I would nev—I wasn’t making fun of you! Love—” </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Go Away!” </span>
  </em>
  <span>Draco shrieks. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He pushes himself up off the floor, furiously wiping at his face with the back of his hand, and then tugs the ridiculous bits of clothing off of him, obtaining a painful scratch from his fingernails down his left side in his haste. Both the lacy green top and bottoms go in the bin by the sink. He pulls on his pants, and trousers after, then struggles with the buttons of his shirt, hands shaking uselessly. After doing them up half-way, he grits his teeth in frustration and impatiently decides it’s good enough. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry is still spewing nonsense Draco </span>
  <em>
    <span>really </span>
  </em>
  <span>doesn’t want to listen to. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He unlocks and yanks open the door, interrupting Harry mid sentence. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry freezes, mouth hanging open like a stupid fish. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Move</span>
  </em>
  <span>,” Draco demands, stepping forward to try and push past him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry’s hands fly up, grabbing on to Draco’s biceps as he stares at him with wide eyes. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Draco, listen—” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>MOVE!</span>
  </em>
  <span> You dumb Gryffindor!” Draco shouts in his face, making him flinch. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry lets go of him, and steps to the side. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco heads straight for the dresser, where his wand lays next to a vial of nail polish and a copy of </span>
  <em>
    <span>Quidditch Weekly</span>
  </em>
  <span>. As soon as his fingers wrap around his wand, Draco vanishes with the telltale </span>
  <em>
    <span>crack </span>
  </em>
  <span>of apparition.</span>
