    <p>
  <span>Heavy footfalls shake the ground beneath where Boy is curled, fetal position. Clamorous voices yell in his ear; </span>
  <em>
    <span>“Burnt the dinner again, Boy, you’ll pay for those steaks.”</span>
  </em>
  <span> The crack of a belt against air replaces the voices seconds before burning pain blooms. Blood drips slowly down his back. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Seconds - minutes - hours pass like the blink of an eye, dragging through molasses. Worthless boy; freak; waste of space; the voices taunt occasionally, fading in and out like his consciousness. He is delirious with hunger, thirst, and blinding pain. It ebbs and flows like the tide. For some time he is left alone in the corner, nursing the broken skin, in a routine he has lived with for the past ten years. Around him, a pool of blood is forming, bright red against stark white tiles. Tiles he has spent hours and hours and </span>

  <span>scrubbing. This stain will take just as many to clean out. Still, the chance to sit and simply endure the throbbing, aching pain was a rare one. He is thankful for the respite, however brief it will prove itself to be. </span>
</p><p>
  <span> He is dragged back to reality by a suckerpunch in the form of his cousin’s toes in his kidney. Said cousin is standing over him, the glee Boy once saw in his cousin’s eyes as he pinned mice up by their tails, back with a vengeance. The pain he had been distancing himself from comes slamming back full force, stealing his breath, and his common sense. Knowing his cousin will do worse than prick him with thumbtacks and leave him hanging along the garden fence for cats and hawks, Boy reacts instinctively, like a feral dog backed into a corner. Boy grabs his cousins leg, nails piercing the skin, draws blood and a fleeting smile to Boy’s face. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>To bring pain to one who caused him so much seems therapeutic, in a twisted sense. The responding screech and crocodile tears that were drawn from his cousin remind Boy just how foolish his actions were. He knows he will regret his instinctive reaction shortly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The ground shakes again as Uncle enters the room. He sees the spots of blood under Boy’s nails and turns purple as he sees red. Screaming, loud and guttural, ensues. Uncle grabs the closest thing: a cast-iron skillet, filled with leftover dinner, still waiting in the pan to be scrapped into the trash. Uncle raises his arm, eyes bulging and veins dark spiderwebs popping under his skin, and swings down in a manner that reminds Boy, passingly, of the way flies are swatted - </span>

    <span>He opened his eyes to unfiltered sunlight directly overhead and deafening silence. His head was throbbing and aching like he’d been up reading until past midnight again. Tom blinked and sat up. </span>
