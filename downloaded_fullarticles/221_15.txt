    <p>
  <span>Draco remembered when he was very young, being sat down by his father to have ‘the talk’. Not the talk about sex, but about bringing honour to the Malfoy line. His family duty. And most importantly, avoiding shame and scandal.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He tried, oh, he tried so hard. He knew he had to act like he was a higher calibre of wizard, and he was, he knew it. But when that dratted Potter turned him away on the first day, choosing instead to associate with Weasel and that Mudblood girl… </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Well, that was when the problem all started.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Draco woke up early near the end of term. He had nearly finished his sixth year. He couldn’t wait to get out of school, to finally have freedom and do things on his own terms. Maybe move to Bulgaria. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Anywhere’s better than here,</span>
  </em>
  <span> he sulked to himself.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Of course, the black skull on his arm was a slight problem.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He dressed himself smartly in his freshly-pressed robes, using the dust-siphoning charm his mother had taught him so long ago to ensure they were thoroughly clean. His hair lay flat with some Sleekeazy’s hair gel (applied daily), and his shoes were shining brightly with a little-known Malfoy polishing charm. This was the Draco Malfoy that everyone knew, and he wasn’t about to let his polished exterior look dull or fade. Just because his stomach was wrapped in tight coils around itself - just because the Dark Lord himself was still waiting for Draco to kill Dumbledore…</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He shook off the thought. His mother had told him very firmly to </span>
  <em>
    <span>stay alive</span>
  </em>
  <span> and </span>
  <em>
    <span>keep up appearances,</span>
  </em>
  <span> and he intended to do just that. He marched down to breakfast with a lofty air, nodding curtly to the other Slytherin purebloods.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>During his study period, he went to the Room of Hidden Things again. He clenched his jaw and stared at the Vanishing Cabinet, wondering, not for the last time, if it would ever work again. He pulled a green apple out of his robes and placed it in the cabinet, closing the door gently. He laid his wand over the lock and chanted gently, </span>
  <em>
    <span>“Itineranturia. Itineranturia. Itineranturia.”</span>
  </em>
  <span> The cabinet wobbled slightly, a slight gust leaking out the crack in the door. He peered through it, and his heart leapt when he saw the apple was gone! Could it be working this time? All he had done was re-establish the protective wards over the hinges… That couldn’t be it… Could it?! He grinned wildly and laid his wand in the same position, willing it to work. </span>
  <em>
    <span>“Revenite. Revenite. REVENITE!”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>He opened the door slowly.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Fuck.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>The apple had returned, but sliced clean into seven slices. They wobbled with the cabinet, and Draco groaned. It was too much.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He referred back to the book he had nicked out of the restricted section. The magic was based on the simple vanishing charm </span>
  <em>
    <span>evanesco,</span>
  </em>
  <span> except instead of vanishing it to the void… Vanishing it back into something else. Basically. Draco still didn’t fully understand it himself… It was like one of the cabinets was a copy of itself from the void. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Oh.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Maybe that was it!</span>
</p><p>
  <span>In which case, then the travelling charm was entirely the wrong way of going about it. It would result in a splinching of sorts - could that be the slicing he had seen? Upon further reflection, he thought it was worth a shot. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He got out another green apple from his pocket (Undetectably extended, of course. What if he ran out of apples?). He placed it in the vanishing cabinet, having eaten all the other apple slices while thinking. His wand automatically found the position again after so much practice, and he whispered </span>
  <em>
    <span>“Evanesco.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>The cabinet vanished, and Draco felt a distinct tug at his magic from having vanished such a large item. He waited expectantly for the other cabinet to replace this one. It should work! Surely. They were like opposite sides of a piece of paper; flip one over, and you were presented with the other…</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But if it didn’t work that way, and he had just </span>
  <em>
    <span>vanished</span>
  </em>
  <span> his only chance at avoiding the Dark Lord’s wrath…</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco felt the world drop away from him, and he screamed in pain.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>That was how he ended up bent over the sink, with no one to talk to but Moaning Myrtle. “Don’t,” she crooned gently. Strange, but it helped as he sobbed. “Don’t… Tell me what’s wrong… I can help you…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No one can help me,” he heaved, shaking all over. “I can’t do it… I can’t… It won’t work… And unless I do it soon… He says he’ll kill me…” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He clutched at the basin for support, his grief and anger at his stupid, stupid life taking over. Everything was so much easier when he could just make snide remarks and hate Potter in peace. But now, he couldn’t even find it within him to hate the boy anymore… They were just stuck on different sides of the same battle. It wasn’t his fault, with his endearing green eyes and messy hair, that he was stuck on the losing side. Draco cried harder as he fought the feelings that had been bubbling away all year, about that </span>
  <em>
    <span>stupid Potter boy,</span>
  </em>
  <span> how would his </span>
  <em>
    <span>father</span>
  </em>
  <span> feel if he </span>
  <em>
    <span>knew - </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco looked up and saw him in the mirror, standing right there in the doorway He whipped around and drew his wand automatically, raising to fire - </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Honk!</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>In his shock, Draco forgot to fire the </span>
  <em>
    <span>tarantallegra</span>
  </em>
  <span> jinx and stared at the goose that had appeared - literally appeared out of nowhere - between them. Then he felt his ankle fly upwards, and he was hanging upside down. His wand clattered onto the floor and he cursed himself silently for loosening his grip.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I - what?” God, Potter couldn’t ever close his mouth, could he? That perfect, pink mouth… “Is that a goose?”</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Honk!</span>
  </em>
  <span> The beast flapped its wings menacingly at Potter, advancing on him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Aargh!” It charged and bit at his legs, going right past him and blocking the exit. “Malfoy! Did you do this?! What in the name of Merlin’s saggy left -” but at that the goose charged again, raising its wings above its head.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco had thought there was very little that could make his day brighter, but watching Potter get chased around the bathroom by a goose while being held aloft in relative safety was doing the trick nicely. Moaning Myrtle cackled in glee, floating above Potter and watching the spectacle. Eventually the boy got it into his head to </span>
  <em>
    <span>use his wand</span>
  </em>
  <span> and started firing hexes. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Immobulus!”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s too big for that, you thickhead!” Draco called.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, fine… </span>
  <em>
    <span>Petrificus Totalus!”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>But that didn’t work either. Interesting.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Stupefy! Stupefy! Stupefy!”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“If it didn’t work the first time, Potter, it’s not likely to work the second or third,” Draco drawled lazily. This was the best thing that had happened in weeks. And to think he’d been sobbing his eyes out just a few moments ago! Perhaps if he shared his memories of this with the Dark Lord, he wouldn’t kill him, just for the laugh.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Evanesco! Reducio! Protego!”</span>
  </em>
  <span> Well, he was creative, Draco had to give him that. It would have been entertaining if the goose had really shrunk down to a tiny size. But it didn’t. Somehow, it seemed, the goose was… magic-resistant…?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Oh, God.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Oh, no.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco hadn’t recognized it for what it was because he was too busy being </span>
  <em>
    <span>thick</span>
  </em>
  <span> and watching Potter’s forehead bead with sweat from exertion, his hair falling onto his damn-near-perfect face. It was the Soulmate Goose of Enforcement.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The Soulmate Goose of Enforcement was a funny creature, appearing in what were considered the most hopeless cases of the most destined soulmates ever to be. It would appear if both parties were inwardly extremely willing, but the external circumstances… well… made it difficult. The Goose was said to chase the soulmates around until this problem had been fixed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And that meant, that meant… That meant that Potter must be pining well too much on that Weasley girl.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He smacked his forehead with his hand - surprisingly hard to do in midair - and sighed. Well, that was just perfect. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Potter,” he called. “Potter, let me down! I know how to fix this.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The boy looked up in shock and flicked his wand slightly. Draco felt the invisible support around his ankle disappear and he fell onto the stone floor none too gently.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh - erm, sorry, Dra - Malfoy - erm -,” Potter stuttered. Draco stared at him as he got up, Goose forgotten for the moment.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Were you about to call me </span>
  <em>
    <span>Draco,</span>
  </em>
  <span> Potter?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Draco </span>
  <em>
    <span>Potter?</span>
  </em>
  <span> No?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I meant - oh - bloody hippogriff,” Draco cursed as the goose pecked the back of his knee sharply, causing him to fall forwards. He fell onto the floor hard (again!), almost crashing into Potter. “I thought the Soulmate Goose was for you!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sorry, the… the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Soulmate Goose???”</span>
  </em>
  <span> Myrtle gasped and started roaring with laughter in the background. Of course, Potter would have no idea what a Soulmate Goose was. He probably didn’t even know true soulmates existed. Probably didn’t even know how undeniably attractive he was right now -</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, Potter. Ask your Granger friend about it when she bothers you, alright? And if you tell anyone what you saw here, I’ll - I’ll hex your face off.” It didn’t sound as threatening as it did childish, but Potter just raised an eyebrow and nodded as Draco made his escape out of the bathroom. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The Goose followed.</span>
