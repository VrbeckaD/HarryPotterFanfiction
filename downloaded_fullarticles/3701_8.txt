    <p>Harry, Ron, and Hermione walked along the corridors making their way to their Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom. Both Hermione and Ron could see Harry’s consternation. “What’s the matter, Harry?” The frizzy haired girl asked.</p><p align="left">He looked at her with nervous eyes. “I’m just wondering who they got to fill the position this year.” He offered. “From what I’ve been given to understand, at the time of my trial, Dumbledore hadn’t found anyone yet.”</p><p align="left">“I heard he even contacted people in America,” Ron said. “I didn’t even know there were wizards and witches in the states.”</p><p align="left">Harry and Hermione both nodded. “During the tournament last year, the Salem Witch’s and Wizard’s Academy was present. They didn’t compete, but they were there.” Harry said.</p><p align="left">Hermione looked at Ron narrow-eyed. “As large as America is, how could you think that, Ron?”</p><p align="left">“I just…” He looked at Harry and shrugged. “I don’t know. Mum and dad never said anything. I figured of any of the wizarding families, <em>mine</em> would have family in the states.”</p><p align="left">Harry chuckled. “Some long lost brother, Ron?”</p><p align="left">Again, he just shrugged.</p><p align="left">“Well, I heard from Lavender, who heard Pansy talking to Blaise, who was saying that Draco told him we actually might have <em>two</em> instructors this year. And that they’re brothers.” Hermione said.</p><p align="left">“So you have no idea who it is,” Harry said, looking at her.</p><p align="left">“Not with any degree of certainty, no.” She admitted. “But I’m excited.” She added, smiling. “I had heard that if Dumbledore couldn’t find someone, they were going to appoint Dolores Umbridge.”</p><p align="left">Harry’s heart clenched in his chest. He remembered the sickly sweet way she smiled at him all through his trial. The very prospect of his expulsion from Hogwarts seemed of particular pleasure to the woman. He couldn’t <em>imagine</em> how horrible the year would have been if the toad had been placed in charge of <em>actual</em> students.</p><p align="left">Harry’s ears perked up as they approached the classroom. “Do you two hear music?” He asked, curiously. Many of the students in the halls were surprised. “What <em>is</em> that?”</p><p align="left">Hermione smiled brightly. “That’s Creedence Clearwater Revival.” She said, turning to Ron and Harry. “My father listens to this. I believe this is <em>Run Through The Jungle </em>from their Cosmo’s Factory album, circa 1970.”</p><p align="left">“I like it,” Ron said, immediately bobbing his head.</p><p align="left">Harry, for his part, wasn’t sure what to make of it. Vernon always listened to horrible music from the…he wasn’t actually sure what era it was from. All he knew is that it sounded terrible.</p><p align="left">They entered the room and found the music coming from an extremely large stereo that looked as if it had been pieced together from various bits and bobs. Huge speakers sat in the four corners of the room. A silver and black chrome cassette deck sat on a shelf by the office door.</p><p align="left">Two men were in the room waiting as the class began to make their way in. One of the pair had a head of shoulder-length dark hair and serious eyes. His dark blue denim jacket hung on his lean frame as he leaned back in the chair with his arms crossed and his booted feet up on the desk.</p><p align="left">The second man appeared to be a bit shorter, but a fair bit more muscular. His hair was cut almost military short and he wore a blue long sleeve sweater with the sleeves pushed back over his thick forearms. His eyes were every bit as serious but carried a very distinct inner humor in them. He was leaning against the desk as the students came in. His lips were pursed and he was pantomiming playing the drums as he watched the children.</p><p align="left">“Okay,” Harry said, dragging the word out as he took his seat with his mates. “This is different.” He looked to Hermione and Ron. “Definitely American.” Both of them nodded to him.</p><p align="left">After a few minutes of everyone getting settled, the short-haired man moved over and turned off the stereo. He turned and moved up to the front of the class and wrote <strong><em>WINCHESTER</em> </strong>across the blackboard, then underlined it twice. He dropped the chalk and spun to stand in front of the desk. “Good morning, class. Welcome to Defense Against the Dark Arts or what me and my brother like to call Evil Killin’ One-Oh-One.” He began pacing. “My name is Dean Winchester, that there is my brother Sam.” He pointed to the man behind the desk, who simply waved. “Say Hi, Sam.”</p><p align="left">“Hi, Sam.” The man offered, nonchalantly, earning a chuckle from a lot of the students in the room.</p><p align="left">Dean looked at him and rolled his eyes before looking back to the class. “You’re learning everything there is to know about wand magic and quick casting, so there’s no sense in us goin’ down that road.” Hermione’s hand shot up. Dean looked at her and turned to the desk, picking up the seating chart.</p><p align="left">“Granger, Hermione,” Sam said, staring at the girl. “Go ahead.”</p><p align="left">“Showoff,” Dean said. He whirled and smiled at her. “Yo, curly-Q. What’s your question?”</p><p align="left">Hermione blushed a little but nodded. “Does that mean you’re <em>not</em> going to be teaching us magic?”</p><p align="left">“Sam?” He asked, looking at his brother.</p><p align="left">“Not as you know it.” Sam returned. “I’m going to teach you about magic that I can guarantee <em>none</em> of the other teachers in this school know anything about. But that’ll come later.”</p><p align="left">The answer seemed to please Hermione.</p><p align="left">“But right now, it’s time to learn about the basics,” Dean said, turning to the desk. He opened the large duffel bag. He removed what looked like a sawed-off shotgun. Many of the children gasped sharply. “This is the Winchester Model 1901, lever action shotgun. This particular model has been cut down for easy transport and concealability.” He jacked the lever to demonstrate. “Twelve-gauge diameter,” He pointed to the barrel. “Standard grip, good for righties and lefties.” He set it down and pulled a belt of shells from the bag. “A word on firepower. You’ve got your standard buckshot, birdshot, flechette round and solid slug.” He took the four out and set them down. “Then for the supernatural, we’ve some special concoctions.” He began pulling shells out one at a time. “Silver nitrate round, good for vampires and werewolves. Rock salt, good for ghosts, poltergeists and phantoms.” He waved the bullet around. “Got a few of those here, I’ve noticed. Cool guys, just creepy as hell. But that piss-ant Peeves starts static, he’s eatin’ one of these babies.” He set it down and moved on. “You got a holy-water gel round, also for vampires, but works on a lot of demons, too. Then you got a wonderfully dangerous white phosphorus round, or what we in the business call a Dragon’s Breath round.” He grinned. “My favorite. This baby burns at three thousand degrees Fahrenheit and turns everything you fire it out of into a single use flamethrower. Aside from things without a body, this boy will torch anything. Then we’ve got the…”</p><p align="left">Harry buried his face in his hands as Dean went on to describe a lot of other makes and models of firearms. “Are you alright, Harry?” Hermione asked.</p><p align="left">“Given my track record with Defense Against the Dark Arts Professors?” He looked at Hermione and Ron. “I just <em>know</em> I’m getting shot by the end of the year.”</p><p align="left">The pair looked at him. They looked to the two brothers. Dean was doing all the talking and seemed to be genuinely enjoying himself.</p><p align="left">The two youngsters suddenly understood that Harry was right. And both couldn’t help but whimper in sympathy for him.</p>
