    <p>
  <span>There were many stories that circulated among the halls and towers and dungeons and classrooms of Hogwarts about the self-styled Marauders.  The four mischievous boys had filled a firecracker-shaped hole left by the even more infamous Prewett twins after their second year, and were set to outgrow their predecessors’ legends by the time they graduated.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>However, a few of their exploits were only known to a select handful of people.  A certain redheaded girl, eventually, and later a messy-haired boy with her eyes.  Another pair of redheaded twins, eerily similar to their namesake predecessors. A twinkling, plotting headmaster and a secretly fond deputy headmistress. Another redheaded boy and a bushy-haired girl.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>And one story was held in the deepest, blackest part of a grudge-carrying Slytherin.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>A prank gone terribly wrong. A disaster narrowly averted.  A life debt owed. A friendship slightly fractured, leaving holes for treacherous seeds to grow.  </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>In one version of that story, the singular member of the Marauders who plays the prank is not punished.  The headmaster sees a potential - for what, you might ask - and the boy slinks back to the dormitory with his tail tucked between his legs, only somewhat chastised.  The outraged Slytherin is forced into silence, and eventually, events unfold that leave one of the Marauders dead, another thought to be, the third sunken into a deep depression, and the fourth, player of the prank, in Azkaban.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>This is not that version of the story.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The sands of time turn, and fate twists in a different direction.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>This is another, different version of that story.  Instead of Sirius Black playing the prank, it is Peter Pettigrew.  Instead of the prankster getting off with a slap on the wrists, he is expelled.  The Slytherin is still spelled to secrecy, a friendship is still cracked, and the boy who is occasionally a werewolf is still alone on that final moon of their fifth year at Hogwarts.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Well...almost alone.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <b>June 1976</b>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It was the final full moon of the self-styled Marauders’ fifth year, but Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs were definitely </span>
  <em>
    <span>not </span>
  </em>
  <span>spending it together, like they had planned to do.  Due to the actions of a lovestruck stag, a snivelling Slytherin, an angry flower of a girl, a lying rat, and a loyal black dog, there was now only an angry werewolf, who somewhere, in the back of his mind, housed a terrified boy.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The wolf howled and raged against the walls of his cage.  He could smell the fear in the air, with such a sharp human spice to it, and he longed to follow that scent.  Moony threw himself at the boarded-up windows of the shack with no regard for the body he shared with the boy, and eventually, one of the windows cracked enough that he could wriggle his way out.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He started running, following the fear that had sent him in a frenzy, but froze mid-lope as another scent overtook his nostrils.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Something new was in the Forbidden Forest.  Something wild, and terrifying, and sweet. Something that called to both the wolf and the boy, promising them both their every desire - for revenge and companionship, for answers and freedom.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Moony started to follow the scent, but just as he reached the edge of the clearing that held the mysterious new thing, a large black dog came barrelling into his side, knocking him off of the path.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The wolf snapped his jaws at the dog.  A hate that wasn’t entirely Moony’s drove the wolf towards the black dog in an attempt to pin him to the ground and make him </span>
  <em>
    <span>yield</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Now boys,” a soft voice called out from the clearing just beyond them.  “Play nice,” she commanded.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The two sprang apart, bodies pulled by something that wasn’t entirely their own volition.  Remembering his original goal, the wolf loped into the clearing, with the black dog cautiously following behind him, a few paces back.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>A girl stood in the middle of the open space, more wild than the wolf and the forest that surrounded them.  Her small form was covered in a tattered red dress, a large tear in the skirt revealing the lean, muscled length of a thigh with a wand strapped to it.  She was leaning on a large staff carved out of vinewood, nearly as tall as she was and bound with silver in the middle. Tangled curls waved around her face, filled with leaves and other debris and sparking with magic.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It was her face that held the attention of both the wolf and the dog, though.  Underneath those messy curls was a heart shaped face, its sweetness at odds with the overly sharp canines that poked slyly out of her open mouth and the dangerous glowing wolf-gold of her eyes.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The werewolf imperative to bite and infect sent Moony leaping towards her, teeth bared.  Before the dog could even attempt to knock the wolf off-course again, the girl batted the wolf away with her staff.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Girl and wolf circled each other slowly, the wolf growling and the girl dragging her staff against the ground.  “Stop that, Mr. Moony,” the girl implored. “You know me. We’re connected, you and I, in more ways than one.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The wolf momentarily paused, studying the girl.  Something about her scent was familiar to him, though he’d never smelled it before.  Her golden eyes bored into his matching ones, warily watching as they both continued to circle around each other.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Unnoticed by either, the black dog at the edge of the trees watched the two wild things in the woods.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>When they had completed a full circle, the girl slammed the butt of her staff against the ground.  A shockwave of magic reverberated through the forest, filling the air with the sharp tang of ozone, the heavy, staticy feeling of lightning, and the heady scent of wild honey and poppies.  A ring of bluebell flames surround the wolf and the girl, leaving the dog alone outside the circle.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Holding onto her staff, the girl tiredly lowered herself to sit on the ground.  “You don’t scare me, Mr. Moony,” she said quietly as she laid her staff on the ground.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The wolf sat back on its haunches and tilted its head inquisitively at the girl.  Something about that name - </span>
  <em>
    <span>Moony </span>
  </em>
  <span>- and the way she said it made him pause.  It was...fond. Full of warmth. Almost teasing in its affection.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The girl leaned forward and wrapped her hands around one knee.  With a sickening crunch, she popped it back into place.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The dog, still watching from beyond the circle, whined.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The wolf spotted marks on her shoulders, and he crept forward to inspect the familiar scars.  The girl lifted her heavy fall of hair, twisting it up so Moony could see the grouping of claw marks that trailed up each shoulder blade.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Beneath the honey-and-poppy scent of the girl, Moony could detect the faintest whiff of dirt-and-blood, a terribly tainted smell that lingered ever so faintly on his skin, too.  </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Moony licked one of the scars, and the girl gave a surprised giggle.  He curled up around her side, and the girl tilted over to rest her head on his ribs.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Unnoticed by either the wolf or the girl, the black dog watched their interactions.  When the two curled up together, he sprinted away, barking for a stag that was not there.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius burst into the Gryffindor common room, panting like a dog in a summer heatwave.  Ignoring the confused and judgmental looks from his housemates - they’d all heard about his part in the stunt by the lake earlier, and the subsequent loss of house points - he dashed up the stairs that led to his dormitory.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Prongs! Prongs!” he yelled.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What?” James said irritably as he threw things haphazardly into his trunk.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“There’s a girl in the forest,” Sirius panted as he bent over and braced his hands on his knees.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“We nearly get expelled, Peter </span>
  <em>
    <span>is </span>
  </em>
  <span>expelled, and you come in here yelling about some girl?” James gave him a disgusted look.  “Godric’s ghost!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius waved his hands impatiently.  “No, you’re not listening! There’s a </span>
  <em>
    <span>girl </span>
  </em>
  <span>in the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Forbidden Forest</span>
  </em>
  <span>.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“So? I heard you the first time.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“So?! </span>
  <em>
    <span>Moony </span>
  </em>
  <span>is in the woods!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Seriously?” Before Sirius could answer, James groaned.  “Sod off, Padfoot. How the bloody hell did Moony get into the woods? You were supposed to keep an eye on him while I appealed to McGonagall about Peter!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“He broke the boards off one of the windows about the time I got back to the shack and took off at a dead sprint for the woods,” Sirius explained.  </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“C’mon then,” James said, grabbing a silvery cloak out of the depths of his messy trunk.  “We’ve already saved one person from being mauled, might as well make it two for two.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“D’you think…” Sirius said hesitantly.  James paused in the doorway to their dorm to turn back and look at his friend.  “D’you think we should maybe tell someone?” he mumbled.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Like who?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Minnie, maybe?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The two boys hurried down the stairs.  “Maybe. She’s not happy with us over the situation with Sni- Severus,” James corrected himself.  “She might believe us, or she might just feed us to the giant squid and be done with it,” James said, half-joking and half-serious.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The sharp voice of the professor in question made both boys freeze at the bottom of the stairs.  James hurriedly shoved his invisibility cloak behind his back, and Sirius moved a half-step closer to James to help hide the mess of shimmering fabric.  “And just where do you two think you are going?” Professor McGonagall asked them.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Um…” they stuttered in unison.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>McGonagall stared at her two formerly most favorite students over the tops of her square spectacles.  “If I see so much as a finger outside this tower before it is time to board the train tomorrow, I will personally make sure you join your </span>
  <em>
    <span>friend</span>
  </em>
  <span> Mr. Pettigrew,” she hissed disdainfully.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes ma’am,” James said, wide-eyed.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“But-” Sirius said, his words cut off with a grunt as James elbowed him in the ribs.  “Yes ma’am,” he echoed reluctantly.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Now, off to bed for the both of you,” she said, pointing a finger at the staircase.  Under her relentless stare, the two boys slowly turned and trudged back up the stairs.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Somewhere outside the tower, a wolf howled.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <b>May 1999</b>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The world outside Hogwarts’ hallowed walls was quiet, almost peaceful - so different from a year ago that day.  A full moon shone through the narrow windows in the fourth floor corridor, its silvery light caressing the figure of a woman in a beautiful red ball gown pacing below the stairwell to Gryffindor tower, the click of her heels audible over the muffled sounds of the a party going on a few floors below her.  </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The first annual Remembrance Ball was being held in the repaired Great Hall, a mere ten minute walk from the tower, but Hermione Granger did not want to attend it.  She had the dress, the heels, the nice hair, the inspiring speech and the polite smile all prepared, but the act of simply walking down the stairs to the Great Hall seemed to be beyond her capabilities.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“This is so illogical,” she muttered to herself as she paced the empty hallway at the base of the Gryffindor Tower.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What is?” an unexpected voice asked from the darkened end of the hallway.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione whirled around, wand at the ready and a hex at the tip of her tongue.  A familiar figure melted out of the shadows, and one of Hermione’s mentors walked towards her.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh, it’s you,” Hermione said tiredly.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Madam Moira Stuart, nee McGonagall, second-in-charge in the Department of Mysteries and longest-serving currently active Unspeakable, arched an eyebrow at the young woman.  “And here I am with something that might interest you,” she said, lazily waving her wand and casting anti-eavesdropping wards around them.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“And what is that?” Hermione asked, arching an eyebrow back as she parted the slit the skirt of her red dress and slid her wand into the holster strapped to one thigh.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“An offer,” Unspeakable Stuart said, pulling a small box out of the pocket of her robes and tossing it to the other woman.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione gingerly opened the box to reveal a tarnished silver necklace, barely glinting in the low light, resting on top of a tightly folded piece of parchment.  She pulled the necklace out, revealing a long chain with a small silver medallion on it. She looked closer at the medallion, thumb running over the outline of an apple tree, with a sword and wand crossed over the trunk, etched on one side as she flipped it over and tried to translate the runes on the back.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Put it on,” Unspeakable Stuart commanded, and Hermione complied, tucking the medallion under the neckline of her dress.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Is this an offer from your department?” Hermione asked uncertainly, finger tapping against the parchment still folded in the box.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Unspeakable Stuart shook her head.  “Hell no,” she said. “My department is still a fuckin’ shitshow from the war, and I don’t trust that you wouldn’t end up dead within a week,” she said bluntly.  “No, this is something else entirely. Have you ever heard of the Daughters of Avalon?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It was a secret society of women supposedly dating back to the time of Merlin,” Hermione said puzzledly.  “Supposedly founded by Morgan le Fay and a group of witches she handpicked. For what ends, no one really knows.  The existence of the group has mostly been discredited by magical historians, though a few still argue that it once existed.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It still exists,” Unspeakable Stuart said as she glanced at the watch pinned to her robes.  “I wish I had time to explain more to you, but suffice to say that you have been chosen to join our ranks. Min and I were going to explain all of this to you after you graduated, but due to unexpected circumstances such as my impending arrest by Aurors, we have to do this now,” the older woman said blithely as she took Hermione’s arm and started leading her down towards the Great Hall.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Wait, what?” Hermione said, digging in her heels.  “What are you talking about? Why are you being arrested?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Unspeakable Stuart opened her mouth to explain further, but a magically amplified voice boomed up from the first floor.  “Unspeakable Stuart, you are under arrest for violating the secrecy pact of the Department of Mysteries, for theft of restricted objects from the Department of Mysteries, and for the usage of restricted magics.  Surrender your wand and any stolen items, or prepare to be brought down by Aurors!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“This is it, Hermione,” the older woman said as she pulled out her wand.  “Do you want to go along with the Ministry bullshit, or do you want to fix everything and give Harry the life he deserves?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione did not hesitate.  She would do anything for Harry.  </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She pulled out her wand again, and together the two witches started casting.  The Unspeakable threw several blasting spells in the direction of the team of Aurors who were invading the Remembrance Ball, and her protegee warded them.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“We have to go,” Stuart said, tugging Hermione towards the stairs.  Hermione quickly kicked off her heels and ripped the bottom half of her skirt off before following the older witch down the stairs.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No, this way,” Hermione said, tugging Stuart towards one of the hidden passages on the fourth floor that she knew of thanks to the Marauder’s Map.  They darted through the passage, which spit them out in a little used corridor on the third floor.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hands grabbed Hermione’s arms and she reacted instinctively, driving her elbow back into one person’s gut as she shot a stupefy over her shoulder at the second.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“‘Mione,” Ron grunted when Hermione whirled away from him.  “Listen, just let us take in Stuart. We won’t hurt you,” he promised.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She gave a humorless chuckle.  “Too late for that,” she said bitterly.  Who did this man - no, boy - think he was? Or did he just conveniently forget the fact that he’d unceremoniously dumped her five months before, in front of his entire family and over Christmas? Or what about abandoning them on their quest, or the six years of mockery and teasing that she’d gotten while in Hogwarts with him?</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione’s eyes darted to Unspeakable Stuart, who was being restrained by Ron and Harry’s supervising Auror.  The women’s eyes met, and Stuart gave Hermione a grim smile as she tightened her fist around something.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione pointed her wand at Ron, distracting him with the glowing tip as she slid a hand down her left thigh and into her beaded bag, disillusioned and strapped to her leg.  As she started to cast hexes at Ron - low level, simple things meant to keep him occupied - she slowly pulled out a short silver cylinder, covered in carvings of runes and roses.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Hermione,” Stuart yelled, struggling against the warded cuffs the Auror had clapped on one wrist and was trying to strap to her other arm.  “Go all the way back. Fix things. The letter explains it all,” she said cryptically, before nodding and silently mouthing </span>
  <em>
    <span>one, two.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione slid her wand back into its holster as, on the count of </span>
  <em>
    <span>three, </span>
  </em>
  <span>Stuart threw something small and shiny through the air.  Hermione took off sprinting after it, jumping onto the edge of the stone balcony and then leaping off of it to catch the sparkling Time Turner flying through the air towards the first floor.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Molliare</span>
  </em>
  <span>!” she cried as she tumbled through the air.  The cushioning charm made her landing on the hard stone floor of the castle slightly less jarring, and Hermione used the momentum to roll forward, past the stunned Aurors waiting on the ground, and to run towards the door that led onto the grounds.</span>
</p>
<p><span>“</span><em><span>Legati</span></em> <em><span>pandi</span></em><span>!” she yelled, and the silver cylinder in her hand expanded to become a carved vinewood staff, inset with aquamarine, smoky quartz, calcite, moonstone, and garnet stones around the top third of the staff, which reached almost to her head.  Hermione swung the staff in a horizontal arc, and a bubble of magic pushed the Aurors back from her as she ran towards the grounds.</span></p>
<p>
  <span>“Get her! She has the Time Turner!” one of the Aurors behind her yelled.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Things were a blur after that.  Hermione ran and ran, smooth stone corridors giving way to supple grass and then to the harsher ground of the forest under her bare feet.  Brambles and stray hexes scratched her skin as she dodged the Aurors and sought safety in the Forbidden Forest.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The blasts from her staff managed to eventually stun all of the Aurors but one, who bravely followed her deeper into the dark forest.  He sent a curse at her, but luckily she tripped over a tree root just then, knocking her to the ground and out of the path of his spell.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Her knee throbbed painfully, and Hermione knew from experience that it had probably been dislocated...again.  She used her staff to haul herself up, and then turned to face her opponent.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“C’mon, Granger,” a vaguely familiar voice said as the blonde man caught up to her.  “Just hand over the Time Turner, and you and I can walk back to the Great Hall and get Madam Pomfrey to check your knee.  It’s dislocated, isn’t it? Probably pretty painful, too.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“McLaggen?” she said, peering through the darkening light of the forest as dusk overtook them.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Give it up, Granger.  You’re a smart girl, you know you can’t win this,” he said patronizingly.  “I’ll protect you from the cuffs, one Gryffindor to another,” he said, giving her a charming smile that, she imagined, he thought worked quite well on women.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Her thumb and middle finger ran over the edges of the single hoop around the Time Turner in her hands until she found the bolts the connected it to the hourglass.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What is the charge against Unspeakable Stuart?” she asked, stalling for time as she tightened her grip on her staff and wordlessly started casting a small circle of protection around herself.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“She is deliberately undermining new Ministry policies,” Cormac said flatly, as if reciting from a script he didn’t fully comprehend the meaning of.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione, however, understood.  There had been rumors - hushed whispers, really - of a Muggleborn registry being formed.  So they could understand how magic appeared spontaneously in families, supposedly. To protect Muggleborns and help ensure more of them would exist in future generations, or so they said.  But the whole endeavor was washed in a shade of pink that Hermione had a deep, personal, loathing for, and she was smart enough to know that should that registry come to fruition, she would be the first to undergo ‘testing.’  Even on the Light side, there were some old, pureblooded families that couldn’t comprehend how a witch like </span>
  <em>
    <span>her </span>
  </em>
  <span>could be so magically powerful.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione had already bled enough for the magical world, and she had the scars to prove it.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“One Gryffindor to another, huh?” Hermione sneered.  “You should know that a Gryffindor never backs down from a fight. Especially </span>
  <em>
    <span>this </span>
  </em>
  <span>Gryffindor,” Hermione said as she stamped her staff against the ground, completing her warded circle.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Cormac cast a stunner at her, but it bounced harmlessly off of her wards.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh, Cormac,” Hermione said, a faux note of pity dripping into her voice.  “You couldn’t catch me at Slughorn’s party when we were in school; what makes you think you’ll be able to do it now?”  She raised the hand holding the Time Turner delicately between two fingers. “They say I’m the cleverest witch of my age,” she said mockingly before twisting her fingers and winking out of existence there.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Or rather...out of existence </span>
  <em>
    <span>then.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The </span>
  <em>
    <span>when </span>
  </em>
  <span>of her landing is much more interesting than the </span>
  <em>
    <span>where</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>

</p>
<p>
  <b>June 1976</b>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione landed with a heavy thump on her arse in the middle of the Forbidden Forest.  Her stomach rolled and her head spun, and she clamped her lips together in an effort not to vomit.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She let herself fall back, and laid with arms and legs sprawled on the rough floor of the forest.  A rock dug into the small of her back, and she focused on the pressure as she pulled herself back together, atom by atom, centimeter by centimeter, until she felt like a person again, and not a skin-covered blob that had been squeezed through a tube of toothpaste.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Without sitting up, she tilted the top of her staff towards the sky and cast a Tempus spell.  </span>
  <em>
    <span>June 20th, 1976, 9:57 pm</span>
  </em>
  <span> hovered in smoky writing above her head.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Familiar scents filled the air around her.  The sharp, staticky smell of magic in general, and the richer, sweeter scent of her own magic.  The rich, fertile smell of the soil and the wild, growing scent of the Forbidden Forest. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The scents of chocolate and parchment, underlaid by the barest hint of blood and bone, reached her next, quickly followed by the scents of leather, smoke and rain.  Both were scent combinations that she had not smelled in years, but they were still burnt into her psyche as surely as the spell for bluebell flames and her parents’ original telephone number, after all this time.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>A familiar howl echoed throughout the forest, and Hermione instantly shot to her feet.  Ignoring her pounding head and throbbing knee, she gripped her staff tighter and starting chanting a warding spell around herself.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>There was a growl and then the sound of two bodies hitting the ground.  A wolf and a Grim landed at the edge of the clearing she was in, oblivious to the human in the woods as they snapped their jaws and snarled each other.  The dog was trying to knock the wolf back out of the clearing, and the wolf was very clearly trying to rip the dog’s throat out.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Just like old times, then.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Now boys,” she said, startling herself at how husky and raw her voice sounded.  “Play nice.” She could feel the magic that hummed through her body, something not entirely under her own control, and the wolf and dog almost instantaneously sprang apart at her command.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The wolf recovered first, and he quickly moved away from the dog and towards her, growling ominously as he stalked towards her.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>A challenging growl grew in Hermione’s throat, and she could feel her features sharpening, teeth and fingernails extending.  She knew that if she were to see her reflection right now, her eyes would be glowing goldenly and her hair sparking at the ends.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Her eyes tracked the bunching of muscles underneath the wolf’s skin and by the time he leapt towards her, Hermione had pulled up her staff and swung it, sending the wolf flying away from her.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He landed gracefully on his feet, and started another slow stalk towards her, this time with a more roundabout route.  Cognizant of the the runes she’d cast, still hovering in the air around her, Hermione walked a circle, counterpoint to the wolf, and drew a connecting line through her runes with her staff.  At each cardinal point, she instinctively rotated her staff, drawing a small loop on each quarter of the circle.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span> “Stop that, Mr. Moony,” she chided him, hoping to distract him from scenting the powerful magics she was using.  “You know me. We’re connected, you and I, in more ways than one.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The wolf just watched her, like she was prey.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>They completed their circle, and Hermione stamped the base of her staff against the ground.  Magic poured out of her, rustling the trees around them and rocking the dog, hovering in the background, off of his feet.  Her signature ring of bluebell flames sprung up around Hermione and the wolf, and she relaxed, knowing that whatever came next, she would be safe so long as she was inside those flames.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Knee throbbing, Hermione lowered herself back to the ground.  The wolf continued to growl at her, and she sighed. “You don’t scare me, Mr. Moony,” she told him tiredly. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Honestly, though.  She’d once caught Remus sliding through the kitchen in Grimmauld Place in his socks as he raced to keep his not-so-secret chocolate stash out of Sirius’ hands, as the animagus chased him with a feather duster.  They’d both crashed into the kitchen table and then onto the floor in a heap of limbs and oversized sweaters, laughing madly like the mischievous boys they once were.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It was rather hard to take him seriously after that.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The wolf sat back and watched her, wary and waiting.  Hermione ignored him and instead reset her knee, wincing at the loud crack that filled the clearing.  From the corner of her eye, she watched as the wolf slowly crept forward until he could stretch his body out to sniff at her shoulders, where Hermione knew her own scars from Greyback were clearly exposed.  She lifted her hair off of her back so he could see the marks more clearly.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Bracing herself for a bite, Hermione nearly jumped out of her skin when his cold nose touched her skin, followed by the wet rasp of his tongue.  </span>
  <em>
    <span>Rather forward, Mr. Moony</span>
  </em>
  <span>, she thought, giggling a little incoherently to herself.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Something like a fish hook, catching behind her sternum, jerked inside Hermione the moment Moony touched his nose to her skin.  Sparks danced behind her eyes, and an odd tingling feeling filled her limbs. Behind her, she could feel a shudder dance over the wolf.  </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The wolf made an odd huffing noise.  Then, much like an certain oversized puppy she once knew, the wolf curled up next to her, as docile as his human counterpart.  Hermione tilted over to lay against his side, and if a few hysterical tears happened to drip onto his fur, well...it’s not like wolves can tell the difference between happy and sad tears.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Once the moon had set and the sun had started its ascent, Hermione banished a sleeping, </span>
  <em>
    <span>human</span>
  </em>
  <span> Remus to the Hospital Wing before slowly trudging up the path through the Forbidden Forest that led to a little-used side door.  With a wave of her hand and a muttered chain of spells, she disillusioned and silenced herself, and added a notice-me-not for extra safety.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She slipped inside the castle and quietly wove through the small groups of students that were already up for the day, heading for where she knew Professor McGonagall’s quarters were.  She waited until the fourth floor corridor she was in cleared out, she pulled her copy of the Marauder’s Map out of her beaded bag and opened it. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I solemnly swear I am up to no good,” she whispered.  As the ink spread, Hermione tracked her eyes over the map until she found herself.  The map-version of herself had a little bubble appear above her head, and Hermione tiredly squinted at the tiny writing to see that the current password to McGonagall’s office was </span>
  <em>
    <span>Nimue</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione let herself into the Transfiguration professor’s rooms and slowly sank down onto the oversized chintz couch on which she’d sipped many cups of tea, back in her time.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The professor herself came striding out of her bedroom, wand at the ready and wrapped in a tartan robe.  “Who are you and how did you get into my quarters?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione didn’t move from where she was slumped against the couch cushions.  “My name is Hermione, and you are one of my mentors - or rather, you will be.  You introduced me to your younger sister, who recruited me to the Daughters of Avalon.  And most importantly, you keep a stash of eighteen year old Glenlivet behind that portrait of Godric Gryffindor,” she finished, jerking her chin towards the portrait of the founder of their house that hung over the fireplace.  “And I would love a tipple.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Prove to me that you are a Daughter,” McGonagall commanded.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione lifted the medallion from the neckline of her dress and held it up for the other woman to see. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>McGonagall held her wand out for a long moment, and then waved it at the portrait, which swung open to reveal the bottles of scotch hidden behind it.  The bottle floated out, along with two crystal tumblers, and two healthy pours of scotch filled the glasses. One glass floated to Hermione, and she gratefully took it and drank half the contents in one long swallow.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I also have a letter,” Hermione said, setting her staff aside to untie her beaded bag from her leg and removed the box Stuart had given her.  She pulled the folded parchment out, and it shimmered slightly, alerting Hermione to the magics that had been cast on it. Hermione gingerly held it between her thumb and forefinger and passed it to her past-future professor.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>McGonagall took the letter, studied the magics on it, and then quietly said a spell in Welsh that made the letter unfold and text spread across the page.  Her eyebrows climbed on her forehead as she read the letter, and when they reached the end of the missive they abruptly dropped into an angry visage.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Ignoring the strange girl on her couch, McGonagall strode to her fireplace and threw a pinch of Floo powder in.  “Moira!” she yelled as she stuck her head into the green flames. “Moira, get yourself in my quarters, NOW,” she commanded, before pulling herself back out of the flames.  </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>McGonagall cast a Patronus charm, and a silvery cat flowed out of the tip of her wand.  “Poppy, prepare a bed for an unexpected patient. And make sure you have an apple,” she told the cat, and it licked its paw before slinking away through the stone wall.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“So my feckless, reckless baby sister sent you tumbling through time,” she said to Hermione without preamble as she slumped into a wingback chair.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione nodded, and took another sip of her whiskey.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The Floo chimed, and the younger version of the witch Hermione had just been with stepped through the flames.  “What are you bellowing about now, Min?” the witch asked tiredly as she rubbed sleep from her eyes. “I just got off a night shift,” she whinged.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>McGonagall gave her an unimpressed look and handed the note over.  Stuart quickly read the note, and a wide grin spread across her face.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Holy fuckin shite, I’m a genius!” she crowed, and McGonagall threw back the rest of her whiskey as she rolled her eyes. Hermione snorted, and both of the older women turned to look at her.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“So why are you the one who came back?” Stuart asked as she and McGonagall both stared at Hermione’s tangled hair, tattered dress, and bloodstained feet.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m one of only three people who have a complete knowledge of how Voldemort was defeated,” Hermione said succinctly.  “And the other two are too recognizable, too similar to wizards and witches that are currently the same age as us in this time. And, you know, </span>
  <em>
    <span>boys</span>
  </em>
  <span>,” she added disdainfully.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>McGonagall huffed a quiet laugh, and Stuart grinned widely.  “You really are a Daughter,” she mused. “So, what do we need to do to stop You-Know-Who?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione opened her mouth to answer, but McGonagall cut her off.  “Moira, we cannae be meddling in time!” she yelled, her Scottish accent thickening as her anger grew.  “Ye know what happens - Eloise Mintumble, remember?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Aye, I remember just fine, Min,” Stuart yelled back.  </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I won’t be a part of this foolishness!” McGonagall exclaimed.  “All the studies show that-”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“-those who meddle with time are only the causation for events that already happened,” Hermione finished for McGonagall.  “You loaned me your personal Time Turner during my third year as a student, so I could attend all the classes I wanted to take.  I had ‘potential,’ or so you told the DoM when you went to them to sign off on it,” Hermione told the professor.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Both women gaped at her, and Hermione continued.  “But Professor, alterations have already been made to the timeline.  From what I was able to overhear as I walked to your quarters, Peter Pettigrew was expelled last night for endangering the life of another student,” she said, and McGonagall nodded that this was indeed correct.  </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“In my timeline,” Hermione said, taking a deep breath, “it was Sirius Black who tricked Severus Snape into following them to the Whomping Willow, not Peter.  Sirius was not expelled, nor was Peter, and Snape was sworn to secrecy about Remus Lupin’s condition. So changes have already been made, you see?” She mustered up the energy to give the other two women a daring grin.  “So why not make a few more?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>McGonagall narrowed her eyes at Hermione.  “How do we know that you are telling the truth?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione raised her eyes to Stuart’s.  “I know Unspeakable Stuart is an accomplished Legilimens,” she said.  “So check my memories,” she suggested, shrugging slightly.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Stuart raised her wand and pointed it at Hermione’s forehead.  Hermione stiffened, forcing herself not to automatically cloud her mind and raise her occlumentic shields.  Instead, she focused solely on her memory of Harry telling her what had happened between the Marauders, Snape, and Lily, as he had seen it in Snape’s memories.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>After a few minutes, Stuart lowered her wand.  “She’s telling the truth, Min,” Stuart said, a hint of gloating in her voice.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I shan’t do it, and that’s that. Hang the bloody Daughters,” McGonagall swore.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione stared at her favorite person, the woman who’d introduced her to this world of magic and wonder and terror.  At the woman who’d so bravely defended Harry from everyone, and who’d fought like a lioness to protect all of the students of Hogwarts in the final battle, not just those of her house.  She knew it would take a miracle, something drastic and horrifying, to make the professor change her mind.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“James Potter and Lily Evans are murdered by Voldemort himself after being betrayed by Peter Pettigrew, and Sirius Black is wrongfully imprisoned for over a dozen years for their deaths,” Hermione told McGonagall bluntly.  “James and Lily have a son, and he is sent to live with the absolute worst sort of Muggles, or so you said. Will say. Whichever,” Hermione said, wrinkling her nose at the mismatching verb tenses. “He is raised like a lamb for slaughter by Albus </span>
  <em>
    <span>fucking </span>
  </em>
  <span>Dumbledore, and he willingly lays down his life because that manipulative old bastard convinces him to,” Hermione spat venomously.  “Remus dies, along with his mate. Sirius dies. So very many people who shouldn’t have to </span>
  <em>
    <span>die</span>
  </em>
  <span>, and their sacrifices mean </span>
  <em>
    <span>nothing </span>
  </em>
  <span>because the Ministry is still obsessed with blood purity and ‘protecting’ magic, for the ‘greater good.’”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>(Harry had refused to read the biography Rita Skeeter had published about Dumbledore, but Hermione had been just curious enough to force herself to read the first chapter.  She ended up reading the entire three volume set in one night. Skeeter may be a conniving, manipulative bitch of the highest order, but there was no denying that she knew how to do her research, and how to find the truths buried the deepest underground.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>For the greater good, indeed.)</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>McGonagall dropped back into her chair, stunned.  “James Potter...and Lily Evans...have a son?” she asked, voice faint.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes,” Hermione said, smiling gently.  “He is...wonderful, and so brave, and kind, and stubborn, and Morgana, so bloody dramatic that sometimes I want to smack him,” she said, smiling softly as her eyes filled with tears.  “He Crucio’d someone for daring to spit on you, because he loves you so very much,” she said gently, and McGonagall’s eyes filled with tears as well. “And he’s a hell of a Seeker,” Hermione added, grinning.  “First first year to make the Gryffindor team in a hundred and fifty years, and handpicked by you to play.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>McGonagall took one deep, shuddery breath, and then straightened her spine and set her glass aside.  </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“So what do we need to do?” McGonagall asked resolutely.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Well, first…” Hermione said, smiling eagerly at her two past-future mentors, both so eager to help her once again. “I’m going to need a cover, something that even Dumbledore won’t question, that will let me live here and attend classes for a bit.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>McGonagall and Stuart exchanged clever, mischievous looks.  “Oh, I’m sure we can come up with something…” Stuart said, her grin a bit serpentine.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>McGonagall - no, </span>
  <em>
    <span>Auntie Min</span>
  </em>
  <span>, as Hermione must now remember to call her - escorted Hermione through one of the teacher shortcut passages to the Hospital Wing.  She dropped Hermione off into Madam Pomfrey’s capable hands, and the petite matron instantly bustled Hermione about, shoving potions into her hands as she stripped the young witch out of her torn and stained dress and pushed her into the shower stall in the back of the infirmary.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione dutifully swallowed the potions - a mid-grade strength healing potion and a blood-replenishing potion, judging by their familiar, awful tastes, and a slight de-aging potion to make her look sixteen, not nearly twenty.  </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She unstrapped her beaded bag and wand from her legs and left them within reach as she quickly showered off the dirt and grime from her run through the forest.  She could hear Minerva telling Madam Pomfrey the story they’d come up with, and by the time Hermione was rinsing conditioner out of her hair her new guardian had left the infirmary wing to go supervise the loading of students onto the train home.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Now clean and dry, Hermione ignored the pajamas Madam Pomfrey had left for her, and instead pulled some of Harry’s old pajama pants and one of his Weasley jumpers out of her beaded bag, still in there from their year on the run, and wore them.  She strapped her wand and her bag back to her legs, and braided her wet hair back.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She walked back out into the infirmary, where Madam Pomfrey waited for her.  The mediwitch held out a familiar purple potion, but Hermione shook her head.  “I cannot take Dreamless Sleep,” she said regretfully. “I’m about two dosages from the addiction threshold.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>A brief, shocked look crossed across the older woman’s face, but she quickly schooled it back into a more professional expression.  “Very well,” she chirped. “You’ll take a calming draught, then,” she said in a tone that brooked no arguments.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Do you have any post-lunar potions? That may work better than a calming draught.”  Madam Pomrey studied the younger girl, and Hermione felt her eyes flash gold and her fingernails lengthen and sharpen as her own wolfish nature reared its head.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Demiwolf, are you? Haven’t seen one of those in a while,” Madam Pomfrey commented idly as she got two shimmering blue potions out of her supply cabinet and passed one of them to Hermione.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Among other things, yes,” Hermione said tightly before tipping the potion back.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Well, you let me know if you need any pain potions or anything like that while you’re here,” the matron said kindly.  “Now, lay down and try to get some rest, dearie, while Minerva gets things sorted out. I imagine that the Headmaster will be knocking on our doors soon enough,” she said, lips pursing tightly.  Hermione stiffened, and Madam Pomfrey put a reassuring hand on the girl’s shoulder. “Now don’t you worry, dearie,” she said soothingly. “I don’t let anyone disturb my patients, not even that man,” she said, and there was a surprising note of steel on her voice.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione wasn’t a betting kind of girl, but she’d wager good money on Madam Pomfrey just then in a fight with Dumbledore.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>After all, to be an effective Healer, you must also understand how to harm.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Remus woke the morning after the full moon much as he usually did - sore as hell, bone tired, and ensconced in his usual bed in the hospital wing.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The only difference, this time, was that when he opened his eyes, a girl was sitting by his feet, leaning back against the footrail with her toes tucked under his calf.  She was a tiny thing, the striped pajama pants she was wearing trailing over her feet and the jumper, embroidered with an H, falling off of her shoulder. Her damp hair was pulled back in a tight braid, and her eyes were a warm whiskey brown as they stared at him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Hello, Remus,” she said quietly, a small smile quirking up the corner of her mouth.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“How...how do you know my name?” he stuttered nervously.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>A humorless chuckle escaped her mouth.  “Like calls to like,” she murmured.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You..you mean you’re...you’re a…?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“...a huge bookworm with terribly reckless friends who somehow ends up leading them in their misadventures?” she suggested wryly, arching an eyebrow at him as she burrowed her icy cold toes further underneath his thigh.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No? I mean, yes, but...no? Also, how are your feet that cold?” he grumbled, attempting to shift his legs away from her.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She leaned forward and situated herself in the empty space on his left side, laying on her side and facing him.  Slightly uncomfortable at her close proximity, he shifted away, and she rolled her eyes. “Relax,” she sighed. “I’m not going to ravish you or anything,” she said sarcastically.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Remus felt more relieved than disappointed.  He was a teenage boy, after all, but something about this girl set off his inner wolf, not his hormones. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She wiggled on the bed, making herself comfortable next to him.  Normally, he would be snapping his teeth and growling at anyone who would dare to be in his space, still territorial and bit wolfish this soon after a shift.  But instead, he found himself welcoming this strange girl, with her almost druggingly-sweet scent and too-tired eyes, into his space as if she’d been there the whole of his life.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The neckline of her sweater shifted some more as she moved, revealing the edge of a jagged scar across the back of her shoulder blade.  “Oh,” he said quietly, green eyes flashing gold. That could explain...</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh, indeed,” she echoed, her own eyes glowing golden as well.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You smell familiar,” he blurted out, and his cheeks instantly turned red as soon as the words left his mouth.  “I mean…”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The girl cut him off.  “I know what you mean,” she said, lips quirking again.  “We have...the same maker, you might say. Different results, but same starting point,” she said, tapping her shoulder blade before motioning to his side, where a very similar set of scars stretched across his ribcage.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“So you’re not…”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No,” she cut him off again.  “I’m something else entirely,” she said, a bleak note creeping into her voice.  “I still like my steaks rare, though,” she added after a moment, forcing a grin back onto her face.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“How else do you cook a steak?” Remus joked weakly.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>There was something about the girl that pulled at Remus, or rather, at </span>
  <em>
    <span>Moony</span>
  </em>
  <span>.  He wanted to wrap her up and keep her safe - from what, he had no clue, but it seemed almost imperative that he comfort her.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Trying to ignore the howling wolf in his head, he turned to grab his potions off the nightstand and quickly swallowed them, before carefully laying back down next to her.  She nudged him onto his side, and curled up to his back, wrapping an arm around his ribs as she tucked her cold toes in between his calves.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Merlin,” he hissed, jumping a little.  “I don’t even know your name,” he muttered.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He felt the girl huff out a laugh against his vertebrae.  “I’m Hermione,” she murmured. “And I think we somehow made a Pack last night,” she admitted, before falling asleep.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Remus stiffened under her grip.  Pack? With this strange girl? And not with James, Sirius and Peter? Inside his head, Moony made an agreeable yipping noise before settling down, easier and quicker than he ever had after a shift.</span>
</p>
