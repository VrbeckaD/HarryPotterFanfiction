    <p>Remus paused in the hallway his head tilted as his listened to the song. He'd expected it to be a Weird Sisters song knowing Tonks but this time around it wasn't. It was a muggle song…it had to be going by the lyrics.</p><p>But to hear her singing along with the radio was just so calming that Remus couldn't even find the will to scold himself for gaping at her from the hallway while she was naked in the shower behind the door.</p><p></p><div class="xcontrast">

      <p>"<em>Oh, and I don't know</em><br/>I don't know what he's after<br/>But he's so beautiful<br/>Such a beautiful disaster"</p>
      <p>Remus stiffened wondering who she could be singing about. "Lucky git." He growled at the unknown man that has her singing so sweetly as she bathes. He knew he should move on and let her shower in peace but he just couldn't force his feet to move as his siren continued with her song.</p>
      <p>
        <em>"He's magic and myth</em>
        <br/>
        <em>As strong as what I believe</em>
        <br/>
        <em>A tragedy with</em>
        <br/>
        <em>More damage than a soul should see"</em>
      </p>
      <p>He gulped at the words but pushed the idea away. She couldn't possibly mean him. Sure, to the muggle world lycanthropy was a myth but in his and Tonks's world in was so very real. And as for the damaged soul, his wasn't just damaged it was ripped to pieces from both his condition and all the losses he's had in both wars. <em>'But so, has the rest of magical world'</em> he reminded himself so he shouldn't think she was just singing about him and finish cleaning the rest of the house like Molly had asked him to….</p>
      <p>"<em>I'm longing for love and the logical<br/>But he's only happy hysterical"<br/>I'm waiting for some kind of miracle<br/>Waited so long"</em></p>
      <p>Remus smiled despite himself picturing her using the shampoo bottle as a microphone but he jumped when she suddenly let out a heart-stopping shriek that had him contemplating breaking down the door just to be sure she was alright.</p>
      <p>"Merlin's teeth that's cold." He heard her shout over the sound of his racing heart and the adrenaline racing through his system. Lupin paled when he heard the shower curtain being pulled back and the water being turned off. "That muggle singer did get one thing right…" she mused to herself unaware of the ex-teacher listening in just outside the door. "Remus really is both Magic and Myth." He heard her murmur "…my beautiful and stubborn wolfish disaster." She sighed wistfully before he heard her muttering spells to dry her hair as the door handle started to turn.</p>
      <p>Tonks stopped blinking in confusion at the breathy squeak of shock and the sounds of panicked scrambling as she opened the door. She stuck her head out into the hall looking around but shrugged when she didn't see anyone and chucked it up to just another weird thing about the Black family house and headed out of the bathroom to her room while Remus was busy caching his breath in the room opposite her watching her as she walked away from him.</p>
