    <p>A morning mist hung low over the suburban neighborhood and the bright sun that peaked over the horizon promised a sunny start to summer, but the girl inside the top floor of the smallest house didn’t have a single thought of summer on her mind. At that moment, she was sifting through the bottom drawer of her chestnut dresser. Mostly, the garments she pulled out were placed in a pile on the side of the dresser, but every so often, she carefully folded one and set it into a cardboard box labeled “Apartment,” which was half full beside her. </p><p>	“James, can you hurry up with the donation box?” the girl called without looking behind her. </p><p>	“I put it behind you two minutes ago!” James laughed, turning from his spot near the girl’s bed and kicking the box towards the girl with red hair. </p><p>	“Oh,” the girl frowned. “Sorry, I didn’t see it there.”</p><p>	"Come on, Lily. Cheer up! This should be a happy time…tonight we’re moving into our first place together!” James ran a hand through his messy black hair and placed his hands onto Lily’s small shoulders. </p><p>	Under his hands, her shoulders relaxed a bit and she looked up at him towering above her. “I know. I’m sorry. It’s just, I love this house. It’s hard knowing that I’ll never be back.”</p><p>	James looked into her bright green eyes and smiled. “I understand. But it’s normal for your parents to want to downsize. Your sister has moved in with her fiancé and with our new role in the Order, it’s safer for you not to be at home, anyway. This house is too big for the two of them.”</p><p>	Lily’s parents had moved the previous week before Lily had traveled home from her seventh and final year at Hogwarts. Their new house was only ten miles north of this one, and the picture they had sent Lily from their first night showed bright smiles lighting up each of their faces, but Lily wasn’t having as easy a time leaving.</p><p>	“I know,” Lily looked back into the drawer and decided on the last garment. “I am excited to move in with you, but, you know, this is home. It’s my safe place and we’re going out into a world that is anything but safe.”</p><p>	“That’s why we joined the Order,” James reassured her. “We’re going to make it safe again.”</p><p>	“I hope so,” Lily said.</p><p>	“Remember we start as soon as it’s dark tonight! Our first real mission!” James’s eyes gleamed with excitement.</p><p>	“We’re just going with Moody to put some protective charms over a muggle village. It’s not much of a mission, James,” Lily laughed. “Thought I’m not complaining. We’re making the world safer just by doing that.”</p><p>	James didn’t deflate at all from Lily’s comment, but instead he turned back to the bed and dropped to his knees to peer under the bed frame. Lily flipped the flaps of the cardboard box shut and sealed it with her wand. She looked around the room. There was still a bit left in the room, but most of it was going to be donated. After living at Hogwarts for the last seven years, Lily had most of her significant belongings packed in her school trunk. She was only pulling out a few things to take with her.</p><p>	James had argued that Lily should just vanish everything and save time, but she couldn’t just send all her stuff into nonbeing. She would feel much better knowing that somewhere, some other person was able to get use out of her old things.</p><p>	She got back to work, this time focusing on her closet while James continued to clear out under her bed. She was just about done with sorting everything between donation and keep when James’s voice interrupted the silence.</p><p>	“What’s this, Lils?” </p><p>	She turned and saw James turning a rectangular object over in his hands. Lily moved a bit closer and recognized the brownish-black ribbon that ran through the plastic of the prism. </p><p>	“That’s a cassette tape,” she explained. “Remember, I told you about them this year. It’s a way to record your voice or listen to music.”</p><p>	James still looked confused, so Lily gently took the tape from his hands and reached into the box by his feet. She pulled out a much larger rectangular box and slipped the tape inside the slot. “I’m not sure what’s on this one. There isn’t a label. But if there is something, we’ll be able to hear it by pressing this button.”</p><p>	She pushed her finger onto the play button. There was a small amount of static feedback before a small voice she had never heard before crackled from the speakers.</p><p>“Go to the place where people come and go,<br/>Day in and day out.<br/>The wheels turn and slow,<br/>Even with Royalty about.”</p><p>	James and Lily stared at the cassette player for a few seconds before Lily pressed the rewind button to bring the tape back to the beginning.</p><p>	“That’s weird. I knew I had a few music tapes, but I don’t have any idea where this one would have come from. I’ve never even heard that voice before.”</p><p>	She pressed the play button again and listened to the short message one more time. Next to her, James’s eyes light up.</p><p>	“It’s a scavenger hunt!” he exclaimed. “Let’s do it! What do you think it could mean?”</p><p>	Lily looked at the cassette hesitantly. “I don’t know. It could be a trap. I don’t ever remember this tape being here and it makes no sense as to why it’s here now.”</p><p>	“Maybe your dad made it or Petunia or someone,” James went on. “How could it be a trap? What kind of Death Eater would use muggle tools to lure two just-graduated Hogwarts students to…where do you think it means?”</p><p>	Lily considered for a moment. On one hand, she agreed with James that it didn’t seem to coincide with Death Eaters, however the presence of the tape didn’t settle well in her mind. Her father, though his love for her had been admirable, had never been creative enough to come up with something like a scavenger hunt. And Petunia? The thought was laughable. First, Petunia would never make a scavenger hunt. Second, Petunia would never leave a scavenger hunt for her sister, whom she held an extreme hatred for.</p><p>	“Uhm, I’m not sure. Seems like a train station to me,” Lily said, pulling her eyes from the cassette tape to glance at James. His deep brown eyes were staring at her, his face impassive. </p><p>	“Okay, well, maybe that was a dumb idea,” Lily shrugged. “It just made sense to me.”</p><p>	“No!” James snapped from his thoughts. “I think you’re absolutely right. But there’s so many train stations. We’d be searching for weeks if we went to every single one.”</p><p>	Lily paused and played the short message again. This time, she listened carefully for any clue. </p><p>	“It says royalty,” Lily pointed out. “There’s only one train station I can think of that would have to do with royalty and that’s King’s Cross.”</p><p>	James nodded excitedly. “Let’s go!”</p><p>	“James, we still have to finish up here. Mum and Dad said the new couple is scheduled to start moving in tomorrow. Not to mention all of the unpacking we have to do at our place and the job we have for the Order tonight!”</p><p>	James looked around. The walls were bare. The few boxes labeled “Apartment” were stacked by the door and boxes labeled “Donation” laid by the adjacent wall. </p><p>	“We’ll just magic the boxes to the apartment and take care of them later, and it’s not like we’re far from King’s Cross. We could take a look around and then go straight to our job. Besides, it’s a beautiful day outside. We could walk to the train station and enjoy ourselves.”</p><p>	Lily sighed. She had really wanted to get everything done today. Now she would have to continue unpacking tomorrow because the excited look on James’s face was the only thing that could take her away from her planned day.</p><p>	“Fine. Let me just sort these last few things out and we can go. Why don’t you start sending the boxes?”</p><p>	James finished sending the boxes much quicker than Lily finished sorting through the last of her things. He had settled himself by the window and was pretending to take a good look at the neighborhood, however Lily could tell by the antsy way his legs rocked back and forth that he was itching to figure out the cassette mystery.</p><p>	“Alright, I think I’m ready,” Lily said, taking one last look around the room that she had lived in the last seventeen years. James pointed his wand at the final boxes and they disappeared. </p><p>	“Awesome, let’s go,” James stretched his hand towards Lily. She looked at him for a moment, taking in his eagerness to move forward. Even though she felt like she was leaving a large part of her world behind, she grasped James’s calloused hands and together they disapparated into oblivion.</p><p> </p><p>------</p><p> </p><p>	They appeared suddenly in a shadowed back alley, and the large amount of noise that filtered into Lily’s ears told her that they were in the heart of London. People walking and talking with their friends, out shopping on this sunny day. Bicycles zoomed on the sidewalks and the traffic bustled through the streets. </p><p>	James pulled on Lily’s hand, which was still clasped tightly with his and led them towards the crowds. As soon as they hit the sidewalk, Lily recognized the tall clock tower above King’s Cross station reaching up towards the sky directly in front of them. They walked slowly, taking in the scenes around them. Their new apartment wasn’t too far away. They could catch the Knight Bus and be there within five minutes. They could even walk if they really wanted to. Lily was excited to be living in the city, especially close to Diagon Alley. James had agreed to move into a muggle apartment building if they were close to Diagon Alley. Lily had happily agreed – it was the best of both worlds.</p><p>	“James, this place is huge. I really doubt that there’s another tape around here,” Lily voiced her concern and looked around the vast corridor, staring in every direction as trains came and went. Just as one train pulled away, she noticed a cart behind it had hundreds of bright pieces of jewelry. She began to pull James towards it. </p><p>	“Let’s look at the jewelry,” she smiled and walked up to the stand. She browsed the hangers for a few moments before she noticed a thin chain with a small white-petaled flower dangling from it. </p><p>	She reached for the flower and gently held the necklace in her hand, debating whether she should buy the piece of jewelry. James, who had been pretending to browse on the other side of the cart walked up next to her and looked at the necklace. </p><p>	“That would be very pretty on you,” he said and reached for the back pocket of his muggle jeans. “Do you want it?”</p><p>	Lily smiled but shook her head. “It’s okay. We don’t have any muggle money anyway and I prefer not to confund the shopkeeper.”</p><p>	James grinned and pulled a note from his wallet. “Moody warned me that it would be wise to keep muggle money for emergencies. This seems like an emergency to me.” </p><p>	He pulled the necklace from its hanging place and winked at Lily, who smiled brightly. He took the necklace to the other side of the cart to pay the shopkeeper. Lily followed and saw that the man in charge looked middle age, and had short, speckled black hair. He smiled brightly at the couple and Lily felt like she knew him from somewhere.</p><p>	When the middle-aged man caught sight of Lily, his eyes widened, and a bright smile spread across his face, revealing cracked, yellow teeth.</p><p>	“Lily Evans!” he exclaimed. “I’ve been waiting for you!”</p><p>	“I’m sorry. Do I know you?” Lily questioned hesitantly. </p><p>	“I’m afraid not, but I would recognize you from anywhere! I was told to give you this if you ever showed up here.” The man reached underneath his cart and pulled out another cassette tape. Lily reached and took it out of his hand.</p><p>	“Thank you,” Lily said. “May I ask who gave this to you?”</p><p>	“No, you may not,” the man laughed. “That would ruin the game.”</p><p>	“So, it’s a game, is it?” Lily questioned, turning the new cassette tape around in her hands. The tape had no label, just like the one they had listened to earlier. She wished she had brought her cassette player with her, so she could listen to it right now.  </p><p>	The old man looked at her with a twinkle in his silver eye and gave a sly grin. “You will see…” he said mysteriously.</p><p>	“Well, thank you,” Lily said again, pocketing the cassette tape. “And thank you,” she said while turning to James. He had the necklace out and ready to clasp around her neck.</p><p>	“Anything for you,” James said sweetly while putting the necklace on her. He leaned in and gave her a swift, yet graceful, kiss on the cheek. “How about we stop at the Leaky Cauldron to grab some food before we meet Moody?”</p><p>	“Sure,” Lily answered, looking down at the beautiful white flower now hung around her neck. She took James’s hand once again and they began their trek across the city to the Leaky Cauldron.</p><p> </p><p>--------</p><p> </p><p>	By the time they had finished eating and chatting with the new bartender, Tom, dusk had taken over the sky. Lily looked at James, who was happily pushing his empty plate away from him, with a slight flutter in her stomach. No matter how safe Moody deemed this first task for the Order, she was still nervous about it. If there was one thing she learned in the past year, it was to expect the unexpected. Constant vigilance, as their new mentor would say. </p><p>	James didn’t seem nearly as worried. In fact, he was downright chipper as they meandered to the back alley that was designated for disapparating. Joining the Order was just about the only thing he talked about ever since Dumbledore had pulled them and a few others into his office at the end of May. She knew that he was excited about the chase and the action. James shined bright in the face of danger and a good threat heightened his skills. James was a Gryffindor through and through. He would never back down from a fight.</p><p>	Lily, on the other hand, was smart, capable, and frequently the voice of reason within their group. It wasn’t that she didn’t believe in what the Order stood for…no, that cause was the specific reason she joined up. Simply put, she was scared. She knew of the dangers and the death that ensued from fighting the Death Eaters. But as sure as she knew that people in the Order would die fighting You-Know-Who, she also knew that she, as a muggleborn, was likely to die either way. In a choice between hiding or standing up and fighting, Lily chose the latter. That was what made her the true Gryffindor that she had become. </p><p>	“We’re going to be a few minutes early,” James breathed, looking down at this watch. </p><p>	“Better to be early than late,” Lily reminded. “I’m sure Moody wouldn’t appreciate us being late.”</p><p>	“Well then, I’m ready if you are,” James agreed, and for the final time that night, he took Lily’s hand in his and they disapparated into nothingness together.</p><p>	The summer breeze hit Lily’s face as soon as the squeezing sensation passed. She took a deep breath to settle herself and opened her eyes to take a good look around her.</p><p>	That was when she saw it for the first time.</p><p>	Hovering twenty fit above the house at the end of the street, the one that they could walk straight ahead to, was a green monster. Around the demon figure was a haze of green, that lit up the roof of the house.</p><p>	Although Lily had never personally witnessed the Dark Mark before, she knew what it was from the various descriptions she had heard from classmates, teachers, mentors, and the Daily Prophet. Without pausing, without thinking, her feet began to move towards the house, moving quicker with each step. James was right beside her, pulling out his wand and holding it high in the middle of this muggle neighborhood. Lily followed suit.</p><p>	It took about two minutes to reach the house, and although Lily was out of breath, she didn’t pause at the walkway. She ran right up to the door and reached for the knob. Before she could open it, however, James grabbed her hand.</p><p>	“Stop,” he said. “They could still be in there.”</p><p>	“That’s the point,” Lily hissed, going to turn the knob again. “We need to try to help them.”</p><p>	“No,” James held her hand still, applying a force he didn’t usually do with her. “The Death Eaters could still be inside. We need to be cautious.”</p><p>	Lily understood. She raised her wand and muttered, “Homenum Revelio.” </p><p>	Nothing happened. She had never had to perform that charm in real life before, but the idea was that her wand would vibrate if there were any living people inside. The fact that nothing happened didn’t calm her nerves.</p><p>	“Nothing,” she said and shook James’s hand from on top of hers. “Let’s go.” She swung open the red wooden door and stepped onto the welcome mat. To the side of the door were various pairs of shoes. Ranging from men’s work boots to children’s sneakers. A small pink bow was laying abandoned on the floor, and Lily could imagine a toddler pulling the bow out of her hair in frustration and the mother being too tired to pick it up. </p><p>	With both their wands raised in defense, Lily and James went around the first floor, checking the living room and the kitchen. There was no one. It didn’t even look like there had been a struggle. Dishes were sitting on the drying rack, and the tabletop was scrubbed clean. Nothing was out of place.</p><p>	“Let’s go upstairs,” James whispered and nodded his head towards the stairs. </p><p>	Lily tiptoed, though she knew it didn’t matter. Her spell had told her that nobody alive was in the building. At the tip of the stairs, James turned right to explore the rooms over there and Lily began to explore left. At first, there was a small, yellow-painted bathroom with two children’s toothbrushes sitting on the sink, leaving a puddle on the countertop. That was the first sign that people had been living in this house tonight. Lily held on to her wand a little tighter.</p><p>	Lily left the bathroom, and continued to the next room, where the door was wide open. As soon as she stepped into the room, her feet stopped. She took a deep breath and held out a lit wand in front of her to illuminate the whole room. There were two children size beds in this room, but they weren’t empty. Huddle in one were two adults, whose eyes were glazed open in shock. Their mouths gaped open, as if their last memory of a wand bursting green light towards them was the most shocking thing they had ever seen, which, Lily thought, it probably was. Their arms were splayed out, creating a fence, attempting to protect the two children behind them, one a boy and one a girl, huddled in an egg shape behind their parents. The way they were huddled prevented Lily from seeing their eyes. </p><p>	She didn’t know what to do. This wasn’t what their task was supposed to be. They were supposed to be casting protection charms over this neighborhood to prevent this from happening. But they had been too late. </p><p>	“Lily?” she heard James whisper from the hall. “Are you okay? I haven’t found anything yet.”</p><p>	Lily knew that she should respond, but words were hard to come by. With gigantic effort, she moved her feet backwards and left the lifeless family behind. Just as she was at the edge of the doorway, she bumped against who she knew to be James, but it didn’t make a difference because she just about jumped out of her socks anyway. James grabbed her around the waist and pulled her back so that the dreadful view of the deceased family couldn’t be seen. </p><p>	James left Lily where she was standing and went in to see for himself. He came back out less than a minute later, his face a bit paler and his eyes fixed on Lily. </p><p>	“We need to contact Moody,” James said.</p><p>	“No need, I’m already here,” a rough voice came from the shadows, making Lily jump again. She breathed a sigh of relief when she saw their gnarled mentor walking towards them from the staircase. He walked right past them and into the room with the family. He took a bit longer than James had. He came back out a few minutes later, looking from James to Lily with a mysterious look on his face. </p><p>	“You two acted like bloody fools,” he growled. “Never again will you run into a house with a Dark Mark above it without backup…”</p><p>	“Lily cast the human presence charm,” James defended themselves. Lily didn’t speak. She wasn’t as used to being scolded as James was.</p><p>	“Good thought, but amateur move,” Moody responded. “There could have been Death Eaters outside the house, which your revealing charm wouldn’t have noticed. It could have been a trap. You both could have ended up the same way that family has.”</p><p>	James didn’t say anything. Lily looked up at Moody. “What’s going to happen with them?”</p><p>	“Nothing. We leave them as they are, and we leave without being seen,” Moody explained. “The muggle law enforcement will eventually come to investigate. They won’t find anything, and they won’t have a clue how it happened, but it’s better that their family knows their outcome rather than assume they’ve gone missing.”</p><p>	Lily nodded, understanding the situation, even though every fiber in her being wanted to be the one to properly clean up the family. </p><p>	“What do we do now?” she asked. </p><p>	“We go back out and protect the other houses. It may have been too late for these folks, but it doesn’t have to be for the others,” Moody said.</p><p>	Although Lily was tired and all she wanted to do was go to bed, she held her wand and left the muggle house, determined to help the others in whichever way she could.</p>
