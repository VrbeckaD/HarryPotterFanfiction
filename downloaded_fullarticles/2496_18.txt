<p>***</p>
<p>After the war, there is first the ignominy of only the second time in his life he must appear before the Wizengamot, crawling on his belly, begging for pardon. Severus had thought he would hate it, as he had that first time. But he finds that in some fundamental way he is not that same young, spitting scarecrow who needed Albus’ protection all those years ago – that in fact he is mostly just very tired and wants to disappear. The scars on his neck are still tight and shiny and white, and he wears his collar very high and stiff. He longs to be anywhere but in the bowels of this godforsaken warren of old rooms, surrounded by those who always looked down their noses at him anyway and who feel no differently now that he is groveling before them yet again.</p>
<p>The only time he can conjure anything that feels like the old vitriol is on the very few occasions Potter turns up to plead his case. These times Severus cannot stand, can barely look at him, sitting up in the witness seat, seeming much more grown up than Severus had remembered but with his bastard father’s same ridiculous hair and those calm, green eyes which refuse to stop looking at him, probing for something, Severus does not know what. He is pathetically grateful that with the way things stand he never leaves his place when Potter is there, that Potter enters and exits for his grandstanding moments whilst Severus remains seated in the docket, trying not to hunch in on himself too much as Potter shares his version of events. Dumbledore would be pleased, which just makes Severus angrier. Even in this, Albus has fooled everyone. The boy has to come here, after all that the old wizard put him through, and say that what Severus did was for the higher good – when Severus by all rights should be dead and so should Potter.</p>
<p>When they do finally let him go, it is mercifully without much fanfare. Once the judgement has come down – “Severus Snape found innocent of all charges; petition for proceedings further to a possible Ministerial commendation denied” (as much as Potter had insisted, no Order of Merlin would be forthcoming, thank Heavens) – the Auror on duty leads him out, removes his Impervius shackles, and Severus is free to go. They direct him to the pigeonhole where his effects were stowed after his recovery stint in St Mungo’s, and with his blood-encrusted robes, so stained that the cloth is literally flaking away, he is surprised to find a familiar silver phial, one of Albus’. For a brief moment, in a way that Severus has begun to find unnervingly increasingly common in the weeks since he woke up in the Hogwarts infirmary under Poppy’s tearful gaze, Minerva just over her shoulder, he suffers a break with reality and thinks that the old wizard has sent him a gift from beyond the grave. Then he recovers himself enough to unroll the parchment tied with a bit of limp string to the neck of the Pensieve flask—</p>
<p></p><blockquote>
  <p><b><i>Snape</i></b>, it reads, in a scrawl Severus would recognise anywhere, even if he were half-blind with old age (from dozens of poorly written Potions essays), <b><i>these are your memories. You should have them back. We won because of you.</i></b><br/>
</p>
</blockquote><p>And then the signature below, the H bigger than the rest of the first name combined, and the surname barely legible. Severus ignores the feeling that the missive was meant to say more had only the writer been more sure of his reception. That's as it should be.</p>
<p>He sweeps from the corridors of the Ministry, as much as it is possible to anyway, in borrowed robes that are too long for him and still feeling the aftereffects of Nagini’s venom. Two unlucky reporters try to accost him on his way through the Atrium, but the look on Severus’ face is enough to quell them. Thank Merlin, as Severus uncharacteristically doesn’t feel up to much else.</p>
<p>He Apparates directly to Spinner’s End, and for his pride and trouble has to sit on the doorstep with his head in his palm for a good few minutes before the bout of post-snakebite nausea passes. It is warm in Cokeworth, warmer than Severus had anticipated, already late June, almost two months since he lay sprawled on the floor of the Shrieking Shack, bleeding out and poisoned. By Severus’ count, he lay there almost half a day before some of the mop-up crew, older students and Order members, found him. He should not be alive. With an effort, he gets up off the doorstep and unlocks the physical and magical locks on his front door. He makes tea and falls asleep before the sun has set.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>In the summer weeks that follow, Severus is surprised to find that what he is most <i>surprised</i> about is that now, finally, there is time. Time for so many things that Severus had never, ever planned on getting round to. Things he thought the War would put paid to and that he would therefore have no time to miss, being dead. Time for the silly and the banal: time to consolidate his books here at Spinner’s End with those from his rooms at Hogwarts (as he will not be going back; Minerva wrote him a letter, somehow both proud and contrite in a way only she would do, to the effect that his old teaching position was of course saved for him should he so choose to return, to which he had the satisfaction of sharpening his quill to write back, <i>Slughorn can keep it, and on his head be it.</i>); time to clear out the detritus of years of neglect; time to weed the garden and plant the first of a crop of Potions ingredients, herbs and what Muggles would consider certain wild weeds and magical plants. Time for the long and reflective: to read magical theory and smoke too many rolled cigarettes and remember things he’d rather forget.</p>
<p>One hot day toward the end of July, when he has been immersed in these things for approaching a month, the crack of Apparition disturbs him cleaning out two of his bigger pewter cauldrons, after an all-night brew session that has left circles under his eyes, blackest coffee on his breathe, and an ache in his neck — in other words, as close to delightful as Severus has approached in <i>literal years</i>. He opens the front door to Potter on the doorstep, looking tanned and more mangy than ever.</p>
<p>“Profess- Snape. I wanted to see you.” Potter’s nerves can’t hide behind the reflection in his glasses, but the quirk of his mouth is genuine.</p>
<p>Severus does not know what to say. The feeling is not mutual. This must show on his face. He does not try to hide it.</p>
<p>“I- Can I come in?”</p>
<p>Severus does not move from the doorway. For a moment, Potter shuffles from one foot to the other. Then he seems to make a decision and barges past into the hall. Severus feels his hackles rise. “Potter-”</p>
<p>“Look-” Potter interrupts, putting up his hands in a flurry of movement, palms out toward Severus, turning first half away from him toward the entrance to the kitchen before turning his head half back to look at Severus out of the corner of his eye — afraid, it would seem, to look at him directly. “Look, I needed to see you.”</p>
<p>“Potter,” Severus growls warningly. “You don’t need to see me. You don’t <i>need</i> anything.”</p>
<p>At that Potter’s green eyes flash up into Severus’ face, and Severus feels the last of his tether start to fray. “Potter, will you kindly get out of my house,” he hisses, still holding the front door open. </p>
<p>Potter looks anxiously at the open door. “Prof-”</p>
<p>“Not Professor, not sir, not anything to you anymore.” Potter looks almost disappointed. <i>For god’s sake.</i> “Potter, <i>get</i> out.”</p>
<p>“There’s so much I want to ask you— about what you did for our side, about what really happened, about-”</p>
<p>Snape holds up his hand, lips pressed into a thin line. “Potter, I owe you nothing. My debts are paid.” With the hand not holding the door open, Severus reaches for Potter’s upper arm, intending to fetch him out onto the doorstep. Potter dodges and falls back into the kitchen. Severus stalks forward after him. </p>
<p>“I know,” Potter says, looking around Severus’ spare kitchen, the scratched wooden work surfaces and leaky tap, the smoke-stained curling wall-paper. Severus bares his teeth. “I know, you don’t owe me anything. I owe you.” Potter swallows. Severus fights the bizarre impulse to shudder. "I'm sorry it took so long for anyone to find you."</p>
<p>"To find me-"</p>
<p>"To find you in the Shrieking Shack. I didn't think of it at first, and you could've been dead by the time they found you. So much was happening, and I can't believe I forgot to send anyone back for you right away. I hadn't slept much," Potter cards a hand through his hair, making it only stand further on end, "and by the time I told anyone it was the next morning."</p>
<p>This is news to Severus. He had not known it was under Potter's orders that he'd been found - perhaps even found at all. It's almost enough to make him feel some sort of gratitude is in order. There is also the fact that he knows some of what transpired in the period when Potter says 'so much was happening,' including a showdown between the Dark Lord and Potter himself.</p>
<p>Hoping to say something that will suffice and get Potter to leave, he quirks one eyebrow. "I imagine you had a lot on your mind."</p>
<p>To his immense discomfiture, Potter looks down at this and a red blush travels up to his ears. Good <i>god</i>.</p>
<p>"Potter-"</p>
<p>“You could tell me about my— about my mum.” Potter bites his lip.</p>
<p>Severus’ brain freezes. His hands close at his sides, and he can feel his knuckles turning white. His fingers are cold from washing out the cauldrons, which he can see still sitting in the basin of the sink where he left them because of this— interruption. </p>
<p>He looks at Potter, who is looking back at him, chin up, uncowed, standing in the middle of Severus’ mother’s old kitchen, his fingernails bitten to the quick, worrying his lip, but defiant, asking about his mother. Severus is suddenly, unexpectedly livid, his heart racing in his chest. “Potter,” he breathes, low and threatening, his eyes narrowed. He realises he has left his wand on the table in the cellar with his Potions equipment. Unforgivable. He can feel his pulse thundering in his ears. Potter is looking at him. Severus cannot read his expression -- Pain? Regret? Recognition?</p>
<p>“I’ll- I’ll go,” Potter says, unexpectedly, putting up his hands again. He looks at Severus. “I'm sorry I barged in. I’ll- I’ll see you around, sir,” and before Severus can register what is happening, Potter is nodding and has backed into the hall. And then he is gone, presumably out the front door.</p>
<p>Severus hears the snap of his Apparition. He is left standing alone in his kitchen, wand hand clutched in a vice, his jaw aching from the grimace on his face. Finally, he collapses into a chair, his left hand idly going up to massage the shiny tissue below his now racing pulse point. </p>
<p><i>Godammit.</i> </p>
<p>***</p>
<p>That is of course not destined to be Potter’s last attempt.</p>
