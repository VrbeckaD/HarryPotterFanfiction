Problem fixed.”</p><p>Molly leapt from her seat and greeted her second eldest with a fierce hug. “Charlie! You're home!”</p><p>“Hullo, mum,” Charlie replied, returning her hug as he waited for his words to register in his mum's brain. He held up a hand to Hermione behind his mum's back and counted down from five. As he reached one, Molly's shriek nearly pierced his eardrum.</p><p>”FIANCÉE!!” Letting go of her son, she turned to face Hermione. Hands on hips, she asked, “What does he mean fiancée?”</p><p>Holding out her left hand, Hermione whispered, “Surprise?”</p><p>Molly looked down to see a delicate ring glinting from Hermione's ring finger. Her eyes widened as she looked back and forth between Charlie and Hermione. “Why didn't you tell me you were seeing each other?”</p><p>“We wanted to tell you all in person,” Hermione explained as she moved to stand next to Charlie. “This wasn't how we planned to tell everyone, but it is what it is.”</p><p>Wrapping an arm around her waist, Charlie added, “We only got engaged a few days ago, so we wanted to wait and tell everyone once we were all here."</p><p>“Do your mum and dad know?”</p><p>Hermione nodded. “Yes. We spent a few days with my parents before they left for their holiday to Moscow, so that's where we came from. Well, I came from my dad and mum's place. Charlie had to go have to the reserve to sign off on something which is why we didn't arrive together.”</p><p>Molly looked back and forth between the smiling couple. “You're serious?”</p><p>“Yes, mum,” Charlie chuckled.</p><p>“You're engaged? To each other?”</p><p>Hermione nodded.</p><p>The Weasley matriarch's face morphed into a massive grin as she pulled first Charlie and then Hermione into bone-crushing hugs.</p><p>“Oh, I'm so happy for you both!” She pulled back and levelled them with her patented look. “Now, you two may room together as I really have nowhere else for Charlie to go, but I want nothing happening between you two under my roof. Is that clear?”</p><p>“Yes, Mrs Weasley,” Hermione replied.</p><p>“Yes, mum,” Charlie added.</p><p>“Good. Now that the sleeping arrangement is settled, I need to go start dinner for tonight.” Molly turned to make her way towards the kitchen. “You'll be sharing your old room, Charlie.”</p><p>“Thanks,” he called out as Molly disappeared through the doorway.</p><p>Once they were alone, Charlie leaned down whispered, “Think we can get away with some alone time right now?”</p><p>“No on your life,” Hermione snickered. She looked up at him with a glint in her eyes. “Maybe after everyone goes to bed.”</p><p>Charlie’s laugh rang throughout the home before he turned and wrapped Hermione in his arms. “You cheeky which. Let's make sure not to forget the silencing and locking charms, eh?”</p><p>She winked up at him. “Definitely not.”</p></div>
