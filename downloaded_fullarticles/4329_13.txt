          <div class="userstuff"><p>"You're not going to believe this!"</p><p>"What-? Gin, Mum wanted this stuff packed and miniaturised an hour ago."</p><p>"Shut up and come in."</p><p>"What's- oh my dear Merlin!"</p><p>"Are those your parents' wedding rings?"</p><p>"Why would those be hidden under Percy's old stuff, Harry?"</p><p>"You mean Percy and Penelope-"</p><p>"No. Look at the engravings."</p><p>"'Percival' and 'Bartemius'? But... they're guys? They can't... can they?"</p><p>"Sure they can. Why, you mean Muggles can't?"</p><p>"No. My uncle would have a stroke."</p><p>"That's not the point, Harry! My brother... and his boss?"</p><p>"Well, Fred and George said-"</p><p>"I thought they were kidding."</p><p>"Perhaps Crouch was embarrassed, with Percy so young and his assistant? Maybe that's why he pretended not to remember his name?"</p><p>"Either that or 'Weatherby' was Crouch's nickname for Perce's little Perce. Ouch! Gin!"</p><p>"You deserved that."</p><p>"You mean he behaved like such an utter prick because he'd just lost his fiance?"</p><p>"People can behave strange when they're in pain, Harry... sorry."</p><p>"It's ok, Ginny."</p><p>"I'd say we put that box right back and never think of it again. Urgh! Crouch! I'd think better of Perce's taste if he'd picked Lucius Malfoy."</p><p>"Don't be disgusting, Ron!"</p><p>"And no more comments about Percy's little Weatherby, ever. Ouch!"</p><p>"Shut up, Harry. You deserved that too."</p><center>
