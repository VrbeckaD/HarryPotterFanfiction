    <p>"What gives you the idea that Hogsmeade is allowed for students after this time, Ms-?" a silky voice said, sending shivers down Sigyn's spine.</p>
<p>She was terrified. And at the same time excited after having a chance to meet her husbandâ€¦. She was the only one who believed that he wasn't guilty. And her uncle and cousin though, she was wrong and innocent to think so. She turned around, her eyes brimming with tears.</p>
<p>"S-Severus?" she stuttered, her eyes wide in the shock. He cast Lumos and was shocked as well. His wife. One of the parts of heaven in his life after the death of Lily. His Sigyn.</p>
<p>"Sigyn?" he asked, his cold voice turning into the soft one. She nodded. But what was she doing here? In these days nowhere was safe. Not for her. He had told the dark lord that he married her just to torture her. Which wasn't true. Obviously. But if the Dark Lord found out this accidental meeting of the couple, what was supposed to happen? Sigyn would be killed. His position would be in the danger. The war wouldn't be like what he and Dumbledore want it to happen. Maybe the boy who lived, that famous Potter would be in lots of trouble and maybe he'd lose because he never had an idea what he was doing. And in the time of war, that would cost thousands of lives. Not that he cared about thousands. He only cared that Lily's son was safe. And he cared that Sigyn was safe and that she should have knowledge of the truth.</p>
<p>"Sigyn, you are to hold my hand, we are apparating to the safe place where our talk won't be heard." He whispered sternly.</p>
<p>Sigyn gave offered a wide smile, holding his hand, they did side-apparition.</p>
<p>"So, is it now safe to talk?" she said an apparition few seconds after they started walking from the point.</p>
<p>"No," he replied sternly.</p>
<p>She smiled at his sudden bluntness. It gave her assurance that everything was going to be fine. Fine was a really strong word though. It was never the word that could have defined her previous living situation and relationship with Severus Snape. But interesting and craving were perfect ones. They walked until Severus spun her around by her wrist.<br/>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>A/N: I don't own anything that belongs to JK Rowling but I do own Sigyn and the concept. I thank FelixFelicisWriter for her support and she is the best beta ever! Enjoy</p>
<p>He sobbed. He sobbed with his head buried in her red hair. Her body was cold, white as chalk. Her eyes were wide but emotionless. He closed her eyelids. He couldn't bare them open. Yes, he was sad when he got the news when she got married and had a child. He wanted her to be his. But here she was, in flesh and bones but her soul gone. His life was now meaningless. He felt useless. He couldn't protect her. From the dark lord. From his fellow death eaters. From the prophecy that he revealed to the Dark Lord. He had told the headmaster that they'd attack. He lost his trust. But right now, Severus was far away from feeling betrayal. He wasn't able to feel anything but immense loss, pain, regret and grief. He was lost, as his Lily was dead, due to his deeds. Love of his life was now dead, his life lost its meaning. Fresh bream of tears fell from his eyes.</p>
<p>"I am sorry Lily. I failed you." He wanted her to respond, even a slap would have made him happy but deep down he knew it would never happen. He wanted her. He needed her, to live, to breathe but she was gone. And it was his fault, he thought, partially or fully.</p>
<p>Destiny turned around and saw a Kuekuatseu was howling for his lover, for the moon, as he could never see her, touch her or feel her again. And that Kuekuatseu was Snape.</p>
<p>Albus was waiting for Remus in the bar. The three broomsticks weren't the place he'd visit often. Today, the options for the location were limited.</p>
<p>"Did you send a message, professor?" Remus asked while his three-year-old niece slept in his arms.</p>
<p>"Is she Sigyn?" asked the old man, his gaze softened with affection.</p>
<p>"Yes, she is. My niece," the werewolf responded with a small smile of pride.</p>
<p>Both of them looked at her sleeping innocent form. She was not supposed to be with him right now, there were only 3 days left for the full moon. But there was no option. And much to his surprise, his wolf wasn't trying to hurt her, but it was trying to protect her. He was fascinated.</p>
<p>Dumbledore saw Sigyn too. She was going to change the future, he knew for sure, but he couldn't decide if it was a positive change or the negative one. He saw that Remus loved her as if she was his daughter. He smiled at the relationship Sigyn developed with the werewolf.</p>
<p>"James and Lily are dead, Remus," the old man said after minutes of silence.</p>
<p>Remus stiffened. Gone. His best friends, in one night. His best mate who always helped him, financially, emotionally. And even physically at the full moons by being Animagus. And Lily. The kind friend who didn't judge him for being a werewolf. Parents of the beautiful child, Harry. But how was this possible? They were going into hiding somewhere where not even he was informed about. Dumbledore personally was going to ensure their safety.</p>
<p>"H-How?" he managed to ask shakily.</p>
<p>"Sirius betrayed them. He told their hiding location and killed Peter," the professor replied calmly.</p>
<p>The werewolf was shocked beyond infinity. Sirius betrayed James and Lily! But he was always loyal. He hated death eaters more than them. He hated his family. Why would he do that? Was he forced to do so? Was it a lie? Did he pretend to be a lion when he was actually a serpent? And he killed Peter? Why? Peter was so innocent and weak.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>His friends were dead.</p>
<p>Two by Voldemort.</p>
<p>One betrayed two of them and killed the other.</p>
<p>His first cousin, Hank was killed, leaving Sigyn orphan.</p>
<p>What was he supposed to do?</p>
<p>And what about Sigyn and Harry? Sigyn wasn't safe with him. He was a bloody werewolf.</p>
<p>"What about Harry, Albus?" he asked, his eyes wide, and tone softer.</p>
<p>"He'd live with Petunia and her husband," Dumbledore stated.</p>
<p>At first, he didn't remember who Petunia was. And when he did, he got furious.</p>
<p>"Albus, trust me, in my life I have seen many muggles, they are just the worst. Petunia hates Lily. Then why would she take care of the son of the woman she hates the most? She wouldn't take care of Harry. She would-" he continued but the old man raised his hand indicating the werewolf to stop.</p>
<p>"I know what I am doing, Remus. Yes, she might have hated Lily, but she was; Afterall, her sister. She cannot hate her sister so much that she won't be sad after hearing about her death and not taking her orphan nephew under her shelter. She would take him, and obviously, she would have some conditions, like not tolerating visits from anyone from the wizarding world, but she would take Harry," Albus said calmly.</p>
<p>Remus sighed.</p>
<p>"Fine, Albus. Afterall I cannot have a say over where Harry should stay," he said resignation and wariness in his voice.</p>
<p>Albus offered him a small smile. Sigyn suddenly started to cry and Remus tried to soothe her. She didn't take a long time to fall asleep though. His brows were knitted, indicating that something was bothering him immensely.</p>
<p>"What is it, Remus?" Albus asked after some time.</p>
<p>"What you are talking about, Albus?" Remus asked, playing dumb.</p>
<p>"Are you worried about Sigyn?" Albus asked as it was the only thing that could have distracted Remus from the news of deaths and betrayals.</p>
<p>This time though, he felt like he should share his worry with the headmaster, not for anyone else, not even for himself, but for his niece, for Sigyn.</p>
<p>"Yes, Albus. What am I going to do for her? She isn't safe with me. I need to find some arrangement for her. But how? I want to raise her, Albus, just like my daughter, but I am a werewolf. And I cannot put her in danger for some of my foolish wishes," he finally said, his eyebrows creasing more and more and his lips turning downwards, forming a frown.</p>
<p>Albus was thoughtful and silent. Remus was right. Sigyn needed parents. And even if Remus wanted to raise her, being a werewolf was a hazard. Sigyn needed parents and a family. She needed to be taken cared of. He had gone through several options for some time.</p>
<p>"I think I know the solution, Remus. I know a family," he said with his signature smile and Remus smiled too, looking at his niece.</p>
