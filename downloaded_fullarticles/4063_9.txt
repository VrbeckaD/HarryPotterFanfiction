  <em>“Come on Harry, say it, say Padfoot.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Moony.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Oh for f-fudge’s sake!”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Told you. I’m his favourite.  Aren’t I?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Moony.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Listen here, Harry.  I’m your God-Father and I’m supposed to buy you stuff.  That’s the deal.  So the least you can do for me is say Padfoot. Pad-foot.  Your Mother’s smart, you should be able to pick this up fairly easily.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Moony.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“No.  Pad-foot.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“P-”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Yes, keep going.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“P-oo.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“This is ridiculous Harry.  Pad-foot.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Moony.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“James!  Your child is broken and needs to sort out his priorities!”</em>
</p><p>Harry just nods to Ron, unsure what to make of the random memory.  Soon enough he’s distracted by dogs and Quidditch and a deadly mystery, his memory forgotten once more.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Two years later…</em>
</p><p>“Come on, everywhere else is full,” Hermione tells them, they go into the compartment with the sleeping man.</p><p>“Who do you think that is?” Ron wonders.</p><p>“Professor R J Lupin.”</p><p>“Do you know everything? How is it she knows everything?”</p><p>“It’s on his suitcase Ronald.”</p><p>“Oh.”  Harry suddenly looks up at the suitcase, eyes widening as he recognises it.</p><p>
  <em>“MERRY CHRISTMAS! We come bearing presents!”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Come on in, Pads.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Is that Sirius?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Yes Lily, and Moony.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Well I hardly thought one would show up without the other.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“We aren’t attached at the hip you know Lily.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Of course not Remus.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Oh, there’s my God-Son, how are you Mini-Prongs?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Honestly, Sirius, his name is Harry.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Are you serious?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“I’m not falling for that again.  Harry, say hi to your Uncle Moony and Uncle Padfoot.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Moony, cholate?” </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“So that’s how you’ve trained him to say your name.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Hello?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Peter!”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“I’m not too late am I?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Not at all, we ready for this?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Ready for what?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Well, you see Moony, the four of us decided to pool together for your Christmas present this ye – no don’t start arguing, we’ve already got it, here.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The present is opened revealing a suitcase.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Professor RJ Lupin.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“You’re going to need it when you go off to work at Hogwarts.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Prongs…”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Nope, it’ll happen.  Trust me, will you?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Thank you, all of you, I love it.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Moony!”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Oh come on Harry, really?  Come now, say Padfoot.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Moony.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Come on Harry.  Say it.  Say Padfoot.”</em>
</p><p>Harry comes out of the memory, looking at the man beside him.  Could it be?  Is this the Moony from his memories?</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Later…</em>
</p><p>“Here, eat this, it’ll help.  It’s all right, it’s chocolate.” Harry shakily takes the chocolate from the man.</p><p>
  <em>“Harry, say hi to your Uncle Moony and Uncle Padfoot.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Moony, cholate?” </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“So that’s how you’ve trained him to say your name.”</em>
</p><p>Harry’s face breaks out into a grin before he can help it, words tumbling from his mouth unfiltered.</p><p>“Glad to see some things never change, Uncle Moony.” </p><p>3 pairs of eyes are glued to his face, all shocked, one hopeful.</p></div>
