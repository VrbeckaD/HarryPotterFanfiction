    <p>Hermione was going to hell.</p>
<p>Or she was already there, honestly she couldn’t quite decide.</p>
<p>She scrunched her pillow over her head once again, desperately trying to ignore the noises from the other side of the wall and cursed her luck for getting into this situation.</p>
<p>In her less rational, sleep deprived state she decided that the blame could be laid squarely at the feet of one Harry James Potter.</p>
<p>If he’d left her to be troll paste none of this would be happening right now.</p>
<p>No, that was unfair, really the only person she could blame was herself for accepting McGonagall’s offer of an ‘eighth’ year at Hogwarts and then for foolishly agreeing to be Head Girl. God she’d seen it as <em>honour.</em> What an idiot. All she’d seen was a private common room, and an all access pass to the library. It never occurred to her to ask who the Head Boy would be.</p>
<p>It could have been worse she supposed, it could have been Davis (a prat) or MacMillan (bloody awful) or Crabbe – no wait. He was dead. So was Ernie actually, she forgot that for a moment. Anyway, not the point, apparently in a moment of absolute insanity the school board chose Blaise Zabini to be her partner. According to what she could gather after their appointment they were seen as the perfect compromise – the shining Gryffindor Golden Girl and the Respected Slytherin Neutral. Or something. Hermione thought the Sorting Hat might have been involved and there was nothing that the over rated piece of headwear liked better than to ‘heal house rifts’.</p>
<p>Given their disparate lives and, at times, hostility towards one another it was somewhat of a miracle that they became friends.</p>
<p>Good friends actually.</p>
<p>Friends that, when one decided to take a year before gaining a Potions Mistress certification, offered to let them stay at their house with no expectations whatsoever.</p>
<p>Blaise had moved the family’s base of operations to their country home in the wide-open spaces of Hertfordshire. Surrounded on all sides with lush farmland the house was off the beaten path, with magical transportation the only real efficient ways of reaching the property. It was built under the Tudors, though it had been renovated many times since, and maintained some of that old world charm. She’d been hesitant to impose at first but he’d assured her that there was plenty of room for her to stay, and when she still hesitated he proved how well he knew her by luring her in with promises of a library and access to her very own potions lab. She’d been surprised by that at first, but according to Blaise it was common for Pureblood homes to have an onsite lab, as it used to be traditional for apprentices to accept the patronage of powerful families before going out into the world. </p>
<p>There was just one thing she wished Blaise had been a bit more up front about before she moved in to the room next door to his.</p>
<p>And that was how much he enjoyed screwing his boyfriend Draco Malfoy nightly and with great abandon.</p>
<p>She should have switched rooms that first night, but this one had the most glorious shower attached to it and Hermione had fallen head over heels in love with it.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that she was a prude or anything of the sort, it was more that she objected to having her sleep disturbed by what sounded like some very impressive and enjoyable acrobatics, made all the worse by the fact that she was currently <em>not </em>enjoying any kinds of acrobatics.</p>
<p>The problem, she decided, thumping her head back on the pillow, wasn’t even that.</p>
<p>It was the fact that both of them were bloody gorgeous and she’d probably climb both of them like a tree if they showed any bit of an interest.</p>
<p>This was why she was going to hell.</p>
<p>A low moan reverberated through the wall, followed by a light chuckle and the unmistakable sound of flesh hitting flesh. She wriggled into her bedding, trying to convince herself that it was a <em>bad idea</em> even as her legs opened and one hand cupped her breast.</p>
<p>Casting a quick Silencio on herself (she had tried soundproofing the walls but the wards just wouldn’t stick) she settled in to listen.</p>
<p>With every moan and gasp her movements grew more sure, one hand pulling restlessly at her nipples while the other danced over her clit.</p>
<p>She’d learned several smell-be-gone spells since moving in one month ago, and yet every time one of the boys walked past her room she was <em>sure</em> they knew. Really there should be no hiding it anymore, her arousal reaching its climax in time with the cut off shout from next door. The waves of orgasm washed over her, her body relaxing just enough that sleep might actually now be possible.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, she decided. Tomorrow she’d talk to Blaise and settle this once and for all.</p>
<p align="center">~*~</p>
<p>“I what?” said Blaise the next morning.</p>
<p>“You snore,” Hermione said quickly. “Loudly. It’s awful. I was just wondering if there was any chance you knew what wards the walls would accept,”</p>
<p>Blaise looked stunned for a moment before rubbing the back of his neck ruefully. “Sorry Hermione, I completely forgot to tell you, the house is keyed to the Zabini bloodline so it…only accepts wards from me?”</p>
<p>“Oh.” Hermione sighed, pinching the bridge of her nose, god she couldn’t keep doing this. Not when <em>this</em> meant objectifying two men who were becoming more and more important to her by the day.</p>
<p>“Blaise could put some up for you today if it’s really bothering you,” Draco offered for his lover as he slowly ate his cereal. Hermione turned hopeful eyes back to the other man, who spread his arms and promised to see what he could do.</p>
<p>Grateful to both of them Hermione offered to cook dinner for tonight, which the boys happily accepted, before disappearing downstairs into the potions lab. She hadn’t thought much of it at the time but now as she shut the door behind her she was grateful to have a place to escape to, even if that wasn’t exactly its intended purpose.</p>
<p>“What do you get out of it?” she’d asked the first time she’d seen it, already mentally re-organising the entire space.</p>
<p>“From you? Nothing but the genuine pleasure of your company,” he’d kissed her hand and she’d blushed.</p>
<p>“Charmer,” she said.</p>
<p>He winked.</p>
<p>“How do you think I got Draco to agree to go out with me?”</p>
<p>Now, the two men were clearing up breakfast when Draco felt enough time had passed, and that Hermione wouldn’t overhear.</p>
<p>“I know I said you would but are you actually going to put up the wards?” he asked. “You know neither of us snore.”</p>
<p>“Hmmm.” Blaise held his coffee thoughtfully, watching Draco with heavy eyes. “Do you want me to?”</p>
<p>Draco smiled.</p>
<p>“Not really.”</p>
<p align="center">~*~</p>
<p>Dinner had gone well.</p>
<p>Hermione cooked a nice lasagne with some garlic bread and it was devoured quickly. There was red wine to relax them all, and they spent hours talking and laughing before the lure of sleep finally got to them.</p>
<p>Then it all went downhill.</p>
<p>Hermione wondered if it was possible for the walls to get thinner overnight.</p>
<p>Every movement they made she could hear, her thighs clenching unconsciously as she studiously kept her hands above the covers.</p>
<p>Hands hit the other side of the wall.</p>
<p>“Shhhh, she’ll hear us,” Blaise chided gently.</p>
<p>A quiet whine had her clamping her hands to her mouth. She should leave, she should just go and sleep downstairs.</p>
<p>“What would you do, I wonder?” Blaise continued, “If she could see you like this, hm? If she saw you pressed against the wall practically begging to be fucked?”</p>
<p>Draco’s voice was indistinct as he presumably answered the question. Hermione sat up slowly. When did she become a part of their bedplay? A part of her was incensed by the perceived insult, but the larger was curious. Quietly, so quietly, she moved forward to try and hear better.</p>
<p>“No, face the wall, Draco,” Blaise ordered. She wondered at how clear his voice had become, like the promised wards had just made the situation worse. “I want you to imagine she’s here Draco, tell her exactly what you’d do to her <em>right now</em>,”</p>
<p>“I’d-ah!” Draco cut himself off, struggling to form words between whatever it was Blaise was doing to him. “I’d tell her, that, that I’d wanted her since Hogwarts, how beautiful she is. That whenever she was being so <em>blasted clever</em> I’d want to kiss her silly. I’d-uhm-I’d-<em>fuck</em>-I want to see her come in my arms, lay her down and lick her until she begged me to stop,”</p>
<p>“Would you?” Blaise asked.</p>
<p>“Not unless you told me to do,”</p>
<p>A choked off moan greeted his words, Hermione unable to hold it back at the image his words conjured. Would Blaise join in or just lazily stroke himself as he directed their pleasure? Fuck she could almost see it, her fingers working furiously between her legs, mirroring Draco’s position pressed up against the wall.</p>
<p>Hearing her, the two men stilled for a moment before Blaise continued pushing his cock further into Draco’s arse. Merlin, he loved feeling the slender man clench tightly around him, grunting as he seated himself fully.</p>
<p>“Can you see it Draco?” he whispered now. “See her in here with us, being with us, <em>begging </em>us,”</p>
<p><em>“Yes-</em>“ a gasp as Blaise pulled at his cock.</p>
<p>“No words, not yet,” Blaise continued. “Just be <em>loud</em>, let her hear you enjoy this and think of what it will be like to have her quiver beneath us,”</p>
<p>Another moan from the room next to them and Blaise just smiled as he focused on his lover, Draco crying out with every stroke, certain that by the next night all his plans would come to fruition.</p>
<p align="center">~*~</p>
<p>Oh god she couldn’t look at them.</p>
<p>As soon as she’d woken up the next day she’d hurriedly cleaned up and dressed before retreating (hiding) to her lab. She had a time sensitive potion to work on and she didn’t want to be distracted.</p>
<p>Still.</p>
<p>Since Hogwarts?</p>
<p>She’d wondered sometimes, if there was something more to this friendship but to find out it had been going on for that long? Really?</p>
<p>Is that the only reason Blaise let her stay, to dangle in front of Draco like bait? Or…were they the bait? And if they were…what then?</p>
<p>Her potion spoiled with a foul-smelling plume of smoke, the golden hue turning a soggy yellow.</p>
<p>Damn. There went her excuse.</p>
<p>Backing away from the table she took a deep breath. She was a Gryffindor. She went after what she wanted with perilous abandon, jump first, think later, fall hard.</p>
<p>A plan then.</p>
<p>Looking towards the door leading to the rest of the house, she tapped her wand against her leg lightly, before striding through it with all the confidence she could muster.</p>
<p>She found Draco in the quiet kitchen, as he put together lunch for the three of them.</p>
<p>“Draco? Can I talk to you for a second?” she asked, feeling a little guilty at his wide eyes and…is that a blush?</p>
<p>“Uh, yeah, Hermione, what’s up?” he wiped his hands on the tea towel, desperately trying to be casual at her approach. She stopped a little closer than she would have yesterday, another two steps and she’d be pressed against his chest.</p>
<p>“What is the plan here Draco?” she asked, hoping the direct approach would get her answers.</p>
<p>“Plan? There is no plan,” Draco denied furiously.</p>
<p>“I heard you and Blaise last night,” she said, tired of hiding it all. “And I think you meant me to,”</p>
<p>Draco’s expression lightened, his frown becoming a wicked smirk. He closed the distance himself, until she was pressed against a kitchen counter. And there went her plan to be all confident and alluring until he cracked like an egg. Her breath came in short gasps, her body suddenly aware of their differences in physical strength. Unbidden came the image of being pinned between the both of them, no where to go except to chase her pleasure up and up and-</p>
<p>“Did you enjoy it?”</p>
<p>Grey eyes held hers, refusing her any chance of escape.</p>
<p>“You know I did,” she said quietly.</p>
<p>“Then what’s the problem?”</p>
<p>“I don’t enjoy being toyed with,”</p>
<p>“Are you sure? Blaise is very good at it,”</p>
<p>“What are you-? No, Draco!”</p>
<p>He sighed and backed away, allowing her space to breathe.</p>
<p>“Look, just, come talk to us? Please?” Draco said. “If you don’t like what we have to say then I’ll get Blaise to stop with the games, promise.”</p>
<p>“You mean it?”</p>
<p>He tugged nervously at the chain necklace at his throat. “Yeah, absolutely,”</p>
<p>“Okay then,”   </p>
<p>He put things away in the kitchen quickly, as if she’d vanish if he took too long. Holding her hand gently he pulled her towards Blaise’s study. She’d never been in there, despite walking past it every day to reach her lab but was unsurprised to see Blaise bent over his work as head of the Zabini family. The Zabini’s, she’d been surprised to learn, were heavily involved in investing in Muggle technology as well as Wizarding innovation. The result was a mess of paperwork and bureaucracy that made managing the family business an exercise in frustration. It was probably why his mother had left it to him before marrying another man somewhere on the continent.</p>
<p>Draco knocked on the frame before entering properly, waiting for Blaise to wave them in.</p>
<p>“Hermione, Draco, time for lunch already?”</p>
<p>“No, not yet,” Draco’s hand tightened in hers. “Hermione has questions.”</p>
<p>“Hermione always has questions,” Blaise countered dryly.</p>
<p>She swallowed hard, determined to speak. Now she was here, seeing Blaise lean back in his leather chair behind a dark desk, she had the uncomfortable feeling of being in trouble. Like she’d stepped into something she wasn’t sure she’d bee able to step out of easily.</p>
<p>“He means,” she swallowed again. “Questions about...this” she finished weakly, her free arm gesturing to the three of them.</p>
<p>“This…” Blaise stood slowly. Somehow, he appeared more to her eyes, like there was something about <em>his</em> space that made it that way. “This, as you put it, is Draco and I very much wanting to fuck you, Hermione,”</p>
<p>“Oh,” she said weakly.</p>
<p>She actually hadn’t quite expected him to just come out and <em>say</em> it.</p>
<p>He stalked closer, a hand reaching out to stroke her hair gently.</p>
<p>“This, Hermione, is me wanting to take care of you like I take care of Draco. This is wanting desperately for the two of you to be mine.”</p>
<p>“I…what?”</p>
<p>Suddenly Draco dropped her hand, moving behind her and burying his face in the side of her neck, placing feather light kisses there. His hands rested lightly on her hips, holding her in place as Blaise continued to pet her hair softly, but loosely enough that she could break free if she wanted. She couldn’t deny that it felt good between them, safe. Staring up at the man in front of her it was as if her entire focus had been dedicated purely to him. It was…relaxing. </p>
<p>“This Hermione,” he sighed, tilting her head up and brushing a thumb against her lips. “Is wanting to come home every day to the two of you. This is wanting to be your friend and lover and so much more,”</p>
<p>He moved closer until his eyes filled her vision, Draco drawing light circles with his thumbs. He had stopped kissing her neck, instead watching quietly as Blaise closed the distance and drew Hermione in for a kiss.</p>
<p>She’d been kissed before, clumsy ones in the dark while it felt like the world was ending around them, and none of them compared to his. Blaise’s lips met hers with a surety she hadn’t felt before, that there would be no question that she’d open to him. His tongue slipped inside, brushing lightly against hers, before vanishing again, drawing her forward to him. She hadn’t noticed her eyes close, only Draco’s hands stopped her from moving forward to chase his lips for more.</p>
<p>“And I think, Hermione, you want this just as much as Draco and I do,”</p>
<p>He smiled down at her and his lover, before meeting pleading grey eyes. Tightening his grip on her curls he tilted Hermione’s head away from him and towards Draco.</p>
<p>She was still as she waited, her hands clenching in anticipation. Draco hesitated, seeming to need to know it was okay before making a move. He wasn’t waiting for her though, no she had that impression again, that she was in more trouble than she’d thought. Soft lips met hers, hesitant at first but gaining in confidence when she didn’t pull away. A quick flick of his tongue against closed lips in invitation, and he deepened the kiss further until she was chasing him, holding on to his arm to prevent his escape.</p>
<p>A pleased hum from above them, and a tug on those curls drew them apart.</p>
<p>“Leaving the two of you alone together could be trouble, I’ll have to see what I can do about that,” said Blaise.</p>
<p>“Sorry,” she replied breathlessly, although she wasn’t sure what for. Draco said nothing, moving his arms so they were wrapped around her waist, and burying his head back in her shoulder.</p>
<p>“But still,” Blaise finally removed his hand from her hair. “We are going to have such fun together.”</p>
