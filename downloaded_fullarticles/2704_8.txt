<p> </p>
<p>            Two years had passed, and even still Credence always felt that pang of uncertainty each year when he traveled back to Ilvermorny.  In that time, he’d found his place, found peace with being an omega.  No one treated him differently.  Not at school anyways.  When he left the safety of school things were different.  Credence did his best to hide what he was.  The school had told him that they believed it would be in his best interest to keep his status a secret from his adopted mother.  Mary Lou didn’t want to take Credence back in and yet when he stepped out into the station at the end of his first year and each year after that she was there to pick him up.  That was the end of her involvement though.  Credence was left to fend for himself the rest of the summer.  In a way he was almost grateful, he believed it was better to take care of himself rather than be beaten.</p>
<p>            “Credence come sit with us.”  Queenie waved for the young man to join them.  Their carriage had room for one more.  Jacob, Tina, Seraphina, and Percival were already seated inside.  Throughout the years Credence and Queenie had grown close.  He sat by and watched her, and Jacob grow close. </p>
<p>            Credence looked towards Queenie and past her at the rest of the carriage.  His stomach dropped a little seeing Percival.  The other student looked as though he’d grown at least six inches over the summer.  He was starting to lose the boy look that Credence was holding onto for dear life.  Judging by the way other people were walking past their carriage, pointing and whispering Credence could tell he wasn’t the only one that noticed.  “Are you sure that there’s enough room?”  He had never sat with them before and didn’t want to impose in any way.  Regardless of how close the two were when it came to traveling to and from school they always tended to travel separately. </p>
<p>            “Oh, come on.  There’s plenty of room Credence.  No one’s sitting next to Percy.”  Queenie motioned for him to come with her.  Tina stepped out of the carriage and waved for the two of them to get a move on. </p>
<p>            Instead of arguing Credence followed Queenie to the carriage.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>            “So, what’d you do this summer Sera?”  Percival sat next to her and made himself comfortable. </p>
<p>            Seraphina shrugged casually.  She hadn’t done anything overly exciting.  Her grandmother had allowed her to take a trip with her uncle which gave her a chance to see the government in action.  It was completely and utterly boring to most people.  Seraphina knew that if she began to tell Percival about it, he would immediately tune her out.  He’d grown up around all of that, the politics, the government, the Aurors.</p>
<p>            None of it was overly interesting to him.  “Nothing particularly interesting.  What about you Percival?”</p>
<p>            Percival smiled wryly.  “Nothing except I spent a couple of weeks going in to work with my father.  Although I have to say there’s nothing quite as boring as two weeks filing reports for MACUSA’s Department of Security.” </p>
<p>            That sounded more exciting than she could even comprehend.  “Oh… that’s all.”  Her voice sounded utterly bored. </p>
<p>            “Don’t act like you weren’t in New York too.  I saw you walking through MACUSA with your uncle.  I was just busy playing shadow with daddy.  Stopping to say hi is highly inappropriate and unprofessional.”  Percival made sure to sound as mocking as possible.</p>
<p>            Seraphina began to laugh just a little and when she thought about it working with Percival’s father sounded utterly nightmarish. </p>
<p>            Queenie entered the carriage along with Tina and Credence.  Jacob was already wrestling with his belongings to sort out the basket from his mother.  “Welcome back everyone.”  Queenie smiled as she sat down next to Jacob and Tina. </p>
<p>            Seraphina made sure that the only place for Credence to sit was next to Percival.  “Welcome back Queenie, Credence nice of you to join us.” </p>
<p>            Credence sat down next to Percival, hands in his lap twisting his robe nervously.  “Thank you.  Hope you all had a great summer.” </p>
<p>            Percival laughed a little along with Seraphina.  “That’s really a loaded statement Credence.”  The comment was muttered under his breath. </p>
<p>            Seraphina sighed loud and looked at Credence.  “Credence if you only knew.  Percy and I were just discussing our summer.  Great would be an overstatement, but it was interesting.  What about you?”</p>
<p>            He should have known that if he brought up summer someone would ask about his.  That was part of the reason why Credence had always avoided traveling back to school with anyone that he spoke with regularly.  “I… oh I didn’t really do much of anything really.”  Which for the most part was the truth. </p>
<p>            Percival eyed him carefully.  Credence looked as though he hadn’t slept in days, hadn’t had a decent meal in weeks.  There was a part of him that wanted to say something about it, and at the same time, there was another part that wanted to wait and not say a word.  Perhaps when they weren’t in a carriage full of people he’d say something. </p>
<p>             “Credence you look like you’ve lost quite a bit of weight.”  Tina stated eyeing him carefully.  She had grown protective of him over the last couple of years. </p>
<p>             The entire carriage turned to look at Credence and he immediately shrunk in on himself.  It was true that he’d lost weight, most of the weight he’d managed to put on over the year.  When he was only allowed to eat once every day it was hard to maintain weight especially when he had grown used to eating three times a day, as much as he wanted.  Mary Lou had told him he’d grown gluttonous.  “I may have lost a couple of pounds.  I spent quite a bit of time outside this summer, so I didn’t quite pay attention to how much I ate.”</p>
<p>             Percival didn’t buy it, neither did Tina.  The two glanced at each other across the carriage and dropped the subject.  It was clear that Credence didn’t want to talk about it.  Percival moved slightly and rested his shoulder against the younger boy.  He smiled to himself when he felt Credence relax at the contact. </p>
<p>             “Okay, everyone.  Pastries from my mom.”  Jacob opened the basket that he’d finally sorted out and offered one to everyone. </p>
<p>             Queenie and Tina quickly picked a paczki which was their personal favorites.  Seraphina opted for a cream horn.  Percival looked in the basket and glanced over towards Credence waiting for him to pick something first.  Credence though didn’t know what to pick; he’d never had anything like these.  His eyes widened and then looked at the other three that had already chosen something, then over to Percival. </p>
<p>              Jacob was going to offer a pastry to Credence, but instead, Percival reached into the basket and plucked the two blueberry scones out.  He offered one to Credence who took it with a smile.  “Thank you.” He muttered quietly.</p>
<p>             Percival nodded his head and broke a piece of his scone off to take a bite.  “Jacob, your mom really outdid herself this time.  These are fantastic.” </p>
<p>             Everyone else in the carriage agreed.  Credence remained silent, mouth full of the scone.  He nodded along with the agreement that rang through the cart.  Everyone fell silent as they began to eat their baked goods.  Jacob smiled brightly.  “Thanks, guys.  I’ll be sure to let her know.”  Just then the carriage jerked into motion. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>            The trip back to Ilvermorny was uneventful.  Tina and Jacob talked about their classes.  The two had quite a few of the same classes which meant they had a lot to talk about.  Percival and Seraphina talked for a little bit, though Seraphina talked more to Queenie, finding that she was interested in what classes the younger student was taking.  Percival took note of the interaction and decided that if Seraphina gave him a difficult time about Credence in the future, he would be revisiting this trip back to school.  Credence for his part rode in silence unless someone specifically spoke to him. </p>
<p>            It was unnerving be in the carriage with people that had done so much over the summer.  Credence felt very out of his element.  When they were back at school, it was easy to hide the fact that his life wasn’t anywhere near as exciting or as comfortable as anyone else.  He found it so much easier just to remain silent unless spoken too and in a way that was very disheartening too.  That made him feel like he was back home and waiting for ma to strike. </p>
<p>            Queenie turned to Credence during a lull in the conversation with Seraphina.  “Credence you're very quiet.”  She paused and watched him for a moment and the smile fell from her face.  “H… how come you didn’t come and visit us over the summer?  We don’t live terribly far, and it would have been fine if you would have stayed with us for a few days.”</p>
<p>            Everyone glanced between the two and Credence could feel the blush climb from his neck to his hairline.  He didn’t want to talk about his summer and yet there was something about what Queenie said that made him feel as though she knew how his summer went.  “Oh, it… it’s fine Queenie.  Really.  I had a fine summer.  It was… I was actually rather busy.”</p>
<p>            Percival didn’t say anything.  He could feel the way that Credence tensed when he spoke, could sense the change in his demeanor.  He knew that the other boy wasn’t being honest.  He could hear the quickened rate of Credence’s heartbeat.</p>
<p>            Tina narrowed her eyes between Credence and Queenie.  She opened her mouth to say something and closed it again.  Her expression was concerned, and at the same time, there was something about the look on Queenie’s face that made Tina realize that now was not the time for them to attempt to discuss whatever it was that Queenie saw. </p>
<p>            Seraphina and Jacob both cleared their throat, and everyone else in the carriage looked between them.  Jacob smiled widely “So, is everyone glad to be back this year?  I finally feel like we’re getting somewhere.” </p>
<p>            Queenie and Credence didn’t answer.  Percival nodded without saying a word.  Seraphina regarded Jacob carefully for a moment.  “Two more years after this and I’ll finally be done.  I’ve been looking forward to that since I started at Ilvermorny.” </p>
<p>            Tina hadn’t thought much about after she was done with school.  She knew that Jacob just wanted to continue working with his mother.  Tina wanted to be an Auror, and that was something that wasn’t common.  “Sera I think you probably were born knowing what you wanted to do when you finished with school.”</p>
<p>            Percival snorted at that because for all intents and purposes it was true.  Credence looked over at the other boy when he started to laugh.  “That’s not a lie Tina.  Seraphina has been quite determined since I’ve known her.”  Shifting in his seat, Percival bumped into Credence and glanced down at him.  Instead of moving the two remained where they were. </p>
<p>            Instead of protesting Seraphina nodded her head and smiled.  It was true.  She’d always known that she wanted to work for the government.  It was something that she’d planned on from the beginning. </p>
<p>            The five of them talked amongst each other for the rest of the ride back to school.  Jacob and Queenie talked more than the rest.  Credence remained for the most part silent.  Before they knew it, the carriage came to a halt, and all the students were being ushered out of the carriages and out towards the school. </p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>           </p>
<p>            Every year was the same and Credence was finally starting to get used to it.  After the first year, Percival made it a point to stick with Credence during the sorting.  He tried during the beginning of his second year to tell Percival that he didn’t need to babysit him, but Percival just gave Credence a flat look that meant he was beyond bored.  It was explained to Credence that he wasn’t being babysat, Percival enjoyed being around him. </p>
<p>            Credence wondered if each year the headmistress gave the same speech and it became clear that for the most part, it was the same one each year. </p>
<p>            Towards the end of his first year at Ilvermorny Credence discovered that he was the only omega among all the first years.  The idea was shocking to him; he hadn’t realized that omegas were so rare regardless of what the pamphlets said.  Alphas were more common though based on what he’d come to learn they clearly weren’t that much more common than omegas.  The only alpha Credence was aware of was Percival, though Percival assured Credence that there were at the very least three others in the school.  Most people tended to keep those things to themselves.  Credence hadn’t shared it with Queenie, Tina or Jacob.  The only person who knew was Percival, and the only reason he’d shared it with him was that Credence felt oddly drawn to the older boy.</p>
<p>            Everyone had their suspicions about the two.  Seraphina especially questioned Percival and his intentions, but whenever anything was said both ignored the questions.</p>
<p>            As soon as the students were dismissed to their common rooms, Percival turned to Credence.  “Are you ready?” </p>
<p>            Credence was pulled from his reverie to glance at Percival.  “Y… yeah.  Sure.  You know you don’t have to walk with me.  I’m sure I won’t get lost like I did that first year.”  The two had already begun to walk along together though. </p>
<p>            Percival huffed a breath and shook his head.  “I know I don’t have to walk with you.  I like walking with you.  You happen to be one of the few people that can make me laugh.”  It was true and even if Percival did like admitting that there was something about Credence and his little flickers of humor that would make him smile. </p>
<p>            The two continued to walk along the corridor together.  The silence started to weigh on Percival, and he turned to Credence.  “Can I ask you something?”  Pausing his eyes scanned the younger boy for an answer or reaction. </p>
<p>            Steps slowing to a halt Credence moved to the edge of the walkway.  “Um… yeah sure.”  He was nervous though there wasn’t a real reason to be. </p>
<p>            “What happened in the carriage on the ride back here?  Why didn’t you want to talk about your summer?”  Percival waited for an answer.  It was clear to him that something was wrong when Queenie brought it up. </p>
<p>            Credence was in a bad spot.  He’d never lied to Percival.  Even when they first met he’d always been honest with him.  Sure, Credence could tell him that he didn’t really want to talk about it and the chances were that the answer would be respected.  For once though there was a part of Credence that felt like he wanted to open up to someone.  Tell them exactly how miserable his life was when he was at home.  Frowning Credence took a shuddering breath.  “Nothing happened in the carriage.  It’s just that Queenie can read thoughts… She knows how bad my ma is.  Normally I try not to think about it too much when she’s around.  Today though I was thinking about the fact that I couldn’t wait to get back here because I hadn’t eaten in two days.  My ma lets me come home for the summer and the holidays, but she doesn’t let me stay there and rarely lets me eat.”  The blush that began to creep up his neck was fully settled on Credence’s face now. </p>
<p>            None of that had been anything that Percival expected to hear.  His stomach dropped, heart ached just thinking about Credence, his poor boy out on the streets starving during the holidays and summer.  “Credence you can’t keep going back there if that’s how she treats you.”  If Queenie was offering to let him come there, he should go there, though Percival was going to contact his parents immediately and speak with them about allowing Credence to come and stay with them.  He’d spent a great deal of time talking about the younger student during the summer. </p>
<p>            Perhaps he couldn’t keep going back there, but right now there was nowhere else that he could go.  Instead of saying anything Credence merely shrugged and began to walk again.  His shoulders were hunched in on themselves further than usual, and Percival couldn’t help but lag and watch him as he moved towards their common room.  </p>
<p>            “Welcome back everyone!!” Yana was just making her way to the common room door with a large smile on her face.  “How was your summer?”</p>
<p>            Credence smiled and waved.  “Mine was fine to thank you.  How was yours?”</p>
<p>            Percival was standing beside Credence and reached around him to push the door open so that the three of them could make their way inside and not hold up the crowds.</p>
<p>            “Mine was exciting.  I went to visit family in New Mexico and then Arizona.  A couple of cousins came back here to visit and then we had a rather large family reunion.”  Yana was speaking animatedly about her summer and didn’t notice Credence who appeared rather distracted. </p>
<p>            Deciding to speak up Percival rested a hand on Credence’s shoulder.  “That sounds like you were pretty busy.  Tell me…”  He trailed off for a moment knowing that Yana was the head girl this year.  “Did Credence and I get to put together as I requested at the end of the year last year?”</p>
<p>            Credence looked up at Percival confused and then at Yana.  “What?”</p>
<p>            Yana nodded her head in confirmation.  “Of course, you did.  You’re a Graves Percival.  If you ask for something, you get it.” </p>
<p>            Credence was preparing to protest when Percival rested his hand on the back of Credence’s neck and ushered him towards the stairs.  “Come on Credence.  I know you said you weren’t feeling that great and thought you needed to eat.  Let’s get settled in and get you to the dining hall.” </p>
<p>            Without even thinking about it the younger student complied, following Percival’s words and actions walking towards the stairs. </p>
<p> </p>
