    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p>Petunia Dursley felt like a criminal in her own home. She was sneaking down the stairs, carefully avoiding the squeaky step. She held her breath, watching for any sign that her husband, Vernon, had noticed that she was gone. Once Petunia determined that the close was clear, she tiptoed to the door under the stairs. She carefully opened the door, revealing a small boy with messy black hair and a scar on his forehead.</p>
<p>Petunia stared at the boy, his sleeping face peaceful. For the past two weeks, Petunia had cared for the boy. While Vernon had tried to convince her many times to give the boy up to an orphanage or Children’s Home, every time Petunia looked into the boy’s green eyes, she could hear Lily’s voice, begging her to keep him safe.</p>
<p>It was late at night on Privet Drive in November when Petunia was contemplating her life and sister’s son when the sharp knock on her front door pulled her out of her revere. Sighing, she stood up from where she crouched over the boy’s crib in the cupboard under the stairs and closed the door on the sleeping boy. Petunia had fought with Vernon, quietly, late at night until the two of them had come to an agreement: the boy could stay, but he must always be out of sight. No one could know.</p>
<p>Wrapping her robe tightly around herself, Petunia walked to the door, peering through the glass. Her mouth dropped in shock as she recognized the blurry shapes. While she couldn’t exactly tell who it was, she could recognize the shape of a wizard and a witch anywhere. For a moment, Petunia thought about not answering the door. She didn’t want anything more to do with magic and wizards and witches. However, the shorter figure in dark blue rapped on the door again. Steeling herself, she unlocked the door and twisted the knob to open the door a crack.</p>
<p>For a moment, Petunia didn’t recognize the woman. Her curly hair was bound back in a long braid which trailed over her shoulder and down her front, ending in a silver antler shaped clip. Her bright hazel eyes glimmered at Petunia, a well-groomed eye brow arched. Petunia was awash with memories of awkward dinners and summers where Lily and that dratted Potter would swan about the Evans’ home. She recalled that Potter had dragged his younger sister along several times. Petunia made her business to avoid the lot of them.</p>
<p>Evelyn Potter tossed her head back, her mouth pulling in a sardonic half smile. “Aren’t you going to invite us in, Petunia, or is it your custom to let guests freeze in the cold?”, she said.</p>
<p>Petunia drew herself up and pulled her mouth in a line. “Not if you’re uninvited”, she spat out at her.</p>
<p>“Now, now, ladies. Miss Potter and I are here to come to an agreement with you, Mrs. Dursley”, said the man behind Evelyn Potter. Petunia realized with a jolt that the person with Evelyn Potter was Albus Dumbledore. Although she had not met the man in person, she could recognize the silver bearded wizard anywhere. Lily had shown her a portrait of the Headmaster of Hogwarts years ago, when Lily had come home for the first time.</p>
<p>“Look at him, Tuney! Doesn’t he look like a proper wizard?”, twelve-year old Lily had said. She was showing Petunia a card with a wizard’s portrait on it, excited to show her older sister the headmaster of her school.</p>
<p>Petunia had taken the card, examining the man carefully. She gasped in shock, nearly dropping the card when he had winked at her. “He moved! Lily, he moved!”, Petunia shrieked.</p>
<p>Lily laughed at her shocked expression. “Yeah, they tend to do that in the wizarding world.” Lily leaned forward, her green eyes twinkling. “Apparently, for wizards it’s strange when they don’t move!”</p>
<p>Petunia pursed her lips in  the present moment and opened the door further. She kept her hand on the door and the sill, still blocking the two from entering. “I took the boy in. I did as you said. Now, what do you want from me?”, she demanded.</p>
<p>Dumbledore smiled at her. “First, perhaps, this conversation would be best conducted inside? And I do believe that Miss Potter is anxious to see her nephew.”</p>
<p>Petunia’s mouth tightened even more. Evelyn’s eyebrow raised again. Petunia could see that her hands were drawn into her long sleeves under her grey cloak, the edges of which were decorated with silver animals. For a moment, she thought that the witch would draw her wand on her. Her grip on the door tightened. Again, Petunia considered slamming the door on them and the rest of the world of magic, just as it had to her years before. Petunia saw the witch’s eyes dart to her hand on the door and the way it tightened. Something in her robes twitched.</p>
<p>Sensing tension building, Dumbledore placed a hand on Evelyn’s shoulder. “I do recognize that the last time we corresponded that it wasn’t under the best circumstances. However, Miss Potter has brought to me several concerns which I though was best to address, especially with you. Now, Mrs. Dursley, before Miss Potter and myself freeze in place,” Dumbledore gestured with his other hand into the house, raising an eyebrow,” now, shall we?”</p>
<p>Petunia released her grip on the door and pulled back, letting the two finally in to her home. Evelyn swept past her, releasing a floral scent. Petunia felt an immature urge to blow a raspberry after her. Dumbledore ducked through the door, the tip of his hat barely clearing the doorframe.</p>
<p>Evelyn turned around and looked at Petunia imperiously. “Where is Harry’s room? I want to see him”, she demanded.</p>
<p>Evelyn’s eyes darted all around the house, looking for any sign of her nephew. However, Evelyn only saw pictures of a chubby faced baby boy and his doting parents. There was no sign of Petunia’s sister, or her family.</p>
<p>Petunia was suddenly very aware of how small the door to the cupboard under the stairs was. All Petunia could do was stare at the tiny door, thinking about the boy behind it.</p>
<p>Evelyn’s eyebrows furrowed together, confused. She turned around, following Petunia’s eye line, and spotted the door. She whirled around, wafting more flowery scent around. This time she did draw her wand, sticking it under Petunia’s jaw. “Tell me that Harry isn’t in that closet. Tell me that Harry is in his own room, safe”, she said tightly, her voice dangerously low. Petunia could feel and see her anger through the shaking wand and her tight jaw.</p>
<p>Before Petunia could admit or deny anything, Petunia heard the snicket of the door opening. Her eyes darted over to the sight of Dumbledore bent over the small cot in the cupboard under the stairs. He bent up, holding the sleeping child in his arms. Petunia’s cheeks burned at the sad and disappointed look in Dumbledore’s blue eyes.</p>
<p>“Miss Potter, while I understand your anger, it would be best if you put your wand away. Mrs. Dursley… please lead us to your sitting room”, he said, his voice soft, gently rocking the boy in his arms. He did not look up at Petunia while he did so, keeping his eyes on Harry.</p>
<p>Petunia shivered as Evelyn put her wand down but didn’t put it away. She turned around and took Harry from Dumbledore, softly cooing at the sleeping child’s face. She trailed a finger over the scar on his forehead. Petunia could hear her murmuring something before the scar seemed to disappear.</p>
<p>Dumbledore raised an eyebrow at Evelyn. “It’s still there”, said Evelyn quietly. “I just made it less obvious.”</p>
<p>Dumbledore nodded. “I’m afraid that concealing charms and illusions won’t do much to his scar, my dear. That’s the nature of curse scars.”</p>
<p> Petunia coughed, getting the two’s attention. “This way”, she muttered, taking them through to the sitting room.</p>
<p>With out checking if they followed her in, Petunia sat on the couch. She twisted her hands between her knees, leaning forward. A dark feeling churned in her stomach that she had been ignoring since she put the boy in the cupboard grew and swirled behind her throat. She heard the two-walk in. Looking up, she saw that Evelyn had her wand out and murmuring. She was waving it over the boy, frowning whenever the light on the end of her wand changed. She sat down without looking on Vernon’s favorite chair, still holding the boy.</p>
<p>Evelyn didn’t look anywhere else but at Harry, her hazel eyes on his little face. She gently touched his cheek, cooing at the way his little eyes scrunched up at her touch. Dumbledore stayed standing, smiling at the reunion between nephew and aunt. Suddenly, the soft smile on his face dropped and he turned to Petunia.</p>
<p>“Now, Mrs. Dursley. To the reason why we are here”, his gentle voice gone, almost icy.</p>
<p>Petunia sat up, suddenly feeling like the time she had been caught by her mum and dad smoking with Johnny Green in the park when she was 15. Her father had looked at her in the same disappointed way. Her mother had mostly yelled.</p>
<p>“I had left a letter explaining as to why Harry would be left in your care. When I had left Harry with you, it was under the expectation that your love for your sister would extend to your nephew. It seems I was mistaken.”</p>
<p>At this, Evelyn looked up, almost triumphantly.</p>
<p>“However, I cannot release Harry from your care currently.”</p>
<p>Evelyn’s eyes widened, her mouth opening.</p>
<p>“Dumbledore you cannot be serious! You’ve seen where she put him! Like an unwanted pair of boots, or- or- “She spluttered, her olive skin darkening with anger.</p>
<p>Dumbledore put a hand up. “I understand your anger, Miss Potter. I had not expected that Mrs. Dursley’s love for her sister was so shallow as to be swayed to act in such a way.”</p>
<p>Petunia’s cheeks burned. She wanted to argue with them, say that she did love her sister, that she did everything to convince her husband- but that was a lie, wasn’t it? It only took Vernon three days to convince her to put the boy in the cupboard under the stairs. A voice that sounded like Lily hissed in her ear; you should have tried harder.</p>
<p>She swallowed and looked down to her impeccable carpet.</p>
<p>Dumbledore continued.</p>
<p>“On the night Lily and James died, a mysterious magic happened. This magic has only occurred very rarely in the past thousand years, recorded a handful of times. Each time, dark magic is preformed on a family. Each time, only the child survives. Although there is no perfect record to the exact magic preformed, what can be discerned is that the child has a sort of protection placed on them. The child, while not immune to the cruelties of other people,” Petunia shrank here”, becomes immune to most dark magics. They cannot be harmed by those who are cursed themselves. They cannot be found by those who wish to harm them. They cannot be placed under dark curses themselves, and, in some cases, become immune to nearly all dark spells. I had assumed that Lily’s sacrifice had done the same.”</p>
<p>Here, Dumbledore paused. His eyes were fixed on some point far away. “In every case, the magic preformed was by the mother. Mother’s magic, as we understand it, is particularly powerful in creating protective and healing spells on children. So, by that logic, whenever a child is orphaned or abandoned, it is custom to place the child with the mother’s family. However, Miss Potter has brought up an excellent case. Evelyn?”</p>
<p>Evelyn looked up from Harry. She cleared her throat and remained seated. “The wizarding world is one that places great emphasis and importance on tradition, mostly due to the fear that without it, we would lose our sense of self. Therefore, often we go through the motions without considering why we do what we do. We place the child with the mother’s family because we believe that magic and the power of it comes from the mother. So, when a squib is born, wizarding families place the blame on the mother with out looking into the father. However, in the cases that Professor Dumbledore spoke about, nearly every witch came from a wizarding family. There aren’t many cases of witches who came from muggle families preforming this magic or having to have to preform this magic.” She took a breath here.</p>
<p>Petunia felt like she was being left behind, like a stupid child who hadn’t bothered to read for that day’s lesson.</p>
<p>Evelyn adjusted her grip on Harry. “The understanding of the magic placed on Harry is that he will be protected from dark magic and dark wizards until his 17<sup>th</sup> birthday, on which he becomes an adult by wizarding standards. At that time, his natural magic will break through any child tracking and protection charms, including the magic placed on him. The magic is believed to be at its most powerful when placed among ‘those who share the blood of the mother’. But that’s the keyword right there. Believed. There is no evidence to suggest that placing the child with the mother’s family makes the magic more powerful, or that the child even needs to be placed with a specific family.” Evelyn paused, her arms tightening around Harry and looking Petunia in her eyes. “All a child needs is love. Because that’s where this magic comes from. Love, given unconditionally, without bargains.”</p>
<p>Petunia couldn’t speak. This boy- this child. She had already failed him from the start.</p>
<p>Dumbledore looked down, almost ashamed. “Miss Potter, are you asking to be Harry’s guardian?”, he said gently.</p>
<p>Evelyn stood up, a fierce look in her eyes. “I am telling you, that I am taking Harry. That I am taking him away from this woman, from this wretched illusion of a home”. She walked up to Petunia, towering over her. “Who would allow a child to sleep in a cupboard?” She looked down at Petunia, her eyes flashing. “A sham of a person. I don’t think you could be really considered a person”, she said softly.</p>
<p>Dumbledore sighed, pulling a hand over his face. “I really shouldn’t have any sort of hesitation in this matter. However, I cannot, in good conscious, hand guardianship to you, Miss Potter”.</p>
<p>Evelyn turned around, her grip on Harry tightening, as if she was afraid Dumbledore would take him away. “What on earth are you say? That I would be worse then-then- then these /people/? These monsters can’t even care for a child for more then a day without locking him away like a dark secret! Harry shouldn’t have to live with these people, especially when they don’t know how special he is!” Evelyn’s voice barely stayed above a whisper this whole time.</p>
<p>“Even so, Miss Potter. We cannot deny the centuries of writing on this subject”, said Dumbledore sadly.</p>
<p>“Even so? Even so? What did I do, just now, explaining to you exactly why we believe these things? They have no basis in fact, beyond what is written!” Evelyn barely controlled herself this time, her voice nearly slipping several times.</p>
<p>Petunia was silent this entire time. However, she finally spoke up.</p>
<p>“She’s right. We aren’t fit to care fort the boy”, Petunia said quietly. Evelyn stepped back and looked at Petunia triumphantly.</p>
<p>“See? Even she agrees with me, and she doesn’t even know the full magic and theory behind it!”</p>
<p>Dumbledore looked troubled. “Even so. Harry’s safety is paramount. I cannot deny what is known.”</p>
<p>“What is /thought/ to be known. Professor! There isn’t evidence to the contrary, that the child couldn’t be placed with the father’s family, or even an entirely separate family!”</p>
<p>He shook his head. “Miss Potter, we must look at what we know. We cannot go by what we do not know.”</p>
<p>Evelyn drew her wand and flicked it at Vernon’s chair. It shook and turned in to a bassinet, complete with a mobile of the solar system. She placed Harry in it carefully. After doing so, she turned around. Petunia noted that she kept her wand in her grip.</p>
<p>“What we know? What we know? What we know is that based on scraps of gossips, rumor, and here say, we should place a child with a family who may not even love them! This ridiculous pattern of keeping to tradition has only failed our people time after time. Did we not just end a war based on the ideology and bigotry of those who wished to keep to tradition?”, she spat out. She gripped her wand tighter. She took a deep breath and continued. “Anyways, how are they supposed to keep him safe?”</p>
<p>Dumbledore opened his mouth to answer, but Petunia’s worst nightmares came to life when a sound came from upstairs. /Vernon! / Petunia remembered with a start.</p>
<p>Petunia felt like she had been frozen when she heard the tell-tale steps of Vernon walk across their room upstairs. She rose up from her seat, her hands out stretched, as if to usher them out of the room. “Out”, she hissed through her teeth. “Vernon cannot know that you’re here.”</p>
<p>Before either of them could answer, Vernon had already trudged downstairs. “Petunia? Are you alright dear? You haven’t come back to bed so I- “</p>
<p>Vernon had reached the bottom of the steps when he noticed the unusual state of his sitting room. His favorite chair had been replaced by a baby’s bassinet, there was a strange woman holding a stick at another strange man, and his wife was attempting to shove them out of the room.</p>
<p>“Petunia? What on earth- “, he sputtered before a spell from Evelyn shot at his mouth. Vernon suddenly found himself unable to make any sound.</p>
<p>“I’m not in any mood to deal with idiots today, especially ones who advocate for the abuse of children” said Evelyn darkly. Petunia could have sworn that Dumbledore looked a touch embarrassed. Evelyn strode forward, getting face to face to Vernon. “I heard about you, from Lily. She thought that Petunia getting married to you was a mistake. She could tell that you were mean, and shallow, and small minded. I guess, by the treatment of my nephew, that she was right”, she said softly. Petunia could barely hear her. Vernon was slowly turning more and more purple. Petunia was afraid that he would pass out.</p>
<p>Evelyn turned away from him, running a hand through the hair on the top of her head, neatening it up again. She huffed out a breath. “I can see that there’s no convincing you, Dumbledore”, she sighed. Her eyes narrowed suddenly, as if she had just come on a thought. “If I could find evidence that this spell doesn’t require shelter by the mother’s family, or some sort of loophole, that would let me take care of Harry, would you let me take care of him?”, she asked.</p>
<p>“Of course, Miss Potter”, agreed Dumbledore.</p>
<p>“Wait. Do you not want the boy?”, asked Petunia.</p>
<p>“Don’t be stupid, Petunia. I want him more then anything. However, if you’ve been paying attention, you’d know that this magic doesn’t have enough background for me to safely take him. I will come for Harry, I promise you that. You just need to take care of him until I can be sure that I can take him away safely”, said Evelyn. Petunia could see that Evelyn’s eyes looked determined. For a moment, Petunia suddenly felt like she was talking to her sister, not a stranger.</p>
<p>Out of the corner of her eye, she saw Dumbledore flick a wand at Vernon. Suddenly, Vernon could speak again.</p>
<p>“Now wait a ruddy minute! You lot just dump that child- that unnatural creature on our doorstep with out as much as a say! We will not be taking this boy in for another minute more. Take him out!” ranted Vernon, his large face reddening.</p>
<p>Petunia froze. She loved Vernon. She truly did. But occasions such as this made Petunia wish he knew to be silent when he needed to be.</p>
<p>Dumbledore reached a hand out to Evelyn, as if to stop her, but he was too late.</p>
<p>Petunia couldn’t be sure as to what happened to Vernon, but where he had stood, a fat toad sat. It jumped at Evelyn, but another flick from Evelyn’s wand froze the frog in mid-air. It squawked mournfully, floating in air.</p>
<p>“Toads are quite useful in potions-making, did you know that?”, said Evelyn softly. She prodded the frog, which caused it to swell slightly. “The eyes are useful in migraine reducing, the legs in mobility increasing. Even the gizzards are helpful in indigestion preventing potions.” The fat, swollen toad groaned as she balanced it in the air with her wand.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Petunia realized exactly who it was. “V-VERNON! What have you done to him! Put him back, you foul, loathsome cunt!”, she shrieked. “You walk into my home and turn my furniture into other furniture and turning my husband into a- a- a toad!”</p>
<p>Evelyn snorted rudely. “He’s a horned toad, to be specific. I kept thinking about how I needed to buy more toads. I really meant to just jinx his mouth shut.”</p>
<p>Petunia shook with rage. Before anything else could happen, Dumbledore swept a hand over Vernon the Toad, turning him back with a thump. Vernon sat on the ground, his eyes wild. He began to sputter again, attempting to get up again. But before he could say anything more, Dumbledore waved another hand over him. His eyes slid shut and he slumped backward. Petunia could hear a gentle snore emitting from his mouth.</p>
<p>“I think, Evelyn, we have intruded on the Dursley’s hospitality long enough. We’ll just set everything back to order and let them sleep. I will take care of Mr. Dursley. Evelyn, could you perhaps set up a space for Harry? I do believe that this house has 4 bedrooms.”</p>
<p>Evelyn nodded. She picked up Harry from the transformed bassinet and tapped it, turning it back into the chair. Dumbledore took out his wand and made a random gesture with it, causing Vernon to float.</p>
<p>“It’s the first bedroom on the right, correct?”</p>
<p>Petunia realized with a jolt that he was addressing her. Petunia nodded, and when she remembered that he was looking away from her, said yes.</p>
<p>Evelyn followed Dumbledore up the stairs, with Petunia trailing behind them. Dumbledore waved the door to Petunia and Vernon’s bedroom open and floated Vernon’s sleeping body through. Evelyn paused, watching Dumbledore. She turned, walking to the left towards the guest bedroom. She opened the door and began to cast spells under her breath. Petunia peeked behind her as Evelyn preformed various charms and incantations. Soon, the sensibly dressed room became a tidy nursery, complete with toys and a bassinette that had a mobile, this time of seven cloaked figures on tiny brooms. In Evelyn’s arms, Harry wriggled and whined. “Oh, darling boy! Did I wake you up?”, cooed Evelyn. “It’s me, your Aunty Evie! I know it’s been a while since your birthday, but I promise you’ll see me much more often now.”</p>
<p>Harry’s bright green eyes fixed on his aunt’s face, and he broke into a sleepy smile. “Hello, love!”, said Evelyn happily.</p>
<p>Evelyn slowly laid Harry down in the blue and white bassinette. With a tap of her wand, the mobile above him began to whirl. He giggled, his tiny fists reaching up to the mobile. Evelyn took out a handkerchief and tapped it, murmuring a spell. It grew, and the colors shifted, turning into a soft dark blue blanket the same color as Evelyn’s robes. Evelyn wrapped it around Harry, stroking his head. “I can’t take you home with me today, but I have a room all ready for you. Its got so many toys for you! I have a dragon plush, and a bear, and a hippogriff! You could sleep with a new toy every night, love.”</p>
<p>Evelyn’s voice became stifled and choked, as if she were trying not to cry. Petunia walked in cautiously. The room looked warm, and soft. A perfect room for a baby boy. For a moment, Petunia felt envy deep in her heart. This room should belong to Dudley, not some stranger’s child, she thought bitterly.</p>
<p>Evelyn stood up, carefully wiping away the tears. She turned to Petunia. “This room is temporary, for Harry. And if you dare to put Harry in that cupboard again, I’ll- well”, she paused, a nasty smile on her face. “You saw what I did to your husband. I can’t promise I wouldn’t be crueler to you.”</p>
<p>Petunia shivered.</p>
<p>“You have a son of your own, don’t you?”, Evelyn continued softly. She trailed a gentle hand on the now sleeping Harry. “I wonder what would have happened if it was you and Vernon instead of my brother and Lily? Would they have put Dudley in a closet, to be forgotten?”</p>
<p>Petunia, not for the first time that night, wished she had fought harder with Vernon.</p>
<p>Evelyn turned away and bent over Harry, giving him a gentle kiss. Petunia could see in the light from the hallway that the scar on Harry’s forehead was apparent again, despite whatever Evelyn had done to it.</p>
<p>Evelyn turned away from Petunia, wiping away tears again. Then, holding her head up high, swept past Petunia into the hallway where Dumbledore stood waiting.</p>
<p>Petunia followed the two down the stairs, into the entryway, and out the door. She stood in the door, watching them as they walked away. Evelyn stopped, turning towards number 4 Privet Drive one last time. “I’ll be back, every weekend. I’ll take him and return him. Until I can fully prove that Harry can be safe with me, I’ll be here every Friday afternoon.”</p>
<p>Petunia nodded mutely, wrapping her robe around her tightly.</p>
<p>She watched the two figures walk into the night, disappearing around the corner. She stood there, not saying anything, not doing anything for some time. Then, she turned around and walked inside her home. The light in the hallway clicked off, and shortly after the light in the upstairs window clicked off as well.</p>
