    <p>The Marauders ran into the house in a panic rush. prong's owl had found them screeching and trying to get them to follow. </p><p>Sirius saw the male body froze, unmoving, it's golden brown eyes lifeless. "PRONGS" he grabbed the body shaking it tears in his eyes. He didn't want to believe, he wanted James to start laughing like it was all a huge joke.</p><p> Remus ran up the stairs freezing, through a crack he could see a body lying on the floor, not moving. Peter right behind him. </p><p>"Oh God. No..." Slowly they opened the door there on the floor was Lily Potter. Remus dropped beside her whimpering. Peter shaking moved to the crib. </p><p>"R-Remus!" He whimpered noticing the crib was empty. Someone had taken Sirius's godson. Remus moved to him looking in. They heard a noise outside. </p><p>"Peter we need to hide."</p><p>"No, you two leave I will stay." Peter turned into Wormtail hiding under the bed. Sirius ran up he nearly screamed when he saw Lily. Remus grabbed him apparating away quickly. </p><p>Peter himself had stayed waiting for whoever it was to come in. Then he heard an old familiar male voice.</p><p>"So it's true. Poor James. " He walked upstairs slowly coming to the room. Peter moved to see who. Dumbledore. He didn't seem sad or upset at all. </p><p>He seems to be checking, erasing spells from the place “If only you two gave him to be the first time...maybe you would have stayed alive.” he chuckled before leaving himself. </p><p>Peter waited for him to leave before running out the door. When he got far enough away before apparating.</p><p>"Wormtail?" Sirius asked, "did you find anything?" Peter muttered Dumbledore's name before pacing.</p><p>"Dumbledore has Harry! Where could he had taken him?!” Sirius turned to Remus who was brainstorming. There was a sound of light squeaks and chattering came from the window of Remus's small cottage. They see the bat opening the window. Once it was inside, it changes to a familiar dark-haired Slytherin professor to be. </p><p>"Wings! Wait why are you here?"</p><p>"To warm you. Sirius, your being framed as the murder." He stated</p><p>"Did you know?" Peter asked his voice held no anger.</p><p>"No. Marvolo suspects Dumbledore may have noticed my….more friendly chats with James...is Lily dead too?"</p><p>"Yes. All that's left is Harry. We need to get him but we don't know where he is." Severus' eyes widened at that. Thinking about it deeply where could they take the boy the only other family he has is a muggle family.</p><p>"Padfoot with me. If we hurry we can get him before whatever wards they could possibly use and whatever guard they wanna set up is set." Severus gestured to Sirius to transform taking a sting from his own hair he transfigured collar. Before they teleported both him and Sirius to the opposite end of the lane hiding behind a house he looked down. Sure enough no lights he couldn't see. But he could hear someone talking in the distance. He waited it felt like forever when Sirius stolen bike was crashing and whining under the large half-giant he felt Padfoot flinch. </p><p>"It's just a bike." He whispered the dog glared at him. They watched as they put Harry on the doorstep once they finished and were gone Severus swooped his robes billowing as he rushed in. The wards weren't up yet, Padfoot on his heels as he picked the boy up running back. He felt the outwards set up. They barely made it running quite a bit. </p><p>"Where are we going?! How did you know where to go?? How did you know they were going to have him here!?" Sirius turned from Padfoot completely lost they made their way up to a single tree on a hill. </p><p>"LUCIUS!!" Severus screamed at the tree. A minute later the tree glowed gold he shoved Sirius through before going himself. They were at Malfoy Manor. </p><p>“Answer me!!”Sirius snapped as Severus shoved him through the tree. He lost his footing falling on top the white marble floors looking at a very cranky and very worried. </p><p>"Severus, what's going on?" Lucius eyed his cousin in law, Sirius looked confused.</p><p>“He's not going to answer. I have been asking questions since we got Harry.” Sirius growled getting up. “Can I at least have my godson?” Severus carefully handed the baby to Sirius who calmed down. </p><p>“Now explain my questions so we can get out of here.”</p><p>“Leaving is the last thing you want to do.”Severus snapped glaring at Sirius.</p><p> “What is going on?!” Lucius hissed “I woke up to open a childhood portal. I never thought I would have to open again.”</p><p>“Lily Elenore Potter nee Evans and James Fleamont potter are dead.” The glass hit the floor making all three men lookup. Marvolo’s red eyes glaring down. </p><p>“What,” he whispered walking down as Narcissa came out of where she was hiding, her eyes widen.</p><p>“Narcissa? What are you doing up love?” Lucius noticed his wife</p><p>“You jerked when you woke.” there was a cry in a room next to her she quickly moved in coming back out with Draco as Severus sighed.</p><p>“All I know is I overheard some Order of Phoenix members saying they were going to blame Sirius with the death of Lily and James Potter. To answer your questions Sirius, if you don’t remember I AM ...was Lily’s childhood friend, we would meet at that tree eventually Petunia started following us around bullying us. We linked the tree to Lucius front door to getaway ...Abraxas had always thought Lily was my cousin and half-blood with how powerful she was. There was never any doubt and we were very careful. Whoever killed them had to be a friend they wouldn't have died otherwise."</p><p>“James ...his wand was in the front room...I didn't see Lily’s….. Who would want to harm them.”<br/>
Panic entered Lucius face once more. “Remus? Peter?” </p><p>“There at Mauradur Cottage,” Sirius whispered as Lucius looked to him then back.</p><p>“Sirius call the other two here to the manor.” Lucius had turned back to the Black with a new fit of anger.</p><p>“Why they're fine there.” </p><p>“No, they're not! My manor is far more protected than that shack you call home.”</p><p>“Excuse you!? Mauradur Cottage was made to withhold the worst of the worse!” </p><p>“Yeah if Lockhart was the Light leader!” Lucius snapped. “Call them here now! If we don't know why they are attacking James and Lily likely that you could be next!” </p><p>“They are trying to frame you! Sirius with their deaths as is. I still don't know why they're doing it I will have to figure that out next time I'm at Hogwarts.” </p><p>Narcissa had put Draco back to bed coming down she took Harry. “Call them. Sirius Orin Black if you try to bicker with me I will wake my sister. Do you want to Fight Bella?” she watched his face pale. “I'm going to put Harry with Draco and stay with them. Get them over here.” she walked back, stopping by Marvolo who checked Harry over. </p><p>“Marking curse?” he noticed the bolt. “We need to see if we can get rid of that.” </p><p>“Tomorrow there's far too much for one night.” she carried the baby upsetting him next to her son who moved a hand to the others. They didn't grab at each other in their sleep but they felt the others Presences as Narcissa guessed back down to make sure her cousin listened to her. When she noticed the Werewolf bow to her she bowed back. </p><p>“Fenrir will be here tomorrow to warn you.”</p><p>“Thank you…..I can't avoid him forever…” </p><p>“Yes, you can we can run with Harry.”</p><p>“Sirius.”</p><p>“Or we could kill Fenrir us three against him”</p><p>“Peter, please. Both of you stop it. Sides I'm sure not many here would be two fawned of us killing him.”</p><p>“I would be angry with that” Marvolo glared. “I happen to like my Were-wolves alive. Even if they avoid each other.”</p><p>“Thank you, my lord.” Remus smiled “Good to know I won't be puppy chow if Fenrir gets angry with me.” </p><p>“Off to bed everyone,” Marvolo ordered turning to Severus. “If you have to leave I understand just go to bed wherever you're staying.”</p><p>“Yes my lord. I have to go back to Hogwarts. Before the idiots realize I'm not there. Lucius may I use your office fireplace I could say I was coming to see Narcissa and Draco while you were busy.” </p><p>“Of course.” Lucius nodded before going to fetch his wife. </p><p>“The children are fine love let us go to sleep,” Lucius whispered as she petted both boys heads gently. </p><p>“They ...there is so much they won't get now.” Narcissa eyed Harry one last time before charming a music box to play as they leave.</p><p>“I know.” Lucius took her hand smiling. “We will have to help them raise him. I know James would want that. We will give them a place to hide.”</p><p>“A stable place. Of course, the first four years will definitely need it.”</p><p>Morning came far to slow for Sirius, Remus had charmed the door not to open for him or Peter. </p><p>“Sunrise. Moony wake up let us out” Peter poked the wolves face. Moony groaned hiding his face. </p><p>“Five more minutes.”</p><p>“No, you said morning Moony” Sirius turned into Padfoot scratching at the door lightly.</p><p>“Guys please did you even sleep?” </p><p>“I did I don't know about Sirius.” </p><p>“Sirius” Remus looked to Padfoot who stared at the door, ignoring the question.</p><p>“Take it as a no.” Remus got up showering and shaving.</p>
