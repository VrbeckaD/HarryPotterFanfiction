    <p>The rest of the summer was spent looking into the books they had. Harry read through the entire journal he had found over Christmas break, but there was nothing more of use. The Malfoy Library held no help in destroying the horcruxes. They could easily hit each with the sword of Gryffindor, but again Harry did not want to destroy the artifacts. So the boys went into third year with two things in mind. One, find a means of destroying the horcruxes and two, find the last one that wasn’t Nagini.</p><p>Of course Harry also knew he needed to go to the room of requirement to receive his inheritance, which he hadn’t told Draco about, he had just shown him the book. And he also had to take Luna to the Centaurs to hopefully learn from them.</p><p>The sorting hat sang its usual song before sorting the students into their houses. Once again the tables were back to four long house tables. Dumbledore made his usual speech, with a slight twist.</p><p>“Students a quick announcement” he began “Gilderoy has decided that he would rather another adventure and did not come back to teach Defense this year.” A chorus of groans from the girls rang through the hall. “But, due to a smashing success with dueling club I have offered Professor Snape the DADA position”</p><p>Silence descended upon the hall until someone broke it with “but what about potions?”</p><p>“Ten points to slytherin” Dumbledore said. “Potions will be taught by Professor Slughorn, he came out of retirement this year.”</p><p>Draco looked up to see a slightly pudgy man with a large mustache. The man had a glint in his eyes that Draco did not like, and when he followed his gaze he saw the man’s attention was focused on Harry.</p><p>The students were led back to their common rooms and Draco followed Harry up to the Potter suites.</p><p>“You’ll need to watch out for Slughorn. He was staring at you.” As soon as he said this a letter appeared under the door.</p><p>
  <em>Mr. Potter</em>
</p><p>
  <em>You are invited to lunch in Professor Slughorns office tomorrow.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>-H.S.</em>
</p><p>“Why would he invite me to lunch?” Harry asked.</p><p>“I don’t know. But I’m coming with you.”</p><p>“You probably have one as well, in your suites.”</p><p>Draco contemplated that for a second. “Can I borrow your cloak?” Harry nodded. Draco slipped out the door, under the cloak to run to his room. He opened the door to his suites and found the same letter Harry had received but addressed to him. He walked quickly back up to the Potter suites and found Harry sitting as his desk. “What are you doing?”</p><p>Harry showed him a note to Sirius and Draco placed his note from “H.S.” next to Harry’s on the desk.</p><p>“Told you” Harry said. “You’re far better at potions than me. I’m sure that’s why he contacted us.”</p><p>Indeed, Draco was better at potions than Harry. It was the only class that he had beat him in. The marks hung on the Library wall, both boys received them and Lucius was slightly miffed that Harry had beaten Draco in nearly every class. The Ravenclaws had also stepped up their game.</p><p>Arithmetic<br/> 1. Potter, Harry<br/> 2. Malfoy, Draco<br/> 3. Boot, Terry<br/> 4. Brocklehurst, Mandy<br/> 5.

We have classes tomorrow.”</p><p>Harry nodded but tied the note he had written to Hedwigs leg before getting ready for bed.</p><p align="center">oOo</p><p>The next day the boys attended there morning classes before heading to Professor Slughorns office for lunch.</p><p>“Mr. Potter! Mr. Malfoy. Welcome. Welcome. We’re just waiting on a few more.” Professor Slughorn said.</p><p>The boys sat at the round table. A few minutes later they saw Blaise enter, as well as Cormac McLaggen, Ginny Weasley and another girl they didn’t know.</p><p>“So students. Welcome. You see I have a special group of students who I take in each year that are exceedingly gifted. I like to build a rapport with these students so they may get the best jobs when they graduate.” Slughorn expressed. Draco was weirded out by the whole situation, when he glanced at Blaise it seemed he didn’t like it either. “I used to start this club with the older years, but I figured why not start younger?” Slughorns gaze landed on Harry.</p><p>“Let’s start with Blaise, how’s your mother?”</p><p>“She’s well sir.”</p><p>“Cormac, how is your Uncle Tiberius.”</p><p>“Good. He was just out hunting with the minister last weekend”</p><p>“Ginny. I saw you perform the Bat Bogey hex, quite remarkable for someone your age.”</p><p>“Thank you sir.”</p><p>“Melinda, how are the family apothecaries?”</p><p>“Good sir, my father wants me to take over when I graduate.”</p><p>“That’s great my dear! Draco, how is your father?</p><p>“He’s fine. Working his way up in the Ministry.”</p><p>“Harry Potter. The top student in each class but potions last year. Quite good.”</p><p>“Thank you sir.”</p><p>“I’ve heard rumors of a prophecy about you, have you heard it?”</p><p>“No Sir.”</p><p>“Are you sure, it’s quite important. You’re the one to defeat the dark lord.”</p><p>“The Dark lord was already defeated sir.”</p><p>“I heard rumors of him coming back your first year.”</p><p>“The prophet does love to spread rumors” Draco drawled.</p><p>“Yes, especially about the boy who lived.” Blaise spoke up.</p><p>“Him arriving at Hogwarts was big news you know?” Ginny asked. “He’s also extremely gifted at defense.”</p><p>“Yes, even Snape barely beat him.” Draco spoke up again.</p><p>“Gilderoy even tried to cheat in their duel.” Blaise said.</p><p>“Oh, and he’s learned the Patronus charm!” Draco said with about as much excitement as a Malfoy could muster.</p><p>Slughorns eyebrows were practically in his hairline. “Is that true Harry?”</p><p>“Yes Sir.” Harry said as he blushed.</p><p>“How about you show us? I’ve never heard of someone mastering the spell before third year!”</p><p>Harry quickly cast a patronus “For Luna Lovegood. Ginny is with Draco, Blaise, and me please have Vincent or Greg walk you to class.” The stag ran off.</p><p>Slughorn started to clap and raised from his seat. He clapped Harry on the shoulder, Harry flinched. While he was getting better about people touching him only close family and friends could do so without the flinching. “Well done my boy. You know your mother was in this club as well?”</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>“Yes, she was quite talented that one. Had the most beautiful spellwork.”</p><p>“Was Severus?” Draco asked quickly.</p><p>“Was Severus what Draco?”</p><p>“In the slug club?”</p><p>“No. Severus was a shy child. He didn’t have many friends.”</p><p>Harry didn’t understand why Severus wouldn’t have been in the club, and why him not having friends mattered.</p><p>“Well I’ll let you all be on your way. It’s about time for your next class as Harry said.”</p><p align="center">oOo</p><p>At the end of the day when Draco and Harry were getting ready for bed Draco noticed Harry was contemplative. “What’s wrong?” He asked.</p><p>“I just don’t understand why Severus wouldn’t be in the club.”</p><p>“Maybe we can ask him?”</p><p>Harry cast a patronus again, he was starting to get tired, and finding a happy memory was tougher today for some reason. “For Severus Snape. Professor, are you available for a question on our potions essay?”</p><p>A moment later a doe came back. “Mr. Potter. I am not available at your beck and call. I do have ten minutes, but curfew is coming up.”</p><p>Harry took that to mean yes, and Draco and he quickly ran to Snapes office. “Enter” came from inside.</p><p>“Severus!” Harry greeted.</p><p>“Harry, Draco. To what do I owe this pleasure?”</p><p>“Slughorn invited us to lunch in his office, something called the Slug Club. Harry couldn’t understand why you weren’t in it.” Draco said.</p><p>“He usually doesn’t have that until fifth year.” Severus said.</p><p>“Yes, he said he was starting early. Said my mother was in the club. Why weren’t you?” Harry asked.</p><p>“Well. Slughorn likes to collect people. People who are famous or influential, or particularly gifted. Your mother was gifted in potions and charms.” Severus said.</p><p>“And you are gifted in potions.”</p><p>“Well yes. But I was not well-liked. Your mother, everyone liked her. She was beautiful and smart. Me…I was shy and everyone hated me, especially the marauders.”</p><p>“Well that’s not right.” Harry said.</p><p>“Watch out for Slughorn Harry. He plays favorites, not the best professor.”</p><p>“Thank you Severus.”</p><p>The boys returned to their room.</p><p>“Hey Harry.”</p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>“Have you seen Greg?”</p><p>“Yeah, why?”</p><p>“Does he look different to you?”</p><p>Harry just smiled, then jumped into bed.</p>
