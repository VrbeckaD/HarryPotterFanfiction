    <p>Why does this always happen? Why does he get blamed for things that were not his fault? James Sirius Potter sighed as he looked out his window watching the rain fall down from the sky. James sighed and looked to the door when he heard a knock. “James can I come in?” it was the voice of his older Godbrother, Edward “Teddy” Remus Lupin. James sighed once again and nodded</p>
<p>“Yeah, you can come in Ted,” James said with sadness in his voice. James was alone in his room because he felt bad for his younger brother who was in the hospital at this moment after he fell off his broom. The reason James was not there was that he was scared to see him. He knows also this his father yelled at him for pushing him. James did not mean to push him off the broom. The young wizard sighed and looked at his Godbrother with tears in his eyes. “It’s my fault, Ted,” James said wiping the tears from his eyes. Teddy sighed and looked out the window.</p>
<p>“No, it’s not James,” the older wizard said as he sat down at James’s desk and ran a hand through his blue hair. “James,” Teddy sighed when James shook his head and closed his eyes. James then opened his eyes and slowly got to his feet and walked out of his room with a bag around his shoulder. Seeing this Teddy followed his Godbrother out of the room and watched as James walked to the front door.</p>
<p>“Good-bye Teddy. I just don’t want to be here when dad gets back. So, can you tell him, mum, Lily, Al and everyone in the family that I’m sorry,” with that Teddy watched as James left the house.</p>
<p>“Wait, James!” Teddy called and ran after him. “Merlin,” Teddy breathed as he walked outside with his wand out. “James! James Sirius were the hell are you!?” Teddy called as he started to walk down the wet road.</p>
<p>         It did not take long for Teddy to find James for he did not go too far. “James!” Teddy called when he saw his Godbrother sitting on a rock with a time turner in one hand and a note in the other. “James,” Teddy said gently as he walked over to him. However, James did not look up. This made the Hufflepuff sigh and walk over to him with his hair turning to his father’s shade of sandy brown. Teddy knew that he should have gotten his father, but he knows that he can handle this himself.</p>
<p>“Why are you here?” James asked looking up from the Time-Turner. Teddy sighed and sat down next to him on the rock.</p>
<p>“I don’t think that this is your fault, James. Your dad’s not mad at you. he will be mad when he finds out that you went into his office and stole his Time-Turner,” James sighed and looked at Teddy after he said this and nodded slowly.</p>
<p>“Are you sure?” James asked looking down at the note. Teddy gave him a warm smile and looked at him with his amber eyes. James smiled and stood up. However, as he stood he dropped the Time-Turner and it fell the forest floor.</p>
<p>“James!” Teddy called as the world around them began to spin.</p>
<p>              James was the first to wake but Teddy, Teddy was nocked out and James knew that this was his fault. Everything was his fault. James sighed and looked around him. He was no were near his house. That’s to be expected. He did just run away from home. However, this place seemed different. James let out a breath but froze when he heard a voice. “I’m going to beat you Padfoot,” James smiled at the voice, but he did not recognize it. He thought he did not, yet he did not. He did however heard the name Padfoot before. That was the name that his dad his aunts and uncles call Sirius. Heck, even Teddy calls him that sometimes. How come he be hearing a voice that he has never heard before say the name of his father’s Godfather? James sighed and looked over to Teddy who was still nocked out.</p>
<p>“Teddy?” James asked with worry dripping from his voice, but Teddy did not wake as he saw two boys around the same age as Teddy maybe a little older run over to James.</p>
<p>“Who are you?” a boy that looked just like Sirius, but much younger demanded. James raised an eyebrow and stood up carefully, but he did not say anything as Teddy opened his eyes slowly.</p>
<p>“James?” Teddy asked once he opened his eyes and stared at the two boys. “Oh, no,” Teddy whispered with annoyance. “Great,” Teddy added as he looked at his Godbrother as he stood. “Hello,” Teddy said looking at the younger Sirius and James senior. Teddy sighed knowing that he and James must have time traveled. “James Sirius Potter!” Teddy yelled as his hair turned a bright red and his eyes turned a deep dark amber. “Look what you did now we are,”</p>
<p>“Me! Me! You should not have followed me! How will I ever see Al or dad or anyone?” James yelled at Teddy while James and Sirius stared at the two.</p>
<p>“Who are you?” Sirius asked pointing his wand at Teddy who also had his wand out, but it was aimed at James Sirius.</p>
<p>“Well, this is going to be fun,” muttered James Sirius to Teddy who rolled his eyes. </p>
