    <p>My childhood was dark. It taught me that this world is full of darkness.</p><p>Cruelty.</p><hr/><p>
  <em>"What do you think you're doing, boy!" In furious strides, the man walked up to the cowering boy.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"I'm sorry. Uncle Vernon, I'm sorry!"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"You ungrateful brat!" Grabbing the collar of the whimpering boy's shirt, Vernon threw the sobbing boy to the other side of the room. Harry skidded along the tile floor and crashed into the wall. While Harry crumpled in pain, Vernon was already looming over the boy. With unfiltered malice, Vernon lifted his leg and stomped. Harry produced a muffled cry. Enraged, Vernon screamed, "How dare you!"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"I'm-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Uncle Vernon," Harry cried, eventually biting his lower lips so his cries wouldn't offend his uncle anymore.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Who said you could make dessert! No one! Were you planning to make something no one would eat so you could enjoy it yourself later, boy!" Vernon accused. "Wasting our food, our money! You're just a bastard son of a whore. Just do what you're told, boy. You are a useless waste of space. We let you into our house, eat our food, waste our money, and what do we get?! You are to go to your room. NOW!"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Yes, Uncle Vernon. Yes, sir. Yes. I'll go right away," Harry whimpered dutifully. He tried to stand up but fell as pain shot through his body. Growling, Vernon kicked the crumpled boy for his failure before grabbing him by the back of his neck. He walked to Harry's room, dragging Harry along. With Vernon's tight grip along Harry's slim neck, Harry began to see stars, struggling to breathe. Vernon opened the door and dropped the boy before kicking him into the room. Dust fell from the ceiling of the boy's room as Vernon slammed the door closed and locked Harry in. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>The boy wheezed in pain as he pondered on what went wrong. He just wanted to be praised. He had hoped that his gesture was thoughtful. He just wanted...</em>
</p><p>
  <em>A family.</em>
</p><hr/><p>It was full of people who cared only for themselves, willing to do anything that'll allow their desire to be fulfilled.</p><hr/><p>
  <em>"Uncle Vernon?" </em>
</p><p>
  <em>"It's alright, boy. I'm not mad."</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Really?"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"No. As long as you'll listen to me, I won't be mad."</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"I-I'll be a good boy. I promise, Uncle Vernon. I'll listen."</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Uncle Vernon chuckled," I'm sure you will... Now take off your shirt for me. We should change it."</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Okay!" Harry slipped the shirt off.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"What a good boy you are!" Vernon praised.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>With the long desired praise, Harry beamed. He finally could be a part of the family. If he stayed good, he could have a family.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Oh, Harry," Vernon sighed. Vernon gently embraced the boy and lifted the boy to his lap. Caressing Harry's face, Vernon said," You are such a beautiful boy when you're good. Give Uncle Vernon a kiss."</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Harry blushed at the sweet compliment and promptly kissed his Uncle's cheek.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"No, no , no!" Vernon spat angrily. "That's not how you kiss someone! To think that I thought such an ungrateful brat was a good boy"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Harry gasped, rapidly paling.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"I'm sorry, Uncle Vernon! Forgive me. I didn't know how to kiss you. I want to be a good boy. Please, Uncle Vernon. I'll be a good boy. Please," Harry begged. His uncle was silent for a few minutes.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Fine. I'll teach you how a normal kiss is done. What you gave me is a polite kiss, a mere peck that is done in company but never in private. Such a kiss in private is rude, as if the person was genuinely not appreciated in full extent. Conversely, a kiss that is done in private should never be done in company. It is considered disrespectful and vulgar." Harry nodded furiously as his uncle recited the proper etiquette of kissing. "Now, there are multiple kisses. The kiss that I expected would be an exchange of lips, the simplest form of private affection. A step further would be an exchange of saliva. In this exchange, dominance plays a role as people may fight or submit to the kiss. Fighting throughout the exchange would indicate that they are partners and equal if both are fighting or the dominant figure if there is only one partner fighting. Fighting and then submitting throughout the exchange would indicate that the partner only gives way to the other because of his adoration or respect. Fully submitting throughout the exchange would indicate that the partner has no doubt of the other's superiority and fully adores or respects his or her partner. Now, in our relationship, the step further would be the second or third option for you. As the child, you are the submitting party. As the guardian figure and therefore dominant figure, I am the fighting figure."</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Oh... Uncle?"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Yes, Harry."</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"How do you do an exchange of saliva?"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Vernon smiled and said," I'll show you." Bringing the boy's lips to his, Vernon pecked before licking Harry's lips.`</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Don't fight. I'm really upset with you with your earlier behavior. Just follow along with what I do to you. Only gentle responses to what I do, okay?" Vernon breathes out as he pries open Harry's lips with his tongue.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Harry hummed in agreement and opened his mouth to Vernon's ministrations. Uncle Vernon was exploring Harry's mouth with his warm tongue. It was weird as the bumpy surface of the tongue teased Harry's tongue. Every movement of the muscle was clearly felt in Harry's mouth. No wonder it was considered an attack. The submitting party would feel so vulnerable and sensitive with the invading muscle. Uncle Vernon hummed happily. This must be the exchange! But Harry needed to reply. Following along to Uncle Vernon's fighting and a weaker version of Uncle Vernon's kiss. Harry moved his tongue with Uncle Vernon's and gave way to Uncle Vernon's tongue, gently teasing it. Uncle Vernon pulled away, clearly happy with the kiss. Harry was gasping for breathe, eyes tearing up slightly.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The watery eyes with the breathlessness made the boy look wanton. Vernon felt his lower half arousing and wanting more. Smirking, he said," That was a good kiss. You clearly have the ability to be a good boy."</em>
</p><p>
  <em>With that, Harry perked up. "Really?!" Harry exclaimed in a breathy voice. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Oh, yes. You showed your adoration and respect for me with your kiss wonderfully. If only you did such a good job first..."</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"I'm sorry! I didn't know. But there must be more kisses, right? You said that there were many. You only gave two exchanges with what I should do in such a kiss. There must be more where I can show how much I feel for you!" Harry pleaded. He didn't want his uncle to be upset with him anymore. If he could make his uncle happy, Harry would do anything. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Falling right into the trap.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Well, there are kisses that worship your partner's body but those are generally done with people that you are intimate with, that you love dearly. Simple pecks show how much you feel for the person. An imprint of the kiss is used to show your ownership of your partner, to show that you don't want to share your partner with others in such an intimate way. A bite mark is used to remind the partner of their intimacy and love so that the partner won't act too intimately with others. This is generally used as a punishment since it is rather painful. However, this is a love that is arose from jealousy. There are kisses to the partner's intimate parts. Now this is only reserved for the most intimate relationships."</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"I want to show how much of a good boy I am! I love uncle so much. Please, I want to show it."</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"What a good boy you are! Now..."</em>
</p><hr/><p>I never understood the wrongness of these exchanges. At that time, I was blind. I only saw one of my desires coming true and reached for it. I didn't realize that my uncle was making one of his own desires come true. I didn't think. I didn't know.</p><p>I realize it now only because I found my true family.</p><hr/><p>
  <em>It was a beautiful day. I was shoved out of the house because Aunt Petunia was having a tea party with some neighbors. She said that she didn't need my help. She didn't need me. She always hates me. I felt sad, lonely. Recently, Uncle Vernon has been avoiding private shows of affection. Maybe, he's been too busy. He has a lot of work, and he works hard.Â But, neither Aunt Petunia nor Dudley ever wanted to have a private show of affection. Only Uncle Vernon would kiss me. Only Uncle Vernon would show me love. Tears welled up in my eyes. Frustrated, I rubbed them away and ran to the park. It was fine to go to the park today. There was a very low chance of Harry Hunting today. Dudley and his friends were at Pier's place playing that new video game that Dudley got from his shopping trip with Aunt Petunia yesterday.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>It wasn't fair. I'm a good boy. Uncle Vernon said so. So why doesn't Aunt Petunia like me? I do well in class and homework and fail my tests, and I do that just for Dudley. I do his homework so that he has more time to play. I help him cheat on tests. I do all of that without Dudley even knowing about it. I do all of that so that Aunt Petunia's precious boy could be happy and proud. So what should I do? What could make them like me? I reached the park and headed toward the swings. I do my best thinking on swings. After plopping onto the seat, I begin swinging. The warm air cools as the wind rushes to my face. The sky gets closer as I swing higher and higher, tears starting to fall. When I swung so high that I slipped off the seat, I had a thought.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>What if I found a new family, a better family?</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Then, I fell. It was different than usual. By the time I reached the ground, I had an urge to throw up, and I did.Â I sicked onto the vibrant green grass. Grass? Where were the wooden chips? Did I roll after I fell? I raised my eyes cautiously and didn't see the park. I saw a grand castle. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Where am I? That was the question. This was no place that I have ever been to before. I need to get home soon. If Uncle Vernon gets home before I do, he might think that I became a ungrateful brat again. The castle looked well maintained. The garden was absolutely stunning and vast. There needs to be someone who tended to this property. I decisively walked to the castle. There could be a person who can tell me where I am and help get back home. Uncle Vernon wouldn't be happy with this freakish accident but I could make him forgive me. He always does whenever we have a private show of affection to show my adoration and respect.Â </em>
</p><p>
  <em>I heard a sharp pop and found a deformed, dwarfish person.Â </em>
</p><p>
  <em>"How did you get in?Â  No unauthorizedÂ visitorsÂ allowed.The ancient wards must be malfunctioning," the person said with a squeaky voice.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"I apologize, sir. I don't know how I got onto this property myself. I would like to know where I am so that I may go home," I politely reply. Poor man must be confused. AccidentallyÂ saying wards instead of walls.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Well, the master would be wanting to see you. Please come with me," the person requested.<br/></em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Thank you."</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Harry followed the deformed, dwarfish person through gardens and hallways, making many turns and climbing a few stairs. Every place we passed was opulently decorated. The absolute wealth was near blinding. I was dizzy and barely following the person. The person stopped at a door.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"This be the study of the master. He'll see you in." The person knocked on the door and left with a pop. I must be hallucinating. The person disappeared in thin air.Â </em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Come in," an authoritative voice instructed. I opened the door. This place was beginningÂ to scare me. The study is absolutely beautiful, just like all the other places I passed. The walls on the side are covered with books. The center of the room has black leather coaches with finely embroidered pillows. The table between the coaches looks intricately carved. It looks impossibly smooth and has a stunning glossy layer. By the end of the room, there is an office-like set-up. There was the man that spoke earlier. His skin was smooth and pale. Sharp cheekbones and aquiline nose declare his status of nobility. His grey eyes glare in disdainÂ before he speaks.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"What were you doing on my property?" He drawled.Â </em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Sir, I apologize for this. I strangely found myself here after I was playing," I reported. Despite my fears and worries, I must not act like an ungrateful brat, though fiddling with my bangs betrayed my inner thoughts.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"That scar!"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Oh, this? I got this in a vehicle accident. Both my parents died so I'm staying with my mother's relatives now. I really need to get back. They'll be furious if I'm not back in time for supper."</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Is your name Harry Potter by any chance?"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"... how did you know?"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Vehicle accident... With that mudblood's family? What atrocity! The absolute gall of that wretched man," The man muttered.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Excuse me, sir. May you tell me where I am?" I pleaded. I really needed to get back, and the man was clearly mad.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The man turned to me and asked," Well? Where are you from?"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Oh! 4 Privet Drive, Little Whinging."</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"There is no Little Whining nearby here. This manor is in Wiltshire. Where is Little Whining?"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"In Surrey," Harry mumbled.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Well, Surrey is an eight hour ride from Wiltshire."</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Eight? Shouldn'tÂ it be an hour and a half."</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Ugh, by muggle contraptions? Well, the Knight Bus can get you there fairly soon. However, you were raised by muggles." The man shuddered. "The horror. You poor child. Why don't you stay with us, with my family?"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>A new family? A crazy family, but a new one?</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"I'm sure we'll treat you better than any muggle could," the man declared.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Yes," Harry breathed out.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Excuse me? What did you say?"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"'It is most gracious and kind to let me stay, sir. Thank you," Harry proclaimed. With that, Harry went up to the man and pecked his lips. The man was confused and shocked at this behavior but quickly collected himself.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Where did you pick up this behavior?"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"My uncle says that this is proper etiquette for private shows of affection. A peck on the cheek is polite for thanks in public, but a peck on the lips is more appropriate for private. I could do an exchange of saliva with you. Other shows of affection are supposed to beÂ for those you love dearly, intimate relationships. Did you want an exchange of saliva? You should have begun fighting if you wanted it," I explained.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Harry. I'm not clear on these private shows of affection. Could you please explain them to me?"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Well, the further ones include kissing other people's intimate parts and those intimate parts kissing," Harry blushed. "I'm only explaining it to you since we're having a private conversation. Uncle Vernon says this may never be talked about in public. It's rude and vulgar."</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Just out of curiosity, did you have such an intimate relationship with this Uncle Vernon?"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Why of course! Uncle Vernon loves me so very much, and I love him so very much too. It's only a pity since Aunt Petunia and Dudley don't care forÂ me very much. They never want a kiss from me. I've shared many kisses with Uncle Vernon!" I confessed.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Child. Oh you poor child. It's those damned muggles! Child, you must stay with us from now on, away from those wicked muggles. To think, I was worrying about the treatment of second sons. I can never raise you as a proper young lord due to that horrid man as Chief Warlock. However, those muggles! Don't worry. I'll make sure that no muggle would touch you ever again!" The man snarled. I paled. This man wants to kidnap me, confine me in his home. I need to leave... but I could have a new family. I could never have kisses with Uncle Vernon again. But this man seems to care for me. Uncle Vernon never got mad for my sake, never got mad with others whenever they did something mean to me.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I decided to stay.</em>
