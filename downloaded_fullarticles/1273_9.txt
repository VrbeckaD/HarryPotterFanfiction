    <p>Remus Lupin has always thought that Sirius Black was impossible. Both because of his uncanny charm and his propensity to rebel against people trying to help him. Sirius doesn’t let people know him well enough for them to know when he needs help. There was one exception, Remus thought, but that was a long time ago.</p><p>Remus flips through an old stack of Polaroids from the Marauder’s days at Hogwarts that Lily charmed so they’d move like normal wizard photos. Shuffling to a new one, Remus sees a familiar head of messy black hair entering the corner of the photograph then creeping back out. Lily’s fingers swing through the frame for a second, probably motioning for James to get out of the shot. In the foreground, his younger self and one Sirius Black stand side by side. He looks bored with a hint of amusement, an attitude only a wealthy heir could pull off. Sirius’ hands tuck into his pockets and push his robe back while Remus picks a piece of lint off his sweater. Remus watches as Black takes his gaze away from Lily and studies Remus instead. He bumps his shoulder with his then gives him an impossible smile.</p><p>The charm ends before he can see his younger self’s reaction. Remus remembers that day. It was a chilly fall day, but the sun was out. For the life of him, he can’t recall why James and Sirius weren’t at the Quidditch field, relishing the rare weather. Instead they were all posing for a picture in front of the Black Lake. Remus holds the Polaroids to his chest for a brief second then squirrels them away in his sock drawer. It’s easy to hide a stack of photos amongst the thick wool socks, sorted by color and length.</p><p>A rhythmic knock sounds at his flat’s door and Remus snatches his wand from the bedside table. His feet carry him soundlessly through the hallway having memorized the creaky spots and the exact place where the decorative table stands. He reaches his front door, pressing his eye to the security hole only to see the distorted view of his old friend. <em>Sirius Black</em>.</p><p>Remus undoes the manual locks with a flick of his wand, keeping the other magical wards fully in place. With a turn of the handle, the door swings open.</p><p>“What a warm welcome,” he says, staring at the wand being held at chest level.</p><p>“Sorry.” Remus lowers his wand. “Old habits, I suppose.”</p><p>“Hmm,” he hums. His eyes trace the edges of the doorway as if he sees the invisible wards creating a barrier between him and Remus. “We should go inside, that is unless you prefer having conversations in the hall.”</p><p>Remus mutters the spell to let him inside and Black saunters past him, his eyes scanning the flat before finding a destination in the kitchen. His thick, black hair ties into a delicate knot atop his head and his muggles clothes say he’s spent the day out. He wears a baggy v-neck long sleeve shirt that’s half-tucked into straight-legged brown khaki pants. It’s an outfit that’s supposed to blend him into the crowd, but Sirius can’t do that even when he tries. He looks too good, even when his body hasn’t fully recovered from Azkaban.</p><p>“You're supposed to be in hiding,” he says, following him into the breadbox sized kitchen. Sirius opens the fridge. They both survey the general lack of groceries and Remus opens his mouth to say he doesn’t have much, but that’s fairly obvious and he knows he’s not one to keep food around.—-that was James’ habit, always hoarding snacks.</p><p>Sirius abandons the fridge in favor of the top cupboard beside it: the one that houses the tea.</p><p>“I’ll put the kettle on,” Remus says, grabbing it from the stove and filling it with water from the tap. He set it on the burner and turns the heat on, then faces Sirius whose still inspecting Remus’ tea collection.</p><p>Sirius sniffs each tin until selecting the expensive orange blossom oolong from the shop around the corner. His tastes haven’t changed, Remus thinks and smiles to himself before adopting a stoic face to confront him about risking his life.</p><p>“You’re not supposed to be here,” Remus starts again.</p><p>“There’s a lot of things I’m not supposed to be. Like alive,” he says. He pushes up his sleeves, revealing black ink etched across his forearms. Remus wants to study each tattoo, memorize his skin, but he dismisses the thought, giving Sirius a disapproving look instead. Sirius ruffles under his eye, saying nothing while he portions two servings of oolong into reusable tea bags. He opens a few cupboard doors searching for cups, then gets to the one behind Remus.</p><p>Remus’ throat tightens and his whole brain is absorbed in the scent of him. His grey eyes hold his own, simmering with emotion that can only be read by those who know him. The heat from his body radiates off him. He’d forgotten what it was like to be so close to Sirius Black. It was intoxicating, overwhelming—an uncontrollable force of nature. Impossible.</p><p>“Maybe I didn’t want to think about my life for a moment,” he says, then reaches for the handle behind Remus, but stops, letting his hand fall by his side. “Maybe I’d rather think about you.”</p><p>“My life?” Remus scoffs, “because it’s so peachy.” He steps to the side to allow Sirius to search the cupboard behind him despite knowing it’s the wrong one.</p><p>Sirius’ mouth hardens into a line and his long, thin fingers thread through the hair coming free from his bun. “Maybe I just wanted to exist in a place where the future didn’t seem so goddamn bleak. A place with you.”</p><p>“With me?”</p><p>“Merlin, is it so hard to believe that I want to spend time with you?” Sirius huffs.</p><p>“Thought I’d remind of the past you so want to forget.”</p><p>“No.” Sirius’ eyes flash with anger “You were always the best parts.”</p><p>Remus stares at him, willing his heart not to beat so fast and or his cheeks not to color. His eyes fall to Sirius’ bottom lip which is being sucked into his mouth as if he said something he didn’t mean to say and wishes he could pull the words back inside. The kettle sings breaking the tension between them.</p><p>Remus switches off the burner and selects two cups from the cabinet nearest the stove.</p><p>“You were gonna let me search every cupboard, weren’t you?” Sirius says. “Prick.” He laughs.</p><p>Remus smirks and finishes preparing the tea.</p>
