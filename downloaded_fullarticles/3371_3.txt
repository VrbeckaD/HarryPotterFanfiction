  <strong>Chapter 1: Escape</strong>
</p><hr/><p> “Desperate ills need desperate remedies.”</p><p>-<em>Agatha Christie</em></p><hr/><p> Their clandestine meeting occurred under the cloak of darkness at the edge of an internment camp, a live electric wire fence between them. The man shivered violently, both from nerves and overexposure to the rapidly cooling autumn night, which his thin, standard-issued shirt and pants did little to protect him from. He grinded his teeth to stop them from chattering, but the resulting tension made his head pound.</p><p>He clenched his fists until his knuckles were white.</p><p>Two decades of practice using Occulmency could not prevent his thoughts from being consumed with anxiety and paranoia; he had witnessed too many of his comrades torn apart via firing squad for attempting to escape. Still, he had the presence of mind to scoff at himself for his weakness. He was supposed to be better than this.</p><p>The heavily bundled woman was equally anxious, visible from the way she worried her bottom lip with her teeth, and the lines of exhaustion and tension that were etched into her forehead. She was quiet, though, and for that the man was thankful.</p><p>It was a miracle he had gotten this far. And his overwrought nerves reminded him that his luck was due to turn, and one wrong move would guarantee a vicious death for both of them.</p><p>But the string of miracles continued. One moment the air between them was alive with the buzz of electricity, and the next an almost unnatural silence replaced the ever-present hum, and the blinding artificial florescent lighting illuminating the courtyard behind him went out. The woman wasted no time in the darkness cutting the wire with heavy metal clippers, before she roughly pulled him through the severed space. She then wasted precious seconds unbuttoning a heavy man’s cloak from her body and handing it to him. Despite his fear, the man was thankful, as his body gradually stopped its violent shuddering.</p><p>They took off into the night, stumbling in the darkness over the uneven forest floor.</p><p>They both felt better the farther away they were from the camp. The muggles who had suggested burying radioactive focal points under the internment camps in order to destabilize their magical control had underestimated the damage it would do to their cores. Insanity was not unheard of, although pain, aches, depression, and anxiety was more common. As were a variety of other symptoms. Nausea, insomnia, fevers.</p><p><em>Negligible side-effects</em>, it was argued to assuage human rights activists. The man had sneered when he heard their reasoning. What right did politicians have to standardize and benchmark suffering? For the many faults he could list of the Ministry of Magic, the muggle government took their inclination towards censorship, surveillance, and incarceration, as well as an unsettling ability to justify inhumane acts towards politically determined <em>non-humans</em>, to frightening new heights.</p><p>The man was intelligent enough to understand that his situation was accomplished through well-executed propaganda. Instituted by political parties and forwarded by a stunning variety of muggle media sources (that all seemed to adopt Rita Skeeter’s predisposition towards sensationalism), they claimed he was dangerous and volatile, ethnocentric to the point of homicide. While certainly true of a number of his dead relatives, he was somewhat stunned to see how little this gross over-generalization was questioned by the public. There were <em>children</em> in these camps. How was that in any way justifiable?</p><p>Simply put, it wasn’t.</p><p>They had traveled some 3000 meters before the woman felt well enough to dig a wand clumsily out of a worn, beaded bag. She clutched his hand with no hesitation, preparing to apparate, and the man couldn’t decide where to center his attention. It had been years since he had seen a wand, and the urge to grab it, to feel even a twinge of magic course through his limbs and torso, was powerful. But the warmth and solidity of her hand- the man was surprised to feel as comforted as he did by her touch. Here was a sense of heat and comradery and purpose… His grip tightened, and he could see the empathy in her eyes right before the world around them disappeared.</p><p>They apparated into another forest, and the woman waited patiently as the man fell to his knees and dry-heaved. It had been some time since he traveled using magical means, and the lingering nausea exacerbated his body’s reaction.</p><p>He spent several minutes getting his bearings, and then he immediately became all business, wanting to draw as little attention to his embarrassment as possible. “You were able to get it?”</p><p>The woman rolled her eyes at his skepticism, but nevertheless grabbed a long chain from around her neck and displayed the homemade time-turner. She glanced over his dirty, threadbare excuse for clothing. “Were you able to get what you needed?”</p><p>The man held up the modified 9 mm semi-automatic handgun, which he had tucked into his loose pants, his face carefully blank.</p><p>They didn’t ask each other how they had obtained said items. They were old enough now to understand that some inquiries were best left unmade, and sharing burdens for the sake of their sanity was best done discriminately.</p><p>As they walked towards the forest edge, paranoia crept back into man, and he found himself verbally expressing his doubt in their plans. “Are you absolutely certain we need a sounding board? Wouldn’t it be better to simply initiate change to past events ourselves?”</p><p>The woman shook her head. “We can’t know for certain the effect that certain actions will have on the timeline. While I am nearly certain we altered the time-turner enough to allow for major changes instead of a loop, for all we know our interference could result in an even worse outcome.”</p><p>The man snorted in disbelief. “What could possibly be worse than what we already experienced?”</p><p>Her expression was cold as she stated the truth in a matter-of-fact manner. “Total annihilation.”</p><p>The man’s eyes widened in horror as his body froze. “They wouldn’t?”</p><p>She gave him a hard look, and he pursed in lips and furrowed his brow as he acknowledged that possibility.</p><p>“But surely removing the Dark Lord before his rise to power would be a better option than attempting to reason with the man? You weren’t there after he reclaimed a body, Granger. Mentally unstable doesn’t begin to cover it.”</p><p>She frowned. “The way I understand it, Riddle took advantage of the dissent among Pureblood families in order to accumulate power. There is no guarantee that without him in the picture, someone else won’t shoehorn into that position. Which, according to my arithmetic calculations, could have devastating consequences on the wizarding world.”</p><p>“But we don’t know for sure. You already admitted that it is almost impossible to predict because you don’t know who would head this operation. This could all simply be conjecture.”</p><p>“Which is why we need a sounding board.”</p><p>The man tried not to let his cynicism show, but it was incredibly difficult. “And you know who to approach?”</p><p>“Don’t you?”</p><p>His eyes narrowed in frustration. “No. Otherwise, I wouldn’t be asking.”</p><p>She gave him a disgruntled look. “Your godfather. For Merlin’s sake, Malfoy.”</p><p>“Severus?”</p><p>“Surely you can see the merits?”</p><p>“Well, I mean, of course. I’m just surprised you didn’t suggest Dumbledore.”</p><p>She bit her lip in consternation as they walked up to the castle ruins. “Dumbledore has a very specific… vision about the future and the way he thinks things need to go. My intuition tells me he would see us as a threat.”</p><p>“I see.”</p><p>There were several minutes of silence as the man tried to remember everything he could about his previous headmaster, attempting to find evidence for her reasoning. It was difficult. His sixth year exempted, he had very little contact with the man.</p><p>His voice, when he did eventually speak up, was hesitant. “Are you suggesting the man was… some kind of master manipulator?” His tone was rife with disbelief.</p><p>The woman looked at him with an eyebrow raised. “You know he plotted his own death months beforehand, right? He forcibly maneuvered his way into martyrdom.”</p><p>“Manipulating a single event is hardly impressive. Not when you have direct control over a number of the pieces.”</p><p>“Which inherently requires its own manner of manipulation. Yes?”</p><p>“He took advantage of several key players when they were at their most vulnerable. And exploited them ruthlessly afterwards. Which I suppose is indicative of machinations, but the level of control you seem to be implying is far more extensive.”</p><p>The woman nodded. “Decades in the making.”</p><p>“Where is your proof?”</p><p>“Hm. Well, what about Harry? Do you think it was a coincidence that he happened to grow up in an abusive muggle environment that left him ostracized, deprived of a real family, and ensured he had little to no respect of authority? And he just happened to bump into the Weasleys, a <em>magical</em> family on the <em>muggle</em> side of the barrier, that represented the family Harry always wished he had, and were coincidentally appropriately Gryffindor and already in the Headmaster’s pockets?”</p><p>“I thought he stayed with his muggle relatives because of the blood wards?”</p><p>The woman looked surprised. “He talked to you about this?”</p><p>The man sighed. “We talked briefly after the war, yes.”</p><p>“Hm. Well, to answer your question, blood wards did offer him some protection. But how necessary was this safeguard after Voldemort initially disappeared and all of his most faithful followers were locked up in Azkaban? Wouldn’t other wards have been entirely adequate in its place?”</p><p>“I suppose.”</p><p>She repeated his response with exasperation and aggravation. “You <em>suppose</em>.”</p><p>“I mean, I can hardly account for all of the variables at play. I wasn’t there.”</p><p>“There is no reason to excuse abuse. No matter how <em>convenient</em>.”</p><p>He recognized the growing tantrum, despite the academic nature of their disagreement, and held up his hands in surrender. He had long ago disabused himself of the notion that he would ever be able to understand the female mind. “Hey, now. No need to get snippy.”</p><p>She sighed out an apology, and the man could literally hear her exhaustion. “Sorry Draco. The last few weeks have been… rough.”</p><p>He nodded, and reached out to pat her shoulder awkwardly in reassurance. “I understand. So, Severus?”</p><p>She smiled at him in gratitude, and he could feel something in his chest warm at the sight. “Mmhm.”</p><p>They walked around the shattered wall of the overgrown greenhouse, broken pieces of glass and metal reflecting light from the waning moon. She stopped them, and started to nervously babble as she drew the delicate chain around both of their necks. “So, we are limited on the number of turns possible due to limitations inherent within the altered construction. Although it was designed to jump years, with the amount of sand at our disposal, it would be dangerous to push two decades. Our initial attempt is going to be fifteen years, from 2010 to 1995.”</p><p>He nodded for her comfort, as he was already aware of how far their initial jump was going to be.</p><p>His last thoughts before the colors and sound swirled around them in an ever-turning kaleidoscope was some overly romantic drivel about the lovely color of her eyes. Like warm caramel inside a chocolate truffle. He couldn’t help but drown in a familiar rush of warmth intermitted with self-disgust and self-pity. But as he braced himself against her body, inwardly fighting growing nerves, he could appreciate the distraction of her presence.</p><hr/><p>To be continued...</p><p> </p>
