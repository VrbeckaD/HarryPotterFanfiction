  <span>“Aren’t you a bit old to be counting stars?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t understand what age is supposed to have to do with it. Sometimes, I just like to sit here in the middle of the night, lean back and stare into the orbit.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Isn’t that a bit...lonely?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why should it be?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, you’re out here, all alone, for the entire night.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not alone, though. I’m never alone. I have the stars with me wherever I go..”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You can’t always see them, though.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That doesn’t mean they’re not there.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’ve got a point there, I guess.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“...”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“...”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Who are you anyway? I haven’t seen you around.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You wouldn’t have, even if I had been here. Unless I allowed it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But I’m seeing you right now.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Only because I spoke first and gave you my permission.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don't understand.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I didn’t expect you to. Humans rarely do.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You say that like you’re something else.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That might be because I am.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re...</span>
  <em>
    <span>what</span>
  </em>
  <span>?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not a human. You humans are always so foolish to assume that everyone is human until proven otherwise. It’s silly, really.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Muggles, maybe. But here in Hogwarts?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s the same here as it is anywhere else. You know nothing of the various non-humans among the other students.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maybe I do.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you, Myrtle Warren?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How do you know my name?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I read it from your surface thoughts.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So, Legitimacy? Isn’t that illegal?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Pha, Legitimacy is a weak version that witches and wizards copied of us. What I am doing is no skill per se. It’s simply an ability that everyone of us has.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Us? Who is us?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Me and the others of my pantheon.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wait, pantheon? Isn’t that term used to describe a family of gods and goddesses?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, exactly.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So you’re telling me you’re a god?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That is precisely what I am saying.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then what could you possibly want from me? There are so many more interesting and competent people here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And that’s where you’re wrong, Myrtle. You deserve a better fate.”</span>
