          <div class="userstuff"><p align="justify">I guess it was unavoidable. It was building up in me. This want. <span>This sick feeling I couldn’t push away.</span></p><p align="justify">I wanted it gone. Forever. I thought satisfying it <span>once</span> would be enough and I would move on.</p><p align="justify">No such thing happened.</p><p align="justify">It was even worse and more unbereable <span>afterwards.</span></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="center"> ***</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Since he promised he wouldn't bother me again, I thought it was over. I thought I'd never see him again.</p><p align="justify"><span>But </span>I kept seeing him. He just wasn't looking my way any more.</p><p align="justify">I didn't think it would bother me. For whatever reason, it did.</p><p align="justify">Why? I pretended I didn't know.</p><p align="justify">It was just my luck that I met him on my rare outing into the wizarding world beyond the pompous social events.</p><p align="justify">In Blaise's establishment.</p><p align="justify">Why did I keep agreeing to Pansy's whims? I didn't know.</p><p align="justify">He didn't see me so I watched him. Just this once I told myself. Just this once I would look and it would be enough.</p><p align="justify">He was laughing, talking <span>and </span>smiling with his friends. They looked content and happy. I hated it.</p><p align="justify">It wasn't enough.</p><p align="justify">I am not proud I followed him outside. I am not proud of what I did next.</p><p align="justify">He was walking away. He didn't know I was behind him for a while. I didn't know what I wanted to accomplish exactly.</p><p align="justify">He looked behind and saw me. He frowned but stopped.</p><p align="justify">'Malfoy? What are you doing?' He asked.</p><p align="justify">I have no idea. 'I don't know,' I blurted.</p><p align="justify">He kept frowning. 'Well whatever it is, I'd be <span>glad</span> if you stopped following me?'</p><p align="justify">'Why? You could follow me but I can't do the same?' I asked and shrugged.</p><p align="justify">'Yeah, cause that turned out great.' He started walking again.</p><p align="justify">'Well it could have,' I said, not moving.</p><p align="justify">He snorted. 'Yeah I bet. With one of us dead probably.'</p><p align="justify">No. 'I meant something else.'</p><p align="justify">He stopped and looked at me. 'No it wouldn't.'</p><p align="justify">'Now we'll never know I guess,' I shrugged again.</p><p align="justify">'Exactly. And thank god for that.'</p><p align="justify">'What is that supposed to mean?' I was getting mad. And closer<span>.</span></p><p align="justify">He shook his head. 'That it would be wrong. It was wrong. All of it. What I did and what you said, too.'</p><p align="justify">'You almost got me killed Potter. I would say and do anything to finally get rid of you.'</p><p align="justify">'Well you did get rid of me.' I saw the scowling expression on his face. 'I don't want to think about it, ever. Look, I want to go home, I'm tired...‘</p><p align="justify">How thick could one get? I was probably too subtle. 'Yes. I am tired too.'</p><p align="justify">I was close enough so I did it.</p><p align="justify">He tasted different. There was no blood this time.</p></div>
