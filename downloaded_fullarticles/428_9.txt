  <span>Pain had been all that Ron Weasley had known after the war. The pain of losing a brother. The pain of losing the woman that he wanted to be his wife. Pain of losing his best mate, he soon became no stranger to grieving. Ron grieved about who he lost in the war, about Lavender, Fred, Colin and so many others. He grieved over his lost relationships with those around him, he grieved about who he had lost in himself. Ron drowned himself in firewhisky and elven wine, along with so many other drinks he couldn’t be bothered to name. Ron had lost himself, he found that he didn't care about receiving the attention that he had always craved. He just wanted it to all go away. To have his life back.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>So he moved, the first chance he got. He moved to America, a place where wizards and witches might recognize the name but not the face. Ron spent the better part of his first year in America, nurturing a new passion that he found. Ron had found that he rather enjoyed the mass calculations and mixing of woods and metals that came with broom making. He bought a book and then another book about wand and broom making, and then another, and another. They soon piled up, after all wands had more lore around woods, and brooms more on the metal and charm side of things. Ron had started experimenting, he found himself grounded and almost happy again. Broom making became a sort of therapy for him. After a while he made racing and Quidditch brooms, along with the safe travel ones. Ron expanded his horizons after two years into broom manufacturing, into creating new Quidditch supplies. He made childrens kits for Quidditch. Ones that are much less dangerous to play with. Instead of the bludgers bashing they bumped and nudged children, the snitch was slower for learning more than for actual playing. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ron made his own bludger and quaffle color scheme, charmed to change colors depending on the weather. It was only the snitch that remained the same. Ron after two more years made quite the profitable little company, it's only staff being him and a room that he charmed to make orders. Ron after another two found that he started to open his own manufacturing warehouses. Ron accepted applicants based on their resumes and howler introductions, they never saw his face. Two more years and Ron had gotten his Quidditch brooms featured in an advertisement on the world cup, one more and almost every Quidditch team seemed to be using them, newer or older models it didn’t matter. Ron had more money than he had ever touched in his whole life. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He was living comfortably, nobody knew where to find him. His friends and family never seemed to owl him, and fair is fair. He hadn’t told them where he went and he had drifted away enough for them to not bother even trying to find him. That had to be the only thing that Ron missed, was not knowing what was going on in his family's lives. His friends lives. Ron’s life hadn’t turned out to be the dream that he had hoped for after the war. No, it churned out of the mortar and pestle much different. Ron didn’t marry Hermione and gain a brood of his own, their relationship had failed after a little over a month after the war.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It has been nine years since the war, eight after Ron pulled a disappearing act. He moved into a little town near a beach during his first year here. He hadn’t moved since, Ron loved the little house, with a charmed basement so that it was a lot bigger downstairs than up. The house was halfway through remodeling when the couple that had started to renovate it left the poor house to rot. So Ron had taken it up, the second year there he had finished remodeling it and had made the basement into a beautiful workshop for his brooms and supplies. He had an office down there where he handled finances and costs. He had opened a workshop for brooms in England and America so far, he was working on other areas, such as China or Japan. Ron had a fair amount of workers to try and pay. His company is doing fantastically, it’s flourishing underneath Ron’s careful hand. He had owled George once asking in an anonymous letter how he managed to make his joke shop so profitable. George had surprisingly answered Ron with a detailed account of how he and Fred had gotten their shop off the ground. Wishing his admirer success on their business, in a letter soon after. Ron in turn had given George a beautiful decorative broom later once he had gotten his company on its feet, and able to afford to pay George back. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The broom had been modeled after a firework, the wood being painted a firetruck red, and little sparks and fireworks explosions dancing across the handle. The broom wasn’t made to fly and Ron had made sure to specify that with George in a letter, that also contained his thanks. George hadn’t replied, Ron assumed that it might be because he was so busy and left it at that. Ron also started to make decorative brooms for wizarding households after that.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>With the business picking up pace, Ron found that he didn’t have all that much free time. Not to say that he didn’t but it wasn’t as much as he would have preferred to have. He didn’t quite realize what would happen today however, in his lovely home, after all how could he?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ron was doing the final calculations on one of his new models of a Quidditch broom (He had been planning to give the Chudley Cannons a new set of broomsticks for a while now and he was just soothing out the kinks in the design that he wanted to go with), when it happened. The room started spinning, almost as if he was having a fit of extreme vertigo. Spinning and dizziness, until there was a splitting headache. Looking up through watery eyes he sees himself, given a younger version, but himself nonetheless. Ron’s younger self looks at him with wide eyes, he can’t be more than eleven here- maybe twelve if he had to max it out. But then again Ron didn’t exactly age well as a teen, with how tall he was people always thought he was older than he actually was. He grew into it more as the years had progressed after the war, he had picked up the hobby of working out with some muggle friends. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Now, Ron knew that he wasn’t the most mature person period. But he had inevitably grown up, eventually, when the war was over. He grew out of it, he never worked on school because there had been no point to him, was one of the things that the mind healer went over with him. There was always someone better, so he had really no reason to try other than the desire to shine. But when he finally did, it was for the accomplishments of others not himself. He loathed it, so when young-Ron opened his mouth in amazement, and went to shout, Ron did the only thing that he could through his pounding headache, he touched him. Clapping his hand over his young versions mouth, and he staring at his hand. Staring as particles flew away from his older self, and started merging onto the younger. The younger him went slack, like a dead body, well Ron was looking on in horror. He watched on in both fear and amazement, it- the fact that he was practically flying apart, his cells running away from his form- didn’t hurt anymore than the headache that was assaulting him, but it was almost as if he was having an out of body experience. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A loud thunk was the signal of blackness, Ronald Billius Weasley had passed out.</span>
