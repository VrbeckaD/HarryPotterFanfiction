    <p>"Mommy, why did you invite the Freaks. I's my birthday." Dudley cried to his mom. He wasn't happy that Petunia decided it would be a good idea to invite Harry and her sister's family to thier trip to the Moriah Bay Aquarium. Usually by crying Dudley would get what he wanted but it wouldn't do any good this time.</p>
<p>"You need to get to know your relatives Didikins, besides it's not very nice of you to call them freaks." Petunia explained when the doorbell rang.</p>
<p>"He's here."</p>
<p>Dudley ran to the door to meet with his friend, Piers Polkiss, who would be joining the Dursley family to the aquarium.</p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>Moriah Bay, Britian.</em>
</p>
<p>For a small town, Moriah Bay wasn't that big, yet it was a popular tourist destination.</p>
<p>People came from all over to enjoy the coastline and to visit the aquarium. What many considered the shining jewel of the town.</p>
<hr/>
<p>After nearly 2 hours, Vernon pulled into the aquarium's parking lot. He and the family had been stuck in traffic and now was the struggle of finding a parking spot.</p>
<p>"Bastards, learn to park." Vernon roared at a car who had taken the parking space he was about to take till he found an empty one.</p>
<p>Parking the car, the Dursleys got out. Vernon looked around and smiled as there was no sign of the Joestars.</p>
<p>"Guess they're not coming, so let's go." Vernon loudly bellowed so everyone could here, yet unaware of the car that had just parked next to his own.</p>
<p>His face went pale as a familiar old man and brown haired women exited the car. He knew too well who they were.</p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>"Hello Dursley." Joseph cracked a sarcastic and bitter-sweet tone. He couldn't stand being around Vernon and Vernon can stand him.</p>
<p>Vernon said nothing, only reluctantly shaking the old Joestar's hand and glaring daggers at him while Petunia talked with her mother and sister.</p>
<p>Dudley and Piers stood around when the noticed a certain someone exit the car following an orange haired women.</p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>"Look its the Freak." Piers pointed, grabbing both Dudley's and Harry's attention.</p>
<p>"Let's get him." The two shouted in unison, running at Harry when they slammed into what felt like a wall.</p>
<p>Looking up, the two were met by the icy blue glare of Jotaro Kujo.</p>
<p>"I-Is that your cousin you told me about Dudley?" Piers whispered to his friend, who was just as scared as he was.</p>
<p>Dudley nodded. Some of his old gang members warned him about Jotaro. Gordon and Dennis had transferred to Harry's school and learned from some of the other delinquents to avoid the "burly boy with the ripped cap." unless you want to go to the hospital. The two laughed it off at first, thinking that they were trying to frighten them in order to show them their place until they found another thug bloodied and bruised. It was the first time the two members of Dudley's gang screamed like girls and booked it, leaving them mentally scarred. After that little shock, the two went back to their old bullying habits but still remained on edge.</p>
<p>They had never been specifically told the boy's name until that fateful day. One of the more popular kids, the head of the rugby team, decided to beat up the "scrawny black haired boy" and was looking for others to help. Gordon and Dennis happily decided to join in. However fate decided that one of them would be sent to the office for a talk with the principal that would cause them to miss the "event". When Gordon got out of the office and was making his way back to class with Dennis, the sound of banging caught their attention. Peaking down the hallway, they witnessed the Jock from earlier being slammed against the lockers by a large man in a black chain jacket and ripped cap, the same person they were warned not to piss off. They overheard him telling the jock not to mess with his cousin or it will be a whole lot worse. Dennis and Gordon knew that he was referring to Harry and knew it would be a good idea to warn Dudley.</p>
<p>Piers and Dudley slowly backed away, afraid of the thought of getting pummeled by Jotaro.</p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>The director greeted the family as they entered. He dodged out of the way as Piers and Dudley sped past him, nearly tripping the man.</p>
<p>The family had formed a small group in front of him to discuss something when the director eyed what looked to be a walrus.</p>
<p>He was just about to react for his two-way radio to report an escaped animal when the man turned to face him.</p>
<p>"WALRUS..."</p>
<p>"I'm not a bloody walrus you blithering idiot." Vernon roared at the man, who was shaking.</p>
<p>"Sorry sir..." The director apologized as Vernon went to regroup.</p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>The Joestars and Dursleys decided to split up as to not crowd other people. Vernon would go with Joseph, Holly with Suzie, Petunia with Dudley and Piers, Jotaro with Harry, while Tohru vowed to go solo.</p>
<p>Vernon and Joseph were currently standing next to the Walrus exhibit when a large Cow went up to Vernon. Joseph taking notice pretty quickly.</p>
<p>"I think she likes you." Joseph winked at a now puce-faced Mr. Dursley, who was on the edge of another outburst.</p>
<p>Joseph moved on to look at the penguins when Vernon turned to Cow, who was now nose to nose with the obese man.</p>
<p>"Get your ruddy arse outta my face you overgrown pig." Vernon shouted at it, only to get a flipper to the face.</p>
<p>Joseph laughed while Vernon raged.</p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>Tohru stared down into touch tank. A sea-star curled around her hand while she stood down hungrily.</p>
<p><em>"Ok Tohru stop thinking about eating. I know all the fish look tempting, but you don't want to get in trouble..."</em> She spoke with closed eyes only to open them and look at her hand.</p>
<p><em>"Agh.... fuck it..."</em> She growled, shoving her hand into her mouth and eating the sea-star. Afterwards she walked away like nothing ever happened.</p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>Dudley and Piers were bored. The fish weren't interesting to them as all they did was swim and do nothing.</p>
<p>"Come on... Move!"</p>
<p>Dudley tapped on the glass, trying to get an alligator to move. Yet it paid him no attention as it slept.</p>
<p>"I'm bored... Can't we go play something?" Piers sighed.</p>
<p>"Yeah..." Dudley's face split into a Cheshire cat-like smile. "Let's play Harry Hunt. We haven't played that in a long time."</p>
<p>The two boys made sure Dudley's mom, who was busy talking with an employee about something, before slipping away.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Harry sat on a bench next to the dolphin tank. He was tired of walking and currently was taking a break.</p>
<p>Jotaro on the other hand seemed to have taken quite the interest in the dolphins. He'd always had a thing for dolphins and it didn't help he had a few dolphin themed items stashed in his room.</p>
<p>Harry noticed Tohru, who was currently taunting the sharks. Flashing her fangs at them and making them flee. He was totally unaware of Dudley and Piers hiding behind a trashcan mere feet from him.</p>
<p>Until Piers threw a punch...</p>
<p>Harry was thrown back, his nose beginning to bleed.</p>
<p>"Look who it is, the Freak..." Dudley sneered.</p>
<p>"What do you want Dudley." Harry stood up and snarled.</p>
<p>"Not gonna run away and crying to your mommy? Oh wait, she's dead." Piers taunted.</p>
<p>Harry was getting angry. He felt like pummeling Dudley's face into the tile right then and there.</p>
<p>"Prongs! RUSHING SMASH!" Harry pointed at Piers.</p>
<p>Piers and Dudley laughed.</p>
<p>"You think your imaginary friend will..." Piers was suddenly thrown into a trashcan as Prongs materialized, clearly having enough of their crap.</p>
<p>Prongs then turned to Dudley. Lowering his rack slowly approached the fat boy, before flinging him into the air. Seconds later, an audible splash was heard as Dudley had landed in the dolphin tank.</p>
<p>The dolphins began to throw Dudley around like a beach ball. Luckily no one was there save for two others, Jotaro, who smirked at his cousin's predicament, and Tohru, trying to hide her amusement.</p>
<p>Dudley soon found himself back on the ground, out of the dolphin tank. He was shaking from the incident and decided to go get his mom.</p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>"Mommy! Mommy! Harry did the freaky stuff again." Dudley ran crying to his mother followed by Piers, who was still traumatized, hoping that she would take pity on him. Yet Petunia only crossed her arms and scolded him.</p>
<p>"Did you and Piers provoke him?" Petunia spoke up. Dudley's forehead was now coated in a thick layer of sweat as all he managed to sputter out was gibberish.</p>
<p>"Your lucky I don't take you home right now. We'll talk about this when we get home."</p>
<p>Dudley hung his head in shame "Yes mommy..."</p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>Prongs walked up to his User who was facing away from him.</p>
<p>"You know I could've dealt with him on my own." Harry grumbled as Prongs nudged him affectionately.</p>
<p>"I know you were just trying to protect me."</p>
<p>Harry placed a hand on the Stand's snout. Prong's responded by closing its eyes and making a soft "RRRR".</p>
<p>Soon enough, Harry's attention was caught by his aunt calling everyone to regroup to go get lunch in the aquarium's restaurant.</p>
<p> </p>
