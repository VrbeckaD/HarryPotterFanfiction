    <p>Harry's 5 here </p><p>Â </p><p>Harry whined, sitting up in his bed. The child clutched his teddy bear close to him. The nightmares were back. He sobbed freely, wanting to be comforted by his father. Harry jumped down from his bed, his little legs running to his daddy's room. </p><p>Harry swung open the door and cried loudly, wanting his father's attention. Severus sat up, patting the bed gently. "Come here, baby." Severus cooed softly. Harry climbed up on the bed and launched himself into Severus' arms. "D-daddy!" Harry cried. </p><p>Severus cooed at his baby. "It's okay hun. It's okay." He pulled Harry more closely into his arms and rocked him. "You'll be okay. It wasn't real." </p><p>Harry managed to calm down, his breathing evening out and promptly passing out in his father's lap. </p><p>Severus chuckled and laid back down, holding his son close to him. "I love you so much, baby." He cooed before passing out himself.</p>
