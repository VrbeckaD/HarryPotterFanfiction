          <div class="userstuff"><p>The ghost draws near in silent step, unblinking gaze aglow,<br/>
He kneels bed-side by candle-light, a whisper of a breath.<br/>
Upon his lips dance soundless cries, his pledges to the foe,<br/>
Accuses with his eyes affix, boy asking of their death.</p><p>A white bouquet he brings today, fresh lilies for the ill,<br/>
Sweet flowers for the vigil mine, though we may only dream.<br/>
“‘Twas prudent so,” I whisper back, “like every other kill,”<br/>
But still he scents my guilty lie, which presses at the seam.</p><p>In battle I was insecure, my doubt grown by the day,<br/>
We spilled the red like water pure, friend foe alike in mud.<br/>
“It was defeat I feared most then, the chance I had to stay,”<br/>
Forgiveness blooms he brilliantly, his cheeks flushed bright with blood.</p><p>His soul he pours forth into mine, to whom I gave my heart,<br/>
I spilled my secrets to a ghost, who took me all apart.</p></div>
