    <p>“You got a new shirt.” James said from his chair in the small break room in the back <i>Geno’s Pizza</i>, flipping through his phone while Remus changed out of his apron and t-shirt in the mirror and into dark jeans and a white button-down that he thought made him look, well, okay. At least less pale.</p><p>“I got a new…” Remus looked through to the restaurant, as if anyone could hear him over the music and chatter, “client.”</p><p>James sighs, “I hate your job.”</p><p>Remus let out a short laugh, “Then give me the other half of my rent.”</p><p>James slipped his phone back into his apron pocket, leaning his elbows on his knees and looking at Remus in the mirror, “My parents could.”</p><p>“For the last time, <i>no</i>, James.”</p><p>James rolls his eyes, like he always does, “This new guy. What do you know about him?”</p><p>“I know his name. I know he wants to meet me in a suite of a very fancy hotel.”</p><p>James raised his eyebrows, “And…”</p><p>“And so he’ll tip well for my troubles.” He shot James a rye grin in the mirror.</p><p>“Remus.”</p><p>“I have to go, okay? It’s fine.” He picked up his jacket, swinging it over his shoulders. He’d make sure to have it off when he went in. It was far too ratty to match the rest of his splurged outfit. Not splurge, he reminded himself. Necessity. These clothes ended up smelling like ten different colognes by the end of the month. He didn’t think he’d ever be able to think of them as a treat for himself. He sends James one more half-smile, “I’ll see you Monday. Double shift, right?”</p><p>James sighed, standing to get back on the floor, “Duh.”</p><p>~</p><p>The hotel lobby was more crystal than anything else, and the lights shimmered off every marble and gem-like surface available—which was a lot. Remus felt out of place and like everyone knew it, but he put on his well practiced smile and slid out of his jacket. He held it out of view as he approached the desk.</p><p>“Hello, sir, how can I help you?”</p><p>“I’m here to meet a Mr. Sirius Black,” Had to be a fake name, Remus thought. Had to be. “Suite twelve.”</p><p>The woman straightened immediately, “Of course, sir. Mr. Black had told us to expect someone. Please go right up those elevators there, sir.”</p><p>Remus wanted to laugh at how many times she had called him ‘sir,’ but instead he nodded swift thanks and walked to the elevators. His dress shoes were too small and, if there was one thing good about his job, it was that he never had to wear them for too long.</p><p>Even the elevator was shiny.</p><p>He knocked twice on the white, ornate suite door. The number twelve was golden, and Remus could see part of his eye in the fatter part of the two. He looked away, blinked, and then the door was open.</p><p>Sirius Black was not his usual client. Remus almost checked the room number. Sirius Black was not in his forties, he didn’t have salt and pepper hair. Nor was he an insecure boy around Remus’ age who, really, didn’t want sex, but more someone to talk to. Sirius Black had a dark blue shirt that stretched across his broad shoulders, bright, long-lashed gray eyes and full lips. He had blue-black hair the curled around his ears and brushed over his forehead. He was tanned, like he spent time in sunny places. His watch probably cost more than Remus’ entire life, his smile was bright, and he held his hand out to shake Remus’.</p><p>“Hi, Remus, yes?”</p><p>Sirius Black had an accent. Thick, and buttery. Remus was still too taken aback to place it.</p><p>“Oh. I mean, yes, hello, Mr. Black.”</p><p>Mr. Black pulled a face, nose scrunching along side his warm smile, “No, no, Sirius. Please. Come in?”</p><p>Remus flashed him a smile of his own, “Thank you.”</p><p>“I take your coat?”</p><p>“Oh.” Remus looked down at the fabric in his arms, “Oh, I—“</p><p>But Sirius’ hands—large, Remus’ brain thought automatically—were already gently pulling it from his grasp and hanging it in the hall closet. Remus flushed a little and pulled at his shirt, suddenly feeling like his cover had been blown, “Thank you.”</p><p>Remus catches a flash of a golden chain as Sirius turns back towards him from beneath the opened collar of his shirt, “Hey, can I get you drink? Hungry? Order anything from room service. I’m have here before.” His grin is lopsided, “Know is good.”</p><p>“Whatever you want.” Remus raises one shoulder, his autopilot, kicking in, “This is your night, Sirius.”</p><p>Sirius’ smile falters a little at that, and Remus takes it as the cue that it is. He knows some guys like to ease into things like this isn’t a transaction, “We could check out the bar. A room like this, it’s got to have a nice one.”</p><p>Sirius nods enthusiastically, “Yes, big.” He brushes past Remus, and Remus sucks in a little breath about how he practically looms over him, “Good stuff, I show. You like vodka?”</p><p>“Ah. Yeah.” Remus nods, “Whatever you want.”</p><p>He follows Sirius into the main room and nearly laughs. Everything is pristine, but he’s surprised at how comfortable the room feels. The bed is huge and strewn with pillows, creme and light grays. There’s a large TV, a similarly colored sofa, and, in fact, a bar.</p><p>“You don’t like.”</p><p>Remus stands next to Sirius, looking somewhat lost at the many bottles, “Vodka is fine.”</p><p>Sirius tilts his head, eyebrows creasing with disbelieve, “Remus, you tell me. Want you have good time. Come on.”</p><p>Remus hums, “Well, honestly, I really don’t drink much.” The truth is he tries not to waste money. Alcohol is included in that category.</p><p>Sirius nods, “Okay, we forget. Don’t worry. I…” Sirius turns his back to the bar, leaning against it, “I’m a little bit not good at this, I, ah, you know? Not do this…before.”</p><p>Remus goes to respond but Sirius beats him to it, running a hand over his face, “And—And I know, my English…not so good, sorry.”</p><p>Remus shakes his hand, not being able to help the soft smile that crosses his face, “Hey, no, it’s fine. This is…you know.” He mirrors Sirius’ position then pushes himself up to sit on the counter, “What’s your first language?”</p><p>Sirius rubs his palm against the back of his neck, “Russian. From Russia. Come England because business take off.”</p><p>Remus nods, “I’ve never been. I know, <i>da</i>?”</p><p>Sirius’ face lights up so Remus figures he’s done something right, “Da, yes.” He raises an eyebrow, “Easy one.”</p><p>Remus snorts, “Well, yeah.” Remus pushes his hair off of his forehead, “Maybe you can teach me something.” He reaches out, curling his fingertips around the closer cuff of Sirius’ shirt, “Da?”</p><p>Sirius’ teeth dig into his lower lip. He pushes off the counter, crowding Remus’ space, “Если вы хотите учиться, я могу научить.”</p><p>“Huh.” Remus says, suddenly feeling just a little less steady. He has a brief, startling flash of arousal, of excitement. For a second this felt real. Like maybe he’s just happened to meet Sirius. The reality is all the more painful when it sets back in, but he keeps the coy smile on his face, “Might need a few baby steps, first.” He loops his arms around Sirius’ neck, and finds himself leaning towards the kiss anyway.</p><p>Sirius’ mouth is sure and warm. He kisses like each stroke of tongue and lip are one in a long line of steps designed to take Remus apart. It makes Remus let out a little breath. He’s used to being the more skilled one, but he gives back as good as he gets if the soft sound in the back of Sirius’ throat is anything to go by. Remus palms the smooth muscles that run from Sirius’ neck to his broad shoulders and runs into the chain. He follows it down, metal warmed by Sirius’ skin, until he’s dislodged it from beneath Sirius’ shirt. He fingers the ring there.</p><p><i>Married.</i> He sighs into Sirius’ mouth and passes it off as pleasure by pairing it with a squeeze to his shoulders.</p><p>“Bed?” Sirius mumbles.</p><p>Remus nods and is promptly unseated, the cool marble replaced by palms, “Oh.” Remus can’t help the little laugh that escapes and hooks his ankles around Sirius’ hips.</p><p>Sirius grins, nipping lightly on Remus’ lip, “This good?”</p><p>Remus directs their mouths together again in answer and locks his legs more firmly when Sirius tries to deposit him on the bed, instead bringing him with him.</p><p>“Too much clothes, yeah? I’m think I want to see more.”</p><p>“Mm. Better do something about it.”</p><p>They stripped off their clothing relatively slowly compared to Remus’ other clients. Sirius undid Remus’ buttoned shirt with careful fingers, stroking down his sides as he peeled it away. Remus ran briefly into trouble with Sirius’ cufflinks—dark, glittering stones that Remus took the time to place on the nightstand.</p><p>“So careful.” Sirius had said, tongue darting out to wet his lower lip as he smiled, leaning on his elbows above Remus.</p><p>Remus pulled him down for a kiss instead, and they stayed like that for a while before Remus’ hand wandered down to feel Sirius where he was hard in his boxers.</p><p>“What do you like?”</p><p>They both started, breaking their sloppy kiss to look at each other.</p><p>Sirius smiled, looking delighted that they had spoken together, “I’m ask you <i>first</i>.”</p><p>Remus squeezed his palm, reveling a little in the way Sirius’ mouth drops open, “I asked you.” He squeezes again, thumb hooking over the elastic band, and Sirius sucks a breath in through his teeth, “Tell me.” He traces the shape of Sirius, hot even through the fabric, and leans up to mirror the action with his tongue against Sirius’ jaw, “Sirius.”</p><p>“Yeah.” Sirius sighs out, “Okay, yeah.”</p><p>Remus falls into a sort of a bubble after that and they don’t talk much. They sort of just follow each other. Sirius’ hips slot against Remus’ and his hands mostly just find Remus’ hair and the dips between his ribs. Remus finds himself chasing Sirius’ mouth every time it leaves his, only to fall back into the pillows when it finds his skin again.</p><p>All in all, Remus feels a little swept off kilter. After, they lay side by side.</p><p>“Hey.”</p><p>Remus presses his lips together in a smile. He likes how Sirius starts sentences with that. Likes how soft the ‘h’ is in his mouth. Remus turns his head, “Hi.”</p><p>“Was good?” Sirius’ grin is goofy and warm as he props his head up on one elbow, “I like.” Then he narrows his eyes but it loses all effect because he’s still smiling, “Tell truth.”</p><p>Remus rolls into his side too, “What, you couldn’t tell? <i>Yes</i>, it was good.” He reaches out again and touches Sirius’ necklace, hooking his finger in it, “I liked it, too.” He liked how Sirius pressed their entire bodies together. At one point he had pressed his entire chest to the length of Remus’ back and Remus had done everything in his power to keep his knees from giving away. Not from the sex, necessarily, but just because it felt nice to be covered like that.</p><p>Sirius nods at the necklace, “Mama give to me before I leave. Have Russia…ah.”</p><p>Remus waits for him to sort out what he wants to say in his head.</p><p>“Well. Looks like Russian. Remind? Look.” He puts his fingers over Remus’ and tilts the ring until Remus can see the small eagle, wings spread, engraved there.</p><p>“Oh, a flag.” He mimics a waving motion, “Flag.”</p><p>Sirius’ eyes light up, “Flag, yes. Maybe she hope it remind me of home.” He looks a little wistfully at it, “It work.”</p><p><i>Not married</i> Remus thinks.</p><p>“Hey,” Sirius is suddenly turning away, reaching for something on his bedside table. He gives Remus a lovely view of his strong back, the stretch of his shoulders and the curve of his ass. He’s got a constellation of four dark freckles across his wing bones. Remus almost reaches out to touch them. Sirius returns with a tiny hotel pencil and one of the breakfast menus that hook over the door, “What do you want for breakfast tomorrow?”</p><p>Remus blinks, “Oh. You don’t have to do that.” He has a granola bar, it’s fine.</p><p>“No, no, I want to.” Sirius nudges a little closer and Remus can’t help but curl into the warmth, just a little, “I’m have, ah…eggs, toast, to the side of bacon.” His nose scrunches, “I say wrong.”</p><p>“A side of bacon. Close though, they would have understood.”</p><p>Sirius’ nose stays scrunched and he sighs, looking over Remus’ face, “You nice about English. Very nice. Some people not so good.”</p><p>Remus shrugs his free shoulder, “Well, then tell them to try speaking Russian.”</p><p>Sirius laughs, “I will. Good.” He holds his small pencil to the paper, “But breakfast, Remus. Really. We work very hard just now, you be hungry. Maybe we go again.”</p><p>Sirius’ smile is playful, his skin is warm and, honestly, Remus <i>would</i>.</p><p>Remus sighs and uses looking at the menu as an excuse to get closer. Sirius did pay for the entire night, so if he is really offering, “I’ll have the pancakes.”</p><p>“Banana? Chocolate chip?”</p><p>“Chocolate.”</p><p>Sirius turns, eyebrow raised, “Sweet tooth?”</p><p>Remus smiles, “You know sweet tooth and not flag?”</p><p>“Friend’s kid teach me. Cute baby. Like sweets.”</p><p>Remus hums.</p><p>“Tea or coffee?”</p><p>“Are you having any?”</p><p>“Remus, not matter.” Sirius sighs when Remus keeps looking at him, “I’m have tea, now which you want?”</p><p>“Tea.”</p><p>“You say because I say, or you like, really?”</p><p>Remus huffs out a laugh, “I really like.”</p><p>“Think you like sugar in tea, too.”</p><p>Well. He’s not wrong.</p><p>Sirius fills out the form and then wanders over to hang it outside the door—naked. Remus reaches to pull the sheet up to his chest. He likes Sirius’ confidence, but that doesn’t mean he completely shares it. He knows he has a nice body, but he flaunts it enough for his liking.</p><p>“Okay, all ready.” Sirius stretches obscenely, thighs pressed to the end of the bed for support. Remus bites his lip and looks because Sirius must want him to, “You want shower?”</p><p>Remus blinks in surprise. Honest, cool, surprise. It really is usually a fuck-and-sleep thing with him and to be offered a shower—not to mention <i>breakfast</i>—is…well, Sirius had said he’d never done this before. But if he’s offering. This place definitely has endless amounts of piping hot water.</p><p>“Sure, that sounds really nice, actually.”</p><p>Sirius nods and motions to the bathroom before flopping back onto the bed and reaching for the remote.</p><p>And Remus isn’t really sure what to make of that. He slowly stands and makes it all the way to the doorway before turning, “Are you…coming?”</p><p>Sirius had sprawled back against the pillows but pushes himself up on his elbows, hair messy and curling in his eyes, “You want?”</p><p>Remus can’t help but laugh again, “Sirius, this is about what you want. I—I don’t know, you said shower and I assumed…” He assumed Sirius wanted to fuck in the shower next.</p><p>Sirius sits up a little more and Remus watches him twitch with interest, feeling himself do the same, heat pooling in his stomach.</p><p>“I’m come.” He doesn’t bother turning the television off and follows Remus into the bathroom. Remus is turning the shower on when Sirius is suddenly warm against his back, cheek on his shoulder.</p><p>“Cold floor.” Is the only explanation Sirius gives.</p><p>Remus shivers, but the floor really isn’t that cold. The hot water feels good anyway and when Sirius ushers Remus beneath the spray he can’t help but close his eyes for a minute at the pressure. He hasn’t had a good shower since the last time he saw his parents. It’s been a while. He jumps a little when he feels Sirius’ mouth against his jaw and remembers where he is, what he’s being payed to do. He reaches forward and cups the back of Sirius’ neck, he licks into his mouth. Sirius mumbles something and then Remus’ back is against the cool glass of the shower wall but he’s <i>warm</i>. His entire body feels sparked by Sirius’ mouth and he breathes through a gasp as Sirius fingers dig into his hip, then inward, trailing a thumb just beneath where he’s hard.</p><p>“Nice.” Sirius breathes. The heel of his palm presses down, pushing Remus’ erection up against his stomach, “I’m think maybe…” He gets down on his knees, one at a time so he doesn’t slip, and looks up at Remus questioningly as if Remus could say anything other than—“Yes?”</p><p>Remus lets out a long breath, “I—Yeah. Yeah, if that’s what you want?” And then he can’t help it but add, “Please” but regrets it the second its out of his mouth. Maybe Sirius likes this though, maybe—</p><p>“Shh.” Sirius leans forward and licks a long, flat stripe on Remus’ dick, “I’m take care.”</p><p>So, he does like it.</p><p>Sirius breaths in and then swallows Remus whole. Remus has to let his head fall back against the shower wall because this hasn’t happened in he doesn’t know how long. His hands feel a little shaky and he blindly reaches for Sirius’ hair, Sirius who has yet to pull off and is subjecting Remus to relenting, tight <i>heat</i>.</p><p>“Fuck.” Remus lets out, and he curls one palm around the back of Sirius’ head, urging him on as he starts to make these clean, slow, sucks, “Sirius, I’m not going to…I mean, if you want to do anything else—”</p><p>Sirius only responds by wrapping his arms around Remus’ hips and pinning him to the wall. Remus could probably thrust towards him now if he really tried but he can’t find the strength, not with Sirius’ other hand lightly stroking his thighs. He stupidly thinks maybe Sirius didn’t quite get it.</p><p>“I’m gonna come, fuck, <i>fuck, Sirius</i>—“</p><p>Sirius hums, he understands, and it sends Remus right over the edge. His orgasm hits him when Sirius brings one hand to squeeze the base of Remus’ dick and the other to his balls. A second later Sirius makes a broken sound around the sensitive head that he’s suckling at and Remus feels something hot streak his legs. Fuck.</p><p>“Did you just—did you…” Both of Sirius’ hands were definitely otherwise occupied and that means—</p><p>Sirius pulls off and looks up at him, lips red and parted obscenely. His eyes are hooded and bright, cock slowly softening between his thighs, untouched, “I like.” He says simply.</p><p>Remus’ cock gives a last twitch that’s an almost painful effort at coming again.</p><p>One side of Sirius’ mouth lifts, “<i>You</i> like.”</p><p>“I—Yeah.” Remus sighs out.</p><p>Sirius pushes himself up and Remus thinks he’s leaning in for a kiss when he holds up a tiny bottle of expensive looking shampoo. Remus wonders if he could get away with keeping one of those.</p><p>“Close eyes.” Sirius says softly.</p><p>Remus does. Sirius’ hands are in his hair a few second later which, honestly, is probably still clean, they didn’t sweat <i>that</i> much, but Remus leans into the touch—especially when Sirius’ large palms wipe carefully over his forehead and temples, ridding them of suds.</p><p>“Soft hair.”</p><p>Remus smiles despite himself. There’s a little ping in his chest. Sirius doesn’t have to compliment him. Maybe he’s hoping Remus will lower the price.</p><p>“Like…ah, карамель? Sweet, you should know.”</p><p>Remus cracks one eye open, “Caramel?”</p><p>“Da.” Sirius murmurs, “Caramel.” Sirius’ “c” sound like his “h,” soft and sweet.</p><p>The next morning, Remus can barely wake up. Which, in consequence, startles him awake.</p><p>“Whoa, hey, hey.” Sirius quickly withdraws his hand where it had been softly shaking Remus’ shoulder, “Okay?” He looks concerned. He has a long-sleeved shirt on and what look like… leggings? “It’s just breakfast. Thought I let you sleep until it come.”</p><p>“I—you didn’t have to. What time is it? I’m sorry.” It all comes out at once and Remus feels slightly exposed now that Sirius has put clothes on. This feels like some strange one-night stand, not a pick up.</p><p>Sirius hands him a sweatshirt—one of <i>his</i> sweatshirts—and Remus takes it slowly but gratefully. He pulls his own boxers on, too.</p><p>“Don’t worry.” Sirius waves his hand as he makes his way back into the main room of the suite—presumably where the food is, “I’m want you rest, is fine. Food good, I’m already try!”</p><p>Remus blinks the sleep slowly out of his eyes for a moment before throwing the covers back and following Sirius, “I—have you been, like, to the gym?” The leggings and the wet curls of hair around Sirius’ ears should be a give away but who knows.</p><p>“No, no, I’m just shower. Like in morning. Feel nice.” He looks up over his steaming plate of eggs, “You can if want.”</p><p>Sirius doesn’t say anything about the leggings, and Remus isn’t sure if he’s telling him he can go to the gym or take a shower. He pushes a hand through his hair and shakes his head, “It’s okay.” He sits down across from Sirius and is only then, staring at the frankly huge stack of pancakes in front of him that he realizes he’s <i>starving</i>. He cuts himself a huge bite from all four of his stack and tries to be at least somewhat graceful about shoving it into his mouth.</p><p>He looks up at the snort that comes from across the table.</p><p>“You need eat more. I’m notice. Finish plate.”</p><p>Coming from someone else, Remus thinks he would have called it rude, but from Sirius it just makes him smile sheepishly. He crosses his legs and accepts the cup of tea Sirius holds out to him. Sirius then holds out the cup of sugar cubes and Remus laughs and rolls his eyes but takes two brown ones.</p><p>“I’m knew!” Sirius sips his own tea which looks completely black and very strong. Remus shutters internally at how bitter that must be. Sirius’ smile is lopsided when he looks at him over the rim, “милый.”</p><p>Remus raises his eyebrow.</p><p>“Sweet.” Sirius keeps what <i>kind</i> of sweet to himself.</p><p>“I, um.” Remus takes another sip of tea, “I can go whenever you need me to. I just want to remind you how long you paid for, I don’t want you to think I’m taking advantage of anything that isn’t…” <i>bought.</i></p><p>Sirius nods, like this is a usual conversation to have the morning after, “I’m have meeting this morning, but room paid for whole day, only way they give me late check out. Stay, if you want.” Sirius grins, “<i>Hang out.</i>”</p><p>He says it like he’s proud to know that phrase. A laugh bubbles up warmly from Remus’ chest, “I—Really? That’s…That’s really nice, Sirius, are you sure—“</p><p>“Yeah, yeah, most sure. Order room service, lunch, dinner. Yeah?”</p><p>And that’s how Remus ends up in a hotel room that is much to large for just one person with a club sandwich and the sun setting outside his window. It’s nice. But it feels strange.</p><p>“So…” James’ voice says on his cellphone, “You’re still there?”</p><p>Remus pops a fry into his mouth, “Yeah. He told me I could.”</p><p>“So, he’s your sugar daddy.”</p><p>“What? No. He had to. Or, he said he had to.” Remus groans and flops back onto the mattress, “I know, yeah, you’re right, this is weird.”</p><p>“It’s…No. Well, yeah.” James laughs, “I still don’t fucking like your job.”</p><p>“<i>One</i> job.”</p><p>James scoffs, “Yeah, one of three, like that makes it better. <i>Remus</i>.”</p><p>“I—he’s Russian.”</p><p>“<i>Okay</i>?”</p><p>“He has—He has a nice accent.”</p><p>“I—Isn’t there some kind of code against liking—“</p><p>“I don’t <i>like</i> him.”</p><p>“You like your hotel room?”</p><p>“<i>No</i>. Yes. He’s—He offered me breakfast and, and stuff.”</p><p>“Don’t tell me what stuff is.”</p><p>“No—James.” Remus laughs despite himself, “Like a shower.” He doesn’t tell James the rest of that shower, “I don’t—It isn’t usually like that.”</p><p>“So, he paid you in breakfast?”</p><p>“No, what? <i>No</i>. Will you stop being difficult?”</p><p>He hears James sighs, “What do you want me to say? Honestly, I have no idea.”</p><p>“I don’t know…Maybe—“</p><p>“Remus?”</p><p>Remus sits up on the bed, “Oh my god.”</p><p>James’ voice crackles in his ear, “No shit, is that him? Did he come back—“</p><p>Remus hangs up on him, “Um. Um, yeah?” He realizes he’s still in Sirius’ sweatshirt. And just his boxers, “I—bedroom.”</p><p>Sirius’ head pokes through the doorway and he grins, “Hope you still here. Hi.” Remus follows the glint of his necklace from the low sun as he crosses the room to sit on the edge of the bed, “Can I have fry?”</p><p>Remus blinks at him, “Sure. What are you—I can leave.”</p><p>Suddenly Sirius looks sheepish, “No, no, of course not. Some stuff get—moved. In town tonight, had to move flight.”</p><p>“Oh. Sorry.”</p><p>Sirius raises one shoulder and sighs as he undoes his tie, “No real problem.” He pulls his tie free of his collar and fiddles with it, “Ah. I’m think maybe…”</p><p>And then he’s holding out a bunch of neatly folded bills.</p><p>He smiles, “Is okay to ask two nights?”</p><p>Remus smiles because what else is there to do? Because that’s another month’s rent even though for a moment Remus thought Sirius was about to ask him…maybe to dinner. Maybe to see him sometime.</p><p>“Yeah, of course.” He takes the money, “I’d love that.”</p>
