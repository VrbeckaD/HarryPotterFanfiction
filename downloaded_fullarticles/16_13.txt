    <p>“I’m the bottom and you’re the top.”</p>
<p>“No, I’m the top and <em>you’re</em> the bottom.”</p>
<p>“That’s what I said,”</p>
<p>“Oh go fuck yourself,”</p>
<p>“But I’m the top.”</p>
<p>“No you’re the bottom now fuck off,”</p>
<p>The twins continued to argue, alone in their bedroom at the burrow. Muttered jibes not really meaning anything.</p>
<p>“Hypothetically,<em> hypothetically</em>, couldn’t we just switch. You know. If we were so inclined but we’re not because this is hypothetical.” Fred asked.</p>
<p>“What about Angelina?” George asked.</p>
<p>“Well,” Fred shrugged, “It’s not like you’re dating and this is all hypothetical anyway. Who is to say a young man like yourself couldn’t beat for both teams anyway.”</p>
<p>George mulled that over, leaving the room silent.</p>
<p>“Have you ever kissed a bloke then?” George asked.</p>
<p>Fred looked over his way in exasperation, “You know I haven’t because I tell you everything and I certainly don't remember having that particular conversation with <em>you</em> dear brother.”</p>
<p>“Well,” George began, “If you’re thinking hypothetically. Wouldn’t it, <em>hypothetically</em>, be a good idea to practice kissing a bloke if the occasion ever occurred for you to need to be good at kissing a bloke?<em> Hypothetically</em>.”</p>
<p>Fred frowned, “Kissed a bloke can’t be that different from kissing a guy,” Fred reasoned but upon seeing his brother’s face, an expression he couldn’t quite discern on it, he added, “But I supposed you’re correct. It <em>would</em> be an advantage to have practised kissing a bloke if you were to hypothetically pursue a bloke.”</p>
<p>“Well then it only makes sense,” Argued George.</p>
<p>“What makes sense?”</p>
<p>“For us to practice with each other in case the hypothetical scenario of us needing to know how to kiss a bloke arises. You even said it yourself; that it wasn't impossible for young men like ourselves to beat for both teams.” George encouraged.</p>
<p>“You know,” Fred mumbled catching on, “I think you’re right George.”</p>
<p>“I know I’m right Fred.”</p>
<p>“Go on then.” Fred demanded.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Kiss me.” And he puckered his lips teasingly at George, eyes closed.</p>
<p>Perhaps the anticipated response was a joking peck or a slap to the arm but Fred definitely didn’t expect the soft kiss of George’s lips against his. It was so gentle. It was more than a joke. With his eyes still closed, Fred felt George come closer to him. He felt George run his fingers into his own hair as he deepened the kiss and he could only return the gesture. Fred was sitting on the edge of his bed which made it easy for George to straddle his lap and run his hands over his twin’s chest muscles.</p>
<p>“This is all hypothetical, right?” Fred murmured as he broke the kiss for a second.</p>
<p>“Yeah, of course,” George reassured and continued kissing him.</p>
<p>“You’re getting hard Georgie,” Fred pointed out.</p>
<p>“It’s just hypothetical, Freddie.”</p>
<p>That didn’t stop George from grinding down on his brother’s crotch or from his brother reaching around to palm at George’s ass.</p>
<p>“What if, hypothetically, I wanted to fuck you?” Fred whispered in his ear.</p>
<p>“Then I’d be right. You are the top and I’m the bottom.”</p>
<p>“Git.” Fred laughed and caught his brother’s gaze. It suddenly wasn’t funny anymore. “This should feel wrong but it doesn’t.”</p>
<p>“Then fuck me,” George dared.</p>
<p>The two sat there unmoving until Fred hastily unzipped George's pants and took his cock in his hand, not afraid to give it a good stroke but looking up for his brother’s consent nonetheless.</p>
<p>When all he received was a raised eyebrow and a sly lick of his lips, Fred kissed him again but stronger, deeper. It was a blur as they got caught up in the passion, cocks in hand and moving further onto the bed for comfort. They were too focused with getting their trousers off that they didn’t hear the front door go.</p>
<p>“Boys?” Molly shouted up the stairs, “Fred? George?”</p>
<p>The two brother’s only barely heard the last shouting call when they scrambled apart, yanking up their trousers and getting as far away as they could to the sound of their dear mother walking up the stairs. Fred had only just managed to look like he was doing something productive (George merely flailing around) when their mother entered their room.</p>
<p>“Why didn’t you answer me?” She asked.</p>
<p>George cleared his throat.</p>
<p>“This book was really gripping.” Fred answered, waving a book as evidence.</p>
<p>Molly raised a disbelieving eyebrow, “That book, being a school book, was really gripping?”</p>
<p>Fred held her daring eye contest, “Yes,” he said firmly, “Fascinating.”</p>
<p>“Well I hope you find de-gnoming the garden just as fascinating,” She huffed and left their room.</p>
<p>Fred and George didn’t say anything to each other but the mirrored smirk they gave each other told clearly that this little interruption wasn’t the end of what they had started.</p>
<p>What mum didn’t know couldn’t hurt her.</p>
