    <p>Hermione sat in the dentist’s office where she worked as a receptionist and stared out the window, twirling her pen in her fingers. It was a nice, clear day out. The sun was shining and after a while, her eyes hurt from staring at the blue sky.</p><p>            It was a slow day at the office. They had had two patients in the morning. Then, she had just sat there waiting for lunch. The doctor went out, and she ate lunch at her desk with the office closed, stepping out just to by a sandwich around the corner. And now she sat waiting for an Eric Mitchell, who had made an appointment for the very last opening of the day. Ass.</p><p>            She hated slow days. It gave her time to think about her life. Her very, very crappy life.</p><p>            After the war, everyone was so relieved and happy it was over. They had such great plans for the peaceful times to come. They had won, had beaten Voldemort, and there was now hope. Hope for a bright future. The loved ones and innocent they lost could not have died for nothing. They had to make it so. They had to overcome it all, and live. Hermione had plans as well. She would do some good in the world. But first, she had to try and get her parents back.</p><p>            She went back to Australia to find them, but unfortunately she had only found her mother. Her father had grown ill during the year she was away, and had passed. Cancer. Her mother was still grief-stricken and didn’t go to work in the little practice they had started together anymore, so Hermione had to break into her house to see her – she didn’t open the door for guests either.</p><p>            Hermione cast the spells she had studied, hoping to get her mother back. But all she had gotten was an angry, depressed, confused and ill woman who resented her. Mrs. Granger blamed Hermione for everything, when she was actually Mrs. Granger and remembered having had Hermione – it came and went. She would say that none of it would have happened if it weren’t for her and her hocus pocus bullshit. She might still have her husband, the love of her life, with her if it weren’t for her daghter. Hermione hoped it would all pass once the grief did. So she took her home and cared for her. She avoided doing magic in front of her as to not upset her mother. All her plans could be put on hold for a while until she got her mother, the mother who had always loved her despite their differences, back. Her mother, however, never did quite come back. On the days she was confused and still believed she was Mrs. Wilkins, she would be better. Mrs. Wilkins was grieving, but in a healthy way, and slowly got over the death of her beloved Wendell. She was civil to Hermione, nice, though she didn’t know who she was. It only made Hermione feel more guilt. Mrs. Granger would mostly sulk and demean her, insult her, when all Hermione wanted to do was help.</p><p>            Why this happened she did not know. She was supposed to be a bright witch, and even though it was a hard spell that very few had dared try and succeeded at, she had thought she could do it. But perhaps there was something wrong with her spellwork. Maybe she had caused her mother to be like this. Maybe she cast the spell at a wrong time. She did not remember reading anything about a person’s frame of mind when casting, nor did she find anything in her research after the fact. But maybe she should have waited for the grieving to subside. But she only wanted to grieve the loss of her father with her mother, have support and be support for her. Maybe Hermione had no business doing magic after all. She could hurt people instead of doing good, as she wished to. There were days when her mother just sat in a catatonic state, and Hermione was not sure whether she remembered who she was or not, or who Hermione was. But, unfortunately, those days were the good days. Hermione had some peace on those days.</p><p>            No muggle doctor could see anything medically wrong with her besides perhaps a mild depression. Some suggested it was probably Alzheimer’s. She seldom took the prescribed medication though, and there was not much Hermione could do to force her. When she did take it, it didn’t do much good. Hermione couldn’t very well take her to St. Mungo’s. Her mother would never go willingly, and she couldn’t tell them she had practiced such unsanctioned magic on her parents. No one knew, and no one would know. Hermione had caused this, and now she would have to endure it.</p><p>            So here she sat, 25 years old. The little while her plans would be on hold turned into six years. She had asked for a job at Dr. Farber’s office to help sustain the house along with her mother’s pension. Dr. Farber was a friend of her parents and knew Hermione was a hard worker in addition to knowing her way around a dentist’s office, since she had spent much of her childhood in one. She still had some money in Gringotts she got with her Order of Merlin. Just sitting there, hoping for a future. But she thought that future was further and further away, becoming quite impossible.</p><p>            There wasn’t much else to her life. She had had a relationship with Ron for a few months after the war, but it ended. They really didn’t have much in common, and her mother’s behavior was enough to drive anyone away. They ended on relatively good terms though. She still had lunch with him and Harry and Ginny once every three months or so. They didn’t really understand why she had distanced herself from the wizarding world, and weren’t very supportive of her decision. It just happened gradually though, not that she wanted it to. But she felt she had to be there for her mother, since it was all her fault, and her mother did not like magic and would be awful to her when she practiced it. So little by little, she lost the will to do it, thinking she was truly not fit for it. Besides, she did not have anywhere to practice it, since she went from work to her house, from home to work.</p><p>            Ron, Harry and Ginny’s lives were perfect. They worked with what they wanted, Harry and Gin were married and with a baby on the way, Ron madly in love with a nice little witch from the Auror’s office. So Hermione felt uncomfortable and ashamed most days she had lunch with them. Good thing they hardly ever asked about her now, and only went on and on about <em>their</em> lives.</p><p>            She had had another relationship with a muggle guy she met in the grocery store, but of course it wouldn’t work out. If Ron, who knew every detail of her story, couldn’t understand her situation, a muggle sure wouldn’t. She hadn’t even tried to explain it. She didn’t even tell him her mother was alive.</p><p>            While Hermione sat there wallowing in self-pity, she heard footsteps down the hallway. Mr. Mitchell, she hoped. So she could finally go home and make her mother dinner and then lie in bed watching her movies and TV shows. It was what comforted her. If her mother was on a good day, a Mrs. Wilkins day, she could even have a decent conversation with her and share her day. She was nice on those days.</p><p>            She looked up at the door and didn’t have a reaction for what seemed like a really long time. She seemed to know the bloke, from a lifetime ago perhaps, but her brain didn’t make the connection as fast as it should. But then it clicked. Before her stood Severus Snape. His hair was cut short, but it was still full on top, and he now had a couple of gray streaks. Quite charming. And expected, after all the things he had been through. He looked much less solemn and grave, and that made him even more charming. His skin and general appearance was better as well. Perks of not being a spy in a war anymore? Or maybe she had a bad memory and just remembered him differently, based on what was always said about him back in the day, and on all the rudeness she had witnessed, though she always craved for his approval and liked that he was a strict and serious teacher. He wore all black still, but not his frockcoat she had grown so used to. Just plain trousers and a nice dress shirt, a normal coat and a scarf that was black and gray and sort of matched his hair.</p><p>            “Granger?” He asked, slightly surprised.</p><p>            “Pro… Professor? What are…”</p><p>            “I have an appointment. And I’m not your professor anymore. Or a professor at all for that matter. Just Snape is fine.”</p><p>            “But I only have a…”</p><p>            “Eric. Mitchell. That’s me. I couldn’t very well give my ridiculous name to muggles without them causing me some annoyance.” He rolled his eyes and sighed.</p><p>            “Okay. If you will sit and wait a minute, I’ll tell the doctor you have arrived.” She hurried through a door that led to a hallway with the loo, two offices and a storage room.</p><p>            She was mortified. She had hoped to never see someone from her old life while she was like this, living as a plain muggle, doing none of the extraordinary things everyone expected from her. That she expected from herself. She wished she could just apparate away from there, but it had been so long she had used proper magic that she wouldn’t manage, probably. She warned the doctor and stepped back out.</p><p>            “He’ll be with you shortly,” she said with a feeble smile and sat back down at her desk.</p><p>            Snape sat there staring at her as she wrote something down and he wondered what the hell she was doing there. She had simply dropped off the face of the Earth, when it came to the wizarding world that is. One minute she was there, on the cover of the Prophet every other day, alongside Weasley and Potter when it wasn’t he himself on the cover, the Death Eater spy who survived. Then she began to fade as only Potter and Weasley took the spotlight, as they would, and the papers reported on their lives as Aurors and all that. He often wondered what she was doing. She was a brilliant witch and could do anything she wanted to. He had often wished he had told her that, but his bitterness, his duties, his fear of being caught, had prevented him. Every once in a while there would be a footnote of her on an article that featured Potter or Weasley. It would say she was off in some other country studying something or other in the magical world, but he couldn’t help but think that if that were true, he would have heard of her. The papers would have more to say.</p><p>            He had developed a decent relationship with Potter. They weren’t buddies, but they would exchange some words in the Ministry corridors. So he asked about her every once in a while. But Potter never knew much. He only saw her every three months or so. Snape had even tried Weasley, but of course the baboon wouldn’t know much either. Especially since they weren’t a couple any longer. Good for her. Sitting there, now, he noticed that in addition to her – at least once – brilliant mind, she had very nice legs stretching down from her white uniform skirt, and her lab coat hugged just the right places for him to notice other enticing parts of her body. She had grown into a beautiful woman. Too good for Weasley, for sure. When he had asked the baboon, he had just mentioned something about her not doing magic any longer, which Snape found preposterous. Certainly some retardation from that dunderhead and his lack of focus or of the ability to properly communicate.</p><p>            But she did look kind of wretched. He couldn’t quite understand it. When the war ended, such a wave of relief washed over him – especially after he was acquitted of all crimes by the Wizengamot – that no matter what happened next, it wouldn’t be as horrible.  It <em>couldn’t</em> be. Even if he had stayed at Hogwarts to teach those mind numbing adolescents, he made a promise to himself that he would face life differently. He would work with what he had and be content. He had already been through the worst; it could only be uphill from there. It had to be. So he could not fathom how a pretty, young, talented little witch could look as if her life was worse than when she was hunting a megalomaniac murderer. He had half a mind to use Legilimency on her. No, it wouldn’t be polite. <em>You are not at war, you do not need to spy.</em> The doctor called him before he could act on his instincts.</p><p> </p><p>            She was gathering her things when he stepped back out into the waiting room.</p><p>            “May I walk you out, Granger?” He asked, and half a smile reached his lips. She had never seen anything close to that on that face. It suited him.</p><p>            “Uhm… yeah, sure.” She couldn’t bloody well refuse him, could she?</p><p>            They were quiet in the lift ride. He looked at her and smirked in a smoldering sexy way and she flushed red and looked down. Maybe it had been too long since she was with a man. Or with a toy. That is why she was finding him different and charming. She had never actually been with a man, only boys, and she hadn’t even had the urge, energy and will to wank in a long time. She was always so preoccupied and beaten down.</p><p>            “Granger, forgive me for saying this, but you look like you could use a drink. Rough day?”</p><p>            She snorted. “I could use a lot more than one,” she mumbled  under her breath without thought.</p><p>            “Fair enough. I’ll buy.”</p><p>            “No, you don’t have to, I…” She started, embarrassed.</p><p>            “Nonsense. I want to. If you don’t have other plans.” He smirked. He did find her sexy, but it was not why he was asking her for a drink. No. He would not put the moves on a former student. He wasn’t <em>that</em> carefree now. It was curiosity that made him do it. She was a member of the fucking Golden Trio for fuck’s sake, and had disappeared. He needed to see if he could know of something. He couldn’t bloody well ask her there. The bat in the dungeons cornering her in a lift, yeah, she would respond well to <em>that</em>. “And if you happen to meet a nice young bloke that catches your eye,” he continued, “you can tell him I’m your uncle. I promise.” He smiled. Actually smiled.</p><p>            She managed to smile as well. It would be nice to change things up a bit and not be stuck to her daily routine. It had been long since she had seen new faces. It had been long since she had seen <em>this</em> old face. And it would be rude to refuse him, since he was being so nice. <em>Wow, six years can really change a person.</em> There were leftovers in the fridge, her mother could manage fine without her for a few more hours. And she knew to call her mobile, or the neighbor – which she preferred – if there was any trouble. And the neighbor always did check in, especially when she didn’t see Hermione arrive.</p><p>            “Well then, I will accept that drink, thank you. If I could just stop at home to change…” She wasn’t going in her uniform to the pub.</p><p>            “What are you talking about?” He pressed a button on the lift and it stopped. “You can change right here.”</p><p>            “Oh no… I… I don’t really… use… magic anymore,” she said, abashed. She still carried her wand out of habit, and to try something if she was attacked. But she probably wouldn’t be able to defend herself anyway. Transfiguring her clothes would be way too much to jump back into.</p><p>            “I’m sure you can manage,” he gave an encouraging smile after suppressing the absolute horror and puzzlement that initially came to him with her confession, “smart witch that you are.” He turned his back to her and faced the lift door, to give her privacy.</p><p>            She hesitated but tried her hand at it anyway. She couldn’t act like a spoiled brat and outright refuse to practice a relatively simple transfiguration charm, though she very much wanted to. And he was a proper wizard and could fix anything she broke. There was no need, though, because she succeeded. She transfigured her outfit into black denims and a cream V neck blouse, modest heels and her lab coat made a good black overcoat against the February cold outside. She had forgotten how wonderful it felt to have magic coursing through her. He turned around to see her in that ensemble and had to suppress a growl that came unwillingly to his throat. She had also let her wild curls down. He composed himself rather quickly. <em>Not what this is about, idiot</em>. <em>If you need to get your rocks off you can find an readily willing, anonymous, muggle woman after you drop her off</em>.</p><p>            “Off we go then,” he pressed another button and they were once again moving.</p>
