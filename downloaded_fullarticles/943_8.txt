    <p>Hermione Granger was pacing the floor of her office as she read over the notes of her new case. This was her usual, even as the holiday paper cup sat at her seat in wait. Everything had to wait while she was organizing her mind. It was a ridiculous case of racism. No such thing as dark elves? Rancid and rude if she had to be honest. A typical open and closed case if she had her day in court.</p><p>The knock at her door sprung her from the review. "Granger?" Her boss said as he entered.</p><p>Hermione smiled and straightened her pressed suit. "Yes, Mr. Shacklebolt? I imagine this is going to be a quick case."</p><p>"About that," he hemmed. "I'm giving it to Malfoy."</p><p>"You are not," she retorted with a scowl.</p><p>Kingsley shuffled his feet as he shut the door behind him. "I am, and I wanted to tell you why."</p><p>Hermione tossed the pages down on her desk before folding her arms in front of her. "Why?"</p><p>"You're the best one we have at the firm. I need you to take a break, relax, do something this Christmas. You haven't had a day off that wasn't required in four years," Kingsley mumbled.</p><p>"I am the most efficient person in this firm, and you know it, Kingsley," Hermione groaned. "Give me the case, and I'll finish it before Christmas."</p><p>"I can't very well offer you to be a partner if you are busy with court," Kingsley said while stifling a smirk.</p><p>Her frown lessened as she arched an eyebrow. "Partner?"</p><p>"Yes, but I need you available for consulting and assistance on cases. Take a vacation, enjoy Christmas. After the New Year, we'll make it official."</p><p>Hermione smiled as she ran her fingers over her suit hem. "Alright, but I'll end up sitting in my office until we close for the holiday. There's no point in leaving town now."</p><p>"Well, family would be a good place to start, Hermione," Kingsley said and left her in the office.</p><p>The young woman with tamed curly hair sat down in her chair and sighed. That was something. Partner? She had hoped, but never in her wildest dreams did she think it was possible. She lifted the cup off the desk and scowled at the happy little Santa Claus. Ridiculous traditions.</p><p>Sipping the lukewarm liquid, Hermione grimaced and nearly gagged. "Rubbish," she scoffed. "Miss Bones, can I get some semblance of real tea?" She asked while pressing the intercom button on her desk.</p><p>The mousy woman with a disheveled dress entered the office and pouted. "You didn't like holiday blend?"</p><p>"No, absolutely and resoundingly not. Please get me something that doesn't scream Christmas?"</p><p>Susan Bones scurried to collect the cup and disappeared with little delay. It wasn't that Hermione hated the holidays. No, she quite liked the chill in the air and the smell of trees. She was opposed to all the dramatics that came with such a celebration every year. Escaping to the city was her best decision.</p><p>When her cellphone jingled on her table, and the name appeared, that was when Hermione realized it was going to be a hard thing to dodge this year. "Hello, Ginny," Hermione sighed as she answered.</p><p>There was crackling on the other end before someone huffed. "Hermione, I'm glad you actually picked up."</p><p>"I've been busy. How's everything? The babies are well?" Hermione asked.</p><p>"Yes, yes, but I have a problem," Ginny declared.</p><p>Hermione bit the tip of her tongue before answering. "What is it?"</p><p>Ginny groaned. "Harry broke his leg. Mum has been driving us both batty, and he's out of work until the New Year. Would you please come help us for Christmas?"</p><p>"She isn't going to try and fix Ron and me up again? I went through that last time, and it was enough for me to avoid the Weasleys," Hermione mumbled as she scratched at the grains on her desk.</p><p>"I promise she won't. Ron is dating that odd girl from the next town over. You know, the one that talks to animals," Ginny responded.</p><p>Hermione arched an eyebrow. "Luna? Ron is dating Luna?"</p><p>"Yes, that's the one."</p><p>"Oh," Hermione said.</p><p>"I know you have tons of shite to work out, but could you take time off to come help me? We haven't even decorated the yard."</p><p>Susan returned with a cup and set it down while Hermione thought. "Well, I am supposed to be taking time off," Hermione murmured.</p><p>Ginny was screeching on the other end of the line. "Harry! Hermione said she'd come!"</p><p>"No more, Molly!" Harry snickered loudly in the background.</p><p>"Hey, she still, my mum," Ginny hissed.</p><p>"Sorry," Harry mumbled.</p><p>"Okay, alright, I'll be there tonight. If I get one word about Ron," Hermione started.</p><p>"No, I promise, no one will say a word!" Ginny rushed out.</p><p>Hermione exhaled and nodded. "Fine. I'll head out and pack."</p><p>"You're the best, Hermione!" Ginny shouted before bidding her goodbye.</p><p>Hermione placed the phone back on the table and groaned while pinching the bridge of her nose.</p><p>"Family for the holidays, Miss Granger?" Susan asked.</p><p>"Yes, I suppose so," Hermione sighed as she glanced up.</p><p>"I made sure it was the right tea, and I can see about a car rental for you if needed."</p><p>Hermione motioned agreement and picked up her cup. "Thank you, Susan. I'm going to need this."</p><p>Susan smiled and waved. "I'll send over the reservation when I have it. Happy Christmas, Hermione."</p><p>Hermione sipped the scalding tea and breathed. She might need a bit more than this if she was going to brave her extended family for the holiday season.</p><hr/><p>The roads were slick and icy, but she made good time as she pulled up to the lovely house outside Hogsmeade. Her time spent here was short and far between in the last handful of years, but that was for a good reason. Godric's Hollow, where the Potters lived, was a tiny portion of a larger area, surrounded by rural cottages and farm homes. Hogsmeade was the busier town in the center of all the madness.</p><p>Harry settled into the small village and became the chief a few years back. Ron was his deputy, and they lived quite happily away from the rush of London. Hermione liked that busy life. The galloping madness of people and being lost in a sea of faces. It was a comfort to know she was one of many after living in this small village.</p><p>The sun was setting as she climbed from her car, but was nearly ran over. A dark antler-wearing dog barked, making her drop her tea as the boy on the sleigh hollered. If she didn't shut the car door, the boy would have slammed right into her and the rental. This was not how she wanted to start her visit.</p><p>"Sorry! He's incorrigible!" A boy shouted from the sled as it passed by her.</p><p>Hermione scowled after the child and watched as the massive black dog pulling the sled barked in jubilation. The boy was wearing a ratty hat, and the sled seemed like it had seen better days. When they rounded the corner behind some bushes, a panting man in a patched coat was jogging after them.</p><p>"Which way did they go?" He asked under his scarf.</p><p>Hermione groaned and pointed. "They went left. Nearly took my arm with it."</p><p>The man was bundled too much for her to get a look at his expression, but his laughter was heard in the air. "I'm sorry. Happy Christmas," He responded and resumed his pursuit.</p><p>"Happy Christmas indeed," Hermione retorted with a frown and collected her empty cup.</p><p>Hermione gathered her bag from the backseat of the car and proceeded to march up the snow-covered pathway. Her already sour disposition was even more exaggerated after the near-miss with toppling over a sleigh. There was a hope that might be the only possible accident of the visitâ€¦ but she didn't get her hopes up. Something about this place never sat right with her.</p><p>She knocked and was nearly dragged inside by the plump, pregnant woman. "Hermione! Oh my god, am I happy to see you!" Ginny shouted as she hugged Hermione.</p><p>Hermione smiled and squeezed back with difficulty. "I love you, Gin, but you're squishing Lily," Hermione murmured.</p><p>Ginny pulled from the hug and scowled. "Why did it take you so long to visit? I know you're busy, but we are up to our ears in children!"</p><p>"I know, I'm sorry, things have been hectic at work. I just finished that case against the superstore."</p><p>"Well, I have dinner in the warmer for you, and the boys can't wait to show you their new films. Why don't you go say hello to Harry, and we'll chat over dinner?" Ginny asked with a small smile.</p><p>Hermione bobbed her head as she shifted her bag. "That sounds like a good start. I need to get out of this suit."</p><p>"Good plan, burn it too. No working while you're here!" Ginny ordered.</p><p>"I can't promise that, but I'll make an effort," Hermione sighed.</p><p>"I'll take what I can get," Ginny conceded and wobbled through the hallway. "You can stay in the study. We had to convert the spare room into a nursery."</p><p>Hermione just nodded as she followed the pregnant redhead through the house. "That's fine."</p><p>"Ron said he'd drop by the decorations he borrowed last year. We're going to enter into the contest since Harry is out of work. It would be nice to give him a bit of a job. He's been going batty from the solitude."</p><p>Solitude? Doubtful.</p><p>"That sounds nice," Hermione sighed.</p><p>"Our internet is rather slow. You might have to run to town to print anything." Ginny continued as they reached the study.</p><p>Hermione grimaced and twitched her nose. "Alright."</p><p>"We're so happy you're home, Hermione," Ginny said with a smile.</p><p>"Me too, Gin," Hermione mumbled.</p><p>Ginny moved to the door and nodded. "You get into something comfortable. I'll tell Harry you're here."</p><p>"Thanks, Gin," Hermione replied.</p><p>The door shut, and Hermione exhaled. It was going to be a long two weeks.</p>
