    <p>Draco Malfoy was woken up by the first rays of the morning light filtering in through the curtains of the expansive room. He turned to the beautiful naked woman lying next to him, and smiled contentedly to himself. Today was going to be the day. His first giant leap towards a life filled with love and happiness. He was going to propose to the kind, sweet angel lying next to him, and he was not going to take no for an answer.</p><p>He was suddenly lost in the thoughts of how they had reached that point. Yes, the beginning of their relationship was not the greatest, but it all ultimately led to this point in his life. So he was not complaining.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Draco was in a miserable mood as he walked the halls of Hogwarts. This was not how he expected to feel when he wanted to join Voldemort. He was stewing in his own anger and frustration as he rounded a corner, when suddenly he collided with a soft body. A soft body with brown hair.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“You?”, Draco exclaimed.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The girl raised her eyebrows and looked at Draco as if he had lost his mind. Draco continued to glare at her but she was never one to back down from him, unlike most other girls he encountered. “Yes, obviously. Lost your mind along with your cockiness, have you? Well, it was a long time coming anyway. Oh, how the mighty have fallen.”, she drawled.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Draco kept a blank face in spite of his irritation, but there was a dangerous glint in his eyes as he caged the insolent girl against the wall with his arms on either side of her head, and leaned forward to whisper in a threatening voice. “Are you sure you want to get mouthy with me right now? Might just give me some interesting ideas.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Yeah? Like this?”, she smirked. And with that, she hastily unbuckled his trousers, zipped them open, removed his trousers and boxers together, and kneeled down to take his cock in her mouth in one quick move.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>They had been going on like this for a few months now. They had kept it a secret because they knew nobody would understand, and it was too risky, considering the war they were in. It had started off as a physical thing, but now Draco was not too sure. But he couldn’t voice those feelings, not even to himself. That would be too dangerous for her.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>With these thoughts in mind, Draco brought her to her feet, and hitched one of her legs to his hip, raised her school skirt, shoved her panties to a side, and slowly entered her. No matter how many times they did this, Draco was always surprised to find how well they fit. This abandoned corridor, where they met every time for their romps, was his escape from the harsh realities of his life, where there was no place for her or their relationship.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>She was the light in the darkness of his life. Although he was loathe to admit it, she had begun to change him slowly but surely. She was kind, generous, intelligent and everything that drew his admiration. And whenever he allowed himself to think, he wondered whether they could have a life together if they managed to come out of this war alive.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>As they neared completion, Draco grabbed her voluminous hair, and stared into her eyes, which were filled with warmth and passion. Her hair were his favourite feature of hers, but he would never tell her that. As her inner walls clenched around his cock, bringing them both over the edge, she cried out, “I love you, Draco.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Draco froze, even as his body shook with the tremors of his orgasm. As he regained his composure, he slowly pulled himself out, and dressed himself up, while she righted her clothes. There was an awkward silence, where neither knew what to say. Finally, having reached a decision, Draco cupped her cheek and spoke kindly but firmly. “We won’t be able to do this anymore. I hope you understand.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>With a final nod and a sad look, Draco walked away from her, knowing she was too proud to follow him or to try to persuade him otherwise.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>At that time, Draco was convinced that he had lost his only chance at happiness. But life did indeed give him a second chance. They had not only made it out alive, but they were able to get back together. And this time, although they did not try to hide their relationship, but they did try to keep away from the public eye as much as possible, considering their public profiles.</p><p>It had been five years since the end of the war, and they had been together for four of those. They wanted to take things slowly, considering their tumultuous past. But Draco now felt that the time had come for them to take their relationship to the next level.</p><p>Draco knew that there was no way that she was going to reject him, but he still couldn’t help feeling a little bit anxious. After the war had ended, Draco was cleared of all charges, due to him being underage. The testimony of Harry Potter and the greasing of a few palms at the Ministry did not hurt either. Draco was let off with a huge fine, which hardly created a dent in his fortunes. With his new-found freedom, Draco left for Paris. He took up his family business from there. He had big dreams for his company, and threw himself wholeheartedly into growing his business. But it was not all work and no play for him. He soon built up the reputation of a playboy for himself. Although the gossip surrounding him was grossly over exaggerated, but he did get around quite a bit. That was until he met her again in Paris, and they started dating.</p><p>He was sure that she would not talk to him when he had bumped into her at a French Ministry ball, leave alone give him another chance, considering how they had ended things before. But then, she had always been very forgiving. They picked up from where they had left off, and slowly withdrew from the spotlight to build their relationship away from public scrutiny. Two years ago, she was the one who encouraged him to venture into the Muggle world to further his business. And he had not looked back since then. Although they did suffer a few bumps along the way, but their love for each other still grew by leaps and bounds every day.</p><p>As Draco was contemplating all this, the woman next to him stirred awake and cuddled up to him. Draco was instantly aroused, and he started rubbing his erection against her thighs. At this, she giggled and murmured, “You’re insatiable, really.”</p><p>Draco quietly agreed, and reached down to finger her pussy. He was not surprised to see that she was already wet, and continued his ministrations till he felt she was ready. He then turned her over and brought her back against his chest. He slowly guided his cock into her pussy, and whispered huskily, “You like that, baby? You like my cock fucking your pretty little pussy?”</p><p>“Yes, oh yes!”, she moaned. “Suck my tits, baby. I love your mouth on me.”</p><p>Draco did not need to be told twice. He latched on to her right breast, and suckled on it with all he was worth, as he kept on fucking her pussy with deep, steady thrusts. He stopped suckling on her breast, and started fondling both her breasts with his hands, as he ravaged her mouth with his tongue and growled, “Come on my cock, baby. Come for me.”</p><p>As she came, screaming out his name, Draco went over the edge too. Pulling out his cock quickly, he grabbed her hair to pull her slightly off her pillow as he came to his knees, and sprayed his come all over her breasts and chin. Then he gave her a bruising kiss, and pulled her to his arms, as he lay down again to bask in their post-coital bliss.</p><p>When he regained his senses, Draco smiled at her and said, “Remember today is date night. Don’t get too engrossed at work and stand me up.”</p><p>She smiled fondly at him and said, “Like that has ever happened before. My work may be important to me, but you know you always come before everything and everyone to me.”</p><p>Draco smiled and kissed her on her forehead. He then got up, and pulled her along with him to the shower, where they proceeded to have another round of sex.</p><p> </p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Draco was sipping wine as he sat anxiously in the dimly lit restaurant and waited for her to arrive. They had agreed to meet here, and he had chosen this place as it was the most exquisite restaurant in the city, and he wanted nothing less than the best for this special occasion.</p><p>As he looked up, the door to the restaurant opened, and there she was, as resplendent as ever. She was wearing a green dress, it was his favourite colour on her. She was escorted to their table by the host, and he stood up to greet her with a kiss before they took their seats.</p><p>Dinner passed uneventfully and they had a great time, but Draco had still not worked up the courage to say what he wanted to say, when their dessert was served. Draco decided now was as good a time as any. As he tried to find the correct words to begin his speech with, she spoke up, “Are you all right, Draco? You look anxious. Any trouble at work?”</p><p>He smiled and held her hand before he spoke up, “Everything is fine at work. I was just thinking about us." He then turned serious and asked her, "Are you happy with me, baby? I know I have hurt you too many times, but are we salvageable still?”</p><p>She furrowed her brows and looked at him with concern before replying, “What’s brought this on, Draco? Of course I am happy with you, unbelievably so. And you should really leave the past where it belongs. It will not do us any good if we keep bringing it up and get sad about it. I love you, Draco, you know that. And we are not just salvageable, we are inevitable, we always have been.”</p><p>Draco nodded his head, but he still couldn’t help but feel anxious as he said, “I don’t know what I did to deserve you baby, but I want to push my luck a bit further here. I want you to know that you have been the shining light in the darkest times of my life. You always make me want to be a better person, if only to deserve you. You have made me feel so loved. Before, I could never understand how I came to have these feelings for you. I mean, you always stood for everything I was brought up to despise. But you helped me find my true self, and now I find we were never too different from each other to begin with.”</p><p>“I know I am too greedy to let go of the greatest thing that has ever happened to me, even though I still feel that I don't deserve you. And I absolutely want to spend the rest of my life trying to make myself worthy of you.”</p><p>Her eyes had started to mist over, as Draco pulled out the box from his pocket and held it open in front of her, where a diamond ring glittered up to her face. He could almost feel her acceptance as he spoke in a clear and firm voice, “Will you do me the greatest honour by accepting to be my wife, baby? Will you marry me, Astoria Greengrass?”</p><p> </p>
