    <p>Ron sat on the floor of the Burrow's homely kitchen unenthusiastically cleaning an unnaturally large array of crockery. His mother had them all working like house elves in preparation of the Bill and Fleur’s upcoming nuptials. At this point though she had mostly been provided Harry, Hermione and himself menial tasked designed to keep them separated. Part of her great scheme to prevent them from formulating a plan for how to go about finding the Horcrux’s. Ron groaned, honestly he couldn't care less about the stupid Horcrux’s right now, he knew Harry would have that covered, he planned on just following along as always. What he was pissed about right now was that his mother was inadvertently being a giant fucking cock block.</p><p>After Dumbledore's funeral Ron had seen his opportunity at last. Hermione had been upset over the old wizards passing, so he had used her grief to his advantage and made his move. He had placed his arm around her slim waist for support, pulling her close into his side. She had rested her head gently on his shoulder as she wept. Quietly he had whispered in her ear suggesting they go somewhere more private, promptly followed by an exaggerated sniff to demonstrate his reciprocated emotional state. He had thought perhaps that if she believed he was holding back his tears before the others she might be more suggestible to leaving the group. His plan had worked, they walked side by side back towards the desolate school. He had reached out grasping her hand, entwining his fingers through hers. She squeezed his hand in response and he had cheered internally, victorious at last. Once they reached the clock tower courtyard he had pulled her into a tight embrace, savouring the feel of her soft breasts pushed up against his chest. He reached his hand up and used the pad of his thumb to wipe away an errant tear before he had leant in and claimed her lips with his own. Since that day the pair had been an official couple, sneaking off to snog whenever possible.</p><p>Deciding he could use a good snog right now he swiftly shoved the mound of crockery, polished and unpolished alike back into the cupboards before setting out in search of Hermione. He found the desire of his affections hidden away in one of the homes many bedrooms with his annoying little sister. The pair were folding linen as they gossiped about nonsense, or at least Ron assumed that's what all teenage girls did when left alone together for any length of time. He lent against the door frame casually as he announced, "Oi Gin, I passed Harry downstairs, he's been looking for you."</p><p>A broad grin spread across Ginny’s freckled face as tossed the sheet she held back into the large pile. She stood and bound from the room waving a swift farewell to the pair as she went.</p><p>Ron arced an eyebrow and smiled mischievously at Hermione as he made his way into the room. He swiftly closed and locked the door behind him, casting a hasty silencing charm. Hermione smiled back at him timidly as she queried, "Harry wasn't looking for her at all was he?"</p><p>He shrugged in response, "Who knows, he might be."</p><p>Hermione shook her head from side to side but nevertheless stood and made her way towards him. She stretched her arms up and wrapped them around his neck, standing on the tips of her toes to lightly peck his lips with her own. He placed his broad hands on the small of her back and pulled her into himself, stifling a soft groan as her supple breasts pressed against him. He lowered his lips to hers again, however this time he did not pull away. He slid his tongue along her lower lip before prying his way into her mouth and deepening their kiss. He began to take small, deliberate steps, walking her backwards until her legs hit the bed behind her. He broke their kiss and pulled away from her, smirking as he reached up and gently pushed against her shoulders. Hermione tumbled backwards with a small shriek, collapsing atop the covers, her wild curls fanning out around her now flushed face.</p><p>Ron smiled down at his witch sprawled before him, ripe for the taking. He climbed on top of her eagerly, coaxing her legs apart with his knees. Lowering himself down onto her body he claimed her lips once more. Using one arm to hold the majority of his weight off her slim frame his free hand began exploring the curves of her body hidden beneath her frumpy sweater. Slowly he traced the concave of her narrow waist before sliding his fingertips up and over her breast. Her body stiffened below his own, yet he did not relent, deepening his kiss as he again forced his tongue into the warmth of her mouth. She just wasn't used to these sort of ministrations, but she needed to relax, to learn to enjoy his touch. He continued his exploration of her body and at last felt her nipple stiffen through her clothing, his erection twitching in response. He thrust his hips forward, grinding the hard bulge of his cock into the warmth of her clothing covered core. Hermione gasped coaxing from Ron a deep, guttural groan as he slid his hand off her breast and down her waist. He began to impatiently fumble with the button that fastened her muggle jeans.</p><p>Hermione's body instantly turned rigid, as if a Petrificus Totalus had been cast upon her. She broke their kiss abruptly and pushed both hands up against his chest. "Ron. Ronald stop!"</p><p>Ron released an exasperated sigh and lifted himself off her body. He reached down to adjust his throbbing cock, uncomfortably wedged in the confines of his pants. They had been at this for weeks now, every time he had thought they were close to finally fucking Hermione would suddenly make him stop. It was quickly becoming beyond bloody frustrating, Lavender certainly had not made him wait so long before putting out.</p><p>Hermione sat up on the bed, shuffling herself back from him and crossing her arms defensively in front of her body. "I'm sorry Ron, you know I'm just not ready for... for THAT yet." She said as her face flushed crimson.</p><p>Oh, for Merlin's sake she couldn't even fucking say the word sex, he was never going to get laid at this rate. Grinding his teeth, he forced a faux smile onto his face and replied, "it's ok babe. I better get out of here before mum finds us."</p><p>He stood and left the room without waiting for a response from the cock tease of a witch. He walked awkwardly towards the bathroom, his engorged member contorted uncomfortably within his pants. He entered the room, locking the door and casting a silencing charm before leaning back against the timber and swiftly unfastening his pants. Instantly his cock sprung free and he sighed with relief. He grasped his shaft and squeezed firmly, moaning at the sensation. He began to slowly pump his fist up and down his rigid cock. He closed his eyes and began to pant as he increased the pace of his strokes. His release growing ever closer his hips began to thrust forward, meeting each stroke of his hand fervently. With a low, husky growl he slammed his hips forward as long ropes of ejaculate shot forcefully from his cock.</p><p>His legs weak from his release Ron slid slowly down the bathroom door, seating himself on the cool tiled floor. His deflating erection still held loosely in his grasp he sighed. Now the tension in his loins had at last been relieved the consequences of his clenched jaw became evident. That fucking witch, look what she forced him to endure. He cast a quick Scorgify on both himself and the bathroom floor, ensuring no trace of his activities remained. He pulled himself up off the tiles and fastened his pants before reaching up to massage his aching temples. He wandered over to the sink and opened the door of the family’s sizable bathroom cabinet. He began to rummage through the extensive collection of potions, tinctures and balms in search of something to dull the throbbing ache within his head. His eyes fell upon something entirely different to the potion he had at first sought. He grasped the large vial of sleeping draught and smirked triumphantly, he had a bloody brilliant idea.</p>
