    <p>"Hey Rosier!"</p><p>A young woman turned to see a young man calling out to her. She rolled her eyes and kept walking. 'Not today...'</p><p>"Rosier, wait up!"</p><p>The young woman being called to was Haley Rosier, a first year at Hogwarts in House Slytherin who liked to keep to herself and her studies. She was constantly picked on because of her appearance with her strikingly green eyes and her silver hair and her porcelain skin. People said it was as if she was destined to be in Slytherin from appearance alone. And she hated that.</p><p>Rounding a corner into the library, Haley tried to find a secluded spot to do her studies, but the young man who had been calling to her was ever so persistent.</p><p>"There you are!" He said, finally catching up to her.</p><p>Haley looked at him and sighed. "What do you want, Weasley?"</p><p>The young man she spoke to was one of the Weasley twins, Fred. He stood a head and a half taller than Haley, fiery red hair and chocolate brown eyes and a goofy grin.</p><p>Mocking indignation, Fred grinned at her. "I was wondering if you'd lend me your notes from Herbology?"</p><p>Haley rolled her eyes and looked up at him, her eyebrow raised. "You fell asleep again, didn't you?"</p><p>Fred chuckled and rubbed his neck. "A bit."</p><p>Sighing, Haley reached into her bag and pulled out her notebook. "I've already finished studying for our test next week. Just make sure I get that back before then?"</p><p>Fred nodded. "Thanks, Rosier. I really appreciate it."</p><p>Haley managed a smile. "Someone has to look out for you when you and your brother goof around so much."</p><p>Fred looked down at her, a soft smile on his lips.</p><p>Haley looked up and saw how he was looking at her. "What?"</p><p>"You have a pretty smile."</p><p>Haley blushed. "Don't tease me, Weasley, else I'll take my notes back."</p><p>Fred chuckled and lifted up her chin, waiting for her eyes to meet his. "I wouldn't dream of teasing you, Haley Rosier. I've seen you in Charms class. I'd hate to get hexed."</p><p>Haley's blush deepened and she looked at him, seeing something more than the usual mischievous twinkle in his eyes. "Damn right I'd hex you. And I mean it, Weasley, I'd like my notes back before the test."</p><p>Fred chuckled and nodded, releasing her chin. "Promise." He started to walk away, then turned back to her and smiled. "Thanks, Rosier. And I mean it, you really do have a pretty smile. You should do it more often."</p><p>Haley blushed again and raised her hand in goodbye as Fred waved before disappearing out of the library. Sitting down by a window and looking out into the snowy courtyard, she smiled to herself. 'Maybe he isn't so bad after all.'</p><p>Haley sat with her House during dinner one night, keeping to herself as always.</p><p>"Hey, Rosier."</p><p>She glanced up to find George and Fred Weasley sidling up to her side of the table. "What are you doing over here? Shouldn't you be sitting with Gryffindor?"</p><p>George scoffed and rolled his eyes, but Fred just grinned at her and handed her the notebook she had lent him the week prior.</p><p>"Thanks for the notes, Rosier. They were a huge help."</p><p>Haley took the notebook. "Good. You better not fail tomorrow."</p><p>Fred chuckled and poked her forehead. "With your notes, I wouldn't dream of it." He waved before heading to his House table with his brother at his side.</p><p>"What the bloody hell was that about?"</p><p>Haley looked at the prefect who sat across from her. "What?"</p><p>"Since when do Gryffindor and Slytherin get all cozy like that?"</p><p>"Relax, Farley. You know how those two are. I gave him my notes so he'd leave me alone."</p><p>The prefect, Gemma Farley, rolled her eyes. "Seemed like he had more in mind than that, Rosier."</p><p>Haley glanced over at the Gryffindor table and smiled when Fred waved to her. She turned back to her table and blushed when Gemma gave her a look. "What?"</p><p>Gemma smirked. "There's nothing against seeing other people in different Houses, Rosier, just remember that not everyone will be accepting."</p><p>Haley's blush deepened. "There's nothing there, Farley, you're grasping at straws."</p><p>Gemma laughed and left things at that, having teased Haley enough. She liked the young woman, despite the apprehensions many held towards her. She completely agreed with the Sorting Hat's determination on placing Haley Rosier in Slytherin. She hadn't been attending Hogwarts long, but Gemma could see that aside from her introverted nature, Haley was a very cunning, ambitious, resourceful, shrewd, determined girl but she was also brave, courageous, daring, a bit adventurous, not afraid to accept and confront challenges and obstacles before her. She very well could have been put into Gryffindor, but there was something incredibly special about her that the Sorting Hat clearly saw that made its decision final.</p><p>Over at the Gryffindor table, George was asking Fred about Haley.</p><p>"What do you even see in her, Fred? She's Slytherin."</p><p>Fred just rolled his eyes and looked over at Haley. When she turned and saw him, he waved and was rewarded with a wave and that smile he was really growing to like. "She's more than that, George. There's something special about her."</p><p>George eyed his brother and sighed, a shrewd grin on his face. "Well, she is cute. I don't know, man, maybe it'd be worth a shot. We've done crazier things."</p><p>Fred watched for a moment longer, really thinking about what he saw in her. They had only been attending Hogwarts three months or so, but beyond her cute and alluring appearance, she was kind, caring, helpful, and loved to help the people around her. She put up with his shenanigans, would indulge his curiosity and persistence, and while she was really introverted and stayed away from people as much as she could, when she opened up she was bubbly and cheerful and the rare smile would appear and brighten his day. She was intelligent, well grounded despite being uprooted from her village to attend Hogwarts, and yet still had an air of mystery and intrigue about her.</p><p>Smiling to himself in that moment, Fred Weasley decided he would make it his mission- in addition to his mission of pranks and tomfoolery with George- to see her smile everyday and help her open up to the world.</p>
