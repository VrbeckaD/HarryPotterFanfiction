They're on their first date.</p><p>Daphne admonished, "Don't eat with your hands, you're not an animal."</p><p>Fenrir dropped his steak onto his plate and smirked. "I am an animal though, little girl."</p><p>Daphne reminded him, "It's Daphne."</p><p>Fenrir said, "I prefer little girl."</p><p>Daphne told him, "If you want to blend in, start acting like us non-werewolves do."</p><p>Fenrir smiled. "But, I like acting like a werewolf; little girl."</p><p>Daphne sighed. "Just act normal in Hogwarts, so others don't know your secret."</p><p>Fenrir grinned. "If it keeps you happy, I will. But, you look adorable when you're worried."</p><p>Daphne asked, "Do I?"</p><p>Fenrir beamed, "Yes, I like worried little girl."</p><p>Daphne replied, "As long as it's just the two of us, you can act like the big; strong werewolf you are."</p><p>Fenrir growled, but not in a threatening way. "Do you like big, strong werewolves; little girl?"</p><p>Daphne whispered, "Yes, they're mysterious and the danger of the unknown is sexy."</p><p>Fenrir laughed. "I like you already."</p><p>Daphne answered, "I like you too, wolfy."</p></div>
