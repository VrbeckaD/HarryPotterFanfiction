    <p>
  <span>Jennie Crewute didn’t even make it to the Sorting Ceremony before she was pegged as Jacob Crewute’s troublemaking little sister. The idea only cemented when she was sorted into Hufflepuff, same as he had been. If she was lucky there might be one or two teachers that didn’t look at her and see a carbon copy of her older brother.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rowan Khanna didn’t seem to care about her family issues at all though, thank Merlin. When she stood up for Jennie in the Common Room on that first day, Jennie knew she’d found a real friend and vowed to hold on tight to this one. She found a way to return the favor the very next day, when a Slytherin named Merula Snyde was pestering Rowan, claiming to be the most powerful witch in Hogwarts.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Of course, in doing so she’d accidentally cemented herself as Merula Snyde’s arch-nemesis, something she only realized after the girl sabotaged her Cure for Boils potion in class and further cemented her on Professor Snape’s (s)hit list. Hurrah. Hogwarts was going to be harder than she thought.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’ve already lost Hufflepuff ten points?” their prefect, Jane Court, demanded. “How’d you manage that? We’re in fourth place now!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I stood up for Rowan, but the bully sabotaged my potion in retaliation. Snape didn’t really like that,” Jennie said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jane frowned. “You’d do well to call him Professor,” she scolded. “Considering what your brother did to Hufflepuff’s reputation, I should’ve kept a closer eye on you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sorry,” she said honestly. “I didn’t mean to make her mad, I just wanted to defend my friend. I didn’t know Merula would take it so personally.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, Professor Snape sent a letter to the Common Room for you. I suggest you read it immediately.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why wouldn’t he just send it to me?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Probably because he despises you,” Jane said bluntly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jennie winced. “Yikes. Really got off on the wrong foot, didn’t I?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Professor Snape hates everyone. I wouldn’t take it personally.” Jane handed her the letter. She tore open the envelope and read it aloud.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Crewute, I have discovered evidence that your potion may have indeed been tampered with. While it does not prove your innocence, it does cast some doubt on my belief that you are hopelessly incompetent. Bring me a jar of Pickled Slugs from the Potions Storeroom, and I will consider restoring your House Points. Snape.</span>
  </em>
  <span>”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jennie frowned. “Would he sign it like that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What’s it matter?” Jane asked. “He’s offering to give us back the house points you lost! Hurry to the storeroom before he changes his mind!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Want me to go with you Jennie?” Rowan offered. “It’s the least I can do after you saved me from Merula.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sure. You know your way around the castle better than anyone.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And I also know eight easy ways to identify Pickled Slugs!” she said happily. “We’ll have this done easy!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not if you don’t leave you won’t!” Jane cried. “Hurry!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Exchanging smirks, the girls made for the storeroom.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Here’s where the letter said we should go,” Jennie said, stopping in front of the door.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Funny, I thought the Potions Storeroom was in the Tapestry Corridor,” Rowan said, then shrugged. “I guess there’s multiple.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, time’s a-wastin.” Jennie shrugged. “I’d rather not return to the Common Room empty handed.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Jane seems pretty concerned with those House Points,” Rowan agreed. They stepped inside.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Blimey, it’s dark,” Jennie squinted.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Quick, cast the Wand-Lighting Charm.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Lumos</span>
  </em>
  <span>,” she whispered, flicking her wand. “Why’d you close the door?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I didn’t, it just--” Rowan’s expression turned panicked. “</span>
  <em>
    <span>That’s Devil’s Snare!</span>
  </em>
  <span>”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s right!” Merula’s voice filtered through the door. “Some fourth year Slytherins showed it to me when I first arrived. It’s sensitive to light. If you’re really better at the Wand-Lighting Charm than me, escaping should be no problem.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rowan heaved on the door handle. “It’s locked!” she cried.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Merula open the door!” Jennie joined her in yanking on the door.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Merula said. “I told you things would only get worse for you. You should have never blamed me for your failure in Potions.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maybe not, but that’s not going to stop me from scrawling </span>
  <em>
    <span>Merula did it </span>
  </em>
  <span>on the walls in my own blood,” Jennie huffed, releasing the door handle to stand defensively against the vines, which were beginning to lash at them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, ta, Crewute!” Merula sang. “Shame you had to drag Khanna into this, but getting two birds with a single stone is just fine by me. Goodbye!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rowan rattled the door, shouting Merula’s name like a swear word.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll fight the Devil’s Snare; you try to get help!” Jennie said, pointing her wand at the plant.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey! We’re locked in here!” Rowan pounded on the door. “Get us out!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It took several minutes (in which time Jennie nearly was choked out by the plant), but finally help arrived. “Outta the way!” a deep voice yelled. Rowan took a few steps back and the door burst open, slamming against the wall, as a huge figure stepped into the room. He did a visible double take at seeing them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Gulpin’ gargoyles, Hufflepuff! Get away from that Devil’s Snare, yer scarin’ it!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>I’m</span>
  </em>
  <span> scaring </span>
  <em>
    <span>it</span>
  </em>
  <span>?” she choked. He took her by the shoulders and ripped her out of its clutches.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You saved our lives,” Rowan said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, thank you, Mister. . .”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Rubeus Hagrid,” he said grandly. “Keeper of the keys and groundskeeper here at Hogwarts.” He looked sideways at them. “How’d a pair of firs’ years like you end up in there?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A first year Slytherin named Merula Snyde locked us in,” Jennie said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She did?! What are ye goin’ ter do?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She hadn’t thought that far. “I suppose I’ll tell my classmates,” she said, “so everyone knows she can’t be trusted.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do yeh have proof?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, I have this fake letter from Snape telling me to come here, but I can’t prove she wrote it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Slytherins are good at coverin’ their tracks,” Hagrid said wisely. “I’d head back to yer Common Room an’ take some time teh think. I don’t want yeh doin’ somethin’ yeh’ll regret.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I guess you’re right.” She didn’t like it, but without proof who would take her word over Merula’s, when her brother’s reputation precedes her? “Thanks again Hagrid.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“One more thing-- yeh might want to do somethin’ about those robes. That Devil’s Snare got yeh good.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Looking down, she saw he was right. Her new school robes had been practically torn to ribbons. “Yeah, good idea. Thanks. Hopefully we’ll meet again.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We certainly will, Miss. . .”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Jennie,” she said, and then, more hesitantly, “Jennie Crewute.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, Jacob’s sister, eh?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She flushed very red. “Yes. And this is Rowan Khanna.” She tugged her friend up next to her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, yeh’d best be very careful indeed,” he said. “What with yer brother’s reputation!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I am, Hagrid, I swear. Scout’s honor.” She held up three fingers. “I’ll see you around, yeah?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“O ‘course, Jennie.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>At least </span>
  <em>
    <span>he </span>
  </em>
  <span>didn’t seem to mind.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re Jennie Crewute, right?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Would you believe me if I said no?” Jennie said tiredly. “Yeah, that’s me. And you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ben Copper,” the Gryffindor said, seeming anxious. “I’m a first year, like you. I just wanted to say thank you for standing up to Merula Snyde.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Who told you I did that?” She had a horrifying image of Merula complaining at the top of her lungs in the Great Hall.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I was watching from the end of the corridor,” he admitted. “I’ve been following her so she can’t sneak up on me, and if she sees me, I’ll at least have a chance to run away.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Strange, but solid,” she said. “Why?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She tormented me the entire way here on the Hogwarts Express. She kept threatening me, and calling me a Mudblood.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jennie scowled. “That’s horrible!” She was struck with a very strong urge to punch Merula the next time she ran into her. As if the Devil’s Snare hadn’t been bad enough.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Merula is obsessed with being the best witch in our year, and she thinks she has to impose her will on us to prove it,” Ben said miserably. “I’m just glad someone was brave enough to stand up to her. I’m certainly not. It’s a joke that I got put in Gryffindor.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t say that,” Jennie frowned. “There are all kinds of bravery; standing up to bullies is just one kind.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But I don’t have </span>
  <em>
    <span>any</span>
  </em>
  <span> kind. I’m afraid of everything. I come from a Muggle family, so all of this is new and scary to me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey, that’s okay. I’m from a wizarding family and it’s a bit overwhelming for me too. Just give it a couple months and it’ll all be old hat, yeah? The teachers are good at helping first years settle in. Well,” she added, thinking of Snape, “most of them are. I’ll help you however I can too.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thanks, Jennie,” he said, seeming relieved. “I’ll see you around.”</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
  <span>Merula accosted Jennie and Rowan while they were playing Gobstones in the courtyard, spouting some crap about Jennie’s brother. She didn’t believe it. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Jacob</span>
  </em>
  <span>, working for </span>
  <em>
    <span>You-Know-Who</span>
  </em>
  <span>? Not the brother </span>
  <em>
    <span>she</span>
  </em>
  <span> knew; never in a million years! She said as much, maybe a bit more harshly than she should have, because Merula got openly hostile and threatened a duel. Jennie knew enough to know that duelling wasn’t allowed on school grounds, and refused. Of course, Merula wasn’t one to back down.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Merlin, she’s a pain.” Jennie groaned, rubbing her tailbone where she’d hit the ground after Merula’s </span>
  <em>
    <span>Flipendo</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She’s never going to leave us alone, is she?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course not.” Jennie sighed. “She’s like a serial killer: doesn’t stop until she’s stopped.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So I guess we’ll need to stop her,” Rowan said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But unauthorized duelling is against the rules on school grounds, and there’s no way Merula’s going to play along if I try malicious compliance to get around it.” She rubbed her face. “And I don’t know any spells for duelling.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, Professor Flitwick’s a former duelling champion,” Rowan said, “and he </span>
  <em>
    <span>loves </span>
  </em>
  <span>you; you saw the way he looked at you when we learned Lumos.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t want to abuse Flitwick’s trust like that.” She sighed again. “Maybe Jane will know a better way to resolve the conflict; she’s a prefect after all.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jane did </span>
  <em>
    <span>not</span>
  </em>
  <span> know a better way to resolve it, as it turned out. Instead, she pointed them towards a secret duelling book hidden in the Artifact Room and sent them off to look for it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m getting flashbacks to the Devil’s Snare,” Rowan said, yanking the door open.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I feel like if Jane wanted us dead she’d just do it herself,” Jennie said, following behind and casting the Wand-Lighting Charm. “Hufflepuffs don’t make plants do their dirty work.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Bummer,” Rowan said cheerfully, “we could’ve thrown Merula into a patch of Venomous Tentacula.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not sure even Merula deserves that.” Jennie yanked open a cabinet.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Jennie. . .</span>
  </em>
  <span>”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She glanced back at Rowan, who was bent over chest deep in a pile of old trophies. “What?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Didn’t you say my name?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No?” Rowan pulled back from the trophies.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hm,” she mused, “I swore I heard it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maybe someone in the corridor?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You could be right.” She shook her head. “Let’s just find the book and skedaddle; I’ve got a weird feeling.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A few minutes later, Rowan cackled. “Found it!” She pulled it out from behind a plank of wood.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Awesome, now Jane can teach us to duel!” Jennie cheered, and then stopped. “I shouldn’t be so excited to break rules.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t think of it like breaking rules, think of it like learning new things.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Since when were you a troublemaker?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rowan grinned. “Since Merula started threatening my best friend.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jennie grinned back. “Let’s just get this back to--” she cried out, clutching her head and stumbling against a cabinet. It felt like her skull had split in half. Images flashed in her head, </span>
  <em>
    <span>a walking suit of armor, a staircase shrouded in mist, ice encasing Hogwarts, cracking as it spread faster and faster before her eyes</span>
  </em>
  <span>--</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>The ice is here,</span>
  </em>
  <span>” the voice said. “</span>
  <em>
    <span>The vault will open</span>
  </em>
  <span>.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Jennie!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She snapped back, hitting her head on the cupboard. Rowan was at her side. “Are you okay?” she asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I saw something--” she gasped-- “in my mind.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She told Rowan about the vision and the voice.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I wonder if your brother had the same vision,” Rowan said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You don’t think I’m mad?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course not.” Rowan linked their arms. “Come on, let’s get some sleep. We’ve got a long week ahead of us.”</span>
