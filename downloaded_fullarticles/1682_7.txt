    <p>A/N Some things might not make sense to you if you don't know what a veela is...</p><p>Hermione's POV</p><p>I heard a tapping on the window. There was an owl with Hogwarts letters in its beak.</p><p>Dear Miss Granger,</p><p>We are pleased to inform you that you have been invited back to Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry to re-do your seventh year.</p><p>Please find an enclosed list of all necessary books and equipment</p><p>Term begins on September 1st. We await your owl by no later than 31st of July</p><p>Yours sincerely, Minerva McGonagall</p><p>"Ron we got invited back to Hogwarts!" I yelled out to my boyfriend.</p><p>"Do we seriously have to go back to school" He groaned</p><p>"Of course we do. We didn't finish our education because we were to busy hunting horcruxes remember?"</p><p>"But it's not mandatory, right?"</p><p>"You can stay if you want but I'm going back"</p><p>"Ugh, fine I'll go back too then" He sighed</p><p>"Thank you"</p><p>"so, what stuff do we need to get"</p><p>I read the list, "The book list is the same as last year so we shouldn't need to get anything"</p><p>"Umm..."</p><p>"You didn't get last years books did you"</p><p>"Well we knew we weren't going to school that year didn't we. So there was really no point"</p><p>"Come on lets go to Diagon alley."</p><p>"Do we have to go today"He whined, honestly he could be such a cry baby at times.</p><p>"Ronald" I said sternly</p><p>"Ok, coming"</p><p>We apparated to Diagon Alley.</p><p>"Alright, you go get your books. I need to get new school robes"</p><p>"Ok" He kissed my cheek "I'll see you in a bit"</p><p>"Bye"</p><p>Sure sometimes he can be annoying but he's also really sweet. I walked through the doors of Madam Malkin's.</p><p>"Miss Granger, welcome."</p><p>"Thank you, I need new school robes"</p><p>"I thought last year was your seventh year" She said, clearly confused.</p><p>"We've been invited back, due to certain events last year" I explained whilst she measured me.</p><p>Suddenly the door slammed open. I turned around to see none other the amazing bouncing (Sadly he wasn't actually bouncing) ferret, Draco Malfoy. Well I guess he always loved a grand entrance.</p><p>"I'll be in the back" She said as she finished measuring.</p><p>I stepped down from the platform</p><p>"Granger" Malfoy said curtly</p><p>"Malfoy" I suddenly tripped and flinched expecting to hit the floor but instead I felt two strong arm around my waist. I looked up to see Malfoy with his eyes shut and was he... "Malfoy are you sniffing me?" This snapped him out his trance like state</p><p>"No" He mumbled as he helped me up.</p><p>I met back with Ronald and we apparated back to the muggle apartment I had rented.</p><p>"So you've got all you're books now" I aksed</p><p>"Yeah"</p><p>"Alright good"</p><p>I put my arms around his neck and kissed him.</p><p>Draco's POV</p><p>I couldn't get Granger out of my head. How her bushy hair had been tamed into soft waves and the way her luscious lips said my last name. But most of all I loved her delicious smell, it drove me insane when I had walked into Madam Malkin's earlier...</p><p>There was a pop</p><p>"Mistress Malfoy has asked Blinky to inform Master Draco that dinner is ready sir" Said a little house-elf</p><p>"Thank you Blinky" I replied</p><p>"It is Blinky's pleasure" Blinky said before disappearing again</p><p>I made my way down to the dinning hall. My mother was waiting in her usual seat with a nervous look on her face.</p><p>"Draco, there's something I need to tell you..."</p><p>I went and sat down at the head of the table "What is it Mother?"</p><p>"You're part veela"</p><p>"What!"</p><p>"You need to find your mate before the end of this year or you could die..."</p><p>"Why wasn't I told this before!"</p><p>"Your father thought it would be best to keep it a secret"</p><p>"How is that best! Just lie to your son, tell him he's a pureblood and let him bully the people who aren't. Yeah great idea!"</p><p>"Draco, I wanted to tell you..."</p><p>"Then why didn't you!"</p><p>There was silence.</p><p>I stormed up to my room.</p><p>Why did they have to keep this from me, now I have to find a mate as well.</p><p>"BLINKY"</p><p>*Pop*</p><p>"What does Master Draco need"</p><p>"Bring me all the books on veela that we have in our library"</p><p>Blinky ran out to the library and came stumbling back in with a tower of books in his hands and put them on my table.</p><p>"Does Master Draco need anything else"</p><p>"No thank you Blinky"</p><p>I spent the rest of the night reading all about veelas and how they find their mates...</p>
