    <p>Harry hadn't stepped outside a single time since the war. Locked in his godfather's gloomy house, his nose stuffed with dust and his skin that used to be so tan now turned milky due to the lack of sunlight. Under his eyes you could now find dark circles, betraying his many nights of insomnia. Hollowed cheeks from his lost of appetite, he had lost his good looks. The glorious boy who had lived was only a mere shadow of himself. And he could see the concern grow in his friends's eyes everytime they came for an imposed visit.<br/>
He hadn't smiled since his so called victory against Voldemort, his lips now felt rusty. Ron had tried to make them curved again until he had lost hope. The first weeks, he was acting in a exaggerated euphoria around Harry, it was too much to be believable. The boy had just lost a brother after all and Harry couldn't bring himself to believe he had actually manage to find joy again so quickly. It was all an act to prevent the chosen one to fall into depression. Touching, but ineffective. Worst even, seeing him making so much efforts was just bothering the boy a bit more.<br/>
Every time Harry laid eyes on his friends, he could feel his heart tighten in his chest, the price of the war weighting on his shoulders. All the sacrifices, the mourning. He had won in the eyes of the world, but the boy felt like he had lost everything in return. A heavy outcome. He couldn't help himself but feeling guilty, althought he knew he wasn't nothing else but a pawn in this fight. A pawn without will. <em> It's not your fault </em> Hermione kept telling him. <em> You didn't choose this war, Harry. </em><br/>
It was his destiny, but he couldn't stand the thought that his name had become the emblem of this conflict. Praised in every corner of the world. He was in a way flattered by the happiness the freedom had brought, but also he felt stained by the lost it had cost. Condemned to remain still and always the boy with the famous scar, too closely associated with the Dark Lord. He would never be able to turn this page from his story, never become anything more than what he had been in that moment. When he had watched him finally die, yet impregnate him more than ever.</p><p>Harry now spent his days sprawled on the sofa from the second floor, contemplating the void, lulled by the silence. He was losing himself in thoughts, constantly replaying the war in his head. Trying to go back in time to understand, to look for a flaw somewhere. As if to justify his guilt, a need to find a moment in past where he had missed and let all this misfortuine come out of it. So far, he had gone back to the graveyard, focused on the scene to analyze every detail of it contained in his memory. <em> What is the night that became the trigger ?</em> He was wondering.</p><p>Faithful to his new habits, he is now once again lost in the retrospective of his past. Focused on this moment. He sees Cedric's body again, and his own while he was restrained to the statue. The blood on his arm, the one that allowed Voldemort to come back to life. How can he not feel guilty when it's his own blood that brought back the greatest terror of the magical world ? Closing his eyes, the boy sighs, rubbing his temples. What if, that day, he had let Cedric take the cup by himself ? Why did he had to go to the end of this tournament he never even wanted to be a part of ? He could have simply dropped out before even entering the labyrinth... Not caring about his pride. Because really, that's all it was then, pride, nothing more. People were already spitting enough insults on him for no reasons, he didn't wanted to had the label of coward in addition to all the rest.<br/>
Siris, Dumbledore, Fred, Lupin, Tonks, Dobby and even Snape... Would they still be alive ? Harry growls in frustration. Too many names on this sinister list. <em> Fuck, fuck, fuck ! </em></p><p>Suddenly interrupted when knocks are heard against the front door, Harry comes out of his torpor. Straightening up painfully, his eyes dark, he takes a deep breath before leaving the sofa to go open. He knows very well who's hammering the door, because this scenario is now repeating itself daily. He can never enjoy his loneliness. And also, he knows that it's useless to try and play dead to ignore the intrusion. They would eventually force the door if he refused to open.<br/>
Unsurprinsingly, Harry finds a familiar brown head on the doorstep. Her long in untamed hair, her hazel eyes shining with constant thinking. Hermione and her determination to never miss a visit. Yet, Harry is surprised to find her alone, looking behind her shoulder, he was expecting to find the usual red head. But there's not a single soul to be seen.</p><p>"Ron ?"</p><p>The boy simply asks, as a greeting, always keeping his words to a minimum. To open his mouth requires too much efforts lately, to speak exhausts him.<br/>
He brings his green eyes back to his friend's. As always, she's putting on a smile. A smile so fake that it pains Harry to see it. She does not tire of trying, but he's getting annoyed to always see her try so hard to pretend everything is fine. Like he should still be protected from the truth, the chosen one that must be handled with care. That must be kept away for problems and worries. Because he had already suffered enough, hasn't he ?<br/>
He doesn't like this special treatment. He who has always wanted to be a an ordinary boy among the others. He feel his jaw tense, his face as always blank.</p><p>"He was sleeping so well this morning, I didn't wanted to wake him up."</p><p>She answers while sneaking inside, pushing to boy from the door, her arms laden with books. Harry feels the uncertainty in her voice despite the light tone she's trying to give herself. He's guessing a lie, or at least a very evasive answer that is hiding some other explanation that she's refusing to give him.<br/>
Without a word, he follows the girl who's already heading towards the kitchen and hurries to offload the books on the large table in a relieved sigh.<br/>
All this seems very useless to him. Hermione strives to make up for their missed year, passing their exams by owl thanks to a special permission. All that so they can simply go back to Hogwarts and keep on as if their life had never been interrupted. As if they could forget so easily, pretend and just move one.<br/>
Harry feels tense at the mere sight of the books. They represent a hope he can not reach. He doesn't want to go back to Hogwarts. Walk again where everything ended, where all this horror occurred.<br/>
He's shivering at the simple thought of it, a knot in his stomach, he feel nauseous.</p><p>"You should stop coming Hermione."</p><p>He says coldly to the girl who looks up at him. This is not the first time they're having this conversation, Harry has already tried many times to take the idea of coming here out of her head. But she's stubborn. Perhaps more than Ron whose determination he felt was getting weaker over the weeks. And now he seems to have finally decided to give up entirely. Maybe he's the smartest one of the two, maybe he has realized that saving Harry Potter was a mission doomed to fail.</p><p>"Enough with that ! Just sit Harry."</p><p>She answers with a firm tone, though without raising her voice, while taking a seat herself. Harry closes his eyes for a moment. Taking a deep breathe before yielding. He does not have the strenght to fight again, he doesn't want to argue. He just wants this to be over as quickly as it can. He sits facing her, staring at her for a moment while she's already grabbed a book to review its content.</p><p>"He gave up, didn't he ?"</p><p>He asks suddenly and the girl takes a quick look at him before plunging back into the pages of her book.</p><p>"No Harry, it's true he's starting to lose hope, but he has not given up on you yet."</p><p>"I... I just wanted to be alone for one, it's been a long time. Just you and me. And also, I had things to do before coming here. This I wanted to do on my own."</p><p>Her eyes are suddenly getting darker with sadness, the sadness she's usualy always hiding. Losing control for a brief moment. She tries so hard to always look like she's alright, but Harry can now see trough the lie. Frowning his brows as the girl tries to put her mask back, chasing the melancholy from her face.</p><p>"What things ?"</p><p>Harry asks with an inquisitive tone, wishing more than anything that she can finally be honest with him and allow him to see her flaws.<br/>
Hermione clears her thoat then stands up suddenly, heading for the stove, she fills a kettle with water and put it on the fire. It seems like an excuse to avoid facing him and buy time to gather her thoughts.</p><p>"I... went back to my old street this morning, to see my parents. Just to check on them. I saw my mother, she was looking for her car keys in her bag." She laughs softly as if she was evoking a tender memory. "Her bag may not be magical, but she always managed to make it even more stuffed than mine. Making it a hard mission to find anything in it. By rummaging through it, half of her stuff fell on the ground just as I was pretending to walk by her. So I... I helped her pick her things up. It was the first time I was able to see her so closely since... since that day. She smiled and said <em> thank you miss </em>... miss..."</p><p>Hermione's voice breaks, Harry can see her lower her head. He hears the knot in her throat, her beathing qiver as she tries to control herself. He feels almost guilty to be relieved to hear this sad story, to feel his friend weaken like this. To evoke her own losses, her own sonsequences. Because for a moment, she finally stops lying. And even it he feels the guilt gnawing at him, Harry feels like he can touch again, even from the tip of his fingers, the link that used to make them so unite. That link that had gotten so superficial and fragile since the war.</p><p>"I'm sorry."</p><p>He whispers and she turns to him. Her eyes are wet but no tears have flowed.</p><p>"Harry, it's not your fault !" <em> This again... </em> " I don't want you to feel guilty."</p><p>She approaches slowly to put her hand on his, but Harry pulls away, averting her gaze.</p><p>"But I am guilty Hermione ! If I hadn't been the boy who lived, if I was never born-"</p><p>"Oh shut up with that !" She interrupts him firmly, getting slightly upset. "Without you the world would simply have been ruined from the start. Yes, we all suffered losses, but compared to what could have happened..." She stops a moment and take a breath as if to calm down. "If we had to do it all over again, we would all still accept to pay this price."</p><p>Harry remains silent, lowering his eyes to his knees, he twitchs. Maybe she's right. The alternative would have been much worse. But the boy continues to dream of other scenarios whose conclusion would have been gentler on them all. He feels Hermione's hand touch his neck. As if to appease him. But he shudders and tense up at the touch.</p><p>"All this Harry, it will pass. The future is full of promises now, thanks to you. You can not continue to flog yourself like that. You did not save the world for it to be in vain, do you hear ? We bloody won, you saved us Harry !"</p><p>She continues with a tone now softer, now stroking the black and greasy hair. He can feel her voice charged with warmth and good intentions. He can see all her efforts to convince him that what happened was a good thing and not the other way around. But he still can not believe it.</p><p>"Not all..."</p><p>He add in a whisper. And he can feel her tense at those words. Annoyed by the negativity in him that she can't seem to erase.</p><p>"You..." She begings, ready to argue with him, but quickly gives up. Shaking her head. "How about you go take a shower Harry ?"</p><p>She simply suggests, stopping there their conversation. She knows that it's useless to insist. The boy is as stubborn as she is. She can only hope that he will eventually change his mind. But she also understands that she will not be ablo to force him to do so, she can't push positivity into him. Harry has do to this work by himself, no matter how much she tries to reassure him. She just hopes he knows he's not alone...<br/>
The boy nods before getting up without a word, heading as suggested towards the bathroom. He's dirty, he knows it. He hasn't washed for three days now. His condition is deplorable. He didn't even changed from his pajamas. He can even smell himself at this point.<br/>
He also takes this opportunity to isolate himself, the air becoming to heavy in the kitchen.<br/>
In the hot shower, he closes his eyes, tries to breathe slowly to calm down. Yet in reality he just wants to scream. Since that moment where everything stopped in the courtyard, he's been holding that urge to scream in his throat. And it's eating him.</p><p> </p><p>When he comes back to the kitchen, his hair still wet and wearing clean clothes, Hermione has finished making tea. He finds beside his mug, a plate filled with two toasts spread with jam. He looks at the breakfast prepared for him without much conviction. He doesn't remember his last meal, yet he doesn't feel hungry. The girls has already resumed to her studies, her nose in her book, a quill scratching a sheet of paper next to hit.<br/>
Her eyes then move to Harry, then to the plate.</p><p>"Eat, you need it."</p><p>She tells him when she sees him look at the food almost with a disgusted look on his face. Harry shakes his head.</p><p>"I'm not hu-"</p><p>"EAT !"</p><p>The boy flinches at the order. Hermione is obviously losing her patience with him. He rarely hears her raising her voice. She looks at him almost angrily. But Harry sees mostly despair in her eyes. And a feeling that he has rarely seen on the face of the brunette. Impotence. Like she's struggling to find the answer of a problem. And for once, she can't. Because she doesn't know how to save him anymore. Harry is a problem that she can't solve. And it's a first for her.<br/>
Feeling her gaze still on him, the boy feels almost terrified.</p><p>"Ok, I understand Harry, you feel guilty or whatever, you don't realize that you've done much more good than harm. You believe you're as responsible for all the unfortunate incidents than Voldemort himself. You don't want to get that idea out of your head. All right. But if you want to fix things now, don't force us to look at you wither away. Do not become an additional mourning. You did not survive in vain. Ron and me, we're still here, and we need you. Do you understand that ?!"</p><p>Her honesty leaves Harry disconcerted. But he needed that. He nods silently and gives in because he understands. Yes, he understands this time, and Hermione's words awoke something in him. He who couldn't find any meaning left in life, who couldn't even understand why he was still breathing. She manages to remind him of something he had forgotten. This friendship that unites them. The love for his friends. Despite the shame Harry feels towards them, he doesn't want to lose them, of cause them more pain.<br/>
All three of them, they are indeed still here. It's a miracle he can't ignore.<br/>
Catching one of the toasts, he forces himself to take a first bite. He can see a light smile of relief appear on Hermione's lips before she plunges back into her study.<br/>
The boy slowly forces himself to swallow the whole toast, but can't bring himself to eat the second. His stomach is, after all, drastically reduced. For the time being, she will have to be content with this small effort.<br/>
But he can feel that she's already considering the half-eaten meal as a victory. When she understands that he's finished with eating, she pushes a book towards him.</p><p>"Now, study."</p><p>And he does without trying to protest again. Not knowing if he's just bending to satisfy Hermione, or if he's starting to actually consider the idea of going back to Hogwarts. Give life a chance. Or at least, maybe try.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>...</p>
