  <strong>CHAPTER ONE | THE GIFT</strong>
</p>
<hr/>
<p class="western" align="center"> </p>
<p class="western">He had promised her a reward.</p>
<p class="western">As she approached her master's chambers she felt a wave of giddiness pass over her, almost like she was a young girl once again. Of course, she hadn't physically been young in a long time, and mentally even longer. Azkaban had taken care of that.</p>
<p class="western">A knot tightened inside her as she saw the heavy wooden door that led to her master's chambers before her, down what felt like a never-ending corridor. She tapped softly against the wood, smooth against her pale hand. His voice was barely a whisper, deep within the bowels of the room, yet it sent shivers down her spine. Her legs threatened to go weak for a moment until she placed a hand around the round, bronze handle. The door swung inwards with a soft sigh.</p>
<p class="western">The room was dimly lit with a candelabra in one corner beside the bed, and a roaring fire opposite a long-winged sofa. Her master sat with his beloved snake wrapped gently around his shoulders. He didn't move, apart from one long pale finger that was caressing the snout of the creature. His eyes were transfixed on the fire, almost as though he was receiving some sort of vision or communication. The snake hissed gently as Bellatrix entered the room, and her master's eyes met hers. The fire reflected strangely in his red eyes making them appear almost demonic. He muttered something in a guttural language she could not understand and the snake seemed to nod and then untangled herself from his shoulders. Bellatrix often wondered about the peculiar relationship he and the serpent, Nagini, had.</p>
<p class="western">"Good evening, Bellatrix." He said, "I see that you are looking healthier. The centaur's blood worked well, I take it?" He was referring to the potion he had personally made for her after she had escaped from Azkaban. She had been exhausted; malnourished. If he hadn't given her the centaur blood... Well, she didn't like to think about that. She had been robbed of her youth while she had been entombed in Azkaban. She would never be beautiful again. She had seen her face once or twice since she escaped. She was ghastly; a face like a skull and matted black hair. Yes, the centaur blood had restored some of her strength, but she would never be as she was.</p>
<p class="western">"Yes, My Lord. I thank you for that gift-" She started.</p>
<p class="western">"However," The Dark Lord interrupted, "I must add that restoring you was merely a courtesy I did myself," He rose gently from the sofa, towering over Bellatrix. She wasn't a short woman, but her master was slender; pearlescent skinned, those fiery eyes... She'd forgotten how beautiful he was. She felt her lips part slightly, and a tingling between her legs that she hadn't felt in almost fourteen years. The breath caught in her throat, "You are my most faithful follower, Bella," The pet name brought her back to reality. Her eyes flickered, "The most powerful witch I've ever met. I need you to be strong for what I have planned for Potter."</p>
<p class="western">He swept behind her, his long-fingered hands resting gently on her narrow shoulders, "You suffered for fourteen years. Fourteen long years trapped in that dirty cell of yours. Do you think that I would let that go unrewarded?" he hissed into her ear. She could feel his warm breath against the flesh of her neck. She let out a small whimper, "You forgot that I can see your heart, didn't you?"</p>
<p class="western">Bellatrix tried to form words, but the pulsing between her legs betrayed her. She let out a moan of anticipation.</p>
<p class="western">"Ah yes. I know what you want," his hands were tight against her shoulders now, almost crushing her. Her chest was rising and falling in shudders, "I've known your heart for a long time, Bella. I know your desires." He seemed to purr. The pressure stopped. His voice stopped. The only sound was the crackling fire and the soft hissing of the serpent that was trailing along the floor. The Dark Lord lingered for a moment, almost thoughtfully, before he pulled away from her, "No."</p>
<p class="western">Bellatrix furrowed her brow slightly. Her body was red hot, every inch of her aching for him, wanting to feel his hands against her back, the throbbing of his manhood inside her, his gasp of pleasure-</p>
<p class="western">"I will never do this for you." He whispered, "You think I, Lord Voldemort, would allow myself to stoop to <em>that</em> level? You're a fool for thinking it." He swooped passed her once more so he could face her. His red eyes were narrow, "Love makes one vulnerable," He looked down at the snake that was now resting at his feet and continued, "I suggest that you leave and think of a more appropriate reward."</p>
<p class="western">She left his chambers frustrated. The dull ache between her legs was still there when she returned to her husband. His breathing was ragged as she mounted him, his hands firmly gripping her hips. She had never loved Rodolphus Lestrange, yet he had his uses. This was one of them. She moaned loudly as the waves of pleasure started in her womanhood. One of Rodolphus' hands found her breast, the other found itself between her legs. He stroked her as she rode him, gently twisting her nipple, watching as his wife's neck jerked, her back seeming to ripple as she cried out her master's name. Wave after wave came, each moan of his name getting louder and louder until she was screaming it, the bed vibrating with every rattling breath. He wasn't far behind her. With a shriek of pleasure, he spilt his thin seed inside her. As she dismounted him she put a hand between her legs, catching a droplet of it. She tasted it and chuckled to herself, allowing the rest of his seed to drip down her thigh. Yes, Rodolphus Lestrange had his uses.</p>
<hr/>
<p class="western">She was trapped beneath the headless golden wizard, pinned against the marble floor. Her face was wet with tears. She was going back to Azkaban. Dumbledore would make sure of that. Yet as the Potter boy lay rigid on the wet floor she could hear her master's voice from his lips. The boy was surely dead, yet her master used him like a puppet. Dumbledore's pale blue eyes were wide behind his half-moon spectacles.</p>
<p class="western">"Kill me now, Dumbledore," He hissed through Potter's lips. Bellatrix felt the tear tracks hardening on her cheeks. The boy seemed to twitch violently as her master used him again, "If death is nothing, Dumbledore, kill the boy..."</p>
<p class="western">The air seemed to gasp in pain as her master reappeared. For the first time in her life, she saw fear in his eyes. He stood for a moment, looking at Dumbledore and at the crowd of Aurors that were running down the corridor towards the atrium, headed by Cornelius Fudge.</p>
<p class="western">"Master!" Bellatrix cried, "Please!" The headless golden wizard dropped like a marionette as her master waved his wand. He dashed across the atrium, gathering her up in his arms like a girl. She could feel his heart beating against her body, his breathing panicked as he looked for an escape. Then he twisted his body and with a faint pop, they faded away into darkness.</p>
<p class="western">When they reappeared they were in his chamber at Malfoy Manor. The fire was out, the candelabra was unlit. The room was cold. The curtains were open and outside there was nothing in the inky blue sky but glistening stars. Her master held her in his arms for a moment.</p>
<p class="western">"Are you hurt?" He asked, looking at her blotchy red face. She shook her head. He let her down gently, holding her hand as she found her footing, "How many were captured?"</p>
<p class="western">Bellatrix looked at him through her swollen eyes. She felt breathless, "I... The rest of them, My Lord. Lucius. Rodolphus, Rabastan, Dolohov... All of them."</p>
<p class="western">His face was impassive as he looked at her. His red eyes were like slits, his nostrils flared. Bellatrix fell to her knees before him, "Please, My Lord. Forgive me for this failure. I can't begin to..." Her voice trailed off as her master raised his hand.</p>
<p class="western">"I don't want excuses, Bella. However, this failure is not entirely yours. I placed Lucius Malfoy in charge tonight. He will be punished. As for you..." He considered her for a moment, his head tilted slightly to one side.</p>
<p class="western">She whimpered. She knew how pathetic she sounded, like a beaten dog as she curled on the floor. Her eyes swelled once more with tears, "Please, My Lord. Please. I beg for your forgiveness."</p>
<p class="western">Her master gave a soft mirthless laugh, "Don't grovel, Bella," He waved a hand and she clambered clumsily on to her feet. She gave a deep, snotty breath and wiped her eyes.</p>
<p class="western">"Dumbledore made me think tonight. He seems to think that there are things far worse than death," He paused, his eyes glowing in the darkness, "He's a fool, yes. But I can't help but wonder if he has a point. You know how long I have strived to find immortality and I have found it. Look at me." Bellatrix smiled at this. Yes, he was perfection. He was strong, powerful... She felt her heart flutter as he went on, "Yet I fear that in my quest for immortality I have forgotten what I've strived all of my life to do - to preserve the blood of my ancestor."The blood of Salazar Slytherin runs through my veins and my veins alone," He seemed to be talking more to himself than to her. She watched him with fascination as he went on, "If there was another to carry on his legacy, to keep His bloodline alive, I could train them personally – as I did with you, Bella. They would be my right hand, my most trusted advisor. They would be the most powerful witch or wizard alive - apart from myself, of course," he allowed himself a smirk, "There would be no more failures, no need to deal with the Lucius Malfoy's or the Dolohov's of the world. No, I will have an army with the new heir of Slytherin as their leader..." His chest was rising and falling rapidly, his eyes wide. He looked almost excited.</p>
<p class="western">Bellatrix flushed suddenly, her eyes welling with tears once again, "What are you saying, My Lord?"</p>
<p class="western">She knew it before he said it, yet she was surprised all the same, "You can have your reward," He stepped towards her, his pale hands outstretched towards her. He took her in his arms, "You shall give me an heir. Is that understood?"</p>
<p class="western">Bellatrix nodded, "There can be no higher pleasure."</p>
<p class="western">A smirk crossed his lips, "No higher pleasure," He repeated. Bellatrix didn't quite know what to do. She had laid with men before yet none as important as her master. He placed his hands on her waist and pulled her close. He was already swollen, the pressure of his manhood pressed against her. She gasped at the feeling of it. She looked up at him, as she had done many times before. This time however he leaned forward. His lips touched hers. She felt like she might explode. She had dreamt of this moment for so long, how rough he would kiss her, then his hands would tangle through her hair, unfastening her robes. Throwing her onto the bed... She felt him smile into the kiss. She must have been thinking too loudly. He bit down hard and Bellatrix gave a soft moan. Her womanhood was aching, her juices dripping down into her knickers. His hands did as she imagined, running through her knotted black hair. She removed her robes herself, her pale breasts revealed before her master grabbed them tightly and squeezed. She gasped in pain, pulling away from the kiss and revealing her neck. Her master bit down hard, tonguing the pale skin there. The moisture from his lips made her moan, imagining what it would feel like to have him do what only Rodolphus would do for her.</p>
<p class="western">"Don't think of him," He purred. He cupped her face, "Or I shall have Alecto Carrow do this task for me. And neither of us would want that now, would we?" He placed a hand down between her thighs, pushing aside the cotton fabric of her knickers. He stroked her, sliding a finger inside of her. She let out a loud moan as her legs threatened to buckle beneath her. He tasted her juices. They were red hot and running down his long fingers.</p>
<p class="western">"Go to the bed." He hissed, and he began to remove his own robes. Bellatrix, now naked, lay on the satin sheets of the Dark Lord's bed. She touched her breasts gently as her master came to her. His manhood was swollen yet pale. His body was skeletally thin. Every bone was visible yet he did not appear weak.</p>
<p class="western">He wrapped his arms around her legs, pulling her to the edge of the bed. She let out a soft whimper of anticipation as his head lingered for a moment. He waved a hand in the direction of the fireplace which erupted with red hot flames that danced shadows across the dark walls. He returned his attention to Bellatrix. He ran a hand through the hair she had down there; dark and thick. And then with a sharp flick of his tongue, Bellatrix let out a cry. He began to suckle at her, a finger tracing the opening of her sex as he teased her with his forked tongue. She could feel a tightness in her stomach, pressure building as he sucked harder and harder. Her back arched upwards and she let out a shriek, screaming "My Lord" yet he persisted, making her throb and ache with every wave that came. She grasped for the sheets, needing to hold onto something as her back arched again. She tried to keep her thoughts away from Rodolphus, yet as her master's tongue teased her she couldn't help but think about when he had done this to her, how she had dug her nails into his shaggy brown hair. She didn't dare touch her master, though her left arm – out of habit more than anything else – ached to grab hold of his head and force him down hard. A bead of sweat dripped between her quivering breasts as her master lifted his head.</p>
<p class="western">Without any warning, he pushed himself inside of her with a deep thrust. He quietly moaned as he gained his rhythm. He was rough with her, his hands resting on her shoulders, his nails digging into the pale flesh leaving red marks in their wake. Bellatrix felt delirious as another wave of pleasure swept over her as again and again, her master pounded into her. The bed was shaking, the Earth was splitting in two. Her throat was raw. She looked up at him. His eyes were shut, his mouth hanging open. He was breathing heavily. He was close. Bellatrix could feel his thrusting becoming even more urgent. Her back arched again as she was overcome with pleasure, and this time she flung her arms around his shoulders. He thrust deeper and then, with a grunt, he tossed his head back. His eyes were open. This time his thrusts were quicker, and then it was over. He had pulled out of her, his manhood now shrinking after he had found his pleasure, and he threw her robes to her.</p>
<p class="western">"Clean yourself up." He commanded as she dressed. He had already pulled his robes over himself, the snake wrapping her way around his shoulders, "And should my heir quicken inside of you, they shall remain a secret until they come of age. Is that clear?"</p>
<p class="western">"Yes, My Lord." She whispered, her cheeks flushed with passion. She could feel his seed heavy inside of her. It trickled slightly down her thigh as she left his chambers, the door slamming firmly behind her. He had not kissed her goodbye, he had not seen her to the door.</p>
<p class="western">"No higher pleasure..." She whispered thoughtfully to herself as she took a long, lonely walk back to her chambers, a hand resting on her stomach and her master's seed.</p>
