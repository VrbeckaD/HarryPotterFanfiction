    <p>They broke apart in a sweaty heap, limbs thrown every which way. The four-poster bed gave out a last creaky whine before the heavy curtains dropped down with an unceremonious thump. Marcus only gave a muffled grunt, heart still threatening to beat out of his chest from the vigorous fucking.</p>
<p>“Honestly,” Farley made an attempt at sitting up, feeling around for her wand. “Why in Salazar’s name does this keep happening? <em>Reparo</em>.” The swathe of emerald green samite lifted itself off their naked forms, slotting back onto the bedframe.</p>
<p>Marcus didn’t offer her an answer. He had known Gemma Farley and her sharp tongue for the last seven years, and she had never been particularly bothered by the approval of her audience. They had met up straight after dinner and gone two rounds in his dormitory - Farley hadn’t managed to come the first time.</p>
<p>Marcus still had Quidditch practice. They’d booked the field every evening for the entire week with a few helpful signatures from Snape. His mind drifted off while she summoned her knickers from his side of the bed, going on about the two rolls of parchment they owed fucking McGonagall until the end of the week.</p>
<p>“Who gives a buggering fuck, Gem?”</p>
<p>“Excuse me, aren’t you failing transfiguration, you complete dullard? You can put away your cock now, just letting you know.”</p>
<p>“You liked my cock just fine five minutes ago.”</p>
<p>“We’ll, it’s served its purpose,” she did up the last few buttons of her blouse before straightening out her hair with a few flicks of her wand. Farley had always been so put-together, top of the class, prefect, a demanding screamer in bed.</p>
<p>“Tomorrow?”</p>
<p>“I have to study potions tomorrow,” she stepped over to him and held on to his cock like she owned it before stroking it back to hardness. “And so do you, Flint.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>--- </p>
<p> </p>
<p>That was the very heart of the matter: Marcus didn’t study. It was a wonder that he had made it to his last year at all. He simply did not see the sense in it – why was is necessary that he learned all twelve bloody uses of dragon’s blood? Or the fucking whatist-treaty signed between Urg the Unclean and whichever minister of magic happened to be in office?</p>
<p>He’d voiced his thoughts to his father during the summer of his second year, and that remained the one and only time. The cold wrath of Reginald Flint had not spared him as a snot-nosed twelve-year-old, cowering in the kitchens with their old house elf. Zippy had made him a secret hot chocolate that night, waiting by his bedside until he’d drunk up to vanish the cup.</p>
<p>For all intents and purposes, the only two things he was any good at were flying and fucking. And while his talents were few, Marcus prided himself in being the absolute best in them, surpassing pretty boys like Diggory in reputation. Not that he ever bothered to listen for idle gossip, but the beddable population in Hogwarts was limited and word got around.</p>
<p>And quidditch? Quidditch made up his very being. A day without flying, without touching a broom, was a day wasted. End of the tale.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>---</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Pucey and Warrington both received a proper tongue-lashing during training for their sloppy broom-handling. Derrick and Bole, the complete imbeciles, almost collided mid-air with their bats raised. Malfoy, the lazy little git, blabbered about writing his father one too many times, but Marcus made them all do laps and hold formation until Madam Hooch turned off the lights after her third warning yell.</p>
<p>There was current of frustration strumming through his spine, but it was one of the satisfying type, like the scratch in his throat after a good, heart-felt scream. He shut down all grumbling and complains with thinly veiled threats and shoved Malfoy up against the wall of the broom shed for good measure, right next to their spanking new Nimbus 2001s.</p>
<p>Bletchley, the incorrigible twat, approached him while they were making their way back to the castle. “I heard Gemma Farley screamin’ like a banshee jus’ after dinner,” he told Marcus in that light, put-upon conversational voice he used to sound nonchalant. “So that’s still going strong, I suppose?”</p>
<p>“You can suppose it’s none of your damn business,” Marcus said, but his words were drowned out by his team cackling out loud. Derrick and Bole high-fived each other, for whatever reason, while Malfoy wore a hungry look on his pale, pointy face. Hungry for information, most like.</p>
<p>“I heard something about Weasley and the Ravenclaw prefect –”</p>
<p>“Bo – ring,” Montague intoned.</p>
<p>“Which Weasley?”</p>
<p>“How ‘bout all of them?” That garnered some guffaws and another high-five between Derrick and Bole.</p>
<p>“Fucking bloodtraitors,” Malfoy bit out, a tad too harshly for the jovial back-and-forth.</p>
<p>Marcus watched them toss around, holding his tongue. Terence Higgs had almost hexed him to shreds and promised him that replacing him with the Malfoy brat was something he’d bitterly regret come the start of the season. But seven new Nimbuses spoke for themselves, and Marcus had never been anything but utilitarian when it came to Quidditch.</p>
<p>Still, he didn’t like the arrogant little twat.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, the prospect of sitting in the common room with his team seemed less than palatable. Higgs still wasn’t speaking to him and most of his other mates spent their evenings revising for N.E.W.T.s., writings essays on antidotes and transfiguring buttons into bugs.</p>
<p>Now that really turned his stomach.</p>
<p>“You lot go ahead, I forgot the blasted playbook.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>---</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Flying in the dark gave him a feeling of absolute exhilaration.</p>
<p>He knew the grounds by heart: he could loop right through the goal hoops, skim the top of the stands with his shoes and press himself flat on the back of his new Nimbus and trace the grassy pitch with the tips of his fingers. The broom reacted to the slightest touch and didn’t at all vibrate like his retired old Cleansweep when flown too high.</p>
<p>Up and down he went, flying in formations with imagined teammates, dodging make-pretend bludgers and scoring a dozen goals against thin air. Marcus knew he was grinning like a loon, but who gave a sodden damn. He was all by himself.</p>
<p>The lights flickering from the castle’s numerous windows were already guttering out, one by one, when he finally drifted towards the ground. He left the broom hovering above ground by a few metres and flipped himself, holding on by the back of his knees with the world upside down.</p>
<p>Blood rushed to his head, but the position felt childish and familiar. Comforting in a way few things did these days. He could almost hear Zippy’s croaky squeak, going on about how “young Master Flint’s head will explode”. In the lonely darkness he could admit to missing his old house elf.</p>
<p>“Ahem,” a bodiless voice said to his left went and Marcus tumbled to the ground, landing painfully on the top of his spine.</p>
<p>“Fucking, bollocking – <em>lumos</em>!”</p>
<p>Oliver Wood shielded his face against the sudden beam of light, dressed in his Quidditch robes and holding his broom. “Flint,” he barked, a familiar urgency in his voice. “<em>Nox</em> it, you daft idiot, I had to sneak past Filch to get down here.”</p>
<p>Marcus had a few choice words to say, but the tip of his wand went dark first. He hadn’t noticed that it was already way past curfew. Detention was something he could ill afford, on top of all the revising he wasn’t doing and the assignments he wasn’t handing in.</p>
<p>“So. How’s the bribery treating you, eh? Good flying on those Nimbuses?”</p>
<p>Marcus grunted. He didn’t know how to talk to Wood without an audience, without his mates standing around, a leering crowd. He was self-aware enough to know that, so he kept his lips shut over his troll teeth.</p>
<p>Wood snorted, made an aborted gesture in the dark and kicked off the ground, up into the sky with a fluid motion. Marcus had to give him that: the Gryffindor was a damned good flyer, one with the broom and agile as a hippogriff in flight.</p>
<p>He stood and watched for an indefinite amount of time.</p>
