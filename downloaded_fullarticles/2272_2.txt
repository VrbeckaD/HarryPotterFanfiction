    <p>Hadrian was only a small child when the war between the Dark Lord Voldemort and Dumbledore came to an end. Dumbledore, the old fool that he was, put too much stock in prophecies, believing that the time for one of the most ancient prophecies to be fulfilled was nigh. He believed that the prophesied Master of Death walked the Earth, ready to bring balance to both the light and dark and peace to the people who suffered from seemingly endless war. It was this belief that brought him to the Peverell Mansion late one night under the cover of a thunderstorm.</p><p>It was far past the time that Hadrian should have been sleeping, but the raging storm outside had woken him. At the age of three, Hadrian was like many children in that he was scared of the crashing of thunder and the lightning that casted long shadows in his large, lonely room. Like many times before, Hadrian slipped out from under the warm covers of his too large bed and padded barefoot over to his door. He clung to the teddy bear that he had had for as long as he could remember and reached above his head to grab the door handle. The moment the door opened voices drifted up from the first floor. He recognized both of his parent's voices, but there was an unfamiliar one as well. Curiosity got the better of him and he wandered toward the sound.</p><p>"You know what the prophecy says, Roman," the unfamiliar voice said. "If there was ever a time for <em>their</em> presence it is now. The light has taken heavy blows recently and can't hold out much longer."</p><p>"There have been Dark Lords before, Albus," his father replied tiredly. "You yourself defeated Grindelwald without aid."</p><p>Hadrian reached the top of the stairs that would lead him down to the entrance hall and stopped. He knew that he would be in trouble if his parents saw him wandering around this late at night, so he hid just around the corner where he was out of sight and could still hear the conversation.</p><p>"Perhaps at one time," the man known as Albus said. "I am but an old man now, Roman. I can't do the things I once did. If you have the power to end the people's suffering—"</p><p>"I don't," his father snapped. Hadrian gripped his bear a little tighter at the sound of his father's voice. He had never heard him so angry before.</p><p>"And what of your son?" Albus inquired.</p><p>"He is but a child," his mother said. Her voice too was laced with anger. "We know you have used children in war, Albus, and Hadrian will not be a part of it. Do not go pushing your beliefs onto us in hopes that we will join your cause."</p><p>"So, you're saying that you don't believe in the prophecy?" Albus asked calmly.</p><p>"Whether we do or don't is not of your concern," his father said. "We have already said that we will not participate in war. Especially not one where both you and the Dark Lord are looking to use our family for this purpose."</p><p>"You should use his name, Roman," Albus said. "Do not fear his name or you will have already given in to his power. Is a world under Voldemort's rule one that you want your son to grow up in?"</p><p>"I don't think you fully understand what kind of world he wants to create," his father said rather cryptically. "There are two sides for a reason, Albus. One was not meant to hold dominance over the other forever. Even if the Master of Death was here to decide the outcome of this war, I don't think you would like their decision. You are blinded by idea of good versus evil, where the light is eternally good and the dark eternally bad."</p><p>"You can't tell me these things, Roman, when Voldemort condones the killing of Muggles and Muggleborns." For the first time since Hadrian had started listening he heard anger in Albus' voice. "What good do you see in him?"</p><p>"I didn't say he was good," his father replied. "I'm just saying that he is more than just evil, much like you are more than just good."</p><p>There was a long silence in what Hadrian imagined was a tense stand off before Albus sighed. "I see that I will be unable to change your mind tonight, but if you do, then you know how to contact me. Keep in mind the people whose lives you could save by taking a stand." There was a brief shuffling sound before Hadrian could hear the door swish open in the strong wind and then click shut.</p><p>Hadrian understood very little of the conversation he had just heard. He knew that there was something bad happening in the world, and because of it, he rarely got to leave the house, even to just play outside. His parents were always tense and seemed to always have something that kept them busy, giving them very little time to spend with him. He honestly spent more time with nannies and caretakers rather than his mother and father.</p><p>A sudden clap of thunder caused him to jump and finally turn the corner to find his parents. "Mother? Father?" He called out. They were still standing near the front door and turned to look up at him when he spoke.</p><p>"Hadrian," his mother replied. "What are you doing up?"</p><p>"The storm…" he said. This had happened enough times that they knew what he meant. He saw his parents whisper something to each other before his mother climbed the stairs to meet him. She took his small hand in hers and led him back down the hallway toward his bedroom. "Who was that man?"</p><p>"Just an old friend of your father's," she said. She didn't say anymore after that, so Hadrian didn't ask. They made it back to his room where his mother picked him up under the arms and set him down on the bed. "Now, Hadrian, what did we tell you about thunderstorms?"</p><p>"That they are outside and can't hurt me inside," Hadrian said sheepishly.</p><p>"Right," his mother said. "The noise and the light is just the movement of electricity, which can't touch us within the wards. You already know this, so why do we have to go through this every time?"</p><p>Hadrian felt like he wanted to cry but didn't say anything. He didn't want facts about thunderstorms. He wanted his mother to sit here with him until he fell asleep and tell him that everything was going to be okay, but he knew that she was busy. He didn't want to disappoint her by acting like a scared child, so he held back his tears and simply nodded.</p><p>"Okay," she said. "No more wandering around at night, alright? Your father and I have work to do."</p><p>"I understand," Hadrian replied. His mother said a quick goodnight and left, shutting the door behind her. Once again Hadrian was alone in his too large room on his too large bed, and all he could do was burry his head under the covers when the window flashed with light.</p><p>XXXX</p><p>The war came to an end no more than a month after Dumbledore's visit. The Dark Lord gained control of the British Ministry and Dumbledore and his allies were forced into hiding. Those who didn't act fast enough were caught by the Aurors under the new Minister's rule and faced trial. Most were sent to Azkaban, and the lucky few who weren't lost their political status and seats in the Wizengamot.</p><p>New laws were quickly put in place. Those who had supported the Dark Lord through the war, such as the Malfoys, Notts, Carrows, and more, gained an increase in their political status, causing the already influential families like Malfoys to gain incredible power within the government. One word from any of them could ruin an entire lesser family.</p><p>Even though an official rule was never stated, those of purer blood gained favor in the new Ministry. Pureblood witches and wizards were never turned down from job applications, and half-bloods and muggleborns had to fight for positions even if they had the best qualifications. The Dark Lord never stated his approval for this, but he never denied it either. His own favoritism toward those of purer blood led this idea to become common acceptance and the inequality spread to the minds of the people. Now, it wasn't uncommon for those of a purer blood status to be consider a higher-class citizen.</p><p>Despite not supporting the Dark Lord through the war, the Peverells status didn't change. It was common knowledge that the Dark Lord believed in the prophecy and was looking for the Master of Death. It was because of this that he gave them some leeway. After Roman Peverell's meetings with the Dark Lord concluded that he did not have what the man was looking for, he desired to meet Hadrian. Roman's pleas with the Dark Lord to give Hadrian until he was of age were accepted, but only because Hadrian was very young at the time and the Peverells hadn't taken a stand against him during the war.</p><p>The children of the previous light supporters were granted clemency and the option to continue attendance at Hogwarts. Even though their families lost all political standing, the children were given the freedom to make their lives as the pleased. They were kept under a tight watch but as long as they didn't act against the Dark Lord, they kept their freedom. This mercy led the Dark Lord to gain a high percentage of approval from the citizens under his rule, turning the favor from Dumbledore to himself fairly quickly. Contrary to popular belief, the Dark Lord didn't silence the voices of the people, he just tweaked the balance of power within the Ministry to his favor. Those who didn't understand the Ministry's interworking's didn't understand the changes, so many were left oblivious to this.</p><p>With the society now heavily magic favored, squibs and other non-magical people were excluded from society. The Dark Lord's rule forced out those who didn't have magic, so any squibs born were taken from their parents at birth and sent for adoption in the Muggle world while magical children born in the Muggle world were taken and put up for adoption in the wizarding world. This action led to some outcry from people, but the Dark Lord's charismatic speeches reasoned with many about the importance of preserving the magical community.</p><p>This was the world that Hadrian Peverell grew up in. Besides history lessons and hearsay from adults, Hadrian didn't know much about the society under Dumbledore's influence. The plan was always for him to remain neutral and follow the path in life his parents took. That is until Hadrian reached the age of five.</p><p>At five years of age, Hadrian began performing magic. However, his magic was doing more than just the occasional wandless outbursts. On one occasion, an emotional tantrum destroyed the entire east wing of the family estate. Because of this, Hadrian's parents began noticing how apt at magic he was at a young age and grew concerned. Hadrian noticed the concerned looks his parents kept giving him and the hushed conversations they had any time he performed accidental magic, but he didn't understand at the time.</p><p>This uncontrollable magic continued until Hadrian neared the age of eleven when his father finally gave him a ring. "Make sure to keep this on and never take it off," his father told him sternly.</p><p>"Why?" Hadrian asked as he examined the ring. It was simple in design with had their family symbol engraved on the top. He noticed that there were also quite a few other symbols written along the sides.</p><p>"This," his father said as he tapped the ring with his wand, "will keep your magic bursts under control and disguise you while you're at Hogwarts."</p><p>Hadrian felt the tingling of magic roll over him briefly before it disappeared. Curiously, he looked into the mirror that was besides him and was surprised to see that his reflection was completely different.</p><p>"Hogwarts?" Hadrian asked distractedly, still looking at his new appearance.</p><p>"Yes," his father said. "From now on you will be going to Hogwarts."</p><p>"But, father," Hadrian said, attention back on the conversation, "I thought you were going to teach me…"</p><p>"You will still receive lessons during your school breaks," his father said, "but if what your mother and I believe will come to pass, then there is something at Hogwarts that you may need."</p><p>"What is that?" Hadrian asked.</p><p>"Consider this part of a contingency plan," his father explained. "If things happen as we believe they may, then you will be where you need to be. If not, then nothing will happen."</p><p>"I don't understand." Hadrian tilted his head as he thought about his father's words.</p><p>"We will tell you if the time comes," his father said. "Until then, just focus on your studies, and while you're at Hogwarts, make sure to keep your head down. If the Dark Lord learns that you are there, then things may become dangerous. Understood?"</p><p>"Head down, avoid the Dark Lord," Hadrian repeated. "Understood."</p>
